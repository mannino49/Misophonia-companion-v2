# Misophonia Guide Vector Store Development Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines how to index your research folder and build a semantic vector search system using Firebase's latest vector search capabilities. It provides:
- A checklist for implementation
- Analysis of the most beneficial, easiest, and cheapest paths
- Firebase-native and alternative options

---

## 1. **Project Goals**
- Extract and index all research documents (PDF/DOCX) in `/documents/research/Global`.
- Generate vector embeddings for document chunks.
- Store embeddings and metadata in a vector store for semantic search.
- Integrate search into your web app.
- Use Firebase as the main backend (Firestore, Functions, Extensions).

---

## 2. **Options Analysis**

### **A. Firebase Firestore Vector Search (Recommended)**
- **Benefit:** Fully managed, scalable, integrates with existing Firebase stack, Google-backed security and reliability, simple integration with Cloud Functions.
- **Ease:** Easy to set up with Firebase Extensions or direct Firestore API. Embedding generation can be automated with Cloud Functions.
- **Cost:** Pay-as-you-go for Firestore storage and queries; embedding generation (Vertex AI or 3rd party) is extra but competitive.
- **How:**
  - Store document chunks and their embeddings in Firestore.
  - Use Firestore's vector index and KNN search for retrieval.
  - Automate embedding generation with Cloud Functions (using Vertex AI or open-source models).
  - [Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/vector-search)

### **B. Vertex AI Vector Search with Firestore or BigQuery**
- **Benefit:** State-of-the-art vector search, optimized for large datasets, integrates with Firestore or BigQuery as storage.
- **Ease:** Slightly more complex setup (requires Google Cloud Console, Vertex AI configuration, and Genkit/SDK usage).
- **Cost:** Additional Vertex AI costs for vector search and embedding generation, but highly scalable.
- **How:**
  - Create a Vertex AI Vector Search index.
  - Store document references and embeddings.
  - Use Genkit or SDK to index/retrieve.
  - [Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/plugins/vertex-ai)

### **C. Firebase Extension: Firestore Vector Search**
- **Benefit:** Fastest setup, minimal code, auto-embedding with Vertex AI, managed by Firebase Extensions.
- **Ease:** One-click install via Firebase console, configure collection/fields, handles embedding and search.
- **Cost:** Slightly higher per-query cost (extension + Vertex AI), but lowest engineering effort.
- **How:**
  - Install the [Firestore Vector Search Extension](https://extensions.dev/extensions/googlecloud/firestore-vector-search).
  - Configure to auto-embed and index documents.
  - Use callable functions for search.

### **D. Open-Source Local Vector DB (e.g., Chroma, FAISS)**
- **Benefit:** No cloud costs, full control, open-source.
- **Ease:** Requires running/hosting your own DB, not integrated with Firebase.
- **Cost:** Free but requires infra/maintenance.
- **How:**
  - Extract and embed docs locally.
  - Store vectors in Chroma/FAISS.
  - Build a custom API for search.

## 3. **Checklist: Firebase Firestore Vector Search Path (Recommended)**

### **Preparation**
- [ ] Enable Firestore and Cloud Functions in Firebase project
- [ ] Enable Vertex AI API (for embedding generation)
- [ ] Upgrade Firebase pricing plan (required for vector search)

### **Document Processing**
- [ ] Write a script to extract text from all PDFs/DOCX in `/documents/research/Global`
- [ ] Chunk text (e.g., 500–1000 chars or by paragraph)
- [ ] Store chunks as Firestore documents with metadata (filename, chunk index, etc.)

### **Embedding Generation**
- [ ] Set up a Cloud Function to generate embeddings for each chunk (using Vertex AI or open-source model)
- [ ] Store embeddings in Firestore documents

### **Indexing**
- [ ] Create a vector index in Firestore on the embedding field
- [ ] (Optional) Use Firebase Extension for auto-indexing/embedding

### **Search API**
- [ ] Implement a Cloud Function/HTTP endpoint to perform KNN vector search
- [ ] Return top-k matching chunks with metadata

### **Frontend Integration**
- [ ] Add a semantic search UI to your web app
- [ ] Display search results with context and links to source docs

### **Testing & Optimization**
- [ ] Test accuracy and speed of search
- [ ] Tune chunk size, embedding model, and index parameters
- [ ] Monitor costs and optimize as needed

## 4. **Paths Compared**
| Path            | Benefit                        | Ease          | Cost           |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Firestore Vector| Native, scalable, secure      | Easy          | $$             |
| Vertex AI       | Most scalable, advanced       | Moderate      | $$$            |
| Extension      | Fastest, minimal code          | Easiest       | $$+            |
| Open Source     | Free, full control            | Hardest       | Free (infra)   |

## 6. **Recommendation**
For your use case, **Firestore Vector Search** (optionally with the Extension) is the best balance of ease, cost, and Firebase-native integration. Use Vertex AI for embedding generation for best results. If you want the absolute lowest cost and are comfortable with more engineering, consider open-source options.
