What is Misophonia Companion?
Misophonia Companion is a digital guide designed to help people who struggle with strong emotional reactions to certain soundsâ€”things like chewing, tapping, or sniffing.

Itâ€™s not therapy, but itâ€™s like having a smart, supportive friend in your pocket who understands misophonia. It listens, helps you calm down when a trigger hits, and gives you tools and tips that are based on real science.

You can chat with it anytime you're feeling overwhelmed.

It offers quick exercises to help you relax or refocus.

It helps you track your triggers so you can see patterns and progress.

You can learn about misophonia through trusted, research-backed info.

If you're a clinician, itâ€™s also a tool to help your patients between sessions, and if you're a researcher, it can help gather insights about misophonia from real-world experiences.
