## The New York Misophonia Scale (NYMS): A New Instrument to Identify Misophonia in the General Population

USHA BARAHMAND, PhD MARIA E. STALIAS-MANTZIKOS, PhD YING XIANG ESTHER ROTLEVI

Misophonia is a condition in which certain sounds and behaviors elicit distress that ranges from mild annoyance to disgust or anger. The aim of this research was to develop and validate an instrument to screen for misophonia in the general population. Study 1 developed and explored the factor structure and item quality of the New York Misophonia Scale (NYMS), which originally included 42 triggers and 13 behavioral reactions. A sample of 441 American adults responded to the instrument via social media platforms. Of the original 42 triggers, 25 clustered into 4 factors: repetitive actions, mouth sounds, ambient object sounds, and ambient people sounds. The 13 behavioral reactions loaded on to 2 factors, aggressive and nonaggressive reactions. Study 2 evaluated the psychometric properties of the /uniFB01 nal version of the NYMS using a sample of 200 American adults. The results supported the validity of the factor structure and the reliability of the /uniFB01 nal version of the NYMS from Study 1. Finally, Study 3 explored the concurrent and convergent validity of the /uniFB01 nal version of the NYMS with the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ) and the Dif /uniFB01 -culties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Short Form (DERS-SF). A sample of 171 adult participants completed all of the scales. Good concurrent validity was found with the MQ and good convergent validity was found with the DERS-SF. Overall, the NYMS appears to be a useful and promising instrument for assessing misophonia triggers, severity of distress elicited, and behavioral reactions to the distress in the general population.

KEY WORDS: misophonia, sound sensitivity, distress, emotion regulation, Misophonia Questionnaire, New York Misophonia Scale

Misophonia is a relatively under-researched condition characterized by a decreased tolerance to speci /uniFB01 c sounds or stimuli associated with the sounds. 1 Although auditory triggers are most common, visual triggers such as leg shaking or feet wiggling may independently provoke distress in misophonia. The triggers are perceived as unpleasant or distressing and elicit strong negative physiological, emotional, and behavioral responses not experienced by most other people. It is not the intensity of the auditory stimuli but rather the pattern of the sounds or the individual s interpretation of them that is aversive. 1 ' The trigger stimuli elicit autonomic reactions such as increased muscular tension, increased heart rate, sweating, negative affective reactions such as feelings of anger, irritation, or distress, and behavioral reactions such as avoiding or escaping from the trigger stimuli, agitation, or verbal or physical aggression. Although there are individual differences, individuals with misophonia often report similar categories of triggers such as the sound of humans

chewing and repetitive movements such as swinging or tapping. 2 Further reports include sounds created by other people such as lips smacking, coughing, and throat clearing. 3 Misophonia can be a debilitating condition that affects the individual s concentration, ' social relationships, and overall quality of life, resulting in signi /uniFB01 cant distress, reduced academic or occupational functioning, strained social relationships, social isolation, or mental illness. 1,2 Some individuals with misophonia are aware that their reactions to misophonic trigger stimuli are disproportionate to the circumstances.

a team at misophonia-UK.org in 2010, this instrument is not intended to diagnose the condition but rather it is designed to measure the severity of misophonic reactions. While there is no reference to actual triggers, hierarchies of likely emotional and physical reactions to a misophonic trigger ranging from 0 to 10 are described. Psychic responses are assumed to precede physical responses, with the combination of emotional and physical responses considered to be indicative of the most severe levels of misophonia.

While misophonia was originally reported as a distinct clinical entity, de /uniFB01 ned as an abnormally strong reaction such as increased sympathetic nervous system arousal to sounds with a certain meaning to a person, 4 it was later proposed as a primary nosologic entity or discrete psychiatric disorder that could be classi /uniFB01 ed within obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder in the DSM-5. 5 Explanations for misophonia include that it represents conditioned physical and emotional responses 6 or patterns originating from early childhood/early adulthood that increase in intensity with repeated exposure to triggers as the individual goes through life. 7 Other studies have reported that misophonia symptoms can be found in the context of Tourette syndrome, 8 obsessive-compulsive disorder, 9 generalized anxiety disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder. 10 In contrast, a recent study by McKay et al 11 showed that the large majority of individuals with misophonia did not differ from those without misophonia on a range of psychopathological symptoms speci /uniFB01 cally related to obsessive-compulsive disorder, and only a small percentage showed elevations on some dysfunctional obsessions. These /uniFB01 ndings led those authors to conclude that misophonia may be a unique syndrome associated with a wide range of dysfunctional cognitions and stress-related symptoms. Similarly, a 2018 review of the literature on misophonia by Brout et al 12 also suggested that misophonia may just be a condition characterized by high levels of psychological distress not uniquely associated with any speci /uniFB01 c disorder. Therefore, the existing evidence indicates that the relationship of misophonia with other psychiatric conditions is far from clear and warrants further research.

Several scales have been developed to assess this condition. One of the earliest measures was the Misophonia Activation Scale (MAS-1). 13 Developed by

While the MAS-1 focuses relatively more on emotional than physical responses, the Misophonia Physiological Response Scale (MPRS) 14 assesses the intensity of physical reactions to triggers. It was developed by Bauman 14 in 2015 to be used in conjunction with the MAS-1. A less well-known scale is the Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ) developed by Johnson 15 in 2014, which has been used in one case study involving treatment of misophonia. 16 These 3 scales have not been widely used in research, nor have their psychometric properties been reported in peer-reviewed journals.

Schröder et al 5 conducted a study that led them, in 2013, to propose diagnostic criteria for misophonia as well as to develop the 6-item Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-Miso-S), later revised as the A-MisoS-R. This scale includes 3 sections assessing sensitivity to various categories of sounds, emotional responses and cognitions, and functional impairment associated with the sound triggers. This scale was adapted from the Yale -Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and is based on the assumption that misophonia is strongly associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder, an assumption that has not been consistently substantiated in research. Also, the validity of the measure has not been tested. The A-Miso-S has been used in research testing the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for misophonia 17 and comorbidity in misophonia. 18 20 -

The Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ) 2 is another instrument developed to measure the severity of misophonia and is probably the most widely used measure for misophonia. The scale has been validated in a sample of undergraduate students, and its wide use is likely due to its empirically supported psychometric properties as well as its simple structure. The questionnaire assesses sensitivity to categories of triggers; cognitive, behavioral, and emotional responses to the triggers; and severity of

misophonia. This scale has also been used in research on misophonia 21 and the comorbidity of misophonia with other psychiatric conditions. 11,22 Although widely used, the scale appears to measure sound sensitivity rather than misophonia, as its external validity was assessed with a questionnaire that measures sound sensitivity and the instrument includes only auditory triggers, while individuals with misophonia may show a decreased tolerance to any stimuli associated with the auditory triggers. 1 That is, patterned visual stimuli may also serve as triggers. Secondly, the MQ does not assess responses to speci /uniFB01 c triggers but instead groups various triggers together implying the assumption that only a limited range of auditory stimuli may provoke misophonic reactions. Furthermore, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive responses are all grouped together, obscuring any potential individual differences in reactions to misophonic triggers and compromising the practical utility of this subscale. Finally, the scale measures severity with 1 question, further casting doubt on the necessity or advantage of the 2 subscale scores.

be used to quickly identify individuals experiencing misophonic distress. The speci /uniFB01 c drawbacks of the existing measures are presented in Table 1.

Three recently developed measures of misophonia are MisoQuest, 23 the Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Scale (S-Five), 24 and the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ). 25 MisoQuest is a questionnaire developed in Polish and based on the criteria proposed by Schröder et al 5 in 2013. This instrument assesses strong somatic and emotional reactions to aversive sounds made by the human body, animals, or things, and the items may not be endorsed by individuals with mild or moderate levels of misophonic reactions. The S-Five measures externalizing appraisals, internalizing appraisals, impact, outbursts, and threat. The authors state the scale factors have good reliability, and the scale validity was demonstrated by comparison with the MQ and A-Miso-S. This scale assesses the cognitive and emotional experiences of individuals with misophonia. It cannot be used as a measure to screen for or identify individuals with misophonia. The DMQ is a comprehensive tool, with 2 composite scales capturing many of the aspects of misophonia identi /uniFB01 ed in the recently published ' consensus de /uniFB01 nition ' of misophonia. 1 The instrument is reported to have excellent psychometric properties and provides cut-off points for identifying clinical severity. The only possible drawback with this instrument is its length. With 86 items, it may not

The existing instruments described above were all designed for the purpose of identifying the severity of misophonia, focusing mainly on anger responses. However, these questionnaires vary in their focus in different ways. The MAS-1 and MPRS focus on the severity of emotional and physical responses, respectively, while the MAQ and the A-MISO-S assess the emotional impact of misophonia. The MQ, MisoQuest, and S-Five represent attempts to develop tools to measure triggers, responses, and the impact of misophonia -that is, the items in these scales are more likely to be endorsed by individuals with moderate to very severe levels of misophonia. According to the recent consensus de /uniFB01 nition presented by Swedo et al, 1 misophonia may be a condition characterized by varying degrees of negative emotions ranging from slight discomfort or irritation to extreme disgust and anger. Similarly, reactions to triggers may range from nonconfrontational reactions associated with no functional impairment to aggressive responses and maladjustment. Furthermore, in the majority of individuals with misophonia, symptoms are not associated with other comorbid psychopathological conditions, 1 indicating no signi /uniFB01 cant differences between individuals with misophonia and those without, and individuals with misophonia may differ across a wide range of emotional and behavioral reactions. A scale that measures the existence of misophonic features in nonclinical individuals through the assessment of a range of negative emotional and behavioral reactions to a wide variety of auditory and visual triggers is necessary so that individual differences and normal and abnormal levels of sensitivity to selective sounds and gestures can be identi /uniFB01 ed.

## OBJECTIVE

The goal of the study presented here was to develop and validate a new questionnaire to screen for misophonia in the general population. The newly developed scale allows for the identi /uniFB01 cation of a range of speci /uniFB01 c triggers and a range of emotional reactions from mild to extreme annoyance, distress, or disgust. In addition to the range of triggers and emotional reactions, a wide range of behavioral responses is assessed from ignoring the trigger, to

## METHODS AND RESULTS

## Ethics Statement

The study was approved by the IRB of City University of New York, Queens College (No.20200728), and informed consent was obtained from respondents over the internet.

## Study 1

The /uniFB01 rst study was designed to develop the preliminary version of the New York Misophonia Scale (NYMS) and evaluate its factor structure, internal consistency, and item quality. No speci /uniFB01 c number of factors was anticipated a priori, although the scale items were arranged in 2 sections. Part A consisted of a list of various auditory and visual triggers and associated emotional reactions, and

Part B consisted of a list of behavioral reactions to or accompanying the misophonic emotional arousal.

## Design

Questionnaire Development and Selection of Items . The researchers /uniFB01 rst decided that the instrument should be structured in 2 parts, with Part A presenting the stimuli that trigger emotional arousal in misophonia and Part B encompassing the variety of responses that an individual with misophonia might employ to cope with the emotional arousal and source. This was done to ensure that a variety of triggers; a range of emotional responses including increasing degrees of annoyance, anger, anxiety, and disgust; and a range of behavioral responses to the triggers could be assessed.

The items in the instrument were constructed from information about misophonia that has been published in scienti /uniFB01 c journals. All triggers and physical and emotional responses that have been reported as describing misophonia were included. Therefore, in addition to sensitivities to human sounds, sensitivity to repetitive movements and ambient sounds was also included.

First, all empirical research reports on misophonia published in academic journals between the

## THE NEW YORK MISOPHONIA SCALE

years 2009 and 2020 were scanned and all of the authors, including 2 seasoned faculty, a doctoral candidate, and an honors undergraduate student, contributed to generating a pool of items describing various features of misophonia as reported in scienti /uniFB01 c articles. As part of this review of the literature, the items were categorized as triggers, emotional responses, or behavioral responses, which were then evaluated by each author independently using a rating scale. All of the top-ranked items were then evaluated in terms of content validity by all of the authors together. These categories are also consistent with the recently published de /uniFB01 nition of misophonia. 1 Next, all of the existing tools for the assessment of misophonia were examined and compared against the categories created. After elimination of duplicate and synonymous entries, a total of 63 items that were rated as best by all of the authors were retained. These items included 42 that assessed misophonia triggers and 21 that assessed behavioral responses to the triggers. The triggers included both auditory and visual stimuli. The sound triggers included repetitive oral and nasal sounds as well as repetitive sounds made by humans when manipulating everyday objects like pens. The auditory triggers also included ambient sounds made by humans and commonly used appliances. The visual triggers included repetitive hand and leg movements and facial gestures. Since the emotional responses were observed to include irritation, annoyance, anger, and disgust as well as anxiety and panic, the decision was made to include options that would assess varying degrees of negative affect using terms that would capture all of these negative emotions, while at the same time allow for identifying individual differences in severity of negative affect. Furthermore, the available literature associating misophonia with anxiety suggests that anxiety plays a mediating or moderating role in misophonia rather than being a reaction to the triggers. 2,11,22,26 Therefore, the research team decided to drop the terms ' anxiety ' and ' panic ' and to present the responses arranged on a continuum of increasing unpleasantness, including the term ' distressing or disgusting ' to allow for the identi /uniFB01 cation of individuals experiencing extreme anger, anxiety, or disgust. Therefore, a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = doesn t bother ' me to 4 = disgusting/distressing was considered as the response format for the 42 triggers. The behavioral reactions were listed in no speci /uniFB01 c order and a

5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = never to 4 = always was considered as the response format to re /uniFB02 ect the frequency with which each response is demonstrated.

These items were then submitted to a pilot study in a sample of 30 participants to con /uniFB01 rm that the items were easily comprehensible. The self-report survey was administered to a group of undergraduates who volunteered to participate in response to announcements made through the learning management system. Feedback was solicited through 2 open-ended questions placed after each part of the questionnaire. Slight modi /uniFB01 cations were made in the wording of some items and 8 items from Part B which did not re /uniFB02 ect behavioral reactions or appeared to be redundant with other items were dropped. For example, the item, I shout at the individual was dropped as it was redundant with the item I become verbally aggressive . The /uniFB01 nal set of 42 triggers (Part A) and 13 behavioral reactions (Part B) were randomly ordered and represented the /uniFB01 rst version of the NYMS. Table 2 presents the complete list of the 42 trigger items and Table 3 presents the 13 behavioral response items. A 5-point Likert-type scale was selected for participants ' responses to triggers in Part A (from 0 = doesn t ' bother me to 4 = extremely annoying/disgusting/ distressing ) and for their responses to behavioral reactions in Part B (from 0 = never to 4 = always).

Participants and Procedure . A sample of 441 adult American participants (294 female, 139 male, and 8 nonbinary individuals) participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 29.6 years ( SD = 11 y). Recruitment was conducted online through social networking sites including LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit, and survey exchange sites such as Survey Swap, Survey Tandem, and Survey Circle. No personal accounts were used. Links to the survey were posted on pages relevant to data collection for research purposes. All individuals between the ages of 18 and 65 were invited to participate in the study. All data were collected through the survey presented on Google Forms. The inclusion criteria included (1) age between 18 and 65 years, and (2) /uniFB02 uency in English. Exclusion criteria included (1) being under 18 years or over 65 years of age and (2) not having completed at least 2 years of instruction in English, which was considered an indication of a lack of suf /uniFB01 cient /uniFB02 uency in English. No identifying information was

## Results

Reliability Analysis of the Preliminary Scale . The internal consistency of the items in Parts A and B were /uniFB01 rst examined to identify any items that needed to be dropped. This initial examination revealed excellent internal reliability for Part A (Cronbach α = 0.93), Part B (Cronbach α = 0.89), and for the full scale (Cronbach α = 0.94).

Factor Validity. To evaluate the factor structure of the NYMS, principal components analyses (PCAs) with oblique rotation (Promax) were conducted on each set of items. In the analysis of the Misophonia triggers, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO = 0.93) measure veri /uniFB01 ed the sampling adequacy of the analysis, which is above the acceptable limit of 0.50. Bartlett s ' test of sphericity ( χ 2 (861) = 10298, P &lt; 0.001) indicated that correlations between items were suf /uniFB01 ciently large for PCA. An initial analysis conducted on items from Part A with factor loadings of a value greater than 0.40 using eigenvalues &gt; 1 revealed 8 factors explaining a total of 61.5% of the variance. Items 17, 38, and 41 failed to load onto any factor, and only 3 items loaded on to 2 of the factors and only 1 item loaded onto factor 8. However, the Cattell s scree test suggested the presence of only 5 ' components. To verify the adequacy of a 5-component structure, a second PCA was conducted while forcing the extraction of 5 factors. The loadings obtained varied between 0.47 and 0.93, supporting the adequacy of the 5-factor solution (KMO = 0.92, Bartlett s test of sphericity, ' χ 2 (861) = 10298, P &lt; 0.001) representing 61.6% of item variance. Items 3, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 38, 39, and 40 did not load onto any factor and items 25, 34, 37, and 41 cross-loaded onto more than 1 factor, so these items were removed. Only 3 items (23, 24, and 36) loaded on to Factor 5, representing the triggers ' certain hand gestures, ' ' certain

facial expressions, ' and ' yawning. ' Being too few in number and having no clearly descriptive association, these items were eliminated, leaving a 4-factor solution. The retained items representing 60.8% of item variance and the factor loadings obtained are presented in Table 4. These suggested item groupings represent (1) mouth sounds (eating or breathing) accounting for 21.73% of the variance, (2) repetitive movements or actions (eg, leg shaking or pen clicking) accounting for 19.10% of the variance, (3) patterned sounds from objects (eg, tap dripping or clock ticking) accounting for 10.87% of the variance, and (4) vocal sounds (eg, baby crying or certain accents) accounting for 9.09% of the variance.

Next, a PCA was conducted on items from Part B of the NYMS. The KMO (0.89) indicated that the sampling was adequate and Bartlett s ' test of sphericity ( χ 2 (91) = 2317, P &lt; 0.001) con /uniFB01 rmed that the items were suitable for structure detection. Using eigenvalues &gt; 1 on items with factor loadings &gt; 0.40, 2 factors emerged. Cattel s scree ' test also suggested the presence of 2 signi /uniFB01 cant components representing 54.4% of item variance. Examination of the factor loadings (Table 4) suggested that the /uniFB01 rst 9-item factor represents aggressive behavioral reactions accounting for 34.1% of the variance while the second 4-item factor explains 20.3% of the variance and re /uniFB02 ects nonaggressive behavioral responses to the misophonia triggers.

We chose to label these 2 factors using these terms because they do not include an intention to harm and are just indicative of the displeasure the individual with misophonia experiences. All other alternatives such as assertive and nonassertive or offensive and nonoffensive, approach and avoidance, impulsive and nonimpulsive do not include the negative affect experienced or allude to anger only. An aggressive reaction is a reaction that only includes the perception of intention to harm and not necessarily harm itself. In addition, with the existence of terms like physical aggression, verbal aggression, and relational aggression, we believe that the terms that can best capture the behavioral reactions seen in misophonia are aggressive and nonaggressive reactions.

Reliability . Internal consistency and item -total correlations were calculated to evaluate the reliability of the /uniFB01 nal version of the NYMS. For the items in Part A, the internal consistency indexed by Cronbach s ' α was 0.93, while item -total correlations varied between 0.25 (item 32) and 0.69 (item 20). No increases in reliability could be obtained through the withdrawal of items. Only item 32 refrigerator humming had an item-total correlation less than the criterion of 0.35. For Part B, the Cronbach α was 0.88, and the item -total correlations ranged from 0.39 (item 12) to 0.75 (item 7). In this subscale, all items had an item-total correlation greater than the criterion value of 0.35. Finally, the internal consistency of the full NYMS was 0.94.

## Discussion

In sum, the /uniFB01 ndings from Study 1 suggest the NYMS is a reliable tool for the measurement of misophonia as it provides information about the speci /uniFB01 c triggers that a misophonic individual may /uniFB01 nd aversive, the extent of emotional arousal the triggers may induce, and the kinds of behavioral responses the individual with misophonia typically shows. With responses being rated on an ordinal scale, the severity of misophonia can also be assessed, and, if norms are developed, the scale may provide information of diagnostic value. The instrument may be simpli /uniFB01 ed by categorizing the items and collapsing each category into a single item.

Based on the factor loadings, reliability analyses (item -total correlations), descriptive statistics for the items (means and SDs), as well as face validity, 25 items from Part A (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, and 42) and all 13 items from Part B of the preliminary version were retained for the /uniFB01 nal version of the NYMS. Items in Part A represented 4 categories of triggers of emotional arousal in misophonia, mouth sounds , repetitive movements or actions , patterned sounds , and vocal sounds . Two categories of behavioral responses to the misophonic triggers re /uniFB02 ected by items in Part B are aggressive responses (9 items) and nonaggressive responses (4 items).

The items comprising the /uniFB01 nal version of the NYMS were then reordered. In Part A, all items belonging to the same category were grouped together but in Part B, items from the nonaggressive category were interspersed among the items of the aggressive category. The /uniFB01 nal version of the NYMS is shown in Supplemental Digital Content 1 (http://links.lww.com/JPP/A64).

## Study 2

The goal of Study 2 was to verify the psychometric properties of the /uniFB01 nal version of the NYMS. Therefore, in this study, a con /uniFB01 rmatory factor analysis and reliability analysis were carried out to evaluate and con /uniFB01 rm the factor structure and acceptability of the instrument. Based on the results from Study 1, we hypothesized that factor analysis of Part A would yield a 4-factor structure and that of Part B would yield a 2-factor structure, re /uniFB02 ecting the 6 components of the instrument.

## Methods

Participants and Procedure . A sample of 200 American adults (141 women, 54 men, and 5

nonbinary individuals), ranging in age from 18 to 62 years participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 25.8 years (SD = 7.48 y). Recruitment was conducted online using social media platforms. Participants completed the /uniFB01 nal 38-item version of the NYMS (25 items for Part A and 13 items for Part B), as well as a sociodemographic information questionnaire (duration of administration of the entire survey was &lt; 10 min). The items in Part A of the NYMS were ordered as follows: Mouth Sounds (items 1to 8), Repetitive Movements or Actions (items 9 to 15), Patterned Sounds of Objects (items 16 to 20), and Vocal Sounds (items 21 to 25). In Part B, the items of the nonaggressive component were inserted among the items of the aggressive component and consisted of numbers 1, 4, 7, and 10. The same 5-point (0 to 4) response format was used for both sections. Scores

for each subscale, section, and total scale were computed. This scoring procedure allows for the assessment of emotional and behavioral reactions speci /uniFB01 c to each category of triggers in addition to an assessment of overall severity level.

## Results

approximation, and the standardized root mean square residual. Examination of the comparative /uniFB01 t index (0.84) and Tucker Lewis Index (0.83), revealed a fairly good model /uniFB01 t, 27 and the root mean square error of approximation value [0.06, CI (0.062, 0.073)] represents an acceptable /uniFB01 t. Furthermore, all the estimated factor loadings were signi /uniFB01 cant ( P &lt; 0.001), suggesting a feasible structure.

Descriptive Statistics . Table 5 presents the means and SDs of the participants ' scores on the 2 parts of the NYMS, as well as on each of the instrument s ' components. The ranges of possible scores are: mouth sounds 0 to 32, repetitive movements or actions 0 to 28, patterned sounds of objects 0 to 20, vocal sounds 0 to 20, aggressive reactions 0 to 16, and nonaggressive reactions 0 to 36. Accordingly, the ranges of possible total scores are: NYMSTotal Emotional Arousal 0 to 100, for NYMS Total Reactions 0 to 52, and for NYMSTotal Misophonia 0 to 152. No sex differences emerged in any of the components of the NYMS. Therefore, the subsequent validation analyses were conducted on the whole sample.

Con rmatory Factor Analyses. /uniFB01 As a /uniFB01 nal step, con/uniFB01 rmatory factor analyses were conducted. One model aimed to con /uniFB01 rm a 6-factor solution representing all 38 items in both Parts A and B of the NYMS: (1) mouth sounds, (2) repetitive actions, (3) patterned sounds, (4) vocal sounds, (5) aggressive behavioral reactions, and (6) nonaggressive behavioral reactions.

Fit indices included the comparative /uniFB01 t index, the Tucker Lewis Index, the root mean square error of

Reliability. The Cronbach α coef /uniFB01 cient obtained for all items in Part A was 0.92, and the item -total correlations varied between 0.23 and 0.67. For Part B, Cronbach α was 0.85, and the item -total correlations varied between 0.24 and 0.63. In both Parts A and B, withdrawal of items did not result in an increase in the obtained Cronbach α . The Cronbach α coef /uniFB01 cients for the subscales of the instrument were also high (mouth sounds = 0.91, repetitive actions = 0.92, patterned sounds = 0.74, vocal sounds = 0.71, aggressive reactions = 0.85, nonaggressive reactions = 0.70). The item -total correlations were less than the criterion threshold of 0.35 only for item 21 (baby crying) in Part A and item 6 (I become physically aggressive) in Part B.

## Discussion

In sum, this second study provided overall support for the factor validity and reliability of the NYMS. A 4-factor structure for Part A and a 2-factor structure for Part B appeared to be adequate to represent the items of the NYMS. The analyses con /uniFB01 rmed that the instrument s ' items are valid and reliable for

## THE NEW YORK MISOPHONIA SCALE

evaluating emotional and behavioral responses to triggers in misophonia.

## Study 3

In this study, we evaluated the concurrent validity and reliability of the /uniFB01 nal version of the NYMS. Participants completed the NYMS along with the MQ 2 and the Dif /uniFB01 culties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Short Form (DERS-SF). 28 We hypothesized that the total scores obtained by participants on Part A (misophonic arousal) and Part B (behavioral reactions) of the NYMS would show signi /uniFB01 cant and high positive correlations with the total scores they obtained on the 2 subscales of the MQ, namely, sound sensitivity and reactions. Given that emotion regulation problems have been associated with various forms of psychopathology, we also hypothesized that the NYMS subscale and total scores would correlate positively with emotion regulation dif /uniFB01 culties.

## Methods

Participants and Procedure . A sample of 171 adult participants (119 women and 49 men, 3 nonbinary) voluntarily participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 25.3 years (SD = 9.06 y). Recruitment was conducted in a manner similar to that used in the previous studies.

Measures . In addition to the 38-item /uniFB01 nal version of the NYMS, the following 2 questionnaires were administered. The MQ 2 was used to examine the concurrent validity of the NYMS, while the DERSSF 28 was used to provide support for the convergent validity of the NYMS. Emotion regulation dif /uniFB01 culties are considered to be a transdiagnostic key factor contributing to symptoms of various forms of psychopathology. 29 Therefore, we anticipated signi /uniFB01 cant positive correlations between total scores on the DERS-SF and the NYMS.

room. Responses are indicated on a 5-point Likerttype scale from 0 = not at all true to 4 = always true for the sound sensitivity subscale and 0 = never to 4 = always for the emotional reactions scale. The questionnaire provides 2 subscale scores which can then be summed to yield a total score. The /uniFB01 nal section of the questionnaire, named the Misophonia Severity Scale, requires respondents to provide a rating of their sound sensitivity on a scale from 1 to 15, ranging from minimal to very severe , respectively. This section was not used in the current study for 2 reasons. It includes 1 question that assesses degree of impairment along with intensity of distress and is not included in calculating the total misophonia score. We wanted to compare total misophonia scores obtained on the MQ with those obtained on the NYMS. Secondly, we wanted to be able to measure distress independently of impairment as our scale does not measure impairment. Since the reactions subscale of the MQ is intended by the authors to measure emotional and behavioral reactions, we expected that subscale to correspond closely with both our subscales that are intended to measure emotional and behavioral reactions, respectively. We used only the /uniFB01 rst 2 subscales of the MQ that re /uniFB02 ect sensitivity to triggers and reactions to them and together provide a total score for misophonia. The MQ has been reported to have an internal consistency (Cronbach α ) of 0.89. 2 In the current study, internal consistency (Cronbach α ) was 0.88 for the total scale, 0.80 for the misophonia sound sensitivity subscale, and 0.85 for the misophonia emotional behaviors toward trigger sounds factor. Mean total MQ score was 19.6 (SD = 10.4, min = 0, max = 51), mean MQ sound sensitivity score was 7.99 (SD = 5.16, min = 0, max = 24), mean MQ emotional behaviors toward trigger sounds was 11.6 (SD = 6.52, min = 0, max = 34).

The MQ 2 . The MQ has 2 subscales, the misophonia symptom scale and the misophonia emotions and behaviors scale, that assess 2 factors, sound sensitivity (7 items) and emotional reactions to trigger sounds (10 items). The sound sensitivity subscale includes various categories of triggers such as eating sounds or nasal sounds, and the emotional reactions subscale includes reactions to the trigger sounds such as becoming sad, angry, or leaving the

The Dif /uniFB01 culties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Short Form (DERS-SF). 28 The DERS-SF is a shortened 18-item version of the 36-item Dif /uniFB01 culties in Emotion Regulation Scale. 30 The instrument has 6 subscales, each with 3 items: (1) lack of emotional awareness, (2) lack of emotional clarity, (3) nonacceptance of emotional responses, (4) impulse control dif /uniFB01 culties under distress, (5) limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and (6) dif /uniFB01 culties engaging in goal-directed behavior. Participants

## THE NEW YORK MISOPHONIA SCALE

respond to each item by indicating their agreement using a 5-point Likert scale with 1 = almost never to 5 = almost always . A total score is obtained by summing the subscale scores. Higher scores indicate greater dif /uniFB01 culties in regulating emotions. The DERS-SF is reported to have good reliability, with Cronbach α ranging from 0.79 to 0.90 for the subscales and 0.91 for the total score. 28 The authors reported acceptable reliability for all 6 subscales ranging from 0.78 to 0.91, with a full-scale reliability of 0.89.

The self-report measure assesses the extent to which individuals /uniFB01 nd various auditory and visual triggers aversive as well as their typical behavioral reactions to those triggers, which may be aggressive or nonaggressive.

## Results and Discussion

Concurrent Validity . The analysis revealed that all subscales, Parts A and B, and full-scale scores of the NYMS showed signi /uniFB01 cant moderate to high correlations with both the subscales and total scores of the MQ, con /uniFB01 rming that the NYMS correlates with constructs associated with the MQ. The correlation between the total NYMS score and total MQ scores was strong, indicating good concurrent validity. In addition, the total scores on Part A of the NYMS, the items that assess emotional reactions to various triggers, were strongly correlated with the subscale of the MQ that assesses sound sensitivity to various triggers. Furthermore, total scores on Part B of the NYMS, the items that capture behavioral reactions to the aversive triggers, as well as the aggressive reactions component, were strongly correlated with the subscale of the MQ that assesses emotional reactions to the various triggers of sound sensitivity. All correlations are presented in Table 6.

Convergent Validity . Pearson correlations were calculated between the subscale scores and total scores on Parts A and B of the NYMS and the total DERS-SF scores. As hypothesized, all correlation coef /uniFB01 cients were moderately strong except for the nonaggressive behavioral reactions to misophonic triggers which displayed a weak positive (0.15) but signi /uniFB01 cant correlation ( P &lt; 0.001). These correlations are displayed in Table 6.

## CONCLUSIONS

The studies described above were intended to evaluate the validity and reliability of a new instrument, the NYMS, that can be used to screen for misophonia. The results presented con /uniFB01 rm that the instrument has excellent psychometric properties.

The items developed for the NYMS correspond to descriptions of the construct in previous research, showing that the instrument has very good face validity. The factor analyses, both principal component and con /uniFB01 rmatory, supported the factor validity of the NYMS. Part A of the inventory, which captures the triggers that elicit emotional arousal experienced in misophonia, is represented by a 4-dimension structure, while Part B, which comprises the behavioral reactions evoked by the triggers, re /uniFB02 ects 2 components. Therefore, the instrument assesses a range of common triggers of misophonia along with the corresponding degrees of emotional arousal and varying behavioral responses they elicit.

The results also con /uniFB01 rmed that the instrument has excellent internal reliability. The concurrent validity and convergent validity of the NYMS were also adequate. The patterns of correlation between the NYMS subscale and total scale scores and the MQ subscale and total scale scores con /uniFB01 rm that the NYMS is an adequate measure of misophonia. The NYMS total score also correlated well with a widely used measure of emotion regulation dif /uniFB01 culties, an indication of acceptable convergent validity.

Although the development of the NYMS represented an attempt to address the limitations of previous measures of misophonia, it has 2 limitations that must be addressed in future revisions of the scale. The /uniFB01 rst is that the scale has been developed for adults; therefore, since misophonia begins in childhood, validation of the scale using children is essential. Secondly, although emotional and behavioral reactions to various misophonic triggers are assessed by the NYMS, assessing each of the negative emotions separately should be considered for future revisions of the scale.

With the publication of a consensus regarding the de /uniFB01 nition of misophonia, 1 the NYMS has potential for use in clinical settings. The scale can be used to detect misophonia as a condition not associated with any other psychopathology. Contingent on the availability of speci /uniFB01 c diagnostic criteria for misophonia, future research can demonstrate if the NYMS can be used in a clinical population for the diagnosis and assessment of severity of misophonic

reactions. The items and psychometric characteristics of the instrument can also be validated in nonEnglish speaking populations, albeit with some linguistic and cultural modi /uniFB01 cations. Similarly, as discussed above, the instrument should also be validated in children and adolescents. Although the studies presented here involved a fairly large population, the predominance of females in the samples limits the generalization of the /uniFB01 ndings. The instrument will also bene /uniFB01 t from future studies that focus on assessing its convergent and divergent validity. Studies are also needed to investigate the test-retest reliability and predictive validity of the NYMS. Also, although the scale provides a total score indicating the level of emotional distress experienced by the individual and, therefore, the likely severity of misophonia, the validity of the scale for assessing severity of misophonia may be strengthened through a comparison with an assessment of functional impairment. The scale does not assess functional impairment as it is intended to be used as a screening tool, and currently, since misophonia is not yet recognized as a psychiatric disorder, it is not known whether individuals experiencing misophonia also experience functional impairment. Future research in this regard is warranted. Finally, the criterion validity of the scale must be tested with a clinical sample. We do af /uniFB01 rm that, until misophonia is recognized as a psychological disorder with formal diagnostic criteria, such research may not be possible. However, the scale can be used with individuals diagnosed with other psychological disorders who may selfreport misophonic distress and reactions.

In sum, although formal criteria for the diagnosis of misophonia are yet to be established, the NYMS can be a useful instrument for determining both speci /uniFB01 c triggers and emotional and behavioral reactions in misophonia. The total score can be used to indicate severity of misophonia and subscale scores can be used to indicate the severity of emotional and behavioral reactions to misophonic triggers, respectively. The quick administration of the instrument makes it a valuable tool for use in both clinical and research settings to screen for misophonia and for assessing the effects of interventional strategies on changes in emotional and behavioral reactions to misophonic triggers. The

## THE NEW YORK MISOPHONIA SCALE

scale is an improvement over the existing measures of misophonia because (1) it assesses a variety of speci /uniFB01 c triggers as well as a range of speci /uniFB01 c emotional and behavioral reactions, (2) it is based entirely on the descriptive features of misophonia and not on any speci /uniFB01 c theory about misophonia, (3) it can be used to assess misophonia at various levels, mild to severe, (4) it can be used with the general population to screen for misophonia, (5) it is short and provides a quick but detailed assessment, and (6) it has sound psychometric properties. Overall, the scale allows for the valid and reliable determination of the speci /uniFB01 c nature and severity of misophonic reactions in a very short time.
