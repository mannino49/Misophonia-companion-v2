Highlights:  
Auditory brainstem response findings were compared between controls and misophonia  
Individuals with misophonia showed shorter absolute latencies at  11.1/s stimulus rate  
It shows altered sub -cortical auditory processing in individuals with misophonia  
 
ABSTRACT  
Background and Aim:  Misophonia is a condition characterized by a reduced tolerance to certain sounds or the 
stimuli linked to those sounds. Our study aims to investigate the auditory brainstem functioning using 
electrophysiological measures in normal -hearing individuals with and without misophonia.  
Methods:  Thirty participants aged between 18 and 30 years were recruited. They were divided into two primary 
groups: fifteen individuals diagnosed with misophonia and fifteen controls. The selection of participants with 
misophonia w as based on the diagnostic criteria by Schröder et al. and the MisoQuest  questionnaire , Auditory 
brainstem response (ABR) was recorded from all the individuals at lower (11.1/s) and higher stimulus rates 
(90.1/s).  
Results: On analy sing the data, individuals with misophonia showed significantly shorter absolute latencies of 
ABR waves III and V at 11.1/s. Also, there was no significant difference in the absolute amplitude of ABR waves 
at 11.1/s and 90.1/s  between the individuals with and without mis ophonia.  
Conclusion:  This study indicates that the shorter absolute latencies of ABR waves III and V in individuals in 
misophonia could be attributed to hyperactivity at the sub -cortical pathway regions compared to the control group.

Introduction  
The term "misophonia" originates from the Greek words "misos," meaning hatred, and "phónè," meaning sound.  
Over time, the term misophonia has become the predominant term to describe this c ondition, as evidenced by 
recent studies [1,2].  This term encapsulates the core characteristic of the phenomenon, referring to the intense 
adverse emotional and physiological reactions associated with decreased sound tolerance (DST) [ 3,4]. 
Misophonia is a  relatively recent concept in audiology and psychology, having gained recognition only in the 
past few decades. The hallmark of misophonia is the presence of extreme adverse responses to specific auditory

stimuli, referred to as "triggers." These triggers can provoke many emotional and physiological reactions [ 5]. 
These triggers may involve specific auditory, visual, or audiovisual stimuli [ 1,5]. Human -produced sounds, such 
as breathing, chewing, lip -smacking, and swallowing, can serve as unpleasant auditory triggers . Repetitive 
movements such as leg shaking or the appearance of lips moving while chewing can be visual triggers  [1,5]. 
Additionally, sounds unrelated to the human body, like clicking, rustling, and typing, can also function as auditory 
triggers [ 1,5]. Misophonia is a condition that draws from audiology, neurology, and psychiatry, yet lacks clearly  
defined diagnostic criteria and standardized assessment protocols across these fields.  [4,5]. Although the 
condition has garnered increasing attention in recent years, the scientific community has yet to reach a consensus 
on the most effective methods for diagnosis and treatment [6]. Studies examining the prevalence of misophonia 
have been conducted in diverse populations across various countri es, including students and the general public. 
In Western nations, reported prevalence rates range from 4.6% to 54% [7,8], while in India, the prevalence is 
estimated to range from 15% to 34% [9  -13].  
While the focus of audiological assessment in individu als with misophonia has traditionally been subjective tests, 
a few studies have explored objective testing using auditory evoked potentials [14 -20]. A study by Kim et al . 
reported an enhanced wave I ABR amplitude in individuals with misophonia and a prolonged wave V latency 
compared to individuals with hyperacusis and control subjects [2 0]. In contrast, Aryal and Prabhu found no 
statistically significant differences betwee n individuals with misophonia and other groups in ABR amplitudes, 
absolute latencies, or interpeak latencies . The result of the ir study suggests that individuals with misophonia may 
exhibit normal neuronal synchrony up to the brainstem regions [2 1]. Howeve r, Aryal and Prabhu included only 
individuals with mild to moderate misophonia, leaving the potential for variations in brainstem processing 
unexamined in individuals with more severe forms of the disorder [2 1].  
Similarly, Kim et al did not report the sev erity of misophonia in their sample [2 0]. Consequently, it is possible 
that variations in brainstem processing could be associated with the severity of misophonia, with individuals 
exhibiting more severe symptoms potentially demonstrating abnormal processi ng at the brainstem level. 
Therefore, it can be hypothesized  that neural processing up to the brainstem level could be altered among 
individuals with misophonia.  This altered neural activity may contribute to the heightened sensitivity to sound 
stimuli obs erved in more severe cases of misophonia, potentially resulting from impaired processing of auditory 
signals at the brainstem [2 2,23]. Considering the disparities in findings from previous studies, further research 
exploring the auditory brainstem function ing in individuals with misophonia having higher severity is warranted.  
Electrophysiological measures, such as ABR testing, could provide more definitive insights into the neural 
mechanisms underlying this condition. Hence, the  study aims to assess audito ry brainstem functioning using 
electrophysiological measures in individuals with and without misophonia. Specifically, the objective is to 
compare the ABR parameters, including latencies and amplitudes, elicited by clicks at stimulus rates of 11.1/s 
and 90 .1/s between individuals with misophonia and a control group without the condition.  
 
Methods  
 
Study Participants  
A standard group comparison with purposive sampling was applied in this study. A total of thirty participants 
aged between 18 and 30 years were  recruited . The participants were divided into two primary groups: fifteen 
individuals  diagnosed with misophonia  (12 females , 3 males)  (mean age: 23 .25 years, SD: 2. 89 years)  and fifteen 
controls  (9 females , 6 males ) (mean age: 23 years, SD: 2. 80 years) . In the misophonia group, ten individuals had 
a moderate degree of misophonia, and five had severe misophonia. The selection of participants with misophonia 
was based on the diagnostic criteria by Schröder et al. [24] and the MisoQuest  questionnaire , as des cribed by 
Siepsiak et al. [ 25]. The severity of misophonia was assessed using the Revised Amsterdam Misophonia Scale 
(RAMISO -S) [26]. RAMISO -S scores were classified as follows: 0–10 indicating no misophonia (subclinical), 
11–20 indicating mild misophonia,  21–30 indicating moderate misophonia, and 31–40 indicating severe 
misophonia. Individuals with scores ≤ 10 were considered to have no misophonia, while those scoring 21 or higher 
were included in the study.  
Inclusion criteria were as follows: participants with no significant history of otological disorders, prolonged or 
frequent exposure to loud noise, alcohol consumption, smoking, ototoxic drug use, a family history of hearing 
loss, or any other medical conditions that might influence the study outcomes. A dditionally, participants with

tinnitus were excluded through the administration of the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), while those with 
hyperacusis were excluded using the Modified Khalfa Hyperacusis Questionnaire (MKHQ) [27, 28].  
 
Procedures  
Prior to  audiological evaluations, a comprehensive case history was collected from each participant to screen for 
any otological issues, hearing impairments, or histories of noise exposure. The participants were first evaluated 
through otoscopy to check for outer ear and ear canal anomalies. This was followed by standard pure tone 
audiometry  (PTA) , immittance evaluation  (IE), and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) to ensure 
normal hearing sensitivity, middle ear function, and outer hair cells functio ning, respectively. All the testing 
procedures were carried out in a randomized order for both ears.  
Pure tone audiometry   
Air conduction thresholds were measured using a calibrated two -channel clinical audiometer, the Inventis Piano 
(Inventis Padova, Italy), with Telephonics Dynamic Headphones 39 earphones fitted with MX -41/AR supra -aural 
ear cushions. Bone conduction thresholds were obtained using the Radio Ear B -71 bone vibrator. The criterion 
for normal hearing sensitivity was defined as ≤ 15 dB HL a t octave frequencies from 250 Hz to 8000  Hz for air 
conduction and 250 Hz to 4000 Hz for bone conduction, based on the modified Hughson -Westlake procedure 
[29].  
Immittance evaluation   
An immittance evaluation was performed using a Grason -Stadler Tympstar Pro immittance meter to assess 
middle ear function (Grason Stadler, Inc., MN, USA). Tympanometry was administered with a probe tone of 226 
Hz at 85 dB SPL, and acoustic reflexes were me asured at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz frequencies. All 
participants exhibited 'A' type tympanograms with present acoustic reflexes at 500 and 1000 Hz, as reported in 
previous studies [30].  
Distortion product otoacoustic emissions  
DPOAEs were measured usi ng the Otodynamics DP Echoport otoacoustic emission instrument (ILO292 -USB -
II, V6), with measurements at octave and mid -octave frequencies between 1 kHz and 6 kHz. A signal -to-noise 
ratio (SNR) of +6 dB at three consecutive frequencies indicated the presen ce of otoacoustic emissions [31]. All 
participants met the inclusion criteria and underwent Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) testing.  
Testing environment  
All procedures were conducted in an acoustically treated room, adhering to the noise level standards  specified by 
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Acoustical Society of America  (ASA) ANSI/ASA S3.1 -1999 
[32].  
 
Auditory brainstem response  
ABR was recorded using the calibrated four -channel SmartEP Intelligent Hearing Systems (IHS, Miami, FL). 
Electrodes were placed according to the 10–20 International System: one positive electrode at Fz (high forehead), 
two negative electrodes at the right (M2) and left (M1) mastoid regions, and a ground electrode at FPz (lower 
forehead) [33]. Impedance l evels were maintained below 5 kΩ for absolute impedance and 2 kΩ for inter -
electrode impedance [34,35].  In this study, stimuli were presented at a single intensity level of 80 dB nHL, as this 
higher intensity, coupled with a higher  stimulation rate  (90.1/s ), helps detect retrocochlear lesions, including 
abnormalities in the auditory nerve and brainstem structures [ 34].  Before the ABR testing, the participants were 
provided the test stimuli (clicks) at 80 dB nHL and ensured that the intensity was tolerable and did not cause any 
discomfort for all the participants . Two repetitions of 1500 sweeps were recorded for each rate for reliable 
recordings  [34,35].  A binaural ABR was recorded  for each participant . Stimulus and acquisition parameters are 
provided in Table 1.  
 
Statistical Analyses  
The statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 26, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The 
data distribution was assessed using the Shapiro –Wilk test of normality, which revealed a non -normal distribution 
(p < 0.05). Consequently, non -parametric tests were employed to further analyze the data.    
 
Results  
Auditory brainstem response findings

The absolute latency, inter -peak latencies, and amplitudes of ABR waves I, III, and V were measured at 11.1/sec, 
and the absolute latency and amplitude of wave V were measured at 90.1/s. These parameters were recorded and 
tabulated for subsequent statistic al analysis. ABR waves I and III were absent at a stimulus rate of 90.1/s in most 
participants; therefore , these parameters were excluded from the analysis .  
Comparison of Absolute latency in individuals with and without misophonia  
The results of the absolute latencies were subjected to a descriptive statistical analysis. Results show ed that 
absolute latencies of waves III and V arrived  earlier at 11.1/s in individuals with misophonia than in control 
groups. The absolute latencies of  wave I at 11.1/s and wave V at 90.1/s were similar between the two groups.  
The median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum of absolute latencies of all the ABR waves at 11.1/s are 
represented in Figure 1.  
The mean, standard deviation (SD), and r esults of the Mann –Whitney U test for absolute latencies (ms) of all the 
waves of  ABR are provided in Table 2.  
Furthermore, Mann -Whitney U tests were conducted to see the differences between the two groups. Mann - 
Whitney U test results showed a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.05) in ABR parameters, such as the 
absolute latencies of wave III and V at 11.1/s for individuals with misophonia compared to the control group. 
However, the results showed no statistically significant difference  (p > 0.05) in absolute latencies of wave I at 
11.1/s and wave V at 90.1/s.  
The grand averaged waveforms of recorded ABR for control and misophonia group at 11.1/s are shown in Figure 
2. 
Comparison of Absolute amplitude in individuals with and without mis ophonia  
The results of the absolute amplitude were subjected to a descriptive statistical analysis. Results show ed that the 
two groups' absolute amplitude of waves I, III, and V at 11.1/s and the absolute amplitude of wave V at 90.1/s 
were similar.  
The median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum of absolute amplitude of all the waves of ABR at 11.1/s are 
represented in Figure 3.  
The mean , standard deviation , and r esults of the Mann –Whitney U test for absolute amplitude ( µV) of all the 
waves of ABR are provided in Table 3.  
Furthermore, Mann -Whitney U tests were conducted to see the differences between the two groups. Mann - 
Whitney U test results showed no statistically significant difference ( p > 0.05) in the absolute amplitude of waves 
I, III, and V at 11.1/s and wave V at 90.1/s between the two groups.  
Comparison of Interpeak latency in individuals with and without misophonia  
The results of the interpeak latencies were subjected to a descript ive statistical analysis. Results show ed that 
interpeak latencies of wave I – V were  earlier  at 11.1/s in individuals with misophonia compared to control 
groups. The interpeak latencies of wave I -III and III -V at 11.1/s were similar between the two groups.  
The median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum of interpeak latencies (ms) of all the ABR waves at 11.1/s are 
represented in Figure 4.  
The mean , standard deviation , and r esults of the Mann –Whitney U test for interpeak latencies (ms) of all the 
waves of ABR are provided in Table 4.  
Furthermore, Mann -Whitney U tests were conducted to see the differences between the two groups. Mann - 
Whitney U test results showed significantly  earlier interpeak latency I -V (p < 0.05) and no statistically significant 
difference ( p > 0.05) in the interpeak latencies of wave I – III and III -V at 11.1/s between the two groups.  
 
Discussion  
The current study explored the auditory brainstem response in individuals with and without m isophonia.  The 
results indicate that individuals with misophonia exhibited earlier absolute latencies for waves III and V at a 
stimul us rate of 11.1/s . In general, latency denotes the timing of responses from neural sources [34,35].  Wave 
III and IV originate at the cochlear nucleus and superior olivary complex. Wave V is majorly generated in the 
lateral lemniscus and inferior colliculus [34, 35]. Hence, the results of our study suggest a possible hyperactivity 
at these sub -cortical centers in individuals with misophonia. The absolute latencies of wave III and V at 80 dB 
nHL and 11.1/s stimulus rate  could be a good indicator of the unique trend of ABR in those with misophonia. 
Also, these results support our hypothesis that misophonia is associated with altered sub -cortical auditory 
processing. However, the similar latencies for wave I at 11.1/s sugg est that the peripheral auditory system, which 
includes the cochlea and the auditory nerve, may not be significantly different between the two groups.

Specifically, the  earlier  latencies of these waves indicate the heightened response to the auditory stim uli in 
individuals with misophonia.  It is speculated  that the neural hyperactivity at the sub -cortical auditory regions 
such as the cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex, lateral lemniscus, and inferior colliculus  contributes to 
the heightened respons e. These findings align with the previous study  by Aryal and Prabhu which  reported that 
the latency of P1 and N1 peaks of cortical auditory evoked potentials are significantly shortened in individuals 
with misophonia . They stated that there could be a possible existence of altered auditory processing within 
specific brain regions that generate these peaks among individuals with misophonia [22]. Similarly, our study has 
also shown shortened latencies of ABR, which sugge sts heightened neural activity at the subcortical level, too, 
in individuals with misophonia.  
Interestingly, in the present study, no significant difference was observed in the absolute amplitude at lower and 
higher stimulus rates between the two groups, which underscores that while the timing of the neural response 
(latency) to sound is altered, the number of neurons firing  (amplitude)  response remains unaltered in individuals 
with misophonia. Similarly, a study by Aryal and Prabhu , also reported no signi ficant difference in the amplitude 
of ABR  that may be attributed to the inclusion of individuals with milder severity [21].   In contrast, Kim et al 
found that individuals with misophonia showed enhanced wave I amplitude compared to the control group [20]. 
Furthermore, the earlier interpeak latency of  wave I -V in individuals with misophonia further supports the idea 
of a rapid neural response in this group, suggesting heightened activity of auditory signals through the brainstem. 
This is consistent with our  study hypothesis that individuals with misophonia might process auditory stimuli more 
rapidly, contributing to the hypersensitivity characteristic of the condition. Thus, the results of our study provide 
objective evidence for hyperactivity at the sub -cortical level, resulting in faster conduction times as evidenced in 
ABR.  
Consequently, this study provides valuable insights into the subtle differences in the auditory brainstem response 
findings among individuals with misophonia. Thus, the earlier arrival  of auditory brainstem response waves could 
be a potential indicator in identifying misophonia, providing an electrophysiological index to adjunct clinical 
assessments and enhancing our understanding of this condition. The study findings could help clinici ans and 
researchers pave the way for tailored therapeutic interventions for individuals with misophonia . 
 
Conclusions  
The current study attempted to assess the auditory brainstem functioning of individuals with misophonia. The 
present study utilized electrophysiological measures and revealed that individuals with misophonia may exhibit 
heightened activity in the areas inv olved in generating Auditory Brainstem Response  (ABR ) waves III and V.  
Although ABR is sensitive to brainstem alterations, it is essential to note that auditory cortical and behavioral 
measures would supplement the ABR findings and provide a comprehensive  understanding of the 
neurophysiological basis of misophonia.  In our study, we recorded binaural ABR, suggesting that future research 
could explore and compare both monoaural and binaural ABR in individuals with misophonia. Additionally, the 
results need t o be replicated in larger samples before considering ABR as a potential biomarker in individuals 
with higher severity of misophonia .
