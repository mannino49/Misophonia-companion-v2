 Misophonia  is characterized by a lowered tolerance coupled with a defensive reaction to 
socially-related auditory stimuli. Given the current gap in standardized diagnosis and treatment 
methods, there is a critical need to understand the processes underlying aversive auditory 
processing in misophonia. To address this, we used EEG to measure event -related potentials 
(ERPs), analyzing N1 (the registration of sensory input  allocation of pre -attention) and P2 (the 
classification of stimuli of pre -attention) amplitudes. We examined whether misophonia triggers 
paired with either mechanical vs. social vis ual cues elicit attention allocation and/or habituation 
effects in comparison to autism spectrum disorder, and typically developing adults. Participants 
with misophonia displayed greater registration of sensory input  (N1) and decreased classification 
of stimuli (P2) to first social cues. For the second cues, there was no significant display of context 
specific habituation to second cues despite source differences. These results suggest that adults 
with misophonia have an exaggerated tendency to focus on soc ial cues, while reducing attention 
towards the social cues when firstly registering sensory  inputs, possibly as a coping mechanism.

v Preface  
 
 This thesis allowed me to get in touch with the humanity of what research is all about; 
learning what goes beyond  the requirements of a  master’s degree . This opportunity allowed me 
to build relationships and lend a shoulder to lean on to those who had no one who believed in 
their truth s. As part of my research, I had the privilege of meeting people who suffered from 
misophonia and allowed themselves to be open about their struggles to help others who had 
suffered the same way. Spending over a year listening to their stories motivated my ef forts 
toward finding an answer for them. As a result of the present study, we can open more 
discussions and questions about how to help people with Misophonia. Hopefully, one day, 
misophonia will finally be understood enough to dismantle any hesitation in believing its 
beholder.

1 Chapter 1: Introduction  
 
Misophonia  is a disorder that involves reduced tolerance to specific sounds made by 
other people, resulting in an aversive response that may be out of proportion to the presence of 
the irritant stimulus (Brout et al., 2018). Auditory stimuli may vary, including snif fing, chewing, 
nasal/accenting, and repetitive sounds not exclusively produced by the body (Erfanian, 2018). 
The affected individual's responses of disgust, irritation, rage, or anxiety are typically first 
observed in childhood or early adolescence (Schröd er et al., 2013). An elevated physiological 
response and emotional reactivity in individuals with misophonia can lead to debilitating 
impairments to daily tasks. Avoidant and maladaptive behaviors can interfere with their 
everyday function, causing impairm ents to their well -being and interpersonal relationships as 
well (Brout et al., 2018).  
Despite the rise in research toward understanding misophonia, there is still a lack of 
characterization of its causes, mechanisms, severity, and comorbidities (Brout et al., 2018). An 
estimated 20% of individuals may experience a form of misophonia (Wu et al., 2014), with 6% 
experiencing severe misophonia (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort., 2021). Misophonia research 
has been conducted for a little over 20 years, but the upt ake has been slow, with the literature on 
misophonia -specific studies not surpassing 100 peer -reviewed papers as of 2022 (Ferrer -Torres 
& Giménez -Llort., 2022). Since misophonia lacks a classification and etiology, it might have 
comorbid hearing pathologie s or mental disorders, resulting in alternative diagnoses in many 
misophonia patients (Potgieter et al., 2019). With no established DSM -5 or ICD criteria for 
misophonia, there is difficulty in providing clinically established diagnosis and treatment 
method s for this disorder. Standardized comparison between study cohorts is impossible without 
a fundamental consensus on evaluating misophonia. No psychometrically validated measurement

2 tools can rigorously assess the effectiveness of varying treatment methods (Edelstein et al., 
2013).  
Through the Delphi process, a coalition of experts has redefined the concept of 
misophonia by assessing the etiology of reactions to misophoni a triggers, influences on 
reactions, functional impairments, and their relationship to o ther disorders and conditions 
(Swedo et al., 2022). Current research has identified that misophonia is not a hearing disorder, 
since there is no relationship between reactivity and hearing thresholds prevalent among 
individuals with normal hearing, hard -of-hearing, or auditory pathologies (Taylor, 2017). 
Misophonia can develop without any peripheral or central auditory pathologies, and due to the 
specificity of the misophoni a triggers, it is unlikely to arise from alterations in the auditory 
system (Møller. , 2011). Furthermore, misophonia can present with neurological or psychiatric 
conditions or disorders, with high co -occurrence with anxiety, post -traumatic stress disorder, 
obsessive -compulsive disorders, and autism spectrum disorders (Taylor, 2017).  
Due to the social nature of misophonia triggers, studies have suggested that social 
impairments play an essential role in aversive responses to misophonia triggers  (Taylor et al., 
2014). The levels of social dysfunction and sensory processing alterations migh t interact to affect 
the levels of misophonia severity. Understanding the fundamentals of social processing allows us 
to identify how neutral auditory cues are processed compared to misophoni a triggers.  
Within our everyday lives, the sounds of honking cars, someone chewing their gum next 
to us, or someone slurping their drink can firstly be noticed but eventually filtered out of our 
attention to focus on the task at hand. The process that allows the filtering of auditory stimuli is 
attention all ocation. This essential cognitive processing mechanism allows individuals to face 
conflicting stimuli input by generating, maintaining, and adjusting a set of goal -directed

3 processing tactics. Attention allocation reflects top -down processing and regulator y control, as 
they interact with various stimuli (Appelbaum et al., 2012). In misophonia, we suspect an 
impairment in attention allocation reduces the filtering of auditory cues, turning what would be 
considered a standard auditory stimulus into an aversiv e auditory cue that cannot be ignored.  
Through first attention allocation, a habituation response developed a fundamental form 
of learning manifested by decreased neuronal responses to repeated sensory stimulations 
(Mutschler et al., 2010). Auditory habit uation allows people to tune out non -essential, repetitive 
auditory stimuli and focus on sounds that demand attention. It can occur regularly in our 
everyday lives without our conscious awareness, like the clicking of a ticking clock. At the 
behavioral lev el, habituation can elicit reduced emotional reactions to repeated affective stimuli, 
a process that may be particularly impacted in misophonia.  
This thesis examines attention allocation vs. auditory habituation in misophonia and 
whether these processes v ary as a function of context (when the sound source is mechanical or 
social). We examined sensory processing using event -related potentials (ERP) recorded with 
electroencephalography (EEG) in participants with misophonia, compared to adults with autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD) as a clinical control and typically -developed (TD) adults as a 
comparative baseline representation of normative auditory processing.

4 Chapter 2: Misophonia Severity Assessments  
Participant recruitment  
Participants between the age s of 18 and 54 provided written informed consent, as 
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The 
author asserts that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of 
the releva nt national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the 
Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008.  
Participants included 16 individuals with moderate to severe misophonia symptoms 
(Mean age = 31.3 years, SD = 7.9), 18 with ASD (Mean = 25.6 years, SD = 6.4), and 14 TD 
controls (Mean = 28.2 years, SD = 8.4). A one -way ANOVA did not identify any significan t 
differences among groups in terms of age [F(2, 45) = 2.36, p = 0.07], and a Chi -Square analysis 
confirmed no significant sex differences among groups [X 2 (2, N = 48) = 2.29, p = 0.32] (Table 
1). Moderate symptoms of misophonia were defined as participan ts receiving the following 
minimum misophonia scores on at least two of four surveys: Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ): 
x>7 (MQ; Wu et al., 2014), Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (AMISOS): x>9 (Schröder et al., 
2013), Amsterdam Misophonia Scale Revised (AMISOS -R): x>23 (AMISOS -R; Jager et al., 
2020), and Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ): x>21 (MAQ; Johnson, 2014). ASD 
and TD participants required a misophonia survey score below the threshold of moderate 
severity. ASD diagnoses were confirmed by the Autism  Diagnostic Observation Schedule - 2 
(ADOS -2, Lord et al., 2012), administered by a trained and research -reliable clinician, in 
conjunction with developmental history and clinical judgment applied to DSM -5 criteria. 
Neurotypical controls had no psychiatric  disorders and no first -degree relatives with ASD.

5 We recruited misophonia participants through online advertisements on the misophonia 
support group pages (Reddit and Facebook) and online research participant recruitment sites. 
ASD and TD participants wer e recruited via recruitment websites, campus flyers, and online 
forums. Potential participants opted to participate in the study based on a brief description 
informing them that they would need to complete surveys assessing their mood, personality, and 
sensitivity to certain sounds, with a compensation of $20.00 per hour. Clinical staff and research 
specialists conducted psychological assessments and EEG sessions.

We administered four misophonia surveys to assess misophoni a traits among the three 
subject groups. A commonly used method of measuring misophonia severity is the Misophonia 
Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014), a self -report measurement consisting of three subscales in 
a Likert -type scale: (a) frequency of specific  trigger sounds, (b) frequency of certain emotions 
and behavioral responses to trigger sounds, and (c) overall perception of the severity of sound 
sensitivities. A score above 6 has been proposed to indicate clinically significant symptoms 
(MQ; Wu et al., 2014). Within our study we only assessed one question of the MQ,  severity of 
sound sensitivity from 1 (minimal) to 15 (very severe). Severity of misophonia symptoms was

7 classified as follows: Minimal (1 -3), Mild (4 -6), Moderate (7 -9), Severe sound sensiti vities (10 -
12), Very severe sound sensitivities (13 -15).  
Participants also completed the Amsterdam misophonia Scale (A -MISO -S), a 7 -item self -
report measure assessing the severity of misophonia symptoms, including preoccupation with 
trigger sounds, negat ive emotional responses to trigger sounds, lack of thought control, and 
interference with daily life (Schröder et al., 2013). The first six questions are scored on a 5 -point 
Likert scale (0 -4), whereas the last ask for free responses. The AMISOS is an adap ted version of 
the Yale -Brown Obsessive -Compulsive Scale (Goodman et al., 1989). Total scores range from 0 -
24, with score categories of 0 -4 (subclinical), 5 -9 (mild), 10 -14 (moderate), 15 -19 (severe), and 
20-24 (extreme; Schröder et al., 2013).  
We also us ed an updated version of the AMISOS called the Amsterdam Misophonia 
Scale -Revised (AMISOS -R; Jager et al., 2020); it now incorporates physical movements of 
others as misophoni a stimuli.  
Lastly, the Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ; Johnson, 2014),  is a 21 -item 
measure that assesses impact of misophonia. In one study (Dozier, 2015), the sum of the 
individual's score in the MAQ was used to rate the severity of symptoms as mild (1 –21), 
moderate (22 –42), or severe (43 –63); a Likert -type scale of 0 (not  at all/least) to 3 (all the 
time/most) is used to score the items.  
In order to compare misophonia to other psychiatric conditions, participants also 
completed the Broad Autism Spectrum Questionnaire (BAPQ; Hurley et al., 2007), Fear of 
Negative Evaluatio n (Leary,1983), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS Avoidance questions; 
Liebowitz, 1987), State -Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI Trait questions; Skapinakis, 2014), Zung 
Self Rating Depression Scale (SDS; Zung, 1986), Obsessive -Compulsive Inventory -Revised

8 (OCI -R; Foa et al., 2002), Avoidant Personality Disorder Impairment Scale (AvPD -IS; Liggett et 
al., 2017), and Lehman's Social Relations Subjective & Objective Score (Lehman, A.F. 1983) 
(Table 1 ). Correlation analysis between all additional psychiatric sur veys and misophonia 
surveys were assessed to identify the presence of comorbidities (Table 2) . 
We conducted a series of IQ tests suitable for the age and developmental level of the 
misophonia and ASD and TD groups, including the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence 
– Second Edition (Wechsler, 2011). Only 16 out of 18 ASD participants were able to complete 
the IQ assessment.

9 Chapter 3: Attention Allocation & Auditory Habituation  
A prior knowledge base of obj ects and events must be considered when deciding how to 
allocate sensory, motor, or mental resources. Additionally, auditory habituation refers to a 
gradual decline in neuronal response to successive auditory stimulations. Despite the success of 
EEG in mea suring auditory ERPs, attention allocation and habituation properties remain 
unknown in participants with misophonia. A comparison of misophonia participants' attention 
allocation and auditory habituation enabled us to determine whether social vs. mechanic al visual 
sources led to distinct ERP responses to misophonia triggers and whether source differences 
influence neuronal desensitization.  
Previous studies of N1 and P2 assessments identified N1 as a potential filtering 
mechanism that triggers the activation of allocation of attention, while P2 sensory gating 
involves the early allocation of attention (Näätänen, 1992, pp. 113 –135; Näätänen & Picton, 
1987). Previous studies have identified a decrease in N1 magnitude with repeated auditory 
stimuli (Pa iva et al., 2016). Similarly, P2 showed habituation, and sensory gating properties have 
been observed for consecutive stimuli with short and constant inter -stimulus intervals (Paiva et 
al., 2016). Therefore, we hypothesize misophonia participants to evince  greater negative N1 and 
positive P2 peaks than participants with ASD or TD to the first sound stimuli, presumably due to 
increased registration of sensory input  and pre -attentive classification of stimuli. Our studies 
should indicate a decreased habituati on response to social cues in misophonia compared to ASD 
and TD.

10 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
Figure 1. Misophonia Visual -Auditory Cue habituation Task  
(A) Source differentiation processing task   (B) Post-task source differentiation ratings  
 
Participants completed a 9 -min visual -auditory habituation task during a high -density EEG while 
seated in a chair facing a desktop computer, with an approximate 2 -4 min post -rating task with a 
Chronos Response Box . We used E -Prime 2.0 to implement the experiment. The experiment 
consisted of a total of 4 blocks containing 32 trials per block, with eight distinct social visual 
cues (e.g., whistling man) and eight distinct mechanical visual cues (e.g., whistling teapo t). All

11 visual cues were validated in a prior study with Misophonia participants rating the 
unpleasantness plausibility  of the auditory cues paired with the visual stimuli (Banker, 2022). 
Each distinct visual cue was presented  twice per block in a randomized order for 2000 ms; the

12 misophoni a auditory stimuli were identical for pairs of social and mechani cal images and 
matched both visual cues (e.g., whistling sound) in a pseudorandomized order. Auditory cues 
were presented twice per distinct visual cue. The auditory cues were presented 1000ms after the 
visual cues for 500ms each with a 500ms buffer in bet ween each auditory presentation (Figure  
1A). After completing the task, participants rated the image paired with the same auditory stimuli 
from the task on a 1 -5 scale (1 = Pleasant to 5 = Unpleasant) (Figure 1B).  
We acquired EEG data using NetStation Sof tware Version 5.4.2 and a Philips HydroGel 
Geodesic sensor with 128 channels (Figure 2A). Original EEG files were processed in a 0.50 - 
55.00 Hz Bandpass filter and then segmented into the four distinct cue segments (M1: First 
mechanical visual cue, M2: Se cond mechanical visual cue, S1: First social visual cue, and S2: 
Second social visual cue) of 600 ms epochs from -100ms to 500ms and time -locked to the onset 
of each tone during pre -processing (Figure 2B). Each recorded segment was manually inspected 
for the removal of motor movement (eyeblinks, eyebrow shifts, head tilt). The processing steps 
involve classifying and replacing outlier channels with interpolated values in the continuous 
data, removing outlier epochs from single participant data, and removing  outlier components. 
Data were averaged separately for each auditory cue in the trial's sequence, and the baseline was 
corrected using a 100 ms pre -stimulus interval. Recordings were included in final analyses if 
they included a minimum of 10 viable segmen ts per cue, with viability meaning a maximum of 
25 electrode channels that were removed per segment for >80% viability (Figure 2A). We 
performed repeated measures ANOVAs and t -tests to compare component amplitude by the 
group across social and mechanical s timuli and repetitions. RStudio was used for ERP analysis 
and statistical significance.

13 N1 & P2 amplitudes were extracted over electrode Cz at the vertex of the head, where 
auditory event -related potentials are easily detected (Rosburg et al., 2010). Each participant's N1 
component reflects minimum voltage within a window from 70 to 120ms; the P2 component has 
the maximum voltage within a latency range of 120 -210 ms post -stimulus. Latency was defined 
as the time -to-peak amplitude for each component (Figure 2C).

between the three groups [F(2, 43) = 14.22, p = 0.00002]. Another ANOVA was also performed

14 to compare groups (Misophonia, ASD, and TD) on social ratings, there is a statistically 
significant difference in social ratings (SR) between the three groups [F(2, 43) = 15.31, p = 
0.00001] ( Figure 3A & 3B ). Between -group MR analysis using post -hoc t -tests assuming 
unequal variances,  identified differences between misophonia vs TD (t(26) = 6.2, p < 0.01), 
misophonia vs ASD (t(32) = 2.8, p < 0.01), and TD vs ASD (t(26) = 2.7, p < 0.05), with 
unpleasantness ratings highest in misophonia, followed by ASD, then  TD .  While SR analysis 
indicated significant differences between misophonia vs TD (t(26) = 6.1, p < 0.01) and 
misophonia vs ASD (t(32) = 4.0, p < 0.01), again with unpleasantness ratings highest in the 
misophonia group, there were no differences in SR un pleasantness rating for ASD vs TD (t(27) = 
1.1, p = 0.27) ( Figure 3A & 3B ).  
These data indicate that participants with misophonia responded more severely to social 
and mechanical visual cues than other groups, while maintaining a statistically significant  
elevated rating towards social visual cues compared to mechanical cues within group ( Figure 
3C). Misophonia participants found the social cue more unpleasant while ASD participants 
experienced an equivalent dislike to the auditory cue regardless of the vi sual pairing.  The 
increase in unpleasantness ratings corresponded to an increase in misophonia severity ( Table 3 ).

16 First ERP Responses to Misophoni a triggers paired with Social vs Mechanical Cue  
ERPs were collected for the first and second auditory stimuli presentations paired with 
both mechanical and social cues ( Figure 4 ). A one -way ANOVA was conducted to determine 
the effect of group (Misophonia, ASD, TD) on first N1 responses to social cues; the results 
indicate a significant effect  [F(2, 43) = 3.46, p = 0.04] ( Figure 5A2 ). In particular,  post-hoc 
comparisons using between -group t -tests indicated a significantly larger N1 response to the first 
presentation of sounds paired with social images for misophonia participants compared to TD 
(t(26) = -2.31, p < 0.05), as well as a trending significance between misophonia and ASD (t(32) 
= -1.99, p = 0.06) participants. There were no differences in N1 response to the first presentation 
of sounds paired with social images between ASD and TD participants (t(2 7) = -0.33, p =0.73). 
There were no significant differences in N1 for first presentation of the sounds when paired with 
mechanical images among groups ( Figure 5A1 ).

18 A one -way ANOVA wa s conducted to determine the effect of group (Misophonia, ASD, 
TD) on the differences between first N1 mechanic vs first N1 social responses; the results 
indicate a leaning significant effect [F(2, 43) = 2.93, p = 0.064] ( Figure 5A3 ). In particular, t -
tests comparing misophonia and ASD (t(32) = -1.99, p = 0.057) showed a marginally  significant 
difference, while t -tests comparing misophonia and TD showed a statistically significant 
difference (t(26) = -2.13, p < 0.05). A within group analysis indicated a si gnificant difference 
between N1 first mechanical and N1 first social in misophonia(t(15) = 2.1, p = .050), all other 
groups did not show significant within group differences.  These tests suggest that only in 
misophonia was the N1 larger within the social than the mechanical context.

20 Regarding the P2 response to the first presentation of the auditory cue paired with 
mechanical/social visual cue, there was a trend toward significant differences among groups for 
the social contexts. A one -way ANOVA was conducted to determine the  effect of group 
(Misophonia, ASD, TD) on first P2 responses. The results indicate a marginally significant 
effect, [F(2, 43) = 2.52, p = 0.09195] ( Figure 6A2 ). Between group t -test were conducted for P2 
responses to sounds paired with social cues: no diff erence was detected between ASD and TD 
participants (t(27) = -0.18019, p =0.9); a significant difference between misophonia and ASD 
participants (t(32) = -2.06, p =0.047)  and marginally significant difference between misophonia 
and TD participants (t(26) = -0.17, p =0.09) was identified.  No statistically significant group 
differences were observed in the differences between P2 response amplitude to social vs 
mechanical cues.  
Altogether, only misophonia participants showed within group differences between  first 
social N1 and first mechanical N1, for all other groups, analysis of first mechanical vs first social 
exposure did not reveal any significant differences in N1 or P2 within groups between social and 
mechanical cues. However, analysis of the first pr esentation of auditory cues paired to social 
image N1 and P2 components showed distinct between  group differences. According to our 
results, misophonia participants, compared to the other groups, displayed larger N1 responses, , 
as well as a decreased P2 t o social visual cues, when misophoni a auditory cues are paired with 
social visual cues.

21 Habituation from First to Second sound presentation with ERP analysis   
Given that there were no differences between groups in first presentations of the sounds 
paired with the mechanical cue, we examined differences in habituation –the degree of difference 
between the first and second presentation of the sounds paired with the mechanical cue and for 
the social cue via a ratio between the first and second au ditory cue ERP ( Figure 7 ). A two -way 
repeated measures ANOVA was performed to analyze the effect of group (Misophonia, ASD, 
and TD) and presentation order (First and Second) on N1 responses or P2 responses to 
mechanical cues. The results indicated that the re was no statistically significant interaction 
between the effects of group and presentation order in N1 (F(2,90) = 1.21, p = 0.30) and P2 
(F(2,90) = 0.07, p = 0.93) for mechanical cues  ( Figure 6C1 ). 
For the sounds paired with social cues, given the sign ificant group differences in first 
sound attention processing in N1 [F(2, 43) = 3.46, p = 0.04031] ( Figure 5A2 ) and a trending 
significant difference in P2 [F(2, 43) = 2.52, p = 0.09195] ( Figure 6A2 ), we could not examine 
habituation per se without conside ring the significant ERP component differences for the first 
stimulus. We therefore examined the overall ERP response difference between first social cue 
and second social cue processing through ratio differences for the mechanical cue and social cue.  
This was supported by a one way measure ANOVA with factors of group on habituation 
ratio differential ( |First Cue| - |Second Cue|)/(|First Cue| - |Second Cue| ) for N1 Social [F(2, 45) 
= 0.45, p = 0.65], N1 Mechanical [F(2, 45) = 0.13, p = 0.88], P2 Social [F(2 , 45) = 0.34, p = 
0.71], P2 Mechanical [F(2, 45) = 0.29, p = 0.75], exhibiting no significant differences in 
habituation between social contexts and groups. (Figure 7) . These data suggest that, overall, 
misophonia participants exhibited  similar habituatio n processing (in first to second presentation) 
to social and mechanical cues; as well as in the other groups (ASD and TD).

23 Discussion  
Our main finding was that, compared to typically developing individuals and clinical 
ASD contro ls, participants with misophonia showed increased registration of sensory input  to 
trigger sounds presented in social contexts even before classification of stimuli of the source of 
the sound. Unknowingly allocating enhanced attention to sounds paired wit h social visual cues 
supports the idea that misophonia involves exaggerated first registration of sensory input  
classification of stimuli to socially -relevant auditory stimuli, which may underlie the severe 
aversion to these triggers.  
In addition, misopho nia participants' attention to sounds paired with social images 
decreased when they were classifying social stimuli , perhaps as a coping mechanism. A recent 
clinical study indicated that individuals with misophonia have developed several coping 
strategies in response to their aversive reactions to trigger sounds. These coping mechanisms 
include  avoiding or removing themselves from certain situations, mimicking trigger sounds or 
the action producing them, "canceling out" or "retaliating," using earplugs, hea dsets or listening 
to music, distracting oneself, reciting positive internal dialog to help calm themselves, asking 
others to stop making the sounds, and being mindful of their sounds. (Edelstein et al., 2013). In 
most of these coping mechanisms, participa nts deliberately remove themselves from the stressor. 
Our finding of reduced P2 responses could be used as a biological marker to assess and develop 
new treatments for coping.   
Finally, the habituation hypothesis was not supported by our findings: we foun d intact 
habituation to misophonia triggers in N1 and P2 responses regardless of the sound source, 
whether mechanical or social. These findings question the idea that impaired sensory habituation 
underlies misophonia symptoms. From an interventional standp oint, our initial findings suggest

24 that misophonia treatment should perhaps focus on decreasing first N1 responses rather than 
habituating to the aversive stimuli over time.  
 As part of future research, we will examine the preceding responses to visual clues before sound 
presentation with the goal of assessing the overall effect of arousal and high -level responses to 
social context and its impact on sound processing. We will a lso examine whether differences in 
habituation may be more apparent on larger timescales, by examining responses to the sounds 
paired with social cues early versus later in the task.  
Conclusion  
  As far as the auditory processing mechanism of misophonia i s concerned, this study 
allows a view into the differentiation of the visual and auditory aspects of this illness.  This 
project is a part of a larger initiative designed to address the needs of people with misophonia 
that are severely limited in their dai ly lives because of this disorder. It is important to have a 
solid understanding of both pre -attentive registration of sensory input and pre -attentive 
classification of sensory stimuli in order to be able to make sense of why misophonia is a 
socially -orien ted disorder. Future research into auditory and visual  processing mechanisms 
across social and non -social contexts in misophonia is on the horizon in an attempt to create a 
standardized method for diagnosing and treating the condition.
