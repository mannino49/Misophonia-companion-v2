Audiometric testABSTRACT
Previous studies have shown that sound influences students both physiologically andperceptually. However,
most ofthese studies focussed ontheeffects ofsounds atgroup-level, ignoring individual differences. Therefore,
weinvestigated which indicators canbeused toidentify differences inbodily responses andperceptual assess-
ments ofeach individual when exposed tofour different sounds. First, based onanaudiometric test, thehearing
acuity of15students (from fivedifferent profiles based ontheir acoustical preferences andneeds) wasmeasured.
Then, twosound exposure experiments were conducted intheSenseLab: direct sound exposure using earbuds in
alaboratory setting, andindirect sound exposure with speakers inarealroom setting. During each experiment,
theattention level (AL), mental relaxation level (MRL), heart rate(HR), andrespiration rate(RR) were measured
with wearable devices, andstudents made perceptual assessments ofeach condition. Thepercentage ofchange
normalised thefour bodily response measurements among students. Based oncorrelation analysis andt-tests,
bodily responses, andperceptual assessments across experiments were compared, atgroup-level andindividual-
level. Sixstudents, who suffered from mild hearing lossinlow-frequency sounds, showed bodily responses such
asincreased HRduring exposure tolow-frequency sound conditions. Perceptual assessments ofdifferent sound
types during both labexperiments substantiated theacoustical preferences ofthestudents from thefiveprofiles.
Bodily responses showed nostrong norsignificant correlations with perceptual assessments during thedirect
sound exposure experiments. Differences inbodily responses andperceptual assessments between thetwoex-
periments andbetween group-level andindividual-level were observed inAL.Itisconcluded thathearing acuity
andtype ofsound (sound frequencies) arekeyindicators foridentifying differences inbodily responses (such as
HRandRR)andperceptual assessment. Forfuture research, itiscrucial toconsider incorporating audiometric
tests, bodily responses such asHRandRR,andperceptual assessments inthistype ofinvestigations.
1.Introduction
University students spend asignificant amount oftime studying in-
door, whether athome orineducational buildings [1–3].Research has
shown thatstaying indoors foralong time canaffect occupants ’health
duetoa‘bad ’indoor environmental quality (IEQ) [4,5] ,andthus itis
important toconsider theIEQofthese study places andeliminate any
stressors that could affect students ’health negatively. Theacoustical
quality isoneoftheIEQfactors thatmay positively ornegatively affect
students ’health andcomfort [6,7] .Background noise isoneoftheIEQ
stressors that cancause nonauditory effects such asprolonged stress,caused indirectly bytheanti-stress mechanism that isactivated when
exposed tostressors such asnoise [8,9] .Theanti-stress mechanism in-
creases adrenaline andnor-adrenaline levels intheshort-term, possibly
leading toanincrease inheart rate(HR) andrespiration rate(RR) [9].
Changes inphysical and/or physiological responses (including HR,RR
andbrainwaves) asaresult ofexposure toaphysical stressor, such as
noise, arereferred toasbodily responses [10,11] .Thus, astudy of
occupant-related indicators, including bodily responses andperceptual
assessments, might contribute toabetter understanding oftheeffects of
theacoustical environment onstudents ’preferences andneeds [12].
Theeffects ofsound asanenvironmental stressor have been studied

using bodily responses and perceptual assessments. For instance,
Alvarsson etal.[13] examined university students’ bodily responses,
including high-frequency HRvariability, when exposed tonatural
sounds andenvironmental noises. Their findings indicated nosignificant
changes inHRduring theexperiment; however, thestudents rated the
natural sounds asthemost pleasant. Abbasi etal.[14] investigated
university students’ bodily responses tothree sound pressure levels
(SPL) oflow-frequency sound inalabexperiment. They recorded bodily
responses, including electroencephalogram (EEG) forbrain wave signals
andelectrocardiography forHRsignals. They observed thatthese bodily
responses significantly differed among thedifferent SPLs, andstudents’
mental fatigue increased when theSPLincreased. Tristan-Hernandez [7]
found thatboth beta andtheta brain wave amplitudes decreased when
university students were exposed tobackground noise, resulting in
reduced attention levels while performing cognitive tasks. Furthermore,
Guan etal.[15] concluded that brain wave patterns differed between
theperceived comfortable sound condition (music sound at50dB)and
theperceived uncomfortable sound condition (fannoise at80dB).They
alsoobserved adecline intheta wave during theuncomfortable sound
condition. However, correlations between bodily responses and
perceptual assessments ofbackground noise were nottested inthese
studies. Park andLee[16] measured both HR,andRRofparticipants
and asked them toassess thenoticeability and annoyance ofthese
sounds, while being exposed tosix-floor impact noise (e.g., adult
walking andchild running) stimuli. They found thatRRwascorrelated
significantly and positively with both perceptual assessments ofthe
standard floor impact noise. Similarly, Hume and Ahtamad [17]
concluded thatRRincreased during themost perceived pleasant sound
clips. Thus, HR, RR,and brain waves asbodily responses could be
measured toexplain differences intheacoustical needs ofstudents.
Human ears aremost sensitive tohigh frequencies (3000–5000 Hz)
andgenerally most annoyed bylow-frequency noise (20–125 Hz),which
cancause stress [18,19] andnegatively impact cardiovascular responses
such asHR[20]. Forinstance, Muetal.[21] observed thatHRslightly
increased among senior adults (over 60years old) with mild orsevere
hearing loss upto55dB(A), butremained stable above that level.
Keur-Huizinga etal.[22] studied theimpact ofhearing acuity onHRin
125 participants aged 37–72, exposed tospeech sound stimuli (fre-
quencies ranged from 330 to6300 Hz). They found noconsistent
changes inHRreactivity inparticipants with different hearing acuity,
andconcluded thathearing acuity might beassociated with changes in
thesympathetic nervous system’s reactivity. Mackersie etal.[23]
examined theeffects ofhearing lossandnoise onstress-related auto-
nomic measures in33participants (18with hearing loss, 15with normal
hearing, ages 22–79) during sentence recognition tasks. They found that
the HR ofparticipants with hearing loss decreased atlower
signal-to-noise ratios, while HRofthose with normal hearing didnot.
They highlighted that participants with hearing lossmay experience
increased effort andstress during speech recognition innoisy environ-
ments, which could influence thepsychophysiological responses con-
cerning theautonomic nervous system.
Theabove-mentioned studies [21–23] recruited senior adults, who
have alower sensitivity tolow-frequency sounds compared toyoung
adults. Although Alimohammadi andEbrahimi [24] tested theuniver-
sitystudents’ mental performance while being exposed toboth lowand
high-frequency sounds, they excluded thestudents whose hearing
threshold was lessthan 20dB.Hence, little isknown about therela-
tionship between hearing acuity inyoung adults andtheir bodily re-
sponses todifferent sound types. Furthermore, while hearing acuity
measured through anaudiometric testhasbeen considered inseveral
sound exposure experiments with human subjects [13,14,18,25,26],
differences inbodily responses concerning thehearing thresholds of
different students atvarious sound frequencies have notstudied.
Most oftheabove-mentioned labexperiments [7,13–17] considered
participants’ personal traits, including demographics (e.g., ageand
gender) andhearing acuity ornoise sensitivity. However, they mainlyfocused ontheoverall bodily responses andperceptual assessment at
group-level ignoring differences inpreferences andneeds between in-
dividuals (profiles). Profiling occupants based ontheir preferences and
needs ofacertain indoor environment isoneofthemethods thattake
into account thedifferences between individuals’ intheindoor envi-
ronment [27]. Noting thatprofiling ofoccupants inseveral situations (e.
g.,classrooms, study places, homes, andhospitals) hasbeen addressed in
previous studies [28–31]. Inconnection tothesound-related preferences
ofstudents, Hamida etal.[32] identified five profiles ofuniversity
students based ontheir acoustical andpsychosocial preferences fortheir
study places, such assounds from theoutside andprivacy. These five
profiles are: 1)sound concerned introvert, 2)sound unconcerned
introvert, 3)sound partially concerned introvert, 4)sound concerned
extrovert, and5)sound unconcerned extrovert. Moreover, they identi-
fiedaspects related tothepreferences ofeach profile through afield
study, such asboth students from profiles 1,3,and4were concerned
with thesounds from theoutside because they gotannoyed andlost
focus bythese sounds. According tothese aspects, itwasconcluded that
thestudy place’s context, such asbuilding location, might affect stu-
dents’ acoustical preferences.
Studies onbodily responses tobemeasured forstudents from
different profiles when exposed toboth preferable andnon-preferable
sounds could notbefound intheliterature. Also, thehearing acuity at
different sound frequencies ofuniversity students wasnotwidely stud-
ied.Inaddition, toadvance knowledge inthisarea, studies oncorrela-
tions between bodily responses (e.g., HR), health aspects (e.g., hearing
acuity), environmental indicators (e.g., SPL and sound frequency),
perceptual assessments (e.g., pleasantness), current situation ofstudy
places (e.g., existing sound sources), andpreferences ofuniversity stu-
dents from different profiles, areneeded. Furthermore, westillneed to
testwhich ofthebodily responses (including HR,RR,andbrain waves
that were tested inprevious studies) canbemeasured toexplain dif-
ferences intheacoustical preferences ofdifferent students. Hence, the
main aimofthisstudy istopropose guidance forinvestigating thebodily
responses that canhelp usbetter understand thedifferences ineach
student’s perceptual responses todifferent sounds. Therefore, themain
research question ofthis study is:Can bodily responses beused to
explain differences inpreferences and/or needs fordifferent sounds, and
how canwetestthis?
2.Methods
2.1.Studydesign
Tostudy which indicators canbeused toidentify differences in
bodily responses todifferent sounds and sound levels, two sound
exposure labexperiments were conducted onfour days inNovember
2023 with fourstudents perday(except foronedaywith three students).
Allofthese experiments took place intheSenseLab [33]. These two
sound exposure labexperiments aimtoanswer thefour sub-questions
thatanswer themain research question ofthisstudy, which are:
1.Towhat extent isanaudiometric testessential forsound exposure lab
experiments?
2.Canstudents’ perceptual assessments ofsound conditions substan-
tiate their acoustical preferences from thefield study?
3.Dobodily responses correlate with perceptual assessments of
different sounds?
4.Dobodily responses and perceptual assessments differ signifi-
cantly when students areexposed directly orindirectly tosounds?
Anaudiometric testwasperformed totestthehearing acuity ofthe
participating students. Thefirst labexperiment took place intwotest
chambers where each participant participated individually, and the
second wasconducted intheExperience room oftheSenseLab with four
students. Inthefirstexperiment, each student wasexposed todifferentA.Hamida etal. Indoor  Environments  1 (2024)  100066

sounds andsound levels directly inboth ears viaearbuds where other
‘sound ’stressors were eliminated since thestudent satalone inthe
chamber andwas facing thewall. Thus, the‘direct ’sound exposure
experiment ismainly focused onthedirect effect ofthesound condition
onboth bodily responses andperceptual assessment. Incontrast, the
sounds inthe‘indirect ’sound exposure experiment were produced bya
sound-producing system (four speakers) intheceiling thatpropagated in
theExperience room with thepresence ofother ‘sound ’stressors, such as
thepresence ofother students. This study aims tocompare whether the
bodily responses andperceptual assessments ofdifferent sounds differ
significantly between thedirect andindirect sound exposures. Inboth
experiments, theother factors (lighting, indoor air,andthermal condi-
tions) were kept asconstant aspossible.
2.2.Participants
Participants comprised bachelor andmaster students (n15inthe
testchamber with power level 1-β0.6,andn14intheExperience
room with power level 1-β0.6,where βrefers tobeta which istype II
error), from thefaculty ofArchitecture andtheBuilt Environment at
Delft University ofTechnology, intheNetherlands. The power was
calculated byconducting aPost hocanalysis bygiving effect size0.5,
significance level0.05, andasample sizeof15forthefirstexperiment,
and14forthesecond experiment) using G*Power software [34].The
power level of0.6means thatthetesthasa60%probability ofcorrectly
rejecting thenullhypothesis. Students were asked nottoperform any
physical exercise before theexperiment orsmoke ordrink coffee, as
these activities might affect their bodily responses. Seven were female
students andeight were male students. Their mean agewas21years
(standard deviation: 1.5). These students allparticipated inaprevious
questionnaire andfield study performed byHamida etal.[32].That
study resulted infive profiles based onacoustical and psychosocial
preferences oftheir study places gathered through aquestionnaire. In
Fig.1theacoustical andpsychosocial preferences ofthese fiveprofiles
arepresented. Two students perprofile (asaminimum) participated in
thelabexperiments: two students from Profile 1,two students from
Profile 2,three students from Profile 3,fourstudents from Profile 4,and
four students from Profile 5.Additionally, tobetter explain both the
bodily responses andtheperceptual assessments ofeach student, partof
data gathered inthat previous study [32] wasused, including soundsources andbuilding-related indicators (seeAppendix A).
2.3.Bodilyresponses
Two wearable sensors, anEEG headband (brain activity) and a
smartwatch (Fig.2),were used tomeasure four bodily responses: 1)
attention level (AL); 2)mental relaxation level (MRL); 3)heart rate
(HR); and4)respiration rate(RR). Both HRandRRwere chosen because
oftheir possible relation with theanti-stress mechanism andtheir ease
ofmeasurement with smartwatches. ALwasassessed todetermine how
certain sounds affect astudent ’sattention, while MRL wasmeasured to
evaluate theeffects ofdifferent sounds onastudent ’smental stress (also
possibly related totheanti-stress mechanism).
TheBrainLink LiteEEG headband byMacrotellect measured ALand
MRL using three dryelectrodes attached totheparticipant ’sforehead.
EEG data were processed bytheTGAM chipset from NeuroSky [35] and
transmitted inreal-time toacomputer viaBluetooth every half-second
using Python code inPyCharm 2023. Thedata were saved asaCSV
file,including attention levels, MRLs, andvarious brain waves (Delta,
Theta, Low-Alpha, High-Alpha, Low-Beta, High-Beta, Low-Gamma, and
Mid-Gamma). Both attention andMRL were measured onascale from
0to100.
The Garmin Vivosmart 5smartwatch monitored HRand RRper
minute, known toshow good accuracy during low-intensity activity
[36].Since theabsolute relative error ofthesmartwatch showed alower
error ontheleftwrist compared totheright wrist during aroutine ac-
tivity ofdaily living [36],students were asked towear thesmartwatch
ontheir leftwrist during theexperiment. Afterward, thesmartwatch was
connected toacomputer viaUSB totransfer data using Garmin Express
software, and the data were manually transferred toanExcel
spreadsheet.
The audiometric test (Fig. 3)was conducted inone ofthetest
chambers oftheSenseLab using aclinical audiometer (Otometrics
MADSEN Xeta) toanswer thefirst sub-question. Amonaural audio-
metric testwith theairconduction method wasconducted byproducing
asound indifferent SPLs (starting from 0dB)atdifferent sound pressure
levels (starting from 0dB)across eight frequencies: 125, 250, 500, 1000,
2000, 4000, 6000, and8000 Hz.Thestudent satinfront oftheexam-
iner, holding aresponse stick, andclicked theresponse button upon
hearing asound ateach frequency. Theexaminer recorded thehearing

threshold onanaudiogram. Thestudent satwith his/her back tothe
examiner toavoid visual influences onthetestresults. The hearing
threshold wascalculated according totheWorld Health Organization ’s
(WHO) World Report onHearing [37].This involved averaging the
minimum SPLs that thestudent could hear at500, 1000, 2000, and
4000 Hzinthebetter ear.
2.4.Perceptual assessments
Perceptual assessments cancontribute toabetter understanding of
anindividual ’sacoustical preferences andneeds inacertain context
[38].Therefore, questionnaires were used intheform ofanalogue scales
thatareeasy andquick tobefilled outbyparticipants [39].During the
labexperiment inthetestchamber, each student wasasked toassess the
sound conditions onacontinuous scale from (-1)to(1)based onthree
aspects: acceptability [40],pleasantness [17,26,41] ,and stress level
[42] (see Appendix B).IntheExperience room, students assessed the
sound conditions based ontwoaspects: acceptability onascale from (-1)
to(1)andnoise level [40,43] (i.e., intensity [44])onacontinuous
scale from (1)to(5)(seeAppendix C).
2.5.Experimental setup
Previous labexperiments were carried outinalaboratory setting,
such asinanaudiometric room [7,16] ,testchamber [14,45] ,testing
booth [25],oranechoic, semi-anechoic room [17,18,21,22,24] for
direct sound exposure. Asthere isalack oftesting ofthebodily re-
sponses ofdifferent sound types inrealsituations, thisstudy designedtwoexperimental setups: alaboratory setting inthetestchambers (asa
direct sound exposure), and asemi-real environment setting inthe
Experience room (asindirect sound exposure).
2.5.1.TestChambers
Thefirst sound exposure experiments were conducted intwotest
chambers (area 2.2*2.4 m2)oftheSenseLab. Each ofthese testchambers
wasfurnished with adesk andachair (Fig.4).Atimer device wasonthe
wall infront ofthestudent sothat thestudent could track thelab
experiment timeline next tothetimer.
2.5.2.TheExperience room
Thesecond sound exposure experiment wasconducted intheExpe-
rience room (area: 6.1*4.2 m2andheight: 2.7m)oftheSenseLab. The
floor iscovered with smooth grey linoleum material, theceiling consists
ofwhite acoustic panels, andthewalls aremade oflaminated safety
glass andcovered with light green sound-absorbing panels. Therever-
beration time oftheExperience room was 0.22 seconds [46].The
Experience room wasfurnished with eight tables (the topmaterial is
made oflight wood laminate) andfivechairs (Fig.5);aresearcher satin
front ofthestudents toguide them with thetest procedure. Each
participant satatoneofthechairs inthemiddle oftheroom, where the
four participants were relatively close.
2.6.Pilottests
Several rounds ofpilot tests with participants who didnottake part
inthemain experiments were performed inOctober 2023. These tests

aimed toselect thesound sources, define themost suitable SPLs foreach
sound and determine theduration ofboth thebaseline and sound
exposure times.≡Thefirstpilot testinvolved three participants tocompare fourbodily
responses during afour-minute baseline andafour-minute break
between two sound types: traffic andrural area athigh SPLs, as
explained inTable 1.

≡Inthesecond pilot test, with four participants, differences inbodily
responses within thefirstandsecond twominutes ofafour-minute
baseline, with atwo-minute break between lowandhigh SPLs of
traffic sounds, were examined.
≡Inthethird pilot test, fiveparticipants experienced atwo-minute
baseline atthebeginning. Then, twosound types (rural area and
traffic) were played attwoSPLlevels (low andhigh), with atwo-
minute break between thetwo SPLs ofthesame sound and be-
tween different sound types.
≡Thefourth pilot test,with three participants, wassimilar tothethird
onebutthebreak between different SPLs ofthesame sound type was
eliminated.
≡Based oncommon indoor sounds atstudents ’home study places
(Appendix A),two additional sound sources were included: me-
chanical ventilation andpeople talking. TheSPLs ofallfour sound
types were setto‘bearable ’levels (below 100dB(A) asitisashort-
term sound exposure forlessthan 15minutes [47])after discus-
sion with tworesearchers.
≡Thefifth pilot testfollowed thecomplete experimental procedure
with four participants (two participating simultaneously). This
included foursound types (rural area, traffic, mechanical ventilation,
and talking people sounds), each played attwo SPLs, with two-
minute baselines, two-minute breaks between different sound
types, andaperceptual assessment form.
Based ontheresults ofthefirsttwopilot tests, subtle changes were
observed inbodily responses between thefirsttwoandthesecond two
minutes ofafour-minute baseline andthebreak period. Forexample, in
thesecond pilot test, theHRdifferences among thefour participants
were lessthan 5%,with twoparticipants showing nodifferences atall.
Additionally, theparticipants indicated that thefour-minute baseline
wasrelatively toolong. Consequently, thebaseline period wasshortened
totwominutes, aswasalsodone inthestudy byPark etal.[48].
Theoutcome ofthethird pilot testshowed that HRdifferences be-
tween thetwo-minute baseline andthetwo-minute break, within the
same sound type, were minimal (0%fortwoparticipants, and2%and
4%fortheothers). During therural sound condition athigh SPLwith a
break inthethird pilot test, oneparticipant ’sHRdeclined byonly 1%.
Incontrast, inthefourth pilot test, theHRofparticipants increased by
7%during therural areasound condition athigh SPLwhen there wasno
break. Therefore, thebreak between thesame sound type butatdifferent
SPLs waseliminated duetotheobserved changes inbodily responses
andbecause participants found thenumber ofbreaks toomuch.
2.7.Soundtypesandlevels
Four sound clips atdifferent frequencies were selected based onthe
study byHamida etal.[32] (seeAppendix A:sounds identified atstu-
dents ’home study places, preferred andnon-preferred sounds), andthe
pilot tests. Two clips represented outdoor sounds andtworepresented
indoor sounds, covering different frequencies, were downloaded from
theonline database ‘Freesound ’[49]:1)aquiet rural area recorded in
theNetherlands (covers low-frequency ranges), 2)acitycenter with
high traffic recorded intheNetherlands (covers most frequency ranges),
3)mechanical ventilation (covers lowfrequencies), and4)people talk-
inginDutch (covers moderate frequency ranges); andcompiled intoone
fileusing Audacity 3.3.3 software [50].These four sound clips were
recorded monoaurally. Thequiet rural area andthecitycentre area clips
were recorded outdoors while themechanical ventilation andthepeople
talking clips were recorded indoors. Thesound signal spectra ofthefour
sound clips areillustrated inFig.6.
Inthetest chambers, thesounds were played through noise-
canceling JBLLive Pro2earbuds. These were used because they are
light ontheparticipant ’shead since they wearing theBrainLink LiteEEG
device. Also, other researchers, such asGuo etal.[51],indicated that
earbuds aretruewireless stereo devices thatcanbeconnected throughBluetooth toahardware device, such asacomputer, andcanprovide
consistent output SPLs when they receive digital audio. IntheExperi-
ence room asexplained byBluyssen etal.[33],they were played
through four ceiling-mounted speakers ‘near-midfield studio monitors,
three-way, 2*7″woofer, ADAM Audio A77x ’and‘asubwoofer 200W,
1*10 ″MKII, ADAM Audio Sub10 ’from AMPTEC which areconnected to
aBehringer UMC404HD audio interface. Each sound clipwasplayed at
twodifferent sound pressure levels (SPLs): lowandhigh (Table 1).The
SPLs fortheearbuds were measured using acalibrated KEMAR dummy
head with twoBruel&Kjaer microphones. IntheExperience room, the
SPLs were determined byusing aNorsonic Nor140sound level meter
andensuring thattheSPLdidnotexceed 100dB(A).
2.8.Procedure
2.8.1.Testchambers experiment
Thefirstexperiment wasdivided intotwoparts, each with aduration
of14minutes (Fig.7).Thefirst part focused onthesounds from the
outside while thesecond part focused onthesounds from theinside.
Two students participated simultaneously inthisexperiment, each in
oneofthetestchambers. Theresearcher gave anintroduction tothe
students outside thetestchambers andexplained tothem theprocedure
without informing thestudents about thesound sources. Aresearcher
handed each ofthestudents themeasurement devices andthepairs of
earbuds. Then each student entered thetestchamber, wasseated, and
after twominutes heard thesentence ‘this isthestart oftheexperiment ’
upon which thestudent started theexperiment bypressing thestart
button onthetimer totrack theexperiment timeline. Students were
asked toassess acceptability, pleasantness, andstress level during each
sound condition. After theendofeach part, thestudent heard thesen-
tence ‘This istheendoftheexperiment ’.Once thefirstpartwasfinished,
thestudents were asked toleave thetestchamber andmove into the
other testchamber. They hada5-minute break inbetween thetwoparts.
Inthefirstpartoftheexperiment thestudents were exposed tofour
conditions: 1)sounds ofaquiet rural area, which were played intwo
SPLs (low andthen high) thateach lasted fortwominutes, 2)nosounds
1thatlasted fortwominutes, 3)sounds ofacitycentre area with high
traffic which was played intwoSPLs (low andthen high) that each
lasted fortwominutes, and4)nosounds 2thatlasted fortwominutes.
Thesecond part oftheexperiment consisted again offour conditions,
with different sounds than inthefirst experiment: 1)sounds ofme-
chanical ventilation, which were played intwoSPLs (low andthen high)
that each lasted fortwominutes, 2)nosounds 3that lasted fortwo
minutes, 3)sounds ofpeople talking sounds which wasplayed intwo
SPLs (low andthen high) that each lasted fortwominutes, and4)no
sounds 4thatlasted fortwominutes.
2.8.2.Experience roomexperiment
The second experiment, which was conducted intheExperience
room, lasted for24minutes andconsisted ofnine conditions andthree
breaks (Fig. 8).Four students and aresearcher were seated inthe
Experience room. Each student wore thesame wearable sensor devices
asinthetestchamber test.
2.9.Datamanagement andanalysis
Adataset forthegroup aswell asadata setforeach student was
created inanExcel file.Each ofthedatasets included theaverage bodily
responses (heart rate, respiration rate, attention, andMRLs) ofeach
condition ineach experiment aswell astheperceptual assessment of
each condition. Arelative change wascalculated tonormalised allfour
indicators byapplying thefollowing Eq.(1).

Theaverage oftheperceptual assessments was calculated forthe
group percondition, while theindividual bodily responses were recor-
dedpercondition. Thecontinuous scale oftheperceptual assessment
wasmeasured using aruler since thescale wasprinted in1:1scale in
centimeters (Appendix B).Thestandard deviation (SD) forboth bodily
response andperceptual assessment wascalculated forthegroup and
perindividual among theconditions ofeach experiment. Spearman ’s
rank-order nonparametric correlation analysis assessed thestrengthbetween thebodily response andperceptual assessment. This strength
was examined bycalculating both thecorrelation coefficient (rF0.5)
andtheprobability (p-valueD0.05).
Anormality test(Shapiro-Wilk) was performed onthebodily re-
sponses ofthegroup among alltheconditions ofboth experiments.
Based onthat, atwo-tailed t-test (fornormally distributed bodily re-
sponses andperceptual assessment variables) andWilcoxon signed-rank
test(for not normally distributed bodily responses and perceptual
assessment variables) were computed totest whether thebodily
response and perceptual assessment differed significantly (p-val-
ueD0.05) between thetwoexperiments ingeneral andpercondition.
More specifically, these tests aimtoanswer thefourth sub-question by

exploring whether bodily responses significantly differ when thesound
wasdirectly exposed inthestudent ’searsascompared toindirect sound
exposure. This answer explores thepotential ofconsidering bodily re-
sponses inrealenvironmental settings (e.g., realstudy places).
2.10.Ethicalaspects
This study (application ID:3555) wasapproved bytheHuman Ethics
Committee (HREC) ofDelft University ofTechnology onthe15th of
November 2023.
3.Results
3.1.Audiometric tests
InFig.9,theoutcome oftheaudiometric tests ispresented perstu-
dent. According totheWHO test[37],allstudents hadnormal hearing in
both ears, except fortwo(students 1and6)who suffered from mild
hearing loss. Additionally, several students suffered from mild hearing
lossinlowfrequencies (between 125and250Hz).More specifically, the
hearing threshold ofstudents 3,4,6,10,11,and13of125Hzwas
higher than 25dB,meaning thatthey have mild hearing lossatthatlow
frequency sound. However, most ofthem could hear thehighest fre-
quency (8000 Hz)inthelowSPLwith atleast oneoftheir ears.
3.2.Bodilyresponses
3.2.1.Bodilyresponses inthetestchambers
The averaged responses ofthe15students tothefour indicators
during theeight sound conditions oftheexperiments inthetestcham-
bersarepresented inFig.10.Ingeneral, these fourindicators fluctuated
during thedifferent sound conditions. ALincreased mostly during the
‘high rural ’and‘high talking people ’conditions by15%and14%,
respectively. MRL increased mostly during the‘low rural ’and ‘low
traffic ’conditions by6%and5%,respectively. HRdecreased mostly
during the‘high ventilation ’and‘low ventilation ’conditions by11%
and10%,respectively. RRincreased mostly during the‘low traffic ’
condition (2%).
Atindividual-level, thefour bodily responses differed among the15
participants inthetestchambers (seeFig.11).Also, bodily responses of
several participants differed from theaverage ofthegroup. Examples:
 ALdecreased themost during both ‘low rural ’and‘high rural ’con-
ditions forstudents 2,8,10,and12.
 MRL decreased themost forstudents 1,3,4,8,10,and13during
‘low rural ’and‘high rural ’conditions, while forstudents 3,14,and
15MRL decreased themost during the‘high traffic ’condition.
 HRincreased themost during the‘high rural ’condition forstudents
6,9,and15.RRincreased themost during the‘high rural ’condition
forstudents 1,6,and7.
 RRincreased themost during the‘high ventilation ’condition for
students 7,8,and14.
3.2.2.Bodilyresponses intheExperience room
Fig.12shows theaverage percentage ofchange ofthefour bodily
responses ofthe14students among theeight conditions intheExperi-
ence room. ALdeclined during alleight conditions, especially during the
‘high traffic ’,‘high talking people ’,‘lowtraffic ’,and‘lowtalking people ’
by14%,11%,11%,and9%,respectively. Incontrast, MRL increased
during most oftheconditions, especially during the‘high ventilation ’,
‘high traffic ’,and‘low talking people ’by10%,9%,and9%,respec-
tively. RRincreased mostly during the‘low ventilation ’and ‘high
ventilation ’conditions, 5%and4%respectively.
Thefourbodily responses differed among the14participants within
theeight conditions intheExperience room (seeFig.13).Inaddition,
thebodily responses ofseveral participants differed from theaverage ofthegroup. Examples:
 ALincreased themost during the‘high ventilation ’condition forfive
students (4,11,13,14,and15).
 MRL decreased themost forfour students (2,4,11,and14)during
the‘high talking people ’condition.
 HRincreased themost during the‘high rural ’condition forthree
students (3,5,and6).
 RRincreased themost during the‘high rural ’condition forfour
students (2,6,9,and14).
3.2.3.Differences inbodilyresponses between thetwoexperiments
Thenormality test(Shapiro-Wilk) ofthebodily responses showed
that allbodily responses were normally distributed, except forMRL,
which wasnotnormally distributed intheExperience room (p0.01).
Therefore, at-test was performed forallbodily responses, except for
MRL ofwhich aWilcoxon signed-rank testwascomputed totestthe
differences between thebodily responses ofthe14students who
participated inboth tests, ingeneral andpercondition. Thedifferences
between themean bodily responses showed that only ALsignificantly
differed between thetwotests (pD0.001), while other bodily responses:
MRL (p0.16), HR(p0.33), andRR(p0.54) showed nosignificant
differences. Table 2shows theresults ofthedifferences between the
bodily responses ofthe14students percondition between thetwotests.
ALsignificantly differed between thetwoexperiments ofthree condi-
tions: ‘low traffic ’,‘high traffic ’,and‘low talking people ’while theMRL
only differed significantly among the‘low rural ’condition. HRalso
differed significantly between thetwoexperiments ofthree conditions:
‘lowventilation ’,‘high ventilation ’,and‘lowtalking people ’.RRshowed
nosignificant differences between thetwo tests among theeight
conditions.
Table 3presents thedifferences inthebodily responses atindividual-
level. ALsignificantly differed between thetwotests among seven stu-
dents. MRL showed significant differences between thetwotests among
three students. HRsignificantly differed among two students only.
Conversely, RRshowed nosignificant differences between thetwotests
among all14students.
3.3.Perceptual assessment
3.3.1.Perceptual assessment intestchambers
Fig.14shows theaverage scores ofthree perceptual assessments for
eight different conditions inthetestchambers among the15students. It
wasobserved that ‘low rural ’,‘low traffic ’,and‘low ventilation ’were
themost acceptable conditions. Conversely, the‘high talking people ’
wasperceived astheleast acceptable, theleast pleasant andthemost
stressful condition. The‘low traffic ’condition wasconsidered themost
pleasant condition. Furthermore, ‘low rural ’,‘high rural ’,‘low traffic ’,
‘low ventilation ’,and‘low talking people ’were perceived astheleast
stressful condition. Theperceptual assessment oftheeight conditions in
thetestchambers varied among the15students asshown inFig.15,
showing several differences among the15students from thedifferent
profiles.

tion’were perceived astheleast acceptable conditions; andboth ‘high
traffic ’and ‘high talking people ’were perceived asthemost noisy
conditions. Fig.17shows thetwoperceptual assessments oftheeight

thatHRincreased when thecondition wasperceived asaloud noise. In
addition, HRwasstrongly andnegatively correlated with acceptability,
although thiscorrelation wasnotstatistically significant. MRL andRR
didnotshow strong norsignificant correlations with thetwoperceptual
assessments.

4.Discussion
4.1.Keyfindings
Inthepresent study, itwasinvestigated which bodily responses can
bemeasured toexplain differences inpreferences and/or needs ofuni-
versity students from different profiles while being exposed todifferent
sounds intwo settings. Four main findings arediscussed below: the
audiometric test, theperceptual assessments ofthedifferent profiles,
correlations between bodily responses andperceptual assessments, and
direct andindirect sound exposure.
4.1.1.Theaudiometric test
Sixstudents (3,4,6,10,11,and13)suffered from mild hearing loss
inlow-frequency sounds (Fig.8).Interestingly, these students belong to
theprofiles who aresound partially concerned orsound unconcerned
(students 3and4aresound unconcerned introverts, student 6isasound
partially concerned introvert, andstudents 10,11,and13aresoundunconcerned extroverts). Moreover, student 6’sHRincreased themost
while being exposed tothelow-frequency sound stimuli: the‘low rural ’
condition inthetestchamber ’sexperiment butfound itmost acceptable.
Similarly, student 13,hadthehighest HRincrease inthesame condition
intheExperience room ’sexperiment butperceived itasslightly noisy
andacceptable. These observations could mean that even though the
student could nothear thesound source atacertain SPL, thebody
responded physiologically. Mackersie etal.[23] highlighted that par-
ticipants with hearing lossmay experience increased effort andstress
during speech recognition innoisy environments, which could influence
thepsychophysiological responses concerning theautonomic nervous
system. This might explain theincreased HRinstudents 6and13,who
likely expected tohear asound during the‘low rural ’condition butdid
not,leading tostress andariseinHR.Therefore, hearing acuity seems
anessential indicator toconsider insound exposure experiments that
could explain aperson ’sacoustical preferences andneeds.

4.1.2.Perceptual assessments andthefiveprofiles
Several differences inperceptual assessments were observed at
group, individual, andprofile levels. Forexample, inthetestchamber
(asillustrated inFig.15),sixstudents (1,3,5,6,13,and14)deemed the
‘high traffic ’condition asunacceptable, noting that four ofthese stu-
dents arefrom profiles 1,3,and4who aresound concerned. Interms of
pleasantness, students 2,8,and12(from profiles 1and4)perceived the
‘high rural ’condition asunpleasant, confirming thatthese students are
sound concerned. Conversely, fivestudents (7,10,11,12,and15)found
the‘high traffic ’condition aspleasant. Interestingly, these students are
exposed totraffic sounds attheir home study place (Appendix A),which
might result inthehabituation ofthissound type. Another example,
concerning stress levels, sixstudents (4,7,8,10,13,and15)perceivedthe‘high talking people ’condition asnotstressful, ofwhich fourofthem
belong totheextrovert profiles: 4and5.Pertaining totheperceptual
assessments intheExperience room (Fig.17),both students 1and2who
belong tothe‘sound extremely concerned introvert ’profile perceived
the‘high rural ’condition asunacceptable, which confirms that these
two students areextremely sound concerned. Hence, these findings
substantiate theconclusions ofHamida etal.[32]:students from
different profiles differ intheir acoustical preferences.
4.1.3.Correlations between bodilyresponses andperceptual assessments
Bodily responses didnotshow strong orsignificant correlations with
perceptual assessments atthegroup-level inthetestchamber experi-
ment, except forMRL. Although MRL showed astrong andpositive

correlation with thethree perceptual assessments, thiscorrelation was
notstatistically significant. Attheindividual-level, only twostudents
(students 6and12)displayed astrong andpositive correlation between
their MRL andacceptability. Additionally, student 6’sMRL wasstrongly,
positively, andsignificantly correlated with pleasantness. Conversely,
student 4’sMRL wasstrongly andsignificantly, butnegatively, corre-
lated with theperceptual stress level. Since MRL isnotsignificantly
correlated with perceptual assessments, itcould beused asaninde-
pendent bodily response alongside theother three bodily responses
which didnotshow strong norsignificant correlations, separate from
perceptual assessments.
IntheExperience room experiment, ALwasstrongly, positively, and
significantly correlated with both acceptability and noise levels at
group-level. Itimplies thatwhen thesound condition wasperceived as
‘acceptable ’and‘nonoise ’,ALincreased, andviceversa. Similarly, for
individual students 6and7,ALshowed strong, positive, andsignificant
correlations with acceptability perceptual assessments. Furthermore,
student 8’sALwasstrongly, positively, andsignificantly correlated with
theperceived noise level. Additionally, HRwasstrongly, negatively, and
significantly correlated with noise levels during theExperience room
experiment atgroup-level: HRincreased asthenoise level wasperceived
asloud ofwhich SPLwassetatahigh level. This finding aligns with
Lorenzino etal.[52],whoconcluded thatnoise levels ranging from 30to
55dB(A) significantly impacted acoustical comfort, with higher noise
levels correlating with increased HRandpsychological discomfort. It
also corroborates Abbasi etal.[14],who found that HRsignificantly
differed among various sound levels oflow-frequency noise. Moreover,
Latini etal.found astrong association between pulse rateandsound-
scape response ofwhich thepulse rate decreased with perceived
pleasant sounds andincreased with perceived unpleasant sounds [53].
Thus, HRisasignificant bodily response indicator associated with the
noise level andsound type (i.e., soundscape).
Insummary, thefour bodily responses aregenerally independent of
theperceptual assessments. This indicates that perceptual assessmentscannot bereliably predicted from bodily responses, norcanbodily re-
sponses bepredicted from perceptual assessments. This also confirms
thestudy byErfanian etal.[54] thatsoundscape studies should consider
both bodily responses andperceptual assessments (i.e., psychological) to
understand better how and why individuals experience thesound
environment insuch way. However, ourstudy shows that HRisan
exception, asitcanexplain theperceptual assessment related tothe
perception ofthenoise level corresponding totheSPLasaphysical in-
dicator. Inaddition, ALisanexception thatcould explain both accept-
ability andnoise level.
4.1.4.Directsoundexposure vsindirect soundexposure
The present study compared bodily responses and perceptual
assessment between twoexperimental settings: direct sound exposure
(laboratory setting inthetestchambers) andindirect sound exposure
(semi-real lifesetting intheExperience room). Atgroup-level, themean
ALamong theeight conditions varied significantly between thetwo
experiments, particularly under the‘low traffic ’,‘high traffic ’,and‘low
talking people ’conditions. These significant changes were alsoobserved
atindividual-level forseven students. Conversely, theacceptability as-
sessments didnotshow significant differences between thetwoexperi-
ments. Given the significant differences inALbetween the two
experiments atboth group andindividual levels (among seven students),
itappears thatthisbodily response might beaffected bythedifferences
intheexperimental setup between thetwoexperiments. Additionally,
MRL differed significantly between thetwoexperiments among three
students anddiffered inthefirst condition ‘low rural ’atgroup level,
which showed decreases inthesecond experiment. These differences
might belinked totheexperimental procedure. Itcanbealsonoted that
thesound exposure time forboth experiments lasted twominutes per
condition. Thus, both ALandMRL could bemore reliable bodily re-
sponses forlonger sound exposure durations, such as5[14,51] or
10min[7].Furthermore, these twobodily responses could bemeasured
insound exposure experiments thatinvolve performance tasks, such as
testing mental fatigue [14] orattention based onacognitive task [7],
which could explain differences inperformances. Both HRand RR
showed nosignificant differences between thetwoexperiments atgroup
level. However, HRdidshow significant differences under ‘low venti-
lation ’and ‘high ventilation ’conditions with agreater decrease
observed inthefirstexperiment. This difference may berelated tothe
factthatthestudent moved between chambers prior tothese twocon-
ditions. Also, significant HRdifferences were only observed intwoin-
dividual students. Moreover, HRwassignificantly correlated with the
noise level. Therefore, HRandRRseem applicable forexplaining dif-
ferences inacoustical preferences andneeds within short-term sound
exposure experiments. These twobodily responses canbemeasured in
real-life situations, such asastudy place, since nodifferences were
observed between thetwoexperiments aswell asthey were normally
distributed among students inboth experiments.
4.2.Strengths andlimitations
This study represents afirst attempt toinvestigate university stu-
dents ’bodily responses andperceptual assessments, accounting fortheir
varying acoustical and psychosocial preferences and needs, across
multiple levels: group, individual, andprofile levels. Through labex-
periments, itenhanced theunderstanding ofstudents ’acoustical pref-
erences, previously classified into fiveprofiles [32].Another notable
strength ofthisstudy istheaudiometric testconducted with 15students,
inwhich hearing thresholds atdifferent frequencies (forboth ears) were
examined, based ontheWHO guidelines [37].Additionally inthisstudy,
bodily responses and perceptual assessments intwo distinct settings
were compared: alaboratory setting intestchambers andasemi-real life
setting intheExperience room.
Despite thenovel contributions ofthisstudy, ithassome limitations.
First, thesample sizeisrelatively small, comprising 15students (power:Table4

ofwhom hadparticipated inapreviously conducted study [32].Second,
thedistribution ofstudents across thefiveprofiles wasuneven, though a
minimum oftwostudents perprofile were included. Third, onestudent
(student 10)didnotparticipate intheExperience room experiment,
reducing thesample sizeforthecomparative analysis to14students.
While perceptual assessments supported theacoustical preferences
associated with each profile, thesmall sample sizelimits thegeneral-
isation ofthese findings. Fourth, themeasured SPLofthesame sound
type differed between theearbuds (direct exposure) andthespeakers
(indirect exposure) which might berelated thatsounds intheExperience
room diffused andabsorbed within theroom. Fifth, thesound conditions
ofboth experiments were notrandomised among thedifferent groups of
students duetothesmall sample sizepergroup (3or4students) and
only four groups. Finally, thebodily responses data were calculated as
mean values forthetwo-minute exposure time rather than thereal-time
measurements persecond duetothelimitations oftheGarmin smart-
watch thatexports theHRandRRdata pertwo-minutes.
4.3.Implications andfutureresearch
Theinterpretation ofthekeyfindings ofthisstudy (asdetailed in
Section 4.1)provides insights forfuture researchers inthedesign and
set-up ofsound exposure experiments aimed atinvestigating partici-
pants ’bodily responses toandperceptual assessments ofsounds.
First, theaudiometric testisacritical procedure with thepotential to
elucidate participants ’bodily responses and perceptual assessments
when exposed tospecific sound types. Second, profiling participants (e.
g.,students) based ontheir acoustical preferences could provide aclear
understanding oftheir perceptual assessments ofdifferent sounds.
Third, HRandRRarereliable androbust indicators ofbodily responses
that can beeffectively measured using simple wearable devices,
demonstrating clear reactions toshort-term sound exposure. Lastly,
given thelack ofstrong orsignificant correlations between bodily re-
sponses andperceptual assessments, itisimperative toconsider both
independently insound exposure research.
Because ofthesample sizelimitations asthisisafollow-up study ofa
specific pool ofstudents, itisrecommended forfuture research torecruit
atleast 26students perprofile (ofwhich thepower level is1-β0.8,as
indicated byPark etal.[48]).This could better present theresults per
profile rather than perindividual, such asperforming thecorrelations
between thebodily responses andperceptual assessments perprofile and
testing whether theprofile isasignificant variable. Furthermore, itis
recommended forfuture sound exposure experiments torandomise the
sound conditions toacquire comprehensive results inexplaining how
bodily responses canbeused toexplain differences insound perceptions
andpreferences. Given thefactthattheHRandRRshowed nosignifi-
cant differences between thetwoexperiments, itisencouraged toalso
measure them inareal-life situation, such asarealstudy place.
5.Conclusion
This study conducted two sound exposure experiments with 15
university students from five profiles who differ intheir acoustical
preferences oftheir study places. Each experiment included four bodily
responses (AL, MRL, HR, and RR) and five perceptual assessments
(acceptability, pleasantness, stress level, andnoise level), while students
were exposed tofoursound types varying infrequencies andSPLs intwodifferent settings. Thekeyfindings aresummarised asfollows:
1.Therelationship between hearing acuity andbodily responses (such
asHR) andsound perception seems tobeessential forbetter un-
derstanding how ourbody responds tosound. Itwasobserved that
although students suffered from mild hearing lossinlowfrequency,
their bodies physiologically responded when they were exposed toa
low-frequency sound condition.
2.Theoutcomes from thisstudy showed thattheperceptual assessment
inalabexperiment setting confirmed theacoustical preferences of
thefiveprofiles ofuniversity students.
3.This study found thatboth HRandRRwere notstrongly norsignif-
icantly correlated with perceptual assessments during direct sound
exposure inthetestchamber. HRwas strongly and significantly
related totheperceptual assessment ofnoise level intheExperience
room.
4.Both HRandRRshowed nosignificant differences between thetwo
experiments ofthisstudy. This implies that they arereliable for
explaining acoustical preferences andcanbemeasured inrealen-
vironments aswellsince they showed nodifferences between thetwo
settings: alaboratory setting intestchambers andasemi-real life
room setting intheExperience room. Incontrast, ALandMRL were
affected bytheexperimental setting andprocedure inthisstudy,
which could bemore reliable foralonger sound exploration ofex-
periments and/or involve performance tasks.
