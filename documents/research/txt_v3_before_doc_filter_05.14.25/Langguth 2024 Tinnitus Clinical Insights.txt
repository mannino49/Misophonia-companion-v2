Abstract
Tinnitus, the perception of sound without a corresponding external sound source, and tinnitus disorder, which is tinnitus 
with associated suffering, present a multifaceted clinical challenge due to its heterogeneity and its incompletely understood 
pathophysiology and especially due to the limited therapeutic options. In this narrative review, we give an overview on 
various clinical aspects of tinnitus including its heterogeneity, contributing factors, comorbidities and therapeutic pathways 
with a specific emphasis on the implications for its pathophysiology and future research directions. Tinnitus exhibits high 
perceptual variability between affected individuals (heterogeneity) and within affected individuals (temporal variability). 
Hearing loss emerges as predominant risk factor and the perceived pitch corresponds to areas of hearing loss, supporting the 
compensatory response theory. Whereas most people who have tinnitus can live a normal life, in 10–20% tinnitus interferes 
severely with quality of life. These patients suffer frequently from comorbidities such as anxiety, depression or insomnia, 
acting as both risk factors and consequences. Accordingly, neuroimaging studies demonstrate shared brain networks between 
tinnitus and stress-related disorders shedding light on the intricate interplay of mental health and tinnitus. The challenge 
lies in deciphering causative relationships and shared pathophysiological mechanisms. Stress, external sounds, time of day, 
head movements, distraction, and sleep quality can impact tinnitus perception. Understanding these factors provides insights 
into the interplay with autonomic, sensory, motor, and cognitive processes. Counselling and cognitive-behavioural therapy 
demonstrate efficacy in reducing suffering, supporting the involvement of stress and anxiety-related networks. Hearing 
improvement, especially through cochlear implants, reduces tinnitus and thus indirectly validates the compensatory nature 
of tinnitus. Brain stimulation techniques can modulate the suffering of tinnitus, presumably by alteration of stress-related 
brain networks. Continued research is crucial for unravelling the complexities of tinnitus. Progress in management hinges on 
decoding diverse manifestations, identifying treatment-responsive subtypes, and advancing targeted therapeutic approaches.

Introduction
The Relevance of Clinical Observations
Historically, progress in medicine usually begins with a 
comprehensive description of clinical symptoms and their 
definition. In a next step, commonly occurring symptoms 
are grouped into syndromes and pathophysiological mod-
els are developed based on their features. This process is 
supported by histological and anatomical research as well 
as by imaging, laboratory and genetic studies, to identify 
structural correlates of the clinical syndromes. Pathophysi-
ological models form the basis for the development of thera -
peutic approaches. In many cases, therapeutic effects have 
been discovered by chance, e.g. in the case of neuroleptics. 
These serendipitous discoveries provide further hints for  * Berthold Langguth

understanding the pathophysiology of a particular disorder. 
Thus, from a historical perspective, clinical observations 
form the basis for the development of pathophysiological 
models which in turn serve for a better understanding of a 
disease or a disorder.
Pathophysiological Models of Tinnitus
With respect to tinnitus, it is frequently stated that its patho-
physiology is incompletely understood. Indeed, there exist 
many pathophysiological models of tinnitus (which are not 
mutually exclusive), but none of them can comprehensively 
explain all relevant clinical aspects of tinnitus. The Periph-
eral Model involves dysfunction in the auditory periphery, 
such as damage to the cochlea or auditory nerve. This can 
lead to abnormal spontaneous neural activity, interpreted 
by the brain as sound [1 ]. The Central Model focuses on 
changes in central auditory pathways, triggered by reduced 
auditory input. These changes may involve neurotransmit-
ter imbalances as well as increased neuronal activity and 
synchrony [2 ]. In addition to altered activity in the brain’s 
auditory processing centres, there are activity and connec-
tivity alterations in non-auditory networks, particularly in 
salience—emotion processing—and executive networks [3 , 
4, 6]. The Gating Model combines these models by postulat-
ing that tinnitus emerges, when there is increased activity 
in central auditory pathways together with a frontostriatal 
inhibitory deficit, which would normally prevent the sig-
nal to reach conscious perception [5 ]. The Somatosensory 
Model is focusing on abnormal interactions between the 
auditory and somatosensory systems which finally result 
in increased neuronal activity in central auditory pathways 
[7]. Most recently also an Inflammatory Model [ 8] has been 
proposed as an explanation for the emergence of tinnitus. In 
addition to these pathophysiological models, there exist also 
Psychological Models [ 9] and Models based on Perception 
Theory [ 10, 11].
Heterogeneity of Tinnitus
The question arises why a condition such as tinnitus with 
a high prevalence [12] and high socioeconomic relevance 
[13] is still a mystery today. The search for explanations 
for this unsatisfactory situation almost always leads to the 
fact that tinnitus is a far from homogeneous clinical entity 
[14, 15]. Etiologic factors and triggers vary from patient 
to patient, but perceptual aspects, comorbidities, burden, 
modifying factors and response to therapeutic interven-
tions also vary widely. A generally valid pathophysiologi-
cal model must take this variability into account or at least 
explain the characteristics of clearly defined, distinct sub-
types. Since such pathophysiological models do not yet 
exist, it also remains a matter of debate whether there is a “final common pathophysiological pathway” or, in other 
words, pathophysiological alterations that can be found in 
every single tinnitus patient, or whether there are different 
forms of tinnitus with different pathophysiological changes 
that may not overlap at all. For both scenarios, there exist 
examples in medicine. Schizophrenia is a disorder, which 
varies highly in its clinical course and its symptomatology. 
However, pharmacological blockade of dopamine receptors 
can reduce clinical symptoms in almost all cases, indicating 
that the dysregulation of dopaminergic pathways represents 
a common pathway that is relevant for all forms of schizo-
phrenia. In contrary in headache differentiation in subtypes 
has been essential for successful treatment. The International 
Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) lists more than 
200 subtypes and there exist specific treatments for these 
various subtypes. Migraine, tension type headache, cluster 
headache or trigeminal neuralgia—just to name a few—can 
be best treated by completely different treatment regimes.
In this perspective article, we will discuss various clinical 
aspects of tinnitus and the insights into pathophysiological 
mechanisms that we can derive from these clinical phenom-
ena. We will also discuss those clinical aspects, which are 
currently still incompletely understood as these latter ones 
provide hints in which direction future research should be 
directed.
Etiological Factors
According to a recent systematic review [16], hearing loss, 
occupational noise exposure, otitis media, ototoxic medica-
tion and depression were identified as main risk factors for 
the development of tinnitus.
Hearing Loss
These findings confirm that deprivation of auditory input 
is the most relevant risk factor for the development of tin-
nitus [1 ]. This notion is also supported by the finding that 
the laterality and frequency of tinnitus typically correspond 
with the hearing loss [17, 18]. For example, a patient with 
a left-sided hearing loss at a frequency of 4 kHz typically 
perceives his tinnitus as a 4 kHz tone on the left side. How -
ever, not everybody with hearing loss develops tinnitus and 
not all patients with tinnitus experience hearing loss. It is 
controversial whether tinnitus patients with normal hearing 
thresholds really have completely normal hearing or whether 
they have a form of hearing impairment that remains unde-
tected by the standard audiogram that samples only 8 fre-
quencies out of the human auditory spectrum, which ranges 
from about 20 Hz till 20 kHz. Studies on such subjects have 
shown that they may have hearing loss in the ultra-high 
frequency range, which is not routinely sampled [19, 20],

Tinnitus: Clinical Insights in Its Pathophysiology...hearing loss between tested frequencies [21] or damage 
to high threshold auditory nerve fibres [22]. An alterna-
tive explanation for hearing loss without tinnitus is a delay 
between the onset of hearing loss and the onset of tinnitus. In 
this case, cross-sectional studies will always detect patients 
with hearing loss—but without tinnitus. We will need large 
longitudinal data sets and to follow up patients with hearing 
loss to learn how many of them will develop tinnitus—and 
after how many years this happens. Furthermore, the lack -
ing one-to-one correlation between hearing loss and tinnitus 
points to additional factors, which might play a role.
The Somatosensory System
There are several lines of evidence that indicate the involve-
ment of the somatosensory system. First, the majority of 
tinnitus patients can modulate their tinnitus by moving their 
head [23]. Second, there is an increased tinnitus prevalence 
among patients with temporomandibular joint disorder, and 
in a subset of patients, the onset of tinnitus is triggered by 
neck trauma, such as whiplash injury [24]. Animal research 
has contributed to the identification of the pathophysiologi-
cal mechanisms by demonstrating that altered input from the 
somatosensory system can influence activity in central audi -
tory pathways via C2 and trigeminal afferents, which interact 
with auditory input at the dorsal cochlear nucleus [7 ].
Multimodal Interactions
The somatosensory modulation of tinnitus perception and 
the co-occurrence of tinnitus with different kinds of pain 
[25–27] suggest that some form of multimodal processing 
may be required for tinnitus generation and or tinnitus main-
tenance [11]. In other words, “When I see a bird that walks 
like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, 
I call that bird a duck” [28]. This may imply that missing 
auditory input may be compensated for by somatosensory 
inputs based on the duck test mechanism [11]. Intriguingly, 
not only the somatosensory system may be involved in tin-
nitus. Visual snow, the visual analogue of tinnitus [29], is 
comorbid with tinnitus [30], and cataract is a risk factor 
for tinnitus [31]. This suggests that possibly not only the 
somatosensory system is involved in tinnitus generation but 
in some patients the visual system may influence it. And 
similarly, the vestibular system may be involved. Indeed, in 
1000 patients presenting at an otology clinic, tinnitus was 
present in 70%, imbalance in about 25%, otalgia and aural 
fullness in about 20%, with more than one symptom occur -
ring in 25% of patients [32, 33]. The comorbidity of tinnitus 
and vestibular systems is most outspoken in Meniere’s dis-
ease, in which tinnitus and vertigo are part of the diagnostic 
criteria [34, 35].Depression and Anxiety
Depression is another risk factor for tinnitus [36] and even 
more so in tinnitus with comorbid symptoms. In Meniere’s 
disease, a meta-analysis has shown that the prevalence of 
depression is close to a staggering 50% [37]. Similarly, 
anxiety is associated with tinnitus [38 ]. This suggests an 
overlap of brain networks associated with tinnitus, anxiety 
and depression or that tinnitus and comorbid symptoms can 
trigger activation of depression networks [6 , 39–41]. Pre-
sumably, these are the hippocampal–cortical memory system 
[11], the default mode network, the frontoparietal control 
system and brain areas for salience and emotion processing 
[3, 42]. The involvement of these structures might reflect the 
conscious perception of tinnitus, the attention to it, its sali-
ence and the associated distress [4 , 42]; in other words, the 
unified tinnitus percept may result from multiple, parallel, 
overlapping and interacting networks [6 ]. If this model is 
correct then every aspect of the unified tinnitus percept may 
be related to one network, e.g. loudness to auditory-memory-
salience network [43– 45], arousal/distress to central auto-
nomic networks that overlap with the salience network[46, 
47] and depression to salience-emotional networks [48]. The 
interaction between the separate networks may subsequently 
result in the unified tinnitus percept that may vary depend-
ing on changes of the within and between network interac-
tions/connectivity, which might explain—at least to some 
extent—the temporal variability of the tinnitus percept.
Multifactorial Aetiology
Our knowledge about etiological factors and the mechanisms 
by which they cause tinnitus has increased considerably over 
the last decades. However, many aspects are still unknown, 
especially the question of what exactly triggers the onset of 
tinnitus in a particular patient. To put it in another way, why 
does hearing loss lead to tinnitus in some patients and not 
in others? Many people suffer from hearing loss, and pos-
sibly a second factor may be essential as alluded to before: 
somatosensory, visual or vestibular modulation.
Yet, other risk factors exist, such as stress, whether psy -
chological or physical stressors, that may be involved in the 
generation and maintenance of tinnitus [49, 50]. Also trauma 
to the auditory system is a risk factor, whether a physical 
trauma [24 ], noise exposure [51 –53], drugs (tobacco [ 54], 
cannabis [55], heavy alcohol [16]) or medication (antibiot-
ics, antitumor agents, NSAID, salicylate, antidepressants, 
ACE inhibitors [56, 57]), and toxins (chromium, cadmium, 
manganese)[58].
Thus, tinnitus may result from a multifactorial process, 
a consequence from multiple small accumulating risk fac -
tors. Clinically, we indeed often find combinations of such 
risk factors in individuals with tinnitus and assume that the

Langguth et al.
various risks may accumulate in individual cases. Neverthe-
less, it is impossible to predict whether a person with these 
risk factors develops tinnitus or not, if and when the person 
develops tinnitus, and how burdensome the tinnitus will be.
Relevance of Aetiological Factors for Tinnitus 
Management
In the clinical management of tinnitus patients, one should 
try to identify and modify the risk factors that may have 
contributed to the onset of tinnitus. In rare cases, the suc-
cessful treatment of the risk factor may cure tinnitus (e.g. in 
patients receiving a cochlear implant in case of deafness [59, 
60]). In many other cases, tinnitus burden can be lowered by 
specific interventions (e.g. hearing aids that compensate for 
the hearing loss[61]); in some cases, the risk factor treatment 
has a clear beneficial effect only during the acute phase and 
sometimes it has no effect at all. These observations suggest 
that there may be additional, so far unknown factors that play 
a role in the development of tinnitus and that mechanisms 
involved in the maintenance of tinnitus may differ from the 
mechanisms relevant for the onset. The natural history of 
tinnitus does show that once tinnitus is present it is likely 
to remain in 80% of patients, with 20% of patients having a 
complete spontaneous resolution within 4 years [62]. Among 
those who still have tinnitus, 10% worsen, 10% improve and 
80% remain unchanged [62]. This suggests that the tinnitus 
generating network may change over time [63], potentially 
making it more difficult to alter when it has become chronic. 
It has indeed been suggested that once the tinnitus is present 
for 4 years it may become more difficult to treat [64– 66]. 
Hypothetically, this is assumed to be related to the fact that 
the tinnitus becomes linked to the self-perceptual default 
mode network, i.e. the tinnitus becomes part of one’s self-
identity [42].
Perceptual Variability
Tonal or Noise‑Like Tinnitus
There is a high perceptual variability of tinnitus. Tinnitus 
can be perceived as whistling, buzzing, chirping, hissing, 
humming, roaring, or even shrieking, with the same tone 
or with different tones or a combination of tones and noise. 
It has been hypothesised that tonal tinnitus is related to 
increased activity in the classical pathways (also known as 
lemniscal pathways) and the noise-like tinnitus is related 
to increased activation in the non-classical (extralemniscal) 
pathways [67, 68]. While the classical pathways encode the 
tinnitus frequency accurately, the extralemniscal pathways 
process the signal faster, but less accurately and are closely 
connected with non-auditory areas, e.g. the amygdala or the insula [69]. However, there is little experimental evidence 
to support this hypothesis [67, 70, 71].
Tinnitus Localisation
Tinnitus can be perceived unilaterally (about 45%), bilat-
erally (about 45%) or non-lateralised (about 10%) [72]. 
This variability can at least be partially explained in case 
of unilateral hearing loss. In this case, tinnitus is typically 
on the side of the hearing loss, which supports the theory of 
deafferentiation. In many cases, however, it remains unclear 
what predicts tinnitus localisation, especially in patients who 
experience the tinnitus inside their head. Moreover, some 
patients have difficulties localising their tinnitus or report 
that the localisation changes over time. Furthermore, several 
studies have demonstrated that the perceived tinnitus pitch 
corresponds to the area of the most pronounced hearing loss 
[17, 18]. This finding supports the theory of tinnitus as a 
phantom sound, resulting from the brain’s effort to compen-
sate for the lack of auditory input [73]. Moreover, it suggests 
that tinnitus generation is mediated by a lack of feed forward 
inhibition, as a lack of lateral inhibition would result in a 
tinnitus pitch at the edge frequency between normal hearing 
and hearing loss [74].
Pulsatile Tinnitus
A pulsatile, pulse-synchronous tinnitus character is sug-
gestive of abnormal blood flow, either due to a vascular 
abnormality (e.g. stenosis, av-fistula or malformation) or by 
increased blood flow (e.g. anaemia) or, less commonly, a 
microvascular conflict [75, 76]. However, in many patients 
who report pulse synchronous pulsatile tinnitus, no such 
abnormalities can be detected. A possible explanation is that 
these people might be particularly sensitive to body sounds 
and therefore even perceive sounds generated by regular 
blood flow and consequently transmitted to the inner ear 
via bone conduction [ 77]. Moreover, the transmission of 
body sounds to the cochlea could be facilitated by increased 
intracranial pressure [78].
Variability of Tinnitus over Time
Some patients mention that tinnitus changes pitch and 
intensity over time which can be traced by a tinnitus 
tracker that demonstrate these changes may result from 
behavioural and emotional factors during the same or the 
previous day [79]. Also, other forms of temporal variabil-
ity have been reported, e.g. related to sleep. Patients dis-
playing sleep-modulated tinnitus have deteriorated sleep 
quality, and the tinnitus changes may be related to REM-
sleep impairment [80]. Not uncommonly a regular 3- or 
4-day sawtooth pattern is expressed, in which 2 bad days

Tinnitus: Clinical Insights in Its Pathophysiology...are systematically followed by one good day without obvi-
ous influencing factors. Up to now, no satisfying explana-
tion for these latter phenomena has been proposed.
Comorbidities
Comorbidities: Risk Factor or a Consequence 
of Tinnitus
Tinnitus is associated with many comorbidities. These 
comorbidities in turn are an important aspect of tinnitus 
as they are of great importance for the individual burden 
of disease [81], but are also important as starting point for 
the therapeutic management. Some of them may repre -
sent risk factors (e.g. hearing loss), others may be conse-
quences (e.g. difficulties concentrating) and some may be 
both (e.g. depression or anxiety). It is not always possible 
to distinguish the extent to which a comorbidity is a risk 
factor or a consequence of tinnitus, but regardless, there is 
likely to be an overlap of pathophysiological mechanisms. 
For example, insomnia is the most distressing comorbid-
ity for many (60%) tinnitus patients [82, 83] and there is 
much overlap in the mechanisms of psychophysiological 
insomnia and tinnitus [ 9]. Moreover, tinnitus-associated 
emotional and cognitive distress and somatic complaints 
relate to insomnia [84, 85].
Hyperacusis, Misophonia and Phonophobia
The frequent combination of tinnitus with hyperacusis 
[86, 87] suggests that both disorders may be related by an 
increased gain in central auditory pathways [88]. In the 
case of misophonia, the common pathway might be the 
mechanism, which generates the aversive character of spe-
cific sounds [89, 90], whereas in phonophobia, fear of loud 
sounds is the common denominator [90]. Some, but not all, 
studies [91, 92] suggest an increased risk of arterial hyper -
tension among tinnitus patients, which might be an indicator 
of increased sympathetic activation, which is in keeping with 
stress as modulating tinnitus [46, 50, 93].
Tinnitus and Pain
Tinnitus is also related to various headache syndromes 
[26, 94], as well as temporomandibular pain and cervical 
pain [95], but also fibromyalgia [27]. Comorbidity with 
pain syndromes can be explained by shared peripheral (C2 
and trigeminal nerve) [96, 97] and central mechanisms of 
chronic pain and chronic tinnitus [3 , 11, 98–101].Amount of Tinnitus Suffering
Tinnitus with associated suffering is defined as tinnitus 
disorder [99], i.e. a pathology in its own right, and not a 
symptom associated with another pathology. The extent 
to which tinnitus affects or distresses varies from per -
son to person. Most people with tinnitus are not severely 
impaired by their tinnitus [102]. On the other hand, 20% 
of people with tinnitus are severely disturbed in all aspects 
of their life and may even be suicidal [103]. Knowledge 
about the factors that determine tinnitus severity is incom-
plete. Age, hearing difficulties, sleep problems, work noise 
exposure, ototoxic medication, and neuroticism determine 
whether someone develops bothersome tinnitus or not [62, 
85]. People with high scores on neuroticism scales are 
more severely impaired [104– 107], and sex also plays a 
role with women being more likely to suffer from severe 
tinnitus [12, 85]. Perceptual characteristics of the tinnitus 
gestalt, such as tinnitus loudness or tinnitus pitch, appear 
to play a role as well [108– 110]. However, all the factors 
mentioned explain only to a small extent the degree of tin -
nitus suffering. From a neurobiological perspective, it is 
assumed that high level of distress and high level of tinni-
tus burden are reflected by a co-activation of stress-related 
brain networks [3 ], but here too it remains unclear what 
determines whether these networks are co-activated or not.
Tinnitus Modifying Factors
Tinnitus Modification by Sounds
In the vast majority of patients, tinnitus is modified by vari-
ous factors. Apart from stress and emotions modifying tin-
nitus [111], the change caused by external sounds is the most 
investigated. Sounds can mask the tinnitus and the masking 
effect can outlast the stimulation period. This phenomenon 
is known as residual inhibition, varies from patient to patient 
and depends on the type of sound [112– 114]. In general, 
sounds similar to the tinnitus sound are more efficient for 
masking and triggering a silent period [112– 114]. These 
effects can be well explained by the concept that tinnitus is 
an expression of central disinhibition resulting from reduced 
feed forward inhibition because of reduced auditory input. 
An increase in input, in turn, leads to an increase of feed 
forward inhibition and reduces the tinnitus perception. How -
ever, sounds do not always reduce tinnitus. Many patients 
report that certain sounds increase their tinnitus. Whether 
a sound reduces or increases an individual’s tinnitus may 
depend on the type of the sound and its loudness and may 
vary from person to person.

Langguth et al.
Tinnitus Modification by Head, Neck or Face 
Movements
Similarly, manoeuvres of the head, neck or face can modu-
late the tinnitus percept in many people with tinnitus. This 
phenomenon is considered as expression of the interaction 
between the somatosensory and the auditory system [7 ].
Tinnitus Modification by Attention and Stress
Tinnitus perception can also be reduced by distraction. Most 
patients with tinnitus report that the tinnitus fades into the 
background, when they focus their attention on activity. 
Imaging studies have shown that tinnitus reduction via dis-
traction is related to reduced neuronal activity in the audi-
tory cortex [115]. Some patients report that the intensity of 
tinnitus increases in stressful situations [49, 93]. This can 
be explained by a general enhancement of alertness to sen-
sory signals under sympathetic activation. However, not all 
persons experience the same situation in the same way. A 
recent example for this was the COVID-19 pandemic where 
some tinnitus patients perceived the situation as stressful 
and described an increasing tinnitus, while others perceived 
less stress during the pandemic and reported a decrease of 
tinnitus loudness [106].
Tinnitus Modification by Sleep
Less understood is the modulating effect of sleep [ 84]. Many 
tinnitus patients report that their tinnitus during the day 
depends on the quality of their sleep the night before. The 
better the sleep at night, the lower the intensity of the tinni-
tus [80]. In contrast, napping during the day exacerbates tin-
nitus in a subgroup of patients. The mechanisms underlying 
these observations are still unclear and may be elucidated by 
systematic polysomnography studies in these patients [116].
Response to Treatment
Heterogeneity in Response to Treatments
Many different treatments have been investigated for tinnitus 
[117]. Most treatment studies found no significant difference 
between the intervention group and the control group and 
were therefore considered negative. In most of these studies, 
however, the response to treatment was highly heterogene-
ous. This means that some study participants responded pos -
itively to the intervention, even though most others showed a 
negative response. It is obvious that it would be highly desir -
able to identify distinct tinnitus subtypes that respond well 
to specific treatments or at least to find reliable criteria that 
can predict the outcome of a specific intervention. A first step in this direction was made by analysing self-reported 
effects of various therapeutic interventions in a large sample. 
This study has shown that response to certain treatments 
predicts the outcome of other treatments [118]. This result 
is the proof that there exist tinnitus subtypes that differ in 
their response to specific treatments. This also means that 
treatment response can be improved by patient subtyping. 
Based on these findings, decision support systems are cur -
rently being developed to help clinicians to select treatment 
based on individual patient characteristics [15].
Counselling and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
The results from specific treatments also provide clues for 
a better understanding of the pathophysiology of tinnitus. 
Most established in tinnitus treatment are counselling and 
cognitive behavioural therapy. It is likely that both methods 
work via similar mechanisms, namely by improving cog-
nitive control and reducing dysfunctional behaviours. This 
in turn indicates that neuronal activity and connectivity in 
stress- and anxiety-related networks in tinnitus patients can 
be modulated by cognitive control and unlearned by behav -
ioural training.
Hearing Aids and Cochlear Implants
In tinnitus patients with hearing loss, a therapeutic improve-
ment of hearing also leads to tinnitus reduction, both by 
hearing aids [61] and cochlear implants [119, 120]. This 
finding clearly supports the concept that tinnitus results 
from the brain’s effort to compensate for the reduced audi-
tory input. The effect is most pronounced with cochlear 
implants [59], which can be explained by the fact that coch-
lear implants provide input to deafferentiated auditory nerve 
fibres. Other forms of hearing improvement, such as middle 
ear surgery or hearing aids, improve hearing by increasing 
sound pressure levels in the inner ear, but cannot reactivate 
deafferentiated neurons. Accordingly, their effect on tin-
nitus is significantly less pronounced compared to cochlea 
implants [121].
Pharmacological Treatment
The transient suppression of tinnitus after intravenous lido-
caine suggests that tinnitus can be effectively addressed 
pharmacologically [122]. Unfortunately, the side effects of 
lidocaine do not allow its long-term use and no other drug 
has shown comparable efficacy. In cases where no effective 
drug targets have been identified in clinical trials, studies in 
animal models of tinnitus suggest the involvement of potas-
sium channels and the GABA-ergic as well the glutamatergic 
system [123]. Some insights into the molecular mechanisms

Tinnitus: Clinical Insights in Its Pathophysiology...of tinnitus also come from the information collected on 
drugs, which may induce tinnitus as side effects [56].
Brain Stimulation and Neuromodulation
Various forms of brain stimulation have been tested and 
have demonstrated that stimulation of single targets (e.g. 
the auditory cortex or the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or 
the anterior cingulate) has rather limited efficacy [ 124]. 
More promising results are provided from recent efforts with 
bimodal stimulation, consisting of a combination of sound 
stimulation and electrical stimulation of somatosensory 
afferents. This approach has shown considerable improve-
ments of tinnitus in several studies [125– 128]. These find-
ings can be interpreted as indirect support for the idea that 
tinnitus is related to abnormalities in different interacting 
brain networks [6 , 42]. In similar vein, it can be considered 
that a pharmacological approach that considers a cocktail 
of medications targeting multiple different neurotransmitter 
receptors and/or ion channels [129] may be the analogue of 
multimodal neuromodulation.
Conclusion
Many clinical aspects of tinnitus are still incompletely 
understood and cannot be fully explained by current patho-
physiological models. Further research should focus on a 
precise clinical characterisation of these aspects and on their 
neurophysiological basis to gain more detailed insights into 
the pathophysiology of the different tinnitus subtypes as 
well as on potential treatment targets. This might help to 
elucidate whether there exists a final common pathway of 
the various forms of tinnitus that can be therapeutically tar -
geted or whether different treatment approaches for various 
subtypes are the more promising approach.
Considering that single pharmacological and single ana-
tomical targets do only yield limited beneficial effects for 
tinnitus, it can be conceived that pharmacological strate-
gies focussing on multiple targets or multimodal neuro-
modulation approaches or a combination of medication, 
neuromodulation and auditory approaches may be superior 
treatment approaches. The superiority of such a combina-
tional approach may either be based on synergistic action 
or simply on the shotgun principle, as the combination of 
several therapies increases the chance that the right therapy 
is included.
