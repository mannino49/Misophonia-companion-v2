## Abstract

Misophonia  is  a  neurobehavioral  condition  characterised  by  an  intolerance  to  specific  stimuli, resulting in an extreme physiological and emotional response. The condition is still largely unexplored; however, its study is gaining more interest in the literature.  In the past few years, questionnaires assessing misophonia have been devised and implemented to study this population. Each existing questionnaire, scale, and assessment tool approach misophonia in very different ways. The aim of this study is to develop a new psychometric scale to measure misophonia as a trait, by synthesising many different aspects of this condition  Development of this psychometric tool aims to help researchers measure the trait, study its characteristics, their severity and discriminant ability, as well as to explore potential associations of the condition with other traits and/or disorders. This manuscript presents the new tool and summarises the methodology followed in its development and the research strategy for its evaluation.

## Introduction

Misophonia is a condition characterised by a decreased tolerance to specific stimuli, resulting in an intense  physiological  and  affective  response  (Jatreboff  &amp;  Jatreboff,  2001;  Schröder  et  al.,  2013; Edelstein, Brang et al., 2013). Stimuli typically include repetitive sounds produced by humans (Jager, de  Koning  et  al,  2020),  but  individuals  also  report  decreased  tolerance  to  environmental  and mechanical sounds (Edelstein et al 2013; Hansen et al, under review), as well as hypersensitivity to visual, tactile and olfactory stimuli (Wu, Lewin et al 2014). Individuals with misophonia report impaired functioning in work, study, leisure and relationships (Edelstein et al., 2013; Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff, 2002; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018; Schröder et al., 2013; Wu, Lewin, Murphy, &amp; Storch, 2014).

Individuals with misophonia have described experiencing sounds as invasive, offensive and insulting. Qualitative data has identified appraisals directed at the source of the sound, such as rudeness or thoughtlessness, feelings of shame and embarrassment at their own reaction to sounds and a sense of failure and sadness about the impact of the condition on their lives (Edelstein et al 2013; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018). Perceived loss of control (Jager et al 2020) and a fear of physical outbursts (Reid, Guzick et al., 2016) have also been reported. Further research is warranted to explore the frequency of  these  appraisals  and  whether  they  are  associated  with  misophonia  severity  and  behavioural response. Improved understanding of appraisals may shed light on the relevance of context to the misophonic response, for example a more intense reaction towards close  family members  or the absence of a response to sounds when made by animals or children (Edelstein et al 2013; Jager et al 2020).

Coping strategies for misophonia include avoidance and leaving situations, blocking sounds with music or earplugs, anticipating sounds, and verbal aggression (Edelstein et al 2013; Jager et al 2020; Rouw and Erfanian 2017). Jager et al (2020) reported that aggressive outbursts were mild relative to the aggressive nature of thoughts experienced during a misophonic reaction. Two studies (Wu et al 2014; Zhou, Wu et al 2017) found that the positive correlation between anger outbursts and misophonia severity was significantly mediated by anxiety, with outbursts measured by the Rage Outbursts and Anger Rating Scale (ROARS), which is not specific to the context of misophonia. Misophonic subjects have been found to have higher self-reported anxiety sensitivity (McKay, Kim et al 2018) and higher awareness of internal body states (Kumar et al 2017) than non-misophonic controls. Further research is needed to build on these findings and to establish whether treatments targeting interoceptive and anxiety sensitivity could reduce outbursts in misophonia. Such research would benefit from a measure of outbursts specific to misophonia.

Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2002) proposed that the misophonic response is the result of heightened connectivity between the auditory, limbic and autonomic systems. Edelstein et al. (2013) used skin conductance response (SCR) to measure sympathetic nervous system activation whilst listening to misophoni c 'trigger' sounds. They found a positive correlation between subjective aversiveness and SCR in both the misophonic and control groups. The two groups were similar in their reports of which sounds they found aversive and non-aversive, with a heightened subjective aversion rating and SCR in the  misophonia  group.  Kumar  et  al  (2017)  also  found  a  heightened  physiological  response  in  a misophonic group compared to controls, as measured using heart rate and galvanic skin response (GSR). In a mediation analysis, they found that the relation between group status (i.e. misophonia or control) and physiological response to trigger sounds was mediated by brain activity in the anterior insula cortex (AIC), an area of the brain that is key in the processing the salience of internal bodily states (interoception). This study, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), found that the heightened AIC activity was present with misophonic sounds (e.g. eating) but not 'unpleasant sounds' (e.g. person screaming). They also found increased functional connectivity between the AIC and core parts of the default mode network, which activate during memory retrieval, in misophonic subjects during  misophonic  sounds.  This  connectivity  may  provide  a  brain  basis  representation  of  the subjective reports of the relevance of context in response to sounds (Edelstein et al 2013; Jager et al 2020). Vivid memories of childhood misophonic episodes have been reported (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018)  and  further  research  is  warranted  to  explore  whether  memories  could  be  targeted  using imagery rescripting (ImRs) as a means of reducing the misophonic response, as is increasingly used as a therapeutic technique in anxiety and obsessive compulsive and related disorders (Arntz, 2012). The results of these neurophysiological studies were in line with a subsequent imaging study (Schroeder, van Wingen et al, 2019), which also reported a subjective increase in the emotions of anger, disgust and sadness in response to misophonic sounds by misophonic participants compared with controls. Taken  together,  these  studies  indicated  that  the  subjective  emotional  response  and  higher physiological response to misophonic triggers could in part be the result of the meaning applied to trigger sounds and to interoceptive experiences in response to sounds. An appropriate measure of the 'meaning' behind sounds and the misophonic response would be useful for future research .

There is no formally agreed categorisation nor diagnostic criteria for misophonia. A recent literature review  highlighted  the  challenge  of  effectively  categorising  this  phenomenon  (Brout  et  al  2018). Hypersensitivity to auditory stimuli occurs in numerous disorders within multiple disciplines including tinnitus,  hyperacusis  (Jastreboff  &amp;  Jastreboff,  2001;  2002),  autism  spectrum  disorder,  sensory processing disorders (Tavassoli, et al., 2017), and post-traumatic stress disorder (Morgan &amp; Grillon, 1999).  Misophonia  has  been  found  to  co-occur  with  obsessive-compulsive  personality  disorder (Schröder et al., 2013; Rouw &amp; Erfanian, 2018), obsessive-compulsive disorder (Schröder et al., 2013; Edelstein et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014), mood disorders, anxiety disorders (Wu et al., 2014; Rouw &amp; Erfanian,  2018),  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  attention  deficit  (hyperactivity)  disorder  (Rouw  &amp; Erfanian, 2018), and eating disorders (Kluckow, Telfer, &amp; Abraham, 2014; Rouw &amp; Erfanian, 2018), raising the question as to whether this is a transdiagnostic phenomenon or a stand-alone condition.

Schröder et al. (2013) suggested that misophonia be categorised as a discrete psychiatric condition and  proposed  diagnostic  criteria,  which  were  recently  revised  by  the  research  team  following  an observational study of 779 subjects with suspected misophonia (Jager et al 2020). Considering that these criteria were developed from observations of individuals referred to a psychiatric outpatient clinic,  it  is  likely  premature  to  adopt  the  psychiatric  categorisation  until  similar  studies  have  been completed in other settings where individuals may present with misophonia, e.g. audiology clinics or educational  settings,  and  repeated  on  samples  representative  of  the  general  population.  Robust psychometric measures of misophonia are needed for use in large scale studies and to identify suitable participants for structured clinical interview to support the categorisation of misophonia.

The  recent  rapid  increase  in  misophonia  research  has  highlighted  the  importance  of  a  robust multidimensional scale for measuring misophonia. A number of questionnaires have been developed for use in misophonia research, though none of these have been subjected to rigorous psychometric analysis  using  up  to  date  scientific  approaches.  The  two  used  most  frequently  in  the  misophonia literature are the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014) and the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S; Schröder et al, 2013), which are intended to measure the presence and severity of misophonia symptoms. Additional questionnaires in use include the recently published MisoQuest (Siepsiak  et  al.,  2020),  the  Misophonia  Assessment  Questionnaire  (MAQ;  Johnson,  2014)  and  two single item scales, The Misophonia Activation Scale (MAS-1; Fitzmaurice, 2010) and the Misophonia Physical Response Scale (MPRS; Bauman, 2015). A recent scoping review (Potgieter, MacDonald et al, 2019) identified other questionnaires for which there was no information available about the scale development or no reference identified. Only the MQ and MisoQuest have published psychometric properties available.

The MQ was tested in a study of 483 undergraduates. The MQ Total score ( Chronbach's alpha = .89) is  calculated  by  combining  the  first  two  sections  of  the  questionnaire,  the  7-item  Misophonia Symptom  Scale  (MSS;  =  0.86),  assessing  the  presence  of  specific  triggers,  and  the  10-item Misophonia Emotions and Behaviours Scale (MEBS;  = 0.86). Items are rated on a five-point ordinal scale, ranging from 0 (Not at all True / Never) to 4 (Always True / Always), with a total score of 0-68. Exploratory factor analysis identified a three-factor solution, with factors one and two made up of the MSS and MEBS items, respectively, and the third factor consisting of items cross-loading on the first two factors. The third section of the MQ, the Misophonia Severity Scale, was adapted for misophonia from the NIMH Global Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (NIMH GOCS; Murphy, Pickar &amp; Alterman, 1982; Wu et al., 2014). It is a single item rating the severity of sound sensitivity on a scale from 1 (minimal) to 15 (Very severe sound sensitivities), with a score greater than or equal to 7 indicating clinically significant symptoms. The initial psychometric assessment found satisfactory internal consistency and appropriate convergent and discriminant validity (Wu et al., 2014). Satisfactory internal consistency for the MQ was also found in a study of 415 students from two universities in China (Zhou, Wu, &amp; Storch, 2017). The authors acknowledge that further psychometric testing would be required for use in other populations (Wu et al, 2014). In a clinical setting, the MSS in particular may be limited in its capacity to capture meaningful change. The section asks 'In comparison to other people, I am sensitive to  the  sound  of…'  before  listing  the  7 trigger  sounds.  A  respondent  whose  sound  sensitivity  had reduced, but remained above average, may still consider it to be 'always true' that they are sensitive in comparison to other people, and thus the clinical improvement in symptoms may not be captured by these items.

The A-MISO-S (Schröder et al, 2013) was adapted from the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), an established clinician-rated tool for measuring severity of OCD symptoms. The A-MISO-S has  6  questions  which  address  different  aspect  of  misophonia,  including  time  spent  occupied  by misophonia, impact on functioning, distress, attempts to resist, perceived control over sounds and thoughts,  and  avoidance.  The  questions  are  discussed  with  the  patient  and  the  interviewer  uses clinical judgement to rate each item from 0 to 4, with a total possible score of 24. Schröder et al (2013) used the A-MISO-S as a clinician-rated tool, but it has also been used as a self-report tool in some research (Ci Quek, Ho et al, 2018), To our knowledge, the psychometric properties of the A-MISO-S have not been published.

A recently published questionnaire, MisoQuest (Siepsiak et al., 2020), was developed based on the proposed diagnostic criteria outlined by Schröder et al. (2013). The initial pool of 60 items was used for  the  first  sample  (N  =  383)  which  was  reduced  to  21  items  for  the  second  sample  (N  =  315). Exploratory Factor Analysis found the best fit was a single factor and graded response IRT models studied the discrimination ability of the items. The final version of MisoQuest contained 14 items and showed good internal consistency, test-retest reliability and  preliminary confirmation of  criterionrelated  validity.  The  tool  is  intended  to  screen  for  the  presence  of  misophonia  rather  than  as  a measure of symptom severity. As it is based on the Schröder (2013) diagnostic criteria, it is a reliable and valid tool for circumstances where those criteria are being used. The authors acknowledge that this means it may not effectively screen those who do not have anger as their immediate and core emotional reaction (for example, those who primarily experience disgust or feelings of panic).

The MAQ (Johnson, 2014) is a 63-items questionnaire with a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (almost all of the time). Questions focus on the emotional, social and functional impact of sound issues. The MAS-1 (Fitzmaurice, 2010) and the MPRS (Bauman, 2015) are both single item tools rating misophonia severity and intensity of physical reactions, respectively, from 0 to 10. Rouw and Erfanian (2018) found level 9 to be the most common reported rating on the MAS-1, a score that indicates extreme panic or rage with a conscious decision not to use violence, and level 8 on the MPRS, denoting a physical sensation equating to emotional pain. The psychometric properties for the MAQ, MAS-1 and the MPRS have not been published.

MisoQuest Siepsiak et al, 2020) is the only published misophonia questionnaire to have been through rigorous psychometric testing. It is appropriate for use as a screening tool where the Schröder (2013) diagnostic are being applied. The two most used measures for misophonia severity have not been subject to sufficient psychometric testing to be routinely used in research.

With misophonia research on the rise, it is vital to have a multidimensional, psychometrically sound tool for measuring the condition in both research and clinical settings. The aim of the present study was to develop a robust psychometric scale for misophonia, the Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Scale (S-Five). This study examines whether the emotions, behaviours, experiences and appraisals of individuals  with  misophonia  are  reliable  and  valid  manifestations  of  the  condition.  A  scale  that effectively measures misophonia will allow for vast improvements in the capacity to report on the condition  methodologically,  to  test  hypotheses  of  differences  between  groups,  and  to  examine correlations with other traits and co-occurring diagnoses. It will also serve as a clinical tool, assessing the severity for individuals and measuring progress of the misophonic experience over time and in response to intervention. The S-Five uses a reflective latent variable model, where each question is an indicator of the assumed underlying misophonia, in a consistent, methodological manner.

## Methods

## Sampling

Three waves of data collection were conducted between January 2019 and March 2020. At each wave we turned to the community of people identifying as having Misophonia and asked for their help to develop the S-Five. We posted to closed Misophonia Facebook groups (specifically UK Misophonia Support  Group,  Misophonia:  Coping  and  Solutions,  Misophonia  Support  Group  for  Adults  only, Misophonia Support Group, Misophonia Treatment Tracker, Misophonia International Support Group, Misophonia: Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome (4S), Misophonia &amp; Misokinesia Support Group, Misophonia Treatment and Management, Misophonia Support Group Australia, Misophonia Research Network, Misophonia-Research-Keeping up) and Reddit group (namely r/misophonia). We also posted to KCL-related and the researchers' personal social media to recruit individuals who do not necessarily identify or are aware of misophonia.  At the final, third wave, we used the Prolific.com site to recruit 800 individuals, representative of the UK general population. Inclusion criteria included being 18+ years old and fluent in English and exclusion criteria included diagnosis of severe intellectual/learning disability.

## Psychometric analyses

At the first stage of the psychometric evaluation pilot data were analysed to trace problematic items in terms of face validity, test-retest reliability and internal consistency. When required, certain items were  rephrased,  or  omitted.  New  items  were  also  added  under  the  consultation  of  the  clinical psychologist who joined the team (JG).

During  the  second  wave  of  sampling,  trigger  endorsement  was  studied  using  the  two  parametric logistic item response theory model (2PL-IRT; Baker, 2001) to evaluate the properties of the trigger endorsement. That is, we estimated each trigger's difficulty, discrimination ability and information.

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (EFA and CFA respectively) models were used to study the  factor  structure of  the  main  S-Five  scale.  The  general  population  and  the misophonia  specific samples were randomly divided in two split halves, one to be used in EFA and one in CFA when both methods were used.

Full reliability and validity assessment were conducted within each (potential) dimension and for the total scale. With respect to reliability, internal consistency was evaluated using classical test theory methods (alpha, alpha if item deleted, item total correlations, item rest correlations). Convergent concurrent validity was tested using the Misophonia Questionnaire and the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale.

## Results

## Data collection waves and S-Five versions

The  initial  pool  of  items  used  to  construct  the  S-five  is  presented  in  Vitoratou  et  al.  (2018)  and consisted of 50 items measured on a 7-point ordinal scale. The triggers version included 36 sounds whose effect on the individual with misophonia was measured on a 6-point ordinal scale. The first wave of  data  collection  (January-March  2019)  resulted  in  a  misophonia  specific  sample  of  853 individuals. Based on the preliminary analyses from the first wave data, participants' feedback (see summary Table A1 and A2 in Appendix) and experts  advice (JG), 32 items were rephrased, and 71 ' statements and 12 trigger sounds were added in both triggers and statement sections.

The second  wave of  data  collection  (June  -November  2019)  resulted  to  202  responses  from  the general population and 613 responses of people identifying as having misophonia (hereafter referred to as misophonia sample ). Full psychometric assessment was conducted in the misophonia sample. With respect to the triggers section, Item Response Theory (IRT) models were used to estimate the severity (difficulty) and the ability of each trigger to discriminate between people with higher or lower misophonic complaint. The information (reliability) of each trigger was also estimated along with the information provided by the entire section. Test-retest reliability estimations concluded that all trigger items are stable in time. With respect to the statements' section, exploratory factor analysis revealed that there is a five-factor structure, with strong internal consistency within each factor. Items were then  removed  based  on  the  strength  of  their  association  with  their  assigned  factor.  Items  which loaded less than 0.5 with their factor were omitted. Items that cross-loaded in two or more factors (secondary loading(s) at least 0.3) were omitted. Items that did not have strong loadings to any of the factors were omitted. Items which correlated to high (higher than 0.8) with other items were also committed. Reliability analysis indicated that statements were stable in time (two weeks test-retest). Based on these analyses, 63 items were omitted. Results were replicated in the general populations sample. Furthermore, based on the feedback of the responders and expert opinion on the factors, 13 items were added, and 18 items were rephrased, giving a total of 68 items in the statement section of the questionnaire. In the trigger version, 6 items were rephrased, 3 items were added, and 1 item was omitted, which gave a total of 37 trigger items.

Those changes were incorporated to the third wave of  data  collection  (January-March 2020). The trigger section of the 36-items current scale version includes 37 misophonic triggers (Appendix 2.E.i). In this section participants are asked to choose the main feeling a particular sound typically causes to them  (no  feeling,  irritation,  distress,  disgust,  anger,  panic,  other  feeling:  negative,  other  feeling: positive) and then to rate the intensity of their reaction to this sound ( 0: doesn't bothe r me at all to 10: unbearable/causes suffering ). The trigger section is optional, as some people have reported that being informed about other people's triggers can affect them negatively and/or make them endorse those triggers. The statement section (Appendix 2.E.ii) consists of the 36 items and asks participants to respond on a scale ranging from 0: not at all true to 10: completely true regarding one's emotional responses upon experiencing triggers, attitudes towards individuals or objects producing triggering sounds, individual attributes to oneself, impact on an everyday functioning, and aggressive outburst.

Exploratory factor analysis using 393 responses from a misophonic specific sample resulted to the same five factor structure which had emerged in the second wave data analysis. Based on the loadings criteria, the statement section was reduced to 36 items. The 36-items / 5-factors solution provided good fit to our data, yet a 25-items / 5-factors had the best fit to our data.  With a view to replicate the  exploratory  results  using  confirmatory  methods,  the  36-items  version  was  administered  to another sample of individuals identifying as having misophonia and to a representative sample of the UK general population (using Prolific www.prolific.com).

The full survey is described in the following section

## Survey description

The first page of the survey included the study information sheet. Questions regarding the inclusion and the exclusion criteria followed. Next participants were required to complete the informed consent questions.

General demographics were collected including age, gender, ethnic background, education level and current  occupation  (Appendix  1.A).  Participants  were  asked  to  select,  from  a  list,  any  occurring diagnoses  (Appendix  1.B).  The  list  consists  of  the  most  common  conditions  within  the  major classifications of mental disorders. Furthermore, participants were also asked about a diagnosis of restless  leg  syndrome,  and  any  condition  affecting  perception  and  processing  of  sounds.  A  brief description of two sensory phenomena, synaesthesia and autonomous sensory meridian response, were provided and participants were asked if, based on these descriptions, they experience either phenomena. Information about familial experience of misophonia, the developmental history of the participants' misophonia ,  and its impact on impaired functioning measured by the Work and Social Adjustment  Scale  (WSAS;  Mundt  et  al.,  2002)  were  also  collected  for  those  identify  as  having Misophonia (Appendix 1.C).

The  S-Five  items  followed  ( trigger  section presented  in  Appendix  2.E.i  and statement  section presented in Appendix 2.E.ii).

At the end of the survey, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke et al., 2001), General Anxiety  Disorder-7  questionnaire  (GAD-7;  Spitzer  et  al.,  2006),  and  Bryant  and  Smith  Aggression Questionnaire (AQ; Bryant &amp; Smith, 2001) were administered. The first two scales are standardised screening tools and symptom severity measures for depression and anxiety disorders, respectively. BS-AQ is a shorter 12-item version of the original 29-item Aggression Questionnaire (Buss &amp; Perry, 1992),  which  measures  aggression  on  four  dimensions:  physical  aggression,  verbal  aggression, hostility, and anger. This completes the obligatory part of the survey.

Participants were then asked whether they want to participate in a retest study in two weeks' time. Subsequently, in the misophonia population sampling, participants were given an option to either complete more questionnaires or finish the survey. Those who decided to continue were randomly presented with twelve additional questionnaires. An estimation of the time required to complete each questionnaire was given beforehand and people were informed that they can stop the survey at any point and all the data they had given thus far will be included in the study.  In the Prolific sample data collection,  participants  were  randomly  assigned  to  one  of  two  blocks  of  questionnaires,  each consisting by 6 measures. The twelve measures are listed below.

- 1. The Beliefs about Emotions Scale (BES; Rimes &amp; Chalder, 2010) is a 12-item questionnaire on beliefs regarding the inability to accept negative emotions, and the adverse consequences of experiencing  and  expressing  those  emotions.  Items  are  rated  on  a  7-point  Likert  scale, specifying level of agreement or disagreement.
- 2. The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown &amp; Ryan, 2003) assesses a receptive state of mind, which is a core feature of mindfulness. MAAS contains 15 items measured on a 6-point ordinal scale ranging from 'almost always' to 'almost never'.
- 3. The Autonomous  Sensory  Meridian  Response (ASMR-15;  Roberts  et  al.,  2019)  is  a questionnaire  assessing  altered  state  of  consciousness  phenomena,  namely  autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR), which is characterised by pleasurable tingling sensation in response to certain audio-visual stimuli, causing relaxation and euphoria. The 15-item scale is  rated on  a  scale  from  1, 'completely untrue for me' to 5, 'completely true for me' ,  and consists of four subscales: altered consciousness, sensation, relaxation and affect.
- 4. The  reduced-item Disgust  Propensity  and  Sensitivity  Scale-Revised (DPSS-R;  Fergus  &amp; Valentiner, 2009) consists of 12 items on a 5-point response scale that assess how easily one is  disgusted,  known as disgust propensity, and how bothered a person is by their disgust, which is described as disgust sensitivity, both of which contribute to disgust reactions.
- 5. The Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI-3; Taylor et al., 2007) is a shorter 18-item version of the original  Anxiety  Sensitivity  Index  (Peterson  &amp;  Reiss,  1992).  It  assesses  anxiety  sensitivity conceptualised  as one's  considerations  regarding  misinterpretations of anxiety-related sensations. The  scale measures  anxiety  sensitivity on  physical, cognitive, and  social dimensions.
- 6. The Adult Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (AEBQ; Hunot et al., 2016) is a 35-item measure that assesses appetitive traits in adulthood. AEBQ consists of 8 subscales; however, for the purpose of this study only 'food fussiness' subscale was implemented, which consists of 5 items measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging fr om 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree'.
- 7. The Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego -autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A;  Akiskal  et  al.,  2005)  measures  temperamental  variations  based  on  diagnostic classifications for affective temperaments, namely cyclothymic, dysthymic, irritable, hyperthymic, and anxious, and has five subscales named as such. The scale is a yes-or-no type questionnaire and consists of 39 items.
- 8. The Big Five Inventory (BFI; John &amp; Srivastava, 1999) is a 44-item questionnaire with a 5-point Likert  agreement  scale,  which measures  one's  personality on  the  Big  Five  Factors  of personality: extraversion vs introversion, agreeableness vs antagonism, conscientiousness vs lack of direction, neuroticism vs emotional stability, openness vs closedness to experience. Those factors are further separated into personality dimensions.
- 9. The Leahy Emotional Schema Scale II (LESS II; Leahy, 2012) is a 28-item measure with a 6point ordinal response scale that determines beliefs and attributions about emotions. The scale is divided into fourteen dimensions: invalidation, incomprehensibility, guilt, simplistic view  of  emotion,  devalued,  loss  of  control,  numbness,  overly  rational,  duration,  low consensus, non-acceptance of feelings, rumination, low expression, and blame.
- 10. The Body Consciousness Questionnaire (BCQ; Miller et al., 1981) contains 15 items with a 5point  Likert  scale  and  assesses  inner  bodily  awareness,  which  is  subdivided  into  three subscales, namely private body, public body, and body competence.
- 11. The Misophonia  Questionnaire (MQ;  Wu  et  al.,  2014)  is  a  34-item  scale  consisting  of  3 sections that assesses misophonia regarding the presence of specific triggers, emotional and behavioural responses and its severity. The first two sections, Misophonia Symptom Scale and Misophonia Emotions and Behaviours scale, are rated on a 5-point ordinal scale, whilst the third section, Misophonia Severity Scale, measures one's severity of sound sensitivity on a 1 to 15-point scale with 1 suggesting minimal sound sensitivity and 15 indicating very severe sensitivity.
- 12. The Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S; Schröder et al., 2013) is a 6-item scale that measures different facets of misophonia, namely time consumed by the condition, its impact on one's functioning, level of distress, level of resistance, perceived control over thoughts, and avoidance behaviours.

## Final S-Five

The  25-items  5-factors  solution  had  the  closest  fit  across  4  different  samples  ( EFA , CFA , general population ,  and individuals who identify with misophonia samples). The final statement items and their assignment to factors are presented in Table 1 below. The copyright of the scale belongs to Dr Vitoratou and King's College London 1 and can be used freely for non-commercial, educational and research purposes, provided that the developers are informed and acknowledged. Please contact Dr Vitoratou for advice on the administration of the scale.

The  five  factor  emerging  were: internalising appraisals  (e.g.  'Sometimes  I  think  that  I  am  cra zy because of the way I feel when I hear certain sounds'), externalising appraisals ('I get angry at other people because of how disrespectful they are with the noises they make'), perceived threat and avoidance behaviour ('If I can't get away from certain noises, I am afraid I might panic or feel like I'll explode'), outbursts ('Some sounds are so unbearable that I will shout at people to make them stop') and impact on functioning ('I don't meet friends as often as I'd like to because of the noises they ma ke'). Reliability indices were excellent within each factor. Strong correlations emerged with other misophonia scales. There was evidence that the five factors and the trigger endorsement were related to Depression and Anxiety. Age and gender had mild effects on the S-Five scores.   The trigger section of 37 sounds remained unaltered.

Detailed  information  on  the  psychometric  properties  (endorsement,  norms,  reliability,  stability, validity) will be presented in a peer reviewed journal article currently under preparation.

Table 1: Assignment of the 25 S-Five statements to the 5 factors.

## Externalising

People should not make certain sounds, even if they do not know about others' sensitivities I get angry at other people because of how disrespectful they are with the noises they make People should do everything they can to avoid making noises that might bother others I react strongly to certain sounds because I cannot stand how selfish, thoughtless or bad-mannered people can be Certain sounds are just bad manners, and it is not strange to feel intense anger about that

## Internalising

The way I react to certain sounds makes me wonder whether deep inside I am just a bad person

The way I react to certain noises makes me feel like I must be an unlikable person deep down I respect myself less because of my responses to certain sounds I feel like I must be a very angry person inside because of the way I react to certain sounds

I dislike myself in the moments of my reactions to sounds

## Impact

My job opportunities are limited because of my reaction to certain noises

I do not meet friends as often as I would like to because of the noises they make

There are places I would like to go but do not, because I am too worried about how the noises will impact me I can see future where I cannot do everyday things because of my reactions to noises

The way I feel/react to certain sounds will eventually isolate me and prevent me from doing everyday things

## Outburst

I can get so angry at certain noises that I get physically aggressive towards people to make them stop Sometimes I get so distressed by noises that I use violence to try and make it stop Some sounds are so unbearable that I will shout at people to make them stop If people make certain sounds that I cannot bear, I become verbally aggressive

I am afraid I will do something aggressive or violent because I cannot stand the noise someone is making

## Threat

- I feel trapped if I cannot get away from certain noises
- I feel anxious if I cannot avoid listening to certain sounds
- If I cannot get away from certain noises, I am afraid I might panic or feel like I will explode
- If I cannot avoid certain sounds, I feel helpless
- I can experience distress as the result of some noises
- All items are rated in a 0-10 ordinal scale. Please randomise items before administering.

## Discussion: next steps and future research

Based  on  the  analyses  of  data  from  there  waves  we  have  established  that  the  S-Five  is  a multidimensional reliable and valid tool to measure Misophonia.  We are in the process of analysing the  data  from  the  third  and  final  data  collection  wave  to  extract  further  information,  such  as measurement invariance, thresholds and sensitivity. Psychometric and neurobehavioral correlates are estimated.  The  effected  of  demographic  and  clinical  characteristics  is  explored.  Our  team  also prepares an estimation of the UK misophonia prevalence is estimated using the representative of the UK general population sample. The scale will be used in a study with 100 volunteers signed up to participate in electroencephalogram (EEG) tests in London.

Our  team  aims  to  administer  the  final  S-Five  to  representative  samples  from  the  USA,  Canada, Australia  and  New  Zealand  populations.  Translations  of  the  S-Five  to  Greek,  Polish,  Farsi,  French, Italian, and other languages are considered, and collaborations are welcomed.

If they've been informed and do it more because it amuses them to watch me squirm and get upset, then it's likely that we're not going to be associating for much longer |

| There are certain sounds that I cannot bear to the degree that I may become aggressive towards people so they stop making them | Some of us feel the need to run and withdraw when the panic sets in with the trigger sounds and not get aggressive                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| There are certain sounds that I cannot bear to the degree that I may become aggressive towards people so they stop making them | You are using the term "aggressive" but not distinguishing between verbal aggression and physical aggression. I often feel on the brink of verbal aggression and can sometimes become verbally aggressive but have not become physically aggressive                                                                              |
| There are certain sounds that I cannot bear to the degree that I may become aggressive towards people so they stop making them | I would only be verbally aggressive, i.e. snapping at someone. I've never and feel no urge, to be physical with someone. It's true rage - but I would never act on it.                                                                                                                                                           |
| There are certain sounds that I cannot bear to the degree that I may become aggressive towards people so they stop making them | In some cases, where I can't escape a certain sound, I've become violent. However, this violence is targeted at myself; I'll punch a wall, or in the past I would have cut myself or forced myself to throw up                                                                                                                   |

I hide it to the best of my ability.                                                                                                                                     |

Ridicule or dismissive 2. Call me crazy- not a normal person 3. Offended think I'm making it up to hurt them. 4. Torture me with the sounds that they now know hurt me.       |
| Sometimes in response to sounds I fell rage that is difficult to control                               | It isn't rage I feel it's more extreme distress and intense anxiety and panic...a need to escape or to make the sound stop                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Almost like being tickled to the point you can hardly breath. It's a twisting nervy sensation.                                                                                                                              |
| When people make certain sounds I feel like I almost hate them, even if this is not true at all        | Most of the worst triggers are from the people you love the most. I hate the trigger but not the person. Hard to distinguish sometimes.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| When people make certain sounds I feel like I almost hate them, even if this is not true at all        | People I just met do not bother me as much versus someone I have known for a longer period of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| To make people understand how annoying are the sounds they make, I mimic them, exaggerating the sounds | I do mimic people's sounds and movements, and in an exaggerated way, but it is to sooth my internal pain response, not to let them know it is bothering me.                                                                                                                                                   |
| To make people understand how annoying are the sounds they make, I mimic them, exaggerating the sounds | There is another reason for mimicking the sound - something to do with control or reclaiming it, not just to show someone how annoying it is. I often repeat or mimic as a coping strategy or reaction                                                                                                        |
| To make people understand how annoying are the sounds they make, I mimic them, exaggerating the sounds | When I mimic the sound it's to relieve my own feelings not others. If I cannot mimic the sound the negative feelings become more intense. I have become aware over many years that some of my triggers are specific to certain people and they are more often than not people who I see regular or live with. |
| I don't like myself because of my responses to certain sounds                                          | I don't dislike myself consistently.

| Some sounds have caused me use violence towards myself or others                                       | I use violence more towards myself, as the rage and inability to stop a sound will make me feel suicidal                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Mechanical sounds like engines revving                   | It's worse when the sounds are unexpected or uncontrollable. I wish the questions were a little clearer or there was a way to specify things like distance/duration/intensity. Sudden loud engine revving noises are a lot more upsetting than a car driving by                                                                                         |

| Sounds that are made by animals or children are less triggering because they don't realise that they are making them                            | My reaction to animals is different from my reaction to children. I find babies and children completely intolerable. Most sounds from pets are fine including eating sounds. Repetitious barking from my neighbour's dogs builds my bad reaction over a few minutes and does not prevent me from having dogs of my own that I take care of and train so that they don't develop such bad habits. On the other hand, a child or baby screaming or crying sends me into hell immediately. I want nothing to do with them and refuse to ever have any of myown. Children are not allowed in myhome, but pets are welcome. |

## E) S-Five

## i) Trigger Section

On the following page we ask you to rate certain sounds that sometimes cause people to have strong emotional reactions (known as 'auditory triggers') . You will not be listening to sounds at any point in this questionnaire, but this section does mention several possible auditory triggers_

Some people have reported that hearing about other people's triggers can affect them negatively andlor make them endorse those triggers. If you think this is the case for you; please skip this section of the questionnaire by selecting 'no' below.

If you choose to complete this section but feel discomfort at any point while reading the triggers , please stop answering the questions in this section by clicking 'Please take me out of here, have had enough' at the bottom of the page. In this case, you will still have to fill in that page; but then you will be taken away from the triggers and to the next section.
