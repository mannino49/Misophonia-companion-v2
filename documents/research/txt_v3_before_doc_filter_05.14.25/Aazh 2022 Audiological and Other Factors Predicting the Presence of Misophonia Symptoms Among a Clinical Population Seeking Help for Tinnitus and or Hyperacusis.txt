This paper evaluates the proportion and the audiological and other characteristics of
patients with symptoms of misophonia among a population seeking help for tinnitus
and/or hyperacusis at an audiology clinic ( n= 257). To assess such symptoms,
patients were asked “over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered
by any of the following problems? Feeling angry or anxious when hearing certain
sounds related to eating noises, lip-smacking, snifﬂing, breathing, clicking sounds,
tapping?”. The results of routine audiological tests and self-report questionnaires were
gathered retrospectively from the records of the patients. Measures included: pure tone
audiometry, uncomfortable loudness levels (ULLs), and responses to the tinnitus impact
questionnaire (TIQ), the hyperacusis impact questionnaire (HIQ), and the screening for
anxiety and depression in tinnitus (SAD-T) questionnaire. The mean age of the patients
was 53 years (SD = 16) (age range 17 to 97 years). Fifty four percent were female.
Twenty-three percent of patients were classiﬁed as having misophonia. The presence
and frequency of reporting misophonia symptoms were not related to audiometric
thresholds, except that a steeply sloping audiogram reduced the likelihood of frequent
misophonia symptoms. Those with more frequent misophonia symptoms had lower
values of ULLmin (the across-frequency average of ULLs for the ear with lower average
ULLs) than those with less frequent or no reported symptoms. The reported frequency
of experiencing misophonia symptoms increased with increasing impact of tinnitus (TIQ
score9), increasing impact of hyperacusis (HIQ score >11), and symptoms of anxiety
and depression (SAD-T score 4). It is concluded that, when assessing individuals with
tinnitus and hyperacusis, it is important to screen for misophonia, particularly when
ULLmin is abnormally low or the TIQ, HIQ or SAD-T score is high. This will help clinicians
to distinguish patients with misophonia, guiding the choice of therapeutic strategies.

Aazh et al. Audiological Characteristics of Misophonia
INTRODUCTION
Tinnitus is the perception of sound without an acoustical
source external to the body. Hyperacusis is intolerance of
certain everyday sounds, which are perceived as too loud or
uncomfortable and cause signiﬁcant distress and impairment in
the individual’s day-to-day activities (Aazh et al., 2016, 2022a).
Misophonia is characterized by a decreased tolerance for speciﬁc
sounds (Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2002; Brout et al., 2018; Swedo
et al., 2022). These sounds are known as “triggers, ” and they are
usually man or animal-made sounds, and often orofacial sounds
(generated by the mouth and nose), such as sniﬃng and chewing.
In addition, there is evidence to suggest that, regardless of the
source of the triggers, they share similar properties, including
repetition (Brout et al., 2018; Erfanian et al., 2019; Enzler et al.,
2021b; Hansen et al., 2021). People with misophonia may also be
intolerant of certain visual and tactile stimuli (Kumar et al., 2017,
2021; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018; Schroder et al., 2019; Eijsker
et al., 2021b). It may be the case that the action of the trigger-
producing person is what causes the reaction, rather than the
sound itself (Kumar et al., 2021).
The reported prevalence of misophonia varies from 6 to 19%,
although a prevalence as high as 37% has been found (Wu et al.,
2014; Zhou et al., 2017; Naylor et al., 2021). The prevalence
depends on the population studied and on the way that
misophonia is diagnosed; the prevalence diﬀers markedly across
populations with and without co-morbid disorders. A growing
body of literature shows co-morbidity of misophonia with a
range of aﬀective disorders as diagnosed in mental health settings,
such as major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder (OCPD), and post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) (Schroder et al., 2013; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018; Erfanian
et al., 2019; Jager et al., 2020b), and developmental disorders
like attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) (Jager et al., 2020a; McKay and
Acevedo, 2020; Haq et al., 2021). The overlapping symptomology
of misophonia and psychiatric, developmental, and audiological
disorders makes the diagnosis and treatment complicated.
Although auditory disorders, including tinnitus and
hyperacusis, often co-occur with misophonia (Jastreboﬀ
and Jastreboﬀ, 2014; Danesh and Aazh, 2020), studies focused
on misophonia in the ﬁeld of audiology are scarce (Porcaro
et al., 2019). Nevertheless, audiologists play a key role in
providing therapy and support for this patient population. Often,
audiologists who are specialized in the management of tinnitus
and hyperacusis also provide counseling and sound therapy
(Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2014) and/or audiologist-delivered
cognitive behavioral therapy for the management of misophonia
(Aazh et al., 2014, 2019b). Although the term misophonia was
suggested based on studies related to therapy for tinnitus and
hyperacusis (Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2002), most of the research
literature on misophonia comes from the ﬁelds of psychiatry,
psychology and neuroscience, with little or no attention paid
to the audiological proﬁle of the population studied. A possible
reason for this is that in the ﬁeld of audiology misophonia is often
considered as a subtype of hyperacusis rather than a distinct
disorder (Tyler et al., 2014). Therefore, most research studies in
the ﬁeld of audiology have not distinguished misophonia fromhyperacusis (Fackrell et al., 2015; Sheldrake et al., 2015; Zaugg
et al., 2016; Aazh et al., 2017).
Most studies of misophonia performed in mental health
settings have not conducted full audiological evaluations, but
some have performed pure tone audiometry on a sub-group of
patients (Sztuka et al., 2010; Schroder et al., 2013, 2014; Jager
et al., 2020a,b; Siepsiak et al., 2022). Generally, no hearing loss
was found, although some cases of tinnitus and/or hyperacusis
were reported. However, Enzler et al. (2021b) conducted a study
on the development of a psychoacoustic test for assessment
of misophonia and reported that among 78 patients with
misophonia diagnosed via the MisoQuest questionnaire (Siepsiak
et al., 2020), 17 reported hearing problems, 14 had tinnitus,
and 55 had hyperacusis. These results suggest that hearing loss,
tinnitus and hyperacusis may not be uncommon among patients
with misophonia.
Published studies have not assessed the relationship between
hearing-related variables and misophonia. In theory, hearing loss
could aﬀect the experience of misophonia. The trigger sounds for
misophonia often have a spectrum that is dominated by high-
frequency components (Dacremont, 1995; Enzler et al., 2021b).
A steeply sloping audiogram, with the greatest loss at high
frequencies, would reduce the audibility of such sounds, perhaps
making it less likely for an individual to have misophonia or
reducing the severity of misophonia. On the other hand, people
with hearing loss also often experience loudness recruitment,
a more rapid than normal growth of loudness with increasing
sound level once the sound becomes audible (Moore and
Glasberg, 2004). Hence a sound that is only just above the
detection threshold may be of moderate loudness and may be
annoying. Analysis of the audiometric characteristics of people
with misophonia can indicate if hearing loss inﬂuences the
likelihood or severity of misophonia.
An audiological measure that is often used in the assessment
and diagnosis of hyperacusis is the uncomfortable loudness level
(ULL) (Aazh and Moore, 2017b). People with hyperacusis often
have lower ULLs than people without hyperacusis (Blaesing and
Kroener-Herwig, 2012; Formby et al., 2015). In addition, the
diﬀerence between ULLs at 1 and 8 kHz, a measure of the
variation of ULLs across frequency, may be an indicator of a
dislike of speciﬁc sounds, especially high-frequency sounds. Aazh
and Moore (2017b) reported that among patients seeking help
for tinnitus and/or hyperacusis the diﬀerence between ULLs at
1 and 8 kHz was 20 dB for about 10%, perhaps indicating
misophonia. Siepsiak et al. (2022) compared ULLs for 62 patients
with misophonia and 51 individuals with no sound sensitivity
symptoms. The average ULL across ears was about 85 dB HL
(standard deviation, SD = 16 dB) for the misophonia group and
90 dB HL (SD = 14 dB) for the control group, but the diﬀerence
was not statistically signiﬁcant, perhaps because of the large SD
within each group.
Another audiological factor that may be relevant to
misophonia is asymmetrical hearing threshold levels (HTLs)
or ULLs (i.e., between-ear diﬀerences). A large between-ear
diﬀerence in ULLs might indicate some speciﬁc abnormality in
monaural pathways. For example, a disorder of the olivo-cochlear
eﬀerent system, which reduces the gain of the cochlea in
response to high-level sounds, might increase sound sensitivity

Aazh et al. Audiological Characteristics of Misophonia
(Guinan, 2018), and the eﬀect might diﬀer across ears depending
on where in the auditory system the disorder originates. On the
other hand, if a global psychological or neurological component
is predominant in producing hyperacusis and misophonia, then
it seems unlikely that it would aﬀect one ear more than the other.
Although to our knowledge ear asymmetry in HTLs or ULLs
has not been investigated among patients with misophonia, some
reports suggest the presence of asymmetrical HTLs and ULLs
among patients with severe hyperacusis (Aazh and Moore, 2017b,
2018). This is relevant to misophonia as Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ
(2015) reported that misophonia is almost always present in cases
of severe hyperacusis. Aazh and Moore (2018) reported that 6
out of 13 patients with severe hyperacusis had an interaural
asymmetry between 5 and 12 dB in average ULLs and 5/13
had an interaural asymmetry between 5 and 16 dB in average
HTLs. However, due to the small sample size they were not
able to assess if greater interaural asymmetry was related to the
severity of hyperacusis.
Finally, it is not clear if the likelihood of a person experiencing
misophonia is related to whether or not they suﬀer from
distressing tinnitus and/or hyperacusis. Distressing tinnitus
and/or hyperacusis may increase anxiety and depression (Aazh
and Moore, 2017a), making the individual more likely to
develop a strong reaction to trigger sounds, i.e., misophonia.
Alternatively, tinnitus may distract the individual, preventing
them from attending to potentially annoying trigger sounds. Past
studies have not assessed the relationship between the impact of
tinnitus and/or hyperacusis and symptoms of misophonia.
The ﬁrst aim of the current study was to assess the proportion
of patients with symptoms of misophonia among a clinical
population of patients seeking help for tinnitus and hyperacusis.
We predicted that this proportion would be higher than for the
general population (Wu et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017; Rouw and
Erfanian, 2018).
The second aim was to compare the audiological
characteristics and severity of tinnitus, hyperacusis, anxiety and
depression among patients who reported diﬀerent frequencies
of experiencing symptoms of misophonia in a two-week period
(i.e., 0-1 days, 2-6 days, 7-10 days, and 11-14 days). We predicted
that a sloping audiogram, with greater hearing loss at high
frequencies would be associated with a smaller number of days
of experiencing misophonia symptoms and that lower ULLs
and more severe tinnitus, hyperacusis, anxiety and depression
would be associated with a greater frequency of experiencing of
misophonia symptoms.
The results were intended to inform those working in
audiology clinics of the likelihood of misophonia among their
patients and of factors that are related to it, i.e., factors that
increase the probability of misophonia being present. This
information could be used to guide the choice of therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethical Approval
The study was registered, reviewed and approved as a clinical
audit by the Quality Governance Department at RSFT. The needfor patient consent was waived as this was a retrospective analysis
of available clinical data. Analysis of the data was approved by the
South West-Cornwall and Plymouth Research Ethics Committee
and the Research and Development department at the RSFT
(Project ID: 182924).
Study Design and Patients
This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted at the
Tinnitus and Hyperacusis Therapy Specialist Clinic (THTSC),
RSFT, Guildford, United Kingdom. Data were included for all
patients who attended the THTSC seeking help for tinnitus
and/or hyperacusis in 2019-2020 and who answered a question
assessing symptoms of misophonia ( n= 257). Administration
of the self-report questionnaires (including the question about
misophonia) and audiological measurements included in this
study were part of the routine care for patients at THTSC. This
routine care did not include the administration of validated
questionnaires for assessing misophonia; this issue is addressed
in the Discussion section.
Demographic data for the patients, results of their
audiological investigations and the outcomes of their self-
report questionnaires were imported from their records held at
the Audiology Department. All questionnaires were completed
prior to the start of any treatment, at each patient’s ﬁrst visit to
the clinic. Patients completed the questionnaires in the clinic
waiting area without involvement of their audiologist. The mean
age of the patients was 53 years (SD = 16 years) (age range = 17 -
97 years). Fifty four percent (139/257) were female.
Audiological Measures
Audiological measures were:
(1) Pure tone audiogram measured using the procedure
recommended by the British Society of Audiology (BSA,
2011a), but with some modiﬁcations proposed by Aazh
and Moore (2017c) to limit discomfort. The starting
presentation level at 0.25, 0.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz
was equal to the HTL at the adjacent frequency (e.g., if
the HTL at 1 kHz was 20 dB HL, the starting level for
measuring the HTL at 2 kHz was 20 dB HL, instead of
50 dB HL as recommended by the BSA). The severity of
hearing loss was categorized based on the values of the
PTA across the frequencies 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz, as
recommended by the British Society of Audiology (BSA,
2011a): Mild (20 – 40 dB HL), Moderate (41 – 70 dB HL),
Severe (71 – 95 dB HL) and Profound (over 95 dB HL).
To explore asymmetries in HTLs across the ears, patients
were classiﬁed into ﬁve groups based on the between-
ear diﬀerence in PTA: <5 dB,5 and<10 dB, 10 and
<20,20 and<30, and 30. The absolute values of
the diﬀerences in HTLs between 8 and 1 kHz, referred
to here as HTL slope were calculated separately for the
right and left ears.
(2) ULLs measured following the BSA recommended
procedure (BSA, 2011b), but with the modiﬁcations
proposed by Aazh and Moore (2017c), to limit discomfort.
The instructions were “I will gradually make the sound

louder in your ear, and you must press the button (or raise
your hand) as soon as the sound becomes uncomfortable
(uncomfortably loud). This is not a test to ﬁnd the loudest
sound you can tolerate; it is a test to ﬁnd what level of
sound you ﬁnd uncomfortable. You should press the
button (or raise your hand) only when the sound becomes
uncomfortable; but make sure you press (raise) it as soon
as the sound reaches that level.” The starting presentation
level was equal to the measured HTL at the test frequency.
In addition, levels above 80 dB HL were not used. If the
ULL was not reached at 80 dB HL, the ULL at the test
frequency was recorded as 85 dB HL. The across-frequency
average (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz) ULL for the
ear with lower average ULL is denoted ULLmin. When
ULLmin was 77 dB HL, hyperacusis was deemed to be
present (Aazh and Moore, 2017b). Patients were diagnosed
with severe hyperacusis if the ULL for any frequency for
either ear was 30 dB HL or less (Aazh and Moore, 2018).
To explore asymmetries in ULLs across the ears, patients
were classiﬁed into three groups based on the between-ears
diﬀerence in average ULLs (across 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,
and 8 kHz): symmetrical (between-ear diﬀerence <5 dB),
mildly asymmetrical (between-ear diﬀerence 5 dB and
<10 dB), asymmetrical (between-ear diﬀerence 10 dB).
The absolute values of the diﬀerences in ULLs between
8 and 1 kHz (i.e., ULL at 8 kHz minus ULL at 1 kHz),
referred to here as ULL slope, were calculated separately
for the right and left ears.
Questionnaires
Assessment of Misophonia Symptoms
Item 4 of the Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire (SSSQ)
(Aazh et al., 2022a) was used to identify patients with symptoms
of misophonia. This item asks, “Over the last 2 weeks, how
often have you been feeling angry or anxious when hearing
certain sounds related to eating noises, lip smacking, sniﬄing,
breathing, clicking sounds, tapping?” The response choices are:
0-1 days, 2-6 days, 7-10 days and 11-14 days. Scores of 0 were
assigned for 0-1 days, 1 for 2-6 days, 2 for 7-10 days and 3
for 11-14 days. Patients who scored 2 or 3 on this item (i.e.,
reporting feeling anxious or angry more than half of the days)
were classiﬁed as having frequent symptoms of misophonia.
This is denoted Miso Cat 1. Patients with scores of 0 or 1
(i.e., reporting feeling anxious or angry less than half of the
days) were classiﬁed as having no or less frequent misophonia
symptoms. This is denoted Miso Cat 0. In some of the analyses
that follow, the actual score for item 4 of the SSSQ was used. This
is denoted SSSQ4.
Screening for Anxiety and Depression in Tinnitus
The screening for anxiety and depression (SAD-T) questionnaire
contains four items that match those for the physical health
questionnaire (PHQ-4; Kroenke et al., 2009). Each item is rated
on a four-point Likert scale. Two items relate to experiences of
anxiety and worry and two relate to the experience of anhedonia
and feeling down, depressed or hopeless. The response choices
are: 0-1 days, 2-6 days, 7-10 days and 11-14 days. Scores of 0were assigned for 0-1 days, 1 for 2-6 days, 2 for 7-10 days and
3 for 11-14 days. Cronbach’s alpha for the SAD-T, based on
responses from a tinnitus and hyperacusis clinical population,
is 0.91 (Aazh et al., 2022a). The overall score for the SAD-T
ranges from 0 to 12. Scores of 4 or more indicate symptoms of
anxiety and/or depression. This was calculated but not reported
during a study on the acceptability and relevance of psychological
questionnaires in the assessment of patients with tinnitus and/or
hyperacusis (Aazh and Moore, 2017d).
Questions About History of Mental Health
Given the high prevalence of mental illness among patients
seeking help for tinnitus and/or hyperacusis, the patients were
asked several questions about mental health as part of routine
history taking (Aazh and Moore, 2017d; Aazh et al., 2018).
The questions were: (1) Do you have any history of mental
illness? (2) Have you seen mental health professionals? (3)
While you were growing up during the ﬁrst 18 years of life did
your parent(s) have depression or mental illness? The responses
for these questions were “yes” or “no.” The third question is
taken from the questionnaire for Adverse Childhood Experiences
(Felitti et al., 1998).
Hyperacusis Impact Questionnaire
The hyperacusis impact questionnaire (HIQ) has eight items
assessing the impact of hyperacusis on the patient’s life. The
HIQ asks respondents how often (in number of days in the
last 14 days) each of several situations occurred because of
certain environmental sounds that seemed too loud to them,
but that other people could tolerate well. Reponses choices and
the score for each choice were the same as for the SAD-T, as
described above. Cronbach’s alpha for the HIQ is 0.93. The overall
score ranges from 0 to 24. Scores above 11 indicate a clinically
signiﬁcant impact of hyperacusis (Aazh et al., 2022a).
Tinnitus Impact Questionnaire
This 7-item questionnaire assesses how often respondents
experience a number of problems because of hearing a sound
in their ears or head with no external source (e.g., buzzing,
high-pitched whistle, hissing), over a two-week period. Reponses
choices and the score for each choice were the same as for the
SAD-T, as described above. Cronbach’s alpha for the TIQ is 0.89
(Aazh et al., 2022b). The overall score ranges from 0 to 21. A score
below 5 indicates no impact of tinnitus, a score of 5 or 6 indicates
mild impact, a score of 7 or 8 indicates moderate impact, and a
score of 9 or more indicates a severe impact (Aazh et al., 2022b).
Data Analyses
The data were anonymized prior to statistical analysis.
Descriptive statistics for the demographic variables, hearing
thresholds and ULLs, and the scores for the self-report
questionnaires were calculated.
Welch’s t-tests (Delacre et al., 2017) and chi-squared ( $2) tests
were used to compare audiological variables across frequencies
and to assess the diﬀerences in the scores for the questionnaires
between Miso Cat 1 and Miso Cat 0. Cohen’s dwas calculated

Aazh et al. Audiological Characteristics of Misophonia
to assess eﬀect sizes (ES) based on mean comparison for unequal
variances (Lakens, 2013; Delacre et al., 2017).
One-way analyses of variance (ANOV A) were used to assess
the diﬀerences in scores for the HIQ, TIQ, SAD-T, ULLmin and
PTA across ears among patients with scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 for
item 4 of the SSSQ (SSSQ4 score). The Šídák method was used
for post hoc tests (Kirk, 2012). ES values following ANOV A were
assessed using the 2measure (Smithson, 2001).
Spearman correlation was used to assess the relationships
between SSSQ4 scores and scores for the HIQ, TIQ, SAD-T,
ULLmin, PTA across ears, HTL and ULL slopes and age. The
strength of the correlation coeﬃcient ( r) was considered as
weak if r<0.2, moderate if rwas between 0.2 and 0.5, and
strong if r>0.5 (Cohen, 1988; Hemphill, 2003). Variables that
were signiﬁcantly correlated with SSSQ4 scores were included
in a logistic regression model to assess whether the SSSQ4
score (dependent variable) was related to ULLmin, scores for
the HIQ, TIQ, SAD-T, and ULL and HTL slopes (independent
variables). Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% conﬁdence intervals
were obtained, both unadjusted and adjusted for (a) age and
gender (b) categories of tinnitus impact as measured via the TIQ,
(c) hyperacusis impact as measured via the HIQ, (d) anxiety
and depression as measured via the SAD-T, (e) hyperacusis as
measured via ULLmin, (f) ULL slope, and (g) HTL slope. Hearing
loss categories and between-ear diﬀerences in ULLs and PTA
were not included in the model as they were not correlated with
SSSQ4 scores. The pvalue required for statistical signiﬁcance was
p<0.05.
The analyses were restricted to patients with complete data
for all variables required for a particular analysis. The number
of patients included in each analysis ( n) is reported. The STATA
program (version 13) (StataCorp, 2013) and MATLAB 2020a
(The MathWorks, 2020) were used for statistical analyses.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the Study Population
The means and SDs of the HTLs and ULLs for each ear and
each frequency are shown in Table 1 . The grand mean PTA
across ears was 22 dB HL (SD = 15 dB) ( n= 244). The grand
mean PTA for the better ear was 18 dB HL (SD = 13 dB). The
grand mean PTA for the worse ear was 26 dB HL (SD = 19 dB).
Based on the PTA for the better ear, 65% of the patients had no
hearing loss, 28% had mild hearing loss, and 7% had moderate
hearing loss. Based on the PTA for the worse ear, 49% of the
patients had no hearing loss, 34% had mild hearing loss, 13.5%
had moderate hearing loss, 2.9% had severe hearing loss and 0.8%
had profound hearing loss.
For 64% of the patients (156/244), there was less than a 5-
dB diﬀerence in PTA between the two ears. The diﬀerence in
PTA between ears was 5 and<10 dB for 20% of cases, 10
and<20 dB for 5% of cases, 20 and<30 dB for 4.5% of cases,
and30 dB for 6.2% of cases. The mean HTL slope was 22.7 dB
(SD = 19.5 dB) for the left ears and 20 dB (SD = 19 dB) for the
right ears. The HTL slope was 20 dB, for at least one ear, for
58% of the patients (143/248).The grand average ULL across 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 kHz
and across ears was 78.5 dB HL (SD = 8.3) ( n= 169). The average
value of ULLmin was 77.7 dB HL (SD = 9) ( n= 191). ULLmin
values were 77 dB HL or below, suggesting hyperacusis for 30% of
patients. About 1.5% of the patients were diagnosed with severe
hyperacusis, based on them having a ULL of 30 dB HL or less
for any frequency for either ear (Aazh and Moore, 2018). ULLs
were symmetrical for 83% of patients, mildly asymmetrical for
14% and asymmetrical for 2.4%. The mean ULL slope was 5 dB
(SD = 8 dB) for both ears. About 11.5% of patients had a ULL
slope20 dB for at least one ear.
For the study population, the mean scores for the HIQ, TIQ
and SAD-T were 8 (SD = 7.5, n= 224), 8.4 (SD = 6, n= 170),
and 4 (SD = 4, n= 253), respectively. Based on scores for
the HIQ, 30% of patients had hyperacusis. Based on scores
for the TIQ, 28% of patients had no tinnitus handicap, 20.5%
had a mild tinnitus handicap, 10.5% had a moderate tinnitus
handicap, and 41% (70/170) had a severe tinnitus handicap.
Based on scores for the SAD-T, 44.5% of patients had symptoms
of anxiety and/or depression. About 47% of the patients (113/241)
reported a history of mental illness, 39% (94/240) reported
seeing mental health professionals, and 31.5% reported that when
they were under 18 years of age at least one of their parents
had mental illness.
Comparison of Miso Cat 0 and Miso
Cat 1
Overall, 23% of patients (59/257) were classiﬁed as Miso Cat 1.
Patients in Miso Cat 1 were younger on average than those in
Miso Cat 0 ( Table 2 ). The percentage of females was 61% for
Miso Cat 1 and 52% for Miso Cat 0, and the diﬀerence was not
signiﬁcant ( $2= 1.5, p= 0.22). There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
in PTA between those in Miso Cat 0 and those in Miso Cat 1, as
shown in Figures 1 ,2.
Based on the PTA for the better ear, among the 58 patients
in Miso Cat 1, 59% had no hearing loss, 38% had mild hearing
loss, and 3.5% had moderate hearing loss. Among the 190 patients
in Miso Cat 0, 67% had no hearing loss, 24% had mild hearing
loss, and 8% had moderate hearing loss. Based on the PTA for the
worse ear, among the patients in Miso Cat 1, 45% had no hearing
loss, 38% had mild hearing loss, 14% had moderate hearing loss,
and 3.5% had severe hearing loss. Among the patients in Miso Cat
0, 50% had no hearing loss, 33% had mild hearing loss, 13% had
moderate hearing loss, 3% had severe hearing loss, and 1% had
profound hearing loss. The diﬀerences in distributions of hearing
loss categories for the better and worse ears between Miso Cat
1 and Miso Cat 0 were not statistically signiﬁcant ( $2= 5.08,
p= 0.079 and $2= 1.3, p= 0.86, respectively).
The HTL slope averaged across ears was 20 dB for 52% of
those in Miso Cat 1 and for 59.5% of those in Miso Cat 0 ( $2= 1.1,
p= 0.3). The PTA diﬀered across ears by less than 5 dB for 65.5%
of those in Miso Cat 1 and 63.4% of those in Miso Cat 0. The
diﬀerence in PTA across ears was 5 and<10 dB for 17% of cases
in Miso Cat 1 and 21% of Miso Cat 0, 10 and<20 dB for 3. 5%
of those in Miso Cat 1 and 5.9% of Miso Cat 0, 20 and<30 dB
for 5.3% of those in Miso Cat 1 and 4.3% of those in Miso Cat 0,

FIGURE 2 | AsFigure 1 but for the left ear.
As shown in Figures 1 ,2, those in Miso Cat 1 had signiﬁcantly
lower (worse) mean ULLs than those in Miso Cat 0 for all
frequencies and both ears (all p<0.01). The ULL slope averaged
across ears was 20 dB for 26% of patients ( n= 12/46) in Miso
Cat 1 compared to 7% ( n= 10/145) in Miso Cat 0, and this
diﬀerence in proportions was signiﬁcant ( $2= 12.6, p<0.001).
Among patients in Miso Cat 1 ( n= 38), ULLs were

asymmetrical for 3%. Corresponding values for those in Miso Cat
0 were 84, 14, and 2%. The proportions of patients falling in eachasymmetry category did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly for Miso Cat 1 and

p<0.001), the impact of tinnitus generally being greater for
those in Miso Cat 1.
Based on the HIQ score, 73% (37/51) of those in Miso Cat 1
had a signiﬁcant impact of hyperacusis compared to 18% (31/173)
of those in Miso Cat 0, and this diﬀerence in proportions was
signiﬁcant ( $2= 55.6, p<0.001).
Based on the SAD-T score, 81% (47/58) of patients in Miso
Cat 1 had symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to
33.5% (65/194) of patients in Miso Cat 0, and this diﬀerence in
proportions was signiﬁcant ( $2= 40.8, p<0.001).
Seventy one percent (40/56) of patients in Miso Cat 1 reported
a history of mental illness compared to 39.5% (73/185) in
Miso Cat 0, and this diﬀerence in proportions was signiﬁcant
($2= 17.6, p<0.0001). Fifty seven percent (32/56) of patients
in Miso Cat 1 had seen mental health professionals compared to
34% (62/184) in Miso Cat 0, and this diﬀerence in proportions
was signiﬁcant ( $2= 9.9, p= 0.002). Forty ﬁve percent (25/55)
of patients in Miso Cat 1 reported that when they were a child
at least one of their parents had mental illness compared to
27% (50/183) for Miso Cat 0, and this diﬀerence in proportions
was signiﬁcant ( $2= 6.4, p= 0.011). Among patients with
a history of parental mental illness in their childhood, 59%
(43/73) had an abnormal SAD-T score compared to 39.5%
(64/162) of those with no history of parental mental illness,
and this diﬀerence in proportions was signiﬁcant ( $2= 7.6,
p= 0.006).
Table 2 shows the results of Welch’s t-tests comparing various
measures for those in Miso Cat 0 and Miso Cat 1. The mean
ULLmin values were signiﬁcantly lower and total scores for
the SAD-T, TIQ, HIQ were signiﬁcantly worse for Miso Cat
1 than for Miso Cat 0. The ULL slope was higher for Miso
Cat 1 than for Miso Cat 0, but the HTL slope was lower for
Miso Cat 1 than for Miso Cat 0. There were no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between Miso Cat 1 and 0 in terms of the between-ear
diﬀerences in ULL or PTA.
Audiological and Psychological Factors
Related to Misophonia Symptoms
Of 257 patients, SSSQ4 scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 were obtained
for 149 (58%), 49 (19%), 21 (8%) and 38 (15%), respectively. As
shown in Table 3 , there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in ULLmin,
HIQ, TIQ and SAD-T scores among patients with diﬀerent
SSSQ4 scores. Post hoc pairwise comparisons indicated that
ULLmin was signiﬁcantly lower only for patients who scored
3 compared to 0 for SSSQ4 ( p= 0.013). The other pairwise
comparisons were not signiﬁcant ( p>0.05). HIQ scores were
signiﬁcantly worse for patients whose SSSQ4 scores were 3 vs. 0
(p<0.0001), 2 vs. 0 ( p= 0.009), 3 vs. 1 ( p<0.0001) and 3 vs.
2 (p<0.0001). TIQ scores were signiﬁcantly worse for patients
whose SSSQ4 scores were 3 vs. 0 ( p<0.0001), 3 vs. 1 ( p<0.0001)
and 3 vs. 2 ( p= 0.005). SAD-T scores were signiﬁcantly worse for
patients whose SSSQ4 scores were 3 vs. 0 ( p<0.0001), 2 vs. 0
(p= 0.001), 3 vs. 1 ( p<0.0001) and 3 vs. 2 ( p= 0.041). The other
pairwise comparisons were not signiﬁcant ( p>0.05).
There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the average PTA across
ears for patients with diﬀerent SSSQ4 scores.As shown in Table 4 , there was no signiﬁcant correlation
between the SSSQ4 scores and the average PTA values across
ears. There were moderate to strong correlations between SSSQ4
scores and scores for the TIQ, HIQ, and SAD-T. Greater
frequency of being bothered by certain sounds was associated
with greater impact of tinnitus, greater impact of hyperacusis,
and greater incidence of symptoms of anxiety and depression.
SSSQ4 scores were moderately correlated with ULL slope values;
a higher frequency of being bothered by speciﬁc sounds was
associated with a greater ULL slope. There was a moderate
negative correlation between SSSQ4 scores and ULLmin values
and weak negative correlations with HTL slopes and with ages.
The variables that were signiﬁcantly correlated with SSSQ4
scores were included in logistic regression models to assess their
inﬂuence on the OR of an SSSQ4 score of 1, 2, or 3 relative to
a score of 0. The predictor variables were: (a) absence versus
presence of hyperacusis based on ULLmin values; (b) category of
tinnitus impact as measured via the TIQ; (c) no versus signiﬁcant
hyperacusis impact as measured via the HIQ; (d) absence versus
presence of anxiety and depression as measured via the SAD-T,
(e) ULL slope <20 dB versus 20 dB; and (f) HTL slope <20 dB
versus 20 dB. When all measures were treated as independent
(columns 2 and 3 of Table 5 ), the resulting non-adjusted ORs
diﬀered signiﬁcantly from 1 for all predictors, with the largest
eﬀects for tinnitus impact category being moderate or severe,
signiﬁcant impact of hyperacusis, and presence of symptoms of
anxiety and depression.
Columns 4 and 5 of Table 5 show the outcomes of a model
including all six independent variables but adjusted for age and
gender and taking into account the eﬀect of each of the six
variables on the other variables. The number of patients included
in the adjusted model was 120, as complete data for all measures
were not available for all patients. For this model, the variables
that signiﬁcantly increased the likelihood of an SSSQ4 score
above 0 were: (a) a severe impact of tinnitus; (b) a signiﬁcant
impact of hyperacusis; and (c) having symptoms of anxiety and
depression. A diﬀerence in HTLs across frequency of 20 dB or
more, associated with a high-frequency hearing loss, decreased
the likelihood of an SSSQ4 score above 0.
DISCUSSION
Our results showed that 42% of patients seeking help for
tinnitus and/or hyperacusis presented with some symptoms of
misophonia. Twenty three percent of patients reported being
bothered by certain sounds on 7-14 days in the last 14 days
(Miso Cat 1). There was no diﬀerence in the prevalence of
diﬀerent degrees of hearing loss among patients in Miso Cat
1 and Miso Cat 0, but a signiﬁcant proportion of patients in
both groups (more than 33%) had some degree of hearing loss,
indicating that misophonia is not restricted to those with normal
hearing. The percentage of patients with hearing loss among
those with misophonia symptoms reported here is higher than
reported in previous studies. For example, Enzler et al. (2021b)
reported that 22% of individuals with misophonia as measured
via the MisoQuest had self-reported hearing issues and Siepsiak

et al. (2022) reported hearing loss in 16% of participants with
misophonia, as diagnosed using the criteria of Schroder et al.
(2013). Most of the patients in those studies were recruited
via social media, so their study population was diﬀerent from
that for our study.
Although the presence or absence of hearing loss did not seem
to be related to the presence of misophonia symptoms, a steep
slope of the audiogram, with greater loss at high frequencies,
was associated with a reduced risk of misophonia. This probably
occurs because some of the triggers for misophonia are sounds
whose spectrum is dominated by high frequencies, such as
the sound of crispy foods (Dacremont, 1995). Hearing loss at
high frequencies reduces the likelihood that such trigger sounds
will be audible.
The presence of symptoms of misophonia was not
signiﬁcantly related to between-ear diﬀerences in HTL or ULL.This indicates that the underlying mechanism of misophonia is
unlikely to be related to asymmetric pathologies of the peripheral
auditory pathway; rather, a more central mechanism is involved.
This is consistent with imaging studies reporting altered non-
auditory areas in the brain among patients with misophonia
compared with healthy controls (Kumar et al., 2017, Lin et al.,
2020).
In this paper, one of the criteria for indicating the presence of
hyperacusis was a ULLmin value 77 dB HL (the other criterion
was HIQ score). The use of ULLs for diagnosing hyperacusis has
been challenged by several authors; some studies have reported
that ULLs averaged across frequency were not signiﬁcantly
correlated with self-report measures of hyperacusis (Khalfa et al.,

Variables included in the model were the presence or absence of hyperacusis based on ULLmin (across-frequency average uncomfortable loudness level for the ear
with lower average ULL), tinnitus impact category based on scores for the TIQ (Tinnitus Impact Questionnaire), hyperacusis impact category based on scores for the
HIQ (Hyperacusis Impact Questionnaire), presence of anxiety and depression symptoms as measured via the SAD-T (Screening for Anxiety and Depression-Tinnitus),
presence or absence of across-frequency difference in ULLs based on the average ULL slope (the values of the difference in ULLs between 8 and 1 kHz) across ears,
and presence or absence of across-frequency difference in HTLs based on the HTL slope (values of the differences in hearing threshold levels between 8 and 1 kHz)
across ears. Unadjusted and adjusted OR values and their 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) are shown. The adjusted OR takes into account the effects of age and gender
in addition to the effects of other variables in the model. Signiﬁcant p values are indicated in bold font.
2000). For example, Goldstein and Shulman (1996) suggested
that ULLs between 80 and 90 dB HL at two or more frequencies
indicate mild hyperacusis, ULLs between 65 and 75 dB HL
indicate moderate hyperacusis and ULLs below 60 dB HL indicate
severe hyperacusis. Anari et al. (1999) suggested 70 dB HL
as the cutoﬀ value indicating signiﬁcant hyperacusis. Jastreboﬀ
and Jastreboﬀ (2000) suggested that “threshold of signiﬁcant
hyperacusis is deﬁned as average LDLs below 100 dB HL ” (LDL
stands for loudness discomfort level, which is another term for
ULL). Sheldrake et al. (2015) reported that if a criterion value of
100 dB HL for ULLs averaged across 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz (denoted
ULL 0:5 4) is used, this results in a positive diagnosis for 90% of
those with hyperacusis, but results in a high false positive rate of
60% (and a corresponding speciﬁcity of only 40%).
Sherlock and Formby (2005) reported that among individuals
with no complaint of hyperacusis the average value of ULL 0:5 4
was 102 dB HL (SD = 12 dB). They showed that 50% ofpeople with no hyperacusis had average ULL 0:5 4values less
than 105 dB HL, 25% had ULL 0:5 4values less than 94 dB
HL, and 5% had ULL 0:5 4values less than 80 dB HL. To avoid
excessive false positives when diagnosing hyperacusis based on
ULL 0:5 4, the lower 95% bound of the global mean for people
without hyperacusis can be used as the cutoﬀ; this is obtained
by subtracting from that mean 1.96 times the square root of the
variance of the mean, giving a value of 80 dB HL based on the
data of Sherlock and Formby (2005).
Aazh and Moore (2017b) took a diﬀerent approach. As
noted earlier, they based their analyses on the average ULL
across 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz for the ear with
lower average ULLs, denoted ULLmin. They chose a cutoﬀ
value for ULLmin corresponding to the 95% upper bound of
the ULLmin values for people with hyperacusis as diagnosed
via the score for Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ) (Khalfa
et al., 2002); this was obtained by adding 1.96 times the

Aazh et al. Audiological Characteristics of Misophonia
square root of the variance of the global mean ULLmin
value to the global mean value, based on the clinical data
of patients seen in a tinnitus and hyperacusis service. The
resulting value was 77 dB HL. For this criterion, anyone with
ULLmin 77 dB HL is diagnosed as having hyperacusis. Based
on the data reported by Aazh and Moore (2017b), sensitivity with
this criterion is 53% and speciﬁcity is 79%. Thus, the cutoﬀ
value of 77 dB HL only rarely results in false positives. The
ULLmin criterion of 77 dB has recently been used in a study of
Enzler et al. (2021a), who proposed a novel method of assessing
hyperacusis using psychoacoustic ratings of natural sounds. Their
results showed good consistency of the new psychoacoustic
method in diagnosing hyperacusis with the ULLmin criterion.
Note, however, that whatever criterion is chosen, diagnosis of
hyperacusis based on ULLs is imperfect. That is why, in the
present study, HIQ scores were used in addition to ULLs.
The average value of ULLmin was 74 dB HL for those in Miso
Cat 1 and 79 dB HL for those in Miso Cat 0, and this diﬀerence
was signiﬁcant. Also, there was a moderate negative correlation
between SSSQ4 scores and ULLmin values. In other words, those
with low ULLmin values were more likely to show symptoms
of misophonia. In contrast, Siepsiak et al. (2022) reported no
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in average ULLs across ears
between patients with and without misophonia, although there
was a trend in the same direction as found in the present
study. The diﬀerence across studies may be a consequence of the
diﬀerent study populations, but may also be related to diﬀerences
in the method for measuring ULLs. The maximum presentation
level used by Siepsiak et al. (2022) ranged from 90 to 120 dB
HL depending on the test frequency. In our study, the level was
limited to 80 dB HL regardless of frequency in order to avoid
discomfort, as recommended by Aazh and Moore (2017c).
One concern is the extent to which the cap of 80 dB HL
inﬂuenced the values of ULLmin. There were very few cases
of patients who were classiﬁed as having hyperacusis based on
ULLmin who did not press the button indicating the onset of
discomfort at a level of 80 dB HL or below, so the artiﬁcial value of
85 dB was used only rarely, and then usually only for one or two
frequencies. Thus, the cap of 80 dB HL had very little inﬂuence
on the values of ULLmin among those who were classiﬁed as
having hyperacusis based on ULLmin. For patients who were
not classiﬁed as having hyperacusis based on ULLmin, 59 and 70
(out of 133) did not press the button at 80 dB HL or below for
the left and right ears, respectively. Therefore, the cap of 80 dB
HL would have reduced the mean ULLmin value among patients
who were not classiﬁed as having hyperacusis based on ULLmin
values. The overall eﬀect of the cap was to reduce the diﬀerence
in average ULLmin values for those diagnosed as having versus
not having hyperacusis. It is likely that the diﬀerences in ULLmin
values between those in Miso Cat 0 and Miso Cat 1 would have
been even larger if the cap of 80 dB HL had not been imposed.
The ULL slope was signiﬁcantly higher (steeper) for patients
in Miso Cat 1 than for patients in Miso Cat 0. The ULL
slope values were moderately correlated with SSSQ4 scores,
indicating that patients with misophonia symptoms are likely
to be more bothered by high-frequency sounds than by low-
frequency sounds. This is consistent with the ﬁnding thatsounds with strong concentrations of energy in the range 2.5 to
5.5 kHz are associated with auditory perceptual unpleasantness
for normal subjects (Halpern et al., 1986; Kumar et al., 2008). The
auditory system is maximally sensitive over this frequency range,
in that absolute thresholds are lowest, and for a given sound level
loudness is greatest (Moore et al., 1997). This sensitivity may be
magniﬁed in patients with misophonia, as has been observed for
individuals with noise sensitivity (Kliuchko et al., 2016). High
sensitivity to high-frequency sounds has also been reported for
cases of severe hyperacusis (Aazh and Moore, 2018) and many
of the patients in our sample with higher SSSQ4 scores also had
hyperacusis as measured via the HIQ and ULLmin.
The proportion of patients who had seen mental health
professionals was signiﬁcantly higher for Miso Cat 1 than for
Miso Cat 0. This is consistent with the ﬁnding of Kılıç et al. (2021)
that contact with mental health services for any psychological
problem was more common among those with misophonia than
among those without (48 vs. 29%). The present study showed
that SAD-T scores were moderately correlated with SSSQ4
scores. This is consistent with other reports of a relationship
between misophonia and mental illness (Guetta et al., 2022;
Siepsiak et al., 2022). More in-depth investigation is needed
to shed light on the directionality of the association between
misophonia and psychiatric disorders/symptoms. Speciﬁcally, it
would be useful to assess whether the chance of being aﬀected by
psychiatric disorders is higher when misophonia already exists
(Erfanian et al., 2019).
A new ﬁnding of our study was that the proportion of patients
with a childhood history of parental mental illness was higher for
Miso Cat 1 (45%) than for Miso Cat 0 (27%). This is consistent
with reports of a higher impact of tinnitus, hyperacusis-induced
anxiety, and depression symptoms among patients who reported
that during their ﬁrst 18 years of life their parent(s) suﬀered
from a mental illness (Aazh et al., 2018, 2019a,c, 2020). Mounting
evidence suggests that adverse childhood experiences play a
major lifelong role in mental and physical problems (Anda
et al., 2006, 2010; Erfanian, 2018). Parental mental illness is an
important form of adverse childhood experiences (Anda et al.,
2006). Future studies should explore the history of exposure to
various childhood adverse experiences, ranging from diﬀerent
forms of abuse (physical, emotional, or sexual), neglect (physical
and emotional) and various aspects of household dysfunction
(substance abuse in the family, parental mental illness, mother
treated violently, imprisoned household member, or parental
separation) among patients with misophonia (Felitti et al.,
1998; Felitti, 2009). This is important because, if a signiﬁcant
relationship exists, the presence of more severe misophonia
symptoms in patients could be an indicator of childhood adverse
experiences. Patients with a history of childhood adversities often
need more complex and in-depth psychological treatments for
their mental health should they develop emotional problems
(Pigeon et al., 2009; Kajeepeta et al., 2015).
Scores for the TIQ and HIQ were signiﬁcantly worse for
patients in Miso Cat 1 than for those in Miso Cat 0. Also,
TIQ scores were moderately correlated with SSSQ4 scores
and HIQ scores were strongly correlated with SSSQ4 scores.
The adjusted logistic regression model showed that patients

Aazh et al. Audiological Characteristics of Misophonia
with a severe impact of tinnitus and a signiﬁcant impact of
hyperacusis were more likely to have a higher SSSQ4 score.
To the best of our knowledge, these are novel ﬁndings. This
is consistent with the similarity of the neuropathology of
misophonia, hyperacusis and tinnitus, as indicated by altered
auditory-limbic system connections (Kumar et al., 2017; Lin
et al., 2020), micro-structural alternations of white matter in non-
auditory regions (Chen et al., 2020; Eijsker et al., 2021a), and
functional connectivity among auditory cortex, cerebellum and
the limbic system (Kumar et al., 2017; Cai et al., 2019; Eijsker
et al., 2021b). A similar relationship has been reported between
tinnitus and hyperacusis: patients with a more severe impact of
tinnitus also tend to have more severe symptoms of hyperacusis
(Aazh and Moore, 2017d; Cederroth et al., 2020; Aazh et al.,
2021).
The adjusted logistic regression model also showed that a score
of 4 or more for the SAD-T signiﬁcantly increased the odds
of having a higher SSSQ4 score, consistent with the idea that
misophonia is associated with anxiety and depression. Given that
misophonia leads to signiﬁcant emotional distress, interpersonal
and social diﬃculties, disability, and interference with daily life,
it is not surprising that it contributes to the development of
anxiety and depression. Suﬀerers may also experience functional
impairments, such as diﬃculty in performing their job and
concentration diﬃculties (Swedo et al., 2022). Finally, the
adjusted model showed that a slope of the audiogram of 20 dB or
more signiﬁcantly decreased the odds of having a higher SSSQ4
score, consistent with the idea that reduced audibility of high-
frequency sounds decreases the chances of misophonia trigger
sounds being audible. There is a gap in our understanding of
the function of auditory system in this patient population, and
future studies should explore other characteristics of the auditory
system among patients with misophonia using psycho-acoustic
and electrophysiological measures.
This study was based on a retrospective analysis of the
available clinical data for patients seen during the years 2019
and 2020. Therefore, we were limited to the measures that
were obtained as a part of routine clinical practice at the
THTSC during that time. Misophonia was assessed based on
only one question (item 4 of the SSSQ). This is not unusual
for clinical services, since misophonia questionnaires have not
yet been widely adopted by audiologists in day-to-day clinical
practice. However, we recognize that using only one question
to assess misophonia is not ideal, although it has been done by
other researchers for assessing misophonia, hyperacusis severity,
hearing impairment and tinnitus severity (Schecklmann et al.,
2014; Greenberg and Carlos, 2018; Cederroth et al., 2020; Jaswal
et al., 2021). Also, the validity and reliability of using SSSQ4
to assess the frequency of reported misophonia symptoms have
not been evaluated. Therefore, the results of our correlational
and regression modeling need to be interpreted with caution.
To address this limitation, future studies should use validated
measures to assess the relationship between misophonia and
measures of the impact of tinnitus and hyperacusis, measures of
anxiety and depression, and hearing-related variables. Examples
of these measures are MisoQuest (Siepsiak et al., 2020),
the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (Schroder et al., 2013;Naylor et al., 2021), the Misophonia Response Scale (Dibb
et al., 2021), the Core Discriminant Sounds of Misophonia
(Enzler et al., 2021b), the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire
(Rosenthal et al., 2021) and the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ)
(Wu et al., 2014).
Another limitation is that all patients were referred to an
audiology clinic for tinnitus and/or hyperacusis management.
Therefore, our results are probably not representative of
the general population or of patients referred to mental
health services.
CONCLUSION
Among a population seeking help from an audiology clinic
for tinnitus and/or hyperacusis, 23% were classiﬁed as having
misophonia. The presence and frequency of reported symptoms
of misophonia were not related to audiometric thresholds, or
to the asymmetry of audiometric thresholds across ears, except
that a steeply sloping audiogram reduced the likelihood of
more frequently reported misophonia symptoms in a 2-week
period. The latter eﬀect may reﬂect the ﬁnding that the sounds
that trigger misophonia often contain signiﬁcant energy at
high frequencies, and high-frequency hearing loss reduces the
likelihood of such sounds being audible. Those with higher
SSSQ4 scores had lower values of ULLmin (the across-frequency
average of ULLs for the ear with lower average ULLs) than those
with lower SSSQ4 scores. The frequency of reported misophonia
symptoms as measured via SSSQ4 increased with increasing
impact of tinnitus. Using a logistic regression model adjusted
for the eﬀects of age and gender, it was found that a TIQ score
9 increased the odds of reporting misophonia symptoms by a
factor of 5.4. Using the same adjusted model, it was found that an
HIQ score>11 (indicating a signiﬁcant impact of hyperacusis)
increased the odds of reporting misophonia symptoms by a factor
of 3.9. Using the same adjusted model, it was found that a SAD-
T score 4 (indicating symptoms of anxiety and depression)
increased the odds of reporting misophonia symptoms by a factor
of 2.8. We conclude that, when assessing individuals with tinnitus
and hyperacusis, it is important to screen for misophonia,
particularly when ULLmin is abnormally low or the TIQ, HIQ
or SAD-T score is abnormally high. This will help clinicians
to distinguish misophonia from similar disorders, guiding the
choice of therapeutic strategies.
