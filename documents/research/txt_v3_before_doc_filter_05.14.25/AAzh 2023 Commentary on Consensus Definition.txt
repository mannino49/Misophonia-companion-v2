There are diﬀerent types of sound intolerance ranging from misophonia and
hyperacusis to noise sensitivity ( Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2002 ;Aazh et al., 2014 ,2018;
Henry et al., 2022 ). The focus of this paper is on misophonia. There are conﬂicting
results about the prevalence of misophonia ranging from 5 to 49.1% ( Wu et al., 2014 ;
Siepsiak et al., 2020 ;Naylor et al., 2021 ;Jakubovski et al., 2022 ). There are also debates
aboutthemechanismofmisophoniainﬁeldsofpsychiatry,neurology,andneuroscience
(Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2003 ;Cavanna and Seri, 2015 ;Erfanian et al., 2019 ). For
example, some researchers classify misophonia as a psychiatric illness ( Schroder et al.,
2013) and others as a neurodevelopmental disorder ( Cavanna and Seri, 2015 ). In the
ﬁeld of audiology, misophonia is often considered as a subtype of hyperacusis rather
than a distinct disorder ( Tyler et al., 2014 ). Therefore, most research studies in the ﬁeld
of audiology have not distinguished misophonia from hyperacusis ( Fackrell et al., 2015 ;
Sheldrake et al., 2015 ;Zaugg et al., 2016 ;Aazh et al., 2017 ).Tyler et al. (2014) described
fourcategoriesofhyperacusiscomprising(1)loudnesshyperacusis,(2)fearhype racusis,
(3)painhyperacusis,and(4)annoyancehyperacusiswhichoverlapswithmisophonia.
Recently, the Milken Institute Center for Strategic Philanthropy through a gra nt
from The REAM Foundation’s Misophonia Research Fund, assembled a group
of scientiﬁc researchers and clinicians with expertise in misophonia and related
topics in order to develop a consensus deﬁnition for misophonia ( Swedo et al.,
2022). To raise awareness about this consensus deﬁnition among audiologists and
to promote its future reﬁnements, the REAM Foundation and Milken Institute’s
Center for Strategic Philanthropy have commissioned this commentary. The aim
of this commentary is to independently review the methodology and outcome
of the paper by Swedo et al. (2022). This commentary is structured into two
main headings comprising: (1) discourse on the method, and (2) discourse on the

results. Each section starts by discussing the beneﬁts of the
consensus followed by reviewing its limitations and oﬀering
directionsforfuturework.
Discourse on the method
Swedo et al. (2022) used a modiﬁed Delphi method to
developtheconsensus.Thismethodhasbeenusedinhealthcare
for ﬁve decades ( Gustafson et al., 1973 ). The main aim is to
gatherexperts’opinionsinasystematicmannerintheabsenceof
research evidence and/or widely agreed theoretical frameworks
on a particular topic. Using the Delphi method, Swedo et al.
(2022) structured the communication process among a group
of experts and facilitated achieving a consensus deﬁnition for
misophonia.However,becausetheconsensushasbeenachieved
itdoesn’tmeanthattherightdeﬁnitionformisophoniahasbeen
produced. Therefore, it is important to discuss strengths and
weaknesses of the methods used as well as analyze the outcome
inordertogivedirectionstofutureworkonthistopic.
Beneﬁts
Thisistheﬁrstsystematicprojectthatachievedaconsensus
on a foundational deﬁnition for misophonia. As the study was
mainly an internet-based inquiry, it is consistent with e-Delphi
method ( Donohoe et al., 2012 ). Use of e-Delphi methodology
provided the researchers with several beneﬁts comprising: (1)
access to a wide range of experts from diﬀerent locations,
(2) cost-eﬀectiveness, (3) good response and retention rates,
and (4) oﬀering equal opportunity to the committee members
to express their opinions ( Gordon and Pease, 2006 ). This e-
Delphiinvolvedasystematicreviewoftheliteratureandseveral
rounds of discussion and independent voting ( viainternet)
by a committee of 15 invited experts and facilitated by the
staﬀ at Milken Institute. The committee included clinicians
andresearchersfromdiﬀerentdisciplinescomprisingaudiology,
neuroscience, psychology, neuropsychology, and psychiatry.
Based on the review of literature the facilitators created a list of
possibledeﬁnitionsformisophoniaanditsdomainswhichwent
through the process of discussion and voting. “Consensus” was
consideredas80%agreementofallcommitteememberspresent
when a given vote was conducted. The voting was anonymous
whichenabledthecommitteememberstoendorsethedeﬁnition
that they approved without problems associated with face-to-
face disagreements. Using this systematic process by Swedo
et al.(2022) was beneﬁcial because it allowed for a group of
experts with diverse professional background to examine the
empirical studies on misophonia, discuss their agreements and
disagreements and to achieve a consensus. They included input
of all committee members which minimized some of the biases
arisingfromunbalancedinputofafewparticipants.Limitations
Literature search
The search strategy did not identify some of the studies
on relevant topics (e.g., hyperacusis, noise sensitivity/noise
annoyance, sensory processing disorders and autism spectrum
disorder) in which some of the characteristics of misophonia
in contexts of audiology, psychoacoustics, developmental
psychology and environmental noise and health have been
discussed ( Bregman and Pearson, 1972 ;Guski et al., 1999 ;
Aazh and Moore, 2017 ,2018;Aazh et al., 2018 ;Danesh
et al., 2021 ;Enzler et al., 2021 ). Reviewing such studies can
improve our knowledge about possible underlying mechanisms
of misophonia. Consistent with this, Brout(2022) challenged
theoverallliteraturereviewstrategyintheconsensuspaperand
highlighted its limitation as being too focused on observable
behaviorsandleavingoutpostulatedmechanisms.Shesuggested
that principles of Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) ( Sanislow
et al., 2010 ) should be used. RDoC promotes research that
focuses on investigating the biological, physiological, and
behavioralelementsthatcompriseanillnessratherthanfocusing
on symptom-based diagnosis ( Sanislow et al., 2010 ). It is worth
mentioningthatthemembersoftheconsensuscommitteewere
pioneers in misophonia research and have conducted many
research studies consistent with RDoC principles. However,
their conclusion was that as the underlying mechanism of
misophonia is not fully understood, the inclusion of postulated
mechanismstothedeﬁnitionwasnotjustiﬁed.
Committee members bias
OnerecognizedlimitationinDelphimethodisitrelianceon
the opinion of experts on a topic. The individual experts can be
sensitive about the topic, have conﬂicting theoretical positions,
or be inﬂuenced by various professional or political agendas.
Therefore, the data collected from experts may knowingly or
unknowinglybebiased( TuroﬀandLinstone,2002 ).
Representativeness of the committee
The committee did not include non-professionals
or individuals who themselves suﬀer from misophonia.
Involvement of individuals with misophonia could challenge
some of the concepts agreed by the professionals within the
Delphi process and minimize the so called inbreeding of the
viewpoints( Linstone,2002 ).
Anonymity
The discussion round was not anonymous, and
the committee members took part in a meeting via
video for exchange of ideas. This can produce some
limitations as the less conﬁdent members may be

unwilling to participate in discussions. In other words,
conﬁdence, deference, and shyness could have inﬂuenced
some of the conclusions drawn ( McKenna, 1994 ). This
can damage the integrity of the data ( Chou, 2002 ).
However, Swedo et al. (2022)’s study had 4 rounds of
anonymous voting which is likely to have provided the
committee members with plenty of opportunity to express
theirviews.
Accountability
Although anonymity is an important principle in Delphi
method, it can impact on accountability ( McKenna, 1994 ). In
the misophonia study, the rounds of voting were completely
anonymous.Therefore,anindividualcommitteemembercould
have provided unjustiﬁed answers as their response will never
beattributedtothem.Accountabilitycanbeimprovedbyasking
follow-upquestionsinordertogetclariﬁcationandjustiﬁcation

Discourse on the results
Beneﬁts
The e-Delphi study achieved consensus on describing
misophonia and factors related to it. The work conducted by
Swedo et al. (2022) is beneﬁcial to healthcare professionals as
it confers validity and speciﬁcity to misophonia. The result
from the e-Delphi study (summarized in Table1) is beneﬁcial
to patients too because it helps to understand their uniqueexperienceofmisophonia,appreciatethenatureoftheproblem
that aﬀects them and the relational eﬀects on families and
communities. Swedo et al. (2022)’s work takes us closer to the
truth which subsequently can facilitate future treatments and
supportforthispopulation.
As shown in Table1, the consensus produced one general
description for misophonia and ﬁve domains comprising: (1)
misophonic triggers, (2) reactions to misophonic triggers, (3)
inﬂuences on reaction, (4) functional impairments, and (5)
relationshiptootherconditions/disorders.
The general description of misophonia emphasizes that
the main characteristic of misophonia is decreased tolerance
to speciﬁc sounds leading to disproportionate reactions. The
consensus covers a wide range of common misophonic triggers
and the suﬀerer’s reaction to them. They also elaborate that
the individual’s reaction is not always disproportionate, and it
depends on the context and the source of the trigger. Swedo
et al.(2022) described that misophonia can limit individuals’
activities, restrict their participation in social and familial life,
andimpactontheirpsychologicalwellbeing.Finally,theyagreed
that other comorbid disorders with misophonia need to be
investigatedandtreatedwhenneeded.

only in Round 4 of the voting they reached an agreement that
misophonia should be described as a “disorder.” However, the
committeeagreedthatthescientiﬁcevidenceregardingwhether
to classify misophonia as a “medical” or “psychiatric” disorder
wasinsuﬃcient.Althoughconsideringmisophoniaasadisorder
isconsistentwiththenegativeexperienceofsomeofthesuﬀerers
(especially patients who seek help from professionals), it may
not be true for everyone with misophonia. As the underlying
mechanism of misophonia is not fully understood, classifying it
as a disorder at this stage may be premature. Moreover, Naylor
et al.(2021) conducted an online survey completed by medical
students at University of Nottingham in the UK. They found
that 49.1% of 336 respondents had misophonia as measured
by the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S) ( Schroder
et al., 2013 ). Although this high prevalence may be as the result
of their survey method or characteristics of their participants,
it would be unreasonable to suggest that about 50% of this
sample had a “disorder.” It is possible that misophonia has
a spectrum and on the extreme end it can be a debilitating
disorder and on the other end it may represent a less common
presentation of natural human variation. This is consistent
with the concept of neurodiversity ( Blume, 1998 ). According to
neurodiversity principles, classifying misophonia as a disorder
can be stigmatizing and results in a focus on dysfunctions
and impairments as opposed to focusing on understanding
the diﬀerences between people ( Kapp et al., 2013 ). Instead,
misophonia can be described as an “experience”. This shifts the
balancefromconsideringitasa“disorder”thatisdysfunctional
and should be cured to promoting accommodation/adjustment
in work place, school, and other public places in order to
improve quality of life for people who experience misophonia
(Porcaro et al., 2019 ). To sum up, more research is needed
to explore misophonia phenomenon and to understand if it is
indeed a disorder. In the meantime, clinicians can beneﬁt from
the consensus deﬁnition ( Table1) as a guide that highlights
factors that they need to explore with their patients in order
to fully understand their experience of misophonia and to
appreciate the nature of the problems faced by them, its
relationaleﬀectontheirfamiliesandtoformulateindividualized
treatmentplanandcare.
Distinguishing misophonia from hyperacusis
and noise sensitivity
It can be important to diﬀerentiate misophonia from
other types of sound intolerance (e.g., hyperacusis and noise
sensitivity/noise annoyance). Hyperacusis is deﬁned as an
intolerance of certain everyday sounds, which are perceived
as too loud or uncomfortable and which cause signiﬁcant
distressandimpairmentintheindividual’sday-to-dayactivities
(Aazh et al., 2022b ). For an individual with hyperacusis,
certain everyday sounds, such as kitchen noises, bangs, music,
slamming doors, water running, cutlery on plates, traﬃc noise,hair dryers, and hand dryers, are perceived as too loud,
uncomfortable,orpainful.Noisesensitivityisapersonalitytrait
about attitudes toward noise in general ( Baliatsas et al., 2016 ).
A person with high noise sensitivity may perceive noise caused
by neighbors, nearby factories, workshops, farms, radiators,
air conditioning, and background music as disruptive and
distressing( Weinstein,1978 ).Futuredeﬁnitionsformisophonia
may include statements excluding the possibility of hyperacusis
and/or noise sensitivity. For example, to exclude hyperacusis,
this statement can be used: “The person’s primary reaction to
sounds is not aural pain or physical discomfort in their ears
due to excessive loudness of the sounds.” To exclude noise
sensitivity, this statement can be used: “The person’s sound
intolerance is not better explained by their general attitude
toward noise and environmental noise pollution (e.g., noise
from neighbors, nearby airports, traﬃc, workshops, internal
plumbing, or air conditioning).” These are just examples
and adoption of such statements needs to be supported by
empiricalevidence.
How to establish if symptoms of misophonia
are better explained by any co-occurring
disorders?
According to the consensus deﬁnition, misophonia
is present if its symptoms are not better explained by
something else. In other words, an individual who exhibits
a disproportionate emotional, physiological, or behavioral
reaction when exposed to misophonic triggers may not
necessarily have misophonia. Their symptoms may be better
explainedbyaco-occurringdisorder.Inthissection,thefocusis
to discuss how symptoms of co-occurring disorders (excluding
hyperacusis and noise sensitivity which have already been
discussed in the previous section) can be misinterpreted as
misophonia. To make this matter clearer several examples are
given here: (1) Schroder et al. (2013) explained that although
an individual might feel distressed when exposed to certain
oral/nasaltriggers,theirreactionmayberelatedtotheirgeneral
obsession about contamination and to an underlying anxiety
disorder, as opposed to misophonia. (2) Cavanna and Seri
(2015) reported that in certain individuals, behavioral reactions
to misophonic triggers such as mimicking or reproducing the
triggers can be related to an underlying tic disorder as opposed
to misophonia. (3) In the Third International Conference
on Hyperacusis, Hashir Aazh discussed a case study of a
patient whose main reason for feeling anxious and angry
when exposed to the trigger sounds was her magical thinking
(Dubal and Viaud-Delmon, 2008 ), visual hallucinations and an
underlying psychosis as opposed to misophonia or hyperacusis
(Aazh et al., 2018 ). (4) Some individuals with tinnitus might
exhibit adverse reaction to certain misophonic triggers,
because they may be afraid that certain sounds can make
their tinnitus worse ( Aazh et al., 2022a ). Therefore, reaction

to misophonia triggers is because of their tinnitus as opposed
tomisophonia.
It is important to highlight that although misophonia can
coexist with other disorders, the possibility that misophonia
symptoms are not related to misophonia but to a co-occurring
conditionisveryrare(basedontheauthor’sclinicalexperience).
Conclusions
Themethodusedby Swedoetal. (2022)forthemisophonia
deﬁnition was an established method in health and social
care to gather experts’ opinions and to achieve a consensus
in the absence of complete empirical evidence or widely
agreed theories. The combination of the reliable techniques
and the systematic process utilized in this e-Delphi is likely
to have minimized the risk for bias as much as it was
possible. However, consensus is a viewpoint ( Vernon, 2009 ),
therefore it should not be misinterpreted as literal fact. To
further improve representativeness of the committee, future
studies should involve patients with a variety of misophonia
symptoms and severity. It may be premature to consider
misophonia as a disorder given the lack of empirical evidence
regarding any possible underlying pathology on one hand and
due to its seemingly high prevalence among the population
on the other. Future deﬁnitions can use certain criteria to
distinguish misophonia from hyperacusis and noise sensitivity.
It is possible that in some individuals, misophonia symptoms
are better explained by a co-occurring disorder, but this is
veryrare.Author contributions
