## 1   INTRODUCTION

everyday   sounds   that   are   often   repetitive   and   created   by   other   people,   such   as   smacking   or following,   a   presentation   of   misophonia   and   research   into   the   condition   will   be   given,   followed   by   a strong   negative   emotional,   physiological   and   often   also   behavioral   response.   This   reaction reports   that   the   condition   can   be   a   big   burden,   and   that   it   can   affect   relationships   or the   condition   is   still   unknown   to   many   and   the   knowledge   base   about   misophonia   is   very   deficient.   In   that (Potgieter   et   al.,   2019).   The   condition   is   characterized   by   reduced   tolerance   for   specific   substances breathing.   This   is   experienced   as   very   unpleasant   for   the   person   suffering   from   misophonia   and   it   triggers   a is   most   often   triggered   to   a   greater   extent   when   the   sound   is   made   by   someone   in   a   close   relationship.   People   with   misophonia Misophonia   is   a   little-explored   condition   that   has   received   increasing   attention   in   recent   decades function   in   daily   life   (Claiborn   et   al.,   2020;   Swedo   et   al.,   2022).   Despite   this   is presentation   of   this   study's   rationale.

## 1.1.1   Misophonia's   history

regardless   of   loudness   and   the   individual   may   have   normal   hearing   abilities   (Jastreboff   &amp;   Jastreboff, used   in   2001   by   researchers   Margaret   Jastreboff   and   Pawel   Jastreboff   in   an   article   in Audiology Misophonia   can   be   characterized   as   a   variant   of   reduced   sound   tolerance.   Reduced   sound   tolerance   is   one obtained   documentation   on   around   500   cases   with   S4   by   discussing   the   condition   in   forums The   first   descriptions   of   the   phenomenon   can   also   be   attributed   to   audiologist   Marsha   Johnson   who   on lydtolerance   (Danesh   &amp;   Aazh,   2020). would   not   usually   elicit   the   same   reaction   in   other   individuals.   The   reaction   can   be   triggered 2015).   The   term   misophonia   (English:   misophonia)   can   be   translated   as   "hatred   of   sound"   and   was   first Online about   various   forms   of   reduced   sound   tolerance   (Jastreboff   &amp;   Jastreboff,   2001).   One   of   them the   end   of   the   90s   suggested   the   term selective   sound   sensitivity   syndrome (S4).

In   the   80s,   Pawel   Jastreboff   developed   among and   award-winning   (The   International   Misophonia   Research   Network,   2018a,   2018b).   In   the   article tinnitus   and   reduced   sound   tolerance   had   noticed   a   group   of   patients   with   a   specific When   Jastreboff   and   Jastreboff   formed   the   term   misophonia,   they   had   been   for   several   decades

smaller   group   of   the   patients   they   worked   with   showed   a   fear   of   sound   (Jastreboff   &amp;   Jastreboff, the   auditory   system   when   exposed   to   sound.   This   causes   the   person   to   experience   physical   discomfort misophonia,   which   was   composed   of   the   Greek   prefixes   for   hate/dislike   (miso)   and   sound/voice is   often   described   as   sound   hurting.   According   to   Jastreboff   and   Jastreboff,   phonophobia   is   not   due   to   one resulting   in   a   fear   of   certain   sounds.   The   researchers   described   that   a   significant   group   of   patients pattern   of   symptoms   that   were   not   adequately   described   by   the   terms   they   had aversive   reaction.   To   describe   this   form   of   reduced   sound   tolerance,   they   developed   the   term this   patient   group.   Hyperacusis   can   be   defined   as   an   abnormally   strong   activation   of (phony).   They   also   suggested   that   phonophobia   could   be   understood   as   a   subcategory   of   misophonia,   then   only   one 2001). by   exposure   to   sounds   that   others   would   not   normally   have   reacted   to,   and   the   experience overactivation   in   the   auditory   system,   but   rather   in   the   autonomic   and   limbic   system,   and available.   Until   now,   they   had   used   the   terms hyperacusis and phonophobia in   their   work which   was   described   with   the   term   phonophobia   did   not   exhibit   a fear of   sound   at   all,   but   rather   a   strong   one hyperacusis,   misophonia   and   phonophobia   (Jastreboff   &amp;   Jastreboff,   2002).   Since   this   has   misophonia about   misophonia   (Edelstein   et   al.,   2013),   but   in   the   last   decade   the   amount   of   publications   about In   2002,   Jastreboff   and   Jastreboff   published   the   first   article   in   a   peer-reviewed   journal sensitivity   syndrome'   is   also   used   somewhat   in   the   research   literature   (Sanchez   &amp;   Silva,   2018; such   as   audiology,   neuroscience   and   psychology   (Swedo   et   al.,   2022).   The   term   misophonia   has   been   given refer   to   sounds   that   trigger   a   misophonic   reaction   (Potgieter   et   al.,   2019).

## 1.1.2   The   development   of   a   research   field

in   all participants:   All   participants   reported   that   the   trigger   sounds   were   sounds   created   by   others people   who   reported   having   misophonia.   This   was   one   of   the   first   scientific   studies   of In   2013,   a   research   group   at   the   Amsterdam   University   Medical   Center   (AMC)   interviewed   42 misophonia   and   the   researchers   described   that   they   found   "a   remarkably   similar   pattern   of   symptoms"

immediately   triggered   an   aversive   reaction   that   began   with   irritation   or   disgust   and   quickly   subsided over   in   anger.   Participants   reported   that   the   intense   reaction   created   a   strong   sense   of   loss   of triggers   that   can   appear   in   the   environment   were   a   daily   burden   (Schröder   et   al.,   2013). could   also   develop   into   visual   triggers,   so   that   only   seeing   the   activity   associated   with the   sound   was   enough   to   create   a   reaction.   Some   of   the   participants   also   stated   that   certain   repetitive movements   such   as   shaking   a   leg   could   trigger   the   same   reaction.   Being   exposed   to   a   trigger   sound avoidance   strategies   to   avoid   triggers,   such   as   avoiding   specific   situations,   wearing people,   largely   sounds   related   to   eating   or   breathing.   Over   half   of   the   patients   were also   bothered   by   sounds   such   as   typing   on   a   keyboard   or   clicking   with   a   pen.   Trigger   sounds headphones   or   making   "counter   noises".   In   addition,   they   reported   that   constantly   trying   to   predict self-control   and   that   they   perceived   their   own   reaction   as   exaggerated   and   irrational,   and   that   to   lose self-control   in   such   a   situation   was   morally   unacceptable.   All   participants   used psychiatric   disorder   and   described   how   the   condition   differs   from   other   psychiatric   diagnoses such   as   specific   phobia,   social   phobia,   phonophobia,   PTSD,   intermittent   explosive   disorder, In   the   article,   Schröder   and   colleagues   (2013)   also   presented   a   proposal   for   diagnostic criteria   for   misophonia.   They   argued   that   misophonia   could   best   be   understood   as   a   separate version   of   their   proposed   diagnostic   criteria   for   misophonia   (Figure   1)   (Jager   et   al.,   2020). personality   disorder   and   autism   spectrum   disorder.   The   research   environment   at   AMC   has since   contributed   to   a   number   of   publications   on   misophonia,   and   in   2020   they   published   a   revised   one

Despite   an   ever-increasing   amount   of   research   and   consensus   in   the   field   about   several   of   the   condition's "psychiatric"   disorder,   and   that   it   cannot   be   ruled   out   that   the   condition   has   an   organic   nature sufficient   scientific   basis   to   publish   a   definition   of   the   condition's   classification another   for   the   condition's   classification   and   etiology,   which   is   not   yet   established   or   understood.   IN characteristics,   there   are   still   many   questions   that   need   to   be   answered.   This   applies   among causal   explanation   (Swedo   et   al.,   2022). conclusions   when   it   comes   to   whether   misophonia   can   best   be   understood   as   a   "medical"   or or   etiology.   The   interdisciplinary   panel   also   commented   that   it   is   not   possible   to   withdraw consensus   project   by   the   Misophonia   Research   Fund   it   was   concluded   that   it   is   not   yet

Nevertheless,   a   number   of   hypotheses   have   been   proposed   for   the   underlying   mechanisms. These   hypotheses   originate   in   different   fields   and   perspectives.   Jastreboff   and   Jastreboff   described   in

the   organization   "Misophonia   Treatment   Institute",   argues   that   misophonia   should the   auditory   system   and   the   autonomic   and   limbic   system,   or   an   increased   reactivity   in   the   two limbic   system.   They   further   describe   that   this   is   due   to   increased   connectivity   between is   related   to   learning   and   associations,   and   that   the   condition   gradually   develops   through is   classified   as   a   "conditioned   aversive   reflex   disorder".   He   argues   that   misophonia the   latter   systems   by   exposure   to   sound.   Tom   Dozier,   who,   among   other   things,   has   created their   article   from   2002   that   misophonia   can   be   understood   as   an   overactivation   in   the   autonomic   and classical   conditioning   (Dozier,   2015).

"attention   network".   Kumar   and   colleagues   recently   published   another   fMRI   study   in   which   they of   misophonia   should   therefore   focus   on   the   brain's   representation   of   movements   (Kumar   et   al., role   in   misophonia.   In   contrast   to   previous   fMRI   studies   (Giorgi,   2015)   this   study   found with   misophonia   and   fresh   control   groups   (Edelstein   et   al.,   2013;   Schröder   et   al.,   2014).

The   study,   on   the   other   hand,   shows   an   increase The   research   group   wanted   to   investigate   a   hypothesis   that   mirror   neurons   could   play   a   central   role brain   activity   during   misophonic   responses   to   repetitive   finger   sounds.

Hansen   and   colleagues   (2022)   investigated   this   hypothesis   further   and   researched also   stated   that   the   findings   could   have   major   implications   for   the   understanding   of   the   condition. physiological   activation   and   auditory   processing   and   found   significant   differences   between   people "mirroring"   movements   in   the   mouth   and   face   of   other   people.   Kumar   and   colleagues in   a  ater   fMRI   study,   Kumar   and   colleagues   (2017)   found,   among   other   things,   an   atypical   activation   in   the   brain l activation   in   brain   regions   linked   to   mirror   neurons   in   the   motor   cortex,   which   can   be   linked   to neurobiological   mechanisms.   The   first   experimental   studies   of   misophonia   investigated sound,   can   be   central   to   the   understanding   of   misophonia. colleagues   write   that   their   findings   show   that   the   hypothesis   advanced   by   Kumar   and   colleagues   is   not

Overall,   these   research   findings   show   that   the   neurobiological   mechanisms   associated   with connectivity   between   a   number   of   brain   regions,   such   as   between   the   prefrontal   cortex, understanding   of   the   condition.

## 1.2.   The   rationale   of   the   study

## 1.2.1   Background   for   the   research   interest

My   interest   in   researching   misophonia   stems   from   personal   experiences.   I   got   to   know

marvelous   or   comical.   During   my   time   as   a   student   at   the   Department   of   Psychology,   I   also   have gave   me   an   insight   into   how   this   condition   can   affect   a   person's   everyday   life   and   relationships.   IN the   relevant   knowledge   that   these   ailments   could   be   described   with   the   term   misophonia.   This I also   learned   that   this   is   an   unknown   phenomenon   for   most   people   and   that   it   could   be   perceived   as to   the   phenomenon   around   a   decade   ago   through   a   close   relationship.   A   few   years   later,   both   I   and thesis   in   2018,   I   delved   into   the   neurobiological   basis   of   misophonia, previously   used   the   opportunity   to   immerse   myself   in   the   topic   of   misophonia.   In   connection   with   a   smaller

wanted   to   contribute   to   a   study.   As   described   in   the   introduction,   there   are   also   more   recent   research   findings news   reports   about   people   with   misophonia.   I   took   this   as   income   for   my   assumption   that limited   amount   of   research   into   misophonia,   but   that   research   interest   had   been   increasing better   understanding   of   the   condition   (Swedo   et   al.,   2022).   With   this   as   a   backdrop,   I   wanted   to which   indicates   that   misophonia   may   be   widespread,   and   more   people   are   asking   for   more   research   that   can   contribute   to   this spotlight   on   the   condition.   As   mentioned,   several   Norwegian   media   in   recent   years   have   created there   is   a   certain   incidence   in   Norway   and   that   it   could   be   thought   that   some   of   these   people   too last   years.   This   led   to   my   desire   to   contribute   to   research   into   misophonia   and   to   correct   it and   I   thus   got   to   know   the   research   field.   It   became   clear   to   me   that   it   was   a   very design   a   study   with   the   aim   of   exploring   what   it   is   like   to   live   with   misophonia.

## 1.2.2   The   study's   design   and   scientific   theoretical   position

can   be   described   as interpretive (Hennink   et   al.,   2020).   A   frequently   used   method   within   this   research   tradition   is   a uses   this   meaning   in   negotiations   with   others   (Magnusson   &amp;   Marecek,   2015). qualitative   research   interview   (Brinkmann   &amp;   Kvale,   2018).   An   interview-based   qualitative   study which   people   attribute   to   events   or   phenomena,   how   they   understand   this   themselves   and   how   they is   used   to   study   people's   lived   experiences   and   experiences   from   this   person's   perspective For   the   purpose   of   the   study,   I   chose   a   qualitative   methodological   approach.   A   qualitative   approach   can research   where   the   researcher   tries   to   understand   the   content   of   meaning emphasizes   interpretation   in   the   research   process.   It   is   also   ideographic   as   it phenomenology,   hermeneutics   and   ideography.   The   method   is   phenomenological   as   it   lays hermeneutic   science   position   (Smith   et   al.,   2009;   Van   Manen,   1990).   I   took emphasis   on   studying   people's   experiences   and   experiences.   It   is   also   hermeneutic   as   it emphasizes   studying   the   specific,   rather   than   the   general   (Smith   et   al.,   2009).   Based   on   mine colleagues   (2009).   This   qualitative   method   is   rooted   in   the   theoretical   directions   of   science starting   from   the   method   of   interpretive   phenomenological   analysis   as   described   by   Smith   and I   hose   to   conduct   a   qualitative   interview   study   based   on   a   phenomenological   one c

to   obtain   detailed   and   experiential   knowledge   of   what   it   can   be   like   to   live   with misophone literature   search,   there   are   very   few   studies   that   have   used   qualitative   research   methods   to study   misophonia   and   no   studies   that   have   explored   misophonia   from   a   pronounced   phenomenological   hermeneutic epistemological   position.   Using   such   a   methodical   approach   gives   the   opportunity   to

## 1.2.3   Research   questions

I   ave   particularly   wondered   about   two   peculiarities   of   misophonia   and   their   possible   consequences h other   people.   In   addition,   I   have   wondered   about   the   experiences   of   people   with   misophonia may   have   had   meetings   with   healthcare   personnel   or   in   treatment.   Based   on   this   developed I  he   following   research   questions: t therefore   wondering   if   little   knowledge   of   the   phenomenon   in   the   population   affects   how   people   with misophonia   understand   themselves,   the   phenomenon   they   experience   and   how   they   navigate   in   interaction   with   it this.   One   is   that   misophonia   is   a   phenomenon   where   the   reaction   itself   most   often   occurs due   to   reason of another   human   being.   The   second   is   that   misophonia   is   an   unknown   phenomenon   for   most   people.   I   have

- 1.   How   do   people   with   misophonia   understand   their   own   problems?
- 2.   How   do   people   with   misophonia   experience   being   greeted   by   other   people   when   it comes   to   his   troubles?
- 3.   What   experiences   do   people   with   misophonia   have   with   healthcare   for   their   problems?

In   May   2021,   I   sent   an   application   to   Regional   Committees   for medical   and   healthcare   research   ethics   (REK).   The   project   was   considered   to   fall   outside   the   scope scope   of   the   Health   Research   Act   and   could   therefore   be   carried   out   without   approval   from   REK autumn   2020   and   the   mentoring   agreement   with   Marit   Råbu   was   concluded   in   December   2020.   During In   the   spring   of   2021,   I   developed   a   research   protocol   with   interview   guide,   data   handling   plan   and the   research   interviews   were   conducted   in   February   and   March   2022. This   study   is   an   independent   research   project.   The   idea   for   the   project   was   conceived   by   me (Attachment   1).   The   project's   plan   for   handling   personal   data   was   approved   by   the   Norwegian   Center   for

I   also   considered   taking "misophonia"   and   "forum"   in   the   Google   search   engine   I   also   found   Norwegian   online   forums   that   discussed members   (Misophonia,   Phonophobia   and   Misokinesia   (Norway),   etc.).   By   using   the   keywords for   forwarding   an   information   letter   about   the   study.   I   considered   recruitment   through on   social   media   on   the   topic   of   misophonia.   By   searching   for   the   term   "misophonia"   in   the   social contact   clinics   that   offer   treatment   for   misophonia   in   Norway   and   investigate   possibilities the   theme.   Based   on   these   investigations,   I   considered   it   likely   that   I   could third   party   and   would   probably   reach   more   potential   participants.

I drew   up   three   criteria   for   participation   which   were   specified   in   the   information   letter   and   in time   in   life   have   considered   seeking   professional   help   because   of   misophonia.

I   wanted   to   explore   the   experiences   of   both   participants it was   also   specified   that   participants   should   have   considered   seeking   health   care.

For   ethical   reasons,   a   third   criterion   for   participation   was   that   the   informant   had   to   be   over   18   years   of   age.

(2015).   I   developed   an   interview   guide   based   on   the   research   questions   (Appendix   5)   and   this   one To   collect   data,   I   used   semi-structured   interviews.

In   the   planning   phase,   I   prepared   a   reflection   note   about   my   own Describing   the   reflexive   aspects   of   the   research   process   is   important   for   the   validity   of   the   results strove   for   a   high   degree   of   reflexivity   and   took   measures   to   be   able   to   make   this   explicit.   I   used could   influence   the   research   process.   I   also   have   a   professional   and   cultural   starting   point, aware   of   how   my   experiences   will   be   with   me   in   the   meeting   with   the   informants   and   in   that in   qualitative   studies   (Hennink   et   al.,   2020;   Merrick,   1999).   Malterud   (1993)   emphasizes   that this   thesis   about   the   background   for   the   research   interest.   In   this   note   I   also   reflected a   research   journal   so   that   I   could   go   back   and   look   at   thoughts   and   reflections   I   have   had pre-understanding   of   the   phenomenon   I   wanted   to   study.   This   note   became   the   starting   point   for   section   i among   other   things   as   a   female   psychology   student   raised   in   Norway.

I   found   that   I   succeeded   to   a   greater   extent to   put   aside   my   assumptions   about   what   it   might   be   like   to   live   with   misophonia.   Under During   the   data   collection   and   analysis   I   tried   to   have   a   wondering   attitude,   and strove   to   be   aware   of   during   the   process,   so   that   this   took   up   as   little   space   as   possible   in   the   interviews, the   condition   was   taken   seriously   in   this   study.

All   material   that   had   been   coded   into   one   research   question NVivo.   This   program   was   used   to   be   able   to   have   flexibility   in   the   further   analysis represented   possible   salient   themes   across   participants. the   first   step   of   the   analysis   where   I   got   to   know   the   data   material.   After   this   I   started was   read   through   again.   During   this   review,   I   coded   all   material   under   each interview.   In   the   next   part   of   the   process   of   getting   to   know   the   material,   I   started   from   each and   interpretive   comments   (Smith   et   al.,   2009)   in   a   separate   note   sheet   attached   to   each I  ead   through   each   interview   and   both   noted   and   coded   using   the   computer   program r tried   to   capture   in   the   meaning   content   of   the   material   related   to   each   research   question   and the   work.   During   the   first   reading   of   the   interviews,   I   coded   all   the   data   material   into   three   codes research   questions   in   new   thematic   codes   that   I   developed   during   the   reading.   These   codes an   active   analytical   work   with   the   aim   of   gaining   more   thorough   knowledge   of   all   material   obtained. As   I   myself   conducted   the   interviews   and   transcribed   them,   this   can   be   considered   as

After   this   process,   I   discussed   the   coded   material   with   the   supervisor.   To   get   a   better   overview the   participants. information   to   extract   meaningful   content   and   salient   themes.   I   also   prepared   one essential   content   of   meaning   in   each   individual's   narrative   and   include   exemplifying on   around   1-2   pages.   This   summary   can   be   described   as   a   condensed   interpretive about   the   content   of   meaning   in   the   data   material,   I   prepared   a   textual   summary   of   each   interview schematic   overview   of   the   participants   to   get   an   overview   of   recurring   themes   across in   its entirety,   and   along   the   way   also   used   previous   knowledge   of   the   material   and   previously   coded quotes.   This   summary   was   written   by   me   re-reading   one   interview   at   a   time summarizing   the   interview   in   chronological   order,   where   I   emphasized   getting   a   hold   of   it

To   be   able   to   reproduce   the   diversity   of The   interpretive   summaries   and   the   schematic   overview   were   shared   with   the   supervisor   and   us regard   to   due   to   misophonia.

In   working   with   the   data   material,   we   also   noticed   that   there   was

All   the   participants   described   that   the   problems   began   in   childhood   or   early   teenage   years.   Most at   first, only   sounds   from   a   specific   person,   such   as   mother,   father,   siblings   or   named   friends,   applied. sounds   like   breathing,   eating   or   chewing   gum.   Most   also   reported   that   this described   his   first   memories   of   the   pain   as   an   experience   of   irritation   or   discomfort   from   hearing on,   with   chewing   gum   for   example. made   such   incredibly   annoying   breathing   sounds,   so...   And   at   least   it   was   from   when   I   was   7 Yes,   I've   actually   thought   about   that   many   times,   when   I   kind   of   feel   like   that years,   maybe   even   earlier.   And   then   I   had   a   friend   who   I   also   reacted   strongly   to I   already   remember   from   school   that   I   couldn't   sit   next   to   Anne   and   Per,   because   of   them started,   but   at   least   it   started   when   I   was   a   child,   so   maybe   about   7   years   old.

Some   described   that   the   reaction   had   also   become   progressively   stronger. Most   of   the   participants   also   reported   that   the   complaints   gradually   worsened   and   that   since   childhood had   stronger   reactions   when   she   was   younger   and   that   she   did   not   know   the   reason   for   this connection   with   sound,   often   in   the   form   of   repetitive   movements.   One   of   the   participants   stated   that   she Most   reported   that   today   they   can   react   if   they   only see a   movement   that   is   connected improved   over   the   years.

I've   stopped   wishing,   but   five   years   ago   I   wished   I   was   deaf.   It   really   was told   about   when   you   had   to   torture   people,   you   skinned   them,   and   then   it   dripped torture   method: "When   I   was   in   primary   school,   I   remember   someone   in   my   class manage   in   life,   music   is   not   everything,   I   can   read   lips,   I   can   manage"". Another Most   of   the   participants   described   that   the   ailments   eventually   led   to   high   suffering   pressure.

Some   had   wondered   a   lot   about   the   ailments   and   searched   for   explanations,   while   others for   a   long   time   had   tried   to   understand   something   that   they   experienced   as   incomprehensible   about   themselves. explanatory   model. to   a   greater   extent   had   accepted   not   understanding,   or   settled   down   with   another knowledge   of   the   concept   of   misophonia.   A   common   feature   of   all   the   participants'   descriptions   is   that   they   over The   participants'   formation   of   opinions   about   this   took   place   in   different   ways   and   led   to   different   results There   was   great   variation   in   the   understandings   the   participants   had   of   their   ailments   before   they   got   them

One   of   the   participants   said   that   she   had   not   thought   much   about   the   cause   of   the   pain   and   described thought   about   whether   the   concept   of   sound   sensitivity   could   cover   the   problems.   Some   had   intermittently that   she   rather   thought   that "something   has   to   be   bothered   with". Most   participants   described   that   they thought   that   what   they   experienced   was   about   problems   with   attention   and   focus. first   understood   the   reaction   as   irritability   linked   to   puberty,   while   in   later   years   some   had had   thought   or   wondered   a   lot   why   they   felt   that   way.   In   their   teens,   some   of   the   participants   had

Most   described   that   the   strong   reaction   they   constantly   experienced   had   been   very   strong not   normal'. Some   described   thinking   there   was   something   wrong   with   them. very   strange   then,   something   that   I   really   can't   figure   out   what   it   is". Others   highlighted   that difficult   to   understand: "No,   I   guess   I've   really   only   felt   that   it   has   been,   that   this   has   been   something they   thought   this   was   not   normal: "I   thought   I   was   going   crazy.

The   level   where   I   hated   smacking,   that   there   was   something   wrong   with   me   for   reacting   like   that a   lot, because   I   know   that   people   don't   like   smacking,   but   there's   a   difference   between   not   liking   it   and smacking   to   the   point   that   it   affects   me   so   much.

Some   gave   examples   of person. "Because   I   have   always   believed   that   I   have   always   been   alone   and   only   one about   having   it   that   way.

Most   of   the   participants   stated   that   they   had   felt   guilty   for   reacting   in   this   way,   or Because   you   don't   understand   that". One   of   the   participants   described   thinking   of   it   as   very   unfair that   she   felt   that   way.   Another   described   that   it   was   difficult   to   imagine   that   it   was   something   that   was be   so   difficult   then.   You   put   a   lot   of   the   blame   on   yourself.   Why   do   I   have   to   react? in   other   ways   blamed   himself   for   the   troubles.

Some   stated   that   it   was   disappointing that   there   is   still no   cure   for   the   condition,   or   felt   any   discomfort   associated   with   having   one used   expressions   such   as "when   I   found   a   name   for   it" or   that "all   the   pieces   fell   into   place". Some Most   described   discovering   the   concept   of   misophonia   as   an   exclusively   positive   experience,   and

I'm   also   a   bit   stressed   because...   "ah...   am   I   going   to   have   a   disorder   like   that?" (...) for   others   to   understand   why   you   have   been   the   way   you   have   been   in   your   youth   and   the   like understand   why   I   have   struggled   as   much   as   I   have.   And   then   I   really   felt   that... First   of   all, I was   very   relieved   because   finally   there   might   be   an   opportunity   to annoy   you   about   it!"   They   have   not   known   that   this   has   been   a   thing   before.   And   then   know things,   especially   mum   and   dad,   because   they   have   often   been   a   bit   like   that   "but   my   God,   stop   it If   ou   travel   there   and   get   a   diagnosis   in   relation   to   it,   then   it   might   be   a   little   easier y

Most   of   the   participants   also   highlighted   that   they   had In   most   of   the   participants'   descriptions,   it   can   be   interpreted   as   finding   a   term   for control". quite   a   bit   about   it,   and   taught   me   more   about   it.

Most   stated   that   this   is   something   they   have   thought   about   a   lot also   disliked   certain   sounds.   Some   also   reported   that   they   had   given   a   lot   of   thought   to   whether   this   was   a   thing had   also   thought   a   lot   about   heredity.   Several   mentioned   signs   in   their   own   surroundings   which   they   interpreted   as   meaning   that biological   causal   explanation   and   had   thoughts   that   it   was "something   with   the   brain".

Others These   described   having   memories   from   childhood   of   parents   commenting   on   sounds   or   being associations   with   sounds.   One   of   the   participants   highlighted   that   this   associative   learning   could   be early   trauma   or   that   people   with   misophonia   were   more   moral   than   others.

For   some   of   the   others was   there   treatment   for   it   and   possibly   where.   She   described   that   she   had   not   been   able   to   bring   it   up that   her   child   was   irritated   by   breathing,   and   this   made   her   think   that   she   had   to   deal   with   it treatment   for   other   mental   health   problems   when   this   happened   and   started   treatment   for like   "yes,   but   if   I   an't   et   help   with   this   here,   then   I   can't   ave   children"   so   it   was c g h had   worsened: "really   that   it   has   gone   so   far   in   relationships   (...)   and   then   I   thought contact   healthcare   professionals   regarding   misophonia.

Several   of   these   participants   were   already   in and   investigate   whether   it   was   possible   to   get   help.   Another   participant   stated   that   she   had   not   been   in like...   it was   more   on   that   level'. One   participant   stated   that   she   sought   help   because   she   experienced

Both   described In   the   beginning   it   was   difficult   to   notice   any   effect   of   the   treatment.   One   of   these   said   that   she   still that   the   treatments   involved   exercises   they   could   do   at   home.

The   other   participant   described   that   she   now during   a   period   in   which   she   took   a   break   from   the   treatment,   she   noticed   that   the   ailments   were   getting   worse. Two   participants   made   direct   contact   with   a   private   clinic   they   had   found   through   an   internet   search the   feelings   around   it   and   treatment   that   can   give   you   a   little   push   then".

Two   participants   had   been   introduced   to   the   concept   of   misophonia   through   their   psychologist   and had   then   been   referred   further   by   the   psychologist   for   treatment   by   an   audio   pedagogue.

Some I was   then   referred   further   by   that   psychologist,   so   we   found   out   that   it   was   misophonia   that   I   had   then. And   then   I   got   to   start   with   audio   therapy   and   start   learning   a   few   different   techniques some   days   are   worse   than   others,   but   it   usually   goes   well. was   not   something   to   waste   one's   life   on   (laughs   a   little)   (...)   But...   luckily,   I   just   stayed And   then   we   were   told   by   the   otorhinolaryngologist   that   we   just   had   to   get   our   act   together...   That

She   had   now   finished   her   treatment   with   an   audiologist, This   participant   also   described   that   she   now "controlled" the   degree   of   discomfort   through   holding

"I   went   to   my   GP   and   I   was   really   ready   for   her   to   say,   'No,  his.' t Four   participants   had   discussed   their   complaints   with   their   GP.   These   had   different experiences   with   this.   One   participant   had   been   pleasantly   surprised   by   the   meeting   with   the   GP.

"yes,   but   I've   heard   of   this   before   (...),   I   think   I   actually   know   of   someone   who   can   help   you,   I   saw is   not   something"(laughs).   So   I   was   ready   to   take   the   world's   biggest   fight   there.   But   then   she   just   said sends   you   on   there". She   began   treatment   with   an   audiologist   and   describes   that   this   has

words   about   what   she   experiences,   in   addition   to   techniques   for   exposure   such   as   listening   training   and muscle   relaxation.   Another   participant   had   sought   treatment   both   through   the   GP, been   useful.   She   points   out   that   she   has   gained   an   increased   understanding   of   misophonia   and   terms   to   put   it the   occupational   health   service   and   a   private   actor,   where   she   had   tried   medication   respectively

of   these   participants   stated   that   she   had   been   referred   by   her   GP   to   an   audiologist   and   was   now   waiting treatment   in   the   form   of   SSRIs,   exposure   therapy   and   acupuncture.   She   described   experiencing thought   the   GP   was   familiar   with   misophonia: "On   my   prescription   it   has   always   read   'against improvement   from   acupuncture   and   drug   treatment,   but   described   having   bad   experiences process: "I   feel   it  s   ery   long-winded.

After   all,   she   has   said   herself   that   she   doesn't   know   what   misophonia   is.   So   there   is   nothing   she   can   do   to   help you   with.   So   there's   a   bit   of   it  here   as   well."

The   fourth   participant   described   the   process   of seek   help   for   misophonia   as

"a   bit   of a...   goose   chase".

She   had   brought   it   up   with her   GP,   but   described   that   the   GP   did   not   understand   what   she   was   talking   about.   She   still   had

received   a   further   referral   and   recommendations   on   where   she   could   contact:

Everyone I will   now   elaborate   on   how   this   understanding   can   affect   relationships   with   other   people,   and a   misophonic   reaction   most   often   occurs   in   the   vicinity   of   other   people,   all   the   participants   had how   suffering   from   misophonia   involves   negotiations   with   oneself   or   others.

## 3.2.1   Making   others   understand   that   there   is actually something

All   the   participants   described   that   getting   a   term   for   the   problems   had   made   it   easier   to   be   open talked   to   someone   about   it,   and   for   some   it   had   been   very   important   to   keep   it   a   secret. the   troubles   with   other   people   before   they   got   the   term   misophonia.   Some   explained   that   they   never   had about   what   they   experienced.   All   the   participants   also   described   that   they   had   talked   about   very   little had   one   or   more   close   relations   who   were   to   some   extent   aware   of   what   they   were   doing "...because   I   have   been   so   deeply   afraid   of   being   exposed.   (...)   I   never   dared   to   say   anything   to   anyone   before. "found   it   annoying". to   some   friends,   even   those   closest   to   me,   before   I   knew   what   it   was."

A   common   feature   of   all   the   participants'   experiences   was   a   movement   from   a   large   extent was   their "fault". someone   who   doesn't   quite   understand   what   it   is,   and   then   I   find   an   article   like   that   and   then   they   can   read   it the   concept   of   misophonia.   The   participants   described   various   reasons   for   this   movement.   Some   highlighted   that secrecy   to   a   greater   degree   of   openness   towards   others   about   the   ailments   after   they   could   use that   the   term   contributed   to   their   problems   being   communicated   as "something   real" and   something   not self.   So   they   might   understand   it   a   little   better   than   how   I   explain   it   then." Someone   highlighted getting   a   term   for   the   experience   made   it   easier   to   communicate   with   others: "That's right

That   "yes,   there   is   something   wrong   with   me,   but   it's   not   my   fault!" (laughs).   Because   it   kind   of   was Because   then   it   was   like   something   you   could   refer   to   in   a   way,   that   it   is   something   that   is   real.

(to   read) it's   asy   to   talk   about,   because   people   are   really   like   "huh?   Are   you   kidding?   Are   you   like   meat?" e that   made   that   turning   point,   that   made   it   a   little   easier.   Although   I   don't  hink   so t people   today.   One   participant   had   only   told   about   the   condition   of   his   mother   and   brother   and   expressed   that it was   something   she   found   difficult   to   talk   about. There   was   still   a   wide   range   in   the   extent   to   which   the   participants   talked   about   misophonia   to   others

h And   that's   probably   the   experience   I've   gained   from   not   being   taken   seriously   in   this her   a   little  inks   about   what   misophonia   is,   and   a   little   different,   but   then...   So   I   am l I   uess   I've   never   really   felt   that   there   has   been   any   will   to   understand   that   this   is   one g she   doesn't   show   much   understanding   and   has   actually   laughed   it   off   a   bit,   and...   Yes.   At   all...   have   said   that "jaja".   So   it   has   been   a   bit   painful.   To   not   get   that   understanding   then.   (...) then   that   has   in   a   way   made   me   refuse   to   talk   to   others   about   it.   Yes, very   happy   for   my   mother,   that's   not   what   it's   about.   But   exactly   in   that   area   there real   problem   with   people   then.   That   I   have   tried   to   talk   to   my   mother   a   bit   about   it,   and   send

I   ave   spoken   to   my   brother,   by   the   way.   I   did   that   about   a   year   ago,   maybe, and   he...   He   actually   understood.   Yes.   So   it   was   kind   of   good.

completely   new   place,   then   I   was   rather   completely   open   about   it   from   the   time   people   met   me,   because   then   it   is   much   easier would   love   to   have   a   t-shirt   that   says   "I   have   misophonia"   just   so   people   know   what   it   is around   her.   She   described   the   transition   from   secondary   school: "everyone   knew   me,   but   nobody   knew ." is". This   can   be   understood   as   being   about   both   being   better   understood   yourself   and   also   that   others   could   benefit from   the   knowledge: "To   be   a   bit   like  hat...   an   ambassador   for   that.   Because   others   actually t Some   participants   wanted   to   be   as   open   as   possible   about   misophonia   in   order   to   spread   knowledge: "so   I the.   So   starting   to   tell   something   new   became   a   bit   difficult.   I   rather   took   it   when   I   started   one the   participant   had   made   a   conscious   choice   when   she   started   high   school   to   tell   everyone must   understand,   because   there   are   probably   many   more   who   suffer   from   it   than   we   know   about". The   youngest to   understand   it,   when   it   comes   in   early".

that   this   could   be   about   an   expectation   of   having   to   explain   a   great   deal   so   that   others   would Most   of   the   participants   described   that   it   was   not   a   goal   to   keep   it   a   secret,   but understand.   One   participant   also   linked   this   to   shame: "But   it   is   lear   that   it  s...  n   a c i i way described   various   reasons   why   they   often   chose   not   to   talk   about   it.   Some   of   these   described shameful   because   people   don't   know   about   it.   In   other   words,   like   "yes,   I'm   a   lesbian",   everyone   knows   what   that   is,   it's   possible

a   lot! You   kind   of   just   really   have   to...   And   that   makes   you   reluctant,   so   to   speak be   a   bit   hameful,   but   at   least   people   know   what   it   is.   But   here   you   have   to   explain   so   incredibly s some". Others   described   an   expectation   that   others   would   not   really   understand   the   seriousness   of   it.

it's   othing   like   that...   really   aim   to   keep   it   a   secret.   But   maybe   it's      little n a just...   Yeah,   it   feels   a   bit   like  hat.   The   thoughts   I   probably   have   myself   then   (laughs).   I   transfer   them t that   people   don't   understand   the   extent   of   it.   How   big   a   problem   is   it   really...   that   it's   omehow   a   bit   easy   to...   as s I've   thought   myself,   isn't   it   just   to   pull   yourself   together   then?   Oh So   it's   ot   like   I n wouldn't   have   bothered   to   tell   you,   really.   So a   little on   what   others   will   think.

Some Another   participant   described   that   she   mostly   kept   it   to   herself   because   she   knew   several   people situations   where   others   showed   in   various   ways   that   they   had   misunderstood   what   misophonia   was   about, people   don't   really...   get   the   seriousness   of   it." Some   participants   also   described   examples   of that   they   had   misophonia   to   others.   Some   of   the   participants   nevertheless   described   that   even   if   they   could   stay that's   all   the   same.   Here   it   was   highlighted   that   an   experience   that   others   did   not   really   understand of   the   participants   described   that   they   were   most   often   met   with   understanding   or   curiosity   when   they   told   stories on   occasions   had   experienced   that   others   became   self-conscious   when   she   talked   about   misophonia.

Because   of   course   I   have   one finished   eating   I   talked   a   bit   about   it,   or   at   least   some   of   us   did must   toughen   up   for   me,   because   people   have   to   have   food. that,   and   then   (gasp,   acting   out   a   friend's   reaction)   "oh   my   god!   how   did   I   eat   then, problem,   then   it's   me   who   has   to,   that   is...

"You   don't   spoil   your   food   for   others,"   he   says. All   participants   expressed   that   it   was difference   between   having   to   talk   about   misophonia   in   general   and   talking   about   it   in   a   trigger   situation. She   described   that   she   also   had   a   friend   who   believed   that   she   was   intolerant   and   that   it   was   about

All   the   participants   described   that   this   took   place   in   different   ways   based   on organized   in   three   sections   with   the   main   focus   on   close   relationships,   acquaintances   and   strangers. what   type   of   relationship   they   had   with   the   person   involved.   The   further   description   is   therefore the   trigger   sound.   In   what   follows,   I   will   show   similarities   and   differences   in   how   the   participants   relate

## 3.2.2.1   Trigger   situations   in   close   relationships

All   the   participants   described   that   today   they   most   often   reacted   to   sounds   created   by   close   relationships   and   that examples   of   how   misophonia   had   led   to   arguments,   frustration   or   a   bad   mood   in the   reaction   had   also   started   with   family   members   growing   up.   Most   people   came   along growing   up   for   the   strong   reactions   she   had   had   to   sounds   from   her   mother.   Most   people   came   along family   throughout   his   upbringing.   One   participant   described   that   this   had   affected   the   relationship   with   mother   i one   could   get   irritated   about,   or   to   pull   together   or   toughen   up. examples   of   having   received   comments   from   parents   throughout   their   upbringing   that   this   was   nothing to   a   very   large   extent   and   described   having   struggled   with   a   bad   conscience   and   guilt   throughout

So   I   wasn't   allowed   to   leave   the   table.   Mum's   just   like   "no,   stop   bullshitting.   He   just pressed   a   little   physical   pain   then,   because   there   was...   something   else   to   focus   on   then. smatter,   it's   fine,   don't   think   about   it.   No,   stop   and   don't   o   on   like   that,   don't   e   like   that g b very   forced   to   sit,   and   actually   sat   and   kind   of   scratched   my   arms,   sort   of difficult   then".   That's   what   I   actually   heard   throughout   my   childhood.   So   I   remember   being the   home.   Some   described   starting   to   avoid   certain   situations,   or   that   they   often   went   to   the   bathroom   to by   having   the   arm   above   the   head.   Some   stated   that   they   started   using   earplugs. All   the   participants   described   that   during   their   upbringing   they   developed   forms   of   avoidance   strategies   i take   a   break.   One   participant   recalled   that   as   a   child   she   had   tried   to   discreetly   cover   her   ears

One   participant   said   that   the   parents   are   involved   in   exercises   she that   they   gained   knowledge   about   misophonia.   Most   of   the   participants   described   that   they   now   speak   openly Despite   the   fact   that   misophonia   had   been   a   source   of   much   frustration   in   the   family   described

put   on   white   noise   really   loud   when   we   sit   and   eat   dinner   then.   Because   I   can   be   terrified...   I   think   it's torture   to   sit   and   eat   dinner   with   the   family,   for   example.   To   have with   that...   and   a   bit...   Yes,   the   exercises   you   have   to   do   and   the   strategies   there.   That   maybe   it   is response   without   my   control   in   a   way   then.   In   the   subconscious.   And   the   way   you   work a   bit hard   to   understand.   But   they   are   in   on   it.   Now   I   have   been   given   the   task   of   going For   mum   and   dad,   it   is   perhaps   a   little   more   difficult   to   understand   that...   there   is   only   one the. on   that   sound   all   the   time   along   the   way...   it   goes   beyond   them   too,   but   they   are   involved

They   only   do   this   when   they "have   a   good   day". She   said   that   the   whole   family   was   very   upset about   misophonia.   The   youngest   participant   in   the   sample   said   that   she   also   has   a   sister   with   misophonia, big   difference   in   which   sounds   they   reacted   to   the   most   and   that   they   paid   attention   to   each   other   in   different   ways was   something   proper". She   also   described   that   although   both   she   and   her   sister   had   misophonia,   it   was to   limit   specific   types   of   noise   in   the   home   and   that   they   have   largely   stopped   eating   meals happy   when   they   got   knowledge   about   misophonia. 'They   found   that   it   was   something   we   could   learn   to   deal   with and   that   those   in   her   family   therefore   take   a   number   of   considerations.   She   described   that   her   family   is   trying In   one   family,   they   had   also   made   major   changes   to   routines   in   the   home   after   they   gained   knowledge this. 'So...   it's...   ither   we   eat   together   or   we   don't. e Yes.   And   then   it's   on irritation,   and   that   it   gets   worse   the   more   she   is   with   them.   She   described   that   despite   having In   contrast   to   this   participant,   another   participant   described   that   all   meals   at   home   then tried   to   tell her   parents   about   misophonia,   she   did   not   feel   that   there   was   a   will   to   try   to   understand the   parents,   but   she   described   that   meals   together   with   the   parents   are   still   characterized   by she   was   younger   was   characterized   by   irritation.

One   participant   described   that   when   she   was stated   that   misophonia   affected   the   relationship   with   a   husband   or   lover   to   a   much   greater   extent   than   others partner. "My   brother   was   probably   the   first   to   undergo   the   procedure,   then   it   was   dad,   now   it's   him Some   of   the   participants   described   that   they   still   react   most   strongly   to   sounds   from   parents   or relationships.   All   the   participants   who   were   in   a   relationship   stated   that   under   certain   circumstances described   misophonia   as   a   strain   or   a   challenge   in   a   relationship.   Some   of   the   participants my   roommate   too,   right?   And   that   is   a   challenge!   (laughs   a   little)".

'He   gets   a   little   irritated,   man this,   he   takes   an   incredible   amount   of   consideration,   but   he   gets   scolded   every   day.

## 4   DISCUSSION

In   what   follows,   I   will   discuss   how   my   findings   can   be   understood,   and   which   ones implications   they   may   have   for   the   understanding   of   misophonia.   Furthermore,   I   will   discuss   methodological   choices, had   experienced   a   change   in   understanding   of   their   own   ailments   when   they   discovered   the   concept   of   misophonia.   The there   was   great   variation   in   the   participants'   experiences   with   health   care.   There   was   also   variation   in   how The   purpose   of   the   study   was   to   explore   what   it   is   like   to   live   with   misophonia.   All   participants as   well   as   possibilities   and   limitations   for   how   the   findings   can   be   used.   Finally,   I   would   like   to   discuss the   findings'   implications   for   clinical   work   and   summarize   implications   for   further   research.

## 4.1   Living   with   misophonia

the   participants   have   been   through   a   process   in   which   they   have   tried   to   understand   their   ailments.   Everyone Misophonia   affects   how   participants   experience   both   themselves   and   other   people.   Everyone

descriptions   of   how   they   experienced   the   problems   before   they   were   given   a   term   were,   for   most,   characterized   by relationships   or   inhibit   life   development   (Swedo   et   al.,   2022).   The   ailments   can   also   be   a   bigger   one had   heard   of   misophonia,   to   the   point   that   afterwards   they   understood   the   ailments   to   a   greater   extent   as   "something   that   has himself   and   to   a   greater   extent   opened   up   about   the   troubles   of   those   around   him.   This   can   also   be   thought   to   have   had misophonia.   In   line   with   other   research,   it   emerged   that   misophonia   can   be   a   burden   in wrong,   difficult   or   crazy.   Despite   the   fact   that   getting   a   term   for   the   ailments   in   itself   did   not   reduce negative   thoughts   about   oneself.   The   participants   used   words   such   as   shame,   guilt,   alone,   lonely,   abnormal, a   movement   can   be   seen   from   the   fact   that   they   largely   placed   the   blame   for   the   troubles   on   themselves   before   they emotional   strain   when   they   are   also   perceived   as   strangers   or   incomprehensible.   of   the   participants hit   me". connection   with   a   change   in   the   participants'   attribution   of   blame   for   the   ailments.   In   the   descriptions negotiates   with   themselves   and   others   about   how   they   should   relate   to   others   when   they   are   bothered   by symptoms,   most   of   the   participants   experienced   a   reduction   in   negative   thoughts   about   themselves

Another backgrounds,   life   situations   and   comorbid   disorders.   This   lends   support   to   the   assumption   that findings   in   line   with   this   definition   is   that   the   participants   stated   that   they   were   troubled   by   misophonia   in   different their   patterns   of   triggers.

This misophonia   can   best   be   understood   as   a   limited   disorder   (Swedo   et   al.,   2022).   Most   of   the   participants This   is   an   interesting   finding   in   light   of   the   hypothesis   that   misophonia   is   related   to across   participants   when   it   comes   to   how   they   describe   the   misophonic   reaction   and that   it was   to   a   greater   extent   limited   to   some   situations.   The   participants   also   had   different degree.   Some   participants   stated   that   this   characterized   most   arenas   in   life   and   other   participants   described indicates   that   the   connection   between   misophonia   and   movement   should   be   explored   further.

My   findings   are   in   line   with   other   research   findings   such   as others   thought   that   this   could   have   contributed   to   the   fact   that   they   had   become   extra   goods   for   sounds   through The   participants   had   different   beliefs   about   the   reason   why   they   had   developed   misophonia.

There   were   also   participants   who   stated   that   family   members indicates   a   somewhat   increased   incidence   of   misophonia   within   families   (Cavanna,   2014;   Rouw   &amp; degree   responded   to   specific   sounds.

There   were   differences   between   the   participants   when   it   came   to   experiences   with   healthcare.

It   is   conceivable   that   there   is   an   underlying   reason   why   trigger   sounds   are   most often   created   by   other   people   and   are   strongest   in   close   relationships.

An   interesting   finding   was   that it was   easier   for   most   participants   to   talk   about   having   misophonia   in   general   or   to the   participants   to   a   greater   extent   had   second   thoughts   about   the   guilt   of   the   other   person   before   they   had both   person   and   situation   before   they   would   possibly   talk   about   misophonia   or   comment   on   one this   study   is   to   what   extent   the   ability   to   distinguish   between   these   two   things   was   related degree   strategies   such   as   trying   to   anticipate   and   avoid   trigger   situations   or   to   persevere   in   the   situation. which   is   used   to   handle   such   a   situation   (Potgieter   et   al.,   2019),   the   participants   used   in   the   largest the   person's   right   to   be   himself.

It   appeared   that   this   participant   was   more   open   about youngest   participant   who   was   around   14   years   old   when   she   became   aware   of   misophonia.   She   had   then may   therefore   be   whether   early   familiarity   with   the   term   can   affect   how   it   is   to   live   with problems   that   none   of   the   other   participants   stated,   such   as   food,   exercise   and   nicotine.

There   are   big   differences   between more   or   less   emphasis   on   in   different   cultures   (Kittler   et   al.,   2016;   Montanari,   2006). Prevalence   studies   have   indicated   that   misophonia   is   widespread   in   countries   such   as   Turkey,   Great   Britain,   the   United   States   and

China   (Kÿlÿç   et   al.,   2021;   Vitoratou   et   al.,   2022;   Wu   et   al.,   2014;   Zhou   et   al.,   2017).   This   suggests comes   to   connections   between   culture   and   misophonia   and   what   it   is   like   to   live   with   misophonia that   the   phenomenon   exists   across   cultures.   There   are   still   many   unanswered   questions   when   it   comes   to   that in   different   cultures.

This   methodological   choice   made   it   possible   to descriptions   close   to   experience   of   what   it   can   be   like   to   live   with   the   condition.   I   have   explored For   the   purposes   of   this   study,   I   chose   to   conduct   a   qualitative   interview   study   based   on   a

No   tools   such   as   questionnaires   or   similar   were   used   to   survey The   sample   consisted   of   9   self-selected   informants   contacted   through   a   group   in   social deviate   from   the   consensus   definition   of   misophonia,   and   there   are   also   striking   similarities   between   them   all added   questions   in   the   interview   guide   that   explored   the   participant's   experience   of   triggers   and the   participants'   symptoms   before   inclusion   in   the   study.   There   was   thus   an   opportunity   for   that   included indications   that   the   symptoms   that   the   participants   in   this   sample   report   as   misophonia   may the   reaction.

Set   aside   from   these   common   features As   misophonia   is   a   little-explored   phenomenon,   it   is   natural   to   ask   the   question otherwise   there   was   great   variation   in   the   participants'   background.   This   applied,   among   other   things,   to   age, to   meet   the   criteria   for   recruitment,   the   participants   were   also   members   of   a   group   about about   the   extent   to   which   these   results   are   transferable   to   other   people   with   misophonia.   In   addition

An   over-representation   of   women   with   misophonia   is   in   line   with   some   of   them women   than   men   who   have   misophonia,   or   whether   there   are   more   women   than   men   with   misophonia participants   for   this   study   were   women.   It   can   therefore   be   questioned   whether   there   are   more while   another   study   suggests   that   more   women   than   men   have   misophonia   in   Turkey   (Kÿlÿç   et   al., 2017),   but   at   this   point   it   is not   possible   to   know   whether   this   is   due the   prevalence   studies   that   exist   today   with   a   representative   sample   suggest   a   study   that the   initial   prevalence   studies   that   have   been   done   on   misophonia   (Wu   et   al.,   2014;   Zhou   et   al.,

As   described   earlier,   I   assessed   the   number   of   included   participants   along   the   way interviews   would   have   added   new   information.   Hennink   and   colleagues   (2020)   refer   to   research the   interview   process,   with   the   aim   of   obtaining   a   sufficiently   saturated   data   material.   By analysis,   it   may   be   an   appropriate   number   to   start   with   three   participants   (Smith   et   al.,   2009). which   shows   that   qualitative   interview   studies   where   the   data   material   could   be   described   as   saturated   at   9 Smith   and   colleagues   recommend   that   students   who   want   to   undertake   an   interpretive   phenomenological as   there   proved   to   be   great   variation   in   the   participants'   experiences   and   it   is   conceivable   that   more completion   of   the   analysis,   it   may   be   questioned   whether   the   data   material   was   approximately   saturated in-depth   analysis.

It   is   conceivable other   strategies   to   deal   with   this,   which   do   not   involve   seeking   health   care.   This   study that   there   are   other   people   with   misophonia   who   suffer   to   the   same   extent,   but   who   make   use   of   it The   participants   were   recruited   based   on   a   criterion   of   having   considered   seeking   health   care.

The   fact   that   misophonia   does   not   only   affect misophonia,   but   most   of   the   participants'   negative   experiences   in   meeting   with   healthcare   personnel   were   related   to   little or   no   knowledge   of   misophonia.

Schröder   and   colleagues   (2013)   highlight   that   an   important   difference   between   these   two (Böhnlein   et   al.,   2020).   As   misophonia   has   many   similarities   with   specific   phobias,   it   is it  s   believed   that   this   treatment   was   based   on   principles   of   exposure   therapy   for   phobic   anxiety i exposure   exercises   for   misophonia.   One   who   had   bad   experiences   with   this   described   that

mindfulness-based   therapy,   acceptance   and   commitment   therapy   and   dialectical   behavior   therapy.   These can   be   treated   according   to   the   same   principles   as   specific   phobias.   Potgieter   and   colleagues   describe   in consideration   should   be   given   to   choosing   other   approaches   as   described   above. with   the   use   of   drugs   such   as   SSRIs   or   benzodiazepines,   none   reported   moderate psychoeducation,   use   of   behavioral   components   such   as   relaxation   techniques,   or   exercising.   Others that   the   underlying   cause   of   aggression   in   misophonia   is   fear   or   anxiety   (Potgieter   et   al., exposure   therapy   without   specific   adaptations   for   misophonia.   This   suggests   that   the   latter reported   reduction   in   symptoms   for   some   patients   have   used   approaches   such   as   cognitive symptom   reduction.   Overall,   the   results   from   the   case   studies   are   reflected   in   this   study's misophonia   is   the   central   emotion   aggression.   As   mentioned   at   the   outset,   there   are   findings   that   indicate focus   attention   and   on   connections   between   thoughts,   feelings   and   behaviour.   Case   studies without   further   descriptions   of   the   therapy's   content   reported   limited   effect   of   this   due   to approach   for   treating   misophonia   at   this   time   should   be   used   with   caution,   and his   systematic   review   article   from   2019   that   two   case   studies   that   used   exposure   therapy the   methods   had   many   similarities   with   the   approaches   taken   from   cognitive   behavioral   therapy   with thought   patterns,   shifting   attention   in   a   trigger   situation,   challenging   avoidance   strategies, in   treatment   have   experienced   an   effect,   and   bad   experiences   with   were   reported 2019).   Despite   similarities   between   the   conditions,   there   is   little   evidence   today   that   misophonia   is   best approaches   with   reported   effect   were   methods   taken   from   therapy   directions   such   as results.   The   participants   state   that   various   approaches   have   been   effective,   but   not   all   of   them   have   been the   conditions   are   that   in   specific   phobias   the   central   feeling   in   the   reaction   is   fear,   while   in behavioral   therapy   with   various   adaptations   to   misophonia,   including   a   focus   on   maladaptives of   patients'   lack   of   compliance   and   faith   in   the   treatment.   Other   case   studies   that   have based   on   the   knowledge   available   today.   I   will   support   this   recommendation, openness   in   meetings   with   patients   about   the   lack   of   evidence   base   for   both   understanding   and As   described   in   the   introduction,   Brout   and   colleagues   (2018),   among   others,   encourage treatment   of   misophonia,   but   at   the   same   time   trying   to   help   patients   to   deal   with   the   problems

but   also   add   a   call   for   healthcare   personnel   to   be   aware   of treat   misophonia,   several   participants   in   this   study   and   in   other   studies   report   having   benefited established   that   hope   can   be   central   to   recovery   in   the   treatment   of   psychological   ailments   (Frank, 1961;   Irving   et   al.,   2004).   Despite   the   fact   that   today   it   is   unclear   how   best   to   understand   or of   treatment,   including   psychological   treatment   approaches.   The   ever-increasing   amount preserve   or   convey   hope   to   patients   with   misophonia   who   seek   help.   It   has   been   for   a   long   time

research   into   misophonia   will   also   be   able   to   contribute   to   a   better   treatment   offer   in   the   future.   This gives   hope   that   there   are   ways   to   recovery   for   those   who   suffer   from   misophonia.

## 4.4   Implications   for   further   research

further   on.   Overall,   my   findings   indicate   that   there   is   a   great   need   for   more   research   on misophonia   in   general.   The   findings   also   lend   support   to   the   assumption   that   misophonia   can   be   a   major reach   agreement   on   diagnostic   criteria   and   continue   work   towards   developing   diagnostic   ones tools   for   misophonia.   There   is   a   general   need   for   more   knowledge   about   misophonia,   and   that   this In   the   preceding   paragraphs,   I   have   pointed   out   several   aspects   of   misophonia   that   should   be   researched the   knowledge   reaches   healthcare   personnel   and   the   population. the   group.   There   is   therefore   a   need   for   further   research   into   different   treatment   approaches   and   for clinical   treatment   studies.   In   order   to   increase   the   validity   of   these   studies,   efforts   should   also   be   made   to burden   for   a   proportion   of   the   population.   The   findings   also   indicate   that   among   people   with misophonia   is   a   proportion   that   wants   help,   and   that   there   is   currently   a   lack   of   help   for   this

## 5   CONCLUSION

Misophonia   affects   how   people   perceive   themselves   and   others.   It   can   mean   big can   also   make   it   easier   to   communicate   with   other   people   and   to   seek   health   care. life   limitation.   Many   people   with   misophonia   keep   their   problems   to   themselves.   The   findings   indicate   that   the getting   a   concept   for   the   ailments   can   contribute   to   a   positive   change   in   understanding   oneself   and   others.   The

The   knowledge   of   misophonia   in   the   population   and   among   healthcare   personnel   can   contribute   to   an   increased   quality   of   life for   people   with   misophonia. The   findings   also   show   that   there   is   variable   knowledge   about   the   condition   among   healthcare   personnel.   To   increase

Project   application: A   qualitative   study   of   experiences   with   misophonia Application   number: 266604

Institution   responsible   for research: University   of   Oslo

## Project   applications   are   considered   to   be outside   the   scope   of   the   Health   Research   Act.

## Applicant's   description

Misophonia   is   a   little-explored   condition   that   has   received   increasing   scientific   attention   in   recent   decades. Misophonia   is   characterized   by   the   fact   that   everyday   sounds   can   trigger   a   strong   negative   emotional   and physiological   response.   The   trigger   sounds   can   be   smacking,   eating,   chewing,   heavy   breathing   or   other repetitive   sounds   that   usually   come   from   other   people.

The   term   has   apparently   reached   many   people   through   the   internet   and   in   recent   years   the   Norwegian media   have   made   several   reports   about   people   who   experience   misophonia   as   a   major   burden   in   their everyday   lives.   The   purpose   of   this   project   is   to   obtain   more   knowledge   about   how   it   feels   to   live   with misophonia.   Interviews   will   be   conducted   with   people   who   state   that   they   suffer   from   misophonia   and   the   data will   be   analyzed   using   thematic   analysis.

The   study   will   examine   people's   experiences   with   healthcare   for   these   ailments   and   in   meetings   with   healthcare personnel   and   other   people.   The   study   will   also   examine   your   own   understanding   of   the   condition.   As   of   today, there   are   few   qualitative   studies   of   misophonia   and   none   that   examines   these   topics.   The   study   can   contribute to   increasing   understanding   of   what   it   is   like   to   live   with   misophonia   and   will   be   a   unique   contribution   to   the knowledge   base   about   the   phenomenon.

We   refer   to   the   application   for   prior   approval   of   the   above-mentioned   research   project.   The   application   was processed   by   the   Regional   committee   for   medical   and   health-related   research   ethics   (REK   south-east   C)   in the   meeting   on   03.06.2021.   The   assessment   has   been   made   on   the   basis   of   section   10   of   the   Health   Research Act   (etc.).

## REK's   assessment

The   project   applied   for   will   investigate   how   people   with   misophonia,   i.e.   people   who   experience   strong discomfort   when   exposed   to   certain   sounds,   experience   their   own   condition   and   experience   being   met   by others,   including   by   healthcare   personnel.   The   committee   believes   that   the   project   will   be   able   to   generate knowledge   about   such   experiences   by   living   with   the   condition,   but   that   this   will   not   be   new   knowledge   about illness   and   health   as   understood   in   the   Health   Research   Act.   The   committee

Visiting   address: Gullhaugveien   1-3,   0484   Oslo

believes   that   the   themes   emphasized   in   the   interview   guide   underpin   this   understanding   of   the   project's main   purpose.

The   project   therefore   falls   outside   the   scope   of   the   Health   Research   Act,   cf.   §2   and §4   of   the   Health   Research   Act,   and   can   thus   be   carried   out   without   prior   approval   from   REK.

## Resolution

The   project   falls   outside   the   scope   of   the   Health   Research   Act,   cf.   §   2   and   §   4   letter   a).   Approval   from   REK is   not   required   to   implement   the   project.

The   committee's   decision   was   unanimous.

## Access   to appeal

You   can   appeal   against   REK's   decision,   cf.   Norwegian   Public   Administration   Act   section   28   et   seq. The   appeal   is   sent   on   a   separate   form   via   the   REK   portal.   The   appeal   deadline   is   three   weeks   from   when you   receive   this   letter.   If   REK   upholds   the   decision,   REK   forwards   the   complaint   to   the   National   Research Ethics   Committee   for   Medicine   and   Health   Sciences   (NEM)   for   final   assessment,   cf.   Research   Ethics   Act   §   10 and   Health   Research   Act   §   10.

It   is our   assessment   that   the   processing   will   be   in   accordance   with   privacy   legislation,   as   long   as   it   is   carried out   in   line   with   what   is   documented   in   the   notification   form   15.10.2021   with   attachments,   as   well   as   in   the message   dialogue   between   the   notifier   and   NSD.   The   treatment   can   start.

## TYPE   OF   DATA   AND   DURATION   The   project

will   process   general   personal   data,   special   categories   of   personal   data   on   health   information   until   20/12/2022.

## LEGAL   BASIS   The   project

will   obtain   consent   from   those   registered   to   the   processing   of   personal   data.   Our   assessment   is   that   the   project   requires a   consent   in   accordance   with   the   requirements   in   art.   4   nos.   11   and   7,   in   that   it   is   a   voluntary,   specific,   informed   and unequivocal   confirmation,   which   can   be   documented,   and   which   the   data   subject   can   withdraw.

For   general   personal   data,   the   legal   basis   for   the   processing   will   be   the   data   subject's   consent,   cf.   the   Personal   Protection Ordinance   art.   6   no.   1   a.

For   special   categories   of   personal   data,   the   legal   basis   for   processing   will   be   that   of   the   data   subject

express   consent,   cf.   the   Personal   Data   Protection   Ordinance   art.   9   no.   2   letter   a,   cf.   Personal   Data   Act   §   10,   cf.   §   9   (2).

## PRIVACY   PRINCIPLES

NSD   considers   that   the   planned   processing   of   personal   data   will   follow   the   principles   in   the   Personal   Data Protection   Regulation:

GLYPH&lt;127&gt; on   legality,   fairness   and   transparency   (art.   5.1   a),   in   that   the   data   subjects   receive   satisfactory   information   about   and   consent to   the   processing   GLYPH&lt;127&gt;   urpose   limitation   (art.   5.1   b),   in   that   personal   data   is   collected   for   specific,   expressly   stated   and   justified p purposes,   and   not   further   processed   for   new   incompatible   purposes   GLYPH&lt;127&gt;   ata   minimization   (art.   5.1   c),   in   that   only   information   that   is d adequate,   relevant   and   necessary   for   the   purpose   of   the   project   is   processed   GLYPH&lt;127&gt;  torage   limitation   (art.   5.1   e),   in   that   the   personal s data   is   not   stored   longer   than   necessary   for   to   fulfill   the   purpose.

## THE   RIGHTS   OF   THE   REGISTERED

NSD   assesses   that   the   information   about   the   processing   that   the   registered   will   receive   meets   the   law's   requirements   for   form and   content,   cf.   art.   12.1   and   art.   13.

As   long   as   the   data   subjects   can   be   identified   in   the   data   material,   they   will   have   the   following   rights:   access   (art.   15),   correction (art.   16),   deletion   (art.   17),   restriction   (art.   18)   and   data   portability   (art.   20).

We   remind   you   that   if   a   data   subject   contacts   you   about   his   rights,   the   institution   responsible   for   data   processing   has   an   obligation to   respond   within   one   month.

## DO   YOU   WANT   TO   PARTICIPATE   IN   A   RESEARCH PROJECT   ON   MISOPHONIA?

Are   you   troubled   by   misophonia?   Have   you   sought   help   or   considered   seeking   help   because   of   this? This   is   a   request   for   you   to   do   an   interview   in   connection   with   a   research   project   on   misophonia.   In   this document,   we   provide   you   with   information   about   the   project   and   what   participation   will   mean   for   you.

## The   purpose   of   the   project   and   current   participants My

name   is   Jenny   Langlo   and   I   am   a   student   on   the   professional   course   in   psychology   at   the   University   of Oslo.   As   my   final   main   thesis,   I   will   carry   out   a   qualitative   study   of   experiences   with   misophonia.   In   this study,   I   will   interview   people   who   suffer   from   misophonia   about   their   experiences   and   experiences   with the   condition.   The   purpose   of   the   study   is   to   obtain   more   knowledge   about   what   it   is   like   to   live   with misophonia   and   how   this   affects   those   who   suffer   from   it.   The   study   will   particularly   investigate   how   the participants   are   met   by   other   people   when   it   comes   to   these   ailments.   The   topic   of   the   interview   will therefore   be   experiences   and   experiences   with   misophonia   in   meeting   with   other   people   -   such   as   in everyday   situations   or   in   meeting   with   health   personnel.   I   therefore   want   to   get   in   touch   with   people   who have   misophonia   and   who   at   some   point   in   their   lives   have   considered   seeking   professional   help   because of   this.   Current   participants   may   have   both   sought   help   for   misophonia,   or   only   considered   doing   so.   The study   is   an   independent   research   project   and   will   result   in   my   written   main   thesis   at   the   Department   of Psychology   which   will   be   delivered   in   autumn   2022.

## What   does   participating   mean   for   you?

Participation   in   the   study   will   involve   appearing   for   an   interview   with   me,   which   will   last   around   one hour.   If   you   wish   to   participate,   you   can   contact   us   via   the   website   nettskjema.no/a/230347   or   tel. 91142245.   We   agree   together   on   the   time   and   place   for   the   interview,   the   interview   can   also   be   conducted digitally.   During   the   interview,   I   will   make   an   audio   recording.   The   audio   recording   is   deleted   as   soon   as   I have   made   a   written   version.   Both   the   audio   recording   and   the   printout   will   be   stored   in   Services   for Sensitive   Data   (TSD),   which   is   UiO's   service   for   secure   data   storage.   The   information   about   you   is anonymised   and   it   will   not   be   possible   to   identify   you   in   the   results   of   the   study.

Only   psychology   student   Jenny   Langlo   and   professor   Marit   Råbu   (supervisor   and   project manager)   have   access   to   this   list.

The   information   about   you   will   be   deleted   at   the   end   of   the   project   in   December   2022.

## Possible   advantages   and

disadvantages Participants   will   be   given   the   opportunity   to   contribute   to   a   research   project   that   aims   to shine   a   spotlight   on   and   increase   understanding   of   misophonia.   Participation   in   the   study   will   only   involve taking   part   in   a   research   interview   as   described.   You   decide   for   yourself   if   there   are   topics   during   the interview   that   you   do   not   want   to   talk   about.
