## Abstract

Objective: To explore the condition of misophonia, its definition, possible neurological correlates, its associated morbidity, its possible psychiatric relevance and potential treatment.

Method: Provision of an illustrative case vignette and a review of the limited literature.

Results: Misophonia is a symptom associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety disorders and may be a syndrome in itself associated with significant distress and avoidance. Treatments are not well validated.

Conclusion:

Misophonia may be an under-recognised condition of psychiatric relevance.

Keywords: misophonia, human sounds, rage

## A case of misophonia

The following account was provided to the author by a 41-year-old  mother-of-two  under  his  care  for  a  mixed anxiety disorder complicated by extensive medical comorbities. She asked the author if he was aware of a condition  she  had  self-diagnosed  on  the  internet  misophonia.

My daughter was just sitting in the lounge eating carrots. I could hear each time she would pull back the alfoil and start to crunch. By the second crunching and alfoil noise it  had  started  for  me;  I  started  breathing,  trying  not  to react. Deep breathing, pacing, elevated heart rate, extreme anxiety.  To  me  it  seemed  like  minutes,  but  it  was  only seconds. I started grabbing my hair, shaky, my head was overwhelmed. By the next action of the foil being pulled back  and  the  next  carrot  crunch,  BANG,  there  was  no more I  could  do  to  keep  calm.  My  body  and  mind  had taken over and I had started roaring at her, swearing and had no control.

## Methodology

The author, being previously unaware of the condition, performed a review of the literature using Pubmed and Google  Scholar  search  engines.  The  literature  is  very limited, with two cross-sectional surveys and a number of  case  studies.  As  a  consequence,  all  articles  were assessed.

## Historical development

The term misophonia ,  coined  by  audiologists  Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 1  refers to a strong dislike of certain sounds and an abnormally strong reaction to them, characteristically anger and even rage. The above account captures the essence of misophonia, literally 'hatred of sound' or, more  specifically,  intense  negative  reaction  to  certain sounds, as captured in the pseudonym 'selective sound sensitivity' [Johnson]  2 . Originally described in the audiology literature, it has become increasingly recognised as a neuropsychiatric symptom of potential relevance in a range of psychiatric conditions and as a potentially disabling disorder in itself.

Unlike  other  symptoms  of  auditory  disease,  including tinnitus  and  hyperacusis  (which  are  both  frequently associated with misophonia), the purest form of misophonia  can  occur  without  activation  of  the  auditory apparatus. 1  The potential for psychological factors to be of significance in misophonia is illustrated by Jastreboff and  Jastreboff. 1   As  they  state, 1: p.3   'the  strength  of  the patient's  reaction  is  only  partially  determined  by  the

physical  characteristics  of  the  upsetting  sound  …  it  is also dependent on the patient's previous evaluation of and recollection of the sound, the patient's psychological profile and the context in which the sound is presented'.

## Clinical descriptions

The sounds that most frequently induce misophonia are bodily  sounds,  especially  those  associated  with  eating (81%) or breathing (64%). 3  Other sounds that more frequently  induce  misophonia  include  repetitive  sounds such  as  pen  tapping  or  clicking,  but  there  are  many sounds  that  can  be  associated  with  the  condition. 3 Repetitive sounds may be particularly troubling, as may spoken 'S' sounds. Subjects in a study by Edelstein et al. 4 described trigger sounds evoking intense affects toward the person making the offensive sounds, very similar to the case described at the start of this article, for example 'I hate this person'. Their study findings also confirmed the substantial disability related to this condition, 1  with subjects avoiding situations likely to provoke symptoms, including meals with family and friends. Subjects also described problems  with  attending  lectures  due  to offending sounds by classmates. 4

## Epidemiology of misophonia

There is limited information regarding the prevalence of the condition, but it may be quite common. The audiology literature describes a 40% comorbidity of hyperacusis  with  tinnitus,  but  there  is  a  lack  of  information specific to misophonia. 1  Probably the most useful guide to prevalence is from Wu et.al's 5  sample of 483 undergraduates, in which nearly 20% reported clinically significant misophonia symptoms.

## Neurobiology of misophonia

The pathophysiology of misophonia is unknown. It is known that the characteristics of sound can contribute to its potential to be aversive, and knowledge of the origin of a sound can also influence the extent to which it is aversive. Reuter and Oehler 6  showed that the galvanic response to the noise of nails on a blackboard was diminished if the subjects were, incorrectly, informed that the noise was from pieces of contemporary music.

In a related fashion, the context in which the sound is produced is relevant in misophonia. A characteristic feature of misophonia is that the bodily sounds produced by significant others are quite likely to induce extreme emotional responses. 4  Interestingly, similar sounds elicited by the misophonia sufferer themselves do not elicit a response.

Misophonia is felt to reflect a heightened level of connectivity  between the auditory, autonomic and limbic systems.  Taking  this  concept  further,  it  has  been  suggested  that  misophonia could be considered a type of sound-emotion  synaesthesia .  The  inducers  and  concurrents of synaesthetes can be emotional rather than perceptual and, like synaesthesia, the neurological basis of misophonia  may  be  a  consequence  of  pathologically enhanced connections between brain regions. 4

A case-controlled comparison of skin conductance response  (a  measure  of  sympathetic  nervous  system arousal) in subjects with misophonia exposed to a variety of visual and auditory stimuli demonstrated subjects having  higher  skin  conductance  response  to  auditory but not visual stimuli. 4  While both groups found certain stimuli aversive, study  subjects demonstrated  more marked subjective aversive responses. Significantly, both controls and misophonia subjects found similar stimuli to  be  aversive,  raising  the  possibility  that  misophonia sufferers  were  not  intrinsically  different  from  those without the condition, 'but merely at the tail end of the distribution'. 4:10

## Associations with anxiety disorders

The avoidance and subsequent disability associated with misophonia has obvious parallels with some anxiety disorders and with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Wu et al. 5 investigated the incidence of misophonia symptoms and associations  of  these  symptoms  with  other  disorders, including  obsessive-compulsive  disorder,  anxiety  disorders and depression, in a sample of 483 undergraduate college students. Their study involved administration of a specifically designed  misophonia  questionnaire  in addition to a battery of other questionnaires exploring more general sensory defensiveness, disability, obsessivecompulsive  symptoms,  anxiety  symptoms,  depressive symptoms and rage. They also found moderate but statistically significant correlations between misophonia symptoms and obsessive-compulsive, anxiety and depressive  symptoms.  A  strong  correlation  was  found between misophonia and general sensory defensiveness.

## Possible association of misophonia and eating disorders

Kluckow et al. 7  report case studies of three patients with eating  disorders  who  report  characteristic  misophonia symptoms  and  raise  the  interesting  question  as  to whether we should screen for misophonia in eating disorders. Stiegler's 8  review of sound sensitivity in autistic spectrum  disorder  finds  virtually  no  evidence  of  true physiological differences in patients with autistic spectrum disorder, suggesting the likely role of 'misophonic' responses to distressing sounds.

## Nosological status - misophonia a stand-alone disorder?

While there are particular similarities between misophonia  and  obsessive-compulsive  disorder,  especially  the preoccupation with and avoidance of a specific trigger, Shroder et al. 9  argue for a distinction on the basis of the

ubiquity of rage responses and lack of consistent compulsive behaviour in their study sample. They have proposed  diagnostic  criteria  for  misophonia  as  a  new psychiatric  disorder.  They  found  evidence  of  common characteristics  in  their  subject  group  of  42  patients. These features included a mean age of onset of 13, triggering sounds all being made by humans (the most frequent  sounds  being  eating  sounds,  breathing  sounds and finger/hand sounds), a 28.6% rate of verbal aggression and a 5%  rate of past physical aggression. Interestingly, they also reported an 11.9% incidence of a similar response triggered by others' movements, which they coined misokinesia .

Their suggested criteria for misophonia have some parallels with panic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. They include the presence or anticipation of a specific sound made by a human being and the provocation by that sound of an intense impulsive aversive physical reaction  that  instantaneously  becomes  anger;  a  profound sense of loss of control associated with the experience; a recognition that the reaction is disproportionate; and significant distress or disability related to the condition.

## Treatments

There  is  limited  information  regarding  treatment  and minimal  validated  evidence  for  treatment  efficacy.  The use of sound generators (coloured noise of the troubling frequency) to muffle the offending sound, in combination with family support and education, may be helpful in reducing the severity of reactions. 4,10-11  An alternative approach is using pleasant sounds (e.g. music) to distract from the offending sound and positive association and desensitisation  with  graded  exposure  to  the  offending sound. 10-11   Cognitive  behavioural  approaches  and  hypnosis have also been advocated. 10-12  Maguire et al. 12  report on two cases of apparently successful treatment of misophonia in two cases with CBT involving graded exposure to increasingly  noxious  sounds  and  restructuring  of unhelpful cognitions (e.g. relating to the person making the sound), and described encouraging outcomes.

Sufferers may find relief from mimicking the offending sound or synchronising self-generated noises (e.g. chewing) with it. 4,11  Clearly, an understanding social environment  is  important  so  that  others  don't  take  offence. Greater insight into phenomena anecdotally associated with misophonia, including muscle tension, unwanted sexual  arousal  and  the  possibility  of  potentiation  and generalisation  of  triggers  has  also  been  anecdotally reported as beneficial. 11

## Conclusion

While the literature relating to misophonia remains very sparse, there does seem to be a very recent spike in interest in this area. Online misophonia support groups are proliferating. 11,13,14  The psychiatric status of misophonia remains unclear. It would seem likely that misophonic symptoms are common but, typical of other spectrum conditions, there is significant disability at the extreme. The apparent association with anxiety disorders suggests further  exploration  of  misophonia  symptoms  in  this population may reveal significant potentially remediable disability.

There would also seem to be further avenues for collaborative research with audiologists, especially in developing treatment options such as the use of sound generators to facilitate graded exposure in CBT. Whether misophonia is a discrete syndrome remains a matter for debate and future study. It is possible that misophonia is a relatively common form of broader conditions of excessive environmental sensitivity. Clearly, there are a number of avenues for future research, but in the current state of knowledge, clinical consideration of possible misophonia  symptoms  may  provide  patients  empathic  understanding of a distressing and  potentially disabling condition, and possibly provide treatment options.
