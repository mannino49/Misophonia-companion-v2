Misophonia involves a decreased tolerance to certain sounds and is associated with a range of  emotions  and  emotion  processes.  In  addition  to  the  distress  caused  by misophonia, some individuals report having aggressive outbursts and significant impact on doing things they would like to be able to do. This study aimed to examine whether misophonia-specific cognitive and emotional processes were associated with misophonic outbursts and impact, and whether these relationships could be explained in part by emotion processes not specific to misophonia. A sample of 703 individuals, 315 of whom identified with having misophonia, completed measures of misophonia, depression and anxiety symptoms, anxiety and disgust sensitivity, interoception and beliefs about emotions. Exploratory correlation and regression analyses were used to build mediation models, which were tested using multiple linear regression. Externalising appraisals (blaming others for causing one's reaction to sounds) were positively associated with misophonic outbursts, and this relationship was partially explained by anxiety symptoms and disgust sensitivity. Sense of emotional threat in misophonia predicted functional impact of misophonia, and this was partially explained by depression symptoms and negative beliefs about emotions. Anxiety sensitivity and interoception were not significant independent predictors of misophonic outbursts or functional impact. These results provide support for the relevance of emotion processes in misophonia and highlight the importance of using multi-dimensional measures of misophonia to improve our understanding of the condition.

## INTRODUCTION

Misophonia  is  characterised  by  decreased  tolerance  to  select  sounds  that  might  be  only  mildly aversive  to  others,  which  can  lead  to  intense  emotional,  physical  and  behavioural  reactions and  functional  impairment  (Swedo  et  al.,  2021).  Current  research  suggests  that  its  aetiology is complex,  possibly  influenced  by  individual  perception,  past  experiences,  context,  acoustic features  of  sounds  (Jastreboff  and  Jastreboff,  2002;  Bernstein  et  al.,  2013;  Rouw  and  Erfanian, 2018)  and  atypical  connectivity  in  the  brain  (Kumar  et  al.,  2017).  In  addition  to  the  distress caused  by  misophonia,  there  are  negative  outcomes  in  terms  of  aggressive  outbursts  and  the

impact of the disorder on being able to live a full and productive life  (Swedo  et  al.,  2021;  Vitoratou  et  al.,  2021).

One study found that although patients frequently reported fears about resorting to violence, physical outbursts in misophonia were  rare  (Jager et al., 2020).  This was  supported  by  the psychometric  analysis  of  the  S-Five,  a  measure  of  misophonia severity, in a sample of individuals identifying with the condition (Vitoratou  et  al.,  2021).  Within  the  'Outburst'  factor,  mean scores  were  approximately  5  (out  of  a  possible  10)  on  items about shouting, verbal aggression and worries about acting on violent  thoughts,  and  lower  for  physical  aggression  (mean  2.7 out  of  10)  and  violence  (2.3).

It is not  clear  what  factors  contribute  to  an  individual's tendency  to  have  verbal  or  physical  outbursts  in  misophonia. Anger  is  one  of  the  most  frequently  reported  emotions  in response  to  trigger  sounds  (Schröder  et  al.,  2013;  Vitoratou et  al.,  2021),  but  the  frequency  of  anger  reactions  to  triggers has  only  a  low  correlation  with  outbursts  (Vitoratou  et  al., 2021). Two studies examined the relationship between misophonia severity  and  general  anger  outbursts  (i.e.,  not  misophoniaspecific), and found that the relationship was partially mediated by  the  presence  of  anxiety  symptoms  (Wu  et  al.,  2014;  Zhou et  al.,  2017).

Another  study  found  that  anxiety  sensitivity,  a  relatively stable, transdiagnostic trait related to fearful beliefs about anxiety symptoms  (Hovenkamp-Hermelink  et  al.,  2019),  strengthened the relationship between misophonia symptoms and aggression (Schadegg  et  al.,  2021).  That  is,  at  higher  levels  of  anxiety sensitivity  (more  fear  of  anxiety  sensations),  misophonia  was more  strongly  associated  with  aggression.  However,  this  study did not control for anxiety symptoms, which are also associated with  anxiety  sensitivity  (Wheaton  et  al.,  2012).  It  is  therefore not  clear  whether  it  is  current  symptoms  of  anxiety  or  the trait of anxiety sensitivity, or both, that influences the relationship between  misophonia  and  general  aggressive  outbursts.

The  studies  described  above  did  not  examine  aggression  in the  context  of  misophonia-specific  outbursts,  focusing  instead on  general  aggression  and  outbursts.  Barahmand  et  al.  (2021) examined  traits  of dealing  with  emotions  as  predictors  of misophonic behaviour, which included misophonia-specific aggression.  They  found  that  disgust  sensitivity  was  associated with  misophonic  behaviours,  but  this  relationship  was  fully mediated by emotion dysregulation. They proposed that misophonic  behaviours  emerge  from  an  interplay  of  emotions and  cognitive  processes.

Misophonia-specific  outbursts  are  captured  in  one  of  the dimensions  of  the  S-Five  scale  (Vitoratou  et  al.,  2021).  In  the initial psychometric analysis of this scale, outbursts were positively associated with all the other dimensions of the scale: internalising  and  externalising  appraisals,  sense  of  emotional threat and functional impact. Given that aggression is associated with other-directed blame (Kulik and Brown, 1979), the association  between  misophonic  outbursts  and  externalising appraisals is worth exploring further. Individuals with misophonia have  expressed  negative  assumptions  about  the  character  of those  making  unpleasant  sounds  (Edelstein  et  al.,  2013;  Rouw and  Erfanian,  2018;  Vitoratou  et  al.,  2021),  as  captured  in  the externalising  factor,  but  it  is  not  yet  clear  whether  there  is  a direct  or  indirect  relationship  between  these  interpretations  in the  moment  and  aggressive  outbursts.

Outbursts in misophonia were also associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety, and functional and social impairment (Vitoratou  et  al.,  2021).  Further  research  into  predictors  of misophonia-specific  outbursts  would  be  helpful  for  identifying potential targets to address this negative outcome for individuals with  misophonia.

Beyond  outbursts,  individuals  living  with  misophonia  also report impact on social and occupational functioning (Edelstein et al., 2013;  Rouw  and  Erfanian,  2018),  loss  of  enjoyment (Hocaoglu,  2018),  not  being  able  to  go  places  and  see  the people they would like to see and concern about future impact of  the  condition  (Vitoratou  et  al.,  2021).  In  a  study  of  828 individuals  with  self-identified  misophonia,  an  average  score of  45  out  of  a  possible  50  was  found  for  the  S-Five  variable described as emotional threat, which  captures a sense of misophonia-specific emotional dysregulation, with items about feeling  distressed,  trapped  and  helpless  if  unable  to  get  away from sounds (Vitoratou et al., 2021). If day-to-day sounds like eating and  breathing can potentially lead to such intense reactions, it  is  not  surprising  that  individuals  with  misophonia would report limited lives and concerns about future opportunities. As yet, it is not clear which psychological processes may  contribute  to  greater  impact  of  misophonia,  in  terms  of the  perceived  limitations  of  misophonia  on  daily  functioning and  concerns  about  future  functioning.  To  our  knowledge, there  is  no  prior  research  examining  this  specifically.

## Summary and Aims of the Study

Existing  research  has  shown  us  that  symptoms  of  misophonia are  likely  associated  with  a  range  of  emotion  processes.  Based on  the  literature, it seems  that  there  are  several potential emotion  processes  associated  with  misophonia,  including  an increased propensity to experience certain emotions (Barahmand et al., 2021), awareness  of  bodily sensations connected  to emotions  (interoception;  Kumar  et  al.,  2017;  McKay  et  al., 2018), beliefs about the nature and consequences of sensations caused  by  emotion  (e.g.,  anxiety  sensitivity;  Schadegg  et  al., 2021)  and  the  presence  of  symptoms  of  disorders  related  to emotional  health,  such  as  anxiety  and  depression  (Erfanian et  al.,  2019;  Jager  et  al.,  2020).

Further investigation is needed to improve our understanding of  the  role  of  these  emotion  processes  in  misophonia.  We  also need research to distinguish between misophonia-specific processes (e.g., a sense of uncontrollable emotions  in  the presence  of  sounds)  and  general  processes  (e.g.,  believing  that one's  emotions  are  uncontrollable,  in  general).

The aim of this exploratory study was to examine these processes in a sample of both individuals who identify with having misophonia and  individuals  who  do  not  identify  with  having  misophonia. We aimed to examine this specifically in relation to two negative outcomes  in  misophonia:  aggressive  outbursts  or  fear  of  having outbursts  (henceforth  'outbursts')  and  the  perceived  impact  in terms of limitations on functioning (henceforth 'functional impact'). We theorised that misophonia-specific variables would be significant

predictors  of  the  outcome  variables  and  aimed  to  investigate whether  these  relationships  could  be  partially  or  fully  explained by  variables  related  to  emotions  and  general  emotion  processing.

Specifically,  we  hypothesised  misophonic  outbursts  would be  predicted  by  the  S-Five  variable  of  externalising  appraisals, that is, the tendency to put blame for one's reactions to sounds on  to  the  person  making  the  sound.  We  also  hypothesised that functional impact would be predicted by the S-Five variable of  emotional  threat.

Drawing from the existing misophonia literature, the additional predictor  variables  we  examined  were  interoception,  disgust propensity and sensitivity, anxiety sensitivity, beliefs about emotions  and  symptoms  of  depression  and  anxiety.  As  there were  no  previous  studies  examining  these  variables  in  the context of misophonia-specific outcomes at the time of designing the research, we did not form any a priori hypotheses regarding their  possible  impact.  Instead,  we  aimed  to  develop  models to  be  tested  in  an  exploratory  study.

## MATERIALS  AND  METHODS

## Recruitment

As  part  of  a  wider  project  studying  misophonia,  participants were recruited from two different sources. The sampling service Prolific was used to recruit participants from  the general population. To ensure our sample also included a large number of  individuals  experiencing  symptoms  of  misophonia,  we  also recruited  from  misophonia  support  groups  on  social  media (e.g.,  Facebook).  Inclusion  criteria  included  being  older  than 18 years  old,  with  enough  fluency  in  English  to  complete  the questionnaire, and without any severe learning disabilities. Attention-check items were included in the survey and participants were  removed  if  they  did  not  complete  these  satisfactorily.  All participants gave informed consent before beginning the survey.

## Measures

Information on the participants' age, gender, ethnicity, education and occupation were collected. During this process, participants were also asked whether they self-identify with having misophonia (yes,  no  or  unsure).  Participants  were  then  presented  with  the list  of  measures  listed  below.

## Selective  Sound  Sensitivity  Syndrome  Scale

The S-Five is a multidimensional tool for measuring misophonia severity  (Vitoratou  et  al.,  2021).  It  has  five  distinct  factors: internalising and externalising appraisals, emotional threat, outbursts and functional impact. The five factors demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency ( α ≥ 0.83)  and  stability  in  time (stability  coefficients  &gt;0.80  in  all  items  and  factors;  Vitoratou et  al.,  2021).  The  supplementary  trigger  checklist  of  the  S-Five was  not  used  in  the  present  study.

## Anxiety  Sensitivity  Index-3

The  ASI-3  (Taylor  et  al.,  2007)  is  an  18-item  inventory  that measures  anxiety  sensitivity,  the  fear  of  sensations  related  to anxiety,  across  three  dimensions:  physical,  cognitive  and  social concerns. All three subscales have demonstrated high reliability in internal consistency in both clinical and non-clinical samples ( α &gt;  0.70).

## Body  Consciousness  Questionnaire

The BCQ (Miller et al., 1981) is a 15-item self-report questionnaire measuring  three  components:  public  body  consciousness,  body competence and private body consciousness. Participants completed the whole scale, but only the private body consciousness subscale ( α =  0.69)  was  used  in  this  study  for  the  purpose  of  measuring interoception, one's awareness of internal bodily sensations. This subscale was found to be higher in those with misophonia than without (Kumar et al., 2017), and there was no current theoretical rationale  for  inclusion  of  the  other  two  subscales.  All  subscales have  demonstrated  high  test-retest  reliability.

## Disgust  Propensity  and  Sensitivity  Scale-Revised

We used the 12-item, shortened version of the DPSS-R (Fergus and Valentiner, 2009), the full version of which contains 16-item (van  Overveld  et  al.,  2006).  The  items  are  measured  on  a  fivepoint scale (from never to always) and form two factors. Disgust propensity  is  the  ease  of  which  one  is  disgusted,  whilst  disgust sensitivity  is  how  bothered  an  individual  is  by  their  disgust (van  Overveld  et  al.,  2006).  Both  reduced-item  subscales  show good internal consistency, at α =  0.83  for  disgust  propensity and α =  0.80  for  disgust  sensitivity  and  share  a  moderate  to  strong correlation  (  = 0.59)  with  one  another  (Fergus  and  Valentiner, r 2009).  In  the  present  study,  we  used  the  combined  propensity and  sensitivity,  henceforth  referred  to  as  disgust  sensitivity.

## Generalised  Anxiety  Disorder-7

The GAD7 is a widely used, valid and reliable scale measuring symptoms  of  anxiety  (Spitzer  et  al.,  2006).  It  has  seven  items, each  measuring  the  frequency  of  symptoms  (from not  at  all to nearly  every  day ).

## Leahy  Emotional  Sensitivity  Scale-II

The Leahy Emotional Sensitivity Scale-II (Leahy, 2012; Unpublished Manuscript)   consists  of  28  items  measuring  14  dimensions, 1 with a six-point ordinal response scale measuring negative beliefs about  emotions  (e.g.,  'I  feel  ashamed  of  my  feelings'),  with higher  scores  indicating  more  negatively  held  beliefs.

## Patient  Health  Questionnaire-9

The PHQ9 is a widely used measure of symptoms of depression (Kroenke  et  al.,  2001).  It  has  nine  items,  each  measuring  the frequency  of  symptoms  (from not  at  all to nearly  every  day ) and  has  good  validity  and  reliability.

## Data Analysis

In this work, we focused on two main models. First, we studied the  effect  of  the  externalising  factor  on  outbursts,  followed  by

1 Leahy,  R.  L.  (2012).  Leahy  Emotional  Schema  Scale  II  (LESS  II).    American Institute  for  Cognitive  Therapy  (Unpublished  Manuscript).

the  effect  of  the  threat  factor  on  functional  impact.  In  both models,  we  adjusted  for  age,  gender,  identifying  as  having misophonia or not and a set of covariates. The set of covariates was identified in the literature and was verified first by exploring the  inter-correlations  between  the  measures  used  in  the  study. That  is,  pairwise  correlations  of  the  key  variables  of  interest (interoception, anxiety sensitivity, disgust sensitivity, beliefs about  emotions,  anxiety  symptoms,  depression  symptoms,  as well  as  the  S-Five  total  score  and  factors,  along  with  age  and gender)  were  examined  separately  for  those  who  identified with  and  without  misophonia.  Variables  that  did  not  show significant  correlations  were  removed  from  consideration.

Next,  forward  stepwise  linear  regression  was  conducted  to build comprehensive models. At each step, all possible combinations of  predictor  variables  were  entered,  and  any  variables  found  to be  non-significant  at  any  step  in  this  process  were  removed. We chose a stepwise selection procedure to account for possible multicollinearity between predictor variables. Significant variables were  carried  forwards  to  the  next  step,  increasing  the  number of variables in the model until the best fitting model was found. This process yielded the models with the combinations of variables that  explained  the  largest  amount  of  the  outcome's  variability, as determined by the model's R 2 value, the percentage of variability explained  by  the  included  variables.  The  resulting  models  were carried  forwards  into  mediation  analyses.

Lastly,  parallel  mediation  analyses  were  carried  out  with the PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2017), which uses the theoretical Sobel  test  and  Baron  and  Kenny's  four  steps  to  determine mediation (Baron and Kenny, 1986), as well as a bootstrapping procedure to test the hypothesis. Unstandardised indirect effects were  computed  for  each  of  5,000  bootstrapped  samples,  and the  95%  CI  was  computed  by  determining  the  indirect  effects at the  2.5th  and  97.5th  percentiles.  All  data  analyses  were conducted on IBM SPSS Statistics  for  Windows  (Version  26.0. Armonk,  NY:  IBM  Corp).

## RESULTS

A  total  of  728  participants  submitted  completed  surveys.  Of these,  25  were  removed  for  not  satisfactorily  passing  attention check  items,  leaving  a  total  sample  of  703.  Within  this,  396 were  recruited  from  the  sampling  service  Prolific,  and  307 were recruited from misophonia groups on social media. Participants  were  then  split  into  two  groups  based  on  their answer to the question, 'Do you identify with having misophonia?' Those who  responded yes were labelled as 'Identifying  with  having  misophonia'  and  those  who  said  no, or  that  they  were  unsure,  were  labelled  as  'Not  identifying with having misophonia. ' Participant demographics are presented in Table 1 and comparisons between the two groups all variables of  interest  are  presented  in Table  2 . Comparisons  between means  are  presented  for  variables  with  normal  distributions and comparisons between medians are presented for skewed  variables.

The pairwise correlations between the variables of interest are presented in Table 3 . Externalising was moderately correlated  with  the  outburst  subscale.  Similarly,  threat  was moderately  correlated  with  the  functional  impact  subscale. We  therefore  retained  these  main  relationships  of  interest for  further  exploration of our hypotheses. Interoception was not significantly correlated with any of the four target variables  in  the  sample  identifying  with  misophonia  and was  therefore  not  carried  forwards  into  the  next  stage  of analysis.  All  other  variables  were  positively  correlated  with our four main variables of interest, and with overall misophonia severity, and  were  therefore retained for the next stage of  analysis.

For  all  the  retained  variables,  correlations  were  significant in  both  groups  (i.e.,  those  identifying  with  misophonia  and those  who  did  not).  We  therefore  combined  the  samples  at this  stage  to  increase  the  power  of  our  remaining  analyses. In  each  subsequent  analysis,  we  first  controlled  for  whether participants  identified  with  having  misophonia  or  not.

## Main Effects Analysis

In  the  forward  stepwise  regression,  predictors  were  added  one at  a  time,  and  in  each  model  tested,  any  variables  found  to be  non-significant  were  removed. Figure  1 summarises  the process  of  building  the  models  to  be  tested  in  the  mediation analyses,  showing  the  point  at  which  non-significant  variables were  removed.  We  present  the  regression  results  for  only  the final  models  that  emerged  from  this  process  (see Table  4 ;  full stepwise  regression  results  available  on  request).

For the dependent variable outbursts, the final model included predictor variables externalising, disgust sensitivity and anxiety symptoms,  explaining  46%  of  the  variance.  For  the  dependent variable functional impact, the final model included the predictor variables threat, beliefs about emotions and depression symptoms, explaining  63%  of  the  variance.

## Mediation Analyses

After  controlling  for  age,  gender  and  whether  they  identified with  misophonia  or  not,  both  disgust  sensitivity  and  anxiety symptoms partially mediated the relationship between externalising and  outburst in misophonia  ( Figure  2 ). The indirect effect of disgust sensitivity on externalising and outburst was  0.017,  and  the  indirect  effect  of  anxiety  was  0.029  (total indirect effect 0.046). The bootstrapped unstandardised indirect effect  was  0.046,  and  the  95%  CI  ranged  from  0.023  to  0.074. Both the indirect and direct effects of externalising on outbursts were  statistically  significant  ( p &lt;  0.001).

After controlling for age, gender and whether they identified with misophonia or not, beliefs about emotions and depression symptoms partially mediated the relationship between emotional threat  and  functional  impact  in  misophonia  ( Figure  3 ).  The indirect  effect  of  beliefs  about  emotions  on  the  relationship between threat and functional impact was 0.046, and the indirect effect of depression on threat and functional impact was 0.055, making the total indirect effect 0.100. The bootstrapped unstandardised indirect effect was 0.100, and the 95% CI ranged from  0.064  to  0.142.  Both  the  indirect  and  direct  effects  of externalising on outbursts were statistically significant ( p &lt;  0.001).

## DISCUSSION

The aim of this study was to examine two commonly reported negative  outcomes  of  misophonia:  aggressive  outbursts  and perceived  current  and  future  impact  that  misophonia  has  on seeing  people  and  doing  things.  We  aimed  to  explore  these in relation to both misophonia-specific and more  general emotional  processing  variables.

As  hypothesised,  misophonic  outbursts  were  significantly predicted  by  the  S-Five  variable  of  externalising  appraisals, that  is,  the  tendency  to  blame  others  for  the  intensity  of  one's reactions  to  sounds  made  by  others.  This  relationship  was partially explained by anxiety symptoms and disgust sensitivity. This  builds  on  previous  research  finding  that  the  relationship between misophonia and general aggressive outbursts was partly explained  by  symptoms  of  anxiety  (Wu  et  al.,  2014;  Zhou et al., 2017). Neither anxiety sensitivity nor beliefs about emotions  were  significant  independent  predictor  of  outbursts in  our  exploratory  regressions,  which  is  interesting  in  relation to previous research finding that anxiety sensitivity strengthened the  relationship  between  misophonia  and  general  aggression (Schadegg  et  al.,  2021).  However,  that  study  did  not  control for the presence anxiety symptoms, which our findings suggest is more relevant than fear of anxiety symptoms, for misophoniaspecific outbursts, at least. Another  study found that the relationship between trait neuroticism and misophonia symptoms was  completely  mediated  by  impulse  control  difficulties,  an aspect  of  emotion  regulation  (Cassiello-Robbins  et  al.,  2020). Theoretically,  it  makes  sense  that  impulse  control  could  be  a potential  key  mechanism  in  outbursts  in  misophonia,  and  it is  possible  that  impulse  control  could  explain  the  association we  found  with  anxiety  symptoms.

Disgust sensitivity was also a significant independent predictor of  misophonic  outbursts.  Barahmand  et  al.  (2021)  found  an association between disgust sensitivity and misophonic behaviours,  which  included  aggressive  outbursts  as  well  as non-aggressive avoidance. They found that this was completely mediated by emotional dysregulation, which we did not measure in  our  study.  Further  research  is  needed  to  clarify  whether disgust  sensitivity  is  a  significant  component  in  misophonic outbursts.  If it is an  important  factor,  then  it  would  also be  useful  to  examine  whether  this  relates  to  core  disgust  in response  to  sounds,  or  socio-moral  disgust  (Simpson  et  al., 2006),  which  could  be  in  response  to  the  behaviour  of  the perpetrator of the sounds or directed towards oneself for having outbursts,  and  could  have  implications  for  treatment.

Impact

Values in brackets show correlation coefficients of the group not identifying with misophonia. All values were significant at the 0.01 level (two-tailed), except where indicated. ns, correlation is not significant.

Given  the  cross-sectional  nature  of  our  study,  the  direction of  these  relationships  between  externalising  appraisals,  anxiety symptoms,  disgust  sensitivity  and  misophonic  outbursts  is  not clear.  One  of  the  items  in  the  outbursts  factor  relates  to  being afraid  of  doing  something  aggressive  or  violent.  It  is  therefore possible that the association with anxiety symptoms can be  accounted  for  by  this  specific item, rather than  actual outbursts. It is also possible that those who have had outbursts in the past may experience more anxiety in general, in anticipation of what might happen in triggering situations or anxiety about the impact of their outbursts. It is possible that these associations could  be  explained  by  emotion  dysregulation,  in  line  with  the findings  of  Barahmand  et  al.  (2021)  and  Cassiello-Robbins et al. (2020). There may also be other variables not yet measured in  misophonia  research  that  could  be  contributing  to  these relationships, for example,  a  tendency  to  engage  in  angry rumination,  which  has  previously  been  linked  to  generalised anxiety  (Jessup  et  al.,  2019),  aggression  and  externalisation  of blame  (Schoenleber  et  al.,  2021).  Further  exploration  of  this in qualitative and survey studies would be helpful for developing and  testing hypotheses  that  may  support  the  development of  interventions.

Our  second  outcome  variable  of  interest  was  functional impact, which was significantly predicted by the S-Five variable measuring  a  sense  of  emotional  threat. This was  partially explained by depression symptoms and beliefs about emotions. Previous research has also found an association between symptoms of depression and misophonia (Erfanian et al., 2019; Jager  et  al.,  2020).  Again,  it  is  not  clear  whether  there  is  a causal  pathway  here.  It  is  possible  that  the  extreme  sense  of dysregulation  captured  in  the  threat  variable  contributes  to low  mood,  which,  in  turn,  leads  to  withdrawal  from  activities and hopelessness about the future with misophonia. Alternatively, it could  be  that  low  mood  is  caused  by  withdrawal  from activities as  a result  of  the  distress  caused  by  misophonia. When we look at this in the context of beliefs about emotions, it  is  possible  that  beliefs  that  these  emotions  in  misophonia are  wrong  or  harmful  could  also  lead  to  withdrawal  from other  people.  The  LESS  II  captures  a  wide  range  of  negative beliefs about  emotions,  with  a  broader  theme  of  emotions being  bad,  wrong  or  harmful,  as  opposed  to  fear  of  emotions as  captured  in  the  measures  of  anxiety  and  disgust  sensitivity. Therefore,  negative  beliefs  about  emotions  might  contribute  to functional  impact  through  behavioural  responses  to  shame  or guilt  about  emotions  in  misophonia,  as  opposed  to  a  fear  of emotions captured in the sensitivity measures (which were not significant independent predictors). There could also be another variable  or  set  of  variables  that  could  further  explain  these relationships.  Along  these  lines,  the  tendency  to  ruminate  in a  depressive  way  could  be  associated  with  greater  sense  of threat,  low  mood,  more  negative  beliefs  about  emotions  and greater avoidance, withdrawal and hopelessness. In-depth interviews and prospective and experimental studies are needed to  shed  light  on  these  relationships.

It was interesting to find that interoception was not significantly  correlated  with  any  of  our  S-Five  outcome  or predictor  variables  in  the  group  who  identified  with  having

misophonia.  This  was  surprising  considering  previously  found associations  between  interoception  and  misophonia  symptoms (Kumar  et  al., 2017; McKay  et  al., 2018). Examining  our correlations further, we  noted that interoception had low, significant  correlations  with  overall  misophonia  severity  and with the internalising appraisals factor, suggesting that

interoception might play a part in some aspects of misophonia but  not  others.  We  also  found  that  it  was  significantly  (albeit weakly)  correlated  to  all  S-Five  variables  in  the  group  that did  not  identify  with  misophonia.  It  would  be  interesting  to test this association further in future research, perhaps investigating  whether  one's  misophonia  'status'  moderates  the relationship between interoception and misophonia symptoms.

## Limitations

There  were  some  limitations  to  this  study.  Most  importantly, this  was  an  exploratory study, and our results should therefore be  considered  theories  to  be  tested  further.  We  recruited  from two different populations and used self-identification with misophonia (or not) to create  our  initial  two  groups.  We  then combined  the  sample  for  our  regression  analyses,  controlling for the 'identification with misophonia' variable in all regression analyses.  While  there  are  currently  no  published  cut-off  scores on  the  S-Five,  we  note  that  the  mean  score  for  the  S-Five total in our sample  of those identifying with misophonia (mean = 147.15,  data  available  on  request)  was  comparable  to the  means  presented  in  the  original  validation  of  the  S-Five in a sample  of individuals identifying with the condition (mean = 148.0).  Future  studies  testing  theories  emerging  from this  research  would  benefit  from  using  either  community  or

clinical samples, with a view to later doing comparison studies between  clinical  and  non-clinical  groups,  using  gold  standard diagnostic  interviews  to  create  clinical  groups.  However,  this is difficult  to  achieve  without  agreed  diagnostic  criteria  for misophonia. Additionally, participants recruited from misophonia social  media  groups  were  disproportionately  female,  consistent with other research on misophonia. Future studies would benefit from a more balanced sample and testing for differences between gender  groups.  Finally,  we  used  the  combined  total  of  the Disgust  Sensitivity  and  Propensity  scale  as  our  measure  of disgust  sensitivity.  In  future  studies,  it  would  be  preferable  to separate  these  two  constructs  and  test  whether  both  have  a direct  impact  on  aspects  of  misophonia.

## Summary and Conclusion

This exploratory study is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate potential predictors of two misophonia-specific outcomes: outbursts and functional impact. Our findings suggest that these two aspects of  misophonia  are  related  to  cognitive  and  emotion  processes, both  misophonia-specific  and  non-specific.  This  highlights  the importance of breaking misophonia down  into its different dimensions  to  improve  our  understanding  of  the  condition  and its consequences.  The  study  provides  further  support  for  the notion that there are psychological aspects to misophonia, which raises hope for developing and adapting psychological interventions to  improve  the  lives  of  those  suffering  with  the  condition.
