Abstract  
Misophonia is a condition characterized by strong, aversive reactions to specific 
sounds produced by others, often manifesting as intense negative emotions like 
anger or rage in response to nearby noises. The pres ent study aimed to evaluate the 
effectiveness of an mHealth app in reducing misophonia symptoms and related 
cognitions. In this study, 85 participants were randomly assigned to an immediate 
app use (iApp) or delayed app use (dApp) group and completed measu res at 
baseline (T0), after 15 days of app use (T1 for iApp, T2 for dApp), and at 1 -month 
follow -up (T3). Intention -to-treat analyses at T1 revealed significant interaction 
effects; compared with the dApp group, the iApp group exhibited lower misophonia 
symptoms on select measures (interaction effect sizes ranging from d  = 0.06 to 0.52) 
as well as reductions in anger ruminations and anger -related metacognitions 
(interaction effect sizes of d  = 0.47). Within -group analyses demonstrated substantial 
reductions  in misophonia symptoms from baseline to follow -up (iApp: d  = 0.62–1.51; 
dApp: d  = 0.89–1.75) with similar decreases in anger -related outcomes (iApp:

2 d = 0.89–0.92; dApp: d  = 0.85–0.90). Mediation analyses, however, did not support 
an indirect effect of th e intervention on misophonia symptoms via changes in 
rumination or anger -related metacognitions. mHealth applications show promise in 
alleviating misophonia symptoms and related cognitive processes. Further research 
is needed to elucidate the roles of ange r rumination and metacognitions in 
misophonia.

Introduction  
Misophonia  
Misophonia  is a condition in which individuals react negatively to patterns of sound 
or sounds that occur in specific situations or settings but tolerate other sounds with 
similar physical features (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001). Common misophonic 
triggers are huma n‐generated sounds, such as chewing and sniffing. However, 
each individual with misophonia may have their own unique set of triggers. These 
triggers may include different types of sounds or even particular visual stimuli, for 
example, the sight of lips mov ing or seeing someone chewing gum, even though the 
chewing noise is inaudible. Usually, triggers start with a familiar person and expand 
to include unfamiliar individuals in broader social contexts (Edelstein et al., 2013; 
Johnson et al., 2013; Schröder et  al., 2013; Taylor, 2017). Self -produced sounds 
usually do not trigger misophonic triggers (Potgieter et al., 2019).  
The reported prevalence of misophonia is between 6% and 20% (Wu et al., 2014; 
Zhou et al., 2017), with the onset of symptoms usually occurring in childhood or early 
adolescence (Johnson et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2013). Misophonia has been 
associated with various disorders of sensory intolerance (tinnitus, hyperacusis, 
phonophobia), as well as with anxiety, depression, obsessive -compulsive symptoms, 
Tourette’s syndrome, eating disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(Kluckow et al., 2014; Neal & Cavanna, 2013; Schröder et al., 2013; Wu et al., 
2014). However, no empirical support was found for misophonia symptoms bein g 
attributed to auditory disorders caused by neurological dysfunction (Schröder et al., 
2013) or other neurological abnormalities (Jastreboff & Hazell, 2008; Jastreboff & 
Jastreboff, 2013; Kumar et al., 2017; Møller, 2011). Misophonia has no official 
diagn ostic criteria within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
fifth edition or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related 
Health Problems 10th revision (Kumar et al., 2017).  
Misophonia symptoms are provoked by t he presence or anticipation of a specific 
sound produced by other people (e.g., eating or breathing sounds). Individuals with 
misophonia report difficulty averting their attention from the misophonic sound (Jager

Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof
3 et al., 2020) and an impulsive aversive phy sical reaction to these sounds. These 
reactions are reported to start with feelings of irritation or disgust, followed by anger 
and a profound sense of loss of self -control (Schröder et al., 2013).  
Individuals with misophonia usually recognize that their emotional responses may be 
unreasonable or excessive to the circumstances. Although uncommon, misophonic 
triggers can lead to aggressive outbursts (Schröder et al., 2013). Negative 
behavioral reactions to misophonic triggers may also include deliberately m imicking, 
glaring at, or verbally confronting the person creating the misophonic triggers (e.g., 
castigating, yelling, or tantrums in the case of children and adolescents; Taylor, 
2017). Indeed, research findings have linked misophonia symptoms with increa sed 
feelings of anger and disgust, leading to avoidance or externalization by confronting 
the person making the offending sound (Jager et al., 2020; Taylor, 2017). Moreover, 
misophonic symptoms have been linked with anger -related maladaptive beliefs, 
including the attribution of selfish intentions to others and believing that close others 
are uncaring (Bernstein et al., 2013).  
There have been several attempts to find an effective treatment for misophonia 
(Bernstein et al., 2013; Dozier, 2015; McGuire et al ., 2015; Rabasco & McKay, 2021; 
Schröder et al., 2017). For instance, Schröder and colleagues (2017), used 
systematic confrontation with the aversive stimuli (i.e., exposure) to decrease 
misophonic triggers. However, they reported this approach to be less successful and 
found such an approach may even increase misophonia symptoms. Other attempts, 
however, showed more encouraging results. For instance, Bernstein et al. (2013) 
reported a single case study using a brief targeted course of Cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) to treat misophonia. This intervention included a cognitive component 
in which the participant identified maladaptive thoughts and recognized that their 
emotional reactions stemmed from core beliefs (e.g., “My needs were not important 
to othe rs”). The intervention also incorporated attention redirection techniques and 
role-playing exercises, ultimately resulting in significant symptom improvement.  
More recent studies have evaluated interventions based on the Unified Protocol (UP) 
for treating misophonia symptoms (Barlow et al., 2018). For instance, Tonarely et al. 
(2023) described a single case study in which the UP -A was applied to a 16 -year-old 
client with misophonia and comorbid anxiety, reporting qualitative improvements in 
emotional and be havioral reactions to triggers. Similarly, Lewin et al. (2021) found 
that the UP -C/A for children and adolescents led to modest improvements in 
misophonia symptoms based on evaluator -rated measures, with additional benefits 
from standard relaxation protoco ls. McMahon et al. (2024) extended this research by 
evaluating the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the UP among adults with 
misophonia, reporting effect sizes ranging from d = 0.33 to d = 1.03 in a sample of 
10 participants. However, the findings  from these studies are limited by small sample 
sizes, case -study designs, and limited statistical power, constraining the 
generalizability of the results.

4 Similarly, Rabasco and McKay (2021) presented two cases in which stress 
management and exposure ther apy-based treatment reduced misophonic symptoms 
in adults. Their protocol incorporated misophonia -specific exposure hierarchies, 
structured exposure exercises, and stress management strategies to facilitate 
engagement. In a larger study (n = 90), Schröder et al. (2017) found that CBT -based 
interventions —including task concentration exercises, counterconditioning, stimulus 
manipulation, and relaxation exercises —led to symptom reduction in more than half 
of their clients.  
 Cognitive behavioral models of psych opathology suggest that maladaptive 
interpretations of internal or external events can trigger excessive emotional 
responses (Kovacs & Beck, 1978; Tremblay & Dozios, 2009). In misophonia, 
exposure to trigger sounds typically results in immediate irritation  or rage. Beliefs 
that others are inconsiderate or deliberately produce these triggering sounds may 
intensify through anger -related rumination further reinforcing beliefs about others' 
intentionally provocative behavior (Bernstein et al., 2013; Salguero et  al., 2020). 
When such interpretations combine with metacognitive beliefs about emotional 
dysregulation or sound intolerance, individuals may resort to avoidance behaviors, 
ultimately increasing their emotional distress. These behaviors, in turn, may lead to a 
self-perpetuating cycle that maintains and exacerbates emotional reactivity to 
triggers. Indeed, research indicates that addressing maladaptive cognitions and 
reducing anger rumination can enhance emotional regulation and decrease 
misophonic sound sen sitivity (Schröder et al., 2017). Targeting anger -related beliefs 
may, therefore, reduce misophonia symptoms.   
This model is consistent with findings indicating maladaptive appraisals of the human 
origins of misophonic sounds are an essential component to individuals ’ maladaptive 
responses to them (Schröder et al., 2013). For instance, Edelstein et al. (2020) used 
self-rating and skin conductance measurements to assess the aversiveness of 
various sounds for individuals with misophonia symptoms. They found t hat human 
eating sounds were more averse to these individuals than animal or noneating 
sounds. These authors concluded that attributing the sound’s source to humans 
plays a decisive role in what are considered trigger sounds in misophonia.  
The Current Stu dy  
The current study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to evaluate 
whether reducing anger -related cognitions would be associated with reductions in 
misophonia symptoms. To do this, we used an mHealth intervention (GGanger) 
specifically desig ned to target anger -related cognitions. Several benefits of the 
mHealth interventions include accessibility and availability (i.e., increased access to 
and delivery of care to people worldwide; Kumar et al., 2013; Linardon et al., 2019, 
2020), low cost, an onymity (Grist et al., 2017; Linardon et al., 2019; Olff, 2015), and 
playfulness.  
One module on the ocd.app of the GGtude mHealth platform is GGanger. The

Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof
5 GGtude platform has significant empirical findings supporting its efficacy (Aboody et 
al., 2020; Aki n-Sari et al., 2022; Ben -Zeev et al., 2021; Cerea et al., 2020, 2021, 
2022; Gamoran & Doron, 2023; Giraldo -O’Meara et al., 2022; Oron et al., 2020; 
Pascual -Vera et al., 2018; Roncero et al., 2018, 2019). Ten RCTs have shown that 
training on the GGtude plat form is associated with decreased anxiety, depression, 
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), relationship OCD (ROCD), negative body 
image, and COVID -19-related distress symptoms (Aboody et al., 2020; Akin -Sari et 
al., 2022; Ben -Zeev et al., 2022; Cerea et a l., 2020; 2021; Roncero et al., 2019). 
Training on the GGtude platform has also been associated with increased self -
esteem, positive body perceptions, positive recovery attitudes (Aboody et al., 2020; 
Ben-Zeev et al., 2022; Cerea et al., 2021; 2022; Girald o-O’Meara et al., 2022).  
The GGtude platform is designed to increase the accessibility of adaptive cognitions 
over maladaptive ones. Repeated exposure to adaptive cognitions may increase 
their availability and accessibility to users ’ inner monologues. The  routine use of 
such exercises may increase awareness of users ’ inner monologues and reduce 
rigid anger -provoking interpretations of daily events. Succinct psychoeducation 
scripts (e.g., “Believing that you must continue thinking about what angers you 
main tains anger. This, in turn, negatively impacts your wellbeing and interactions 
with others. Here, we start reducing this belief “) may further motivate and facilitate 
users ’ comprehension of fundamental CBT principles.  
In this study, we assessed whether t argeting anger -related maladaptive cognitions 
would be associated with decreased misophonic symptoms. We hypothesized that 
compared to the delayed -use app group (dApp) at T1, the immediate -use app group 
(iApp), who started using the app immediately after t he baseline measurement, 
would show a statistically significant decrease in misophonia symptoms and anger -
related cognitions. We also expected that the dApp group would exhibit a significant 
decline in all measurements following crossover (between T1 and T 2: after 15 days 
of app use, T1 for iApp, T2 for dApp). All reductions in symptoms and maladaptive 
cognitions found in the iApp group were expected to be maintained at follow -up. 
Finally, we expected that changes in anger ruminations and metacognitions wou ld function as 
mediators in the relationship between the intervention and misophonia symptoms.  
Methods  
Participants  
The sample consisted of 97 Hebrew -speaking individuals who self -reported as 
suffering from misophonia. The inclusion criteria required part icipants to be aged 17 
years or older, with no gender -based exclusions, and to score above a moderate 
level (21 –30) on the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale -Revised (AMISOS -R) 
questionnaire. Of the 97 participants who enrolled in this study, 12 dropped out 
before  completing the T0 assessment and were excluded from the analyses. The

Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof
6 remaining 85 participants all met the inclusion criteria. The AMISOS -R sum scores 
for the sample ranged from 24 to 47, with a mean score of 35.11 ( SD = 5.91). 
Participants were recruite d via social media platforms, specifically through forums 
and groups dedicated to misophonia on networks (Facebook and WhatsApp). They 
were provided with an online consent form detailing the study’s purpose and were 
informed of their right to withdraw at a ny point. The gender distribution included 74 
females (87.1%) and 11 males, with a mean age of 36.55 years ( SD = 11.26).  
Measures  
Misophonia Symptoms Measures  
Amsterdam Misophonia Scale. The Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A -MISO -S; 
Schröder et al., 2013) is a n 8-item questionnaire in which participants review their 
experience and avoidance levels from facing misophonia sounds in the last 7 days. 
They rated their emotions on a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 ( none ) to 4 ( extreme ), 
except for Items 1 and 8, which w ere open questions. The two open -ended 
questions from this questionnaire were excluded for quantitative statistical analyses. 
The focus was retained solely on the six numerically rated items. Cronbach’s alphas 
at the measurement points were α = .66 (T0), α = .63 (T1), α = .59 (T2), and α = .62 
(T3).  
Amsterdam Misophonia Scale -Revised.  The Amsterdam Misophonia Scale -
Revised (AMISOS -R; Jagger et al., 2020) was adapted from the A -MISO -S 
(Schröder et al., 2013). In this 12 -item measure, participants reviewed th eir 
experience of facing misophonia sounds in the last 3 days and rate their emotions on 
a 5-point scale from 0 ( not at all ) to 4 ( extreme ), except for Item 12, which ranges 
from 0 ( always ) to 4  (never ). The first two items of this questionnaire aim to ide ntify 
the types of sounds that trigger sensitivity and the range of emotions experienced in 
response. These questions allow multiple responses and, therefore, were excluded 
from the statistical analysis. Consequently, only 10 of the 12 items were included in 
the analysis. Cronbach’s alphas at the measurement points were α = .87 (T0), α = 
.80 (T1), α = .87 (T2), and α = .87 (T3).  
Misophonia Screening List. In the 14 -item Misophonia Screening Scale (MISO -
SCREE; Jager et al., 2020; Schröder & Spape , 2014), par ticipants reviewed their 
experience and rated the answers that were most applicable to them on a 5 -point 
scale from 0 ( very much disagree ) to 4 ( very much agree ). Cronbach’s alphas at the 
measurement points were α = .82 (T0), α = .80 (T1), α = .72 (T2), an d α = .79 (T3).  
Table 1 presents the Cronbach’s alpha values for all misophonia measurements 
across assessment points.  
<<Table 1 near here>>  
Ruminations, Metacognitions, and Thoughts About Anger Measures   
Anger Rumination Scale.  Anger rumination was assessed by the 19 -item Anger

Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof
7 Rumination Scale (ARS; Sukhodolsky et al., 2001), which includes four factors: 
angry afterthoughts (six items; α = .86), thoughts of revenge (four items; α = .72), 
angry memories (five  items; α = .85), and understanding of causes (four items; α = 
.77). The items were rated on a 4 -point Likert -type scale from 1 ( almost never ) to 4 
(almost always ) for how well the items corresponded to the participants’ beliefs about 
themselves. Cronbach’s alphas at the meas urement points were α = .93 (T0), α = .83 
(T1), α = .81 (T2), and α = .88 (T3).  
Metacognition and Anger Processing Scale.  The Metacognition and Anger 
Processing Scale (MAP; Moeller et al., 2016) is a 31 -item scale that includes three 
factors: positive metacognitions about anger (nine items; α = .85), negative 
metacognitions about anger (12 items; α = .86), and rumination (10  items; α = .85). 
The items are rated on a 4 -point scale of 1 ( never true ), 2 (sometimes true ), 3 (often 
true), and 4 ( always true ). Due to theoretical considerations, we decided to include 
only the rumination factor (MAP -R) in our questionnaires. Cronbach ’s alphas at the 
measurement points were α = .92 (T0), α = .86 (T1), α = .71 (T2), and α = .80 (T3).  
State -Trait Anger Expression Inventory.  The State -Trait Anger Expression 
Inventory (STAXI; Spielberger, 1985) is a 44 -item scale that includes five factors : trait 
anger (10 items; α = .86), anger control (eight items; α = .79), anger in (six items; α = 
.73), anger out (11  items, α = .82), and the fifth factor, state anger, which was not 
used in our study due to theoretical considerations. The items are rated  on a 4 -point 
scale from 0 ( almost never ) to 3 ( almost always ). Only the trait anger subscale 
(STAXI -T) was used in our study to assess baseline differences between groups. 
Cronbach’s alphas at the measurement points were α = .85 (T0), and α = .78 (T3).  
Materials and Procedure  
The first assessment point (T0) involved participants completing a demographic 
survey along with measures  related to misophonia and anger (misophonic -related 
appraisals: MISO -SCREE, A -MISO -S, AMISOS -R, ARS, MAP -R, STAXI -T). The 
same set of questionnaires was administered for subsequent evaluation points  
(T1, T2, T3), excluding the demographic survey.  
Following completion of the baseline assessment (T0), participants were randomly 
allocated to one of two experimental conditions. Those  in the immediate intervention 
group (iApp) began the intervention shortly after this initial assessment and used the 
GGtude platform over 2 weeks, followed by a postintervention assessment (T1). A 
final assessment was conducted at a 1 -month follow -up (T3;  see Figure 1).  
In the delayed -use app group (dApp), participants completed the baseline 
questionnaires (T0), waited 2 weeks, and completed them again at T1. They then 
used the GGtude platform for 2 weeks before completing the assessment at T2. One 
month later, the dApp group completed the final follow -up at T3 (see Figure 1).

8 Intervention  
GGanger is a module within the ocd.app that addresses maladaptive metacognitions 
associated with anger difficulties. This module consists of 56 l evels grouped into 14 
days. First -time app users complete a short tutorial on the effect of our inner 
monologue on their anger reactions. They then learn to use brief play -like 
interactions to make their inner monologue calmer and healthier. Each training 
session includes heightened cognitions (“my extreme anger keeps me safe”) or 
challenges maladaptive metacognitions related to anger (e.g., “I see more clearly 
when I’m calm”). Users learn to identify and adopt helpful cognitions (i.e., ones 
inconsistent wi th maladaptive beliefs) by swiping them down toward themselves to 
the bottom of the screen. They practice discarding cognitions that match their 
maladaptive metacognitions by sliding them up (off the screen). The application also 
includes exercises to stre ngthen and improve learning. For example, users may be 
asked to identify which of three cognitions appeared in the previous level or to 
choose the adaptive response between two or three options. At the end of each 
practice day, there is a breathing relaxat ion exercise.  
Statistical Analyses  
Analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS (Version 27). To compare the two 
experiment groups (iApp and dApp), a 2 x 2 (Group [iApp, dApp] x Time [T0, T1]) 
repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was per formed on 
six dependent variables. This analysis allowed us to assess changes within each 
group over time and between -group differences at both time points.  In addition, 
we conducted separate repeated -measures MANOVAs for each group to evaluate 
within -group effects across three time points (T0, T1, and T2) and at a 30 -day 
follow -up. These analyses enabled us to examine immediate and sustained changes 
followin g the intervention. In addition, pre - to post intervention changes within each 
group were analyzed using repeated measures MANOVA, with time as the within -
subject variable. Finally, we used the SPSS PROCESS macro (Hayes,2018) for 
testing whether the effect  of condition (iApp vs. dApp) on post -intervention 
misophonia symptoms at T1 was mediated by post -intervention anger meta -
cognitions at T1 and anger ruminations at T1. Baseline levels (T0) of misophonia 
symptoms, anger ruminations, meta -cognitions, as well  as demographic covariates 
(gender and age) were controlled for in this model. A 5000 -sample bootstrap 
procedure was used to estimate bias -corrected 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to 
test the significance of indirect effect of the relationships. If CIs do not contain 0, 
indirect relationships are significant, indicating significant mediating effect (Hayes, 
2018).

9 Preliminary Analysis  
Post intervention assessments were completed by 65.5% of participants, and 56.9% 
completed the follow -up assessment  (see Figure 2). We used an intent -to-treat 
approach to prevent the potential bias effect of randomized allocation and missing 
responses and implemented a multiple imputation strategy to replace missing values 
(Hollis & Campbell, 1999). Multiple imputation  is considered a suitable method of 
handling missing data in repeated measure designs. It has been shown to have 
utility with levels of missing data greater than that observed in this study (Vallejo et 
al., 2011). Specifically, we used multivariate imputat ion with chained equations (Van 
Buuren & Groothuis -Oudshoorn, 2011). Multiple imputation methods follow three 
steps: a) imputing , repeating over several iterations ( i) as opposed to a single 
imputation; b) analyzing , after each iteration, the dataset compl eted is analyzed, 
leading to a distribution of i statistics, one per dataset; c) pooling , the i results are 
pooled into one estimate. Multiple imputation, therefore, also has the added benefit 
of examining the variance in estimates over iterations, reflect ing the degree of 
uncertainty over which value to impute (Lall, 2016).  
<<Figure 2 near here>>  
First, we compared the iApp and dApp groups in terms of gender, age, education, 
status, and their A -MISO -S, AMISOS -R, MISO -SCREE, ARS, MAP -R (anger 
rumination), and STAXI -T (trait anger) scores at baseline. The groups did not 
significantly differ in gender, age, education, status, and self -report measures (iApp: 
N = 48; dApp: N = 49; see Table 2).  
<<Table 2 near here>>  
We then conducted Pearson product -moment corr elation. These analyses indicated 
that individuals with higher levels of misophonia symptoms also reported higher 
levels of anger rumination and anger traits (see Table 3).  
<<Table 3 near here>>  
Between -Group Differences (iApp Group Versus dAapp Group)  
We examined the effectiveness of GGtude in reducing misophonia symptoms (A -
MISO -S, AMISOS -R, and MISO -SCREE) and anger symptoms (MAP -R and ARS) 
scores with 2 x 2 (Group [iApp, dApp] x Time [T0, T1]) repeated measures MANOVA. 
Group was treated as a between -subject factor, and time was treated as a within -
subject factor. Type 1 error was controlled using the false discovery rate (Benjamini 
& Hochberg, 1995; Keselman et al., 1999) correction ( p < .05). The false discovery 
rate adjusts the criterion alpha level f or significance based on the number of 
statistical tests conducted that fail to reach an increasingly stringent probability level. 
In this study, two tests were not significant (A -MISO -S, AMISOS -R); therefore, the 
criterion alpha was adjusted to 0.044.  
With regards to misophonia symptom measures, the follow -up ANOVAs indicated a

10 significant group x time interaction effect for MISO -SCREE, marginal significance for 
AMISOS -R (p = 0.073), and nonsignificant findings for A -MISO -S. Analyses of the 
anger -related measures revealed a significant group x time interaction effect for 
MAP -R and ARS (see Table 4 and Figure 3).

Within Group and 30 Days Follow -Up Effects: iApp Group  
In the iApp  group, we expected pre –post reduction in misophonia symptoms, anger 
rumination, anger trait, negative anger metacognitions, and retention of these effects 
in the follow -up period. Therefore, we examined pre –post changes with a repeated 
measures MANOVA wit h within -group Bonferroni corrections between T0, T1, and 
T3. Mauchly’s test of sphericity indicated that all measures met the assumption of 
sphericity.  
The AMISOS -R, MISO -SCREE, and MAP -R scores significantly decreased from T0 
to T1, whereas the ARS did not decrease significantly at this time point. In addition, 
there were no significant changes from T1 to T3 for the AMISOS -R, MISO -SCREE, 
and MAP_R. However, there was a significant decrease in the ARS (see Table 5). 
These results indicated that the iApp g roup exhibited lower misophonia and anger 
metacognition symptoms at T1 than at T0 and that these reductions were maintained 
at the 1 -month follow -up (T3). Anger ruminations showed a different pattern whereby 
significant reductions were indicated only at T3  compared to T0 (rather than at T1 
compared to T0).   
<<Table 5 near here>>  
Within -Group and 30 Days Follow -Up Effects: dApp Group  
In the dApp group, we expected crossover ( i.e., app use) to be associated with a 
significant decrease in misophonia and anger  symptoms. Thus, we conducted a 
repeated measures MANOVA with Bonferroni corrections between T0, T1, T2, and 
T3. Mauchly’s test of sphericity indicated that all measures met the assumption of 
sphericity.  
As expected, there were no significant differences between T0 and T1 before the 
intervention. In addition, as expected, within -group differences between T1 and T2 
revealed significant reductions in the AMISOS -R, MISO -SCREE, ARS, and MAP -R. 
Participants in the dApp group exhibited significantly lower misoph onia and anger 
symptoms at T2 compared to T1. In addition, there were no significant changes from 
T2 to T3 for AMISOS -R, MISO -SCREE, ARS, and MAP -R (see Table 5). These 
results suggest that the reductions identified in misophonia symptoms, anger 
metacognit ion, and rumination symptoms at T2 were maintained at the 1 -month 
follow -up (T3).

11 Mediation analysis of anger ruminations and metacognitions  
To assess whether anger related cognitions (anger ruminations and metacognitions) 
mediate the effects of the inter vention of misophonia symptoms we used the 
PROCESS macro model 4 (Hayes,2018).  This analysis indicated that the 
intervention condition (iApp vs. dApp) had a direct effect on post -intervention 
misophonia symptoms, controlling for baseline symptoms, anger r elated cognitions, 
and demographic factors (B = -0.1142, SE = 0.0443, p = 0.0118, 95% CI [ -0.2024, -
0.0260]). At T1, participants in the iApp condition reported significantly lower 
misophonia symptoms compared to those in the dApp group. The total effect o f the 
intervention on post -intervention misophonia symptoms was also significant (B = -
0.1159, SE = 0.0429, p = 0.0085, 95% CI [ -0.2013, -0.0304]) see table 6.  
The indirect effects of the intervention on misophonia symptoms via post -intervention 
anger rumi nations and meta -cognitions, however, were not statistically significant. 
Although the intervention condition significantly reduced post -intervention 
ruminations (B = -0.1041, SE = 0.0466, p = 0.0284), these ruminations did not 
significantly predict post -intervention misophonia symptoms (B = -0.0759, SE = 
0.1198, p = 0.5284) see table 6. Further, the effects of condition did not significantly 
predict post -intervention anger meta -cognitions (B = -0.0503, SE = 0.0418, p = 
0.2322), and anger meta -cognitions di d not significantly predict post -intervention 
symptoms (B = 0.1897, SE = 0.1335, p = 0.1595). The specific indirect effects 
through anger meta -cognitions (effect = -0.0096, 95% CI [ -0.0402, 0.0113]) and 
ruminations (effect = 0.0079, 95% CI [ -0.0177, 0.0327 ]), as well as the total indirect 
effect (effect = -0.0017, 95% CI [ -0.0348, 0.0249]), were non -significant see table 6. 
Demographic covariates, including gender and age, also had no significant effect on 
post-intervention misophonia symptoms (all p > 0.05 ).

Discussion  
Misophonia is characterized by an intense emotional and physiological response to 
specific sounds, leading to significant distress and impaired daily functioning 
(Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001; S chröder et al., 2013; Taylor, 2017). Current CBT -
based interventions have been shown to alleviate misophonic symptoms. However, 
most studies have been limited by noncontrolled design (e.g., Bernstein et al., 2013; 
Dozier, 2015) and small size (e.g., Mattso n et al., 2023). Previous studies also used 
costly face -to-face design (e.g., McMahon et al., 2024; Rosenthal et al., 2023) and 
did not exclusively focus on anger -related ruminations and metacognitions (e.g., 
McMahon et al., 2024; Schröder et al., 2017).

12 The current RCT included 85 participants, used a low -cost mHealth intervention, and 
specifically targeted anger -related ruminations and metacognitions. Our findings 
indicate that compared with the controlled group (dApp), participants in the 
immediate inte rvention group (iApp) showed significantly lower anger -related 
ruminations and metacognition at T1, sustained at the 1 -month follow -up. 
Participants also showed lower misophonia symptoms on the MISO -SCREE, 
marginal reductions on the AMISOS -R, and no reduct ion on the A -MISO -S. Within -
group analyses support the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing anger 
rumination, maladaptive metacognitions, and misophonia symptoms.  
Previous research identified anger as a key component of misophonia (Jager et al., 
2020; Schröder et al., 2013; Taylor, 2017). Current CBT models suggest maladaptive 
thinking patterns, metacognitions, and related interpretations of events can lead to 
excessive emotional responses (Kovacs & Beck, 1978). In line with this, reducing 
these t hought patterns may help alleviate symptoms of misophonia and associated 
anger (Schröder et al., 2013). For instance, Salguero et al. (2020) proposed that 
maladaptive and rigid metacognitions (e.g., “I can’t control my anger”) sustain anger 
rumination. Thi s leads to heightened anger, aggressive behavior, or avoidance of 
anger -inducing situations  
Our findings support these models by showing that targeting ruminations and anger -
related metacognitions are associated with reductions in some measures of 
misophon ic symptoms (MISO -SCREE). Following the intervention, medium effect -
size reductions were found in rumination, maladaptive metacognitions, and two 
measures of misophonia symptoms (.40 < d < .52). Moreover, following crossover, 
the dApp group showed signific ant reductions in anger ruminations and presented 
similar patterns to those in the iApp group. Both groups exhibited lower misophonia 
symptoms, anger metacognition, and rumination immediately after app use, with 
sustained improvements at the 1 -month follow -up (T3).  
To further explore the mechanisms underlying the observed reductions in 
misophonia symptoms, we conducted mediation analyses evaluating whether 
changes in anger rumination and metacognitions mediated the effect of the 
intervention on misophonia symptoms. The results suggested that the relationship 
between our intervention and misophonia symptom reduction is more complex than 
expected. Although the intervention reduced misophonia symptoms and ruminations, 
these improvements were not mediated by ch anges in anger -related metacognitions 
and ruminations. The intervention predicted decreases in ruminations, but neither 
ruminations nor metacognition predicted post -intervention misophonia symptoms. 
This suggests that symptom reduction was driven by direct  effects rather than 
through anger related ruminations or meta -cognitions. That is, the condition × time 
interactions effects shown in the repeated measures ANOVA for ruminations and 
anger -related metacognitions did not translate into significant mediation  pathways.  
This discrepancy may reflect methodological differences. Our mediation analyses

Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof
13 controlled for baseline mediator values, reducing available variance and statistical 
power, particularly in limited size samples like ours. ANOVA analyses, however,  
assesses raw changes over time, making it more sensitive to group differences. 
Further, the ANOVA is sensitive to within -group changes and detects differences in 
the pattern of change over time, whereas the mediation model evaluates whether the 
interventi on explains unique variance in post -intervention outcomes after controlling 
for baseline levels. The strong predictive power of baseline meta -cognitions may 
have attenuated the ability to detect an intervention effect in the mediation analysis. 
Together, t hese findings suggest that although the intervention impacted on the 
trajectories of the assessed anger -related processes, the observed changes were 
not sufficiently robust, after accounting for baseline, to mediate reductions in 
misophonia symptoms.  
Takin g these statistical limitations into consideration, the efficacy of the intervention 
in reducing misophonia symptoms may also be explained by its impact on 
maladaptive cognitive patterns not measured in this study. Specifically, the GGanger 
intervention ta rgets self and other -oriented perfectionistic beliefs (e.g., "Imperfection 
is failure"; “Others never try hard enough”), negative perceptions of others (e.g., 
"People are not considerate of my needs"), and self -critical metacognitions (e.g., "I 
must always  criticize myself to improve"). Previous studies have shown that modules 
on the GGtude platform successfully decrease such cognitions (e.g., Abramovitch, et 
al,.2024).  The additional beliefs targeted by the intervention   may have played a 
more central rol e in symptom reduction than the specific anger -related processes 
measured in this study. Future studies should explore the role of additional 
mechanisms to better understand how mHealth interventions reduce misophonia 
symptoms. Future studies might also be nefit from larger scale longitudinal mediation 
models to capture dynamic changes over time and improve sensitivity to indirect 
effects.  
Research on internet -based interventions for treating misophonia has been limited. 
Previous findings that used Internet -based or mHealth interventions in misophonia 
(e.g., Aazh et al., 2023; Ghorbani et al., 2022) used online face -to-face sessions or 
unguided Internet -based CBT. Our findings, which demonstrate symptom 
improvement of misophonia following the use of the GGang er module, support 
previous research, showing benefits across various psychopathologies with mobile 
app-based psychological interventions (Lui et al., 2017; Oliveriea et al., 2021). 
Moreover, this study assessed a fully remote mHealth intervention that did  not 
involve exposure to triggering sounds, making it more accessible and appealing to a 
broader audience. Fully remote mobile health apps have unique advantages, 
including an appeal to young people, the ability to monitor progress, continuous 
availability , wide reach, very low cost, and anonymity (Aboody et al., 2020).  
Compared to the waitlist control group (between T0 and T1), app use in our study 
demonstrated varying levels of symptom reduction across distinct misophonia 
symptom measures. Statistically s ignificant reductions were observed in the MISO -

Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof
14 SCREE, marginal decreases were found in the AMISOS -R, and non -significant 
reductions were noted in the A -MISO -S. These variations in symptom reduction can 
be attributed to the three measures’ unique structure s, focuses, and sensitivities.  
The MISO -SCREE, a comprehensive 14 -item questionnaire, assesses various 
misophonia symptoms. It uses a nuanced scale that captures subtle changes, 
contributing to its higher sensitivity and the statistically significant reduc tions 
observed. In contrast, the AMISOS -R evaluates immediate emotional responses 
over a narrow 3 -day timeframe. It exhibited only marginal decreases, given that its 
limited scope may not fully reflect broader or longer -term symptom changes. Last, 
the A -MISO-S demonstrated nonsignificant reductions. This lack of sensitivity may 
be due to its shorter length. Additionally, the questionnaire’s low reliability might have 
influenced the nonsignificant reductions in the A -MISO -S, further limiting its ability to 
detect meaningful symptom changes. These findings underscore how the design and 
focus of each instrument shape their effectiveness in capturing the impact of 
interventions.  
Within -group analysis of the iApp group showed significant reductions in misophonia 
symptoms and maladaptive anger metacognitions immediately after using the app 
(T1). These improvements were maintained at the 1 -month follow -up for both 
groups. An intriguing finding was the reduction in misophonia symptoms and anger -
related metacognition observed in the iApp group between T0 and T1, despite no 
significant decrease in anger ruminations during this period. Notably, anger 
ruminations showed a significant reduction only at T3 compared to T0. This pattern 
aligns with the idea that, although met acognitive interventions can influence thinking 
patterns, the effects of these changes are not immediate. They take time and 
practice to manifest (Love et al., 2022).  
Overall, the results indicate that GGanger may effectively reduce some misophonia 
symptom s, anger -related metacognition, and anger rumination, and that these gains 
may be maintained for at least 1 month without further use. These findings align with 
previous research linking the use of the GGtude platform with decreases in 
maladaptive beliefs,  metacognitions (e.g., OCD -related beliefs or body -image beliefs; 
Akin-Sari et al., 2022; Cerea et al., 2020; Giraldo ‐O'Meara et al,, 2021; Roncero et 
al., 2019) and associated symptoms (Cerea  et al., 2020, 2021, 2022; Pascual -Vera 
et al., 2018; Roncero et al., 2018, 2019). For instance, Cerea et al. (2020) showed 
significant medium -large reductions in OCD -related beliefs like perfectionism, 
intolerance of uncertainty, over importance of though ts and their control, as well as 
decreases in ROCD symptoms (Doron et al., 2014). Similarly, our findings suggest 
medium -large effect -size reductions in anger cognitions and in measures of 
misophonia symptoms.  
Our intervention targeted anger -related rumin ations and metacognitions, along with 
perfectionism, negative perceptions of others, and self -criticism. However, the 
intervention did not specifically target beliefs about misophonia -related sounds or

15 intent (i.e., attributions of intent behind trigger so unds or the perceived aversiveness 
of specific sounds). This approach was based on evidence highlighting the central 
role of anger in misophonia (Jager et al., 2020; Schröder et al., 2013). However, 
targeting beliefs explicitly addressing misophonia trigge rs (e.g., “They are making 
these chewing sounds on purpose” or “They don’t care that making these sounds is 
extremely distressing for me”) could potentially enhance the efficacy of the evaluated 
intervention. Future research would benefit from exploring th e efficacy of such an 
adapted version of the intervention on misophonia symptoms.  
Limitations  
Although this study may offer some insights regarding misophonia symptoms and 
their treatment, several limitations should be noted. Interventions involving cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) typically report dropout rates ranging from 30% to 40% for 
short -term programs (Amagai et al., 2022; Linardon et al., 2020) and unguided 
internet -based CBT interventions can reach up to attrition rates exceeding 50%, 
(Grist et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the 21.18% dropout rate in our study was notable.  
The relative scar city of internet -based CBT or mHealth interventions specifically 
designed for misophonia may have contributed to the lower attrition rate in our study. 
Further, our sample's mean age of 35.58 years (SD = 10.76) represents an older, 
typically more committed  demographic compared to adolescents and young adults, 
who generally show higher dropout rates in mHealth interventions (Egilsson et al., 
2021). Another factor that may have increased engagement is the game -like design 
of the evaluated intervention. Previo us research suggests that such a design can 
sustain user engagement by reducing common attrition triggers like boredom and 
frustration (Amagai et al., 2022). However, the dropout rate remains a limitation of 
this study and should be addressed in future res earch.  
Additionally, most participants were women, limiting the generalizability of the 
findings. There are conflicting findings regarding the impact of gender on the 
prevalence of misophonia. Although some studies suggest that misophonia is more 
common in  women, most research indicated that gender does not significantly 
influence its prevalence (Jakubovski  et al., 2022; Koroglu & Durat, 2024; Vitoratou et 
al., 2023 ). Future research should aim to recruit a more diverse sample in terms of 
gender, age, and e thnicity to increase the generalizability of the results. Additionally, 
self-report measures may have introduced bias. The literature suggested a 
neurophysiological approach to misophonia (Jastreboff et al, 2023). Hence, future 
research should include obje ctive measures, such as physiological assessments, to 
provide a more accurate evaluation  of misophonia. The follow -up period for this 
study was relatively short, and long -term effects need further investigation. It remains 
uncertain whether the observed re ductions in misophonia symptoms will be 
sustained over time. Last, future studies should explore whether booster sessions or 
ongoing treatment may be required to maintain therapeutic gains.

16 Conclusion and clinical implications  
This study demonstrates tha t a short, daily mHealth -based intervention targeting 
various metacognitions can effectively reduce misophonia symptoms, anger -related 
metacognitions, and anger rumination. This CBT -based app provides a scalable, 
cost-effective alternative to face -to-face therapy, particularly for individuals with 
limited access to traditional CBT. Unlike conventional interventions, this approach 
does not rely on exposure to aversive sounds or classic behavioral techniques. The 
findings highlight a link between anger -relate d metacognitions and reductions in 
misophonia symptoms, suggesting that targeting these cognitive processes may be 
a promising treatment avenue. However, given that anger -related cognitions did not 
mediate symptom reduction, future interventions may benefi t from a more 
comprehensive approach that addresses both the sensory and cognitive -emotional 
components of misophonia. Additionally, while mHealth apps show potential, 
research suggests that integrating them with some level of human guidance can 
enhance tr eatment outcomes (Linardon et al., 2019; Grist et al., 2017). Clinically, 
therapists could incorporate apps as adjuncts to CBT to reinforce core therapeutic 
strategies like cognitive restructuring to improve patient engagement. Further 
research is needed t o replicate these findings and examine the long -term effects of 
the GGtude anger module on misophonia and anger -related symptoms.
