## ABSTRACT

Separate air and bone conducted food sounds generated by six subjects into eight foods; were recorded and analysed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) signal analyser. A panel of 60 subjects classified the 8 foods according to their texture: crunchy and crackly and these textural characteristics were described by spectral characteristics of sounds foods (such as extruded flat breads) were found to generate high pitched sounds that show a high level of frequencies higher than 5 kHz, especially for air conduction. Crunchy foods (such as raw carrot) generate low pitched sounds with a characteristic on frequency range 1.25 to 2 kHz for air conduction. And crackly foods (such as biscuits) generate low pitched sounds with a high level of bone conduction: We hypothesize that discrimination between crunchy and crackly foods could be due to vibrations propagated by bone conduction that also generated vibrotactile sensations . biting crispy, biting Crispy peak dry

## INTRODUCTION

Auditory sensations are important to perceive texture of many foods . The French descriptors:   croustillant, craquant and croquant refer , in part, to noise generated during its eating process. French words croustillant and croquant can be translated into English as crispness and crunchiness;, respectively (Drake 1989) and craquant by crackliness. But meanings of corresponding French and English terms are not exactly example the most often mentioned as food by American people. French large crispy

would more likely describe lettuce as craquante (crackly) or croquante (crunchy) but not croustillante (crispy). most results obtained  with English descriptors can be transposed to French descriptors. In order to make reading easier, we chose to use English terms in this paper, although the subjects people

Since the work of Drake (1963), several attempts have been made to relate textural characteristics (especially crispness) to a spectral composition of food sounds that gives indications about sound quality. Sound quality is a complex function of several acoustical parameters (Marks 1974). Pitch is the main sound quality and is defined by the frequency of pure tones or by the frequency range with the highest energy level for complex tones. Density and tonal volume are two other sound qualities of pure tones. Complex tones present other dimensions , Musical timbre, for instance, is related to transients, i.e the nonstationary part of a musical sound at its start. Spectral characteristics give information about perceived sound quality and especially pitch but do not completely describe it.

Texture is usually judged on a quantitative basis, i.e. subjects are asked to judge crispness intensity of foods (from not to very crispy); then, one looks for physical characteristics of foods that vary according to their crispness inten sity _ Typically , tested foods are of one type: Swedish bread (Andersson et al. levels (Seymour and Hamann 1988) . Our approach was different: texture was judged on a qualitative basis, i.e. subjects were asked whether tested foods matched their crispness (crunchiness or crackiness) concept. Then, we looked for spectral characteristics of biting sounds that subjects used to decide whether one food was crunchy or crackly . Subjects judged texture both when actually ate foods and when only listened to reconstructed sounds so we could estimate how much information was lost when sensations other than auditory sensations were removed. Then, both air and bone conducted sounds were analysed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) signal that calculated the spectral power density of sounds . crispy crispy , they they analyser biting

Andersson et al. (1973), Drake and Halldin (1974) and Seymour and Hamann (1988) studied sounds generated by foods fractured by a mechanical apparatus . Their methods allowed them to control fracture parameters such as deformation speed, applied force or geometry of the deformation probe, but the generated sounds are different from eating sounds and perhaps do not contain the relevant information for texture judgment. Other studies integrated individual variability of sounds generated during the eating process, but only a part of vibrations that generate auditory sensations were analysed: airborne sounds (Vickers and Bourne 1976; Lee et al. 1988) or bone conducted vibrations (Drake 1965; Kapur 1971).

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

## Food Products

For this study, 8 food products were selected according to three criteria: had (1) to generate a sound when eating, (2) to be easily cut into standard size and (3) to present an uniform texture (without filling, for instance) . The characteristics of the selected foods are given in Table 1. they shape ,

## Sound Recording and Reconstruction

Six subjects (6 females) made five bites for each eight foods in a soundproof room. and bone conducted sounds were recorded simultaneously on the two tracks of a stereophonic tape with a digital recorder DTC-SSES. An AKG microphone type C4I4EB (frequency band 20-20,000 Hz) held at about 5 cm in front of the ear canal opening recorded air-conducted sounds and an AKG contact microphone type CAO1B (frequency band 10-10,000 Hz) pressed firmly against the mastoid bone; behind the ear pavilion; recorded bone conducted sounds (Fig. 1)Air Sony

Subjects reconstructed sounds by mixing their own tape recordings of air and bone conduction in order to reproduce as closely as possible sounds actually   heard when ate foods . Experimental   conditions are described elsewhere (Dacremont et al. 1991). biting they they

## Texture Judgment

There were 60 subjects (40 females and 20 males) , all students at the Universi ty, taking part in this test. None of them wore a denture or had audition disorder . Texture judgments were made by eating food samples or listening to tape recordof reconstructed biting sounds. Half the subjects tested the food samples first and the others judged the tape recordings first. ings

For each food product, citation fractions for the four possible responses were calculated as follow:

To test actual foods, the subjects were blindfolded and were given food samples with sugar tong, in order to eliminate visual and tactile clues. tested 23 foods in a random order but only results from the 8 foods of Table 1 are reported here. Half the subjects bit the foods only with incisors and the others bit and chewed For reconstructed sounds, subjects were also blindfolded. were informed that sounds heard were generated by someone biting into food samples. Subjects tested 96 reconstructed sounds (2 bites X 8 food products X 6 subjects) . For both experiments, subjects had to say whether the food was crunchy or crackly . had to pick only one of the three descriptors, but could also reply that none of the three descriptors was appropriate . No indication was given about the meaning of the three descriptors. They They they crispy , They they

## Frequency Analysis

Signal Analyzer. A Hewlett Packard type 35660A fast Fourier transform (FFT) real-time analyzer was used. Frequencies from 64 to 12 864 Hz were analysed . Frequencies are audible up to 20 kHz but, for airborne sounds (1) frequencies higher than 14 kHz could not discriminate sounds generated by foods with dif -

ferent crispness levels (Lee et al. 1988); (2) level of those frequencies (14-20 kHz) was at least 30 dB lower than level of the kHz frequency and (3) those frequencies have a low contribution to the auditory sensation because the perception threshold increases dramatically in this frequency range. Therefore, we could reasonably assume that frequency range 13-20 kHz brought negligible information.

Power Spectral Density. The signal analyzer computed FFT over 1024 samples which were sampled over a 31.2 ms signal duration because of the chosen sample rate. Waveforms of sounds (some examples are given 2) showed that sound duration was longer than 31.2 ms. signals were cut into 31.2 ms signal segments, and the power spectral of each segment was computed separately and then were averaged together. biting Fig. So, density they

The level of third octave intervals was visually evaluated with reference to the graphic spectra. One of each food eaten by each subject was characterized by levels of 45 third octave intervals, 23 from the air conduction spectrum and 22 from the bone conduction spectrum (the third octave interval 10to 12.5 kHz was not measured because the contact microphone did not record frequencies higher than 10 kHz) . Spectra examples are given Fig. 3_

Eating sounds are complex tones, closer to white noise (broad-range spectrum with all frequencies at the same amplitude) than to musical tone (discontinuous spectrum with few well identified frequencies) . The pitch of such sounds is gov erned by frequency ranges that have the highest spectral density level . So we found it more appropriate to divide spectra into several bands rather than look for very specific frequencies. Spectra were divided into third octave intervals because octave partition is a logarithmic scale that imitates human ear response in regard to pitch; for frequencies higher than 500 pitch varies with frequen (Zwicker and Feldtkeller 1981). It means that, in a complex tone two frequen cies belonging to the same third octave interval are not perceived as different in pitch. Hz,

Each triangle vertex stands for one descriptor: crackly and crunchy . Foods are plotted according to citation fractions of the three descriptors . The more often the descrip tor was quoted , the closer to the vertex the food was plotted . When texture judgments were made by eating foods, citation fraction of none of the descrip crispy ,

## Frequency Analysis

This analysis was conducted in three steps. First, we studied individual differences. Differences between sounds generated by different subjects the same food product were expected because spectral characteristics may be affected by resonance of the oral cavity (related to its and by the force-deformation pattern by the incisors. Both vary from one subject to another_ we had to make sure that differences between foods were larger than differences be tween subjects . eating shape) applied So,

Principal component analysis was performed on a matrix 48 rows (8 foods * 6 subjects) and 45 columns (levels of third octave intervals from air and bone conduction) and was run from the covariance matrix: The first three principal components accounted for 77.89 (50.4% 15.8% and 11.6% , respectively) of the variability in the data and the fourth principal component less than 5% . The

first principal component was positively correlated with the global spectral density (that corresponds to amount of sound) of bone conduction and the frequency range 250 to 1250 Hz of air conduction. Samples are separated along the second principal component according to their levels of very low and high frequencies (especially for air conduction) and the third principal component accordto their levels of air and bone conduction. along ing

In a second individual differences were eliminated by averaging spectral density over subjects and a further principal component analysis was performed. The analyzed matrix still had 45 columns (levels of third octave intervals for spectra from both conductions) but only 8 rows (the 8 tested foods) . The first three step, prin-

A cluster analysis was performed with food coordinates in the derived sample space and food sounds were divided into six clusters (Table 2). For four foods out of nine, sounds generated by five subjects were grouped together, and for three other foods, sounds generated by four subjects were grouped together . Differences between foods seemed larger than individual differences and s0, sound characteristics due to food products could be found independently from subjects that generated sounds. Cluster analysis also showed that Katimini spectrum from one subject (identified as subject was probably an outlier . Comparison of spectra from this subject and the others shown that spectral level for this subject was about 10 dB higher than for the others. No similar event was found for the other foods . The extreme value for Katimini eating by subject AN seems to be due to an error signal analysis and these data were discarded for subsequent AN) , density during analyses.

The composition of clusters is given by the number , for each food, of sounds generated by different subjects that were grouped together (for example, cluster grouped 5 people's almond sounds, 4 people's carrot sounds and Cracotte sound) . biting

cipal components accounted for 95.3% (50.3% , 26.1 % and 18.99 respectively) of the variability and the fourth principal component less than 2% . Attribute loading plots (Fig. 5) are very similar to those of the previous principal component analysis . The first principal component corresponds to the overall level of bone conduction and frequency range 125-1,250 Hz of air conduction. The second principal component is still explained by an opposition between high frequencies (2.5-12.5 kHz for air conduction and 1-10 kHz for bone conduction) and very low frequencies (60-125 Hz for air conduction and 60-80 Hz for bone conduction) . The third principal component is positively correlated to medium and high frequencies from air conduction; 1.25-2 kHz (also negatively correlated to the second principal component) and 2-10 kHz (also positively correlated to the second principal component) .

In a third we tried to describe food texture judgment by spectral characteristics of eating sounds. Multilinear regressions were performed between citation fractions for the three descriptors and coordinates of foods in the space generated by principal component analysis, using a vectorial model: step,

where F is the citation fraction for and X,, Xz and X; the coordinates of food sounds on the first, second and third principal component, respectively . The same model was used with citation fractions for crackly and crunchy . Vectors show directions in which crispness , crackliness or crunchiness are increas and their length is proportional to the regression coefficient. Their projections are represented by arrows on the food space (Fig. 6) Sounds generated by foods are high pitched (especially the air conduction) . have a low level of bone conduction, which emphasizes perception of high pitch. Sounds generated by crunchy foods are low pitched and have an intermediate level of bone conduction. show a characteristic spectral density at the frequency range 1.25-2 kHz for air conduction. Sounds generated by crackly foods are also low pitched but have an higher level of bone conduction and very low frequencies. crispy 'crispy ing crispy They They peak

As an example, spectrum from Cracotte (Fig. 3), judged shows a high level of high frequencies for both air and bone conduction. Air conduction spectrum from almond shows a characteristic peak on frequency range /-2 kHz and a high level of low frequencies. crispy ,

## DISCUSSION

Our results support the conclusions of Vickers (1984b, 1985): foods referred to as in our work generate sounds higher in pitch than crunchy foods. crispy biting

Table 3 recapitulates results from four studies (including this one) with frequency analysis of sounds generated by foods. Seymour and Hamann (1988) and Lee et al. (1988) compared food sounds and crispness intensity, while Gouilleux (1990) tested Cracotte and did not study  correlation with texture judgments . Even if the methodologies are very different, some interesting coincidences are noticeable dealing crispy

(2) The three mentioned studies showed characteristic frequencies around 3 kHz. We found that the frequency range 2-5 kHz (principal component 3) was not really specific for foods but separated Cracotte from Feuilleté  and Katimini . Spectral  density  of this frequency range might vary according to crispness intensity; this is supported by the results from another study , not reported here In that study , nine subjects were trained to perform a quantitative descriptive analysis of food texture and crispness was one of the rated descriptors . Feuilleté and Katimini were judged very similar and Cracotte was significantly crispier . crispy

(1) We found that sounds generated by foods have an high level of frequencies , 5-12.8 kHz; Lee et al. (1988)  and Gouilleux (1990) also found characteristic frequencies around 6 kHz and 8.5-9 kHz respectively . crispy

Seymour and Hamann (1988) studied correlations between crispness intensity and sound quality (and other physical parameters) for one product at several aw levels and found that the frequency range 1.9-3.3 kHz was better correlated to crispness judgments than the frequency range 0.5-1.9 kHz. But defined sensory crispness as the 'degree of high pitched noise perceived when through sample. It is not really surprising that crispness was correlated with frequency range 1.9-3.3 kHz, the highest analysed frequencies. they biting

Sounds generated by foods referred as crunchy were low pitched as found by Vickers (1984b, 1985) . For commercial   chocolate, Gouilleux (1990) found characteristic frequencies at the following values: 2.8-3 kHz, 5.3-5.5 kHz and 9.5-9.6 kHz. This did not coincide with the specific frequency range 1.25-2 kHz of air conduction that we found or with a low pitched sound. Brochetti et al. (1992) found that a 'formant trends to occur within the frequency range of 1-2 kHz for all foods and all subjects. This is not contradictory with our results; the amplitude of that frequency range might be higher for almond and carrot than for the other foods.

Sound is only a part of the perceived sensations that allow subjects to make their texture judgment. Crunchiness and crackliness are not very well separated when judgments are made on the basis of sound only. We found that sounds generated by crackly foods are low pitched with a high level of bone conduction. Yet, vibrations and especially low frequencies , propagated through bones and other tissues also generate vibrotactile sensations that are lost when texture is judged by sound only . Vickers (1984a) concluded that either oral or auditory stimuli can be used to make crackliness judgments. We hypothetise that bone being

conduction that generated both auditory and vibrotactile sensations allow subjects to discriminate between crunchy and crackly foods, both generating low pitched sounds. biting

Texture judgment was designed to classify food products into three classes that the French call crispness; crunchiness and crackliness. Subjects tested foods once only because responses had to be spontaneous.  Therefore, we obtained group results but no indications about individual differences: For those foods that were judged both and crackly (or both crackly and crunchy) , we do not know whether actually exhibited both characteristics at the same time or were definitely judged crackly for some subjects and definitely (or crunchy) for others . crispy they crispy

Vickers (1988a) reviewed the literature deal with correlations between instrumental parameters and sensory crispness and found that the best correlations with sensory crispness were obtained with one acoustical  parameter and one mechanical parameter together. Stimuli other than auditory stimuli are involved in crispness judgment (Vickers 1987, 1988b) and crackliness judgment (Vickers 1984a) So acoustic   analysis   might never be sufficient to predict perceived crispness (crackliness/crunchiness) . However , acoustic analysis could be improved in order to obtain more accurate parameters from eating sounds. First, bone conduction has to be analysed with air conduction and their respective contributions to the auditory sensations should be considered. Dacremont et al. (1991) showed that contribution of both conduction ways depends on technique and tested foods. Furthermore , FFT was designed to process stationary signals, i.e signals where the spectral characteristics are time independent. sounds are very likely to be nonstationary signals. This is supported by the work on time representation of sounds by Edmister and Vickers (1985) and Vickers (1984a, 1987, 1988a). The implementation of time-frequency processing methods, such as spectrographic analysis, wavelet representation or Ville transform; should improve the accuracy of the reuslts . Those analytical methods are already applied to various fields of acoustics (speech analysis, bioacoustics; propagation) and spectrographic analysis was already used to process eating sounds (Drake 1965; Vickers and Bourne 1976; Brochetti et al. 1992). The main problem with time-frequency representations is that are usually visually interpreted.  An appropriate statistical tool needs to be found in order to obtain the information used for texture judgment among data variability . ling along eating Eating eating Wigner they
