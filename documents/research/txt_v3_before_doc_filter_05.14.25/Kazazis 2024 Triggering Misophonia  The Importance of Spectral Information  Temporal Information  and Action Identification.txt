## ABSTRACT

## ARTICLE HISTORY

Misophonia is characterized by severe negative emotional responses  to  specific  environmental  sounds.  In  this  experiment, we investigated the importance of spectral and temporal acoustic information, as well as the role of action identification (e.g., chewing)  in  triggering  misophonia.  Eighteen  participants  with  severe misophonia  completed  the  experiment.  In  total,  three  stimulus sets  were  used:  the  first  set  consisted  of  recorded  sounds  that were  either  common  misophonic  triggers  or  neutral  sounds  that are  not  expected  to  trigger  misophonia;  the  other  two  sets  were each generated by applying temporal and spectral modifications to the  unmodified  (recorded)  stimulus  set.  Participants  rated  how triggered  they  were  by  each  sound  (i.e.,  aversiveness)  and  were asked to identify the action category of each sound. The unmodified  trigger  sounds  were  rated  to  be  more  aversive  than  neutral sounds  ( p &lt; 0.0001).  The  main  effects  of  modification  type  and identification  on  aversiveness  of  trigger  sounds  were  significant ( p = 0.0001  and p = 0.006,  respectively),  but  their  interaction  was marginally  significant  ( p = 0.053).  Although  the  unmodified  and temporally  modified  sounds  were  not  significantly  different  from each other ( p = 0.4), spectrally modified sounds were rated significantly less  aversive  than  both  the  temporally  modified ( p = 0.003) and  unmodified  sounds  ( p = 0.001).  Regarding  identification,  the sounds  that  were  incorrectly  identified  were  on  average  rated  as less  aversive  than  the  correctly  identified  sounds  ( p = 0.006). Furthermore,  the  interaction  shows  that  the  identification  effect was  largest  for  the  spectrally  modified  sounds.  This  shows  that both  identification  and  spectral  information  play  an  important role in triggering misophonia.

## Introduction

Misophonia is a psychological disorder that is characterized by severe aversive responses to specific environmental sounds (i.e., triggers). Although there are many idiosyncrasies in what may trigger a person with misophonia, the most common triggers are created by

other humans, such as the sound of someone chewing, clearing their throat, tapping their foot, or typing on a keyboard. Given the high prevalence of such sounds in everyday life, having  misophonia  can  have  large  negative  effects  on  one's  functioning  in  personal, academic, and work environments. Wang et al. (2022) found that anxiety and depression symptoms, negative beliefs about emotions, and disgust sensitivity were related either to the functional impact of misophonia or to misophonic outbursts (Vitoratou et al., 2021).

The  disorder  is  not  yet  recognized  by  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  -  5 th version (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013), but there has been an increasing amount of research on the characterization and treatment of misophonia (Vitoratou et  al.,  2021;  see  also  Brout  et  al.,  2018,  for  a  review).  Recently,  Rosenthal  et  al.  (2022) investigated the relationship between misophonia and psychiatric disorders in the DSM5. They found that among the disorders that were correlated with misophonia, the most significant  predictors  of  misophonia  severity  were  borderline  personality  disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and panic disorder.

Research has shown that misophonia manifests itself on a physiological, neurophysiological, and neurobiological basis. Both the subjective judgment of aversiveness and the  physiological  measure  of  skin  conductance  response  (SCR)  increase  when  people with  misophonia  are  presented  with  triggers  (Edelstein  et  al.,  2013).  Furthermore,  an EEG study showed that the N1-component, which is related to auditory attention and sound detection, was diminished for misophonics in response to unexpected (oddball) sounds compared to control participants (Schröder et al., 2014). Furthermore, an fMRI study found that people with misophonia show increased response in the anterior insular cortex (AIC) in response to misophonic sounds, compared to control participants and other  unpleasant  or  neutral  sounds  (Kumar  et  al.,  2017).  They  also  show  increased connectivity between the AIC and the default mode network (DMN): the AIC is related to the salience that people attribute to environmental stimuli (Seeley et al., 2007) as well as visceral emotions (Craig, 2009), such as the processing of disgusting stimuli (see, for instance, Kober et al., 2008); the DMN is related to memory recall and internal thoughts (Raichle et al., 2001). Consequently, the increased AIC reactivity may be causing intense visceral emotions, and the AIC-DMN connectivity may be interpreted as an increased salience  attributed  to  environmental  sounds  due  to  associative  learning  and  memory. Both AIC and DMN function may potentially be linked to the identification of the source of the sound, an aspect we address in our study.

Although  it  has  been  suggested  that  misophonia  is  mainly  an  auditory  disorder that affects auditory processing in the early stages (Schröder et al., 2014), misophonics can  also  be  triggered  by  visual  cues  (Brout  et  al.,  2018).  Samermit  et  al.  (2022) examined  whether  misophonic  responses  can  be  modulated  by  visual  cues.  Using a  sound-swapped  video  database,  they  found  that  when  trigger  sounds  were  paired with 'positive attributable video sources,' they were rated as significantly less unpleasant  than  when  they  were  paired  with  the  original  video  sources.  During  interviews that  Edelstein  et  al.  (2013)  conducted  with  misophonics,  some  people  reported  that they  react  less  severely  or  not  at  all  when  their  trigger  sounds  are  produced  by animals  or  infants.  Moreover,  they  report  especially  aversive  responses  to  trigger sounds produced by family and friends, but less aversive responses when the sounds are  produced  by  strangers  or  even  themselves,  further  suggesting  a  role  of  sound source  identification.  Indeed,  a  later  study  by  Edelstein  et  al.  (2020)  found  that

incorrect  identification  or  incorrect  text  descriptions  accompanying  trigger  sounds changed the subjective aversiveness of those sounds. This indicates that misophonia is not  a  purely  auditory  processing  disorder  but  is  also  influenced  by  a  top-down process  of  source  identification.  More  recently,  Heller  and  Smith  (2022)  found  that the  identification  of  spectrally  degraded  sounds  had  an  effect  on  participants'  pleasantness ratings of everyday sounds. This study did not include exclusively misophonic  participants,  although  a  few  common  misophonic  triggers  were  used.  A  similar effect  of  spectral  degradation  could  potentially  be  found  on  the  experienced  (un) pleasantness  of  trigger  sounds  in  a  strictly  misophonic  population  sample  as  was investigated  in  the  current  study.

We consider both the effects of top-down identification, as well as bottom-up auditory attention in terms of spectral and temporal acoustic information. We present an experiment that exclusively addressed misophonic participants. First, we investigate the importance of spectral and temporal acoustic information in triggering misophonia. We test whether and the extent to which spectral and temporal modifications of trigger sounds add  to  or  attenuate  the  feelings  of  aversiveness.  We  do  not  have  a  hypothesis  as  to whether the spectral or the temporal information of sound events is more important in triggering misophonia. We also test whether action identification (e.g., chewing, slurping, typing, etc.) of original recorded sounds and spectral or temporal modifications of those sounds affects the severity of misophonic response. Our main hypothesis concerns only misophonic trigger sounds: we hypothesize that incorrect identification will attenuate the severity of aversive responses to these sounds.

## Methods

## Participants

Participants  were  recruited  online  through  misophonia  support  groups  on  Facebook. They filled out a pre-screening questionnaire (Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire; MAQ, see materials) and were selected to complete the main experiment if their score classified them to have at least moderate misophonia. The pre-screening questionnaire was  completed  by  33  participants,  of  which  three  were  rejected  because  of  low  MAQ scores. From the 30 invited participants, only 18 (16 female) with an average age of 36.1 years ( SD = 14.1; range: 19-61) were willing to proceed and completed the main experiment.  Their  average  MAQ  score  was  44.83  out  of  63  ( SD = 10.5),  which  would  be classified  as  severe  misophonia.  Participants  were  also  instructed  to  complete  the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale questionnaire (A-MISO-S; see Materials )  at  the  end  of the experiment. Their average A-MISO-S score was 15.44 out of 24 ( SD = 2.66), which again classifies them as severe misophonics.

Eight  participants  resided  in  the  United  States;  two  each  were  from  Canada,  the United  Kingdom,  the  Netherlands,  and  Belgium;  followed  by  one  participant  from Germany and one from South Africa. Three participants reported auditory disorders of tinnitus and hyperacusis. Seven participants reported comorbid psychological disorders of  anxiety,  obsessive compulsive disorder, and depression. It is also worth noting that 50%  of  the  participants  reported  that  they  have  experienced  Autonomous  Sensory

## Materials

## Questionnaires

Participants filled out the Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ; Dozier, 2015) as a pre-screening test. It contains 21 items about the negative impact of misophonia on one's activities, thoughts, and feelings, which are rated on a Likert-scale from 0 (not at all) to  3  (almost  all  the  time).  Scores  can  range  from  0  to  63.  Johnson  (2014,  as  cited  by Dozier, 2015) classified a score of 0-21 as mild, 22-42 as moderate, and 43-63 as severe misophonia. Consequently, all participants that scored 22 or higher on the MAQ were invited to participate in the main experiment. Additionally, in the pre-screening experiment we asked participants the types of sounds they are usually triggered by. They could tick the boxes of 'Eating or drinking sounds (e.g., eating an apple),' 'Respiratory sounds (e.g.,  sniffling),'  'Tapping  sounds  (e.g.,  typing),'  'Material  sounds  (e.g.,  plastic),'  or 'Other' with the option to fill in other triggers. This was to ensure that the participants were triggered by the types of sounds that we included in the experiment, and not merely by a very specific sound that was not included.

After the listening task of the main experiment, participants filled out demographic questions  concerning  their  age,  country  of  residence,  gender  identity,  biological  sex, hearing issues, and comorbid psychological disorders. We asked them whether the action sounds included in the experiment were habitually triggering for them and also triggered them  in  the  experiment  to  further  confirm  that  our  stimuli  caused  a  misophonic response. Additionally, we asked the participants from what age their misophonia started and  whether  any  of  their  family  members  suffered  from  misophonia.  Finally,  we described  the  phenomenon of ASMR, asked participants if they had ever experienced the phenomenon, and to describe which, if any, sounds elicited the response.

In  addition  to  the  pre-screening  MAQ,  in  the  post-experiment  survey  participants filled out the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S; Schröder et al., 2013) and the Misophonia  Coping  Responses  questionnaire  (MCR;  Dozier,  2015).  We  wanted  to include  several  misophonia  scales,  as  there  are  no  validated  misophonia  assessment questionnaires,  and  this  allowed  us  to  corroborate  our  findings  on  the  severity  of misophonia in our participant pool. The A-MISO-S measures the severity of misophonia symptoms with six items that are rated on a multiple-choice scale that scores zero to four. Total  scores  can  range  from  zero  to  24,  with  a  score  between  0-4  considered  as subclinical misophonia, 5-9 as mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 severe, and 20-24 extreme severity of misophonia symptoms. The MCR measures the coping mechanisms of people with misophonia when they are confronted with trigger sounds. It contains 22 items that are rated on the same scales as the MAQ. There are no classifications available for the MCR, but scores can range from zero to 66.

## Stimuli

In total, three stimulus sets were used. The first set consisted of recorded sounds that were  either  common  misophonic  triggers  or  neutral  sounds  that  are  not  expected  to trigger misophonia. Table 1 lists all the stimuli (organized in categories of trigger and

neutral sounds) along with their respective action labels that describe the physical action that produced the sound. The sounds were recorded in the acoustically treated soundisolation  labs  of  the  Centre  for  Interdisciplinary  Research  in  Music  Media  and Technology (CIRMMT). Two microphones were placed in close and distant positions (approximately  12  in  and  30  in,  respectively)  from  the  sound  sources  leading  to  two different recording sets. After listening to comparisons between the two recording sets, we decided to use only the distant recordings, because they sounded more natural with respect  to  everyday  listening  conditions.  For  instance,  in  some  cases  the  close-miked recordings sounded as if someone was chewing right inside one's ears. The recording equipment consisted of two Neumann U87 condenser microphones, which were interfaced  through  an  RME  Audio  Fireface  UFX.  The  outputs  of  each  microphone  were monitored by two people through two Sennheiser HD280 headphones.

The second stimulus  set  was  generated  by  applying  temporal  modifications  on  the unmodified (i.e.,  as  recorded)  stimulus  set.  Temporal  modifications  were  achieved  by segmenting the audio signal into short overlapping frames of 25 ms and shuffling them over  a  radius  of  250 ms.  The  amount  of  overlap  was  set  to  50%  and  the  frames  were Hann-windowed. The shuffling was performed by a random permutation of the frames (within  the  given  radius)  without  replacement.  The  permutation  was  conditioned  by a  Gaussian probability distribution which controls the difference between the original and  final  frame  positions  (Ellis,  2010).  This  minimizes  possible  audible  artifacts  that would  result  from  large  displacements  from  the  original  frame  positions  (e.g.,  if a  uniform  probability  distribution  was  used  instead).  The  standard  deviation  of  the distribution  was  empirically  set  to  16  (frame  indices)  after  informal  listening  tests

conducted among the authors. The resynthesis was performed by overlap-add. Overall, this  process  preserved  the  short-term  average  spectrum  (over  the  250-ms  radius)  but distorted the global amplitude envelope (Figure 1).

The  third  stimulus  set  was  generated  by  applying  spectral  modifications  on  the unmodified stimulus set. Spectral modifications were achieved through spectral whitening while preserving the global amplitude envelope. This was done by first estimating the spectral  envelope  of  the  input  signal  on  20-ms  frames  through  a  13 th -order  Linear Predictive  Coding  (LPC)  model.  The  signal  was  resynthesized  by  feeding  white  noise (instead  of  the  original  excitation  signal)  into  the  filter's  structure  and  the  amplitude envelope was controlled by the gain of the filter. The code for analyzing and resynthesizing the signal was adopted from Slaney's Auditory Toolbox (Slaney, 1998). Overall, this process had the effect of removing the spectral fine structure of the input signal through whitening while preserving its global amplitude envelope (within 20-ms frames) through the time-varying gain of the filter (Figure 1).

All stimuli (including the unmodified stimulus set) had a duration of 10 s and were high-pass filtered with an 80-Hz cutoff frequency to reduce audible artifacts caused by the modification processes. The last processing stage was loudness normalization, which was implemented according to the algorithm of Moore et al.  (1997).  All stimuli  were processed and synthesized in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA).

## Procedure

The pre-screening and main experiment were executed online, hosted on secure servers at  McGill  University.  Before  the  experiment,  participants  gave  informed  consent.  As mentioned above,  only  participants  with  a  MAQ  score  of  at  least  22  were  selected  to proceed to the main experiment. The experimental instructions required participants to

have normal hearing thresholds; use a laptop or desktop computer; use headphones or earphones, be inside a quiet room, and not currently be taking medical or recreational drugs  that  affect  wakefulness  and  vigilance.  Before  the  main  trials,  participants  were asked  to  adjust  the  volume  of  their  headphones/earphones  to  a  comfortable  listening level according to a reference sound sample. They were further instructed to not change this level throughout the experiment.

In  each  trial,  participants  were  first  presented  with  a  stimulus  and  then  were asked  to  rate  with  a  slider  'How  effectively  does  this  sound  trigger  misophonia  for you?' The rating scale was a continuous 9-point analogical-categorical scale (Weber, 1991) and the two extremes were labeled as 'Not effectively' and 'Very effectively'. Afterwards,  they  were  asked  to  'Identify  the  action  that  produced  the  sound' through  a  drop-down  menu  that  displayed  all  the  action  labels  listed  in  Table  1. Identification  was  deemed correct whenever  the  participant's  answer  matched  the 'Action Label' of the respective 'Stimulus Name,' as shown in Table 1. No feedback was  provided  on  the  correctness  of  participants'  responses.  Participants  were allowed  to  play  back  each  stimulus  as  many  times  as  they  wished  prior  to  making their  judgments.  The  two  tasks  were  presented  in  consecutive  screens  and  participants were not able to go back from the identifying task to the rating task (i.e., they could  not  adjust  their  rating  after  identifying  the  action).

The presentation order of each stimulus was randomized across all stimulus categories and for each participant. At the end of the experimental session, participants were asked to  fill  in  the  post-experimental  survey  as  described in  the Materials section. The total duration of the experiment was approximately 1 hour.

## Data Analysis

All  statistical  analyses  were  conducted  in  R  version  4.2.1  (www.r-project.org).  For  the Shapiro-Wilk test we used the shapiro_test function from the rstatix library (Kassambara, 2023)  on  the  aversiveness  ratings  grouped  by  stimulus  category,  modification,  and identification.  For  the  non-parametric  Wilcoxon  signed-rank  test,  we  used  the  inbuilt wilcox.test function, and the wilcox_effectsize from the rstatix library to test the r effect size. The linear mixed model (LMM) was implemented using the lmer function with the bobyqa optimizer from the lmerTest package (Kuznetsova et al., 2020). Eta-squared is not a reliable statistic for evaluating a local effect size (i.e., a particular main effect) in mixedeffects  models  because  of  the  presence  of  random  effects  (and  therefore  shared/partitioned variance). Post-hoc analyses were done with the emmeans function to calculate the estimated  means,  and  the eff_size function  to  calculate  the  Cohen's d ,  both  from  the emmeans package (Lenth et al., 2022). In the absence of appropriate effect size measures for LMMs, Cohen's d in the post-hoc contrasts should give a sufficient idea of effect sizes. For  the  independent  factorial  ANOVA,  we  used  the  inbuilt aov function,  and  the partial_eta_squared function  from  the rstatix library  to  calculate  the η p 2 effect  size. Planned contrasts were defined with the inbuilt contrasts function. With respect to the sound modification effect, the first contrast compared the unmodified sounds to both the spectrally  and  temporally  modified  sounds.  Then,  a  second  contrast  compared  the spectrally and temporally modified sounds to each other. Effect sizes are reported only for statistically significant results ( p ≤0.05).

## Results

Due  to  the  relatively  small  number  of  participants,  we  investigated  the  normality distribution of the variable combinations in order to determine the appropriate statistical methods. Shapiro-Wilk tests showed that the rating distributions for all combinations of stimulus category (i.e., misophonic or neutral stimulus), modification (i.e., unmodified, spectral, or temporal), and identification (i.e., correct or incorrect) showed evidence of non-normality  (all p &lt; .01).  For  this  reason,  and  due  to  the  unbalanced  design  of  the experiment (i.e., number of correct versus incorrect identification responses), we used linear mixed modeling (LMM) to predict the aversiveness ratings of misophonic triggers, and to test for the main and interaction effects of modification type and identification.

Since our main hypothesis concerns only (misophonic) trigger sounds, the effectiveness of trigger manipulation on the aversiveness ratings of the unmodified stimulus set was studied first (Figure 2). The non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that the  group  of  sounds  which were categorized a priori as  trigger  sounds  (Table  1)  were indeed  rated  significantly  higher  (i.e.,  as  more  aversive; M = 5.04, SD = 3.30)  than  the neutral sounds ( M = 2.20, SD = 2.40; Z = -18.77, p &lt; .0001, r = .43). Therefore, the following analysis concerns only the groups of trigger sounds within each stimulus set.

After experimenting with different LMM effect structures, we selected the model that performed  the  best  in  terms  of  the  Akaike  Information  Criterion  (AIC),  Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and log likelihood. 1 The employed model had the following structure: the aversiveness ratings of the misophonic stimuli were set as the dependent variable;  the  fixed  effects  consisted  of  modification  type  and identification  correctness (the latter coded as a binary variable per participant and per stimulus), along with their

interaction;  random  intercepts  were  used  per  participant,  and  per  stimulus;  random slopes were used for both modification type and identification per participant.

We conducted Type III Wald F-tests to analyze the main and interaction effects of the LMM. The main effects of modification type, F (2, 51.85) = 11.04, p = .0001, and identification, F (1, 19.87) = 9.69, p = &lt; .006, were found to be significant. The interaction effect between these two variables was marginally significant, F (2, 641.88) = 2.96, p = .053. With respect  to  modification  type,  Bonferroni-corrected  post-hoc  comparisons  showed  that although  there  was  no  significant  difference  between  the  aversiveness  ratings  of  the unmodified  stimuli  (estimated M = 6.01, SE = 0.60)  and  temporally  modified  stimuli (estimated M = 5.32, SE = 0.60),  the  spectrally  modified  stimuli  (estimated M = 3.40, SE = 0.53) were  rated  as significantly less aversive than  both  the  unmodified, t (48.5) = 4.61, p = .0001,  Cohen's d = 1.62  (hereafter  reported  as d ),  and  temporally modified stimuli, t (39.9) = -3.61, p = .003, d = -1.19. With respect to the identification effect, the correctly identified stimuli (estimated M = 5.64, SE = 0.53) were overall rated as  significantly  more  aversive, t (20.1) = 3.11, p = .006, d = 0.96,  than  the  incorrectly identified stimuli (estimated M = 4.18, SE = 0.56).

Regarding the interaction between modification type and identification (correct vs. incorrect), the identification effect (i.e., the differences in aversiveness ratings between correctly  and  incorrectly  identified  stimuli)  per  modification  type  was  significant  for both  the  spectral  and  temporal  modifications, t (28.6) = 3.96, p = .0004, d = 1.26;  and t (26.4) = 2.18, p = .004, d = 0.68, respectively. However, for the unmodified stimuli, the identification effect was marginally significant,  (62) = 1.97, t p = .05, d = 0.77. As can also be inferred from Figure 3, the identification effect was largest for the spectrally modified stimuli, followed by the unmodified and temporally modified stimuli. However, only the difference in identification effect between the spectral and temporal modifications was found to be marginally significant ( (638) = 2.38, t p = .05, d = 1.87), whereas the rest were insignificant ( p &gt; .3).

As  a  more  general  remark,  we  investigated  the  stimuli's  proportion  of  correct identification,  i.e.,  the  proportion  of  participants  that  correctly  identified  each stimulus.  An  independent  factorial  ANOVA  with  the  proportion  correct  identification  as  dependent  variable  and  stimulus  category  (misophonic/neutral)  and modification  as  independent  variables  showed  that  the  difference  in  proportion correct  identification  between  the  misophonic  and  neutral  stimulus  sets  (Figure  4) was  not  significant, F (1, 72) = 1.89, p = .17.  However,  there  was  an  effect  of modification type, F (2,  72) = 20.71, p &lt; .0001, η p 2 = .37,  where  the  planned  contrasts showed  that  proportion  correct  identification  was  higher  for  the  unmodified sounds  compared  to  both  the  spectral  and  temporal  modifications, t (72) = -5.95, p &lt; .0001, d = -1.43.  The  proportion  correct  identification  was  also  slightly  higher for  the  temporal  than  the  spectral  modifications, t (72) = -2.46, p =.02, d = -0.68. There  was  no  significant  interaction  between  the  stimulus  category  and  modification, F (2,  72) = 1.06, p = .35.

## Discussion

The main purpose of this experiment was to test whether action identification plays a role in  evoking  misophonic responses and the extent to which these relate to spectral and temporal  stimulus  information.  To  this  end,  we  modified  recorded  stimuli  that  are generally  considered  to  be  triggers  while  aiming  to  preserve  either  their  spectral  or temporal similarities to the recorded sounds.

Post-hoc tests related to modification type show that temporal modifications of 25-ms frames within a 250-ms radius did not reduce aversiveness responses compared to the unmodified  stimuli.  It  can  therefore  be  concluded  that  spectral  information  averaged

over 250 ms is important in triggering misophonia, and that the random temporal microfluctuations  over  25-ms  frames  (or  longer)  did  not  statistically  affect  the  misophonic responses compared to the unmodified stimuli. In addition, given that the identification effect on temporally modified stimuli was significant (although weak) and that there was a  relatively  high  proportion  of  correct  identification  of  temporally  modified  trigger sounds (65.8%; Figure 4), it can be concluded that both spectral information and action identification contributed to high aversiveness ratings.

This  is  further  supported  by  the  results  obtained  from  spectral  modifications. Preserving the temporal information, and therefore any repetitive patterns of the unmodified  stimuli  over  20-ms  frames  while  whitening  the  signal,  significantly  reduced  the aversiveness ratings to a level similar to the neutral stimulus sets (Figure 2). This leads again to the conclusion that spectral information is more important than the temporal organization of amplitude micro-fluctuations in triggering misophonia. The identification  effect  of  this  modification  type  was  the  largest,  although  percent  correct  action identification was relatively poor (34.6%; Figure 4). Nonetheless, correct identification of these stimuli significantly increased the aversiveness ratings (Figure 3). In general, these results are also similar to those obtained by Heller and Smith (2022) according to which spectral  degradations  made  the  sounds  more  neutral  across  their  'Positive'  and 'Negative' valence groups of sounds. The authors attributed this effect to the high rate of  misidentification  and  uncertainty  about  the  sounds'  causal  properties  (e.g.,  with respect  to  actions,  such  as  impact  sounds,  or  to  the  geometric/material  properties  of the object).

Although we acknowledge that the interaction effects between modification type and identification were marginally significant ( p = .05), we believe that the reported results offer additional insights and complete the picture of the present analysis. The marginally significant p -value of the interaction effect is probably due to the relatively small number of participants and the high variance of ratings, especially with respect to the incorrect identifications of the unmodified stimulus set (Figure 3). The unmodified stimulus set can be thought of as a control set in which action identification should not play a role at all. In fact, almost all participants were able to correctly identify the action labels of the unmodified stimuli (92.7% correct identification of trigger sounds, 82.1% correct identification of neutral sounds; Figure 4). We attribute the high variance of the aversiveness ratings  of  the  unmodified  stimulus  set  (see  right  panel  of  Figure  3)  to  systematic misidentification:  for  instance,  a  participant  may  have  consistently  misidentified a  stimulus as 'Chewing' whereas the experimenters had labeled it as 'Slurping,' as in the 'Noodles' stimulus label (Table 1). Nonetheless, the weak p -value of .05 and the small number of participants due to the difficulty of recruiting moderate to severe misophonic participants notwithstanding, the overall conclusion of the present analysis is that both action  identification  and  spectral  information  play  an  important  role  in  triggering misophonia.

The  results  are  consistent  with  our  initial  hypothesis  regarding  action  (or  source) identification and support the findings reported by Edelstein et al. (2020) according to which incorrect identification of trigger sounds changed the subjective aversiveness of those sounds. The spectrally modified sounds reduced the misophonic responses, which suggests  that  this  type  of  modification  acted  as  a  'neutralizer'  for  the  misophonic stimulus set (Figure 2). Similar results were reported by Heller and Smith (2022) with

respect to pleasantness ratings of everyday sounds. On a final note, we do not claim that temporal information is unrelated to action identification. The present analysis concerns only  the  aforementioned  type  of  temporal  modification  on  misophonic  sounds. Examining the importance of individual amplitude and frequency modulation rates is currently under investigation.
