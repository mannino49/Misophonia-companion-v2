Misophonia is a disorder generally characterised by a decreased tolerance to everyday 
sounds. Although research is increasing in misophonia, a cross-cultural validation of a 
psychometric tool for measuring misophonia has not been evaluated. This study 
investigated the validity of the S-Five multidimensional model of the misophonic experience 
in a sample of Chinese participants. The S-Five was translated in a forward-backward 
method to Mandarin to establish a satisfactory translation. The translation was also 
independently back translated to English, with no significant differences when compared 
to the original S-Five. Through exploratory factor analysis, using responses from 256 
Chinese individuals, the five dimensions (internalising appraisals, externalising appraisals, 
perceived threat and avoidance behaviour, outbursts, and impact on functioning) were 
replicated, indicating the cross-cultural uniformity of the experience of misophonia as 
captured by the S-Five. That is, current results point to the stability of the manifestation 
of misophonia across cultures, seen here for the first time in the literature. By design, the 
S-Five items were developed to reflect sound sensitivities in a manner that is not specific 
or matching to individuals of a certain age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, socio-economic 
status, and educational level. Testimonial to this fact is not only the replication of the five 
factors, but also the replication of the evidence towards satisfactory psychometric 
properties (reliability and validity) of the scale. Based on the results of this study, the S-Five 
is a psychometrically robust tool to be used within the Chinese population.

INTRODUCTION
Misophonia is characterised by decreased tolerance to everyday 
sounds ( Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2001 ) and, by consensus, is 
recognised as a disorder ( Swedo et  al., 2021 ). Trigger sounds 
have been identified to broadly cluster into the three groups of 
eating sounds, nose/throat sounds and environmental sounds 
(Vitoratou et al., 2021a ), with decreased sound tolerance to eating 
sounds appearing to be  at the centre of the disorder ( Jager et  al., 
2020 ; Swedo et  al., 2021 ; Vitoratou et  al., 2021a ). Reactions and 
responses to sounds experienced in misophonia are varied and 
include emotional, physiological, and behavioural responses. It 
has been commonly reported that primary feelings such as anger 
and disgust are experienced ( Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Schröder et al., 
2013 ; Kumar et  al., 2017 ; Jager et  al., 2020 ), alongside unpleasant 
physiological changes, including an increased heart rate, muscle 
tension, pain and sweating ( Edelstein et  al., 2013 ; Johnson et  al., 
2013 ). Misophonia can have a significant impact on a person’s 
social and occupational functioning ( Schröder et  al., 2013 ; Rouw 
and Erfanian, 2018 ). Avoidance behaviours, social withdrawal 
(Johnson et al., 2013 ; Schneider and Arch, 2015 ; Hocaoglu, 2018 ; 
Muller et  al., 2018 ; Singer, 2018 ; Alekri and Al Saif, 2019 ) and, 
for some, aggression ( Reid et  al., 2016 ; Hocaoglu, 2018 ; Alekri 
and Al Saif, 2019 ; Jager et  al., 2020 ) are also frequently reported.
There is currently limited literature available on misophonia 
outside of western cultures. Two studies have evaluated the 
symptoms and clinical correlates of misophonia within Asian 
cultures. One study investigated the disorder within Chinese 
undergraduate students ( Zhou et  al., 2017 ) and another within 
Singaporean psychiatric patients ( Quek et al., 2018 ). Zhou et al. 
(2017)  found that 6% of respondents reported clinically significant 
levels of misophonia, with 17% endorsing a sensitivity (selecting 
“often” or “always” on the rating scale) to eating sounds, 18% 
to nasal sounds and 13% to environmental sounds. This study 
used the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et  al., 2014 ), 
which has not undergone a full psychometric analysis. The 
MQ contains two factors: sensitivity to sounds compared to 
other people, as well as emotional and behavioural responses 
to those sounds. It does not capture some of the other aspects 
of misophonia reported in the literature, such as loss of control 
(Jager et al., 2020 ) and appraisals of oneself ( Rouw and Erfanian, 
2018 ) and of others ( Edelstein et  al., 2013 ).
Another questionnaire, MisoQuest ( Siepsiak et  al., 2020 ), 
was developed to assess the presence or absence of misophonia, 
based on the misophonia diagnostic criteria proposed by 
Schröder et  al. (2013) . It contains 14 items and measures 
misophonia from reactions to specific sounds, occurrence of 
emotions, controlling emotional reactions, attitudes toward 
reactions, avoidance, and daily dysfunction. MisoQuest has 
shown satisfactory psychometric properties but is not designed 
to capture severity of misophonic traits. The Duke Misophonia 
Questionnaire (DMQ; Rosenthal et  al., 2021 ) was developed 
as a tool for assessing the complexities in symptom severity, 
impairment to functioning and coping mechanisms in 
misophonia. Composite scores can be  calculated separately for 
symptoms and coping, rather than an overall score for misophonia 
severity, drawn from all subscale scores.The S-Five tool, for measuring the latent trait of misophonia 
severity, was developed in large study ( n = 828) initiated in 
English-speaking individuals who identify with the condition 
(Vitoratou et  al., 2021b ). Four waves of sampling, more than 
80 initial items and several thousand of responses, concluded 
with a 25-item scale which reflects five dimensions of the 
misophonic experience, with excellent psychometric properties. 
The five factors that emerged were: emotional threat (sense 
of feeling trapped or helpless if unable to get away from sounds), 
internalising appraisals (tendency to see oneself as a bad or 
angry person for reacting to sounds) externalising appraisals 
(tendency to blame the person for making the sound), outbursts 
(fear of having, or actually displaying, aggressive outburst) and 
impact (current and future limitations in life from misophonia). 
The factor structure was subsequently replicated in a large 
sample ( n = 772), representative of the UK population ( Vitoratou 
et al., 2022 ). Individuals who identified with having misophonia 
had higher mean scores for threat factor than other factors 
(Vitoratou et al., 2021b ). Meanwhile, in the general population, 
externalising appraisals was the factor most highly endorsed 
(Vitoratou et  al., 2022 ). Within both populations, the S-Five 
subscales had an alpha of a least 0.83 ( Vitoratou et  al., 2021b , 
2022 ). In both studies, misophonia severity was associated with 
increased symptoms of depression and anxiety.
The S-Five has a supplementary trigger checklist, capturing 
the nature and intensity of the emotional response to sounds 
(Vitoratou et al., 2021b , 2022 ), in a flexible format which allows 
modifications of the trigger sounds list and the response types, 
to accommodate advances made in the literature of misophonia 
research. Loud eating was the sound rated with the highest 
intensity of negative reaction in both the UK general population 
(Vitoratou et  al., 2022 ) and by individuals identifying with 
having the condition ( Vitoratou et  al., 2021b ).
The current study aimed to evaluate the five-factor model 
of the experience of misophonia in a non-clinical Chinese 
sample using the S-Five translated into Mandarin. We  aimed 
to test the cross-cultural robustness of the five dimensions of 
the S-Five, evaluate the measurement invariance with regards 
to age and gender, examine the reliability (consistency and 
stability) and concurrent validity. We hypothesised that symptoms 
of depression and anxiety would be  positively associated with 
symptoms of misophonia. With respect to trigger sounds, 
we  hypothesised that loud chewing would be  rated as causing 
the most intense negative reaction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Recruitment
Inclusion criteria followed being aged 18 years and over and 
fluent in Mandarin. Exclusion criteria were the presence of a 
severe learning or intellectual disability, as per self-disclosure 
of such a disability. A participants’ information sheet was 
available at the beginning of the survey and consent was granted 
before completing the questionnaires online (ethics approval 
reference RESCM-19/20–11,826).

Vitoratou et al. S-Five Model in MandarinFrontiers in Psychology  | www.frontiersin.org  3 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 879881Recruitment was done using a snowball sampling technique 
via social media in China (Wechat Moment, Weibo & Douban), 
as well as via Twitter, Reddit, and the Fortnightly Recruitment 
Circular at King’s College London. Data collection took part 
between January and September 2021, including the retest 
study. Participants who finished the S-Five 25-item measurement 
scale were offered a chance to win an e-voucher at the end 
of the survey.
Retest data were collected between two and four weeks of 
an individual’s first assessment. The opportunity to take part 
in the retest study was presented at the end of the survey, to 
which participants were directed to a separate survey to enter 
their email addresses, to maintain anonymity. A total of 48 
participants received the test–retest survey link via email and 
those that completed the survey were offered the chance to 
win an e-voucher again.
The e-voucher, in both surveys, was for an online video 
membership worth ¥130 (~£15), and SPSS random selection 
was used for establishing those who won. Those who partially 
completed the surveys were not offered the chance to win the 
e-voucher.
Measures
The online survey included demographic questions, such as 
age, gender, ethnicity, education level, occupation, country of 
birth, and countries of residence in both past and present. 
The survey also asked whether the individual had any formal 
diagnoses on mental health conditions (including mood, anxiety, 
psychotic, personality, trauma, eating and substance abuse 
disorders), audiological conditions (e.g., tinnitus) and 
neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., autism). Participants were 
asked whether they were aware of the term misophonia and 
whether they identified as having misophonia. Attention check 
questions have been used throughout the survey to ensure 
the quality of responses (e.g., Please slide the bar to option 
‘2’ for us to ensure the validity of the responses). Responses 
which did not meet the requirement of the attention check 
questions or failed to respond to more than 3 of the 25 S-Five 
items were removed to ensure engagement with the study 
(n = 60). The following self-report questionnaires were 
also included.
Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Scale
The Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Scale (S-Five) is a 
25-item measurement scale which assess the severity of 
misophonia ( Vitoratou et  al., 2021b ). Each item is rated on 
an 11-point scale from 0 (not at all true) to 10 (completely 
true). The items are presented in the appendix in both English 
and Mandarin.
The S-Five trigger checklist (S-Five-T; see appendix for the 
English and Mandarin versions) was designed to capture the 
nature and intensity of a range of trigger sounds. The S-Five-T 
is flexible by design, in that it allows for adjustment of the 
number of triggers used. The current study used the 37 trigger 
sounds presented in the original validation study for the S-Five 
(Vitoratou et  al., 2021b ). The original options for emotional reactions were also used (no feeling, irritation, distress, disgust, 
anger, panic, other feeling: negative, and other feeling: positive). 
Respondents select their main emotional reaction to each trigger 
item and then rate the intensity (henceforth trigger intensity) 
of that reaction, from 0 (does not bother me at all) to 10 
(unbearable/causes suffering). Four indices can be  computed: 
(1) the trigger count (TC), which is the total number of triggers 
endorsed (i.e., where a negative reaction is selected) by a 
respondent (takes values from 0 to 37  in the current list), (2) 
the reaction count (RC), the number of times each particular 
reaction type is endorsed, counted across triggers in a single 
respondent (takes values from 0 to 37  in the current list), (3) 
the frequency/intensity of reactions score (FIRS) is the total 
value of the intensity items of all endorsed triggers (takes 
values from 0 to 370  in the current list), and (4) the relative 
intensity of reactions score (RIRS) which gives an estimate of 
the intensity of reactions to triggers, relative to the number 
of triggers reported (takes values from 0 to 100  in the current 
list). It is computed by dividing the FIRS index by the TC 
index. The S-Five and S-Five-T were translated by the research 
team for use in the present study.
Amsterdam Misophonia Scale
The Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S) is a 6-item 
measure of misophonia adapted from a clinician-rated tool, 
the Y ale-Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (YBOCS; Goodman 
et  al., 1989 ; Schröder et  al., 2013 ). Although it was designed 
as a clinician-rated tool, for the purposes of this study 
we  administered it as a self-report measurement tool. The 
questions ask about misophonia in relation to time occupied, 
impact on functioning, level of distress, resistance of sounds, 
perceived control, and avoidance behaviour. The A-MISO-S, 
translated by the research team, had an alpha of 0.79 and an 
omega of 0.81  in this study.
Misophonia Questionnaire
The Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ) is a three-part self-report 
measure for misophonia ( Wu et  al., 2014 ). The Misophonia 
Symptoms Scale (MSYS; α = 0.70 and ω = 0.90) asks respondents 
to compare their sensitivity to specific triggers with others’ 
responses and the Misophonia Emotions and Behaviours Scale 
(MEBS; α = 0.89 and ω = 0.90) measures an individual’s responses 
to trigger sounds. The two subscales are combined to create 
the MQ total score. The Misophonia Severity Scale is a single 
item question, adapted from the NIMH Global Obsessive–
Compulsive Scale (NIMH GOCS; Murphy et  al., 1982 ), asking 
individuals to rate the severity of their sound sensitivity on 
a scale from 1 (minimal) to 15 (very severe), with a score 
greater than or equal to 7 said to indicate clinically significant 
symptoms. The MQ was translated by the research team for 
use in this study.
Patient Health Questionnaire-9
The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to 
measure symptoms of depression ( Kroenke et  al., 2001 ). Items 
are rated on a 4-point ordinal scale, with a total score range

Vitoratou et al. S-Five Model in MandarinFrontiers in Psychology  | www.frontiersin.org  4 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 879881of 0 to 27. We used a Mandarin version that has been validated 
in Chinese populations ( Y eung et  al., 2008 ). The reliability 
coefficients of PHQ-9 were α = 0.89 and ω = 0.89.
General Anxiety Disorder-7
The General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) measures severity 
of anxiety symptoms ( Spitzer et  al., 2006 ). Each item is rated 
on a 4-point ordinal scale, with a total score ranging from 0 
to 21. We  used a Mandarin version that has been validated 
within Chinese populations ( He et  al., 2010 ). In this study, 
the GAD-7 had an α of 0.91 and ω of 0.92.
Translation
The S-Five, developed in English, was translated into Mandarin 
for use in the Chinese population and then back-translated into 
English. Two authors (JW and QW), fluent in English and 
Mandarin, separately translated the S-Five, and the two versions 
were compared and revised accordingly. The co-adjusted version 
was translated back to English by a native Mandarin speaker, 
fluent in English. The back-translated version of the S-Five was 
compared to the original English version of the S-Five and a 
second co-adjusted version was produced. This version was again 
translated to English by the native Mandarin speaker. There were 
no significant differences between the final version of the translated 
S-Five and the original S-Five. Using the same method, the 
A-MISO-S and the MQ were translated to Mandarin for use in 
this study (please contact first author for the translated versions).
Statistical Analysis
The latent structure of the S-Five was evaluated using exploratory 
factor analysis (EFA). The suitability of the data for use in 
factor analysis was first assessed using the anti-image correlations 
and the corresponding Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test for 
sampling adequacy ( Kaiser, 1960 ; Kaiser and Rice, 1974 ) and 
Bartlett (1951)  test of sphericity.
The factor extraction method implemented was maximum 
likelihood with robust standard errors in Mplus (MLR; Muthen 
and Muthén, 1998 ) due to skewness in the data, and the factors 
were allowed to correlate using the Oblimin rotation. Two criteria, 
based upon eigenvalues, were followed for identifying the number 
of factors to retain. First, the Guttman-Kaiser criterion ( Guttman, 
1954 ; Kaiser, 1960 ) suggests retaining about as many factors as 
the number of eigenvalues above 1 (factor variances) in the sample 
covariance matrix. Second, the parallel analysis criterion ( Horn, 
1965 ) compares the number of sample eigenvalues to those 
produced by 1,000 set of randomly simulated data, with the 
same number of observations and number of factors. The number 
of factors to retain is identified by the number of sample eigenvalues 
larger than the simulated data eigenvalues. Parallel analysis was 
carried out in Mplus under MLR estimator ( Muthen and Muthén, 
1998 ), the parallel analysis average eigenvalues and 95th percentile 
parallel analysis eigenvalues. The eigenvalues computed using the 
sample correlation matrix and the parallel analysis simulated data 
are presented graphically using Cattell (1966)  scree plot.
Absolute and relative goodness of fit indices were used to 
evaluate the fit of the EFA suggested models. The indices reported and the criteria followed were the relative chi-square (relative 
𝜒2: values close to 2 suggest a close fit; Hoelter, 1983 ), the Root 
Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA: values <0.05 
are required for close fit; Hu and Bentler, 1999 ), the Tucker-
Lewis Index (TLI: values >0.95 suggest close fit; Bentler and 
Bonett, 1980 ), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI: values >0.95 are 
required for a close fit; Hu and Bentler, 1999 ) and the Standardized 
Root Mean Residual (SRMR: values <0.08 are needed for a 
good fit; Hooper et  al., 2008 ). Model selection criteria were also 
considered, namely Akaike’s Information Criteria (AIC; Akaike, 
1974 ) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC; Schwarz, 1978 ) 
were reported, for which a lower value indicates a better model.
The multiple indicator multiple causes model (MIMIC; 
Joreskog and Goldberger, 1975 ; Muthén, 1979 ) was used to 
assess measurement invariance in relation to gender and age. 
An item was considered measurement non-invariant when the 
effect of the exogenous variable (age or gender) on the item 
directly (hereafter direct effect or de) was statistically significant. 
The MIMIC model was preferred in this study to allow for 
testing the measurement invariance of the S-Five items in 
relation to gender and age, each adjusted (controlled) for the 
other. Cohen’s d ( Cohen, 1988 ) was used for the effect sizes 
(small, medium, and large effects correspond to d = 0.2, 0.5, 
and 0.8, respectively).
The internal consistency of S-Five factors was evaluated by 
Cronbach (1951)  alpha and McDonald (1999)  Omega, for which 
values of α and ω >0.7 suggest satisfactory internal consistency. 
The alpha if item deleted and the item-total correlations (ITC), 
for which values between 0.3 and 0.8 were considered acceptable 
(Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994 ).
The test re-test reliability was evaluated, at item and factor 
level, by the intraclass correlations coefficient (ICC: two-way 
mixed effects with absolute agreement; Shrout and Fleiss, 1979 ) 
and the Psi Non-Parametric Concordance Coefficient (Psi; 
Kuiper and Hoogenboezem, 2019 ). The Psi coefficient value 
represents the probability that a value randomly drawn from 
the data matrix will fall outside of the difference between the 
measurement scores at each time point ( Rothery, 1979 ). For 
acceptable test–retest reliability, values above 0.75 for both 
coefficients were expected, according to Koo and Li (2016) .
Convergent and concurrent validity were established through 
correlating the S-Five with the two other measurements scales 
for misophonia (MQ and A-MISO-S). Discriminant validity was 
established by correlating the S-Five with the GAD-7 and PHQ-9. 
Hypothesis testing was carried out, with respect to linear relationships 
between the S-Five and age, and gender differences in S-Five scores.
The statistical software of Stata 16 ( StataCorp, 2019 ), 
Mplus 8 ( Muthen and Muthén, 1998 ) and R ( R Core Team, 
2020 ) were used to carry out the analysis.
RESULTS
Descriptive Indices
The sample ( n = 256) consisted of 186 females (71%) and 66 
males (25%), with a mean age of 25 years ( sd = 6.5; n = 251)

Vitoratou et al. S-Five Model in MandarinFrontiers in Psychology  | www.frontiersin.org  5 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 879881which did not differ across genders ( p > 0.05). Missing data 
was low. For instance, missingness for age was 2% ( n = 4) and 
1% ( n = 3) for gender. Where missingness was present in the 
variables used in the analysis. Listwise deletion was used, thus 
sample sizes vary.
The majority of the sample, 154 people (60%), had completed 
an undergraduate degree and 161 (63%) were students at the 
time of completing the study. Most (88%) of participants were 
Han, the rest were from minority ethnic groups, including 
Uygur, Yi, Manchu, Tujia, Zhuang, Bai and Mongolian. All 
participants were born in China and lived there at the time 
of completing the survey.
With respect to reported mental health and audiological 
conditions, the most often reported were depression (5%), 
social anxiety (4%) and tinnitus (4%). In terms of misophonia, 
85 participants (33%) stated they were aware of the term 
misophonia and 41 (16%) identified as having misophonia. 
Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) was 
experienced by 42% of the sample and synaesthesia by 25% 
(28% were unsure).
The retest sample ( n = 34) included 4 males (11.8%) and 
30 females (88.2%), with an age range of 19 to 36 years old 
(mean  = 23.5, sd = 3.44).S-Five Statements
Statement Responses
The descriptive indices of the 25 S-Five statements are presented 
in Table  1 . The items more widely endorsed (higher mean/
median) were those related to the externalising  and threat  
factors. None of the items correlated significantly with age 
but there were score differences with respect to gender ( Table 1 ). 
Interestingly, none of the items referring to the externalising  
and threat  items factors differed across genders, while males 
scored significantly higher than females in almost all other items.
Dimensionality and Measurement Invariance
First, we established that the sample correlation matrix suggested 
the existence of latent vectors. The anti-image correlations were 
above 0.88 for all statements, the KMO was 0.94, and Bartlett’s 
test was significant ( χ2 = 13,773,1, df = 300, p < 0.001). We therefore 
proceeded with exploratory factor analysis.
The sample correlation matrix emerged five eigenvalues 
above 1 (12.1, 3.2, 1.5, 1.3, and 1.1) and hence the Kaiser-
Guttman criterion points towards a five-factor structure, 
explaining 73% of the total variance. Parallel analysis, on 
the other hand, indicated that three factors should be extracted, TABLE 1 |  Descriptive indices, associations with age and gender, factor analysis loadings to factors, and reliability indices of the 25 S-Five items ( N = 225).

of-fit examination suggested that the three-factor model 
however did not fit the data adequately [rel χ2 = 4.3;

of-fit was improved for the four-factor model [rel χ2 = 3.02; 
RMSEA = 0.09 with 90% (0.081, 0.197), TLI = 0.89, CFI = 0.92, 
SRMR = 0.036, AIC: 27169.3, BIC: 27679.3], but close fit was 
only achieved in the 5 factor models [rel χ2 = 2.01; 
RMSEA = 0.063 with 90% (0.054, 0.072), TLI = 0.94, CFI = 0.97, 
SRMR = 0.020, AIC: 26960.8, BIC: 27545.1]. Increasing the 
factors to six led to a sixth factor with no loading larger 
than 0.3 (overfitting). Therefore, the five-factor solution was 
accepted in our data. The five factor solution loadings are 
presented in Table  2  (see appendix A3 for the full pattern 
matrix) and the assignment of the items to factors coincides 
completely with the original model found by Vitoratou et al. 
(2021b) .
We proceeded with the evaluation of the measurement 
invariance of the tool with respect to gender and age using 
the MIMIC model. Adjusted for gender and the five latent 
dimensions, only one item was found to be non-invariant with 
respect to age, namely item I02 (‘If I  cannot get away from certain noises, I  am  afraid I  might panic or feel like I’ll 
explode’), being less endorsed on average as age increases 
(de = −0.04, p = 0.027). The direct effect was however very small 
(0.04 units on a scale of 0 to 10, for each additional year in 
age, that is 0.4 units between decades, Cohen’s d = −0.0043) 
and can be  considered negligible. With respect to gender, men 
tend to endorse more often the same item (I02) compared to 
women of the same age and latent positions (de = −0.65, p = 0.015, 
Cohen’s d = −0.065). Finally, women tend to endorse more the 
item I08 (‘the way I  react to certain noises makes me feel 
like I  must be  an unlikable person deep down’) compared to 
men of the same age and latent positions (de = 0.55, p = 0.019, 
Cohen’s d = −0.06). In all cases the effects were less than half 
a unit on an 11-unit rating scale, and as only two effects were 
identified in the case of gender and one in the case of age, 
it is reasonable to conclude that the S-Five scores are effectively 
measurement invariant with respect to those factors and therefore 
the assessment of structural invariance (factor score differences) 
is reasonably justified.
S-Five Scores: Reliability and Validity
None of the S-Five factor scores were correlated with age in 
our sample ( Table  2 ). While there were no gender differences 
in the scores of the externalising and threat factors, in all 
other factors men scored significantly higher than women.
With respect to internal consistency, alpha and omega were 
satisfactory within all factors (0.88 or higher; Table  2 ), while 
test–retest reliability was also satisfactory with ICC being larger 
than 0.86 for all S-Five scores.
Table  3  presents the correlations of the S-Five factor scores 
and total score with several measurement scales, namely, 
two misophonia scales (MQ and A-MISO-S), PHQ-9 and 
GAD-7. Evidence of convergent validity is demonstrated by 
moderately strong correlations between the S-Five total score 
and the MQ and A-MISO-R. With respect to the PHQ-9 
and GAD-7, low to moderate positive correlations with the 
S-Five factors and total score were found. Intercorrelations 
between the S-Five factors ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 and, as 
expected moderate to strong correlations were identified 
(Table  3 ). Additional evidence of discriminative validity was 
demonstrated by a significantly higher score on all S-Five

Vitoratou et al. S-Five Model in MandarinFrontiers in Psychology  | www.frontiersin.org  7 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 879881factors and S-Five total score for those self-identifying as 
having misophonia compared to those who did not self-
identify as (for instance, S-Five total ( n = 33) mean  = 146.12, 
sd = 41.0 versus S-Five total ( n = 159) mean  = 88.65, sd = 49, 
t53.8 = 6.964, p < 0.001, respectively).
S-Five-T Scoring Instructions
The S-Five-T items and the scoring instructions are presented 
in the appendix (English and Mandarin). The norms of the 
S-Five-T are presented in Table  4 .
Reaction Counts
On average, participants reported 20 out of 37 trigger sounds 
caused no feeling  (Table  4 ). Irritation  was the next highest 
reported reaction, with an average of 5 trigger sounds reported 
as causing this reaction. Irritation  and disgust  had small, 
significant positive correlations with age. In terms of gender, 
women scored significantly higher on the RC for irritation , 
while men scored higher on anger .With respect to the RC scores, the intercorrelations varied 
between 0.2 and 0.7 ( Table  5 ). All correlations were positive 
except for the no feeling  count, for which all correlations with 
other variables were negative. Interestingly, disgust correlated 
only with no feeling  and irritation . Distress  had low correlations 
with all other RCs. The highest correlations emerged between 
no feeling , anger  and panic . The total number of triggers reported 
was highly correlated with disgust and emerged similar 
coefficients with FIRS. RIRS on the contrary did not correlate 
with disgust , anger  or panic .
The RC for no feeling , irritation, distress  and anger , and 
total count had moderate correlations with the A-MISO-S and 
MQ total score. The PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 were significantly 
correlated with the RC distress  and panic  and TC, while both 
were negatively correlated with the reaction count of no feeling .
Intensity

lip smacking, baby crying, and repetitive sounds of barking 
or engine. The sounds with the least intensity in the reaction 
were certain words and accents, yawning, and normal eating. 
Three items had low positive correlations with age (repetitive 
barking, loud chewing and teeth sucking), while normal breathing 
had a low negative correlation with age. For one item, coughing, 
men scored higher than woman.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric 
properties of the Mandarin version of the S-Five questionnaire. 
This was, to our knowledge, the first study to validate a self-
reported multidimensional questionnaire for misophonia within 
this population. The psychometric analysis conducted concluded 
that the original five factor structure found in the general UK 
population ( Vitoratou et  al., 2022 ) and a large sample of 
English-speaking individuals who identify with the condition 
(Vitoratou et al., 2021b ) was replicated for the Mandarin version. 
The scale was also found to be  reliable (both in terms of 
internal consistency of each factor and stability in time), 
measurement invariant with respect to age and gender, and 
evidence of its validity emerged.
The original five dimensions (internalising appraisals, 
externalising appraisals, perceived emotional threat, outbursts, and impact on functioning) were fully and accurately reproduced 
in a sample derived from a population that not only speaks 
a different language but also belongs to an Asian culture. This 
highlights the consistency of the multidimensional experience 
of misophonia as captured by the S-Five. The S-Five items 
were designed to reflect sound sensitivities in a manner that 
is not specific or more matching to individuals of a certain 
age, gender, ethnicity, nationality socio-economic status and 
educational level. In this study, we  see evidence that indeed 
the S-Five is robust cross culturally. Most importantly, the 
reproduction of the five factors in a Chinese sample in Mandarin 
points to the stability of the manifestation of misophonia across 
cultures, seen here for the first time in the literature.
The convergent validity of the S-Five was established through 
correlating the factors of the scale and total score with previously 
development measures of misophonia. The MQ and the 
A-MISO-S were significantly, positively and moderately 
correlated with the five factors of the S-Five and with the 
total score. Spearman’s rho coefficients were comparable to 
those found in previous S-Five validation studies ( Vitoratou 
et  al., 2021b , 2022 ). We  note the moderate correlations with 
other scales measuring misophonia, which we  propose is due 
to the broader construct of misophonia captured by the S-Five 
than the other measures used for construct validity, which 
are not multidimensional. Future studies could assess convergent 
validity with another multidimensional tool, for example the

Vitoratou et al. S-Five Model in MandarinFrontiers in Psychology  | www.frontiersin.org  9 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 879881Duke Misophonia Questionnaire ( Rosenthal et al., 2021 ), which 
had not been published at the time the present study 
was designed.
This study found that the sounds of baby crying and lip 
smacking had the highest average intensity of reaction. This 
is contrary to our hypothesis that the most intense reaction 
would be  from the sound of loud eating, as was found in 
a UK general population study ( Vitoratou et  al., 2022 ) and 
in a sample of individuals identifying with having misophonia 
(Vitoratou et  al., 2021b ). Lip smacking was also reported 
as eliciting the most intense reaction in a Dutch study 
(Schröder et al., 2019 ). Further research is needed to clarify 
whether there are cross cultural differences in the types of 
sounds eliciting negative reactions in misophonia. It was 
interesting to note that in the present study, the reaction 
count of irritation was positively correlated with the other 
negative reactions and was low to moderately correlated 
with S-Five factors. This is not consistent with studies using 
UK samples, which have shown very low ( Vitoratou et  al., 2022 ) or even negative correlations ( Vitoratou et  al., 2021b ) 
between irritation and other S-Five factors. Further research 
is needed to better understand these contrasting results.
The S-Five also importantly highlights that the reactions 
to such sounds may be  influenced by gender. Female 
participants scored significantly higher on the RC irritation, 
while men scored higher on the RC anger. With regards 
to the S-Five, male respondents scored significantly higher 
on the internalising appraisals, impact on functioning and 
outburst factors, as well as the total score. This was in 
contrast to the finding that female respondents scored 
significantly higher on internalising in a UK sample of 
individuals identifying with having misophonia ( Vitoratou 
et  al., 2021a ), and the finding that there was no significant 
gender difference on these factors in a UK representative 
sample ( Vitoratou et  al., 2022 ). Further research is needed 
using representative samples to determine whether there 
are any cross-cultural differences in the relationship between

Vitoratou et al. S-Five Model in MandarinFrontiers in Psychology  | www.frontiersin.org  10 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 879881We found a positive correlation between symptoms of 
misophonia and symptoms of depression and anxiety, which 
supports the findings of previous studies. Zhou et al. (2017)   
found that in a sample of Chinese college students, misophonic 
symptoms and severity of misophonic symptoms were correlated 
with anxiety. Similarly, Quek et al. (2018)   found a positive 
association between the severity of anxiety and the  
severity of misophonic symptoms in Singaporean psychiatric  
patients.
There were several limitations that arose in this study. 
First, the sample collected cannot be considered a representative 
sample of the Chinese population. This limits the use of 
the findings in being unable to compute and evaluate 
populations norms for misophonia. Also, our data come from 
the general population, and therefore our findings might 
be  different to those that would have emerged in a clinical 
sample. Future research should replicate this work in a sample 
of people with misophonia. A further limitation of the study 
was the self-reporting of co-occurring diagnoses and symptoms 
of anxiety and depression; future studies would benefit from 
structured clinical interviews to examine the relationship 
between disorders. Additionally, the S-Five has not yet been 
tested for discriminative validity in relation to other disorders 
of sound intolerance, such as tinnitus or hyperacusis, which 
needs to be  addressed in future research. Because of these 
limitations, it is unknown to what extent the S-Five assesses 
the severity of misophonia alone or misophonia comorbid 
with related auditory disorders.
The present study evaluated a Mandarin version of the 
S-Five, a self-report measure for symptoms of misophonia, 
within a Chinese sample. The S-Five was found to have 
comparable reliability and validity, and the five-factor 
structure found in the original English scale was replicated. 
The study provides further support that the S-Five is a 
reliable and valid tool for measuring symptoms of misophonia 
and that the Mandarin version can be  used for the 
Chinese population.
