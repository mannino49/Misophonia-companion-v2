Objective: Individuals with misophonia display extreme sensitivities to selective sounds, often resulting in negative emotions and subsequent maladaptive behaviors, such as avoidance and anger outbursts. While there has been increasing interest in misophonia, few data have been published to date. Method: This study investigated the incidence, phenomenology, correlates, and impairment associated with misophonia symptoms in 483 undergraduate students through self-report measures.

Results: Misophonia was a relatively common phenomenon, with nearly 20% of the sample reporting clinically significant misophonia symptoms. Furthermore, misophonia symptoms demonstrated strong associations with measures of impairment and general sensory sensitivities, and moderate associations with obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Anxiety mediated the relationship between misophonia and anger outbursts. Conclusion: This investigation contributes to a better understanding of misophonia and indicates potential factors that may co-occur and influence the clinical presentation of a person with misophonia symptoms.

Individuals with misophonia are often faced with significant distress, anger, or discomfort when exposed to specific auditory triggers (Schr¨der, Vulink &amp; Denys, 2013), which may include o common everyday sounds such as smacking of the lips, eating, chomping of the teeth, and breathing (Schwartz, Leyendecker &amp; Conlon, 2011). Additionally, some individuals may feel compelled to mimic or reproduce the sounds upon hearing them (Edelstein, Brang, Rouw &amp; Ramachandran, 2013; Hadjipavlou, Baer, Lau &amp; Howard, 2008). Consequently, those suffering frommisophoniamaynotbeabletoeatwithothers,mayavoidcertainenvironmentsorsituations where they know the sounds will be present, and often have strained relationships due to their negative emotional reactions to these auditory stimuli (Neal &amp; Cavanna, 2013; Schr¨der et al., o 2013).

The incidence of misophonia in nonclinical samples is currently unknown. Estimates suggest caseness may affect between 10%-60% in patients with tinnitus, a condition where individuals hear sounds without any actual external auditory stimuli (Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Sztuka, Pospiech, Gawron &amp; Dudek, 2010), with an estimated 10% of the general population affected by tinnitus (Kochkin, Tyler &amp; Born, 2011).

## Putative Causes

Unlike other auditory disorders involving sound, misophonia is not dependent on auditory thresholds or impairment or hyperactivation of the auditory pathways. Instead, it is suggested to be associated with enhanced auditory, limbic, and autonomic nervous system neural connections (Jastreboff &amp; Hazell, 2004; Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff, 2013). Due to the nature of selective sound sensitivity, neurophysiological structures affected by misophonia may be related to components responsible for processing sounds at a higher level (Møller, 2011). It is posited that the context in which the sound is presented, the individual's perception of and previous experience with the sound, and physical characteristics of the sound may coalesce to determine the reaction or distress to a particular sound (Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff, 2001).

## Clinical Correlates

With regards to psychiatric comorbidity in misophonia, clinical observations have suggested the co-occurrence of internalizing disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and related conditions (e.g., Tourette Disorder; Edelstein et al., 2013; Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Neal &amp; Cavanna, 2013; Schwartz et al., 2011). Indeed, the shared characteristics between misophonia and OCD and anxiety disorders-namely, the negative reactions triggered by a specific stimuli, associated level of anxiety and distress, and corresponding need to avoid situations or complete compulsions as a result of certain sounds-have prompted speculation that misophonia is closely related to obsessive-compulsive and related disorders and may be treated using similar modalities (Johnson et al., 2013; Schwartz et al., 2011).

Specifically, the negative reinforcement achieved through distress reduction by engaging in avoidant behaviors and related behavioral responses is analogous to similar maladaptive behaviors exhibited in OCD and anxiety disorders (Kircanski, Peris &amp; Piacentini, 2011). As such, exposure-based cognitive-behavioral interventions may similarly help with the management of misophonia symptoms when utilized in conjunction with audiological treatments, such as Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (Jastreboff, 2011). However, there remains limited research on misophonia, and more extensive investigation is necessary to understand its phenomenology to devise effective interventions.

Although there has been a recent rise in interest regarding misophonia, only case studies (Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2013; Schwartz et al., 2011; Veale, 2006) and two clinical studies (Edelstein et al., 2013; Schr¨der et al., 2013) have been published to date. As o such, the present study investigates the incidence, correlates, and impairment associated with misophonia symptoms in a large undergraduate university student sample. Specifically, this study had the following aims: (a) provide descriptive information about misophonia symptoms (e.g., frequency of various misophonia symptoms endorsed); (b) investigate correlations between misophonia symptoms and impairment in various domains of life (e.g., work/school, social, and

family life/home responsibilities); (c) examine the relationship between misophonia symptoms and other clinical constructs (e.g., sensory sensitivities, OCD, anxiety, depression); and (d) determine possible mediating effects of anxiety on misophonia and misophonia-related anger. We expected that as misophonia symptoms increased, anxiety symptoms would increase as well, and anxiety would be directly related to misophonia-related anger. In other words, it was expected that misophonia-related anger would be indirectly affected by misophonia symptoms through anxiety.

## Methods

## Participants and Procedures

Participants were 483 undergraduate university students at the University of South Florida (USF) in Tampa, Florida. Details regarding the demographic characteristics of the study sample are presented in Table 1. The majority of participants were female (83.6%), ranging from 18 to 54 years of age (mean [ M ] = 21.43, standard deviation [ SD ] = 4.52). Of the 483 participants, 277 (57.3%) were Caucasian/White, 51 (10.6%) were African American, 23 (4.8%) were Asian, 88 (18.2%) were Latino/Hispanic, 10 (2.1%) were Middle Eastern, and 34 (7%) were reported as other/mixed. The most commonly reported combined gross annual income for the participant's family was over $100,000 (17.2%), with the total sample ranging between under $10,000 to over $100,000 a year.

All data were collected via online administration of questionnaires through a secure online participant pool. The online participant pool is utilized for undergraduate students taking psychology course(s) that wish to receive extra credit for the psychology course(s) they are currently enrolled in (e.g., clinical, experimental, social, cognitive psychology courses). All participants must have been 18 years of age or older to qualify for the study. Participants who were registered through the online participant pool were able to read through an online institutional review board approved informed consent document to learn more about the study. All participants must have electronically acknowledged reading the informed consent and agreed to participate before proceeding with the study. Thereafter, all questionnaires were administered remotely via the online database. Anonymous responses coded with subject numbers could be retrieved through the online participant pool by the study investigators.

presence, resulting emotions and behaviors, and the overall severity of sound sensitivities. In preparation for developing this measure, a comprehensive literature search was conducted to ensure the items would be carefully derived from the extant research. Currently published articles containing other measures that assess misophonia symptoms (e.g., Schr¨der et al., 2013) were o not available until after enrollment had commenced for the present study-hence the development of the current measure.

Items were reviewed by psychologists and psychiatrists clinically experienced with misophonia and knowledgeable about the literature, and were piloted on two patients with misophonia in an OCD-specialty outpatient clinic for readability and clarity. Revisions to the items (e.g., rewording items, removing items that did not fit conceptually with the others) were made based on this process. Subsequently, the revised questionnaire was analyzed with exploratory factor analysis through the default settings (e.g., geomin rotation, maximum likelihood estimates) in Mplus (Muth´ en &amp; Muth´ en, 1998-2012). Based on the recommendations of Henson and Roberts (2006), a final three-factor solution was determined using multiple methods, specifically derived from parallel analysis and eigenvalues greater than 1 (Table 2).

The first section, named Misophonia Symptom Scale, examines the presence of specific sound sensitivities (e.g., eating, tapping, throat sounds). The second part, named Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors Scale, examines emotional and behavioral reactions associated with misophonia symptoms. Example items include 'leaving the environment to a place where the sound(s) cannot be heard anymore' and 'become anxious or distressed.' The first two parts are rated on a 0 to 4 scale, ranging from 0 ( not at all true ), to 4 ( always true ). The first two sections are summed to form the Total score, with possible values ranging from 0 to 68.

Thelast section of the questionnaire, named the Misophonia Severity Scale, was adapted from the NIMH Global Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (NIMH GOCS; Murphy, Pickar &amp; Alterman, 1982) to be applicable for misophonia. It allows the respondent to provide a rating of their sound sensitivity on a scale from 1 to 15, ranging from 'minimal' to 'very severe,' respectively, with a score greater than or equal to 7 indicating clinically significant symptoms. Reports of 7

or above indicate at least 'moderate sound sensitivities' that cause 'significant interference,' which mirrors the clinical cutoff that is used for the NIMH GOCS in populations with OCD (St. Clare, 2003).

For the present study, the internal consistency was α = .86 for the Misophonia Symptom Scale, α = .86 for the Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors Scale, and α = .89 for the Total score (i.e., the combination of the first two sections). To preliminarily test convergent validity, a Pearson's product-moment correlation revealed a strong correlation ( r = .50, p &lt; .001) between the total score and the unique question on the Adult Sensory Questionnaire (ASQ; Kinnealey &amp; Oliver, 2002) that assesses the presence of sound sensitivities. To test discriminant validity, a Pearson's product-moment correlation between the MQ Total score was calculated with other sensory sensitivities. The MQ Total score possessed small to moderate correlations with the questions on the ASQ unique to visual ( r = .33, p &lt; .001), olfactory ( r = .28, p &lt; .001), and tactile sensitivities ( r = .34, p &lt; .001), which were all notably smaller than the aforementioned correlation with sound sensitivities.

Furthermore, using the Hotelling-Williams test (Bobko, 1995), the correlation between the MQ Total score and the ASQ sound sensitivities item was confirmed to be statistically significantly different from the correlations between the MQ Total score and the other sensory sensitivities, providing further support for its ability to discriminate between other types of sensory defensiveness.

ASQ. The ASQ (Kinnealey &amp; Oliver, 2002) is a 26-item self-reported measure of sensory defensiveness on which respondents rate items true or false. Sensory defensiveness is defined as a condition where individuals display oversensitivity and aversive reactions to certain sensory stimuli (e.g., tactile, auditory, olfactory) that are typically innocuous (Kinnealey, Oliver &amp; Willbarger, 1995). Based on the number of items endorsed as 'true,' respondents fall on a continuum of scores that suggests 'definite sensory defensiveness,' 'moderate sensory defensiveness,' or 'not sensory defensive.' Items cover sensitivities in different sensory modalities (e.g., olfactory, auditory, tactile, visual, gustatory) and describe different situations that suggest sensory sensitivity. Cutoff scores from the ASQ were drawn from adults between the ages of 18 and 48 years, and the test-retest reliability for the measure was reported as 0.92 (Kinnealey &amp; Oliver, 2002). Internal consistency for the present study was α = .79.

Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). The SDS (Sheehan, 1983) is a three-item self-reported questionnaire that measures the level of impairment in work/school, social, and family life/home responsibilities due to the symptoms of interest. For this study, ratings were garnered for impairment specifically related to sound sensitivities. Responses are recorded on a 10-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 ( not at all ) to 10 ( extremely ) interfering. The internal consistency is reportedly high ( α = .89) for the three-item scale and was adequate in identifying clinically impaired patients (Sheehan, 2000). Internal consistency was α = .78 for the present sample.

Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R). The OCI-R (Foa et al., 2002) is an 18-item measure that assesses the presence and distress associated with varied obsessivecompulsive symptoms. Answers are recorded on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 ( not at all ) to 4 ( extremely ), in which responders choose how much each symptom has bothered or distressed them in the past month. The OCI-R is a psychometrically sound instrument, demonstrating high internal consistency, excellent test-retest reliability, and good convergent and divergent validity (Abramowitz &amp; Deacon, 2006; Foa et al., 2002; Storch et al., 2009). Internal consistency for the present study was α = 0.90.

Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). The DASS-21 (Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995) is a 21-item questionnaire that assesses symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in the past week. Answers are given on a Likert scale, ranging from 0 ( did not apply to me at all ) to 3 ( applied to me very much, or most of the time ). Separate subscale scores for anxiety, depression, and stress can be garnered. The DASS-21 possesses good psychometric properties, showing excellent internal consistency, as well as good convergent and discriminant validity when compared

to other validated measures of depression, anxiety, and overall functioning (Antony, Bieling, Cox, Enns &amp; Swinson, 1998; Henry &amp; Crawford, 2005; Ng et al., 2007). Internal consistency for the present study was α = .95.

Rage Outbursts and Anger Rating Scale (ROARS). The ROARS (Budman et al., 2008) is a three-item questionnaire that assesses the frequency, intensity, and duration of rage attack(s) in the past week. Answers are provided on 4-point scale (from 0 to 3). Scoring for the questionnaire is garnered by the sum of all responses, resulting in values ranging from 0 to 9; respondents with a total score between 0 and 3 are 'mild,' between 4 and 6 'moderate,' and between 7 and 9 'severe.' Initial findings by Storch et al. (2012) demonstrate the measure's good construct validity in youth with OCD exhibiting anger outbursts. Internal consistency for the present sample was α = .83.

## Data Analytic Plan

All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 21 (IBM Corp, 2012). Mahalanobis distance was utilized to detect the presence of outliers based on all predictor variables (Mahalanobis, 1936). Fifteen potential outliers were detected, so all analyses were run with and without the outliers to detect any significant changes in results. Ultimately, all correlational and mediating outcomes remained the same, so all subsequent results reported were based on the dataset excluding the outliers ( n = 483). Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographics variables (e.g., age, gender) and misophonia symptoms endorsed. Investigation of potential gender differences when considering specific misophonia symptoms were conducted through multivariate analyses of variance. Pearson product-moment correlations were conducted to assess the relationship between misophonia symptoms and the severity of sound sensitivities, general sensory sensitivities, impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, anxiety, and depressive symptomology. Independent t tests were conducted to detect potential differences in these variables between individuals with clinical and subclinical levels of misophonia symptoms.

For mediation analyses, the INDIRECT macro in SPSS was utilized as presented by Preacher and Hayes (2008). The bootstrapping technique was employed to detect significant mediators, with the number of bootstrap resamples set at 5,000. Statistically significant mediators were detected if the 95% confidence interval (CI) did not include 0. The bootstrapping technique calculates the same basic information provided by Baron and Kenny (1986), but allows for testing of the specific mediated effect and increased statistical power through its bootstrapped resampling (Hayes, 2009).

## Results

## Descriptive Statistics

The mean, standard deviation, range, and frequency of each misophonia symptom endorsed are presented in Table 3. The means of the responses for each symptom item on the MQ Misophonia Symptom Scale ranged between 0.52 (consonants and/or vowels) and 1.60 (repetitive tapping). Collectively, 23.4% of the study sample reported being 'sometimes' sensitive to certain sounds on average; this portion of the sample scored greater than or equal to a score of '2,' on average, for all seven of the misophonia symptom questions, garnering a score of 14 or higher. Additionally, 19.9% of the participants (inclusive of the 23.4% of the study sample) reported having clinically significant misophonia symptoms that cause interference in their lives, as indicated by a score of 7 or higher on their ratings of sound sensitivities on the MQ Misophonia Severity Scale.

Individual misophonia symptom frequencies were investigated to assess the portion of participants that were either 'often' or 'always' sensitive to the respective sounds. Specifically, 22.8% were often/always sensitive to the sound of people eating (e.g., chewing, swallowing, slurping), 22.8% were often/always sensitive to repetitive tapping (e.g., pen on table, foot on floor), 16.1% were often/always sensitive to the sound of rustling (e.g., paper, plastic), 21.7% were often/always sensitive to nasal sounds (e.g., sniffing, inhale), 19.5% were often/always

sensitive to throat sounds (e.g., coughing, throat-clearing), 4.1% were often/always sensitive to certain consonants and/or vowels (e.g., 'k' sounds), and 14.7% were often/always sensitive to environmental sounds (e.g., clock ticking, refrigerator humming). There were no significant gender differences with regards to the individual misophonia symptoms endorsed (quantified as the MQ Total score). Furthermore, no statistically significant relationships were found between misophonia symptoms and age or ethnicity.

To investigate the levels of functional impairment due to misophonia symptoms, percentages were calculated for individuals reporting a moderate or higher range (i.e., 4 or above) of impairment on each SDS subscale. Moderate or higher levels of functional impairment were reported at 14.9% for work and school-related functioning, 6.4% for social functioning, and 5.6% for family and home functioning. When investigating individuals that met the cutoff for clinically significant misophonia symptoms, the percentages for moderate or higher levels of functional impairment were 52.1% for work and school functioning, 22.9% for social functioning, and 18.8% for family and home functioning. The notably higher percentages within this group corroborate the heightened impairment experienced by individuals meeting the clinical cutoff for misophonia symptoms.

## Correlations

The correlation matrix, as well as the means, standard deviations, and ranges for all study measures are in Table 4. All study variables exhibited positive and statistically significant associations. With regards to the relationship with misophonia symptoms (as measured by the Misophonia Questionnaire), a strong association was demonstrated with the severity of sound sensitivity ( r = .67, p &lt; .001), general sensory sensitivities ( r = .53, p &lt; .001), misophonia-related work and school impairment ( r = .57, p &lt; .001), misophonia-related social impairment ( r = .51, p &lt; .001), and misophonia-related overall impairment ( r = .60, p &lt; .001). Misophonia symptoms exhibited a moderate relationship with impairment in misophonia-related family life/home responsibilities ( r = .40, p &lt; .001), obsessive-compulsive symptoms ( r = .47, p &lt; .001), anxiety symptoms ( r = .39, p &lt; .001), and depressive symptoms ( r = .30, p &lt; .001).

## Mean Differences in Study Variables for Clinical and Subclinical Misophonia Symptoms

Individuals that reported a 7 or higher on the MQ Misophonia Severity Scale were considered to have clinically significant misophonia symptoms for the purposes of this study, which is analogous to the clinical cutoff on the NIMH GOCS (Murphy et al., 1982). Means, standard deviations, t -test results, and Cohen's d values are displayed in Table 5 for individuals that were reportedly affected by at least some sound sensitivities (i.e., individuals not reporting any sound sensitivities did not complete the MQ Misophonia Severity Scale, and were thus not

included in the table). Statistically significant mean differences were found between individuals with clinical and subclinical levels on all study variables. Specifically, individuals with clinical levels of misophonia symptoms displayed higher scores across all variables, demonstrating a large effect size for misophonia symptoms, misophonia-related work and school impairment, misophonia-related social impairment, and total misophonia-related impairment, a medium effect size for general sensory defensiveness, misophonia-related family and home impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and anxiety, and a small effect size for depressive symptoms.

## Mediation

Anxiety was tested as a potential mediator between misophonia symptoms (as measured by the MQ Misophonia Symptom Scale) and anger attacks (ROARS). The a path (misophonia symptoms to anxiety) was found to be statistically significant, β = 0.30, t (483) = 5.76, p &lt; .0001.

The c path (total effect of misophonia symptoms on rage) was significant, β = 0.06, t (483) = 6.44, p &lt; .0001. Finally, the c ' path (direct effect of misophonia symptoms on rage) was statistically significant, β = 0.04, t (483) = 4.69, p &lt; .0001. Anxiety was ultimately found to be a statistically significant mediator (see Figure 1) for the relationship between misophonia symptoms and rage ( β = 0.02, 95% CI [0.01, 0.03]).

## Discussion

This initial study examined the incidence, phenomenology, correlates, and impairment of misophonia in a large university undergraduate sample. When investigating the frequency of misophonia symptoms, nearly a quarter of the sample stated being 'sometimes' sensitive to selective sounds, on average. Of the most bothersome were sounds of people eating and/or repetitive tapping, with close to a quarter of the sample noting that they are 'often' or 'always' sensitive to those auditory stimuli, which is consistent with previous findings (Edelstein et al., 2013). Collectively, misophonia symptoms appear to be relatively common in a nonclinical sample and may not be limited to patients presenting at otolaryngology clinics, which has been the previous focus (Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Sztuka et al., 2010).

Furthermore, much research has been devoted to other auditory conditions, such as tinnitus, which have received relatively more attention in audiology (Jastreboff, 2011; Jastreboff, Hazell &amp; Graham, 1994; Nyenhuis, Golm &amp; Kroner-Herwig, 2013; Smith, Romanelli-Gobbi, Gray-Karagrigoriou &amp; Artz, 2013). In comparison to previously reported rates of tinnitus in the community (10%; Kochkin et al., 2011), clinically significant misophonia symptoms were reported in close to 20% of the sample. Thus, while a quarter of the study sample reported being 'sometimes' sensitive to certain sounds, closer to 20% of the entire study sample (inclusive of the aforementioned quarter of the sample) noted that these sound sensitivities were causing significant interference.

When investigating the relationship between misophonia and associated clinical characteristics, various positive, significant correlations were found. Misophonia was strongly associated with general sensory sensitivities, indicating that selective sound sensitivities may be linked to higher occurrences of other types of sensory defensiveness as well (Baguley &amp; McFerran, 2011; Stansfeld, Clark, Jenkins &amp; Tarnopolsky, 1985). Recognizing other types of sensory sensitivities in individuals, such as tactile sensitivity, may help in the detection of concurrent increased sound sensitivities. When investigating its relationship with specific domains of impairment, strong correlations were exhibited for work/school and social life, as well as total impairment, while family and home life possessed a moderate correlation. This discrepancy may be attributed to family accommodation or avoidance of distressing auditory stimuli, including the ability to leave the situations involving the distressing sounds with relatively less resistance. At home, individuals with misophonia may be permitted to engage in safety behaviors without significant repercussions, while the converse would be expected from social and work and school situations if responsibilities were not carried out, resulting in higher impairment.

Furthermore, individuals that reported having clinically significant misophonia symptoms displayed significant differences across study variables when compared to individuals with subclinical misophonia symptoms. As such, it is suggested that misophonia is related to elevated levels of several related constructs, such as impairment, anxiety, general sensory defensiveness, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms.

Misophonia symptoms demonstrated significant, moderate correlations with obsessivecompulsive symptoms, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. For obsessive-compulsive and misophonia symptoms, both may contain obsessive preoccupations with specific types of sounds, resulting in anxiety and distress. This may ultimately lead to much avoidance and/or rituals associated with the sounds, resulting in impairment in various domains of life. However, Schr¨der o et al. (2013) suggested that misophonia should contain its own diagnostic criteria, as their sample exhibited only reactions of anger (rather than anxiety), and not everyone with misophonia engaged in compulsions as a result of their sound sensitivities, although they likely displayed active avoidance, a feature common in OCD and anxiety disorders (McGuire et al., 2012). As such, further investigation into the nature of emotional and behavioral reactions to selective sounds, as well as the neurobiology of misophonia, can shed light on information that can aid in diagnosis.

Misophonia demonstrated moderate correlations with anxiety and depressive symptoms, suggesting a moderately increased likelihood of displaying anxiety and/or depressive symptoms, which may link back to their sound sensitivities. It is possible that the sound sensitivities can lead to increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, with the auditory triggers directly eliciting internal distress upon hearing the sounds. However, it is also plausible that anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with an increased sensitivity to certain things, such as specific sounds. For instance, commonly shared irritability between depressive and/or anxiety symptoms may decrease their threshold for tolerating mild or otherwise innocuous stimuli.

Collectively, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, anxiety, and depressive symptoms all shared similarly robust correlations with misophonia symptoms. These modest correlations indicate that misophonia may possess phenomenological similarities, such as anxiety, obsessional thinking, irritability, and/or avoidance (Schr¨der et al., 2013). However, commonalities do not necessarily o equate to the suggestion that all of these symptoms are rooted in one common disorder. Indeed, the comparable correlations across each construct suggest that misophonia is related to all of these disorders and cannot be uniquely linked to one diagnosis at this time. As such, further research and data are needed on clinical cases to help inform accurate diagnostic classification.

Examining factors that may influence the relationship between misophonia symptoms and subsequent impairment is pertinent, as the emotional distress and behaviors due to misophonia symptoms commonly lead to interference in various domains of life (Edelstein et al., 2013; Schr¨ oder et al., 2013). Anxiety symptomology mediated the relationship between misophonia symptoms and anger outbursts, such that higher levels of misophonia symptoms were associated with higher anxiety, and higher anxiety was related to higher levels of anger. While misophonia has been linked to a variety of negative emotions, anger has been commonly reported upon hearing the selective sounds (Schr¨der et al., 2013; Schwartz et al., 2011). o

Additionally, anxiety has been increasingly reported within patients with misophonia as well, suggesting the importance of further investigation into emotional states beyond anger (Edelstein et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2013). This finding has potential implications for interventions, as it reveals an underlying mechanism that indirectly affects the consequences of misophonia. As such, it may be beneficial to target anxiety symptomology in cognitive-behavioral treatment to increase the individual's ability to manage their reactions to triggering sounds and employ a more adaptive behavior that does not lead to anger outbursts. Indeed, clinical presentations of misophonia allude to the temporal precedence of negative emotional states (inclusive of anxiety), leading to maladaptive behaviors and anger (Johnson et al., 2013), consistent with other cognitive-behavioral models of related constructs such as OCD and anxiety. However, as the investigation into misophonia is in its nascent stages, further empirical support for the theoretical basis of the relationship between anxiety, misophonia symptoms, and anger is warranted.

Additionally, due to the cross-sectional nature of the present study, interpretations of the meditational analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the limited ability to draw inferences of causality; for example, it may be possible to interpret the converse relationship as rage episodes leading to mounting anxiety, resulting in elevated misophonia symptoms.

## Limitations

Several limitations to the study should be noted. First, the study sample primarily comprised female undergraduate university students, limiting the generalizability. Importantly, future studies should seek to examine misophonia symptoms in pediatric populations, as clinical experience and case reports (Schwartz et al., 2011) dictate their prevalence. Second, all answers were obtained through self-report methods; future studies should obtain multi-informant reports and clinician-rated data. Third, all data were collected at a single time point; future research should collect data across multiple time points and investigate potential changes over time. Fourth, though the clinical cutoff for misophonia symptoms was utilized in a manner analogous to an established measure (St. Clare, 2003), the cutoff has not been validated in individuals with misophonia.

This study also utilized a pilot measure (MQ) to test relationships. The exploratory factor analysis converged into a three-factor solution with some secondary loadings; this indicates a need for further validation of the measure in other populations, and a bifactor model may help in determining the potential role of a general factor explaining the variance in the items. However, it is noted that other support for strong psychometric properties was evidenced by high internal consistency, high correlations with converging constructs, and statistically significantly smaller correlations with divergent constructs.

Furthermore, more detailed assessment of other auditory conditions (e.g., tinnitus, hyperacusis, phonophobia) could have provided additional important information regarding the comorbidity and clinical presentation of misophonia; future studies should formally assess for the presence of other forms of decreased sound tolerance. Given the presence of general sensory defensiveness and specifically sound sensitivities in autism spectrum disorders (Stiegler &amp; Davis, 2010), future studies should also seek to evaluate misophonia within that population to garner a better clinical picture. Last, all statistical analyses utilized correlations or regressions, limiting the ability to establish causality and directionality.

## Conclusion

Within these limitations, this study conducted an investigation into misophonia and garnered important information about its phenomenology and associations with related clinical characteristics. With the rate of significantly interfering misophonia symptoms falling around 20% for the study sample, rates of clinically significant misophonia may be higher than previously expected. Furthermore, individuals with clinical levels of misophonia symptoms demonstrated elevated levels of related constructs, indicating potentially increased difficulties with general sensory sensitivities, impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; these augmented issues have implications for the prediction of misophonia, as well as the potential benefit of incorporating these clinical constructs into treatments for misophonia. Misophonia symptoms also generally exhibited strong correlations with measures of impairment, and a moderate association with obsessive-compulsive symptoms, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. While misophonia symptoms, OCD, anxiety, and depression share some commonalities in presentation, the moderate relationships across all constructs demonstrate that misophonia may be related to multiple forms of psychopathology, through either direct or associative relationships.

Last, anxiety mediated the relationship between misophonia symptoms and anger outbursts, suggesting the role of anxiety in misophonia-induced anger outbursts. As such, addressing anxiety through targeted interventions may have important implications for the maintenance and exacerbation of misophonia. Ultimately, with a current paucity of research on misophonia, this study sought to garner data that provide a better understanding of the incidence, phenomenology, and clinical correlates of misophonia.
