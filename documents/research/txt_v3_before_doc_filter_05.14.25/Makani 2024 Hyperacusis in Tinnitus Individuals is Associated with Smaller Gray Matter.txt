Abstract: Recent evidence suggests a connection between hyperacusis and the motor system of the
brain. For instance, our recent study reported that hyperacusis in participants with tinnitus and
hearing loss is associated with smaller gray matter volumes in the supplementary motor area (SMA).
Given that hearing loss can affect gray matter changes in tinnitus, this study aimed to determine if
the changes reported in our previous findings of smaller SMA gray matter volumes in hyperacusis
persist in the absence of hearing loss. Data for this study were gathered from four prior studies
conducted between 2004 and 2019 at the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG). A total of
101 participants with tinnitus and either clinically normal hearing (normal hearing with tinnitus or
NHT, n = 35) or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (hearing loss with tinnitus or HLT, n = 66) were
included across four studies. Hyperacusis was determined by a score of ≥22 on the Hyperacusis
Questionnaire (HQ). In the NHT group, 22 (63%) participants scored ≥22 on the HQ (NHT with
hyperacusis: mean age 44.1 years, 12 females), while in the HLT group, 25 (38%) participants
scored ≥22on the HQ (HLT with hyperacusis: mean age 59.5 years, 10 females). The 2 ×2 between-
group ANOVAs revealed that hyperacusis is associated with smaller SMA gray matter volumes,
regardless of hearing levels. Notably, the smaller SMA gray matter volumes in hyperacusis were
primarily influenced by the attentional subscales of the HQ. The association between hyperacusis
and the motor system may indicate a constant alertness to sounds and a readiness for motor action.

1. Introduction
Hyperacusis is a condition characterized by an increased sensitivity to everyday
environmental sounds of mild to moderate intensity. Hyperacusis can significantly impact
the quality of life of those affected [ 1–3]. While the exact prevalence of hyperacusis remains
unknown, it is estimated to affect up to 17% of the general adult [ 4] and pediatric [ 5]
population. It occurs significantly more often in individuals with hearing disorders, such
as tinnitus and hearing loss. In fact, approximately 90% of individuals with hyperacusis
report suffering from tinnitus [ 1], and, vice versa, approximately 63% of individuals with
tinnitus report concurrent hyperacusis [ 4]. Additionally, an estimated 59% of individuals
with hyperacusis also suffer from hearing loss [ 6]. In addition to tinnitus and hearing loss,
there are other factors that can contribute to hyperacusis in both adults and children, such
as head injuries, Williams syndrome, upper respiratory tract infections, chronic otitis media,
and obsessive-compulsive disorder [2,7,8].

At a mechanistic level, increased central gain, a homeostatic response whereby the au-
ditory neurons exhibit an increased response to a given input, could explain hyperacusis [ 9].
Functional neuroimaging studies have provided support for this theory, demonstrating
that individuals with hyperacusis show increased sound-evoked activity in the auditory
pathway [ 10–12]. Moreover, hyperacusis may also involve non-auditory brain regions,
such as the orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the supplementary motor
area [ 13,14]. In particular, in a recent whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study,
we observed that in participants with tinnitus and hearing loss, concurrent hyperacusis
was associated with a smaller gray matter volume in the right supplementary motor area
(SMA) [ 14]. Since the SMA is a brain region involved in action initiation, this finding
suggests that these changes in the gray matter there might be related to a motor hyper-
reactivity to sounds. In support of this hypothesis, a resting state (electroencephalogram)
EEG by Song et al. demonstrated increased beta waves with a generator located in the SMA
in individuals with hyperacusis [13].
In our previous VBM study, all participants had tinnitus and hearing loss [ 14]. This
study design allowed us to identify gray matter differences that are specifically associ-
ated with hyperacusis, as the two groups were matched for tinnitus and hearing loss.
Hyperacusis is, however, also diagnosed in individuals with clinically normal hearing
thresholds. In this population, it is thought that hidden hearing loss, with various possible
underlying etiologies, could induce hyperacusis and tinnitus [ 15]. In a recent meta-analysis,
we established that the presence or absence of hearing loss can significantly influence gray
matter volumes in participants with tinnitus [ 16]. By including a group with tinnitus and
clinically normal hearing thresholds, the current study aimed to clarify whether smaller
SMA gray matter volumes are attributable to hyperacusis alone or if they are influenced by
the presence or absence of hearing loss.
In this retrospective case-control study, therefore, we examined whether SMA gray
matter volumes were smaller in hyperacusis adults with tinnitus and clinically normal
hearing. If the SMA gray matter volume differences associated with hyperacusis are inde-
pendent of hearing status, then individuals with clinically normal hearing and hyperacusis
should show the same trend as their counterparts with hearing loss. To test this hypothesis,
we conducted 2 ×2 between-group ANOVAs (hyperacusis ×hearing loss) within indepen-
dently defined volumes of interest in the SMA. With this approach, we aim to examine the
potential interactions between the effects of hyperacusis and hearing loss on gray matter
volumes in the SMA region. Ultimately, we hope that these findings will offer insights into
the structural mechanisms of hyperacusis, aiding the identification of structural biomarkers
for more targeted and effective interventions for individuals suffering from hyperacusis,
ultimately improving their quality of life.
2. Materials and Methods
Data for this study were gathered from four prior neuroimaging studies conducted
between 2004 and 2019 at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the University Medical
Centre Groningen (UMCG) [ 17–20]. These studies were conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the UMCG’s medical ethics committee
(METc), which additionally granted approval for data reanalysis (METc number: 2020/347).
All participants provided written informed consent.
2.1. Participants
A total of 101 participants with tinnitus and either clinically normal hearing (the
normal hearing with tinnitus or NHT group, n = 35) or bilateral sensorineural hearing
loss (the hearing loss with tinnitus or HLT group, n = 66) were included. Pure tone air-
conduction audiometry was utilized to assess hearing thresholds across octave frequencies
ranging from 0.25 to 8 kHz. Hearing loss was defined as an average hearing threshold
(or pure tone average—PTA) of ≥25 dB HL across all tested frequencies (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2,
4, and 8 kHz) for both ears. Hyperacusis was evaluated using the 14-item Hyperacusis

Brain Sci. 2024 ,14, 726 3 of 13
Questionnaire (HQ) [ 21]. Additionally, the tinnitus burden was quantified using the 25-item
Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) [ 22]. Anxiety and depression levels were determined
using the 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [ 23]. Handedness was
assessed with the 10-item Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) [24].
Similar to our previous study [ 14], a cut-off score of ≥22 on the Hyperacusis Question-
naire was used to distinguish the presence or absence of hyperacusis [25].
2.2. MRI Data Acquisition
For each participant, high-resolution 3-dimensional T1-weighted anatomical brain
images were obtained using a 3-Tesla Philips Intera scanner (Philips Medical System, Best,
The Netherlands) equipped with either an 8-channel [ 17–19] or 32-channel [ 20] phase-
array head coil (SENSE). Fast-field echo images were acquired, with a reconstructed
voxel size of 1 ×1×1 mm, using the acquisition parameters outlined in Table S1 in
the Supplementary Materials.
2.3. MRI Data Preprocessing
T1-weighted anatomical brain images were preprocessed using the CAT12.7 toolbox
(v.1653, Structural Brain Mapping Group, University of Jena, Germany, http://dbm.neuro.
uni-jena.de/cat12/, accessed on 11 July 2024) within SPM12 (v.7487, Wellcome Centre for
Human Neuroimaging, University College London, https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/,
accessed on 11 July 2024), running on MATLAB R2020a (The MathWorks, Natick, MA,
USA). Firstly, the brain images underwent correction for bias, noise, and global intensity
variations. Subsequently, the brain images were normalized to the Montreal Neurological
Institute (MNI152) template, with voxel dimensions resampled to 1.5 ×1.5×1.5 mm.
During normalization, the brain image was segmented into gray matter, white matter, and
cerebrospinal fluid. The segmented gray matter images were then modulated using the
Jacobian determinant [ 26,27]. Finally, recommended quality control measures were used to
assess the quality of the resulting normalized and modulated gray matter images. More
details can be found in our previous study [14].
2.4. Volume-of-Interest Selection for the Supplementary Motor Area
Similar to our previous study [ 14], we selected the volume of interest (VOI) corre-
sponding to the supplementary motor area (SMA), as defined in a previous study, using
both anatomical as well as functional MRI data [ 28]. This meta-analysis utilized both
task-related activation coordinates and anatomical boundaries to delineate the motor cortex
areas. This SMA VOI is freely accessible as the Human Motor Area Template (HMAT) atlas
from http://lrnlab.org/ (accessed on 11 July 2024). More details can be found in Figure S1
in the Supplementary Materials.
In order to deepen our investigation into SMA gray matter in hyperacusis, we also
investigated VOIs corresponding to the anterior and posterior subdivisions of the SMA
(SMA_A6m and SMA_A4ll respectively), as defined by the Human Brainnetome atlas
based on the structural and functional connectome architecture [ 29]. These SMA VOIs are
freely accessible as the Human Brainnetome (HBN) atlas from https://atlas.brainnetome.
org/bnatlas.html (accessed on 11 July 2024). More details can be found in Figure S1.
2.5. Gray Matter Extraction from Volume-of-Interest Areas
First, the selected VOIs were resampled to 1.5 ×1.5×1.5 mm voxel dimensions to
align with the voxel dimensions of normalized and modulated gray matter images. Next,
gray matter volumes were extracted from each selected VOI for every participant using
the “get_totals” MatLab script. This MatLab script is freely available for download from
http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/g.ridgway/vbm/get_totals.m/ (accessed on 18 July 2024).
Subsequently, these extracted gray matter volumes were subjected to further analyses using
SPSS (v.29, IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, NY, USA).

2.6. Statistical Analyses
2.6.1. Demographic, Audiometric, and Questionnaire Data
The statistical analyses of demographic, audiometric, and questionnaire data were
performed using SPSS29. To assess the between-group differences for continuous variables,
a nonparametric independent sample one-way ANOVA (Kruskal–Wallis H test) was used,
followed by Bonferroni-corrected post hoc t-test analysis. For categorical variables, the
chi-square test was used to examine between-group differences. A statistical threshold of
p≤0.05 was used for all analyses.
2.6.2. Gray Matter Volume of the Supplementary Motor Area in Association
with Hyperacusis
Effects of Hyperacusis and Hearing Loss on SMA Gray Matter Volume
We performed 2 ×2 between-group ANOVAs to investigate the main effects of
hyperacusis and hearing loss, as well as the effect of their interaction on the gray matter
volumes of the selected SMA VOIs. Age, handedness scores, and TIV were included as
covariates. The statistical threshold for these analyses was set at p≤0.05. We tested for
group differences in the HMAT left and right SMA VOI. To extend our analysis, we repeated
the analysis in the posterior and anterior portions of the left and right SMA (see Section 2.4
and Figure S1).
Differentiating the Effects of the Attentional and Social Subscales of the Hyperacusis
Questionnaire on SMA Gray Matter Volumes
Responses to the Hyperacusis Questionnaire can be classified into two component
groups: attentional and social [ 30]. To assess whether smaller SMA gray matter volumes
were (more) influenced by the scores for either the attentional or social component of
the HQ, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients between the SMA gray matter volumes
(HMAT and HBN VOIs) and scores on the attentional and social subscales of the HQ were
computed across all participants. The statistical threshold for these analyses was set at
p≤0.05.
Effects of Anxiety, Depression, or Tinnitus Burden
To assess the impact of anxiety, depression, and tinnitus burden on SMA gray matter
volumes (HMAT and HBN VOIs), Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients between the gray
matter volumes of the selected SMA VOIs and either the HADS (anxiety and depression)
or the THI (tinnitus burden) scores were computed across all participants. The statistical
threshold for these analyses was set at p≤0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Demographic, Audiometric, and Questionnaire Data
Participants were classified in the hyperacusis groups if they scored above 22 on
the Hyperacusis Questionnaire [ 14,21,25]. Accordingly, in the NHT group, 22 out of
35 participants (63%) were classified as having hyperacusis (NHT with hyperacusis: mean
age±standard deviation = 44.1 ±12.2 years, 12 females). The remaining 13 participants
who scored below the cut-off score were assigned to the control group (NHT without hyper-
acusis: mean age ±standard deviation = 45.5 ±11.2 years, 5 females). In the HLT group,
25 out of 66 participants (38%) scored above the cut-off score for hyperacusis (HLT with
hyperacusis: mean age ±standard deviation = 59.5 ±7.9 years, 10 females). The remaining
41 participants who scored below the cut-off score were assigned to the control group
(HLT with hyperacusis: mean age ±standard deviation = 58.3 ±10.5 years , 9 females).
Participant inclusion criteria for the four groups are shown in Figure 1. The proportion of
individuals suffering from hyperacusis was significantly higher in the group with clinically
normal hearing thresholds, compared to the group with hearing loss [ X2(1) = 5.7 ,p= 0.017].
These four groups showed significant differences across several variables. The statisti-
cal analyses revealed significant between-group differences in age [ X2(3) = 30.0, p< 0.001],

hearing thresholds [PTA 0.25 to 8 kHz: X2(3) = 65.8, p< 0.001], HADS scores [HADS-
anxiety: X2(3) = 11.0, p< 0.001; HADS-depression: X2(3) = 8.4, p< 0.001]; and THI scores
[X2(3) = 13.0 ,p< 0.001]. Participants with hearing loss (the HLT group either with or
without hyperacusis) were, on average, older than those with clinically normal hearing
(the NHT group either with or without hyperacusis). Mean hearing thresholds for both
ears at octave frequencies ranging from 0.25 to 8 kHz per group are shown in Figure 2.
Summarized data for the four groups are shown in Table 1 (more details are provided in
Table S2 in the Supplementary Materials).

hyperacusis: mean age ± standard deviation = 45.5 ± 11.2 years, 5 females). In the HLT 
group, 25 out of 66 participants (38%) scored above the cut-o ﬀ score for hyperacusis (HLT 
with hyperacusis: mean age ± standard deviation = 59.5 ± 7.9 years, 10 females). The re-maining 41 participants who scored below the cut-o ﬀ score were assigned to the control 
group (HLT with hyperacusis: mean age ± standard deviation = 58.3 ± 10.5 years, 9 fe-
males). Participant inclusion criteria for the four groups are shown in Figure 1. The pro-
portion of individuals su ﬀering from hyperacusis was signi ﬁcantly higher in the group 
with clinically normal hearing thresholds, compared to the group with hearing loss [ X
2(1) 
= 5.7, p = 0.017].

3.2. Association between Hyperacusis and SMA Gray Matter Volumes
3.2.1. Human Motor Area Template (HMAT) Atlas Analysis
Within the right HMAT SMA VOIs, the 2 ×2 between-group ANOVAs revealed a
significant main effect of hyperacusis on gray matter volumes [F(1,94) = 21.0, p< 0.001],

gray matter volumes relative to the controls (Figure 3). There was also a trend toward a
negative main effect of hyperacusis in the left hemisphere [F(1,94) = 3.7, p= 0.058] (Figure 3).
However, we found no significant main effect of hearing loss [SMA left: F(1,94) = 1.0,
p= 0.329 ; SMA right: F(1,94) = 0.8, p= 0.774], nor any interaction between the effects of
hyperacusis and hearing loss [SMA left: F(1,94) = 1.1, p= 0.298; SMA right: F(1,94) = 2.1,
p= 0.152].

3.2.1. Human Motor Area Template (HMAT) Atlas Analysis 
Within the right HMAT SMA VOIs, the 2 × 2 between-group ANOVAs revealed a 
signiﬁcant main e ﬀect of hyperacusis on gray ma tter volumes [F(1,94) = 21.0, p < 0.001], 
with participants scoring above the threshol d for hyperacusis and displaying lower SMA 
gray matter volumes relative to the controls (Figure 3). There was also a trend toward a 
negative main e ﬀect of hyperacusis in the left  hemisphere [F(1,94) = 3.7, p = 0.058] (Figure 
3). However, we found no signi ﬁcant main e ﬀect of hearing loss [SMA left: F(1,94) = 1.0, p 
= 0.329; SMA right: F(1,94) = 0.8, p = 0.774], nor any interaction between the e ﬀects of hy-
peracusis and hearing loss [SMA left: F(1,94) = 1.1, p = 0.298; SMA right: F(1,94) = 2.1, p =

intracranial volume) revealed that hyperacusis has a significant negative main effect on the right
supplementary motor area (SMA) gray matter volumes [SMA right: F(1,94) = 21.0, p< 0.001]. There
was no significant main effect of hearing loss, nor any interaction between the effects of hyperacusis
and hearing loss, on the bilateral SMA gray matter volumes. The presence of hyperacusis was defined
by a cut-off score of ≥22 on the 14-item HQ. The graphs show the mean and 95% confidence interval

3.2.2. Human Brainnetome (HBN) Atlas Analysis
To further examine the effect of hyperacusis on SMA gray matter volumes, we repeated
the analysis using the Human Brainnetome (HBN) atlas, which distinguishes between the
anterior and the posterior SMA. For the anterior SMA (SMA_A6m) VOIs, the 2 ×2 between-
group ANOVAs revealed a significant negative main effect of hyperacusis on the right
anterior SMA gray matter volumes [F(1,94) = 13.7, p< 0.001], but no significant main effect
on the left anterior SMA VOI [F(1,94) = 1.7, p= 0.200] (Figure 4). There was no significant

by a cut-o ﬀ score of ≥22 on the 14-item HQ. The graphs show the mean and 95% con ﬁdence interval

3.2.2. Human Brainnetome (HBN) Atlas Analysis 
To further examine the e ﬀect of hyperacusis on SMA gray ma tter volumes, we re-
peated the analysis using the Human Brainnetome (HBN) atlas, which distinguishes be-
tween the anterior and the posterior SMA. For the anterior SMA (SMA_A6m) VOIs, the 2 
× 2 between-group ANOVAs revealed a signi ﬁcant negative main e ﬀect of hyperacusis on 
the right anterior SMA gray ma tter volumes [F(1,94) = 13.7, p < 0.001], but no signi ﬁcant 
main eﬀect on the left anterior SMA VOI [F(1,94) = 1.7, p = 0.200] (Figure 4). There was no 
signiﬁcant main e ﬀect of hearing loss [SMA_A6m left: F(1,94) = 0.2, p = 0.637; SMA_A6m 
right: F(1,94) = 0.2, p = 0.675], nor any interaction between the e ﬀects of hyperacusis and 
hearing loss [SMA_A6m left: F(1,94) = 0.4, p = 0.521; SMA_A6m right: F(1,94) = 1.6, p = 
0.203] on the anterior (A6m) SMA gray ma tter volumes. 
 
Figure 4. The SMA VOIs were derived from the Human Brainnetome (HBN) atlas (upper panels).
The 2 ×2 between-group ANOVAs (corrected for age, handedness scores, and total intracranial
volume) revealed that hyperacusis has a significant negative main effect on the right anterior (A6a)
SMA gray matter volumes [SMA_A6a right: F(1,94) = 21.0, p< 0.001] and the bilateral posterior (A4ll)
SMA) gray matter volumes [SMA_A4ll left: F(1,94) = 10.5, p< 0.001; SMA_A4ll right: F(1,94) = 14.1,
p< 0.001 ]. There was no significant main effect of hearing loss nor any interaction between the effects
of hyperacusis and hearing loss on the bilateral anterior/posterior SMA gray matter volumes. The
presence of hyperacusis was defined by a cut-off score of ≥22 on the 14-item HQ. The graphs show
the mean and 95% confidence interval (CI). HLT, hearing loss and tinnitus; NHT, normal hearing
and tinnitus.

Brain Sci. 2024 ,14, 726 9 of 13
For the posterior SMA (SMA_A4ll) VOIs, the 2 ×2 between-group ANOVAs revealed a
significant negative main effect of hyperacusis on the posterior SMA gray matter volumes in
both hemispheres [SMA_A4ll left: F(1,94) = 10.5, p< 0.001; SMA_A4ll right: F(1,94) = 14.1 ,
p< 0.001] (Figure 4). Again, no significant main effect of hearing loss [SMA_A4ll left:
F(1,94) = 1.7 ,p= 0.193; SMA_A4ll right: F(1,94) = 1.2, p= 0.269] and no significant inter-
action between the effects of hyperacusis and hearing loss [SMA_A4ll left: F(1,94) = 0.5,
p= 0.478 ; SMA_A4ll right: F(1,94) = 1.1, p= 0.323] were observed on the posterior (A4ll)
SMA gray matter volumes.
3.2.3. Smaller Gray Matter Volumes in Hyperacusis Are Associated with the Attentional
Subscale of the Hyperacusis Questionnaire
As expected, participants with hyperacusis scored higher on both the attentional
and social subscales of the HQ, compared to participants without hyperacusis (Table 1).
Interestingly, significant associations were only observed between the SMA gray matter
volumes (HMAT and HBN VOIs) and the attentional subscale of the HQ (Table 2).

(HMAT and HBN VOIs) and either the attentional or social subscales scores of the HQ across all
participants. The SMA VOIs are shown in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Materials. The statistical
threshold for Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients was set at p≤0.05.

3.2.4. Anxiety, Depression, or Tinnitus Burden Scores Do Not Drive Smaller SMA Gray
Matter Volumes in Hyperacusis
Significant between-group differences were found in the HADS anxiety and depression
and the THI tinnitus burden scores (Table 1). However, we found no significant relationship
between the SMA gray matter volumes (HMAT and HBN VOIs) and either the HADS
anxiety and depression scores or the THI tinnitus burden score (all p≥0.284; more details
are provided in Table S3 in the Supplementary Materials).
4. Discussion
In this study, we investigated whether the previously observed association between
hyperacusis and smaller gray matter volumes in the right supplementary motor area (SMA)
in individuals with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus would also be found
in individuals with tinnitus and clinically normal hearing. Our findings confirmed that
smaller SMA gray matter volumes related to hyperacusis are also present in individuals
with tinnitus and clinically normal hearing. We did not find any interaction between
hearing loss and hyperacusis on the SMA gray matter volumes while controlling for age.
In other words, the smaller SMA gray matter volumes were associated with hyperacusis
and not hearing loss.
The SMA functions in the fields of action preparation, initiation, and inhibition and
is an integral part of the motor network [ 31,32]. Neurons in this area fire prior to the
onset of an action, and a subset of those neurons responds to specific input modalities

Brain Sci. 2024 ,14, 726 10 of 13
(visual, tactile, or auditory) when matched to a motor response [ 33,34]. Our previous work
showed that the SMA is the only brain region to exhibit structural gray matter differences
between groups associated with hyperacusis in tinnitus, and SMA gray matter volumes
could classify participants with or without hyperacusis with high accuracy [ 14]. The
current work extends our previous findings and reveals that the reduction in the SMA
gray matter volumes in individuals with hyperacusis is not the result of hearing loss and
may, therefore, reflect specific changes in the motor response to the perceived loudness of
sound. In this study, we also found that smaller SMA gray matter volumes were primarily
associated with the attentional subcategory of hyperacusis rather than the social subscale,
suggesting that hyperacusis is linked to increased alertness regarding sound. There may be
a correspondence between this heightened alertness and a constant readiness to provide a
motor response to sound.
Our findings are consistent with previous reports in both animal models and humans.
A recent study in mice has connected increased gain along the auditory pathway to invol-
untary facial movements [ 35], which may be related to the structural changes reported here.
Supporting evidence from animal studies shows that hyperacusis-induced animals respond
faster to auditory stimuli, indicating a link between motor activity and hyperacusis [9,36].
Additionally, a study in humans found that facial reaction and pupil dilatation to emotional
sounds could distinguish between participants with or without hyperacusis and tinnitus
who have clinically normal hearing thresholds [ 37]. Furthermore, an EEG study found
increased functional activity in the SMA region in hyperacusis participants [ 13]. Similarly,
participants with misophonia, a condition where very specific sounds (e.g., chewing or
breathing) provoke strong emotional and physiological reactions, showed increased SMA
activity when listening to triggering sounds relative to any other sound, as measured
with an fMRI [ 38,39]. In addition, participants with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
may exhibit heightened sensitivity to sound, which can lead them to develop fixations on
avoiding certain sounds [ 40,41]. Interestingly, OCD has been closely linked with functional
changes, including increased activation, in the SMA region [ 42,43]. Together, these findings
and our study suggest a close association between hyperacusis and the brain network that
is involved in preparing and conducting motor movements.
This study has several limitations. First, this study included a limited number of
participants with tinnitus and clinically normal hearing and a limited number of female
participants. These factors may affect the comparison and generalizability of the findings.
Future research should aim to include larger and more sex-balanced groups. Second,
the study utilized subjective hyperacusis questionnaires. Although these questionnaires
are well-validated [ 25], future research should consider incorporating objective methods,
such as psychoacoustic measurements [ 44], to precisely describe and quantify hyperacusis.
Third, air-conduction tone audiometry was used to define hearing loss in this study. Future
studies could also measure bone-conduction thresholds in order to explicitly differentiate
between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Lastly, future research should also
investigate the effects of the duration of hyperacusis, tinnitus, and hearing loss on changes
in gray matter volumes. Only a few studies have previously examined the impact of
tinnitus duration on gray matter volumes [ 45,46]. To our knowledge, no study has yet
explored changes in response to the duration of hyperacusis or hearing loss (although the
onset of the problem is often difficult to identify). These limitations highlight areas where
future research could improve the study design to enhance the validity of findings related
to gray matter changes in hyperacusis.
5. Conclusions
Our study highlights the importance of understanding the structural mechanisms
underlying hyperacusis, and particularly the role of the SMA in the attentional control
of auditory-motor coordination. By identifying specific brain regions associated with
hyperacusis, we can develop more targeted and effective interventions to improve the
quality of life for those affected by this condition. Future research should continue to

explore the complex interactions between hyperacusis, tinnitus, and hearing loss, as well
as the potential for neuroplasticity-based therapies to mitigate the impact of hyperacusis
on daily functioning.
