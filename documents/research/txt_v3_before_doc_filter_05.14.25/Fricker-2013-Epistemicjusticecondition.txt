Abstract I shall first briefly revisit the broad idea of 'epistemic injustice' , explainin how it can take either distributive or discriminatory form, in order to put the concepts 'testimonial injustice' and 'hermeneutical injustice' in place. In previous work I have explored how the wrong of both kinds of epistemic injustice has both an ethical an an epistemic significance - someone is wronged in their capacity as a knower. But m present aim is to show that this wrong can also have a political significance in relatio to non-domination, and so to freedom. While it is only the republican conception of political freedom that presents nondomination as constitutive of freedom, I shal argue that non-domination is best understood as a thoroughly generic liberal ideal of freedom to which even negative libertarians are implicitly committed, for nondomination is negative liberty as of right - secured non-interference. Crucially on this conception, non-domination requires that the citizen can contest interferences. Petti specifies three conditions of contestation, each of which protects against a salient risk of the would-be contester not getting a 'proper hearing'. But I shall argue that missing from this list is anything to protect against a fourth salient threat: the threat that either kind of epistemic injustice might disable contestation by way of an unjus deflation of either credibility or intelligibility. Thus we see that both testimonial an hermeneutical injustice can render a would-be contester dominated. Epistemic justic is thereby revealed as a constitutive condition of non-domination, and thus of a central liberal political ideal of freedom.

Testimonial injustice happens when a speaker rec to the operation of prejudice in the hearer's judgem a case of 'stop and search' by the police, where a r of the police officer so that a young black male d level of credibility when he declares that he is the of course be a spectrum of cases spanning those i only marginally deflated to those where it is dra cases where (whatever the deflation) it either is or i credibility below the threshold for hearer accept taken far less seriously than it would be absent the sometimes a small credibility deflation is enough rejected.

Hermeneutical injustice occurs at a stage prior to communicative activity, though it will only surface in a certain kind of failed or semi-failed attempt to render an experience intelligible, either to oneself or communicatively to another. This kind of epistemic injustice happens when a subject who is already hermeneutically marginalized (that is, they belong to a group which does not have access to equal participation in the generation of social meanings) is thereby put at an unfair disadvantage when it comes to making sense of a significant area of their social experience. An example might be a woman who attacked or killed a long-term physically abusive partner at a time before the background history of his own violence and intimidation came to be interpretable by reference to the legal category of 'provocation'.

Like testimonial injustice, hermeneutical injustice comes in different degrees of severity, and along more than one dimension. First, there is internal diversity as regards the degree of misunderstanding. At one extreme, even serious domestic violence might once have been culturally, quasi secretly, understood as the violent affirmation of a proper natural hierarchy between 'man and wife' (not forgetting that our rich capacity for incoherence in collective forms of understanding is such that this construal can subsist alongside another, more openly avowed, interpretation to the effect that such violence is appalling). Or, alternatively, a less radical failure of understanding might be illustrated by a situation where such violence is on the whole taken seriously as a criminal offence, yet still not properly dealt with by the relevant institutional bodies owing to confused social meanings surrounding, for instance, the fact that the victim did not leave her violent partner.

Second, hermeneutical injustice is internally diverse in relation to how widespread the failure of understanding is. At the extreme, there can be cases where even the subject herself is radically unable to make sense of her own experience; or, by contrast, there can be cases at the other extreme in which the subject herself is entirely clear what is happening to her, and can perhaps expect to communicate her experience with ease to other members of her community or social group, but (owing to the collective hermeneutical gap pertaining to the wider community as a whole) still cannot expect to communicate it successfully to significant social agencies - notably, relevant institutional bodies - in order to describe or protest the experience. Finally, a third dimension of internal diversity in hermeneutical injustice is that such unfair deficits of intelligibility might be owing either to the inadequately conceptualised the

content , and/or owing to an inadequately unde style of communication.

I have tried in previous work to develop the wrong of both kinds of discriminatory epistemic wrong to any kind of epistemic injustice (incl a matter of the subject being wronged specific subject. In respect of testimonial injustice, thi specified in the idea of the subject's being unjust deficit of credibility); and in respect of idea of the subject's being wronged in their ca unjust deficit of intelligibility). These two for wrong of epistemic injustice are then suppleme more general epistemic ills tend to emanate fro out on knowledge offered, and the decline in the social epistemic system (not only ready-ma also hypotheses, evidence, counter-evidence, ex good criticisms, good questions...). Thus the w individual tends to ramify into wider social epist paper will be to develop a different dimension injustice. I want to explore the possibility that wrongs involved in discriminatory epistemic in internal connection between the positive value of political freedom.

## 2 Not by grace and favour- epistemic justice a

If we think of political liberty exclusively in te interference, it will be hard to discern the epist want to bring out. There is, however, a certain of political freedom that presents us with the c ception that I want to start drawing out the rele political freedom. As the name suggests, the ne be traced back to an ancient republican impetu a form of republicanism for our time are those Skinner presents it as 'a third concept of liberty' primarily in the idea that mere non-interferen and liberties independently from the grace and countable authority.

the parallel which I hope will substanti liberal ideal of freedom.

The parallel in question is with a long debate in epistemology about what, if anything, lends knowledge a distinctive extra value that is not already present in mere true belief. Plato's answer to this question posed by Meno is that knowledge is more valuable because it is less easy to lose, and one understanding of this general idea is that knowledge is less easy to lose in the sense that a knower is normally (some say always) aware of a reason that justifies her belief, so that she is in a better position to avoid losing that true belief in the face of misleading evidence.7 The guiding thought here is that if you value true belief, then you will attribute still more value to secured true belief ' that is, to knowledge. If this parallel is instructive, then what we learn from it is that if we value defacto non-interference, then we will attribute added value to secured non-interference, i.e. to non-domination. It follows from this that the advocate of negative liberty is implicitly committed to attributing added value to nondomination because non-domination is secured negative liberty - non-interference as of right. This is what qualifies non-domination as a generic liberal ideal of freedom rather than as a value of liberty special to advocates of the republican conception.

What this means for present purposes is that the purport of the connections I shall be making out between epistemic justice and non-domination is not dependent upon the specifically republican case for non-domination as the lead conception of political liberty. It is dependent only upon the less partisan idea of non-domination as a generic liberal ideal. Remaining neutral, then, on the question of how best to theorise the primary form of political freedom, I focus on non-domination as a centrally important liberal ideal of freedom which, as I shall argue, depends upon epistemic justice as one of its essential conditions.

On Pettiťs account there can be interferences compatibly with political freedom, such as the requirement to pay income tax, or being imprisoned as a matter of appropriate legal punishment. Interferences such as these are compatible with political freedom to the extent that they are non-arbitrary. What makes interference non-arbitrary? The basic criterion is the one we have already rehearsed by way of Skinner: the interference must not be committed merely at will; that is, the body committing the interference must not be unaccountable. This basic criterion is then refined by reference to the requirement that the interference 'is forced to track the interests and ideas of the person suffering the interference'.8 Crucially, the required conformity to the citizen's interests is specific to those non-peculiar interests held in common with other citizens: 'What is required for non-arbitrary state power... is that the power be exercised in a way that tracks, not the power-holder's personal welfare or world-view, but rather the welfare and world-view of the public.'9

This raises the question what further conditions need to be in place in order to keep the state or other bodies in check when it comes to tracking the impersonal interests of the citizen. The answer is delivered in the condition that the citizen is able

to contest any interference (where 'contest' fe that sham or otherwise institutionally unsatisf that the citizen cannot contest). Contestation, conditions, each of which is designed to stave of citizen's prospect of a fair hearing. They state

- 1. A 'potential basis for contestation'
- 2. A 'channel or voice available by which deci
- 3. A 'suitable forum in existence for hearing

The 'basis' for contestation is really a matter possibilities given are bargain-based contestatio rightly claims that only the latter provides a sui that suits the deliberative democratic purpos outcome of which will depend largely on stre force of argument, the form of exchange requi interference was or was not in tune with the co is the more open-ended and more genuine for and debate.

The second condition, of 'channel or voice', concerns the availability of proper representation. On pain of counting as dominating the citizen, an institutional body must provide for the citizen's being credibly represented so that her case may be properly heard. She may represent herself, or be represented by a suitable third party.

What is needed to give potential contestators voice? What is needed to enfranchise them in more than a purely formal or ceremonial sense? At the level of legislative decision, it is clearly going to be necessary that there are voices that can speak with credibility to the concerns and opinions of every significant group, and that can force those concerns and opinions on the deliberative attention of law-makers. In order to speak with credibility, such voices will have to come from the sector represented , not just resonate in sympathy with that sector..; and so ideally the group will achieve representation, not by grace of senatorial spokespersons, but via the presence of some of its own members. 1 1

Pettit persuasively argues that this condition brings with it a requirement of inclusivity - sufficient social diversity in the adjudicating body - in order to ensure that members of any social group are able to receive a proper hearing. So, for instance, juries and other institutional bodies must be actually socially inclusive in order that no contester will find the odds are stacked against him, trying to make his case to a body composed of people not of his sort, who will not understand.

The third condition of a 'forum' for contestation requires that there be a suitable setting for it, so that contesters can present their case without pressure of any kind likely to distort proceedings. These might be pressures brought to bear by parties with vested interests, who might exercise influence over the adjudicators or intimidate the contester; or again they might be a matter of media intrusion.

10 Pettit (1997), pp. 186, 187.

These, then, are Pettiťs three necessary co a conception of contestation which is, quite safeguards against salient threats to effectiv factor that should figure as a fourth conditi not catered to in Pettiťs treatment. The pro justice prevail in the process of contestatio exchange that constitutes the contestation t subject neither to testimonial injustice, nor what she needs to communicate. Epistemic kinds are requirements for contestation, becau either of credibility or of intelligibility, then that contestation requires.

Whereas Pettiťs second condition - that of 'channel or voice' - concerns the credibility of the relation of representation between citizen and representative, the proposed condition of epistemic justice concerns the credibility and/or intelligibility of what is stated as the content of the contestation - the contesterà word. One intriguing upshot of this is that a citizen can come to count as dominated if her representative suffers epistemic injustice in the course of the contestation, even if the citizen herself would not have. Conversely, a citizen who would have suffered one or other kind of epistemic injustice if he had represented himself, but who is in fact represented by someone who doesn't, may thereby be saved from domination.12 These possibilities are surely no surprise. When people pay for expensive legal representation, this is one of the things they are paying for - a representative who both will not herself suffer testimonial injustice, and/or who will be able to mitigate any effects of hermeneutical injustice on the client's claims, perhaps by finding new words or their uses to make the case (early uses of the 'provocation' defence in respect of a 'battered' woman's killing a violent partner would surely be a case in point).

All this reveals epistemic justice (testimonial and hermeneutical) as a compound constitutive condition not only of contestation, but of non-domination. For republicans this result entails that epistemic justice is a constitutive condition of political freedom itself. I hope this finding may contribute something to republican debate. But I also want to draw the wider conclusion, which is addressed to republicans and advocates of a negative liberty conception alike: epistemic justice is revealed as a constitutive condition of non-domination considered as a generic liberal ideal of freedom.

Let me bring the point home with an illustration of how both testimonial and hermeneutical injustice may disable a contester, thus rendering them dominated. First, I shall consider a specific example of testimonial injustice in which a witness of a serious crime is effectively silenced. In a case where a citizen needs to contest an interference from an individual or group of fellow citizens, as in the case of an assault, the interference does not render the victim dominated so long as contestation is possible. Under a political regime of racial apartheid, for example, a white citizen might assault a black citizen with impunity, with no contestation possible for the black citizen, and thus the victim of the assault would not only suffer the assault itself, but

12 I thank Jules Holroyd for pointing out this possibility to me.

stand in a relation of domination to t a racial prejudice may render a black v political system closer to home. The i the black teenager Stephen Lawrence such example, as is made clear in the subsequently commissioned by the B Report.13

Stephen Lawrence's friend and fellow victim, Duwayne Brooks, was the chief witness of the crime, and was waiting with his grievously wounded friend when the police arrived at the scene. As is made clear by the Macpherson Report, Duwayne Brooks was not properly listened to by the investigating police officers. The report diagnoses that this was owing to the way the police perceived him - as a black youth stereotypically presumed a party to the trouble. But neither Lawrence nor Brooks had been party to any trouble prior to the assault on them in which Stephen received the fatal stab wounds. The attack was a one-sided, unprovoked, explicitly racially motivated assault on two friends waiting together at a bus stop. Racially prejudicial stereotyping, then, distorted police perception of the victims, and forms a crucial part of the explanation why Duwayne Brooks' word was not solicited properly at the scene14, and why he did not receive due credibility from the police when he tried to tell them what had happened. Evidently, the way the investigating officers at the scene perceived and heard the word of Duwayne Brooks lacked testimonial justice. At paragraph 5.1 1 the report says:

[T]he officers failed to concentrate upon Mr Brooks and to follow up energetically the information which he gave them. Nobody suggested that he should be used in searches of the area, although he knew where the assailants had last been seen. Nobody appears properly to have tried to calm him, or to accept that what he said was true. To that must be added the failure of Inspector Steven Groves, the only senior officer present before the ambulance came, to try to find out from Mr Brooks what had happened)5

This case of testimonial injustice rendered someone who was a victim and chief witness of a serious crime disabled as a contester. Duwayne Brooks was prevented by testimonial injustice from contesting the crime that he and his friend had been subject to. Thus Brooks was not only a victim of a violent interference which included the fatal stabbing of his friend, but he was in a relation of domination to the attackers. In this case, the relation of domination is between citizens, though the failed contestation took place between citizen and an institutional body, namely the police. What was needed was some testimonial justice in the fact-finding practices of the investigating police unit - perhaps some kind of institutional virtue of testimonial justice. (I shall turn to what this might involve in the final section of the paper.)

13 See Macpherson (1999).

14 When someone's word is not even solicited owing to prejudice, the testimonial injustice is what I call 'pre-emptive testimonial injustice'. On this point, and for a more detailed discussion of the present case, see Fricker (2012). 14 call

To qualify as possessing a virtue , as opposed t well-functioning (which might be achieved by me mechanisms of an invisible hand) the institutiona well, it must also do so as a result of possessing t Aristotelian account this inner element is a specif end, whereas a more Platonic model will draw commitment, such as a background dispositio However it is conceived, the inner element mu through a range of counter-factual situations f example, a purportedly 'green' business will n being green if the moment it were to meet a c profit motive it would ditch the values to pursue fairly resilient collective value commitment is of a virtuous individual's character; and I prop value commitment in the idea of an organisati organisation's good performance bears an explan good actions are done in significant part becaus key condition of virtue fulfilled - that the goo reason. This is a way of specifying what it is f spirit. I trust there are various specific forms tha my aim in this final section is simply to sketch up possibilities for philosophical thinking about in our institutions.

## 3.1 Joint commitment model

If we take Margaret Gilbert's account of 'joint commitment' , which she uses to explain an array of important social phenomena such as collective intentionality, action, belief,

and political obligation18, we quickly f possibility of collective virtue. Joint com group express willingness, under condi least 'go along with' the intention, actio might be explicit or it might be entirely in the context - in many contexts it mig dissent. The crucial element here is tha individual becomes party to a commit playing their part in sustaining the rel accountable to the other parties - who m at least demand an explanation.

On an account offered by Chris they describe as drawing on a range of Michael Bratman's20, joint intention is have a shared goal; each intends to play to do so partly because of believing the of all this in the group.21 Given that vi significant stability of value commitme tuals (notably those featuring counterv species of group agency could sustain i

It is a significant feature of the joint commit it is non-distributed - that is, every member of inner and outer elements of the virtue (their pa reliable achievement of the good end). But if this very demanding, so that institutional bodies wo are clearly also distributed alternatives available

## 3.2 Distributed model

One can imagine a large institution - say, a university - which incorporates many groups or collectives, such as a governing body, faculties, departments, committees, boards, steering groups, and so on. If the university has a certain good end in its sights - for instance, that of providing good pastoral care to its students - then one structure to facilitate the achievement of this good end might be that the inner aspect of the virtue of care is jointly committed to, while the outer element (the performance, or implementation) is delivered by one of the sub-groups comprising the institution, such as a counselling service. This internal distribution of virtuous labour within the larger institutional body seems to me a perfectly good way for the university itself to possess a virtue, in this case the virtue of care.

Obviously one could modify such examples in order to put the model under strain: what if the good pastoral care were entirely delivered by the sub-part of the whole - just the counselling service itself - with no value commitments being undertaken at another level in the university? Would the university as a whole count as having the virtue of care, or just the counselling service? It seems arbitrary to legislate philosophically, but I am tempted to allow that so long as there is some minimal explanatory relation holding between the good performance and an executive body elsewhere in the university perhaps it formally oversees the service provision - then that would be a sufficiently unified institutional setting for the virtue of the counselling service to be accredited to the university as a whole. A step further would be to consider a case where the

institution commits to good pastoral care for its to achieve this is by sub-contracting to an exte an excellent job. That too strikes me as a bona the virtue of care, provided the requisite stabili performance are in place. But needless to say n

## 3.3 Hybrid-summative model

Now that we have the joint commitment model can see a third possibility, which simply introduc ing that either or both of the sub-groups (the g service) might be bound not by joint commitm commitment. That is to say, we can see that a uisite stability of value commitment - its etho equivalent - simply by way of aggregated indiv end. So we might imagine most of the membe table with their ready-made individual commi for students, but without these commitments e of common knowledge, and never amassing in joint commitment. This aggregative value com generate a virtue, so long as the sum of the i requisite stability.

What these three models show is that we can idea of institutional bodies having virtues. Whe justice - which I have argued to be politically any institutional bodies to which citizens might really doesn't matter whether the institution ac the virtue, or by some other kind of reliable well might say, is the good outcome , the just distribu
