It is often said that fear is a universal innate emotion that we humans have
inherited from our mammalian ancestors by virtue of having inheritedconserved features of their nervous systems. Contrary to this common
sense-based scientific point of view, I have argued that what we have inher-
ited from our mammalian ancestors, and they from their distal vertebrateancestors, and they from their chordate ancestors, and so forth, is not a
fear circuit. It is, instead, a defensive survival circuit that detects threats,
and in response, initiates defensive survival behaviours and supportingphysiological adjustments. Seen in this light, the defensive survival circuits
of humans and other mammals can be conceptualized as manifestations of
an ancient survival function —the ability to detect danger and respond to
it—that may in fact predate animals and their nervous systems, and perhaps
may go back to the beginning of life. Fear, on the other hand, from my
perspective, is a product of cortical cognitive circuits. This conception isnot just of academic interest. It also has practical implications, offering
clues as to why efforts to treat problems related to fear and anxiety are
not more effective, and what might make them better.
This article is part of the theme issue ‘Systems neuroscience through the
lens of evolutionary theory ’.
1. Introduction
That behaviour and evolution are interrelated is hardly a novel idea. Darwin
emphasized it, as did pioneering ethologists such as Niko Tinbergen andKonrad Lorenz. The behaviourists who dominated psychology in the first
half of the twentieth century paid little attention to evolution, but most contem-
porary psychologists and neuroscientists accept it as a key factor that must beaccounted for to explain behaviour.
Efforts to understand the evolution of behaviour in neuroscience often com-
pare closely related groups, such as humans and other mammals, or even othervertebrates. There are obvious reasons for doing so. For example, since the brain
controls behaviour, studies of how brains evolved can help shed light on how
behavioural repertoires evolved. But there are also reasons to look deeper [1,2].
I have spent much of my career working on the brain mechanisms of
emotion, and especially how the brain detects and responds to danger. Roughly
a decade ago, I began to see my work in a new light. This transformation issummed up by the title of the present article, which is a paraphrase of a
quote from the American essayist and poet, Ralph Waldo Emerson [3]. In my
version of Emerson ’s comment, I changed both instances of ‘is’to‘was’. This
stems from the realization that I had come to a few years ago —that danger
must be as old as life itself. This epiphany may seem obvious to those who
have thought long and hard about evolution. But it was an eye-opener to themammalian neuroscientist in me, and prompted me to explore the natural

history of danger in more detail, which I did in my 2019
book, The deep history of ourselves: the four-billion-year story of
how we got conscious brains [2]. Here, I summarize the path
that took me to the science of danger in the first place, andwhy the latter led me to write The deep history of ourselves .I
also consider the implications for our understanding of our
emotions and their maladies.
2. Finding my way to danger
In the late 1970s, I completed my PhD studying conscious-ness in split-brain patients. From this research, my mentor,
Michael Gazzaniga, and I concluded that an important fea-
ture of human consciousness is the maintenance of a senseof mental unity via cognitive interpretations that attribute
meaning and cause to behaviours that are controlled non-
consciously by the brain [4,5]. We speculated that emotionalsystems might be examples of systems that non-consciously
generate behavioural responses, compelling some sort of
interpretive narration to sustain a sense of mental unity.The fact that not much was known about emotions at the
time made it an attractive option for me, given a comment
made by another professor, the comparative anatomist,Harvey Karten, in a graduate seminar on the vertebrate
brain. Karten suggested that students should avoid popular
research topics, such as the role of the visual cortex in percep-tion or the hippocampus in memory. We should, instead find
an interesting but less well-travelled scientific road.
After graduate school, I therefore turned to the brain mech-
anisms of emotion. Because the tools available for studying the
human brain were quite limited at the time, I chose to study
how the brain controls emotional behaviours in rodents.
It’s not as if the brain mechanisms of emotional behaviour
had never been researched. Emotion was actually a popular
scientific topic among physiologists in the first half of thetwentieth century [6 –11]. But when the field of neuroscience
emerged as an independent discipline in the 1970s, cognition
was the rage, and brain researchers were more interested inthe mechanisms underlying processes such perception, atten-
tion and memory, than in emotion.
Although the earlier research had laid an important foun-
dation for understanding the emotional brain, the knowledge
was piecemeal, and mostly focused on what brain areas do,
as if functions were literally localized in areas. The split-brain studies had taught me to think of information flow
through the brain, and my ambition was to map the infor-
mation flow underlying emotional behaviour from sensoryreceptors to motor outputs. Invertebrate researchers, such as
Eric Kandel, had achieved this kind of sensory to motor map-
ping of behaviour in the invertebrate nervous system [12],and I thought that new research tools becoming available
might make this doable in the brains of mammals as well.
3. Circuit busting fear conditioning
I adopted the behavioural procedure called Pavlovian fear
conditioning [13] (this was also one of the tools Kandel
had used). I was not particularly interested in fear, but the
fear conditioning paradigm seemed to have some usefulproperties for studying emotional behaviour. For one thing,
its associative underpinnings are the bread-and-butter mech-
anism by which organisms learn about stimuli that co-occurwith biologically significant events. The result is that the pre-
viously meaningless stimuli come to trigger species-typical
behavioural and physiological responses, allowing the organ-
ism to respond to dangerous stimuli in advance of theirharmful consequences. Also, the responses elicited in lower
mammals are similar to those expressed in humans when
in harm ’s way. Further, much was known about the behav-
ioural principles underlying Pavlovian learning. And
finally, consistent with Karten ’s advice, next to nothing was
known about the neural mechanisms in mammals.
I submitted a grant proposal to map emotional behaviour
pathways in the rat brain using the Pavlovian paradigm, but
it was not funded because ‘emotion is not a neuroscientific
topic’. The way I ended up getting funding was by re-framing
my work as being about the neural basis of learning.
To map the connections of behavioural and physiological
responses that were elicited by Pavlovian conditioned stimuli,
I used axonal transport pathway tracing (which I had picked
up while doing a rotation in Karten ’s lab), as well as some
other methods that I learned ‘on the job ’, such as chemical
lesion approaches and electrophysiological recording tech-
niques, especially in freely behaving animals.
I recall a Society for Neuroscience poster session in the mid-
1980s where there were hundreds of presentations on the hip-
pocampus and memory, and very few (maybe three or four) onthe brain mechanisms of fear conditioning. Although our ranks
were small [14 –16], within a few years, we fear conditioning
researchers had shown that sensory inputs to, and motor out-puts from the amygdala are responsible for the behavioural
and physiological expression of conditioned fear responses.
And importantly , within the amygdala, a systematic patternof synaptic connectivity from the input region (i.e. lateral
nucleus) to the output region (i.e. central nucleus) was
revealed. Further, while synaptic plasticity was found tooccur throughout the amygdala circuitry , plasticity in the lat-
eral amygdala seemed particularly important, based on the
short latency of the neural changes and their necessity in sup-porting plasticity in other areas. Summaries of this body of
work appeared in a 1994 article I wrote for Scientific American
[17], in my 1996 book, The emotional brain [18] and in an
Annual Review of Neuroscience paper in 2000 [19].
By the late 1990s, many researchers were becoming
interested in the neural mechanisms of Pavlovian fear con-ditioning. With the basic circuits outlined, the effort was
turning to the molecular mechanisms that might underlie
learning. Some of the new researchers were from the usualareas of psychology and brain research, but others were from
genetics, where the ability to alter genes was emerging. Over
the next decade or so, accumulated findings implicated specificneurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, protein kinases and
macromolecules in learning and plasticity in the amygdala of
rodents [20 –23]. Many of these findings were guided by earlier
results about learning and memory storage in invertebrates
[24,25], a point that will become relevant below.
4. Three views of fear
As I had hoped when I started this work, the fear conditioningprocedure turned out to be an excellent way to elucidate how
behavioural and physiological responses elicited by emotionalstimuli are learned and controlled non-consciously by the
brain. To emphasize my idea that amygdala circuits processed
information non-consciously , I adopted the implicit/explicitroyalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 377: 202102922
 Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 24 October 2022

distinction popular in learning and memory research [26].
Specifically , I referred to the amygdala as an implicit processor
that controls fear behaviours non-consciously , with the explicit
conscious experience of fear being a product of corticalcognitive circuits [18].
Findings obtained in studies of humans provided support
for the idea that the amygdala non-consciously controls behav-ioural and physiological responses elicited by threats, turning
one of my split-brain ideas into a reality. For example, sublim-
inal presentation of threats resulted in amygdala activation andelicited physiological responses without the person having any
awareness of the stimulus or reporting any feeling of fear
[27,28]. Later studies showed that even when pressed, healthyparticipants did not report emotional feeling states in response
to subliminal emotional stimuli [29]. A related line of research
showed that in the so-called blindsight patients threats alsoelicited amygdala activity and body responses without con-
scious awareness of the stimulus [30]. And studies of patients
with amygdala damage showed that they could still, undersome conditions, have emotional experiences [31,32]. Fear, it
seems, is not inextricably tied to the amygdala in humans.
The amygdala, in other words might contribute to, but doesnot determine, the mental state of fear.
Most researchers working on fear conditioning came to this
topic from a behaviourist intellectual background. I was onceasked by one such colleague, ‘Why do you talk about emotion? ’
He said ‘we just study behavioural learning ’. Given this, why
did behaviourists ever call the procedure ‘fear’conditioning?
Although the behaviourists had banned subjective states
as explanations of behaviour, they did not eliminate the use
of subjective state words in explaining behaviour. Theyreferred to the task as ‘fear’conditioning because fear for
them was a description of the functional relationship between
a dangerous stimulus and defensive behaviour. And whensome behaviourists became physiological psychologists in
the 1950s, the functional relation came to be thought of as a
physiological state, which they called ‘fear’, that connected
the threatening conditioned stimulus to the defensive con-
ditioned response. The amygdala, of course, became the
home of that that mindless fear state [14 –16,33,34].But some researchers rebelled against the sterile con-
ception of behaviour offered by behaviourist approaches
[35–40]. The emotion researchers among them promoted
the idea that rodent fear was more or less like human fear,and therefore that animal studies could be used to under-
stand human emotions. These anti-behaviourist brain
researchers treated subcortical brain areas, like the amygdalaand periaqueductal gray, as being responsible not just for
defensive behaviours but also for the subjective feeling of
fear in animals and humans alike [35].
Both groups of researchers, in other words, used the term
‘fear’to describe functions subserved by subcortical circuits,
but they used the term in different ways. The behaviour-ists–learning crowd did not bother to explain what they
meant. For them, conscious fear was a useless construct
that had been successfully purged from scientific discourse,and any serious scientist knows that ‘fear’is simply a physio-
logical state that controls behaviour. The anti-behaviourists,
on the other hand, made it very clear that fear was consciousfear. The general public, and even other scientists who were
not‘in the know ’, did not realize the difference, and simply
assumed that when a scientist wrote or said ‘fear’they
meant conscious fear. By failing to explicitly define their
terms, the behaviourist crew ’s message was lost.
I was caught in the middle [18,19,41 –43]. I was aligned with
my behaviourist-oriented colleagues in emphasizing that phys-
iological states within amygdala circuits control defensive
behaviour rather than make fearful feelings. But like the anti-behaviourists, I treated conscious fear as real and important.
Yet, I viewed conscious fear as a product of cognitive processes
instantiated in cortical circuits, rather than as a hard-wiredfunction of subcortical areas [18,41,42] (figure 1).
5. Rethinking the emotional brain
Over the years, the amygdala went from being an obscure brainarea of interest to only a handful of neuroscientists to cultural
meme —the‘amygdala fear centre ’. This meme appeared in
novels, movies, songs, self-help books, cartoons and online

merchandise from tee-shirts to amulets to essential oils. Despite
my efforts to draw a distinction between conscious fear and its
behavioural and physiological correlates, my work was often
used as scientific support for the meme, and I was often intro-duced at scientific and lay lectures as having discovered how
conscious feelings of fear arise from the amygdala.
By 2012, it was clear to me that the loose, casual use of
common language terms, especially psychological terms, as
names for scientific constructs, can have a negative impact
on our understanding of scientific findings and their impli-cations. To be perfectly honest, though, I was not always as
clear as I now realize I should have been. I resolved to find
a better way to write and talk about fear and the brain,both to other scientists and to lay audiences.
I published scientific articles with titles like, ‘Rethinking the
emotional brain ’,‘Coming to terms with fear ’and‘Semantics,
surplus meaning and the science of fear ’[44–46], and books
called Anxious [47] and The deep history of ourselves [2]. In these
publications, I argued that the use of mental state terms, like‘fear’, to describe circuits that control behavioural and physio-
logical responses conflates correlation with causation. For
example, fear often occurs when we freeze or flee in a dangeroussituation, but not because a feeling of fear that bubbles up out of
theamygdalaisthe underlying cause oftheresponses. Although
the subjective experience and the objective responses are bothtriggered by the same threat stimulus, I propose that they are
separate consequences mediated by different outputs of the sen-
sory system. One output takes the threat stimulus information tothe amygdala to control behaviour and physiology , and the
other takes it to cortical cognitive circuits as part of the process
of assembling the conscious state we know of as fear.
In these publications, I emphasized that scientists should
strive for conceptual clarity , and I offered a simple solution in
the case of emotions. I suggested that we reserve the use ofmental state terms, like ‘fear’, for the mental state that the
word names, as opposed to using such terms to describe
behavioural and physiological correlates of the consciousexperience of fear. For example, rather than treating amygdala
circuits activated by threats as ‘fear’circuits of either kind
(physiological or subjective), I proposed that they be called‘defensive survival circuits ’(figure 1). After all, they control
both defensive behaviours and the physiological responses
that provide metabolic support for the behaviours in danger-ous situations. I also suggested that the procedure called ‘fear
conditioning ’be referred to as ‘threat conditioning ’.
The fact is that ‘threat ’and‘defense ’were already com-
monly, though inconsistently, used in the field. All I did was
suggest that we use the psychologically more neutral terms,
instead of the one ’s with subjective implications, when refer-
ring to behaviour and body physiology, saving ‘fear’for the
mental state. There has been some progress, but also resist-
ance. A colleague wrote a commentary about one of mypapers [48] saying that following the ideas I have been pro-
moting would take psychiatry back to the dark time when
subjectivity ruled the field [49]. As I will argue below,though, the marginalization of subjective experience is why
the treatment of mental disorders is not more effective.
6. The language of psychology
I am hardly the first to raise questions about scientificterminology of psychology [1,50 –55]. Critics have noted
that psychologists tend to be sloppy with words; thatcategory names can create illusions of understanding; and
that the use of common language terms as names for scienti-
fic constructs can skew our understanding of the underlying
processes. For example, calling the amygdala a fear generator[49], regardless of whether a physiological or subjective
meaning of fear is intended, infects this brain area with sub-
jective properties that it may well not deserve.
It is especially important to be careful when we extrap-
olate across species based on similarity in behaviours in
humans and other animals. When we do this, we are usingour introspections about the relation of our mental states to
our behaviours to explain animal behaviour. The quote
below from the pioneering ethologist, Nico Tinbergen,succinctly summarized the problem some 70 years ago:
‘Hunger, like, anger, fear, and so forth, is a phenomenon that can
be known only by introspection. When applied to another. . .
species, it is merely a guess about the possible nature of the ani-
mal’s subjective state ’. [56, p. 5]
Being careful about the use of common language terms as
names for scientific constructs is more important in the
psychological sciences, including psychological aspects of
neuroscience, than in other areas. For example, no one actu-ally thinks that there is a hedgehog living in the gene of
that name. But people do believe that fear lives in the
amygdala ‘fear centre ’.
I agree with those who propose that the traditional
psychological categories used to conceptualize behaviour
can be problematic [1,57,58]. But I do not think this appliesacross the board. Problems especially arise when mental
state words derived from human introspection [53] are used
to talk about behaviours that do not depend on mentalstates [2,45 –47], both in humans and other animals. In such
cases, brain circuits that control such behaviours inherit the
mental implications of the common language terms.
That said, there is a place for everyday words about mental
states in the psychological and brain sciences. They are the coin
of the mental realm, and are necessary when talking about ourmental lives, even scientifically [51,57,59,60]. Summarizing
such views about the special role of common language in
psychology , I wrote this in my 2015 book Anxious [47, p. 40]:
Physicists, astronomers, and chemists don ’t need to take
seriously commonsense ideas about nature because people ’s
beliefs and attitudes about the stars, matter and energy , and
chemical elements don ’t affect the subject under investigation.
The fact that we commonly say (and some may actually believe)
that‘the sun rises in the east ’does not have any scientific bearing
on the fact that sunrise is an illusion. But psychologists do have topay attention to folk psychology because people ’s common
beliefs about the mind influence their thoughts and actions in
daily life and are thus an important part of what psychology is
all about. Folk psychology is a window into the things that inter-
est people and affect their lives.
7. Deep survival
Amygdala defensive survival circuits are present throughout
vertebrate species [61 –64]. One proposal is that this is a
derived trait that emerged in fish tens of thousands of
years after the first fish arrived [65,66]. Another possibilityis that early vertebrates, in fact, had an amygdala homolog.
That this may be the case is suggested by the work of Sten
Grillner and colleagues on the jawless fish, lamprey, one ofthe oldest living vertebrates [67,68]. In fact, their findings
show striking similarities between the entire forebrains of
lamprey and all other vertebrates. Recent findings showingroyalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 377: 202102924
 Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 24 October 2022

that the vertebrate telencephalon evolved from a brain pre-
cursor region in ancestral chordates implies homology of
these structures. Given this, it is possible that the amygdala,
a region of telencephalon, may also have originated from thisprecursor region [69 –71].
Most invertebrates, though, belong to a separate line of des-
cent. Although their nervous systems are not equipped with anamygdala, they do behave defensively, and have their own
defensive survival circuits. For example, circuits have been
identified that control freezing in flies [72]. This finding wasunfortunately described as being functionally similar to ‘fear’
circuits in mammals and, as such, suggested that it may be
able to shed light on aspects of human ‘fear’. This kind of
prose invites the conclusion by journalists that flies may be
emotional beings with conscious feelings of fear similar to
ours [73]. This is an excellent example of how using the survi-val circuit terminology could have helped avoid unintended
misrepresentation in the press of otherwise important research.
Consistent with the idea of conserved survival circuitry in
diverse animals is the fact that, as mentioned above, some
genes and molecules involved in implicit learning about and
control of behaviours in the presence of threat are conservedin vertebrates and invertebrates. This does not necessarily
mean that having the genes shows that the function is con-
served. But the correlation between the presence of the genesand the function is at least suggestive that similarities in implicit
forms of learning in vertebrates and invertebrates may be due to
a common set of synaptic plasticity-related genes inherited froma common basal ancestor. Research using modern genetic tools,
in fact, supports this suggestion [74 –76].
But the connection runs deeper. Some of these plasticity
genes and molecules are present in radial organisms with dif-
fuse, poorly centralized, nervous systems, like jellyfish and
hydra, which express simple forms of learning [77]. Someof these genes and molecules also exist in sponges, which
lack nervous systems, but may, long ago, have had one [78].
However, the focus on inherited features of nervous systemsmay be the wrong emphasis, as the trend predates neurons
and synapses.
Single-cell protozoa share a common ancestor with ani-
mals. Being unicellular, protozoa could not have ever had a
nervous system [78 –81]. Yet they behave, approaching
useful and avoiding harmful stimuli [82]. This is at leastsuperficially similar to animal behaviour. Also like animals,
they undergo simple forms of implicit learning about biologi-
cally significant stimuli [83], and possess some of the sameplasticity genes and molecules that animals have [74 –76].
And even bacteria approach useful and avoid harmful stimuli
[84] and may even be capable of simple implicit learning [85],but this is not well established.
The key takeaway , though, is not about learning. It is about
behaviour. Darwin ’s protégé Romanes treated behaviour as an
ambassador of the mind [86]. While this, of course, is true to
some extent, behaviour is not fundamentally a psychological
capacity [1,2]. It is simply one of the tools that organisms useto go about the day-to-day business of staying alive.
Bacteria and protozoa, for example, do not approach food
out of hunger or ‘tumble ’away from harmful molecules out
of‘fear’. Such responses are defined by the physical fact
that any movement of an object places it further from or
closer to other objects in the environment, and by the physio-logical fact that such movements support survival in harmful
and beneficial situations, respectively.If withdrawal and approach are universal, life-sustaining
capacities of all extant organisms [87], it follows that such beha-
viours may likely have existed as part of the homeostatic
survival toolkit of early cells, which likely had to movearound to manage their physiological viability in an ever-
changing milieu —as soon as there was life, there was danger.
My inclination after reaching the above conclusions was
to assume that animals inherited fundamental survival beha-
viours related to defense, feeding, fluid regulation and
reproduction from unicellular microbes by virtue of geneticand molecular inheritance. But I realized there was another,
less biologically daunting, way to think about this than to
assume that complex defensive, feeding and reproductivebehaviours of present-day animals were literally inherited
from ancient microbes.
All organisms have to manage energy resources, regulate
intracellular fluids, defend against harm and reproduce, but
the way any one organism does these things depends on the
kind of body its species evolved. For example, different mam-malian species flee from danger by running, flying or
swimming, depending on the kind of locomotory capacities
that evolved with their bodies. In short, behaviours are bau-plan-dependent (species-specific) survival implementations
of universal (species-general) survival requirements. And sur-
vival circuits are the species-specific neural implementation bywhich the behavioural implementation of the universal
requirement is achieved in each animal.
The point is, we should not be looking for how motor fea-
tures of defensive or feeding behaviours were passed on from
bacteria to archaea, and from them to protozoa and from them
to animals. How animals manage survival motorically is essen-
tially an artefact of their species ’body plan. Therefore, what we
need to understand are the physiological substrata of survival
functions that have been maintained across evolutionary tran-sitions to ensure that animals possess body plan-appropriate,
life-sustaining motoric responses that sustain individual life.
8. Human emotional experience
If the conscious mental state of fear in humans is not a pro-
duct of the amygdala defensive survival circuit, how doesit come about? I propose that it comes about much like any
other conscious mental state. Although there are a number
of theories of consciousness [88 –93], I will focus on my cog-
nitive account of mental state consciousness [2,94 –98].
It is sometimes said that emotions like fear are universal.
But I argue that it is danger, not fear, that is universal[19,94,96]. I define fear as a personal, schema-based, narra-
tive-driven, culturally shaped, subjective experience that
occurs in a biologically or psychologically significant situation(figure 2). Schema are collections of memories about specific
kinds of situations in life that underlie our thoughts, feelings
and actions in life.
The key idea is that conscious experience, whether
emotional or not, is always preceded by non-conscious (pre--
conscious) cognitive processing of sensations and memories,including schema, that results in a mental model of the situ-
ation. In an emotional situation, such as fear, brain and body
consequences of threat-elicited survival circuit activationbecome part of the model. The output of the model is a
non-conscious narration (which can be verbal and/or non-
verbal). The narration then supplies the content of theroyalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 377: 202102925
 Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 24 October 2022

conscious experience, and separately, the content of verbal
report. Because conscious experience and verbal report involve
different downstream circuits, verbal report does not always
perfectly reflect the person ’s experience.
Nevertheless, verbal report is the most reliable means,
the gold standard, for assessing consciousness in humans
[99–102]. The importance of verbal report was recognized
in the late nineteenth century by the pioneering brain scientist
David Ferrier, who lamented the absence of verbal report in
monkeys and the limits that this lack imposed on his abilityto study conscious perception in them [103]. The use of
verbal report in studies of human consciousness will be
discussed further below.
This perspective on emotion, of course, relates back the con-
clusion that Gazzaniga and I drew from our studies of split-
brain patients —that an important feature of human conscious-
ness is the maintenance of a sense of mental unity via cognitive
interpretations that attribute meaning and cause to behaviours
that are controlled non-consciously by the brain. In extendingour ideas to emotional consciousness, we built on Schachter
and Singer ’s cognitive theory of emotion [104], which I con-
tinue to do in spirit, if not substance, as do many othercurrent cognitive theories of emotion [105 –111].
A popular cognitive approach theory of emotion takes a
constructionist perspective [105,112,113]. My approach fallsroughly into this camp to the extent that it treats conscious
emotions as cognitive conceptions that are assembled in the
moment, rather than being elicited as innate mental states. Iwas on this track long before it carried the constructionist label.
The typical constructionist perspective views the con-
ceptions underlying emotions as the result of interactionsbetween two generalized activities in the brain, valence and
arousal, and minimizes the importance of innate, species-
typical processes. This reflects constructionists ’battles with
the so-called basic emotions theories, which treat core
emotions like fear —including the conscious experience of
fear—as innate products of subcortical circuits [35]. My
model falls between basic and constructionist theories.
Like basic emotions theories, I emphasize innate circuits
(in my case defensive survival circuits rather than fear cir-cuits) that control behavioural and physiological body
responses elicited by threats. But unlike basic emotionalists,
and like constructionists, I view the conscious experience offear as a product of cortical, cognitive activity. Unlike tra-
ditional constructionists, though, I think of arousal and
valence as activities triggered by the particular innatesurvival circuit that is active at the moment. For example,
arousal, rather than being a purely generalized activity that
occurs in any biologically significant situation, has elements
that are tailored to current circumstances by the active survi-val circuit. Donald Pfaff has argued for something similar in
relation to arousal —that it has specific and generalized
components [114].
Another way my model differs from constructionist
and other cognitive theories of emotion is that I have situated
it within the higher-order framework of consciousness[88,90,115]. This class of theories proposes that conscious
experiences result from the higher-order re-representation,
hence conceptualization, of lower-order information. In thebrain, the hypothetical higher-order network involves regions
of lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), including dorsal and ventral
lateral PFC and the lateral frontal pole. For example, the con-scious experience of an apple, in this theory , reflects the lateral
PFC re-representation of lower-order visual cortex states.
Contemporary theories of consciousness, including
higher-order theories, seldom consider the role of memory
in consciousness. But without semantic memory, and
especially memory-based schema [116,117], the sensory rep-resentation of an apple is not meaningful as an instance of
the fruit of that name [118]. My multistate representation
model makes memory an essential underpinning of higher-order consciousness, including emotional consciousness
[94,96 –98] (figure 3).
In the brain, for memory to impact visual perceptual
consciousness, the activity of temporal lobe memory systems
must be integrated with the sensory signals. A key way this
occurs is by way of interactions between sensory cortex andtemporal lobe areas, especially medial temporal lobe regions
such as the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex [119].
Schema, in fact, are believed to be assembled and used byway of hippocampal interactions with medial PFC [117].
These sensory –memory representations, including schema,
are then further represented by connections with prefrontalcortex areas, including the orbital, ventral medial and anterior
cingulate areas located in the medial wall of the hemispheres,
and the insula cortex buried deep in the Sylvian fissure. Eachof these, in turn, interact with lateral PFC areas (dorsal and
ventral latera and frontal pole), by way of various intra-
PFC connections [120], as discussed in detail elsewhere[2,90,94,96]. In the context of my higher-order theory , the
medial wall and insula areas are considered ‘intermediate ’
between sensory/memory circuits and lateral PFC areas.

These intermediate areas have been implicated not just in
memory re-representation, but also in the encoding of body
state signals, stimulus and response values, and self [94]. In
the view presented here, such representations are not sufficient,on their own, and must be further represented by lateral PFC
for the kind of higher-order awareness we humans experience.
But this is hypothetical, and a higher-order account based onthe intermediate areas is also imaginable.
If human emotions are cognitive processes, what makes
them different from non-emotional cognitive states? Quitesimply, the higher-order network re-represents additional
lower-order information when the stimulus is an emotional
one. For example, in fear, the consequences of amygdaladefensive survival circuit activation in the brain (i.e. arousal)
and body (visceral and somatic signals that feed back to the
brain) are often also re-represented in the medial/insulaPFC areas mentioned above. Aspects of the various prefrontal
representations are then further integrated in the lateral PFC
as a higher-order re-representation of diverse lower-orderstates. The emotional experience, therefore, depends not just
on PFC but also on the entire cascade of non-conscious
sensory, mnemonic/conceptual and survival circuit proces-sing that is antecedent to PFC areas. It bears repeating that
every conscious state is, until its last moment of fruition,
non-conscious.
Other primates have similar, though less developed,
lateral and medial/insula areas, while non-primate mammals
mainly possess the medial/insula areas [2,96,121]. This ana-tomical situation may limit the kinds of conscious
emotional states each can assemble relative to humans [96],
as elaborated later.
The reason that amygdala survival circuits are so often
associated with fear is because of their prominent role in con-
trolling defensive responses when humans or other animalsare in danger of bodily harm from predators. As we have
seen, this brain function runs deep in the vertebrate lineage.
However, predator danger is only one of the many kinds
of situations that can cause fear. If you are trapped on amountain top without food, water, or shelter, body signals
indicating low reservoirs of nutritional/energy supplies or
fluids, or low body temperature, can lead to fear of deathby starvation, dehydration or hypothermia. In humans, fear
can also arise from being near someone with an infectious dis-
ease, or the news that you may have a life-threateningcondition, or from family stress, social abuse, job insecurity,
political instability or just about anything imaginable —threats
do not have to be real to make one feel afraid or anxious. Theonly way to account for all of these under a single concept of
fear is by way of cognitive interpretation of the situation in
which you find yourself, or that you imagine you could bein. Innate states just would not do the trick.
9. The problem of animal consciousness
The question of how emotions come about in the brain of ani-mals is subset of the thorny question of animal consciousness.
I have written extensively about this [2,42,44,46,47,96] and
can only touch on some of the key points here.
The question of whether non-human organisms are
conscious, including mammals, lower vertebrates and invert-
ebrates, and if so how, is quite contentious. The issues are farmore complex than trying to find evolutionary roots of beha-
viours. We can directly measure behaviour in present-day
organisms to obtain clues about what kinds of behaviours mayhave been present in their early representatives, and in the
common ancestors they share with other organisms, in much
the same as we do with brain structures. Consciousness,

though, is more challenging. Whether even our closest primate
relatives are conscious is debated [122,123]. The problem is
that behaviour and physiology have limits as measures of con-
sciousness [124], especially when only non-verbal behaviour isavailable, as discussed further below.
In the late nineteenth century, animal psychology tried
to use intelligent and emotional behaviour as marks ofconsciousness [86]. This, in part, is what led to behaviourism.
With the behaviourists gone, some animal psychologists have
revived such efforts. While the behaviourists certainly wenttoo far, they were quite effective, if too dogmatic, in mana-
ging the language of psychology. And with them gone, we
are back to the semantic ‘wild west ’of the late nineteenth
century.
Part of the problem is that the evaluation of consciousness
in animals, whether in mammals [35] or molluscs [125], isoften based on intuitions and beliefs derived from one ’s
understanding of their own behaviour, mind and/or brain.
When the claims match common sense and lore, they feel cor-rect, and when they are repeated authoritatively in scientific
or lay communities, they come to be assumed as indisputable
facts. This does not mean that other animals are unconsciousrobots. It simply means the behavioural data held up as proof
of mental states are often not. The widespread assumption
that innate defensive behaviours are a fool-proof reflectionof conscious feelings of fear is a case in point.
According to J. S. Kennedy, author of The new anthropo-
morphism ,‘Anthropomorphic thinking …is built into us …It
is dinned into us culturally from earliest childhood. It has pre-
sumably also been ‘pre-programmed ’into our hereditary
make-up by natural selection, perhaps because it proved tobe useful for predicting and controlling the behavior of
animals ’[126, p. 5]. Our language, he says, is inherently
anthropomorphic, and, as a result, our concepts and thoughtstend to lean in this direction as well. Kennedy concludes that
anthropomorphism is part of human nature. This is perhaps
why we all see human-like emotions in our pets. Me included.We do not have to be rigorous scientists every moment of
waking life —but we must when we are being scientists.
At the turn of the twentieth century, when anthropo-
morphic approaches were commonplace in comparative
psychology, Herbert Spencer Jennings, who studied the be-
havioural repertoire of single-cell protozoa, put it this way:‘IfAmeoba were a large animal, so as to come within the every-
day experience of human beings, its behavior would at once
call forth the attribution to it of states of pleasure and pain,of hunger, desire and the like ’[82, p. 336]. But beyond such
general tendencies toward anthropomorphism, each scientist
also comes to his or her career with personal biases and dispo-sitions. As the philosopher Bertrand Russell once noted, ‘All
the animals that have been carefully observed have behaved
so as to confirm the philosophy in which the observer believedbefore his observations began ’[127, pp. 29 –30].
Often, proponents of animal consciousness argue by
analogy with human behaviour. This has been criticizedby many on the grounds that it tends to ignore ‘leaner ’alterna-
tives that explain behaviour without recourse to consciousness
[122,123]. The critics do so, not to deny consciousness in non-human animals, but in the spirit of fostering a more rigorous
scientific evaluation of what the data allow us to conclude
about consciousness on the basis of behaviour alone.
Problems especially arise when the claims, rather than
being treated as opinions or hypotheses, are presented asindisputable facts that are presumed to be so obvious that no
reasonable person could question them. And those who
show interpretative restraint are denigrated as ‘deniers ’[128],
a term that has a variety of negative connotations in contem-porary culture, and that is not suitable in a scientific debate.
Similar issues exist when evaluating consciousness in pre-
verbal children. Just because an infant human, or a rat, bird,lamprey, amphioxus or octopus, behaves to an environmental
stimulus in a way that an adult human might when they are
conscious of a similar kind of stimulus does not necessarily
mean that the child or animal is having a conscious experi-
ence, a mental state, similar to what the adult human has.
They may,
and in some cases, likely, have some kind of con-
scious experience. But how can we truly know if they do,
and if they do, what it is like for them?
To get around this conundrum one often has to make com-
promises about what is acceptable as scientific support for the
hypothesis. At the end of the day , claims of consciousness in
animals and human infants often rest more on intuitions andbeliefs than on data, since there are often equally compelling
non-conscious explanations of the behaviour [122,123].
Why are we on any firmer ground studying consciousness
in human adults than in adult animals? Two points are crucial.
One is that barring a congenital brain disorder, all humans have
brains with same basic structural components and functionalcapacities. Given that, if I am conscious of my mental states
and actions, I can with some confidence assume that you
have this capacity as well. Like any species trait, consciousnesswill vary across individuals, but will be present, or at least is
potentially present, in all members of our species.
The second point is that we humans can report on our
conscious sates verbally or non-verbally , but can only report
on non-conscious states non-verbally. Other animals, and
human infants, lacking the ability to verbally report, only havenon-verbal means of responding to both conscious and non-
conscious states. There is, therefore, no easy way to distinguish
conscious and non-conscious states using non-verbal behaviouralone. Given the points I made above about the shortcomings of
behaviour as an index of consciousness, even in humans, we
have a significant methodological barrier. Obviously , the impor-tance of verbal report as a methodological tool should not be
taken to mean that human infants or language-impaired
adults or non-human animals lack consciousness.
10. An empirical approach to animal
consciousness
To be clear, even if repetitive, I do not deny consciousness
in other animals. I am perfectly comfortable saying that
some animals likely have conscious experiences, despite themethodological barriers that prevent clear proof. Yet, even
if they are conscious, they would not be conscious in the
ways we are. After all, human bodies differ in unmistakableways from the bodies of other animals, including the bodies
of our closest primate relatives. Similarly, our brains differ
in important ways from the brains of other primates cousins[129–132], and theirs from other mammals [121,133]. It
should, therefore, not be controversial to suggest that their
mental states, including their emotional states, may alsodiffer from ours.
Yet, in the light of the methodological issues, how
would we ever know what the experiences of other animalsroyalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 377: 202102928
 Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 24 October 2022

are like? One way might be to use understanding of con-
scious experiences and their representation in the human
brain as a basis of understanding what kind of consciousnessother animals might, and might not , possess, given the ways
that their brains are like, and different from, ours. I explored
this idea in relation to other primates and other mammals ina recent publication [96] and will summarize and extend
these suggestions below.
It is important to start by pointing out that the word ‘con-
sciousness ’is often used as if it has a single referent. But it
does not, and this has caused much confusion. At a mini-
mum, it is important to distinguish ‘creature consciousness ’
from ‘mental state consciousness ’[88] (table 1). The former
refers to the condition of being awake and behaviourally
responsive to environmental stimuli. All bilateral animalshave creature consciousness. Mental state consciousness, on
the other hand, is the condition of actually experiencing the
world and one ’s relation to it using mental models. It is cru-
cial to keep this distinction in mind when evaluating claims
of consciousness in animals, as some claims are primarily
about creature consciousness.
For example, a much cited paper by Merker [134] defined
consciousness as the state of being awake and responsive to
sensory stimuli (i.e. creature consciousness). He used findingsfrom patients with limited cortex due to hydrocephaly , and
decorticated rats, as core components of his evidence. In
these instances, and others he cites, consciousness is judgedby sensory –motor responsiveness, not by evidence of mental
states. In response to commentaries on his views, he says he
is not interested in adult human consciousness (presumablycognitive-based mental state consciousness) but something
more primitive. This implies that here he is referring to some
kind of primitive mental state rather than creature conscious.But what would this be? Perhaps he meant a form of sensory
sentience, which Lacalli proposed may have even existed in
the invertebrate chordate ancestors of vertebrates [70,71]. Iwill build on a partition offered by Endel Tulving [135] that I
have used in recent publications [2,94,96 –98]. It may be able
to account for what Merker might have had in mind, but inrelation to mental state consciousness.
Tulving distinguished between three forms of mental
state consciousness in humans (table 1). These are autonoetic(explicit self-awareness of one ’s existence over time), noetic
(explicit awareness of facts and concepts about the world or
one’s self) and anoetic (implicit awareness of the world)[2,94,96 –98,135,136]. The first two are cognitive (i.e. based
on episodic and semantic explicit memory) and the third is
procedural (i.e. based on implicit learning). Another way of
saying this is that autonoetic and noetic consciousnessdepend on the use of internal representations and mental
models, but anoetic consciousness does not [96].
Because anoetic consciousness is not an intuitive idea,
two clarifications are in order.
First, although ‘procedural ’and‘implicit ’traditionally
imply ’non-conscious ’states, in the case of anoesis, non-
conscious does not mean completely unconscious. Anoetic
states reside on the ‘fringe ’or‘penumbra ’of the ‘stream of con-
sciousness ’, to use William James ’terms [137], where the line
between conscious and unconscious is fuzzy. In humans,
these states are typically overshadowed by cognitive con-sciousness and go unnoticed [136]. But they are neverthelesspresent, and noticeable when cognitively attended to. They
co-occur with cognitive states of consciousness and give
these a feeling of ‘warmth ’and‘intimacy ’, again borrowing
from James. They underlie your ability to know that
your mental and body states are yours, without you ever
having to explicitly affirm this [96,98,138]. The second clarifica-tion is that Tulving treated anoetic consciousness as a primitive
awareness about the external world. However, I [96] and
others [136] have proposed that penumbral/fringe anoeticstates also represent the internal milieu (i.e. physiological
conditions of the body and brain). Such anoetic states may
be what Merker had in mind when he referred to a primi-tive kind of consciousness that is different from adult
human consciousness.
The reason I am devoting so much discussion to Tulving ’s
partitions of conscious mental states is because I believe that
understanding their representation in the brains of humans
might give us insights into the processes the underlie mentalstateconsciousness inotheranimals, especially those inourevol-
utionary past [2,96]. In particular, although we cannot directly
measure consciousness in other animals, Tulving ’st h r e es t a t e s
offer an indirect way in —because the three states depend on be-
haviourally measurable episodic, semantic and procedural
memory processes, these provide pre-conscious proxies thatcan be studied in non-human species.
Researchers have used behavioural measures of episodic
memory to ask whether primates, rodents and birds mighthave this capacity [119,139 –142], which is so prominent in
humans. Such behavioural studies can thus test the cognitive
underpinnings of autonoetic consciousness in animals, butcannot measure autonoetic consciousness itself. To acknowl-
edge this, the term ‘episodic-like ’memory is often used [140].
The key difference is that episodic/episodic-like memory isabout what happened and when and where it happened,
while autonoetic consciousness is about reflective awareness
of one ’s self over time in such episodes. Episodic-like
memory, in short, takes researchers all the way to the finish
line of consciousness. This is a significant achievement,
despite not being able to cross the line.
Similarly, semantic memory has been well researched in
primates and other mammals. For example, studies of object
recognition in relation to instrumental-goal directed beha-viours test what animals cognitively know factually and
conceptually [119,143 –146]. Procedural memory has also
been extensively studied in primates and mammals[26,119,147]. As with episodic memory, studies of semantic
and procedural memory tell us about the foundation ofTable 1. Partitioning consciousness.

behaviourally responsive to sensory stimuli)

feelings, and/or actions)

entity with a past, present and possible future)

noetic and anoetic awareness, but do not demonstrate that the
awareness itself exists.
Tulving ’s partitions thus offer a top-down (reverse engin-
eering) approach that starts with human consciousness, asopposed to bottom-up (forward engineering) evolutionary
approaches to animal consciousness that start in the distant
past [35,70,71,125,136]. An advantage of the top-downapproach is that it explicitly identifies how consciousness
might differ in different animals in our evolutionary past rela-
tive to our kinds of consciousness, based on similarities anddifferences in their brains and ours. In other words, our
kind of consciousness tells us what to look for. Clearly, the
further back we try to look, the harder it gets to use humanconsciousness to understand possible states of consciousness
in other animals. But given the striking similarities in the
detailed organization of the forebrain in all vertebrates[67,68,148], and the known involvement of homologous cir-
cuits in the relevant learning processes, we have some basis
for speculating about the underpinnings of consciousness.
In humans, much is known about the neural basis of
explicit (episodic and semantic) and implicit (procedural)
memory [26,119,149 –152]. The brain areas involved in the
encoding of episodic memories include regions of the hippo-
campal formation, regions of medial PFC (anterior cingulate
and ventromedial PFC) and regions of lateral PFC (dorsolat-eral and polar PFC). For semantic memories, including
schema, the lateral prefrontal areas involved are the same
as in episodic memory, but some areas of the hippocampalformation differ (parahippocampal in episodic; perihinal in
semantic), and some areas of medial PFC also differ (anterior
cingulate in episodic; media orbital in semantic). The ventro-medial PFC then connects both anterior cingulate and media
orbital to lateral PFC areas. Note that these are not simply
one-way cascades, as there are reciprocal connections ateach step.
Implicit procedural memory does not involve a single
system, but instead is stored in circuits that process stimuliand/or control responses. For example, plasticity in sensory
and motor cortex in sensory –motor learning; the amygdala
in Pavlovian threat conditioning; and the basal ganglia ininstrumental habit learning [19,26,153 –157].
Non-human primates have homologs of many the areas
implicated in episodic and semantic memory, with the poss-ible exception of the lateral polar PFC [130,158,159]. At a
minimum, this allows primates to use non-verbal episodic
and semantic memory (including schema) to create mentalmodels and use these to guide responses to recognized
objects. Similarly, procedural circuits are quite similar in in
non-human primates and humans.
Other mammals possess homologues of the medial areas
involved in non-verbal episodic and semantic memory
present in primates and humans, but lack homologs of lateralPFC areas [121,133]. They thus must depend on hippocampal
formation interactions with medial PFC for memory re-rep-
resentations. Procedural circuits in mammals are largelyhomologous with those in non-human primates and humans.
The interim conclusion from this discussion is that the
three kinds of memory/learning processes discussed reflectphylogenetic elaborations of the PFC over the evolutionary
history of mammals. The implication is that the three kinds
of conscious states associated with these memory processesmay have followed the same evolutionary course, either aris-
ing in tandem with the memory/learning circuits, or becauseof their existence. However, extension to consciousness
remains hypothetical.
Can we take these ideas to lower vertebrates? An entry
point for this may be the suggestion by Shepherd and othersthat, in mammals, olfactory paleocortex, via connections with
medial wall cortical areas, especially orbitofrontal cortex,
plays a role in olfactory consciousness [160 –162]. But what
kind of consciousness might that be? Following Tulving ’s
scheme, it can be called anoetic olfactory consciousness. Also
of note is that olfactory paleocortex and orbitofrontal cortexare both connected with the amygdala in mammals. This
suggests the possibility that orbitofrontal re-representation of
olfactory-triggered amygdala states might constitute anoeticexperiences about the biological significance of olfactory
stimuli, and of the bodily consequences that co-occur with
these significant stimuli. But diurnal mammals also rely onother senses, and these also activate the amygdala, allowing
a wider range of anoetic states via cortical re-representation.
Early vertebrates possessed a medial pallium, a primitive
homologue of the mammalian hippocampus, that received
olfactory and visual inputs and created and stored spatial rep-
resentations that guided navigation and foraging [148,163 –
165]. If the amygdala homologue in early vertebrates was
also connected with the medial pallium, re-representation of
sensory and amygdala activity by the medial pallium mayhave supported both olfactory-based anoetic sensory experi-
ence, and amygdala-based anoetic experience of biologically
significant stimuli. Given that they lack medial PFC homol-ogues, medial pallium re-representation of sensory stimuli
would have been the sole basis for sensory and amygdala
informed experiences. As a result, such a state would likelyhave been even more primitive than anoetic experiences in
mammals.
If the above is roughly correct, it would have an important
implication. Namely , the medial pallium ’s capacity to acquire
and retain spatial maps may have paved the way in mammals
for additional functions of the hippocampus. In particular, Ihave in mind its capacity to form and store complex semantic
memories and schema, and, via re-representation in medial
PFC, to create mental models that underlie non-verbal noeticconscious awareness of the meaning of stimuli and responses
in light of their value in survival situations. In non-human pri-
mates, and the evolution of lateral PFC, more elaborateexecutive functions may have enabled more complex forms
of non-verbal behavioural control and noetic awareness.
Further expansion of lateral PFC in humans, includingenhanced executive functions and top-down control, and the
invention of language, may have ushered in verbal noesis
and autonoesis.
So far, I have described how different kinds of conscious-
ness may have evolved in vertebrates. But this discussion
begs the question of what might be the functional advantage
of consciousness? The most general answer is that conscious-
ness opens up novel forms of behavioural control [166]. But
let me be more specific. Following the evolutionary threadjust discussed, in early vertebrates, non-cognitive anoetic con-
sciousness may have provided important advantages in
navigation and foraging, including novel processing capacitiesfor sensing the world, learning relations between sensory pro-
cessing and biologically significant stimuli, and selection of
actions based on past consequences [167]. With cortical expan-sion in mammals, and then primates, additional survival
advantages related to behavioural control may have comeroyalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 377: 2021029210

with more complex anoetic and novel cognitive (noetic)
consciousness, with the latter involving the use of mental
models. And in humans, with still further cortical expansions
and the addition of language, verbal-based cognitive noesisand autonoesis have allowed us to know ourselves as entities
with a past and present, and also to anticipate possible futures.
Regardless of whether actual states of consciousness can beexperienced in non-human animals, the evidence described
shows the kinds of neural underpinnings that may underlie
the evolutionary past of anoetic, noetic and autonoetic con-sciousness in humans, and perhaps in some non-human
animals as well.
These ideas are, of course, highly speculative. But by link-
ing the speculations to facts about the structure and functions
of the human brain, and following the evolutionary history of
the relevant structures underlying different kinds of con-scious experiences in humans back in history, we may have
at least some empirical grounding for such speculations.
11. Mental disorders put things in perspective
One of the factors that has motivated my efforts to reconceptua-
lize fear is the much-discussed failure of the pharmaceutical
industry to find better treatments for problems related to fear
and anxiety [168,169]. The typical approach to drug discoveryis to test animals, often rodents, using ‘fear-like ’or‘anxiety-
like’behavioural tasks and administer compounds to them.
The assumption is that because we inherited our ‘fear’circuit
from our mammalian ancestors, and because this circuit both
assembles feelings of fear and controls behavioural and phys-
iological responses in danger, it should be the case that drugsthat make rats less timid behaviourally and less physiologically
aroused should make people less fearful or anxious.
Yet, despite decades of research, new, better treatments
were seldom found [170]; drugs that showed promise in ani-
mals often flopped in human clinical trials [171], and while
those that made it into circulation may have had fewer sideeffects, they were at best only as effective as the older ones.
As a result, Big-Pharma has been withdrawing funding for
research on fear and anxiety, and also depression [168,169].
Given the various points made earlier, it seems unrealistic
to have expected that drugs that change the behavioural or
physiological responses in rodents would be the solution tothe problem of how to make people feel subjectively less
fearful or anxious. The more realistic expectation is that
behavioural (avoidance) and physiological (hyperarousal)symptoms might be dampened, since that ’s what we know
with confidence the drugs did in the laboratory studies. But
if an anti-anxiety medication makes you less jittery and avoi-dant, but you still feel anxious, the treatment is not living up
to the promise of its name.
To be fair, some drugs give some people some psycho-
logical relief. But the question is, does this result from the
medication turning off a fear or anxiety circuit in the brain,
or is it because it has indirect effects on feelings of fear oranxiety? Specifically, the psychological relief, when it
occurs, could be secondary to other changes that affect fearful
and anxious feelings. For example, some relief could comefrom alteration of defensive survival circuits that control be-
havioural and physiological symptoms, and/or alteration of
somatic and visceral motoric control circuits in the brainstem,the spinal cord or the periphery that are the final paths to
the symptoms.
Clearly, such indirect effects are useful to the patient. And if
changing such symptoms was the expectation, the industry ,treatment community and patients might view the medications
as a rousing success, since they would be understood as doing
what they were designed to do in the animal studies, ratherthan not doing what they were incorrectly advertised to do.
Another possible account of positive effects, at least for medi-
cations like benzodiazepines, on anxious feelings is generalemotional blunting, rather than a specific reduction in anxiety ,
resulting from sedative effects consequent to enhancing
GABAergic inhibitory neural activity in widespread areas ofthe brain [172].
It matters that we figure out how treatments work. Other-
wise, we will never advance the cause of finding the besttreatment, given the patient ’s particular problems. The fact
is, what people really want from any kind of therapy is to
feel better subjectively. The best way to improve this likeli-hood would be to put the mental back into mental
disorders [48,173,174].
12. Conclusion
The survival circuits of mammals are neural implementationsof ancient and necessarily persistent physiological survival
requirements that have allowed organisms throughout thehistory of life to move in ways that extended their life
beyond the present moment in biologically significant situ-
ations. The consequences of survival circuit activation canindirectly modulate conscious feelings. But they do not, on
their own, define the conscious content of feelings. Feelings,
instead, are cognitive interpretations of significant situationsthat we encounter in life. Although I had some inkling of
these conclusions decades ago from studying split-brain
patients, it was my decades of work on rodents that allowedme to see the field the way I do today. The approach I offer
here, based on a distinction between ancient defensive survi-
val circuits that control behavioural and supportingphysiological responses, and more recent cognitive circuits
that assemble conscious feelings of fear, seems at least
worth considering as a possible way forward.
The bottom-line general conclusion I would like to end
with is that our understanding of a psychological process in
the brain is only as good as our conceptualization of whatthat process is. If we do not know what we are looking for,
we will never find it. And as we search for knowledge
about psychological processes in the brain, we should onlyuse mental state words to refer to mental states. Additionally,
we should refrain from attributing behavioural control to
mental states, whether in humans or other animals, withoutcompelling evidence. It is of course acceptable to speculate
about the mental lives of other animals, which I have done
my share of in this article. But when we speculate, weshould be clear that we are doing so. I hope that I have at
least achieved this.
