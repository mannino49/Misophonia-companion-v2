## Abstract

Misophonia, a disorder characterised by an extreme sensitivity to certain sounds, is increasingly being studied in cross-cultural settings. The S-Five scale is a  multidimensional psychometric tool initially developed to measure the severity of misophonia in English-speaking populations. The scale has been validated in several languages, and the present study aimed to validate the European Portuguese SFive scale in a Portuguese-speaking sample. The scale was translated into Portuguese using a forwardbackwards translation method. The psychometric properties of the S-Five scale were evaluated in a sample of 491 Portuguese-speaking adults. Exploratory factor analysis, supported by confirmatory factor analysis, revealed a five-factor structure consistent with previous versions of the S-Five scale. The five factors were: (1) internalising appraisals, (2) externalising appraisals, (3) perceived threat and avoidance  behaviour,  (4)  outbursts,  and  (5)  impact  on  functioning.  The  satisfactory  psychometric properties of the S-Five scale further indicated its cross-cultural stability. As a psychometrically robust tool, the S-Five can measure misophonia in Portuguese-speaking populations, allowing future studies to explore and compare misophonia in this population.

## Introduction

The literature has increasingly reported an inappropriate and disproportionate reaction to specific everyday sounds (Ferrer-Torres &amp; Giménez-Llort, 2022; Potgieter et al., 2019). The complex disorder, termed misophonia, elicits intense physiological and emotional responses and is characterised by a highly  decreased  sound  tolerance  (Jastreboff  &amp;  Jastreboff,  2001;  Swedo  et  al.,  2021).  The  trigger stimuli  and  the  reactions  experienced  are  widespread,  varying  by  individual;  frequently  reported organic sounds include eating, breathing, chewing and nasal sounds. However, non-organic sounds (such as machine humming and clock ticking) have also been reported (Erfanian et al., 2019; FerrerTorres &amp; Giménez-Llort, 2022; Hansen et al., 2021; Jager et al., 2020; Larsen et al., 2022; Norris et al., 2022; Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, Erfanian, et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2014). Tigger sounds tend to be pattern-based and repetitive (Edelstein et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2017; Norris et al., 2022; Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, Erfanian, et al., 2021), and reactions can be influenced by the context and the particular meaning that sound has to the individual (Siepsiak et al., 2023; Swedo et al., 2022). Emotional reactions include anger, disgust (Edelstein et al., 2013; Jager et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2017; Schröder et al., 2013), or anxiety and panic (Remmert et al., 2022; Rouw &amp; Erfanian, 2018; Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023). Some studies reported irritation as a primary response (Jager et al., 2020), while others found a negative association between misophonia severity and an irritation response to triggers (Remmert et al., 2022; Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021). Misophonia causes significant impairment in daily social and occupational functioning (Rouw &amp; Erfanian, 2018; Swedo et al., 2022; Williams et al., 2022).

The development of measurement tools for assessing the severity of misophonia symptoms has been of large volume within the literature (Ferrer-Torres &amp; Giménez-Llort, 2022), there remain limitations to such developed tools (Ferrer-Torres &amp; Giménez-Llort, 2022; Potgieter et al., 2019). For instance, scale development has often occurred within non-representative samples and often fails to capture the complexities of misophonia in this advancing field (Potgieter et al., 2019). Researchers in the area recognise the need for both screening and diagnostic tools that are psychometrically validated and adapted to all populations, including scale translation, to allow for cross-cultural understanding and comparisons.

The  Selective  Sound  Sensitivity  Syndrome  Scale  (Vitoratou,  Hayes,  et  al.,  2023;  Vitoratou,  UglikMarucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021) is a 25-item scale for assessing misophonia symptom severity. A five-factor  structure  measures  internalising  appraisals  (perception  of  oneself  as  a  wrong  or  angry person for reacting to sounds), externalising appraisals (propensity to blame others for making the sound),  emotional  threat  (sense  of  being  trapped  or  helpless  if  unable  to  escape  from  sounds), outbursts (fear of or displays of aggressive outburst), and impact (current and future limitations in life from misophonia). The S-Five is supplemented by a trigger checklist (S-Five-T), which measures the nature of the emotional reaction (such as anger or disgust) to trigger sounds and the intensity of those reactions.

The initial  psychometric  evaluation  was  completed  with  a  sample  of  individuals  self-identifying  as having the condition (Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021). The five-factor structure, validity and reliability have since been replicated in a UK general population sample (Vitoratou, Hayes, et  al.,  2023),  and  also  in  samples  using  translated  versions  of  the  S-Five  including  in  mandarin (Vitoratou et al., 2022), and German (Remmert et al., 2022).

To our knowledge, there is minimal data about misophonia in Portugal in the literature, with only case instances  of  misophonia  currently  being  reported.  One  study  in  a  Portuguese  sample  (Cruz  &amp; Assunção, 2019), in which a structured clinical interview was conducted, reported clinically significant misophonia  in  25%  of  participants.  However,  the  study  was  limited  by  a  small  sample  size  of  44 participants,  and  the  clinical  interview  was  based  on  numerous  unvalidated  misophonia  scales. Therefore, to gain an accurate understanding of misophonia in a  Portuguese-speaking population, there is a clear need for a psychometrically valid scale to be translated and evaluated in a large sample.

This study aimed to validate the S-Five in European Portuguese. For this purpose, we assessed the scale's  dimensionality,  reliability  (test-retest  and  internal  consistency),  and  measurement  validity within a Portuguese-speaking sample. In line with previous research, potential bias due to gender and age was also explored, as well as the association between misophonia and symptoms of depression and anxiety.

## Methods

## Recruitment

Participants were sampled through social media groups, mailing lists, adverts 1 (including an article about misophonia in a Portuguese online newspaper called P3 - Público) and contacts, and this type of convenience sampling allowed for sampling to be carried out quickly and at a low cost.

The consent of participants was collected before the completion of survey measures, with the provision of an information sheet (ethics approval reference LRM-22/23-11826). The inclusion criteria set for participation in the study were being at least 18 years old and fluent in Portuguese. The exclusion of those diagnosed with a severe learning or intellectual disability, to the extent that participating in a self-report survey was impossible, was set as a criterion.

## Measures

Demographic information from participants was collected, including age, gender, ethnicity, education level, occupation, country of birth and country of residence. The survey asked respondents to report the  formal  diagnoses  of  mental  health  conditions  (including  disorders  relating  to  mood,  anxiety, trauma, psychosis, personality, eating and substance abuse), audiological conditions (such as tinnitus) and neurodevelopmental conditions, whether they knew the term misophonia and if they identified with misophonia. Several self-report questionnaires were included, as described below.

## Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Scale (S-Five; Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021)

The S-Five  consists  of  two  parts.  The  first  is  the  S-Five  scale,  a  25-item  scale  which  measures  the experience of misophonia (severity scale). The items are each rated on an 11-point interval scale from 0, "not at all true", to 11, "completely true". Previous validations (Remmert et al., 2022; Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou et al., 2022) of the S-Five have identified a five-factor. The five factors capture aspects of externalising appraisals (for example,' people should not make certain sounds, even if they do not know about others' sensitivities'), internalising appraisals (for example, 'the way I react to certain noises makes me feel like I must be an unlikeable person deep down'), threat ('I feel trapped if I cannot get away from certain noises'), outburst ('some sounds are so unbearable that I will shout at people to make them stop') and impact ('my job opportunities are limited because of my reaction to certain sounds') of the disorder. The statements did not appear on the survey in any particular order.

The second part is the S-Five Trigger checklist (S-Five-T) which measures the frequency and intensity of  a  person's  reactions  to  trigger  sounds.  This  study  used  the  37  trigger  sounds  from  the  original research  (Vitoratou,  Uglik-Marucha,  Hayes,  &amp;  Gregory,  2021).  For  each  trigger  sound,  a  person responds to two questions relating to the past two weeks. First, a person selects the most prominent reaction they experience to the trigger, with the options of  no  feeling, irritation,  distress, disgust, anger, panic, other feeling: negative, and other feeling: positive. Second, a person rates the intensity of their reaction from 0: do esn't bother me at all to 10: unbearable/causes suffering.

The triggers checklist can be scored to provide four indices: 1) trigger count (TC), which is the total number of triggers endorsed by a person, 2) reaction count (RC), the total number of times a person selected each of the possible reactions, 3) frequency/intensity of reactions score (FIRS), the sum of intensity scores for endorsed triggers, 4) relative intensity of reactions score (RIRS), an estimation of reaction intensity, relative to the number of endorsed trigger sounds.

## Translation procedure

The S-Five was first translated independently from English to Portuguese by two authors, RA and MC, fluent in Portuguese and English. These two translations were compared to create an agreed-upon translation of the scale. This version was then back-translated to English by JC, fluent in Portuguese and English, and compared to the original S-Five to ensure the items were consistent. The A-MISO-S and MQ were also translated in this way. Please contact the corresponding author for these scales.

The original S-Five in English and the European Portuguese translation of the S-Five are presented in the Appendix (A1).

## Other measures

Several further measures were implemented in the sample to aid in the validation process of the European Portuguese translation of the S-Five.

Two misophonia scales were administered to assess the (concurrent) convergent validity of the S-Five. The  A-MISO-S  (Schröder  et  al.,  2013),  a  6-item  scale  measure  assessing  the  severity  of  one's misophonia  on  a  five-point  ordinal  scale  (0-4),  and  the  MQ  (Wu  et  al.,  2014),  consisting  of  two subscales, rated on a five-point ordinal scale, with 19-items measuring sensitivity to sounds (MSYS) and emotional and behavioural responses to sounds (MEBS), and a single item interval scale, rating from 0 to 15, to assess the severity of misophonia (MSES).

The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke et al., 2001) is a commonly used measure of depression, previously translated and validated in a Portuguese-speaking population (Monteiro et al., 2013). Items are rated on a 4-point ordinal scale with scores ranging from 0 to 27. Higher scores are indicative of greater depression symptoms.  The 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; Spitzer et al., 2006) was used to measure anxiety symptoms. Items are rated on a 4-point ordinal scale with a total score range of 0 -21, with higher scores indicating more anxiety symptoms. The GAD-7 European Portuguese translated version used in this study was previously validated by Sousa et al. (2015). The 18-item Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3; Ganho-Ávila et al., 2019; Taylor et al., 2007) is a shorter version of the original Anxiety Sensitivity Index (Peterson &amp; Reiss, 1992). The scale, rated on a  5-point  ordinal  scale,  measures  fears  about  the  possible  consequences  of  anxiety  sensations, including cognitive, physical, and social concerns.

## Statistical analysis

Confirmatory factor analysis was implemented to assess the accuracy of the previously defined latent structure of the S-Five. The five-factor structure was compared to a unidimensional model. Due to the skewness  of  the  data  and  the  interval  response  options,  factor  analysis  for  continuous  data  was implemented using the maximum likelihood with robust standard errors estimator (MLR; Muthen &amp; Muthén, 1998-2017).

In factor analysis, a number of goodness of fit indices were considered in identifying the best fitting latent variables model for the data. The guidelines set out by the ConPsy checklist (Vitoratou, UglikMarucha, et al., 2023) for adequate and close fit were followed.  These indices and their criteria for close fit were the relative chi-square ( 𝜒 2 ) with values less than 3 (Hoelter, 1983), the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) with values &lt;0.05 (Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999), Standardised Root Mean Residual (SRMR) with values &lt;0.05 (Hooper et al., 2008) and values &gt;0.95 for both the Tucker-Lewis Index  (TLI; Bentler &amp; Bonett, 1980) and the Comparative Fit Index (CFI;  Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999). For adequate fit to be concluded, we required a relative 𝜒 2 of less than five (Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999), an RMSEA

&lt;0.10 (Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1992), an SRMR &lt;0.08 (Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999; Kline, 2016) and values of CFI and TLI &gt;0.90 (Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999).

The  values  of  two  model  selection  indices,  Akaike's  Information  Criteria  (AIC;  Akaike,  1974)  and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC; Schwarz, 1978), were reported for which lower values suggested a better model.

Measurement invariance in the items of the S-Five, due to age and gender, was evaluated using the multiple indicator multiple causes model (MIMIC; Joreskog &amp; Goldberger, 1975; Muthén, 1979).

The internal consistency of the S-Five was assessed using Cronbach (1951) alpha (α) and McDonald (1999) omega ( ω), for which values &gt;0.7 are suggestive of satisfactory internal consistency, the alpha if item deleted and the item-total correlations (ITC: values between 0.3 and 0.8 required; Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994).

To establish the convergent, concurrent validity of the S-Five, the factor scales were correlated with A-MISO-S and the MQ subscales. A relationship between the S-Five and age, as well as differences in scores due to gender, were evaluated with parametric testing (Spearman's rho and Mann-Whitney U tests).

The software Stata 17 (StataCorp., 2021) and Mplus 8 (Muthen &amp; Muthén, 1998-2017) were used for the analyses.

## Results

## Sample characteristics

In total 492 participants agreed to take part, of which one person was removed using listwise deletion due to missing items in the S-Five. Of the sample, N = 491, the mean age was 35 years old (mean = 34.6, SD = 11.0), ranging from 18 to 69 years old and the majority of the sample identified as female (N = 394, 80%).  From the final sample, 47% reported having misophonia, 23% did not identify as having misophonia, and 30% were unsure if they had misophonia.

Of 462 participants who responded to demographic and diagnostic questions, 93% were white or Caucasian (N = 429), 79% were born in Portugal (N = 367) and concerning education, 44% (N = 205) held undergraduate degrees and 40% (N = 183) held postgraduate degrees.

The  most  self-reported  diagnoses  were  anxiety  disorders,  followed  by  mood  disorders,  with  a reporting  of  24%  and  19%,  respectively,  of  which  the  most  frequently  reported  diagnoses  were generalised anxiety disorder and depression. Other self-reported psychiatric diagnoses, grouped into general categories, were reported at a rate of between 6% and 3%, in the order of eating disorders, trauma-related disorders, personality disorders and psychotic disorders. Audiological conditions were reported  to  affect  8%  of  the  sample,  and  neurodevelopmental  disorders  were  present  for  6%  of respondents.

## S-Five statements

## Statement responses

For the majority of the S-Five statements, 19 of 25, "not at all true" was the most frequently selected response (endorsed by 21-56% of the sample). For the remaining six items, "completely true" was the most commonly selected response (with 17-33% of the sample endorsing the items). Four of these items are related to other people and sounds they may make, I06 "Others avoid making noises", I13 "Others should not make sounds", I21 "Others bad manners", and I25 "Others disrespectful", and two items related to feelings experienced when unable to avoid certain sounds, I07 "Feel anxious" and I10 "Experience distress".

## Dimensionality and measurement invariance

The unidimensional model did not have an adequate fit to the data according to the goodness of fit indices (Rel 𝜒 2 = 7.9; RMSEA = 0.119 with a 90% CI (0.114, 0.123); CFI = 0.75; TLI = 0.73; SRMR = 0.078) and the factor loadings ranged from 0.46 to 0.87. The five-factor model had an improved fit over the one-factor model with an adequate fit in relation to the goodness of fit criteria (Rel 𝜒 2 = 3.2; RMSEA = 0.067 with a 90% CI (0.062, 0.072); CFI = 0.92; TLI = 0.91; SRMR = 0.05) and lower values for the model selection criteria. The loadings of the items to the factors were  at least 0.67, indicating a suitable model fit (Table 1).

Note. ITC: item-total correlation; AIC: alpha if item deleted

The  multiple  indicator  multiple  causes  model  was  fitted  to  the  data  to  explore  the  potential measurement bias of the S-Five. Five items  (I14  "Avoid places",  I03  "Feel  helpless",  I04  "Verbally aggressive",  I19  "Dislike  self",  and  I18  "Bad  person  inside")  were  found  to  be  measurement  non- invariant with respect to age, adjusted for gender. However, for each of these items, the magnitude of the direct effect was very small, ranging from -0.03 to 0.03, interpretable as a change of 0.03 or smaller on the 0-10 scale of these items for a one-year increase in age.

Significant direct effects due to gender, adjusted for age, were found for four items of the S-Five. At the same levels of sound sensitivity,  females scored higher on the following items by the relative effect: I23 "Shout at people" by 0.89 units, I07 "Feel anxious" by 0.51 units, I02 "Panic or explode" by 0.47 units and I08 "Unlikeable person" by 0.43 units. However, the magnitude of less than 0.9 on an 11-point rating scale can be considered small (with medium to small effects). The remaining 21 items of the S-Five were measurement invariant with respect to gender. Thus, the S-Five can allow for the comparison of scores between different gender.

## Scores, reliability, and validity

The S-Five subscales and total scores were not significantly correlated with age (Table 2; p&lt;0.05). The threat score significantly differed between males and females, with females scoring, on average, 11 points higher (Table 2). The internal consistency was satisfactory for all S-Five factors (0.88 or higher; Table  2),  with  omega  coefficients  equal  to  that  of  Cronbach's  alpha.  No  items  were  identified  as potentially problematic, with the item-total correlations ranging from 0.64 to 0.88 and a lower alpha if item deleted than the scale alpha for all items (Table 1).

The  intercorrelations  of  the  S-Five  factors  were  moderate  to  strong  (0.59-0.81;  Table  3),  and  no significant correlations were found with age (Table 2). Evidence of concurrent, convergent validity was found by correlating the S-Five with the subscales and total score of the MQ and the A-MISO-S total, for which moderate to high correlations emerged (0.46-0.86; Table 3). Moderate correlations were identified between all  S-Five factors and the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 (rho ≤ 0.5; Table 3). Similarly, low correlations between the ASI-3 factors and total score and the S-Five were revealed (Table 3).

## S-Five trigger checklist

## Reaction counts

The descriptive statistics for the calculated reaction counts are shown in Table 4, which shows that no feeling had the highest average score, followed by irritation , then disgust .

Considering each of the 37 trigger sounds, no reaction or irritation were the most frequently selected reactions for 36 sounds. For "loud chewing", the most common reaction was disgust (31%), followed by irritation (26%) and anger (25%). For 20 of 37 sounds, the lowest reaction responses of no reaction and irritation captured 80% of the sample (Figure 1).

## Intensity

Considering the intensity of the reactions reported, loud chewing, chewing gum, slurping and crunchy eating sounds were scored the highest (Figure 2). Certain letter sounds and words, rustling plastic or paper and sneezing were the sounds that were reported with the lowest intensity of responses.

Table 5 shows the intercorrelations of the S-Five-T and the correlations of the S-Five-T with all the other measures. Low to moderate correlations were found between the S-Five-T scores and PHQ-9, GAD-7 and ASI-3.  The reaction count for no feeling was negatively correlated with all other measures (p&lt;0.05) and had the strongest correlation with the trigger count, FIRS and the MSYS of the MQ. The reaction count for anger had moderate to strong correlations with all of the misophonia scales used in  the  study (p≤0.01) ,  with  the  highest correlations seen between RC: Anger and FIRS, S-Five total score, the MQ total score and the MEBS of the MQ (rho&gt;0.6). The S-Five-T trigger count score and FIRS were found to have strong correlations with the MSYS of the MQ and the total MQ score.

## Discussion

This study aimed to validate the existing 25-item S-five scale in the Portuguese-speaking population, showing  that  the  S-Five,  supported  by  its  psychometric  properties,  is  a  reliable  and  useful measurement tool for misophonia. In collaboration with a Portuguese team experienced in the field of misophonia, the 25-item S-Five was accurately translated into European Portuguese whilst ensuring the psychometric integrity was maintained before distributing the survey to the Portuguese-speaking population.  Factor  analysis  of  the  scale  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  five-factor  model,  and  the psychometrics properties were evaluated. This study produced novel findings that the S-Five scale is valid for measuring misophonia within the Portuguese-speaking population.

The five-factor solution of the S-Five scale, as shown in the original study (Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021) as well as in translation studies (Remmert et al., 2022; Vitoratou et al., 2022), was replicated in the Portuguese sample. The factors measure internalising appraisals, externalising appraisals, perceived threats, outbursts and  impacts on daily functioning. The S-Five was developed to measure these aspects of misophonia cross-culturally, and the present study has shown that the S-Five is reliable within a Portuguese-speaking sample, evidence that the scale can be used to assess the severity of misophonia within this population. This allows for the direct comparison of scores across the different cultures of which the S-Five has been evaluated (Remmert et al., 2022; Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021; Vitoratou et al., 2022). In previous validations of the S-Five, the scale has been determined to be measurement invariant with regard to age and gender. While some items are non-invariant for gender, these effects have been of a small magnitude and, as such, considered negligible. Within the Portuguese-speaking sample, only one item from the outburst factor (I23 'Shout at people') had a medium non-invariant effect, all other items had small negligible effects. This was further evidence that the S-Five is measurement invariant, allowing for scores to be compared across ages and genders.

The externalising factor had the highest average score of the five factors, and the impact factor had the lowest average score. This pattern was also seen in other cross-cultural studies which have used the S-Five to evaluate misophonia (Remmert et al., 2022; Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021; Vitoratou et al., 2022). However, average threat scores were arguably higher within the Portuguese-speaking sample when compared to the UK general population (Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023) and the translation studies of the S-Five scale (Vitoratou et al., 2022). The UK misophonia population (Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021) was also found to have the highest average scores in the threat factor and the presence of a significant gender difference in threat scores. This could be explained by the higher percentage of participants self-identifying as having misophonia in this sample when compared to the previous validations of the S-Five (Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou et al., 2022), highlighting that those taking part in this study may not be representative of the general Portuguese-speaking population.

The S-Five factors had strong positive correlations with the MQ and A-MISO-S, in agreement with previous findings (Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023; Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021; Vitoratou et al., 2022). This further establishes that the S-Five has concurrent, convergent validity in assessing misophonia severity within the Portuguese-speaking sample. Similarly, as found previously, moderate  correlations  between  the  S-Five  and  the  PHQ-9  and  GAD-7  emerged.  However,  these correlations are likely due to the multidimensional nature of the S-Five, in comparison to alternative misophonia scales, as described in the literature (Potgieter et al., 2019; Vitoratou, Hayes, et al., 2023) and the findings of an association between the symptoms of the three disorders (Erfanian et al., 2019; Norris et al., 2022; Quek et al., 2018; Siepsiak et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2017). While misophonia severity was  moderately  associated  with  anxiety  symptoms,  it  was  only  weakly  associated  with  anxiety sensitivity.  Some  studies  have  reported  on  the  potential  role  of  anxiety  sensitivity  in  misophonia (Cusack et al., 2018; Dixon et al., 2023). However, Wang et al. (2022) proposed that this relationship could be explained by a shared overlap in anxiety symptoms rather than a unique contribution of anxiety sensitivity. More research is needed to investigate further the role of anxiety symptoms and sensitivity in misophonia.

This validation of the S-Five within the Portuguese-speaking population allows further investigations into misophonia, such as its prevalence, severity and symptomology. The tool is also vital for both clinical and research utility, as the scale will allow for changes in misophonia to be reliably measured in response to treatments and interventions as these are developed and evaluated. The multidimensional  structure  and  the  flexible  trigger  checklist  will  allow  for  a  more in-depth understanding of misophonia and the correlates of misophonia with other disorders and symptoms within this population.

There are several limitations of the present study that should not be overlooked. The main limitation is the exploratory nature of this study, which has used a mixed convenience sample that limits the ability  of  generalisation  to  the  target  population.  This  restricts  the  application  of  the  findings  in establishing a cut-off score for clinically significant misophonia and cultural norms of misophonia. Unlike previous studies, the current study does not  specify the longevity of the S-Five in assessing misophonia severity. Thus test-retest analysis would strengthen the scale's reliability. Further, as the previous literature highlights, developing and implementing a structured clinical interview alongside the S-Five and other self-report measures would allow for discriminative validity of the S-Five to be established,  this  would  ensure  the  measurement  of  misophonia  in  isolation  from  co-morbid conditions.

In  conclusion,  this  study  found  that  the  five-factor  structure  of  the  S-Five  was  replicated  in  a Portuguese-speaking population, with proportionate evidence of reliability and validity. These findings highlight  the  robust  nature  of  the  existing  S-five  scale as  a  tool  for  measuring  misophonia.  While further  evidence  is  needed  to  demonstrate  the  generalisability  of  the  results  to  the  general Portuguese population, this study provides preliminary findings that the S-Five can be administered in such a population for future research.

| Eu reajo fortemente a certos sons porque não consigo aceitar como as pessoas possem ser tão egoístas, descuidadas ou mal educadas                                                                                              |
| Certos sons são apenas falta de educação, e não é estranho sentir uma raiva intense em relação a isso.                                                                                                                         |

| Eu não me encontro con amigos tão frequentemente como gostaria devido aos ruidos que eles fazem                                                                                                                                |

## Pontuação:

- · Emotional Reaction scores (ERS) para cada emoção: contar em todos os gatilhos as vezes que cada emoção foi selecionada no(s) item(ns) para criar um índice para cada emoção (por exemplo, ERS-Anger, assumindo valores entre 0 e 37). O índice fornece informações sobre reações emocionais específicas entre os participantes.
- · Frequency/Intensity of Reactions Score (FIRS index) : Adicione as respostas aos pontos (ii) em todos os gatilhos (intervalo  de  0  a  370).  O  índice  fornece  informações  combinadas  sobre  o  número  de  sons  de  disparo  e  sua intensidade.
- · Trigger Count (TC): Por favor, conte o número de respostas diferentes de zero para (ii). O índice assume valores entre 0 e 37 e fornece informações sobre o número de sons de disparo relatados por pessoa.
- · Trigger Relative Intensity (TRE): Por favor, divida FIRS por TC para obter uma estimativa da intensidade das respostas de gatilho, em relação ao número de gatilhos relatados. O índice fornece informações sobre a intensidade da resposta aos gatilhos, independentemente de seu número.
