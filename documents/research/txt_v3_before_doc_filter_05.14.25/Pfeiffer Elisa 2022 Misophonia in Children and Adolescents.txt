Summary: Misophonia   describes   a   phenomenon   in   which   affected   children   and   adolescents   show   a   strong   negative   physiological   and   emotional reaction   when   confronted   with   specific   auditory   (misophonic)   stimuli   (most   commonly   eating   or   breathing   noises).   Individual   studies   with   adults already   provide   prevalences   between   6   and   20%   in   various   (clinical)   samples,   whereby   the   representativeness   of   the   samples   in   most   studies   was only   given   to   a   very   limited   extent.   However,   the   first   manifestation   of   the   symptoms   is   in   more   than   80%   of   cases   in   childhood   and   adolescence, which   is   why   this   age   group   should   be   given   special   attention.   With   regard   to   comorbid   disorders,   there   is   also   great   heterogeneity   with   estimates   of between   28%   and   76%   for   comorbid   mental   disorders   and   around   25%   for   comorbid   physical   illnesses.   The   exact   etiology   has   not   yet   been sufficiently   investigated.   First   neurophysiological   explanations   and   imaging   studies   point   to   a   specific   physiological   reaction   in   misophonia   patients. Although   there   are   now   a   large   number   of   case   reports,   diagnostic   criteria   and   measuring   instruments   have   been   developed   and   the   first   cognitivebehavioral   treatment   approaches   have   been   evaluated,   misophonia   still   does   not   represent   an   independent   neurological,   audiological   or   psychiatric disorder   in   the   DSM-5   or   the   ICD-11.

## Misophonia   in   Childhood   and   Adolescence:   A   Narrative   Review

More   than   80%   of   the   first   manifestation   of   symptoms   occurs   during   childhood   and   adolescence.   Regarding   comorbid   disorders,   studies   show   great heterogeneity,   with   estimates   ranging   from   28-76%   of   comorbid   mental   disorders   and   approximately   25%   with   comorbid   physical   disor   ders.   The exact   etiology   is   currently   not   well   studied.   Initial   neurophysiological   explanations   and   imaging   studies   point   to   a   specific   physiologi   cal   response   in misophonia   patients.   Although   many   case   reports   are   now   available,   and   diagnostic   criteria   and   measurement   tools   have   been   developed, misophonia   currently   does   not   represent   a   distinct   neurological,   audiological,   or   psychiatric   disorder   in   the   DSM-5   or   ICD-11. Abstract: Misophonia   describes   a   phenomenon   in   which   the   affected   children   and   adolescents   show   a   strong   negative   physiological   and   emo tional   reaction   when   confronted   with   specific   (misophonic)   auditory   stimuli   (most   commonly   eating   or   breathing   sounds).   Several   studies   with   adults yielded   prevalence   rates   between   6%   and   20%   in   various   (clinical)   samples,   but   the   representativeness   of   samples   was   largely   limited.

## background

The   term   "misophonia" (Greek misos =   hate, phone =   noise),   literally   "hatred   of   sounds",   describes   a phenomenon   in   which   those   affected   show   a   negative physiological   and   emotional   reaction   when   confronted with   specific   auditory   stimuli   (Brout   et   al.,   2018;   Jager, de   Koning,   Bost,   Denys   &amp;   Vulink,   2020).   Although initial   studies   indicate   that   the   phenomenon   of misophonia   is   quite   widespread   in   the   general population,   is   associated   with   considerable   physical and   emotional   stress   and   occurs   for   most   of   those found   in   the   diagnosis   and   care   of   mentally   ill   children and   adolescents   (Claiborn,   Dozier,   Hart   &amp;   Lee,   2020). The   aim   of   this   review   article   is   therefore   to   create   an overview   of   the   symptoms,   course   and   treatment options   on   the   basis   of   a   selective   literature   search   in order   to   sensitize   specialists   to   the   disorder.   In addition   to   the   psychiatric   perspective,   misophonia has   received   attention   in   a   large   number   of   related interdisciplinary   research   areas,   which   has   led   to   an interdisciplinary   conceptualization   of   the   disorder   in the   literature.   However,   this   article   focuses   on   the psychological   and   psychiatric   facets   of   the   disorder.

## Method

The studies for this review were identified through a systematic literature search in the online database PubMed using the search termslkeywords "misophonia or "misophonia" (title and abstract) . The Su. last repeated on October Ist, 2021 che yielded a hundred relevant studies. The selection of the articles included in this review selection of the articles considered was subjective and unsystematic.

## Description of the_disorder

The   syndrome   misophonia   was   first   conceptualized   in the   scientific   literature   (Jastreboff   &amp;   Jastreboff,   2001)   by the   Americans   Margaret   and   Pawel   Jastreboff,   who   are known   for   their   research   in   the   field   of   tinnitus   (Jastreboff, 1990).   The   authors   describe   neurological   similarities   to the   disorders   hyperacusis   (extreme   sensitivity   to   loud noises,   occurs   e.g.   in   small   children)   and   phonophobia (phobic   fear   of   noises).

The   authors   noticed   that   individual   hyperacusis   patients reacted   sensitively   to   a   certain   group   of   sounds, regardless   of   the   loudness   or   other   physical   characteristics of   the   sounds.   In   contrast   to   hyperacusis,   the   triggering sounds   were   variable   in   this   subgroup   of   patients.

The   stimuli   perceived   as   aversive,   which   are   also called   'triggers'   or   'misophonia   sounds',   include   eating sounds   (e.g.   swallowing,   chewing,   biting   into   an   apple), nasal/breathing   sounds,   mouth   and   throat   sounds, knocking   sounds,   rustling ,   room   noises   (e.g.   telephone ringing)   or   repetitive   movements   (e.g.   scratching; overview:   Jager   et   al.,   2020;   Siepsiak   &amp;   Dragan,   2019). The   ensuing   automatic   emotional   response   (also   called the   'misophonia   response'   or   'misophonic   response') can   manifest   itself   in   a   variety   of   feelings,   such   as   anger, rage,   fear,   and   disgust,   or   at   the   behavioral   level,   in   the form   of   avoidance   and   a   desire   to   to   escape   the   situation (fight-flight   response; Brout   et   al.,   2018;   Wu,   Lewin, Murphy   &amp;   Storch,   2014).   In   a   current   Dutch   study   with N =   575   misophonia   patients   (mixed   children,   adolescents and   adults),   the   authors   were   able   to   show   that   93.8% irritability,   89.5%   anger,   64%   disgust   and   13.6%   other emotional   reactions   (e.g.   sadness   or   loss   of   control ) experience   (Jager   et   al.,   2020).   About

In   a   survey   in   the   USA,   97.1%   also   reported   physiological reactions   in   the   body   and   face   (e.g.

muscle   tension)   associated   with   anger   and   anxiety   (86%)

and   manifested   by   muscular   tension   (82.8%)   or   teeth grinding/clenching   (63.9%)   (Claiborn   et   al.,   2020).   The sound   pattern   and   the   triggering   reaction   are   very unpleasant   for   those   affected different.   Initial   studies   have   shown   that   the   context   of the   sound   plays   an   important   role   in   how   aversive   that sound   is   perceived.   For   example,   noises   from   close people   are   considered

perceived   as   more   aversive.   On   the   contrary,   sounds are   perceived   as   less   aversive   by   young   children,   adults with   intellectual   disabilities   and   elderly   people   with dementia   (Dozier,   2015a).   For   individuals   affected, misophonia   can   be   associated   with   significant psychoemotional   and   social   stress,   a   reduction   in functional   level   and   quality   of   life.

Although   initial   studies   have   already   attempted   to characterize   the   clinical   picture   of   the   disorder   in   terms of   diagnostic   criteria   and   the   level   of   suffering   of   those   affected

It   hould   be   noted   that   misophonia   has   not   been s recognized   as   a   neurological,   audiological,   or   psychiatric disorder   to   date.   In   addition,   the   disorder   cannot   be classified   and   diagnosed   as   an   independent   disorder using   the   current   classification   systems.   A   detailed overview   of   the   differentiation   of   psychiatric   disorders   can be   found   in   Schröder,   Vulink   and   Denys   (2013).   A   working group   led   by   Arjan   Schröder   published   a   first   proposal   for possible   diagnostic   criteria   in   2013   (Schröder   et   al., 2013),   followed   by   those   of   Thomas   Doziers'   working group   in   2017   (Dozier   &amp;   Morrison,   2017;   German   overview in   Spitczok,   by   Brinsinski,   Semmler,   Schüller   &amp;   Heiden rich,   2019).   The   criteria   according   to   Schröder   were revised   by   the   Jager   working   group   in   2020   on   the   basis of   new   findings   and   are   therefore   the   most   up-to-date criteria   (see   presentation   of   the   criteria   in   Table   1).   All conceptualisations   of   the   diagnostic   criteria   are   largely based   on   studies   with   young   adults.

With   regard   to   stimuli   typical   of   misophonia,   the authors   were   able   to   show   in   a   current   study   that   almost all   misophonia   patients   reported   eating   sounds   (96%) and   nasal   or   breathing   sounds   (85%)   as   misophonic stimuli,   which   is   why   these   special   sounds   were   included in   the   criteria.   In   their   sample,   78%   of   patients   also reported   nonauditory   stimuli   as   misophonic   triggers,   but auditory   stimuli   are   categorized   as   primary   triggers.

Early   studies   of   the   phenomenology   of   the   disorder included   only   case   studies   or   case   series   from   Awake Those   who   reported   sensitivity   to   a   variety   of   sounds (made   by   people   or   objects)   (e.g.,

Studies   that   differentiated   the   symptoms   from   other disorders,   such   as   eating   disorders   (Kluckow   et   al.,   2014), autism   (Williams,   He,   Cascio   &amp;   Woynaroski,   2021)   or   tic disorders   ( Cavanna   &amp;   Seri,   2015).   In   children   and adolescents   there   are   already   individual   (therapeutic) case   reports   on   patients   with   misophonic   symptoms (Kamody   &amp;   Del   Conte,   2017;   McGuire,   Wu   &amp;   Storch, 2015;   Sarigedik   &amp;   Yurteri,   2021;   Spitczok   von   Brisinski   et al.,   2019).   In   his   guide,   Thomas   Dozier   (2016)   describes two   types   of   children   with   misophonia   based   on   surveys in   social   media   and   personal   experiences   with   those affected:   Type   1   are   sensitive   and   empathetic   children, Type   2   are   headstrong   and   impulsive   children.   In   his experience,   type   1   and   type   2   children   develop   initial symptoms   as   a   result   of   a   conditioned   response   to stressful   social   situations.   He Johnson   et   al.,   2013;   Kluckow,   Telfer   &amp;   Abraham,   2014).

emphasizes   the   exclusion   from   the   peer   group   through tantrums   in   misophonia   triggers   and   increased   conflicts within   the   family   due   to   misophonic   reactions   as   the psychosocial   consequences   of   misophonia.

## comorbidity

The   study   situation   on   mental   and   physical   comorbid disorders   is   very   heterogeneous   (Siepsiak   &amp;   Dragan, 2019)   and   is   briefly   presented   below.   In   a   first   study on   the   differential   diagnosis   of   misophonic   symptoms, a   Dutch   working   group

PE   show   that   in   a   sample   of   42   adults   who   reported misophonic   symptoms,   52.4%   met   criteria   for anankastic   personality   disorder,   7.1%   mood   disorder, 4.8%   (attention-deficit/hyperactivity   disorder   (ADHD), 2.4%   panic   disorder   and   2.4%   had   OCD   (Schröder   et al.,   2013)   Other   common   comorbid   diagnoses   include post-traumatic   stress   disorder   (PTSD;   15.4%)   and autism   and   anorexia   nervosa   (9.61%;   Erfanian, Kartsonaki   &amp;   Keshavarz,   2019;   Green   &amp;   Ben-Sasson, 2010;   Rouw   &amp;   Erfanian,   2018)   In   a   study   of N =   1061 people   who   completed   an   online   social   media   survey and   self-attributed   misophonia   to   themselves,   76.2% of   study   participants   reported   at   least   one   other psychiatric   condition   diagnosis   (diagnosed   disorder or   own   assessment;   Claiborn   et   al.,   2020).

The   most   common   comorbid   disorders   were   mood disorders   (48.4%),   anxiety   disorders   (43.6%)   and obsessive-compulsive   disorders   (20.8%).   A   total   of 18.5%   stated   that   they   suffered   from   tinnitus.   On   the contrary,   72%   of   the   patients   in   the   utilization population   reported   by   the   Dutch   working   group   led by   Jager   et   al.   were   examined,   apart   from   the misophonia   diagnosis,   no   other   axis   I   disorder according   to   DSM-IV   criteria   (Diagnostic   and   Statistical Manual   of   Mental   Disorders;   American   Psychiatric Association,   1994;   Jager   et   al.,   2020).   Only   about 28%   met   the   criteria   of   a   comorbid   psychiatric diagnosis,   of   which   the   most   common   diagnoses   were in   the   area   of   mood   disorders   (10.1%),   anxiety disorders   (9%)   and   ADHD   (5.4%).   However,   a   total   of 27.1%   of   the   patients   were   conspicuous   in   the   area   of   personality

Table   1. Proposed   diagnostic   criteria   for   misophonia   according   to   Jager   et   al.,   2020   (translated   and   slightly   modified   from   English   to   German)

Revised   criteria   for   misophonia   (Amsterdam   UMC   2020)

AR.   Preoccupation   with   a   specific   auditory,   visual,   or   sensory   stimulus   that   is   predominantly   performed   by   another   person.   Requires   oral   or   nasal sounds   to   be   a   trigger.

BR.   The   stimuli   evoke   intense   feelings   of   irritation,   anger,   and/or   disgust   that   the   person   recognizes   as   excessive,   inappropriate,   or   disproportionate to   the   circumstances.

CR.   As   emotions   trigger   an   impulsive,   aversive   physical   response,   the   person   experiences   a   deep   sense   of   loss   of   self-control   with   infrequent but   potentially   aggressive   outbursts.

DR.   The   person   actively   avoids   situations   in   which   triggers   occur,   or   endures   triggers   with   intense   discomfort,   irritation,   anger,   or   revulsion.

HE.   The   irritation,   anger,   disgust,   or   avoidance   causes   significant   distress   and/or   disruption   to   the   person's   daily   life.   For   example,   it   is   impossible to   eat   together,   to   work   in   an   open-plan   office,   or   to   live   together.

FR.   The   irritation,   anger,   disgust,   and   avoidance   are   not   better   accounted   for   by   another   disorder,   such   as   an   autism   spectrum   disorder   (e.g., general   hypersensitivity   or   over-excitement   to   all   sensory   stimuli)   or   an   attention-deficit/hyperactivity   disorder   (e.g.,   attention   problems   with   high distractibility   in   general).

a   Hogrefe   OpenMind   article   under   the

realm   of   the   compulsive   personality.   A   total   of   24%   of the   patients   reported   a   physical   illness   (20%   a disorder).   The   most   common   physical   diagnoses were   migraines,   irritable   bowel   syndrome,   asthma and   back   pain.   In   the   field   of   audiological   disorders, four   patients   had   a   diagnosis   of   hyperacusis,   ten patients   had   tinnitus,   one   patient   had   both   clinical pictures   and   21   patients   reported   hearing   loss   or other   hearing   problems.

Another   study   from   the   USA   with   adults   examined the   connection   between   misophonia,   psychopathology and   personality   disorders   using   semi-structured clinical   interviews   (Cassiello-Robbins   et   al.,   2021).

They   were   able   to   show   that   misophonia   symptoms were   only   associated   with   an   increase   in   personality disorders   and   not   with   psychopathology   in   general. This   association   was   also   partially   mediated   by anxiety   symptoms.

A   study   with   students   in   the   USA   was   able   to

Positive   correlations   of   misophonia   symptoms   with   anxiety, depression   and   obsessive-compulsive   symptoms   also   show that   the   symptoms   are   associated   with   a   reduction   in   the   level of   functioning   in   everyday   life   and   increased   sensory defensiveness   (Wu   et   al.,   2014).   In   a   large   online   survey   with N =   628   participants (n =   121   with   misophonia   symptoms),   the authors   were   able   to inside   show   that   there   was   a   large   heterogeneity   of   comorbid symptoms   and   that   no   typical   pattern   of   psychological abnormalities   was   found   in   people   with   misophonia.   A   large number   of   studies   have   come   to   the   conclusion   that   misophonia is   not   associated   with   a   specific   mental   disorder   per   se,   but   in principle   with   increased   psychological   abnormalities,   a restricted   level   of   functioning   (Brout   et   al.,   2018;   McKay,   Kim, Mancusi,   Storch   &amp;   Spankovich,   2018)   and   reduced   quality   of life   (Jager   et   al.,   2020).   Although   a   large   number   of   the   studies described   above   Kin

and   adolescents   and   pointed   out   that   this   population   is particularly   affected,   no   study   has   so   far   examined   comorbidity exclusively   in   children   and   adolescents.   However,   since   many mental   disorders   in   childhood   and   adolescence   occur   more frequently   (e.g.   ADHD)   and   sometimes   less   frequently   (e.g.

schizophrenia)   than   in   adulthood,   the   comorbidity   of misophonia   in   this   particularly   vulnerable   population   must   be examined   more   closely   in   the   future.   In   addition   to   recording the   comorbid   psychiatric   diagnoses   per   se,   the   question arises,   particularly   with   regard   to   the   treatment   of   children   and adolescents   with   misophonia,   as   to   whether   the   comorbid disorders   in   the   context   of   a   disorder   development   and maintenance   model   also   determine   the   misophonic   symptoms and   possibly   even   cause   them   for   misophonia   (e.g.   trau noises   associated   with   it   that   can   trigger   PTSD   symptoms)   or are   also   a   consequence   of   misophonia   (e.g.   depressive   mood due   to   withdrawal   and   rejection   by   others).   A   case   study   with tic   patients   in   childhood   and   adolescence   who   describe symptoms   of   misophonia (N =   12)   already   provides   the   first indications   that   the   disorders   may   be   closely   linked   (both   as   a trigger   and   as   a   reaction;   Robinson,   Hedderly ,   Conte,   Malik &amp;   Cardona,   2018).   There   are   similar   findings   in   children   and adolescents   in   the   area   of   obsessive-compulsive   disorders (Webber,   Johnson   &amp;   Storc,   2014),   whereby   the   patient described   in   this   publication   had   a   tic   disorder   in   addition   to an   obsessive-compulsive   disorder,   which   is   why   no   concrete statements   on   the   connection   have   yet   been   made   for   children OCD   and   misophonia   symptoms   can   be   affected   independently of   other   disorders.

## Epidemiology   and   course

The   onset   of   the   disease   is   usually   in   childhood   and adolescence   (Claiborn   et   al.,   2020;   Dozier,   2015a; Gemstone,   Brang,   Rouw   &amp;   Ramachandran,   2013; Jager   et   al.,   2020;   Schröder,   Vulink,   van   Loon   &amp; Denys,   2017) .   A   recent   study   of   people   who   selfreported   having   the   disease   misophonia   reported   a mean   age   of   onset   of   12.61   years (SD =   7.46,   range 0-15;   Claiborn   et   al.,   2020);   About   80%   of   the   study participants   stated   that   symptoms   started   before   the age   of   15.   Age   and   gender   of   the   patients   had   no influence   on   the   age   of   onset   (Claiborn   et   al.,   2020; Jager   et   al.,   2020),   but   earlier   onset   of   symptoms was   permanently   associated   with   stronger   symptoms (Claiborn   et   al.,   2020).   A   recent   study   (Jager   et   al., 2020)   on   a   clinical   utilization   population   who   presented with   their   misophonia   symptoms   (n=575   of   the   N=779 patients   met   the   authors'   misophonia   criteria,   69% female, Mage =13.17   years),   was   able   to   show   that most   patients   reported   a   gradual   onset   of   symptoms and   a   chronic   course.   However,   there   are   still   no concrete   studies   on   long-term   courses   (e.g.

increase   or   decrease   in   misophonic   response). However,   Thomas   Dozier   describes   in   his   publication that   the   symptoms   often   become   more   severe   during puberty   (Do   zier,   2016).   So   far,   there   are   no indications   of   gender   differences   in   the   symptoms   described.

There   are   currently   only   a   few   representative   studies   on   the Prevalence   of   misophonia   in   the   general   population   or specifically   in   children   and   adolescents   (Siepsiak   &amp;   Dra-

gan,   2019).   Previous   studies,   most   of   which   were   carried out   with   university   students   or   tinnitus   patients,   report very   different   prevalence   rates   and   only   allow   a   few conclusions   to   be   drawn   about   the   general   population. For   example,   a   study   with N =   438   students   (16%   male) in   the   USA   reported   clinically   significant   symptoms   of misophonia   in   20%   of   the   study   participants   (Wu   et   al., 2014).   Another   study   with   students   in   Great   Britain   found a   significantly   higher   prevalence:   A   total   of   49.1% reported   misophonic   symptoms   (37%   mild   symptoms, 12%   moderate   symptoms,   0.3%   severe   symptoms; N = 336   participants;   Naylor,   Caimino,   Scutt,   Hoare   &amp; Baguley,   2021).   In   a   study   of   students   in   China   using the   same   instrument   as   the   US   study,   6%   were   clinically abnormal (N =415).

Of   particular   note   is   a   representative   study   on   a household   sample   in   Turkey,   in   which N =   541   people older   than   15   years   were   interviewed   about   misophonia symptoms   (Kiliç,   Öz,  Avanoÿlu   &amp;   Aksoy,   2021).   A   total of n =   69   (12.8%)   met   the   diagnostic   criteria   used   by the   authors   and n =   427   (78.9%)   reported   that   at   least one   of   the   listed   tones   was   associated   with   stress   for them. There   are   studies   among   patients   with   tinnitus   that assume   a   prevalence   of   misophonia   of   10   to   60% (Hadjipavlou,   Baer,   Lau   &amp;   Howard,   2008;   Sztuka,   Pospi ech,   Gawron   &amp;   Dudek,   2010).   Both   the   Wu   et   al.   (2014) and   the   study   by   Zhou,   Wu,   &amp;   Storch   (2017)   showed that   anxiety   symptoms   mediated   the   relationship between   misophonia   and   outbursts   of   anger.

## pathomechanism/etiology

associations of this stimulus with the stimulus-response in the sense of a generalization.

Individual   studies   indicate   a   familial   accumulation   of misophonia.   Two   studies,   one   from   the   Netherlands   (33%; Jager   et   al.,   2020)   and   one   from   the   USA   (55%;   Rouw   &amp; Erfanian,   2018),   report   a   family   history   of   misophonia   in   at least   one   in   three   sufferers.   A   possible   genetic   component   or intra-familial   model   learning   as   a   cause   of misophonia   should   be   examined   more   closely   in   the   future   in order   to   better   understand   the   overall   etiology   of   the   disorder to   understand.

## Neurophysiological   explanations

So   far,   there   are   only   a   few   studies   that   have   dealt   with possible   neurophysiological   correlates   and   causes   of misophonia   (Brout   et   al.,   2018).

The   studies   available   to   date   must   also   be   interpreted with   caution,   since   in   some   cases   different   diagnostic criteria   for   misophonia   were   used,   e.g.   In   some   cases, the   study   populations   were   very   different   and   only   very small   numbers   of   cases   were   considered   (Palumbo, Alsalman,   De   Ridder,   Song   &amp;   Vanneste,   2018).

Studies measuring skin conductance during the presentation of misophonic triggers have shown a specific stress response to misophonic triggers in patients with misophonia but not in healthy controls (Edelstein et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2017). In addition; a study showed that people with misophonia showed a reduction in the N1 wave when recording event-related potentials compared to healthy controls with circumscribed auditory signals (Schröder et al., 2014).

In   recent   years,   some   functional   imaging   studies   have also   been   conducted   with   misophonia   patients   (Giorgi, 2015;   Kumar   et   al.,   2017;   Schröder,   San   Giorgi,   van Wingen,   Vulink   &amp;   Denys,   2015;   Schröder   et   al.,   2019). When   misophonic   stimuli   are   presented,   the   findings predominantly   show   an   increased   activation   in   the auditory   cortex   as   well   as   the   amygdala   and   other Likewise; impairments of executive functions under the The exact etiology of misophonia has not yet been presentation of misophonic stimuli in those affected sufficiently studied (Siepsiak &amp; Dragan; 2019). could be demonstrated in the Stroop interference test Jastreboff and Jastreboff, on the one hand, started (Daniels; Rodriguez &amp; Zabelina; 2020) as well as a from a dysfunction in the central auditory neuronal pathway tendency towards more controlled behavior in a stop On the other hand, assumed a conditioned reflex, signal test (Eijsker, Schröder Smit; van Wingen &amp; in the sense of classical conditioning according to Denys; 2019). Even if these findings do not allow any Pavlov, in which a misophonic noise (conditioned conclusions to be drawn about the underlying stimulus) causes a conditioned reaction (extreme pathomechanisms, they do point to a specific emotion and "fight-flight" reaction as a physiological physiological reaction in misophonia patients . reaction). triggers (Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff; 2014). Dozier (2015b), on the other hand, proposes a twostage model in which the triggering stimulus leads to an (unconditioned) muscle reflex; which in turn evokes an emotional response and thus to conditioning th reaction. In the second stage; additional triggering stimuli are created by previous As they

range of the limbic system (Eijsker, Schröder, Smit, van Wingen &amp; Denys; 2021; Giorgi, 2015; Schröder et al., 2015; Schröder et al., 2019). The investigation of Kumar et al. (2017) also found increased activation in the area of the anterior insular cortex (AIC), an area associated with directed attention to stimuli (salience) when misophonic triggers were presented. In addition; there was medial parietal and temporal regions.

Based on these findings; it is speculated that the stress response associated with the perception of misophonic stimuli is based less on increased perception of the stimulus itself, as in hyperacusis; and more on impaired affective evaluation and salience to the specific stimulus (Palumbo et al., 2018) However; a recent study did not find any differences in the activation of the auditory cortex in misophonia patients compared to healthy controls; but rather a stronger activation in areas associated with orofacial movements. These findings are linked to previous clinical findings showing that the noise of eating in particular is perceived as unpleasant, so that it is discussed whether increased activation of motor neurons could play a role in the development of misophonia (Kumar et al., 2021). Findings on structural changes in the white matter also indicate that the impaired visual perception of facial expressions could have a possible role in the development of misophonia symptoms (Eijsker;

## Diagnostics

In the following; all currently available instruments for assessing misophonia in children and adults are presented (see Table 2). The sub-item "Target group" shows whether the inventory can also be used with children and young people. There is currently no instrument specifically designed for children and young people.

## treatment

According to the study by Claiborn et al. (2020), only 24.7% of those affected report having sought treatment because of their symptoms. A big part reports little or no improvement in symptoms as a result of treatment. Counseling or talk therapy was used most frequently (13.7%), followed by treatment through cognitive behavioral therapy (8.2%) However; the treatment spectrum covered a very wide range from hypnosis (2.9%) to pharmacotherapy (2.8%). Talk therapy was associated negatively (b 0.93; p &lt; .001) and psychopharmacotherapy positively (b = -1.39; p &lt; 001) with symptom reduction: Outside of regular treatment; the most common coping strategies used by patients with misophonic symptoms include listening to music (99%), avoidingl

Leaving the situation (99%) or making noises (86 77%; Jager et al., 2020).

Current studies on the treatment of misophonia mostly only include uncontrolled case studieslcase series (Bernstein; Angell &amp; Dehle, 2013; Dozier, 2015a; Al resheed &amp; 2020; McGuire et al., 2015; Potgieter et al., 2019; Reid, Guzick; Gernand &amp; Olsen; 2016), which is why no specific treatment recommendations can yet be made. The treatment approaches known to date are briefly presented below. Haq, Tu,

## Cognitive   Behavioral   Therapy

First studies on confrontation therapies with misophonia patients were able to show that exposure to misophonia noises did not lead to direct habituation (Frank &amp; McKay, 2019), which is why the authors adapted their treatment model and included an inhibitory learning model in the treatment:. After further individual case studies in which cognitive behavioral therapy appeared to be promising (Bernstein et al., 2013; Dozier, 2015a, 2015b; McGuire et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2016), a first uncontrolled quasi-experimental study on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (eight 2-week sessions with concentration exercises, counterconditioning; stimulus manipulation; relaxation exercises) with N = 90 patients (28% male, Mage = 35.8; SD = 12.2) first evidence of a symptom reduction through the treatment was found den (Schröder et al., 2017). A first randomized controlled study on behavioral therapy for misophonia was carried out in Amsterdam in an outpatient setting with N = 71 adult patients (70.4% female; Mage = 33.06; SD 14.13) (Jager, Vulink; Bergfeld; van Loon &amp; 2021) Participants were assigned to either a 3-month weekly behavioral therapy regimen or a wait-list condition: The treatment condition was Denys,

In   the treatment   group,   37%   reported   a   clinically   significant   reduction   in symptoms,   compared   to   0%   in   the   waiting   condition.   The standardized   effect   size   of   the   behavioral   therapy   was d =   1.92. Other   therapeutic   interventions   that   have   been   described   in   case reports   or   case   series   include   transdiagnostic   cognitive-behavioural therapy   approaches   (Lewin   et   al.,   2021),   exposure   therapy (Rabasco   &amp;   McKay,   2021),   EMDR   (Eye   Movement   Desensitization and   Reprocessing;   Jager,   Vulink ,   de   Roos   &amp;   Denys,   2021)   and dialectical   behavioral   therapy   (Kamody   &amp;   Del   Conte,   2017).

## Alternative treatment models

In addition to cognitive behavioral therapy, there is initial evidence of the effectiveness of the "tinnitus retraining therapy" originally developed by Jastreboff and Jastreboff for tinnitus patients for misophonia as well (Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff, 2013, 2014). So far there are only single case studies on the pharmacological treatment of misophonia, e.g. B. with antidepressants (Sarigedik &amp; Yurteri; 2021). Based on the current interdisciplinary understanding of the disorder, Brout et al. (2018) in their review a multidisciplinary individual treatment model; in which not only psychiatrists but also departments such as neurology, audiology; occupational therapy, neuropsychology and clinical psychology are includedThe book "Misophonia: Lisa's anger and the noises" (Seebeck &amp; Homrighausen; 2020) was published especially for children and adolescents and can be a helpful tool for psychoeducation with affected children and adolescents_

## conclusion

At the current time; it is still questionable whether misophonia should be understood as a symptom manifestation of other underlying or comorbid diagnoses or should be considered as an independent diagnosis in the classification systems of psychiatric disorders

Other possible underlying pathomechanisms (e.g. pathophysiological processes, the influence of life events; the frequency and intensity of exposure to trigger noises) as well as protective and risk factors for the (individual) course of the disorder must be examined more closely in order to be able to determine a better (different

To be able to develop (cial) diagnostics on the one hand and a better understanding of therapeutic approaches on the other. Especially in children and adolescents there is little valid knowledge about epidemiology, symptom criteria and pathomechanism as well as treatment; but misophonia should be considered as a possible cause of stress reactions, especially in social tuations as well as with the described noise sensitivity are taken into account.
