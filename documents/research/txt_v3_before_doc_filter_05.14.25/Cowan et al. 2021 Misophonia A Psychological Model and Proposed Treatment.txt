Rigidity ABSTRACT  
Misophonia is a condition characterized by strong reactions to specific sounds which are usually emitted by other 
people. The condition can be debilitating due to the distress and avoidance that it involves, at times resulting in 
significant occupational and relational dysfunction. The aim of this paper is to offer a theoretical account that 
can explain the phenomenology of misophonia that has been reported in the literature. To this end, we argue that 
misophonia emerges out of a rigid character style in combination with contextual factors and classical and 
operant conditioning processes. Based on this model, we also offer a treatment approach called experiential 
acceptance and stimulus engagement (EASE). It consists of three main components: ending toxic hope, reduction 
of avoidance, and stimulus engagement. .   
Misophonia is a condition characterized by the experience of intense 
negative emotions in reaction to specific sounds (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 
2002 ). The emotional response is often described as strong feelings of 
anger or annoyance towards the source of the sound, which is typically 
another person. The most common sound triggers are made by the 
mouth and include chewing, crunching, lip-smacking, and sipping. 
Further, other triggers include repetitive sounds such as foot tapping and 
pen clicking (Edelstein et al., 2013 ). While anger is the most commonly 
reported reaction, irritability, annoyance, anxiety, and disgust may also 
be experienced (Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ). Many sufferers report expe-
riencing violent urges towards the source of the sound, although rarely 
do any act on their urges (Schroder et al., 2013 ). Many also report a 
strong physiological response, including the body tensing up and other 
reflexive behaviors (Dozier et al., 2017 ; Schwartz et al., 2011 ). In-
dividuals experiencing misophonia describe not only distress upon 
hearing these sounds but also a state of anxious apprehension and 
hypervigilance for future occurrences of the sound (Edelstein et al., 
2013 ). Moreover, these individuals report avoiding places where they 
will likely encounter unwanted sounds, such as the family dinner table, 
leading in many cases to reduced quality of life and functional impair -
ment (Schroder et al., 2013 ). Indeed, some patients distance themselves 
from the people they are closest to, resulting in social isolation 
(Schwartz et al., 2011 ). Patients report often engaging in coping behaviors involving blocking out sounds using headphones and other 
devices, although these methods are often found to be impractical 
(Frank & McKay, 2019 ). The significant distress and social and occu-
pational dysfunction associated with misophonia make it a public health 
concern. As yet, however, misophonia has not been categorized as a 
discrete disorder for diagnostic purposes, although some have argued 
that it should receive this status based on the reduced functioning 
associated with it (Schroder et al., 2013 ). 
The prevalence rate for misophonia is not yet known despite several 
calls for additional epidemiological research (Cavanna & Seri, 2015 ; 
Dozier et al., 2017 ; Taylor, 2017 ). In a study which surveyed 483 un-
dergraduate students, 22.8% reported that they were “often ” or “al-
ways ” sensitive to specific sounds (Wu et al., 2014 ). In a different 
undergraduate sample (N 336), 49.1% reported significant symptoms 
of misophonia, with 37% reporting mild symptoms, 12% reporting 
moderate symtoms, and only 0.03% reporting severe symptoms (Naylor 
et al., 2020 ). Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2014) estimated that 3.2% of the 
population suffers from the condition, which would make it more 
common than OCD and related disorders. Misophonia was first recog -
nized and treated within the context of tinnitus treatment, as high co-
morbidity rates have been observed between the two conditions 
(Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2002 ). Misophonia has been reported to be 
comorbid with other conditions, as well, such as obsessive-compulsive

2personality disorder (OCPD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and mood disorders (Schroder 
et al., 2013 ). The average age of onset has been consistently reported to 
be in childhood or adolescence, with symptoms often worsening over 
time (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ). 
Currently, the etiology of misophonia remains unclear with no 
comprehensive theoretical framework available to explain the various 
symptoms associated with the condition. Jastreboff and Jastreboff 
(2002) have offered a neurophysiological model to explain the condi -
tion, which is discussed explored later in this paper. While under -
standing neurophysiological contributors to misophonia symptoms is 
important, the growing body of research suggests that there are salient 
psychological variables at play in this condition, which may hold the 
keys to the development of a comprehensive treatment. The aim of this 
paper is to highlight some of these psychological processes through a 
critical review of important findings that have emerged in misophonia 
research. Through examination of these factors, the paper will offer a 
psychological framework for understanding the development and 
maintenance of misophonia symptoms. Finally, a treatment approach 
that follows from this psychological model will be outlined. To achieve 
these aims, the paper is divided into three sections. The first section will 
critically review prominent features of misophonia, which we believe 
offer direction for the development of a psychological model. These 
findings consist of contextual variables often associated with misopho -
nia and visual triggers for the misophonia response. In the second sec-
tion, we will suggest a theoretical model for misophonia that 
incorporates these factors, as well as findings that personality-related 
variables (e.g., rigidity, rule-governed behavior) may play a substan -
tial role in development of the condition. Lastly, in the third section, a 
treatment approach will be proposed. Within the treatment section, we 
will also discuss some of the potential obstacles to misophonia treatment 
and ways to effectively address them. 
1.Misophonia: important findings and questions 
One intriguing phenomenon consistently reported by the majority of 
patients diagnosed with misophonia is the adverse reaction to sounds 
which emanate from specific individuals. Edelstein et al. (2013) found 
that 82% of their clinical sample (N 11) reported that the sound 
triggers were localized around certain individuals, often family mem-
bers. This phenomenon is also reported in almost all of the misophonia 
case studies (Bernstein et al., 2013 ; Johnson et al., 2013 ; McGuire et al., 
2015 ; Neal & Cavanna, 2013 ). Why, we might ask, would someone be 
triggered only by one person making the specific sound and not another? 
Further, even with individuals that experience the same reaction in 
response to many people (e.g. family, friends, and strangers), the 
strength of the response is not the same across all individuals. That an 
individual develops such a unique reaction to the behavior of specific 
individuals suggests that there is, at least in part, a context-specific re-
action and not a general neurological deficit that results with heightened 
sensitivity to specific sounds. Further, individuals with misophonia 
report they experience no differences in response to sounds that the 
general population find aversive (Kumar et al., 2017 ) indicating that the 
response is not a general sensitivity to all sounds, and denoting a 
possible contextual explanation. 
A second finding of importance is that a significant portion of pa-
tients with misophonia are not only triggered by sounds, but also 
experience a similar reaction to visual stimuli (Dozier, 2015 ; Edelstein 
et al., 2013 ; Johnson et al., 2013 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ). These include 
repetitive movements, such as shaking of the leg or other body parts. The 
fact that patients with misophonia report that they experience anger in 
reaction to both auditory and visual triggers leads to questions about the 
importance of the perceptual source relative to how the individual reacts 
to any stimulus – auditory or visual – in a situation. This is significant as 
a substantial portion of the literature on misophonia has viewed the 
problem as an audiological condition. Indeed, misophonia was first identified by audiologists and assumed to be primarily a hearing-related 
concern. Yet the phenomenology of the condition appears to be broader 
than hearing alone. That many individuals who experience anger in the 
context of specific sounds also experience it from visual cues suggests 
that it is something in the interpersonal context that makes these per-
ceptions so deeply bothersome. Any adequate conceptual model of 
misophonia will need to account for this finding. 
In summary, there are two findings associated with misophonia 
which seem to be vital in further understanding the condition. First, 
most patients presenting with misophonia report that they respond to 
sounds from specific people, often family members (Edelstein et al., 
2013 ). Second, these individuals report similarly intense negative re-
actions to both auditory and visual stimuli (Edelstein et al., 2013 ). Our 
aim in the next section is to develop a psychological model for miso-
phonia which will address these two points. 
2.A psychological model of misophonia 
While there is currently no comprehensive psychological model for 
misophonia, existing explanations of the phenomenon do include psy-
chological variables. Some have pointed out that Jastreboff and Jas-
treboff ’s (2002) neural mechanism model of misophonia is supported by 
classical conditioning, given that it postulates that patients with miso-
phonia have an enhanced connection between their limbic system, 
autonomic nervous system, and auditory system (Palumbo et al., 2018 ). 
Accordingly, anger would be the unconditioned response and the sound 
triggers acting as the conditioned stimulus (Palumbo et al., 2018 ). Op-
erant conditioning is also present as exhibited by the avoidance of the 
sounds, which negatively reinforces the association between the nega-
tive affect and the sound triggers (Palumbo et al., 2018 ). Moreover, 
avoidant behaviors and the use of anger expression as stimulus control 
are also negatively reinforced to the extent that they reduce exposure to 
the aversive sound trigger. 
While we agree that classical conditioning is important to under -
standing misophonia, we would argue that this specific conceptualiza -
tion does not fully explain the learning from a Pavlovian perspective. We 
agree that sound triggers serve as the conditioned stimulus and that the 
anger serves as both the unconditioned and conditioned responses . What 
needs to be clarified, however, is what constitutes the unconditioned 
stimulus in this model. That is, what is the variable which originally 
elicited the anger response which came to be associated with the sound 
trigger? What makes one person initially respond with anger that would 
establish the conditions for Pavlovian learning? We believe that the 
unconditioned stimulus in this case pertains to both the relational 
context and the psychological profile of patient – specifically, the pa-
tient ’s personality, cognitions and emotions, and experiential 
avoidance. 
2.1. Personality traits 
Psychological factors that can contribute to responding to a neutral 
sound with intense negative emotions include features of the patient ’s 
character (i.e., the style of interpersonal behavior). One potential per-
sonality trait, which could potentially be related to the development of 
misophonia, are traits of rigidity, inflexibility, and a strong need for 
control. This is indicated by the high rates of traits of obsessive- 
compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) and perfectionism found to 
be associated with misophonia. Prior to reviewing these findings, it is 
may be useful to offer some background on OCPD and perfectionism. 
The former is described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5 ; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 
2013 ) as a “pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, 
perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of 
flexibility, openness and efficiency as indicated by four (or more) ” traits 
(p. 678). The DSM-5 lists eight traits associated with OCPD: (a) excessive 
preoccupation with details, (b) task-interfering perfectionism, (c) E.N. Cowan et al.

Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders 32 (2022) 100691
3excessive devotion to work resulting in diminished leisure and friend -
ship activities, (d) inflexibility about moral and ethical standards, (e) 
hoarding behavior, (f) shows difficulty in task delegation, (g) miser -
liness, and (h) exhibits rigidity and stubbornness. A subset of individuals 
with OCPD are typically seen as rigid and overly controlling as they are 
excessively concerned about doing things the “right ” way (Pinto, 2016 ). 
They tend to experience significant interpersonal difficulties as a result 
of setting impossibly high standards that can lead to reactions of anger 
and hostility when not met (Pollack, 1987 ). Relatedly, perfectionism is 
often considered a multidimensional construct characterized by a strong 
aversion of making mistakes, high personal standards, perception of 
high parental expectations and parental criticism, doubting quality of 
one’s actions, and a strong preference for order (Frost et al., 1990 ). 
As indicated above, rigidity and associated traits have been found to 
be highly prevalent among individuals with misophonia. For example, 
Schroder et al. (2013) found that 52% of their misophonia clinical 
sample (N 42) met full criteria for OCPD. This was the highest co-
morbidity rate found in their study, followed by a 7% comorbidity with 
mood disorders. The authors suggested that a potential hypothesis for 
the etiology of misophonia is that the pattern of behavior found in OCPD 
predisposes misophonia. Further they suggested that “a morally strict 
person may have difficulties coping with impolite eating sounds, even-
tually resulting in avoidance. ” In a subsequent study with a significantly 
larger misophonia clinical sample (N 575), 26% reported traits of 
OCPD (Jager et al., 2020 ). Most notably, they also found that 97% of 
their sample reported symptoms of clinical perfectionism . Edelstien et al. 
(2013) found 18% of their sample reporting traits of 
obsessive-compulsive personality. Rouw and Erfanian (2018) , however, 
found an 8% comorbidity rate. The large disparity between the findings 
are likely due to differences in methodology between the studies. Spe-
cifically, Schroder et al. (2013) and Jager et al. (2020) conducted full 
structured interviews, whereas Rouw and Erfanian (2018) asked the 
participants to indicate if they had a diagnosis from a list of disorders, 
one of which was OCPD. From our clinical observations, individuals 
meeting criteria for OCPD may not be aware that they demonstrate these 
characteristics. Indeed, personality conditions typically require a degree 
of insight to realize that their challenges are related to their personality. 
That said, 8% still is a notable comorbidity rate despite these method -
ological limitations and is consistent with other findings. Further, across 
all of these studies misophonia had significantly higher comorbidity rate 
with OCPD traits relative to any other diagnosis. 
Rigidity and inflexibility was also reported in all published miso-
phonia case studies that we are aware of. In a study of three patients 
with misophonia, all three patients were found to meet full criteria for 
OCPD (Natalini et al., 2019 ). Consistently, all three presented with 
schemas of “unrelenting standards/hypocriticalness. ” In another study, 
a 14-year-old female being treated for misophonia was described by her 
parents “as a high achiever with a history of perfectionistic tendencies ” 
who “showed signs of scrupulosity at a young age, with excessive 
concern for following rules and not hurting her friends ’ feelings ” (Muller 
et al., 2018 ). In a study which reported on two cases, one of the patients 
was a 29-year-old married female who was described by her husband as 
“meticulous, huffy, ” and “prescriptive ” (Hocaoglu, 2018 ). The authors 
added that this patient was reported to have a “rigorous, prescriptive, 
and punctual personality since her adolescence. ” Further, on the Min-
nesota Multiplex Personality Inventory (MMPI), which they adminis -
tered, they found she “could have a perfectionistic attitude. ” The second 
patient ’s MMPI also yielded this finding. Lastly, Kluckow et al. (2014) 
explored the relationship between eating disorders and misophonia in 
three patients. In screening for personality factors, they found that all 
three patients reported features of OCPD. 
Rigidity in misophonia was also indicated in a study which perhaps 
took the closest look at the relationship between personality and miso-
phonia (Cassiello-Robins et al., 2021 ). Using both the SCID-I and 
SCID-II, they found in their clinical sample (N 49) that full criteria for 
OCPD was met by 10.2%, 12.2% for borderline personality disorder (BPD), and 8.2% for avoidant personality disorder (APD). Natalini et al. 
(2019) also found in her case study of three patients, at least one met 
criteria for BPD and one for APD. Both BPD and APD exhibit an avoidant 
and inflexible disposition; while the underlying reasons for avoiding 
may be different in these conditions (e.g. interpersonal rejection and/or 
abandonment) an inflexible disposition is generally present. 
2.2. Rigidity-related cognitions and emotions in misophonia 
Findings suggesting a relationship between misophonia and rigidity 
are consistent with research related to the cognitions and emotions of 
misophonia patients. For example, McKay et al. (2018) found that the 
cognitions associated with misophonia are an inflated sense of re-
sponsibility, perfectionism, and intolerance for uncertainty. Individuals 
with rigidity often engage in perfectionistic behaviors and hold 
exceedingly high standards for themselves (Pinto, 2016 ), which can 
generate an inflated sense of personal responsibility. Holding high and 
rigid standards is also consistent with the finding that the majority of 
patients with misophonia described the trigger sounds as invasive, 
intrusive, insulting, violating, offensive, disgusting, and rude (Edelstein 
et al., 2013 ), suggesting that they held an expectation or judgement that 
people should not make these sounds and that this expectation was 
violated. Intolerance of uncertainty has also been found to be signifi -
cantly associated with rigidity (Gallagher et al., 2003 ), and is highly 
consistent with the environmental and situational control that in-
dividuals with rigidity seek to exercise. 
The emotions associated with misophonia are also consistent with 
the rigid personality profile. As indicated above, common misophonic 
reactions to sounds are anger, annoyance, disgust, and irritability 
(Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2002 ). Increased anger 
and irritability are often experienced by individuals with OCPD char-
acterological features (Pollack, 1987 ). Their high standards and rigid 
expectations for themselves and their environment may lead to anger 
when unwanted or unanticipated events or experiences occur. Consis -
tent with this, findings indicates that when experiencing lower levels of 
anger, patients are less likely to experience misophonic reactions to their 
typical triggering sources (Natalini et al., 2019 ). For example, one re-
ported absence of a misophonic reactions from his typical triggering 
source because he felt guilty about something he did towards that per-
son. Another example involved a female patient who did not experience 
the reaction when she felt her husband was affectionate towards her. 
2.3. Experiential avoidance in rigidity 
Another variable that is likely to play an important role in the 
development of misophonia is experiential avoidance (EA). A trans -
diagnostic construct, EA is defined as an unwillingness to be in contact 
with unpleasant, uncomfortable, aversive private experiences, including 
bodily sensations, memories, and feelings, as well as engagement in 
behaviors and actions to evade these unwanted experiences and the 
events which elicit them (Hayes et al., 1996 ). EA is associated with a 
range of psychopathology, particularly mood and anxiety disorders 
(Chawla & Ostafin, 2007 ). The basic premise of EA is that it is not the 
experiencing of the unpleasant stimulus which is problematic but rather 
how one relates to the experience. Within the context of misophonia this 
appears relevant as individuals often attempt to avoid and rid them -
selves of the aversive experience associated with the sound triggers. 
EA is believed to play a role in the functional impairment associated 
with several conditions. For example, in obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD), which typically involves intrusive thoughts that create anxiety 
and are followed by compulsions which function to neutralize the anx-
iety. Unwanted cognitions of this kind are reported to be experienced by 
90% –99% of the general population (Freeston et al., 1991 ; Rachman & 
de Silva, 1978 ). However, only a small segment of the population 
(approximately 2.5%) develops symptoms of OCD, in which affected 
individuals respond to intrusive thoughts with ritualistic behavior to E.N. Cowan et al.

Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders 32 (2022) 100691
4reduce distress (APA, 2013). Models in the OCD literature suggest that 
compulsions result in part from an unaccepting disposition, and efforts 
to get rid of the intrusive thoughts lead to further distress (Eifert & 
Forsyth, 2005). It could be argued that patients with misophonia share 
the same disposition towards the sounds as those with OCD. Since the 
sounds are unwanted, avoided, and “pushed away,” they are more likely 
to be salient and distressing. This paradoxical condition is similar to the 
white bear phenomenon, or the ironic process theory of mental control, 
which describes the process by which attempts at thought suppression 
increase the frequency of the unwanted thoughts (Wegner et al., 1987). 
The presence of this phenomenon in association with misophonia has yet 
to be explored empirically, however, it does appear to play a role as it 
does with OCD (Abramowitz et al., 2001), as well as chronic pain (Burns 
et al., 2008) and tinnitus (Hesser et al., 2013). An EA-based conceptu -
alization of misophonia was suggested by Schneider and Arch (2017) 
and was utilized to successfully treat a misophonia patient using an 
acceptance-based protocol they developed. 
2.4. Theoretical model for misophonia 
We will now turn to our proposed psychological model for miso-
phonia. Prior to doing so, it may serve useful to provide a vignette of a 
misophonia case: 
Emily, a 14-year-old high school freshman, was referred by her 
mother for experiencing an extreme aversion to a range of sounds 
including chewing, slurping, yawning, sniffling. When triggered she 
would experience a strong feeling of anger– at times even rage–towards 
the person making the sounds. These sounds were particularly triggering 
when a family member would emit them, with her mother and sister 
eliciting the strongest reactions. Emily would primarily cope by asking 
the triggering individual to stop making the triggering sound, leaving 
the room, or generally avoiding situations where the trigger might 
occur. The situation created tension in the household as Emily consis -
tently asked people to stop producing the trigger sounds, which often led 
to arguments and verbal altercations. Emily also reported that she ten-
ded to worry about the triggers and how she would deal with situations 
where she would likely encounterthem. 
Emily was described by her mother as someone who has a tough time 
with change, especially changing social environments. Starting high 
school had been a difficult transition from middle school. She exceled in 
school, but tended toexperience significant stress before exams and 
“berated” herself if she did not get a grade as high as she was expecting. 
Socially she tended to be people pleasing, but also had a tough time 
dealing with friends that did not act in accordance with her expecta -
tions. She had recently cut off a close friend whom she felt “should have 
been more thoughtful” when she wore t-shirt depicting a popular singer 
that she “can’t stand.” Emily’s father was reported to run the house like a 
“tight ship” and did not easily overlook mistakes or mishaps, often 
exhibiting frustration towards family members that violated his ex-
pected rules such as not taking food outside eating areas or failing to be 
punctual with time. 
Emily stated that she was willing to try therapy when she realized 
that the triggers were “spreading” to other people outside of her family. 
This awareness led her to consider that her responses may not stem 
merely from the behavior of her family members and to acknowledge 
that she might play a part in the problem. 
As indicated in the aforementioned literature review, rigidity ap-
pears to be associated with misophonia. In this vignette as well, Emily 
appears to be presenting with some symptoms of rigidity such as her 
expectation that her friend should follow a rule to not wear a shirt that is 
not agreeable to her, strict expectations of her own academic success, 
and difficulty with changes to her routine. Based on the possibility that 
rigidity and EA play an active role in the development of misophonia, 
the following can be proposed as a psychological model of misophonia. 
As suggested by Schroder et al. (2013), the presence of rigidity pre-
disposes the development of misophonia. Rigidity leads to the rejection of specific sound, which results in an emotional reaction of anger. This 
reaction serves as the initial pairing between the sound triggers and 
negative emotional reactivity. 
Rigidity can also explain why individuals with misophonia experi -
ence a negative reaction to the behavior of specific individuals. It is not 
the sound itself that elicits their reactions but the person emitting the 
sound. Importantly, we believe that there are predisposing events that 
influence the negative reaction to this specific person. Being irritated or 
annoyed at a parent, for example, can lead one to be less tolerant of 
things which would otherwise not be noticed. It is entirely possible to 
imagine a child with perfectionistic traits who is disappointed or 
annoyed at one of her parents, and she became more judgmental and less 
tolerant of unpleasant sounds emitted by this parent. For example, in 
Emily’s case, she has been feeling frustrated towards her mother because 
she has not supported her decision to cut off her friend, she felt betrayed 
by her mother leaving her feeling anger towards her. Unlike someone 
who is more flexible, Emily relying on rigid, perfectionistic, and control- 
oriented strategies may not habituate to the sound, instead viewing the 
sound as wrong and not “permitting” the sound to be there. 
With rigidity leading to greater awareness of the sound, the indi-
vidual finds him or herself hearing a sound that is unwanted. To avoid the 
unwanted sound, he or she can either physically leave the room or 
attempt to ignore the sound, as exemplified in Emily’s case. This 
avoidance paradoxically leaves one with even greater awareness of the 
sound, which can lead to further distress and anger. This situation, 
which has been described as being “trapped” (Edelstein et al., 2013), 
leaves the individual in an emotional upheaval capable of creating a 
strong association between the person making the sound and the 
negative emotions. It is at this point where classical conditioning be-
comes relevant, in the following manner: the unconditioned stimulus is 
the negative interpersonal interactions with a family member (such as 
Emily’s mother who did not support her) which, in combination with 
rigidity, leads to unconditioned response of anger. Specifically, a family 
member makes a neutral sound (such as chewing) which elicits a 
judgement that the sound is wrong (“why is he/she chewing so loudly?“), 
which leads to a response of anger. This affective response subsequently 
becomes paired with otherwise neutral sounds from that person, making 
those sounds a conditioned stimulus, which elicits anger as a condi -
tioned response. Once this connection has been developed, it is also 
reinforced through operant conditioning since the individual avoids the 
situations in which the specific sounds are often emitted (e.g., meal 
times, such as in the case with Emily) or engages in anger expression (e. 
g., criticism) designed to punish (and thereby control) the other person’s 
behavior. 
Evidence suggests that thinking about the sounds, which occurs 
during states of hypervigilance and worry, also reinforces the associa -
tion (Joos et al., 2013). Further, generalization may occur in some in-
stances, creating associations to similar situations and other sounds. 
Generalization could extend to other classes of stimuli, too. Visual 
stimuli, for example, can be viewed as unacceptable and lead to the same 
reaction hypothesized with misophonia. Though they may develop from 
a similar process, visual stimuli seem to be less often reported as the 
source of distress. This may be attributable to the fact that it is easier to 
avert one’s gaze and avoid looking at something than it is to avoid 
hearing a sound. Generalization, too, can explain how the misophonia 
reaction can be experienced outside of the close family context. That is, 
the trigger itself becomes associated with aversive sensations and feel-
ings which can be elicited by ones broader context (e.g. school, work) 
which can then lead to further avoidance and dysfunction. Thus, the 
deleterious impact of misophonia can spill over beyond the confines of 
the original triggering context. However, the strongest reactions to 
triggers still appear to consistently be reported with those from closer 
interpersonal relationships. This may be related to the “personal” nature 
of triggers; it is more hurtful when someone who is expected to be caring 
such as a family relative or intimate partner, as compared to those who 
are less likely to be held to that expectation. Further, those outside the E.N. Cowan et al.

5family context are less likely to be aware of the triggering nature of their 
actions which can impact the subjective level of how painful the trigger 
is experienced. 
In summary, our model postulates that an individual with a rigid 
disposition may resist accepting a sound made by a person with whom 
there is an interpersonal conflict and will view the sound as unaccept -
able leading to anger should the sound recur or persist. An unaccepting 
disposition towards the sounds, ironically, leads to a heightened 
awareness of the sound. Efforts to avoid (both physical and cognitive) 
may provide temporary relief but also yield a hypervigilant attention to 
the sound, thus leaving the individual even more acutely aware of the 
sound ’s presence, and less accepting of the sounds. The more awareness 
there is, the more distressing it is, and thus the more it is resisted. The 
result is a vicious cycle as the greater awareness of distress around the 
sound, the more rigid one can become about the sounds (Fig. 1). An 
association is developed between the sounds and the negative emotion 
of anger, which is then maintained by negative reinforcement, and 
subsequently can generalize to other sounds and triggering sources 
(including visual stimuli) due to generalization (Fig. 2). 
It should be noted that there is growing body of evidence suggesting 
that anxiety may play a role in the etiology of misophonia. For example, 
Cassiello Robins et al. (2021) found that anxiety symptoms partially 
mediated the relationship between symptoms of personality disorders 
and symptoms of misophonia. These findings are consistent with our 
model as it is possible that the fear of getting triggered can generate a 
greater effort to attempt to control and avoid the trigger which can, in 
turn, worsen the symptoms of misophonia. Thus, from the perspective of 
this model, we believe the presence of anxiety is secondary to the initial 
development and maintenance of the misophonia. Specifically, once the 
aforementioned processes are in place, the individual experiences anx-
iety over getting trapped in triggering situation and not having any 
strategies to cope. A similar example is individuals with OCD who fear 
getting into a situation where their fear of contamination is triggered 
(such as an important meeting in a restaurant) and they won ’t have the 
ability to get away from the situation to conduct a time-consuming 
ritual. Besides for the actual problem (OCD) there is an additional fear 
(impaired access to relief). So too, with misophonia, besides for the 
actual problem (misophonia) there is a secondary anxiety (getting 
trapped with triggers). Importantly, these findings relating to anxiety 
will have practical implications for the treatment, as we will discuss 
further down. 2.5. Misophonia treatments 
This conceptualization of misophonia is only relevant to the degree it 
can enhance the efficacy of treatment for the condition. There are 
several case studies that reported psychological interventions that were 
developed using existing therapeutic techniques, with many of them 
reporting reductions in misophonia symptoms (Bernstein et al., 2013 ; 
McGuire et al., 2015 ; Muller et al., 2018 ; Schneider & Arch, 2017 ). 
Almost half of 90 patients in an open trial showed significant reductions 
in misophonic symptoms (Schroder et al., 2017 ). Frank and McKay 
(2019) found evidence supporting the suitability for utilizing exposure 
strategies based on an inhibitory learning approach. The interventions 
in these studies primarily consisted of protocols that derived their 
components from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), acceptance and 
commitment therapy (ACT), and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). 
These components included cognitive restructuring (i.e., Bernstein et al., 
2013 ; McGuire et al., 2015 ), exposure and response prevention (ERP; i. 
e., Frank & McKay, 2019 ; McGuire et al., 2015 ; Muller et al., 2018 ), 
counterconditioning (i.e., Dozier, 2015 ; Frank & McKay, 2019 ; Schroder 
et al., 2017 ), relaxation exercises (i.e., Schroder et al., 2017 ), acceptance 
and distress tolerance strategies (i.e., Schneider & Arch, 2017 ), and 
improving interpersonal communication skills (i.e. Bernstein et al., 
2013 ; Muller et al., 2018 ). Overall, a large emphasis was placed on 
exposure to the sound, a treatment strategy that resembles ERP for OCD 
and anxiety. Indeed, some have argued that misophonia is an OCD 
spectrum condition (Schroder et al., 2013 ), suggesting that 
exposure-based approaches should be useful. 
2.6. Treatment considerations 
We believe that the structure of ERP is consistent with our proposed 
treatment for misophonia, though there are very significant differences 
between how exposures are applied to misophonia relative to OCD and 
its related conditions. The differences are related to the (1) interpersonal 
nature of misophonia and (2) the primary emotion associated with it 
which is consistently reported to be anger. 
2.7. Interpersonal nature of misophonia 
We believe that the interpersonal element present in misophonia 
alters the structure of the exposures in a qualitative way. In exposure- 
based interventions that target acceptance of something unwanted (e. 
g., emotion, outcome, sensation, memory), the reduction of symptoms 
typically follows when one ceases to resist an unwanted experience and 
develops a willingness to experience it, to accept it. Importantly, 
acceptance appears to occur when an individual realizes that their ef-
forts to get rid of pain, anxiety or any unwanted experience is a hopeless 
endeavor, thus leaving one “cornered ” with the choice of either 
accepting one’s experience, or further utilizing unhelpful coping stra-
tegies that are associated with dysfunction and suffering (Hayes et al., 
2012 ). In order for acceptance to occur there must be qualitative shift in 
how one relates to the unwanted experiences. It requires a willingness 
and openness to experience the unwanted experience, and the willing -
ness needs to be complete —it’s all or nothing (Hayes et al., 2012 ). If one 
is willing to experience the unwanted experience, acceptance can occur 
and symptoms often subside. For example, in OCD, intrusive thoughts 
are reduced when they are allowed to emerge without attempts to 
control or neutralize them (Craske et al., 2008 ). With chronic pain, too, 
the pain is less intrusive when attempts to get rid of the pain are ended 
and they are “allowed ” to be there (Dahl et al., 2004 ). 
If a goal of treating misophonia is for the patient to accept the ex-
istence of the triggering sounds and associated emotions, the path to 
acceptance appears different than OCD, chronic pain, and other forms of 
unwanted experiences. Misophonia has two core elements that make the 
acceptance process different: the misophonia response is perceived to be 
the result of (a) someone else making a sound who (b) can choose to stop 
Fig. 1.Vicious cycle which contributes to the development and maintenance 
of misophonia. E.N. Cowan et al.

6the sound. Within this paradigm, the mere exposure and acceptance of 
the sounds will not be sufficient because it is not the sounds per se that 
are problematic but the people who are making them. Affected in-
dividuals can tell themselves that they are willing to accept the sounds, 
but in the back of their minds they may still be believing that the person 
making the sounds can (and should) stop. The fact that triggering sources 
can willingly end the sound poses as a challenge to acceptance. People 
may be less likely to accept a situation of suffering if there is a perception that 
others (who are often perceived to be the cause of the suffering) are able to 
change their behavior and reduce the suffering. Further, and importantly, 
this situation is compounded by the reality that the individual with 
misophonia has asked loved ones to refrain from the triggers only to find 
their request forgotten, ignored, or denied (as exemplified in Emily’s 
case). Thus, misophonia patients may believe that the sounds are out of 
their control, but, importantly, they still consider the sounds to be in the 
volitional control of others (which is often technically true). This di-
chotomy can hinder the willingness to accept the sound because they 
may see “hope” in the disappearance of the triggering sounds by others 
withholding the producing of such sounds. This hope can reduce the 
willingness to experience the sounds and emotions, thus hindering the 
acceptance process. Hence, one of the aims of misophonia treatment is to 
help the patient accept the sounds as an unchangeable phenomenon in 
their life despite the reality that others can technically control the 
triggers from occurring. Additionally, this hope that others may refrain 
from the triggers may make the individual feel that they themselves may 
have some control over the trigger in situations where they do have 
some interpersonal influence over the source of the sound which can 
make this unhelpful form of hope even stronger. 
2.8. Salience of anger in misophonia 
A second difference between the application of ERP for OCD versus 
misophonia is related to the salience of anger in the misophonic 
response. In order to treat misophonia it is imperative to work towards 
understanding this emotion so it can be properly addressed. Anger is 
often described as an emotion which emerges in reaction to a perceived 
injustice or unfair treatment (Berkowitz, 1990). For example, when 
patients with misophonia perceive that making chewing sounds is 
invasive and disgusting (Edelstein et al., 2013), it elicits the emotion of 
anger as these perceptions suggest that the situation is wrong, unfair, 
and unjust. The emotion is sustained so long that the individual per-
ceives the situation is wrong and should be changed. If in OCD the 
therapeutic process is focused in engendering a framework where the 
sufferer can learn to accept and be open to unwanted future outcomes, 
then here the work is different in that the focus is accepting an unwanted 
situation that is already present. The temporal element greatly shifts the 
focus in qualitative way, such what is being accepting is an unwanted 
reality that is very unlikely to change. When an individual “come to 
terms” with a reality and refrains from working to change it, anger 
subsides. How one comes accepts this reality will be the focus of the 
proposed therapy. 
Taking into consideration anger and the interpersonal nature of the 
condition, we will now turn to suggest a treatment approach that flows 
from our psychological model for misophonia. In the following section 
we will offer a description and rationale of our treatment framework for 
misophonia which we have termed experiential acceptance and stimulus 
engagement (EASE). 3.A misophonia treatment framework: experiential acceptance 
and stimulus engagement 
In this section we aim to outline a general framework for psycho -
therapy tailored for the treatment of misophonia. The goal here is to 
provide the parameters and basic core components for a treatment 
which we believe can be effective, and thus warrant future research. 
EASE is currently not meant to serve as a formal treatment protocol or 
manual. 
The core goal of EASE for misophonia is to address the maintaining 
factors of the condition, which we have postulated to be rigidity and 
avoidance. As per our model, rigidity contributes to a resistant dispo -
sition toward the sounds, which leaves the individual with greater cued 
awareness of the sounds. This heightened awareness, in turn, generates 
even greater resistance to the sounds, thus contributing to a negative 
cycle. Cultivating flexibility and openness, which can thereby lead to 
acceptance, will be the ultimate aim of the treatment. In other words, 
the aim of the therapy is to address the conditions that give rise to ri-
gidity in order to develop flexibility by using the following three com-
ponents: (1) ending toxic hope, (2) eliminating avoidance and control 
strategies, and (3) engagement in situations with triggering stimuli. In 
addition to these components, the intervention begins with psycho -
education about misophonia, an outline of the treatment model, and a 
review of the rationale for the treatment. In the following sections we 
will describe each component of EASE. 
3.1. Ending toxic hope 
As discussed earlier, when someone perceives that they are the 
victim of an injustice, the associated emotion is anger. People generally 
do not readily permit and allow themselves to be the subject of an 
injustice and it follows that they will struggle to end the unjust condi -
tions. However, if a person does not believe that the situation can be 
changed, despite that it is unjust, there will likely not be a struggle as the 
mere behaviors to change the situation are hopeless. Embedded within 
the rigidly held view that others should not make aversive sounds is the 
hope that the sounds and thus the distress will somehow end. The aim of 
this step is to end the hope that the sounds will end; one will likely not 
place hope in a possibility that has zero chances of occurring. Inversely, 
it is very likely that this hope is what fuels efforts to eliminate the 
triggers (e.g., punishing those who emit the sounds, avoiding meal-
times). Moreover, akin to hoping for something that is outside the realm 
of likelihood (such as the spontaneous resurrection of a deceased pet), 
the mere hope itself is unhelpful, if not dysfunctional. This form of hope 
we label “toxic hope.” We believe that toxic hope leaves a person feeling 
that they may have some power to end the triggers in their life, despite 
the enduring reality suggesting otherwise. It is then crucial to directly 
address this feeling by cultivating, willingly, a powerlessness in the face 
of the triggers. This disposition powerlessness is necessary for the 
qualitatively reducing other forms of control that in turn maintain 
misophonia. When the individual knows there are no options and feels 
powerless, he or she can accept the unavoidable reality of the triggers: 
there are no options left. When this happens, the reaction of anger 
should be less instense. Unavoidable experiences are less likely to be 
construed as injustices than events over which people can exercise 
control. . 
The idea of simply letting go and not trying to do something about 
the triggers can be viewed as somewhat perplexing and even 
Fig. 2.Initial development of misophonia explained in terms of classical and operant conditioning.  E.N. Cowan et al.

Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders 32 (2022) 100691
7unacceptable in the sense that one is not protecting themselves from 
harm. In this regard, it useful to use a metaphor called “playing dead,” 
which describes how to survive being attacked by a grizzly bear. The 
practice involves simply lying on the floor and “playing dead.” While 
this is a very counterintuitive response, it also is the most functional one. 
Similarly, in misophonia, the goal is to resist the instinctual response to 
“do something” and instead “do nothing.” By choosing “non-doing” and 
expecting the trigger to stay the same, the individual can then learn to 
accept the presence of the trigger. 
This step can be enhanced through usage of an imaginal technique 
we termed “the victorious surrender.” This latter point involves imaging 
oneself with a trigger and coming up with all the ways the individual 
will try to escape the situation. The therapist guides the individual to 
“give up” each one of those strategies until they are left with nothing. 
Also addressed is the mere feeling of “hope” that they can do something 
about the trigger sound. Specifically, patients are asked to imagine 
themselves as completely powerless. This allows the individual to see 
what it looks like to be powerless in the face of the trigger, which is 
ultimately the ideal therapeutic position to be in since having “surren -
dered” one need no longer focus on the sound, thus termed “victorious 
surrender.” In addition to learning about choosing to let go of forms of 
behavior that give one the illusion of control, this exercise is also helpful 
for identifying all the different forms of avoidance. 
Another important element of this step is discussing the fact the view 
that others can technically stop making the triggering sounds, which can 
erroneously lead one to feel that there is hope in that possibility – a hope 
that can undermine willingness to let go of control strategies. This 
interpersonal nuance is very important to address and, indeed, may be 
one of the most challenging steps in the process of acceptance. To 
address this, it is important to shift the discussion away from the moral 
certitude regarding who is responsible for changing behavior (i.e., “who 
is right”) since this will likely lead to a futile discussion that will leave 
the patient defensive about rigidly held personal views. Importantly, it is 
useful to affirm the patient’s position that the sounds feel wrong. From 
the perspective of the misophonia sufferer, it feels like the world is 
perpetrating an ongoing injustice against him or her. The choice thus 
presents itself: trying to do something about the triggers (as informed by 
toxic hope and the control strategies) or stop doing something about and 
come to terms with the reality that he or she lives in a world where 
people could technically end the misery created by the sounds yet are 
unlikely to do so. Acceptance emerges as a natural consequence when the 
individual stops struggling against their reality despite that fact that it feels 
unjust. This is a choice that is available to the misophonia sufferer. In 
order to make this step easier for the patient, it is important for the 
therapist to be very validating of the difficult interpersonal feelings that 
arise in a situation where people—loved ones–continue create painful 
triggers despite many requests to stop. 
3.2. Reduction of avoidance 
Once the individual with misophonia is willing to stop trying to 
avoid the unwanted sounds, it is important to identify and address all the 
various forms of avoidance. We have identified three main categories of 
avoidance behaviors: physical avoidance, cognitive avoidance, and 
altering others’ behavior. 
Physical avoidance. This includes physically removing oneself from 
the vicinity of sounds, such as leaving the dinner table and eating alone 
(Schroder et al., 2013), reducing the audiological perception of the 
sound by wearing sound-cancelling headphones, and utilizing 
white-noise to wash-out sounds (Schroder et al., 2013). Further, some 
have reported mimicking the triggering sounds with the goal to “cancel” 
out the sound (Edelstein et al., 2013). 
Cognitive avoidance. This involves any attempt to utilize one’s 
cognitive capacities to reduce the perception of the sound. For example, 
attempting to shift the attention to a different sound or trying to ignore 
the sounds (Edelstein et al., 2013). Another form is trying to “reframe” the sounds as something other than it is to make it less aversive. For 
example, imagining the crunching sound as someone grinding rocks 
instead of eating. 
Avoidance by altering others’ behavior. This involves asking the 
individuals making the sounds to alter their behavior in an effort to 
reduce the sound, such as refraining from making the sound or having 
them leave the room (Edelstein et al., 2013). Others methods include 
non-verbal communication such as “glaring” at them. 
3.3. Stimulus engagement 
Once toxic hope and control strategies have been identified, the goal 
is to end utilization of avoidant strategies to allow for proactive 
engagement with the triggering stimuli, akin to exposures. This can be 
conducted in several way, both in and out of session. This will likely 
require creativity as each person with misophonia have their own 
unique triggers. In session the most accessible form of engagement with 
the stimulus through the imaginal medium. Other options include 
bringing “triggering” individuals into session and/or listening and 
watching to recordings of triggers. Additionally, a hierarchy may be 
used in planning these exercises as there are subjective differences be-
tween the levels of distress that triggers can elicit for each individual 
(Frank & McKay, 2019). 
It should be noted that one potential obstacle to the engagements is 
the anxiety of letting go of control of their unhelpful coping strategies 
due to a variety of worries or fears. For example, a patient may avoid 
engaging with the triggering sounds as they are afraid they will never 
enjoy life again (“if I allow others to make sounds I will always be 
miserable.“) Another concern might be related to a fear of losing control 
and acting out on an aggressive impulse (“if I just let the sound occur, I 
might hurt someone out of rage.“). Whatever the fear may be, we would 
recommend an acceptance-based approach involving acceptance of the 
unwanted outcome as possible (akin to ERP) as opposed to a cognitive 
restructuring approach (e.g., examining the evidence). The aim here is 
for a “wraparound” acceptance of all unwanted experiences and possible 
outcomes. 
3.4. Vignette: treatment with EASE 
We will now present a vignette of applying EASE utilizing the 
aforementioned vignette of Emily. 
Session 1. The first session was conducted with Emily and her 
mother. In addition to collecting standard intake information, the focus 
of this session was to collect data regarding Emily’s current forms of 
avoidance and coping. This information will be used towards elimi -
nating avoidance. 
Session 2. The second session focused on psychoeducation about the 
psychological model of misophonia and EASE. A particular emphasis 
was placed on the discussion of toxic hope, and used the “playing dead” 
metaphor to discuss the topic of letting go of control strategies and 
avoidance. Also practiced the “victorious surrender” exercise to help 
with making the experience of letting go more relatable and 
understandable. 
Homework: Collaboratively identify areas to start reducing physical 
avoidance and engaging in triggering situations for a longer period of 
time than usual without engaging in any form of control, including 
cognitive and behavioral strategies to avoid experience. Emily chose to 
join the family for dinner for 5 min every day. Also, she agreed to 
practice twice a day the “victorious surrender” exercise to get used the 
philosophy of the therapy. 
Session 3. The third session began with reviewing the week. Emily 
shared that she followed through on most days, but noted some days 
when she was stressed, it was “too much.” Emily shared that most days 
were “difficult” but “tolerable” and that at times she even stayed at the 
dinner table for longer than 5 min. Emily stated that she particularly 
struggled with triggers that occurred outside of mealtime because they E.N. Cowan et al.

Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders 32 (2022) 100691
8were “unexpected.” Based on this, Emily practiced engaging with the 
unexpected triggers utilizing an imaginal scene involving her sister 
slurping a drink behind her in the living room as she was reading a book 
and chose to not avoid the trigger, instead utilizing the “victorious 
surrender” approach to practice accepting the trigger. 
Homework: Practice engaging triggers imaginally 3 times a day for 
5 min. In collaboration with her therapist, Emily agreed to expand the 
time at dinner to 10 min every night and also to watch television with 
her family for 10 min each evening – all while not engaging in any 
avoidant strategies. 
Session 4–12. These sessions review homework and engage in 
troubleshooting for any issues that might arise. Each session includes 
exercises practicing engagement with triggers without resorting in any 
form of avoidance or toxic hope. 
Homework: After each session, homework assignments continued to 
emphasize practice of stimulus engagement, with Emily gradually 
increasing the amount of time spent in family situations without using 
avoidant strategies. 
3.5. Limitations and future research 
There are several limitations to the model and therapy formulations 
presented in this paper. Firstly, this paper is based on theory and has not 
yet been subject to empirical testing. Another limitation is that our 
model heavily relies on the research measuring personality traits and 
disorders, which generally have proven difficult to measure with reli-
ability. We believe that future research should examine efficacy of our 
proposed treatment called EASE. Specifically, we believe the following 
hypothesis should be examined: (1) EASE will lead to a significant 
reduction of symptoms of awareness of triggering sounds, (2) EASE will 
lead to decreased level of distress when sounds are heard, and (3) EASE 
will lead to increased levels of functioning. 
4.Conclusion 
Misophonia is a debilitating condition which has recently gained 
attention that, to our knowledge, lacks a comprehensive psychological 
model. To this end, this paper sought to develop one grounded in the 
current published research. Based on the consistent findings that a 
majority of individuals with misophonia report traits of rigidity, we 
developed an etiological model explaining its symptoms. This model 
suggested that traits of rigidity combined with classical conditioning, 
operant conditioning, and generalization, play a role in the development 
and maintenance of misophonic symptoms. Flowing from the model, we 
concluded with a proposed treatment, EASE, an acceptance-based pro-
tocol that consists of ending toxic hope, reducing avoidance, and stim-
ulus engagement.
