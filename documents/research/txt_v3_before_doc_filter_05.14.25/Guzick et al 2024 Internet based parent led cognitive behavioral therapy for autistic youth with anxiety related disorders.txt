This study tested two versions of parent-led, Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety among autistic  youth;  one  that  provided  weekly  email  support  (iCBT-Email),  and  one  that  provided  alternating  biweekly  emails  and  video  calls  (iCBT-Video)  across  12  weeks.  It  was  expected  that  those  in  the  iCBT-Video condition would complete more treatment content, which in turn would lead to more anxiety improvement. Fifty-seven autistic youth (7-15 years-old) with anxiety disorders were randomized to iCBT-Email or iCBT-Video. There  were  no  significant  differences  in  improvement  in  clinician-rated,  child-reported,  or  parent-reported anxiety severity or functional impairment. Posttreatment response rates were 55% in iCBT-Email and 67% in iCBT-Video.  Module  completion  predicted  improved  treatment  outcome,  though  there  was  no  difference  in module completion across groups. Therapists spent an average of 16.29 min/family/week ( SD = 7.11) in the iCBT-Email  condition  and  24.13  min/family/week  ( SD = 6.84)  in  the  iCBT-Video  condition.  Email  and telehealth-supported,  parent-led  iCBT  both  appear  to  be  effective  treatments  for  autistic  youth  with  anxiety disorders that require reduced therapist effort. Future research should seek novel methods to enhance engagement with iCBT content.

## 1. Introduction

Autism is a common neurodevelopmental difference characterized by social communication difficulties as well as repetitive and restrictive behaviors, with 1 in 36 children now estimated to be autistic (Maenner, 2020). Autistic youth often struggle with a number of mental health conditions, with anxiety-related disorders being among the most common in this population (Kirsch et al., 2020; van Steensel et al., 2011). Clinical  anxiety  confers  significant  functional  impairment  in  autistic youth  (Kerns  et  al.,  2015)  and  is  likely  to  worsen  as  youth  enter adolescence and adulthood (Gotham et al., 2015; Uljarevic et al., 2020). ´

An increasing recognition of the prevalence and impact of anxiety in this population has led to an acceleration of treatment research in the past  decade,  with  particular  interest  in  cognitive  behavioral  therapy (CBT) due to its strong evidence base for anxiety-related disorders in non-autistic  youth (Sharma et al., 2021; Wood et al., 2020). Several randomized trials have now demonstrated strong efficacy of CBT relative to comparison conditions for this population ( g = .88; Sharma et al., 2021). Although CBT as it was designed for non-autistic youth is efficacious, one randomized trial comparing traditional CBT to CBT adapted for autistic youth suggested modifications for autistic youth lead to incremental  benefits,  as  youth  in  the  adapted  condition  experienced

significantly improved outcomes in this study (Wood et al., 2020).

that should be considered in treatment development.

Regardless, there are tremendous barriers to accessing adapted CBT for this population, as it is time-intensive, costly, and rarely available in community settings (Reardon et al., 2020; Salloum et al., 2016). Further, there is a significant shortage of providers trained in CBT for children and adolescents (Frank et al., 2020). Although this problem is significant for all youth, these barriers are even more substantial among those on the autism spectrum, as there is often a disconnect between developmental services (where this population is often seen) and mental health services. Moreover, providers are often hesitant to provide therapy for autistic youth (Adams &amp; Young, 2021; Maddox et al., 2021). For these reasons, developing lower-cost, more scalable approaches for this population is of utmost importance.

Internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) has been proposed as a novel form of delivery that has the potential to increase access to CBT, reduce costs, and save therapist time, while maintaining efficacy (Andersson et al., 2019). These approaches generally involve automated educational and interactive material that youth and parents complete in their own time with minimal therapist contact, ranging from asynchronous messaging to occasional phone/telehealth contact to provide support as they work through a self-directed program. Self-directed programs for youth with anxiety disorders usually follow a parent-led approach, in which parents take on the role of a therapist and coach with support from a clinician. This format has been recommended as parents may be more likely to generalize concepts from CBT, help their child apply them in real time, and are often more motivated to engage in difficult behavior change related  to  child  anxiety  (Creswell  et  al.,  2022).  Several  studies  have shown non-inferiority of parent-led CBT relative to therapist-delivered individual  treatment  for  non-autistic  youth  with  anxiety  disorders (Creswell  et  al.,  2022;  Rapee  et  al.,  2017),  with  recent  research demonstrating similar treatment outcomes for autistic youth (Guzick et al., 2023). Leveraging digital health and parent coaching promises to be a lower cost method to scale CBT for autistic youth.

To date, there has been minimal research on digitally delivered CBT for autistic youth with anxiety-related disorders. One pilot study of an iCBT program for autistic youth with anxiety-related disorders compared two levels of therapist support. In this 12-week program, eight parent-youth dyads were randomized to receive either biweekly, 30-min video calls with a therapist in addition to weekly email support (iCBTVideo) or weekly email support only (iCBT-Email) (Guzick et al., 2023). All families participated in parent- and child-specific web-based modules between therapist contacts, with parents being encouraged to guide their  child  through  their  content.  Overall,  treatment  outcomes  were promising, with five of seven completers being classified as treatment responders and an overall symptom reduction of 39% on the Pediatric Anxiety  Rating  Scale  modified  for  Autism  (PARS-A;  Maddox  et  al., 2020), including a 55% reduction in iCBT-Video and a 22% reduction in iCBT-Email [blinded citation].

ICBT  for  non-autistic  youth  has  incorporated  different  levels  of professional support in the form of a therapist or ' coach, ' with greater involvement generally being associated with improved outcomes (Grist et al., 2019; Werntz et al., 2023). In addition to providing clarification on therapeutic concepts, more contact with a professional during digital mental  health  interventions  is  believed  to  confer  more ' supportive accountability, ' leading to greater engagement with therapeutic material and less dropout (Meyerhoff et al., 2021). Indeed, several studies show that more human support leads to more engagement in digital mental  health  interventions  (though  it  is  also  worth  noting  several non-significant findings in this literature as well; Lipschitz et al., 2023). In  parent-led  interventions,  greater  parental  participation  leads  to improved outcomes (Riddle et al., 2024). Thus, it may be that increased participation  in  therapeutic  content  is  a  mechanism  by  which  more therapist contact leads to improved treatment outcomes in parent-led digital  mental  health  interventions.  That  said,  there  are  diminishing returns of therapist involvement at a certain point when considering the balance of efficacy and scalability in digital mental health interventions

This study expanded on preliminary findings by testing two versions of  iCBT  for  autistic  youth  with  anxiety-related  disorders,  one  with weekly email contact (iCBT-Email), and one with alternating bi-weekly email contact and 30-min telehealth coaching calls (iCBT-Video). The primary aim was to test whether families in iCBT-Video would experience  improved  treatment  outcomes.  A  secondary  aim  was  to  test whether greater engagement with iCBT content in the iCBT-Video condition would be a mechanism accounting for improved treatment outcomes among families in this condition. It was expected that families randomized to iCBT-Video would engage with more iCBT content and thus experience improved treatment outcomes compared to families in the iCBT-Email condition. Other secondary exploratory aims were to compare satisfaction and dropout across the two treatment conditions. We also compared the amount of therapist time required in each condition, with more therapist time expected in iCBT-Video.

## 2. Methods

## 2.1. Participants

Participants were recruited from a variety of sources throughout the state  of  Texas  including  autism-focused  organizations,  mental  health and developmental clinics and professionals, research databases (e.g., SPARK,  ResearchMatch),  social  media  platforms  (e.g.,  Facebook), community  organizations  (e.g.,  advocacy  groups,  schools,  churches, youth  centers,  local  businesses,  non-profits),  and  word  of  mouth. Recruitment began in July 2022 and ended in March 2023.

Parents  interested  in  participating  first  completed  a  30-min  prescreening phone call with a member of the study team to determine their  child s  likely  eligibility  prior  to  scheduling  a  virtual  baseline ' assessment. Written and verbal consent/assent was obtained prior to beginning  the  baseline  assessment,  during  which  parent  and  child completed a series of interview-rated assessments and questionnaires with a trained independent evaluator to determine final eligibility. Independent  evaluators  were  trained  by  reviewing  assessments  with  a licensed psychologist experienced in the measures, rating mock assessments  to  ensure  reliability  with  the  team,  administering  an  initial assessment with the support of an experienced rater, and weekly supervisions with a supervising psychologist. Independent evaluators were blind to treatment condition.

Inclusion criteria required the following: (1) a child age of 7 -15 years at time of enrollment, (2) a prior diagnosis of autism according to goldstandard assessment procedures (e.g., Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule,  Second Edition [ADOS-2]; Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Second Edition [CARS-2]) verified by a written report and reviewed by a clinical psychologist on the study team, (3) a primary diagnosis of an anxiety  or  obsessive-compulsive  disorder  on  the  Mini  International Neuropsychiatric  Interview  for  Children  and  Adolescents  (MINI-KID; Sheehan et al., 2010), (4) a score of 70 or higher on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition (KBIT-2; Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 2004), (5)  child-demonstrated  ability  to  communicate  verbally  during  the assessment, (6) parent and child English fluency, (7) at least one parent or guardian willing to participate in assessments and treatment modules, (8) and full-time residency of both child and parent in the state of Texas during the trial period. Exclusion criteria included (1) the child had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, conduct disorder, or a psychotic disorder, (2) the child had current and severe suicidal/homicidal ideations, (3) the  child  was  currently  receiving  psychotherapy  for  anxiety  through another provider, or (4) the child had started or changed dosages of psychotropic medications within the four weeks prior to the baseline assessment.

## 2.2. Procedures

After completion of a virtual baseline assessment, eligible parent-

A.G. Guzick et al.

child dyads were randomized into one of two iCBT treatment conditions in a 1:1 allocation ratio: iCBT-Email or iCBT-Video. A research coordinator uninvolved with the study used the pseudorandom function in Microsoft Excel to assign blocks of 10 participants into iCBT-Email vs. -Video  condition.  After  each  eligible  participant  was  enrolled,  this research coordinator was notified and they were entered into the subsequent cell. This research coordinator informed another coordinator directly involved in the study, who in turn informed families of their group assignment. In both conditions, parents were sent two links each week to access the treatment modules corresponding to the week of the program they were on: one link containing parent-facing content and the other containing child-facing content. The child content had two versions that varied based on the child s age (one for 7-10 year-olds, one for ' 11-15  year-olds).  All  procedures  were  approved  by  the  local  Institutional Review Board. The study was pre-registered here: https://clinica ltrials.gov/study/NCT05284435.

Learning to Understand and Navigate Anxiety (LUNA). Participants in both treatment conditions followed the LUNA program across a 12-week  period  (Guzick  et  al.,  n.d.),  during  which  families  were encouraged to complete one treatment module per week. For this study, content was delivered using Qualtrics survey software ( Qualtrics , 2020), so therapists could monitor families ' responses and provide feedback. Therapists were postdoctoral fellows or doctoral students in psychology supervised by a licensed psychologist experienced with this population. Families were not given access to content for subsequent weeks until they completed their current module to avoid treatment burden and overload, though when families fell behind, they were given up to two modules  to  complete  in  one  week  if  they  expressed  an  interest  in completing additional content. The program began with three modules on psychoeducation (Modules 1 and 2), rewards (Module 2), and coping (Module 3), with the rest reviewing different facets of exposure therapy. Module 4 focused on exposure hierarchy development, Module 5 on doing exposure, Module 6 on testing expectancies through exposure, and Module 7 on safety behaviors and family accommodation. After these first  seven  core  modules,  parents  chose  between  five  additional  supplemental  modules  (working  on  multiple  exposure  goals  simultaneously;  social  coaching  during  social  anxiety  exposures;  modifying exposures for anxiety related to sensory sensitivity and insistence on sameness; exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic; managing oppositional behavior). Teens could access parallel modules for all these areas except for the parent coaching module on oppositional behavior, and children  could  access  the  multiple  exposure  goals  module.  A  final module provided a review of material and planning for the future.

iCBT-Email. Families  randomized  to  the  iCBT-Email  condition completed  weekly  LUNA  treatment  modules  one  at  a  time  while receiving  12  weekly  check-in  emails  from  their  therapist.  Therapists reviewed participant progress on the previous week s module prior to ' emailing the family to provide feedback on areas for improvement and techniques for implementing program content into their everyday lives. Emails  were  generally  brief  and  intended  to  be  no  more  than  a  few sentences providing encouragement, basic feedback on modules, and/or checking in on completion when content was not done on time. Templates were generated for each email which therapists personalized to each family.

iCBT-Video . Families  randomized  to  the  iCBT-Video  condition completed  weekly  LUNA  treatment  modules  one  at  a  time  while receiving both email and video support from their therapist, with six biweekly email check-ins alternating with six bi-weekly, 30-min telehealth coaching calls. Parents and youth attended these visits together. During video sessions, therapists provided additional support and strategies for implementing techniques learned throughout the program in addition to the written feedback provided via email during the weeks families were not scheduled to meet with their therapist. Content covered during video sessions  included  changes  in  functioning  since  the  previous  session, answering questions about the previous week s content, offering support ' and  encouragement,  troubleshooting  problems  with  the  program, identifying barriers to participation if the family was not keeping up with the modules, and providing feedback on CBT exercises conducted in the home. Consistency in therapy delivery was maintained through content checklists for each session that therapists followed as well as weekly supervision.

## 2.3. Measures

Clinical  assessments  were  administered  to  both  parent  and  child across three timepoints via secure videoconferencing: prior to treatment (Baseline), immediately after treatment (posttreatment), and one month after  treatment  ended  (1  Month  Follow-Up).  Assessments  included  a variety of clinician-rated measures and parent/child-reported measures and  were  conducted  by  postdoctoral  fellows  or  advanced  doctoral trainees trained as independent evaluators and supervised by a licensed psychologist.

MINI-KID: The  Mini  International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID; Sheehan et al., 2010) is a short, structured diagnostic interview used to assess DSM-5 disorders among youth and has shown strong psychometric properties across both clinical and general populations (Duncan et al., 2018; Sheehan et al., 2010). 18%  of  MINI-KIDs  were  re-rated  by  an  independent  rater,  finding agreement of κ = .80, indicating substantial agreement.

PARS-A: The Pediatric  Anxiety  Rating  Scale  modified  for  Autism (PARS-A;  Maddox  et  al.,  2020)  is  a  semi-structured  interview  that measures anxiety symptoms and severity in youth, which occurred over the  past  week.  It  includes  a  symptom  checklist  of  anxiety  symptoms across social anxiety, separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, specific phobia, and panic domains and five items assessing the severity of the following:  frequency,  distress,  avoidance,  impairment  at  home,  and impairment  outside  the  home.  The  PARS-A  was  modified  from  the original Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) to better assess anxiety in autistic  youth and shows strong test-retest reliability and convergent validity (Maddox et al., 2020). Consistent with our prior work, additional checklist items were  included  to  assess for symptoms  of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), in line with the study s concep-' tualization of OCD as an anxiety-related disorder. 18% of PARS-A were re-rated by independent raters, finding an interclass correlation of .87, indicating a strong degree of agreement.

CGI-I: The Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale (CGI-I) is a brief,  seven-item,  clinician-administered measure that assesses global improvement  in  clinical  symptoms  (Guy,  1976).  Clinicians  used  the CGI-I in the present study to rate participants ' improvement of anxiety symptoms  following  treatment  completion  and  treatment  efficacy overall. The measure has shown strong psychometrics properties and reliability across raters (Lewin et al., 2012).

CSDS: The Child Sheehan Disability Scale (C-SDS) is a brief self- and parent-reported measure used to determine degree of functional and anxiety-related  impairments  in  children  (Whiteside,  2009).  It  was originally adapted from the Sheehan Disability Scale and was administered as both a child- (C-SDS-C) and parent- (C-SDS-P) report to determine impairment across social, educational/occupational, and family domains. The CSDS  has shown  strong psychometric properties, including strong internal consistency and concurrent validity (Whiteside, 2009).

RCADS: The Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS; Chorpita et al., 2000) is a 47-item self-report, adapted from the Spence Children s Anxiety Scale (SCAS; Spence 1998), that measures anxiety ' and depressive symptoms among children and adolescents. The measure consists of both child (RCADS-C) and parent (RCADS-P) self-reports and has been shown to have strong psychometric properties (Chorpita et al., 2005). The anxiety subscale was reported in this study.

CSQ-8: The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) is a brief, eight-item self-report measure administered to assess client satisfaction with treatment services. It has shown high internal consistency (Attkisson &amp; Zwick,  1982;  Nguyen  el  al.,  1983)  and  was  delivered  as  a

parent-reported measure in this study.

## 2.4. Statistical analysis

Data conformed to normal distribution assumptions. 16 -19% of data were missing on primary and secondary outcomes; when missingness was assessed using Little s test, we failed to reject the null hypothesis ' that data were missing completely at random, X 2 (11) = 7.90, p = .72. Multiple  imputation  was  used  to  estimate  missing  data,  with  the following inputs to generate imputed models: baseline demographics (child age, sex), baseline symptoms scores on all primary and secondary outcomes, and baseline diagnoses.

(70%), and non-Hispanic (72%). The most common diagnoses included social anxiety disorder (67%), generalized anxiety disorder (58%), and specific phobia (53%). Please see Table 1 for a full demographic summary and Fig. 1 for the CONSORT diagram describing participant flow. Enrollment occurred from August 1, 2022, to March 29, 2023, with the final follow-up assessment being completed in August 2023. Enrollment ended once  the  target  sample  size  was  reached.  Adverse  events  and harms were monitored using the definition adopted by the local institutional review board ( An undesirable and unintended, although not ' necessarily unexpected, result arising during the course of a research protocol ). No adverse events or harms were reported during the trial. '

Primary outcomes included differences in rate of change in PARS-A scores across the treatment period and one-month follow-up. Sample size was determined to detect an effect size difference of f = .39 based on the pilot trial (Guzick et al., 2023), assuming power = .90, alpha = .05, and a correlation coefficient across timepoints of r = .47 (also based on data from prior work). Based on these assumptions, 27 were expected to be  needed  in  each  group  to  yield  a  significant  difference  favoring iCBT-Video.

Multilevel random effects models were conducted to determine differences in rate of change in PARS-A scores, with visits (Baseline, PostTreatment, 1 Month Follow-Up) nested within participants. Analyses were conducted in in SPSS v29 (IBM Corp, 2022). The following independent variables were added in sequential models predicting PARS-A scores:  1)  age  (child  vs.  teen),  2)  linear  time,  3)  quadratic  time  (to evaluate if the rate of change slowed between post-treatment and the one-month  follow-up  period),  4)  treatment  group  (iCBT-Video  vs. iCBT-Email), and 5) the interaction between linear time and treatment group. The magnitude of fixed effects were estimated using a marginal Pseudo R2 (Nakagawa et al., 2017). Analyses were repeated for secondary outcomes, including RCADS-P, RCADS-C, CSDS-P, and CSDS-C.

Rates of treatment response (a CGI-I score of  much ' ' or  very much ' ' improved), primary anxiety diagnosis remission, and remission of all anxiety diagnoses were compared using chi-square analyses. Completeronly  and  intent-to-treat  are  both  presented,  with  missing  data  being estimated across five imputed datasets.

Participant  engagement  was  defined  as  the  number  of  modules completed. Time spent per module was also presented. Differences in engagement were investigated by comparing the number of modules completed in iCBT-Email vs. iCBT-Video with a  -test. Association bet tween module completion and treatment outcome was conducted by including the number of modules completed as well as the interaction between number of modules completed and time as additional independent variables in the multilevel models. 1 Assuming significant differences between groups in treatment outcomes, as well as a significant association  between  module  completion  and  treatment  outcomes,  a mediated regression was planned to investigate whether the effect of group on post-treatment PARS, RCADS-P, and RCADS-C was mediated by the number of modules completed

## 3. Results

## 3.1. Participant characteristics

The majority of youth in this study identified as boys (72%), White

1 Number of parental modules completed was chosen as an index of overall engagement  as  opposed  to  an  aggregate  of  child  and  parental  modules completed because 1) LUNA was designed as a parent-led treatment, 2) number of parental modules completed and child modules completed were extremely highly correlated, r = .97, and 3) there were different numbers of child (9) and teen (12) modules, and thus aggregating child/teen modules would introduce variability related to the intervention design rather than an index of engagement.

3.2. Improvement in anxiety and impairment in iCBT-Email vs. iCBTVideo

Clinician-rated anxiety severity measured by the PARS-A showed a significant negative linear effect, B = 3.74, p = .007 Δ R 2 = .33, suggesting a decline in PARS-A across the trial (see Fig. 2). There was no time X iCBT condition effect, B = 0.19, p = .64. Age (adolescent vs. child modules  completed)  was  not  a  significant  predictor.  This  pattern  of findings  was  replicated  when  examining  the  RCADS-P  (parent-rated anxiety), RCADS-C (child-rated anxiety), CSDS-P (parent-rated

functional  impairment),  and  CSDS-C  (child-rated  functional  impairment). The only distinction in these models was that time showed a significant negative linear effect for each dependent variable in models without other covariates included, Δ R 2 s = .070 - .137, though when other variables were also included in the model, they no longer showed statistical significance See Table 2 for model coefficients and effect sizes; see Table 3 for a summary of population-predicted M s and SE s.

## 3.3. Response and remission in iCBT-Email vs. iCBT-Video

There  were  no  significant  differences  in  treatment  response  or remission at post-treatment or one-month follow-up. At posttreatment, 67% of completers in iCBT-Video and 55% of completers in iCBT-Email were classified as responders. In iCBT-Video, 33% remitted from their primary anxiety disorder and 21% remitted from all anxiety diagnoses. Comparatively, in iCBT-Email, 46% of completers remitted from their primary anxiety diagnosis and 32% remitted from all anxiety diagnoses. At one-month follow-up, 75% of completers in iCBT-Video and 60% of completers in iCBT-Email were classified as responders. 55% of participants in each condition remitted from their primary anxiety disorder diagnosis at one-month follow-up, with 20% of iCBT-Video participants remitting from all anxiety diagnoses and 35% in iCBT-Email. See Table 4 for  a  summary of clinical significance data with both completer and intent-to-treat samples.

There was no significant difference between the number of parent modules completed in the iCBT-Video condition, M (SD) = 6.68 (3.30), and the iCBT-Email condition, M (SD) = 5.21 (3.70), t (55) = 1.34, p = .12, d = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; .42. There was similarly no difference between number of child modules completed in the iCBT-Video condition, M (SD) = 6.32 (3.17), and the iCBT-Email condition, M (SD) = 5.10 (3.66), t (55) = 1.58, p = .19, d = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; .36.

Number of modules completed, as well as the interaction between number of modules completed and time, were added as additional independent  variables  in  models  predicting  treatment  outcome  on  the PARS-A, RCADS-P, and RCADS-C. The interaction between number of modules  completed  and  time  was  a  significant  predictor  of  PARS-A scores, B = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; .13, p = .007, RCADS-P scores, B = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; .33, p = .024, suggesting that completing more modules corresponded with more change across the trial. It was not a significant predictor of RCADS-C, however, B = .070, p = .72. See Table 5 for a summary of these effects.

## 3.5. Dropout and satisfaction

Eight families dropped out of the iCBT-Email condition, compared with five families in the iCBT-Video condition, X 2 (1) = 0.77, p = .38. Ratings on client satisfaction indicated no differences across groups on the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, t (31) = 1.38, d = .48, p = .18.

## 3.6. Therapist time

In the iCBT-Email condition, therapists spent an average of 16.29 min of therapist time per week ( SD = 7.11) per family, compared to 24.13 min ( SD = 6.84) in the iCBT-Video condition, t (41) = 3.68, d = 1.12, p &lt; .001. Therapists in iCBT-Email spent an average of 6.70 min per  week  ( SD = 3.45)  reviewing  content,  and  9.59  min  per  week providing  email  feedback  ( SD = 3.96).  These  numbers  were  similar among  iCBT-Video  therapists  with  time  reviewing, M  (SD) = 6.30 (4.21), and average email feedback time, M (SD) = 7.88 (4.64), though they also had video sessions every other week, which were an average of 27.77 min ( SD = 3.58).

## 4. Discussion

This study tested two formats of parent-led, Internet-delivered CBT for autistic youth with anxiety-related disorders, one involving weekly email check-ins (iCBT-Email) and one that also included biweekly telehealth coaching calls (iCBT-Video). There were no significant differences  in  treatment  outcomes  across  groups  in  evaluator-,  child-,  or parent-rated  anxiety,  child-  and  parent-reported  functional  impairment, drop-out, or satisfaction with services. The majority of youth in both  iCBT-Email  and  iCBT-Video  experienced  clinically  significant change, with 55% and 67% being classified as treatment responders at the  posttreatment  assessment,  respectively.  Primary  anxiety  disorder remission rates at posttreatment were 46% in iCBT-Email and 33% in iCBT-Video,  which  increased  to  55%  in  both  conditions  at  1-month follow-up.  All-anxiety  disorder  remission  rates  were  38%  in  iCBTEmail and 25% in iCBT-Video (inclusive of OCD). These response and remission rates are generally comparable to those reported in traditionally-delivered CBT for anxiety among autistic youth (Warwick et  al.,  2017),  and  in  digital  CBT  for  non-autistic  youth  with  anxiety disorders (Cervin &amp; Lundgren, 2022).

These comparable improvements across conditions were observed while using less therapist time in iCBT-Email, with 16 min/week/family in this condition compared with 24 min/week/family in iCBT-Video. Although this reflected a significant and large difference in statistical terms,  its  practical  significance  (i.e.,  8  min/therapist/week)  is  less compelling. Both conditions require far less therapist time relative to traditional  psychotherapy  (i.e.,  45 -60 min weekly sessions),  and are

both in the range of therapist time that has been reported in other digital CBT programs (Werntz et al., 2023). Given the minimal difference across formats, they might both be considered as viable options depending on family  preferences  and  the  systems  in  which  they  are  delivered.  For example, iCBT-Video might be more easily implemented in the United States,  where  this  trial  was  conducted.  In  this  context,  there  is  an existing payment  mechanism  for 30-min psychotherapy sessions through a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, whereas there is not a mechanism to pay therapists to write supportive feedback emails. It is also possible that if therapy time is used on more therapeutically potent  components  in  future  iterations  (e.g.,  delivering  in-session exposure to supplement self-guided practice at home), this may also boost the impact of therapist visits.

Hypotheses regarding the role of content completion were partially supported. Content completion was a significant predictor of IE-rated and  parent-reported  anxiety  improvement,  though  participants  in iCBT-Video did  not complete  a  significantly  higher  number  of  iCBT modules as expected. It appeared that the weekly therapist check-ins in the  iCBT-Email  condition  were  sufficient  to  support  some  degree  of engagement  with  the  material,  with  minimal  incremental  benefits coming  from  biweekly  telehealth  coaching  calls.  Overall,  content completion was less than optimal and highly variable from participant-

to-participant, with an average of just about half of all possible modules completed  during  the  12-week  treatment  period.  Thus,  rather  than families in iCBT-Email completing more than an expected number of modules, it appears the biweekly telehealth calls with a therapist for families in the iCBT-Video condition did not engender a sufficient degree of  supportive  accountability.  Given  the  association  between  content completion and improvement in anxiety, future work should continue to consider novel ways to enhance engagement with CBT in self-directed interventions  beyond  these  telehealth  calls  (e.g.,  gamification  for youth; parental social support embedded in the application; or just-inadaptive-interventions  to  support  parents  leading  the  program  between therapist visits). It is also worth noting non-significant associations  between  content  completion  and  youth  self-reported  anxiety improvement. Although parent- and independent evaluator-rated outcomes are generally favored in interpretation in this population, the lack of  an  association  between  engagement  and  child-reported  treatment outcome may suggest that children s self-reported experience of anxiety ' was less impacted by the degree of participation in the program. Other child-specific  factors  or  treatment  processes  may  prove  to  be  better predictors  of  child  self-reported  outcomes  (e.g.,  intrinsic  motivation, insight, development of self-efficacy).

Several study limitations should be noted. First, the lack of a nonCBT or no-human-involvement control group precludes definitive conclusions about efficacy or the degree of human contact that is required to support participation in CBT content. Second, this trial was conducted in a highly controlled setting where participants were monitored regularly, in consistent communication with study staff, and primarily from higher socioeconomic backgrounds; it is less clear how these findings might generalize to real-world, community-based settings that serve families from more multiculturally diverse backgrounds. No fidelity assessments were  conducted  for  the  intervention,  an  important  limitation  of  our study  and  the  digital  interventions  field  more  broadly.  Further,  this study was powered to test efficacy of iCBT-Video vs. iCBT-Email using a small pilot trial that likely overestimated the magnitude of differences between the two conditions. Given the relatively small sample size, it was likely not powered to detect mechanisms, an important area for future work. The sample size also limited our ability to find significant differences  in  moderately-sized effects  (e.g.,  in  the  client  satisfaction questionnaire analysis). This study was also limited by a relatively shortterm follow-up period.

This  study adds to the growing literature on parent-led, Internetdelivered CBT for autistic youth with anxiety disorders, finding response and remission rates comparable to those often reported in traditional CBT  trials  for  autistic  youth  (Warwick  et  al.,  2017).  Leveraging  the growing presence of technology in the mental health landscape is a clear way to support parents as they take on a CBT coach role. Future work should  seek  novel  ways  to  foster  engagement  with  self-directed interventions to produce improved outcomes, assessing the impact of human contact (or lack thereof) on treatment outcomes in self-directed, digital interventions, identify mechanisms of change, and methods to implement this model of therapy on a larger scale.
