Misophonia is a sensory disorder where specific stimuli, usually auditory, trigger the 
fight -flight -freeze response, causing extreme reactions , typically anger, panic, or anxiety. 
Research into treatment for misophonia is limited, primarily consisting of case studies applying 
common methods of therapy. However, research into similar disorders like tinnitus shows  that 
there are many avenues of treatment that should be investigated, including audiological 
treatment. To apply audiological treatment to misophonia, selective noise cancelling must be 
used to control specific trigger sounds. In this research, a basic selective noise can celling 
algorithm was developed using a convolutional neural network and was evaluated  using a 
survey. Participants rated their reaction to trigger sounds, non -trigger sounds, and trigger sounds 
that had been selectively cancelled. The misophonic reactions to selectively cancelled sounds 
were significantly less than to trigger sounds. This shows that selective noise cancelling could be 
used to apply audiological treatments to misophonia.

1 CHAPTER I  
COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW OF TREATMENTS AVAILABILE  
FOR MISOPHONIA  
1.1 Introduction  
Misophonia is a disorder that has generally been characterized by decreased tolerance and 
extreme reactions to specific stimuli, normally specific sounds or their associated stimuli  (Brout 
et al., 2018; Cavanna & Seri, 2015; Edelstein et al., 2013; Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; 
M. M. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2002; Potgieter et al., 2019; Yilmaz & Hocaoglu, 2021) . The most 
common reported “trigger sounds” that cause these reactions  include eating -related sounds such 
as chewing and crunching, repetitive sounds such as clicking, picking, and tapping, and other 
mouth and nose sounds like breathing, sniffing and coughing, drinking, and swallowing 
(Cecilione et al., 2022; Dover & McGuire, 2021; T. H. Dozier, 2015c; Karalis et al., 2022; 
Rosenthal et al., 2021; Schneider & Arch, 2017) . In addition to auditory triggers, those with 
misophonia can also experience similar reactions to visual stimuli – jaw movement, repetitive 
motions, leg swinging, and hair twirling  – that may or may not be related to auditory triggers 
(Cavanna & Seri, 2015; Edelstein et al., 2013; A. Schröder et al., 2013) . The reactions to these 
triggers can range from disgust to rage to loss of control to severe anxiety and  are generally 
directed toward the source of the trigger. In 2022, Swedo et al.  employed the Delphi method to 
develop an official consensus definition for misophonia.

2 “Misophonia is a disorder of decreased tolerance to specific sounds or stimuli… that tend 
to evoke strong negative emotional, physiological, and behavioral responses that are not seen in 
most other people. Misophonic responses do not seem to be elicited  by the loudness of auditory 
stimuli, but rather by the specific pattern or meaning to an individual... who may have difficulty 
distracting themselves from the stimulus and may experience suffering, distress, and/or 
impairment in social, occupational, and academic functioning.” (Swedo et al., 2022b)  
Misophonia is often discussed in conjunction with similar auditory -based disorders like 
tinnitus and hyperacusis under the umbrella of decreased sound tolerance (Aazh et al., 2019; 
Henry et al., 2022; M. M. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2002; P. J. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014; P. 
Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2015; Meltzer & Herzfeld, 2014; Raj -Koziak et al., 2021) . Chronic 
tinnitus is often defined as an auditory perception that has no physical acoustic source, leading to 
physiological problems such as discomfort, anxiety, or stress (Bhatt et al., 2017; Czornik et al., 
2022; Stobik et al., 2005) . Hyperacusis can be defined as the perception of everyday sounds as 
unusually or overwhelmingly loud or intense (Auerbach et al., 2014; Baguley, 2003) , also 
defined as unusually high auditory gain (Henry, 2022) . These disorders are different, but they 
share many  similar characteristics, such as an abnormal sensitivity to auditory stimuli, unusual 
and extreme reactions to auditory stimuli, and drastic impact of the lives of people with these 
disorders.  
Treatments for these other auditory disorders are well researched and draw tools from a 
variety of fields , including psychology , audiology , engineering , and  physiology. Traditional 
therapies like cognitive behavioral  therapy (CBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), 
and tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) have been successfully used  to reduce long term disability 
of both hyperacusis and tinnitus (Czornik et al., 2022; Fackrell et al., 2017; Henry, 2022; Holmes

3 & Padgham, 2011; Kalle et al., 2018; Zachriat & Kröner -Herwig, 2004) . Clinicians and 
researchers have used auditory methods like hearing aids and sound masking with noise 
generators to reduce the short -term affect of these conditions and aid in long -term treatment 
plans (Fackrell et al., 2017; Henry, 2022; Holmes & Padgham, 2011; Kalle et al., 2018; 
Searchfield et al., 2017) . Some investigation has also been made into pharmacological treatments 
(Czornik et al., 2022; Fackrell et al., 2017; Holmes & Padgham, 2011) , surgery (Czornik et al., 
2022; Fackrell et al., 2017; Searchfield et al., 2017) , and alternative medicine such as  
acupuncture and ginkgo biloba (Holmes & Padgham, 2011) . Researchers have demonstrated  
effectiveness when  using multimodal approaches to treating disorders like hyperacusis and 
tinnitus , such as combining elements of CBT and more sound based therapies  (Baguley & Hoare, 
2018; F Cima et al., 2012; Nolan et al., 2020) . More comprehensive reviews of the available and 
researched treatments for these disorders are available.  
Research into misophonia is relatively new and the condition itself has not been officially 
classified as a psychological disorder (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; M. M. Jastreboff & 
Jastreboff, 2002; Yilmaz & Hocaoglu, 2021) . Research into treatments is experimental, focused 
primarily on a few select  types of treatment, and generally tested in small samples or single case 
studies. The goal of this review  is two-fold: first, to comprehensively determine the current state 
of research into treatments for misophonia ; and second,  to identify areas of future research into 
treatments for misophonia.  
1.1.1 Contributions  
• First comprehensive literature review focusing specifically on the researched 
treatments of misophonia  
• Identified lack of standardized model for understanding mechanics of misophonia

4 • Identified need for randomized clinical trials to validate more methods of 
treatment than just CBT  
• Identified need for more research into technological and alternative treatments for 
misophonia, building on the foundation of tinnitus research  
1.2 Methods  
The literature review was conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 statement guidelines 
for systematic reviews (Page et al., 2021) . Two previous literature reviews of misophonia were 
used as guides in this process . The 2018 review by  Potgieter et al.  served as an example of the 
process . The 2022 review by  Ferrer -Torres and Gim énez-Llort , as the most recent ly published 
review on misophonia literature at the time, served as both an outline for the categorization of 
treatments and as a sanity check to ensure that the literature review was of sufficient scope. 
Eligibility criteria were established, the databases  and search strategy for each source was 
defined, and the selection and collection processes were conducted  according to the defined 
criteria. Finally, the information was collected and aggregated into categories based on treatment 
types.  
1.2.1 Eligibility Criteria  
Records were immediately excluded if they were not peer -reviewed, not in English, or 
did not make any mention of misophonia. After the initial exclusion, records were included in 
the final study if they mentioned a treatment for misophonia or mentioned tec hnology in relation 
to misophonia. Literature reviews were included.  
1.2.2 Sources and Searches  
Searches includ ed records up to December 2022 and were conducted using two 
databases: the EBSCO Discovery Service and PubMed. The same search terms were used for

5 both databases and each search was filtered to only include records published after the year 2000.  
This year was chosen because 2001 is generally accepted as the  year that the term misophonia 
was coined  (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Yilmaz & Hocaoglu, 2021) . Table 1.1  
summarizes the searches performed.  
Table 1.1  Searches performed for literature review.  
Database  Search Terms  Filters  Dates Searched  
EBSCO  misophonia AND treatment  2000 < YEAR < 2022  9/22, 12/22  
PubMed  misophonia AND treatment  2000 < YEAR < 2022  1/23 
 
1.2.3 Selection Proces s 
The initial search was conducted by one researcher who utilized  the exclusion criteria. 
Records were tracked using an Excel spreadsheet  that collected  basic information such as title, 
primary author, inclusion status, and some basic notes on content. After the initial search, the 
inclusion criteria were applied by one researcher and then validated by another researcher.  
1.2.4 Data Collection Process  
Two researchers reviewed the included records  independently. Each researcher used an 
Excel sheet to track the title, author, year, and treatment type(s) of each record. The reviewers 
also captured a summary of the treatment(s) described in the record, the outcomes and 
effectiveness of the treatment(s ), notes on particularly interesting sections or sentences, and any 
mention of technology in relation to the treatment of misophonia. After the individual review, the 
researchers discussed their conclusions and found that a consensus  existed on the data extracted 
from the records. The records were then grouped into treatment categories, using the review by  
Ferrer -Torres and Giménez -Llort  as a starting point for the categorization process .

6 1.3 Results  
1.3.1 PRISMA  
 
Figure 1.1  PRISMA tracking of report collection for literature review.  
 
One paper by M. M. Jastreboff & Jastreboff (2017)  was found that seemed to meet the 
inclusion criteria but  was deemed by the reviewers to contain similar  information to another by 
the same authors , so it was excluded from the results. Another paper  contained the appropriate 
keywords  and mentioned misophonia and technology but  was primarily focused on an AI -based 
decision system for auditory disorders and was deemed to be irrelevant for the current review 
(Tarnowska et al., n.d.) .

9 1.4 Discussion  
The literature reviews provided context for each of the different treatments and verified 
that the authors did not overlook  any critical papers regarding treatment alternatives for 
misophonia (Cavanna & Seri, 2015; Claiborn et al., 2020; Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; 
Meltzer & Herzfeld, 2014; Potgieter et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2022; Yilmaz & Hocaoglu, 2021) . 
Most of the literature reviews focused their attention on the etiology and proposed models for the 
onset and functioning of misophonia (Cavanna & Seri, 2015; Claiborn et al., 2020; Ferrer -Torres 
& Giménez -Llort, 2022; Potgieter et al., 2019; Yilmaz & Hocaoglu, 2021) . Meltzer and Herzfeld 
(2014) developed a toolbox of potential  treatments designed specifically for audiologists; this 
toolbox focused on tinnitus but could be applied to hyperacusis and misophonia. Most 
importantly, Smith et al. (2022) investigated the perception of individuals with misophonia 
towards various treatm ents, including medication, lifestyle modifications, relaxation techniques, 
psychological treatment, audiologic treatments, and neuromodulation. Smith’s study  provided a 
framework for understand ing what the current categories of treatment were for this current 
research .  
1.4.1 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is one of the most studied behavior therapies to 
date. CBT focuses on negative mental patterns that lead to emotional distress and undesired 
behaviors (Hofmann et al., 2012) . CBT is also the most researched treatment for Misophonia and 
the only treatment to have clinical trials performed. In general, the case studies and trials using 
CBT have proven effective in reducing misophonic symptoms (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 
2022; Potgieter et al., 2019; Yilmaz & Hocaoglu, 2021)  and papers discussing possible

10 treatments often primarily focus on CBT (Aazh et al., 2019; Bruxner, 2016; Henry et al., 2022; 
Karalis et al., 2022) . 
Some of the first instances of CBT in Misophonia treatment were early case studies 
(Altinöz et al., 2018; Bernstein et al., 2013; Cecilione et al., 2022; Dover & McGuire, 2021; I. 
Jager et al., 2022; Lewin et al., 2021; McGuire et al., 2015; Muller et al., 2018; Reid et al., 
2016) . In each of these case studies, a patient visited a clinician with misophonic symptoms, 
sometimes comorbid with OCD -like symptoms or other disorders. The authors conducted a 
series of CBT sessions with the patient, focusing on the mindset behind the react ions to triggers 
and the cognitive processes that were related to the negative emotions. In a few cases, the authors 
also attempted exposure and response prevention (ERP), which only showed success in 
combination with CBT treatment (Cecilione et al., 2022; Dover & McGuire, 2021; Reid et al., 
2016; Roushani & Mehrabizadeh Honarmand, 2021) . Specifically worth noting is a comment 
made by Cecilione et al. : exposures must be performed in combination with the correct 
atmosphere, support, and relaxation and mental processes to be effective. In each case study, the 
authors measured the severity of the patient’s Misophonia, normally using AMISOS  and 
complementary scales . From the measurements, they  saw a decrease in the severity of 
Misophonia, ranging from somewhat improved to almost complete reduction. At the end of each 
case study, as is common, the authors noted the necessity for more controlled trials to validate 
the effectiveness of this treatm ent. I. Jager et al. (2022)  do describe a treatment protocol for 
group CBT to treat  Misophonia. However, they were only able to test the protocol on a single 
individual, with results similar to the other case studies. Lewin et al. (2021)  also give an outline 
for potential  treatment protocols, with some success in phase 1 pilot trials.

11 In addition to the case studies, three trials were found that used CBT to treat misophonia. 
In 2017, A. E. Schröder et al. (2017)  published the first true study of CBT treatment for patients 
with misophonia, pulling from patients referred to the University of Amsterdam’s Academic 
Medical Center (AMC). While the study had some limitations and was not a randomized 
controlled trial (RC T), it still showed that CBT was effective in treating the symptoms of 
misophonia for around half of the patients. In 2021, the AMC published the first RCT using CBT 
to treat misophonia. Using a highly controlled treatment protocol, a control group on a tr eatment 
waiting list, and multiple measures including a 1 -year follow -up, the authors showed a clinical 
improvement in almost three quarters of the treated patients. Also in 2021, Roushani & 
Mehrabizadeh Honarmand (2021)  used CBT on three randomly selected female students at 
Shahid Chamran University in Iran. The authors specifically focused on the effect of treatment 
on anger as a symptom . The study showed substantial improvement  in two students and small 
improvement in a third student using the Novaco Anger Scale. To varying degrees, these three 
trials confirm the conclusions of the published case studies ; CBT is helpful in reducing the 
impacts of misophonia.  
1.4.2 Acceptance and Commitment Therapy  
Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is part of the third wave of behavior therapy 
treatments and  focuses  more on the individual’s relationship to psychological events while 
applying an understanding of the mechanics of the events and their context (Hayes et al., 2006) . 
ACT targets six core processes to allow the individual to build a healthier  relationship with 
themselves and their circumstances: acceptance, cognitive defusion, contact with the present, self 
as context, values, and committed action (a more detailed description of ACT can be found in

12 Hayes et al. (2006) ). Two reports found in the literature review discussed case studies using ACT 
in patient treatment.  
Petersen and Twohig (2022)  applied ACT with principles from dialectical behavior 
therapy (DBT) to the treatment of the misophonia of a 12 -year-old female (pseudonym “Kelly” 
in the report). In the treatment, Kelly attended sixteen  weekly, 50 -minute sessions, each focusing 
on aspects of her experience and introducing ACT principles to be applied in her daily life. The 
first sessions focused on basic education and mindfulness; the treatment then moved to engaging 
in more understandin g with the condition and separating  Kelly from her mi sophonia without 
suppressing or denying it; the final sessions introduced specific activities to engage with herself 
and others with compassion and empathy. The authors used the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale 
(AMISOS) (A. Schröder et al., 2013)  to provide a baseline score for Kelly’s misophonia and 
measure improvement over time. Kelly’s AMISOS scores decreased  over the treatment period. 
This, along with testaments from the patient and her mother, suggests  that ACT was successful 
in reducing the symptoms of misophonia and increasing the ability to tolerate the condition. This 
study was the first use of ACT to treat  misophonia in a child and therefore while it is useful in 
showing the value of ACT in a case study, it does not provide a systematic or controlled 
experiment for this treatment. The authors also note that controlled exposure was not used but  
could have shown positive results. In addition, they suggest that while earplugs or headphones 
can have har mful audiological effects and lead to avoidance  behavior , they can also be useful in 
specific situations. Finally, the authors stress that research concerning treatment and diagnosis of 
misophonia is limited and so any treatment must be presented with full transparency.  
Schneider and Arch (2017)  used ACT to treat a 17 -year-old male, pseudonym “Michael”. 
In the treatment, Michael attended 10 50 -minute sessions following a similar procedure as the

13 previous study, including basic mindfulness and education, internal connection and sympathy, 
and engagement with his surroundings. The authors again used the AMISOS scale, and 
Michael’s responses show a decrease over the sessions and into the 6 -month follo w-up. It is 
worth nothing that Michael reported subthreshold symptoms of obsessive -compulsive  disorder 
(OCD), which shares with misophonia unwanted thoughts and compulsive behaviors and is a 
common candidate for ACT use. The authors specifically state that  because misophonia is not 
well studied they did not apply a strict curriculum for ACT or DBT but  pulled principles from 
both treatments based on the situation. The authors also experimented with physical relaxation in 
response to triggers, which has been studied in multiple case reports (T. Dozier, 2022; T. H. 
Dozier, 2015b, 2015c) .  
Both these case studies provide evidence for the effectiveness of ACT and DBT in the 
treatment of misophonia. The focus on accepting situations, separating from the symptoms 
without suppressing them, and more active engagement with the symptoms and situati ons gave 
the patients tools to actively address their misophonia and triggering situations instead of 
defaulting to the inflexible routine of anger or anxiety in response to trigger sounds. A larger, 
controlled, and systematic study is needed to validate t he effectiveness of ACT in treating 
misophonia. Schneider and Arch  (2015 ) suggest that because misophonia involves emotional 
responses that are harder to habituate through exposure, these methods of acceptance and 
engagement with misophonia may be particularly effective.  
1.4.3 Counterconditioning and Neural Repatterning Technique  
The counterconditioning technique, often also referred to as the neural repatterning 
technique (NRT) by papers, is built on the five -phase model of Misophonia developed by Dozier 
and Mitchell (2022) . The five -phase model theorizes that Misophonia contains a Pavlovian -

14 conditioned physical reflex response to triggers, which then causes the intense emotional 
reactions characteristic of Misophonia (T. H. Dozier, 2015b) . There are other phases to this 
model of Misophonia, but the physical reflex is the primary concern of the counterconditioning 
treatment.  
In Dozier’s method of counterconditioning, the patient is exposed to a mild form of a 
known trigger , which will cause the physical reflex. At the same time, the patient is exposed to a 
counterconditioning stimulus, often music, which  should elicit a positive response. This 
combination allows the patient to focus on relaxing their physical reflex without experiencing  the 
emotional response to the trigger. Over time, the physical reflex can be controlled and reduced, 
which reduces the emotional response and t he rest of the phases in the five -phase model. (T. H. 
Dozier, 2015b) .  
Dozier’s first paper on this counterconditioning technique (T. H. Dozier, 2015b)  contains 
short descriptions of case studies supporting his theory. There are also three published case 
studies showing the results of the counterconditioning technique on specific patients.  
The first case study was performed in 2015 on a 21-year-old female (pseudonym Miley) 
(T. H. Dozier, 2015c) . At the time of the study, no clinically validated assessments had been 
developed for Misophonia, so the author used multiple available assessments: the Misophonia 
Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ) and the Misophonia Coping Responses surveys developed by 
audiologist Marsha Johnson, the Misophonia Physical Sensation scale and Misophonia Trigger 
Severity scale developed by audiologist Natan Bauman, and the Misophonia Activation Scale 
from misophonia -UK.org and the Misophonia Emotional Response survey from the a uthor. At 
the beginning of the study, Miley reported her symptoms as extreme and scored high on the 
assessments used. Over the course of approximately  a month, Miley used progressive muscle

15 relaxation (PMR) techniques twice a day and NRT treatments between 3 to 6 times a week. 
Miley’s score on the MAQ before and after treatment shows  significant decline in the severity of 
her reactions to the triggers that had been treated using NRT. Follow -ups 6 and 12 months after 
treatment showed that her response to the treated triggers remained low, but the response to non-
treated triggers remained or grew stronger. The author notes that the NRT treatment did not 
eliminate the trigger response, but merely  lessened it; he therefore suggests that NRT could be 
used in conjunction with other therapies like CBT to better treat a patient. In the discussion 
section, the author mentions another patient who used white noise and open ear headphones to 
reduce her responses to triggers based on  the MAQ , showing the same results with simple white 
noise that the complex counterconditioning treatment showed . This reinforces that while the 
treatment in this case worked, the measurements used are not validated.  
The second case study in 2015 focused on a 48-year-old female ( pseudonym  Sarah), 
whose most extreme triggers were caused by her husband. Again, the self -reported MAQ was the 
primary assessment tool to measure success of treatment. Over the course of 18 weeks, fourteen  
virtual counterconditioning sessions were held virtually to treat four selected triggers (three 
auditory triggers and one visual trigger). The three auditory triggers were successfully lowered 
according to MAQ scores after 2 sessions per trigg er. The visual trigger took longer to treat, but 
after 8 sessions the patient and therapist mutually agreed to terminate treatment, as the response 
to the visual trigger had been sufficiently reduced. Sarah’s MAQ scores after treatment and in a 
4-month and  10-month follow -up show a reduction in the responses to the specific triggers. 
However, just as the previous case study, the effect  on non -treated triggers is not known. In 
addition, the visual trigger and one of the audio triggers were caused by the same  action, but the 
response to the visual trigger took longer to treat and did not reduce when the response to the

16 audio trigger was reduced. This again shows that counterconditioning is primarily effective on 
individual triggers and does not provide an overall treatment for Misophonia. The author notes 
that while the assessment scores provide empirical support for thi s treatment, they do not prove 
generalized effectiveness; in addition, the response severity could also have been produced by 
avoiding triggering situations and implementing other coping techniques that occurred in tandem 
to counterconditioning treatment.  
The final case study was published in 2022 and covers the treatment of a 47-year-old 
female (pseudonym Olivia), diagnosed with bipolar II and self -reporting Misophonia (T. Dozier, 
2022) . Her Misophonia and other conditions were extreme enough to lead to consistent 
withdrawal and avoidance, spending about 95% of her time alone. The MAQ was used 
throughout the course of treatment to measure progress, and the AMISOS was used prior to 
treatm ent and concluding treatment to provide a validated measure of treatment success. Over 13 
weeks, the counterconditioning treatment was taught and applied, beginning by identifying 
physical reflexes to triggers, then using PMR to relax the reflex with recor ded triggers in 
combination with positive stimuli. Based on the AMISOS score taken in the first session, after 
the last session, and a year after treatment, the severity of Olivia’s Misophonia was reduced by 
over 80%. This case study provides further suppo rt for counterconditioning in the context of the 
five-phase model of Misophonia, but because the theory and treatment are experimental and 
unvalidated, no conclusion data can be drawn.  
In addition to these case studies, another  published paper makes significant mention  of 
the counterconditioning technique and specifically NRT. Noziglia et al. (2019)  developed a 
gamified version of the Trigger Tamer app developed by Dozier. The Trigger Tamer app allows 
the patient to self -administer NRT by playing positive sounds  while introducing user -selected

17 triggers at low volume and frequency. Noziglia et al. sought to improve on this app by 
introducing in -game rewards to encourage continued use and using a game system to create a 
more meaningful context for the treatment. This paper, like many others, also mentions the 
common use of noise cancelling headphones and noise masking as a way of reducing the impact 
of triggers, but specifically points out that this technique does not have any long-term positive 
impact on the severity of the patient’s Misophonia.  
The counterconditioning treatment, based on the five -phase model of Misophonia, has 
been shown to successfully reduce the severity of specific triggers in case studies, using both 
unvalidated and validated measures. Dozier does note that this treatment has  only shown 
effectiveness on the specific triggers being treated and  might be best used in combination with 
other treatments such as CBT. In addition, no clinical study or even group study has been 
performed, so the broad effectiveness of this treatment is  unknown.  
1.4.4 Pharmaceutical  Treatments  
There is a dearth  of research on the effects of pharmaceutical treatments on Misophonia 
and its symptoms. Two reports were identified in the literature review that mention the use of 
specific pharmaceuticals in the treatment of Misophonia. The reports are either hypothetic al or 
case studies, suggesting a theoretical precedent for pharmaceutical treatments (Karalis et al., 
2022) . However, further research is needed into this area of treatment, specifically beginning 
with the pharmaceutical treatments that have been studied for tinnitus and hyperacusis, as 
mentioned in the introduction.  
Webb & Keane (2022)  proposed a hypothetical treatment plan for Misophonia using 
MDMA, generally known as ecstasy. They drew comparisons between the symptoms of 
Misophonia and other conditions that have been treated with MDMA, including post -traumatic

18 stress disorder (PTSD). The authors suggest that MDMA could reduce the perception of strong 
negative stimuli, reduce the autonomic hyperarousal that occurs with PTSD and therefore 
potentially  Misophonia, increase cognitive flexibility, and improve close relationships with 
individuals who are often the source of severe triggers . These effects have been proven  in 
separate  studies treating PTSD and other disorders, but no studies have been performed to 
validate these effects on Misophonia. The authors suggest using the treatment protocol  used in 
the Multidisciplinary Association  for Psychedelic Studies Phase 3 studies for PTSD treatment 
with MDMA. Although no published study has used this treatment yet, the noted similarities 
between PTSD and Misophonia could point to the potential effectiveness of MDMA in the 
future.  
Pan et al. (2022)  reported on the effects of risperidone treatment on the Misophonia of a 
patient presenting with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability, generalized 
anxiety disorder, and schizoaffective disorder. The authors note that risperidone has been  
researched as a potential treatment for hyperacusis, which shares similarities with Misophonia as 
discussed in the introduction. The patient scored a 31 out of 40 on the AMISOS -revised 
(AMISOS -R) scale upon admission; after a few days of risperidone dosag e, the patient’s 
AMISOS -R score dropped to a 5. A follow -up 2 months after the treatment began showed that 
the patient’s Misophonia remained improved. The cause of the effectiveness of risperidone on 
the Misophonia is unknown, particularly when other drugs  failed. More research is required to 
understand the biological causes of Misophonia and how risperidone impacts those causes.

19 1.4.5 Miscellaneous  Treatments  
Reports that were not similar to  any other reports or did not fit into the categories 
outlined in the literature reviews were collected into a miscellaneous category. Each of the 
reports is briefly described below.  
The first miscellaneous report used conventional behavioral treatment on a patient with 
misophonia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The authors used behavioral therapy instead of 
CBT because of the lack of strong verbal communicative skills in the patie nt that are necessary 
for the application of CBT. Using an ABA -based treatment showed success in reducing the 
sound -based problem behaviors in the patient. The authors do note that their research is difficult 
to generalize, a common problem in treatment of  individuals with ASD.  
Cowan et al. (2022)  introduced a model for misophonia building on the Pavlo vian 
conditioning theory developed by M. M. Jastreboff & Jastreboff (2002) . The authors point out 
that the Jastreboff  model does not account for the initial unconditioned response that leads to 
anger as a conditioned response to specific sounds. In response, the authors suggest that rigidity 
toward a specific sound made by a specific person could start the cycle of incre ased awareness to 
sounds, distress from sounds, and expanding triggers in new situations. Based on this model, 
they introduce a theoretical treatment framework termed experiential acceptance and stimulus 
engagement (EASE). A vignette of a patient with miso phonia is introduced and the treatment 
plan is applied to the case, focusing on ending toxic hope, reducing avoidance of sounds, and 
actively dealing properly with triggering situations. This model is theoretical,  and the treatment 
is unvalidated.  
Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) was used by I. Jager et al. 
(2021)  in a small study to treat misophonia using specific traumatic experiences. When evaluated

20 using the  AMISOS -R scale, all but one of the seven patients showed improvement, and two 
patients demonstrated a full response rate according to the CGI -Improvement scale. The study 
has many limitations, including bias, lack of a control, a small sample size, and la ck of a follow -
up to determine long -term effects. However, the study showed that EMDR is worth 
investigating, especially as an alternative treatment when CBT is not available .  
Frank & Mckay (2018)  introduced an idea of applying inhibitory learning to exposure 
therapy when treating misophonia. They suggest that applying inhibitory learning to interrupt the 
usual pattern of trigger and response can lead to better results when traditional exposure the rapy 
does not achieve the desired result in session. Exposure therapy is traditionally viewed 
negatively by those who have misophonia, but the individual results of the treatments applied by 
the authors seem to show incremental improvement in the condition  of the patients.  
Finally, P. J. Jastreboff & Jastreboff (2014)  summarize tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) 
and the use of sound generators to mask trigger noises. They primarily discuss TRT in relation to 
hyperacusis, but also show how a similar treatment can be used to both lessen the short -term 
effects of trigger n oises with sound masking and reduce long -term misophonic responses with a 
form of exposure therapy.  
1.5 Conclusions  
The primary goals of this paper were to identify the current research into treatments for 
misophonia and pinpoint any areas that could be investigated in the future based on research 
from tinnitus, hyperacusis, and other auditory -related disorders. The bulk of research into the 
treatments of misophonia is focused on psychiatric treatments and therapies. This makes sense 
because most of the current research is being performed by clinicians who are treating patients, 
and so they use the fully validated tools currently at their disposal. Experimentally, m any of

21 these therapies have shown success in treating misophonia. However, because  of the nature of 
the current research, most reports are case studies or small studies and do not provide strong 
conclusive evidence for any particular treatment. There is no standard model for understanding 
how misophonia functions, and there are no stand ard treatments or protocols available currently.   
Additionally , because the primary research focus is on psychiatric treatments, other 
methods of treatment for disorders like tinnitus and hyperacusis that have proven effective 
independently or in conjunction with psychiatric treatments have not been investigated for 
misophonia, as shown in Figure 1.2 .  
 
Figure 1.2  Treatments sorted by applications with multiple studies . 
 
Alternative medicines like acupuncture have been used by those suffering from 
misophonia, but no research has been done to validate the effectiveness of these methods. More 
importantly, audiological methods such as noise masking technology or noise canceli ng 
technology are commonly used by people with misophonia, but little research has been done into

22 the pros and cons of these technologies, especially in conjunction with psychiatric methods, as is 
often applied in TRT for tinnitus or hyperacusis.  
1.6 Future Research  
More research is needed to investigate the generalizability of many of the psychiatric 
treatments covered in this paper. CBT is the only treatment that has been validated through an 
RCT, and other treatments show promise based on the case studies and repor ts.  
Alternative methods of treatment such as medication and alternative medicine would also 
benefit from further research . These treatments have not been researched effectively for 
misophonia but have shown strong results for other auditory disorders.  
Finally, more research is needed for the use of technology and audiological tools to treat 
misophonia, especially in conjunction with psychiatric treatments. This is a common and 
validated style of holistic treatment for tinnitus and other disorders but  has not been researched 
effectively for misophonia treatment.

23 CHAPTER II  
SELECTIVE NOISE CANCELLING APPLICATION FOR MISOPHONIA TREATMENT  
2.1 Introduction to Misophonia and Problem Statement  
2.1.1 Definition of Misophonia  
Misophonia is an sensory disorder  where specific stimuli , usually auditory,  trigger the 
fight -flight -freeze ( F3) response, causing extreme reactions in the sufferer, usually in the form of 
anger, panic, or anxiety , as can be seen in  Figure 2.1 . An official definition can be found in 
Swedo et al. (2022):  
“Misophonia is a disorder of decreased tolerance to specific sounds or stimuli… that tend 
to evoke strong negative emotional, physiological , and behavioral responses that are not seen in 
most other people. Misophonic responses do not seem to be elicited by the loudness of auditory 
stimuli, but rather by the specific pattern or meaning to an individual... who may have difficulty 
distracting th emselves from the stimulus and may experience suffering, distress, and/or 
impairment in social, occupational, and aca demic functioning.” (Swedo et al., 2022b)  
 
Figure 2.1  Simplified visualization of the mechanics of Misophonia .

24 The specific point of the definition is that the strong negative reactions occur in the 
presence of specific  stimuli; that is, a stranger on the street eating noisily may not have the same 
effect as a close family member eating in the same manner. The most common specific stimuli, 
or “triggers”, include eating -related sounds such as chewing and crunching, repetitive sounds 
such as clicking, picking, and tapping, and other mouth and nose sounds like breathing, sniffing 
and coughing, drinking, and swallowing (Cecilione et al., 2022; Dover & McGuire, 2021; T. H. 
Dozier, 2015c; Karalis et al., 2022; Rosenthal et al., 2021; Schneider & Arch, 2017) . Other non -
auditory triggers can be developed as well, such as jaw movement, leg swinging, and repetitive 
motions that may or may not be linked to auditory triggers (Cavanna & Seri, 2015; Edelstein et 
al., 2013; A. Schröder et al., 2013) .  
Anecdotal reports show that the strong negative emotional, physiological, and behavioral 
responses often include outbursts of anger, extreme panic attacks, self -isolation, and in some 
cases self -harm behaviors. Those suffering from misophonia express feeli ngs of intense, 
uncontrollable rage which can then lead to guilt, especially if the anger is directed towards a 
loved one. Others mention panic attacks so severe that radical self -isolation seems to be the only 
response. Most people with misophonia have id entified significant detriment to their 
relationships, work lives, and mental and emotional health .  
2.1.2 Current  State of Research  
As the date of the official definition suggests, research into this condition is limited and 
recent. Estimates of the pervasiveness of misophonia suggest that somewhere around 5% or 6 % 
of the population suffers from misophonia severe enough to inhibit their daily lives  (Jakubovski 
et al., 2022; X. Zhou et al., 2017) . This is similar to  the prevalence of tinnitus, a well -researched 
auditory disorder with somewhere between 5% and 10% of the population showing tinnitus

25 symptoms that affect their daily lives. Misophonia  is more prevalent than commonly known  
disorders like  OCD  (Adam et al., 2012; Mohammadi et al., 2004; Sasson et al., 1997) . However, 
despite the prevalence of misophonia, the research conducted specifically concerning the 
treatment of misophonia consists primarily of psychiatric case studies  (Cavanna & Seri, 2015; 
Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Potgieter et al., 2019; Yilmaz & Hocaoglu, 2021) , with a 
few large studies using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)  (I. J. Jager et al., 2021; Roushani & 
Mehrabizadeh Honarmand, 2021; A. E. Schröder et al., 2017) . This dearth of research into 
treatments for misophonia is unacceptable given the prevalence  of the condition.  
The initial research into misophonia compared it to other sensory conditions, specifically 
tinnitus and hyperacusis  (Aazh et al., 2019; Henry et al., 2022; M. M. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 
2002; P. J. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014; P. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2015; Meltzer & Herzfeld, 
2014; Raj -Koziak et al., 2021) . Both these conditions have decades of research into possible 
treatments, ranging from psychiatric to pharmacological to physical sound masking and hearing 
aids to alternative medicines and surgeries  (Auerbach et al., 2014; Baguley, 2003; Baguley & 
Hoare, 2018; Bhatt et al., 2017; Czornik et al., 2022; F Cima et al., 2012; Fackrell et al., 2017; 
Henry, 2022; Holmes & Padgham, 2011; Kalle et al., 2018; Michiels et al., 2016; Nolan et al., 
2020; Searchfi eld et al., 2017; Stobik et al., 2005; Zachriat & Kröner -Herwig, 2004) . Because 
the symptoms and triggers for these conditions are similar to misophonia, Jastreboff and 
Jastreboff (2014) suggest that tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) could be applied to hyperacusis, 
misophonia, and similar conditions with decreased sound tolerance.  From their example , future 
research into misophonia could  be concentrated on these already validated methods of treatment 
to evaluate  their effectiveness with misophonia treatment.

26 Specifically, many anecdotal reports show that people with misophonia often use noise 
cancelling technology to remove triggers from their environment  (Frank & Mckay, 2018; 
Noziglia et al., 2019; Petersen & Twohig, 2022; Smith et al., 2022) , but most clinicians warn that 
this coping mechanism actually increases sensitivity to triggers and does not help in long -term 
reduction of misophonic symptoms  (Cecilione et al., 2022; Noziglia et al., 2019; Schneider & 
Arch, 2017) . The Jastreboffs and others suggest that using noise cancelling or masking in a 
structured manner with psychiatric treatments could be beneficial for misophonia as it is for 
tinnitus and hyperacusis  (Bernstein et al., 2013; T. H. Dozier, 2015a; Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -
Llort, 2022; I. Jager et al., 2022; P. J. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014; Petersen & Twohig, 2022; 
Smith et al., 2022) . In this type of treatment (hereafter termed audiological treatment), 
specifically designed noise cancelling or masking is used to slowly introduce sounds to the 
patient with therapy sessions, with full control over the sounds in the hands of the clinician or 
patient. The objective is to give the patient the tools to manage  the sounds in a controlled 
environment, so as they experience sounds in an uncontrolled environment,  they are able to cope 
properly. Figure 2.2  shows how the applications for this type of treatment with tinnitus and 
hyperacusis can reveal a potential application for misophonia.  
 
Figure 2.2  Potential  application of audiological treatment for misophonia using specific 
control of types of sounds .

27  
Tinnitus treatment uses generated white noise at specific frequencies to control the 
characteristic ringing in the ears. Hyperacusis treatment uses noise cancelling or noise masking 
with adjustable volumes to control the loudness of sounds. Because misopho nia deals with 
specific types of sounds (as seen in the definition and examples), the type of noise cancelling or 
masking needed for misophonia treatment is selective noise cancelling, where the volume of 
specific noises can be controlled. This will allow control over when trigger sounds are 
experienced and how extreme they are, which will give clinicians the opportunity to teach proper 
coping mechanisms to patients in a controlled environment and allow patients to practice those 
coping mechanisms with cont rol over their environments .  
2.1.3 Problem  Statement  
The aim of this research is to investigate the potential of using selective noise cancelling 
in a similar setting to the audiological treatments mentioned above . The hypothesis is that audio 
clips with trigger sounds cancelled using selective noise cancelling will elicit a lower misophonic 
response from a person with misophonia than a trigger sound without selective noise cancelling. 
Validating this hypothesis will allow for further investigation into using selective noise 
cancelling with forms of audiologi cal treatment for a more holistic approach to misophonia 
treatment.

audio

tinnitus retraining therapy to misophonia

28 2.2 Background Literature Reviews  
2.2.1 Outline of Background  
There are two critical factors to answering the primary research question. The first is 
developing a prototype of selective noise cancelling to be used on misophonia trigger sounds, 
and the second is a method of evaluating  the selective noise cancelling to validate the hypothesis. 
Section 2.2 gives background on how selective noise cancelling can be designed using neural 
networks, and Section 2.2.3  identifies a framework for validating the selective noise cancelling 
in a human study.  
2.2.2 Selective Noise Cancelling Design  
Traditional active noise cancelling , when simplified, has two steps: receive a sound input, 
then cancel the sound, either by reducing the decibel level to zero or playing an inverse sound to 
counteract the sound waves. Selective noise cancelling as discussed in the previous chapter has 
an added step in the middle: before a sound is cancelled, it must be classified to determine 
whether it should be cancelled or not. Figure 2.3  demonstrates th is added step;  sound 
classification is the only necessary development to create the selective noise cancelling proposed 
in this paper from the active noise cancelling processes that already exist .

29

cancelling process proposed in this paper.  
 
Sound recognition is a popular application for artificial neural networks, a type of deep 
learning. Specifically, many papers have investigated using convolutional neural networks 
(CNN) for sound recognition. CNNs expand on the traditional neural network a rchitecture with 
back -propagation training by including convolutional layers. A convolutional layer uses a kernel 
or filter to extract features from the input, usually an image. The kernel is generally small, often 
3𝑥3𝑥1 or 5𝑥5𝑥1, and iterates over the entire image, essentially compressing the image while 
retaining critical features. shows a visual example of a kernel in action.

3x3x1 kernel.  
(Saha, 2018)  
Because kernels can break  down an image into specific features, using multiple 
convolutional layers with different kernels allows the network to decompose the images into 
small features that can be interpreted and used to make classifications or decisions.  Figure 2.5  
shows a n example of this process at different stages, starting with full input images of faces and 
going into specific lines (or feature maps) that can be used to classify the image.

by the neural network.

The feature map outputs of these convolutional layers can be combined with a traditional 
fully connected neural network to create a complex architecture capable of using the extracted 
features to classify images or even identify multiple objects within a single image. Figure 2.6  
shows such a network  with the specific application of handwritten letter recognition.

(Lecun et al., 1998)  
 
CNNs are very capable for image recognition; however, the application of this research is 
sound recognition. The typical technique for sound recognition is to convert the audio into an 
image using spectrograms (Anuntachai & Pavaranchanakul, 2020; B et al., 2020; Huaysrijan & 
Pongpinigpinyo, 2021; Jin et al., 2022; Lee & Kim, 2020; Mkrtchian & Furletov, 2022; Yuh & 
Kang, 2021; Zhang et al., 2021) . A spectrogram displays frequency on the y -axis, time on the x -
axis, and volume (usually in decibels) with the color of the pixels in the image,  as shown in  
Figure 2.7 . This allows the CNN to view a small window of sound as an image and classify it 
based on the extracted features from the convolutional layers.

32

Different types of model architectures building on or deviating from the traditional CNN 
architecture have been investigated. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that factor in the 
sequence of data have also been used  because they allow for contextual interpretation of the clips 
that are used to generate the spectrograms (Chatterjee et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2021; Xia et al., 
2020; T. Zhou et al., 2021) . Pre-existing neural networks like AlexNet have been used with 
success (B et al., 2020) . Some newer research has investigated using multiple networks in 
tandem with spectrograms and waveforms for stronger classification (Dong et al., 2020; C. Y. 
Wang et al., 2020; M. Wang et al., 2020) . While more complex networks such as the examples 
above show high accuracy with sound recognition, the basic CNN architectures used as

33 benchmarks in these papers are accurate enough to provide a minimum viable product for quick 
prototyping and experimentation.  
Most papers used a dataset of clean individual sounds for training and testing. However, 
one paper in particular experimented with using clean sounds for training but introducing 
background noise in the testing dataset to simulate varying noise conditions (C. Y. Wang et al., 
2020) . Because of the specific application of selective noise cancelling, that process was used in 
designing the methods for this research.  
2.2.3 Human Validation of Sound -Related Research  
To find a prior  basis for this study, studies were identified that used human participants to 
rate sounds on some objective scale. Four papers were found that provided examples of similar 
research (Bailes & Dean, 2009; Bolton et al., 2020; Valentin et al., 2022; Young et al., 2017) .  
Two of the studies dealt with emotional responses or valence. Young et al. (2017)  used 
the emotional responses of participants to validate the emotional aspects of the Oxford Vocal 
Sounds database and find differences in how genders perceive emotion through audio. Bailes & 
Dean (2009)  asked participants to rate music clips on valence and arousal in a two -dimensional 
scale to measure how sound structure affected the reaction of the participant.  
The other two studies dealt with recognizing sounds. Valentin et al. (2022)  evaluated  the 
similarly of a recreated airplane cabin mock -up to the sounds of a real airplane cabin by asking 
participants to rate sounds on a similarity Likert scale. Bolton et al. (2020)  showed that 
emergency alarm sounds could be masked by their primary harmonics by asking participants to 
compare an alarm sound to a test sound that had the alarm sound injected into it on certain tests.  
The common format of these studies is a participant listening to a sound out of a pre -
selected and randomized bank of sounds and giving some subjective rating to the sound. The

34 delivery differs from study to study and the goal of the research changes, but the basic 
framework remains the same. Specifically, the self -administered nature of the examples provided 
the groundwork for designing this study.  
2.3 Methods of Study  
2.3.1 Neural Network Design  
Because a basic CNN architecture is capable of providing a strong baseline and rapid 
prototyping, the network used in this experiment is a basic CNN architecture. This particular 
architecture  was chosen out of four basic architectures because it  showed usable results in early 
testing, is quick to train, and easy to explain. Table 2.1  and Figure 2.8  outline the architecture, 
which uses two convolutional layers and two standard dense layers.  
Table 2.1  Proposed CNN architecture description.

Dense  (none, 2)  Softmax  102

35  
Figure 2.8  Proposed CNN architecture for selective noise cancelling.  
 
The input for the network is a spectrogram, as shown in Section 2.2.1 . Each spectrogram 
is 64x87x1  and is generated from a 0.125 second audio clip using a Gaussian window with a 
mean of 512 samples and a standard deviation of 85  samples . 
The architecture had a binary output of “trigger sound/no trigger sound” because 
differentiating between trigger sounds is unnecessary at this time. Future work could investigate 
a multi -output network to classify specific trigger sounds simultaneously.  
2.3.2 Sound Preparation  
Once the neural network was designed, the sounds to be used for training and the 
experiment were selected. Based on the anecdotal reports in case studies and a survey performed 
by Claiborn et al. (2020) , four types of trigger sounds were selected from the top three categories 
of trigger sounds by percentage of people triggered: chewing sounds and crunching sounds were 
selected from the most common category of mouth sounds, sniffing was selected from brea thing

36 sounds, and pen clicking was selected from mechanical sounds. This was done to ensure the 
highest likelihood of participants experiencing reactions to at least one of the sounds. Table 2.2  
shows the categories of sounds from Claiborn et al.  
Table 2.2  Ranking of categories of trigger sounds in terms of commonality.  
Trigger sound  Percent (N = 1,061)  
Mouth sounds, such as chewing, crunching food, lip smacking, 
slurping, tongue clicking, or throat clearing  96.5%  
Breathing sounds, such as gasping, wheezing, sniffing, or other 
loud, mouth sounds  83.3%  
Mechanical sounds made by hand, such as keyboard clicking, 
pen clicking, pencil tapping, crinkling paper, or nail clipping  67.3%  
Foot sounds, such as tapping, stomping, shuffling, or squeaking 
shoes  59.5%  
Hand sounds, such as finger snapping, tapping, or rubbing  58.7%  
Speech sounds, such as consonant sounds (s, k, p, etc.) or 
mispronunciation of words  46.0%  
Mechanical sounds without people involved, such as clock 
ticking, copy machine noise, or phone ringing  38.3%  
Joint sounds, such as knuckle cracking  36.9%  
Other sounds  27.6%  
(Claiborn et al., 2020)  
Then, “neutral” or “control” sounds were selected that are regularly encountered  and 
would likely not cause a misophonic reaction in the participants  (not mentioned in the Claiborn 
study or anecdotes). Ambient sounds of neighborhoods, streets, and nature were selected as a 
category that occurs in every day life and should not be cancelled out; talking with no mouth 
sounds was selected as another category that should not be cancelled out; and finally musi c was 
selected because it is often used to calm down o r mask trigger sounds and so is likely not a 
trigger itself.  
The ‘cancelled ’ sounds, or the sounds that have been run through selective noise 
cancelling, were then created. The first step in the process was to develop a dataset for training.

37 Trigger sounds from the four categories and control sounds from the three categories were sliced 
into 0.25 second increments to match the input of the neural network. The dataset was then split 
into training and validation data with an 80/20 split. The testing dataset was created by using 
new control sounds and trigger sounds mixed with ambient noise, as noted in C. Y. Wang et al. 
(2020)  to simulate real noise conditions. The training and testing datasets were augmented using 
random white noise and volume augments. After the network was trained, the trigger sounds 
were sent through the network to detect and cancel out the triggering portion of the sound clip.  
Figure 2.9  outlines this process. Table 2.3  shows the number of sounds in each category to be 
used for the study.

38 2.3.3 Recruitment  
Participants for the study were selected from the population of people with misophonia, 
either self -diagnosed or with an official diagnosis. The misophonia community on Reddit 
(www.reddit.com/r/misophonia ) was selected as the single largest population of people with 
misophonia that allows recruitment for approved research. At the time of the study, there were 
over 65,000 members in the community. Participants were recruited with a post containing a 
basic description of the research and a link to the Qualtri cs survey. In addition , participants were 
recruited through a mailing list with over 800 members who were willing to participate in online 
surveys related to misophonia. A power analysis was conducted using an effect size of 0.55 and a 
power of 0.8  taken from the example of Bolton et al. (2020) , showing that 16 participants were 
needed.  
2.3.4 Survey  
The Qualtrics survey contained three  sections. The first section of the survey consisted of 
a demographic questionnaire. This questionnaire contained basic demographic questions of age, 
gender, age of onset of misophonia, and if the participant was currently receiving treatment for 
misophonia, whether therapy, audiological aid, pharmacological aid, or some other form of 
treatment. Participants were asked to rate their misophonia on the Misophonia Activation Scale 
(T. Dozier, 2016) . 
The second  section consisted of 48 randomly shuffled questions. Each question contained 
one of the 48 sounds, either a trigger sound, control sound, or cancelled sound, and a slider. On 
the slider, the left -most side  was labeled as “no misophonic reaction to sound” and the right -most 
side was labeled as “extreme misophonic reaction to sound ,” where “misophonic reaction” was 
defined as the reaction the participant generally has to their specific triggers.  This slider captured

39 data on a scale from 1 to 100, which was not visible to respondents . At each question, 
participants were instructed to listen to the sound and rate their reaction to it. After each 
question, participants were asked if they wanted to continue to the next question, to give time for 
recuperation if a trigger was particularly e xtreme. At any point, participants were able to opt out 
from the survey with no ramifications. After the control sounds with talking was a question 
asking what the last word spoken in the  audio clip was. This was to determine if the participant 
was actually responding to the questions, allowing for easier data cleaning. Figure 2.10  shows an 
example of a question with the data cleaning questions .  
 
Figure 2.10  Example of a question in the first portion of the Qualtrics survey.

40 In the third section of the survey , participants were asked to rate on a Likert scale how 
often they were triggered by the specific sounds that occurred in the survey, including the control 
sounds. These questions were used for further data cleaning.  
2.3.5 Data Analysis  
The dependent variable for this study is reaction rating, measured as an integer value on a 
scale of 1 to 100 , where 1 is the lowest possible reaction  to a sound and 100 is the most severe 
reaction possible to a sound . The independent variable is sound category, which has three values: 
control, trigger, and cancelled. The hypothesis is that the reaction rating for cancelled sounds 
will be significantly lower than the reaction rating for trigger sounds . This will indicate that 
selective noise cancelling significantly lowers misophonic reactions to trigger sounds. 
Additionally, the reaction rating for control sounds should be significantly lower than the 
reaction rating of the trigger sounds. This will indicate that the experimental methods were valid, 
in that trigger sounds elicited a higher reaction than non -trigger sounds as is expected for 
participants with misophonia.  
The hypothesis is defined in the following equations:  
𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑑 <𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑔𝑒𝑟  (2.1) 
𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 <𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑔𝑒𝑟  (2.2) 
IBM SPSS software (v. 29) was used for data analysis. The first step in the data analysis 
process was to clean the data. Incomplete responses and r esponses that failed the validation 
checks in the survey were removed. Responses for specific types of trigger sounds were removed 
if the participant responded that they never were triggered by that sound. Responses for specific 
types of ambient sound were  removed if the participant said they were triggered most of the time

41 or always by that type of ambient sound. Then, summary descriptive sta tistics of the reaction 
ratings were calculated for each sound category.  
The hypotheses were then tested using a repeated measures  (RM)  ANOVA test with 
α=0.05. The ANOVA test was chosen because the data generally follows a normal distribution, 
the distributions have similar variance, and the data between participants is independent. The 
sounds in each category (trigger, control, cancelled) were averaged for each participant , creating 
three measures that could be used in the RM ANOVA. After the initial repeated measures 
ANOVA test of the hypotheses, the data was aggregated by typ e of sound ( e.g., chewing, 
ambient crowd noise, cancelled pen click)  for each participant using an average. This more 
detailed aggregation was used to test more detailed effective RM ANOVA tests for each type of 
sound. Finally, further exploratory analyses were conducted to explore the influence of 
demographic factors on reaction ratings.  
The overall effectiveness of the technology was calculated using a unitless metric for 
improved understanding. The responses for the first survey section were converted into values 
per participant using the following equations:  
𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙  𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦  (𝐶𝑆)=|𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑑 −𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 | (2.3) 
𝑇𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑔𝑒𝑟  𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦  (𝑇𝑆)=|𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑑 −𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑔𝑔𝑒𝑟 | (2.4) 
𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠 =𝐶𝑆
𝑇𝑆 (2.5) 
An effectiveness score less than 1 .0 means that the reaction to cancelled sounds is more 
similar to control sounds than trigger sounds, meaning that the technology is effective. A n 
effectiveness  score greater  than 1 .0 means that the reaction to cancelled sounds is closer to the 
reaction to trigger  sounds , meaning the technology is not effective . If 𝑇𝑆=0, then the

42 Effectiveness score is marked as “null .” Effectiveness was calculated for each participant, as 
well as the overall system.  
2.4 Results  
2.4.1 Participants  
The survey was open for 17 days and 113 participants entered responses into the survey. 
Seven  responses were removed because they failed the data validation checks, and 17 responses 
were removed because they were incomplete. The remaining valid responses were cleaned 
according to the processes in Section 2.3.5 . Eight participants rated one or more of the cont rol 
sounds as triggers, and 17 participants rated one or more of the trigger sounds as a control sound; 
these responses were removed from the data. After the initial data validation and cleaning, there 
were 89 valid responses to the survey .  
Participants were predominately female (6 3 female, 19 male, 5 non-binary / third gender, 
2 prefer not to say)  and between 18 and 77 years old  (39.2 ± 15.5). The average age of onset was 
12.7 ± 8.8  years  old, and the average length of time having misophonia at the point the survey 
was taken was 26.5 ± 15.9 years . Out of the 89 participants, 36 selected that they were currently 
receiving or had received treatment ( therapy = 2 4, counseling = 14, audiological treatment = 8, 
pharmacological treatment = 7, other = 10); Table 2.4 . The self -rating on the Misophonia 
Activation Scale revealed that almost all of the participants had a misophonia rating of at least 4 
(6.4 ± 1.9). Figure 2.11  shows the misophonia severity, age of onset, and age of the participants. 
A few participants reported the age of onset as below 5; these responses were not removed 
because there is support for infants and toddlers exhibiting misophonic symptoms (Sanchez & 
Silva, 2018; Siepsiak et al., 2023).

2.4.2 Data Analysis  
2.4.2.1  Summary Statistics  
The summary statistics for  the reaction ratings for  each type of sound were calculated and 
placed in  Table 2.5 . The scale for the reaction ratings is from 1 to 100, where 1 is the lowest 
reaction to a sound and 100 is the most extreme reaction to the  sound.

2.4.2.2  Initial ANOVA Analysis  
The initial RM ANOVA test was run with the three aggregated categories of sounds: 
trigger, control, and cancelled. Mauchly’s test of sphericity showed that the data violated the 
assumption of sphericity, so the Greenhouse -Geisser adjusted measure was used. There was a 
statistically significant effect of the category of sound on the reaction rating by the participant 
(F1.3,114.3 = 497.7, p < 0.001). Figure 2.12  visually displays the marginal means of the three 
categories of sounds.

A post hoc pairwise comparison using least significant difference (LSD)  showed a 
significant difference between the trigger sounds and control sounds ( p < 0.001) and between the 
trigger sounds and cancelled sounds (p < 0.001). However, the difference between the control 
sounds and cancelled sounds was not statistically significant ( p = 0.785).  Table 2.6  shows the 
full results of the pairwise comparison.

46 2.4.2.3  Detailed ANOVA Analysis  
A more detailed ANOVA analysis was used to measure the differences between specific 
trigger sounds and their corresponding cancelled sounds. Mauchly’s test of sphericity showed 
that the data violated the assumption of sphericity, so the Greenhouse -Geisser adjusted measure 
was used. There was a statistically si gnificant effect of the type of sound on the reaction rating 
by the participant ( F3.4,236.9  = 213.8 , p < 0.001).  Figure 2.13  shows the marginal means of the 
eight types of sounds.

A post hoc pairwise comparison using LSD showed a statistically significant decrease in 
the reaction rating between each trigger sound and the corresponding cancelled sound ( e.g., chew 
and cancelled chew) ( p < 0.001 for each set of sounds). Table 2.7  shows the full pairwise 
comparison.

2.4.2.4  Exploratory Analyses  
To use ANOVA analyses with the demographic data , the values for age, age of onset of 
misophonia, and the length of time having misophonia were aggregated  into buckets , in addition 
to the time of day in which the survey was taken . Following the assumptions  of normality and 
equal variance, the buckets were designed to capture a generally normal distribution for each set 
of data.  Table 2.8  shows the divisions of the buckets for each set of data.

(Sanchez & Silva, 2018; Siepsiak et al., 2023)  
Gender, severity of misophonia, age, age of onset, and length of time having misophonia 
were all tested individually as between -subjects factors for the basic ANOVA with the three 
aggregated categories of sound and for the detailed ANOVA with the eight aggregated types of 
sound.  The time the survey was taken was also tested. As shown in Table 2.9 , none of the tests 
resulted in a significant effect of the demographics on the reaction rating. In addition, linear 
regression tests on the continuous variables did not result in significant correlations.

2.4.2.5  Effectiveness Score  
The effectiveness score of the technology for each participant was calculated using the 
equations in Section  2.3.5 . The mean effectiveness score was 0.3  ± 0.16  and a median of 0.05.  
2.5 Discussion  
2.5.1 Hypothesis Validation  
The hypothesis as defined in Equations 2.1 and 2.2 says that selective noise cancelling is 
effective for controlling the misophonic reactions to trigger sounds, which would allow for 
further investigation into using selective noise cancelling for more holistic treatments of 
misophonia  (Bernstein et al., 2013; T. H. Dozier, 2015a; Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; 
I. Jager et al., 2022; P. J. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014; Petersen & Twohig, 2022; Smith et al., 
2022) . The results in Figure 2.12  and Table 2.6  show that in the data collected, trigger sounds are 
rated significantly higher (eliciting a more extreme reaction) than control sounds, which 
validates the measure being used in the study (Swedo et al., 2022) .

51 In addition, the results in  Figure 2.12  and Table 2.6  show that trigger sounds that have 
been modified using selective noise cancelling elicit a significantly lower misophonia response 
than trigger sounds that have not been selectively noise cancelled. This means that selective 
noise cancelling is effective for lowering the misophonic reaction to trigger sounds; or in other 
words, removing the trigger sound with selective noise cancelling removes the reaction to the 
sound, as  the Jastreboffs and others have suggested.  
2.5.2 Further Analyses  
2.5.2.1  Data Cleaning and Processing  
As expected, some participants responded that sounds classified as trigger sounds in the 
study did not trigger them and that some control sounds did trigger them. This is because triggers 
are unique for each individual and cannot be fully generalized for a population of this size. The 
reactions from those specific participants for those sounds were removed.  This removal of data 
did not affect the  outcome of the study because for each sound there were still more responses 
than the required amount.  
Further investigation into the reaction rating data revealed outliers, both extremely low 
responses for trigger sounds and extremely high responses for control and cancelled sounds. 
Figure 2.14 a visually shows the amount of outliers for each category , where the width of the 
violin plot  indicates the number of data points at that reaction rating. Figure 2.14 b shows the 
actual responses of an individual participant  as an example ; the first trigger sound has three 
responses that are high, as expected, and then a fourth response that is close to zero but not zero.  
The most likely explanation for these outliers is that triggers are highly unique  and often people 
with misophonia will be triggered by specific instances of a type of sound and not other 
instances; to reference the definition of misophonia, it is the specific pattern of sound that is

52 triggering  (Swedo et al., 2022) . These outliers were not removed because there is no evidence 
that they are incorrect inputs and the definition of misophonia supports the presence of them.  
Even with the outliers, the ANOVA analyses showed a statistically significant difference.  
 
Figure 2.14  (a) Violin plot of the reaction ratings grouped by the three categories of sounds  and 
(b) Scatter plot of the responses of a single participant.  
 
2.5.2.2  Impact of Types of Sounds  
In this study, four types of trigger sounds were used to increase the likelihood that every 
participant would be triggered by at least one sound. Further exploration in Section 2.4.2.3  
demonstrated that , while selective noise cancelling significantly lowered the reactions to all 
trigger sounds tested, chewing and crunching were more affected than pen clicking and sniffing. 
This is primarily because pen clicking and sniffing are less common or less severe triggers than 
chewing and crunching (Claiborn et al., 2020; Swedo et al., 2022) . 
2.5.2.3  Impact of Demographics  
None of the demographics had a  significant effect on the results, showing that selective 
noise cancelling is effective regardless of variables like age, severity of misophonia, and gender .

53 Other large -scale  studies, while focused on CBT treatments rather than audiological methods, 
have similarly not shown significant differences based on most demographics (I. J. Jager et al., 
2021; A. E. Schröder et al., 2017) . However, other research has suggested that females report 
higher severity of  misophonic symptoms than males (Concepcion et al., 2020; Savard et al., 
2022; Siepsiak et al., 2020) , and the data does appear to show that the female participants  
generally had more severe reactions to all sounds  than male participants , as shown in Figure 
2.15. This difference, if valid, could have an impact on the perceived effectiveness of the 
selective noise cancelling or the desire to use selective noise cancelling in treatment. Therefore, 
further research should be done to confirm or refine the findings of this study  as related to gender 
differences .

54 2.5.3 Limitations  
One of the major limitations of the study is that the environment in which the survey was 
taken was uncontrolled. A preliminary question asking if the participant was in a quiet room with 
earbuds was used in an attempt to mitigate this issue. However, differences in types of earbuds or 
headphones, volume of the device, environmental sound, and other factors could have introduced 
confounding factors  that affected the results, especially with the demographic findings.  
In addition, while the captured demographics showed no significant effect on the results, 
other demographics that were not captured, like nationality, could affect  the results of the study.  
Another limitation was the recruitment process. Most larger studies screen participants 
who have comorbid disorders (I. J. Jager et al., 2021; A. E. Schröder et al., 2017) , while the 
screening in this study was limited to requiring the participant to be over 18 and be self -
diagnosed or professionally diagnosed with misophonia. This was done to ensure the number of 
data points necessary to draw conclusions but  could have introduced confounding factors in the 
participants.  
The survey was unmonitored and self -administered by the participants ; participants could 
have provided incorrect answers, rushed over parts of the survey, or changed environments 
halfway through , especially since the survey required voluntary exposure to trigger sounds. 
While attention validation questions were used and incomplete responses were removed, the 
unmonitored nature of the survey introduces the possibility of incomplete or inaccurate data.  
In addition, the survey allowed the participant to interpret the reaction rating scale, 
meaning that different participants could have different reaction rating values but the same 
reaction, or vice versa. This should have minimal impact on the analyses in this paper because

55 participants were compared against their own answers, but there is a possibility that the 
outcomes were influenced by this relativity.  
Finally, the results  of the study are necessarily limited because only four types of trigger 
sounds and four instances of each trigger sound were tested. The effectiveness of selective noise 
cancelling on the misophonic reaction to other types of trigger sounds , especially less common 
or less severe trigger sounds,  remains an unknown .  
2.5.4 Future Research  
Because of these limitations, more research should be performed with more controlled 
environments, stricter screening, and a broader range of trigger sounds. This will strengthen the 
conclusions drawn from this first step in the research. Experts in misophonia treatment , 
especially those who have performed large studies,  could be consulted on how to improve the 
testing process and environment to reduce the limitations of this study. Additional measures, 
such as physiological metrics or brain scans, could al so be used to measure the severity of the 
misophonic reaction to sounds more accurately . 
This survey design could also be applied in other ways. It could be used as a more 
verifiable method of identifying people with misophonia, as opposed to a questionnaire where 
the patient must recall their perceptions of their reactions to sounds. Ideally the patient would be 
removed entirely from the process of diagnosing misophonia, but using this survey would still 
get closer to the actual reactions of the patient as opposed to their perceptions. Alternatively, the 
survey could be used to investigate and assess potential treatme nts in an A -B style study where 
the participant takes the survey before and after applying treatment and the effects of the 
treatment can be measured more empirically than a self -reporting questionnaire.

56 In addition, the neural network design could be refined. More testing should be 
performed with the parameters of spectrogram generation, dataset creation, and length of audio 
clips. Experimentation with fuzzy logic to allow users to customize the aggressiv eness of the 
network would further validate the intended use case. Further investigation into the more 
complex architectures detailed in Section 2.2.1  is also needed.  
Finally, development and testing of a near real -time algorithm would allow for more 
testing in the intended environment. This research was conducted using an offline algorithm that 
analyzed and selectively cancelled sounds prior to the participant listening to them. Because of 
the design of the selective noise cancelling, real -time performance is impossible with current 
technology; however,  near real -time performance could likely be achieved with a latency of less 
than a quarter second. This could potential ly be applied in treatment settings and everyday use . 
For instance, one of the main difficulties  with current treatment of misophonia is a patient 
anticipating a trigger sound and therefore experiencing the trigger whether they can actually hear 
it or not. Using a near real -time version of selective noise cancelling could allow a clinician to 
expose the patient to a video of someone performing a trigger and use the selective noise 
cancelling to remove the trigger sounds, allowing the patient to reduce their  anticipatory 
reactions over time. Another application could be for video or audio streaming, where the output 
can be lagged slightly to match the latency of the selective noise cancelling system.  
2.6 Conclusions  
The current research into misophonia treatment is limited and primarily comprised of 
case studies and proposed treatments applying therapy techniques often used for anxiety and 
behavioral disorders. However, research into treatments for similar sensory disorders such as 
tinnitus and hyperacusis shows  that a holistic approach, utilizing audiological treatments and

57 alternative methods in addition to therapy, is more effective. The purpose of this research was to 
investigate the feasibility of using selective noise cancelling to control and reduce the 
misophonic reactions to trigger noises  as a first step in applying audiological treatments to 
misophonia.  
A basic prototype of selective noise cancelling was designed and applied to four types of 
trigger sounds. The effectiveness of the selective noise cancelling was evaluated  in an online 
survey with 89 participants. The participants self -rated their reactions to the cancelled trigger 
sounds , un-cancelled trigger sounds , and non -trigger sounds to function as  a control group.  
The results showed that trigger sounds  that had been selectively noise cancelled elicited a 
significantly lower misophonic reaction than trigger sounds  that were not selectively cancelled. 
This means that selective noise cancelling can be applied to triggers to control misophonic 
reactions , allowing clinicians and patients to apply the audiological methods of treatment that are 
already validated  for tinnitus and hyperacusis.  
Future research should investigate the effectiveness of selective noise cancelling on more 
types of trigger sounds in a more controlled environment , as well as more robust and real -time 
designs for the selective noise cancelling.
