Introduction : Misophonia is a disorder characterized by decreased tolerance to 
certain sounds or their associated stimuli, and many measurement tools have 
been developed for its diagnosis and evaluation. The aims of the current study 
were to develop the Turkish version of MisoQuest, a fully validated misophonia 
questionnaire, to evaluate the relationships between misophonia, anxiety, and 
quality of life, and to examine the mediating role of anxiety in the relationship 
between misophonia and quality of life.
Methods:  The reliability of the Turkish version of MisoQuest was conducted 
using data from 548 participants (Mean age = 28.06 ± 9.36). Then, the relationships 
between misophonia, anxiety, and quality of life were evaluated in a separate 
sample of 117 participants (Mean age = 25.50 ± 6.31) using the State–Trait Anxiety 
Inventory (STAI) and the Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire.
Results:  The results showed that the Turkish version of MisoQuest has good 
psychometric properties. Close-to-moderate positive correlations were 
found between misophonia and anxiety, and weak negative correlations were  
found between misophonia and quality of life. Anxiety mediated the relationships 
between misophonia and quality of life.
Discussion:  These results emphasize that misophonia may be an important 
problem affecting people’s quality of life and reveal the mediating role of anxiety 
on this effect.

Introduction
Some individuals experience abnormal emotional, behavioral, and physiological 
reactions to specific everyday sounds ( Ferrer-Torres and Giménez-Llort, 2022 ; Swedo et al., 
2022 ). This is initially introduced as “Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome” ( Bernstein 
et al., 2013 ), now commonly referred to as “misophonia” ( Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2001 ). 
Unlike sounds typically perceived as disturbing, individuals with misophonia suffer from 
decreased tolerance toward ordinary, innocuous, and mostly human-induced sounds such 
as chewing, sniffing, and breathing sounds ( Schröder et al., 2013 ). However, stimuli that 
cause aversive reactions, also called “triggers, ” are not limited to human-produced sounds. 
Studies have reported that all kinds of sounds, regardless of their source, as well as visual 
stimuli and repetitive movements, may trigger misophonic reactions ( Dozier, 2015 ; Hansen OPEN ACCESS

Frontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.orget  al., 2021 ). These reactions are irrespective of the physical 
characteristics of the stimuli (e.g., intensity or spectrum of sounds); 
instead, they are associated with various factors, including the 
individual’s psychological profile, previous experiences with the 
sound, and the context in which the sound is encountered ( Jastreboff 
and Jastreboff, 2001 ).
The most common emotional responses to triggers experienced 
by individuals with misophonia include varying levels of anger, 
irritation, stress, anxiety, and disgust ( Dozier, 2015 ; Jager et al., 2020 ). 
Besides these emotional reactions, sympathetic overactivity (fight-or-
flight response) such as muscle tension, feeling of pressure in the 
chest, arms, and whole body, increase in heart rate and body 
temperature, physical pain and breathing difficulties have been 
reported ( Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Dozier, 2015 ). Behavioral reactions 
involve coping strategies that individuals with misophonia use to 
reduce their exposure to trigger stimuli, such as escaping or avoiding 
situations where the trigger may be  encountered, seeking to 
discontinue the triggering stimuli, and mimicking or reproducing the 
triggers ( Edelstein et al., 2013 ). In extreme cases, verbal, or physical 
violence toward the source of the triggers has also been reported 
(Schröder et al., 2013 ; Tunç and Başbuğ, 2017 ). These maladaptive 
reactions can cause serious negative effects on sufferers’ social life, 
interpersonal relationships, performance of work or academic tasks, 
psychological status, and quality of life ( Schröder et al., 2013 ; Jager 
et al., 2020 ).
There are different approaches in the literature that consider 
misophonia as a component of decreased sound tolerance, a symptom 
associated with various psychiatric disorders, or a new psychiatric 
disorder ( Schröder et al., 2013 ; Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2014 ). Different 
approaches also lead to differences in the criteria proposed for the 
diagnosis of misophonia. In the criteria published by Schröder et al. 
(2013) , misophonic triggers are only sounds produced by other people, 
anger is the dominant reaction, and aversive reactions cannot 
be explained by other psychopathologies. Dozier et al. (2017)  expanded 
these criteria and included all kinds of sounds and stimuli from different 
modalities as misophonic triggers and emphasized the immediate 
physical reflex response. Finally, Jager et  al. (2020)  expanded and 
updated the diagnostic criteria proposed by Schröder et  al. (2013) . 
Although there are various criteria proposed for the diagnosis of 
misophonia, there are no definitive criteria in international official 
diagnostic systems. Different questionnaires and measurement tools 
have been developed to assess the misophonia. The Amsterdam 
Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S) developed by Schröder et al. (2013)  and 
the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ) developed by Wu et al. (2014)  are 
commonly used tools in research and clinics. Recently developed scales 
for misophonia assessment include the MisoQuest ( Siepsiak et  al., 
2020a ), Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ) ( Rosenthal et  al., 
2021 ), Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Scale (S-Five) ( Vitoratou 
et al., 2021 ), Berlin Misophonia Questionnaire-Revised (BMQ - R) 
(Remmert et  al., 2022 ), and New  Y ork Misophonia Scale (NYMS) 
(Barahmand et al., 2023 ).
Differences in assessment and diagnostic criteria of misophonia are 
a barrier to generalizing findings, comparing results across studies, and 
estimating the prevalence of misophonia in the general population 
(Swedo et al., 2022 ). Considering misophonia as a significant social 
problem and conducting further research on its diagnosis and treatment 
seems essential for individuals’ social functioning and quality of life 
(Siepsiak and Dragan, 2019 ). MisoQuest developed by Siepsiak et al. (2020a)  is a fully validated questionnaire developed to assess 
misophonia. MisoQuest was created based on the diagnostic criteria 
proposed by Schröder et al. (2013) . Due to its small number of items 
and single-factor structure, it is considered a rapid and effective tool for 
screening misophonia. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the 
psychometric properties of MisoQuest in the Turkish population, to 
examine the relationships between misophonia and state–trait anxiety 
and health-related quality of life and to assess the mediating role of 
anxiety on the relationship between misophonia and quality of life. The 
findings will provide information on the generalizability of previous 
findings to different populations, contributing to a better understanding 
of the relationship between misophonia and anxiety and the impact of 
misophonic symptoms on individuals’ lives.
Methods
Participants
For the Turkish adaptation of MisoQuest, 548 participants aged 
18–63 were included in the study. The mean age of the participants 
was 28.06 ± 9.36 (female = 27.26 ± 8.87, male = 31.19 ± 10.58). 20% of 
the participants were male ( n = 111) and 80% were female ( n = 437). 
The education level of 77% of the participants ( n = 420) was college or 
above, and 23% ( n = 128) was high school or below. The questionnaire 
was delivered to the participants online via social media applications. 
Participants with self-reported psychiatric diagnoses and hearing 
problems were excluded.
Following the validity and reliability study of the Turkish version 
of MisoQuest, data were collected from a different sample of 122 
participants to evaluate the relationship between misophonia and 
state–trait anxiety and quality of life. The MisoQuest, State–Trait 
Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and 36-item Short-Form Health Survey 
(SF-36) scales were delivered online to the participants at this stage. 
Of the 122 people who participated in the study, three people were 
excluded because they stated that they were diagnosed with anxiety 
disorder and two people were diagnosed with panic disorder, and the 
study continued with 117 people. The mean age was 25.50 ± 6.31 
(female = 24.87 ± 5.84, male = 29.18 ± 7.79). The demographic 
characteristics of the participants are given in Table 1 .
Measurement tools
MisoQuest
The MisoQuest is the first fully validated misophonia 
questionnaire with good psychometric values and excellent reliability 
(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.955). This scale, which includes a single-factor 
and 14 items, was developed by Siepsiak et al. (2020a)  based on the 
misophonia diagnostic criteria published by Schröder et al., with some 
modifications. Unlike the criteria of Schröder et  al., MisoQuest 
includes items related to all kinds of sounds, not only human-
produced sounds. The scale only assesses aversive responses to sounds; 
sensitivities in other sensory modalities are not included. Each item 
has a 5-point Likert-type response category ranging from “1– Strongly 
disagree, ” “2 – Disagree, ” “3 – Undecided, ” “4 – Agree” and “5 – 
Strongly agree. ” There is no reverse item in the MisoQuest and the 
total score ranges from 14 to 70.

Frontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.orgState–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)
The STAI, developed by Spielberger et al. (1970) , is one of the most 
commonly used tools to assess anxiety. It is a 40-item self-assessment 
questionnaire consisting of two subscales that provide separate measures 
of two components of anxiety: state and trait anxiety. The first twenty 
items measure situational or state anxiety (STAI-S), and the second 
twenty items measure underlying or trait anxiety (STAI-T). The State-
Anxiety Scale evaluates how respondents’ feel about anxiety “right now, 
at this moment” through four scales: “1 - Not at all, ” “2 – Somewhat, ” 
“3 - Moderately so, ” and “4 - Very much so. ” The Trait-anxiety Scale 
assesses how people “generally feel” about anxiety with four scales: “1 
Almost never, ” “2 – sometimes, ” “3 - Often, ” and “4 - Almost always. ” 
There are 10 reversed items on the state scale (items 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 
16, 19, and 20), and seven on the trait scale (items 21, 26, 27, 30, 33, 36, 
and 39). The range of scores is from 20 to 80, the higher the score 
indicating greater anxiety. In this study, the Turkish version of STAI 
adapted by Öner and Le Compte (1983)  was used. The Cronbach alpha 
value reported by Öner and La Compte is between 0.83–0.87 for the 
Trait Anxiety Scale and between 0.94–0.96 for the State Anxiety Scale.
36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)
The SF-36 is a standard measurement tool for assessing health-
related quality of life and was developed by Ware and Sherbourne 
(1992) . It is a Likert-type scale made up of 36 items, divided into eight 
dimensions: (i) Physical Functioning (PF), which assesses whether 
health conditions interfere with the ability to perform daily life activities; 
(ii) Physical Role Functioning (RP), which measures functional 
limitations due to health problems; (iii) Emotional Role Functioning 
(RE) which evaluates functional limitations by emotional problems; (iv) 
Social Functioning (SF), which impacts in quantity and quality of social 
activities induced by mental and physical problems; (v) Mental Health 
(MH), which measures aspects of depressive and anxiety; (vi) General 
Health (GH), which evaluates individual health status and its 
development tendency; (vii) Bodily Pain (BP), which measures degrees 
of pain to daily activities; and (viii) Vitality (VT), which is a subjective 
assessment of energy and tiredness. The scale has no total score; 
sub-dimension scores can range from 0 to 100, and higher scores mean 
better health status. The scores in these 8 domains can be reduced to two general components: The Physical Component Summary (PCS) score 
is calculated using the four physical health dimensions: PF, RP , BP and 
GH. The Mental Component Summary (MCS) score is calculated using 
the four mental health perceptions: VT, SF, RE and MH. In this study, 
the Turkish version of the SF-36 adapted by Koçyigit et al. (1999)  was 
used. Cronbach’s alpha values reported by Koçyiğit et al. range between 
0.73 and 0.76 for the subscales.
Procedure
For the adaptation of MisoQuest to Turkish, written permission 
was first obtained from the developers of the questionnaire. 
MisoQuest, originally written in Polish, was translated from Polish to 
Turkish by a native Turkish translator who speaks Polish fluently. The 
Turkish translation was shared with the developers of the original 
version of MisoQuest, and a back translation into Polish was provided 
by a translator who speaks Turkish and Polish. An audiologist and a 
psychologist examined the Turkish translation of the questionnaire. 
Then, the questionnaire was applied to 5 individuals, and final 
adjustments were made in line with their feedback.
Statistical analysis
For the item analysis of MisoQuest, corrected item-total 
correlation was used. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to 
evaluate the construct validity of MisoQuest. CFA was performed 
using maximum likelihood estimation and robust versions of the fit 
indices because of the non-normal distribution of data. The goodness-
of-fit of the model was examined with the ratio of chi-square value to 
degrees of freedom ( X2/df), root mean square error of approximation 
(RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI), and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI). 
For these indices, the following cut-off values were used to indicate 
the goodness of model fit: X2/df ≤ 3, RMSEA ≤0.06, CFI ≥ 0.95, 
TLI ≥ 0.95 ( Hu and Bentler, 1999 ). Internal consistency was tested 
with Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Cronbach’s alpha 
coefficient and Spearman-Brown coefficient were used in reliability TABLE 1  Demographic characteristics of participants.

test was used. Pearson’s and Spearman’s rank correlations coefficients 
analysis were conducted to assess the relationship between misophonia 
and state anxiety, trait anxiety and quality of life. A value of p < 0.05 
was considered statistically significant. The PROCESS macro for SPSS, 
a bootstrapping technique developed by Hayes (2017)  was used to 
evaluate the mediating role of anxiety on the relationships between 
misophonia and quality of life. The number of bootstrap resamples 
was set at 5000. If the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence 
interval did not include zero, the mediation effect was considered 
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using R 
software (Version 4.3.3.), IBM SPSS 25.0, and IBM SPSS AMOS 25.0 
programs (SPSS Statistics Version 25.0. IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
Results
Item-total analysis
The corrected item-total correlation coefficients were between 
0.49 and 0.70. These coefficients are shown in Table 2  for each item.
Confirmatory factor analysis
First, the single-factor model of the Turkish version of the 
MisoQuest was evaluated. As a result of confirmatory factor analysis, the following goodness-of-fit indices were obtained: X2  = 338.02 
(df = 77), X2/df = 4.39, RMSEA = 0.09, CFI = 0.89, and TLI = 0.87. These 
indices indicated a poor fit between the model and the data. A parallel 
analysis was conducted to determine the appropriate factor structure. 
This analysis suggested a 3-factor structure. For the 3-factor structure, 
the following goodness-of-fit indices were obtained: X2  = 200.45 
(df = 74), X2/df = 2.71, CFI = 0.95; TLI = 0.94; RMSEA = 0.06. These 
indices indicated that the 3-factor model good fit between the model 
and the data. The goodness of fit values of the testing models are given 
in Table 3 . The confirmatory factor analysis model for MisoQuest is 
given in Figure 1 .
Factor loadings
Factor loadings for all items ranged from 0.46 to 0.66. The first 
factor (1.-5. and 7. items) was named “Emotional Reactions, ” the 
second factor (6., 8., 9., 12., 14. items) was named “ Anger and 
Avoidance, ” and the third factor (10., 11., 13. items) was named 
“Functionality. ” Factor loadings are shown in Table 2 .
Reliability analysis
According to the internal consistency analysis results, the 
correlations between the total score of MisoQuest and the sub-factors 
were significant and varies between 0.79 and 0.89. Correlation TABLE 2  Corrected item-total correlation and factor loadings.

entire questionnaire is 0.90. It was 0.85 for the “Emotional Reactions, ” 
0.79 for the “ Anger and Avoidance, ” and 0.72 for the “Functionality. ” 
Spearman-Brown coefficient is found to be  0.92 for the whole 
MisoQuest and 0.86, 0.78 and 0.74 for the sub-factors, respectively.
Second order confirmatory factor analysis
After the first-order confirmatory model was confirmed, the 
second-order confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to identify 
whether all factors can be placed under a higher-order factor. This 
analysis reveals that three-factor measures a higher-order underlying 
construct, with very good reliability (0.84). The second-order latent variable was defined as “Misophonia. ” Thus, it is possible to consider 
that the total score of MisoQuest measures a latent misophonia 
variable manifested through three sub-factors of MisoQuest.
The relationship between misophonia and 
anxiety and quality of life
Statistically significant and close to moderate positive correlations 
were found between the MisoQuest total and sub-factors scores, and 
“STAI-State anxiety” scores ( r  = 0.349, r  = 0.289, r  = 0.384, and 
r = 0.286, respectively) as well as “STAI-Trait anxiety” scores ( r = 0.334, 
r = 0.317, r = 0.335, and r = 0.247, respectively). Statistically significant 
weak negative correlations were found between the MisoQuest total,

Frontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.orgMisoQuest Total score was determined as the independent variable 
and the three sub-factor scores of SF-36 [Vitality (VT), Social 
Functioning (SF) and Mental Health (MH)] that had a significant 
correlation with MisoQuest Total were determined as the dependent 
variable. For both state and trait anxiety, total effect of misophonia on 
SF-36 (VT), SF-36 (SF), SF-36 (MH) was statistically significant. The 
indirect effect of misophonia on SF-36 (VT), SF-36 (SF), SF-36 (MH) 
was also statistically significant. However, the direct effect of 
misophonia on SF-36 (VT), SF-36 (SF), SF-36 (MH) was not 
significant. These results suggest that state and trait anxiety fully 
mediated the relationship between misophonia and quality of life. The 
results of the mediation analysis are presented in Figure 3  and Table 6 .Discussion
A growing number of studies have attempted to understand 
symptoms of misophonia, its pathophysiology, prevalence, and 
relationship with different audiological, psychological, and 
psychiatric factors ( Siepsiak and Dragan, 2019 ; Ferrer-Torres and 
Giménez-Llort, 2022 ). However, standard measurement tools used 
in clinics and research for the diagnosis and evaluation of 
misophonia are still lacking ( Swedo et al., 2022 ). The purposes of 
the present study are to examine the Turkish psychometric 
properties of MisoQuest, to evaluate the relationships between 
misophonia, state and trait anxiety and health-related quality of

structure for the Turkish version of MisoQuest. Since the factor 
loadings were greater than 0.3 and goodness-of-fit indices were 
good and quite acceptable in the CFA, the three-factor structure 
was considered appropriate. Reliability analyses indicate that the 
Turkish version of MisoQuest has high internal consistency. 
Cronbach’s alpha coefficient is very close to the value obtained in 
the original version of the questionnaire ( α = 0.955) ( Siepsiak et al., 
2020a ). Moreover, corrected item-total correlations indicate that 
each item contributes sufficiently to the total score. The results demonstrate that the Turkish version of MisoQuest is valid 
and reliable.
In the Turkish version of MisoQuest, items related to individuals’ 
internal emotional experiences, items related to anger response and 
avoidance of social environments, and items related to functionality 
in daily life are collected into three separate factors, unlike the 
original single-factor version of the questionnaire. A similar 
difference in factor structure between the original questionnaire and 
its Turkish version was also reported in the MQ ( Wu et al., 2014 ; 
Sakarya and Çakmak, 2022 ). It is possible that the experience and 
expression of misophonia may vary as a result of social and cultural 
norms in different societies. Zhou et al. (2017) , reported weaker TABLE 6  Mediation of the relationship between misophonia and quality of life by state and trait anxiety.

Frontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.orgcorrelations between misophonia symptoms and impairment in 
functioning in Chinese students than in American students. Turkey 
is considered a collectivist country in terms of cultural values such 
as commitment to the group and family ( Kağitçibasi, 1996 ) and is 
similar to China in this context ( Suh et  al., 1998 ). Obtaining a 
different factor structure from the original questionnaire in this 
study may be due to these characteristics of Turkish culture. Studies 
that evaluate different cultures with the same standard measurement 
tools will increase our knowledge of the cross-cultural characteristics 
of misophonia.
Due to differences in assessment methods, measurement tools and 
diagnostic criteria, the frequency of misophonia reported in studies 
varies within a wide range between 3 and 55% ( Jastreboff and 
Jastreboff, 2014 ; Wu et al., 2014 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ; Naylor et al., 2021 ). 
In a study conducted with depression patients using MisoQuest, it was 
reported that 8.5% of the patients met the misophonia criteria both in 
face-to-face interviews and in MisoQuest (when the cut-off value was 
61 and above) ( Siepsiak et al., 2020b ). In another study conducted 
with 253 individuals using the same cut-off value, 69% of participants 
had self-reported misophonia, while 45% of those reporting self-
reported misophonia met the MisoQuest cut-off criterion ( Enzler 
et al., 2021 ). In our study, misophonia was detected in 2% of the total 
sample (N = 665) according to this cut-off value. Although this 
percentage is lower than those reported in other studies, it is close to 
Jastreboff and Jastreboff ’s (2014)  estimates of 3.2%. It is thought that 
the higher frequencies of misophonia reported for different 
measurement tools may be related to the fact that these tools include 
more general sound sensitivities and lower severity misophonia 
symptoms in measurement ( Siepsiak et al., 2020b ). Individuals with 
misophonia find similar stimuli to be  aversive to those without 
misophonia, but they experience extreme levels of aversion ( Edelstein 
et al., 2013 ). Additionally, when only severe symptoms are taken into 
account, the misophonia frequency reported in the studies decreases 
considerably ( Naylor et al., 2021 ). MisoQuest appears to detect more 
severe and quality of life impairing levels of misophonia, consistent 
with the purpose for which it was developed ( Siepsiak et al., 2020b ). 
Evaluations using different misophonia measurement tools on the 
same population may provide comparable findings regarding 
these tools.
Although misophonia is considered a separate disorder with 
unique clinical features and neurophysiological mechanisms, many 
studies are reporting a relationship between misophonia and different 
psychiatric symptoms and psychopathologies ( Schröder et al., 2013 ; 
Erfanian et al., 2019 ; Jager et al., 2020 ). Two studies conducted with 
similar methodology on samples from different cultures found 
significant positive correlations between misophonia symptoms 
assessed by MQ and anxiety, depression, and OCD symptoms ( Wu 
et al., 2014 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ). In patients with depression, anxiety was 
found to be more highly correlated with the severity of misophonia 
measured with MisoQuest than other variables ( Siepsiak et al., 2020b ). 
Additionally, studies have shown that anxiety has a mediating role on 
anger outbursts associated with misophonia ( Wu et al., 2014 ; Zhou 
et al., 2017 ). In our study, a significant, close to moderate positive 
correlation was obtained between MisoQuest scores and STAI-State 
and STAI-Trait anxiety scores. Our findings also show that anxiety has 
a mediating role in the relationship between misophonia and quality 
of life. This finding indicates that as the severity of misophonia 
increases, individuals’ anxiety levels would increase as well, and the deterioration in their quality of life may be a function of this increase 
in anxiety levels. Many studies report that exposure to misophonic 
triggers causes anxiety symptoms ( Edelstein et al., 2013 ). However, 
some studies report that exposure to these triggers elicits anticipatory 
anxiety associated with thinking about future misophonic situations 
rather than eliciting an immediate anxiety response ( Jager et al., 2020 ). 
Based on the relationship between misophonia and anxiety, there are 
studies that suggest anxiety treatment approaches in the treatment of 
misophonia ( Bernstein et al., 2013 ). Randomized controlled clinical 
studies are needed to better understand the causal relationship 
between misophonia and anxiety. These studies may also provide a 
better evaluation of the effectiveness of anxiety-based intervention 
in misophonia.
Negative reactions caused by misophonia can cause deterioration 
in both interpersonal relationships and work or academic task 
performance, and can remarkably affect the person’s well-being, daily 
functionality, and quality of life ( Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Wu et al., 2014 ; 
Zhou et al., 2017 ; Ferrer-Torres and Giménez-Llort, 2022 ). The impact 
of misophonia on an individual’s quality of life can range from a mild 
effect to severe impairment. The greater the severity of misophonia, 
the greater the impact on individuals’ quality of life ( Jager et al., 2020 ). 
In our study, individuals’ quality of life was evaluated with the SF-36 
scale, and significant negative correlations were found between the 
misophonia total scores and the Vitality (VT), Social Functioning (SF) 
and Mental Health (MH) factors of the SF-36. The Role Emotional 
(RE) factor of SF-36 was found to be correlated with the “Emotional 
Reactions” factor of MisoQuest. These findings support the previous 
findings that have shown the negative impact of misophonia on an 
individual’s quality of life. Moreover, no correlation was found 
between S-36’s physical health-related factors, Physical Functioning 
(PF), Role Physical (RP), Bodily Pain (BP), General Health (GH), and 
misophonia levels. Although some people with misophonia report 
that they also experience unpleasant sounds as painful, the 
comorbidity of misophonia with any somatic problems has not been 
reported ( Rosenthal et al., 2022 ). Our findings support the previously 
reported view that misophonia is perceived as a mental problem 
rather than a physical problem ( Kılıç et  al., 2021 ). However, this 
finding may be related to the fact that the majority of our sample 
consisted of normal individuals without a diagnosis of clinically 
significant misophonia.
Limitations
There are several limitations in this study. First, using the 
online self-report method in data collection may cause recruitment 
bias. Second, participants’ psychological and audiological 
diagnoses were based on self-report. Evaluations made by clinical 
psychologists, psychiatrists, and audiologists experienced in 
misophonia will be important in subsequent studies, especially in 
detecting comorbid disorders. Third, the age, educational status, 
and gender distribution of the individuals in the sample was not 
balanced. This may affect the generalizability of the results. Fourth, 
the target sample of this study was individuals from the normal 
population, but case–control studies including individuals 
clinically diagnosed with misophonia will contribute to a better 
understanding of the differences between individuals with 
misophonia and the normal population.

Frontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.orgConclusion
An increasing number of measurement tools have been developed 
for misophonia in recent years, and adapting these tools to different 
cultures is essential in providing a standard measurement for 
misophonia and revealing intercultural differences. In this study, the 
validity and reliability of the MisoQuest in Turkish was evaluated, and 
it was shown that the Turkish version of the questionnaire has good 
psychometric properties. Developing new measurement tools with 
good psychometric properties for the diagnosis of misophonia and 
ensuring cross-cultural adaptation of these tools will make significant 
contributions to the creation of a standardized diagnosis and 
treatment protocol for misophonia. We  believe that the Turkish 
version of MisoQuest will be  a useful measurement tool that can 
be used both as a screening tool in clinical practice and in misophonia 
research. To our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate the 
relationship between misophonia assessed with MisoQuest and 
anxiety symptoms and quality of life in the normal population. Our 
study found a significant relationship between the misophonia level 
assessed with MisoQuest and people’s state and trait anxiety levels and 
their quality of life.
