Hyperacusis is reduced tolerance
to everyday environmental
sounds, whereas misophonia is a
relatively unknown disorder in
which characterized by intense
and excessive emotional
responses to specific “trigger”
sounds. Few studies have
investigated ability of speech in
noise (SiN) and examined them
using auditory brainstem
responses (ABR)—which is used
to measure early auditory
processing and overall hearing
function in human listeners, in
particular for the sound sensitivity
disorders of misophonia and
hyperacusis. The primary aim of
this study was to investigate the
relationships between SiN
performance and ABR
components, specifically for
group differences. A total of 60
participants were categorized into
three groups: 13 with
misophonia, 12 with hyperacusis,
and 35 control group. Our
findings indicated that (1) the
misophonia group showed poor
speech in noise performance
than control and hyperacusis
groups at 20 and 5 SNR; (2) both
