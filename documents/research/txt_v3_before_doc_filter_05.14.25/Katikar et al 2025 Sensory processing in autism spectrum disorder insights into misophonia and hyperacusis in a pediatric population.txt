Objective: This study aims to investigate the prevalence of misophonia and hyperacusis in children with Autism 
Spectrum Disorder (ASD), focusing on gender differences and sensory processing challenges. The research further 
explores how these sensory sensitivities impact daily functioning and how they may differ across genders in a 
pediatric population.
Methods: A total of 60 children aged 2–12 years, diagnosed with ASD, intellectual disability, borderline intel-
lectual functioning, or co-occurring ADHD, participated in the study. Parental consent was obtained, and parents 
completed the Misophonia Impact and Hyperacusis Impact Questionnaires, which assess the presence and 
severity of sound sensitivities. Data analysis included frequency distributions and Spearman ’s rank correlation to 
examine potential associations between age and the severity of sensory symptoms.
Results: The study found that 45 % of participants exhibited misophonia, and 38 % showed signs of hyperacusis. 
A slightly higher prevalence of misophonia and hyperacusis was observed in female participants (50 % and 43 %, 
respectively) compared to males (43 % and 37 %, respectively). No significant correlation was found between the 
age of participants and the severity of misophonia (r 0.22, p F0.05) or hyperacusis (r 0.19, p F0.05).
Conclusions: Misophonia and hyperacusis are prevalent sensory challenges among children with ASD, with a 
slightly higher occurrence in females. These findings suggest that sensory sensitivities persist across develop -
mental stages and may be more pronounced in females. Early identification and gender-sensitive, sensory- 
focused interventions are critical for improving the quality of life and daily functioning of children with ASD. 
Future research should explore the underlying mechanisms of these sensory sensitivities to enhance intervention 
strategies across diverse populations.
1.Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental 
condition characterized primarily by social-communication challenges 
and restricted, repetitive behaviors, forming the core criteria for its 
diagnosis. Variations in intellectual and language abilities contribute to 
the diversity in ASD presentations [1,2]. Symptoms of ASD typically 
manifest before age 3 and persist throughout life, though severity may 
vary over time [3]. ASD affects individuals across multiple domains, 
impacting communication, reciprocal social interactions, and learning; 
these limitations are compounded by repetitive or stereotyped behaviors 
that vary widely among affected individuals [4,5].
While the exact causes of ASD remain elusive, multiple risk factors 
have been identified, including advanced paternal age, maternal health conditions (e.g., diabetes and thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy), 
and environmental exposures [6]. Genetic predisposition is also 
considered substantial, with recent research emphasizing the impor -
tance of gene-environment interactions in ASD development [7,8]. 
Additionally, emerging studies suggest that early-life environmental 
factors, such as excessive screen time between ages 1–2, may contribute 
to the risk or exacerbation of ASD symptoms [9,10]. The global preva -
lence of ASD is estimated at 1 in 100 children, making it a significant 
public health concern [11,12].
Atypical sensory processing is common in ASD, with many in-
dividuals exhibiting sensitivity to environmental stimuli, such as 
sounds. Recent studies indicate that 50–70 % of individuals with ASD 
experience decreased sound tolerance (DST), which can lead to 
considerable distress and functional impairment, manifesting in anxiety,

behavioral challenges, and difficulties in community participation, ed-
ucation, and employment [13,14]. This hypersensitivity is particularly 
relevant when exploring the link between ASD and misophonia, a con-
dition characterized by extreme discomfort in response to specific 
sounds. In a recent study, Ertürk et al. identified a correlation between 
the severity of misophonia symptoms and the presence of autistic traits, 
underscoring the potential overlap in sensory processing differences 
across these conditions [15,16].
Investigating the neurobiological mechanisms, developmental tra-
jectories, emotional and cognitive dimensions, and environmental trig-
gers associated with sensory sensitivities in ASD is essential. Such 
research will not only deepen our understanding of ASD but also inform 
effective, culturally sensitive interventions tailored to diverse pop-
ulations [17,18]. This study aims to examine the relationship between 
misophonia, hyperacusis, and ASD in Indian children aged 2–10 years 
and to compare these findings with data from Western populations. 
Understanding these cross-cultural presentations will provide valuable 
insights into the impact of cultural context on sensory sensitivities in 
ASD and guide intervention strategies globally [19,20].
2.Methods
This study included 60 participants diagnosed with Spoken Language 
Disorder secondary to Autism Spectrum Disorder (SLD 2•to ASD), ASD 
with Intellectual Disability (ID), ASD with Borderline Intellectual 
Functioning (BIF), and ASD with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Dis-
order (ADHD). Table 1provides a breakdown of these co-existing di-
agnoses. Of the 60 participants, 14 were female, and 46 were male, with 
an age range of 2–12 years (mean age 5.8 years).
The target population included children with ASD, those exhibiting 
significant autistic features, or those with an autism component in di-
agnoses involving ASD, ID, BIF, or ADHD. Parental consent was obtained 
for all participants prior to study commencement.
Parents completed two questionnaires: the Misophonia Impact 
Questionnaire (Parent version) and the Hyperacusis Impact Question -
naire (Parent version), developed by the Hashir International Specialist 
Clinics and Research Institute for Misophonia, Tinnitus, and Hyperacusis 
[21]. The Misophonia Impact Questionnaire assesses responses to dis-
liked sounds (e.g., cooker whistles, mixer grinders), including difficulty 
ignoring these sounds, disruptions to daily activities, and feelings of 
anxiety, anger, irritation, or low mood. It also queries whether the 
participant avoids family members who speak loudly. The Hyperacusis 
Impact Questionnaire assesses discomfort, anxiety, fatigue, low mood, 
and difficulty with daily activities due to loud sounds, as well as chal-
lenges in maintaining concentration. Both questionnaires are based on a 
4-point rating scale: 0–1 day (score 0), 2–6 days (score 1), 7–10 days 
(score 2), and 11–14 days (score 3), with each containing eight ques-
tions. Completion of both questionnaires took approximately 15 min.
3.Results
The results of the study showed that 27 out of 60 children showed 
presence of Misophonia. Out of 27, seven were females and 20 were 
males. This shows that 50 % (7 out of 14) female children and 43 % (20 out of 46) male children reported of Misophonia (Fig. 1). We also found 
that 23 out of 60 children showed presence of hyperacusis. Out of 23, six 
were females and 17 were males. 43 % (6 out of 14) female children and 
37 % (17 out of 46) reported of hyperacusis (Fig. 2). This supports that 
the prevalence of hyperacusis and misophonia was slightly more for 
female children with ASD compared to males.
Spearman ’s rank correlation was done to determine if there is any 
correlation between the age of the participants and the misophonia and 
hyperacusis scores. The results of the study also showed that there was 
no correlation between the age of the participants and the misophonia 
scores (r 0.22, p F0.05) and hyperacusis scores (r 0.19, p F0.05).
4.Discussion
The study results revealed that 45 % of children with Autism Spec-
trum Disorder (ASD) in the sample exhibited misophonia, while 38 % 
demonstrated hyperacusis. Demopoulos and Lewine [22] reported that 
37 % of participants with ASD had sound sensitivity in at least one ear. 
Danesh et al. [23] found that 69 % of individuals with Asperger ’s Syn-
drome reported hyperacusis. A meta-analysis by Williams et al. [24] 
estimated the current prevalence of hyperacusis in individuals with ASD 
to be 41.42 % which is similar to results obtained in our study. Williams 
et al. [25] examined the overlap between autistic traits and misophonia 
in adults and suggested that rates of autism might be elevated in in-
dividuals with misophonia. While specific prevalence percentages in 
children with ASD were not provided, the study highlights a notable 
association. Further targeted studies are needed to provide precise 
prevalence rates for misophonia in individuals with ASD, particularly 
among children.
It was found in the study that 50 % of female participants (7 out of 
14) and 43 % of male participants (20 out of 46) were affected by 
misophonia, suggesting a slightly higher prevalence in females with 
ASD. Similarly, hyperacusis was observed in 43 % of female participants 
and 37 % of males, indicating a marginally higher occurrence in females. 
This gender difference may reflect variations in sensory processing 
among children with ASD, as recent studies also report gender-based 
differences in sensory sensitivity and response patterns in ASD [19,26,
27].
Sensory processing challenges, including hyperacusis and misopho -
nia, are known to be prominent in children with ASD, impacting daily 
functioning and quality of life [24]. Such sensory sensitivities are linked 
to emotional distress, social withdrawal, and increased anxiety, making 
targeted support essential for improving daily experiences for affected 
children [28,29]. Studies indicate that sensory processing difficulties in 
ASD do not typically diminish over time but remain stable, as seen in the 
lack of correlation between participant age and the severity of miso-
phonia (r 0.22, p F0.05) or hyperacusis (r 0.19, p F0.05) in this 
study. This finding supports prior work demonstrating that sensory 
sensitivities persist across developmental stages in ASD [30,31].
The slightly higher prevalence of misophonia and hyperacusis 
among female participants is noteworthy. Emerging research suggests 
that females with ASD may experience greater sensory sensitivity than 
their male counterparts, which may exacerbate anxiety and affect social 
engagement, school participation, and functional outcomes [19,26]. 
Given these findings, early identification and intervention for sensory 
sensitivities in ASD, particularly for females, may offer substantial 
benefits.
Recent studies advocate for sensory-focused therapies, which have 
shown promise in managing sensitivities and promoting better social 
integration and emotional well-being [18,28]. Addressing these sensory 
needs through personalized therapy could reduce behavioral challenges 
and enhance engagement in daily activities. However, further research 
into the neurobiological underpinnings of sensory processing in ASD and 
gender-based response patterns is needed to guide more effective in-
terventions across diverse populations [27,29].Table 1

5.Conclusions
This study highlights the significant presence of sensory processing 
challenges, specifically misophonia and hyperacusis, among children 
with ASD. Nearly half of the children displayed misophonia, while over a 
third experienced hyperacusis, with a slightly higher prevalence 
observed in female participants. This finding suggests that girls with 
ASD may exhibit greater sensory sensitivity compared to boys.
The persistence of these sensory sensitivities, regardless of age, in-
dicates the need for ongoing support as children with ASD grow. 
Addressing these sensory challenges is crucial, as they can contribute to 
increased anxiety, social withdrawal, and difficulties with school and 
community engagement. Early identification and intervention for these 
sensitivities could improve daily functioning and overall quality of life.
Implementing sensory-focused therapies tailored to individual sen-
sory profiles may help alleviate the impact of sensory sensitivities on 
these children ’s lives. Future research should explore the underlying 
mechanisms of sensory processing in ASD and examine how cultural, 
environmental, and gender-related factors influence sensory responses. 
By developing targeted and culturally responsive interventions, it is 
possible to support better outcomes and enhance the well-being of individuals with ASD globally.
