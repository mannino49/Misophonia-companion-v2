Systems neuroscience ABSTRACT  
Flow is a cognitive state that manifests when there is complete attentional absorption while performing a task. 
Flow occurs when certain internal as well as external conditions are present, including intense concentration, a 
sense of control, feedback, and a balance between the challenge of the task and the relevant skillset. Phenom -
enologically, flow is accompanied by a loss of self-consciousness, seamless integration of action and awareness, 
and acute changes in time perception. Research has begun to uncover some of the neurophysiological correlates 
of flow, as well as some of the state ’s neuromodulatory processes. We comprehensively review this work and 
consider the neurodynamics of the onset of the state, considering large-scale brain networks, as well as dopa-
minergic, noradrenergic, and endocannabinoid systems. To accomplish this, we outline an evidence-based hy-
pothetical situation, and consider the flow state in a broader context including other profound alterations in 
consciousness, such as the psychedelic state and the state of traumatic stress that can induce PTSD. We present a 
broad theoretical framework which may motivate future testable hypotheses.   
1.Introduction 
Flow is an altered state of consciousness that is thought to occur 
when we are fully engaged in a relatively challenging task or activity 
that is matched to our skills. The phenomenon has been scientifically 
investigated for nearly fifty years, after first being elucidated by Mihaly 
Csikszentmihalyi in the 1970 s (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975 ), who studied 
the state from a psychological framework (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990 ). 
While researchers built upon this framework for nearly five decades, 
investigations into the state ’s underlying neurophysiology are relatively 
recent. Yet, it is known that flow is associated with specific alterations in 
brain activity, including changes in neural oscillation, 
neuro-modulatory processes, dynamic activations of specific brain re-
gions, as well as alterations in large-scale brain connectivity. 
Additionally, both cognitively and neurobiologically, the state of 
flow shares overlap with other altered states of consciousness, including 
meditative and psychedelic states, states of traumatic stress, and so- 
called peak or optimal experiences (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012, 2014; Brandmeyer et al., 2019; Wheeler and Dyer, 2020 ). While scientists have 
explored some of the neurobiological changes beneath the aforemen -
tioned altered states (Brewer et al., 2011; Nash et al., 2018; Yanes and 
Loprinzi, 2018 ), the precise neural mechanisms underpinning the onset 
of flow and the state itself remain unclear, both empirically and theo-
retically. In addition, a comprehensive theoretical account of flow ’s 
neural dynamics is missing from the literature, yet exists for other 
altered states (Preller et al., 2019; Girn et al., 2017; Travis, 2020 ). Thus, 
the current research leaves open many questions: How does the brain 
transition into a flow state? What is the temporal nature of this transi -
tion, including how long do the changes that facilitate state onset last, 
and what neural dynamical processes mark the transition into the state 
itself? From a neuroscientific perspective, how is flow distinct from, or 
similar to, other altered states of consciousness? 
In order to answer the aforementioned questions, we compare and 
contrast the neurobiological mechanisms for flow with other profound 
alterations in consciousness, including both psychedelic states and the 
traumatic stress that can produce Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

2(PTSD). We argue that this comparative approach is helpful when 
considering factors such as mood states, fear inhibition, emotional 
arousal, hyper-vigilance, and contextual cue processing. We propose a 
comprehensive empirical and theoretical account of the onset of flow. 
This account includes a number of clear and measurable brain signals 
that precede the onset of the state, and suggests that there is a large-scale 
brain network associated with flow. 
The goals of this paper are five-fold: First, we review current research 
on flow, laying the groundwork for a rigorous exploration of the flow’s 
neurobiology, including establishing the criteria that any viable expla -
nation of flow’s neural dynamics should meet. The purpose of this paper 
is to comprehensively draw upon the relevant literature in order to 
rigorously propose and justify a novel framework for the onset of flow, 
as well as establish an agenda for future flow research. Second, we 
outline a conceptual scenario where two fundamental outcomes can 
occur: the onset of flow, or the onset of traumatic stress that may lead to 
PTSD. Third, we propose a neural mechanism for the onset of flow that 
involves selected activation of a large-scale network and a set of brain 
regions with specific patterns of networked communication. Fourth, by 
drawing upon recent studies of the neural dynamics of the psychedelic 
state, we construct a proposal for the brain dynamics of flow, and further 
suggest that this proposal may yield a computational modeling 
approach. Fifth, given our comprehensive account of a possible flow 
network and its dynamics, we link flow’s neurobiology with its phe-
nomenology, then compare those dynamics with both trauma, and the 
psychedelic state. In doing so, we lay a foundation for generating new, 
testable hypotheses that can add to the empirical literature on the 
neurobiology of flow. 
Finally, given the complexity of the brain and the contextual inter-
action between the body and environment during flow, a comprehensive 
explanation of the neurobiology of flow onset must incorporate concepts 
from a number of neuroscientific domains, explained at multiple levels 
(Huskey et al., 2020). These include behavioral, theoretical, molecular 
and systems neuroscience. Thus, our proposal offers a first accounting of 
relevant mechanisms involved in flow: neurotransmitter systems, neural 
oscillation, and large-scale functional connectivity, and links each with 
the phenological characteristics of flow. 
2.An overview of flow research 
The formal study of flow began in the 1970 s, with Mihaly Csiks -
zentmihalyi’s systematic investigations. Csikszentmihalyi defined flow 
as “an optimal state of consciousness where we feel our best and perform 
our best” and discovered that flow is a universal phenomenon in 
humans, arising globally, independent of task, and regardless of class, 
culture, or creed (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). 
Additionally, Csikszentmihalyi identified six phenomenological 
characteristics that are commonly present during flow: Hyper-focused, 
task-specific attention; the merger of action-and-awareness leading to 
total absorption in task-engagement; the diminishment of self-reflective 
cognition and awareness of bodily processes; an altered perception of 
time; a heightened level of task-performance accompanied by a feeling 
of complete control; and significant positive affect, including high levels 
of intrinsic reward, enjoyment, pleasure, euphoria and, often, increased 
feelings of meaning and purpose. Psychometrically, these six charac -
teristics have become the way researchers both define and measure flow. 
Whether these characteristics are necessary as well as sufficient condi -
tions for the experience of flow remains an open question. In fact, to our 
knowledge, no research into the neurobiological mechanisms involved 
in flow have confirmed the presence of all six characteristics. What has 
been shown is that the intensity of each characteristic helps researchers 
determine where an experience sits on the spectrum between micro- 
flow, a low intensity flow experience, or macro-flow, a high intensity 
flow experience (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975; Csikszentmihalyi and Naka -
mura, 2002; Engeser, 2012). While this research is based on 
self-reported subjective assessments, it appears to be largely consistent as a categorization of the “spectrum” of flow experiences. 
More broadly, flow is an altered state of consciousness (Dietrich, 
2004; Csikszentmihalyi and Nakamura, 2014; Lee et al., 2016). Altered 
states of consciousness (Wittmann, 2018) are characterized as signifi -
cant deviations from normal waking states of consciousness. For 
instance, flow has been shown to be associated with phenomena found 
in other altered states, including disassociation, the feeling of oneness 
with everything, and out-of-body experiences (for disassociation, 
Wanner et al., 2006; for oneness, see: Newberg et al., 2001; Tsaur et al., 
2013; Yaden et al., 2017; Kotler, 2006, 2013; for out of body experi -
ences, see: Kotler, 2006). 
Several excellent recent systematic and scoping reviews have been 
published on flow, which address psychology, physiology, and neuro -
biology, for both individual as well as group flow, including van der 
Linden et al. (2021), Knierim et al. (2018), Khoshnoud et al. (2020), 
Kryston et al. (2018), Fisher et al. (2021), Weber et al., (2016, 2020), 
Gold and Ciorciari, 2020; Pels et al., 2018, and Peifer et al. (2022). Our 
review and proposal draws on this existing work and extends it in two novel 
ways. First, we elucidate the underlying neural dynamics of flow, in 
terms of network and coordination dynamics, something which has not 
been previously discussed. And second, also for the first time, we discuss 
the neural dynamics of flow in the context of the dynamics of trauma, 
and the psychedelic state. 
Any viable explanation of flow’s underlying neurobiology needs to 
satisfy several criteria. First, it must account for the altered state of 
consciousness that characterizes flow. Second, it must link flow’s 
phenomenological characteristics with neurobiological processes. 
Finally, any viable explanation of flow’s underlying neurobiology and 
neural dynamics must consider both prior research and satisfy an 
additional number of explanatory requirements, including flow’s widely 
documented impact on performance and the currently theorized “flow 
triggers,” the pre-conditions that have been proposed to produce, or at 
very least, be correlated with, flow. Although the literature on flow is 
becoming extensive, the neurobiology underlying the concept and its 
antecedent causes, much like hypnosis (Landry et al., 2017), are not yet 
fully explained. Flow neuroscience faces many of the same challenges 
that face the general scientific study of consciousness, creating a unified 
objective theory of subjective experience (Seth and Bayne, 2022). 
Nevertheless, the fact that flow and its well-documented effects can be 
successfully investigated from a psychological and phenomenological 
perspective (Melnikoff et al., 2022) suggests an optimistic outlook for 
the neurobiological elucidation of flow. In what follows, we briefly 
outline currently theorized flow triggers, their possible causal role, and 
the resulting performance enhancements associated with flow. 
2.1. The Functionality of Flow’s Triggers 
Previous theorizing argues that several “triggers” are causally linked 
with individual and group flow (Sawyer, 2017; Csikszentmihalyi and 
Nakamura, 2002; and for a full overview, see Kotler, 2021). As this 
paper concerns individual flow, it is only the individual flow triggers 
that are discussed herein. These triggers include: (a) clear goals, im-
mediate feedback and the challenge/skills balance where both the task’s 
challenge and an individual’s skills are high (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990; 
Csikszentmihalyi and LeFevre, 1989, 2012; Nakamura and Csikszent -
mihalyi, 2005), (b) novelty, complexity, unpredictability, and insight 
(Kotler, 2006, 2021; Teng, 2011), (c) risk (Martin and Priest, 1986; 
Celsi, 1993; Kotler, 2013; Schüler and Nakamura, 2013), (d) deep 
embodiment or the hyper-awareness of cross sensory modalities 
(Csikszentmihalyi, 1990; Chavez, 2008; Jaque et al., 2020), major 
intrinsic motivators such as curiosity, autonomy, passion, purpose and 
mastery (Bakker and Geurts, 2004; Quinn, 2005; Salanova et al., 2006; 
Kotler, 2021). Additionally, while this idea remains speculative, some 
researchers have argued that flow triggers operate via independent yet 
often overlapping mechanisms that govern the allocation of attention to 
the task-at-hand: the activation of dopaminergic and/or noradrenergic S. Kotler et al.

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 143 (2022) 104956
3pathways and/or the perceived low-levels of cognitive load, even when 
objective measures show otherwise (Harris et al., 2017a, 2017b; Kotler, 
2021 ). 
2.2. A hypothetical situation: flow versus PTSD 
In order to examine the neurobiological processes that may occur 
during the onset of flow, consider the following hypothetical situation: A 
highly skilled motorcycle rider is speeding down the freeway and sud-
denly gets cut off by a car (the “event ”). While other mental states are 
possible (mind-wandering, for example), assume that pre-event, the 
motorcyclist is actively engaged in the task of driving down the freeway, 
with concurrent increases in focus and alertness. Next, to avoid collision, 
the motorcyclist has an immediate response, swerving around the 
offending car. Now consider two possible and frequently reported out-
comes of high-risk situations, each with their own distinct yet over-
lapping psychological characteristics. 
In one possible outcome, the motorcycle rider starts to swerve, 
rapidly transitions into flow and skillfully avoids the car. The motor -
cyclist draws upon prior experience and skills and performs a series of 
perfectly timed motor actions with a high level of task proficiency. More 
specifically, the situation elicits the flow ’s theorized triggers and should 
be associated with psychological characteristics that are present during 
the experience, including complete concentration on the task-at-hand, 
the merger of action and awareness, an altered sense of time (dilation 
or acceleration), a diminishment in sense of self, a heightened sense of 
control over the situation, and a post-event increase in positive affect 
and mood. 
Alternatively, the motorcycle rider starts to swerve, feels a sense of 
overwhelm and panic, yet manages to maneuver around the car and 
avoid an accident. In this case, the motorcyclist is likely to experience 
traumatic stress, including heightened anxiety, feelings of terror and 
powerlessness, and a post-event increase in negative affect, hyper- 
vigilance and the distinct possibility of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 
(PTSD). In order to motivate a discussion concerning the transition into 
a flow state, we emphasize that, in this situation and before the event 
takes place, the driver is not yet in flow; rather in a state of appropriate 
arousal and alertness (and valence). The transition into flow may occur 
when an event takes place that could potentially lead to flow —that is, an 
event with a confluence of flow triggers. 
While these scenarios are not the event ’s only possible psychological 
outcomes, both are frequently reported phenomena in high-risk situa-
tions, including those found in adventure activities, sports and combat 
(for flow, see: Allen-Collinson et al., 2018; Jackson, 1992 , for trauma, 
see: Ozer et al., 2003; Van der Kolk and Van der Hart, 1989) . We also 
note that the comparison between flow and the precursors of PTSD in 
this hypothetical situation may generalize most readily to high-risk 
situations. Admittedly, not all flow experiences are high-risk (e.g., aca-
demic achievement, work productivity, media use, artistry, mental 
health). Nevertheless, we emphasize that this particular hypothetical 
situation is useful in that it allows for a broader theoretical investigation 
concerning flow experiences and an opportunity to consider their rela-
tion to PTSD and the psychedelic state. Moreover, we expect the same 
sequence of neurobiological events should result in flow for both high- 
and low-risk circumstances. Therefore, we pose this hypothetical situ-
ation to underscore a crucial question: What precise alterations in brain 
function and neural dynamics distinguish these two outcomes, either the 
transition into flow or the transition into traumatic stress? 
Consider that, neurobiologically, the pre-flow/pre-trauma initial 
conditions are identical. The motorcyclist is experiencing heightened 
focus and alertness, reflecting increased activity in large scale brain 
networks, including executive attention, salience, motor action planning 
and execution. Next, as the “event ” begins, the motorcyclist is cut off by 
the car. Neurobiologically, this produces an immediate increase in ac-
tivity in the brain ’s salience network (SN), which is charged with the 
detection of novel and relevant stimuli (Menon and Uddin, 2010; Weber and Fisher, 2020 ). Whether the motorcyclist ’s experience becomes 
ecstatic (flow) or traumatic is likely to depend on what happens next. If 
the experience is overwhelming, terrifying, or there are physical or 
mental constraints that inhibit the execution of action plans, then the 
swerve is likely to result in traumatic stress. However, if flow ’s triggers 
are present, then we theorize that this should result in a sequence of 
neural responses that elicit flow, and the corresponding psychological, 
phenomenological, and behavioral responses. 
This emphasis on “action ” is particularly important to our discussion. 
In the literature surrounding both flow and PTSD, action or the inability 
to act consistently plays a crucial role. “Flow is triggered during a task, 
thereby implying motor execution ” (Michailidis et al., 2018 ). Addi-
tionally, in flow, this action has two phenomenological qualities: 
effortlessness and empowerment. Effortlessness implies automatic pro-
cessing (Dietrich and Stoll, 2010 ), while empowerment refers to one of 
the flow ’s core psychological characteristics: a “sense of control. ” 
Moreover, the “inability to act” is one of the causal factors involved in 
PTSD (Van der Kolk and Van der Hart, 1989 ) and learned helplessness 
(Miller and Norman, 1979; Seligman, 1972 ). This suggests that the 
heightened sense of control in flow may be the opposite of learned 
helplessness or what could be termed “learned powerfulness, ” and 
considered as a possible pre-condition for resiliency and post-traumatic 
growth, a term coined by Tedeschi and Calhoun (2004) to describe 
“positive psychological change experienced as a result of the struggle 
with highly challenging life circumstances ”. 
Similarly, researchers have found that many of flow ’s performance 
benefits, including increases in well-being, meaning, empathy, motiva -
tion, grit, and environmental awareness are also characteristic of post- 
traumatic growth (Jayawickreme et al., 2022; Maitlis, 2020; Tedeschi 
and Calhoun, 2004; Waters et al., 2022 ). This overlap in performance 
benefits suggests that flow and post-traumatic growth may share un-
derlying neurobiological mechanisms , an idea that aligns with Selye ’s 
(1956) division between eustress (beneficial stress) and distress 
(harmful stress) and lends additional support to our comparison of flow 
and trauma (for linkages between flow and eustress, see Hargrove et al., 
2013 ). 
As a way to explore these changes, we examine the event temporally, 
breaking the incident into nine “sequence-coded ” sections —starting 
with T 0, the moment before the rider is cut off in traffic, and pro-
ceeding to T 9, the post-event moment when the rider drives down the 
freeway in either flow or traumatic stress —and detail the precise 
neurobiological changes that underpin each step in the sequence. This 
framework both allows us to see when, where and why the experiences 
of flow and trauma overlap then diverge, while further serving to 
elucidate flow ’s phenomenology, its performance benefits and the 
functionality of known flow triggers. 
2.3. T 0: Pre-Flow Events 
The specific neurobiological pre-conditions that elicit flow comprise 
a vast state space. Nevertheless, people get into flow doing all sorts of 
tasks, suggesting that the exact details of pre-event neurobiology are less 
important than the increase in salience that marks the onset of the event. 
Therefore, we maintain our motorcycle hypothetical situation. At the 
start of the event, our motorcyclist is speeding down the freeway in a 
state of alert focus. Neurobiologically, the executive attention network 
(EAN) is engaged, as this network has been shown to facilitate attention 
while driving (Ball et al., 1993; Clay et al., 2005 ), including when 
drivers experience a sudden road hazard then drive away safely, which 
accurately describes our hypothetical situation (Åkerstedt et al., 2005 ). 
At T 0, an “unexpected stimulus ” arrives, requiring amplification 
in SN connectivity (Seeley et al., 2007 , Menon and Uddin, 2010 ; Srid-
haran et al., 2008 ). This is significant because the SN has been theorized 
to be involved in facilitating shifts into flow (Huskey et al., 2018, 2021 ; 
Weber and Fisher, 2020 ). Moreover, the SN is involved in the initiation 
of cognitive control (Botvinick et al., 2004 ), the coordination of S. Kotler et al.

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 143 (2022) 104956
4behavioral responses (Medford and Critchley, 2010 ) and the mainte -
nance and implementation of task-sets —(Nelson et al., 2010 ) a term 
that describes the configuration of cognitive processes that are actively 
maintained for subsequent task performance (for a review, see Sakai, 
2008) . Once that unexpected stimulus is detected, the key SN regions 
that are active in both our flow and trauma scenarios likely include the 
dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), the anterior right insula (aRI), 
the presupplementary motor area (PSA), amygdala, ventral striatum and 
ventral tegmental area (VTA). 
The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is an important cognitive 
control structure (Holroyd et al., 2004 ) and is likely involved in 
detecting the unexpected stimulus (the car), as the dACC is associated 
with conflict detection and error identification (Carter and Van Veen, 
2007 ; for review: Falkenstein et al., 2000) . In conflict detection, the ACC 
monitors attentional conflicts to signal whenever additional resources 
are required. In predictive-coding, a series of reciprocal connections 
between the ACC and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are involved 
in the prediction and processing of error messages (Alexander and 
Brown, 2019 ). In addition, the aRI may be involved, as this region is also 
active during performance monitoring and error processing (Ullsperger 
et al., 2010 ). In this scenario, the aRI initiates the process, acting as a 
“cortical outflow hub” that coordinates activity changes across multiple 
brain networks in response to error detection (Chang et al., 2013, 2012 ). 
Beyond the dACC and aRI, there are three additional regions of in-
terest. The presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) facilitates the se-
lection of action plans and the suppression of conflicting action plans 
(Nachev, 2007 ), allowing the motorcyclist to decide to, say, swerve left 
instead of right. The amygdala plays, among other things, a role in threat 
detection (Ohman, 2005 ; Phelps and LeDoux, 2005 ), responding to 
novel events in the environment, though it is especially sensitive to 
novel dangers —like the motorcyclist being cut off by that car. Finally, 
the dopaminergic regions including the ventral striatum and the ventral 
tegmental area are involved in motivation, reward and the reinforce -
ment of behavior (Beier et al., 2015 ), including unpredictable, high-risk 
behaviors such as swerving a motorcycle in traffic. 
2.4. T 1: Error Signaling 
Moving forward in our sequence, once the salience network detects a 
perceptual change, the brain generates an error signal that helps lock 
attention on target. This requires many of the regions involved in the 
orienting of attention to a perceptual event, including the posterior 
parietal cortex, as well as the frontal and subcortical control systems of 
spatial attention (Husain and Rorden, 2003; Mesulam, 1999 ). Addi-
tionally, the dACC remains active, as this region is partially responsible 
for reorienting. 
It is likely that there is an event-related potential (ERP) associated 
with this error detection. Based on the relevant literature, candidates 
include an error-relative negativity signal appearing 80–100 ms after the 
stimulus (Muzammel et al., 2018 ) or the N200, a negative deflection 
appearing 200 ms after the stimulus reflecting either conscious attention 
or an unexpected stimulus or both (Muzammel et al., 2018; Patel and 
Azzam, 2005 ). Relatedly, Grahek et al. (2022) have shown that the P3b 
(a signature of prediction error updating) tracks perceived efficacy at 
achieving rewards. In short, there is a stronger P3b response when 
people update from a low-efficacy of achieving a reward to a 
high-efficacy prediction. Together, these error signals may help guide 
the allocation of selective attention and control necessary for experi -
encing flow. 
2.5. T 2: selective attention 
At this stage in our scenario, the motorcyclist recognizes the car and 
its potential danger. A central, but still somewhat unanswered question 
is how the brain, in a high-risk situation, is able to appropriately filter 
out an enormous amount of incoming information in order to perform the correct action and make adaptive decisions. This neurobiological 
filtering phenomenon is known as sensory gating (Jones et al., 2016 ; 
Zabelina et al., 2015 ), and is a core component of cognitive control 
wherein prepotent stimuli are downregulated to facilitate flexible and 
adaptive pursuit of a specific goal (Cole et al., 2013; Miller and Cohen, 
2001 ). 
This process functions as an attentional regulation mechanism and 
appears involved in the transition into both flow and PTSD. Importantly, 
recent research in mice has shown that executive attention —as related 
to sensory gating —rather than acting as spotlight, is actually regulated 
by inhibition, similar to a filtering process (Wimmer et al., 2015 ). In this 
process, the thalamus serves as a bottom-up relay hub, communicating 
selected information to large areas within the cortex, including the 
attentional system in the prefrontal cortex. This process is heavily 
influenced by motivation and reward processing, which guide control 
deployment (Botvinick and Braver, 2014 ). 
Yet this is not solely a bottom-up process, as Wimmer et al. (2015) 
found a top-down feedback loop wherein changes in PFC activity inhibit 
sensory components of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Thus, the 
PFC regulates thalamic activity by allowing relevant information to be 
processed, while suppressing irrelevant information via various sub-
networks. In follow up research, Nakajima et al. (2019) , discovered that 
the relevant inhibitory pathway extends from the PFC to basal ganglia 
(BG) to TRN. 
In the PFC-BG-TRN pathway, the BG inhibits distracting and irrele -
vant information, while enhancing appropriate cues. In our motorcyclist 
example, it is likely that the driver experiences the dampening of 
auditory information in favor of the highlighting of visual information, a 
commonly reported phenomenon in high-risk situations (Parr and Fris-
ton, 2018; Kotler, 2013 ). This is a form of goal-directed sensory filtering 
that impacts attention and, via additional BG connections, motor per-
formance. This also means that cognition is intimately tied to action and 
further underscores the “ability to act” versus the "inability to act” as a 
key differentiator between experience outcomes (flow or PTSD). Addi-
tionally, during threat recognition, two other processes involving the BG 
are important to this discussion: the phasic response in dopamine (DA), 
signaling a reward-prediction error (Schultz, 2016 ; see T 3 for further 
discussion), and the inhibition of impulsive behaviors (see below). 
On the flow side of our motorcyclist scenario, the selection of 
appropriate motor plans must correlate with a specific neurobiological 
mechanism, with the subthalamic nucleus (STN) the likely candidate. 
Ballanger et al. (2009) found that stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus 
(STN), via connections with the motor cortex, increases impulsive 
behavior during high-conflict decision making, while an opposing 
“proactive inhibition ” response (braking, in the motorcyclist ’s scenario) 
hinders performance in high-risk situations that demand an immediate 
motor response. The authors appropriately refer to this model as 
“release your horses. ” 
2.6. T 3: task engagement verses disengagement 
Concurrent with events described in T 2, core neuromodulatory 
processes are likely engaged as the motorcyclist ’s reorienting response 
activates noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways as well as the 
endocannabinoid system (ECS) in order to enhance executive attention, 
motor response and reward. We will address these systems individually. 
As a core hub in the salience network, the dACC helps focus attention 
on a single target by triggering the release of norepinephrine from the 
locus coeruleus (LC), the brainstem nucleus responsible for most of the 
brain ’s norepinephrine (Seeley et al., 2007; Berridge and Waterhouse, 
2003; Mather et al., 2016; Ventura et al., 2008; Menon and Uddin, 
2010 ). Connections running between the LC and the amygdala and be-
tween the LC and the PFC are centrally involved in fear processing, 
attention switching, task-engagement, and increased learning (Corbetta 
and Shulman, 2002 ). Further connections run between the LC and the 
motor cortex (M1) that extend to our facial muscles and eyes (Ferrucci S. Kotler et al.

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 143 (2022) 104956
5et al., 2013 ). This could explain why changes in facial expression have 
been repeatedly correlated with flow and trauma (for flow: de Manzano 
et al., 2010 ; for trauma: Garrett et al., 2012 ). 
In the amygdala, the arrival of NE begins the process of threat 
assessment (Gu et al., 2019;LeDoux, 2015 ). It appears that NE arrives 
first in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which is both critical for forming 
stimulus outcome value representations (Pizzagalli et al., 2011 ), and as 
an adaptive response that primes learning. As both flow and trauma 
result in rapid learning, the presence of NE in the BLA might help explain 
this phenomenon. 
In the PFC, NE increases signal-to-noise ratios in cortical networks 
(Xing et al., 2016 ) and triggers many of the top-down processes asso-
ciated with executive attention. NE projections in the PFC are 
well-distributed but are particularly active in the medial prefrontal 
cortex (mPFC). While the amygdala-LC pathway is critical for creating 
aversive memories, the LC-mPFC pathway is crucial to extinguishing 
aversive memories, suggesting that this is an important division between 
flow and PTSD. Additionally, pharmacological targeting of the LC-NE 
pathways in both the amygdala and mPFC has provided symptomatic 
relief for people suffering from PTSD (Taylor et al., 2008 ). 
In high-risk situations such as our motorcyclist ’s, NE is also involved 
in decreasing and suppressing working memory in favor of flexible 
attention (Berridge and Spencer, 2016 ). In times of stress, Snyder et al. 
(2012) have shown that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) acts as a 
neurotransmitter in the LC, shifting discharge from phasic to tonic in 
order to promote behavioral flexibility. As there are bidirectional con-
nections between the LC and mPFC and orbital frontal cortex (OFC), this 
shift from phasic to tonic carries information up to the PFC (Berridge and 
Waterhouse, 2003 ). According to Adaptive-Gain Theory (Aston-Jones 
and Cohen, 2005 ), this shift reflects a change from the exploitation of a 
known strategy for producing behavioral outcomes (a phasic process) to 
an exploration of a novel strategy for new and potentially preferential 
outcomes (a tonic process). 
Inversely, Sadacca et al. (2017) has shown that depletion of tonic NE 
in the OFC and, possibly, the mPFC, can result in a lack of attentional 
flexibility —which could help explain why experiences become either 
trauma or flow. Based on this evidence, we suggest that, if the motor -
cyclist does not have enough tonic NE in their system, they may not have 
enough attentional flexibility to solve the swerve problem, resulting in 
traumatic stress. Further evidence for this can be found in the fMRI work 
of Naegeli et al. (2018) who found PTSD patients have exaggerated 
behavioral and autonomic responses to loud sounds, suggesting sensi-
tized phasic responses of LC neurons (for a review of NE-LC-PTSD 
research, see: Borodovitsyna et al., 2018) . 
Another line of evidence for the causal role of the LC-NE system in 
attentional control, particularly goal-directed attention and impulse 
control, comes from Bari et al. (2020) . Using optogenetics, the authors 
demonstrate that the LC targets two different areas of the PFC, the 
dorsal-medial PFC (dmPFC), known to be involved in enhancing focus 
and performance, and the ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex (vlOFC), 
known to be involved in impulse reduction, with each area acting 
independently, yet synergistically, via ascending efferent connections 
from the LC (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002 ). In mice, separately stimu -
lating the LC-NE pathways to the dmPFC and the vlOFC produces two 
distinct behavioral outcomes, either improved correct performance or 
impulse control, respectively. Moreover, the LC-NE system also acts as 
global modulator for arousal in response to a threat or stressor (Morris 
et al., 2020 ), which further emphasizes this systems role in the motor -
cyclist scenario. The LC-NE system has been theorized to play an 
important role in flow, particularly task engagement verses disengage -
ment (van der Linden et al., 2021 ). Taken together, the LC-NE system 
responds to threats during high-stakes situations, regulates the decision 
to engage or disengage a task, and modulates two distinct attentional 
pathways, one involved in reducing distracting information and the 
other in reducing impulsive behaviors. 
Interestingly, researchers have also found that both flow and traumatic stress are associated with out-of-body experiences (Blanke 
and Thut, 2007; Rabeyron and Caussie, 2016 ; Kotler, 2006 ), a phe-
nomenon that might be partially explained by NE activity in the tem-
poral parietal junction. In the TPJ, NE is normally linked to failure 
tracking, but the region (and especially the right TPJ) is also important 
in empathy, perspective-taking and out-of-body experiences (Sha-
may-Tsoory et al., 2005 ; Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003 ; Blanke and Arzy, 
2005 ). This suggests that an out of body experience might be a 
NE-triggered radical form of perspective-taking that arises early in 
perceived crisis situations, arguably during the pre-action plan selection 
phase, perhaps to aid in that selection. 
When the brain detects a salient signal, there is also activity in the 
mesocorticolimbic dopamine system anchored by the ventral tegmental 
area (VTA). The VTA provides signals related to novelty, error and 
reward, yet there is growing evidence that there are two different kinds 
of DA neurons and that each responds to a specific kind of “reward ” 
(Bromberg-Martin, 2010 ). The first are value-coding neurons that are 
activated by unexpected rewarding events and inhibited by unexpected 
aversive events. These value-coding neurons are found in the substantia 
nigra (SN) and the VTA, while their projections end in the NAcc shell, 
dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen) and vmPFC (Schultz, 2007 ). 
The second class of DA neurons are saliency-coding neurons that 
originate in the substantia nigra and VTA and project to the NAcc core, 
dorsal striatum, and dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC). In both classes of DA 
neurons in the VTA, activity is both phasic and tonic and relates to both 
expectation of reward and errors in reward prediction (Schultz, 2016 ). 
Additionally, DeYoung (2013) proposed these saliency-neurons are 
activated by the incentive value of new information; while Di Domenico 
and Ryan (2017) argue that these neurons alone could underpin intrinsic 
motivation —two ideas that are relevant to flow ’s phenomenological 
characteristics and impact on performance. 
Yet, in our motorcycle example, the value-coding DA neurons are 
activated first, as the unexpected aversive event —the car’s arrival in the 
motorcyclist ’s visual field —would produce a reward prediction error 
and a phasic decline in DA activity (Schultz, 2016 ). This may be the 
original error signal that starts the entire flow or trauma process (dis-
cussed in T 1). However, this phasic DA decline must be brief, as flow 
has been consistently linked to heightened dopaminergic activity (Berns, 
2005; Weber et al., 2009 ). Moreover, DA-producing experiences such as 
risk, unpredictability, complexity, novelty, and insight, appear to pre-
cipitate flow (Kotler, 2006, 2021 ). Finally, flow-proneness is associated 
with availability of D2 receptors in the dorsal striatum (de Manzano 
et al., 2013 ) and increased dorsal striatum gray matter volume (Kavous 
et al., 2019 ). 
At this step in the sequence, the phenomenology of time perception 
comes into play. In crisis situations, both anecdotal and empirical evi-
dence (Kotler, 2013 ) show that time appears to slow down or speed up 
very early in high-risk situations. Similarly, Arstila (2012) argues that 
this effect occurs due to a distortion of the relation between the temporal 
properties of the external world and the internal state. Dopamine may be 
responsible for this change in temporal phenomenology, as it is the main 
neurotransmitter involved in time processing (Lustig and Meck, 2005; 
Meck, 1996 ). Dopamine agonists tend to speed up time perception, 
whereas dopamine antagonists slow it down. In our motorcycle 
example, the initial reward detection error would likely produce a 
phasic decline in DA that would slow the rider ’s perception of time. 
Additionally, Roseboom (2019) correlated the experience of time dila-
tion to the number of salient events which take place during a particular 
scanning period. The greater the number of salient events, the longer the 
current moment seems to last. In other words, the activation of the 
motorcyclist ’s salience network could begin the process of time elon-
gation, while the presence of dopamine could extend and/or deepen the 
phenomenon. Importantly, these processes provide a mechanism for 
time dilation that arises very early in the motorcyclist ’s experience 
without requiring the localized deactivation of the medial PFC (see T 8 
for full discussion). S. Kotler et al.

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 143 (2022) 104956
6A significant body of research shows the endocannabinoid system 
(ECS) is a regulator of anxiety and stress (for a review, see Hillard, 
2018 ), and thus implicated in our motorcyclist ’s response to the event. 
In a wide variety of situations, the introduction of an acute stressor —the 
car, in our example —evokes bidirectional changes in the two main 
molecules produced by the ECS: anandamide (AEA) and 2-archidonoly 
glycerol (2-AG). These molecules are synthesized on-demand in post-
synaptic membranes that feed back into presynaptic terminals (Kano 
et al., 2009 ), where they bind to canabiniond recepters (CB) receptors 
and serve a significant neuromodulatory function. Within the brain, CB 
receptors are found on GABAergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic, norad -
renergic and dopaminergic terminals —a list that includes many of the 
neurochemicals directly implicated in both flow and trauma, suggesting 
that the ECS may be something of a master neuromodulator of these 
experiences. 
In the amygdala (see T 4 for further review), where the threat 
response is processed, CB receptors are primarily found in the baso-
lateral amygdala (BLA), but also in the central nucleus. When these 
receptors are inhibited, there is a decline in anandamide (AEA) in the 
amygdala that contributes to the stress response by activating the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and increasing anxiety. 
Additionally, increases in 2-AG, the other major molecule produced by 
the ECS, contribute to the termination and adaptation of the HPA 
axis—that is, the end of the threat response —and potentially contribute 
to pain perception, memory and synaptic plasticity (Gray, 2015 ). In 
total, a decline in ECS activity is associated with anxiety and traumatic 
stress, while (as we will see below) an increase in ECS activity may 
prevent traumatic stress and enhance correct task-performance and 
attention, two key components of the flow experience. 
2.7. T 4: threat assessment 
In this sequence, the neurobiological changes described in T 
0 through T 3 reflect the motorcyclist ’s detection of an aversive and 
unexpected stimulus. Here, in T 4, the motorcyclist ’s brain performs 
threat assessments and begins the process of action plan selection. We 
examine these details by focusing on key neuronal regions that are 
directly implicated in both neurobiological studies of flow and trauma, 
and by events necessitated by our motorcyclist ’s scenario —the activa -
tion of the salience network by an unexpected stimulus, for example. 
In the brain, sensory information about the external environ -
ment —such as the sudden appearance of a car in our motorcyclist ’s 
visual field —is processed by a pulvino-cortical loop that regulates se-
lective attention (Saalmann et al., 2012 ) and then relayed to the 
amygdala through a network of corticothalamic afferents. The amygdala 
handles preconscious threat detection, emotional valence and, via 
near-constant bidirectional signaling with the mPFC and the hippo -
campus, associations with prior experience (Bishop, 2009; Hermans 
et al., 2014 ). Bidirectional links between the central amygdala, brain -
stem and hypothalamus are responsible for mounting fear responses 
(Adolphs, 2013 ). In our scenario, in both the flow and trauma condi -
tions, amygdala activity is likely, as the car represents a dire and im-
mediate threat that produces a fear response. 
In this fear response, sensory information is funneled into the basal 
and basomedial cell groups, and the central nucleus of the amygdala 
(Janak and Tye, 2015 ). The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is implicated in 
survival-oriented behaviors such as freezing, fleeing, foraging, and 
(possibly) fighting, and forms a circuit with the centrolateral amygdala, 
(CLA) which is a critical structure for fear memory formation and stor-
age (Penzo et al., 2015 ). In mice, Hartley et al. (2019) found the central 
amygdala (CeA) is also involved in fear creation and extinction. CeA 
neurons express corticotropin-release neuropeptide CRF, which re-
duces conditioned freezing responses, impairs fear memory acquisition, 
facilitates within-activity fear extinction, and is necessary for extinction 
memory retrieval. Meanwhile, activity in corticotropin-release CRF- 
neurons produces fear-based memories. These facts are relevant for two reasons. First, in order to facilitate 
the swerve action plan, the motorcyclist had to inhibit automatic 
braking responses, a function of CRFactivity. Second, the autotelic 
nature of flow suggests within-activity fear extinction and post-event 
fear extinction, both functions of CRF. This second argument is 
crucial as no averse affective memory responses have been associated 
with flow, yet the state frequently arises in high-risk situations that 
would normally produce them (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990 ; Celsi, 1993 ; 
Kotler, 2013 ). 
Additionally, the endocannabinoid system (ESC) also plays a role in 
threat assessment, as it can both inhibit or excite CRH response. More 
specifically, there are both tonic and phasic ECS reactions to stress. In 
the brain, higher tonic levels of AEA regulate stress and anxiety and play 
a role in the prevention of PTSD (Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013; Mayo et al., 
2022 ). AEA is also the tonic signal of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis 
(HPA), which is partially responsible for mounting the stress response. 
Under steady-state conditions, Morena et al. (2015) argued that this AEA 
tone exists in the BLA, where it inhibits the HPA under non-stressful 
conditions, and activates it under stress. Interestingly, the ECS system 
is also active in the hippocampus and the mPFC, both regions critical for 
fear-based associative processing, and over large portions of the PFC in 
general, including most of the regions active in threat processing, 
action-plan selection, and the creation or extinction of fear-based 
memories. In total, mounting evidence suggests that the ECS plays a 
significant neuromodulatory role in both the onset of flow and the onset 
of trauma. 
During threat assessment, information is also passed to the prefrontal 
cortex for top-down evaluation (for a review, see Sussman et al., 2016 ). 
A network involving the temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), the orbital 
frontal cortex (OFC) and ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) helps 
reorient attention to salient stimuli and is particularly sensitive to un-
expected events (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002 ). Beyond these structures, 
it appears that the specific prefrontal regions activated during threat 
evaluation will differ depending on the situation, past knowledge, and 
prior experience. In the flow literature, critical factors that help establish 
the challenge-skills balance such as tolerance for anxiety, ability to delay 
gratification, confidence, and optimism, are influential at this stage, and 
likely determine the exact pattern of prefrontal activity. Yet there are a 
few areas in the PFC that deserve particular scrutiny for their relevance 
to our scenario. 
In the motorcyclist example, in both flow and trauma, the appear -
ance of an unexpected stimulus makes OFC activity likely. The OFC is 
considered part of the vmPFC (discussed in greater detail below) and has 
been implicated in both emotion and emotion-related learning, and is 
part of the ventral network that reorients attention to salient stimuli and 
emotional events (Thorpe, 1992 ; Hartikainen et al., 2012; O’Doherty 
et al., 2001; Rule et al., 2002 ). Yet, there are important OFC divisions. In 
amygdala-generated fear responses, both the medial OFC and the 
ventromedial PFC (see below) are implicated in fear extinction and 
reward-processing, while the anterolateral OFC signals the absence of a 
reward and presence of certain negative stimuli (Milad and Rauch, 
2007 ). In trauma studies, anterolateral OFC dysfunction has been 
implicated in PTSD. 
Relatedly, the vmPFC has bidirectional connection to the amygdala 
and is involved in threat assessment and response, reward-processing, 
and decision-making —all tasks that are required at this stage of the 
event (Botvinick et al., 2001; Fellows, 2007; Rolls, 2000 ). Moreover, the 
vmPFC assists in the selection of action plans (Yim, Cai and Wang, 2019 ) 
and with solving problems associated with determining the actions of 
ambiguous agents —the car in this scenario (Vartanian and Mandel, 
2011 ). Evidence also shows that both the amygdala and the vmPFC are 
active during the extinction of fear memories (Janak and Tye, 2015 ). 
This idea aligns with studies of flow in rappers and musicians (Limb and 
Braun, 2008; Liu et al., 2012 ) showing heightened activity in the 
vmPFC —perhaps as a result of the creative decision-making and action 
plan selection required by improvisation. Yet, other researchers (e.g., S. Kotler et al.

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 143 (2022) 104956
7Barros et al., 2018; Huskey et al., 2018; Klasen et al., 2012; Ulrich et al., 
2014, 2016a,b, 2022 ) found reduced activity across the whole of the 
mPFC during flow, including the vmPFC. This discrepancy could 
possibly be resolved with a better understanding of the interrelationship 
between the mPFC, amygdala and the endocannabinoid system. CB1 
receptors are plentiful in the mPFC and receptor activation by AEA in-
hibits NE production across the entire region —suggesting a shift in fear 
processing (Morena, 2015 ). 
Finally, the right ventral lateral PFC (vlPFC) is involved in flexible 
action plan selection and emotional forecasting (Bechara, 2011 ), both 
processes that are relevant to our scenario. Yoshida et al. (2014) 
discovered vlPFC activity during a study of gamers in flow, a finding 
they linked to the vlPFC ’s role in the cognitive control of memory (Badre 
and Wagner, 2007 ). Further explanation for vlPFC activity during flow 
can be found in a frontal-striatal-thalamic loop that allows for the 
flexibility in behavior seen in high flow activities like improv jazz, video 
gaming, or a motorcyclist swerving through traffic. As this flexibility is 
present throughout the entire flow experience and not just at state onset, 
this could explain why Yoshida et al. (2014) found the vlPFC activated 
throughout the flow experience, and particularly during later moments 
in the flow eliciting task. Additionally, upregulating CB1 receptor 
binding in the vlPFC promotes stress-coping strategies following un-
predictable stress exposure (McLaughlin et al., 2014; Wirz et al., 2018 ). 
If the ECS is modulating the vlPFC during flow, this further explains why 
flow is likely to lead to post-traumatic growth and not post-traumatic 
stress disorder. 
2.8. T 5: threat processing 
Following the threat assessment seen in T 4, as the motorcyclist 
recognizes the imminent danger, threat processing occurs T 5. This 
will likely require multiple structures within both the executive atten -
tion network and salience network, but a full anatomical breakdown is 
perhaps unnecessary. We know that a threat is detected in our motor -
cyclist ’s experience because both of our conditions —flow and trauma -
—activate the sympathetic nervous system. In humans, when the 
amygdala detects danger, it sends a threat signal to the hypothalamus 
that results in the release of cortisol. This phenomenon is well- 
documented in the study of trauma (Bremner, 2006; Sherin and Nem-
eroff, 2011 ), but it appears in flow as well. A number of studies of flow 
have found that cortisol levels follow an inverted U-shaped curve (Keller 
et al., 2011; Peifer et al., 2014; Tozman and Peifer, 2016 ). Tozman and 
colleagues (2017) for example, examined cortisol levels in chess players 
in flow, finding a moderate level of cortisol was associated with a higher 
level of flow absorption, while a higher level of cortisol was associated 
with a lower level of flow absorption. This finding suggests that flow 
may require some kind of stress response at the front end of the 
experience. 
2.9. T 6: the acute stress response in flow and trauma 
Returning to our hypothetical situation: The motorcyclist ’s visuo -
spatial attention is now directed toward the oncoming car, while the 
driver ’s threat recognition system (Stein and Nesse, 2011 ) has identified 
a significant and imminent danger. From a cognitive-affective perspec -
tive, multiple psychobiological systems are now engaged, perhaps most 
importantly the acute stress or fight-flight-freeze response of the sym-
pathetic nervous system. In this scenario, given the situational context, 
movement suppression and behavioral inhibition are not likely to occur, 
thus freezing is not an option (Roelofs, 2017 ). Instead, from a neuro -
phenomenological point of view, we argue that the transition into flow is 
likely associated with the proactive willingness to approach, and the 
transition into trauma is associated with the reactive inclination to avoid 
(Roelofs, 2017 ). From an objective standpoint, the motorcyclist pro-
duces the same “swerve ” motor action plan, however, phenomenologi -
cally, it may be the case that a decision to “approach ” leads to the state of flow, while the decision to “avoid ” leads to trauma, with the former 
producing concurrent feelings of fortitude, and the latter producing 
concurrent feelings of fear. It is further likely that, subsequent to the 
event, these two distinct neurobiological reactions would be associated 
with different psychological outcomes: the absence of fear-based 
memories in the flow condition, and the presence of fear-based mem-
ories in the trauma condition (Izquierdo et al., 2016 ). A deeper 
consideration of the underlying neurobiology is warranted here. 
Recent work in mice (Salay et al., 2018 ) has clarified that freeze 
responses are controlled by xiphoid nucleus (a substructure in the 
ventral midline thalamus) projections to the BLA. By comparison, fight 
responses invoke projections from the nucleus reuniens (a structure that 
surrounds the xiphoid nucleus) to the mPFC. The argument being 
explored here is that the transition toward flow begins with a signal sent 
from the ventral midline thalamus to themPFC that activates the “fight ” 
motor-action plan. 
It is unclear if this “fight ” signal is always required to create flow, or 
if flow results from more general approach and avoidance processes (e. 
g., Cacioppo et al., 1999 ). Yet, in high-risk situations, three ideas support 
the activation of the fight response. First, Benson and Proctor (2004) 
suggested that the psychological experience of “struggle ” always pre-
cedes entrance into flow. Second, braking is the standard automatic 
response to a visual threat, yet this instinct is inhibited in this scenario 
and replaced by the swerve motor-action plan. Temporal constraints 
dictate that action plan selection must occur immediately after the SN 
detects a threat, with the nucleus reuniens -mPFC pathway representing 
the hypothetical “shortest path ” to activation. Finally, path selec-
tion—fight or flight —is responsible for the reactivation or further sup-
pression of the ECS, which plays a significant role in determining 
outcomes associated with either flow or trauma. More specifically, at T 
3, the introduction of an acute stressor downregulated tonic AEA 
production in the amygdala and hippocampus. In the flow condition, 
after the ventral midline thalamus activates the fight response, we see an 
increase in sympathetic signaling that releases cortisol and reactivates 
tonic AEA production in the amygdala. The evidence for tonic AEA 
reactivation is twofold. First, researchers consistently find amygdala 
downregulation during flow (Limb and Braun, 2008; Ulrich et al., 
2016a, 2022 ; Liu et al., 2012 ) and this necessitates the presence of AEA. 
Second, our flow-condition motorcyclist does not experience 
in-situation feelings of fear and does not have post-event fear memories, 
and both require the presence of AEA (Gunduz-Cinar et al., 2013 ). 
Additionally, in the trauma condition, continual inhibition of AEA 
produces fear conditioning, creates fear-memories and is a contributing 
factor in the later development of PTSD (Wyrofsky et al., 2019 ). 
2.10. T 7: action plan selection 
After threat detection and the sympathetic response detailed in T 
6, the motorcyclist selects the “swerve ” action plan. There are a number 
of lines of evidence that show the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex 
(dACC) is involved in action plan selection alongside its aforementioned 
roles (See T 0 and T 1). As Brockett et al. (2020) wrote: “Decades of 
imaging and modeling research in humans have implicated the anterior 
cingulate cortex in the evaluation of situational demands and the hy-
pothesized alterations of downstream nodes such as the dorsal medial 
striatum that facilitate appropriate action plan selection. ” More specif -
ically, Shenhav et al. (2016) has argued that the dACC is particularly 
sensitive to environmental changes that require a rapid motor response, 
which is the case in our motorcycle scenario. Furthermore, cognitively 
demanding tasks —such as swerving in traffic — activate the dorsal ACC 
and deactivate the posterior ACC (Binder et al., 1999; Drevets and 
Raichle, 1998; Raichle et al., 2001 ). 
Action plan selection is modulated by dopamine, as D1 DA receptors 
in the ACC regulate effort-based decision-making (Schweimer and 
Hauber, 2006 ). Furthermore, once a decision is made and the action 
plan selected, as a way to drive reinforcement learning, there is a further S. Kotler et al.

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 143 (2022) 104956
8increase in dopaminergic transmission in the right dACC (Holroyd et al., 
2004 ). In the flow scenario, this increase in DA signaling amplifies the 
signal-to-noise ratio in PFC (Kroener et al., 2009 ) and could be 
responsible for the heightened creativity that has been consistently 
correlated with the state. Additionally, this dopaminergic activity likely 
explains why “clear goals ” and “immediate feedback ” function as flow 
triggers. If “clear goals ” are coded into the reward system and DA ac-
tivity is linked to effort-based decision-making, then having a clear goal 
may favor action over inaction, and further explain the division between 
flow and trauma. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of dACC neurons to error 
responses and error feedback, coupled with DA neurons ’ 
well-established reward sensitivity, may explain why immediate feed-
back facilitates flow onset. 
Furthermore, one of flow ’s most interesting phenomenological at-
tributes is the sensation of flow itself, often described as effortless effort, 
where the experience is that every action and every decision being 
performed leads seamlessly, perfectly, fluidly to the next (Csikszentmi -
halyi, 1990; Kotler, 2013 ). This suggests that dACC activity is not 
limited to state onset. As subjects in flow select numerous, sequential 
action plans, dACC activity may persist throughout the experience. In 
fact, research shows that the dACC is functionally connected with the 
dlPFC during flow (Huskey et al., 2018 ), which may further facilitate 
phenomenological experience of “clear goals ” and “immediate feed-
back ” specifically, and more generally, may explain why so many 
research subjects have described their phenomenological experience of 
the state as “flowy. ” However, a challenge to this interpretation is that 
other studies have shown lower activation in the ACC during flow 
(Huskey et al., 2018; Klasen et al., 2012; Ulrich et al., 2016a, 2022). 
2.11. T 8: The onset of flow 
At this moment, our motorcyclist executes the swerve action plan 
and rapidly transitions into flow. For the purposes of this hypothetical 
situation, assume the swerve consists of three different miniature action 
plans: an initial swerve away from the car, a second movement to 
counter-balance the out-thrust of the first, and a final adjustment to re- 
center the motorcycle along its new trajectory. When the motorcyclist 
performs the initial swerve away from the car, there is an increase in 
dopaminergic reward signaling in the mesocorticolimbic pathway that 
corresponds with the successful execution of this first action plan. 
Additionally, “rebound-excitation theory ” suggests that DA provides a 
post-acute stress safety signal that inhibits fear-processing neurons in a 
spatially and temporally controlled manner (J.C. Lee et al., 2016; E.M. 
Lee et al., 2016 ). For example, experiments in acute stress conditions 
showed phasic rebound-excitation of DA neurons in the VTA at the offset 
of aversive stimuli, with DA signal strength time-locked to the termi -
nation of fearful events. A weak signal promotes fearful memories and 
anxious behavior, while a strong one extinguishes fearful memories and 
promotes resilience (J.C. Lee et al., 2016; E.M. Lee et al., 2016 ). In our 
flow example, once our motorcyclist recognizes that the first of the three 
mini-action plans is actually working, a DA safety signal should arise. 
The initial dopaminergic reward will likely produce a feeling of 
surprise, as this is the phenomenological signal that arises during the 
recognition of better than expected results, and provokes a P300 event- 
related potential (ERP). However, there are two types of P300 ERPs. The 
P300a is associated with novelty; the P300b with surprise (Polich, 
2007 ). In our motorcyclist ’s scenario, the signal is a P300b, as an 
abundance of oddball paradigm experiments show that a novel and 
unexpected stimulus produces a P300b wave approximately 300–400 
ms following presentation (Picton, 1992 ). 
In this scenario, we speculate there are four reasons to predict a P300 
at T 8. First, unless our motorcyclist is a professional, it is unlikely that 
swerving around a car is a single well-rehearsed motor plan. Thus, the 
successful execution of each mini-plan would be surprising to our driver. 
Second, the P300 has also been related to appraisal updating —the threat 
of the car is updated into something less dangerous as the swerve starts to work, with the wave ’s amplitude heightening based on stimulus 
probability and task-relevance (Donchin and Coles, 1988 ). Third, 
studies have shown that flow proneness is associated with DA receptor 
activity (de Manzano et al., 2013; Gyurkovics et al., 2016 ). This matters 
because traits long associated with DA receptor activity —sensation 
seeking, introversion-to-extroversion, and impulsivity —have also been 
correlated with the P300 (Stelmack and Houlihan, 1994 ). Fourth, our 
in-flow motorcyclist has no post-incident fear despite having accurate 
memories of the event. It is known that stimulus encoding that promotes 
successful memory storage and retrieval will increase P300 amplitude 
(Azizian and Polich, 2007 ) and that signal latency is related to how long 
it takes to update a target stimulus, with verbal tasks taking longer than 
spatial tasks (Kutas et al., 1977 ). As our motorcyclist has non-fearful 
memories and responded to a visual stimulus, we predict a P300 wave 
that is larger in amplitude and shorter in latency. 
Additionally, this signal —phasic DA activity —occurs immediately 
after the first sign that outcomes are better than anticipated, and pro-
duces subsequent pulses after each confirming sign (Holroyd et al., 
2004 ). In our example, there are a series of P300 waves, each probably 
slightly smaller in amplitude, after the successful execution of each of 
the three mini-action plans (swerve, counter-swerve, straighten out). 
2.12. T 9: Localized hypofrontality 
At T 8, the motorcyclist has executed the action plan and is either 
experiencing flow or traumatic stress. Early theorizing argued that flow 
is associated with a significant downregulation of the PFC (Dietrich, 
2004 ), or what has been called “transient hypofrontality ” in the litera -
ture. Specifically, Dietrich proposed transient hypofrontality as the 
neuronal process that underlies flow and all altered states of con-
sciousness (Dietrich, 2004 ). This idea has since been confirmed experi -
mentally, albeit with mixed results (for a review, see Harris et al., 
2017a ). Some studies have found large-scale PFC deactivation during 
flow. Both Limb and Braun (2008) and Liu et al. (2012) observed broad 
deactivations of the PFC in studies of musicians and rappers in flow. In 
Liu and colleague ’s work, almost all of the lateral prefrontal cortices, 
extending from the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (loPFC) to the superior 
portions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as well as the 
dorsal portions of the mPFC, were deactivated. 
By comparison, the vast majority of studies have found evidence for 
more localized hypofrontality, particularly among the medial PFC 
(mPFC). As was discussed previously, this region is thoroughly impli -
cated in the division between flow and trauma, yet—regarding hypo -
frontality —it appears that the mPFC is consistently deactivated during 
flow (Barros et al., 2018; Klasen et al., 2012; Ulrich et al., 2014, 2016a, 
2022 ). In fact, more recent evidence indicates that downregulation of 
the mPFC is causally implicated in flow experiences (Ulrich et al., 
2016b ), particularly among people who have low-baseline levels of flow 
experiences (Ulrich et al., 2018 ). Other research has shown low levels of 
mPFC activity (Huskey, Craighead et al., 2018 ), and mPFC functional 
connectivity (Huskey et al., 2018, 2021 ) during flow. Taken together, 
the data suggests that these PFC deactivations are localized to mPFC 
regions, and the extent of these deactivations may be based on task-set 
and task-requirements, rather than the across-the-board shutdown that 
earlier researchers had proposed (for an extended treatment, see Harris 
et al., 2017a ). 
EEG studies of flow show frontal alpha and theta activity (Eschmann 
et al., 2021 ; Katahira et al., 2018 ). In the work done by Katahira et al. 
(2018) , frontal theta was localized to frontal-midline regions, which is 
implicated in cognitive control (Cavanagh and Frank, 2014 ) and con-
centration (Lagopoulos et al., 2009 ). This finding is related to the 
increased effort and increased cognitive control required to produce 
flow (when both task challenge and individual skills are moderate to 
high) and to task absorption (a complete concentration and merger of 
action and awareness condition). Eschmann et al. (2021) have shown 
that increased fronto-medial theta is associated with increased flow, and S. Kotler et al.

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 143 (2022) 104956
9increased motor performance, and that neurofeedback training can 
enhance both flow and motor performance. Similarly, the alpha oscil-
lations in Katahira ’s study were found over the frontal central and 
frontal right cortical areas and tended to increase with task difficulty. As 
alpha has been repeatedly correlated with heightened creativity (Lus-
tenberger et al., 2015 ) this increase could further account for the 
amplified creativity seen in flow. Other EEG work has shown increased 
fronto-alpha power during flow, particularly in midline regions, which 
has been interpreted as relating to the reward-modulated deployment of 
cognitive control (Castellar et al., 2019 ). 
In summary, it appears that hypofrontality is localized to the mPFC, a 
structure that is a core component of the default mode network (Raichle 
et al., 2001 ) and is heavily implicated in self-referential processing 
(Northoff et al., 2006 ). That the mPFC is consistently downregulated 
during flow may explain why a core phenomenological characteristic of 
flow is diminished self-awareness and self-reflection. By comparison, 
flow seems to require large-scale activity across the PFC, excluding the 
mPFC, but including the ACC. Together, this accounts for recent theo-
rizing that flow requires high levels of cognitive control (Fisher et al., 
2021; Weber et al., 2009, 2016; Weber and Fisher, 2020 ), which may 
explain why flow feels simultaneously high-control, but effortless (see 
also, Harris et al., 2017b ; Huskey, Wilcox et al., 2018 ). 
3.A theoretical perspective on the neural dynamics for the 
onset of flow 
In this paper, in addition to the neurobiological mechanisms dis-
cussed in sections T 0 through T 9, we also propose a neural 
dynamical framework for the onset of flow. Here, the term “neural dy-
namics ” refers to how the brain exchanges information via oscillation, 
that is, how neural oscillatory activity in one brain region affects, or is 
statistically correlated, with neural activity in another brain region. 
These dynamical networks are how the brain changes its state over time. 
From a theoretical perspective, understanding the neural dynamics 
involved in our motorcycle scenario —that is, understanding how the 
neuronal regions involved in the onset of flow become functionally 
coupled or uncoupled —may yield new empirical and testable insights 
about the mechanisms involved, and lay the groundwork for a compu -
tational modeling approach. 
Functional connectivity (FC) between brain regions is defined as the 
statistical dependence between neural time series regardless of their 
direct anatomical connections (Friston, 1994 ). These patterns of activ-
ity, as captured by EEG, MEG or fMRI, can be effectively measured using 
a variety of functional connectivity analysis (Wang et al., 2014 ). The 
resulting data reveals the flow of information among and within brain 
networks and is critical for linking these networks and their dynamics to 
cognitive and phenomenological states (such as flow). For example, 
using correlation either in the time or frequency domains, will yield 
undirected and symmetrical, shared information among the network 
(Barnett et al., 2020 ). Directed functional connectivity analysis, on the 
other hand, can yield causal connectivity, i.e., the direction of infor-
mation flow between nodes in the network (Friston et al., 2003; Man-
nino and Bressler, 2015; Bressler and Seth, 2011 ). 
Given that one of the known phenomenological correlates of flow is 
hyper-focused, task-specific attention, the underlying neural dynamics 
should reflect a task-engaged cognitive state. This task-engagement in-
volves the activation of task-dependent networks, such as the dorsal 
attention network and fronto-parietal control network, and is often 
contrasted to resting state or task-negative networks, such as the default 
mode network (DMN; Fox et al., 2005) . Typically, the activity of these 
networks is anti-correlated, though recent evidence has revealed a more 
nuanced account wherein different network components may be 
simultaneously active. In fact, evidence shows that tasks performed 
automatically (Vatansever et al., 2017 ), or with low levels of difficulty 
(Huskey et al., 2018b,a, Ulrich et al., 2014, 2016a, 2018, 2022 ) tend to 
engage the DMN. Other research shows that, during goal-directed cognition, the DMN is functionally coupled with both task-positive 
attentional networks and task-positive frontoparietal control networks 
(Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014; Christoff et al., 2016; Spreng, 2012; Xu 
et al., 2020 ; Dixon et al., 2016 ). 
During flow, typically anti-correlated networks appear to be co- 
activated. The hyper-focus associated with flow requires activation of 
task-positive attentional networks. Yet, flow also shares considerable 
overlap with a task-negative cognitive state, the psychedelic state 
(Csikszentmihalyi and Nakamura, 2018 ). This overlap includes 
phenomenological elements such as the diminishment of self, an altered 
sense of time (dilation or acceleration), and the merger of action and 
awareness, as well as behavioral elements, such as a measurable increase 
in creativity (divergent thinking) and insight. Therefore, a deeper un-
derstanding of the neural dynamics of the psychedelic state is useful for 
informing our examination of flow ’s neural dynamics. 
Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the neural 
dynamics of the psychedelic state, Barnett et al. (2020) found a simul -
taneous decrease in directed functional connectivity and an increase in 
undirected functional connectivity (particularly in the LSD condition). 
The authors interpret this network co-activation as consistent with the 
“increasing disorder and functional disorganization underlying the 
psychedelic experience ” (Barnett et al., 2020 ). Essentially, there is a 
breakdown of ordered communication between critical brain regions. 
This breakdown reflects a relaxation of constraints in global brain ac-
tivity that corresponds with an expansion of the possible repertoire of 
brain states (thereby increasing dynamic diversity). Carhart-Harris et al. 
(2018) have argued these specific changes in neural dynamics correlate 
with the uncontrolled cognition and perception that are signature 
phenomenological aspects of the psychedelic experience. 
From a theoretical perspective, the psychedelic brain is at the “edge 
of criticality ” (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018 ). In any self-organizing 
dynamical system (like the brain), criticality is the transition point be-
tween two tendencies or phases: an ordered state and a disordered, 
chaotic one. By allowing the brain to best adapt to a wide variety of 
rapidly changing external conditions, this proximity to criticality facil-
itates optimal processing and performance. For example, Atasoy et al. 
(2017) , using power-law distributions and connectome-harmonic 
decomposition, found that a frequency-specific re-organization of 
brain dynamics —specifically, an increase in repertoire —brings the 
brain closer to the edge of criticality. This is consistent with the entropic 
brain hypothesis, metastability, the free-energy principle, and scale-free 
cortical dynamics (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019 , Kelso, 2012; Tog-
noli and Kelso, 2014 ; Bressler, 2008 ; Friston et al., 2020 , Freeman and 
Breakspear, 2007 ). In altered states of consciousness —including psy-
chedelic states —mounting evidence suggests that the brain functions at 
the edge of criticality, that is, at, or near, a metastable critical state 
(Carhart-Harris, 2018 ; Cavanna et al., 2018 ;Kelso, 2012, 2021 ; Cocchi 
et al., 2017 ). 
Two important points considered here are worth elaborating, a 
theoretical one and a terminological one. Theoretically, given that we 
are both describing and explaining a phase transition into flow, we 
consider flow, as an altered state of consciousness described in our hy-
pothetical situation, from a metastable perspective (Fuchs et al., 2000; 
Kelso, 1992 ). Crucially, this would mean that flow is a transient phe-
nomenon —a metastable tendency. Metastability (Kelso, 2012; Tognoli 
and Kelso, 2014 ) plays a central role in cortical coordination dynamics, 
and in general, refers to the simultaneous tendency for individual 
components of system to couple together and for the individual com-
ponents to remain autonomous. It is a property of a system of coupled 
oscillators, whereby the systems dynamics tend toward a stable attractor 
(coordination pattern) but are never fully trapped by that attractor. 
Instead, the system remains in an unstable pattern near the stable co-
ordination pattern. In cognitive neurodynamics for example, different 
regions of the cortex, comprised of neuronal populations, can simulta -
neously couple and coordinate their behavior to produce certain 
cognitive functions, but also express their own individual oscillatory S. Kotler et al.

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 143 (2022) 104956
10behavior, allowing the brain to rapidly shift its functionality in order to 
make sense of the external world. Thus, cortical metastability produces 
the simultaneous tendency for cortical areas to remain segregated, 
manifesting their own intrinsic activity, and to be integrated, influ-
encing each other by reciprocal coupling (Tognoli and Kelso, 2014 ). 
Terminologically, although we have used the word “state ” as a 
description of both the neural and phenomenological aspects of flow 
throughout this paper, this may not accurately reflect reality. By defi-
nition, state implies stability, however, considering the dynamics, i.e., 
the possible metastable nature of the phenomenon, the term state may 
not, ultimately, be appropriate (Kelso, 2021 ). 
Recently however, Huskey et al., 2021 , have theoretically and 
empirically compared the metastability proposal with the synchroniza -
tion theory of flow (STF) first proposed by Weber et al. (2009) . We 
carefully consider here the relevance of STF in the context of network 
control theory and criticality. The STF proposes a functional synchro -
nization of cognitive control (including attentional structures) and 
reward networks (RNs) in the brain, and understands flow as a syn-
chronized brain state. 
One open question is the nature of this connectivity. STF predicts 
that the brain transitions through a sequence of network topologies, 
ending up in a functionally connected, highly synchronized state, which 
corresponds with the flow state (Huskey, Wilcox et al., 2018 ). This idea 
is very similar to and sits within the concept of controllability (and 
network control theory Gu et al., 2015 ; Lydon-Staley et al., 2021 ). The 
concept of controllability states that, in terms of energy efficiency, the 
brain optimizes its dynamics among distributed neural systems to, in this 
case, respond to the demands of the environment. Thus, the brain or-
ganizes its dynamics to move through various cognitive states, with 
structurally dense areas facilitating easily reachable states, and more 
distributed regions facilitating more difficult to reach states (e.g., the 
flow state). On this account, network control theory offers an underlying 
theoretical framework for how the brain organizes its dynamics to meet 
task demands (for everyday living, but also for flow). STF is the specific 
case where two systems in the brain, cognitive control systems, and 
reward – based (i.e., intrinsic motivation) systems functionally syn-
chronize to allow the brain to reach the flow state. 
Recent work has started to probe the nature of this fronto-parietal 
control network (FPCN), and the fronto-parietal reward networks 
(FPRN) connectivity. Using fMRI, Huskey et al., 2021 found increased 
flexibility among the FPCN and FPRN during flow, but decreased flexi-
bility among the reward network only. They also found comparatively 
low levels of synchrony in the FPCN and FPRN during flow. Meta -
stability offers one possible explanation for this finding. From a meta-
stability perspective, it is possible that the brain during flow is 
appropriately segregated or integrated and oscillates between these 
tendencies, rather than being attracted to them but not entering either. 
However, Huskey et al., 2021 did not find strong evidence supporting 
this metastability hypothesis. With that said, other research has shown 
that the brain does exhibit non-linear criticality during flow (Weber 
et al., 2018 ). It may be that the null metastability results observed in 
(Huskey et al., 2021) was driven by the limited temporal resolution of 
fMRI. 
So far, empirical work shows that the brain is organized into a 
modular network topology during flow (Huskey et al., 2021) , this to-
pology is energetically efficient (Huskey, Wilcox et al., 2018 ), and ex-
hibits high levels of flexibility (Huskey et al., 2021) , which is associated 
with the successful deployment of cognitive control during difficult tasks 
(Cole et al., 2013 ). However, the exact nature of brain-network con-
nectivity during flow is unresolved, and this connectivity may very well 
exhibit metastable characteristics. 
Therefore, we return to our discussion concerning criticality. Con-
trasted with the increase in disorder accompanying the onset of a psy-
chedelic state, entry into flow appears to require a decrease in 
disorder —that is, an integration of information —driven by behaviorally 
salient and cognitively demanding task-oriented input. Thus flow, especially in the motorcycle scenario considered in this paper, is non- 
resting and task-dependent. Additionally, while the edge-of-criticality 
aspect of the psychedelic state increases the repertoire of possible 
states, we predict that entry into flow will constrain the repertoire of 
active brain states. We also suggest that this will correspond, empiri -
cally, with an increase in directed, and a decrease in undirected, func-
tional connectivity. The brain, upon entry into flow, allocates its 
resources vis-ˇa-vis distinct connectivity patterns in a manner required 
for all the requisite performance-enhancing cognitive processes needed 
for the task at hand —in this case, a successful swerve. 
Moreover, research has shown that the brain can quickly tune itself 
closer to or farther away from criticality depending on external input to 
the specific network (Zierenberg et al., 2018 ). Wilting and Priesemann 
(2019) have called the underlying mechanism driving this process: 
“homeostatic plasticity. ” In homeostatic plasticity, neurons and their 
networks use negative feedback loops to maintain a target spike rate, 
thereby stabilizing network dynamics. By adjusting their excitability to 
compensate for unrestrained neural communication, neurons can 
self-organize into a variety of dynamical regimes. This reorganization 
moves the brain to a subcritical point, where neural communication is 
well-constrained. It may be that this same subcritical point is where the 
flow network manifests and operates. 
Given this scenario, it is also important to note that both “neural 
context ” and “situational context ” are likely to play central roles in 
determining exact changes in brain dynamics during flow. Neural 
context refers to the specific selective functioning of local neural pro-
cesses as they are modulated by global neural influences, as distin -
guished from situational context, which involves both internal 
information from the periphery and external information from the 
environment, as well as the behavioral demands this information places 
upon the brain and body (Bressler and McIntosh, 2007 ). While the 
relationship between these two categories of context is not completely 
understood, the research clearly shows situational context shapes neural 
context —meaning context dependent, task-relevant cues constrain brain 
connectivity. This dependent relationship likely increases pattern 
recognition and cognitive flexibility, while decreasing (or constraining) 
the possible states the relevant networks can operate within (Weber and 
Fisher, 2020 ). In other words, in flow, situational context likely in-
fluences the sub-critical set point toward which homeostatic plasticity 
tunes the brain in order to maximize cognitive flexibility and minimize 
prediction errors. 
In flow, the above mechanism would allow the brain to constrain the 
possible task-specific parameter space between connections of selected 
cortical areas, but loosen them in other areas, allowing for the unique 
creativity that is commonly associated with flow. The specific changes in 
both directed and undirected functional connectivity hypothesized here 
make it possible for the brain to increase pattern recognition and 
cognitive flexibility, but within a specific context. Recent evidence from 
Konovalov and Krajbich (2018) supports this, as they found the brain 
engages in a novel form of pattern learning. Using a Bayesian 
pattern-learning inference model, they found that brain networks both 
predict patterns, while simultaneously developing rules that increase the 
finding of future patterns. Thus, we surmise here that contextual pro-
cessing constrains creativity in a flow state, essentially creating a highly 
constrained novelty detection system that is specifically tuned to in-
crease task-specific performance and learning. 
As applied to our hypothetical situation, during flow, and due to 
homeostatic plasticity, the motorcyclist ’s brain is much closer to the 
edge-of-criticality inside a context-constrained search space. This allows 
the rider to find all possible best action-plans for swerving around that 
offending car, but saves the brain from cue-dependent yet task- 
irrelevant association —which is something that happens in other 
altered states, such as dreaming or psychedelic states. 
Finally, from a computational perspective, the above analysis sug-
gests that a modelling approach may be useful for exploring flow, given 
that it is very difficult to study this cognitive phenomenon in an S. Kotler et al.

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 143 (2022) 104956
11ecological context. A sufficient model used to simulate the network 
conditions, as well as the environmental stimulus, may yield more 
description, explanation and prediction for the onset of the state (see e. 
g., Bensaid et al., 2019 ). Melnikoff and colleagues (2022) , using the 
concept of mutual information, recently proposed and empirically 
validated a computational theory of the subjective experience of flow. 
This model is based on the concept of Bayesian surprise, which we 
believe directly corresponds with our proposed involvement of the 
P300b surprise signal. Likewise, Itti and Baldi (2009) found that this 
kind of surprise (like our motorcyclist scenario) attracts visual-spatial 
attention. We suggest that integrating this phenomenological model 
with some of the underlying neural mechanism described here, would be 
a reasonable future step. 
One interesting element of Melnikoff et al’s (2022) model is that it 
directly contradicts one of the core causal antecedents of flow; that is, 
the challenge/skill balance. This model shows empirically that flow can 
occur, even when the challenge/skill balance is low. Such a finding is 
novel given that the challenge/skill balance is the most common in-
duction in experimental flow research (see e.g., Huskey et al., 2018b,a, 
2021 ; Keller and Bless, 2008 ; Keller and Blomann, 2008 ; Ulrich et al., 
2014, 2016a,b, 2018, 2022 ). However, the challenge/skill balance has 
come under some recent scrutiny as recent experimental work has failed 
to detect a difference between self-reported flow when challenge ≪skill 
(flow) or when challenge Dskill (Huskey et al., 2021) . Therefore, it will 
become increasingly important to further verify the extent to which 
mutual information, rather than the challenge/skill balance, explains 
when and why flow occurs. Early tests of this mutual information model 
have been conducted in behavioral contexts (Melnikoff et al., 2022 ) but 
could be extended into neuroscientific contexts using existing datasets 
(e.g., Huskey et al., 2021 ). If it turns out that mutual information (and 
Bayesian surprise more generally) do offer a causal explanation for flow, 
then it becomes possible to link this mechanism with existing neuro -
scientific research (e.g., Nour et al., 2018 ; O’Reilly et al., 2013 ; 
Schwartenbeck et al., 2016 ). 
4.Linking neurobiology with phenomenology 
At the start of this paper, we described criteria any robust explana -
tion of flow-onset should meet, specifically it needs to explain the six 
core characteristics of flow, the functionality of the state ’s triggers, and 
the state ’s well-documented impact on performance. Does this expla -
nation satisfy these requirements? To answer this question, we revisit 
the six core phenomenological characteristics of flow and explore this 
proposal ’s ability to account for all six. 
4.1. Complete concentration 
As discussed, flow is a state of complete concentration, but how this 
concentration arises has yet to be determined. If we assume an error 
signal (ERP) at the onset of flow, then the resulting activity in the 
salience network and the NE-induced amplification of attention could 
serve as the gateway into complete concentration. Similarly, recent 
computational modeling work (Fromer et al., 2021; Grahek et al., 2022 ) 
shows that early prediction errors inform people about task efficacy and 
the expected value of reward associated with effort. When efficacy or 
expected reward value is low, people allocate less effort compared to 
when efficacy and reward are high. Considering that flow is a highly 
rewarding psychological state that requires high levels of efficacy, it is 
likely that these early prediction error signals influence subsequent 
control deployment. Furthermore, it is likely that phasic DA release 
helps sustain that focus over time. 
4.2. Merger of action and awareness 
The merger of action and awareness is less empirically tractable, but 
likely correlates with the efficiency of motor activity. In our motorcycle example, if the swerve had been highly efficacious (as would be likely 
during flow), then we would see increased neuronal activation in the 
corresponding motor areas than would be present in novice, or other -
wise low-efficacy swervers. Some preliminary evidence points in this 
direction. Flow is associated with increased activity in sensorimotor 
cortex and the cerebellum (which is often implicated in fine-motor co-
ordination) compared to conditions of low-difficulty (Huskey et al., 
2018 ). Interestingly, however, the brain-network topology associated 
with this activation is more sparsely connected (a measure of energetic 
efficiency) during flow relative to a low-difficulty condition (Huskey 
et al., 2018 ). Research shows that, for well-rehearsed tasks, more effi-
cient brain-network topologies are associated with increased perfor -
mance (Bassett et al., 2009 ). Upregulation in sensorimotor cortex and 
cerebellum, combined with an efficient brain-network topology, might 
be a neural signature of the merger of action and awareness associated 
with flow. Indeed, the functionality of the challenge-skills balance as a 
flow trigger implies expertise and the presence of pre-existing motor 
plans and/or knowledge structures that expertise demands. 
4.3. Time Perception 
As discussed, time dilation can be produced by a number of different 
mechanisms. Phasic DA signaling speeds up and/or slows down our 
perception of time, as does an increase in signaling in the salience 
network. Additionally, Dietrich and others have argued that temporal 
integration is a prefrontal function and that time dilation would be a 
byproduct of transient hypofrontality (2004). This presents a conun -
drum as research syntheses (Coull et al., 2011 ) and meta-analytic work 
(Wiener et al., 2010 ) show that accurate time perception requires a 
distributed network of activation across prefrontal (inferior frontal 
gyrus, precentral gyrus, supplemental motor area) and basal ganglia 
structures (anterior putamen, caudate nucleus), regions which have all 
been implicated in flow (see e.g., Huskey, Craighead et al., 2018 ; Klasen 
et al., 2011; Ulrich et al., 2014 , 2016). If these regions are all required 
for accurate time perception, and these regions also show increased 
activity during flow, then the largescale hypofrontality hypothesis pro-
posed by Dietrich (2004) is not well supported. 
A narrower interpretation of Dietrich ’s (2004) hypothesis may pro-
vide an answer. Many of the structures listed above are implicated in 
“explicit ” (how long a stimulus lasts, or the interstimulus interval) or 
“implicit ” (using temporal information to achieve specific task goals) 
timing (Coull et al., 2011 ). Both types of time perception may be crucial 
for accomplishing challenging tasks that are associated with the flow 
experience. However, there is evidence of localized hypofrontality, 
particularly in the mPFC, during flow. The mPFC is a core structure in 
the DMN, and a consistent body of research shows that the mPFC and 
DMN are downregulated during flow (see e.g., Huskey, Craighead et al., 
2018 ; Huskey, Wilcox et al., 2018 ; Ulrich et al., 2014, 2016a,b, 2022 ). 
The DMN is also implicated in conscious awareness of time ’s passing 
(Lloyd, 2012 ). Therefore, it could be that just mPFC deactivation (as 
proposed by Dietrich, 2004 ), but not a large scale downregulation of the 
DMN, explains temporal dilation during flow. 
So far, we have discussed time ’s passage during flow in terms of 
dilation. However, research suggests that, in some cases of flow, the 
perception of time speeds up. Keller and Bless (2008) found subjects 
reported time went by faster while experiencing flow playing a video 
game. Additionally, Rutrecht et al. (2021) , obtained a similar result in a 
virtual reality game scenario. Others have found that a perception of 
time passing rapidly is associated with increased levels of flow and task 
performance (Christandl et al., 2018 ). Indeed, ample evidence suggests 
that time often passes rapidly during flow (for a review see Barthelm as 
and Keller, 2021 ). 
Regrettably, this ambiguity between time dilation and the speeded 
experience of time is prevalent in the flow literature. For instance, 
prominent self-report measures of flow, including the DFS-2 and FFS-2 
(Jackson and Eklund, 2004 ) fail to distinguish between the two. Even S. Kotler et al.

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 143 (2022) 104956
12Csikszentmihalyi has contributed to this ambiguity by noting that time is 
“distorted ”, although he does argue that the speeded experience of time 
may be more common (Nakamura and Csikszentmihalyi, 2005 ). At the 
same time, there is some evidence (Heim, 1892 , Eagleman, 2009 , Kotler, 
2013 ) that time dilation is more frequently reported in high-risk situa-
tions than time acceleration. Therefore, the nature of time perception, 
and its neural substrates during flow, remains an open question. 
4.4. The Vanishing of Self 
Dietrich and others have correlated the diminishment of our sense of 
self to transient and localized mPFC hypofrontality (Dietrich, 2004 ). 
This also tracks with research by Kotler & Murphy (forthcoming) 
showing that subjects report time dilation before they report the van-
ishing of self. If time is first dilated by activity in the salience network 
and the increase and/or decline in phasic DA (non-hypofrontal mecha -
nisms) and the vanishing of self is a result of localized mPFC hypo -
frontality, this mechanism could match the reported evidence. 
Research shows a consistent downregulation of the DMN during flow 
(see e.g., Huskey, Craighead et al., 2018 ; Huskey, Wilcox et al., 2018 ; 
Ulrich et al., 2014, 2016a,b, 2022 ). In addition to temporal perception, 
the DMN is heavily implicated in self-referential processing (for a 
meta-analysis, see Northoff et al., 2006 ). It could very well be that this 
DMN downregulation explains the diminished self-awareness that is 
commonly experienced during flow. Additionally, Klasen et al. (2012) 
found deactivation in the temporal parietal junction during a study of 
flow in video gamers. As described above, the TPJ has been implicated in 
both embodied and disembodied (out of body) experiences (Blanke and 
Arzy, 2005 ) and could play an additional role in the diminishment of our 
sense of self. 
4.5. A sense of control 
A sense of control could be produced by either phasic DA increases 
and/or a series of P300 ERPs —as both reflect better than expected re-
sults from task execution. As DA also increases pattern recognition and 
amplifies muscle reaction times, these performance benefits could 
further contribute to the phenomenological experience of control. 
Indeed, error signals associated with reward and self-efficacy guide the 
deployment of control (Fromer et al., 2021; Grahek et al., 2022 ). 
Moreover, the FPCN, a core network in control deployment, is both 
flexible and modular during flow (Huskey et al., 2021 ). This flexibility is 
associated with successful control deployment during difficult tasks 
(Cole et al., 2013 ), and modularity is associated with energetic effi-
ciency (Bullmore and Sporns, 2012 ) and increased task performance 
(Bassett, 2009 ). Finally, as the dACC aids in action plan selection and 
remote action plan detection —two neuronal activities that, at least hy-
pothetically, should impact our phenomenological sense of control —it is 
further likely that the dACC activity proposed in this paper would 
further correspond to that sense of control. 
4.6. Autotelicity 
In this scenario, autotelicity can be produced by the significant in-
crease in dopaminergic signaling described in T 3 and T 7. In their 
excellent overview of the neurobiology of intrinsic motivation, Di 
Domenico and Ryan (2017) argue that heightened activity in 
salience-coding DA neurons accounts for the amplified intrinsic moti-
vation of the autotelic experience. This idea receives further support 
from both de Manzano et al. (2013) and Gyurkovics et al. (2016) who 
both found empirical evidence linking DA activity to the autotelic nature 
of flow. Furthermore, studies consistently associate heightened intrinsic 
motivation with increased activity in the salience network and the ex-
ecutive attention network and decreased activity in the default mode 
network (for complete review, see Di Domenico and Ryan, 2017 ). This is 
further bolstered by evidence showing that flow is associated with increased activity within, and functional connectivity between reward 
processing regions (Huskey et al., 2018b,a, 2021; Klasen et al., 2012 ; 
Ulrich et al., 2014, 2016a ). 
In animal models, acute stress releases dynorphin into the NAcc 
which downregulates DA and has been correlated with learned help-
lessness and depressive symptoms (Kram et al., 2002 ). This may explain 
the division between flow and trauma, as this would occur in the trauma 
scenario, while the flow scenario seems likely to require enkephalin 
release (which is associatd with feelings of euphoria, see Boecker et al., 
2008 ). As applied to our motorcycle hypothetical situation, once the 
swerve produces better than expected results, enkephalins would be 
released. These chemicals both increase DA production (Kalivas and 
Duffy, 1990 ), which would further enhance motivation and increase 
autotelicity. Finally, work by Henry et al. (2017) relates heightened 
enkephalin signaling to the development of resilience, suggesting an 
opioid-related mechanism for the post-traumatic growth we see in the 
flow-condition motorcyclist. 
4.7. Flow triggers and performance benefits 
The neuronal processes outlined in this paper offer a potential 
explanation of both flow ’s triggers and flow ’s performance benefits. We 
again emphasize that more research is needed for demonstrating the 
causal role of the triggers and their relationship with performance. On 
the trigger side, clear goals, immediate feedback, the challenge-skills 
balance, novelty, complexity, unpredictability, risk, insight, curiosity, 
passion, autonomy, mastery and purpose, all engage the seeking system 
and activate phasic DA release. It is likely that any sudden change in DA 
signaling and activity in the salience network —triggered either exter -
nally or internally —can (but will not always) result in flow. Moreover, 
and as discussed elsewhere, it seems these reward signals appear to bias 
the deployment of control, which should further facilitate task perfor -
mance. Now, from a descriptive perspective, flow ’s triggers engage 
multiple systems and processes, and thus the proposal in this paper 
describes how global neurocognitive changes in the brain are associated 
with those triggers. 
On the performance side, the significant increase in salience network 
activity, especially the LC-NE system, coupled to an increase in dopa-
minergic signaling could account for flow ’s heightening of both intrinsic 
motivation and learning rates (Pekrun, 1992; Seli et al., 2016; Tyng 
et al., 2017 ). This increase in DA signaling could also partially explain 
flow ’s impact on creativity and innovation, as DA also amplifies pattern 
recognition. Additionally, as DA signaling correlates with an increase in 
positive affect and positive affect has been shown to increase the like-
lihood that the dACC will discover remote associations and activate 
weakly recalled action plans, this could be a further mechanism for 
enhanced creativity (Kounios et al., 2006; Kounios and Jung-Beeman, 
2014 ). Myers et al. (2016) found that grit correlated with ventral 
striatal networks extending to the mPFC and rostral ACC, while Tour-
outoglou et al. (2018) discovered that the ACC is the central hub for 
tenacity-persistence in the face of challenges. Both of these systems 
would be active in a flow scenario and could account for the downstream 
development of grit and resilience that has been correlated with 
post-traumatic growth. Moreover, recent neuroimaging studies on grit in 
academic performance link the trait to heightened spontaneous resting 
state activity in the right dlPFC (Wang et al., 2017 ). This finding cor-
responds to research by Nakagawa et al. (2016) , who state: “The dlPFC 
seems to be the main neural correlate of post-traumatic growth. ” 
5.The flow versus trauma question 
In our hypothetical example, why does one motorcyclist experience 
flow and another traumatic stress? Before we explore alterations in 
underlying neurobiological mechanisms that account for this difference 
in psychological outcome, an examination of the similarities between 
experiences is worth considering. Both flow and traumatic stress are S. Kotler et al.

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 143 (2022) 104956
13altered states that arise during waking conscious experience, both 
require activation of similar large-scale brain networks and neuro -
modulatory systems. Yet, it is within the actions of those neuro -
modulatory systems that we can start this discussion. 
One of the larger neurobiological differences between flow and 
trauma involves phasic DA. As reviewed earlier, in flow, there is an in-
crease in phasic DA signaling that results from both the “fight response ” 
and/or the successful execution of the initial “swerve ” motor-action 
plan. This surge does not occur in trauma, because, while the execu -
tion of the same “swerve ” motor-action occurs, in the trauma-scenarios 
it is a fear-inducing stimulus. More specifically, rebound-excitation 
theory (J.C. Lee et al., 2016; E.M. Lee et al., 2016 ) proposes that DA 
neurons rebound —that is, reactivate phasic DA signaling —at the 
termination of fearful experiences, putting a “brake ” on fear-excitation 
by supplying intrinsic safety signals. This increase in phasic DA also 
explains why our flow-condition motorcyclist does not have fearful 
memories, as the amygdala-connected, ECS-modulated, DA neurons in 
the mPFC, via connections to the amygdala, play a crucial role in sup-
pressing hyperarousal and promoting fear extinction (Milad et al., 2009; 
Fenster et al., 2018 ). 
Concurrent to this flow-condition increase in DA signaling, activity 
in the endocannabinoid system is likely to further down-regulate the 
amygdala, thus promoting fear-extinction while reducing responses to 
conditioned fear cues and the retrieval of fearful memories (Atsak et al., 
2012 , Bitencourt et al., 2008 ). This would not happen in our trauma 
condition, which helps explain why PTSD sufferers show heightened 
activity in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex reflecting 
over-expression of this network and the experience of “hyper-vigilance ” 
(Szeszko and Yehuda, 2019 ). 
Additionally, work by Jasnow et al. (2013) shows that 
fear-extinction is a less robust process than fear-creation. In this process, 
inputs from the vmPFC and hippocampus activate when there is safety 
learning after fearful exposure (Hartley and Phelps, 2010 ), something 
that is likely to occur in our flow condition. The opposite is true for 
trauma, as reduced activation of the vmPFC heightens fearful responses 
and the creation of fear-based memories (Jovanovic et al., 2012 ). 
6.Summary 
The ideas presented herein suggest that there is a cortico-striatal- 
thalamic loop that governs the onset of flow. We have also proposed 
that the basal ganglia, thalamus, amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate 
cortex are involved. Activity in this loop is modulated by a combination 
of endocannabinoid, dopaminergic and noradrenergic signaling. More -
over, this hypothesis suggests that loop activation is downstream from 
the fight response and the arrival of a series of P300 waves or, at the very 
least, an increase of phasic DA in the VTA. More broadly, a “flow 
network ” is beginning to emerge where signals from the FPCN and 
reward structures are integrated (see also, Weber et al., 2009 ). In fact, 
and as argued earlier, it appears that the salience network facilitates the 
transition into the flow network (for an extended treatment, see Weber 
and Fisher, 2020 ). 
Overall, our exploration of a neurobiological account for the onset of 
flow includes various perspectives, including both neuroscientific and 
phenomenological ones. We believe that, by incorporating this account 
into a broader framework with other cognitive states —i.e., PTSD and the 
psychedelic state —we gain a deeper insight into the neurocognitive 
processes associated with flow. 
6.1. Open questions, future directions and research initiatives 
While flow ’s considerable impact on performance is widely docu-
mented, these effects are rarely accounted for in the neurobiological 
descriptions of the state. Yet any theoretical overview of flow should 
include the state ’s impact on cognitive performance, with specific 
attention paid to its impact on the following categories: (a) creativity, improvisation and innovation (Amabile et al., 2005; Csikszentmihalyi, 
1997; Doyle, 2017 ), (b) learning and education (Rathunde and Csiks -
zentmihalyi, 2005 ; Berka et al., 2007 ; Craig et al., 2004 ), (c) motivation 
and productivity (Bryce and Haworth, 2002 ; Csikszentmihalyi, 1990 ; 
Rheinberg and Engeser, 2018 ), (d) cooperation and collaboration 
(Sawyer, 2015 ; Shehata et al., 2020 ; van den Hout et al., 2018 ), (e) 
well-being, meaning, purpose and eudaimonic values (Bonaiuto et al., 
2016 ; Seligman et al., 2007 ; Csikszentmihalyi and Nakamura, 2014 ), (f) 
appreciation for nature/environmental awareness (Bonaiuto, 2016 ; 
anecdotally, also see Kotler, 2006, 2013 ), (g) empathy (Bachen et al., 
2016; Mesurado et al., 2016 ; Vaillant, 2008 ), (h) grit, perseverance, and 
burnout (Aust et al., 2022; Constantinescu et al., 2017 ; Salanova, 2006 ; 
Von Culin et al., 2014 ; Amabile and Kramer, 2007 ), (i) intuition (Bolte 
et al., 2003; Doyle, 2017 ; Jarvilehto, 2016 , see “Intuition and Flow ” in 
Flow Experience), and (j) perception (Sinnett et al., 2020 ). 
The theoretical model for the transition into flow outlined in this 
paper is unique in the literature as it lays out a neurobiologically plau-
sible explanation for the flow ’s onset thereby offering predictive insights 
and testable hypotheses — specifically, a set of neuro-markers that may 
be associated with flow onset and/or flow itself. First, this model pre-
dicts that flow comprises a unique pattern of brain network activation, 
distinct from other similar states of consciousness, e.g., hyperfocus, 
psychedelic states, and deep meditative states. If this is correct, then 
flow can be characterized as a phenomenologically distinct experience. 
Second, although current neuroimaging methods may not be able to 
ascertain whether some of these neurobiological mechanisms are at 
work during the transition into flow (particularly as described in our 
hypothetical situation), future technological advances (e.g., wearable 
functional near-infrared spectroscopy [FNIRS] or EEG devices) may 
facilitate the discovery of these mechanisms. Third, and perhaps most 
importantly, if contrasting neurobiological outcomes distinguish flow 
from traumatic stress, this would be particularly important as flow could 
be used as a possible therapeutic approach to PTSD, and resilience more 
broadly (see Tabibnia, 2020 ). As initial evidence pointing in this di-
rection, research shows that increased cognitive control (which flow 
seems to require) is associated with decreased PTSD symptoms (White 
et al., 2018 ). 
At the same time, there are several important questions that shape 
inquiry into the neural basis of flow. For instance, we have outlined 
numerous flow triggers that are thought to causally elicit the flow 
experience. Excluding the challenge/skill balance, the evidence for 
nearly all of these triggers is correlational. Therefore, the causal role of 
these triggers remains uncertain. Similarly, we cannot identify a single 
study that systematically manipulates all triggers to identify if all are 
simultaneously necessary to elicit flow. Said differently, the necessary 
and sufficient conditions that elicit flow require further investigation. 
Similarly, we consider the phenomenological characteristics of what 
it is like to be in flow (complete concentration, merger of action and 
awareness, time dilation, the vanishing self, a sense of control, autote -
licity). Csikszentmihalyi (1990) has argued that all six characteristics 
describe the flow experience. Here again, the evidence for these char-
acteristics is largely correlational, and based on retrospective-self report 
measures. There is a dire need to systematically, and experimentally, 
confirm the presence of all six characteristics during flow. 
One challenge is that this confirmation will largely rely on 
comparing self-reported measures for these six phenomenological 
characteristics, in a flow condition relative to non-flow conditions. Such 
an approach makes it possible to claim that a flow condition elicits more 
self-reported flow than a non-flow condition (for examples, see e.g., 
Huskey et al., 2018b,a, 2021 ; Keller and Bless, 2008 ; Ulrich et al., 2014, 
2016a,b, 2018, 2022 ). Defining flow in comparison to non-flow is use-
ful, but comes with its own challenges. How much self-reported flow is 
required to say that someone is truly experiencing flow? Surely the score 
should be above the scale mid-point. But by how much? And by how 
much on each of flow ’s six phenomenological characteristics? Are all six 
characteristics always present during flow? Right now, we do not have S. Kotler et al.

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 143 (2022) 104956
14good answers to these questions. 
All of these issues present important challenges for neuroscientific 
investigations of flow. This is especially true when we consider that most 
neuroscientific methods for linking neural response with psychology or 
phenomenology are correlational in nature (Ramsey et al., 2010 ). When 
considered in conjunction with concerns about reverse inference (Pol-
drack, 2006 ), it seems unlikely that neuroscientific investigation will 
offer clear solutions to these problems. Instead, if we are to better un-
derstand the neural basis of flow, then it is incumbent on flow re-
searchers to resolve these theoretical, conceptual, and mechanistic 
ambiguities. Ultimately, accomplishing these objectives will require 
careful experimental interventions (Alameda et al., 2022 ). Our paper 
lays a foundation for such inquiry.
