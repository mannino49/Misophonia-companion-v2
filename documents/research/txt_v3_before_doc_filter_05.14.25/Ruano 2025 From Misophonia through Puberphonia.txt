Abstract  
Autism  is characterized by distinct  patterns of social communication, interests, and 
behaviors. Gender incongruence  (GI) involves a mismatch  between one's experienced 
and assigned gender, often accompanied by significant distress  (i.e., gender dysphoria , 
GD). Recent studies revealed  that autistic individuals (AT) report G D more frequently 
than the general population (Wattel  et al., 2022) and are overrepresented in gender 
clinic settings. Autistic individuals also report hypersensitivity to certain sensory stimuli 
which can elicit distress. When this distress is triggered  by certain auditory stimuli (e.g., 
one’s or others’ biological sounds  such as chewing or swallowing) it is conceptualized 
as misophonia . While misophonia is not unique to autism and has not yet been 
conceptualized as a formal diagnosis, it appears to be highly prevalent in AT. We 
propose that a lesser studied phenomenon, puberphon ia, could exemplify an attempt to 
reduce the distress elicited by misophonia in a certain category of individuals.  
Puberphonia  is characterized by an unusually high -pitched voice, predominantly in 
teenage boys , and men , that can occur in the absence of identifiable physical al causes . 
The psychogenic aspect s of puberphonia are very little understood and we hereby 
propose several exploratory directions . On the one hand, we speculate that this may be 
an individual’s attempt at diminishing a distressing reaction (misophonia) to their 
deepening voice, and that this may in turn be an  indicator of unrecognized GD. Given  
that voice pitch has also been reported  to be higher in autistic males compared to 
controls, we further propose that AT is likely prevalent among cases of psychogenic 
puberphonia. Finally, we wish to draw attention to the lack of epidemiological data 
regarding puberphonia and its potential link to GD, misophonia and AT.  
 
Lay Summary  
Misophonia , a condition defined by experiencing distress in the presence of certain 
auditory stimuli (e.g., chewing or swallowing) produced by oneself or others, is 
frequently reported by autistic individuals (AT). At the same time, there is a higher 
prevalence of AT reporting gender dysphoria (GD) compared to the general population. 
Gender dysphoria is formally defined as  a mismatch between one’s assigned gender 
and one’s subjective experience. We hereby propose that those teenage boys and men 
who experience an unusually heightened pitch in their voice, a condition known as 
puberphonia , may attempt to address the distress (i.e., misophonia ) triggered by their 
deepening voice. In many cases, puberphonia is psychogenic  (i.e., no physiological or

medical causes can be identified ). We hypothesize that in these cases, puberphonia 
may be asso ciated with potentially unrecognized GD. We urge researchers to consider 
exploring the co -occurrence of GD and puberphonia and more broadly, their association 
with AT and misophonia.  
 
Introduction  
Autism Spectrum Disorder (AT) is currently conceptualized b y the DSM -5 (American 
Psychiatric Association, 2013) as a neurodevelopmental condition, formally 
characterized by difficulties in social communication, restricted interests, and repetitive 
behaviors, this last category also including hypo - or hyper -sensiti vity to sensory stimuli. 
These sensory sensitivities can elicit distress and further exacerbate social anxiety and 
social avoidance, already prevalent in AT (Montaser et al., 2023).   
A distinct category of auditory stimuli that can  trigger  particularly strong negative 
emotions  are bodily noises, such as chewing or swallowing, produced by oneself or 
others . Autistic individuals are among those who frequently report being sensitive to 
these stimuli (Rinaldi et al., 2023), which can further lead to social avoidance. This 
condition, named misophonia , has recently been formalized through expert consensus 
(Swedo et al., 2022).  
A peculiar phenomenon, puberphonia , also called mutational dysphonia  or mutational 
falsetto , reflects a failure in voice deepening in the absence of medical conditions, most 
frequently reported in boys going through puberty (Vuković & Ćalasan, 2021). While 
puberphonia and misophonia are distinct conditi ons, they appear to share  a common  
link to altered  auditory perception  and act as distressing emotional triggers.   
Voice characteristics are tightly linked to gender identity . Both voice pitch and gender 
identity display distinct characteristics in AT. It has been shown that pitch is higher in AT 
men compared to neuronormative ones, but lower in AT women compared to 
neuronormative ones  (Kissine et al., 2024). Gender identity is  also much more fluid in 
AT compared to the general population  (Kallitsounaki & Williams, 2023).   
In this commentary, we attempt to  draw a connection between these emerging patterns  
and argue that ( 1) psychogenic puberphonia warrants more comprehensive exploration , 
and (2) puberphonia may emerge as a key link between misophonia , gender 
incongruence  (GI), and AT.

Autism and Gender Incongruence  
Gender incongruence reflects situations when  individuals’ assigned and experienced 
genders do not align. Gender dysphoria  (GD) , as defined by the DSM -5, involves a 
marked incongruence between one's experienced and assigned gender that is 
associated with  significant  emotional  distress (Zucker et al., 2016). Recent  studies have 
shown a higher prevalence of GD and non -binary gender identities among AT 
compared to the general population (Kahn et al., 2023 ; Sumia & Kaltiala, 2021 ), with AT 
being overrepresented in gender clinic settings (Shimoyama & Endo, 2024). This 
suggests that  AT assessment and support services should be expanded to better cater 
to this profile.   
 
Voice and Gender Identity  
During puberty,  the human voice undergoes a remarkable transformation, with distinct 
differences between males and females. This change is a hallmark of adolescent 
development and can be both exciting and challenging for young people.  For boys, the 
voice change is typica lly dramatic and noticeable. As testosterone levels rise, the larynx 
grows significantly larger and thicker. The vocal folds, which were once short and thin, 
stretch and thicken, nearly doubling in length from about 8 mm to 16 mm. This 
substantial growth r esults in a voice that deepens by approximately one octave, a 
change that can occur rather abruptly (Harries et al., 1997).  
This process usually begins around the age of 12 or 13 and may take several years to 
complete, often finalizing between the ages  of 15 and 18. During this time, boys may 
experience a period where their voice becomes unpredictable, cracking or breaking 
unexpectedly. The voice may also take on a hoarse quality.  These sudden shifts in pitch 
can occur at inconvenient times, such as in the middle of a sentence or during a public 
speaking event, leading to self -consciousness and anxiety. This process can therefore 
be accompanied by frustration and embarrassment.  
Voice changes during puberty can have a significant impact on social relationship s and 
interactions. Adolescents identifying as transgender were more than 4 times as likely to 
report voice problems compared with cisgender adolescents in a recent survey of vocal 
health (Fujiki & Thibeault, 2024).  For boys, the dramatic deepening of the ir voice can 
be a source of both pride and embarrassment. As their voice breaks and cracks 
unpredictably, they may feel self -conscious speaking up in class or talking to peers, 
especially those of the opposite sex. At the same time, a deepening voice is of ten seen 
as a sign of maturity and masculinity , which can impact the boys’ social  and romantic  
relationships . In romantic relationships, voice changes can play a role in attraction and

confidence. A deeper voice in boys is often considered attractive, potentially boosting 
their confidence in romantic pursuits  (Hodges -Simeon et al., 2010) . 
 
Puberphonia and Misoph onia 
It has been estimated that the prevalence of puberphonia in the general population is 
approximately 1 in 900,000 (Vaidya & Vyas, 2006). While  a recent study ( Fujiki & 
Thibeault, 2024)  revealed that  non-binary individuals reported a 4 -fold higher 
prevalence of voice disorders compared to  cis-gender individuals , the prevalence of 
puberphonia specifically in non -binary populations is unclear.  
Puberphonia has a negative impact on males’  social and roman tic life (Besser et al., 
2023) and psychotherapy or surgical intervention is usually sought to align the voice 
pitch to a person’s perceived gender identity (Vuković & Ćalasan , 2021). Given that 
many of these cases are psychogenic, surprisingly little research has been done to 
explore the psychological correlates of puberphonia. For example, given that voice 
changes are naturally occurring through puberty due to sex and thyroid  hormonal 
changes (Afsah, 2024), one line of research that we argue warrants more attention 
would be to explore a potential link between puberphonia and GD. We believe that the 
first step would therefore be to explore the frequency of co -occurrence between  these 
two conditions.  
In psychogenic puberphonia, we argue that three  patterns are likely to  emerge . We 
speculate that puberphonia may be an attempt to address the misophonia triggered by 
one’s deepening voice , potentially due to (1) autistic traits that predispose the person to 
experiencing misophonia, (2) unrecognized and unaddressed GD, or (3) both.  Given the 
increased co -occurrence of AT, GD and misophonia, we propose that  psychogenic  
puberphonia may emerge  at the intersection of these three.  
 
Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenges  
We argue that it is crucial to explore the likelihood that individuals with both GD and 
puberphonia are also struggling with misophonia  related to their deepening voice. Given 
the extensive overlap between AT, GD and misophonia, how does puberphonia fit in 
this complex pattern ? (Figure 1)

Figure 1.  A proposed connection between 
puberphonia, as a possible way to cope with 
misophonia as sociated with pubertal voice deepening. 
We hypothesize that this might be a way to cope in 
individuals who experience GD. We further hypothesize 
that AT might be overrepresented as well in those who 
exhibit puberphonia, given the extensive overlap 
between AT, GD, and misophonia.  
 
More epidemiological research is necessary to explore the co-occurrence of AT, GD 
and puberphonia, and the psychological correlates of puberphonia. Presently, we can 
merely speculate that puberphonia, misophonia  and GD might be different facets of a 
complex phenomenon that could  be overrepresented in AT , a group characterized by  
unusual voice  pitch range and variability compared to  controls (Asghari et al., 2021). We 
hope that this commentary serves as a call for  action for the research community to fill 
in the knowledge gaps that we have hitherto highlighted.  
We further argue that t he phenotypic complexity of AT justifies the necess ity for 
developing individualized approach es to diagnosis and subsequent support. To the 
extent that it is possible for the clinicians to explore additional facets of individual 
complexities ( i.e., if clients and/or their caretakers are able to report on additional 
experiences), we argue that this should become the default approach to A T diagnosis. 
Other authors have previously argued that individuals seeking an AT diagnosis are 
better served by a neuro -affirmative approach that takes into account gender identity as 
well as other frequently associated conditions such as attention deficit  hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), intellectual disability (ID), trauma, and more (Hartman et al., 2023). 
We argue that this assessment should also cover misophonia, given the high number of 
AT individuals who report such sensory processing challenges. Especi ally given that 
misophonia can have a negative impact on a person’s quality of life and reinforce social 
anxiety and withdrawal, a broader scope for AT assessment would not only help explain 
the observed or reported behaviors, but also inform individualize d support plans.  
Gender identity has not traditionally been part of the diagnostic work -up for AT. The 
standard dimensions for AT diagnosis focus on social, emotional, language, 
communication, cognitive, movement, and physical development milestones, with  little 
emphasis on gender -related aspects. This oversight can lead to missed cues for gender 
identity challenges  in AT, resulting in unrecognized and unaddressed emotional . 
Additionally, conditions like puberphonia and misophonia may be overlooked, furthe r 
complicating the diagnostic process.

The approach to treating puberphonia seems to prioritize medical interventions such as 
uvula manipulation, resonance therapy or thyroplasty (Kumaresan et al., 2022), which  
aim to align the vocal characteristics of the individual with that individual's reported 
gender identity, thereby reducing social  stigma  and psychological distress. These 
therapies focus on modifying the voice to better match the individual's self -percept ion 
and social expectations. These approaches do not always work, in which case patients 
are referred to a psychotherapist (Vaidya & Vyas, 2006). What is more, some authors 
note that some patients can manifest a “resistance to using their new chest voice”,  in 
which case psychiatric help is sought in addition to the medical therapies (Dagli et al., 
2008) We argue that a psychological evaluation of puberphonia patients should be the 
first step, and not an after -thought, before opting for more invasive approac hes. 
 
Conclusion  
The intersection of AT, GD, puberphonia, and misophonia presents unique diagnostic 
challenges. Autistic individuals often experience heightened sensory sensitivities which 
can underlie some of the challenges they face  in social interaction s. These reactions 
could potentially contribute to the development or exacerbation of conditions like 
puberphonia and misophonia. Further investigation into the neurobiological 
underpinnings of these conditions in the context of AT could provide valuable i nsights 
into the etiology and potential treatment approaches  (Yoram et al., 2010).  
There is a consensus on the need for AT -specific accommodations in gender clinics  
(Cooper et al., 2023) . These accommodations can help address the unique ways in 
which AT, GD, puberphonia, and misophonia may intersect and impact an individual's 
experiences and needs.  In addition, they offer an optimal setting for researchers to 
explore the knowledge gaps regarding th eir co-occurrence.
