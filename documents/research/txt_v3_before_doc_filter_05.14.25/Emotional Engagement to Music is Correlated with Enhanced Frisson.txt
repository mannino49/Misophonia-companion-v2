## Introduction

## Methodology

## Discussion/Conclusion

- ❑ There is evidence that individuals who are particularly sensitive or intolerant to sounds are also more engaged or fascinated with positive sounds such as music 1
- ❑ Misophonia : an affective sound-processing disorder characterized by enhanced sensitivity to aversive sound stimuli, such as chewing, swallowing, breathing, etc 2
- ❑ Frisson: or musical chills, is an intense emotional response to music that can be characterized by goosebumps, a tingling sensation, or raised hair on the skin 3

## Purpose

Research question : Is there a correlation between an emotional engagement to music and enhanced frisson experience?

The purpose of this research is to investigate whether those who experience misophonia also have heightened affective reactions, such as frisson to music.

## Correlation between Emotional Engagement and Frisson Reactions

- N = 74 number of adults, in-person behavioral tasks

Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S) is a 6-item questionnaire measuring misophonia severity.

Goldsmith Musical Sophistication Index (GOLD-MSI) - 39-item questionnaire measuring six factors of musical sophistication: active engagement, perceptual abilities, musical training, singing abilities, and emotions 4

Button clicks - measures an affective physiological response to videos

- · Before their visit to the lab, participants were asked to provide songs which give them musical chills (goosebumps, raised hair on the skin, etc.)
- · Participants watched five frisson videos, if they provided us a song that gave them chills it was included. Participants were asked to click the spacebar each time they had a reaction
- ❑ In conclusion, a positive correlation was observed  between the emotional engagement sub-factor of the GOLD MSI and frisson reactions (R = .20). This indicates that listeners who experience frisson reactions are more likely to be emotionally engaged to music
- ❑ Also, a positive correlation between A-MISO-S and frisson reactions (R = 0.15) indicate that listeners who experience misophonic reactions are more likely to have emotional experiences in the context of music
- ❑ Future research should further examine the causes for these associations, whether they are specific to sound, and how they develop
- ❑ Future research would measure real time emotional reactions to videos using electroencephalography (EEG)
