 AUDITORY BRAINSTEM FUNCTIONING IN INDIVIDUALS WITH MISOPHONIA  1 
 2 
ABSTRACT  3 
Purpose  4 
Misophonia is not investigated much  from  an audiological perspective. Our study aims to 5 
examin e the processing of the auditory retro -cochlear pathways in individuals with misophonia .  6 
Methods  7 
A cross -sectional study was conducted among university students who had misophonia. The 8 
revised Amsterdam Misophonia Scale  was used to determine the severity of misophonia . 9 
Participants were divided into mild and moderate -severe misoph onia and compared with the 10 
healthy control group. Auditory Brainstem Response testing was recorded from all the 11 
individuals with misophonia . The absolute latency, amplitude, inter -peak latency difference, and 12 
inter-rate latency difference were compared  between the groups.  13 
Results  14 
One-way ANOVA result showed no significant  difference in all the parameters of auditory 15 
brainstem response between the groups. These results are suggestive of normal brainstem 16 
processing in individuals with misophonia.  17 
Conclusion s 18 
The study concludes that the auditory  pathway up to brainstem areas is intact in individuals with 19 
misophonia. Further studies are essential on a larger population for generalizing the results.  20

 1.0 INTRODUCTION  26 
Misophonia is a disorder characterized by decreased sound toleranc e to specific sound stimuli, 27 
known as triggers  (Swedo et al., 2022) . The triggers can be visual, auditory, or motor , and they 28 
may cause both emotional and physiological reactions , including anxiety, increased heart rate, 29 
sweating, rage, and irr itation. The prevalence of misopho nia is high , ranging from 23.28 % (Aryal 30 
& Prabhu., 2022 ) to 49.1% (Naylor et al., 2021) . Geogr aphical region, variation in the sample, 31 
and methodology used could be the factors for variation in the prevalence rate.  32 
Misophonia has not been categorized as a separate disorder by the Diagnostic  and statistical  33 
manual (DSM -V) of mental disorders . This disorder  borders neurology, physiology, and 34 
audiolog y (Danesh &  Aazh ., 2020) , which can alter the physiological mechanism  of the sufferers  35 
and result in d istraction and annoyance. The lack of separate categorization hinders the 36 
recognition of the team memb ers involved in the assessment and management of misophonia  and 37 
hinders  the sufferers from seeking help.  38 
From the audiological perspective, less research is done to understand misophonia. Various 39 
researchers have shown abnormal activation of the cortical a uditory structures in individuals with 40 
misophonia  (Kumar et al., 2021;  Kumar et al., 2017;  Grossini et al., 2022)  through radiological 41 
investigations. In addition, studies have shown abnormal processing of the autonomic nervous 42 
system , including the limbic system , among misophonic  (Kumar et al., 2017) . However, no 43 
studies have reported abnormal neural processing of the retro -cochlear structures , including 44 
auditory nerve and brainstem structures , through radiological and audiological investigations. 45 
The pathophysiology of misophonia is not clear yet. However, various mechanism, origin, 46 
theories, and model has been explained in the literature  to explain misophonia  (Grossini et al., 47 
2022;  Aryal &  Prabhu., 2022) . To understand  misophonia fro m an audiological perspective, a 48 
new model has been developed which shows the linkage of misophonia with the classical and 49 
non-classical auditory pathway (Aryal &  Prabhu., 2022) .  50 
Auditory evoked potentials (AEP) examine the auditory nerve fibers' synchronous discharge and 51 
detect  abnormal neuronal activation . The waveform within the few ten millisec onds of the 52 
auditory evoked potentials is called auditory brainstem response (ABR). Auditory brainstem 53 
response (ABR) is the electrophysiological test th at measures the neural activation of the 54 
auditory pathway from the dorsal auditory n erve to the inferior colliculus (Picton et al., 2000) . 55 
Journal Pre-proof

3 
 Out of seven peaks of ABR, the first, third, and fifth peaks are clinically significant and arise 56 
from the dorsal par t of the auditory nerve, cochlear nucleus, and lateral lemniscus , respectively 57 
(Picton &  Durieux Smith ., 1978) . The shift in the latency of the Vth peak by greater than 0.8 58 
seconds, when the rate increased from 11.1/sec to 90.1/sec , indicates retro cochlear pathology 59 
(Picton and Durieux Smith ., 1978) . 60 
 61 
The primary aim of our study is to evaluate the processing of the retro -cochlear pathway in 62 
individ uals with misophonia  through  electrophysiological test s. Abnormal ABR is reported 63 
among individuals with sound disorders such as tinnitus and hyperacusis  (Sand and Saunte, 64 
1994) . Misophonia is a disorder that occurs in isolation or with other sound disorders  such as 65 
tinnitus, hyperacusis, and phonophobia. We can hypothesize that abnormal neural processing up 66 
to the brainstem level might occur among individuals with misophonia due to its co -existence 67 
with these disorders. Hence, we aim to evaluate the peripheral retro -cochlear auditory pathway in 68 
individuals  with misophonia by administering  ABR testing. The present study was designed to 69 
determine whether  significant differences exist in the ABR parameters in individuals with 70 
misophonia.  71 
 72 
2.0 METHODS  73 
The All India Institute of Speech and Hearing institutional ethical review board reviewed the 74 
study protocol,  and the ethical approval number was SH/ERB/2022 -24/37. All the participants 75 
were informed about the study procedure before enrolling, and written informed consent was 76 
taken from all the participants.  77 
2.1 Study participants  78 
The cross -sectional study was conducted among individuals with clinically significant 79 
misophonia, and a comparison was made with the healthy control group.  To find the prevalence 80 
and severity of misophonia,  the survey was conducted among the students of Mysore University 81 
using the  Revised Amsterdam misophonia questionnaire (Jager et al., 2020 ). The survey invited 82 
30 individuals with misophonia symptoms to the study. All the participants were 18 to 40 years 83 
Journal Pre-proof

4 
 old, with a mean age of 25 years (SD= 7.8). Most participants, 36 (90%), were female, and 4 84 
(10%) were male in the misophonia group.  All participants had normal hearing sensitivity in the 85 
conventional pure -tone a nd high -frequency audiometry ranges . The control gr oup consisted of 15 86 
participants  aged  20 to 40 years  (Mean age= 24 years, SD= 6 years ). The age and gender ratio 87 
was matched to the misophonia group. All the control group participants  have normal 88 
audiograms in both conventional and high -frequency ranges. All the participants in the 89 
misophonia group had a history of misophonia for at least three years without any psychiatric 90 
and auditory disorders co -morbidities. In addition, only participants without any middle ear, 91 
cardiovascular, or neurol ogic illness, no history of acoustic trauma, and no ototoxic medication 92 
were included in both groups.  Participants with hearing loss and other psychiatric and neurologic 93 
co-morbidities were excluded from the study.  94 
 95 
2.2 Apparatus and Procedure  96 
A detailed p hysical examination was done , including case history , otoscopic  examination, and 97 
general health examination. The revised Amsterdam misophonia questionnaire has been used to 98 
categorize mis ophonia into different severity range s (Jager et al., 2020 ). The questionnaire has 99 
ten questions with a score ranging from 0 to 40. The score 0 –10 are considered subclinical 100 
misophonia symptoms, the score of 11 -20  are rated as mild misophonia, 21 -30 as moderate to 101 
severe misophonia, and 31 -40 as severe to extreme  (Jager et al., 2020 ).  102 
 A hearing  assessment was done using a Garson  Stadler audio star  pro using ANSI guidelines 103 
(Frank., 1997) . The supraaural -49 headphone was used for the air conduction testing of the 104 
conventional pure tone audiometry , and the Radio -ear B -71 bone vibrator was used for the bone 105 
conduction testing. Similarly, Sennheiser  circumaural HDA200 headphone was used for high - 106 
frequency audiometry.  All the audiological tests were done in the soundproof roo m following the 107 
ANSI guidel ines (Frank., 1997) . 108 
The frequencies from 250  Hz to 8 kHz were taken to determine  the Air conduction  threshold . 109 
Similarly, the frequencies from 250Hz to 4 kHz were taken for the bone conduction testing. The 110 
four frequency averages of 500Hz, 1 kHz , 2 kHz , and 4 kHz  were taken to determine  the 111 
Journal Pre-proof

5 
 threshold of each ear. As  the criteria for normal hearing, an average air conduction value of 15 112 
dB HL or less was taken  (Olusanya et al., 2019) . High -frequenc y audiometry was done for the 113 
frequencies from 9 kHz to 1 6 kHz. The six frequency average of 9 kHz, 10 kHz, 11.2 kHz, 12.5 114 
kHz, 14 kHz, and 16 kHz was taken to determine the threshold . 115 
Biologic Navigator Pro equipment was used to record auditory  brainstem response (ABR)  for all 116 
the participants. The recording was done in the soundproof room following the ANSI guidelines  117 
(Frank., 1997) . The participants were instructed about the procedure and aim of the test before 118 
starting the recording. The participants were asked to sit in the reclining chair and ensure they 119 
were comfortable enough to begin the test. The participants were made ready for the test with 120 
proper cleaning , and they were instructed to sleep and relax during the entire testing to minimize 121 
the artifact and sta bilize the electroencephalogram.  122 
The single -channel recording was done in all the participants with vertical electrode montage. 123 
Test ear (A1 or A2) was used as the inverting electrode site ( -), the Upper forehead (Fpz) was as 124 
the non -inverting electrode (+), and the contralateral ear of the test ea r was used as the common 125 
ground electrode site using the 10 -20 international electrode site classification  (Homan et al., 126 
1987) . Cup electrodes were used for recording all the participants. Electrode Impedance of 3kΩ 127 
and inter -electrode impedance of 1kΩ wa s maintained during the entire recording for all the 128 
participants. To  deliver the stimulus, Radio ear Insert -3A was used as the transducer. The click 129 
stimulus of 100 -microsecond duration was used as the stimulus at the intensity of 90 dB SPL . 130 
The recording was done at two different rates , 11.1/s , and 90.1/s , with rarefaction polarity.  131 
The acquisition parameters used were a filter setting of 100Hz to 1500Hz, amplification of 132 
1,00,000 times, a time window of 10 milliseconds, and artifact rejection of 23.6µV  (Hurley., 133 
2012) . The averages of 1500 were taken, and consistency was maintained for all the participants 134 
included in the study. During the entire testing procedure, it was made sure that the 135 
electroencephalogram (EEG) was within the standard lim it. The recording was done in all the 136 
participants with replication for reproducibility. The three experienced audiologists identified the 137 
peak s following the criteria established in the literature, with visualization of three sequences of 138 
the peaks as I -III-V using Bio -logic Auditory Evoked Potentials (Ver 7.2.1) software. The 139 
absolute latency , interpeak latency, inter -rate latency difference , and amplitude of ABR peak, i.e. 140 
I, III, and V were calculated and analyzed between the misophonia and control grou p. 141

 The IBM SPSS program, version 25.0, was used for the data analysis . The Sapiro -Wilk 142 
test was carried out to determine the normality. As the data followed a normal distribution, a 143 
parametric one -way ANOVA test was conducted to find the significant differences between the 144 
misophonia and control groups. The dependent variables were the latency and amplitude of all 145 
the peaks, and the independent variable was the severity of misophonia. The criteria for 146 
statistical significance was set at a p -value of l ess than 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval  147 
3.0 RESULT S 148 
3.1 Misophonia Severity  149 
We found that 10  participants had moderate to severe misophonia with scores ranging from 21  to 150 
30, 5 participants had severe to extreme misophonia with a score ranging from 31  to 40, and 15  151 
participants had mild misophonia with a score ranging from 11 -20. Altogether, 30 participants 152 
were included in the misophonia group. All 15 participants who were included as the control 153 
group had a score of zero on the revised RAMISO -S scale . We did not have enough data for the 154 
misophonia group  to form the three group s; hence, we divided participants into two groups, one 155 
mild misophonia group and another moderate -severe misophonia group. The mild misophonia 156 
group had a score of 15.93 (SD=2.89 ), and the moderate -severe misophonia group (N=15) with a 157 
mean score of 25.86 (SD=4.98) . All the participants included in the study had misophonia for 4.9 158 
years with a variation from 3 to 8 years (Mean=4.93 , SD=1.52) . 159 
 160 
3.2. Audiological evaluation  161 
The physical examination showed a normal appearance of the external and middle ear in all the 162 
participants. All the participants had normal health conditions with normal hearing.  The result 163 
did not show a statistically significant difference in the air con duction threshold between the 164 
study and control groups with (F (2.42) = 0.587, p= 0.561) for the right ear and with (F (2.42) = 165 
2.540, p= 0.091) for the left ear. Similarly, w e did not find statistically significant differences 166 
between the study and contro l groups for the bone conduction threshold also , with (F (2.42) = 167 
0.678, p= 0.66) for the right ear and with (F (2.42) = 1.540, p= 0.08) for the left ear  as illustrated 168 
in table 1.  169

 The results of the high -frequency audiometry showed the presence of normal hearing in the high - 170 
frequency range from 9 kHz to 16 kHz for all the participants . The ANOVA result did not show 171 
any significant difference in the mean high -frequency average betwee n the groups, with (F (2.42) 172 
= 3.401, p= 0.062) for the right ear and with (F (2.42) = 1.769, p= 0.183) for the left ear . Table 1 173

3.3 Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) Findings  177 
The result of the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) was analyzed to determine the neural 178 
processing in the retro -cochlear pathway . During the entire recording, elect rode impendence was 179 
less than 3kΩ , and the inter -electrode differen ce was less than 1 kΩ (Hurley., 2012) . The absolute 180 
latency,  the amplitude of all the peaks , interpeak latency, and latency difference at the different 181 
rate was analyzed for all the participants . 182 
 183 
Absolute Latency  184 
Absolute latency of I, III, and Vth peaks was analyzed between the groups at two different rates: 185 
11.1/sec and 90.1/sec. For the rate of 11.1/sec, t he result of the one -way ANOVA showed no 186 
signi ficant differences between the group for the absolute latency values of the I peak,  III peak, 187 
and V peak for both ears (p>0.05). Similarly, for the rate of 90.1 /sec, we did not find a 188 
significant difference between the groups for the absolute latency values of the I peak,  III peak, 189 
and V peak for  both ears p>0.05) . The mean and standard deviation of all the peaks of ABR , 190 
along with the one -way ANOVA result , are illustrated in Table 2 and Table 3 for the right ear 191 
and left ear , respectively.  192

 194 
Amplitude of peaks  195 
The amplitude of all the peaks of ABR was analyzed between the groups. The rate used was 196 
11.1/s.  The mean value and standard deviation of all the peaks of ABR are illustrated in Figure 2 197 
and Figure 3 , respectively.  198

The result of the one -way ANOVA showed no significant differences in the amplitude of all the 201 
peaks  for both ears . For the amplitude of the I peak, no significant difference was found between 202 
the groups with (F (2.42 ) = 1.62, p= 0.21 ) for t he right ear and (F (2.42) = 1.52, p= 0.3 1) for the 203 
left ear . Similarly, for the amplitude of the III peak, we did not find any significant difference 204 
between the groups with (F (2.42 ) = 1.19, p= 0.32 ) for the right ear and (F (2.42) = 1.52, p= 205 
0.31) for t he left ear.  For the Vth peak also, no significant differences were found between the 206 
groups with (F (2.42) = 0.31, p= 0.74) for the right ear and (F (2.42) = 0.35, p= 0.71) for the left 207 
ear. 208 
Interpeak latency (IPL)  209 
Interpeak latency difference of I and III peaks, III and Vth peak, and I and Vth peak were 210 
analyzed  at the rate of 11.1/s  between the control group and the misophonia group.  The result of 211 
the one -way ANOVA showed no significant difference between the groups  for all the interpeak 212 
latency differ ences (p>0.05) as illustrated in Table 4.  213

  215 
 Inter -rate latency difference  216 
 The absolute latency difference at two rates: 11.1/s and 90.1/s , was calculated by subtracting the 217 
absolute latency value at 11.1/sec from 90.1/sec. The compar ison was made between  the two 218 
misophonia groups and the control group. The mean value of absolute latency difference at two 219 
different rates (11.1/s and 90.1/s) was found to be less than 0.8ms suggesting no indication of 220 
retrocochlear pathology. The mean and standard deviation value for rate differences values for 221 
all the peaks along the ANOVA result is illustrated in Table 5.  The result of the one -way 222 
ANOVA showed no significant dif ference in the rate difference values for all the peak s (p>0.05) , 223 
as illustrated in Table 5.  224

 225 
DISCUSSION  226 
Our study aimed to analyze the processing of the brainstem  pathway in individuals with 227 
misophonia through auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing. The ABR was performed on all 228 
the participants , and responses were analyzed between the control and misophonia groups. The 229 
absolute latency of the peaks, amplitude, interpeak latency differences, and inter -rate latency 230 
differences was calculated and analyzed amon g all the participants recruited in the study. The 231 
comparison of the ABR parameters of the misophonia group with the control group showed no 232 
significant differences in all the  ABR  parameters. These results showed the presence of normal 233 
retro -cochlear pathway processing up to the brainstem struct ures among individuals with 234 
misophonia.  235 
Misophonia is a disorder that may occur alone or in association with other auditory disorders , 236 
such as tinnitus and hyperacusis (Dozier., 2015) . There has been growing interest in the use of 237 
ABR among individuals wit h tinnitus. Various studies have shown an increase in latency and a 238 
decrease in amplitude of all the peaks  of ABR among individuals with tinnitus  (Sand &  Saunte ., 239 
1994 ; Keith &  Greville, 1987) . As misophonia occurs in association with these auditory 240 
disorders, we hypothesized that there could be some differences in neural processing at the level 241 
of the peripheral nervous system among individuals with misophonia. However, the result of o ur 242 
Journal Pre-proof

10 
 study showed no significant differences in the ABR parameters a mong individuals with 243 
misophonia , rejecting the hypothesis . The difference in these findings among tinnitus and 244 
misophonia showed a difference in pathophysiology among these disorders. However, this is the 245 
first study of this kind among misophonia and need s to replicate the findings in the future , taking 246 
a larger sample size.  247 
Various neuroimaging investigations using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has 248 
shown abnormal processing of the various auditory cortical areas , including non -classical 249 
auditory pathway among individuals with misophonia  (Kumar et al., 2017 ; Brout et al., 2018) . 250 
However, no neuroimaging studies have reported abnormal processing of sub-cortical  auditory 251 
pathways , including brainstem areas , among individuals with misophonia. Our study also 252 
support s neuroimaging studies' findings s, suggesting normal processing of retrocochlear 253 
structures among individuals with misophonia. These findings  from  the electrophysiological and 254 
neuroimaging investigation suggest retro -cochlear structure abnormalities are absent among 255 
individuals with misophonia.  256 
In our study, we assessed the ABR using both low and high stimulation rates . Both rate levels 257 
did not show any significant difference in the ABR findings among the control and m isophonia 258 
groups . These results suggest the presence of normal neural synchrony up to brainstem areas 259 
among individuals with misophonia. However, our study could not obtain frequency -specific 260 
ABR responses  as we used the click  stimulus  (Robier et al., 1992 ). Hence, there is a need to 261 
carry out studies in the future using frequency -specific stimuli.  262 
 263 
CONCLUSION  264 
Our study concludes normal processing of the retro -cochlear pathway among individuals with 265 
misophonia. However, this is the first study of this kind, and further studies on the larger 266 
population are needed to generalize  the results. The result of our research  would be the baseline 267 
for all the neurologists, audiologists, and psychologists working in misophonia to understand the 268 
disorder.  269

 Limitations and future directions  271 
There is a shortage  of studies in the literature assessing misophonia from the audiological 272 
perspective. Our study showed normal auditory brainstem responses in individuals with 273 
misophonia. The result of our research  using the electrophysiological measure supports the 274 
findings of the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies reported in the literature. 275 
However, this is the first study of this kind from the audiological perspective. We need to 276 
validate our findings  in the future, taking a larger sample size. In addition, we need to carry out 277 
studies in the future using frequency -specific stimuli. Furthermore, our study used the most 278 
widely used questionnaire RAMISO -S for assessing misophonia and its severity, which is 279 
unavailable in the native Indian language and population. There is a need to carry out the study 280 
in the future, using the questionnaire standardized in the native language.  281
