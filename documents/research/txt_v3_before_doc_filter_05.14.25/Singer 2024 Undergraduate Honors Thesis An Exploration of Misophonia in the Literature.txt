AN EXPLORATION OF MISOPHONIA IN THE LITERATURE  2 
 
Abstract  
Misophonia is a disorder that elicits  an extreme negative reaction to specific auditory and visual 
stimul i.  Trigger ing stimuli , which are often human produced, provoke an array of symptoms  
including  heightened  negative emotions along with  autonomic nervous system responses .  
Despite being a r elatively common disorder, misophonia is still inadequately recognized  and is 
often classified under  conditions such as obsessive -compulsive  disorder  and anxiety .  No cure for 
misophonia  currently exists , but there are many treatments and coping mechanisms used by 
people with misophonia to ease their  symptoms.   This comprehensive review synthesizes current 
research  on misophonia, exploring underlying mechanisms,  comorbiditie s, diagnostic 
methodologies, and treatment efficacy .  By combining  valuable insights , this review aims to 
enhance awareness and understanding of this often -overlooked disorder.

          Misophonia is a disorder in which specific sounds and visual stimuli cause an extreme 
negative reaction.   It is estimated t hat around 20% of the general population  are affected by  this 
relatively unheard -of disorder  (Ferrer -Torres & Gimenez -Llort,  2022 ; Kılıç et al., 2021 ; Swedo et 
al., 2022 ).  Bothersome stimuli, referred to  as triggers,  are both auditory and visual  and are often  
human produced .  Each person has their own unique combination of triggers that may include 
chewing, sniffling, tapping, or leg swinging (Rouw & Erfanian, 2017 ).  An array  of symptoms , 
including negative emotions and the fight or flight reaction of the autonomic nervous system , 
occur when a trigger is sensed.   Symptoms are often exacerbated in familiar contexts but are 
independent  of loudness  and pitch  (Edelstein et al., 2013) .  Misophonia is differentiated from  
simply “disliking” a sound in the experience of  disproportionate level s of negative emotions 
toward a person  producing triggers  (Edelstein et al., 2013) .  Misophonia has a spectrum of 
severity in which everyone’s experience with the disorder is unique.   People may perceive their 
misophonia  symptoms  as less severe than others who experience the same triggers  and 
symptoms , resulting in varying degrees of severity of this disorder  (Rosenthal et al., 2021) .   
          The present review is aimed at examining  many aspects of misophoni a including  the 
etiology of the disorder,  co-occurring disorders , distinct  evaluations  used to identify misophonia 
in individua ls, and the prevalence of treatments.   This review will compil e valuable and relevant 
research evidence on the subject to inform  the general population of misophonia , which is still a 
relatively unknown disorder.      
Onset and Etiology  
          While the exact etiology  of misophonia remains to be elucidated , there ha ve been many 
studies that aim to investigate  the symptomatology of misophonia and its causes.  Misophonia 
primarily emerges in childhood and is more prevalent in younger populations  (Potgieter et al.,

AN EXPLORATION OF MISOPHONIA IN THE LITERATURE  4 
 
2019; Savard et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2014) .  Kılıç et al. (2021)  found that individuals with 
misophonia generally  report  that their symptoms emerg ed in childhood or adolescence.  The 
onset is usually associated with traumatic memories of triggering situations in which they 
experienced unpleasant feelings toward sounds created by family members  (Schröder et al., 
2013; Taylor, 2017) .  It is still unclear whether misophonia is more prevalent in females than 
males, as previous rese arch has suggested a higher presence of misophonia in the female 
population  (Kılıç et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2014) .  However, studies that suggested  higher 
prevalence  of misophonia  in females were based on samples  that were  predominantly  composed 
of females , which brings the sex differences into question  (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; 
Kılıç et al., 2021; Savard et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2014) .  Further research is needed to clarify  true 
disparities  in the prevalence of misophonia between genders .  
          Hereditary and genetic links to misophonia have been suggested, but there is a lack of 
substantial  research to support this hypothesis.  Rouw and Erfanian  (2018) found that one third 
of participants in a large -scale misophonia study had family members with similar misophonia 
symptoms.  Sanchez and Silva (2017 ) studied a family in which 15 members were said to be 
affected by misophonia.  They suggest ed that the incidence of misophonia in 15 family members 
was likely  influenced  by autosomal dominant inheritance  (Sanchez & Silva, 2017) .  Other 
studies have also  found a n association  between the presence of misophonia and a  family history 
of the disorder  (Edelstein et al., 2013; I. Jager et al., 2020; Kılıç et al., 2021) .  Despite these 
findings, the available  evidence does not support  a definitive  hereditary or genetic association  to 
misophonia , demonstrating a need for  further exploration  in future research (Swedo et al., 2022) .  
          People with misophonia generally have  normal hearing , suggesting the disorder may be 
neurological rather than auditory (Potgieter et al., 2019) .  Aberrant  brain connections and

AN EXPLORATION OF MISOPHONIA IN THE LITERATURE  5 
 
function s have  been proposed as a potential cause of misophonia.   Stronger  functional brain  
connections between the autonomic  nervous system  (involved in regulating involuntary bodily 
processes)  and the limbic system  (responsible for regulating  emotion s) are associated with  the 
conditioned reflex response s to patterns of sounds  (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014) .  This 
overactivity of regulatory systems  is entirely subconscious , demonstrating a potential 
explanation as to why it is  difficult for people with misophonia to regulate their emotional 
reactions to everyday sounds (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014) .  Another brain region involved in 
misophonia is the  orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) , which processes stimuli and assigns  emotions to 
sensory input  (Neacsiu et al., 2022) .  Hyperconnectivity  between the  OFC  and frontal brain 
regions  (involved in planning motor responses)  is unique to misophonia , as most other disorders 
are typically characterized  by hypo connectivity between the OFC and  other brain regions  
(Neacsiu et al., 2022) .  The hyperconnectivity between these two  brain regions may explain  the 
intense emotional response s to triggers  and the difficulty in controlling those responses .   
          Hyperactivity in the  supplementary motor area  (involved in motor learning and control ) 
and ventral premotor cortex ( involved in integrating sensory information  and motor planning ) is 
also unique to misophonia, which is different from  other disorders that typically exhibit 
decreased  activity in these areas  (Neacsiu et al., 2022) . The hype ractivity in these areas may 
explain  the common misophonic response of finding , mimic king, and  escap ing triggering stimuli  
(Neacsiu et al., 2022) .  Studies have also found that h yperactivity of the insula (responsible for 
perceiving sensation and emotion ) may be associated with the  dysfunctional  emotion regu lation 
in triggering situations  (Kumar et al., 2017; Neacsiu et al., 2022) .  The anterior insular cortex, 
which controls emotional awareness, empathy, and decision -making , is also hyperactive when 
experiencing triggers  (Kumar et al., 2017; Neacsiu et al., 2022) .  Additionally , hyperactivity in

AN EXPLORATION OF MISOPHONIA IN THE LITERATURE  6 
 
the amygdala  (processing emotion and fear)  may explain the association of triggering stimuli as 
“negative”  (Neacsiu et al., 2022) .  Hyperactivity of the insula and amygdala are also associated 
with comorbidities of misophonia; however, c urrent research does not suggest a causal 
relationship between misophonia  and any other conditions (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 
2022; Neacsiu et al., 2022; Schröder et al., 2013) .   
Comorbidities  
          Because the etiology of misophonia is still widely unknown , no criteria for the 
differentiation of misophonia and other disorders has been established.  Misophonia may co -
occur with other psychologic al and auditory disorders including any combination of obsessive 
compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, attention deficit disorder, depression, autism spectrum 
disorder, post -traumatic stress disorder, tinnitus, and hyperacusis; however, it is important to 
recognize misophonia’s distinct symptom atology separate from these disorders, warranting 
classification as its own distinct disorder (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Potgieter et al., 
2019; Swedo et al., 2022) .  The most prominent comorbidities of misophonia are OCD and 
anxiety (Barahmand et al., 2023; Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Neacsiu et al., 2022) .   
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder  
          OCD is the most frequently associated comorbidity with misophonia and the two disorders 
are often studied concurrently (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Potgieter et al., 2019; 
Schröder et al., 2013) .  Many of the evaluation  methods  for misophonia were developed based on 
OCD assessment scales (Siepsiak et al., 2020) .  Misophonia is  often categorized within the 
obsessive -compulsive spectrum of diagnostic manuals (e.g. the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition ); however, the correlations between these two disorders have 
been largely disproved (Barahmand et al., 2023; Schröder et al., 2013) .  OCD and misophonia

AN EXPLORATION OF MISOPHONIA IN THE LITERATURE  7 
 
overlap in symptoms such as disgust sensitivity, distress, avoidance, and obsessive thoughts.  
Despite these similarities, misophonia is distinguished from OCD in the sensation of aggression 
and anger, the varying ability to control reactions to triggers, and a wide range of differential 
reactions (Barahmand et al., 2023; Cavanna & Seri, 2015; Schröder et al., 2013) .  Additionally, 
contamination -based disgust and compulsive acts were found to be associated with OCD but not 
misophonic reactions (Barahmand et al., 2023) .  Hyperactivity in the insula and the amygdala is 
associated with both OCD and misophonia (Barahmand et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2017; Neacsiu 
et al., 2022) .  Another shared cognitive experience of OCD and misophonia is the perception of 
“imperfect” acts that elicit discomfort, which relates to previous findings linking misophonia to 
perfectionism (Barahmand et al., 2023) .  However, OCD is associated with dysfunctional 
connectivity between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (decision making and planning) and the 
insula, whereas misophonia is associated with dysfunctional connectivity between the 
ventromedial prefrontal cort ex and the insula (Barahmand et al., 2023) .  This is an important 
difference when considering the distinction of misophonia and OCD as two distinct disorders.   
Anxiety  
          When the brain is anticipating or sensing misophonic triggers, people with misophonia 
report feeling extreme stress and anxiety in response to those triggers (Mattson et al., 2023; 
Neacsiu et al., 2022; Swedo et al., 2022) .  It is important to distinguish that the “anxiety” felt by 
people with misophonia is not related to being afraid or fearful of triggers; rather, the anxiety 
experienced is a unique experience of intense emotional and physiological reactions and 
avoidance  behavior (Neacsiu et al., 2022) .  While anxiety itself can be a symptom of misophonia, 
fear and worry are distinguishing factors between misophonia and anxiety disorders (Barahmand 
et al., 2023) .  Anxiety disorders and misophonia both prompt emotional arousal, distress, and

AN EXPLORATION OF MISOPHONIA IN THE LITERATURE  8 
 
aggressive reactions in those affected (Barahmand et al., 2023) .  Previous research has found that 
public shame when experiencing a misophonic trigger as well as aggressive reactions to triggers 
is related to anxiety sensitivity (Barahmand et al., 2023) .  The anterior insular cortex is related to 
the cognitive and emotional responses elicited by anxiety and misophonia (Neacsiu et al., 2022) .  
However, hyperactivity of the insula is what primarily triggers the negative emotions and 
maladaptive emotional responses in misophonia (Neacsiu et al., 2022) .   
Evaluation  
          Before scientifically  validated studies established assessment measures  and criteria  for 
misophonia , clinical interviews were the primary way of assessing this disorder  (Potgieter et al., 
2019) .  In recent years, s everal testing  method s have been created  to systematically  assess  and 
diagnose individuals with misophonia.  The development of these  evaluations has resulted in 
improved recognition of misophonia as a distinct disorder.  Despite this progress , there is not a  
universally recognized or standardized evaluation tool for evaluating and diagnosing  
misophonia.   Commonly used evaluation tools will be summarized in this section.  
Misophonia Questionnaire  
          The Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ) was one of the first self -report questionnaires 
developed  by Wu et al. in 2014  to assess  the presence of misophonia symptoms and the severity 
of sound sensitivity in individuals.  The MQ  contains three  subsections  to evaluate the presence  
of specific triggers, the reactions elicited by triggers, and the severity  of the individual’s 
sensitivities  (Wu et al., 2014) .  This test was developed using many other established scales and 
questionnaires  including the Adult Sensory Questionnaire, Sheehan Disability Scale, and 
Obsessive -Compulsive  Inventory -Revised  (Abramowitz & Deacon, 2006; Kinn ealey & Oliver, 
2002; Shee han, 2000; Wu et al., 2014) .  The MQ  aimed to compile useful knowledge  from these

AN EXPLORATION OF MISOPHONIA IN THE LITERATURE  9 
 
evaluations  that is  applicable to the diagnosis of misophonia symptom atology.  On the 
Misophonia Severity subsection , which ranges from 1 -15, ratings  of 7 or above indicated 
clinically significant misophonia symptoms.   Rosenthal et al . (2021)  found the MQ had  good 
specificity  of 72%  and sensitivity  of 78% for determining clinical misophonia  (Rosenthal et al., 
2021) .  The population  used to  validate this test was a university sample , bringing the 
generalizability of the study into question .  Despite these constraints, t he MQ is one of the most 
common diagnostic measure s for this disorder .  It has been utilized  in numerous subsequent  
studies of misophonia .  The MQ  was one of the most influential  assessments in early scientific 
findings and is very well known within the misophonia community  (Rosenthal et al., 2021; 
Siepsiak  et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2014).         
MisoQuest  
          The MisoQuest  is another  self-report questionnaire  used to screen for  misophonia .  The 
diagnostic  criteria  of the MisoQuest  were  based  on the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale ( A-MISO -
S), which was  developed  by Schröder  et al. (2013) .  The MisoQuest  consists of  14 questions,  
using a five-point Likert scale  to evaluate self-reported reactions to specific sounds,  avoidance 
behaviors, and the impact on daily functioning .  On a  scale  ranging from  0-70, scores  of 61 or 
above  on the test indicate the presence of misophonia  (Siepsiak et al., 2020) .  Savard et al. 
(2022) found the  MisoQuest ha d good specificity  of 96%  but low sensitivity  of 66%.  The 
diagnostic criteria of the MisoQuest was based on the A -MISO -S criteria; however, more 
updated diagnostic criteria has been published since the creation of this evaluation  (Potgieter et 
al., 2019; Rosenthal et al., 2021) .  Nevertheless, the MisoQuest is a widely used evaluation  tool 
to assess misophonia (Rosenthal et al., 2021; Siepsiak et al., 2020) .

Duke Misophonia Questionnaire  
          The Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ) , developed in 2021, built upon previously 
established tests and definitions of misophonia to establish a novel set of diagnostic criteria and 
subscales.  The nine  subscales of this self -report assessment evaluate differential responses to 
triggers, coping  with triggers , impairment  in functioning , and severity of misophonia  (Rosenthal 
et al., 2021) .  These subscales can be grouped together into symptom severity and  coping 
composite scale s.  The DMQ subscales or  composite scale s can be used independently  – as 
opposed to administering the entire  assessment  – to evaluate specific aspects  of misophonia  
(Rosenthal et al, 2021) .  This allows researchers or clinicians to administer  the various sections 
of the DM Q as needed .  On the Impairment subscale , with possible scores ranging  from 0 -48, 
scores of 39 and above are considered clinical ly significant for misophonia  impairment  (Duke 
Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ) | Duke Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences , 
n.d.).  The DMQ was reported to have very good specificity  of 91%  and sensitivity  of 100%  
(Rosenthal et al., 2021) .  As research continues to progress, t he DMQ fails to  address the  current  
proposed diagnostic criteria for misophonia  (Rosenthal et al., 2021; Swedo et al., 2022 ; Williams 
et al., 2022) .  
Duke -Vanderbilt Misophonia Screening Questionnaire  
          One of the most recent evaluation methods published in 2022 is the Duke-Vanderbilt  
Misophonia  Screening Questionnaire (DVMSQ).  The DVMSQ  uses an algorithm that was built 
upon the revised diagnostic criteria proposed by Jager et al. (2020) and the consensus definition 
proposed by Swedo et al. (2022)  to determine clinically significant misophonia .  The aim of this 
evaluation me asure  was to apply the recently developed consensus  definition of misophonia into 
a relatively short questionnaire  that could be used in many contexts.  The test consists of 21

AN EXPLORATION OF MISOPHONIA IN THE LITERATURE  11 
 
questions, using a five-point  Likert s cale to evaluate symptom frequency and impairment caused 
by symptoms of misophonia  (Williams et al., 2022) .  The DVMSQ ’s diagnostic algorithm  
contains six  criteria for misophonia .  Individuals  who meet all six criteria are considered to 
exhibit  clinically significant misophonia.  The initial publication of the DVMSQ did not report a  
specific  value to classify  misophonia status, and therefore did not include specificity and 
sensitivity values  (Williams et al., 2022) .  While this is the  newest  evaluation of misophonia, 
further research is necessary to  validate the findings of  the preliminary study and to determine 
the specificity  and sensitivity  to misophonia (Rosenthal et al., 2023; Williams et al., 2022) .   
Treatment  
          While no cure for misophonia currently exists, various treatment approaches have been 
developed to decrease the severity of symptoms and emotional reactivity misophonia may cause. 
Therapy techniques such as Cognitive -Behavioral Therapy (CBT) , exposure therapy, and 
pharmacotherapy have been utilized to help treat misophonia.  Coping mechanisms such as ear 
plugs and headphones are also used as sensory distraction strategies to manage reactions to 
misophonic triggers.  It is important to note th at wh ile there are many treatment techniques used 
with patients for suspected misophonia, no official treatment protocol has been established.  
Cognitive -Behavioral Therapy  
          CBT  has been widely used by clinicians to help patients develop functional coping 
mechanisms to respond  to triggers.  This therapy targets the reactions of the autonomic nervous 
system  through modifying behavior  to control their reactiveness  (I. J. Jager et al., 2021) .  
Through self -management techniques , individuals  work to restructure their thoughts and 
behavioral reactions toward triggers so that triggers no longer accompany  the extreme emotional 
reaction th ey typically elicit  (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Potgieter et al., 2019) .

AN EXPLORATION OF MISOPHONIA IN THE LITERATURE  12 
 
Therapists separate the reaction from the trigger using various coping strategies such as deep 
breathing  and redirecti ng attention .  CBT may include short exposures to trigger sounds, also 
known as exposure and response prevention , wherein the patient is gradually exposed  to their 
triggers while practicing the adaptive techniques they learned in therapy to avoid overwhelming 
anger and anxiety  (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Mattson et al., 2023; Potgieter et al., 
2019) .  The thought behind exposure and response prevention  is to “habituate ” the patient with 
their triggers in an otherwise safe environment  and to buil d positive defensive reactions rather 
than negative ones  (Mattson et al., 2023; Potgieter et al., 2019) .  CBT has been proven effective 
in many studies of individuals with misophonia, but the efficacy  of the treatment after several 
months still needs further validation  (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; I. J. Jager et al., 
2021) . 
Support Groups  
          One of the most accessible strategies to help cope with misophonia is the use of support 
groups.  Support groups provide a space for people with misophonia to connect with each other 
and share information, stories, and challenges.  Examples of misophonia support  groups on 
Facebook  include  “Misophonia: Coping and Solutions,” “Misophonia Support Group,” and 
“Misophonia Treatment Tracker .”  Other support groups include those offered by soQuiet 
Misophonia Advocacy , the Misophonia Association, and MisoMatch  (MisoMatch - Going 
through Misophonia as a Community , n.d.; soQuiet Misophonia Advocacy , n.d.; Support | 
Misophonia Association , n.d.) .  Support groups are also utilized  by family members to help them 
better understand how to live and interact  with their loved ones  affected by misophonia.   Often it 
is challenging for people who do not have misophonia to understand the impact  and challenges 
faced by people who do have the disorder, so having a space to talk and listen provides unique

AN EXPLORATION OF MISOPHONIA IN THE LITERATURE  13 
 
learning opportunities  (Brout, 2023) .  The literature surrounding effectiveness of support groups 
for misophonia is mixed: Ghorbani et al. (2022) found that both o nline group -mindfulness and 
online group -CBT  were effective  in reducing misophonia symptom atology , while Smith et al. 
(2022) did not find significant value in support groups as a treatment approach . 
Pharmaco logical Treatment  
          Antidepressants to treat symptoms and comorbidities have been studied using case studies 
of individuals with misophonia.  These drugs have been  found  to be effective in decreasing the 
symptoms of misophonia, including anxiety  and distress  (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; 
Mattson et al., 2023) .  However, since these drugs have primarily been tested in patients with 
multiple conditions, the effect  pharmacological treatments may have on the wider misophonic 
population  remains unclear  (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Mattson et al., 2023) .  
Research is still developing within this field  as the misophonia community aspires  to find a cure .  
Various supplements and vitamins have been suggested as possible treatments for misophonia , 
particularly magnesium and vitamin B , within misophonia support groups and pages on social 
media  (Misophonia Treatment Tracker , n.d.).  However, it is important to note that no  scientific 
research on  the effectiveness of supplements and vitamins has been published , so they cannot be 
considered a reliable treatment option  at this time (General Health and Wellness , n.d.).  
On-Ear Sound Generating Devices  
          The use of on-ear sound generating devices have primarily been used to treat tinnitus and 
hyperacusis (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014) .  These devices , which resemble over -the-ear hearing 
aids, produc e a wide  variety of non-repeating fractal chimes , broadband noise, or nature sounds .  
Unlike hearing aids , these on-ear sound generating devices are not meant to amplify noise.  
Instead , they are used  to increase external auditory stimuli  entering the auditory system , which

AN EXPLORATION OF MISOPHONIA IN THE LITERATURE  14 
 
decrease s the perception of tinnitus and hyperacusis (Folmer & Carroll , 2006; Jastreboff & 
Jastreboff, 2014) .  The use of these devices has also been used to treat misophonia , as they help 
to increase “background noise” rather than  allowin g the brain to focus on trigger sounds 
(Johnson , n.d.).  An informal study  was conducted by n ine audiologists  in 2012  that showed out 
of 65 patients with misophonia who were fit with these devi ces, 85% found the devices 
beneficial in their emotion regulation and were less affected by triggers (Johnson , n.d.).  While 
further research is necessary to validate the efficacy of on-ear sound generating  devices in 
treating misophonia, they have promising effects  for people with misophonia, such as being able 
to tolerate a wider variety of listening environments (Johnson, n.d.)  
Sensory Distraction  
          Through the development of diagnostic criteria for misophonia, coping strategies have 
been identified that are widely used by individuals with misophonia.  These coping strategies are 
utilized  by individuals in many different contexts and do not require  the help of a doctor or 
therapist to employ  them.  The most common coping  mechanisms  are sensory distractions in 
which individuals use their surround ings to remove their focus from a trigger.   Jastreboff and 
Jastreboff  (2014) proposed that increasing sensory input when experiencing adverse trigger 
sounds decreases the intense response of the autonomic nervous system.   Earplugs, noise 
canceling headphones, and listening to music are ways to decrease the intensity  of auditory 
triggers (Cavanna & Seri, 2015; Edelstein et al., 2013) .  Self -distraction such as making another 
sound , creating  an alternate physical sensation (e.g. rubbing thighs, biting nails) , or focusing 
attention on a task  are other common coping strategies used to decrease the reaction caused by 
triggers (Edelstein et al., 2013; Rosenthal et al., 2021) .  The most proactive coping mechanisms 
used by individuals with misophonia are asking the person producing the trigger to stop or

AN EXPLORATION OF MISOPHONIA IN THE LITERATURE  15 
 
removing themselves from triggering situations , as these aim to avoid the trigger all together  
(Cavanna & Seri, 2015; Edelstein et al., 2013; Rosenthal et al., 2021) .   
Conclusion  
          Much remains  to be discovered about misophonia, but the existing research  helps to 
enhance  the understanding and awareness  of the disorder .  Etiology, comorbidities, evaluations, 
and treatments were discussed.  Through compiling research within this field, the current project 
has revealed  a more thorough  understanding of the mechanisms underlying this disorder .  Future 
research should continue to investigate the impacts misophonia has on those affected and how 
this disorder is specifically differentiated from simply disliking certain stimuli.  No cure 
currently exists for misophonia, so future research should also continue investigating the 
potential mechanisms that may improve the quality of life of people with misophonia.  
Misophonia is unique in that it is not something that can be seen or heard on the surface.  Often 
people silently endure its effects  and may feel ashamed about their condition .  Therefore , 
research should prioritize a wareness and advocacy to foster greater  openness, acceptance, and 
comfortability for those affected .
