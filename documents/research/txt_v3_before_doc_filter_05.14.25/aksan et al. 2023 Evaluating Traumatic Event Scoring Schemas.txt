Background: To prospectively chart pathways of risk and resiliency following childhood trauma studies need to 
address three limitations of prior work: 1) recruit beyond social service/ treatment settings; 2) include broad 
spectrum of trauma types and 3) cast a broad longitudinal measurement framework of both clinical diagnoses 
and traumatic exposures. The Texas-Childhood Trauma Research Network (TX-CTRN) is a multi-site collabora -
tion that addresses these limitations. In this baseline-only report, we examined domains of trauma and evaluated 
the concurrent predictive validity of various traumatic event scoring schemas for clinical diagnoses. 
Methods: Broad-base recruitment of 8–20 year-olds (N 1289) included trauma centers, emergency departments, 
pediatric and primary care clinics, and other community settings. Assessments were comprehensive and based on 
clinical interviews by trained research interviewers. 
Results: Factor analyses supported a five-factor solution of trauma domains including unintentional/acute, 
intentional/interpersonal, bullying, in-home versus community witnessed interpersonal harms. Trauma burden 
scoring schemas were examined for their predictive superiority. Domain-specific counts of traumas that met 
DSM-5 post-traumatic-stress disorder (PTSD) Criterion-A was the best overall schema in distinguishing among 
youth with no diagnosis, comorbidities, those with depression, suicidality, substance misuse, and PTSD. 
Limitations: There were no assessments of neglect. 
Conclusions: Findings largely aligned with earlier studies on the relative importance of intentional interpersonal 
traumas and showed bullying may be an important source of traumatic stress that independently adds to pre-
diction of several diagnoses and should be considered in clinical practice.   
1.Introduction 
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) including traumas are asso-
ciated with chronic medical conditions, mental illness, and substance 
misuse (Bellis et al., 2019 ; Hughes et al., 2017 ). The prevalence of two or more ACEs is estimated to be 35 % in North America with 30 to 40 % of 
anxiety and depression cases attributable to ACEs based on the same 
meta-analytic study (Bellis et al., 2019 ). However, the studies informing 
these estimates are retrospective in nature and narrow in scope, often 
neglecting highly prevalent childhood traumas such as traumatic loss,

95community violence, and natural disasters. Prospective, comprehensive 
studies of childhood trauma are needed to understand the pathways of 
adjustment after exposure to better delineate risk for and resiliency 
against psychopathology. 
Among the central issues in understanding the impact of trauma in 
pediatric populations is relying on a measurement framework that as-
sesses clinical outcomes broadly rather than narrowly. Studies that have 
prospectively examined trauma-affected youth have adopted a limited 
outcome measurement framework. Typically, clinical evaluation is 
limited to symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) (e.g., Kennedy et al., 2009, 2010), ratings of broad spectrum 
externalizing and internalizing symptoms (e.g., Briggs et al., 2021; Kisiel 
et al., 2014; Hogdon et al., 2019). This is informative but not a substitute 
for standard clinical interviews that can evaluate whether criteria are 
met for a broad array of diagnoses beyond those most commonly seen 
following trauma. 
Another central issue in understanding the impact of childhood 
trauma concerns how best to summarize responses from trauma expo-
sure checklists to facilitate an understanding of the clinical sequelae. 
Rasmussen et al. (2020) noted a simple count of event types from trauma 
screening checklists captures variety rather than actual count of trau-
matic events. Although event count and variety counts are intercorre -
lated, variety-based scores appear to show stronger associations with 
symptoms of PTSD. Reliance on cumulative trauma scores is common (e. 
g., Alisic et al., 2014) but this approach has garnered criticism because it 
assumes each traumatic experience contributes similarly to outcomes. 
Cumulative trauma counts can obscure identification and delineation of 
emotional and behavioral concerns specific to certain types of trauma 
(Briggs et al., 2021; Kulkarni et al., 2011; Putnam et al., 2020). Simi-
larly, complex trauma presentations demonstrate the unique sympto -
mology tied to chronic trauma and/or multiple trauma exposures rather 
than certain types of traumas (Maercker et al., 2022). 
Studies examining domains of trauma have shown factor analytic 
support for distinctions among trauma events. For example, the initial 
ACEs proposal for distinguishing household dysfunction (e.g., parental 
mental illness) and maltreatment (e.g., abuse) factors (Felitti et al., 
1998; Negriff, 2020) were supported by follow-up psychometric studies 
(Afifi et al., 2020; Mersky et al., 2016). Others have supported correlated 
but distinct physical and sexual abuse factors (Ford et al., 2014) or that 
parental loss/separation emerges as a distinct factor (Green et al., 2010; 
Mersky et al., 2016). Samples drawn from treatment-seeking youth in 
social service settings, the National Child Traumatic Stress Network 
(NCTSN) core data, have pointed to five domains: 1) maltreatment 
(neglect, emotional abuse, impaired caregiver, domestic violence, 
physical abuse), 2) acute trauma (injury, illness, traumatic loss/sepa -
ration, natural disaster), 3) community trauma (war/political violence 
in the U.S., school violence, community violence), 4) assault (sexual 
assault/rape, sexual abuse, physical assault), and 5) trauma based in 
international war contexts (Pynoos et al., 2014). The only other youth 
sample to our knowledge that examined factor structure in ACEs sup-
ported the original two factor solution among adolescents (Afifi et al., 
2020). 
Studies that capture traumatic burden in different domains have 
shown differential associations with mental health outcomes. For 
example, youth exposed to interpersonal traumas (i.e. sexual, physical 
abuse) had increased odds of major depressive, substance use, PTSD 
diagnoses and were also more likely to endorse delinquency and asso-
ciation with delinquent peers compared to youth exposed to accidents/ 
disasters and community violence (Ford et al., 2010). Several findings 
from the NCTSN also support complexity in clinical profiles of exposure 
to interpersonal traumas that include maltreatment, physical, sexual 
abuse compared to trauma burden in the acute domain or household 
dysfunction (Dierkhising et al., 2013; Hodgdon et al., 2019; Kisiel et al., 
2014). For example, interpersonal traumas were associated with PTSD, 
externalizing, and internalizing symptoms while household dysfunction 
was associated with externalizing only, acute trauma with internalizing only, and trauma from violence in the community was associated with 
PTSD and externalizing (Hogdon et al., 2019). These findings suggest 
domain-specific characterization of trauma may improve specificity in 
understanding risk and resiliency pathways. 
1.1. Present study 
Among the central limitations of the evidence to date is that findings 
primarily reflect samples that are receiving social services/treatment or 
are recruited from populations with exposure to specific traumas. 
Outcome assessments often lack standardized comprehensive screening 
for clinical diagnoses. Our goal in this study is to report baseline data 
from the Texas Childhood Trauma Research Network (TX-CTRN) which 
was designed to address these limitations. TX-CTRN was established in 
2020 as a multi-site collaboration to develop a state-wide registry of 
children and youth (8–20 years of age) who have experienced a trau-
matic lifetime event. Recruitment is broad and includes trauma centers, 
emergency departments, pediatric and primary care clinics, and other 
community settings. The goal of the registry is to inform trajectories of 
mental health and to develop models of risk and resilience after trauma. 
To that end, standard clinical interviews of the child are conducted at 
baseline to capture both trauma exposure and clinical diagnoses. As-
sessments are repeated every 6 months for 2 years to prospectively 
capture trajectories of both symptoms and additional traumas. 
Given the overarching goal of TX-CTRN, the study protocol relied on 
a comprehensive instrument, the Traumatic Event Screening Inventory 
(TESI-C; Ford et al., 2000) to assess history of witnessed and directly 
experienced 20 trauma types shown in Table 1. For each trauma item, 
TESI-C captures simple exposure, exposures that meet DSM-5 Criterion- 
A, and frequency of exposure to each type of event. Given the clinical 
sequelae of bullying in youth (Wagner, 2018; Winding et al., 2020), two 
simple exposure items were added regarding in-person and cyberbul -
lying (Table 1). 
Our first aim was to examine how the item-content of TESI-C may be 
organized with respect to ‘domains’ of trauma relying on confirmatory 
factor analysis of the frequency ratings of 20 items. We adopted a 
conceptually agnostic, item-content driven lens to ask the following 
questions: a) are typically intentional/interpersonal harms (physical, 
sexual abuse) distinct from typically unintentional harms (accidents, 
medical trauma, loss); b) are distinctions between witnessing vs directly 
experiencing harms supported; and c) does the context and manner of 
intentional/interpersonal harms produce additional distinctions in the 
latent factor structure? For example, we asked if bullying items and the 
single sexual abuse item were best thought of as distinct ‘domains’ of 
intentional/interpersonal traumas from the items that assess threatened 
or actual physical harms (i.e. item 2.1 through 2.4 in Table 1). We also 
asked whether witnessing violence in the home versus in the community 
were distinct. 
Our second aim was to rely on the domains identified in the factor 
analytic setting to generate various ‘scoring schemas’ and examine 
which schemas provided the ‘best’ prediction for concurrent diagnostic 
profiles from clinical interviews. Scoring schemas included both cu-
mulative count and domain-specific counts of trauma burden (e.g., 
intentional/interpersonal harms). We further differentiated scoring 
schemas by counting only those exposures that met PTSD Criterion-A 
and counting all endorsed exposures irrespective of Criterion-A. In 
addition, responses to “who was involved” follow-up query to TESI-C 
events (e.g., parent/caregiver, other family members) were included 
as predictors. Higher levels of parental or family involvement in the 
‘worst’ events across all interpersonal harms would be a marker of risk 
for persistent trauma whereas higher levels of non-family involvement 
may lack that persistency across time and context. We evaluated the 
strength of concurrent prediction in the following three settings: a) 
which schema distinguishes children without any diagnosis from those 
who have at least one; b) which schema predicts broad categories of 
disorders such as PTSD, depressive episodes/ disorders, suicidality N. Aksan et al.

96issues, anxiety disorders, externalizing, substance misuse, and serious 
mental disorders; and c) which schema distinguishes children with a 
single disorder from those who are comorbid for at least two disorders. 2.Methods 
2.1. Sample 
Recruitment for TX-CTRN occurred across 12 academic medical 
centers in Texas, including University of Texas (UT) Southwestern 
Medical Center, Baylor College of Medicine, UT-Rio Grande Valley, UT- 
Health Science Center at Tyler, UT-Health Science Center at Houston, 
Texas Tech University Health Science Center Lubbock, UT-Austin Dell 
Medical School, UT-Health Science Center at San Antonio, University of 
North Texas Health Science Center, Texas A&M Health Science Center, 
Texas Tech University Health Science Center El Paso, UT-Medical 
Branch. 
Inclusion criteria included: 1) youth have a history of trauma expo-
sure that fulfills DSM-5 Criterion-A for PTSD, and/or have experienced 
less severe but persistent forms of childhood trauma including bullying; 
2) between 8 and 20 years of age; 3) able to provide consent for 18–20 
year-olds, assent for those under 18 with parental consent; 4) able to 
speak and read English or Spanish; 5) function at a level that allows 
accurate completion of the assessment instruments; 6) willing to dedi-
cate appropriate time to complete scheduled study assessments. Exclu -
sion criteria included either the child or the consenting parent being: a) 
intoxicated; b) not alert/ oriented/ or coherent/ or medically unstable; 
c) exhibiting psychotic symptoms; or d) the child had pervasive devel -
opmental disorder/ moderate intellectual disability. 
Recruitment and follow-up assessments are ongoing at the time of 
the current report. For the current report, only the baseline data were 
extracted. 1289 participants completed the baseline assessments. 
Because 403 youth were older than 18 years and did not have a 
participating parent, we do not have information on parental/family 
income or parental age from this subsample. Among those who partic -
ipated with a parent, 854 parents indicated a mean age of 43.5 years (SD 
8.9 years) and the distribution of parental/family income for the 859 
parents who reported it were as follows: 20.2 % D$25,000, 21.6 % 
between $25,000 –$49,999, 27.6 % between $50,000 –$99,999, 17 % 
between $100,000 –$199,999, 7.9 % F$200,000, and 5.6 % indicated 
they did not know income. The participants were compensated $100 at 
baseline. 
2.2. Measures 
In the current report, we utilized the TESI-C (Ford et al., 2000 ), and 
two well-established interviews to characterize children's clinical diag-
nostic profile: MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Chil-
dren and Adolescents MINI-KID (Sheehan et al., 2010 ) and Clinician- 
Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5, Child/Adolescent Version (CAPS- 
CA-5; Pynoos et al., 2015 ). The MINI-KID is a well-established structured 
diagnostic interview used to assess the presence of several DSM-child 
and adolescent psychiatric disorders and risk of suicide. CAPS-CA-5 is 
a semi-structured interview to measure severity of PTSD symptoms. 
All three instruments were administered by trained research assis-
tants. Shahidullah et al. (2023) described the training and certification 
process for research assistants across the clinical sites. The interrater 
reliabilities were excellent. Median Kappa for TESI-C items was 0.79, 
median weighted Kappa for CAPS-CA-5 was 0.71. The major depressive 
episode and PTSD modules were evaluated for interrater reliability due 
to their clinical relevance in childhood trauma; the median Kappa was 
0.71 and 0.91 respectively on the MINI-KID. 
2.2.1. TESI-C 
TESI-C is a clinician-administered interview that assesses a child's 
experience of potential traumatic events, including injuries, hospitali -
zations, domestic violence, community violence, disasters, accidents, 
physical and sexual abuse. It is widely used with individuals aged 6–18 
(e.g., Choi et al., 2019 ). At the baseline visit it is used to identify lifetime 
traumatic experiences. When the participant did not endorse the type of Table 1

97event described, they were assigned a score of ‘0 never ’ on the fre-
quency rating scale (“How often did this happen to you”) for use in 
analyses. When the participant endorsed the type of event described, 
they were asked to think of the worst instance of that type of event and 
describe details. Descriptions were systematically queried for ‘who was 
involved ’ (e.g., parent/caregiver, family, non-family) and responses to 
these follow-up questions were counted across all TESI-C items as 
parent/caregiver, family members, and non-family members as three 
separate variables in the predictive analyses of aim-2. 
2.2.2. Data reduction for clinical/ diagnostic profile 
Several specific categories within the MINI-KID were combined to 
form larger clinical/ diagnostic profiles to facilitate robust inference 
with respect to clinically distinct problems of interest in trauma-exposed 
populations and reduce type-I error rate. Specifically, PTSD diagnosis 
from either the CAPS-CA-5 or the MINI-KID were pooled into a binary 
outcome of PTSD versus not, anxiety disorders from the MINI-KID were 
pooled into a binary outcome of anxiety-related disorders (i.e., gener -
alized anxiety, separation anxiety, simple phobia, social phobia, panic 
disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, agoraphobia) versus not, and 
distinctions among depressive episodes and/or disorders (i.e., major 
depressive disorder, recurrent, current etc.) were combined into a single 
category of depressive versus not. Similarly, four additional binary 
outcomes were formed by combining specific MINI-KID categories 
relevant to suicidality/ suicide behavior disorder versus not, external -
izing disorders (i.e., oppositional defiant, conduct disorder, attention- 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder) versus not, substance misuse (i.e., 
alcohol and substance use disorders) versus not, and serious mental 
illness (e.g., various bipolar disorders, manic/hypomanic episodes, and/ 
or psychotic disorders) versus not. Respondents who did not meet 
criteria for any of the specific diagnoses were pooled into a binary 
outcome of no diagnosis versus at least one diagnosis. Finally, we 
formed a binary comorbid outcome contrasting those with any single 
disorder with those who met criteria for at least two. In specifying 
children who had no diagnoses and those who were comorbid, addi-
tional specific diagnostic categories such as eating disorders, Tic/Tour -
ette's were also taken into consideration. 
2.3. Analytic plan 
Data cleaning and predictive analyses were carried out in STATA 
version 16.1 (StataCorp, 2019 ) and confirmatory factor analyses were 
carried out in Mplus 8.8 (Muth ˘en and Muth ˘en, 1998-2017 ). For the first 
aim, identifying domains of trauma from the frequency ratings for 20 
event types, we relied on confirmatory factor analytic methods. Because 
the distribution of the frequency ratings from the TESI-C were generally 
skewed, robust maximum likelihood was used and comparison of nested 
models relied on Satorra-Bentler scaling of chi-square. The scales of the 
latent factors were defined by fixing the respective latent factor vari-
ances to one, each of the 20 items were only allowed to load on their 
respective factor in a given model and no residual correlations among 
the items were permitted. Following Kaplan (2001) , we examined ab-
solute and relative model fit in the following ways: a) comparing 
improvement in fit among nested models with chi-square difference 
tests, b) Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Compar -
ative Fit Index (CFI), Information Criteria (Akaike, AIC and Bayesian, 
BIC), and standardized root mean square error (SRMR). Latent factor 
correlations exceeding 1 or negative residual error variances were 
considered indications of a poor model and eliminated from further 
consideration. The CFA models began with a single-factor model and 
increased in complexity to address the questions raised in the 
introduction. 
Guided by the results of the CFA for domains of trauma, we con-
structed observed sums that could be readily computed in clinical set-
tings using binary endorsement of specific items, either simple exposure 
or DSM-5 PTSD Criterion-A to generate each ‘schema. ’ There were a total of six scoring schemas: 1) Domain-specific counts of individual 
items where Criterion-A was met; 2) domain specific counts of in-
dividuals items where simple exposure was endorsed; 3) count of all 
items where Criterion-A was met; 4) count of all simple exposures 
endorsed; 5) count of the number of domains where at least one item met 
Criterion-A and 6) count of the number of domains where at least one 
simple exposure item was endorsed. A series of logistic regressions then 
examined the concurrent predictive value of each schema along with the 
three subtotals for ‘who was involved ’ (parents/caregivers, other family, 
non-family) for broad diagnostic outcomes. We examined the relative 
performance of each ‘schema ’ in predicting: a) respondents who had no 
diagnoses from those who had at least one disorder, b) predicting broad 
categories of disorders among those who had at least one disorder, and 
c) comorbidity status among those who had at least one disorder. The 
criteria for selecting the best ‘schema ’ relied chiefly on information 
criteria (AIC), as different ‘schemas ’ had varying degrees of freedom. 
Finally, for the best schema, we examined whether the predictive value 
of the TESI-C scores were robust to statistical controls for demographic 
variables with an additional set of logistic regressions. 
3.Results 
Table 2 shows distributions for demographic and outcome variables 
and Table 3 shows the distribution of TESI-C items, and proportion of 
cases that met Criterion-A. The most commonly endorsed traumas 
included serious illness, or death of someone close to the child (72 %), 
being hospitalized (69 %), and experiencing threats of aggression (53 
%). The most commonly endorsed traumas that met DSM-5 PTSD 
Criterion-A included hospitalization (47 %), being involved in an acci-
dent (44 %), and sexual abuse (28 %).

an additional axis of witnessed versus experienced improved model fit 
(model M3). Because model M3 failed due to latent factor correlations

between witnessed versus experienced were only applied to intentional/

based on context and manner of harm (models M5, M6, M7). Nested 
model comparisons relied on Satorra-Bentler scaling of chi-square which 
are shown with reference to model numbers and the associated p-value. 
The best fitting model, M6, was consistent with a domain structure 
where intentional harms differed by both the manner and the context of 
harm. For example, witnessed intentional harms differed depending on the context: inside the home versus not. Among experienced intentional 
harms, bullying was distinct from other harms that included sexual 
abuse, physical assault/ attacks/ mugging/ kidnapping, and verbal 
threat of physical harms. We did not have sufficient evidence to support 
the distinctiveness of sexual abuse from other intentional experienced 
physical harms, and hence we accepted the five-factor model as the best 
and parsimonious option. The final retained factors included: 1) inten -
tional experienced harms (e.g., sexual and physical abuse), 2) bullying, 
3) intentional harms witnessed outside the home (e.g., witnessing 
community violence), 4) intentional harms witnessed inside the home 
(e.g., witnessing domestic violence), and 5) unintentional harms (e.g., 
accidents, illness). In all models, two items, being involved in an acci-
dent and being hospitalized, did not load significantly to the uninten -
tional harm latent factor. (TableS1). 
3.2. Aim-2: evaluating concurrent predictive value of TESI-C scoring 
schemas 
Guided by the results of the CFA, we constructed observed summary 
scores for six ‘scoring schemas. ’ These were: 1) Domain-specific counts 
of individual items where PTSD Criterion-A was met; 2) domain specific 
counts of individuals items where simple exposure was endorsed; 3) 
count of all items where Criterion-A was met; 4) count of all simple 
exposures endorsed; 5) count of domains within which at least one item 
met Criterion-A and 6) count of domains within which at least one 
simple exposure item was endorsed. The first part of Table 5 shows the 
univariate sample statistics for these summary scores. The maximum 
Spearman-rank correlation among the domain-specific ‘scoring schema ’ 
variables was 0.41 with Criterion-A totals and 0.46 with simple exposure 
totals which support specificity among trauma domains. The second half 
of Table 5 addresses the second aim: which scoring schema provides the 
‘best ’ concurrent predictive value for particular diagnostic profiles with 
a series of logistic regressions. In addition to AIC, Table 4 also reports the 
proportion of TESI-C predictors that significantly contributed to pre-
diction. Scoring schemas with the lowest AIC for the given outcome are 
bolded. (See TableS2 for full results). 
Results show that in distinguishing respondents who had no di-
agnoses at baseline from those with at least one diagnosis, scoring 
schema#1 has the lowest AIC. In addition, for scoring schema#1, three 
out of five PTSD Criterion-A trauma domain predictors were significant 
and one out of 3 predictors on ‘who was involved ’ were significant. 
Scoring schema#1 also had the lowest AIC for five out of eight di-
agnoses: PTSD, depression, suicidality, substance misuse, and comor -
bidity. Importantly, for outcomes where the scoring schema associated 
with the lowest AIC were different than schema#1 (i.e., schema #2 
through #6), two things were noteworthy. First the TESI-C trauma 
domain predictors were not significant for externalizing and second the 
difference in the AIC associated with the scoring schema #1 and the 
lowest AIC for a different scoring schema were small for anxiety (0.10). 
Only in the case of serious mental illness, schema#2, domain-specific 
simple exposure count produced a notably smaller AIC. 
Collectively, these findings supported scoring schema#1, the sum of 
all items in each trauma domain separately where the incident described 
by the respondent meets Criterion-A, as the best performing schema 
among the six evaluated. Table 6 shows the results of the final set of 
logistic regressions for each of nine outcomes, along with odds ratios 
while controlling for demographic variables. The findings showed that 
boys were more likely to have no diagnosis, and less likely to meet 
criteria for PTSD, other anxiety, depression, suicidality, and more likely 
to meet criteria for externalizing. Older respondents were less likely to 
have no diagnosis, more likely to meet criteria for PTSD, depression, and 
substance use diagnoses, less likely to meet criteria for externalizing, 
and more likely to have comorbidities. Respondents with minoritized 
status were more likely to meet criteria for PTSD and less likely to meet 
criteria for substance misuse. Interpersonal experienced traumas

99bullying, and nonfamily involvement in traumas were associated with 
lower odds of having no diagnosis. Interpersonal experienced traumas 
including sexual abuse were associated with greater odds of each diag-
nostic outcome we examined except substance misuse. Unintentional 
harms were associated with lower odds of depression. Interpersonal 
witnessed harms at home were associated with greater odds of PTSD and 
suicidality. Bullying was associated with greater odds of depression, 
suicidality, externalizing, serious mental illness, and comorbid status. 
The follow-up items concerning who was involved in these events pro-
vided additional predictive power. Parental involvement was associated 
with lower odds of depression but greater odds of serious mental illness. 
Nonfamily involvement was associated with greater odds of substance 
misuse. 
4.Discussion 
The findings from this TX-CTRN report were consistent with others 
from the literature despite fundamental differences in measurement 
framework, sample characteristics, and analytic methods used. We 
discuss consistencies with prior works concerning both trauma domains 
and associations with outcomes and point out novel added value of this 
report to the evidence base. 
The specific domains that were supported in this report aligned with 
notable prior findings despite lack of ‘alignment ’ in item content of 
traumas from one study to another. For example, principal component 
analyses from the NCTSN supported an acute trauma dimension that 
aligned with what we labeled ‘unintentional harms ’ (Pynoos et al., 
2014 ). Sexual abuse did not separate out in our sample from exposure to 
other intentional, interpersonal and physically abusive traumas. This is consistent with Putnam et al. (2020) who found sexual abuse to pair up 
with other intentional interpersonal experienced harms in person- 
centered analyses of the NCTSN core data. Findings on distinctive as-
sociations of community and family violence (e.g., Kennedy et al., 2009, 
2010 ; Kulkarni et al., 2011 ; Hogdon et al., 2019) align with the 
distinction we observed in intentional witnessed harms in the home 
versus outside the home. 
Results showed that adopting a domain-based approach to exposure 
characterization was superior in concurrent prediction of interview- 
based clinical profiles. Findings also supported reliance on whether 
the event met DSM-5 PTSD Criterion-A when generating domain- 
specific trauma burden scores as opposed to simple endorsement. An 
important strength of this report relative to prior studies concerned the 
breadth of the predictive validity we demonstrated for domain-specific 
trauma burden scores. Most prior works had examined predictions of 
trauma burden in relation to a limited set of outcomes such as PTSD, 
depression, internalizing, and externalizing ratings. We cast a wider net 
that included PTSD, anxiety disorders, depression, suicidality, exter -
nalizing, substance misuse, and serious mental illness. With the excep -
tion of externalizing diagnoses, burden in trauma domains and who was 
involved contributed to the prediction of these diagnoses. Domain- 
specific trauma burden scores also distinguished those without any 
diagnosis from those with at least one diagnosis and distinguished those 
with a single diagnosis from those with comorbidities. These predictions 
held above and beyond child age, gender and minority status. Results 
showed that exposure to intentional, interpersonal and directly experi -
enced traumas predicted every outcome except substance misuse. 
Exposure to intentional, interpersonal but witnessed traumas in the 
home, also added uniquely to PTSD, suicidality, and comorbidity. An Table 4

100important contribution of this report is that bullying had unique additive 
prediction to all outcomes except PTSD, other anxiety, and substance 
misuse. Future studies need to make an effort to consider including 
bullying into assessment protocols in order to better dimensionalize this 
particular exposure beyond frequency counts and to better understand 
its relations to psychopathology. Collectively, findings are largely 
consistent with prior works and underscore the importance of inten -
tional/ interpersonal experienced harms including bullying. 
Consistencies between our findings and those reported in the liter-
ature are remarkable in part because, in the absence of a common 
measurement framework, it is not possible to closely examine replication patterns on either person-centered or variable-centered ap-
proaches to traumatic exposures or associations between traumas and 
outcomes. Hence, we consider the results of the CFA in TX-CTRN as 
providing guidance for future studies rather than being prescriptive on 
how traumas should be classified in either the person-centered or the 
variable-centered mode. For example, if one wanted to examine the 
effects of sexual abuse on clinical symptoms trajectories, our results and 
prior studies (e.g., Hogdon et al., 2019) would encourage statistical 
controls for other intentional/interpersonal experienced traumas. 
Similarly, if one wanted to examine the effects of loss of attachment 
figures, our results would encourage statistical controls for other Table 5

101unintentional traumas. 
4.1. Limitations 
We relied on retrospective assessment of lifetime trauma from chil-
dren and youth at baseline. The design of TX-CTRN will remedy this 
specific limitation of the current report as follow-up prospective data 
collection includes exposure to additional traumas and repeated as-
sessments of clinical symptoms every six months. An important limita -
tion of our assessments was that we were unable to obtain assessments of 
‘neglect. ’ Neglect, whether emotional or with respect to basic needs, 
were not part of the TESI-C items, and should be included in future work. 
It is likely however that many children who experienced neglect also 
endorsed instances of interpersonal experienced and witnessed harms in 
the home and/or community as prior research has shown neglect to co- 
occur with these intentional harms in both variable-centered and 
person-centered analyses (e.g., Brown et al., 2019 ; Pynoos et al., 2014 ). 
Finally, although our outcome measurement framework is broader in 
breadth than prior works, we pooled across granular distinctions among 
MINI-Kid diagnoses to create clinically distinct problems to facilitate 
robust inference. Future work will remedy this limitation as more 
focused questions are posed of this registry. 
4.2. Conclusions 
The current study addressed several limitations of prior research in 
laying the groundwork for prospectively charting pathways of adjust -
ment following traumatic exposure. A broad base recruitment strategy 
of children, youth and their caregivers allowed us to sample a broad 
range of traumatic exposures. Both the screening for traumas and clin-
ical diagnoses were done with standardized clinical interviews. Findings 
largely aligned with earlier studies on the relative importance of 
intentional interpersonal traumas and suggested bullying maybe an 
important source of traumatic stress that independently adds to pre-
diction of several diagnoses.
