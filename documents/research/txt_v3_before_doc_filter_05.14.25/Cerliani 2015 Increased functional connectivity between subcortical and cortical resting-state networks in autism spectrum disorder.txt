Abstract
Importance— Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit severe difficulties in 
social interaction, motor coordination, behavioral flexibility, and atypical sensory processing, with 
considerable interindividual variability. This heterogeneous set of symptoms recently led to 
investigating the presence of abnormalities in the interaction across large-scale brain networks. To 
date, studies have focused either on constrained sets of brain regions or whole-brain analysis, 
rather than focusing on the interaction between brain networks.
Objectives— To compare the intrinsic functional connectivity between brain networks in a large 
sample of individuals with ASD and typically developing control subjects and to estimate to what 
extent group differences would predict autistic traits and reflect different developmental 
trajectories.
Design, Setting, and Participants— We studied 166 male individuals (mean age, 17.6 years; 
age range, 7-50 years) diagnosed as having DSM-IV-TR  autism or Asperger syndrome and 193 
typical developing male individuals (mean age, 16.9 years; age range, 6.5-39.4 years) using

resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants were matched for age, IQ, 
head motion, and eye status (open or closed) in the MRI scanner. We analyzed data from the 
Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE), an aggregated MRI data set from 17 centers, 
made public in August 2012.
Main Outcomes and Measures— We estimated correlations between time courses of brain 
networks extracted using a data-driven method (independent component analysis). Subsequently, 
we associated estimates of interaction strength between networks with age and autistic traits 
indexed by the Social Responsiveness Scale.
Results— Relative to typically developing control participants, individuals with ASD showed 
increased functional connectivity between primary sensory networks and subcortical networks 
(thalamus and basal ganglia) (all t ≥ 3.13, P < .001 corrected). The strength of such connections 
was associated with the severity of autistic traits in the ASD group (all r ≥ 0.21, P < .0067 
corrected). In addition, subcortico-cortical interaction decreased with age in the entire sample (all r 
≤ −0.09, P < .012 corrected), although this association was significant only in typically developing 
participants (all r ≤ −0.13, P < .009 corrected).
Conclusions and Relevance— Our results showing ASD-related impairment in the interaction 
between primary sensory cortices and subcortical regions suggest that the sensory processes they 
subserve abnormally influence brain information processing in individuals with ASD. This might 
contribute to the occurrence of hyposensitivity or hypersensitivity and of difficulties in top-down 
regulation of behavior.
Introduction
Brain abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are present at different scales of 
anatomical organization, ranging from cortical layers 1,2 and minicolumns 3,4 to large-scale 
distributed brain networks. 5–9 There is increasing consensus that these abnormalities reflect 
atypical interactions across multiple neural systems, rather than a problem affecting isolated 
brain regions. 10–18 Abnormalities in the development and interaction across brain networks 
could arise from early disruptions of local neuronal circuitry, signaled by abnormal laminar 
organization 2 and reduced size of cortical minicolumns. 3,19 The latter in particular is likely 
to reflect disrupted functional segregation between minicolumns, giving rise to local 
overconnectivity between minicolumns. 3,11 Excessive local information processing would 
positively reinforce and stabilize local physical connections while at the same time 
negatively affect the development of efficient long-range connections due to delays in 
information transfer between distant brain regions, failure to differentiate signal from noise, 
and reduced synchrony in the activity of distant clusters of minicolumns 11,20–23 (see the 
initial figure in the study by Belmonte et al 22 for a graphical depiction of the effect of local 
overconnectivity coupled with long-range underconnectivity). At the network level, the 
cascading causal effect of local overconnectivity on long-range disconnectivity could result 
in decreased functional integration within networks and functional segregation between 
networks, 24–26 as well as persistent subcortico-cortical overconnectivity. 8,27

organization. Examining the interaction between specific brain regions with functional Cerliani et al. Page 2

magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional connectivity studies have shown that ASD is 
associated with abnormal connectivity within cortico-cortical networks supporting language,
28–30 working memory, 31,32 visual attention, 33 face recognition, 34,35 salience detection, 7 
and social cognition. 36–39 Abnormal subcortico-cortical connectivity has also been 
evidenced by studies 18,27,40–43 focusing on the basal ganglia and the thalamus. 
Considering the topological properties of the whole-brain network, graph theoretical 
studies 44–47 consistently reported alterations in the efficiency of information transfer both 
at the local and the global level in ASD. While these investigations have contributed to 
characterize the disconnection model of ASD, 11,13,15,48 one largely underexamined 
domain regards the investigation of between-network interactions in ASD.
To date, few studies have examined between-network interactions in ASD, reporting reduced 
connectivity between the saliency network and a medial temporal lobe network in young 
adults with ASD 49 and between a frontoparietal network and a cingulate gyrus network in 
children with ASD. 50 While these studies provide initial evidence about abnormalities in 
between-network interactions in ASD, they focused on a limited number of networks 
selected a priori 49 and did not analyze the interaction with sensory networks. 50
Herein, we aimed to systematically explore the interaction between brain networks in 
individuals with ASD using independent component analysis (ICA) 51–53 on resting-state 
fMRI (rs-fMRI). This technique allows one to extract functional networks that resemble 
brain networks recruited during task performance. 54–56 We quantify interactions between 
brain networks using the temporal correlation of their spontaneous activity at rest, and we 
estimate to what extent group differences would predict autistic traits and reflect different 
developmental trajectories. Our study uses a large sample of participants selected from the 
Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE), a recently launched publicly available 
database of 1112 structural and rs-fMRI data sets acquired on 539 participants with ASD 
and 573 age-matched controls, 57 aggregated from 17 international sites.
The wide heterogeneity of symptoms associated with ASD led us to hypothesize the 
presence of abnormal patterns of interaction between multiple brain networks, ranging from 
sensory and motor processing to higher-order cognitive functions. We also hypothesized that 
group differences in between-network interaction would be associated with the degree of 
autistic traits and with delayed or arrested development of cortico-cortical interactions and 
persistent subcortico-cortical connectivity.
Methods
Included Participants From the ABIDE Database
From the ABIDE database, we included all male individuals with a DSM-IV-TR  diagnosis 
of either autism or Asperger syndrome, collectively referred to as the ASD group and 
typically developing (TD) control subjects. Participant inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) 
the data sets included a T1-weighted image (an rs-fMRI acquisition of ≥180 time points with 
near full-brain coverage), (2) a full-scale IQ higher than 70, and (3) a mean framewise 
displacement (FD) 58 of less than 0.34, corresponding to 2 SDs above the whole-sample 
mean. These criteria yielded 359 participants (166 ASD and 193 TD) from 8 sites, matched Cerliani et al. Page 3

by age ( t357 = 0.86, P = .39), full-scale IQ ( t357 = −0.93, P = .35), mean FD ( t357 = 1.67, P 
= .09), and eye status (open or closed) in the scanner ( χ21 = 0.05, P = .81). Demographic 
information for the final sample (N = 359) is summarized in Table 1. Further details about 
demographics, diagnostic criteria, and a selection flowchart for the final sample are provided 
in eFigure 1, eFigure 2, and eTable 1 in the Supplement. Institutional review board approval 
was provided by each data contributor. Detailed recruitment and assessment protocols and 
inclusion criteria are available on the ABIDE website. The ABIDE data set was made public 
in August 2012 and can be accessed at: http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/ .
Independent Component Analysis
Image processing was carried out using FSL 63–65 and in-house written software ( https://
github.com/sblnin/rsfnc ). Computations were performed on the Millipede cluster at the 
University of Groningen (Groningen, the Netherlands) to take advantage of parallel 
computing for processing a data set of this magnitude. After preprocessing of the rs-fMRI 
data (detailed in the eMaterials in the Supplement), spatially independent components (ICs) 
were extracted using FSL MELODIC software. 66 The number of components was estimated 
by the MELODIC algorithm. Temporally concatenated probabilistic ICA 53,66 was carried 
out 25 times on randomized subsets of 112 participants (7 in the TD group plus 7 in the 
ASD group for each of the 8 sites). The resulting spatial components were entered in a meta-
ICA67 to extract robust and reproducible resting-state networks (RSNs).
Components Selection
The meta-ICA estimated 52 spatial components. Among these, we selected RSNs according 
to their spatial distribution, consistency with previous rs-fMRI studies, 7,54,67–69 and 
resemblance to functional networks recruited by task-based fMRI experiments. 54,55,70 This 
selection was complemented by calculating for each spatial component the reproducibility 
across the 25 temporally concatenated probabilistic ICAs and the overlap with gray matter 
(eMaterials and eFigures 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 in the Supplement). This led to the identification of 
19 RSNs that were the focus of subsequent analyses (Figure 1 and Table 2). Excluded 
components are shown in eFigure 3 in the Supplement.
The meta–independent component analysis on 359 participants (166 autism spectrum 
disorder group and 193 typically developing group) extracted 52 independent components 
(ICs), 19 of which were selected for functional network connectivity analyses using a 
semisupervised procedure detailed in the eMaterials in the Supplement. For each IC, we 
indicate the component order in the results of the meta–independent component analysis, 
reflecting the amount of variance explained by that IC (in decreasing order), along with an 
anatomical labeling. The expanded IC abbreviations are listed in Table 2. Discarded ICs are 
shown in eFigure 3 in the Supplement. The similarity of these resting-state networks with 
those previously found by Smith et al 54 and Biswal et al 67 was quantified by means of 
spatial correlation and is shown in eFigure 7 in the Supplement.
Functional Network Connectivity
Each RSN’s summary time course was estimated at the participant level by spatial 
regression of the full set of 52 components from the meta-ICA against each participant’s Cerliani et al. Page 4

preprocessed rs-fMRI data. 71 Although we focused our analyses on the 19 identified RSNs, 
we used the full set of components for spatial regression to account for potential effects of 
noise captured by the non-RSN components (n = 33). Each RSN summary time course was 
then band-pass filtered (0.08-0.009 Hz). 72 We calculated functional network connectivity 
(FNC) 73–75 using the Pearson correlation coefficient between each and every other 
summary time course. This resulted in an FNC matrix with the dimensions of 19 times 19 
(RSNs) times 359 (participants). Group differences in FNC were estimated for each pair of 
RSNs in a general linear model that included age, IQ, and eye status at scan. Seven 
covariates were added to capture the mean FNC differences across sites and one to capture 
the global mean. Finally, the mean participant FD was added as a covariate to minimize the 
effects of motion. 57,76 Inference was carried out using nonparametric permutation testing 
(FSL randomize [20 000 permutations]). The significance threshold was corrected for 
multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR). 77 In addition, we repeated the 
analyses using data despiking 78 and a more stringent group matching for motion ( P = .36) to 
assess whether group differences in FNC could depend on residual differences in motion 
between groups (see eMaterials in the Supplement). We then focused on RSN pairs showing 
significant group differences in FNC after correction to investigate their association with 
autistic traits and with different developmental trajectories.
Association Between FNC and the Social Responsiveness Scale
We examined whether FNC group differences could predict autistic traits, measured using 
the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). 61,62 We correlated SRS raw scores with FNC in the 
whole sample and in each group separately, after groupwise demeaning of SRS scores and 
regressing out age, full-scale IQ, site of acquisition, eye status at scan, and mean FD. This 
was performed separately for each pair of RSNs with a significant group difference in FNC. 
The SRS scores were groupwise demeaned to prevent that correlations with FNC across 
groups could be confounded by group differences in SRS scores. Inference was carried out 
using FSL randomize, and the final results were corrected for multiple comparisons using 
the FDR. This analysis was restricted to the 67% of ASD (n = 111) and 56% of TD (n = 
108) participants for whom SRS data were available (Table 1).
Association Between FNC and Age
We examined whether group differences in FNC would be associated with different 
neurodevelopmental trajectories. We correlated age with FNC in the whole sample and in 
each group separately, after regressing out full-scale IQ, mean FD, site of acquisition, and 
eye status (open or closed) at scan. We then tested the hypotheses of decreased negative 
correlation of FNC with age in ASD for subcortico-cortical interactions and of decreased 
positive correlation of FNC with age in ASD for cortico-cortical interactions. As in the 
previous analysis, inference was carried out using nonparametric permutation testing (FSL 
randomize [20 000 permutations]), and the results were corrected with the FDR.Cerliani et al. Page 5

Results
ICA and Components Selection
The number of ICs estimated in the 25 temporally concatenated probabilistic ICAs ranged 
from 22 to 30 (median, 27). The subsequent meta-ICA extracted 52 ICs, among which we 
selected 19 RSNs for further analyses (Figure 1 and Table 2). These 19 RSNs featured 
significantly higher reproducibility ( t50 = 4.90, P < .0000052 by 2 independent-samples t 
tests) and proportion of gray matter within or outside their spatial extent ( t50 = 1.95, P < .03) 
compared with the 33 discarded components (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). The spatial 
distribution of most of our 19 RSNs was consistent with that of RSNs identified in previous 
work 7,54,67–69 (eFigure 7 in the Supplement), including sensory networks (IC1, IC5, IC16, 
IC19, and IC29), fronto-temporo-parietal networks (IC24 and IC25), subcortical structures 
(IC17), cerebellum (IC3 and IC13), paralimbic regions (IC9 and IC33), saliency79 (IC23), 
and default-mode network (IC10, IC15, and IC27).
Group Differences in FNC
Relative to the TD group, the ASD group exhibited a significantly increased ( P < .001, 
q[FDR] = 0.05) positive interaction between the RSN encompassing basal ganglia and 
thalamus (IC17) with several cortical networks (with q[FDR] indicating the upper bound in 
the expected proportion of false positives) (Figure 2). Most of these cortical RSNs included 
regions in the primary somatosensory (IC5 and IC29), auditory (IC16), and visual (IC8) 
cortices, as well as the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) 
(IC24). An anterior cerebellar RSN (IC13) was also overconnected with the STS and left 
IFG (IC24) and with dorsal somatosensory and motor cortices (IC5). The ASD group 
showed decreased FNC only in the interaction between ventral sensorimotor cortices (IC29) 
and temporoparietal regions centered on the primary auditory cortex (IC16). Results from 
further analyses performed using data despiking and a more stringent group matching for 
motion make it unlikely that these group differences depended on differences in motion 
between groups (eMaterials, eFigure 8, and eTable 2 in the Supplement). Additional 
analyses on the effect of the sample size are reported in the eMaterials and eFigure 9 in the 
Supplement.
Association Between FNC Abnormalities and the SRS
In the ASD group, autistic traits measured with the SRS scores were positively associated 
with FNC between the subcortical RSN (IC17) and both dorsal IC5 ( r = 0.21) and ventral 
IC29 ( r = 0.25) primary somatosensory and motor cortices ( P < .0067 for both, q[FDR] = 
0.05) (Table 3, Figure 3, eFigure 10, and eTable 4 in the Supplement). Conversely, the 
strength of cortico-cortical interaction between auditory (IC16) and ventral somatosensory 
(IC29) cortices was negatively associated with autistic traits in TD controls only ( r = −0.11, 
P < .0006, q[FDR] = 0.05).

regions significantly decreased with age in TD participants ( P < .009, q[FDR] = 0.05) (Table 
4). While the effect was maintained in the entire sample of ASD plus TD groups ( P < .012, 
q[FDR] = 0.05), in the ASD group the negative association between age and subcortico-
cortical FNC was weaker than in the TD group and not significant (Table 4, eFigure 11, and 
eTable 5 in the Supplement). However, this difference did not yield significant group 
interactions. Conversely, FNC between anterior cerebellum (IC13) and dorsal somatosensory 
and premotor cortices (IC5) significantly increased with age in TD participants ( P < .0077, 
q[FDR] = 0.05) and in the entire sample ( P < .0009, q[FDR] = 0.05). Finally, FNC between 
anterior cerebellum (IC13) and STS plus left IFG (IC24) significantly increased with age in 
the ASD group ( P < .0008, q[FDR] = 0.05) and in the entire sample ( P < .0014, q[FDR] = 
0.05).
Discussion
Increased Subcortico-Cortical FNC
Relative to TD controls, in participants with ASD a subcortical RSN encompassing basal 
ganglia and thalamus showed increased functional connectivity with 5 cortical RSNs, most 
of which included primary sensory cortices (results at P < .05 uncorrected are presented in 
eFigures 12, 13A, 13B, and 14 in the Supplement). Our findings concur with previous 
studies in ASD that reported increased functional connectivity between regions in the 
primary sensory cortices and in the striatum, 27,41,43,80,81 as well as increased40 thalamo-
cortical connectivity (but see Nair et al 42 for thalamo-cortical underconnectivity). A 
comparison of our results with those reported in the inaugural ABIDE article 57 is provided 
in the eMaterials in the Supplement.
The evidence of subcortico-cortical overconnectivity mostly targeting primary sensory 
cortices provides a framework to conceptualize the presence of sensory abnormalities in 
ASD. A growing clinical and experimental literature reports atypical sensory processing in 
ASD, 82–86 qualified as hyporeactivity or hyperreactivity to sensory stimuli 82,84 and 
enhanced sensory perceptual processing and discrimination. 87,88 Accordingly, the newly 
released DSM-5  manual 89 now also includes hyporeactivity or hyperreactivity to sensory 
stimulation as a diagnostic criterion, acknowledging that sensory abnormalities are central in 
the symptomatology of ASD. Our results suggest that the presence of atypical sensory 
processing in ASD could stem from an abnormal, possibly excessive influence of basic 
sensory features of the environment on information processing in the brain, which could 
override higher-order cognitive processes in determining the relevance of different sources 
of information for behavior. At the neural level, this situation could be engendered by an 
abnormally high sensory input from subcortical nuclei to the cortex, reflected indirectly by 
our findings of subcortico-cortical overconnectivity even at rest. A similar conjecture by 
Belmonte and colleagues 10 proposed that in ASD the impairment of low-level mechanisms 
for filtering irrelevant and unwanted sensory stimuli would prompt the development of 
compensatory mechanisms that operate at a later, less efficient stage of processing. The 
recently reported 7 overconnectivity within the saliency network in ASD might reflect the 
development of compensatory mechanisms aimed at counteracting the overwhelming Cerliani et al. Page 7

amount of sensory input reaching the cortex due to impaired gating circuits at the subcortical 
level. 7,90,91
It is remarkable that the RSN pairs where we detect group differences in FNC are likely to 
reflect, at least in part, the activity of projections from deep cerebellar nuclei to the cerebral 
cortex and from the striatum to the thalamus. The hypothesis of an imbalance in the ratio of 
excitatory to inhibitory activity in ASD had been proposed by Rubenstein and Mezernich, 92 
and even earlier studies 93–95 consistently reported loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. 
There is now a growing body of evidence suggesting that the disruption of γ-aminobutyric 
acid–ergic signaling contributes to the pathophysiology of ASD. 23,96–98 Importantly, 
stereotyped behaviors appear to be related to dysfunctions in γ-aminobutric acid signaling,
99 while insistence on sameness is associated with caudate overgrowth. 100 Additionally, 
very recent evidence from in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed a 
decreased ratio of γ-aminobutric acid to creatinine in the cerebellum and in the primary 
sensory and motor cortices of individuals with ASD. 101,102 Therefore, the increased 
interaction we observed between subcortical and cortical regions might reflect an 
abnormally low inhibitory activity, rather than an abnormally high excitatory activity. For 
instance, the cortico-cerebellar overconnectivity that we detected could stem from a 
disinhibition of the deep cerebellar nuclei due to the loss of Purkinje cells. 22 This 
conjecture, however, awaits testing with methods different from fMRI because the fMRI 
signal may confuse excitation and inhibition. 103
Association Between FNC Abnormalities and Autistic Traits Measured With SRS
We observed that in ASD subcortico-cortical overconnectivity was related to increased 
severity of autistic traits as measured with the SRS. Scores on the SRS clearly distinguish 
individuals with ASD from TD controls at the group level (in our sample, t174* = 19.00, P < 
1.412e-44, with the asterisk indicating the df adjusted for unequal variance between groups). 
At the same time, this measure reflects that autistic traits (1) are present in a continuous 
gradient of severity in the general population, 61 (2) have an increased likelihood to manifest 
in family members of ASD participants with a negative diagnosis of ASD, 62,104,105 and 
(3) express variability both between and within groups. 106 Resting-state fMRI has been 
shown to capture variability in autistic traits indexed by SRS in neurotypical adults. 107 We 
show that FNC between subcortical and primary somatosensory and motor networks, which 
is abnormally high in individuals with ASD, was correlated to the severity of autistic traits in 
the whole sample, as well as within the ASD group. This suggests that this FNC measure is 
able to capture variability both between and within group described by the SRS scores.
Concerning the nature of the association between SRS and FNC that we report herein, 
studies 91,108,109 in sensorimotor gating in ASD proposed that difficulties in inhibiting 
repetitive behaviors could stem from problems in filtering out irrelevant sensory stimuli. 
Deficits in sensorimotor gating in ASD appear to be rooted in structural abnormalities in 
fronto-striatal and cerebellar circuits 108 and are strongly associated with the presence of 
repetitive behaviors. 91 The association we have identified between SRS scores and 
subcortico-cortical connectivity involving somatosensory and motor cortices is compatible 
with the idea of a relationship between sensory abnormalities and repetitive behaviors. Cerliani et al. Page 8

However, this hypothesis should be corroborated by future studies investigating the 
association between subcortical-sensorimotor overconnectivity and direct measures of 
sensory symptoms in ASD 84 and by task-based fMRI studies specifically probing these 
sensory and motor processes.
Association Between FNC Abnormalities and Age
Consistent with prior literature, 110 examining the developmental trajectory of between-
network overconnectivity revealed that subcortico-cortical connectivity significantly 
decreased with age in the sample of participants. This suggests that during development 
cortical processing becomes decreasingly determined by processes elicited by sensory 
stimuli, emotions, and interoceptive feelings. 110 The relationship between subcortico-
cortical FNC was negative within each group and did not significantly differ across groups, 
although the correlation was significant only for TD participants. Therefore, while our 
results concur with previous studies 27,40,41,43,80,81 in reporting a persistent subcortico-
cortical overconnectivity across different age groups in ASD, such overconnectivity in the 
ASD participants we examined decreased with age at a rate that failed to show significant 
differences from that recorded in the TD participants.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, the correlation approach in functional connectivity 
does not provide directional information. Such information will be crucial to determine 
whether the observed subcortico-cortical hyperconnectivity reflects cortical compensatory 
mechanisms aimed at regulating the information flow from sensory organs, increased 
information flow from the thalamus to the cortex, or both.
Second, the weak association between FNC and SRS potentially reflects the wide 
interindividual variability in ASD. Gathering richer phenotypical information is needed to 
yield a multivariate characterization of the association between phenotypic and 
neuroimaging parameters. 111,112
Third, our group differences in the FNC center around an RSN encompassing basal ganglia 
and thalamus. Given the neuroanatomical heterogeneity of different structures within this 
RSN, it is remarkable that ICA does not further decompose this network. This limits the 
level of detail that can be achieved using spatially independent components and highlights 
the complementary role of region-based and network-based functional connectivity studies.
113,114
Conclusions
We report that hyperconnectivity between subcortical regions and sensory cortices is a 
central feature in ASD. This hyperconnectivity was related to the degree of autistic traits in 
the examined sample of individuals with ASD. We propose that such hyperconnections 
could relate to abnormal sensory processing in that they represent an alteration of the normal 
equilibrium between sensory information stemming from the thalamus and top-down 
influence from higher-order cortices.Cerliani et al. Page 9

Figure 1. Components selected for FNC analysis
The metaICA on 359 participants (166 ASD + 193 TD) extracted 52 independent 
components (IC), 19 of which were selected for FNC analyses using a semi-supervised 
procedure detailed in the eMaterials. For each IC, we indicate the component order in the 
results of the metaICA, reflecting the amount of variance explained by that IC (in decreasing 
order), along with an anatomical labeling. Abbreviations are listed in Table 2. Discarded ICs 
are shown in eFigure 3. The similarity of these RSNs with those previously found in Biswal Cerliani et al. Page 16

Figure 2. Group differences in between-network connectivity
Group differences in FNC strength are shown as lines (red indicates increased FNC in ASD 
with respect to TD participants, blue the reverse situation) together with boxplots of the 
Pearson correlation values per each group. Boxplots report the mean (red line), standard 
deviation (blue bars) and standard error of the mean (black rectangle around the mean) of 
group-level FNC values. Stars above the boxplots indicate those cases in which the mean 
FNC was found significantly different from zero (at q(FDR)=.05 - see also eTable 5). 
Results were obtained by comparing the between-network functional connectivity of 166 
ASD and 193 TD participants, using nonparametric permutation testing (20,000 
permutations) and correcting the final results with q(FDR)=.05, leading to a final threshold 
of p<0.001. Converting the correlation scores to Z values using Fisher r to Z transformation 
yielded almost identical results (see eFigure 5).Cerliani et al. Page 18

Figure 3. Correlation between somatosensory-subcortical FNC and group-wise demeaned SRS 
scores
These scatterplots illustrate the association between FNC and SRS (after group-wise 
demeaning) in ASD (red) and TD (blue) participants for the interaction between the 
subcortical RSN and the two RSNs centered around the ventral (IC29) and dorsal (IC5) 
primary somatosensory and motor cortex. The association between SRS scores and FNC 
was found significant only for the ASD group after correction with q(FDR)=.053. These 
results were confirmed by repeating the analysis using robust regression (p<.024, q(FDR)=.
05). The lines in the scatterplot represent the linear fit witihin each group: red for ASD, blue 
for TD. Detailed statistics for these within-group correlations, as well as for the correlation 
analysis in the entire sample, are reported in the Table 3. Scatterplots and statistics for the 
correlation of SRS with other FNC scores are reported in eFigure 8 and eTable 2.Cerliani et al. Page 19
