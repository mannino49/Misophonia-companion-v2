AIM
Toinvestigate existing literature, synthesizing research
onmisophonia inthepopulation ofcollege agestudents
inorder tounderstand any patterns .Particularly, our
interest liesinthepotential negative effects misophonia
hasoncollege students’ learning.INTRODUCTION
What is misophonia ?
•A relatively recently identified disorder in humans, only 
recognized as a medical disorder since 2001
•Individuals have low tolerance and extreme sensitivity to certain sound stimuli ( mouth sounds, eating, nasal 
sounds, rustling or crinkling, repetitive tapping, etc ).
•Many act on this sensitivity by outbursts, rage, avoidance, or other uncontrollably negative emotions
•Familiarity component: misophonic reactions typically worsen when the sounds are produced by parents or siblings
How is it classified or diagnosed?•Misophonia has disordered aspects in audiology, with 
the sound sensitivity, as well as psychological 
components: anxiety, rage, and common co -occurrent 
disorders such as OCD or eating disorders
•Currently many assessments created to diagnose/study misophonia among researchers (not 
standardized)
•Variation in definition and diagnostic criteria  no 
official diagnostic formulation within the DSM -V or 
ICD-10LITERATURE SEARCH
We conducted a review of already -published articles on 
misophonia . This was done in this sequence.
Initial UIUC Library Database Search
•Search term “ misophonia ”
•2006 –2022
•Academic Journal Articles (534)
•Main Databases: 122 Complementary Index, 112 
MEDLINE, 105 Academic Search Ultimate
•Expository information gained
Targeted UIUC Library Database Search
•Search term “ misophonia ” + “college”
•2006 –2022
•Academic Journal Articles (181)
•Main Databases: 74 Scopus, 69 Academic Search 
Ultimate, 20 MEDLINE
•Specific, college -age population information gained
Inclusion and Exclusion of Articles
•Inclusion was then based on a main focus of 
misophonia as the subject of research, and any level 
of description of college age population relating to misophonia
•Type of study was irrelevant: we used case studies, experiment/intervention designs, other scoping reviews, etc.
•Exclusion of studies occurred for articles which returned key terms yet did not discuss the college age population specificallyRESULTS
Findings on Prevalence•No widely endorsed guidelines –different definitions of 
misophonia result in different prevalence reports
•Three main studies focus on prevalence of misophonia
among college -aged students
Of these 3 studies:•Wu et. al (2014) study found 20% with clinically 
significant misophonia
•Zhou et. al (2017) found 20% with clinically significant misophonia
•Naylor et. al (2020) found 49.1% with clinically 
significant misophonia
•Compared to general population with about 15% 
prevalence of misophonia
1, on average misophonia
may affect between 20 -25% of the college student 
samples
•Generalizability is not strong DISCUSSION
Problems•Few studies available which focus on misophonia and 
college -age students
•Even fewer give data on incidence/prevalence
•Very different diagnostic criteria or assessments 
different prevalence findings
•External validity unreliable  no conclusion can be 
drawn on increased prevalence of misophonia for 
college students vs. general population
Implications on Academic Success•While there is currently limited information, 
prevalence rates of misophonia in college-age 
population may either mirror or be at higher levels than the general population
•Very few professors reported knowledge of 
misophonia , reflecting a lack of awareness about 
possible accommodations
•Students with misophonia not likely to get 
accommodations academics will suffer
•However, there is a willingness to accommodate these 
students that may be even greater when education is 
provided to non -knowledgeable professors
•Educating professors about misophonia is a priority

•Survey of 686 professors in the state of Florida3
•Only 18.4% self -reported knowledge of 
misophonia
•Only 2.3% reported that a student requested 
accommodations for misophonia
•Those with knowledge indicated taking misophonia
more seriously than those without knowledge
•General willingness to provide accommodations if requested
•Students with misophonia in college classes will 
likely be negatively impacted without proper accommodations
•Separate testing for exams
•Excused absences from lectures
