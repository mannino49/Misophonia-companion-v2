ID:2- Reciprocal mentoring in UK Higher Education – a case from a UK 
Business School  
Ms. Ann - Aaron Taylor   
 
ABSTRACT  
Reciprocal mentoring in UK Higher Education (HE) is a relatively recent concept that is growing in 
significance as its benefits are becoming more clearly understood (Burdett, 2014). The process 
provides a platform for students to deliver their own unique f eedback and for universities to gain an 
insight into student mind -sets and experiences so that they can better respond to needs and 
requirements.  
 
In this study, reciprocal mentoring was piloted with a new PhD student and an experienced doctoral 
supervisor in order to uncover ways in which to enhance the quality of doctoral supervision in a UK 
Business School. In addition to the monthly PhD superviso ry meeting, a further meeting was 
organised each month to develop a wider perspective on how to improve the current level of 
provision. The dates and times of these meetings were agreed between the mentor and mentee.  
 
The empirical data confirmed the view that reciprocal mentoring plays a significant role in enhancing 
student engagement and provides a transformational impact on the student “voice”.  
New discoveries indicate that there were several tangible benefits to reciprocal mentoring. These 
included building a better culture of learning, developing student leadership skills, sharing 
perspectives more transparently, supporting inclusivity and enha ncing self -confidence and self -
awareness.  
 
These findings arguably demonstrate the need for the institution to leverage the mentoring provision 
in order to improve its offering to PhD students. It was also discovered that the level of support 
offered to PhD students needed to be improved so that th ey are able to further develop their skills 
and competencies. These findings correlate with Singh et al.’s (2021) study on knowledge sharing 
during the Covid -19 pandemic.

ID:3- The Realities of Virtual Coaching Presence - When the Medium Becomes 
the Message  
Dr Tünde Erdös, Austria  
 
ABSTRACT  
Digital coaching platforms mushroom. As they do, or as organisations and coaches simply choose to 
work more online than in -person with clients, we embrace the opportunity to get easy access to both 
teams, coaches, and coachees from all over the world. As H R and coaches all welcome this 
opportunity, do we also embrace potential differences when it comes to our online presence, 
particularly coaching presence? Why coaching presence? Coaching presence is understood to be the 
most important mastery skill when it  comes to effective and transformational communication. Do we 
notice the implications of moving from offline to online coaching when it comes to this particular skill, 
one which has been understood to be our most important lever of mastery?  
In this workshop, we will focus on getting a felt sense of at least one big difference in 1:1 online 
coaching presence and at least one big difference in team coaching presence - all based on scientific 
work I am conducting, and experiential wisdom support ed by client feedback.  
 
Fact and figures based on most recent research:  
• Structural interviews with 76 coaches on coaching presence: 91% reported great initial 
rapport, no difference between online and offline presence  
• Structural interviews with 100 companies / 50 -250 employees / 6 months: 87% reported 
coachees’ drop -out; coachees only partly engaged, not engaged at all in virtual coaching  
• Digital coaching platforms: report 250% ROI for well -being (CoachHub, 2020)

students’ outcome but also unload some burden of school finances (O’Malley, 2019). The objective of 
this present study is to understand the lived experiences of expatriate teachers, who have committed 
their profession in the sa me school for longer period of time, on what are the factors that influent 
them to work in the same school. Using a phenomenological approach to extract the key 
contributions from five expatriate teachers participated in the study. Three macro themes were 
identified, 1) sense of belongingness at workplace, 2) authentic leadership and, 3) shared visions and 
values. The findings highlighted the importance of the role of the workplace that has to enhance the 
sense of belongingness of the teachers, school leade rship and alignment of visions and values of 
teachers and organization are the variables that influent the employee retention in this international 
school context. The practical implication and limitation of the present study were discussed.

ID:6 - Achieving Career Success through Self -Concept: Role of Cultural 
Construals  
Bhagyashree Barhate, Malar Hirudayaraj & Khalil Dirani  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
India’s collectivist culture poses unique challenges to youngsters’ careers. For instance, they are 
expected to adhere to familial and societal standards when choosing a career. Furthermore, Indian 
parents consider jobs in STEM more prestigious and thus of ten pressure their children to acquire 
employment in science and technology -related fields, such as the IT industry. How these individuals 
overcome external influences projected by family and friends is largely unknown. Once individuals 
are put in the orga nizational system, they must overcome these influences to achieve career success.  
The Western conceptualizations of career success that ignore cultural nuances lead to a one -sided 
understanding of career success in a globalized market. Thus, this study examined the underexplored 
concept of career success in a collectivist culture such a s India, which lends limited agency over career 
decisions to its youth.  
 
This paper explores the career success perceptions of Generation Z (born between 1995 and 2012), 
the youngest generation working in India’s information technology (IT) industry. Using a constructivist 
grounded theory design, we interviewed sixteen particip ants to understand how they perceive their 
career success. The analysis indicates that the participants gained agency over their careers by 
iteratively developing self -awareness, self -efficacy, and career self -efficacy, ultimately leading them 
to develop a  self-concept. By developing self -concept, participants gradually moved away from their 
collectivist influences and actively participated in their career advancement. The findings of this study 
further indicate that the participants’ engagement with their careers helped them gain agency over 
their careers by making independent decisions attributed to their perceptions of career success.  
We borrow from the career self -construal concept to understand how individuals from a collectivist 
culture perceive career success. Cultural construal is a social understanding of how individuals from 
different cultures perceive themselves and how others i nfluence their cognition about self (Markus & 
Kitayama, 1991).  
 
The findings from this study have implications for organizations in designing programs that effectively 
attract, engage, and retain Generation Z employees.

ID:6 - How Psychological Factors Affect Phishing: A Literature Review  
 
Alexander Gordon & Darlene Russ -Eft  
ABSTRACT  
 
Phishing is a social engineering attack which intends to steal information from an intended victim by 
masquerading as a reputable source (Alsharnouby et al, 2015). Phishing emails can vary in the 
amount of people targeted, sophistication, and purpose (Fruhlinger, 2022). It is a ubiquitous 
problem in modern day society and organizations, which in the year 2017 alone caused an 
estimated $1,400,000,000 USD in damages (Pienta et al, 2020). This trend is not like ly to slow down 
as currently more than 5,000,000,000 people are online (Statista, 2023). Indeed, phishing is a major 
issue as cyber -attacks are among the top 10 threats to global stability and phishing is certainly an 
integral part of cyber -attacks (Ge et al, 2021). Phishing has arguably influenced the geo -political 
landscape of the world already with Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager being phished and thus 
influencing the 2016 United States elections (Rashid, 2020). There also is no technological elixir t o 
cure the phishing plague within the foreseeable future (Alsharnouby et al, 2015). This is largely due 
to phishing attacks targeting humans, as they are often the weakest link in cyber defense. Phishing 
attacks at their core use psychological tricks into cajoling or luring a victim into doing the attackers 
intended purpose (Pienta et al, 2020).  
 
The Big Five psychological factors model is has been shown to largely explain how someone 
behaves (Barrick & Mount, 1991; Goldberg, 1990). The Big Five trait of conscientiousness has been 
shown to be an indicator of job performance for over 100 years (Wilm ont & Ones, 2019). Yet the 
results of the Big Five factors’ interface with phishing response is not clear as of yet. There are 
dozens of peer -reviewed academic studies currently which have examined this topic. However, they 
often have contradictory results  thus leaving no clear consensus on this topic (Sommestad & 
Karlzen, 2019). While the relationship in regard to phishing response is currently ambiguous, it 
appears that some traits may have a significant influence on that response. Thus far there is no 
theoretical model which takes all of these details into account.  
The purpose of this study was to elucidate the interactions between phishing and the Big Five 
factors. The research questions to be answered by were as follows:  
 
RQ1: What does the existing evidence show as the relationship between the Big Five factor traits 
and phishing response?  
RQ2: In what ways, if any, do the existing studies show that there is a specific victim phishing 
personality profile? Ge et al (2021) suggested that there is a victim personality.  
 
The present research will examine that possibility.  
This study used an integrative literature review method (Toracco, 2005) to examine the relationship 
between the Big Five psychological factors and the phishing response. The search process for this 
literature review was a multi -faceted one. There were seve ral databases used in this process. The 
first search used was a general search in Purdue’s Library for Phishing AND Big Five Personality in 
Peer Reviewed Academic Journals. The same search was used in Google Scholar, Gale OneFile’s 
database, and ProQuest. This process was then repeated by searching Phishing AND Psychology. 
The search was not limited by date, but only English texts were used.  
 
The study will develop a theoretical model of the resulting relationships. This theoretical model can 
then be used to suggest practical implications in terms of human resource development (HRD) 
interventions within organizations. Such interventions can aid  both the organizations and their

24 
employees. The model and the results from the literature review can also help to identify future 
directions for HRD research.

ID:37 - The Role and Impact of Coaching on Human Resources Performance  
Isabel Reis, Sampaio Marta, Vasco Santos, and Filipa Martinho  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Nowadays, coaching is relevant due to the fact its direct purpose is helping employees, as human 
resources of organizations, to exploit their own potential, both personally and professionally, in 
order to continuously improve their performance in various work contexts. Based on these 
assumptions, this study focuses the current role and impact of coaching on human resources 
performance, specifically the processes in personal and professional development. Coaching is a 
process that has been little studied empirically in relation to organizational phe nomena such as 
emotions, teamwork and conflict management. With this in mind, this research also aimed to 
understand what contribution this process makes to interpersonal relationships. The research 
question guiding this study is: "Is coaching a determinin g factor in a company for personal and 
professional development, contributing to better performance and consequently greater employee 
productivity?". Methodologically, this is based on a qualitative nature, based on interviews with 
coachees. For this purpo se, an interview guide was constructed, using the snowball sampling 
technique, and 14 coachees were interviewed. The participants are aged between 30 and 54 years 
old (13 women and 1 man), with different areas of professional activity. After analyzing the 
respondents' responses, the information was categorized. We managed to get the perception that 
with the coaching sessions, the coachees surveyed consider that they developed different skills with 
this process, such as license, self -confidence, strategic vi sion, among others, and also that this 
process brought them benefits as professionals, such as empathy with the other, self -confidence 
and focus on meeting objectives. As expected, finding a consensual definition of Coaching was not 
possible in the data an alysis, this strengthens the concept of Ives (2008) when he mentions that the 
definition of the concept today still creates controversy. However, most of the time, Coaching is 
associated with personal development, to achieve goals and a helping relationshi p. To sum up, it 
can be inferred that coaching provides various benefits, develops soft skills and improves the 
performance of human resources in business and organizational environments. Regarding to 
limitations, this study had a small sample size, which meant that the results could not be 
generalized on a large scale. For future studies, it would be interesting to carry out a study that 
would make it possible to compare the coachees' competences before and after going through the 
coaching process, with th e aim of analyzing which competences were acquired, as well as their 
impact on performance.

ID:41 - Navigating doing good: pro bono coaching promises and pitfalls  
Judie G annon , Ksenia Warren & Loanna Lordanou  
ABSTRACT  
 
This paper presents primary evidence from a study on pro bono coaching. It draws on professional 
services theory (von Nordenflycht, Malhorta & Morris, 2015; von Nordenflycht, 2010) to examine 
why coaches are drawn to providing pro bono coaching services. L iterature on pro bono 
professional services offer contradictory evidence on the benefits of pro bono professional work. 
While most professions and professionals have connotations with status, privilege and various 
forms of capital, this is in direct refuta tion with under -represented and disadvantaged groups and 
communities in society. However, third sector organisations, and under -served and disadvantaged 
service users, are seen to gain from the provision of pro bono work. There is also data which 
suggests it can undermine their trust in professions and professionals. Likewise, while service 
providers (professionals themselves) may enhance their own professional development and 
experience through pro bono work, studies have also suggested that such services can lead to 
professionals suffering from embarrassment and feelings of inferiority (Ong & Yang, 2014; 
Patterson et al., 2021). Organisational and institutional perspectives indicate that while pro bono 
professional services can generate future new revenue lines, enhance professions’ societal 
standing, and prosociality amongst professionals (Ryan, 2021), damage can accrue where such 
services are undervalued. As such significant tensions are evident across different stakeholders 
(professionals and their assoc iations, third sector organisations, professional service firms, policy 
makers and underserved and disadvantaged communities).     
 
Coaching can be understood as a valuable HRD practice with a deep commitment to supporting the 
realisation of human potential, within organisations but also more broadly as part of living a 
meaningful life (Shoukry & Cox, 2018; Western, 2017).  Drawing on interviews and image elicitation 
with coaches, educators, supervisors, and third sector clients, this paper highlights how the 
development of coaches, and coaching as a profession, exacerbates and extends our current 
understanding of why professionals enga ge in pro bono work. While personal development may 
initially be at the root of pro bono coaching work, more complex aspects of altruism and being 
inherently a human -values driven endeavour are also evident in respondents’ accounts. Concerns 
about addressi ng the imbalance of access to the benefits of coaching are also evident amongst 
respondents alongside the frictions of managing completely free, low fee and commercial rates of 
coaching provision. The paper concludes by identifying implications for profess ional services theory 
in specific professional contexts, and specific practice implications for coaches and HRD 
professionals as part of their wider commitment to supporting and realising human potential, 
within organisations and across communities and soc iety more widely.

ID:59 - Tailoring and Transferability of coaching and coaching supervision 
models across sectors and contexts: challenges and considerations  
Helen Smith, Andrew Scott, Jeremy Gomm, Linda Grant & Neil Ralph  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
As a team of seasoned practitioners, we are acutely aware of the individual presence and impact we 
may have upon those we are fortunate enough to work with as coach or coach supervisor. This 
practice spans multiple sectors and contexts from education to pu blic and private international 
organisations to third sector charity workers.  
 
We recognise we may be the expert of the process applied for assisting the development of 
knowledge and insight in our clients, but they are the true experts at what they do, and they simply 
allow us into their world to share, reflect and gain that additio nal perspective for enhanced 
understanding. We simply assist knowledge discovery.  
 
In the realms of knowledge discovery, we are always asking ourselves if we are using the right 
approach with this client or team, is this the correct model or question to be asking to support this 
scenario and individual best. Choosing the right model, que stion or approach can make the 
difference to the progress the individual or team makes.  
 
Getting to a point of co -creation and achieving the right ‘fit’ is not just about establishing a trusted 
relationship. This paper (and workshop) explores a variety of case studies and scenarios to assess 
the tailoring required to achieve the desired outcom es. As a practitioner group we share our 
reflections and insights on what went well, what could be improved and what should never be 
assumed to be transferable across sectors and contexts. The resulting check list highlights the 
challenges and consideratio ns any coach or coach supervisor should be aware of when working 
with multiple groups.

ID:75 - Coaching in A Digital Age – Does Intuition Give the Human Coach an 
Advantage?  
Andy Elson  
ABSTRACT  
 
As a team of seasoned practitioners, we are acutely aware of the individual presence and impact we 
may have upon those we are fortunate enough to work with as coach or coach supervisor. This 
practice spans multiple sectors and contexts from education to pu blic and private international 
organisations to third sector charity workers.  
 
Recent literature on artificial intelligence (AI) in coaching has expressed concern about the coaching 
market becoming saturated with chatbots. Passmore (2023) suggests that human coaches still have 
the edge, due to several features artificial intelligence  does not possess such as intuition. Research 
by Passmore et al (2010) and Keirsey (1998) on executive coaches highlighted that the majority of 
coaches have a preference for intuition as defined by the Myers -Briggs typology. But is there such a 
thing as an  intuitive type? If so, can this be developed? And what does this possibly mean for 
coaching in the face of encroachment from artificial intelligence?

ID:76 - The Impact of Supervisors’ Lack of Mentor Expertise on Subordinates’ 
Emotional Labor and Job Embeddedness  
Chun -Yu Lin, Chung -Kai Huang, Chin -Chuan Lee & Skylar Chun -Ju Hsu  
ABSTRACT  
 
Research Background  
In the workplace, there is a type of mental fatigue. This may stem from the fact that, during the 
course of work, we unconsciously adjust or modify many internal feelings or perceptions. These 
feelings are likely associated with interactions with colleagues, supervisors, clients, involving the 
extraction of emotional communication. Literature indicates that long -term care attendants must 
conceal or suppress genuine emotions, u sing more love and patience to care for individuals with 
physical and mental disabilities. Simultaneously, this process may lead to work fatigue, 
subsequently leading to work avoidance and interpersonal detachment (Wang et al., 2023). 
Therefore, drawing fr om research in other work domains, when facing negative mentor expertise 
from superiors, exploring the impact of emotional labor on the job embeddedness of mid -ranking 
officers can be crucial.  
 
Retaining and utilizing talented individuals has become a challenging Human Resource 
Development (HRD) issue for Taiwan military (Wang, 2023). For instance, enhancing the willingness 
of mid -ranking military officers to continue their service has been an on going goal. Previous studies 
on the factors influencing the retention intentions of military officers including the pension reform 
system (Liu, 2019), life satisfaction (Wu & Yang, 2020), organizational socialization level (Liu & Chen, 
2018), and job satis faction (Li, 2019).  
However, when mid -ranking military officers face their decision of whether to resign, what truly 
discourages them from continuing their service is often not the existing system and policies. 
Instead, it is about the factors within the workplace environment , such as interactions with 
coworkers, workloads, and tasks in the units and positions. Some studies suggested that negative 
mentoring experiences in the mentoring program when working with the military can be an issue 
(Eby et al., 2004).  
 
Research purpose  
This study investigated the impact of perceived supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise on the mid -
ranking military officers’ motional labor behaviors and job embeddedness in Taiwan.  
 
Hypotheses  
Hypothesis 1: Perceived supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise can decrease mid -ranking military 
officers’ fit with their units.  
Hypothesis 2: Perceived supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise can decrease mid -ranking military 
officers’ sacrifice from their units.  
Hypothesis 3: Mid -ranking military officers’ surface acting plays a mediating role between  
their perceived supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise and fit.  
Hypothesis 4: Mid -ranking military officers’ surface acting plays a mediating role between their  
perceived supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise and sacrifice.  
Hypothesis 5: Mid -ranking military officers’ deep acting plays a mediating role between  
their perceived supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise and fit.  
Hypothesis 6: Mid -ranking military officers’ deep acting plays a mediating role between  
their perceived supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise and sacrifice.

31 
Theoretical foundation  
Based on the notions of Social Exchange Theory (SET) (Homans, 1958) and Conservation of 
Resources Theory (COR) (Hobfoll, 1989; Hobfoll & Shirom, 2001), We proposed the above 
hypotheses and investigated what happened to mid -ranking military officers’ emotio nal labor 
behaviors and job embeddedness in the military workplace when they faced superiors’ lack of 
mentor expertise.  
 
Methodology  
Our research framework consists of five constructs including lack of mentor expertise, surface 
acting, deep acting, fit, and sacrifice. All responses were assessed on a 7 -point Likert -type scale (1 = 
strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree).  
 
In this study, A negative mentoring expertise scale established by Eby et al. (2004) was used for 
measure the mid -ranking military officers’ perception of their supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise. 
In addition, the scale developed by Brotheridge et al., (1998) was adopted to measure the surface 
acting and deep acting by mid -ranking officers. The scale by Cummings et al., (2023) was employed 
to measure the level of job embeddedness for mid -ranking officers. The Cronbach's α for the 
reliability of lack of m entor expertise, surface acting, deep acting, fit, and sacrifice are .87, .79, .79, 
.86, and .88.  
 
The data was conducted during one month (Mid -August to Mid -September 2023) in Taiwan. Even 
though 400 online surveys were answered, the missing data sections, unavailable and wrong key -in 
data were taken out. We ended up with a total of 290 questionnaires usable to conduct data 
analysis. In the end, a total of 290 samples of online surveys were answered, giving a responding 
rate of 72.5%.  
 
Implications for HRD practice  
The study indicates that supervisors’ lacking mentor expertise are deficient in professional 
knowledge within their field of expertise. This deficiency allows subordinates more decision -making 
space and flexibility, giving them considerable influence over decisions, and empowers oneself with 
a sense of accomplishment and enhances job satisfaction. When recognized themselves as 
indispensable members of the organization, they naturally fit much more with the unit. This makes 
them less inclined to consider res ignation.  
 
For mid -ranking officers, surface acting exhibits a passive and almost resource -free action. For 
instance, pretending to be know nothing allows them to avoid unnecessary responsibilities. 
Moreover, in the military work environment, the truth is that "more work, more mistakes; less work, 
less mistakes; no work, no mistakes." Doing more works does not necessarily result in additional 
pay, but providing more personal time and allowing punctual departure from work. Supervisors’ 
lack of mentor expertise are less  likely to interfere with subordinates, providing them with more 
freedom. Responding to supervisors’ lack of mentor expertise with a passive and resource -free 
surface acting and the performance appraisal system lacking of distinguishable ability may lead t o 
individuals to fit much more with the unit and organization.  
 
Significance/contribution to the HRD field  
Leaders who enhance their mentor expertise, empower their subordinates, and acknowledge the 
indispensable role of each individual within the organization tend to foster better fit, encouraging 
subordinates to wholeheartedly commit to serving the organization.  
While research results indicate that it can make mid -ranking military officers fit more seamlessly 
with the unit and become less willing to sacrifice their military careers, it is still a negative impact on 
the organization’s long -term development. Therefo re, the military performance appraisal system 
need to be adjusted and the introduction of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) concepts could be

32 
considered. Allowing subordinates to set annual KPI goals within the first three months of assuming 
a position, conducting KPI discussions between department heads and subordinates, integrating 
them with departmental KPIs, and performing checks on subordin ates’ KPIs after six months with 
necessary adjustments. At the end of the year, subordinates can evaluate themselves, breaking the 
uniform and equal performance appraisal system. This approach enhances mentor expertise in 
supervisors and compels subordinat es to abandon passive surface acting in dealing with work 
challenges. Optimizing the performance appraisal system will effectively differentiate the work 
performance of subordinates, correcting the prevailing negative attitudes towards work.

ID:87 - Coaching for Career Development: An Integrative Literature Review  
Shyamal Pandya & Gislene Ferreira dos Reis  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Importance  
In the rapidly evolving field of Human Resource Development (HRD), coaching aligned with 
International Coach Federation (ICF) standards is increasingly recognized as vital for career 
development (Carvalho et al., 2021). This reflects a shift towards personalized, adaptive career 
growth strategies in organizations (Gray et al., 2019). However, there's a notable gap in literature 
specifically exploring the effectiveness of coaching within HRD (Carvalho et al., 2023), especially as 
organizations increasingly favor individualized career paths and flexible development strategies 
(Cidral et al., 2021).  
 
Our paper addresses this gap by examining coaching's role and impact in HRD for career 
development. Coaching offers tailored solutions that align with both individual employee 
aspirations and organizational strategic goals (Johnson et al., 2021), essential  for personal and 
business success (Maamari et al., 2021). Despite its importance, this topic is underrepresented in 
existing HRD literature (Burleigh et al., 2022). Our study aims to critically analyze current coaching 
practices in HRD, their adherence to  ICF standards, and their effectiveness in fostering significant 
and lasting career development (Ribeiro et al., 2020). We intend to significantly enhance 
understanding and implementation of coaching as a key element in HRD strategies, adapting to the 
need s of the modern workforce and workplace.  
 
Research Purpose  
This paper aims to deepen the understanding of coaching's influence on career development in 
HRD. Our specific objectives are:  
1. To systematically review empirical studies focusing on coaching within the realm of HRD, 
particularly in career development.  
2. To conduct a thematic analysis to identify major themes and patterns in the application of 
coaching for career development.  
3. To pinpoint research gaps and propose avenues for future research and practice.  
 
Research Methods  
To address the research objectives of our study, we adopted the integrative review method. This 
approach is particularly useful for synthesizing research to create new frameworks and 
perspectives, especially in fields where the body of literature is vast a nd diverse (Evans & Pearson, 
2001; Whittemore & Knafl, 2005). We followed the five -stage review process outlined by Whittemore 
and Knafl (2005) to ensure methodological rigor.  
 
Stage 1: Problem Identification  
In the initial stage, we identified the problem, determined the review purpose, and specified the 
variables of interest. The problem identified is the underexplored role of coaching in career 
development within the context of HRD. The review aims to synthesize existing literature on this 
topic to illuminate the gap and unders tand the integration of coaching in HRD for career 
development.  
 
Stage 2: Literature Search  
The literature search involved a sequential process. We searched databases including Academic 
Search Ultimate, Business Source Ultimate, and Emerald Insight, focusing on literature published

34 
since 2019. Keywords used in the search were “coaching,” “career development,” and “human 
resource development.” This search yielded a substantial number of articles. We then applied filters 
to include only peer -reviewed, English -language journal articles,  which refined the results. Duplicate 
entries were removed, and articles were further screened by reviewing abstracts and 
methodologies. This process led to the selection of relevant empirical studies for the review.  
 
Stage 3: Data Evaluation  
We evaluated the quality of the final selection of articles, coding them as high or low based on 
methodological rigor and data relevance. All selected articles were assessed to ensure their 
thoroughness and relevance to our study on coaching in HRD and car eer development.  
 
Stage 4: Data Analysis  
The selected articles were analyzed to categorize their methods, subjects, contexts, and findings. 
This analysis aimed to integrate the various aspects of coaching as it pertains to career 
development within HRD, identifying common themes, patterns, and ga ps in the literature.  
 
Stage 5: Data Presentation  
The integration of the characteristics of the selected articles will be presented in a structured 
manner. This will include a comprehensive overview of the methodologies, data collection 
techniques, subjects, and contexts of the research. The aim is to pro vide a clear and detailed 
synthesis of the existing literature, highlighting how coaching is implemented in HRD for career 
development.  
 
Implications for HRD Practice  
The outcomes of this review are of considerable importance for HRD practitioners and career 
development professionals. Our analysis provides a strategic roadmap for integrating coaching into 
career development strategies, tailored to align with both indivi dual career goals and the broader 
objectives of the organization (Carrell et al., 2021). This balanced approach emphasizes the 
customization of coaching to individual needs while maintaining alignment with the overarching 
goals of the organization.  
 
Key findings suggest the need for HRD professionals to adopt a strategic approach in implementing 
coaching. This involves aligning coaching practices not only with the specific goals and culture of the 
organization but also with the unique career aspiratio ns of each employee (Peters, 2023). Such a 
dual -focused approach ensures that coaching is an effective tool for personal career advancement 
as well as for advancing organizational talent management objectives. Moreover, our research 
highlights the importan ce of developing a coaching culture within organizations as a critical aspect 
of HRD. This culture should foster continuous learning and adaptability, supporting proactive career 
management (Sarsur & Parente, 2019). In establishing such a culture, coaching  becomes more than 
an intervention; it is an integral part of the organizational environment, contributing to a more 
engaged, agile, and prepared workforce. The implications emphasize the importance of 
implementing coaching practices that are both individu al-centric and organizationally aligned. This 
strategic alignment is key to fostering a skilled and adaptable workforce.  
 
Conclusion  
Our comprehensive analysis uncovers the multifaceted role of coaching in career development 
within HRD contexts. The research underscores the potential of coaching to offer tailored support 
for individual career paths, while also highlighting challenges such as aligning coaching outcomes 
with organizational strategies and maintaining consistency in coaching  standards (Carvalho et al., 
2023). The paper concludes with a call for a strategic and thoughtful integration of coaching in HRD 
practices, recognizing both its potential benefits and limitations. We also identify a pressing need

35 
for further empirical research on the long -term impact of coaching on career development, 
particularly in diverse organizational settings.

ID:123 - Trauma Informed Leadership in Organizations  
Christina Cauble  
ABSTRACT  
 
Importance  
The twin pandemics in 2020 of COVID -19 and racial reckoning have led to individuals and 
organizations reexamining trauma, what it means, and what its ripple effects are. Trauma is not a 
new phenomenon, but perhaps due to the impacts of two globally traumat izing events happening 
in such a short period, it is finally being given the attention it deserves. There are real -world 
implications for traumas, especially when left unaddressed. Individuals and organizations suffer the 
consequences of unmet needs due to  trauma. Individuals who have experienced trauma are likely 
to experience a wide range of negative consequences, some examples include; frustration, 
cynicism, anger, brain fog, forgetfulness, distractability, depression, detachment, irritability, and 
being  less organized (Fink -Samnick, 2022; Koloroutis & Pole, 2021). It is easy to see how the 
consequences of trauma could influence how staff engage with their work and organizations. 
Although the impact of trauma on organizations has not been widely researche d, there is evidence 
that organizations are impacted by trauma. Trauma experienced by staff can lead to increased 
tension in teams, negatively impact: turnover, organizational costs, quality, and safety, as well as 
blur professional boundaries in organizai tons (Koloroutis & Pole, 2021; Fink -Samnick, 2022). There 
are specific industries that are more likely to expose their staff to traumas in the line of performing 
their work duties; including military, healthcare, and other human services industries (Bowen,  et.al, 
2011; Manderscheid, 2009). Trauma -informed leadership is a relatively new concept that focuses on 
how leaders and organizations can support staff during times of trauma.  
 
Purpose/ Question/ Theoretical Base  
The purpose of this paper is to explore the impacts of trauma on organizations and the people that 
make them up. The question driving this is; How can the field of HRD meet the growing need of 
workers and organizations to address trauma?  
 
Implications for Practice  
Staff in organizations want trauma to be addressed by organizations (Boitet, et. al, 2023). First, staff 
want organizations to mitigate panic (Manderscheid, 2009). This can relate to macro, or micro 
traumas happening in the workplace, and macro traumas hap pening outside of the workplace. 
Communication and preparation are both integral to organizations being able to do this effectively. 
Additionally, staff want to feel heard, protected, seen, prepared, and have facilitated coping and 
growth (Koloroutis & Pol e, 2021). There is much that organizations can do to address these needs.  
 
To start, there should be a focus on creating training and development programs that build skills in 
emotional regulation, conflict resolution, restorative justice, and compassion, all of which can 
contribute to addressing trauma more effectively (Ravitch,  2020). Furthermore, organizations can 
work to support reflective practices, which are effective in addressing trauma; examples of this 
could include collaborative reflective writing practice and listening and discovery sessions (Ravitch, 
2020). Lastly, pr actitioners can explore the ways that trauma impacts staff resistance to planned 
change initiatives, and work on identifying specific interventions related to trauma, including 
compassionate reactions to trauma responses.  
 
Conclusions  
This is a work in progress, however, preliminary research indicates that there are significant 
negative impacts on individuals and organizations when trauma is left unaddressed, that staff want

37 
organizations to address trauma, and that there are clear changes organizations can make to 
effectively address trauma and potentially tap into collective post -traumatic growth.

ID:135 - Reverse Mentoring as an Anchor for Retaining Gen Z Women in the 
Workforce  
Sanghamitra Chaudhuri, and Bhagyashree Barhate  
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Importance  
Labeled as lazy and entitled quiet quitters, Generation (Gen) Z has been a part of the workforce for 
at least six years. Surprisingly, despite their short organizational tenure, Gen Z has reported feeling 
burnt out and intention to leave their careers (Constantz, 2023). The recent Gallup poll suggests that 
54% of the Gen Z  employees are disengaged at work (Fernandez et al., 2023). They value work -life 
balance, and consequently demand remote work options, flexible hours, excellent pay, reasonable 
workloads, and seek interesting and purpose -driven work (Barhate & Dirani, 2021 ). Additionally, 
they are forever looking for alternate career paths such as gig working, starting their own business, 
or freelancing because of their digital influence and entrepreneurial spirit. However, they have 
reported to experience workplace incivil ity due to their conflicting views with older generations 
(Power, 2023).  
 
Generational clashes due to differing points of view have remained the top cause of workplace 
incivility (Akella & Lewis, 2019). Younger workers are subjected to myriad unconscious biases and 
stereotyping because they are vocal about work -life integration and a zeal for meaningful and 
purpose -driven work. This may result in an increasing gap between leaders and their expectations 
as they lack a deeper understanding of the actual expectations of these young netizens. 
Consequently, there is an impending threa t of losing valuable employees, especially women, as data 
suggests an unprecedented surge in resignations among women when they are denied their 
essential needs including opportunity, flexibility, and commitment to diversity and inclusion 
(Alsever, 2022). In fact, approximately 75% of women under 30 have expressed that flexibility and 
an organization’s dedication to well -being are paramount to their sustainability in the workplace 
(Alsever, 2022).  
 
Gen Z women are vocal about work -life integration and a zeal for meaningful and purpose -driven 
work. Since they are also more aware of their organizational rights (Grow & Yang, 2018), theycall out 
discriminatory behavior confidently. Further, it is posited  that Gen Z women have traditional work 
and family values. Although ambitious, they want to prioritize their family’s well -being (Carufel, 
2021); and create wholesome relationships at work with peers and superiors (Barhate & Dirani, 
2021). Additionally, th ey are their own advocates and are not timid when negotiating and asking for 
more from their work compared to Gen X and baby boomer females (Alsever, 2022). This newest 
generation of women in the workforce expects their superiors to take up the role of men tors 
(Barhate & Dirani, 2021). Thus, having a developmental relationship, such as reverse mentoring 
(RM), at the beginning of their career would provide them with the needed information and help 
them integrate within the organizational culture (Tomaskovic -Devey & Orellana, 2022)  
 
Theoretical Basis  
The quote at the beginning of this abstract captures the essence of our paper beautifully as we 
argue that Gen Z is the future of our workforce. Rather than alienating them from organizational 
practices, it is important to teach and learn from them. We ass ert that RM can be the anchor to 
achieve harmony and manage expectations among today’s multigenerational workforce. Reverse 
mentoring is defined as a non -traditional inverted form of mentoring relationship whereby the 
seasoned and more experienced employee s are paired as mentees with organizational novices as 
mentors, who are tasked with the opportunity to teach the senior mentees (Chaudhuri & Ghosh, 
2012; Murphy, 2012; Chaudhuri, 2019).

39 
 
The practice of reverse mentoring was first formally introduced in 1999, when the then CEO of 
General Electric, Jack Welch, introduced RM as a method to overcome the technological challenges 
that the executives faced. He paired 500 executives, mostly at th e C-suite level including himself 
with younger millennials who acted as mentors to train them on the basics of using internet. Since 
then, there is no looking back as reverse mentoring has found its place in multiple sectors and 
organizations including tea cher training (Porras et al., 2018), geriatric social integration (Breck at al., 
2018), and social network training in academics (Morris, 2017). More recently, reverse mentoring 
has been used to promote inclusivity among multiple generations in relation to  gender, ethnicity, 
and culture (Chaudhuri et al., 2021). Reverse mentoring has been proposed as a retention tool for 
millennials and can be used to engage them further. Therefore, this paper aims to promote reverse 
mentoring as an anchor and a cross -gener ational learning tool which would not only help the senior 
leaders understand the unique behaviors and career expectations of Gen Z women but would also 
help them retain.  
 
Research purpose  
Through a focused literature review, we will first provide an overview on Gen Z women and reverse 
mentoring, followed by development of hypothesis on how reverse mentoring can be used as an 
anchor to engage and retain Generation Z women in the workplace.  
 
Implications for HRD practice  
The findings of this paper have important implications to understanding how to retain and engage 
Gen Z women.

ID:142 - Creativity in digital coaching education: an auto -ethnographic 
approach  
Karine Mangion -Thornley, Arthur Turner & Alison Keyworth  
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
This paper offers a critical reflection of digital coaching education, specifically the use of creative 
coaching tools and techniques in the digital space. Digital coaching is defined as ‘a digital -
technology -enabled, synchronous conversation between a hum an coach and a human coachee’, 
which is distinct from artificial intelligence (AI) coaching (Diller & Passmore, 2023: 1). Coaching 
training is traditionally delivered face -to-face, yet the COVID -19 pandemic has shifted its delivery 
online or in hybrid set tings. Our enquiry follows a small -scale quantitative study which indicates 
that playfulness and creative approaches embedded in digital coaching education affects positively 
the self -awareness, self -reflection, and self -confidence of the students (Mangion -Thornley, 2023). 
However, little is known about how creative coaching approaches may be used in online coaching 
education to facilitate learning (Passmore & Woodward, 2023). It is important to explore how 
creative approaches could be adapted to support th e development of digital coaches.   
 
Theoretical base  
Creativity in coaching has emerged in the coaching literature in the past decade (Gash, 2019; 
Turner, 2020, 2022, 2023; Turner & Norris, 2022; Clutterbuck, 2023, Wheeler and Leyman, 2023). 
Elements such as the use of mediating objects form a wider circle o f ideas linked to andragogy. 
These techniques have been borrowed or re -interpreted within the co -coaching relationship which, 
itself, requires a more relaxed experiential set of approaches. From an adult learning perspective, 
this study draws on the semina l work of Rogers and Freiberg, Freedom to Learn (1970; 1994), which 
poses creativity and curiosity as two principles for enabling the learner to become ‘the architect of 
himself’ (Lones, 2000: 9), with trust and interpersonal relationship as pivotal to adu lt learning (2013). 
This is relevant to coaching education considering the importance of developing authenticity in 
coaching style and practice (Bachkirova, 2016).  
 
Research purpose  
This working paper is based on our reflections as coach educators on the use of creative techniques 
in digital coaching education. We use a collective auto -ethnographic approach (Koning & Moore, 
2020), which provides a method to explore intersubjectively o ur experience of engaging with our 
participants. Our aim is to reflect on how creative coaching techniques and tools can be adapted in 
the digital space and how they may support the development of authentic coaches. We adopt an 
inductive qualitative approa ch and will use thematic analysis method (Clark & Braun, 2017) to 
identify any patterns, discrepancies and key themes emerging from the data.    
 
Research questions  
• What creative tools and techniques can we bring to the digital coaching space to support the 
learning and development of coaches?  
• How may creative coaching approaches support the learning and development of coaches 
when used in the digital space?  
• What lessons can be learned from this study to inform the future practice of coach 
educators and coaches working digitally?  
  
Implications for HRD practice  
It is hoped that this study will raise awareness of how creative tools and techniques can be used 
effectively when coaching and/or facilitating other learning and development (L&D) programmes

41 
online. For professionals working within HRD, this study’s findings and recommendations may have 
several implications for practice, including:  
How more creative approaches could be incorporated into the design of any future online coaching, 
and how this may increase the accessibility of these programmes for diverse workforces;   
A contribution to curriculum design for digital coaching education.   
 
Conclusion  
This study offers a critical and intersubjective examination of our practice as digital coach 
educators, and how that might affect Human Resources mediated coaching programmes and 
coaching education.

ID:145 - Cultural Competence in Coaching – A structured literature review  
Henriette Lundgren, Angela D. Carter & Emmaleigh Klein  
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
 
This structured literature review aims at addressing a gap in coaching literature concerning the 
praxis of cultural competence within coaching education. While some papers have explored cultural 
competence and related concepts in coaching, the focus of man y of these studies has often been on 
cross -cultural topics and/or global mindset with fewer studies identifying what it takes to build 
coaches’ cultural competence in national and international contexts. We therefore focus our 
attention on mentoring, a rel ated field of developmental relationships where cultural competence 
has been much more explored. We reviewed 59 papers on cultural competence in mentoring, and 
we discuss promising practices and policy direction relevant for coaching education. Through thi s 
review, we highlight the importance of cultural competence development in coaching, bringing 
more awareness to educators and scholar - practitioners on integrating cultural competence training 
into their curriculum and development.

ID:188 - Utilizing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Concepts to Enhance Mentor 
Training  
Kevin Rose & Katrenia Reed Hughes  
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
 
Mentoring is a powerful tool for improving individual and organizational performance (Grima et al., 
2014). Individuals benefit from greater access to powerful networks, career advancement 
opportunities, and professional development. Organizations benefit f rom employees with greater 
job satisfaction, engagement, and desire to stay with the organization (Wilson & Elman, 1990). 
Mentoring is useful both for new and seasoned professionals, and, by adopting a relational 
mentoring framework (Ragins & Verbos, 2017) , individuals in a mentoring relationship can 
experience mutual benefit (Dobrow et al., 2012). It is, however, important to take issues of diversity, 
equity, and inclusion (DEI) into account when designing and deploying mentoring interventions. For 
example , by incorporating explicit discussions of privilege, identity, and power, greater authenticity 
can be achieved in mentoring relationships (Ghosh et al., 2020). In this manuscript, we discuss our 
work on developing mentor training that incorporates DEI con cepts and discussions. A series of 
workshops was delivered over the course of a year to faculty and students in an adolescent health 
program. The training modules we delivered included topics like uncovering privilege and 
oppression, mentoring with care, a nd having culturally conscious conversations. We utilized aspects 
of experiential learning in delivering the modules such that participants were asked to practice 
various mentoring skills with other participants before utilizing them in their assigned ment oring 
partnerships. This manuscript will describe the various HRD theories that undergirded our 
approach as well as the specific DEI theories we incorporated into the trainings. Additionally, we will 
discuss how the curriculum was both designed and deliver ed as well as its impact.

ID:189 - Overwhelmed, Lonely, Isolated: Reverse Mentoring, A Magical Wand 
for Neurodiverse Inclusion  
Sanghamitra Chaudhuri & Karen R Johnson  
ABSTRACT  
 
“There are four words I will never forget hearing: “Your son is Autistic.” After that, I didn’t hear 
anything the child psychologist said because I was fighting back the tears and thinking about how 
this was going to affect his future in this world. My son was neurodivergent, and it’s a diagnosis that 
doesn’t come with a manual because no two autism diagnoses are the same. It also means that one 
day, he may have to struggle to find support for neurodiversity in the workplace.” (Holtzlander, 
2023)  
 
The aforementioned excerpt underscores the existing lack of preparedness in contemporary 
organizations when it comes to hiring, managing, engaging, and retaining neurodiverse employees. 
Theoretical physics genius Albert Einstein, acting diva Jennifer Anist on, and environmental activist 
Greta Thunberg are all glaring examples of neurodiverse individuals. Neurodivergence refers to “a 
natural range of differences in human brain functions in the workplace based on alternative 
thinking styles, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, dyspraxia and 
dyslexia” (Szulc et al., 2021, pg. 858). Organizations are far from inclusive in creating a culture that is 
conducive to the neurodivergent employees as they often fall prey to isolation, stigmat ization, 
stereotyping, and biases (Hedley at el., 2018; Muller et al., 2003, Maroto & Pettinicchio, 2015) 
impacting their mental health and overall well -being (Mastroianni & Storberg -Walker, 2014).  In fact, 
a recently published article in MIT Sloan review  shared that while the global market for diversity, 
equity, and inclusion is expected to reach $28.9 billion by 2030, a significant oversight exists in most 
DEI programs where they tend to neglect neurodiversity. Despite indications that 15% to 20% of the 
global population is neurodivergent, only 1 in 10 organizations explicitly incorporates neurodiversity 
into their DEI initiatives (Russo et al., 2023). The challenge of creating an inclusive and supportive 
environment exponentially increases as there is no  one-size-fits-all approach to understanding such 
individuals since they all come with their own unique strengths and weaknesses with diverse skills 
and abilities. Therefore, in order to embrace neurodiverse employees, organizations should 
deliberately imp lement strategies that would encourage productivity, collaboration, and their 
engagement and subsequent growth. It should be noted that typical organizational strategies 
including training and coaching may not be enough in enabling these employees to thriv e. However, 
unconventional interventions, like ‘reverse mentoring’ could be an answer where hierarchical lines 
are diffused and employees with lived experiences are at the forefront of guiding their employers 
on what best supports their development and gro wth.   
 
The Self -Determination Theory (SDT) of motivation, proposed as a valuable framework for guiding 
employment for neurodiverse employees (Goldfarb et al., 2019), focuses on understanding the 
motivation underlying work choices and the extent to which an indivi dual's behavior is self -
determined. SDT encapsulates a set of three basic personal and psychological needs of autonomy, 
competence, and relatedness that are imperative for individuals’ growth and wellbeing (Dec et al., 
2017; Deci & Ryan, 2008). Autonomy is  the feeling that one has choice and having the ability to 
regulate oneself during life’s events. Competence means having mastery over one’s abilities and 
skills and being able to adapt to the environment. Relatedness is having a sense of belonging and 
connectedness with others (Ryan & Deci, 2000). All three components are key drivers of motivated 
behavior. The extent to which the three psychological needs are met is essential for optimal 
functioning in one’s environment including work (Ryan & Deci, 2000). It is important to create 
opportunities to satisfy one or more of these three basic needs to foster motivation.

46 
Neurodiverse individuals often find themselves compelled to take on jobs that may not align with 
their abilities or involve tasks that fail to capture their interest to secure employment. When there is 
a misalignment between job roles and personal interest s, it can lead to a decline in motivation, 
subsequently resulting in turnover and diminished employment stability (Goldfarb et al., 2021). By 
understanding and applying SDT principles, organizations can create environments that 
acknowledge the autonomy and  competence of neurodiverse individuals, promoting their intrinsic 
motivation and overall job satisfaction.  
 
In this context, introducing reverse mentoring could be an effective intervention. Reverse mentoring 
is an inverted form of mentoring whereby the seasoned and more experienced workers are paired 
as mentees with more junior and less experienced employees (M urphy, 2012; Chaudhuri & Ghosh, 
2012, Chaudhuri et al., 2021). Allowing neurodiverse employees to mentor their supervisors, who 
may be neurotypical and communicate specific needs, insights, and unique perspectives that would 
contribute to their sustained e ngagement and satisfaction in the workplace.  This approach not only 
promotes a more inclusive workplace culture but also directly addresses the psychological needs 
outlined in SDT.  Neurodiverse mentors can enhance the competence of their neurotypical 
colleagues by increasing their shared understanding of neurodiversity issues thereby fostering a 
sense of relatedness through increased empathy and collaboration. This, in turn, can significantly 
contribute to the engagement and retention of neurodiverse empl oyees, as they feel valued.  
 
The purpose of our paper is to provide an overview on neurodiverse individuals and their unique 
challenges as they try to assimilate in organizations and how reverse mentoring can be the conduit 
to help them feel more valued and engaged, thereby enhancing their work outcomes and retention 
in the organization.   
 
The findings of this paper can assist HRD professionals in developing a comprehensive reverse 
mentoring program in their organization that would specifically be targeted at engaging and 
retaining neurodivergent employees.

ID:243 - Authenticity dilemmas faced by coaches to -be: new challenges posed 
by digitalisation  
Andrea Toarniczky  
ABSTRACT  
 
Coaches are committed to maintaining authenticity in their professional identity and coaching 
process. However, the advent of digitalization presents new challenges to this goal. Various studies 
delineate that an authentic and impactful coaching process necessitates coaches to pos sess a 
profound self -awareness, through which they may explain and really embody their professional 
identity. Coach training programmes prioritise the enhancement of participants' self -awareness and 
proficiency in using different coaching tools. However, t hey fail to directly acknowledge the 
authenticity dilemmas that aspiring coaches encounter on their journey to become a coach. This 
study investigates the authenticity dilemmas encountered by 25 individuals participating in a year -
long online coach trainin g course. This study examines how participants experience digitalization 
related authenticity challenges, either as threats to their professional identity that they address via 
identity work, or as opportunities that they address through identity play. The  research included 
participants who engaged in semi -structured self -interviews to explore their perceptions of 
professional authenticity, as well as the issues and obstacles they encountered.  Thematic data 
analysis was applied, uncovering two main experie nces of authenticity dilemmas. In the first case, 
authenticity meant becoming your “true self”, where authenticity dilemmas were perceived as 
threats, and reparatory identity work was applied. In the second case authenticity was situational, 
and participan ts engaged in identity play. The interpretation of the digitalization related identity 
challenges was different in the two cases.

ID:267 - Tailoring and Transferability of coaching and coaching supervision 
models across sectors and contexts: challenges and considerations  
Helen Smith  
ABSTRACT  
 
This paper draws upon the professional experience of a group of five coaching supervision 
practitioners to inform and reflect upon practice in this field of supervision to compare and contrast 
with supervision in education. The author is one of a team of c oach supervisors practicing across 
multiple sectors, with strong educational links providing a unique perspective of coaching 
supervision models and techniques that may be tailored and transferred to the educational sector.  
Models and approaches from coaching supervision practice are shared and assessed in terms of 
transferability of outcomes for potential application within educational supervision. Models and 
approaches traditionally used in coaching supervision are explored . Exploration of tools and 
methods that can be applied to education may enrich the experience for the academic supervisor 
and student thesis dissertation. The aim is to offer a sustainable and lasting experience for the 
student that can be carried through to their future employment and result in a rewarding and 
fulfilling journey for themselves and the academic supervisor.  
 
Methodology applied is the analysis of practitioner case studies and applied models drawing upon 
the practitioner insight and experience to critique each model for academic ‘fit’.

ID:124 - Construction and Initial Validation of a Feminist Mentoring Behaviors 
Scale: Tailoring Mentoring Support for Women Professionals  
Ague Mae Manongsong, Supritha Kannan, Kathlyn Elliott & Kristy Kelly  
ABSTRACT  
 
Background and Theoretical Framework  
Women and minoritized women face obstacles in their careers due to sexism and racism that 
exacerbate their ability to develop and advance (Chesney -Lind et al., 2006). Mentoring is an 
established tool to help individuals develop in their careers, where a senior colleague provides 
developmental support formally or informally (Bergelson, 2014). Mentees experience accelerated 
career advancement and overall financial prosperity (McGuire 2014). However, current mentoring 
approaches often fail to adequately support women due to a lack of available mentors in positions 
of power and the hierarchical structure that does not align with the developmental  needs of 
marginalized women. (Méndez -Morse, 2004). The literature is also inconsistent on if United States 
and international -based populations experience mentoring similarly (Ghosh et al., 2022).  
Feminist mentoring through virtual platforms offers an alternative for women in patriarchal 
organizational settings. It transcends typical career and psycho -social support, integrating political 
awareness, mutual learning, and dismantling biases and inequa lities to better assist women's 
career advancement. Therefore, women can rely on technology to engage in the mentoring process 
circumventing inaccessibility in their current organizations. However, few studies properly explore 
this approach and provide a p arsimonious conceptualization (Manongsong & Collins, 2020). The 
study aims to validate the "Feminist Mentoring Behaviors Scale" (FMBS) through literature review, 
expert collaboration, and data collection from US and international populations, anticipating validity 
and reliability assessments.  
 
Methodology  
We conducted item generation in two rounds: literature review and collaboration with subject 
matter experts familiar with feminist mentoring. Next, due to limited access to women workers, 
MTRUK participants will be recruited via CloudResearch. The survey i ncludes screener questions on 
mentoring experiences, the FMBS scale, and demographic items. We are anticipating two rounds of 
data collection (500 participants in the USA and 500 outside). Inclusion criteria include identification 
as a woman, age 18 or old er, and employment. Demographics like race, marital status, etc., may 
allow for potential intersectional analysis. We will then run validity tests, including convergent, 
predictive, and discriminant validity through correlational analysis, multiple regress ion, as well as 
exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, respectively.  
 
Likely Conclusions & HRD Implications  
Expected outcomes include the identification of key behaviors of feminist mentoring, enabling 
future studies to explore its impact on women's career outcomes. We anticipate significant 
associations between the FMBS and related constructs in extant literatu re, including positive 
correlations with traditional mentoring, holding behaviors, and negative association with negative 
mentoring to support convergent validity. For discriminant validity, the FMBS should represent a 
distinct construct from similar model s (relational mentoring and cross -cultural counseling). For 
predictive validity, the FMBS should increase mentoring satisfaction, improve mentoring 
relationship quality, reduce impostor feelings, and enhance self -efficacy in career decision -making.  
Furthermore, a validated FMBS could assist HRD practitioners in developing more effective 
mentoring strategies to promote women's representation in leadership roles across industries, 
aiding in overcoming career barriers. The non -traditional mentoring appr oach supports diverse 
mentor -mentee relationships and mentor development, such as potentially increasing white male

51 
mentors' comfort levels in mentoring. Importantly, advocating for virtual mentoring in universities 
can retain talent while reducing women's burdens.

ID:67 - Facilitating Reentries in the Korean Labor Market: The Effectiveness of 
Training and Development Policy for Women with Career Interruption  
Hanna Moon  
ABSTRACT  
 
The purpose of this study was to analyze the current status of career -interrupted women’s 
vocational competency development and to suggest policy implications by focusing on the 
government -funded vocational competency development project to support reentry  into the labor 
market for women with career interruption. The study analyzed quantitative data, such as 
employment insurance databases and HRD -Net, and conducted in -depth interviews with suppliers 
and recipients of vocational training to identify the stat us and issues of career -interrupted women’s 
vocational competency development, training performance, and limitations. The researchers 
analyzed the data on women who participated in training for the unemployed by the Ministry of 
Employment and Labor and com pared the training performance of career -interrupted women with 
that of women who have never had a career interruption, by age and educational background. 
Meeting the needs of career -interrupted women with various career profiles was not easy. The 
structur al limitations of the labor market faced by women with career interruptions should be 
resolved, and policy support for soft -landing in reemployment should be further developed. On the 
basis of those findings, the authors suggest that the vocational compete ncy development project 
can be supported in a proactive way to meet various levels of demand, including specific support 
for start -up services.

ID:21 - Practitioners’ recommendations on diversity within a South African 
higher education human resource development curriculum  
Natalie Jonck -Small, Helen Meyer & Renier Els  
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
Integrating diversity into the human resource development (HRD) curriculum is a significant 
organisational (McGuire & Bagher, 2010) and HRD challenge. Despite recognising workplace 
diversity's essential role, there is a call to address its limited represen tation in HRD education, 
university curricula, and research (Bierema, 2010b; Hite & McDonald, 2010; Zachmeier & Cho, 2013; 
Hall, 2018).  
 
The implications of neglecting diversity in HRD education are underscored, emphasising adverse 
consequences for students, employers, and society (Hall, 2018). Consequently, new HRD graduates 
might enter the workforce with a misperception of diversity (Lim & Rager, 2015). To ensure HRD 
curriculum relevance, Sambrook and Stewart (2010) recommend incorporating HRD practitioners' 
(HRDPs) input, allowing their workplace experience to inform the HRD curriculum. Hence, this 
qualitative study sought HRDPs' perspect ives for recommendations to inform the South African 
HRD curriculum.  
 
Theoretical base  
Critical theory, defined as a framework that examines the interconnection of power structures, 
social arrangements, and ideology (Brookfield, 2014; Rocco et al., 2014), underpins this study. 
Critical theory enabled the researcher to explore power dynamics,  social hierarchies, and dominant 
ideologies related to diversity and the HRD curriculum (Brookfield, 2011; Bierema & Cseh, 2014; 
Rocco et al., 2018).  
 
Diversity is described as "the varying ways that people differ" (Byrd, 2014). Diversity consists of 
various dimensions, for example, race, gender, and sexual orientation, among others (Erasmus et 
al., 2019). Diversity in the workplace is a vital corporate strategy, aiming to enhance organisational 
management, gain a competitive edge, and maximise profits (Cletus et al., 2018). Workplace 
diversity contributes to bottom -line success, cost reduction, and improved employee retention, 
reflecting organisational c are for individuals (O'Donovan, 2017). Despite legislative efforts, 
challenges persist in fully embracing diversity in South African workplaces (Joubert, 2017).  
 
Diversity in the workplace must be recognised to ensure inclusive performance and improved 
production. It is well known that productivity thrives across varied skills, responsibilities, viewpoints, 
ethnicities, and backgrounds within diverse settings (Cletus et al., 2018; Hughes & Byrd, 2015). A 
diverse environment supports global adaptability, improved management, competitive advantage, 
and profit maximis ation (Kormanik & Rajan, 2010; Cletus et al., 2018) and stimulates personal 
growth, critical thinking, and innovation, contributing to organisational performance (Foma, 2014; 
Cletus et al., 2018). Failure to recognise organisational diversity could result in negative attitudes, an 
uncomfortable atmosphere, and workplace issues (Bierema, 2010a; O’Donovan, 2017; Cletus et al., 
2018). However, the literature on diversity within HRD curricula reveals a disconnect between its 
perceived importance as a core compe tency for practitioners and its limited integration into 
academic programmes (Hite et al., 2009; Bierema, 2010). While diversity is acknowledged in some 
HRD courses, it is not consistently covered (Kuchinke, 2002; Bierema, 2010). Consequently, there is a 
growing awareness of the importance of diversity in HRD, and there are calls for increased research 
and integration into curricula (Shirmohammadi et al., 2020). This paper addresses these calls as 
evidenced by the research purpose.

54 
Research purpose  
This research aimed to explore HRD practitioners’ recommendations concerning diversity within a 
South African higher education HRD curriculum.   
The researcher used qualitative research, specifically a qualitative descriptive design (Bradshaw et 
al., 2020) rooted in interpretivism (Chowdhury et al., 2022). The study population included HRD 
alumni who completed undergraduate HRD degrees at a South A frican university. The specific 
university was chosen because it is the only university in SA that offers HRD undergraduate and 
postgraduate degrees. All these HRD alumni are employed in various HRD positions all over South 
Africa (SA). Thus, the study pop ulation and sample consisted of HRDPs with experience in the HRD 
curriculum and HRD practice. HRDPs undergraduate HRD qualification also contributed to their 
theoretical knowledge of HRD and diversity. Therefore, participants could answer the research 
ques tions meaningfully. The researcher used purposive sampling, more specifically snowball 
sampling (Maree & Pieterson, 2019), to select nine participants from the study population and 
conducted virtual individual semi -structured interviews with these particip ants.  
For data analysis, the researcher prepared the data through transcription, ensuring systematic 
tracking of diverse datasets. To familiarise herself with the data, the researcher applied immersion 
techniques such as multiple readings and audio replay (Schur ink et al., 2021). The researcher and 
two co -coders identified codes by assigning single words to transcript units to generate general 
themes. The researcher presented themes and descriptions through a narrative and interpreted the 
data (Creswell & Creswel l 2018). To ensure trustworthiness, the researcher adhered to the quality 
criteria of credibility (peer scrutiny, member checking, and inter -coder agreement), transferability 
(triangulation using multiple data sources), dependability (keeping a journal), c onfirmability, (audit 
trail) (Nieuwenhuis, 2019; Schurink et al., 2021) and declared her bias (Creswell 2009). The 
researcher obtained ethical clearance from the university and adhered to all ethical considerations, 
such as informed consent, permission to conduct research, confidentiality, anonymity, no harm, 
and privacy.  
Research question/s  
• What recommendations can HRDPs provide to optimise diversity within a South African 
higher education HRD curriculum to align the curriculum with the workplace?  
 
Implications for HRD practice  
The research findings highlight significant implications for HRD practice and HRD academics. There 
is a clear need for incorporating diversity education from the undergraduate level throughout the 
HRD curriculum to ensure diversity is optimised and to alig n the curriculum with the workplace 
adequately. Recognising diversity dimensions like language, gender, disability, nationality, age, 
education, and culture requires tailored and inclusive learning strategies. HRD practitioners should 
utilise respectful an d inclusive learning materials, case studies, and open dialogue to promote 
understanding and mutual respect. Understanding the target group and developing tools for 
creating a culture of diversity and inclusion is crucial for HRD practitioners. HRD practit ioners 
should understand their target groups, embrace diversity for workplace success and innovation, 
and gain a competitive edge by attracting diverse talent.  
 
Conclusions  
This study explored HRDP's recommendations concerning diversity in the HRD curriculum to align 
the HRD curriculum with SA workplace requirements from a critical theory perspective. The findings 
included HRDP recommendations to inform the HRD curricula and HRD practice, which can be 
implemented in similar contexts. Overall, it became evident that diversity should be introduced 
from the undergraduate to postgraduate HRD cu rricula to ensure adequate workplace 
implementation.

ID:32 - Scientific Mothering: Workload negotiations for early and mid - 
Ruby Christine Mathew  
ABSTRACT  
 
Studies have reported the continued underrepresentation of women in professorial positions 
especially in SET subject areas as a growing concern (Rosa and Clavero, 2022). In the UK academia, 
the Athena Swan (AS) Charter established in 2005 is considered as a significant innovation to 
improve women’s representation in senior positions. The AS memb er institutions are encouraged to 
demonstrate their engagement with Athena Swan's gender equality principles in their award 
applications (Advance HE, 2020). Several studies (for example Barnard, 2017; Caffrey et al., 2016; 
Ovseiko et al., 2017) have report ed that the AS accredited universities show a measurable 
improvement in the structural and cultural barriers women face in those universities. However, 
scholars including Fagan and Teasdale (2021) question the legitimacy of such claims considering 
women fa ce persistent inequalities in academia. Furthermore, gender scholars criticise the 
scholarship has yet to establish the reason for women’s continuing peril in academic academia 
(Avolio, 2020).  
 
Research purpose  
Using a grounded theory approach, the current study addressed this gap by investigating the 
impact of AS accreditation on the lived experience of early and mid -career academics in UK SET 
subject areas. A single case study design was implemented, and an AS gold -awarded science 
department [considered beacons of gender equality] was selected for this purpose. The study used 
semi -structured interviews, document analysis and participant drawings as data collection methods.  
 
Research question/s  
To reflect the everyday experiences of women academics in an AS gold -awarded department, this 
research started with the question:  
1. What is the impact of Athena Swan accreditation on the lived experiences of women 
academics?  
Further questions emerged during the data collection:   
2. How do women in negotiate their everyday working life in their lab spaces?  
3. How do women negotiate their workload in relation to the Athena Swan departmental 
initiatives?  
 
Implications for HRD theory and practice  
Contradictory to the previous reports of the positive impact of AS accreditation in improving gender 
equality in accredited institutions, the findings of the current study shows that that the AS 
accreditation has failed to bring any positive impact on the everyday life of women. Furthermore, 
the AS action plans of the department have not translated into the everyday life of early and mid -
career researchers in this study.  This research extends the gender performative theory 
(Butler,2011) to organisational s paces arguing that the core values in academia remain gendered 
where the scientific labour becomes performative for women researchers in these spaces. It 
illustrates the gendered aspects of scientific labour in the lab spaces reproducing gendered 
relations .  
 
The theme of gender performative spaces was related to the workspaces which became embodied 
for women, where their bodies became highly visible in the lab spaces when it came to performing 
lab cleaning and maintenance work.  However, they become invisible when it comes to jobs 
associated with masculine strength and toughness including moving lab equipment for which men 
were preferred (Connell and Messerschmidt, 2015).  The findings extended the notion of academic

58 
housework (Heijstra et.al, 2017) to the science lab spaces where women’s embodied status 
challenges them in negotiating their workload.  While academic housework is understood in terms 
of teaching, administrative and pastoral care, women scientists in the current study were required 
to do the cleaning and maintenance work in their workspaces which is termed as ‘scientific 
mothering’ in this study. These lab spaces became performative for women where they were 
expected to clean after others, emptying bins, a nd keeping the lab space maintained.  This further 
symbolises the unpaid domestic labour at home which is often invisible and underappreciated.  
The findings further contradicted the studies such that of Tsouroufli (2019)’s whose documentary 
analysis examined the success and failure of AS accreditation in UK universities and claimed that 
the workload allocations in AS -accredited departments resulte d in fair workload allocation for 
women.  Instead, the current research found that the reported workload allocation model has not 
recognised the gendered division of work related to scientific work in the labs. This resulted in 
women in this study believin g that AS departmental initiatives are a tick -box exercise rather than 
translating into real -world impact for them.  
 
The findings provide an increased understanding of the AS accreditation program and its 
implications for accredited universities. The recommendations for the case study organisation can 
offer guidelines for the participating universities and the HR to form  policies and meaningful 
practices when implementing equality and diversity policies/ practices in their institutions.  Though 
the findings are mainly relevant to the case study department, the gender performativity related to 
gendered organisational space s may be relevant to those departments that are attempting to 
implement equality and diversity practices in their workplace.  Secondly, it provides Athena Swan 
itself an insight into the drawbacks of the self -accreditation programme which they can review a nd 
improve.  
 
Conclusions  
To conclude the findings of this research reject the previous claims of AS success portrayed through 
workload allocation models (Tsouroufli, 2019) and argue that gender becomes performativity in the 
lab spaces for women where women’s embodied status requir es them to perform mothering role 
which relates to the unrecognised, unpaid, poorly regarded and time -consuming nature of 
academic housework (Herman, 2018). The findings further imply that the scientific mothering of 
cleaning after others and maintaining t he lab which is time -consuming service work may take 
women away from actual rewarding research work which might hinder their career advancement 
opportunities (Macfarlane and Burg, 2019; Misra et al., 2017). This answers the questions raised by 
studies on w hy succession to senior roles can be harder for women, especially in SET subject areas.

ID:45 - Beyond the Mirage: Integrating the Afghan Refugees into the Fabric of 
American Life  
Khadija Al Arkoubi, Rajaa Shindi & Aya Abdeljalil  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The experiences of Afghan refugees in the United States of America, their adjustment process, and 
their inclusion into the institutional system in the country constitute a critically significant topic for 
both academic and policy research. Since the USA ha s welcomed nearly 90,000 Afghan refugees in 
the aftermath of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 (US Department of State, 2023), there 
is an urgent need to understand the challenges and opportunities that these refugees face in their 
new environmen t, as well as the factors and strategies that facilitate or hinder their successful 
integration.  
 
The unprecedented number in the recent history of US refugee admissions poses tremendous 
logistical and humanitarian pitfalls for the federal government and its partners. As for the Afghan 
refugees who were forced to leave everything behind including their  close family members, they 
confronted the new unknown reality of resettling in a completely foreign country during uncertain 
and unsettled times (Rai, Held and Haymes, 2023). Amid increased stress levels, trauma, and fear of 
what the future could bring, t his vulnerable population grapples with multiples challenges to adjust 
and integrate the fabric of American life.  
 
In this paper, we focus on the challenges and the prospects of an effective integration of Afghan 
refugees into the American society, culture, and economy. We draw on the experiences of previous 
refugee groups, such as the Somalis, the Iraqis, and Syrians as well as the current policies and 
practices of the federal, state, and local governments, and the civil society organizations.  
Considering the diversity of the Afghan refugee population, which consists of different ethnic, 
religious, linguistic, and educational backgrounds, and different levels of exposure to violence and 
persecution, we will first present a comprehensive overview  of their demographic characteristics 
and their geographic distribution in the U.S. We also note that “many Afghan refugees arrive 
unprepared for settlement in the U.S. and depend on government assistance during the first few 
years after resettlement.” (St empel and Alemi (2021, p. 4873)  
 
Second, we will discuss the many challenges this at -risk group encounters as it leads its life in the 
US. Examples include the phenomenon of violence. Savun & Gineste (2019) claim that it is more 
prevalent against refugees than by them. They contend that r efugees are especially prone to having 
their physical integrity rights violated by host states after terrorist attacks occur. They offer 
suggestive evidence that host state leaders use refugees as ‘scapegoats’ to divert blame and 
appease voters after terro rist attacks, and that this allows them to get away with violating refugees’ 
rights. This builds on Onoma’s (2013) observation that refugees are often subjected to violence in 
host states.  
 
It is also suggested that Afghan refugees suffer from discrimination and xenophobia which are 
serious problems affecting other groups of refugees. The increased Islamophobia over the past few 
years, has promoted hatred against Muslims in the US in general (Alfonseca, 2021; Konig -Reis, 
2017).  
 
Another key challenge is access to education, which is a pillar for refugees to enhance their abilities 
and knowledge, and to become part of their new communities. However, refugees may encounter 
difficulties in this area due to language barriers, lack of educational opportunities, and cultural

61 
differences. Moreover, finding affordable and safe housing is a hurdle for many refugees, 
particularly in high -cost areas. Housing instability can affect their ability to integrate and build new 
relationships in their communities (Refugee Council USA, Sept ember 2021). Besides, Afghan 
refugees may have health issues related to their experiences in Afghanistan, such as injuries or 
trauma from violence or displacement. Accessing healthcare in the USA can be challenging, 
especially if refugees are not familiar with the US healthcare system (National Immigration Forum, 
August 2021). Additionally, building social connections and support networks is important for 
refugees to feel welcomed and integrated into their new communities. However, language and 
cultural dif ferences, as well as trauma from their experiences, may make it difficult for refugees to 
establish social connections (Rai et al. 2023). As a result, economic integration and access to jobs 
becomes tough and may get tougher, if refugees have difficulty in  obtaining recognition or 
verification of their foreign degrees, certificates, or licenses. At times, it might be hard to assimilate 
the work culture and behave according to the organizational norms. In general refugees may have 
limited knowledge or awaren ess of the U.S. labor market, the job opportunities, the application 
process, or the legal rights and responsibilities.  
 
Third, we contend that the integration of Afghan refugees in the American eco -system requires a 
holistic and long -term approach that addresses their diverse and complex needs, such as affordable 
housing, education, health, employment, language, and social inclusion. It also entails sufficient 
resources and coordination among various stakeholders, such as the federal, state, and local 
governments, the resettlement agencies, the civil society organizations, and the host communities. 
Moreover, it involves reco gnizing and appreciating the potential contributions of Afghan refugees to 
the American society, culture, and economy, as well as respecting and protecting their human rights 
and dignity. Therefore, in the fourth section, we highlight some of these contrib utions to the 
American society, such as their skills, talents, entrepreneurship, and cultural diversity. We conclude 
with some policy recommendations and best practices for enhancing the integration outcomes and 
well-being of Afghan refugees and the Americ an host community.

ID:49 - Developing a Typology of Women Leaders’ Resistance in the Workplace  
Yonjoo Cho, Jiwon Park, Sumi Lee, Jieun You & Sokyum Yoon  
 
ABSTRACT  
In a reanalysis of 107 narratives of South Korean (Korean) women leaders from the lens of tokenism 
theory (Kanter, 1977), using the secondary analysis of qualitative data, we found that due to their 
token status in the workplace, most women leaders assimil ated to the dominant male group’s 
expectations, but a few managed to resist in their own way to bring in culture change in the 
organization (Cho et al., 2021b). This positive outlook of the study motivated us to conduct research 
on women leaders’ resistanc e to examine how they resisted their token status to create new norms. 
The purpose of this study, therefore, was to develop a typology of women leaders’ resistance to 
their token status in the workplace, using the ideal -type analysis (Stapley et al., 2021,  2022), which is 
a qualitative research method used for the construction of typologies from qualitative data in a 
systematic manner. Before going through the ideal type analysis process, we reviewed the literature 
on women leaders’ resistance including Cha udhary and Dutt (2022), Cho et al. (2021b), Jamjoom and 
Mills (2023), and Park et al. (2020), all of which conducted research on women leaders in diverse 
sectors (e.g., business) in non -Western contexts (e.g., South Korea) using interviews. In the review o f 
the literature, we identified commonalities (e.g., rejecting stereotypes) and differences (e.g., 
reflection, silence) among emergent themes.  
 
To go through the ideal type analysis process, we chose 145 narratives collected from seven 
qualitative studies that were previously conducted (Cho et al., 2015, Cho et al., 2016, Cho et al., 
2017, Cho et al., 2019, Cho et al., 2020; Cho et al., 2021a; Han  et al., 2018). After being familiarized 
with the narratives, we discussed until we reached consensus on five types of resistance identified 
as a result of the 2x2 matrix analysis: environmental readiness and the level of individual resistance. 
For instanc e, Type 1 is defined as showing a favorable environment (e.g., an organization or 
industry) and a women leader’s active resistance (e.g., culture change). After reviewing the assigned 
transcripts (narratives) independently, all met to discuss until a colle ctive decision was made about 
a given type and ended up with four types of resistance, which were indicated in the literature. 
However, we also discovered Type 5, which extant literature did not address or classify, as a few 
narratives show a women leader’ s change in their perspective of work -life balance by becoming 
more balanced from being work -oriented. This change seemed to occur with such experiences as 
female medical doctors’ sabbaticals and female entrepreneurs’ career transitions. A team of three 
researchers worked through the reliability check to finalize the five types of women leaders’ 
resistance. Remaining steps include forming the ideal -type descriptions, checking credibility, and 
making comparisons.  
 
This study contributes to research on women in leadership: first, this study is the first effort in HRD 
research to show the possibility of an untapped exploration in qualitative research using the ideal 
type analysis; second, the typology developed will add more explanatory power to Kanter’s 
tokenism theory by presenting how women leaders use resistance as a coping strategy to create 
opportunities as leaders in the organization; third, the typology will illustrate how women leaders 
use resistance to overcome challenges in male -dominated organi zations, with consideration of the 
unique cultural context, as in Korea; and lastly, the typology of women leaders’ resistance can be 
used for the development of women in the leadership pipeline in ways that show how they can 
strike a balance between their  efforts to effectively maneuver in the organization and their 
awareness of going their own way to bring in change in the organization.

ID:52 - Workforce differentiation in the global south  
Jaime Bayona  
ABSTRACT  
 
One of the key components of strategic HRM is workforce differentiation (WD). The objective of this 
paper is to demonstrate that while WD has helped organizations in the global south become more 
productive and competitive in local and international markets , it is important to acknowledge that 
the impact of WD on societal (specifically the labor market) and individual levels is not entirely 
positive. WD has contributed to the deterioration of the labor market and the alienation of workers 
in global south cou ntries. This is partially due to the differences in the labor market in these 
countries, characterized by higher levels of informal economy and lower levels of education. 
Consequently, workers who do not fall into the category of talented workers have face d 
impoverishment and struggle to transition into more skilled segments.  
 
In this paper, I will analyze five different variables that have fostered WD in global south countries 
and have had positive effects on organizational effectiveness. However, these variables have not 
had equally positive effects on the individual and socia l levels, particularly within the labor market. 
The variables to be analyzed are: (a) employability, (b) merit culture, (c) individualism, (d) talent 
concept, and (e) value creation. Through this analysis, it is concluded that Strategic HRM is creating 
an elite class in the global south, equalizing the highly talented workers of the global north. While 
this enables organizations and talented workers to compete globally, it comes at the expense of 
leaving a significant portion of the workforce in marginalize d jobs with limited prospects for 
development. Each subsection of the analysis will include an examination of the organizational, 
social, and individual levels.  
 
Following these analyses, and utilizing the same factors that were previously examined, I will 
present some alternatives to improve the influence of strategic human resources management in 
the region. These alternatives should be viewed as starting points to shift Strategic HRM's role from 
one of separation to integration and development, fostering a more inclusive and equitable labor 
market in the global south.

ID:57 - Equality and Diversity versus Equity and Inclusion: theorising HRD for 
social justice in extending working lives  
Russell Warhurst, Kate Black & Claire Hedley  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Importance for HRD  
 
An emerging challenge for ‘HRD in a digital age’ is to address the labour shortages and associated 
social consequences that are attributable to the premature withdraw of older -workers from paid 
employment.  These issues, combined with age -discrimination law, have resulted in organisations 
implementing policies  to extend working lives (EWL).  Mainstream HRD contributes to EWL and 
thereby ensuring equality and diversity through, for example, providing later -career development 
opportunities.  However, such contributions can reinforce disadvantage, and the potentia l of HRD 
for EWL in socially just ways to ensure equity and inclusion has yet to be realised.  
 
Research Purpose  
 
The emerging Critical HRD approach (Bierma et al., 2024) has much to contribute to achieving social 
justice in EWL.  Therefore, this theoretical working -paper has three purposes.  First, to examine the 
Critical HRD approach and to show how while mainstream  HRD is well intentioned, older -workers 
might be disadvantaged through the perpetuation of hegemonic, performative narratives.  Second, 
to critically theorise later -career in terms of identity threats and transitions.  Third, to propose new 
directions for HRD in relation to equity and inclusivity.  
 
Research Question/s  
 
The three research questions are as follows.  First, to what extent does the current emphasis within 
mainstream HRD on enabling equality and diversity in organisations, ameliorate the disadvantage 
experienced by older -workers?  Second, how can HRD be better theorised to inform research and 
practice for EWLs?  Third, how can thi s theorising enable HRD to better support equity and inclusion 
for older -workers?  
 
Theoretical Base  
 
The paper analyses and evaluates the extensive theorisation of later -career but notes the restricted 
theoretical bases of HRD in general.  In deepening understanding of HRD in relation to EWL, the 
paper critically evaluates social constructionist identity theorising (Black et al., 2018) showing how 
later -career poses identity opportunities but also identity threats.  The paper then builds upon 
identity theorising using the Foucaultian notion of governmentality (Bardon et al., 2023) to show 
how HRD can be co mplicit in restricting the identity positions available to older -workers thereby 
working against inclusivity and denying social justice.  
 
Implications for HRD  
 
The findings of the study have implications for HRD in three areas.  For HRD researchers, the 
potential of a critical approach for extending theoretical understanding is shown.  For HRD 
practitioners, it is established that critical reflection is needed on  how established approaches to 
EWL might perpetuate disadvantage for workers in later -career.  For HRD policy -makers a range of

68 
interventions at the organisational and individual levels are explored such as redesigning career 
paths and changing attitudes to career progress.   
 
Conclusions  
HRD has contributed to substantial gains in equality, with diverse groups being better represented 
in organisations.  However, for older -workers who are not in positions of power, premature exit 
from paid employment is typical, and equity and inclusion are  elusive.  Organisational development 
is needed to cultivate the acceptance of older -workers’ changed capabilities and individual 
development is needed to enable older -workers to reflexively evaluate prevailing narratives of 
striving to ‘become’ better, in  light of the traditional wisdom of enjoying ‘being’ authentically oneself 
in later -life.

ID:71 - Race -conscious Scholarship in Human Resource Development: A 
Structured Literature Review  
Stephanie Sisco, Angela Carter, Jeremy Bohonos  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Importance  
 
There is overwhelming evidence documenting the pervasiveness of racism in workplaces. Various 
statistics illustrate this reality, notably the racial wage gap which reveals Black workers in the United 
States typically earn about 24% less than White workers (Wilson & Darity, 2022). This gap worsens 
when disaggregated by race and gender showing that Black, Latina, and Indigenous, women make 
roughly 60 cents per dollar earned by White men (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2022). 
Thus, in our study we focu s on race because racialization and racism continue to be part of the 
human experience for racial minorities within the United States and other multi -racial societies 
(Nkomo, 2021; Roberson, 2023; Paluch & Shum, 2023). We also realize that the historical e xistence 
of workplace racism has significant implications on how antiracism is presently enacted within 
organizations (Bohonos & James -Gallaway, 2022).  
Like many others around the world, renewed attention to racism was met within the human 
resource development (HRD) community after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. In response, the 
Academy of HRD Board issued a statement in support of Black lives and formed a standing Anti -
Racism Committee. HRD journals were also attentive to racism. Yet, despite this surge of interest 
toward race, the AHRD community has not produced a literature review specifi cally focused on race 
conscious research in HRD.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an up -to-date review of race conscious research in HRD that 
will provide analysis of the state of race in the field and suggest directions for future research. 
Questions driving this research include 1) What topics a re reoccurring within race -conscious 
literature in HRD? 2) What frameworks have been leveraged to engage in discussion about race in 
HRD?  
 
Methods  
 
In this structured literature review researchers searched all Academy of Human Resource 
Development and University Forum for Human Resource Development affiliated journals (Human 
Resource Development Review, Human Resource Development International, Human Resource 
Development Quarterly, Advances in Developing Human Resources, and European Journal of 
Training and Development) as well as New Horizons in Adult Education and Human Resource 
Development and identified over 50 articles focused on race or racism in  HRD journals between 
2010 and 2023. The research shows that over half of all articles in the review period were published 
in the final three -years of the review window.  
 
Implications for Practice and Conclusions  
 
In this in -progress research paper, several factors will be analyzed including research methods most 
commonly used, the theories and core constructs that inform the work, prevalent themes, which 
racial groups receive the most focus, what identities are dis cussed as intersectionally linked to race, 
which national contexts the research was conducted in, and which HRD journals have demonstrated

70 
the deepest commitment to publishing research about racism. Through this comprehensive 
analysis the authors intend to provide implications for practitioners, summarizing key points 
regarding actionable strategies informed by the literature. Additionally, t he paper will address 
implications for research by suggesting future directions for HRD scholarship centered on race and 
racism.

ID:85 - The Impact of Conflict with Coworkers on Job Satisfaction Among 
Elderly Employees: Mediating Effect of Positive Problem -Solving Attitude and  
the Moderated Mediating Effect of Health Status  
Yukyung Lee, Jaehyun Kim, Ji Hoon Song  
 
ABSTRACT  
Paper’s importance  
 
This study delves into the relationship between interpersonal conflict and job satisfaction among 
elderly employees, highlighting how positive problem -solving attitudes and health status play a 
mediating and moderating role, respectively (Yeung et al., 2015). In an era where the elderly 
workforce is exp anding, understanding their unique challenges, such as adapting to new 
technologies and generational differences in the workplace, becomes crucial (Beitler et al., 2018; El -
Hosany, 2017). These challenges can significantly influence their job satisfaction and overall 
performance (Frone, 2000).  
 
The research aims to unravel the intricate dynamics between conflict, problem -solving, health 
status, and job satisfaction in elder workers. By focusing on positive problem -solving strategies, the 
study seeks to offer new perspectives on reducing workplace  tensions and enhancing colleague 
relationships (Hillman, 2014). The inclusion of health status as a key factor recognizes its impact on 
work capacity and interpersonal interactions, which may exacerbate workplace conflicts. This aspect 
is especially relev ant in understanding work -family issues and the motives of older workers in the 
workplace (Thrasher, Zabel, Wynne, & Baltes, 2016). Furthermore, the comprehensive approach to 
conflict resolution in the workplace proposed in this study aligns with the guide lines and strategies 
outlined by Masters and Albright (2002).  
 
These findings hold substantial significance for human resource management, particularly in 
societies undergoing rapid demographic shifts. Understanding how elder workers handle conflicts 
and the role of their health status can assist organizations in form ulating customized strategies to 
support this segment of the workforce, thereby fostering a harmonious and productive workplace 
environment. Other studies further emphasize the importance of organizational support in 
balancing personal and professional lif e and in understanding age -related differences in conflict 
management strategies(Haji & Rahman, 2021; Yeung et al., 2015). These insights are crucial not only 
for effective human resource practices but also for policy making aimed at efficiently managing 
elder workers in modern work settings.  
 
Theoretical base  
 
This study is theoretically grounded in the intersection of interpersonal conflict, job satisfaction, and 
health status, especially within the context of the elderly workforce. Central to this exploration is the 
application of conflict resolution theories,  which suggest that fostering positive problem -solving 
attitudes can effectively mediate workplace conflicts, ultimately enhancing job satisfaction among 
elder workers (Hillman, 2014). These theories emphasize the significance of employing constructive 
methods to resolve conflicts and promote improved intergenerational relationships within the 
workplace (De Dreu & Van Dierendonck, 2004).  
 
Furthermore, the research incorporates principles from health psychology, emphasizing the crucial 
role of physical and mental health in elder employees' work performance and conflict resolution 
capabilities. The study proposes a moderated mediation model that examines the influence of

72 
health status on the effectiveness of problem -solving strategies in managing workplace conflicts 
and improving job satisfaction for elder workers (Liu et al., 2018).  
 
Through this framework emphasizes the need for human resource management strategies that are 
specifically tailored to the unique needs and contributions of elder employees, especially in a work 
environment that is rapidly adapting to demographic changes.  
 
Research purpose  
 
The main objective of this study is to investigate the impact of interpersonal conflict on job 
satisfaction among elder employees, with a focus on the role of positive problem -solving attitudes 
and the effects of health status. This research aims to unders tand how elder workers manage 
conflicts in the workplace and how these conflicts, along with their problem -solving approach and 
health condition, influence their job satisfaction (Frone, 2000). By exploring these aspects, the study 
aims to provide valuable  insights for Human Resource Development (HRD) and organizational 
behavior, especially in developing strategies and policies that support and accommodate the elder 
workforce to improve their well -being and productivity in the workplace (Appelberg et al., 1 991; 
Faucett et al., 2013).  
 
Implications for HRD practice  
 
This study presents strategic HRD interventions aimed at enhancing job satisfaction among elder 
employees through initiatives in conflict resolution and health -based customization. Emphasis is 
placed on developing training programs for elder employees that  promote positive problem -solving 
strategies, addressing challenges like adapting to technology and bridging generational gaps (Lim & 
Ling, 2012). Additionally, the importance of Health Status -Driven Customization in HRD strategies is 
highlighted, advocati ng for flexible work arrangements and ergonomic workspace designs catering 
to the physical and mental health needs of elder employees (Khamlub et al., 2013).  
 
Organizations are urged to focus on comprehensive health and wellness initiatives specifically for 
the elder workforce. These include regular health screenings and stress management sessions, 
aimed at enhancing overall health and improving conflict managem ent skills (Kossek & Ozeki, 1998). 
Creating an inclusive organizational culture is also essential, promoting respect and 
intergenerational collaboration to improve mutual understanding and communication.  
 
The study recommends incorporating feedback and continuous improvement measures to assess 
and refine HRD interventions, ensuring their ongoing effectiveness for elder employees. 
Furthermore, it suggests that the findings be used to formulate organizational  policies supportive of 
elder employees. These policies should address issues like ageism, provide flexible retirement 
options, and offer continuous learning and career development opportunities, all geared towards 
supporting the elder workforce within org anizations.  
 
Conclusion  
 
In summary, this study illuminates the management and support of an elder workforce, with a focus 
on the relationship between workplace conflicts and job satisfaction. Key findings demonstrate the 
significant role of positive problem -solving attitudes in mediating the effects of  workplace conflicts 
on job satisfaction. Additionally, the study highlights the beneficial impact of good health status in 
mitigating conflict -related negative outcomes (Lee et al., 2020).  
 
The study's practical recommendations for HRD and organizational practices include implementing 
customized conflict resolution programs and comprehensive health initiatives tailored to the elder

73 
workforce (Findler et al., 2007). These interventions, in addition to flexible working conditions, an 
inclusive communication culture, regular employee satisfaction assessments, and continuous 
learning opportunities, are essential for establishing a suppor tive and productive work environment 
(Converso et al., 2020).  
 
Ultimately, the research offers practical advice for HRD practitioners and organizations to improve 
job satisfaction among elder employees. By implementing these strategies, organizations can 
cultivate a healthier, more inclusive, and efficient workplace, effectively addressing the unique 
needs and integrating the valuable contributions of the elder workforce.

ID:111 - Navigating the Academy as Immigrant women in different roles: A 
duoethnography of a faculty member and a doctoral student’s journey  
Alene O' Malley & Rajashi Ghosh  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This duoethnography explores the unique and at times shared lived experiences and perspectives 
of two immigrant females, one a tenured faculty member and the other a doctoral student, as they 
navigate the complex terrain of academia. Utilizing critical feminist and intersectional theories, this 
study illuminates the nuances, challenges, and triumphs encountered by these two women within 
the hierarchical and predominantly patriarchal structures of higher edu cation. Drawing on the 
principles of collaborative storytelling and reflexivity, the present research examines the 
intersecting identities of the tenured faculty member and the doctoral student, unraveling the 
intricate web of race, gender, class, and powe r dynamics that shape their academic journeys. 
Through in -depth interviews, personal narratives, and critical reflection, the study highlights the 
participants’ unique standpoints while exploring the commonalities and disparities in their 
experiences withi n academia and also uncovering how their upbringing and inherent values and 
beliefs shaped these experiences. This duoethnography aims to reveal the interplay of power 
dynamics, mentorship relationships, and institutional structures, exploring how these dy namics 
influence knowledge production, pedagogical approaches, and the perpetuation of systemic 
inequalities within academia.  
 
In doing so, it contributes to the ongoing discourse on diversity, equity, and inclusion in higher 
education by offering nuanced insights into the lived experiences of female minority scholars. It 
calls for critical reflections on power dynamics, structura l inequalities, and the imperative for 
transformative practices within academia to foster a more inclusive and supportive environment for 
international scholars from diverse backgrounds.

ID:129 - The Role of Privilege in Workplace Relationships  
Eunbi Sim, Bhagyashree Barhate & Tonette Rocco  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
 
Privilege research has predominantly focused on White male privilege (e.g., Carbado et al., 2016; 
McIntosh, 1989, 1992) or other distinct privileged identities such as heterosexual, class, religion, and 
citizenship. Even though scholars have called for exp anding the understanding and deconstruction 
of privilege (e.g., Black and Stone, 2005; Case et al., 2012; McIntosh, 2012; Rocco and West, 1998), 
little has been done. Privilege affects workplaces and workers in terms of engagement (Shuck et al., 
2016), and  organizational culture and dynamics (Clark et al., 2002). Organizations are positioned to 
influence systems of power and privilege, which then enable organizational conditions that impact 
employee attitudes (Shuck et al., 2016). Employee attitudes also in fluence organizational culture, 
norms, and relationships. Organizational culture, team building and maintenance, relationships 
between workers and supervisor -subordinate relationships are affected by earned and unearned 
privilege in any workplace. We belie ve there is a need to critically examine how earned and 
unearned privilege affects work -based relationships.  
 
Research purpose  
 
The purpose of this paper is to understand the influence privilege has on relationships at work.  
 
Research question/s  
• How does unearned and earned privilege influence work relationships between colleagues?  
• How does unearned and earned privilege influence supervisor -subordinate relationships at 
work?  
• How does unearned and earned privilege of team members influence teamwork?  
 
Theoretical basis  
 
Privilege is “any unearned asset or benefit received by virtue of being born with a particular 
characteristic” (Rocco & West, 1998), which might include “unearned advantage” to safe spaces and 
“conferred dominance” when one group has power over another (Mc Intosh 1989, p. 10). A person 
can have intersecting identities that bestow unearned advantage (privilege) and disadvantage 
simultaneously.  Earned privileges are “any earned conditions, skill, asset, or talent that benefit its 
possessor” (Bailey, 1998: 109 ). Earned privilege is attained through effort directed at achieving a 
goal (Rocco and West, 1998) though access to the resources needed to achieve the goal is often 
easier to attain if one enjoys unearned privilege (Rocco et al., 2023). Earned or unearned  privileges, 
often experienced at the individual level, are manifested and operationalized by power at the 
organizational level, and power needs to be understood within relationships between individuals 
with different identities (Shuck et al., 2016). Intro duced intersectionality to diverse social identities 
(e.g., age, class, (dis)ability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation) are intersecting 
and interdependent shaping experience (Crenshaw (1989) Cho et al., 2013). Employees make sense 
of their tasks and the workplace through workplace relationships. Individuals develop relationships 
in the workplace by exchanging and coordinating knowledge and ideas (Teboul & Cole, 2005). 
Teboul and Cole (2005) suggest three tenets to relationship develo pment – exploration, 
development, and maintenance and fluctuation.

76 
Implications  
 
An understanding of privilege’s influence on workplace relationships has the potential to increase 
understanding of teamwork, supervisor -subordinate and peer relationships and how these 
relationships affect productivity.

ID:152 - Exploring the Impact of New Digital Technologies on Work life 
Integration of Migrant Women in Scotland  
Loliya Kagher, Cai Jing, Elham Moonesirust  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This is a progressive study from previous research on the work -life balance of women of African 
origin in the United Kingdom (Akobo & Stewart, 2020). The research highlighted four key themes 
that inform the work -life priorities of women African origin in t he United Kingdom. These include 
financial commitments, immigration policies, personality types and cultural sensitivities (Akobo & 
Stewart, 2020). Moreover, disruptions like increased reliance on digital technologies, COVID -19, 
BREXIT, and the war in Ukra ine (Sky News, 2023, Carroll, 2024) inform current realities and 
discussions about citizens' work life integration within geographical spaces (Dwivedi, Y. K. et al. 
2020; Ekuma, 2023). Employees in the workplace are continuously adopting the use of digital  
technologies like AI for task management, increased productivity, work creativity, innovation, writing 
and data management (Reijers, & Coeckelbergh, 2020; Rajagopal & Behl, 2022; Alrasheedi, et al, 
2022) despite the concerns in relation to potential risks  it possess to businesses. (Carroll, 2024).  
Furthermore, reflecting on the relevance of inclusion and belonging in the workplace (Allen, K. -A. et 
al 2021), this study establishes the need to further understand existing social and evolving 
technological influences that impact work -life integrations o f employees from a diversity 
perspective. Consequently, this study aims to explore the impact of digital technologies on the work 
life integration of migrant women in Scotland. This is with the aim to not only understand how 
digital technologies are being adapted alongside psychosocial expectations of migrant women, but 
also to inform human resource development discourse (Rotatori et al, 2021; Watkins & Marsick, 
2023) in relation to intentional practices for advancing inclusion and belonging in the workplac e.

ID:134 - Community -led research: A case study of supporting the GTRSB UK 
community into Education  
Patricia Jolliffe, Helen Collins & Sue Barry  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Community -led research: A case study of supporting the GTRSB UK community into Education  
The article contributes to the scholarly discourse on the influence of partnerships and collaborative 
interventions between (educational) organisations and communities. Utilising the theoretical 
framework of social capital (Bourdieu, 1986; Putnam, 2000), t his longitudinal study critically 
examines initiatives co -imagined, designed, and implemented to facilitate the support of a 
marginalised community, specifically the Gypsy Traveller Roma Showmen and Boater (GTRSB), in 
their pursuit of Education.  
 
Gypsy Traveller Roma Showmen and Boater (GTRSB) are notably underrepresented, for example, in 
Higher Education (HE), with only 3 -4% of the population aged 18 -30 accessing it, as opposed to 43% 
of the general population in the same age group (Greenfields, 2 017). Research findings (Atherton, 
Dainty, & Roberts, 2020; Forster, Gallagher, & Cooper, 2020; Mulcahy, Baars, Bowen -Viner, & 
Menzies, 2019) suggest that even when individuals from GTRSB groups enrol in universities, many 
experience a sense of invisibilit y and feelings of unwelcome. For example, some identify concerns 
about unconscious bias, low institutional awareness regarding their ethnic identity, and a fear of 
encountering racist stereotypes if they choose to self -identify (Hall, 2020).  
This research will share our journey of working with the GTRSB community over nine years to the 
point where our institution has signed the GTRSB into Higher Education Pledge. The Pledge compels 
participating universities to conduct data monitoring, evaluat ion, outreach, and the appointment of 
a named contact (Brassington, 2022). In signing the Pledge, the University commits to 
understanding and meeting the community's needs, including raising, building, and sharing internal 
and external knowledge awareness.   
 
Our methodology places a significant emphasis on the participant's voice by utilising a Community -
Based Participatory Research (CBPR) whose roots lie in Frieire's pedagogy (Heidemann & Almeida, 
2011), aligned to our 'partnership working to seek meaningful data  for social transformation' 
(Byrne, Canavan, & Millar, 2009, p.:68). Employing a phenomenological approach ensured that 
participant subjectivity was fundamental and avoided the temptation to prioritise the researcher as 
expert.  In other words, we chose ex plicitly to go back to 'the things themselves', to paraphrase 
Husserl's (1969) phenomenological motto, and to study worker experiences as framed by the 
workers themselves rather than make a priori assumptions about them. The task is complex and 
time -consum ing since it rests on engaging and leveraging the support of many different actors 
(Jongbloed, Enders, & Salerno, 2008). For example, university professional services, senior 
management, local NGOs, the Charity sector, the Council and the Housing Associati on. Engaging 
and linking in partnership forms a holistic educational ecosystem (Niemi, 2016).  
We identify the challenge faced by traditional structures, such as Universities, to effectively connect 
with communities they purport to represent, e.g., in vision statements and demonstrate how it is 
only when communities play a central role in decision -making and actively participate in design, 
implementation, and evaluation of interventions is the dream realised. Using action and dialogue, 
the University's collaborations with the GTRSB communities have created a symbiotic relationship. 
This symbiosis is an adaptable and responsive system wherein various actors act as subsystems, 
operating in parallel and responding to unpredictable, non -linear, and spontaneous ways 
influenced by evolving circumstances. Via the symbiotic relationship, supported by bonding and 
bridging social capital, a cascade of effects is generated, fostering the continuity of the intervention

80 
and giving rise to micro -interventions. Collectively, this aligns with an educational ecosystem 
approach between educational organisations, communities, and other actors and draws on bio -
ecological theory, which posits human development, is influenced by i nterconnectedness and 
interrelationships between stakeholders and through the exchange of resources and information 
(Bronfenbrenner, 1979). This 'developmental contextual -ism' (Lerner, 1995) can elucidate the value 
of ongoing holistic and participatory int erventions and the opportunity for positive reciprocal bi -
directional impacts across micro, meso and macro levels.

of critical sense -making & sense -giving narratives in enhanced digitalised and 
hybrid work contexts  
Elaine Yerby & Rebecca Page -Tickell  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Communities of Practice (CoPs) first coined by Lave & Wenger (1991, p. 42) have been an 
established part of organisational learning for over 30 years as a mechanism for sharing knowledge 
and learning within and between organisations. Whilst application and  definition can vary CoPs are 
commonly understood to be a means for professionals to voluntarily share their knowledge and 
experiences around a specific domain of interest in order to engender changes in practice or 
behaviour (Arthur’s, 2016; Li, Grimshaw,  Nielsen, Judd, Coyte, & Graham, 2009).  In addition to 
knowledge sharing and learning CoPs play a role in driving innovation (Jørgensen, & Keller,2008; 
Morton, 2012) and due to socio -political factors at play in CoPs used to defend specific interests of a  
professional or managerial groups (Nicolini, 2022). Given their organisational prominence CoPs 
have received considerable empirical attention but there are calls for further research to 
understand how work -related identities shape CoP processes and how Co P mechanisms of 
knowledge and organisational innovation have been shaped by enhanced digitalised and hybrid 
work (Nicolini et al, 2022, Ajzen, & Taskin,2021 and du Preez, 2010).). In addressing these calls and in 
acknowledgment of the inherent power and po tentially emancipatory role of CoPs, this research 
examines, through a Critical Sense Making (CSM) lens, how CoPs can drive bottom -up or employee -
led policy change in enhanced digitalised and hybrid work contexts.  
 
In the change management literature, there is not a defined literature on bottom -up or employee 
led change, it tends to be packaged in different ways (e.g. organisational learning, process theory of 
change, creativity, diffusion of innovations, imposed vs.  evolution in both strategy and change and 
found within the change agents literature). Yet, a re -focus on bottom -up change is significant in the 
view of the ongoing high rates of change initiatives that fail, often due to a lack of buy -in from 
employees (R osenbaum et al, 2018). Policy change often fails when employees feel they have 
limited influence on policy design and implementation (powerlessness) and or that new policy is 
meaningless to them in terms of their front line role (Tucket et al, 2021). Thus,  CoPs become an 
important vehicle for understanding their potential role in of bottom -up change due to members' 
shared interests.  
 
In order, to contextualise the research in enhanced and hybrid work contexts Critical Sense Making 
(CSM) theory (Aromaa, Eriksson, Helms Mills, Hiltunen, Lammassaari, & Mills, A. J. ,2019) is applied 
as an alternative to the Weick (1988 and 1995) sensemaki ng approach, which has been critiqued for 
neglecting issues of power and wider contextual factors (Helms Mills, 2003). Weick (1995) defined 
sense making as “the making of sense” (Weick, 1995, p. 4), through making explicit the implicit 
understandings of th e actors in the situation, so that choices are made about how to act. (Weick, 
Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 2005).  CSM takes this approach further by critically viewing the sensemaker as 
an actor in context with full consideration of power and context to evaluat e agency and the 
sensemaking of researchers themselves (Aromaa, Eriksson, Helms Mills, Hiltunen, Lammassaari, & 
Mills, ,2019. Sensemaking and sense giving are both explored in narratives of how bottom -up 
change can emerge from the CoP and addresses calls f or more research in sense giving experiences 
from those other than senior leaders and middle managers. Sensemaking and sensegiving lenses 
can be used to understand narratives and identity processes in organisations and thus provides a 
practical vehicle to explore how identities are maintained, constructed and reconstructed in 
bottom -up change management activities driven from membership of the CoP.

83 
 
Methodology  
 
The focus of this piece of research is on the narratives and meaning made through the lived 
experience of internal workplace mediators who are members of a CoP.  This will be identified and 
analysed through narrative research (Clanidin & Connelly, 2000). A s a working paper this research is 
at the data collection stage. Participants are workplace mediators who are members of a CoP of 
mediators within the UK.  A convenience sample has been conducted and is highly appropriate for 
narrative interviews which are  co-produced between both interviewer and interviewee, but led by 
the interviewee. Narratives and stories are omnipresent in organisations and are powerful in 
shaping the way that individuals and groups within organisations perceive issues (Bandola -Gill  &  
Smith, 2022). The interviews are taking place over two periods, with around 3 weeks between them. 
It is intended that the preliminary outcomes of these interviews will be presented with a summary 
of the literature review with a discussion of the emergent findings and implications for practice.

ID:163  – Languages in University Education – A Literature Review  
Eduardo Tomé  & Elizaveta Gromov a 
 
ABSTRACT  
Purpose and Importance  
 
In a globalized world languages have importance, because they are like a cultural passport to other 
cultures. In this paper we want to analyse a very specific problem regarding languages – the fact 
that a student studies in a context in which he or she has  to use as course work language in 
Universities a language that it is not his main language, and one that he does not speak at home. 
We believe this divergence may cause much difficulty to the students, and particularly in a very 
specific situation. This s ituation arises when the language in which the class in performed is an 
official language in the country from which the student comes from, but at home in their own 
country the students talk in a different language with his family. This situation may happe n in 
relation to African students, that come from the Anglophone, Francophone or Portuguese Spealing 
countries in Africa and have home language as dialects, and go to study in the UK, France or 
Portugal respectively. What follows we believe, by having obse rved the phenomena many times, 
that that difference between language spoken at home and language used in coursework harms 
very much the results of students. Languages may make them more agile but ignorance and 
cultural barriers make them less agile and les s successful.  Crucially this is an hidden problem, 
sometimes we believe that the students are not even aware of it, and if may really harm their 
success, in Universities and in the labour market. We have not seen any change in the situation for 
10 years, in fact it only got worse because with globalization migration flows increased. And finally, 
the political powers don’t believe the problem exist – which gives science a great reason to step in.    
In consequence we intend to do a study in two parts – this year we address the conceptual part and 
next year we hope to present some empirical work based on qualitative or quantitative field work  
Theories  
 
The problem of bilingualism between school and home has already been addressed, namely from 
the parent’s point of view (Wesely, 2016) and relating to Quebec, in Canada. This is a very good 
example because it is based in a very affluent country which is not  dislocated. One of the additional 
problems we believe the students of our sample face is that they are usually dislocated from their 
families and second they may not be able to receive all the support that they could receive in 
Quebec, even if the UK, Spa in and Portugal rank among the developed countries. One interesting 
experience in this context is the “dual language immersion programs” in the United States, which 
obtain very high marks in what relates to the satisfaction of parents (Olivos and Lucero, 2 018). The 
same satisfaction with multilingual education has been found for countries such as Ireland 
(Kavanagh, 2014), Brazil (Oliveira and al, 2020), Spain (Freinauer, Whiting, 2014), and the US 
regarding English speaking students (Domer, 2014). These stu dies are very interesting because they 
underline the importance of bilingualism in students. However , they fall short of the purpose and 
intention of this paper.  
 
The problem with try to address in this paper is – what happens when multilingualism is not 
accounted for, and on the contrary, it is completely overshadowed by a legal discourse that in fact 
denies the existence of the problem itself. Moreover, in the cas es we want to address bilingualism is 
not even possible because the persons in question are essentially migrants and bilingual studies 
usually is given to locals.  
 
Methods

86 
Specifically in the paper we want to begin with a literature review and after we plan to do a 
questionnaire and or a survey with students that might be fill the requirements, to analyse in detail 
their situation.    
Research Questions  
 
What is known in the published literature about the situation of students that come from a country 
with a national language and to study in the mother language country, but in fact may feel 
dislocated, and in trouble because the language they speak at home  is different.   
 
Implications  
 
By our own experience we believe that the students we focus in are a silent and disadvantaged 
minority. This disadvantage harms their achievement and their life and career prospects.  The 
problem is accrued in a very big measure because legally there is an  equality in relation to the law, 
which in fact masks a very hard social problem. In the long run, not addressing this question may 
lead to social and political unrest.  
 
Conclusions  
Students that study in a country with a given mother language, and come from a country with the 
same mother language may be very disadvantaged if at home they speak another language. The 
following table describes some of these possibilities:  
 
Mother language  Receptor Country  Country of birth  Second language spoken at 
home  
 
English  UK or US  English Speaking  Africa  African dialects and language   
 
French  France  French Speaking  Africa  Arab, African Dialects and Languages

ID:164  - Building Connectedness and Community for Immigrants with HRD: An 
Integrative Review  
Myungjung Shim, Bethany Brausen, Hyerim Cho  & Stephanie Sisco  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The immigrant population in the United States has experienced a significant increase, rising from 
7.9 percent (9.6 million) in 1990 to 13 percent (40 million) in 2010, with an expected further growth 
to reach 19 percent by 2050 (Passel and D’Vera, 2008; Un ited States Census Bureau, 2010). With this 
ongoing expansion, it becomes increasingly essential to address the unique barriers and challenges 
immigrants face. During the transition to a new country, social connectedness emerges as a pivotal 
protective fac tor (Safdar, Lay, & Struthers, 2003; Yeh & Inose, 2003). Defined as a sense of belonging 
and connection with individuals and social groups, connectedness plays a crucial role in mitigating 
the negative impacts of stressful life events, contributing signifi cantly to the overall well -being of the 
immigrant population. It serves as a catalyst for a successful transition to a new host country 
(Safdar, Lay, & Struthers, 2003; Yeh & Inose, 2003).  
 
Connectedness has been discussed in academic literature by Lee and Robbins (1995) in general 
context as a feeling of belonging and the ability to connect with other individuals and social groups. 
Based on this general concept of connectedness, connectednes s can be found in the immigrant 
context to provide immigrants with a perceived belonging in the host community which results in 
positive outcomes such as positively effect on mitigating loneliness or isolation issues of immigrants 
(Brance et al., 2022; Pea taw et al., 2023; Safdar et al., 2009). However, within the immigrant context, 
there remains a lack of clarity regarding the specific type of connectedness experienced by 
immigrants and the mechanisms through which immigrants establish a sense of connected ness to 
the host community.  
 
Research Purpose & Importance  
 
Recognizing immigrants as integral members of our community underscores the necessity of 
considering their successful transition to the host country, with connectedness playing a key role in 
this process. Addressing the issue of connectedness within the im migrant community should be a 
focal point of national human resource development (NHRD). This involves expanding the scope of 
existing human resource development (HRD) initiatives beyond workplace settings to encompass 
community development (Budhwani & McL ean, 2012). NHRD at the community -societal level aims 
to enhance the quality of life for citizens by promoting networking and community development 
(Garavan et al., 2004). Recognizing the connection between the social integration of immigrants and 
their we ll-being in the host country, it becomes crucial to address this matter within the context of 
HRD to demonstrate how it has implications for organizations at the individual, community, and 
societal level.  
 
Research Question  
 
This paper delves into the current literature on connectedness in the immigrant community, aiming 
to broaden our understanding of identified connectedness types, antecedents, and their impact on 
outcomes.  Additionally, we seek to pinpoint necessary HRD su pports to facilitate social 
connectedness within the immigrant community. Therefore, our research questions are as follows:  
 
RQ1. What are the antecedents of social connectedness in the immigrant community?  
RQ2. What are the outcomes of social connectedness in the immigrant community?

88 
RQ3. What are the necessary HRD supports to enhance social connectedness in the immigrant 
community?  
 
Methods  
 
The objective of this study is to formulate a comprehensive framework that delves into the factors 
influencing connectedness among immigrant populations, along with the associated outcomes. To 
achieve this objective, we conducted an integrative literature review of pertinent literature related 
to connectedness in immigrant communities, as outlined by To rraco (2005). Using the Web of 
Science database and employing synonyms for 'connectedness' and 'immigrants,' our search 
initially yielded 157 articles. Through a refined selection process, wherein we excluded literature not 
focused on the immigrant context  or limited to the school context, we included a final set of 39 
articles in this review.  
 
Preliminary Results  
 
The current integrative literature review reveals three distinct types of connectedness: 1) 
connectedness to host country residents, 2) connectedness to country of origin communities, and 3) 
mutual connectedness. The first two types involve immigrants feel ing connected to specific groups 
without necessarily reciprocated feelings from host country residents. The literature also suggests 
that connectedness to country of origin communities may positively influence connectedness to 
host country residents.  
 
Moreover, antecedents influencing connectedness include individual factors (family status, 
language fluency, living conditions, health, length of stay, pre -knowledge of the host country), 
relationship -building activities within the immigrant community (par ticipation in community and 
religious activities), relationship -building activities between host country residents and immigrants 
(sharing food culture, sports events), support from the host country (language programs, local 
events involving both groups), and external environmental factors (employment rate, discrimination 
climate).  
 
Examining the relationship between antecedents and types of connectedness, individual factors 
lead to a sense of connectedness to host country residents or country of origin communities. 
Relationship -building activities within the immigrant community foste r connectedness to both host 
country residents and country of origin communities, while programs involving host country 
residents create mutual connectedness between the two groups. Support from the host country 
leads to connectedness to host country resid ents and mutual connectedness, whereas the external 
environment influences connectedness to host country residents.  
 
Additionally, the literature reveals two mechanisms of connectedness building based on reactions 
to a new culture: 1) acculturation and 2) enculturation. Highly acculturated individuals value 
connections to host country communities, while those favoring en culturation prioritize connections 
within their cultural group. This preference for enculturation may result in limited connectedness 
with host country residents and potential negative implications for immigrants.  
The outcomes of connectedness for immigrants fall into two main categories: 1) well -being and 2) 
community engagement. Connectedness to host country residents or country of origin communities 
positively influences immigrants' well -being. Support from the h ost country, such as diverse 
workforce training and frequent communication with immigrant communities by local 
governments, moderates this impact. All three types of connectedness contribute to community 
engagement, extending beyond ethnic or home country communities to involve participation in 
larger community activities and policy -making.

89 
Implications for HRD and Conclusion  
 
Finally, the paper explores the roles of HRD in enhancing connectedness within the immigrant 
community, drawing on the four phases of the onboarding process: production, synergism, 
integration, and strategic planning (Dunn & Jasinski, 2009). In the product ion phase, providing 
language programs is highlighted, while the synergism phase involves developing connections 
between immigrant and host country communities. Furthermore, the integration phase deals with 
helping immigrants become familiarized with the h ost country’s culture, including food, sports, and 
religion. In the last phase, strategic planning, we point to the importance of professional 
development to ensure continuity in immigrants’ development. By adopting the concept of 
onboarding, we illustrate d necessary HRD supports in facilitating antecedents of connectedness in 
immigrant communities. Implications for theory, research, and practice were suggested.

ID:171  - Critical Perspectives in HRD: Socioeconomic Status and Social Class  
Julie Gedro  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Importance  
 
Sambrook (2007) explains that critical HRD must have an “investigative perspective” (p. 33) that 
uncovers what others take for granted. Research that interrogates systems of power and privilege, 
and that problematizes assumptions that workplaces (and corre spondingly, Human Resource 
Development research and practice) exist to maximize efficiency and productivity (see Bierema & 
Callahan, 2014) has become increasingly visible in various outlets and publications in the field of 
HRD.  
 
Theoretical Base  
 
This conceptual literature review examines socioeconomic status (SES) and social class as 
dimensions of critical HRD. Gray and Kish -Gephart (2013) explain that socioeconomic status is 
represented by income or occupation while social class represents an internalized identity that has 
a foundation in one’s resources such as educational attainment, income, and occupational prestige. 
Social class, or sta tus, reflects someone’s rank when compared to others (Gray & Kish -Gephart).  
 
Research Purpose  
 
This is a conceptual literature review examining SES and social class research in management, 
leadership, career development, and proximal fields.  Because SES and social class are aspects of 
identity (see Manstead, 2018), there is fertile ground for a cri tical examination of the ways in which 
SES and class impact career development and leadership development.    
 
Research Questions  
 
Those from lower SES and social class backgrounds have comparatively limited aspects for 
leadership career trajectories (McNamee & Miller, 2009). Therefore, the primary research question 
posed by this working paper is: How can an understanding of the literature regarding the 
relat ionship between leadership and career development and socioeconomic status and social 
class, equip HRD practitioners with insights to develop HRD programs to disrupt the asymmetrical 
structures of career opportunities and possibilities?  
 
SES and social class represent comparatively under -examined aspects of diversity, equity and 
inclusion and yet they impact (by way of reinforcement) a workplace status quo that is characterized 
by inequity. It has been examined and established that those w ho have higher socioeconomic 
status have durable, sustainable advantages with respect to access to education and various forms 
of capital including cultural, educational, financial, social, and career capital (Ingram, 2021). SES and 
social class confer pri vileges to some while marginalizing others. In the field of HRD, critical 
interrogations of power, privilege, marginalization, and oppression have been called out by those 
who champion a social justice paradigm for HRD (Byrd, 2014).  
 
Martin et al (2017) posit that traits, psychological orientations, and their learned norms are 
influenced by SES and social class, and that growing up in a higher -class status “corresponds to 
having more resources at ones’ disposal” (p. 50). By reviewing t he literature in these selected fields,

91 
the project probes the marginalization and oppression that can hamper career development and 
leadership development for those from lower -middle and lower class backgrounds.  
 
Implications for HRD Practice  
 
By critically examining these aspects of identity and offering some insights about their influences on 
individuals, workplaces, and societies, the aim is to equip HRD scholars and practitioners of HRD 
with awareness and knowledge to inspire and inform work  that disrupts inequities.

ID:187  - The impact of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) policies on ethnic 
minorities' advancement into senior leadership roles in UK universities  
Camille Heslop -Martin, Jessey Pswarayi  & Fotios Mitsakis  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
 
In recent years, the higher education sector in the United Kingdom has witnessed a growing 
emphasis on Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) policies to address historical imbalances and to 
foster a more representative leadership landscape (Arday, 2018;  Rollock, 2016; UCU, 2016). Ethnic 
minorities within Higher Education (HE) constantly experience inequality within the sector despite 
the introduction of policies to address inequalities (Bhopal, 2021). There is a research gap with 
peoples lived experience  and the extent to which it impacts their progression to Senior Leadership 
position in UK HE from the lens of critical race theory. The research aims to explore the impact of 
national and institutional EDI policy's hindrance or improvement to ethnic minori ties' advancement 
into senior leadership roles in UK universities. The research will provide a theoretical contribution 
towards developing research in ‘ethnic’ equality and outline implications policymakers and 
practitioners can use to tackle the lack of d iversity in senior leadership roles.  
 
Theoretical Base  
 
The objective of introducing policies is to directly deal with inequalities (Bhopal and Pitkin, 2020). 
However, equality policies have been embraced by organisations only because they are bound by 
such policy requirements (Ahmed, 2007; Jones, 2006). An obl igation to equality policies sees a 
failure of organisations to demonstrate an understanding of how to use equality policies to 
appropriately address inequalities. This calls for a greater need for universities to demonstrate an 
understanding of equality p olicies and how legal equality measures are being met by the 2010 
Equality Act (Bhopal, 2019).  
 
Research has shown that Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a useful framework to assist with 
understanding and addressing issues of inequalities in Higher Education (Ladson -Billings & Tate, 
1995; Decuir & Dixson, 2004). The framework will be drawn on to illumin ate the multifaceted nature 
of the challenges faced by ethnic minorities. A qualitative research design will be employed to 
include interviews and document analysis, the research aims to capture the lived experiences of 
ethnic minorities and provide rich, context -specific data for analysis (Jenkins, 2014).  
 
Research Purpose  
 
The primary purpose of this research is to critically examine the effectiveness of existing EDI policies 
in promoting the career advancement of ethnic minorities to senior leadership roles in UK 
universities. The study seeks to unravel the underlying mecha nisms that either facilitate or hinder 
progress and identify areas for improvement in EDI initiatives.  
 
Research Questions  
 
1) To what extent do current EDI policies influence the career progression of ethnic minorities in UK 
universities?  
2) What are the key barriers that ethnic minorities encounter in their pursuit of senior leadership 
roles?

94 
3) How can EDI policies be enhanced to better support the advancement of ethnic minorities into 
senior leadership positions?  
 
Implications for HRD practice  
 
The findings from this research can inform the design and implementation of more effective EDI 
policies in UK universities, fostering inclusive leadership practices. HRD professionals can leverage 
the insights to tailor training programs that address the s pecific barriers identified, promoting a 
supportive environment for the career development of ethnic minorities. Moreover, the study 
contributes to a broader conversation on the role of HRD in advancing diversity and inclusion in 
educational institutions.  
 
Conclusions  
 
In conclusion, this research addresses a critical gap in the literature by examining the impact of EDI 
policies on the career advancement of ethnic minorities in senior leadership roles in UK universities. 
The findings are expected to inform both academic and  practitioner communities, offering 
actionable insights for enhancing EDI initiatives and fostering a more inclusive and representative 
leadership landscape in higher education. Ultimately, the research seeks to contribute to the 
ongoing discourse on equit y within academic institutions, creating a foundation for future studies 
and policy interventions.

ID:192  - Diversity, Inclusion and Firm Performance: A Systematic Review of 
Human Resource Management and Finance Journals  
Corina Sheerin  & Maura Sheehan  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Objective  
 
To review and synthesise the extant literature within the domain of Human Resource Management 
(HRM) and Finance for the period 2000 -2023 to examine how the relationship between diversity, 
inclusion and firm performance has been presented.  
 
Study Overview  
 
The core objective of this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is to critically evaluate, as opposed to 
simply summarise how the diversity, inclusion and firm performance relationship is represented 
over a 23 -year timespan. This approach allows for a framew ork to be developed which provides a 
broad perspective of the key themes arising in the literature. The domains of HRM and Finance have 
been purposefully selected. Both spaces represent different understandings of firm performance. 
Within HRM literature, f irm performance is generally a subjective measure of success which 
comprises a range of dimensions, including subjective measures of financial successes and 
efficiency (Mayrhofer et al. 2008).  In contrast, within Finance, firm performance is usually an 
objective measure denoted by a financial (eg share prices) and/or profit metric. Sels et al. (2006, 
p.319) propose that the relationship between HRM and firm performance is a subjective one which 
is often “fuzzy” and contingent upon context and measurement a pproaches. Dundon and Rafferty 
(2018) argue that HRM considers a broad range of stakeholder interests as well as developmental 
objectives and long -term goals when defining organisational success, and therefore provide a 
holistic and inclusive measure of fi rm performance.  The Dundon and Rafferty (2018)  approach  is 
often perceived as being at odds with ‘value -creation’ and ‘firm performance’ goals from the 
perspective of both scholars and practitioners within finance.  Indeed, tensions have existed 
between  HRM professionals and financial personnel for decades. In ‘hyper -masculine environments 
such as investment banking this is particularly problematic with HRM perceived as “not meeting the 
challenges presented by the sector’s environment” (Aldrich & Dietz;.  p8 (XXX); Aldrich & Daniel 
(2019).  
 
When we look to the issue of diversity and inclusion, HRM professionals are often organisational 
‘gatekeepers’ who implement initiatives which promote difference and inclusion amongst 
employees, presenting them as essential for organisational success. From  a finance perspective, the  
Global Financial Crisis (GFC (2028)) revealed the danger of ‘groupthink’ in relation to risk and 
performance, and as such, diversity and inclusion initiatives have seen increased levels of attention. 
However, for many financial professionals such programmes are perceived as "nice to have” rather 
than essential to firm performance.  
 
This research will examine how diversity and inclusion is presented in the two bodies of literature – 
does a difference exist between the HRM and Finance academic communities? The key aim this 
research is to examine whether diversity and inclusion are trea ted as just “another variable” or does 
the literature contain a more critical orientation of the relationship between firm performance, 
diversity and inclusion problematized in a more holistic way.

96 
The research questions which will guide the research are:  
RQ1. What theories have influenced the investigation of diversity, inclusion and firm performance in 
the HRM and Finance literatures?  
 
RQ2. How has diversity, inclusion and firm performance been investigated methodologically 
(quantitative/qualitative/mixed; subjective or objective measures of diversity, inclusion and 
performance; cross sectional or longitudinal) and empirically (primary a nd secondary data) within 
the HRM and Finance literatures?  
 
RQ3.  What has the analysis found on the relationship between diversity, inclusion and measures 
of performance and do these findings vary between the HRM and finance literatures? Of particular 
importance will be do document whether the study is cross -sectional or longitudinal (the latter has 
the potential to establish whether there is causal inference).  
 
RQ4.  Are there thematic clusters apparent within the HRM and Finance literatures in relation to 
diversity, inclusion, and firm performance?  
 
(i)  Has there been temporal changes in the thematic clusters emergent from the 
literature over the 23 -year timeframe?  
(ii) Did the GFC impact the narrative and themes within the literature concerning diversity and 
inclusion?  
(iii) Are there publication trends apparent in terms of context of study (private versus public 
sector), journals, authors, affiliated countries (developed vs developing nations)?  
(iv)  Were narratives about diversity and inclusion reflective of EU and UK legislative changes and 
initiatives, for example the Gadhia (‘Women in Finance’ (2016)) report?  
 
Design/methodology/approach  
 
This paper will adopt a four -step systematic literature review (SLR) approach. At the outset we 
consulted the Scopus Web of Science (WOS) database and selected 1st quartile only journals in both 
HRM and Finance. This generated XXX articles in HRM and XXX a rticles Finance.  
 
Within the XXX journals, a string of appropriate search terms will be used to search the papers in 
title, abstract and keywords. The search terms will be initially piloted and refined to ensure they are 
relevant [needs to be done]. The final search terms a pplied < “diversity” OR “inclusion” AND “firm 
performance” [needs to be confirmed]. The inclusion criteria required that the literature source 
selected be: English language only, be final and/or articles in print and the source type was peer -
review journal  articles published online. We purposely excluded commentaries, conference papers 
and editorials to ensure a far basis for comparison. Thereafter the articles will be screened based 
on (i) a review of abstracts or full papers to ensure they were focused up on gender and firm 
performance issues and (ii) CABS ranking (2*, 3*, 4*) [from selected Scopus search]. The data will be 
analysed using the constant comparative method of analysis, a data -led approach. With this 
approach, the focus will be upon a thematic analysis of the articles. To undertake this method, each 
article will be summarised with those who explored similar issues grouped into initial categories. 
Thereafter, several phases of coding will be undertaken by the researchers with initial categories 
merged and synthesised into broader themes. The coding process will be an iterative with the aim 
of concluding with a “theoretical saturation”. In total XX themes were identified.  
 
Outline of ‘Findings’  
 
The four step SLR approach led to XXX articles being analysed. These included: X quantitative, Y 
qualitative and Z mixed methods studies. The studies spanned X countries with a high

97 
concentration of researchers in XX and the greatest number of articles printed in ABC journals. 
Most of the research was carried out between Year X and Year Y.  Research concerning financial 
performance in the main considered issues of diversity and inclus ion from the perspective of 
gender and/or age with both presented as ‘just another variable’ as opposed to a distinct aspect of 
analysis. Where gender/age were considered more deeply, issues such as women on boards, board 
diversity, female career advanceme nt were explored.  
 
Outline of ‘Impact /Contribution’  
 
The majority of SLR’s are situated in one domain and an in -depth synthesis of the literature is 
undertaken. This research departs from that by undertaking an SLR within two contrasting domains. 
Such an approach allowed us to obtain a comprehensive and coll ective insight into the themes and 
publication patterns of both HRM and Finance led journals. Integrating these two disparate domains 
provides a multidisciplinary holistic framework from where we can identity both the dominant and 
the different narratives and discourses concerning diversity and inclusion in the context of firm 
performance.  
  
Limitations  
 
The research is limited to that published between 2000 and 2023. Only two databases were used 
and as such there is a possible relevant article may not be included in the analysis.  
We only considered those journal articles published in the English language. While we are confident 
that we have provided a broad pattern of understanding rather than a precise picture our analysis 
does not consider the discourse in non -English language jo urnals.

ID:223  - Exploring organizational practices for gender equity: A Narrative 
Inquiry Approach  
Marica Liotino  & Monica Fedeli  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The paper delves into the burgeoning field of diversity management (DM) and its implications for 
gender equity, emphasizing a unique Italian context. While DM is recognized as a vital strategic 
choice for organizations globally (Olsen & Martins, 2012), its  development in Italy needs to be more 
studied, with limited adoption and a predominant focus on female workforce issues (Colella & Di 
Lorenzo, 2023). The research builds on prior studies highlighting the need for a contextual 
understanding of DM approache s, challenging assumptions about their universal applicability 
(Ravazzani, 2016).  
 
Examining the gender landscape in Italy, the data unveils a stark contrast between educational 
attainment and professional representation for women in line with the European situation. Despite 
higher educational achievements, women face lower employment ra tes, widening further with the 
number of children (Istat, 2022). Gender pay gaps persist, particularly in managerial roles, 
emphasizing the need for nuanced approaches to address systemic issues (Manello et al., 2023). 
Importantly, a critical mass of women  in top management positively influences firm credit risk and 
internationalization (Bannò et al., 2019; Manello et al., 2023).  
 
The theoretical framework guiding the research combines critical feminism and social 
constructionism. Critical feminism brings attention to dismantling patriarchal organizational 
structures, emphasizing reflection on privilege, structural reform for emancipation, increased 
gender consciousness, and the reconstruction of solidarity (Bierema et al., 2022). Social 
constructionism, rooted in claims -making and  narrative analysis, underscores the contextual and 
interactive nature of social problems (Spector & Kitsuse, 1977; Tamboukou, 2008).  
Methodologically, the study employs Narrative Inquiry, focusing on personal narratives to 
understand gender equity perceptions in Vicenza organizations. After a preliminary survey 
administration to organizational employees, narrative inquiry through 15 int erviews with human 
resource managers and/or trade union representatives will explore organizational policies and 
practices promoting gender equity. This effort aims to recognize organizational models used by 
manufacturing, cooperative, service, trade, tour ism, tertiary, and craft enterprises in Vicenza 
(Veneto Region).  
 
Furthermore, the research aims to disseminate findings effectively. The digital storytelling approach 
will showcase exemplary organizational practices, fostering awareness and professional 
development. Digital storytelling, recognized for its educational e fficacy and inclusivity, has the 
potential to challenge stereotypes and empower women within organizational contexts. 
Additionally, interventions such as critical feminist coaching, informed by research outcomes, will 
target organizational mindsets, promot ing gender equity and retaining female talent.  
In conclusion, the research not only contributes to the understanding of gender equity in Vicenza 
organizations but also provides actionable insights and tools for fostering positive change. By 
emphasizing context -specific approaches, the study addresses t he unique challenges faced by 
women in the workplace, paving the way for organizational transformations aligned with principles 
of diversity management and gender equity.

ID:232  - “Double Empathy and Relational Leadership in Neurodiverse 
Workplaces”  
Katherine Kinnaird  & Yoshie Nakamura  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The purpose of the proposed qualitative study is to investigate the ways in which managers without 
autism spectrum disorder (hereafter “autism”) and their staff with autism in the United States 
experience empathy in their relationships, such that tradition al definitions of “leader” and “follower” 
blur in favor of relational leadership and two -way forms of understanding. In doing so, it addresses 
a gap in neurodiversity research by looking at autism, a specific neurological condition, in the 
context of relat ional leadership and offers guidance for developing two -way relationships in support 
of individual and organizational wellness.  
 
The first research question looks at the empathy managers without autism and their staff with 
autism display in their work relationships and the second question looks at the dynamics of the 
relationships themselves.  
1. How do managers without autism and their employees with autism in the United States 
exhibit empathy towards each other in their work relationships?  
2. How do managers without autism and their employees with autism in the United States 
understand the relationship between their roles in the workplace?  
 
While discussion around neurodiversity in the workplace has increased in recent years (Silver et al., 
2023), the proposed project deeply connects to topics of diversity, equity, and inclusion in Human 
Resource Development (HRD) by addressing an ongoing nee d for research about neurodiversity in 
the context of relational leadership. This research challenges top -down relationships between non -
autistic managers and their staff with autism in favor of two -directional relationships. Leaders and 
followers will beg in “losing their traditional identity that is rooted in the formal organizational 
structure (manager -subordinate) and become inseparable parts of a co -constructing process of 
leadership” (Psychogios & Dimitriadis, 2021, p.2).  
 
The project’s emphasis on neurodiversity in the context of relational leadership reflects “the double 
empathy problem” in practical workplace contexts, in which different social experiences and 
expectations complicate the ability for people without autism to understand those with autism and 
vice versa (Milton, 2012). The proposed research’s emphasis on double empathy links it to topics of 
inclusion and equity as it explores pathways of neurodiverse communication in the workplace.  
The research focuses on this “double empathy” as a vehicle through which leaders and their 
employees with autism exhibit “relational leadership,” in contrast to the one -way relationships that 
have prevented non -autistic leaders and autistic followers from understanding each other. It 
recognizes that people with autism have strengths and weaknesses that overlap and diverge from 
strengths and weaknesses of those without autism. The extent to which an “individual impairment 
is actually experienced as disabling  and disadvantaging is co -constituted by contextual and 
situational factors” (Dobusch, 2019, p. 383). There is also an element of inclusivity built into the 
study’s definition of relational leadership, as it relates to two -way empathy for each other’s 
expe riences and needs. This aspect of inclusivity in leadership is “fundamental to relational 
leadership, as it focuses on interpersonal relationships and drives followers' perceptions that 
leaders are fair, accountable, and attentive to their needs” (Northous e, 2022, p. 325).

100 
As noted, this research is part of ongoing dissertation work on double empathy and relational 
leadership. The paper submitted for the 2024 University Forum for Human Resource Development 
Conference will be a literature review to support the advancement of research in this field.

ID:234  - Social Justice Responsibility: A Concept, a Review, and a Research 
Agenda  
Ciarán McFadden  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
In this paper, I argue that organisations are increasingly expected to engage in policies and 
practices centred on advancing social justice, both within the organisation and within broader 
society, and that this may (and indeed may have) become a standard through which consumers and 
potential employees judge them. A new term, which brings together aspects of EDI and CSR, namely 
Social Justice Responsibility (SJR), is introduced and conceptualised. The antecedents and 
implications of SJR are discussed, parti cularly emphasizing the role of the HRD function and 
scholarly field. I argue that this concept and practice should be seen as separate from existing 
corporate social responsibility and diversity management practices.  
Scholars and activists argue that organisations often fail in a key aspect of their equality, diversity 
and inclusion (EDI) practice, because they focus more on the commercial advantages of diversity 
whilst failing to adequately address barriers faced by m arginalised groups within their workplace. 
EDI as a practice also often tends to look inward, involving organisational policies and practices that 
solely affect employees and potential employees. Externally, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
and latter ly Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals have become more widespread, but 
are often characterized as highly individualised (Fordham & Robinson, 2018), too broad, a branding 
effort, and/or a way to increase share performance, rather than a genuin e tool for social change.   
EDI and CSR/ESG are therefore well established, but focus on separate areas; EDI looking inward 
and on the organisation’s micro -environment, CSR/ESG looking outward, often at issues far 
removed from the lives of employees. But how do social justice movemen ts fit into this dichotomy? 
After the murder of George Floyd in 2020, many companies promised to take action to end racial 
injustice in the workplace and beyond; after #MeToo went viral in 2017, companies pledged to clean 
house and eliminate sexual harassm ent in their ranks. However, a CSR/ERG agenda that is overly 
broad, fuzzy and at the whim of executives, and an EDI approach that focuses solely on internal 
policies and practices, cannot adequately address rapidly evolving complex social justice 
movements  which straddle both sides of the organisational boundary.   
 
In the past it may have been easier for companies to wait until the dust of these social movements 
settled, and quietly disregard their promises and resume business as usual. However, Generation Z 
now makes up 15 -20% of the population in the USA, and have distinct priorities, experiences and 
skills that differentiate them from other generations (e.g., Millennials, Boomers). Fighting for social 
justice is one of the defining features of this group (Seemiller & Grace, 2017; Meehan, 2016), and 
organisations ar e being increasingly expected to take stances on social justice issues, even if it risks 
alienating other groups of consumers (Fromm, 2021). As more and more of Generation Z enter the 
workforce, however, employer branding is also an issue that companies mu st take seriously. The 
‘war for talent’ (Axelrod, Michaels, & Handfield -Jones, 2001) still rages, and has been exacerbated by 
the so -called Great Resignation. Engaging in effective practices aimed at address social injustice, 
therefore, may be a key way to  attract and retain this group of employees.  
 
Social Justice Responsibility is characterised here as the third, necessary complement to EDI and 
CSR/ESG. In comparison with the other two components, SJR practices seek to:  
 
- Acknowledge and bring attention to historical and contemporary social injustices, at the 
interpersonal, organisation, industry, and societal levels,

102 
- Amplify the voices, objectives, and work of marginalized groups and individuals working in 
social justice movements;  
- Contribute to or (where appropriate) lead work that seeks to eliminate social injustice,  
- Work within the organisation and between organisations to create coalitions of experts in 
different areas and fields,  
- Provide organizational resources, such as financial, network, technological and 
infrastructural resources, to those within social justice movements.  
  
Literature & the Role of HRD  
 
This paper will take the form of a review of the literature on similar concepts, the conceptualisation 
of SJR, and a research agenda for development of the concept. Many scholars have already 
advocated for a greater commitment to social responsibility with in organisations. Byrd and Hughes 
(2015) argue that the practice of diversity management primarily serves the organisation and its 
goals, rather than those of the marginalised workforce in the organisation, and advocate for a 
“paradigm shift for diversity management that responds to the social injustices experienced by 
marginalized employees” (p. 1233). Similarly, Syed and Kramer (2009) argue for “socially responsible 
diversity management” that places the social justice case for EDI work at the forefront of  initiatives, 
while Bierema and D’Abundo (2004) discuss organizational social consciousness, through which 
HRD practitioners can help promote socially responsible practices within the workplace. Collins, 
Zhang and Sisco (2021) highlight that there have bee n recent calls to move social justice work from 
the margins of the organisation towards its center. To complement those calls, one may also call for 
organisations to work together to advance social justice.   
 
The HRD practitioner, as custodian of knowledge in organisations, has a vital role to play in SJR. In 
the same sense that Garavan and McGuire (2010, p. 489) argue that HRD can “raise the awareness 
of employees and develop positive attitudes toward sustaina bility . . . [and] can contribute to the 
development of a culture that supports sustainability, CSR, and ethics”, HRD can promote the 
importance of SJR in the organisation – through, for example, providing information about social 
justice issues, develop e mployees’ understanding of the importance of SJR and each individual’s part 
to play within it, and to seek out best practice in other organisations. They can also help set up 
strategic links with social justice groups and other organisations to facilitate learning and 
development in areas where employees lack knowledge. As knowledge managers, HRD 
practitioners may also have an important and careful task in managing knowledge exchange 
between organisations. Should organisations work together in partnership, there may be 
opportunities for the sharing of knowledge and a synergetic, collaborative improvement in 
developing SJR policies and practices.

ID:240  - Navigating Misophonic Triggers at Work through Learning  
Mosaab Sabah  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Misophonia is a condition, first identified in 1997 by audiologist Marsha Johnson, and later named 
by Jasterboff and Jasterboff in 2002, in which individuals experience immediate, intense, and 
negative responses to auditory stimuli (Dozier & Mitchell, 2023 ). Stimuli often trigger responses 
such as irritation, anger, disgust, anxiety and escape (Brout et al., 2018; Swedo et al., 2022). These 
triggers can have a severely negative impact on social, occupational, and academic functioning 
(Dozier & Mitchell, 202 3).  
 
Dozier & Mitchell (2023) state that misophonia is a poorly known condition due to its recent 
discovery. They also posit that there is a lack of consensus on the etiology of misophonia. This 
position is held by other researchers, such as Guetta et al. (2022 ), Edelstein et al. (2013), and 
Cecilione et al. (2022), who state that misophonia is an unexplored, underresearched, and relatively 
new field of study. Since researchers suggest that the perception and response to triggers is 
influenced by the context in which the triggers occur, and over time, they can impair functioning of 
adults in professional, academic and social settings, it is important to understand these triggers in 
the workplace and their impact on employees with misophonia. Thus, the purpose of this 
conceptual working paper informed by a review of the literature and adult learning theories 
(Merriam & Bierema, 2014) is to present a framework that will guide the study of understanding the 
experiences of professionals with misophonia in order to rev eal strategies used by these 
professionals to respond to misophonic triggers in the workplace. Implications for HRD practice and 
research will be presented at the conference.

ID:148  - Introducing Transfer of “Critical” Learning in Human Resource 
Development and Management Education  
Eunbi Sim  & Laura Bierema  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Importance  
 
Critical scholars in human resource development (HRD) and management fields strive to promote 
organizational social justice by facilitating adult professionals’ critical learning through education 
(e.g., Alfred et al., 2020; Alfred and Chlup, 2010; Armitage, 2010; Bierema, 2010; Boh onos et al., 
2019; Collins, 2013, 2017; Fenwick, 2005; Gold and Bratton, 2014; Gray, 2004; Hibbert, 2013; et al., 
2012; Lo, 2023; Rabelo et al., 2023; Sim and Bierema, 2023). Facilitating critical learning may be 
grounded in beliefs that adult professional s might transfer critical learning to workplaces through 
critical action in the organization. Nevertheless, whether critical HRD and management are 
practiced outside academia is questioned (Kwon & Archer, 2023).  
 
Transferring attitudes, skills, and knowledge learned through education and training to the 
workplace has long been explored with the concept of “transfer of learning” (ToL), often 
interchangeably used with “transfer of training.” However, most ToL studies  lack a critical 
perspective. This omission might be irrelevant with traditional HRD and management research and 
education that (re)produce performance, profit, and production -oriented values, practices, and 
systems. In contrast to traditional learning, cr itical learning embraces criticality —the state of being 
critical —in learning and challenges injustice, inequity, domination, and oppression (Bierema et al., 
2024; Trehan and Rigg, 2015). Critical learning requires creating shared knowledge and 
understandin g related to social and political contexts based on critical and mutual dialogue in a 
learning community (Armitage, 2010; Valentin, 2007). Thus, the factors impacting the transfer of 
non-critical learning may differ from those of critical learning.  
 
Another gap in ToL research is associated with the learning/training context. Extant research on ToL 
might be challenging to understand learning transferred in different organizations (i.e., university 
classrooms - work practices), given that most studies on ToL investigated learning transferred in the 
same organization (i.e., training programs offered by the workplace —work practices). Further, most 
ToL studies focus on face -to-face learning, even though virtual learning has grown. A new approach 
to examini ng adults' "critical" learning in HRD and management classrooms in a digital age could be 
transferred into the workplace is needed.  
 
Research Purpose  
This paper aims to introduce transfer of critical learning (ToCL) as a learning purpose of critical HRD 
and management education.  
 
Research Questions  
• How might ToCL be defined and assessed?  
• Which factors might influence ToCL?  
• How might ToCL be studied and practiced in a digital age?  
 
Theoretical Basis  
ToL and critical HRD and management education compose the study’s theoretical background.  
 
4.1. Transfer of Learning (ToL)

108 
ToL studies are reviewed, including the history and research trends and factors impacting ToL.  
 
4.1.1. History and research trends of ToL  
Learning is considered transferred when adult learners apply information, strategies, and skills they 
have learned (e.g., in the classroom) to a new situation or context (e.g., in the organization). Early 
ToL tested and maximized training effectiveness. Th orndike and Woodworth (1901) initially 
suggested the notion of ToL, although originally described it as transfer of practice. They posited 
ToL depends on similarity between the function trained (e.g., learning contexts and tasks) and 
functions tested (e.g. , practice/transfer contexts where learners should apply what they have 
learned).  
 
Recent ToL studies employed diverse research methods, including longitudinal study and network 
analysis (e.g., Deckers et al., 2022; Van den Bossche et al., 2010; Van den Bossche and Segers, 2013; 
Wagstaff et al., 2022). Also, ToL research in e -learning se ttings has grown (e.g., Blume et al., 2023; 
Fauth et al., 2023; Park and Wentling, 2007; Testers et al., 2020).  
 
4.1.2. Factors impacting ToL  
ToL has been explored in adult education, work, and organization studies to enhance training 
effectiveness and bridge the gap between learning and transfer (Davis et al., 2013; Illeris, 2009; 
Philpott, 2007). Mainly using quantitative research methods, res earch has identified factors 
improving ToL (e.g., Blume et al., 2010, 2023; Cheng and Ho, 2001; Huang et al., 2015; Gegenfurtner 
et al., 2016; Grossman and Salas, 2011; Sudebi, 2004). Research includes individual (e.g., motivation 
and attitudes, personalit ies, abilities and skills, perceptions), relational (e.g., supervisory behaviors, 
peer supports, social and family supports, team characteristics), workplace environment (e.g., 
organizational climate and culture, post -training transfer environments), and l earning/training 
environments (e.g., pre -training settings, training design, training delivery methods, and training 
content characteristics)  
 
To find the factor associated with transfer of learning, studies have used some scales, including 
learning transfer system inventory (LTSI) measuring factors in the system affecting transfer of 
learning developed by Holton and colleagues (e.g., Bates et al ., 2012; Holton et al., 2000, 2003), 
transfer interest questionnaire measuring trainee interest introduced by Gegenfurtner et al. (2020), 
and the unified model of task ‐specific motivation questionnaire (De Brabander and Glastra, 2018, 
2021; De Jong et al., 2023).  
 
4.2. Critical HRD and Management Education  
Critical HRD and management education teaches adult professionals about HRD and management 
from a critical perspective and discusses diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice issues at work 
(e.g., Armitage, 2010; Byrd and Scott, 2018; Collins, 2013,  2017; Gold and Bratton, 2014; Lawless et 
al., 2012; Lo, 2023; Rabelo et al., 2023; Sim and Bierema, 2023; Thomas et al., 2010). Critical HRD and 
management educators mindfully use critical pedagogy, including feminist, anti -racist, and 
intersectional peda gogy), to raise adult learners’ critical, intersectional consciousness and facilitate 
learners to change the oppressive organizations, not the oppressed employees (Sim & Bierema, 
2023).  
 
Implications for HRD  
As a conceptual paper exploring ToL from a critical perspective, this study would contribute to 
critical HRD and management education practices and studies. Advocating adult professionals’ 
ToCL, this study is also expected to contribute to promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and social 
justice at work.  
 
Conclusions

109 
 
Based on the theoretical basis, this study expects to answer the research questions. That is, we will 
(a) frame ToCL, (b) describe issues in relation to the assessment of ToCL, (c) examine factors that 
could impact ToCL, (d) explore research methods to stu dy ToCL, and (e) discuss ToCL in the societal, 
digital contexts.

ID:79  - Critical Success Factors in project management in the Portuguese 
public sector for the creation of value for the citizen  
Tânia Patrício  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The importance of Project Management and Benefits Realization Management (BRM) for the 
successful implementation of projects has been widely studied in the past years. It has been proven 
in the literature that BRM can leverage project implementation to achieve  the benefits defined by 
the organizations across various sectors of activity. In the same way, it has also been observed 
which Critical Success Factors (CSF) can enable a successful project implementation in the public 
sector.  
 
It is important to highlight that project management plays a crucial role in achieving the 
organization's strategy, and consequently moving from a position “as is” to “to be”, while creating 
value for the organization and its stakeholders. The public secto r plays an even more important role 
since the ultimate goal of projects in this sector is the creation of Public Value, e.g., value for society 
and the improvement of the citizens lives.  
 
Nevertheless, the literature shows us that for most organizations it is still a challenge to harvest the 
benefits from the projects implemented, compromising the creation of value for its stakeholders, 
even more so in the public sector due to its complexit y.  
Although the topics above have been thoroughly investigated, it’s still not clear how can we exploit 
the BRM practices (and which are the main CSFs) in the public sector project management for the 
creation of value for the citizens.  
 
Therefore, we consider pertinent to inquire about which practices can leverage the implementation 
of projects in the public sector to add value for the citizens under the project management and BRM 
scope.  
 
Our aim for the doctoral program is to deepen the CSFs in the implementation of the Project 
Management and BRM practices in this sector to have a citizen -centric approach and, consequently, 
not only achieve the benefits intended at the beginning of the project but also create value. Thus, 
our research aims to answer the following question: which are the critical success factors in project 
management  in the Portuguese public sector for the creation of citizen value?  
This paper constitutes our first step going forward in order to find some leads in our investigation. 
We summarize the literature main findings that we believe can inform and allow us to narrow our 
research. Additionally, it presents some of the main gaps we found in this field of study. Once we 
conclude our investigation, we aspire to add value in the field of Benefits Realization Management 
and Project management practices in the public sector, as well as contribute with recommendations 
for practitioners.

ID:136  -Enhancing Inclusive Leadership through Generative AI: A Discourse 
Analysis Approach  
Rita Tóth, Anna Laura Hidegh  & Eline Jammaers  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
In the evolving landscape of leadership development, there are contradicting views on      how the 
integration of generative AI would enhance leadership qualities and decision -making processes. On 
one hand, there is research emphasizing AI as a supportive tool that enhances leadership 
capabilities, focusing on the necessity for leaders to adapt and develop skills such as agility, 
continuous learning, and ethical understanding in the AI era. It views AI more as a co -pilot in 
decision -making, highlighting the  importance of human elements in leadership (Watson et al., 
2021). Contrastingly, on the other hand, Quaquebeke and Gerpott (2023) discuss a more 
transformative role of AI in leadership. They outline a future where AI could potentially substitute 
human lea dership functions, raising ethical questions and the potential for AI to cater to employees' 
needs better than human leaders. Thus, it is worth exploring how such AI systems can be designed 
and utilized to not only support but also enhance inclusivity in l eadership roles.  
 
Given the complex interplay of intersectional social identities and the related social norms, values, 
and beliefs (re)produced by discursive practices, the key challenge is to ensure that generative AI 
aids in acknowledging and addressing these organizatio nal phenomena. Applied as a co -pilot, AI has 
great potential to transform organizational strategy and influence leader behaviour and also to 
impact skills and competencies contemporary leaders need for effective leadership (Watson et al., 
2021). This resea rch problem centers on investigating how generative AI can be tailored and 
employed to support inclusive leadership development, ensuring it recognizes and mitigates biases, 
respects diversity, and promotes equity (see Birhane 2022), thereby contributing t o the creation of 
more inclusive organizational cultures.  
 
Our proposed research question is: How can generative AI, as a developmental tool for leaders, 
address inclusivity issues inherent in its design and application? Employing discourse analysis, our 
study scrutinizes the dialogues and interactions between pro grammers, leaders, and AI systems, 
aiming to identify and address biases and inclusivity gaps in the AI's programming and 
recommendations, align with the findings of Newstead, Eager and Wilson (2023), who highlight the 
importance of examining AI -generated content for biases, and the need for leaders and AI 
programmers to be aware of and address these biases.  
 
Our focus is on understanding the intricate interplay between the ethical framework guiding 
generative AI development, the personal beliefs of the programmers creating these AI systems, and 
the inclusivity perspectives of the leaders who utilize this AI co -pilot. The study's future findings aim 
to offer insights into the transformative potential of AI in shaping inclusive leadership dynamics.

ID:203  - The Digital Dimension as a Fundamental Variable for the 
Development of Human Capital in Public Administration: A Utilitarian 
Approach  
João Rodrigues dos Santos, Andreia de Bem Machado, Maria José Sousa, José 
Dias Lopes  & Rui Brito Fonseca  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The maximization of utility, from the economic perspective of utilitarianism, derived from public 
resources, can be substantially enhanced by the systematic integration of knowledge into the 
Human Capital of the Public Administration, thus influencing deci sion -making and operational 
processes within the government.  
 
This article seeks to theoretically highlight this relationship, focusing on the relevance of the Digital 
Age and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as essential catalysts for making a 
concrete impact, translated into increased efficiency, on the quality of the services provided by the 
Public  Administration's Human Resources to citizens.  
 
The concept of Human Capital, understood as the set of skills, knowledge and competencies of 
individuals, emerges as a protagonist in this context. The continuous insertion of knowledge and 
skills into the public sector's Human Capital not only improves in dividual effectiveness, but is also 
reflected in the overall capacity of the government apparatus to meet social demands.  
The convergence of the Digital Age and ICT enables public administration to integrate advanced 
knowledge management systems, data analysis and process automation, resulting in an operational 
synergy that strengthens Human Capital. The ability to process an d analyze large volumes of data 
provides valuable insights for informed decision -making, while the automation of routine tasks 
frees up professionals to focus on more strategic and complex activities.  
 
Within this technical perspective, the Digital Age and ICT are presented as facilitators for the 
optimization of Human Capital, allowing for the customization of training and development 
programs, aligned with the specific demands of public administration.  This strategic approach not 
only meets the individual needs of civil servants, but also contributes to more efficient and 
adaptable management.  
 
In the context of this article, the distinction between public and private assets is central to the 
analysis of resource management. Public goods, characterized by non -rivalry and non -exclusion, 
require a specific approach to resource allocation. The use o f technology in human resource 
management enables a better understanding of collective needs, allowing for the efficient allocation 
of resources to meet society's demands.  
 
The Laffer curve, in turn, highlights the relationship between the tax burden and tax revenue. 
Technology plays a crucial role in optimizing tax collection and identifying ideal tax points, avoiding 
the overload that can lead to a drop in revenue. This promotes more efficient tax management, 
ensuring that the resources collec ted are used strategically to benefit society.  
The utilitarian perspective in public management seeks to maximize utility for as many citizens as 
possible. By providing accurate data and metrics, technology allows public managers to identify 
priority areas and allocate resources in a way that maximizes  social welfare. In this way, informed 
decision -making driven by technology contributes to the realization of utilitarian principles in public 
administration.

114 
The principle of diminishing marginal utility, in turn, emphasizes that the value of a resource 
decreases as more units of that resource are acquired. In the context of human resource 
management, technology can be applied to ensure that repetitive and bure aucratic tasks are 
automated, freeing up professionals to focus on more strategic and value -added activities. This 
reflects the conceptual nature of the principle of diminishing marginal utility, where efficiency is 
maximized by directing resources towards  more productive activities.  
 
A practical example of this improvement in the performance of human resources in public 
administration can be seen in the implementation of personnel management systems based on 
artificial intelligence. These systems can analyze large data sets to identify  performance patterns, 
allowing for more efficient allocation of personnel. Furthermore, by automating recruitment, 
training and performance evaluation processes, these systems reduce the bureaucratic burden on 
employees, allowing them to focus on more str ategic tasks.  
 
By incorporating information and communication technologies, the public administration can 
improve the effectiveness of training programs, customizing them based on the individual needs of 
employees. This not only increases the satisfaction and engagement of civil servants, but also 
contributes to a more efficient and productive working environment.  
 
The concept of Human Capital gains even more relevance in the context of human resources 
management in the Public Administration, especially when integrated with information and 
communication technologies. When considering the importance of Human Capital i n public 
administration, it is crucial to recognize that civil servants play a fundamental role in providing 
services and implementing policies. Valuing and developing these human resources is essential to 
ensuring an effective government that is responsiv e to society's needs.  
 
Continuous training, supported by information and communication technologies, allows for the 
development of Human Capital, ensuring that civil servants are up to date with the skills needed to 
guarantee ever greater utility from the scarce public resources  at their disposal.  
Indeed, the efficient management of Human Capital in Public Administration resonates with the 
principles of utilitarianism, maximizing utility for society. Better trained public sector human 
resources, supported by appropriate technologies, are better equi pped to understand the needs of 
the community and apply the public resources at their disposal more effectively, thus aligning with 
the objectives of public utility.  
 
In the context of this article, the Principle of Diminishing Marginal Utility makes it possible to blur 
the subjective dimension of the utility that is generated from decisions made in the sphere of Public 
Administration.  
 
In terms of diminishing marginal utility, the automation of routine processes frees up human 
resources for tasks that require specific skills, creativity and decision -making. This strategic 
reallocation of resources reflects not only operational efficiency , but also the practical application of 
the principle of diminishing marginal utility in human resource management.  
Thus, the integration of knowledge into the Public Administration's Human Capital, enhanced by the 
Digital Age and ICT, emerges as a critical factor in maximizing the utility of public resources.

ID:5 - A multilevel analysis on faculty job satisfaction  
Eunbi Sim  & Shinhee Jeong  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper's importance  
 
Despite the crucial role faculty work plays in student learning, scientific advancement, and 
government decision -making, academic work environments have deteriorated over time (Shin and 
Jung, 2014). Tenure -track faculty members, including those in research -intensive universities, face 
the daunting task of teaching and mentoring students, providing professional services, and 
maintaining or improving research productivity. These responsibilities can take a toll on faculty 
members, leading to severe stress and  burnout. In fact, a 2020 survey of over 1,000 faculty 
members found that 69% of them reported being extremely stressed (The Chronicle of Higher 
Education, 2020).  
  
Given the pressing issues facing academia, there has been growing interest in improving faculty job 
satisfaction. However, most empirical studies on this topic have overlooked the department -level 
effects (e.g., Alonderiene and Majauskaite, 2016; Bozeman a nd Gaughan, 2011; Heyliger and 
Heyliger, 2014; Worthy et al., 2020), despite the fact that faculty members are nested within 
departments, each with its own unique atmosphere, policies, people, and culture.  
 
Research purpose    
 
The primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate a faculty job satisfaction model, 
which considers the influence of individual differences and departmental context on the overall job 
satisfaction of faculty members.  
 
Research questions  
 
3.1.To what extent do individual -level hygiene factors (such as equitable work distribution) and 
departmental -level hygiene factors (such as departmental collegiality and ineffective leadership of 
department head or dean) impact faculty's job satisfaction?   
 
3.2.How are hygiene factors at the individual and departmental levels interrelated in explaining 
faculty job satisfaction?  
 
Theoretical basis  
 
Using organizational justice theory (Greenberg, 1987) and the two -factor theory of motivation 
(Herzberg et al., 1959), this study aims to explain faculty job satisfaction. The two -factor theory 
explains that motivation and hygiene factors lead to job satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Motivation 
factors (e.g., achievement, autonomy, growth, responsibility) improve job satisfaction by meeting 
esteem and self -actualization needs. On the other hand, hygiene factors (e.g., relatio nships, salary, 
work conditions, job security) cause job dissatisfaction by not meeting physiological, safety, and love 
and belongingness needs. Hagedorn (2000) presented a faculty job satisfaction model based on the 
two-factor theory, which also considers  demographic and environmental factors (e.g., gender, race, 
age, tenure, department) that impact job satisfaction. Empirical studies have found that hygiene 
factors have a greater impact on faculty job satisfaction than motivation factors. Collaboration 
opportunities and interpersonal relationships increase job satisfaction, while ineffective leadership 
styles, such as passive/avoidant leadership, decrease it.

116 
Organizational justice theory, which draws on equity theory, is another useful framework for 
exploring faculty job satisfaction (Greenberg, 1987). This theory includes several components, such 
as (a) distributive justice, which examines how resources and o utcomes (such as compensation and 
pay) are distributed fairly, (b) procedural justice, which looks at how organizational processes (such 
as decision -making) are conducted in a fair manner, and (c) interactional justice, which examines 
how employees are tre ated equitably. Research has found that employees' perception of 
organizational justice is positively associated with motivation and overall job satisfaction (Al -Zu’bi, 
2010; Latham and Pinder, 2005).  
 
Hypothesis 1. Equitable work distribution (EWD) is positively associated with overall job satisfaction 
(OJS).  
Hypothesis 2. Departmental collegiality (DC) is positively associated with OJS.  
Hypothesis 3. Departmental dean or head’s ineffective leadership (DIL) is negatively associated with 
OJS. 
Hypothesis 4. DC positively moderates the relationships between EWD and OJS, such that the 
relationship is stronger when DC is strong rather than weak.  
Hypothesis 5. DIL negatively moderates the relationships between EWD and OJS, such that the 
relationship is stronger when DIL is weak rather than strong.  
 
Implications for HRD practice    
 
This paper aims to examine the impact of hygiene factors on the job satisfaction of faculty members 
at individual and departmental levels. It is expected to provide evidence to support HRD initiatives 
such as faculty development and retention, organization development interv entions, and culture 
change in higher education institutions, particularly in relation to departmental leadership and 
culture.  
 
Conclusions  
 
A two -level hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was employed to analyze data collected in 2021 at a 
research university located in the South of the United States. The data was structured with 
individual faculty members (n=392) nested within departments (n=50). The HLM results showed that 
all major effects of departmental and individual factors on OJS were signifi cant, supporting 
hypotheses 1, 2, and 3. However, the moderation effect of DC on the relationships between EWD 
and OJS was not significant, meaning that hypothesis 4 was not supported. Additionally, the result 
for hypothesis 5 was contrary to what was expe cted - DIL exhibited a significant and positive 
moderation effect in explaining the positive association between EWD and OJS. A detailed 
discussion of these findings will be provided in the full paper.

ID:78  - Bridging the Generation Gap:  Leadership Communication Competency 
framework for Leading Thai Diverse Workforces  
Wilailuck Kamjam  & Pawinee Petchsawang  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
 
These days, four generations coexist in many organizations, each with their own distinct styles, 
habits, and levels of technical proficiency. (PwC’s hopes & fears, 2023). The digital revolution is 
radically transforming the Thai workforce. Four distinct generations work side -by-side, each with 
unique styles, behaviors, and varying degrees of digital fluency. This presents an immense 
opportunity for innovation, agility, and a pressing c hallenge: bridging the digital generation gap. 
While digital tools connect like never before, they also amplify communication discrepancies.  
Leaders no longer simply manage; they must bridge the digital divide, foster collaboration, and 
unlock the full po tential of their multigenerational teams. Existing frameworks lack the precision 
and depth needed to navigate the complex digital landscapes of a multigenerational workforce.  
Theoretical based – Guiding by the lens of generational behavior and characteristics, digital fluency 
and generation -specific online behaviors, leadership theories and models (Bass, 1985; Hersey and 
Blanchard, 1969; Pearce & Conger, 2003, etc.), and commun ication competency (Spitzberg & 
Cupach, 1984) to explore the communication competency framework of leadership in the Thai 
multi -generational workforce.  
 
Research purpose  
 
The purpose of this study is to investigate the theoretical framework of communication competency 
for leaders, clarifying the significance of a leadership style for managing multigenerational 
workplaces from the viewpoints of both leaders and employees. Ad ditionally, in Thai 
multigenerational workplaces in the digital age, the elements crucial to developing a leader's 
communication ability will be explored.  
 
Research questions  
 
Three research questions will be addressed: i) What are the leadership styles to lead the multi -
generation workplaces in the Thai digital era? ii) What are the important leaders’ communication 
competencies in multi -generation workplaces based on the leader ’s and the employee’s 
perspectives? iii) What are the factors that are important to create the leader's communication 
competency of Thai multi -generation workplaces in the digital era? To address the research 
questions, qualitative research was employed. A pproximately 10 -20 individuals, both management -
level and staff -level, from a private organization with a multiple -generation environment will be 
interviewed.  
 
Implication for HRD practice  
 
This study builds upon research in leadership and communication in diverse workforces, specifically 
applying it to the unique challenges of the Thai digital era. The developed framework for leadership 
communication competency in the digital landscape offers Thai organizations a pragmatic roadmap 
to unlock  the full potential of their multigenerational workforce. By equipping leaders with the skills 
to navigate the digital generation gap, Thai firms can foster collaborative innovation, agility, and 
future success.

118 
 
Conclusion  
 
In the Thai digital era, workforce diversity extends beyond generations, encompassing distinct levels 
of digital fluency. This presents unique challenges, not just in bridging the generation gap, but in 
harnessing the full potential of a multigenerational digital workforce. This study has tackled this 
challenge head -on by developing a framework for leadership communication competency 
specifically tailored to the Thai digital landscape. The framework also goes beyond traditional 
notions of "communicative lea dership" by equipping leaders with the skills to navigate the 
complexities of digital communication across generations.

ID:158  - Fertility Treatments, Egg Freezing and Your Uterus: Innovative 
Employee Benefit or Ethical & Moral Nightmare?  
Clíodhna MacKenzie, Sarah Minnis, Joan Buckley  & Elaine O'Brien  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Importance of Paper  
 
Employee fertility benefits such as ‘egg freezing’ have become a strategic retention tool for many 
employers (Beioley, 2021) who now consider the once avant -garde offer of ‘egg freezing’ passe if not 
bordering on pedestrian (Flynn and Leslie, 2023; O'Rourk e et al., 2023). While these benefits 
arguably provide female employees with viable options that will allow them to establish a career 
foothold without the conflicting pressures associated with family planning and career development 
(De Proost and Coene, 2 022; Murugesu et al., 2023), there are significant downside risks that have 
failed to gain traction in the wider academic literature (Kolata, 2022). Elective egg freezing, 
therefore, may hold the key to leveling the corporate playing field affording talent ed female 
employees time to establish their careers unencumbered by their reproductive biological timescales 
but could also mark an inflection point in where the line between the firm and its employees’ family -
building plans is at best blurred, at worse, i ntrusive.  
 
One could conclude that these talent management and development strategies are remarkably 
progressive. An alternative narrative, however, might contend that they are little more than an 
attempt by organizations to hide work intensification, productivity, and delayed family planning in 
the guise of female empowerment and career develo pment (Birenbaum -Carmeli, 2023; Bryant, 
2023; Hammond, 2023). A more objective position might be that employers are offering an 
‘individual solution to structural problems’ (Myers and Martin, 2021, p. 17). This raises an important 
question: Are fertility t reatments such as egg freezing benefits an innovative female employee perk 
or ethical and moral nightmare? More importantly, given that talent management strategies are 
primarily interested in acquiring talent, will HRD professionals be left holding the pr overbial and 
literal baby if things go sideways with the firm’s ‘egg freezing’ benefit strategy? We simply don’t 
know the answer to that question and may not for many years.  
 
Theoretical Approach  
 
We propose, given the nature of firm’s offering ‘egg freezing’ benefits, a traditional social exchange 
perspective may not be applicable. Therefore, we argue that gift exchange / unconditional gift 
exchange theory (Fremeaux and Michelson, 2011; Akerlof, 1982) might provide a useful theoretical 
lens with whic h to understand the potential ethical and moral implications associated with firm’s 
offering ‘egg freezing’ as an employee attraction and development strategy when there is an implicit 
obligation on those availing of ‘egg freezing’ benefits to reciprocate in kind.  
 
Research Purpose  
 
The purpose of this research is twofold. First, to date, there have been no empirical studies seeking 
to understand the longer -term career development goals of women electing to join firms offering 
‘egg freezing’ benefits over firms that do not. Therefore,  we aim to position this paper as an 
opportunity to initiate a more critical debate on the use of fertility treatments as a talent 
management attraction and development strategy. Second, there have been no studies to date that 
have sought to understand the  role of HRD professionals tasked with the long -term development of 
high potential females that might avail of ‘egg freezing’ benefits. We know very little about the

120 
motivation of women who elect to freeze their eggs in an effort to postpone family -building to build 
a career. Why is it necessary for women to trade their fertility for career development opportunities 
and potential progression?  
 
Research Question  
 
There are numerous questions that have yet to be addressed regarding ‘egg freezing’ benefits and 
long -term career development goals of women who avail of the benefit. For example, are the firm’s 
talent attraction strategies integrated with the career devel opment strategies of the firm? Are ‘egg 
freezing’ benefits a stand -alone benefit or part of a larger family -building policy / family -friendly 
policy? What are the ethical / moral / legal implication if the ‘egg freezing’ benefit fails to deliver? 
What happ ens if a high potential female decides to leave before her eggs are defrosted, does the 
firm own them? How does the firm approach gender non -conforming or trans members of staff? 
How might same sex couples be treated? Does the policy apply equally across t he entire 
organization? Are females who elect to not freeze their eggs discriminated against because they 
may be perceived as not as committed as those that do?  
 
Implications for Theory and Practice  
 
While egg freezing benefits have been around since at least 2014 (Joiner, 2014; Shanahan, 2014; 
Alter, 2015; Mertes, 2015), and have become more mainstream since then, there is still a dearth of 
information with respect to how, why and under what circumsta nces firms may be offering ‘egg 
freezing’ benefits. This research aims to address this knowledge deficit. If the primary purpose of 
‘egg freezing’ benefits is the long -term attraction, retention, and development of key female talent – 
what role do HRD prof essionals play? Presumably, given the myriad psychological and emotional 
challenges many women face when dealing with infertility and their fertility journey, one could 
argue HRD professionals may be out of their depth when it comes to ‘egg freezing’ benef its. This 
research aims to start a conversation that is overdue.  
 
Conclusion  
 
If ‘egg freezing’ is the answer to the war for talent, or more specifically the war on company benefits, 
just what question are companies really asking. More importantly, does any firm have the right to 
surreptitiously insert itself into the family dynamic  of its workers? Where does the firm end and 
family begin? With ‘egg freezing’ benefits, we’re not talking about golden handcuffs anymore, where 
talking about an umbilical tether, and that’s just not right, or is it?

ID:11  - Evaluating the diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging of training 
programmes  
 
Ingeborg Kroese  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
With global crises and the rise of misogyny and sexism, progress regarding women’s equality and 
empowerment is regressing. In these challenging times, HRD should be deeply concerned with and 
committed to sex/gender equity. This includes relevant and inclusive learning and development 
opportunities; however, sex/gender continues to be neglected in training theory and practice. This 
work ing paper discusses a case study research aimed at changing the current neglect of sex/ 
gender, and other social categories of difference and marginalisation, such as race and disability, in 
training practice. The research explored whether learner survey q uestions that specifically focus on 
the diversity, equity, inclusiveness and belonging (DEIB) of training, provide the insights and 
incentives to recognise and address inequity in training.  
 
Theoretical framework  
 
The theoretical framework for this research was critical socioculturalism. With a critical sociocultural 
lens, training can be analysed as an integral part of organisations marked by inequities based on 
gender, race and other social categories. In addition, the author’s research and theory on how 
sex/gender -blind employee training strengthens current inequities, guided this research.  
 
Research purpose  
 
DEIB of training and learning is typically not evaluated or measured as part of learner surveys. By 
including questions about the DEIB of a training, DEIB becomes a deliverable for training providers, 
and it enables the collection of actionable insights on  how to improve the DEIB of training. For this 
purpose, a set of DEIB learner survey questions was developed. These questions were first shared 
with a panel of academic and professional L&D/ HRD thought leaders. Subsequently a case study 
was conducted, aim ed at piloting and validating the questions.  
 
Research methodology  
 
This qualitative case study research was conducted at a multinational corporation with three 
embedded units of analysis (three global training programmes). Data was collected using think -
aloud interviews, inviting interested learners to speak out loud whil e answering the survey 
questions, with the aim to understand how the questions and answer options were interpreted, 
how participants arrived at their answers and the completeness of the answer options. Data 
analysis included coding the interviews on experi ences with the DEIB of training, the interpretation 
and validity of the survey questions, as well as opportunities for improvement.  
 
Research questions  
 
• How do the DEIB survey questions help to understand the level of DEIB of a training?  
• What can be improved in the questions (clarity, relevance, completeness)?  
• How did the learners experience the DEIB of the researched training programs, and are 
there opportunities for improvement?

122 
 
 
Conclusion  
 
DEIB in training and learning is an important and overlooked aspect in training practice. DEIB 
learner survey questions are a powerful tool to understand and evaluate the equity and 
inclusiveness of training, and to make training providers responsible and accountable for the DEIB 
of their programmes. Based on this research, an advanced set of DEIB learner survey questions was 
developed, and insights on how to apply these, with the aim to better understand and improve the 
DEIB of learning programmes in companies and organisations.

ID:130  - Understanding Career Experiences of Muslim Professional Women in 
the West: Implications for HRD  
Omaima Hajjami  
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
 
Members of minority faith such as Muslim women face many challenges in the workplace 
particularly in the western context. Existing studies showed that Muslim women are denied 
employment opportunities (Allison, 2023), pay increase (Abdelhadi, 2019), and wor kplace 
promotions (Karahan & Tugsuz, 2021) compared to their non -Muslim counterparts. Scholars 
highlights faith -based discrimination and religious stereotypes as impeding factors to Muslim 
women career development. Despite the critical importance of the to pic, no current study has 
explored the experience of Muslim professional women in the west from a human resource 
development perspective. Addressing this gap is important to understand the challenges and 
suggest effective HRD and leadership practices to he lp improve Muslim women professional 
experience.  
 
Theoretical base  
 
Muslim women have captured the attention of scholars, intellectuals, and activists worldwide, 
addressing issues such as discrimination, family patriarchy, dress codes, and lack of representation 
in the workplace. Prevailing narratives repeatedly describe Muslim women in the west as 
oppr essed, submissive, and weak (Ali et al., 2017). Those narratives often lead to conclusions that 
individualize the Muslim women marginalization from the workplace to religious or individual 
reasons. In order to explain the challenges faced by Muslim women i n the western -based 
workplace, I use a multi -level analysis including individual (micro), organizational (meso), and 
national, societal, and cultural (Macro) level factors.  
 
Research purpose  
 
In this study, I will conduct a systematic literature review and synthesis of empirical studies 
exploring the career experiences of Muslim professional women in the western context. Ali et al. 
(2017) defined the western world as including all cultures that  are derived from and influenced by 
European cultures. Europe, Americas, South Africa, and Oceania, together constitute western 
society.  
 
Research questions  
 
Three central questions are guiding this review:  
 
1. What theoretical perspectives have informed the empirical studies of Muslim professional 
women's careers?  
2. What methodological approaches have been used to explore Muslim professional women's 
career experiences?  
3. What characterizes Muslim professional women's career experiences in terms of 
opportunities and challenges?

124 
Implications for HRD  
 
This article is not only important but is critical for human resource development. This study 
addresses a timely issue with significant theoretical, research, and practical relevance. For 
theoretical implications, this study could be useful for building ne w career theories that inform the 
experience of Muslim women in the workplace. For HRD research, this review will fill a part of the 
gap in diversity and inclusion literature and critical HRD that has not yet addressed the Muslim 
women minority population.  For HRD practitioners, this review will provide evidence -based findings 
that will help organizational leadership and HRD professionals better understand the current issues 
facing these Muslim women, understand how to attract them, and better ways to impro ve their 
experience.  
 
Conclusion:  
Work in progress.

ID:73  - Onboarding Immigrant Workers in Small to Medium Enterprises: A 
Canadian Model and Strategies  
Alicia Piechowiak  & Saul Carliner  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Employers across the group of seven (G7) largest democratic industrialized countries, Canada, 
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America (Council on 
Foreign Relations, 2021) are struggling to tap into a critical sou rce of labour: immigrants.   
Immigrants are needed to sustain G7 economies as their population ages, with a median age of 
38.5 and 48.6 years (World Population Review, 2022), and birth rates dip below the 2.1 births 
required to maintain their population (O rganisation for Economic Co -Operation and Development 
(OECD), 2020a).   Yet, immigrants representing 10.4% to 21% of G7 populations between 2017 and 
2019 (OECD, 2022) have unemployment rates ranging from 25.3% to 41.9% (OECD, 2020b).  Reasons 
for this incl ude a lack of language proficiency (Bélanger and Vézina, 2017; Townsend, Pascal and 
Delves, 2014), the non -recognition of education credentials (Walton -Roberts, 2005) and a lack of 
professional networks (Dalla, Ellis and Cramer, 2005; Hakak and Holzinger, 2010; Krahn, Derwing 
and Abu -Laban, 2005; Sherell, Hundman and Preniqi, 2005; Walton -Roberts, 2005).  Moreover, 
employers in less popular immigrant destinations are grappling with additional immigrant 
attraction challenges such as local economic conditions  (Miraftab and McConnell, 2008, Walton -
Roberts, 2005), providing integration services and community amenities (Bonikowska, Hou and 
Picot, 2017; Brown, 2017; Carter, Morrish and Amoyaw 2008; Williams, Kitchen and Randall, 2015; 
Teixeira and Drolet, 2018) an d building social networks (Collantes et al., 2014; Sapeha, 2015; Echref -
Ouédraogo, 2012).  These challenges may be addressed through companies’ onboarding programs, 
the policies and procedures used to recruit and train new employees (Feldman, 1976; Van Ma anen 
and Schein, 1979).  However, there is a gap in the literature concerning the onboarding of 
immigrants in less popular immigrant destinations.      
 
This study investigates the onboarding of immigrants in four Canadian companies in less popular 
immigrant destinations and their perceived efficacy from the perspectives of executives, managers, 
non-immigrant and immigrant workers.  It reveals similarities  and discontinuities between the two 
and helps develop a grounded model for onboarding immigrant workers with potential implications 
for how digital means may streamline the process.  
 
The study answers five research questions:  
1. What strategies do employers use to onboard immigrants in less popular immigrant 
destinations?  
2. What are the perceived challenges of onboarding immigrants?   
3. How do they see immigrants as meeting their labour needs and what drives this vision?  
4. What are employers' additional support needs?  
5. What are immigrants’ onboarding experiences?  
 
Framing this study is situated learning theory (Lave and Wenger, 2011), and systems theory from a 
Human Resource Development perspective (Weinberger, 1998), which requires multiple 
perspectives from within and across organizations to understand the whole.  Data consisted of: i) 
qualitative hermeneutical phenomenological interviews with six to eight employees, for a total of 
28, across four companies, ii) company onboarding and community integration service artefacts, 
and iii) field notes taken during visits  to the companies and communities.

126 
Results indicate the onboarding programs for immigrants are a cyclical learning process, framed by 
a culture of organizational learning, communication, and teamwork, and training is required for 
both new and existing workers.  Implications for Human Resour ce Development practitioners 
highlight the importance of developing a continuous improvement work culture as it contributes to 
overcoming the economic integration challenges immigrants face.  Moreover, a model adapted to 
the needs of immigrants emerged and  consists of seven iterative steps: i) prepare an action plan, ii) 
advertise and recruit strategically, iii) prepare existing and incoming staff, iv) offer workplace and 
job orientation programs, v) offer social integration support, vi) follow -up with furt her investments 
in people and vii) evaluate the onboarding experience.

ID:14  -Impact of Work -Life Balance on Employee Retention: A Data -Driven 
Machine Learning Study  
 
Ali El Dirani  & Kassem Danach  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
A vital problem for companies looking to retain a skilled and effective team is employee retention. 
Using a data -driven methodology, this study examines the impact of work -life balance on employee 
retention. We examine a vast amount of employee data using sophisticated data analytics and 
machine learning algorithms to obtain an understanding of the intricate con nection between work -
life balance and retention rates. Many machine learning approaches are used in our research, such 
as neural networks, decision trees, random forests, regression analysis, and support vector 
machines. Our objective in utilizing these al gorithms is to reveal latent trends, variables, and 
forecasters that influence workers' choices to remain with or go from their companies. The study 
makes use of an extensive dataset that was obtained from a variety of businesses. This dataset 
includes lab or hours, job satisfaction indicators, employee demographics, and other pertinent 
characteristics. We use selection and feature engineering techniques to determine the key variables 
influencing employee retention. We further validate our results using perf ormance indicators 
specific to each machine learning method and cross -validation. The knowledge acquired from this 
study may influence HR plans and guidelines, enabling businesses to deal with staff retention 
problems in a proactive manner. This research a dds significantly to the current conversation on 
work -life balance and how it affects employee retention by utilizing data analytics and machine 
learning.

ID:27  – Smart Contracts: Contract Management  in the Public Sector for 
Internal Control Transformations  
Bruno Cezario, Fabiano Batista, Danielle Vieira, Martius Rodriguez, Patricia 
Bilotta & Andre Guedes  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Contract management in the public sector is widely discussed in the literature, especially regarding 
the governance of processes and best practices in municipal public control. Therefore, a possible 
solution is using smart contracts in municipalities' control processes, as they enable a change in 
management, reduce costs, bring transparency and sustainability, and introduce innovative 
practi ces, such as inserting new payment methods. The sustainability of the municipal public 
management process for contract management becomes effective when several services no longer 
need to use paper forms – environmental improvement, as the software is mode led for different 
types of contracts that different parties of electronic way can audit. The literature review was 
carried out through qualitative exploratory research that analyzed scientific articles, theses, 
dissertations, case studies, books, reports o n the study topic, and documents accessed during visits 
to the municipalities that were part of the research. The results of the literature studies were 
combined to obtain a broader view of the topic. The case study aimed to investigate the possibilities 
of using smart contracts in three (3) Brazilian Northeast Latin America municipalities by evaluating 
innovative technologies, such as electronic inspection processes and adherence to the insertion of 
smart contracts for better governance in public tenders. Environmental sustainability will only be 
met with social and economic sustainability since using intelligent contracts to prepare public 
contracts brings reliability, speed, cost reduction, publicity, and privacy. The project is aligned with 
the 2030 Agen da and international public transparency recommended by bodies such as the United 
Nations (UN) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

ID:29  - Definitions of organization well -being in the new normal era: A 
Qualitative research  
Dawisa Sritanyarat, Oranuch Pruetipibultham  & Asma Tehmarn  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Changes in global and local contexts impacted perceptions, notions, and ways toward organization 
well-being. The lifestyle has changed through the years of digital transformation and the new 
normal led by the global pandemic. Likewise, the way working peop le interpret happiness at work, 
quality of work -life, and well -being has changed too. This research studied the definitions of 
organization well -being and how it is interpreted by working people in Thailand, as a starting point 
for broadening the concept o f organization well -being, from personal happiness to a more holistic 
organization -related concept. Efforts should span from individual level, process level, to 
organization level. Changes should be facilitated considering organization strategy, structure,  
system design, process management, as well as employee well -being and satisfaction.  
This research builds on the work of Sritanyarat and Pruetipibultham (2023) which investigated 
definitions of organization well -being in the new normal era, using an integrative literature review. 
This extended study explored the concept by collecting empir ical data using the qualitative method 
to explore insight into definitions of organization well -being in the context of Thailand, especially in 
the new normal era.  
 
Data were collected by interviewing practitioners that represent 20 organizations in Thailand from 
different industries, known to have supporting functions and policies for employee well -being. The 
semi -structured interviews were operated to collect data f rom participants, with probing questions 
asked when there were issues other than those from the main questions. Data analysis was 
conducted using the theory -based coding method (Ruona, 2005). The data derived from the 
definitions of organization well -being  from the participants was used as the starting point. It was 
also coded based on the framework of Rummler and Brache’s (2013) Nine Cells.  
 
The concept of organization well -being in Thailand has been related to the Thai Health Foundation’s 
concept of happy workplaces or the Happy 8, as well as the concept of healthy organization. 
Therefore, literature relating to the two concepts —a happy workp lace and a healthy organization 
were reviewed. It was noticed that the two concepts relate to the organization well -being, yet not 
similar.  
  
Sritanyarat and Pruetipibultham (2023) found that for an organization to achieve its well -being, it 
needs to design and manage processes and jobs to meet the desirable goals at every level. Their 
findings fit with the Nine Cells concept. Therefore, in this  paper, another part of the literature review 
is dedicated to the concept of Nine Cells organization diagnosis, which would be used as a 
foundation of data interpretation.  
 
The findings were discussed alongside the previous study of Sritanyarat and Pruetipibultham (2023) 
that examined the definitions based on the Nine Cell framework as well as used to fulfillment the 
concept of Happy 8 from the ThaiHealth organization. The re sults from this empirical qualitative 
research provided a wider and deeper elaboration of Sritanyarat and Pruetipibultham’s (2023) 
elements of organization well -being. Sritanyarat and Pruetipibultham (2023) identified thirty -six 
performance variables, acco rding to the term used in the Nine Cells concept, that emerged from the 
analysis of a good number of peer -reviewed sources. After qualitative data collection and 
interpretation, a total of thirty -nine performance variables were found, along with an elabora tion of 
the existing performance variables.

130 
Based on this qualitative study, it was found that organization well -being in the new normal era 
extends to both the physical and mental health of employees. This includes employees' work -life 
balance and employee engagement. To enhance well -being, organiz ations need to redesign 
systems/policies, restructure organizations well and allocate workforces to better serve the 
changing operational situations. After all, employees themselves need to be aware of ‘why’ and 
‘how’ they are required to keep themselves f it and healthy.  
 
The organization's policies and regulations should be revisited to allow the redesign of either goals, 
processes, or management approaches that nurture the well -being of employees. Clear processes 
should be put in place by adhering to principles relating t o considering the well -being of health and 
work designed for them to have freedom in decision -making and be able to self -develop. In 
addition, appropriate physical working environments should be prepared for multi -platforms. 
Positive relationships at work across hierarchical levels should be ensured. Key take -away from the 
previously mentioned findings for HR practitioners is that organizational well -being is born out of 
nurturing, not by nature. It is a part of the results of HR and OD practices, with clea r objectives to 
nurture organizational well -being. Moreover, the findings here can be interpreted that to nurture 
organizational well -being, practitioners need to work on HR and OD processes, not to only create 
activities. Having employee satisfaction -related activities is nice, yet not enough. The systematic 
processes are vital.  
 
Apparently, the results show that the definitions of organization well -being that emerged from this 
qualitative research resembled the one based on the integrative literature review presented by 
Sritanyarat and Pruetipibultham (2023). In addition, this res earch discovered that employee 
engagement plays an important part in an organization's well -being.  
It is also worth noting that employee engagement in this case extends to the ex -employees too. 
Specifically, the policies that were open for former employees to return to work with the 
organization were highlighted. HR policies in accordance with enabling such engagement were 
mentioned significantly as well. In addition to work -based competencies, recruitment, and selection 
should be redesigned and established to seek people who have personal goals that align with those 
of the organization. The redesigned p olicy needed to be inclusive and embrace diversity issues; 
these would lead to the design work process that supports employees with diverse needs. The 
freedom to choose whether to work remotely or in a hybrid manner, job design that can ensure 
transparency  and fairness at work, and collective work environment were mentioned as the reason 
for work -based well -being.  
 
This study elaborates on how Thai employees contemplate well -being at a multi -organizational 
level. Using the Nine -cell framework, the paper reveals how leaders can rethink and redesign the 
organizational system, policies, and structure to facilitate the t ransition of well -being in a new 
normal era. The prior concept regarding a happy workplace that had been predominantly 
established in Thailand was found to be rather short of the job -based dimension. It is worth noting 
that the results of this qualitative data interpretation demonstrated alignment with the results of 
the research based on an integrative literature review previously studied by Sritanyarat and 
Pruetipibultham (2023). The combined study is determined to be used for future organization well -
being diagnosis tool development to enhance the understanding of organization well -being and 
happy workplace in Thailand. Based on the present study, individuals, academia, and practitioners 
who are interested in driving organization well -being may study thes e preliminary results and use 
them as a guideline or lesson to apply for their further work designs, future research questions, or 
escalating the issue for a better and concrete development.

ID:38  - Developing Employee Engagement Strategies in the new digital work 
environment: Strategies for Sustainable HRD Practice  
Roopa Nagori  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Research gap/significance  
 
The emergence of hybrid work has implications for HRD professionals in the areas of people 
management capabilities, leadership development, communication and collaboration, productivity 
and wellbeing. There is now a case for a greater focus on well -being, especially digital wellbeing in 
hybrid work, for which we need to design specific interventions and strategies. The gap in literature 
highlights that a clearer understanding is required for the design and development of the hybrid 
workplace to protect work er’s wellbeing, sustaining engagement and productivity. Further, the 
United Nations has proposed 16 Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG), where goal 3 prioritises 
wellbeing while goal 8 focuses on decent work that results in enhancing employee wellbeing.  
 
Further, there is a need to analyse which and how the different forms of working have an influence 
on wellbeing and performance, examining them through the medium of Employee Engagement. 
This aspect could be extremely relevant also for managers and compani es that redesign their 
organisations to find the best fit of hybrid arrangements to stimulate and guarantee the general 
wellbeing of employees.  
 
Aim  
The main aim of this research is to recommend strategies for sustaining employee engagement and 
wellbeing in the current context of hybrid work  
 
Objectives  
• To evaluate the factors influencing employee engagement and wellbeing of employees in 
the new context of hybrid work  
• To analyse the impact of current strategies that global organisations have adopted and their 
influence on HRD practice  
• To recommend sustainable HRD strategies for improved productivity and digital wellbeing in 
hybrid work  
 
Research Questions  
1. What are the factors that influence employee engagement and wellbeing of employees in 
hybrid work?  
2. What are the current strategies that global organisations have adopted and what is their 
influence on HRD practice?  
3. What strategies are recommended to sustain productivity and digital wellbeing in the 
workplace?  
 
Theoretical base  
 
While progress in the field of HRD has acknowledged the benefits of employee engagement to 
performance outcomes, researchers such as Guest (2017), Jenkins and Delbridge (2013) are of the 
opinion that the search for a link between people development and performance has been pursued 
at the expense of a concern for employee wellbeing. Recent frameworks such as Caring HRM by

132 
Saks (2022) and Sustainable Wellbeing as recommended by Fabio and Cooper (2023) highlight the 
current gaps in research and need for further investigation.  
 
Methods/Analytical Techniques  
 
This study uses an interpretive qualitative research methodology, undertaking semi -structured 
interviews with 32 HRD practitioners from global enterprises. Thematic content analysis is then 
applied to the findings to reveal key themes as strategies for ind ustry.  
 
Conclusions/Implications for HRD practice  
 
There is a need now for organisations to develop a clear and effective strategy to balance employee 
needs in hybrid work and the requirements of the business and this can be achieved through 
sustainable HRD practice -effective communication, collaboration and development strategies in the 
new context of hybrid work. This paper will provide strategies to HRD practitioners  to design and 
implement organization development practices for improved digital wellbeing and employee 
engagement in hybrid work.

ID:54  - Working Paper - Extracting the components of Psychological Contracts 
of Hotel employees in Northern Germany  
 
Christian Rebehn, Lynn Nichol  & Robin Bell  
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
 
Hotels around the world have been experiencing dangerous levels of labour shortage and high 
turnover (Hwang et al. 2014; Ma, Ren and Zhao 2021). These phenomena have been affecting both 
developed and emerging markets and staff retention is now an action pr iority for practitioners (dwif 
consulting 2022; Salama et al. 2022). The shortage of qualified labour has already caused noticeable 
economic damage in some regions (Müggler, Liechti and Schärrer 2022). In Northern Germany, 
tourism constitutes a key industr y with a wide range of other sectors depending on it (SGVSH 2020); 
as the region, particularly its rural and remote areas, is facing developmental marginalization 
(Siedentop and Stroms 2021; Wolf 2016), stabilizing the industry is an important task.  
 
Theoretical base  
This research takes the position of Rousseau (1989) that the Psychological Contract is to be defined 
as a unilateral set of beliefs and expectations. Thus, the current project focuses exclusively on the 
subjective, intra -personal view on the Psychological Contract and aims to establish an 
understanding of the nature of Psychological Contracts among hotel employees in the region. The 
role of the Psychological Contract in employee retention has been recognized and received 
academic attention in recent years ( Holland and Scullion 2021; Shanker Chaubey 2016; Snyman 
2022; Tabassum and Ghosh 2023).   
 
Research Purpose and Method  
 
This study seeks answers to the following questions:  
• What shared viewpoints exist among frontline hotel employees in Northern Germany about 
the employer inducements expected in their Psychological Contract?  
• Which inducements are equally valued by employees?  
• On the importance of which inducements do viewpoints differ?  
• What demographic and workplace characteristics are associated with the different 
viewpoints?  
 
We have adopted Q Methodology to enable us to determine the variety of viewpoints which may 
exist among different demographics and across the diverse landscape of workplaces.  In this 
working paper we present the set of subjective statements reflecting exp ectations on employer 
inducements which may be formed by employees and potentially our initial findings from the Q 
sort. The statement concourse was accessed by reviewing 141 job postings published on a popular 
job search portal for hospitality professiona ls (Hotelcareer. 2023) in September 2023 as well as 
corporate career websites of hotel companies active in Northern Germany. Analysis revealed a 
concourse of explicitly and implicitly promised inducements from which 97 initial statements in 20 
categories w ere derived. These were reduced to 49 statements in 13 themes, phrased from a first -
person perspective. The statements will be employed in a Q Sort (Watts and Stenner 2012) to 
determine the relative importance of inducements to employees regarding their jo b satisfaction.  
 
Conclusions and implications for practice

134 
The overarching purpose of this study is to generate a basis on which practitioners can make 
informed decisions about strategies and tactics to improve their employees’ job satisfaction and 
increase staff retention. The findings will also provide a basis f or further academic engagement with 
the topic and for improving our understanding of the mechanisms behind the labor shortage in this 
particular environment and help the search for a sustainable solution.

ID:56  - “I have found a new love for working”.  HRD and engagement in later -
career to extend working lives  
 
Kate Black, Russell Warhurst  & Claire Hedley  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Importance of the paper  
 
Despite significant digital developments and the robotisation of certain work, the Western world is 
experiencing significant skills and labour shortages (House of Commons, 2023).  Such shortages can 
be attributed, at least in part, to the disengagement and departure of skilled later -carer workers 
from the workforce (CBI, 2022).  In efforts to stem this loss, age -equalities policies and legal statute 
have attempted to reduce age discrimination and reverse  stereotypes of older -workers.  These 
efforts have included HRD -interventions to upskill later -career employees to prolong their 
workplace engagement but to also upskill their managers to understand how best to engage later -
career employees.  However, the efficacy of these interventions is typically limited (Davis, 2023), 
with later -career employees often taking retirement as soon as possible and diverting their energies 
elsewhere.  
 
Research purpose  
This paper examines the lived experiences of later -career workers with the specific intention of 
understanding if/how they are engaged by work and how HRD might strengthen their continued 
engagement.  
 
Research questions  
Three guiding questions are discerned:  
1. How do later -career employees experience paid -employment?  
2. How important for later -career employees is remaining engaged within their career?  
3. How can HRD engender the engagement of later -career workers to extend working 
lives?  
 
Theoretical base  
 
The paper draws upon models of engagement (Saks, 2019; Kwon & Kim, 2020) and models for EWL 
(Krekula and Vickerstaff, 2017; Kooij et al., 2020) to inform an empirical study involving structured 
qualitative data generation with 79 participants.  This sample  comprised participants self -identifying 
as aged 55+ and in employment, self -employment or undertaking voluntary work.  
 
Analysis and Implications  
 
Initial analysis shows these later -career employees desired to engage with paid -employment for two 
overarching reasons.  First, many feared that work cessation signalled decline and vulnerability 
while they, second, feared for their cognitive health throug h “boredom and lack of mental 
stimulation”.  However, rather than striving for high performance and productivity, their desire was 
to give back and make a difference for others, while learning afresh and reinventing themselves 
through such work.  To achiev e this rejuvenation, the participants often sought alternative, bridge 
jobs, whether paid or voluntary.  Where their financial situation necessitated that they continued 
their career job, many yearned to “step back and do something more fulfilling”.

136 
 
These initial findings progress the extant literature that largely proposes accommodative strategies 
for EWL such as flexible working, to propose strategies that develop these employees’ “new love for 
working”.  Implications thus lie in encouraging HRD -practitioners to offer those in later -career 
opportunities to “help to make someone else’s day better” within their organisation.  Repositioning 
later -career employees as mentors would enable organisations to not only extend these employees’ 
working lives gua rding then from premature ageing and ill -health, but economically, would reduce 
the leakage of vital skills and labour from organisations.  
 
Conclusions  
 
It should be acknowledged that the HRD necessary to support engagement of later -career workers 
is different to that of younger employees.  It necessitates recognising that their ambitions may no 
longer lie in personal achievement but in learning new things  in new ways and in supporting others 
to learn.

ID:64  - The impact of workplace spirituality on innovative work behavior of 
employees in public administration: a bibliometric analysis  
Subhankar Das, Francesca Di Virgilio  & Antonia Puccio  
 
ABSTRACT  
The evolution of the contemporary work environment has led to an increasing awareness of the 
importance of the spiritual climate in influencing employee behaviors. In the context of public 
administration, where the complexity of challenges requires innovative responses, the relationship 
between spiritual climate and Innovative Work Behavior (IWB) emerges as a topic of significant 
interest. By promoting ethical values and interpersonal connections, the spiritual climate acts as an 
accelerator to encourage and enhance the innovative work behavior of public employees.  
 
The spiritual climate represents the collective perception of employees, providing an environment 
that facilitates personal harmonization through the meaning attributed to work, the ability to 
overcome individual limits and balance with the social and natu ral environment. Organizations 
grounded in spiritual values offer greater opportunities for personal growth to employees, 
strengthen interpersonal bonds, and attract and retain human resources. A spiritual work 
environment enables organizations to achieve much higher productivity compared to those that do 
not focus on this aspect, thus achieving higher performance.  
 
Spirituality practiced in the workplace not only positively impacts organizational performance but 
also influences the innovative behavior of employees. Innovative work behavior represents 
employees' intentional generation, introduction, and application of  innovations at work within a 
group or organization to contribute to performance. A spiritually enriched work environment 
stimulates the innovation and creativity of employees, positively impacting their innovative 
behavior. It generates organizational awa reness, leading to creativity and innovation, deepens 
individual awareness, amplifies intuitive capacity to enhance innovation, and simultaneously 
increases a sense of duty and engagement to the organization.  
 
To promote IWB in the public sector, it is imperative to redefine organizational culture through 
spiritual leadership, the result of beliefs, attitudes, and actions that naturally inspire and engage 
employees. Spiritual leadership enhances motivation, buil ds loyalty, and generates creative 
potential. The lack of spiritual leadership negatively impacts performance and organizational 
expectations, influencing the organizational climate.  
 
Establishing a spiritual climate requires that employees are understood and valued, creating a 
sense of affection and belonging. Stimulating satisfaction, happiness, and joy among workers 
fosters higher motivation in task execution, increases the ability t o tackle more challenging tasks, 
and makes workers more inclined to embrace innovation. Inevitably, this leads to a reduction in 
work stress.  
 
In this scenario, the study will be conducted through a bibliometric analysis of literature focused on 
qualitative and quantitative approaches in the context of public administration, utilizing recognized 
academic databases to identify relevant studies. Th is approach will provide a comprehensive 
overview of current research trends and gaps, informing further developments in the field. This 
paper will present a future research agenda with the potential to generate new knowledge sharing 
in the field of public  administration.

ID:70  - The Impact of COVID -19 on Organisational Culture in UK Higher 
Education Institutions: A Systematic Literature Review  
Ruby Christine Mathew, Philip Coombes, Steven Cock, Susie Walsh, Alan 
Johnston & Lynsey Walker -Smith  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Purpose  
 
There is growing concern internationally over the changing nature of work or the ‘new normal’ 
resulting from the COVID -19 global health crisis (Vyas, 2022). CIPD (2023) in their future workplace 
trends note that COVID -19 has been a major disrupter and a ke y workforce change accelerator 
resulting in changes to how work is likely to be perceived in the coming decade. Studies argue that 
changing workplace norms have resulted in increased job insecurity among workers, job 
intensification, increased use of techn ology and an associated requirement for skills development 
and changing boundaries of work and home (Hite and Macdonald, 2020; Watermeyer et al., 2021). 
In the context of academic organisations, studies further argue that Higher education institutions 
have  now moved from the ‘panic -gogy’ stage of COVID -19 and are at the transformation stage 
where distance working and other flexible approaches to learning and delivery have become more 
commonplace (Dean & Campbell, 2020).   
 
Recently, Cornelius -Bell and Bell (2021) have argued that academic work has turned out to be a 
‘precariat’ for academics who struggle to find job security, are denied a stable future, and are 
required to hold educational qualifications that are greater tha n labour market expectations.  
Furthermore, they argue that a profit -driven approach has resulted in the ‘zombification’ of 
universities where academics must compete for the highest rated publications and teaching 
evaluation results.  Studies recommend fut ure research to investigate the ‘pulse of universities’ to 
better understand the transformation of the higher education workplace in challenging times 
(Watermeyer et al., 2021). In this context, it becomes imperative to update post -COVID -19 
knowledge on or ganisational cultures within UK universities to support higher education policy 
development and enhance workplace practices to support UK academics.   
 
We argue that more can however also be learned from a complementary systematic review of the 
entire body of work discussing the impact of COVID -19 on organisational culture in UK Higher 
Education Institutions. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to synthesise existing studies on 
the impact of COVID -19 on the organisational culture of UK higher education institutions into 
relevant topics and provide a road map for academic researchers and practitioners to further 
investigate such issues.  This review seeks to understand current research undertaken on such 
topics and to synthesise research findings systematically to provide a more comprehensive 
understanding of post -COVID -19 workplace culture in UK higher education institutions.   
 
Methodology  
 
To present our analysis, a search using Clarivate Analytics Web of Science (WoS) was undertaken for 
the period between 2020 and 2023 inclusive. Following some experimentation with search strings, 
the final search was undertaken using the search string ‘cul ture*’ AND ‘universit*’ AND ‘COVID -19’ 
OR ‘Covid -19’ in the TOPIC of the publication. By selecting the TOPIC, WoS searches the document 
titles, abstracts, and keywords. This search revealed 147 journal articles in the WoS categories of 
Business, Business F inance, Education Educational Research, Education Scientific Disciplines,

139 
Education Special, and Management, between 2021 and 2023. The 3 -Rs Protocol of retrieve, review 
and report was implemented to underpin the study (Coombes, 2023).  
  
Findings  
 
The initial findings from our dataset indicate the formative nature of research investigating the 
impact of COVID -19 on the organisational culture in Higher Education Institutions. As part of our 
analysis, we deepen and identify the co -occurrence of all ke ywords analysis between 2021 and 
2023. We undertake a bibliometric analysis of keywords, nodes, visualisations, labels, and co -
citation links, including the use of techniques such as keyword maps. In our co -occurrence of 
Keywords map, four clusters have be en identified. In Cluster 1, the keywords with the highest total 
link strength are diversity, equity, higher education, impact, management, perceptions, and 
performance. In Cluster 2, the keywords are digital transformation, higher education, knowledge, 
online learning, technology, and university. In Cluster 3, the keywords are covid -19 pandemic, 
culture, education, satisfaction, students, and teachers. Finally, in Cluster 4, the keywords are Covid -
19, e -learning, and pandemic. However, following a manual s creening of this dataset, only five 
articles in our sample presented research in the context of the United Kingdom (see Blell et al., 
2023; Kotera et al., 2020; Watermeyer et al., 2021; Yang, 2022). This lacuna hence providing 
opportunities for further res earch.  
 
Relevance/contribution  
 
The paper contributes to organisational culture and HRD literature by presenting a brief 
longitudinal bibliometric analysis and, based on the analysis, discussing where assimilation has 
taken place in the literature hitherto for organisational behaviour sc holarship to identify potential 
research directions going forward. This provides an insight for developing HRD interventions and 
strategies for the post -Covid workplace.

ID:72  – ‘Fair Work’ HR as a Route  to Employee Work Engagement  
Colin Lindsay, Patricia Findlay  & Johanna McQuarrie  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
There is evidence that improving work engagement can have benefits for organisational 
performance and employee wellbeing (CIPD, 2021; Saks and Gruman, 2021).  Much of the extant 
research on antecedents of work engagement adopts the Job Demands Resources (JDR) model to 
identify elements of job design that might enhance engagement among employees (Lesener et al., 
2020). There has been less emphasis on how job resources at the individual level combine with 
broader, formal HR and employm ent practices to foster conditions for improved work engagement. 
This working paper deploys mixed methods to explore the relationship between job demands and 
resources, a range of other progressive HR practices (which we term ‘Fair Work’ HR investments), 
and outcomes for employees in terms of work engagement and reduced burnout risk.  
 
THEORETICAL BASE  
 
A substantial evidence base has sought to identify facilitators of ‘work engagement’ – ‘a positive, 
fulfilling, affective -motivational state of work -related wellbeing’ (Bakker and Leitner, 2010) – given 
that there is evidence that higher levels of work eng agement may be associated with positive 
outcomes for both organisations (for example, reduced absenteeism and staff turnover and 
improved productivity) and employees (for example, reduced burnout risk and better long -term 
wellbeing). There is evidence that  suggests that the interaction of job demands and job resources 
(such as peer and line manager support; autonomy; and access to effective feedback) is important 
to understanding variance in employees’ reported work engagement (Xanthopoulou and Bakker, 
2021 ). However, despite the clear importance of this JDR -informed research, fewer studies have 
sought to factor in a broader range of ‘progressive’ HR practices as potential drivers of difference in 
levels of work engagement. This is despite the prioritisation  of ‘Decent Work’ or ‘Fair Work’ (and the 
workplace and HR practices that might deliver it) by some policymakers, for example in the 
devolved governments of the UK (Fair Work Wales, 2019; Scottish Government, 2022). This working 
paper builds from the defin ition of ‘Fair Work’ adopted by Scotland’s independent Fair Work 
Convention (2016) – ‘work that offers all individuals an effective voice, opportunity, security, 
fulfilment and respect’ – to operationalise Fair Work HR practices; and to explore how the pre sence 
of these practices, job demands and resources, and other workplace factors contribute to 
differences in work engagement among employees.  
 
RESEARCH PURPOSE  
This working paper seeks to explore the potential importance of Fair Work HR practices and a range 
of other workplace practices and organisational factors in providing the context for work 
engagement. To address these issues, we first present a preliminary , high -level analysis of survey 
responses from 3,665 employees across 30 UK organisations in six key sectors. We then present 
good practice case study evidence from three organisations in the engineering, hospitality and non -
profit sectors (including 15 in -depth interviews with senior managers). We find that – controlling for 
a range of organisational, sectoral and individual -level factors – the presence of what we term Fair 
Work HR practices is a key driver of work engagement in many cases (with other job resources such 
as levels of autonomy also significant). Work engagement is inversely related to self -reported 
burnout among employees. Our case studies identify drivers of Fair Work HR investments across 
sectors associated with: the need to retain staff; a  renewed emphasis on employee wellbeing 
informed by experiences during the Covid -19 crisis; and business models that (despite the diverse 
sectoral coverage of our case studies) depended on engaged employees delivering high quality,

142 
personalised services. We also discuss limits to Fair Work HR investments such as resource 
constraints and variable line manager capabilities.  
 
RESEARCH QUESTION/S  
 
Our research questions include: How important are Fair Work HR practices in promoting work 
engagement? What forms do Fair Work HR practices take and what does ‘good practice’ look like 
within and across organisations? What organisational and team -level challenges generate barriers 
to Fair Work?  
  
IMPLICATIONS FOR HRD PRACTICE  
The research highlights the potential value of a range of different Fair Work HR practices – as well as 
investments in job resources – as a route to enhanced work engagement among employees. The 
research also considers the potentially important role of HRD  interventions that support managers 
at all levels to promote Fair Work and employee engagement.   
 
CONCLUSIONS  
 
Our conclusions focus on the need for further research and practice -sharing on the scope for – and 
barriers to – Fair Work HR practices across different organisational contexts, as well further 
research on organisational and team -level barriers to and faci litators of the adoption of such 
practices.

ID:89  - Equity Leadership and Employee Engagement: A Qualitative Study  
Matthew Hurtienne, Laura Hurtienne  & Jessica Knierim  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Importance  
 
Various leadership theories have been looked at, researched, and analyzed in the field of social 
science. Many of these theories have been developed with the goal to benefit organizational 
cultures and outcomes (Hurtienne and Hurtienne, 2023). These leader ship theories have direct 
implications to employee engagement and likely employee retention (Hurtienne et al. 2021).  
Human Resource Development plays an integral role in researching the intersection of leadership 
theories and employee engagement, as “HRD recognizes that no organization can reach its full 
potential if its own employees are not fully engaged and productive” (Hurtienne, p. 96). According to 
Brad Shuck (2020), the human resource development community that engages employees will 
“work harder, a re more creative, and outperform their colleagues…experience life with less stress, 
report higher levels of wellbeing, are less frequently burned out, and have a higher life satisfaction 
score than other employees who report lower levels of engagement” (p.  59). 
In professional organizations, it is not uncommon to see seventy -six percent of employees looking 
for other job opportunities if they do not feel valued by their organization and leaders (Remedy, 
2021). A closer look reveals that only one in four employees  feel they are connected to the culture 
of the organization and only one in every three employees feel they belong at that their 
organization (Gallup, 2022). Seventy -six percent of employees look for other job opportunities if 
they do not feel valued at wo rk (Remedy, 2021).  Apollo Technical (2022) notes that a third of all new 
employees will leave their jobs within six months. There is also an average of four million 
employees quit their jobs in 2022, with ten to twenty -two million job openings per month ( U.S. 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022).  
 
Considering organizational statistics, it is not surprising that only that only 23 percent of the global 
workforce is effectively engaged at work and 31 percent of the workforce in North America (Gallup, 
2023). Additionally, organizations that report low e ngagement are more likely to see higher levels of 
turnover, at rates up to 18% to 43% more than organizations with highly engaged employees 
(Gallup, 2021). Organizations should also note that each employee that resigns can cost the 
organization one -half to  two times the employee's annual salary (Gallup, 2019). Collectively, these 
intricacies of employee engagement highlight the importance of organizations considering all 
variables that impact employee engagement, performance, and retention, especially when 
identifying the cost factors associated with employee retention.  
 
Highly engaged employees demonstrate innovative behavior, better performance results, and a 
greater intent to stay with the organization (Gull et al., 2020; Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004). Employees 
who are engaged, supported, and find meaning in their work can  impact organizational productivity 
and success (Hurtienne et al., 2021; Ramlall, 2008). Direct leaders can have a strong effect on 
employee engagement (Hurtienne et al., 2021); therefore, it is vital to understand how leadership 
approaches can influence e mployees. There are many different types of leadership styles that have 
been published. Not all theories have been published with same level of academic rigor or the 
ability to better understand the impact leadership models have a on employee engagement. T his 
paper will closely look through a constructive qualitative research lens at how the framework of 
equity leadership (Hurtienne and Hurtienne, 2023; Hurtiene et al. 2023) impacts employee 
engagement.

144 
Theoretical Base  
 
Social exchange theory is often used to understand EE better, as it infers that “obligations are 
generated through a series of interactions between parties who are in a state of reciprocal 
interdependence” (Saks and Rotman, 2006 p. 603). Often, social exchange theory is seen as a 
guiding framework to better understand workplace behavior and decision -making (Cropanzano and 
Mitchell, 2005). In addition, social exchange theory unders tands that “relationships evolve over time 
into trusting, loyal, and mutual commitment” (p. 875). Through social exchange theory, an 
employee’s engagement sets the stage for a cyclical reciprocation of positivity from the employer 
(Hurtienne et al., 2021, p. 141).  
 
Social Exchange Theory helps to provide a lens to examine working individuals and the expectations 
employees have of their direct supervisor and other organizational leaders. This theory also speaks 
to the importance of organizations providing resources su ch as, salary, employee appreciation, 
trust, etc. (Fuller et al., 2006; Blau, 1964). At the core, the fundamental principles of Social Exchange 
help to explain that humans, both leaders and employees, in work environments will choose 
appropriate behavioral  responses that will meet their own self -interests.  In summary, Social 
Exchange Theory aids in understating how professional work relationships continues to move 
forward or come to an end; the measurement is based on a subject cost -benefit analysis betwee n 
two individuals (Hurtienne et al., 2023).  
 
Equity leadership is a theory that focuses on the reciprocal interactions of social exchange theory as 
well as the ERG theory of motivation (Hurtienne and Hurtienne, 2023). Equity Leadership seeks to 
identify individual employee’s personal and professional  resource, relationship, and opportunity 
needs in an effort to support and encourage employees to research their fullest potential in the 
workforce (Hurtienne and Hurtienne, 2023, Hurtienne et al., 2023). The theoretical framework of 
Equity Leadership was originally published in the European Journal Training and Development 
(Huritenne and Hurtienne, 2023). Subsequently, a quantitative research design regarding the 
relationships between equity leadership and employee engagement was published and presented 
at the 2023 University Forum of Human Resource Development (Hurtienne et al., 2023).   
 
Research Purpose  
 
Even though equity leadership has been shown to have a positive relationship to employee 
engagement (Hurtienne et al, 2023) there has not been any formal qualitative study that researched 
at the deep and rich connections between equity leadership and emplo yee engagement. The 
purpose of this study is to further study the effect of equity leadership on employee engagement in 
a professional business setting through a qualitative lens.  
 
Research Question/s  
 
The guiding research question for this constructive qualitative study is: How does the framework of 
Equity Leadership impact employee engagement?  
 
Implications for HRD Practice  
 
The academic and practical fields of HRD look for ways to unleash expertise and improve 
performance. The field is reminded that employees who feel connected and part of the organization 
are more likely to have higher employee engagement, increased retentio n, and perform better 
(Burke 2018, Swanson and Holton 2009, Hurtienne et al. 2021). Even though Equity Leadership has 
shown a positive relationship to employee engagement (Hurtienne et al. 2023), further research is 
needed to better understand this relatio nship by uncovering deep and rich themes. The findings of

145 
this research can be applied to leadership training to help develop and “unleash” leadership traits 
that can improve employee engagement.  
 
Conclusions  
 
What individual employees bring to an organization is central to organizational success; however, 
each employee has the choice to decide how engaged they will be with their current employee. 
According to Saks and Rotman (2006), “individuals who are more en gaged are likely to be in more 
trusting and high -quality relationships with their employer and will, therefore, be more likely to 
report more positive attitudes and intentions toward the organization” (p. 603). If an organization 
wants to hire, engage, and  retain talented employees, a focus must be placed on building a great 
organizational culture (Knierm et al, 2023), and recruiting and developing leaders is a good starting 
point. A previous study showed that leaders can turn to the core concepts of equity  leadership to 
learn about employee’s individual relationships, resources, and opportunity needs as a means of 
improving employee engagement (Hurtienne et al, 2023). Organizations should continue to look for 
ways to understand factors that lead to increase d EE (Huritenne et at. 2021). This study takes aim at 
equity leadership to help further understand how the leadership style impacts employee 
engagement.

ID:93  - The Relationship between Coworker's Impression Management and 
Workplace Deviant Behavior: The Mediation Effect of Malicious Envy and 
Moderated Mediation Effect of Leader Political Skill  
Seokyoung Oh, Jeein Kim  & Ji Hoon Song  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
1. Paper’s importance  
 
Employees implement political actions such as impression management to impress their 
supervisors in order to advance their interests and influence in the organization. Subordinates 
create a good impression among their superiors by appearing to be high perf ormers and engaging 
in organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). When an employee acquires a good image in their 
supervisor’s perception through impression management and receives rewards such as promotion 
and wage increase, other employees may experience  negative emotions such as relative deprivation 
and envy. The supervisor plays an important role in alleviating behaviors resulting from members’ 
negative emotions.  
 
The supervisor should evaluate employees’ performance fairly and provide the same opportunities 
to employees who do not actively engage in impression management so that all employees 
perceive fairness in the organization. This study shows the importance of  using leaders’ political 
skills to create an atmosphere that encourages the maintenance of and cooperation with an 
organization’s ethical climate by alleviating the malicious envy caused by employees who manage 
impressions for personal benefit, thus leadi ng to deviant behavior.  
 
2. Theoretical base  
 
Social comparison between employees occurs frequently within organizations. When an employee 
with a high level of impression management receives positive rewards, other employees may 
perceive the situation as unfair. According to the relative deprivation theory, when individuals 
perceive that they are unfairly disad vantaged through social comparisons, the resulting negative 
emotions lead to negative behaviors such as deviant behavior in the workplace.  
Supervisors with strong political skills have excellent networking abilities, form good relationships 
with subordinates, and have substantial social capital. According to the trait activation theory, an 
individual’s personality traits are activated differe ntly depending on the situational context. 
Therefore, supervisors can use their political skills to moderate negative behaviors by 
communicating with employees and providing social capital to those employees who feel malicious 
envy.  
 
3. Research purpose  
 
This study examines the impact of malicious envy on the relationship between peer impression 
management and workplace deviant behavior. In particular, the authors aim to investigate the role 
of leaders’ political skills in this relationship to provide a ba sis for interventions addressing 
workplace deviant behavior.  
 
4. Research questions  
 
RQ1) What is the relationship between peer impression management and workplace deviant 
behavior?

148 
RQ2) Does malicious envy mediate the relationship between impression management and 
workplace deviant behavior?  
 
RQ3) Do leaders’ political skills moderate the mediating effect of malicious envy in the relationship 
between peer impression management and workplace deviant behavior?  
 
5. Implications for HRD practice  
 
Firstly, it is crucial to underscore the significance of the organization and superiors in enabling 
employees' impression management to foster OCB.  
 
Secondly, organizational resources should be distributed fairly so that employees can perceive the 
fairness of the organization.  
 
Lastly, organizations should implement managerial development and leadership training programs 
to enhance leadership skills and foster effective management.  
 
6. Conclusion  
 
This research contributes to understanding and mitigating workplace deviance by examining 
internal and external factors. It underscores the significance of supervisorial political skills in 
managing negative emotions and behaviors within the organization.

ID:96  - The Latent Profile Analysis on Career Plateau of Employees  
Kyo-Min Nam, Eun -Sil Park, Yun -Jeong Ro  & Ji-Hoon Song  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
1. Paper’s importance  
As the concept of a lifetime job has disappeared, concepts of borderless careers and protean career 
attitudes are emerging within the organization, away from traditional career concepts that are 
vertical and hierarchical. In accordance with this rapidly ch anging work environment, individual 
leading career management and development are becoming important. Interest and effort in a 
career at the individual level are important. However, interest and support at the organizational 
level for the career developmen t of members, who are used as human resources, are also 
important. However, during career development, individuals experience career plateau due to 
pyramid -type organizational structure and intense competition, which is becoming an inevitable 
phenomenon.  
 
A career plateau is defined as a state in which the possibility of promotion to a higher position is 
limited or there is a lack of opportunity to demonstrate competence in the current job. A career 
plateau was a limited concept of being stuck in a particul ar state due to the structurally low 
possibility of promotion. However, the term was expanded to include a state in which the meaning 
and interest in the job decreased due to limited opportunities for challenge in the job.  
This structural and content plateau is both a problem at the individual level and a problem that the 
organization must fix. Members experience career stagnation as career development opportunities 
decrease depending on structural problems and personal char acteristics within the organization. 
Feldman and Weitz (1988) classified the causes of career plateau into individual, job, and 
organizational -level variables. At the individual level, individual skills and abilities, values or low 
growth needs, age, and y ears of service were classified as the causes. At the organizational level, 
lack of external compensation, stress, and deterioration of organizational growth were classified as 
the causes.  
 
Career plateau is generally associated with negative consequences, such as an increase in job 
turnover intention, and is a factor that negatively affects both individuals and organizations, which 
can be a problem for the organization's personnel management . Therefore, it is necessary to 
explore in -depth aspects of each type of career plateau experienced by members of the 
organization due to personal, job, and organizational characteristics and to examine the effect of 
career plateau on outcome factors. Alth ough career plateau can be perceived in various ways within 
an individual due to contextual factors, previous studies have focused on exploring related variables 
using regression analysis rather than focusing on career plateau characteristics and types. Po tential 
profile analysis is a person -centered approach that analyzes individual response patterns to derive 
subtypes. Therefore, it is possible to explore factors that affect career plateau and to identify 
differences in career satisfaction and job satisfa ction levels by potential profile based on the results 
of categorizing career plateau. This will enable us not only to find variables that affect career 
plateau but also to seek strategies and provide implications for career plateau. In particular, 
examini ng the cause and effect factors of career stagnation will not only develop an individual's 
long -term career and plan it through human resource management but also contribute to securing 
the organization's competitiveness and sustainable growth.  
 
2. Theoretical base  
The theoretical foundation of this study involves a detailed review of relevant antecedents 
contributing to the phenomenon of career plateau experienced by organizational members. 
Additionally, a comprehensive examination of the impact of career plateau on  individual job

150 
satisfaction and career satisfaction within the organizational context is intended. This research 
adopts a typological approach to explain career plateau. Feldman and Weitz (1986) proposed six 
antecedents contributing to career plateau, highlighting the co mplex interplay of factors such as 
lack of promotion opportunities, insufficient rewards, individual characteristics, and job -related 
stress. The comprehensive nature of the approach to career plateau aligns with the context and 
objectives of this study. B y presenting practical solutions at both individual and organizational levels 
for each type of career plateau, this paper aims to contribute a foundational basis for realistic 
problem -solving.  
 
3. Research purpose  
The primary objective of this study is to explore the latent profiles of career plateau types among 
organizational members and examine the distinctive characteristics associated with each type. 
Furthermore, the study aims to investigate the relationships b etween relevant variables in the 
career development process and the resolution of career plateau.  
 
4. Research questions  
RQ1: How many latent profiles can be identified based on career plateau among organizational 
members, and what are the distinctive characteristics of each latent profile?  
RQ2: Among individual, organizational, and career factors, which factors significantly influence the 
classification of latent profiles in career plateau?  
RQ3: How do job satisfaction and career satisfaction differ based on latent profiles of career 
plateau?  
 
5. Implications for HRD practice  
First, it will be necessary to prepare an improvement in organizational support awareness by 
creating an open organizational culture, personnel strategy, and career development system that 
can be presented at the organizational level. Second, it is necessary to provide members with a 
sense of psychological well -being through various job participation (TF) opportunities that can 
positively affect members individually. Lastly, it is necessary to provide career development 
opportunities for members through various programs such as professional improvement education 
according to the type of career plateau and leadership education by age/year.  
 
6. Conclusions  
In the career stage, it is important to understand the types of career plateaus of organizational 
members because career plateau not only has a negative impact on job satisfaction and individual 
life satisfaction but also act as a hindrance to organization al performance. The career plateau 
profile identified based on personal factors, organizational factors, and career factors is predicted 
to differ in career satisfaction and job satisfaction. This study differs from previous studies in that it 
explored pot ential profiles according to career plateau and personal characteristic factors in 
relation to job satisfaction and career satisfaction. In addition, it is expected to provide implications 
for establishing customized career development for each job type, h uman resource development, 
education and training, and personnel systems at the organizational level.

ID:101 - Investigating the Relationships among Abusive Supervision, 
Subordinates’ Emotional Exhaustion, Work Engagement, and Cyberloafing  
Chung -Kai Huang, Chun -Yu Lin, Chia -Wen Chang  & Wei-Yuan Lo  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Research Background  
 
With the rapid advancement of internet technology, its unrestricted use becomes an integral part of 
daily life and work. However, the convenience of internet access, while promoting workplace 
flexibility, presents a challenge in the form of cyberloafing. C yberloafing, defined as non -work -
related online activities during working hours, poses significant financial and security risks, 
estimated at around $85 billion in annual losses. Effective leadership is essential for shaping a 
positive social image within organizations, where supervisors’ communication significantly 
influences subordinates’ job performance (Chen, Tsui, & Farh, 2002). Leadership styles play a critical 
role in impacting organizational goals (Bass, 1990), influencing employee behavior, attitud es, and 
overall effectiveness (Steers & Black, 1994; Wagner & Hollenbeck, 2005). In a competitive external 
environment with pressures like heavy workloads, managers may experience frustration, leading to 
abusive supervisory behavior (Zellars, Tepper, & Duf fy, 2002). Negative leadership incurs 
organizational costs (Isen, 1987, 1999), while positive leadership contributes positively (Podsakoff et 
al., 1990; Hirt et al., 1997). Abusive supervision results in negative emotions and withdrawal 
behaviors such as l ateness and poor work attitudes, including cyberloafing. Workplace internet 
deviance (WID) is a prevalent issue impacting organizational operations. Managers seek to control 
cyberloafing as deviant behavior, while employees view it as a means of rest and m otivation 
recovery. Diverse perspectives exist on the impact of cyberloafing.  
 
Severe abusive supervision causes talent loss and negative organizational impacts, leading to 
subordinates displaying adverse actions and emotions, reducing positive behaviors (He, Cai, 2018). 
This results in negative work attitudes and decreased engagemen t (Harter, Schmidt, & Hayes, 2002; 
Schaufeli, Taris, & Van, 2008). High work engagement prompts dedicated efforts, while low 
engagement leads to detrimental behaviors. Positive leadership fosters positive behaviors in 
supervisor -subordinate interactions, a ccording to reciprocal social exchange theory (Liden, & 
Maslyn, 1998).  
 
Problem Statement  
 
This study investigated whether conclusions drawn from existing literature are applicable to the 
military context, filling the gap in research as follows:  
 
1. Abusive supervision has a negative impact on subordinates.  
In organizational hierarchies, abusive supervision can emerge, causing negative repercussions for 
subordinates such as absenteeism and emotional distress. Despite the military’s shift towards 
humane leadership, instances of abusive supervision persist due to task urgency. Severe cases 
negatively affect talent retention and work attitudes. Research highlights emotional instability and 
withdrawal behaviors among abused subordinates. The introduction of smartphones has led to 
cyberloafing during military work hours. This study addresses the gaps in research on military 
impacts and explores the relationships between abusive supervision, emotional exhaustion, work 
engagement, and cyberloafing within militar y organizations.  
 
2. The Importance of Grit for Military Personnel

152 
Positive psychology explores grit, a concept introduced by Professor Duckworth and her team at the 
University of Pennsylvania. Their U.S. military studies reveal that grit reduces negative emotions and 
enhances adaptability (Duckworth et al., 2007; Duckwor th & Quinn, 2009; Duckworth et al., 2011). 
Xiong and Yu’s (2023) study on Taiwanese military academy students shows higher grit correlates 
with better adaptability and emotional well -being. Thus, This study focused on voluntary military 
officers in Taiwan,  examining whether grit moderates the negative impact of abusive supervision on 
subordinates’ feelings and work behaviors, contributing valuable insights.  
 
Research purpose  
 
This study conducted a quantitative study in the Taiwanese military context. We explored the 
impact of abusive supervision on subordinates’ emotional exhaustion, work engagement, and 
cyberloafing. We also examined whether grit moderates the relationships among abusiv e 
supervision and emotional exhaustion. Anticipating that data analysis can validate 
interrelationships, this research contributes to HRD academia and practice.  
 
Hypotheses  
 
H1: Abusive supervision is positively associated with subordinates’ emotional exhaustion.  
H2: Subordinates’ emotional exhaustion is negatively associated with their work engagement.  
H3: Subordinates’ emotional exhaustion is positively associated with their cyberloafing.  
H4: Abusive supervision is negatively associated with subordinates’ work engagement.  
H5: Abusive supervision is positively associated with subordinates’ cyberloafing.  
H6: Emotional exhaustion mediates the relationship between abusive supervision and work 
engagement.  
H7: Emotional exhaustion mediates the relationship between abusive supervision and cyberloafing.  
H8: Grit moderates the positive relationship between abusive supervision and emotional 
exhaustion.  
H9: Grit moderates the mediating effect of emotional exhaustion on the relationship between 
abusive supervision and work engagement.  
H10: Grit moderates the mediating effect of emotional exhaustion on the relationship between 
abusive supervision and cyberloafing.  
 
Theoretical foundation  
 
Based on Resource Conservation Theory and Affective Events Theory, this study examined previous 
literature on abusive supervision, emotional exhaustion, work engagement, cyberloafing, and grit. 
Drawing from existing literature, it is posited that subordina tes experiencing abusive supervision 
may lead to emotional exhaustion, subsequently reducing work engagement and engaging in 
cyberloafing. Furthermore, this study explored the moderating role of grit in the relationship 
between abusive supervision and emot ional exhaustion.  
 
Methodology  
 
This research framework consists of five constructs including abusive supervision and emotional 
exhaustion, work engagement, cyberloafing, and grit. All responses were assessed on a 7 -point 
Likert -type scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree).  
The abusive supervision scale established by Tepper (2000) was designed to measure the extent to 
which employees perceive their supervisors engaging in abusive behaviors. The emotional 
exhaustion scale, initially part of Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), ha s 5 items. Leiter and Schaufeli 
later adapted it into MBI -GS (1996), a reliable and valid tool with three dimensions: emotional 
exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. The Utrecht Work

153 
Engagement Scale, developed by Schaufeli and Bakker (2002), comprises three dimensions: vigor, 
dedication, and absorption. It exists in two versions, the long form (17 items) and the short form (9 
items), validated across various cultural and occupational contexts with good structural validity. This 
study utilized the short form, consisting of 3 items per dimension, totaling 9 questions. The scale 
revised by Blanchard and Henle (2008) is employed, adapted from the questionnaire developed by 
Lim and Chen (20 02). The scale assesses two dimensions: minor (9 items) and severe non -work -
related internet use (8 items). This study employs Duckworth et al.,’s (2007) Grit scale, reduced to 8 
items by Quinn (2009). Assessing perseverance and passion, the modified versi on minimizes 
participant fatigue with 4 positive and 4 negatively phrased items. The Cronbach’s α for the 
reliability of use and acceptance of abusive supervision, emotional exhaustion, work engagement, 
cyberloafing and grit are .91, .87, .93,.87 and .81.  
The data was conducted during one month (August 2023) in Taiwan. Even though 510 online 
surveys were answered, the missing data sections, unavailable and wrong key -in data were taken 
out. In the end a total of 409 samples of online surveys were used for da ta analysis, giving a 
responding rate of 80.1%.  
 
Implications for HRD practice  
 
This study can have several implications for HRD practice. First, the results suggest that the 
promoting correct perspectives among educational supervisors can reduce the occurrence of 
abusive supervision, and reducing cyberloafing behavior can mitigate us age risks.  
Insufficient leadership training for frontline supervisors necessitates practical education like 
communication and leadership workshops. This integration reduces inappropriate supervision 
instances, a common workplace problem with underestimated psychologi cal impacts on 
subordinates. Organizations should prioritize managerial behavior to minimize costs.  
In this study defines work -related internet leisure, cyberloafing. Inappropriate supervision or high 
emotional exhaustion increases such behavior, seen as a means to relax. Widespread smartphone 
use risks leaking confidential data and harming the military’ s image through sharing personal and 
work -related information on social media.  
 
Significance/contribution to the HRD field  
 
As sustainability gains more attention, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) emerges as a 
vital indicator for organizations’ sustainable development. Operating at the organizational level, ESG 
influences ethical practices, social responsibilities, a nd employee engagement. Proactive ESG 
practices establish a robust corporate value system, elevate reputation, and attract top talent. 
Employee engagement, crucial for sustainable human capital development, is emphasized in 
corporate ESG evaluations. Despi te offering more meaningful work, recent trends show a decline in 
employee engagement, prompting the need for effective human resource development (HRD). 
Talent management is pivotal in this competitive era, recognizing employees as the most valuable 
asset . In Taiwan, corporate sustainability involves an effective talent development system. 
Addressing high -tech warfare trends, the Ministry of National Defense’s professionalization policy 
focuses on recruiting and training skilled, long -term volunteers, reco gnizing talent as crucial for 
national military competitiveness (Defense Reports, 2021, 2023).  
In brief, three points can contribute to the HRD field. First, we examined a research framework of 
how abusive supervision influence subordinates’ work attitudes and behaviors through emotional 
exhaustion. Second, this study provides grit research on milit ary aspect to HRD field in Taiwan 
context. Third, future studies are encouraged to expand similar concepts and theories in other 
workplaces or research contexts.

ID:103  - The role of workplace spirituality as a mediator on the influence of 
the Big Five personality traits on work engagement  
Vivat Haetrakul  & Pawinee Petchsawang  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
It is important to recognize the challenges employees and business leaders encounter as a result of 
volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous business environments (McKibbin & Fernando, 2020). 
The persistent issues are still developing and affecting the organization. Researchers and business 
professionals continue to prioritize work engagement as a means of enhancing employee 
performance, well -being, and organizational effectiveness in the face of adversity (Mazzetti et al., 
2021).  
 
According to Kahn (1990), workers are engaged at work when they believe their jobs have a 
purpose, that their employability is secure, and that they have enough resources at their disposal to 
complete their tasks. Employees who are engaged at work exhibit high levels of vigor, commitment, 
and excitement for their jobs. They have a sense of challenge and meaning in their job, are 
engrossed in and engaged in the tasks at hand, and are feeling fulfilled and satisfied (Mazzetti et al., 
2021). Furthermore, emplo yees' perceptions and interpretations of their work lives have an impact 
on their level of work engagement (Shuck et al., 2011). To promote work engagement, many 
researchers suggest that cultivating workplace spirituality would help. Workplace spirituality  refers 
to the concept of bringing spiritual aspects of individuals into the work environment, allowing 
employees to bring their whole selves to work, search for meaning in work, and make 
interconnection with others at work (Ashmos & Duchon, 2000). Spiritu al employees experience 
transcendence, meaningful work with mindfulness, and compassion for others (Petchsawang & 
Duchon, 2009).  
 
Another important individual factor influencing work engagement is personality traits (Kahn, 1990). 
People have different perceptions in life because they hold different personality traits (Cattell, 
1964). Personality traits can be defined as a taxonomy of  five dimensions that capture the 
fundamental aspects of human personality which comprises with openness, conscientiousness, 
extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism or emotional stability so called Big Five (Ji & Esqueda, 
2022). While some researchers  suggested that agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to 
experiences among employees have a higher level of work engagement than other personality 
traits (Hau & Bing, 2018; Shukla et al., 2014), other researchers have revealed different findings 
(Hopwood et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2009; Prieto -Díez et al., 2022). There is a need to verify the 
previous research findings and explore a mechanism that plausible account of the processes that 
cause the relationships. Additionally, it is also intriguing to  look at the relationship between 
personality traits and work engagement and the mediator role of workplace spirituality.  
 
This study aims to address two questions. Is Big Five personality traits an antecedent to workplace 
spirituality and work engagement, and what are the relationships between them? This study falls 
under the post -positivist paradigm. Quantitative methodology , survey method, and structural 
equation modeling will be adopted. This study will benefit the human resources development (HRD) 
field by highlighting the importance of workplace spirituality as a means to enhance work 
engagement, which ultimately enhances  employee performance, well -being, and organizational 
effectiveness.

ID:113  - Work -Life Balance, Work Engagement, and Job Satisfaction Among 
Generation Z Employees in Morocco  
Hiba Afakkir, Khaoula El Fellahi  & Jeong -Ha Yim  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
As technological advancements accelerate and many parts of our work and lives become digitalized, 
we are experiencing both benefits and losses. For example, while workers are given many 
opportunities for continuous learning and efficient work through techn ological support and 
automation, they suffer from the stress of responding to the rapid pace of technological and 
environmental changes. Additionally, as remote work has become more popular since the 
pandemic, technology has blurred the boundaries between work and life. This phenomenon 
suggests that HRD should pay more attention to employees' work -life balance in this digital age and 
strive to increase work engagement and job satisfaction.  
 
Work -life balance (WLB) is the healthy equilibrium between work, play, and love that makes 
individuals productive (Kofodimos, 1993). It is linked to employee job and life satisfaction and is 
seen as a rewarding experience that requires proper distribution of personal resources (Clark, 
2000). Job satisfaction (JS) encompasses emotional alignment with one's career, contentment with 
compensation, and positive emotional responses to work tasks (Locke, 1969). Work Engagement 
(WE) is critical to obtain job satisf action and is characterized by enthusiasm, commitment, and deep 
absorption (Schaufeli & Bakker, 2004). WE has three dimensions: vigor, dedication, and absorption.  
Numerous studies on the relationship between WLB, JS, and WE exist. Among them, many studies, 
especially focusing on millennials who have experienced both the pros and cons of digitalization 
(Gabrielova & Buchko, 2021), highlight the importance of this topic in the workplace. According to 
recent studies, there is a positive causal relationship between WLB and  JS (Susanto et al., 2022), and 
some components of WLB and WE (Jaharuddin & Zainol, 2019), and a positive relationship between 
WE and JS (Garg, Dar, & Mishra, 2018). However, there are few studies linking these three variables 
simultaneously. Also, because  existing studies have focused on millennials, there is a lack of 
research on Generation Z, who are currently entering the workplace.  
 
This study aims to investigate the relationship between WLB, JS, and WE among Generation Z 
employees in Moroccan organizational settings. The research questions are as follows:  
1) What is the relationship between (each dimension of) WLB and JS?  
2) What is the relationship between WLB and WE?  
3) What is the relationship between WE and JS?  
4) Does WE mediate the relationship between WLB and JS?  
 
The data will be collected through a survey. The sample is 250 Gen Z employees working for more 
than one year in a Moroccan organization. Data will be analyzed using SPSS. Linear regression will 
be used to identify the relationship between the variables. A dditionally, bootstrapping techniques 
will be used to test the mediating role of WE.    
 
This study will advance our understanding of Gen Z, who, along with millennials, will become the 
majority of workers in the digital age. In addition, the study is expected to show the relationship 
between the three variables WLB, JS, and WE more clearly. F inally, this study will expand the breadth 
of HRD empirical research by adding the Moroccan organizational context, which is lacking in the 
existing literature.

ABSTRACT  
 
Reio, Jr. once stated, “The direct and indirect costs of incivility to a society or a culture can be 
substantial” (2011, p. 54). The cumulative effect of workplace incivility affects individual, team, and 
organizational performance (Estes and Wang, 2008). Incivility at work is part of a toxic continuum 
leading to violence (Ghosh, Dierkes and Falletta, 2011). One need only look at recent headlines to 
see the shocking violence that has gripped our world. We seem to have a particular predilection for 
violence as a way to express frustration. Hate crimes can be considered as a form of workplace 
violence (Jacobs and Scott, 2011). Now seems to be a suitable time to take a look at the origins of 
such behavior.  
 
HRD scholars began studying incivility around 2008 -2011, but its roots go back further than that in 
the management literature. Moreover, incivility and workplace bullying have evolved to 
cyberbullying in the workplace (Escartin et al., 2021; Piotrowski, 20 12). By investigating the history of 
the study of toxic behavior, we should gain new insights into the violence of today’s headlines, as 
well as implications for HRD research and practice today.  
 
This paper introduces the topics of workplace incivility, bullying, and cyberbullying and defines the 
terms and constructs for these topics. It reviews the history of incivility and workplace violence in 
the two decades from 1980 -2000. It then reviews the most recent toxic continuum of incivility to 
workplace bullying and cyberbullying to workplace violence and hate crimes in the last few years.  
The paper also discusses a theoretical framework for incivility. Andersson and Pearson (1999) 
defined workplace incivility as “low -intensity deviant behavior with ambiguous intent to harm the 
target, in violation of workplace norms for mutual respect. Unci vil behaviors are characteristically 
rude and discourteous, displaying lack of regard for others” (p. 457). Schilpzand et al. (2016) 
described this as a social interactionist theory and provided two other options for a unifying 
theoretical framework for in civility theory (see page S81). Another possible theory is affective events 
theory (Weiss and Cropanzano, 1996), which is similar to Tracy and Robins’ (2006) appraisal model 
of self -conscious emotions, the theoretical framework utilized by Miranda, Welbour ne and Sariol 
(2020) in their study measuring shame and guilt in observers of workplace incivility. Eversole and 
Graham (2012) suggested Goffman’s stigma theory to explain the instigator’s affect. Miner et al. 
(2018) also suggested more avenues for theoret ical expansion.  
 
Workplace bullying goes further and actually creates a toxic environment that impedes the learning 
and development of employees (Reio Jr. and Ghosh, 2009). Similar to incivility, the interactionist 
framework (Samnani and Singh, 2016) theorizes that bullyin g has impacts beyond the individual 
affected to work groups and the organizational system itself. Valentine, Giacalone, and Fleischman 
(2021) found that workplace bullying indeed leads to mistrust of others and a political view of jobs, 
leading to decrease d work group effectiveness and ultimately decreased organizational 
effectiveness.  
 
Finally, the paper discusses implications for research and practice. Implications for research include 
antecedents and mediating variables associated with emotions, personality, intersectionality and 
uncivil behavior and the association between incivility and hate crimes. Implications for practice 
include training & development programs, organization development cultural change efforts, and 
performance management to monitor behavior and arrange consequences.

ID:122  - Development of the Work Characteristics Inventory -12 
Wesley B. Wilson  & Kim Nimon  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This study introduces an inventory of 12 single -item measures of employees’ perceptions of the 
characteristics of work, organized around three domains: the host organization, the people 
involved, and the job itself.  
 
Employee engagement has been conflated and potentially misinterpreted throughout the literature 
(Kaufman et al. 2020; Schaufeli 2014) leading some researchers to examine antecedents of 
engagement at the lowest levels, beginning with employees’ cognition of  work characteristics 
(Zigarmi et al. 2011).  
 
Research details the effects of employees’ perceptions of their working conditions as antecedents to 
intentions and consequential behaviors (e.g., Zigarmi et al. 2009; Nimon et al. 2011). While several 
factors intervene this relationship, this path of perc eption to intention is significant in the 
overarching concept of employee engagement (Shuck et al. 2017). In the digital age filled with social 
media, online employer reviews, quiet -quitting, and other disruptions to the traditional employee -
employer relat ionship, researchers have suggested organizations may benefit from measuring 
indicators of engagement and satisfaction regularly using Pulse Surveys (Bakker 2014; Brown 2022).  
  
Increased frequency of assessment and advances in digital survey deployment (e.g. SMS, West et al. 
2015; mobile web, Toepoel and Lustig 2022) necessitate reducing the length of instruments. Shorter 
scales decrease response burden and increase administratio n convenience. Many widely -accepted 
instruments have been shortened (e.g., Utrecht Work Engagement Scale; UWES -3, Schaufeli et al. 
2019). Matthews, Pineault, and Hong (2022) advocated for the use of single -item instruments in 
behavioral science research an d provided a framework for the development of such measures.  
 
Acknowledging the need for short instruments to measure facets of employee engagement, the 
purpose of this study is to develop and validate the 12 -item Work Characteristics Inventory (WCI -12), 
consisting of single -item measures of employees’ perception of:  Organizational Characteristics 
(Distributive Justice, DJ; Growth, GR; Performance Expectations, PE; Procedural Justice, PJ); People 
Characteristics (Collaboration, CO; Connectedness with Colleagues, CC; Connectedness with Leader, 
CL; Feedback, FB); and Jo b Characteristics (Autonomy, AU; Meaningful Work, MW; Task Variety, TV; 
and Workload Balance, WB). Following the process introduce by Matthews et al. (2022), we test the 
following hypotheses:  
 
H1: WCI -12 demonstrates empirically acceptable definitional correspondence with the measured 
constructs.  
H2: WCI -12 demonstrates empirically acceptable test -retest reliability.  
H3: WCI -12 correlates to longer validated scales measuring the same constructs.  
H4: Outcomes predicted by the WCI -12 correlate with outcomes predicted by longer validated scales 
measuring the same constructs.  
 
To test, we develop a series of instruments in Qualtrics deployed to participants sampled from 
Prolific. H1 requires participants to rate the degree which the proposed items match the constructs’ 
definitions with .60 representing acceptable correspondence.  H2 incorporates a between -person 
experimental design with three groups responding across three temporal conditions (Matthews 
2022). An ICC greater than .40 demonstrates support. H3 is tested by correlating scale scores of 
Nimon and Zigarmi’s Work Cognitio ns Inventory -Revised (WCI -R, 2015a) to the related scores

160 
proposed in the WCI -12. Finally, H4 compares the regression effects of the proposed WCI -12 on 
Nimon and Zigarmi’s Work Intentions Inventory -Short Form (2015b) to effects of the WCI -R on the 
same intentions.

ID:132  - The Impact of Technological Change on Workers: Opportunities and 
Challenges  
Travor Brown, Bui Petersen, Judah Adeniyi  & Ray Gosine  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Importance  
 
Technological change has dramatically transformed the world of work in recent years and is 
expected to continue to do so (Halvorson, 2023; Patel, 2022). Thus, it is important to explore, as we 
do in this study: (1) the impact of technological change on workers; and (2) opportunities, barriers, 
and equity in a time of technological a nd economic transformation.  
Theoretical Base  
We employed an equity theory lens (Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2011; Huseman, Hatfield & Miles, 1987). 
In the context of technological change and the changing nature of work, applying equity theory 
helped us understand the disparities in workers’ experiences with technological change and 
provided insights into how the adoption of technologies may affect perceptions of fairness in the 
workplace.  
  
Research Purpose  
 
We conducted a qualitative, exploratory study to explore the perceptions and experiences of a 
diverse sample of workers regarding the impact of technological change on workers. Semi -
structured interviews (N=11) were conducted with participants from a varie ty of industries and 
representatives from different diversity -focused stakeholder groups.  
 
Research Questions  
 
1.What are the equity gaps that exist due to a changing technological work environment?  
2.What are the opportunities and challenges that workers experience due to technological change?  
  
Implications for HRD practice  
 
Participants viewed technological change as both a threat and an opportunity. Some participants 
expressed concerns about job displacement and the difficulty of keeping up with rapidly evolving 
technology. Others saw technological change as an opportunity f or job enhancement and the 
creation of new, technologically -based jobs.  
 
In terms of the skills and knowledge required for future work, participants identified the need for 
adaptability, flexibility, and a willingness to continuously learn and upskill. Participants also cited the 
impact of the pandemic on advancing technologica l change in their workplaces. In particular, the 
sudden shift to remote work, and the need for organizations to continue operations in the face of 
lockdowns/healthcare directives, accelerated the adoption of new technologies and transformed 
the way work is  done.  
 
Participants further identified potential equity issues that arise from technological change in the 
workplace. This included the digital divide, with some population groups having less access to 
technology.

162 
Thus, this study offers significant implications for HRD practice. Participants stressed the 
importance of workplace training and education programs, as well as clear communication and 
transparency from employers concerning the impact of technological chan ge on job security and 
future job opportunities. In so doing, this study offers insights and provides valuable suggestions on 
how employers and policymakers can support workers through technological change.  
 
Conclusion  
 
Our findings highlight the complex and nuanced nature of technological change on workers and the 
changing nature of work. Participants view technological change as both a challenge and an 
opportunity and emphasize the need for adaptability, continuous lear ning, and support from 
employers and policymakers. Our results can inform efforts to prepare and support workers for the 
challenges and opportunities related to a rapidly changing technological environment, while also 
providing equity -related insights.

ID:133  - Multigenerational coexistence: perceptions of the public servants 
from Universidade Federal Fluminense through the lens of the generation Y  
Clarice Rodrigues Pinheiro, Mauro Gonçalves Camara, Américo da Costa 
Ramos Filho  & Maria Carolina Martins Rodrigues  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
In an era marked by dynamic and unpredictable changes, organizations face the challenge of 
adapting to shifting scenarios. This study delves into demographic transformations, with a specific 
focus on the Brazilian landscape, where the aging of the populati on has become increasingly 
pronounced. Recent data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) 
underscores a persistent aging trend, indicating a notable increase in the average age of the 
Brazilian population by six years since 2010, r eaching 35 years in 2022. Moreover, the elderly 
population, aged 60 or older, has surged to represent 15.6% of the overall demographic, marking a 
significant 56% increase from 2010.  
 
In response to these demographic shifts, the Brazilian government, under President Bolsonaro in 
2019, implemented a comprehensive pension reform. The rationale behind this reform, as reported 
by the Senate, was directly linked to the aging population and the resultant strain on the pension 
system. Th ese demographic shifts have profound implications not only for societal structures but 
also for organizational dynamics, necessitating a recalibration of public policies and the introduction 
of awareness programs to address emerging challenges such as agei sm. There are various versions 
regarding the categories related to these generations. One of them, generation Y, the focus of this 
study, comprises individuals between 30 and 45 years old, approximately.  
 
A critical dimension of these changes is the increasing coexistence of multiple generations in the 
workplace.. The need to foster a harmonious organizational climate, characterized by employees 
working collaboratively towards positive outcomes, underscores  the significance of acknowledging 
multigenerational dynamics as a catalyst for enrichment. This recognition becomes particularly 
pertinent in an era where diversity and inclusion are central themes.  
 
Navigating interactions among individuals within an organizational setting is already a complex task, 
compounded further when considering generational differences. The public sector, where stability 
often results in individuals working in the same environm ent throughout their contributory years, 
amplifies this interaction, given the regularity of public service examinations over the years.  
The study is situated at the Federal Fluminense University, located in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
Established in 1960, the institution boasts academic units in Niterói and eight other municipalities in 
the state. As of 2020, the university accommodat ed approximately 57,600 active students across on -
site and distance learning programs, along with 7,540 teaching and administrative staff dispersed 
across 45 educational units.  
 
Contextualizing our thematic focus, the research aims to answer the question: "How is 
multigenerational coexistence perceived at the Federal Fluminense University by Generation Y 
employees?" The specific objective is to obtain relevant insights into the interaction between 
generations within the  public service environment, particularly from the perspective of Generation 
Y. This generation plays a pivotal role in bridging older and younger cohorts, embodying a unique 
position in the generational spectrum. Also, the choice os this generation was du e to the availability 
of more individuals in this age group for participation in the research, without invalidating the 
perception of other generations, which is intended to be investigated in future studies.

164 
The article unfolds across seven sections: an introductory overview, a narrative review of scientific 
contributions related to the proposed theme, a detailed exposition of research methods, 
presentation and analysis of research findings from 15 public serv ants at Federal Fluminense 
University, a discussion section synthesizing the earlier results, conclusion and limitations of the 
study, and finally, a comprehensive list of essential references.  
 
The results, emanating from thematic analysis, categorize diverse dimensions: the work 
environment's harmony and conflicts, perspectives on generational differences, the impact of 
technology on work, responses to the challenges posed by the pandemic and re mote work, and 
strategies for fostering a harmonious multigenerational environment.  
 
Analyzing these findings against the backdrop of the upcoming congress themes yields intriguing 
connections. Initiatives for innovative worker engagement surface organically, intertwined with the 
discussion on harmonious work environments and the acknowled gment of generational diversity. 
The effectiveness of such engagement becomes apparent in the perceived harmony at the 
workplace and the interconnectedness of worker satisfaction.  
 
The intricate interplay between worker engagement and organizational culture is illuminated by the 
discussion on respect, communication, and collaboration among different generations. As the 
research participants express their willingness to contribute to a more inclusive and harmonious 
workplace, they inherently address the core elements of fostering an organizational culture that 
values diversity and respects individual contributions.  
 
The impact of technology on worker engagement, a focal point in the research, resonates with the 
broader theme of understanding how technological advancements influence worker commitment. 
The challenges and opportunities presented by technology, as discuss ed by Generation Y 
employees, shed light on the nuanced relationship between technological integration and 
multigenerational work dynamics.  
 
In essence, this comprehensive exploration of multigenerational coexistence at the Federal 
Fluminense University not only enriches our understanding of Generation Y perspectives but also 
provides valuable insights aligned with the broader congress themes. The findings underscore the 
complexity of managing generational diversity in the contemporary workplace, necessitating 
strategic approaches for effective integration. Strategies encompassing comprehensive training 
programs and initiatives fostering continu ous learning emerge as crucial for facilitating a seamless 
transition amidst technological changes.  
 
As we reflect on the convergence between theoretical frameworks and research outcomes, the 
study advocates for nuanced strategies that recognize the distinct needs and strengths of different 
generations. The recognition of these dynamics provides a solid f oundation for practical 
recommendations and management strategies discussed in theoretical frameworks. This alignment 
suggests that theoretical frameworks are reflective of the workplace reality investigated, offering a 
robust basis for practical recommend ations and management strategies outlined in the theoretical 
framework.  
 
In conclusion, the study demonstrates the intricate dynamics of multigenerational coexistence, 
offering pragmatic insights for managing the ever -evolving workplace. This comprehensive 
exploration encompasses theoretical and practical implications, paving t he way for reflections on 
innovative initiatives, effectiveness assessments, and the promotion of inclusive environments 
within the context of generational coexistence.

ID:137  - Learning from Social Relationships, Organizational Commitment, and 
Job Involvement in Early Careers: The Mediating Role of Meaningful Work  
Jihyun Chang, Seonghye Kim  & Cho Hyun Park  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Importance  
Work is at the center of a person’s life, though the perception of its centrality can be subjective 
(Budd, 2011). When individuals perceive that their work is meaningful in their lives, the benefits 
extend beyond the personal level, positively impacting th e workplace and organization. This has led 
to the need to identify ways to support workers in finding meaning in their work and create a 
workplace environment in which employees experience meaningful work (MW). Thus, it is important 
for HRD to help employe es perceive their work as meaningful, fostering the growth of both 
employees and the organization.  
 
Research Purpose  
This study aims to explore how HRD can create a workplace where early -career employees can 
experience their work as meaningful, with a focus on learning from social relationship (LSR), which 
promotes meaningful work (MW), and organizational commitment (OC)  and job involvement (JI) as 
the outcomes of meaningfulness.  
 
Theoretical Base  
Meaningful work is defined as “work that is personally significant and worthwhile” (Lysova et al., 
2019, p. 375). Studies on MW explore how individuals percieve and relate to their work and how this 
relationship influences their life, work, and workplace ( Rosso et al., 2010). MW can be promoted by 
various factors such as leadership (Lee et al., 2017; Tummers & Knies, 2013), organizational culture 
(Cardador & Rupp, 2011; Sorakraikitikul & Siengthai, 2014), HR policies (Albrecht et al., 2015; 
Fletcher, 2019),  and positive interactions among employees (Grant, 2007; Kahn, 2007). Especially, an 
organizational learning culture, in which open and supportive communication and interaction are 
promoted (Watkins & Marsick, 1993), enables employees to experience positiv e meaning in their 
work (Lysova et al., 2019) and establish positive attitudes towards their organization and job, such 
as commitment to the organization (Song et al., 2013) and job involvement (Brown, 1996). When 
employees feel significant in their work w ithin an organizational environment in which learning 
from social relationships (LSR) is supported, they are likely to have a high level of commitment to 
organization because they perceive their contributions as meaningful (Steger et al., 2012). Thus, this  
study developed the following hypotheses.  
 
Research Questions/Hypotheses  
H1: LSR is positively related to MW.  
H2: LSR is positively related to affective commitment and JI.  
H3: MW works as mediating role between LSR and OC or JI.  
 
Methodology  
We gathered date on LSR (Yang et al., 2004), OC (Meyer & Allen, 1991), JI (Kanungo, 1982), MW 
(Steger et al., 2012). Using the data obtained from 286 early -career employees in South Korea, we 
analyzed the correlation between variables and conducted the three -step regression analysis 
(Baron & Kenny, 1986) to verify the mediating effect.

166 
Implications for HRD Practice and Conclusion  
Our findings indicated that LSR significantly affected MW of early -career employees, and MW 
positively mediated the relation between LSR and OC and JI. Thus, management and leadership 
efforts are needed to focus on fostering LSR for early -career workers’ M W, OC and JI. Additionally, 
enhancing OC and JI should involve promoting intrinsic motivation and meaning in the work 
experiences of early -career workers.

ID:149  - Job-Crafting and Work Engagement in Flexible Work Arrangements: A 
Review for HRD Implications  
Kyung Nam Kim, Hyerim Cho, Shyamal Pandya  & Yob Ha  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Significance  
The importance of studying job -crafting and work engagement has increased due to the evolving 
needs of today's workforce. This shift is evident with nearly 50% of U.S. employees now voluntarily 
changing jobs, compared to about 40% a decade ago (U.S. Bureau  of Labor Statistics, 2009, 2022). 
The COVID -19 pandemic's impact on work norms, such as remote work, has highlighted the need 
for ensured performance in a dynamic world. As a result, there is a heightened focus on how job -
crafting enhances work engagement , especially with flexible work models, including remote and 
hybrid work (Wijngaards et al., 2022).  
 
Job-crafting enables individuals to reshape their work's meaning and tasks (Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 
2001), specifically for those in flexible work environments. Meanwhile, work engagement refers to a 
positive, fulfilling, work -related state of mind characte rized by vigor, dedication, and absorption 
(Schaufeli et al., 2002). Research suggests job -crafting enhances engagement along with perceived 
work meaningfulness and performance (Lee & Lee, 2018) and benefits organizations by boosting 
commitment and prosoci al behaviors (Wang et al., 2018).  
Therefore, exploring the previous discussion on job -crafting and work engagement from Human 
Resource Development (HRD) perspectives with a focus on flexible working conditions can help 
address the concerns of individual employees and organizations. Despite  the obvious relationships, 
there is a lack of inquiry regarding how these impacts provide insights for HRD. Consequently, this 
review gains greater significance for both individual and organizational success.  
 
Research Purpose and Questions  
To explore job -crafting and work engagement among employees with flexible work arrangements, 
and building upon previous studies on these topics, we formulated three research questions:  
 
1. How have job -crafting and work engagement for employees in flexible work arrangements 
been studied?  
2. What is the relationship between job -crafting and work engagement in flexible work 
arrangements?  
3. What implications for HRD can be drawn from the existing literature?  
 
Research Method  
We apply the integrative review approach that allows researchers to comprehensively analyze and 
synthesize existing literature (Toracco, 2005; Whittemore & Knafl, 2005). By integrating key findings 
identified from relevant studies, we capture the relations hips between employee job -crafting and 
work engagement in flexible work arrangements and gain insights for HRD. We follow the literature 
screening process suggested by Toracco (2005).  
 
Implications for HRD Practice  
This review examines how integrating job -crafting and work engagement in flexible work 
arrangements can improve HRD practices, focusing on enhancing performance and reducing 
turnover intentions (Seppälä et al., 2020). The findings underscore the importance of HRD 
professionals supporting job -crafting to elevate work engagement at individual and team levels. The 
insights offer guidance for achieving beneficial outcomes for individuals, teams, and organizations.

169 
Conclusion  
This review emphasizes the interplay between job -crafting and work engagement among 
employees in flexible work settings, enhancing our understanding of these dynamics and providing 
insights for better HRD interventions and future opportunities. It strongly urges HRD researchers 
and practitioners to further investigate this dynamic within organizational contexts.

ID:151  - The Role of Meaningful Work in Work -Life Balance: Review and 
Summary  
Eun-Jee Kim  & Sunyoung Park  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Meaningful work has been noted as a crucial subject within the context of human resource 
development, given its positive relationships with personal growth, employee engagement, and 
work -life balance. By providing a sense of purpose and identity, meaningful work has been 
proposed as a mechanism for work -to-life enrichment. However, the extant literature presents a 
lack of empirical studies on the relationship between work meaningfulness and work -life balance. 
As a critical step towards future empirical research, we conducted a lite rature review to understand 
the interrelated dimensions of work meaningfulness and work -life constructs. This review classifies 
the current research landscape of the meaningful work and work -life constructs, elucidating the 
ensuing implications for HRD res earch and practice. As a working paper, we also clarify the 
pathways through which meaningful work impacts work -life constructs and propose future research 
directions.

ID:155  - Activating Leadership: A conduit for advancing Employee Experience 
mechanisms deployment in Organisational Employee Engagement Narratives  
Leemon Choudhury  & Adetola Adekunle  
 
ABSTRACT  
Large bodies of literature have demonstrated the business value employee engagement (EE) 
provides organisations (Gifford and Young, 2021) such as engaged employees being more likely to 
behave in positive, cooperative ways to benefit the firm and themselves  (Acas, 2010). However, 
recent data shows that EE levels are plummeting due to number of factors such as competitive war 
for talent increasing (Mercer, 2019), multi -generational working (i.e. up to 4 generations working 
side by side Plaskoff, 2017), techno logical disruptions such as the use of AI in task completion and 
an increased need for employee wellbeing post Covid -19 (Tucker, 2020). Thus, this brings to sharp 
focus on the need for employees to be seen as consumers in the workplace with the option of 
choice. Thus, the need to explore antecedents of EE cannot be overemphasised in ensuring global 
EE levels are improved (Morgan, 2017).  
 
A key term Employee Experience (EX) is one such key antecedent. Affiliated to EE, EX s taking a 
greater foothold especially among HR practitioners within the profession (Deloitte, 2017). With a 
2020 LinkedIn Talent report highlighting an increased 240% usa ge of the term by members who 
cited EX in their job titles (Bridger and Gannaway, 2021) thus indicating an increased focus on this 
subject/discipline by greater majority of practitioners. This is further strengthened with the 
Chartered Institute of Personn el Development (CIPD) integrating employee experience as a 
specialist knowledge category in their professional standards (CIPD 2021; CIPD 2023).  Additionally, 
Panneerselvam and Balaraman (2022) suggested that employee experience is increasing its 
footprin t in HR practice for reasons due to continuous technological advancement and increased 
importance of Wellbeing in workspaces post Covid -19. 
 
Based on a 2023 qualitative study conducted within Company X (a multinational energy 
organisation and a top five global largest company in the world by revenue) with over 70,000 global 
workforce. Eleven HR Business Partners practitioners were sampled using  semi -structured 
interviews from a population of 39, representing a large demographic base, range of the company 
eight business lines as well as nationalities and an additional interview with an external industry 
expert to compare findings with regional an d global trends. All sampled HR Business Partners are 
highly experienced practitioners with key role duties comprising stewardship of the company’s 
talent and performance cycles and employee engagement response plans.  
 
Our study outcomes suggested that ‘activating leadership’ which is an act of creating needed 
awareness and sense of responsibility on the part of company leaders at all levels is a crucial 
enabler to the successful deployment of EX strategy mechanisms which is an antecedent for EE. 
Participants asserted that activating leadership spectrum of interventions should include 
measurable actions such as senior management role -modelling, training, communications, and 
integrating employee engagement as a mechanism to reward and promot e leaders. The later can 
be done by embedding EX outcomes in each leader’s KPI’s and performance goals.

ID:165  - Post, Connect and Retain: The Use of social media as an Employee 
Engagement Strategy in the Healthcare Industry  
Tarinni Karak  & Cindy L. Crowder  
 
ABSTRACT  
In today's highly competitive market, industries including healthcare are increasingly concerned 
about retaining employees (Anderlini, 2018). Employee retention has long been a priority for HR 
managers as it is crucial to the success of any business and re lates to strategies aimed at 
maintaining a stable workforce. Retaining skilled and experienced employees ensures that 
companies have capable staff while also boosting morale and motivation (Anderlini, 2018).  
Employee retention in the healthcare industry in the United States has posed significant challenges 
with turnover rates estimated between 20% and 30% over the past decade (Colosi, 2022). Factors 
contributing to this issue include lengthy working hours, hig h stress levels, burnout, lack of work -life 
balance along with shortages of qualified professionals creating a competitive job market.  
The turnover of healthcare professionals such as nurses comes with considerable costs averaging 
$22,000 per replacement due to factors like training time for new hires and decreased productivity 
(McHugh et al., 2011). Extensive research has been conducted on this topic; however, findings have 
been inconsistent. Singh & Loncar (2010) discovered that compensation and benefits may not 
always be sufficiently competitive for employee retention within healthcare whereas Baker & Sutner 
(2022) disagreed with this p erspective.  
 
Theoretical Framework  
A sense of belonging is one of several human needs outlined by Maslow (1943) as a powerful 
motivator of human behavior. He believed that individuals were unable to pursue their full potential 
until they had satisfied basic needs of safety, belonging, and esteem, and if those needs we re met, 
individuals were better equipped mentally to grow. Rosenberg and McCullough (1981) stated sense 
of belonging is a feeling of connectedness, that one is important or matters to others. Baumeister 
and Leary (1995) argued that people have a “pervasive  drive to form and maintain at least a 
minimum quantity of lasting, positive, and significant interpersonal relationships” (p. 497), and 
lacking fulfillment of this need results in significant decrements to well -being.  
Maslow (1998) also suggested that if belongingness could be applied to individual’s educational 
achievements, belongingness in the work environment could also influence employees and their 
relationship to one’s work. Among employees, belongingness is a rec iprocal relationship that 
provides a feeling that employees matter to each other and their needs will be met through that 
relationship (McMillan & Chavis, 1986). Within organizations, each employee benefits from being 
part of the organization, and the orga nization benefits from the contributions of each employee.  
In order to retain employees effectively, organizations must convey a sense of belongingness and 
value. This can be achieved by creating a perception of unity within the organization where 
everyone works together towards shared success. Organizational cult ure can indirectly impact 
employee retention as well. When employees feel like they fit into the culture, it creates a sense of 
belonging and fosters strong emotional ties between them and the organization. Furthermore,  
when workers believe that their employer values and appreciates them, they are more inclined to 
remain loyal.  
 
Purpose  
Existing employee retention strategies in healthcare include competitive salaries and benefits, 
training, and development, fostering a positive work environment, and offering flexible work 
arrangements and telecommuting options. However, the problem persis ts. To address these 
concerns, this study aimed to identify new strategies for employee retention in healthcare by 
determining the key factors important to healthcare employees, identifying effective retention

173 
programs specifically for the healthcare sector, and assessing current practices in implementing 
retention initiatives in the field. Specifically, the researchers examined how leveraging social media, 
particularly TikTok and Instagram could serve as an emp loyee retention strategy for nurse 
practitioners in the healthcare industry.  
 
Social media has emerged as a powerful tool that is being used for branding, marketing etc. by 
many industries to create a presence. With millions of people actively using social media platforms 
like TikTok, Instagram, and LinkedIn, these platforms offer a  unique opportunity for healthcare 
organizations to connect with their employees, engage them, and ultimately retain them. The use of 
social media as an employee retention strategy has gained considerable attention in recent years, 
particularly in industri es such as healthcare where employee turnover and burnout were prevalent. 
With work life balance getting more and more difficult to attain, healthcare workers are often left 
with the feeling disconnected from both their colleagues and their workplaces. Thi s lack of 
connection can have detrimental effects on their job satisfaction, overall well -being, and even 
patient outcomes. However, social media platforms have the potential to bridge this gap and create 
a sense of community among healthcare employees. Re search questions included:  
 
1. How does the use of social media contribute to employee retention in the healthcare industry?  
2. How does the implementation of social media promote a sense of belonging among nurse 
practitioners in the healthcare industry?  
 
Implication for practice in HRD  
One significant aspect of using social media in healthcare settings is the opportunity it provides 
employees to connect with one another (Mulauzi, 2018). Traditional work structures often hinder 
interaction between different departments and shifts, leading  to limited opportunities for 
meaningful connections within the organization. By utilizing social media platforms, healthcare 
workers can easily establish connections with colleagues they may not interact with on a regular 
basis. This leads to increased co llaboration, knowledge sharing, and an overall sense of belonging 
within the organization.  
 
The results of the study revealed that nurse practitioners perceived social media as a valuable tool 
for employee retention. It proved to be a valuable tool that can be harnessed to improve employee 
retention for nurse practitioners, particularly for trave ling nurses, promoting a sense of work -life 
balance, and helping nurses access additional compensation through brand deals. In addition, the 
ability to connect and engage with colleagues, share knowledge and best practices, and seek 
support and advice from  a wider network were identified as key advantages. Nurse practitioners 
highlighted how social media platforms allowed them to build relationships, both professionally and 
personally, fostering a sense of belonging and community within the healthcare indus try (Dewanto 
& Wardhani, 2018).  
 
Belongingness is essential for individuals, including healthcare employees, to feel connected and 
engaged in their work (Wu, 2013). Social media platforms play a crucial role in fostering this sense of 
belonging by allowing healthcare professionals to shar e their experiences, challenges, and 
successes, creating trust and unity among colleagues (Wu, 2013).  
Additionally, social media provides an outlet for healthcare workers to decompress from the high -
stress nature of their job. By discussing their day -to-day experiences with like -minded peers who 
understand the unique demands of the profession on these plat forms can be highly therapeutic 
(Wu, 2013). Moreover, by sharing stories and experiences on social media platforms like Twitter or 
LinkedIn helps them learn from one another giving insights into different areas within the field 
while also discovering innov ative approaches to patient care.

174 
Furthermore, using social media in healthcare allows professionals to create a global community 
beyond physical workplace boundaries. It enables connection with colleagues worldwide facilitating 
collaboration on research projects; sharing best practices le ads establishing mentorship 
relationships which promote personal growth too (Cao et al., 2021). Additionally serving as a 
platform for showcasing achievements celebrating milestones not just individual but recognition 
towards contributions made by fellow m edical practitioners.  
 
Conclusion  
The findings of this study aligned with existing literature on the benefits of social media in employee 
retention efforts. Research had shown that social media could enhance employer branding and 
improve talent acquisition, as it allowed organizations to s howcase their positive workplace culture 
and attract potential candidates. Additionally, employees who utilized social media for work -related 
purposes had been found to be more engaged and satisfied in their roles (McHugh et al., 2011). By 
embracing social  media as an employee retention strategy, human resource practitioners in 
healthcare organizations can create a stronger sense of community and improve communication 
among their workforce, ultimately leading to increased retention rates and a more stable a nd 
motivated workforce.

ID:169  - Exploratory Approach to Conceptualising and Exploring the Meaning 
of Employee Engagement  
Oluwole  Shokunbi  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
INTRODUCTION  
Previous research has revealed that employee engagement has several meanings in different 
contexts (Little &Little, 2006; Shuck, 2011; Shokunbi, 2016), which has led to the emergence of 
different measuring tools measuring employee engagement from different perspectives (e.g., 
Harter et al, 2002; Kahn, 1990; Schaufeli et al, 2002; Saks, 2006; Shokunbi, 2016). Employee 
engagement has been referred to as involvement, commitment, passion, absorption, enthusiasm, 
dedic ation, zeal, and even energy. This underlines the strong division between practitioners and 
researchers as to whether the concept is “employee engagement” or “work engagement.” This lack 
of a generally acceptable definition for the concept has been attribu ted to how the popularity of the 
employee engagement quickly manifested in the practitioner community with much focus on the 
related positive outcomes as against clearly conceptualising the term Macey and Schneider, 2008).  
 
THEORETICAL BASE  
This study attempts to understand and conceptualise employee engagement from the perspectives 
of both HRD/M practitioners and researchers. Severally, HRD/M practitioners and researchers have 
consistently avoid defining employee engagement in their differen t studies. Hence, this study draws 
on the analyses of Little & Little (2006), Macey & Schneider (2008) and Shuck (2011) to empirically 
investigate the meanings accrued to employee engagement from the perspectives of both HRD/M 
practitioners and researchers . This comparative analytic study is highly relevant to the chosen 
conference stream.  
 
PURPOSE, QUESTIONS AND METHODS  
The purpose of this study is to determine the differences and similarities between the 
understandings of HRD/M academics and practitioners about employee engagement to determine 
the relationship between employee engagement and other well -known constructs s uch as affective 
commitment, job involvement and organisational citizenship behaviour. In addition, this study 
attempts to determine the uniqueness and importance of employee engagement.  
The main research question of this study is “what is employee engagement?” To find answer to this 
question, the researcher worked with a sample of 56 individuals (28 HRD/M academics/researchers 
and 28 HRD/M practitioners) using both semi -structured intervi ews and questionnaires as methods 
of data collection and thematic analysis and statistical analysis to analyse the data.  
 
IMPORTANCE  
This study will be of interest to both HRD/M researcher and practitioners in finding a common 
ground about the meaning of employee engagement and help address the problem of how to and 
what to measure when attempting to build and sustain a high performing engaged workforce. The 
comparative analysis of perspectives of employee engagement from both academics and 
practitioners will provide data on main components of the concepts and other related constructs.  
 
CONCLUSION  
The findings of this study reveal that the understandings of employee engagement from the 
perspectives of both HRD/M researchers and practitioners are similar with strong links to the extant 
literature. The study concludes that HRD/M researchers and practitioners need to start

177 
collaborating more effectively not only in research around employee engagement, but also in 
designing interventions for the development of an engaged workforce.

ID:179  - How Work and Family Domains Relate to a Woman's Job Satisfaction  
Deriyana R. Banks, Cindy L. Crowder  & Barbara A. W. Eversole  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
An individual’s work status can cause an imbalance with their family life. The reverse may also 
happen in which obligations within one’s family may impact an employee’s work. The roles assumed 
by these individuals add to the burden of navigating a busy home life and career. Greenhaus and 
Beutell (1985) defined this as conflict. Parenting young childr en, working long hours or a second job, 
maintaining a marital relationship, and caring for an elderly parent are all example of roles that 
contribute to the spillover between the two domains.  
 
Individuals have a limited amount of resources within each domain and can experience a drain in 
one or both domains when the resources are depleted (Frone, 2003; Voydanoff, 2004). Fatigue and 
strain diminish one’s overall level of satisfaction. Shifts have  occurred in the family structures to 
create complex family compositions, leading to an increased awareness of gender roles, trends, and 
patterns. However, women tend to assume more roles, creating the opportunity for conflict to exist. 
Pichler (2009) and Tan et al. (2022) found that women experienced more challenges when faced 
with conflict between the two domains.  
 
Employers have recognized the strain amongst employees and have offered programs and 
workplace policies to promote a more integrated approach to managing work and family 
responsibilities, attempting to decrease conflict and increase satisfaction within eac h domain. The 
purpose of most programs and policies is to decrease the work and family conflicts among 
employed parents (Glass & Fujimoto, 1995) while at the same time, decreasing absenteeism and 
improve productivity (Frone & Yardley, 1996) and increase jo b satisfaction (Terry & Woo, 2021).  
Thompson, et al's. (1999) study found that employees who utilized these types of programs 
reported experiencing significantly less stress in meeting the competing demands of work and 
family.  
 
Work -life literature often includes the concept of balance.  A basic definition of balance used in the 
work -life literature encompasses emotional, physical, spiritual, and developmental components 
(Haddock, et al., 2001).  However, researchers have struggl ed with the concept because it implies 
one can find equal distribution of work and life.  Instead, the word integration is more appropriate.  
Work should not be separated from life, and it should be recognized as a meaningful and essential 
part of life (Ra poport et al., 2002).  Therefore, work -life should be approached as an integrated 
perspective.  
 
Theoretical framework  
The demands on a job and the availability of resources during a job influence performance.  Like 
Greenhaus and Beutell’s (1985) conflict between work and family domains, job and personal 
demands can trigger a resource impairment process that leads to undes irable individual outcomes. 
Job Demands -Resource Theory (JD -R) suggested strain is a response to imbalance between 
demands on employees and the resources they have to deal with those demands can explain 
organizational processes influencing employee health,  well-being, and performance (Bakker & 
Demerouti, 2017). However, instead of focusing solely on the negative outcomes like burnout or 
sickness caused by the presence of job demands and the lack of job resources, JD -R theory includes 
both negative and posit ive indicators and outcomes of employee well -being. Job resources may 
buffer the effect of job demands on job strain. JD -R theory proposes reversed causal effects: 
whereas burned -out employees may create more job demands over time for themselves, engaged 
workers mobilize their own job resources to stay engaged (Bakker et al, 2023).

179 
Job satisfaction is studied within the context of employee behavior linked to organizational 
outcomes such as productivity, performance, and absenteeism (Filiz, 2014). Locke (1978) defined job 
satisfaction as “a pleasure or positive emotional state resulti ng from the appraisal of one’s job or 
job experiences” (p. 1304). In developing the scale to measure job satisfaction, Brayfield and Rothe 
(1951) focused on the individual's attitude toward their work and building an index to over -all job 
satisfaction rath er than to specific aspects of a job situation. They stated their scale would elicit an 
expression of feeling and include items that evoke cooperation from both management and 
employees, contributing to less conflict.  
 
Purpose of the Study  
The purpose of this student was to examine the relationship between work and family in the lives of 
women and how that relationship impacted their job satisfaction. Items from the European Social 
Survey (ESS II) were used to examine the work - and family -related causes of work -life balance and 
imbalance, and Brayfield and Rothe’s () Job Satisfaction Scale was used to measure the connections 
between satisfaction and work/family issues. The following research questions were addressed:  
 
1. Do resource drains in the work domain impact an employee’s job satisfaction?  
2. Do resource drains in the family domain impact an employee’s job satisfaction?  
 
Implications for Practice in HRD  
While extensive research has been conducted to determine the factors that produce or reduce 
conflict between work and family domains, little has been done to identify specific factors that 
produce enrichment. Human resource professionals should examine the  contrasting tenet within 
the JD -R model that while job strain develops when job demands are high and when job resources 
are limited, work engagement occurs when job resources are high. This implies human resource 
professionals should be watching for high demands within job designs and identify additional 
resources that can be provided to employees. They can review existing policies that offer 
alternatives to employees who experience conflict between the domains of work and family, 
encouraging employees to utilize the programs without fear of retribution within the organization.

ID:186  - How does a CEO influence TMT employee engagement?  
Wafa Damlaj  & Matthew W Hurtienne  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
Highly engaged employees, in teams, play a pivotal role in driving an organization’s competitive 
advantage (Gallup, 2023; Decuypere & Schaufeli, 2021; Shuck & Herd, 2012). And team engagement 
is strongly influenced by leadership —a leader's role accounts fo r at least 70% of the engagement 
variance (Gallup, 2023; Harter, 2018). An extensive body of literature, comprising over 200 studies, 
has explored the relationship between leadership and employee engagement, highlighting the 
correlation and the direct or i ndirect effects of leadership on employee engagement. Moreover, 
they found that leaders play an important role in subordinates' employee engagement (Carasco -
Saul et al., 2015; Bakker & Albrecht, 2018; Li et al., 2021). However, in most of those empirical 
studies, this relationship is examined within the middle management levels of leadership and not, 
for instance, at the C -suite leadership level. In the realm of leadership theories, there is a dedicated 
body of literature that focuses exclusively on C -suite  leadership, commonly referred to as strategic 
leadership, as there are distinctions that exist between leadership and strategic leadership. 
Strategic leadership encompasses individuals such as CEOs and CEOs’ direct reports, referred to as 
top management t eams (TMTs), including CFOs and CHROs (Finkelstein et al., 2009).  
In addition, although research routinely emphasizes the significant influence of the CEO on overall 
organizational outcomes (Hambrick, 2007), a source of research also purports that TMT attributes 
have the potential to provide a more comprehensive influenc e on organizational objectives 
(Hambrick, 2007; Finkelstein et al., 2009). Moreover, there is compelling evidence that both CEO and 
TMT traits can be contributory to employee engagement (Xu & Thomas, 2011). Yet, little attention 
has been paid to understand ing the nexus of CEO influence on TMT employee engagement. This 
research aims to explore the mechanisms that either promote or hinder TMT employee 
engagement under the influence of a CEO.  
 
Theoretical Base  
Social Exchange Theory is a commonly used framework to analyze and understand employee 
engagement. According to this theory, obligations are created through interactions between parties 
who are interdependent (Saks and Rotman, 2006). Social Exchange Theory  provides a perspective to 
explore the expectations of employees from their direct supervisors and other leaders in the 
organization. It also helps to understand how professional relationships develop over time, leading 
to mutual commitment, trust, and loy alty (Cropanzano and Mitchel, 2005, p. 875). The theory 
suggests that employees tend to be more engaged when they believe that their employer or 
supervisor will reciprocate by providing positive motivation, leading to a cycle of reciprocal 
relationships (H urtienne et al., 2021). Hence, Social Exchange Theory is an appropriate framework 
for studying employee engagement (Saks and Rotman, 2006).  
 
Research Purpose  
On one hand, the C -suite, positioned at the top of the organizational hierarchy, possesses the 
capacity and power to significantly influence various organizational outcomes (Finkelstein et al., 
2009). Their decisions play a critical role in determining the ongoing success of the organization 
(Munawaroh et al.,  2021; Hogan & Kaiser, 2005). On the other hand, employee engagement has a 
significantly positive correlation with business success at the individual and organizational levels 
and produces multiple successful attributes, including retention, productivity, and profitability (Popli 
& Rizvi, 2016). When examining the relationship between C -suite leadership and employee 
engagement, there is a gap in the research regarding the factors that the CEO impacts TMT

182 
employee engagement. Thus, the purpose of this study is to understand how the CEO influences 
TMT employee engagement.  
 
Research Question  
Strategic leadership and employee engagement are two heavily researched topics in organizational 
studies. However, the relationship between strategic leadership (i.e., C -suite leadership) and 
employee engagement has not been sufficiently explored. More spe cifically, the influence of CEO 
leaders on TMT employee engagement has been largely overlooked. Thus, in this qualitative 
research project, the research question is: how does a CEO influence TMT employee engagement?  
 
Implications for Practice  
Recognizing the critical roles of both CEOs and TMTs in an organization, pivotal role of engaged 
employees in business success, and the significance of leaders in fostering team employee 
engagement, the influence of CEOs on TMTs employee engagement emerges  as a compelling and 
crucial area for investigation in organizational and HRD studies. This examination sheds light on 
potential implications for practice, offering insights to guide HRD practices, leadership development 
programs, and strategies dedicated to enhancing employee engagement among C -suite leadership. 
The outcome aims at fostering better team productivity and performance, benefiting both 
individuals and the organization as a whole.

ID:211  - A temporary truce between labour and capital with furlough  
Amir Keshtiban, Ian Fitzgerald  & David McNulty  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This paper investigates the impact of the furlough scheme on professional workers and the role of 
unions during the lockdown. In the context of the lockdown roadmap, a majority of furloughed 
employees from skill levels one to three are expected to return to work. However, a distinct 
scenario unfolds for skill level four employees, comprising highly skilled professionals who were 
furloughed while t heir roles were assumed by non -furloughed colleagues. With the collaboration of 
the Trades Union Congress (TUC), this project aims to enhance our understanding of the impact of 
the furlough scheme specifically on skill level four employees. It assesses the  effectiveness of the 
scheme in preserving the jobs of these highly skilled workers, explores any resulting shifts in work 
methodologies, and investigates opportunities for refining the scheme's design.  
The study delves into the extent to which this impact has influenced or will influence the current 
and future strategies of businesses and organizations in managing their furloughed workforce. 
Additionally, it examines the degree of trade union engagement among skill level four professional 
employees both before and during the pandemic. Through these investigations, the research seeks 
to provide nuanced insights into the experiences and considerations surrounding high -skilled 
employees in the context of the  furlough scheme. The ultimate goal is to offer valuable 
recommendations for enhancing policies and organizational strategies in response to the unique 
challenges faced by skill level four employees during the pandemic and beyond.

ID:235  - Positive Psychological Capital as a Predictor of Perceived 
Performance: A Study Applied to Students of the Air Force Academy  
Gonçalo Margarido, Ana Gomes  & Sónia P. Gonçalves  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Today, more than ever, new ways of increasing competitiveness in the labor market are being 
sought. One of the ways found to increase this edge over other companies was to bet on the 
workers and their ability to improve. In this way, they started looking for new fields to invest efforts 
in and thus increase organizations' productivity. With this, fields of study emerged that sought to 
increase the productivity of companies, paying special attention to individuals and their ability to 
improve (Lopes et al, 2005), as well as to their happiness and well -being, since they believe that this 
is an added value (Wright, 2003) As a result, new concepts emerged, such as Positive Psychological 
Capital  (PPC) and Work Engagement (WE).  
 
It is therefore relevant to understand the relationship between PPC and WE because, as the 
literature states, work engagement is a predictor of performance.  
Due to its mission, performance is a central variable in any context, especially in a military 
organization. This was highlighted by Chambel et al. (2019), who concluded that it is crucial to study 
the effects of WE on military behaviors, as well as on the ir performance.  
In the organizational behavior literature, perceived performance has been conceptualized with the 
following dimensions, task performance, contextual performance and counterproductive work 
behaviors. These three types of perceived performance appear in 1990  with Campbell, who defines 
them as actions that contribute to the achievement of a company’s objectives, the so -called 
Individual Work Performance (IWP).  
 
With this work, we intend to study the relationship between positive psychological capital and the 
perceived performance of students at the Portuguese Air Force Academy (PoAFA), with WE playing a 
fundamental role as a mediating variable. It is therefore as sumed that PPC is decisive for a 
psychological state of energy, enthusiasm, and involvement in study, which is reflected in better 
task and contextual performance and less counterproductive WE in the military students. Based on 
these concepts, the followin g Research Question becomes pertinent:  
"What is the influence of Positive Psychological Capital on the perceived performance of Air Force 
Academy students?"  
 
A cross -sectional correlational study was conducted with a quantitative methodology, through a 
questionnaire survey. The sample consisted of 242 students of the PoAFA. To carry out data 
processing, the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) ver sion 28.0 platform was used.  
Initially, the psychometric qualities of the measuring instruments were analyzed. Descriptive 
analyzes of the variables under study were then carried out. Finally, the correlational analysis was 
carried out, as well as the analysis of mediation hypotheses,  using the Process v3.1 macro tool. As a 
complement, mean difference tests were also carried out to analyze the hypothesis of significant 
differences between specialty, position and gender among PoAFA students.  
Results confirmed the existence of a positive and significant relation between PPC and WE with IWP. 
Regarding the three components of individual work performance,  there was a positive and 
significant relation between PPC and WE with task and contextual pe rformance, and negative and 
significant with counterproductive work behaviors.  
 
it was possible to confirm that WE plays an important role in the relationship between PPC and IWP.

186 
This research has expanded the knowledge of variables that lead to better performance levels in 
POAFA military students. Given this, specific programs regarding the improvement of PPC should be 
implemented to improve students’ performance.

ID:246  - Employer Branding in Public Organization  
David Xavier, Damasceno Dias  & Miguel Agrochão  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The study is carried out in the context of the Public Sector, seeking to bring the issue of the 
Employer to the fore. Branding in Portugal compared to what has been done in some European 
countries. The literature explains the con -cept, the elaboration of s trategies, the complexities of the 
involvement of the actors, who create their own meanings around the concept. This study aims to 
add a new paradigm to organizational image and reputation, seeking to adapt, recreate an 
employer brand strategy in the publi c sector through the lens of Employer theory Branding. This is a 
major challenge for public or -ganizations, since public employment is perceived as being 
unattractive.  
 
The aim of this study was to explore some employer branding practices within the public sector and 
see to what extent the idea can be endogenized through interpretation, understandings of the 
actors involved and interest in the concept. The research contex t is merely exploratory, and it is 
hoped that it can contribute to explaining how the employer brand is constructed in practice and 
how it emerged within public organizations for understanding the contribution of the employer 
brand.  
 
The restructuring of government functions, privatization and cuts in per -sonnel costs have led, in 
many countries, to a decrease of public servants and one of the crucial challenges facing the public 
sector will be how to at -tract personnel to the function s of the future. The practice will be a complex 
construction process, which obviously must be adapted to different work contexts to be successful.

ID:257  - Intrapreneurial behavior: development of a measurement scale  
Rita Oliveira Pelica, Patricia Jardim da Palma  & Maria João Velez  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The objective of this study is to develop an intrapreneurial behavior scale, to measure 
intrapreneurship at the individual -level. A four steps process was followed. First, the identification of 
the domains and items generation: through a systematic literary review the intrapreneurship 
conc ept was defined as a behavior - the voluntary act of employees, going the “extra -mile” in their 
jobs – with six domains emerging from the literature: 1) communication and information, 2) 
innovativeness, 3) networking and influence, 4) new business and oppo rtunities, 5) personal 
initiative and 6) risk tolerance. Based on the domains’ definition, 41 original items were generated. 
Second, building content validity and pre -questions: a panel of twelve experts evaluated the 
domains’ content and the items’ qualit y. Third, the development of a questionnaire including a scale 
of 39 final validated items. Fourth, the questionnaire administration: the scale in now being tested 
through an online questionnaire, via Google Forms, on the professional network Linkedin. Des pite 
not having results yet, our expectation is to contribute to the HRD theory and practice by 
developing a new and relevant instrument to measure intrapreneurship, that scholars can apply in 
their research and human resources practitioners in their work.

ID:82  - Problem -Finding Project: The Crucial Element for Value Creation in 
Organizations  
Carla Sofia Fonseca  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The current VUCA environment makes it essential to understand and follow the dynamics and 
constant evolution of the business world, a challenge that leads organizations to emerge in their 
ability to adapt to achieve success and sustainability in a global and increasingly c ompetitive world. 
Mutation includes the projectification of society and the capitalism of stakeholders in the alignment 
of their strategy. It involves addressing new transformative dynamics based on an economy of 
innovative, unique, differentiating and val ue-creating projects, designed to achieve and manage 
benefits not only for the organization but for the entire ecosystem in which it operates because it 
develops solutions to real, complex problems that promote the ESRS. The lack of knowledge, 
complexity a nd novelty of the problem is at the heart of it, manifested in complex interactions, in 
which the relationship between the experience of the client's dimensions has a relevant role and 
contribution, which is decisive in getting to know the deep, hidden lay ers of the problem's iceberg, 
which requires new approaches that the classic, rational and linear management approach is 
unable to provide. The value of interaction is reflected in the innovation strategy, which addresses 
problem -solving and consists of fo ur stages: identifying and defining the problem, analyzing the 
problem, prioritizing the solution, and implementing the solution. The value of the solution comes 
from the biggest challenge, Problem Finding is the first and most important stage of this proc ess, 
the beginning of value creation, which is established by correctly identifying and defining the 
problem, based on real facts, and the scientific method in analyzing the root cause. Problem Finding 
is the disruptive element that aims to align strategy,  innovation and change through the 
development of resource perspectives and dynamic capabilities, involving the collaboration of 
various actors in the construction and development of innovative strategies and solutions that 
understand their context of acti on and their stakeholders. Manifested in the value of perceiving real 
problems, resulting from feedback and the constant involvement of customer dimensions, allowing 
problems to be identified, leading to the co -creation of value. Understanding the synergy of the 
Problem Finding project, as a differentiating factor in innovation, sustainability, and value creation 
projects, recognizing the role of resource perspectives and dynamic capabilities, outlines the 
objective of this study, identifying Problem Findin g as the elementary key to innovation and value 
creation, the research problem is:  
How is Problem Finding the approach that enables innovation and value creation in an 
organization?  
 
This analysis of the research problem involves understanding the importance and value of Problem 
Finding and its steps:  
 
Identifying, defining, and analyzing the cause of the problem.  
Recognizing the impact of correct problem definition on innovation and the creation and sustaining 
of value.

ID:195  - Passion as Payroll - Unleashing the potential of volunteers  
Edmina Bradshaw  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The pressure on nonprofit organizations to show results and strategic solutions is unending. This 
persistent deficit in results is attributed to equally persistent shortfalls in funding and human 
capital.  
 
Self Directed Volunteer Teams (SDVT) is a structured volunteer engagement model focused on 
strategic outcomes that has been codified and its application tested across a wide variety of 
organizations in the U.S. Given the challenges of volunteer engagement and retention, 
compounded by resource requirements for volunteer management, can self direction of volunteers 
be an optimal approach for nonprofits? Self directed employee teams in the business field is a well -
established concept, but its application in th e volunteer sector demands a radically different 
approach.  
 
This paper describes the SDVT model and argues for its place as a promising model that produces 
measurable outcomes, increases organizational capacity by freeing staff to fulfill other job roles, 
taps the full range of volunteer talent and experience, and increases the strategic outcomes  for the 
organization.

ID:15  - The intuitive responses of UK employees to sycophantic behaviour 
being exhibited within the workplace. Is it time to manage this with practical 
HRM support?  
 
Neil Beasley, Madeline Stevens  & Hannah Wilson  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The intuitive responses of UK employees to sycophantic behaviour being exhibited within the 
workplace. Is it time to manage this with practical HRM support?  
The definition of ingratiation, is that of a behavioural act of trying to please a target by deeds, 
compliments or actions (Jones, 1964). When one is sycophantic, these deeds and actions are 
deemed insincere, deceptive or manipulative (Carlson, 2012). However, when one excl usively 
ingratiates upwards to senior colleagues or people of influence, the insincerity and manipulative 
nature of the actions can be indistinguishable from sycophancy (Turnley & Bolino, 2001). The act of 
exclusively ingratiating upwards or exhibiting syc ophantic behaviour in UK workplaces, has been 
researched by conducting semi -structured interviews in accordance with a pragmatic qualitative 
methodology, underpinned by a framework based upon the cognitive dissonance theory (Zou et al., 
2020). The purpose of this research is unique in the fact that it considers the following question;  
Would it be beneficial to the workforce, to manage, investigate and where required conduct 
disciplinary proceedings of this deviant branch of impression management? This question is the 
main focus of the research which has generated the following objective s: 
 
• To investigate if the act of exclusively upwards ingratiation affects civility between 
colleagues within workplaces;  
• To understand if the act of individuals exclusively ingratiating upwards, effects the morale of 
employees in an organisation;  
• To investigate if employees in UK workplaces, think that sycophantic acts that are 
detrimental to others in the workplace, should be tolerated without consequences or think 
that such cases should be classified as misconduct and treated accordingly.  
 
This research has highlighted the negative effects of sycophantic behaviour and exclusively 
ingratiating upwards has on the workplace. One participant, highlighted the effect on teamwork, 
sycophantic behaviour, can have within the workplace. ‘Sycophancy me ans raising yourself in 
somebody's esteem at the expense of somebody else, on the ladder. And so… it's going to impact 
upon on the ability to be part of a team.’ On the issue of managing these behavioural traits via an 
HRM process, a comparison to another behaviour already managed by HRM professionals is 
proffered.  ‘Sycophantic behaviour… is coming into the same category as bullying. And it's hard 
sometimes, especially with bullying and sycophantic behaviour, because you are dealing with… 
people that are m anipulative, and manipulating people are quite charismatic. And when you're 
charismatic, you're more believable.’ Another participant was more explicit on this same subject 
matter stating ‘sycophancy is a small behaviour which is indicative of a bigger pro blem and it needs 
to be addressed.’ These findings have also been franked by existing impression management 
literature (Vonk, 1998; Deluga, 2004, Kim, LePine and Chun, 2018, Klotz et al., 2018).  
 
The implications of this research, if realised, means HRM professionals would be educated to see 
the signs of when people are using the deviant side of ingratiation.  And in the process the 
workplace should become a fairer, more balanced place for everyone  concerned. Most stakeholders 
within a company should feel the positive effects of the implementation of appropriate guidance

192 
and instruction, distributed from HRM to the wider workforce. And more importantly, workplace 
management and HRM will have another practical tool to manage deviancy.

ID:51  - Family Employer Brand, Work Engagement, and Turnover Intention: A 
Study on Nonfamily Employees in Family Businesses  
 
Tuan -Duong Nguyen  & Shyh -jer Chen  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This study investigates the impact of nonfamily employees’ perceptions of the family business 
employer brand, based on the organizational instrumental and symbolic attributes, on turnover 
intention, and the mediator (i.e. work engagement) and moderator (i. e., motivation and 
occupational rank) for this relationship. 209 pairs of nonfamily employees and their direct 
managers data was collected. More specifically this study assesses the evaluation of incumbent 
nonfamily employees in the family business on the employer brand based on the organizational 
instrumental and symbolic attributes. In addition, the impact of nonfamily employees’ perceptions 
of instrumental attributes and symbolic attributes on their turnover intention with the mediating 
role of work enga gement. In addition, the moderating effects of occupational rank and motivation 
of nonfamily employees in the relationship between their perceptions of instrumental attributes 
and symbolic attributes on work engagement were tested. The results of the Parti al Least Squares -
Structural Equation Modeling (PLS -SEM) with SMARTPLS 3.0 showed that: (1) nonfamily employees 
had relatively positive evaluations of family business employer brand; (2) nonfamily employees’ 
perceptions of instrumental attributes were not r elated to, while their perceptions of symbolic 
attributes were significantly related to turnover intention; (3) work engagement mediated the 
perceptions of family business employer brand and turnover intention relationship; (4) the 
moderating effect of non family employees’ motivation were not supported; (5) occupational rank 
moderated the relationship between perceptions of family business employer brand instrumental 
attributes and work engagement, such that the relationship was stronger for blue than white -collar 
workers; (6) occupational rank moderated the relationship between perceptions of family business 
employer brand symbolic attributes and work engagement, such that the relationship was stronger 
for white than blue -collar workers.

ID:68  - When humans work in -tandem with artificial intelligence systems: The 
impact on staff wellbeing in the logistics industry  
 
Ewuradjoa Mansa Quansah  & Dr Xiaoxian Zhu  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Introduction  
The aim of the research is to identify the effects of artificial intelligence systems on staff wellbeing 
at the workplace where employees work in tandem with AI systems. As AI is advancing and being 
incorporated into firms, there is the constant need for w orkers to keep up with technological pace 
and the addition of these AI technologies in operations (Fleming, 2020; Zirar, Ali and Islam, 2023). 
These additions of these technologies tend to have some effects employees on wellbeing when 
working alongside the se technologies (Selenko et al., 2022). (Chowdhury et al., 2022) stipulates how 
difficult it is for organizations to integrate AI and workers. Further, a cognitive survey by Deloitte 
indicated that 47% of the respondents found it difficult to integrate the se technologies with existing 
processes . The research explored how HR can better support employee wellbeing by providing rich 
insight into the human impacts of AI to inform better HR policies, training, and employee support 
systems.  
 
Theoretical Foundations  
Employee wellbeing is essential in the carrying employee tasks (Adams, 2019). When employees 
have good health they can be productive and carry on their roles. The job -demands -resources (JD -R) 
theory by Bakker and his co -authors (Demerouti et al., 2001) is employed in this study to analyse AI 
systems impacts on workers. They propose 2 broad categories of working conditions: job demands 
and job resources. (Demerouti et al., 2001) state job demands as the “physical, psychological, social, 
or organizational asp ects of the job that require sustained physical and/or psychological (cognitive 
and emotional) effort or skills and are therefore associated with certain physiological and/or 
psychological costs”. Whereas Job resources are “those physical, psychological, s ocial, or 
organizational aspects of the job that are functional in achieving work goals, reducing job demands 
and the associated physiological and psychological costs, and stimulating personal growth, learning, 
and development”. The study relies on this mo del to explain that human -AI collaboration put some 
strain or demand on workers that needs to be identified and the appropriate job resources made 
available for workers; as illustrated by (Mäkikangas et al., 2021) the job resources are those 
resources that  help individuals deal with the demands of their jobs.  
 
Research Design  
The research design is qualitative in nature. Qualitative design helps us derive rich insights into the 
phenomenon at hand. The philosophical paradigm employed in the research is the interpretivist 
approach. The interpretivist approach focuses on how human s make sense of the world (Saunders 
et. al, 2009).   
 
Population, Sample & Sampling Technique  
The target population is the UK this is because of how advanced the country is in digital 
transformation, previous research identified the UK as the digital capital of Europe (Hathaway, 
Bailey and Cilauro, 2017). A purposeful sampling technique based on cr iterion sampling was 
utilised. The unit of analysis were individuals of a company that uses AI systems in their operations 
specifically in the logistics industry. The criteria used for sample selection included individuals based

195 
in the UK who work in -tandem with AI systems like robots and other AI technologies and who have 
been working with these technologies for a minimum of three months.  
Data Collection  
The method of data collection included semi -structured interviews. Individuals were contacted 
through WhatsApp and emails. The participants were identified from social media platforms like 
LinkedIn, company websites and researcher contacts. The interviews were conducted on Microsoft 
Teams. The interviews were recorded and transcribed and lasted for an hour.  
 
Data Analysis  
Thematic analysis is being used to identify themes and trends in the data. NVivo software is being 
used to analyse the data. The data is being analysed as the data is being collected, which the 
qualitative method lends itself to. The goal of the analysis w ill be to identify patterns and trends in 
the data (Edmondson and Mcmanus, 2007).  
 
Preliminary Results  
The current preliminary results suggests that while AI provides more flexibility for employees, it also 
creates pressure to constantly be productive. Employees feel their "antennas are always up" and 
they have little time to rest. This highlights the need for HR to balance technology use with 
employee wellbeing. The study also highlights the static and monotonous nature when interacting 
with robots and other AI systems. In instances, where there was less human interaction this posed a 
strain on employee men tal wellbeing and satisfaction levels. The study further shows how AI is 
automating certain HR processes like leave approvals which increases efficiency and allows HR to 
focus on more strategic priorities. The research also demonstrated how AI is being use d to track 
productivity and performance. The technology records employee activities, withdrawals, breaks etc. 
This allows HR and managers to monitor staff more closely which could also potentially have 
negative impacts on employee wellbeing.  
 
Conclusion  
Overall, this study provides a qualitative view into how the increasing use of AI is impacting 
employee overall wellbeing when collaborating with AI systems. The research calls for organizations 
to properly train staff to leverage AI and technology develop ers to augment the technology while 
supporting health, wellbeing and development. When employers and companies are aware of the 
impact AI has on staff wellbeing companies would be able to properly train and develop their 
human resource and adjust how these  technologies function to be able to recoup maximum 
benefits and ensure staff are healthy to perform their roles.

ID:102  - Unveiling the double -edged sword effects of perceived 
overqualification: the role of self -efficacy and transformational leadership  
Tuan -Duong Nguyen, Thi Huong Giang Vu  & Shyh -Jer Chen  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Overqualification as a part of underemployment occurs when an individual possesses more 
qualifications such as education, knowledge, skills, and ability than that which is required to 
perform their job efficiently. As more people are getting higher educati on, the job market has 
become more competitive, leading to individuals being employed in positions that do not match 
their qualifications. As such, perceived overqualification is a widespread phenomenon in the global 
workplace. Moreover, the COVID -19 pande mic and associated economic downturn have concerning 
implications for the labor market, especially in nations with high unemployment rates. As a result, 
enhancing our understanding of employee reactions to this phenomenon is crucial not only in the 
West bu t also in other parts of the world. In literature, overqualification can be described as either 
objective or subjective. It is argued that perceived overqualification (POQ) is a better measure of 
overqualification than objective measures because of two key  points. First, POQ captures the 
personal experiences of overqualified employees better than objective overqualification. Second, 
the indicators used to assess objective overqualification fail to capture the differences between 
positions with the same name . Therefore, this study focuses on a subjective measure of 
overqualification known as POQ.  
 
Previous studies have mostly focused on negative work attitudes and behaviors resulting from 
perceived overqualified, such as job burnout, turnover, counterproductive work behavior, and job 
searching. Nevertheless, recent research indicates that employees who feel overqualified may 
positively view their redundant skills and use them to proactively produce positive work outcomes. 
Moreover, there is limited research on the mediators between POQ and employee outcomes as well 
as boundary conditions that can mit igate or enhance the effects of POQ. Therefore, this study 
investigates the double -edged sword effects of perceived overqualification with the mediating role 
of self -efficacy and the moderating role of transformational leadership. In terms of variable 
outc omes, this study specifically focuses on turnover intention as a dark side and innovative work 
behaviors as a bright side. The data of 468 voluntary respondents working in various industries in 
Vietnam were analyzed with partial least squares structural eq uation modeling (PLS -SEM) to 
evaluate the assessment measurement model and test the proposed hypotheses. The results 
indicated that self -efficacy mediates the negative relationship between POQ and turnover intention 
as well as the positive relationship bet ween POQ and innovative work behaviors. Besides, this study 
also highlights the role of transformational leadership as boundary conditions in the two side 
effects of POQ on turnover intention and innovative work behaviors. Particularly, transformational 
leadership moderates the perceived overqualification -turnover intention association such that this 
relationship will be stronger with a high level of transformational leadership rather than a low one. 
Meanwhile, the positive relationship between POQ and inno vative work behaviors will be stronger 
with a high level of transformational leadership rather than a low one. Finally, this study significantly 
contributes to the growing body of knowledge on both the dark side and bright side of perceived 
overqualificati on in developing countries.

ID:154  - Making Things Work: Public Perceptions of UK Manufacturing  
Robert Stewart, Jillian MacBryde, Colin Lindsay  & Carolina Marin Cadavid  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Importance  
We hear much about the ongoing ‘war for talent’, high numbers of unfilled vacancies and skill 
shortages in UK manufacturing. Previous policy analysis and survey research highlights that the 
image of manufacturing work and jobs are problems to be ‘fixed’ in post -industrial economies such 
as the U K and US, and that the older industrial legacy/image of the sector makes these jobs less 
desirable to jobseekers. However, the adoption of new manufacturing digital technologies and the 
need for greater workforce digital skills may help address some of the  negative images associated 
with working in the sector and offer better job quality. This should help manufacturers better 
compete for emerging Gen Z talent and extend their reach into under -represented groups such as 
women and minorities. This paper repor ts new primary survey data to better understand public 
perceptions of the UK manufacturing sector and jobs, what factors shape these views and how 
industry stakeholders can better engage under -represented groups such as women in the industry  
 
Theoretical base  
The paper draws on a range of concepts but is largely theoretically based within the literature on 
job quality. The latter refers to the job attributes that contributes to, or detracts from, workers’ well -
being (Muñoz de Bustillo et al 2011). Job quality i s of course multidimensional and overlaps with 
related concepts such as ‘good’ or ‘decent’ jobs and ‘fair work’ (e.g. Findlay 2016, Findlay et al 2017). 
Although there is no single accepted definition of job quality, Findlay (2016) argues for a focus on 
employment quality (pay and employment terms), job or task quality (skills utilisation, pace, 
autonomy, control, problem -solving and opportunities for learning) and workplace quality 
(opportunity, voice and respect).  Warhurst et al (2017) provide an overlap ping definition, identifying 
six key dimensions of job quality: pay and rewards; intrinsic objective (e.g. skills, autonomy, and 
control) and subjective (e.g. effort, fulfilment) characteristics; terms of employment (e.g. contractual 
security, career devel opment); health and safety; work -life balance (e.g. flexibility); and 
representation and voice. Our survey looks at what people value in jobs, the images they associate 
with manufacturing work (and jobs) and the relative attraction of the sector as a caree r pathway in 
the context of emerging new digital technologies. Our survey measures what people value in 
choosing a new job, how this compares to what they think of work in manufacturing and how new 
technologies may help change work and careers in the secto r.  
 
Research purpose  
This paper seeks to explore the perceived importance and image of UK manufacturing in the post -
industrial UK economy as a career destination for jobseekers. We present a high -level analysis of 
survey responses from a representative sample of 2,107 people a cross the UK. We find that while 
people strongly value the contribution of the sector (for the continuous supply of goods, innovation, 
and future prosperity), views on manufacturing work and jobs are strongly shaped by proximity and 
familiarity: the closer  people are connected to the sector (either directly through their work or social 
networks), the more positive they are about job quality and how new technologies will change 
future jobs and careers. Despite this and because the sector must better attract talent from under -
represented groups, we discuss what women think of manufacturing work and what the sector has 
to do to make it more attractive to this demographic in terms of greater flexibility practices and 
inclusive workspaces.

198 
Research question/s  
Our research questions include: whether people still value the manufacturing sector in the post -
industrial economy; what things people associate with manufacturing work, and what job qualities 
they are looking for in the current labour market; the perceive d quality of manufacturing jobs; and 
how new manufacturing technologies are likely to change the attractiveness of future jobs and 
careers?  
 
Implications for HRD practice  
The research highlights the potential value of working in advanced UK manufacturing as a career 
destination and the importance of a range of different HR practices – as well as investments in job 
resources – as a route to enhanced job attractiveness and be tter work engagement among 
employees. The findings have implications for HR practice, sector and employer branding.  
 
Conclusions  
Our conclusions focus on the need a strong industry narrative on the value of the sector, the 
importance of identifying/reflecting jobseekers needs, the importance of positively engaging 
workforces around new technologies in terms of upskilling (and not do wnskilling or job destruction) 
and going forward with best practice HR in terms of flexibility and engaging under -represented 
groups.

ID:26  – The Work Design Puzzle: Untangling its Relationship with Work -Life 
Balance Across Different Forms of Work  
Amadeja Lamovšek, Matej Černe, Aleš Popovič, Laura Trinchera, Shaima' 
Salem Moh'd & Ivan Radević  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Designing jobs across different forms of work (on -site, hybrid, and remote) is a comprehensive yet 
understudied topic, despite the uptake of alternative work arrangements in recent years. This study 
aims to identify the most beneficial work design configur ations in terms of fostering employees' 
work -life balance (WLB) across different forms of work. Research has recognized the strategic value 
of work -life balance programs in promoting employee retention, minimizing costs associated with 
turnover, and reduci ng absenteeism (Eby et al., 2005; Hyman & Summers, 2004). In addition to 
these established factors, our study sheds light on another way to improve WLB. In particular, work 
design emerges as an important determinant that can influence WLB, although the imp act varies 
across forms of work. It attempts to solve the practice -relevant problem of designing the work 
configuration that is most beneficial for WLB within a particular form of work and the theory -
relevant problem of traditional work design theories tha t need to be modernised to fit the 
technologically advanced new work environments. The study corresponds to some suggestions 
from previous studies (e.g., Chan et al., 2023; Chatterjee et al., 2021) by complementing previous 
research on WLB by exploring the  phenomenon through the lens of work design.  
 
Our results suggest that work design impact on WLB matters most for on -site workers, followed by 
hybrid workers and, to a lesser extent, remote workers. These findings underscore the importance 
of considering work design as one of the factors in promoting optimal WLB outcomes. Chan and 
colleagues (2023) suggested many recommendations for individual -level HR recommendations (e.g., 
building employee resilience), team - or organisational -level HR recommendations (e.g., building a 
compassionate and supportive wo rkplace culture), and socio - or governmental -level HR 
recommendations (e.g., reforming existing legislation relating to flexible working). With our study, 
we complement their research and provide recommendations for team - or organisational -level HR 
strateg ies while examining the potential impact of job design on WLB, focusing specifically on 
different forms of work. We do this by providing specific configurations that are most beneficial for 
WLB for each form of work.  
 
By integrating job design with new information and communication technology (ICT) characteristics, 
the paper aims to provide insights for optimising work design in technologically advanced work 
environments. For that, we designed two studies. The first stu dy data were collected from 605 
respondents in France between November and December 2022, while the second study data were 
collected from 1535 respondents in Montenegro in May 2023. By applying fuzzy -set qualitative 
comparative analysis (fsQCA), our study takes a holistic approach to work design configurations. The 
analysis of variance showed that workers who work in hybrid work environments generally have the 
highest WLB, followed by remote employees and onsite workers. Further, the fsQCA analysis 
suggests  that work design is important for WLB across all work forms, but it appears to be most 
salient for on -site work, followed by hybrid and then remote work. In addition, a necessity analysis 
reveals common work design requirements for all work forms, highlig hting the gravity of 
information processing, task variety, and social support. Task variety is critical for on -site and 
remote work, while IT presenteeism emerges as an important factor for hybrid work. The second 
study's findings contribute to a comprehen sive work design framework that promotes WLB in 
different work arrangements. By considering both traditional work design elements and ICT -related

200 
factors, organisations can optimise work design to meet the evolving needs of employees in 
technologically advanced work environments.  
 
In conclusion, striking a balance between job demands and job resources is critical for managers to 
optimise work design and promote WLB across different work forms. The study results indicate that 
enriched work design holds promise for improving work -life ba lance across all three forms of work. 
However, it is noteworthy that job complexity and technological complexity show an 
interchangeable effect, suggesting that it is important to focus on one of the two components to 
avoid overwhelming employees with exce ssive demands. In addition, the necessity analysis 
identifies key work design requirements that apply equally to all three forms of work. These include 
providing employees with a high level of information processing, skill variety, and social support. 
More over, both on -site and remote work require providing task variety to promote employee 
engagement and satisfaction. On the other hand, hybrid work emphasises the significance of IT 
presenteeism, which is the need for employees to be available for effective collaboration and 
communication during designated work hours. By adhering to these work design principles, 
managers can create an environment that promotes work -life balance and overall employee well -
being.

ID:199  - From organizational support to employee productivity and 
engagement: The mediating role of generative AI in knowledge management 
work of IT engineers  
Pawel Korzynski, Olga Protsiuk  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The integration of generative AI into various sectors, particularly in the domain of coding and 
documentation, has opened new avenues for enhancing knowledge management within 
organizations. This research aims to explore the potential benefits of employing gen erative AI in the 
IT sector, focusing on how training, workplace environment, and communication can impact 
intrinsic motivation among employees for knowledge management work. In this study we gathered 
data from 116 elite software engineers employed by Fort une 500 companies in the IT industry, 
spanning countries such as the United States, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and India. Our 
methodology involved using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS -SEM) for data 
analysis. The results i ndicate that training serves as a crucial facilitator of intrinsic motivation 
towards knowledge management work when using generative AI. This motivation, in turn, 
significantly impacts employee engagement and productivity. Our findings may offer insightfu l 
implications for organizations, suggesting that strategic training and support in using generative AI 
for knowledge management can not only enhance employee engagement and productivity but also 
provide a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving technolog ical landscape.

ID:17  - Unveiling Moroccan Women’s Experiences in the Corporate Boards and 
C-Suite  
Khadija Al Arkoubi  & Fadoua Tahari  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The purpose of this research study is to gain insights into the experiences, challenges, 
opportunities, and perceptions of Moroccan women who serve on corporate boards. The findings of 
this study will contribute to a better understanding of gender diversity in  leadership roles and may 
help specify the most effective initiatives to promote gender equity and inclusion in corporate 
governance and the workplace in Morocco.  
 
The Underrepresentation of women on corporate boards is global phenomenon (Catalyst, 2021). 
Morocco like other countries is still grappling with this challenge despite its commendable strides in 
recent years to foster gender equality and equal opportunitie s in corporate governance. In fact, the 
progress made in this domain is still slow and the disparity is stark in upper managerial positions, 
where a mere 5.40% of women currently occupy roles, indicating significant gender gap. 
Furthermore, the ownership o f international businesses by women in Morocco stands at a meager 
2.5%, highlighting the pressing need for enhanced support systems and increased opportunities for 
women entrepreneurs (WEF, 2023).  
 
As part of its efforts to enhance women’s representation on boards, Morocco mandated a quota of 
30% for women on publicly traded limited companies’ boards by 2024. This percentage is set to 
increase to 40% by 2027 (International Finance Corporation, 2022).  Nevertheless, it is currently hard 
to tell whether this compulsory quota system could accelerate the effective participation of women 
in corporate governance.    
 
Since there is a scant body of literature on women on boards in Morocco, we decided to conduct 
this qualitative study that relies on storytelling to uncover women’s experiences in corporate 
boardrooms as well as their opinions, emotions, and perceptions of  gender equity and inclusion in 
the realms of organizational, social, and economic life. The choice of storytelling as a research 
method is justified by the urgency of creating a relational space where stories can unfold safely and 
softly in a culture mark ed by an oral tradition and known for the need of women to share their tales 
and confide to each other to relieve themselves and find solutions to their pressing problems as 
they engage in the act of storytelling. Our sample is composed of a carefully sele cted group of 
women (20) who are members of the "Club des femmes administratrices d'entreprises" (Club of 
Women on Corporate Boards). By eliciting and sharing these stories, we aspire to contribute 
meaningfully to the ongoing discourse on gender diversity and inclusion in Moroccan corporations, 
ultimately fostering a more inclusive and equitable business environment.  
 
We also seek to provide a robust analysis of women’s experiences and opinions that will inform DEI 
(diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies and practices in Morocco and contribute to enhancing the 
impact of women in corporate governance structures as we ll as the C -Suites.  
 
This study makes three key contributions. First, it validates and affirms the personal story of every 
woman participant resulting in a reinforced sense of self, a high self -efficacy and self -confidence. 
Participants may find the storytelling process therap eutic, gaining insights into their own lives and 
values and leading to a heightened self -awareness. Second, it informs policy discussions and 
initiatives related to board diversity, gender representation and ways to address gender biases, 
glass ceilings, m aternal walls, and systemic barriers. Finally, it enriches the existing body of

203 
knowledge by shedding light on the experiences, challenges, and successes of Moroccan women on 
corporate boards in Morocco.

ID:18  - Exploring Human Resource Management Practise through the Qatar 
HR Forum; framing the influence of 'Tharaba' culture and the development of 
Qatar -Centric competencies for HR Professionals practising in Qatar  
 
Najat El Mahdy  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Qatarisation policy has emerged from the Qatar National Vision 2030 and has become embedded 
into organisations’ core strategic visions. Qatarisation aims to place knowledgeable local Qataris 
into senior professional roles to lead their country. Human Devel opment is a core pillar of the 
National Vision and is an expected responsibility of each organisation and its employees. This 
responsibility directly impacts the Human Resource Management (HRM) function and HRM 
professionals developing talent in Qatar. Thi s is a challenge due to a lack of Qatar -centric 
frameworks available to HR Professionals practising in Qatar and a lack of understanding of 
influences on HRM Practises. The research focused on overcoming this challenge and contributing 
to a sustainable fra mework solution for HR professionals in Qatar.  
There were three main aims; to review HR literature while exploring the fundamental principles and 
context of the HR professional practise in Qatar; to explore ways HR practitioners in the Qatar HR 
Forum could drive and support a change in HRM practise, an d to contribute to professionalising 
HRM Practise in Qatar. A qualitative interpretivistic approach explored the experiences and 
perceptions of HR professionals practising in Qatar, who are members of the Qatar HR Forum, 
through surveys, interviews, and fo cus groups, to understand the complexities of HRM in Qatar.  
  
The findings show that distinctive expatriate and Qatari influences need to be considered with a 
new framing of how Qatari culture might influence and impact current and future HRM practises. 
This has been conceptualised as ‘Tharaba Culture’ – ذرابه ,which encompasses behaviours, customs, 
and unwritten expectations that locals acknowledge as their culture. It is based on influences such 
as family ties, leadership status, expected norms and non -negotiable behaviours, engulfed in the 
wisdom of the resp ected e lders formulated from tribal descent. The research further impacts 
practise, with a significant outcome being the development of a Qatar -Centric HR competency 
framework, which will provide a foundation for HR professionals to meet the unique challenges and  
complexities of HRM practise in Qatar.

ID:77  - The Impact of Green Spaces on Job Satisfaction in Urban Japan  
 
Bethany Hager  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Green spaces have been found to impact individuals' well -being positively, and previous studies 
from around the world have shown that access to green spaces in the workplace can lead to 
increased job satisfaction and productivity (Lau et al., 2014). Green space can also impact a person’s 
overall health, another benefit for organizations (Kondo et al., 2018).  However, little research has 
been conducted to understand how the frequency and length of time spent in green space can 
influence job satisfaction. Th is study aims to understand the relationship between job satisfaction 
and time spent in green spaces during work. As green spaces are becoming more popular globally, 
their creation and successful management may be crucial to Japan, the world’s third -larges t 
economy (Adebayo & Kirikkaleli, 2021). While green spaces often fall on cities to fund, the financial 
burden of the creation and management of these spaces is extremely pronounced in Japan because 
demographic trends of aging and depopulation are decreasi ng the tax base for municipalities 
throughout the country (Rupprecht, 2017), causing the responsibility of these faces to fall on 
organizations. Japan is one of the top ten most green and sustainable countries in the world and is 
currently working towards having at least 50% of new cars produced with zero emissions, meeting a 
goal of 100% carbon emission -free by 2050 in major cities, and is considered to have one of the best 
recycling systems in the world (Berry, 2021). The successful implementation of gree n spaces in 
organizations will only amplify Japan’s environmental commitment.  
 
• RQ1: Will employees feel greater job satisfaction when they have access to green space at 
work?  
• RQ2: Do employees believe the length of time spent in green spaces influences the effect it 
has on job satisfaction?  
 
Over 200 city employees located in two cities in Japan participated in this study, which utilized the 
Job Satisfaction Survey 36 item, nine -facet scale to assess employee attitudes about the job and 
aspects of the job created by John Spector in 1985.  
 
Method  
 
This study utilizes a survey designed to investigate the relationship between green space at work, 
job satisfaction, and whether the amount of time spent in green space is a mediating factor in their 
relationship. Descriptive statistics and regression anal ysis via SPSS are being conducted to analyze 
results, and findings will be interpreted to discuss the implications of the results.

ID:94  - The aftermath of unprepared anti -workplace bullying legislation: The 
chaos of South Korean workplace  
Yoojeong Nadine Seo  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Five years passed since the enactment of anti -workplace bullying in South Korea. Strong legal 
punishment applies to the employers who do not respond to workplace bullying claims (upto 5 
years sentences or fines of 50 million KRW). On the positive side, the  legislation raised awareness 
on workplace bullying itself. However, the increasing managerial expedients and false claims are 
over -shadowing the positive effect of anti -workplace bullying legisaltion and the legilsation has 
become a cause of chaos in Kore an workplace. The paper will review the relevant literature and 
address the reason behind the chaos. It will then explain the types of expedients employed by the 
management and motives of false claims.  
One reason for the managerial expedients lies in that the enactment of anti -workplace bullying 
legislation did not accompany employer consensus or sense of responsibility. Despite the legal 
change, many Korean employers still consider workplace bullying an  individual matter, not 
something that should be addressed by the management. Instead of abiding by the law, Korean 
employers and management have opted for various expedients to minimize their responsibilities 
and involvement in workplace bullying claims. From supressing/ignoring workplace bullying claims 
to protecting perpetrators, their expedients manifest at all stage of workplace bullying claims 
management. The anti -workplace bullying legislation contains an article about employer 
punishment for such ex pedients but the punishment can only occur when an employee reports it. 
Korean employees are usually avoidant of reporting the management or employer in fear of 
retaliation.  
 
The reasons for rising false claims lies in that that the legal enactment also did not accompany 
enhanced employees’ ethics and that Korean leglsation does not mention duration/frequency 
criteria for bullying. Some Korean workers have been wrongly educated  that when they feel 
something is bullying, then it is bullying. Resultantly, some of them began filing a claim against a 
single incidence of ordinary managerial behavior and demand reimbursement. Soon, false claims of 
bullying became an issue in which the  claimant uses the claim as a means to gain(money, renewal 
of work contract, undeserved credits for work, heightened performance grade and etc.). In 2023 
survey, 1.4% of Korean workers responded that they have been the victims of false bullying claims. 
The figure was particularly high among the people in their 30s (2.3%) and 20s (1.5%). Another 1.6% 
were threatended with the possibility of false bullying claims. The figure was much higher for 
women (2.3%) than for men (0.8%). Employers also began utilising false claims as a means to drive 
out employees who act out to protect employees’ rights (e.g,, union members).  
The case of South Korea shows how enacting a new legislation could create a societal chaos when 
the interested parties were not prepared for the legal changes. Creating consensus and raising 
ethics should preced the enactment of new legislation.

ID:106  - Symposium on: To be or not to be strategic and why: provocations 
based on evidence in four global regions.  
Jim Stewart, Henriette Lundgren, Jenni Jones, Robert Hamlin, Rob Poell & 
Ellen Scully -Russ  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Introduction  
Previous research has demonstrated both the strategic nature of Human Resource Development 
(HRD) with a need for a more strategic contribution (McGoldrick, Stewart and Watson, 2001) and the 
continuing failure of HRD professionals to consistently achieve th e necessary status and influence in 
organisations to achieve such a contribution (Torraco and Lundgren, 2020; Byrd, 2024).  In addition, 
and in line with a trend in Human Resource Management (HRM) more generally, HRD professionals 
have experienced increasi ng devolvement of HRD functions to line and operational managers as 
well as increasing use of outsourced providers of HRD services (Garavan et al, 2020). These factors 
taken together have raised questions about the strategic role of the HRD function and of  HRD 
professionals in work organisations (Mitsakis, 2019; Gold et al, 2022).  
 
Theoretical Base  
The symposium applies the concept of role to examine the strategic contribution or otherwise of 
HRD/M professionals. This concept has been widely used to study the contribution of both HRM and 
HRD to organisation success for many years (e.g., Storey, 1992;  Ulrich and Brockbank, 2005; 
McLagan, 1989; Garavan et al, 2020). Drawing on an analysis of well -established role theories from 
sociology and social psychology we apply this concept together with that of strategic HRD to analyse 
the roles of HRD/M professi onals in North America, Europe, Asia -Pacific, and the Middle East/North 
Africa. This almost global representation and the comparative nature of the study is highly relevant 
to the selected conference stream.  
 
Purpose, Questions and Methods  
The main purpose of the symposium is to stimulate debate on reasons for failure of HRD 
professionals to achieve a strategic role in work organisations. Questions to be addressed are:  
 
1-Does success in achieving a strategic role for HRD professionals vary across four global regions?  
2-What factors might explain the lack of strategic role for HRD professionals?  
 
The symposium contributions will draw on the findings of recent research examining HRD roles in 
the USA, UK and the Netherlands reported in Lundgren et al, (2023). This will be supplemented by 
recent reports of international surveys conducted by the UK Cha rtered Institute of Personnel and 
Development (Peters, 2023; Overton, 2023).   
 
The symposium organisers will provide short presentations on the findings from these research 
projects and provocative statements on possible causes for a lack of strategic role for HRD 
professionals. These possible causes will include:  
 
1-Higher and professional education of both HRD and non -HRD managers  
2-Digitalization of organising  
3-National and organisational cultures  
4-Lack of evidence base for HRD policies and practice adopted by HRD professionals  
 
We request a session of 90 minutes for the symposium.

209 
 
Importance  
The symposium will be of interest and value to both HRD academics and professional practitioners 
in addressing a perennial and intractable problem experiences by HRD professionals. The 
comparative analysis of four global regions will provide data on the ve ry latest knowledge of the 
role of HRD professionals across the world  
 
Conclusion  
The symposium provides a rare opportunity to engage with an important issue for HRD educators, 
researchers, and practitioners.

ID:107  - Cultivating Talent Attraction and Retention in African Tribal 
Leadership: A Framework for Success  
Anna -Marie Pelser  & Keititeng Matlapeng  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
Talent equates to human capital, encompassing knowledge, skills, and experience. Fitzgerald (2014) 
sees talent as exceptional performers who surpass expectations. Numerous studies highlight the 
African perspective lagging, with Western dominance (Fornes & Mendez, 2018; Reisen, 2015).  
Additionally, African leadership, per Mbigi (2002), centers on culture. April and Peters (2011) studied 
Afrocentric paradigms emphasizing collectivism in traditional societies. Perkins, Shirley, Wint (2008) 
and Hanges, Aiken, Park, and Su (2016) explored l eadership through the lens of cultural diversity 
and cross -culture, highlighting the influential role of leaders in politics, the economy, and social 
aspects, serving as catalysts for change through their capacity to influence others.  
The African worldview, rooted in Ubuntu philosophy, emphasizes belonging, as seen in the Zulu 
proverb "umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu." Conversely, Western and Northern perspectives favor 
individualism, emphasizing competitiveness and sustainability (April & Eph raim, 2010; Mbigi, 2002, 
Mbigi, 2007, Mbigi & Maree, 2014). Japanese and Eastern societies also prioritize collectivism. 
Despite modernization's social changes, traditional African norms underpinning leadership remain 
slow to adapt.  
 
Succession planning should integrate with talent management (Rothwell, 2010). Talent scarcity is 
universal, impacting both developed and developing nations (Rothwell, 2010). Africa faces acute 
talent scarcity due to significant brain drain (Docquier, 2017) . 
 
Theoretical base  
The researcher chose a qualitative method to explore the topic thoroughly, encourage 
transparency, and capture participants' experiences and insights.  
The study centred on tribal councils in South Africa's North -West Province, specifically in Ngaka 
Modiri Molema, Bojanala, and Dr. Ruth Segomotsi Mompati districts, focusing on rural areas where 
these councils are located.  
 
Africa boasts diverse ethnic groups and tribes, each with unique cultures, languages, traditions, and 
social structures (Harahap, 2023). This diversity can lead to issues like xenophobia, tribalism, racism, 
and is compounded by the fourth industrial revolu tion with technologies like artificial intelligence 
and digitalization.  
 
According to James & Mathew (2012), effective strategies counteract turnover and promote 
retention (Kaye & Jordan -Evans, 2000; Hytter, 2006). Attractive strategies encompass employee 
engagement, upward mobility, recognition, Performance Appraisal (PA), car eer development, 
motivation, and competitive pay (Armstrong & Taylor, 2014; Dockel, Basson, & Coetzee, 2006; 
Hytter, 2006). Talent attraction and retention add value to the organisation.  
 
Talent retention counteracts the intention to quit. Talent in the organisation is perceived as 
individuals with human capital in the form of skills, ability and knowledge (Born & Heer, 2009; 
Cappelli, 2008). Furthermore, it entails the ability to learn and  grow within the same organisation 
(Dittmar, 2012).

211 
 
The meaningful inclusion and active participation of tribal communities in talent management plays 
a pivotal role. The involvement of the tribal leaders and the communities’ members into decision 
making fosters the local language, tribal language, cultural  values and ownership of the projects and 
programmes for sustainable development for the benefits of the communities but taking into 
consideration the ethical imperatives. Inclusion allows everyone to comment irrespective of race, 
gender, and status (Ranad el et al., 2018; Roberson & Perry, 2021,). Hence, it promotes gender 
equality and equity. The inclusive leader embraces change (Gotsis & Grimani, 2017). Furthermore, 
an inclusive leader promotes an inclusive organisational culture.  
 
Research purpose  
The researcher aimed to enhance the talent management field by crafting a talent management 
framework rooted in African tribal leadership principles. This study is expected to highlight 
facilitating factors for talent development and retention in the chose n area. Unlike existing talent 
management frameworks, which typically originate from a Western standpoint and focus on single 
dimensions, this research seeks to integrate the tribal leadership perspective.  
The Western perspective often draws from Western culture and experiences, which may not fully 
align with developing countries (Simmonds, 2013). This study's value is multifaceted. The talent 
management framework developed under traditional authorities can inform national policy, 
guideline, and strategy development, promoting transformation, system enhancement, and 
structural progress. It can establish a governance structure, such as a board of directors, for talent 
management under tribal authorities, in li ne with the mandate of cooperative governance to 
contribute to organizational value.  
 
This inductive phenomenological qualitative study followed the social constructivism paradigm. 
Data was collected in the form of focus group discussion using a designed interview guide with a 
structured questionnaire. Hundred and four participants were interviewed from the tribal 
authorities including the Human Resource Practitioners from Cooperative Governance for 
Traditional Affairs. Da ta from group discussion were analysed using the thematic analysis 
technique. Four themes were generated from data collected. The study findings indicated that 
development of a talent management framework should be prioritised since there is no framework 
now. The participants indicated that the framework would serve as a source of reference for future 
generations. The contribution made to the body of knowledge was the development of a talent 
management framework for tribal leaders in the selected villages o f the North -West Province.  
The researcher also conducted a comprehensive review using various search engines, including 
SABINET, EBSCO HOST, EMERALD research database, and Google Scholar. The examination of 
articles and theses related to talent management from diverse perspectives r evealed a dearth of 
research on the African perspective concerning talent management under tribal authorities. This 
scarcity led to the selection of this topic for exploratory research.  
 
Research Question  
• How do African Leaders perceive talent management?  
• How effective is attraction and retention of talent from an African tribal leadership 
perspective?  
• What are the complexities of talent attraction and retention from an African tribal 
leadership perspective?  
 
Implications for practice:  
The framework will be shared with the house of traditional leaders for implementation and with the 
relevant department as a guiding tool and reference source. Furthermore, the relevant department 
will oversee monitoring and evaluation to assess the framewo rk's impact. Proper implementation 
hinges on the department's adoption of the framework, with capacity -building through training

212 
preceding its rollout. This research will contribute to knowledge by creating a talent management 
framework tailored to traditional leaders from an African perspective.  
 
Conclusions  
The Talent Management Framework was created with the tribal viewpoint in mind and distributed 
to the house of traditional leaders and tribal authorities for implementation to support the tribal 
authority. Tribal authorities will use the framework as a guid e.  A digital culture will be developed as 
an online learning environment to convey regional dialects, customs, and knowledge - intangible 
cultural heritage - for the purpose of digital transformation. Cultural repositories will serve as hubs 
of informatio n for upcoming generations as well as places to save historical artifacts. Preserve 
culture for future generations' co -creation, knowledge transmission, and exchange. Universities 
must examine the curriculum, rethink the one that will give the tribe's lead ers more authority, and 
create a new curriculum that will enhance the design of education.

ID:112  - Talent Retention Strategies within the Moroccan Context: A Case 
Study  
Sara Naim  & Jeong -Ha Yim  
 
ABSTRACT  
The modern business world strongly emphasizes talent retention, thereby incentivizing companies 
to maintain a competitive advantage through that crucial HRD function (Brown et al., 2003). As 
Moroccan companies are becoming progressively aware of the importance of talent retention in 
improving effectiveness, productivity, and organizational capability, digitalization can act a s an asset 
to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of talent retention strategies (Habachi et al., 2022).  
Retention is defined as the efforts made by employers to keep talented employees to achieve 
specific objectives (Frank, 2004; Ibrahim and Daniel, 2018). In Morocco, a significant concern 
plaguing companies pertains to the difficulty in retaining top employ ees long -term (Hajjami, 2020; 
Iddoub and Barzi, 2023). Approximately 50% of Moroccan talent are willing to switch careers and 
work in another country (Hajjami, 2020). The lack of advancement opportunities and enhanced 
quality of life, as well as an unpredi ctable work environment, contribute to the issue of turnover 
(Ongori, 2007; Al -Suraihi et al., 2021).  
 
While there have been studies exploring this matter (e.g., Habachi et al., 2022; Ford -Colin, 2022), 
little research has been conducted to investigate the key agents of employee turnover and inform 
actionable strategies that could potentially be implemented  by organizations, especially in the 
context of Morocco. Effective talent retention strategies can ensure better productivity and 
enhanced effectiveness (Al Mamun and Hasan, 2017). Therefore, making sense of the specific 
contextual agents affecting talent retention is relevant for Moroccan companies to design stronger 
HR strategies.  
 
By conducting a thorough analysis, this research is aimed at investigating the company’s talent 
retention practice to offer valuable insight into the factors impacting talent retention and the 
effectiveness of established strategies within the company. We opted to use the Psychological 
Contract Theory (PCT) as a theoretical framework to guide this study. The psychological contract 
assesses the mutual relationship between employees’ obligations, duties, and right s, as well as 
those of the employer (Silva and Weerasinghe, 2016; Okolie and Memeh, 2022). The research 
questions are the following: 1) What are the talent retention strategies in the organization? 2) What 
are the factors negatively affecting talent retent ion? 3) How do digital tools support talent retention?  
Qualitative research is suitable for extracting insights on unexplored topics (Creswell, 2016). On the 
basis of purposeful sampling, this research targets 20 -25 employees and HRD practitioners working 
at the Moroccan company. The data will be gathered via semi -structured interviews and a review of 
documentation related to talent retention. The data will then be analyzed through a thematic 
analysis to uncover key insights following the seven phases of thematic analysis proposed by Lester 
et al. (2020).  
 
By tackling the unique challenges the company faces in regard to talent retention, this study can 
provide actionable insight that could be implemented in a broader fashion throughout the 
Moroccan business environment. Furthermore, this research can contribute to the HRD field by 
providing a nuanced understanding of employee retention strategies within a specific 
organizational and cultural context.

ID:121  - A Case Study: Investigating the Intersection of National Culture and 
Religiosity and its Impact on Employee Behavior in a Moroccan Public 
University  
Oumaima Tati  & Jeong -Ha Yim  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Hofstede's 1980 definition of culture as "the collective programming of the mind that distinguishes 
one group’s members from others" laid the foundation for a comprehensive model comprising 
power distance, individualism, masculinity, and uncertainty avoida nce. Two additional dimensions 
(long -term and indulgence) were added (Hofstede et al., 2010) after research involving IBM 
employees.  
 
While Hofstede's dimensions offer valuable insights into HRD, explaining the influence of national 
culture on behavior and organizational tendencies (Louahabi et al., 2020), they fall short of 
capturing culture’s complexities (Ailon, 2008). Further researc h is needed to unravel the intricate 
interplay among culture, human behaviors, and HRD practices (Najera, 2008). Scholars advocate 
refining Hofstede's framework by considering regional and subcultural variations within countries 
to enhance HRD strategies ( Balambo, 2014; Duncanson et al., 2016; Hennekam & Tahssain -Gay, 
2015; Louahabi et al., 2020).  
 
This study explores the Moroccan context, with Balambo (2014) using Hofstede's model to uncover 
unique cultural traits, emphasizing the religious factor. Louahabi et al.'s (2020) exploration of 
Hofstede's 6 -D model at the subcultural level reveals signific ant deviations from national culture, 
with religious factors playing a key role in shaping workplace dynamics.  
Empirical studies on Moroccan organizational culture through Hofstede's model are notably scarce 
(Aljayi et al., 2016). The diverse regional subcultures and the influential role of religious 
characteristics in Morocco pose challenges in applying Hofstede’s  model (Balambo, 2014; Louahabi 
et al., 2020).  
 
This paper qualitatively explores Moroccan culture’s impact on employee behaviors, focusing on the 
administrative staff at a public university. The study examines the interplay of national culture, 
particularly the religiosity factor, on organizational beh avior. Rooted in Hofstede's six cultural 
dimensions (Hofstede et al., 2010) and enriched by the religious dimension emphasized by Balambo 
(2014), this research transcends existing limitations, providing a nuanced understanding of 
additional cultural dimens ions.  
 
The research design prioritizes selecting diverse administrative staff for a comprehensive 
perspective (Johnson et al., 2021; Brown & Martinez, 2022; Lichtman, 2023). This group's 
representation spans various job levels, genders, ages, and regions, offerin g insights into cultural 
dynamics within the public university. As key participants in organizational operations, the 
administrative staff plays a crucial role in understanding the intersections of culture, religiosity, and 
workplace behavior.  
 
The chosen methodology employs semi -structured interviews and field observations as primary 
data collection methods, using thematic analysis for in -depth exploration. This approach facilitates 
understanding participants' experiences, perceptions, and behaviors within the organizational 
setting. Rigorous confidentiality measures, including consent forms, pseudonyms, secure data 
storage, and researcher -only a ccess (Merriam & Tisdell, 2016), maintain participant privacy. 
Furthermore, the independent recruitment process, individual contact for participation consent,

215 
and a commitment to unbiased evaluation aim to cultivate a safe and trustworthy environment for 
honest input.  
 
This research holds the potential to offer comprehensive insights for enhancing work conditions, 
particularly in culturally diverse businesses. It also aims to provide insight into culture’s deep impact 
on organizational dynamics, crucial for establishing peaceful, inclusive, and high -performing 
workplaces.  
 
Keywords:  Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, Moroccan culture, employee behavior, religiosity factor.

ID:172  – Sacred Threads in The Corporate Fabric :  A Review of Religiosity’s 
Influence on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises  
Diane Keeble -Ramsay  & Obinna Ejiogu  
 
ABSTRACT  
More than half of the global workforce relies on micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) 
since they constitute 90% of all business or employers (World Bank, 2022). MSMEs, act as conduits 
for the introduction of new technologies, operational knowledge,  and innovative products.  When 
compared to larger corporations, MSMEs possess the capacity to generate a more diverse range of 
employment opportunities across varying specialties (Khan & Khalique, 2014; Andah & Onana, 
2020).  The recognition of their pote ntial impact on socioeconomic progress, especially within 
numerous developing nations, including Nigeria, has resulted in a prioritization of the support for 
MSMEs. Within such countries, MSMEs have contributed over 55% to the GDP.  They further account 
for 65% of total employment (Akbar et al., 2018; Al -Dairi et al., 2012; Nakibullah, 2018). Further, to 
explore the nature of the role of successful MSMEs in the economic ecosystem, it seems paramount 
to identify any key factors that contribute to the sustain able and continued success of MSME 
enterprises.    
 
This paper originates from doctoral investigation into the growth dynamics of MSMEs in Nigeria.   
Adopting a phenomenological interpretation, it focused upon the approaches of  MSME owners.   
Adopting a Critical Human Resource Development (CHRD) (Lee, 2001 ; Gold & Bratton, 2014) lens, 
the study initially analysed exploratory semi -structured interviews undertaken.  From this initial 
investigatory review, Religiosity adopted by the proprietor was identified as a possible success 
factor for Nigerian MSME (Ejio gu & Keeble -Ramsay, 2023).   Acknowledging the cultural and religious 
landscape in developing economies, where religion plays a prominent role in daily life (Adeleke & 
Olabisi, 2018; Ogujiuba & Uzor, 2020), it emerged that further consideration of any inte rsection of 
religion and business was warranted.  Specifically, given the context of MSMEs, such exploration 
might offer valuable insights.  In particular, by unpacking how religious beliefs and practices 
influence and play out may have potential for consi dering resilience and growth potential of the 
enterprise facing environmental and economic challenges.  Through conducting an initial scoping 
literature review (Arksey & O’Malley, 2005) to investigate any intersection of religiosity and business, 
this pape r reports then on the discourse surrounding any relationship between religiosity and 
business practices.  
 
Scholars (Smith & Rayment, 2007; Koenig et al., 2001; Kimura et al., 2012; Lucchetti et al., 2012; 
Armitage & Keeble -Ramsay, 2015; Dias & Pais -Ribeiro, 2017; Panzini et al., 2017) across diverse 
disciplines, have considered how religious and spiritual cont exts influence individuals in their lives 
and work.  These works recognised that organisations have increasingly adopted management 
models which address employees' emotional, affective, and spiritual well -being alongside their 
material needs (Chowdhury, 20 18; Silva, 2008).  In conducting this scoping review, searches were 
conducted by engaging with academic databases (such as PubMed, PsycINFO, JSTOR) using 
keywords like "religiosity in business," "faith and entrepreneurship," "spirituality in the workplace, " 
to provide any landscape of current thinking.   Given the study was conducted in 2023, the Inclusion 
Criteria for this investigation encompassed studies in peer -reviewed journals, and conference 
proceedings published between 2000 and 2022, prioritizing E nglish -language publications.  A two -
step selection process involving initial articles provided the final selection of sources. The finalised 
selection considered the contributions in terms of critical insights into any religiosity -business 
relationship.   Aiming to identify common themes, patterns, and gaps, Thematic organization and 
analysis further facilitated the final synthesis of the research topic.

217 
This undertaking contributes towards the learning and ponderance upon the influences of 
religiosity and relative diverse aspects.  It discusses and considers this by contemplating business 
outputs linking discourse towards ethical behaviours, employee and entrepreneurial attitudes, 
alongside any potential impact of religiosity for possible interpretation or adherence towards 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).   The synthesis of current writings highlighted by this 
investigation identified the possibilit y of positive associations between religiosity with more ethical 
behaviors and/or businesses' earnest engagement in CSR initiatives.    By examining attitudes 
towards work and entrepreneurial intentions, it further questioned whether these potentially shap e 
decision -making processes, organisational culture, and employee’s behaviour (within the Nigerian 
MSME context).   Whilst revealing two significant gaps within the intersection of religiosity and 
business, it also explores whether religiosity impacts upon  consumer behaviours.  
 
Previous research (Kurland & Pelled, 2000; Weaver et al., 2005; Gatewood et al., 2005; Ahmetoglu et 
al., 2011; Duska et al., 2011; Treviño et al., 2014; Armitage & Keeble -Ramsay, 2015; Johnson et al., 
2017; Adeleke & Olabisi, 2018; Adelaja et al., 2018; Fa liagka et al., 2019; Ford et al., 2019; McKinnon 
& Murray, 2018; Ofori et al., 2018; Ogujiuba & Uzor, 2020; Nusair & Rosli, 2020; Ozer et al., 2020; 
Ndedi et al., 2020; Alshehri et al., 2021; Maidl et al., 2022) explored the impact of religiosity on 
busine ss outcomes, ethical behavior, work attitudes, and entrepreneurship extensively, yet this 
paper identified that there remained limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms through 
which religiosity operates.  Existing studies predominantly focus upon  specific religious traditions, 
such as Christianity or Islam, within particular geographic regions, leaving a gap in understanding 
how religiosity in other religious traditions and diverse cultural contexts which might influence 
business outcomes and beha viour.  This study recognises that further investigation is needed to 
identify further the specific mechanisms by which religious beliefs and practices shape decision -
making, behaviors, and outcomes in the business context.    In so doing, given potential for 
concerns of any critical discourse of religiosity within the developing country context, it considered

ID:191 - Female Entrepreneurship within the Chinese and Asian Context  
Dr TJ McCabe  & Professor Thomas Garavan  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Importance  
This study was prompted by calls to strategically promote female entrepreneurship in a drive to 
achieve sustainable economic growth within Asia (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2018; 
Mastercard 2018). McKinsey Global Institute’s (2018) report on women’s eq uality in Asia, found that 
the region's economic development could be greatly enhanced by advancing women’s participation 
in economic activities. While most studies on women in leadership have been conducted in a 
Western context (Cho et al., 2020), the Asi a context differs in several different respects. Cooke and 
Xiao (2021) pointed out that research has not kept pace with the recent growth in the number of 
women entrepreneurs in China. Furthermore, the economic impact of the COVID -19 pandemic has 
also led to large -scale unemployment and underemployment. This has resulted in many people, 
including women, setting up their own businesses and becoming self -employed. These 
developments all have human resource development (HRD) implications (Li, et al., 2020).  
 
Theoretical base  
The barriers female entrepreneurs face in starting or running their businesses have attracted 
increasing attention from researchers and policymakers (Cooke and Xiao, 2021). Tong and Chen 
(2004) regard female entrepreneurs as those who take part in the proc ess of building up a 
company, sharing part of its property rights, and taking charge of company operations. Despite 
shared characteristics across national settings, entrepreneurship is context -specific (Gelderen and 
Masurel 2012).  
 
Research also highlights important gender differences in both career anchors and work values 
(Haslett and Leidel 2015; Hardin et al. 2006; Dyke and Murphy 2006; Kirchmeyer 2006). Studies 
show that men and women differ in their entrepreneurial career aspira tions and trajectories as 
entrepreneurs (Cooke and Xiao 2021). The role of gender has unique complexities in the Chinese 
and Asian contexts, where traditional culture and religious beliefs dictate the inferior status of 
women in their daily lives and this spills over into the realm of entrepreneurship (Cooke and Xiao 
2021). The internalization of Chinese culture and beliefs has resulted in many women prioritizing 
family over career development. The notion that men are more capable as the primary income 
gene rator and women as the caregiver of the family (Cooke and Xiao 2021), has in some cases 
undermined women’s self -confidence (Cooke and Xiao 2021). Recent studies suggest gender 
stereotypes embedded in traditional Chinese culture hamper women’s entrepreneurs hip. Women 
in China take up self -employment for multiple reasons including work -life balance, personal career 
development and self -actualization (Li et al. 2020; Ng et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2019). Some women 
perceive disadvantages in self -employment and val ue job security more so than males (Díaz and 
Jiménez 2010; Haslett and Leidel 2015). Chinese culture emphasizes a preference for male as 
opposed to female entrepreneurship with many women viewing it as less desirable (Diaz -Garcia et 
al. 2015). This affects  the types of challenges female entrepreneurs face and their motivation 
towards business creation and development (Henry et al. 2016; Jennings and Brush 2013).  
 
Research purpose  
Our study is in response to calls by Cho et al. (2021) for further research and new insights into 
female entrepreneurship that include and go beyond the Chinese and Asian context (Cooke and 
Xiao, 2021). In exploring the socio -cultural barriers to female en trepreneurship, we intend to use an 
interpretive research design for this study. We will also use a quantitative, survey method in

219 
capturing and measuring specific variables relating to the sociocultural barriers to female 
entrepreneurship.  
 
Research Question  
Linked to the research gaps identified, we propose undertaking a mixed -method approach in 
exploring the following broadly stated research questions.  
RQ1 Exploring differences in motivations driving male and female entrepreneurship in the Chinese 
and Asian context.  
RQ2 Identifying and exploring social and cultural barriers to female entrepreneurship within the 
Chinese and Asian context.  
RQ3 Exploring the role of HRD in overcoming social and cultural barriers to female 
entrepreneurship within the Chinese and the Asian context.  
 
Implications for HRD practice  
Our study lends further support to Cho et al. (2021) who call for further studies, using mixed 
methodologies to uncover new insights into women’s entrepreneurship that both include and go 
beyond Chinese and Asian contexts (Cooke and Xiao, 2021). HRD profes sionals in both Chinese 
national and international contexts need to appreciate the role of gender and develop programs for 
aspiring female entrepreneurs, that incorporate and build entrepreneurial competencies.  
 
Conclusions  
We intend to use qualitative research, through semi -structured interviews and focus groups in 
exploring the motives of male and female entrepreneurship and examining the socio -cultural 
barriers to female entrepreneurship. A quantitative survey methodology will also be used to 
examine correlations and c ause -and-effect relationships with key variables identified in the 
literature. Our findings will complement and build on other studies on female entrepreneurship in 
the China and Asia context and beyond.

ID:212  - Supporting Coastal Community Resilience through Leadership 
Development and Training in Thailand  
Oliver Crocc o & Pimsiri Aroonsri  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper Importance   
Sea-level rise as a result of climate change is threatening 10% of the world’s population whose 
livelihoods and communities depend on coastal areas (Wahl, Brown, Haigh, and Nilsen, 2018). As a 
result, coastal issues around the world have seen massive inves tment, including in the U.S. 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes funding for coastal resilience (National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, 2022). This has also led research universities such as Louisiana State 
University to prioritize inte rdisciplinary research around coastal issues as a way to maximize 
societal impact (Louisiana State University, n.d.). Similar to coastal areas in Louisiana, Thailand 
experiences some of the world’s most complex and critical environmental problems, such as coastal 
land loss, nutrient and chemical pollution, and vulnerability to severe weather (Bridhikitti, 
Prabambroong, Liu, and Yu, 2021), which make it an illustrative and comparable example of coastal 
challenges (Fanh, 2003). Coastal erosion has a long hist ory in Thailand (Vongyisessomjai et al., 1996), 
which affects communities and wildlife habitats such as fisheries that are crucial for Thailand's 
economy and its citizens’ well -being (Nicholls et al. 2007). Even the popular tourism destination of 
Bangkok i s sinking due to shoreline erosion, groundwater extraction, and climate change (Olson 
and Kreznor, 2021), the costs of which will continue to be astronomical (Hinkel et al., 2014).  
While important work is being done by environmental engineers and scientists (Sangsupavanich, 
Chonwattana, and Naimsampao, 2009) as well as ecotourism operators (Tseng et al., 2019), thinking 
long -term about addressing these problems requires leveraging co mmunity -based efforts in 
leadership development and training around coastal protection. Building community resilience 
through training and leadership development is key to long -term sustainability and coastal 
preservation. Research shows that training and human resource development are key mechanisms 
for communicating the risks of climate change and ‘enabling pro -environmental behavior’ (Sadler -
Smith, 2015). While there have been vital contributions related to environmental education and 
training in Thailan d generally (Junkaew, Wongchantra, and Wutthisak, 2021), more work needs to be 
done related specifically to the unique challenges of community resilience amidst coastal erosion 
and sea -level rise. This project builds on my recent grant work in 2022 (NSF Aw ard No. 2226565, 
$99,869.00; PI - Christopher D’Elia) where we developed and evaluated teacher training on coastal 
preservation for a school STEM Program.  
 
Theoretical Base  
The theoretical base framing this inquiry includes (a) Human resource development, in particular 
leadership development and training, (b) community resilience, and (c) coastal preservation and 
environmental change.  
 
Research Purpose  
The purpose of this exploratory multi -case study is to understand the role of leadership 
development and training in coastal preservation and community resilience in Thailand.  
 
Research Questions  
The research questions guiding this inquiry include: (a) In what ways do environmental 
organizations in Thailand utilize human resource development activities such as leadership 
development and training to build coastal community resilience? (b) What do tr aining materials and 
organizational documents demonstrate are the mechanisms utilized in facilitating these activities?

222 
(c) How do stakeholders perceive the role of these activities in supporting coastal preservation and 
community resilience?  
 
Implications for HRD Practice  
Implications for HRD practice primarily revolve around transferability and lessons learned about 
HRD in coastal preservation and community resilience. If more could be understood about the role 
of HRD activities (e.g., leadership development and training) in supporting coastal community 
resilience in a salient context such as Thailand, this knowledge innovation could be used to inform 
new ideas and approaches for how environmental organizations in coastal areas around the world, 
such as the Gulf Coast in th e United States, can build resilience in their communities.

ID:216  - Climate Change Mitigation, Sustainability, and Green HRD: HRD 
Professionals Working in Disrupted Ecosystems  
Maria Cseh, Beatriz Coningham  & Mengying Cao  
 
ABSTRACT  
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest report (IPCC, 2023) noted that climate 
change is a threat to human well -being and planetary health and only thorough transformative 
systematic change that incorporates community ownership and indigenou s knowledge will we be 
able to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoid its dangerous consequences. The IPCC 
(2023) report also noted that to mitigate climate change adaptive governance, lifestyle and 
behavioral changes and innovative financin g mechanisms are needed. Mitigating climate change 
requires significant paradigm shifts (e.g., to long -term thinking, development and use of renewable 
energy sources, of circular economy, of sustainable agriculture and diet, etc.) and a shift from short -
term outcomes to long -term benefits. Climate change has the potential to disrupt ecosystems, 
economies, and societies in unprecedented ways and poses one of the most significant threads to 
sustainability.  
 
It has been eight years since the special issue on Green HRD was published (Scully -Russ & Cseh, 
2015). In this issue Sadler -Smith (2015) discussed the important role of HRD professionals to 
mitigate climate change by enabling pro -environmental behavior cha nge through individual 
learning and development, and organizational development and change interventions. Although, 
Jang and Ardichvili (2020) discussed the roles HRD professionals play in corporate social 
responsibility (CSR) and sustainability initiative s in multinational companies, the relationship among 
climate change, sustainability, and Green HRD, and the role of HRD in climate change mitigation and 
adaptation need further attention.  
 
The purpose of this conceptual paper informed by a systematic literature review is to discuss the 
relationship between sustainability, climate change, and green HRD, and the role HRD professionals 
play in mitigating climate change in organizations operatin g in disrupted ecosystems and 
economies in regions severely affected by climate change around the world.

ID:221  - Hospitality Management Strategy Importance of Human Resources 
Customer Cultural Awareness The case of the Asian Market  
Paula Tavares de Carvalho  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Purpose –This study examines the strategy of luxury hotels operating in Portugal concerning Asian 
Market in general and Chinese and Japanese in particular, identifying factors behind Japanese and 
Chinese customers’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction with hote l attributes.  
Theoretical framework – Comparing with Western, Asian tourists prefer the basic and practical 
aspects of service, giving higher ratings for variables such as “staff understanding your problems 
and needs,” and “responding effectively.”. (Tsang and Ap, 2007) . Expectations of hotel hospitality are 
influenced by personal factors (Ariffin and Maghzi, 2012). Compared with the Chinese, the Japanese 
seem less comfortable when they are not shown politeness in situations where they would expect it 
(Tao, 2013). Luxury  hotels should focus on staff training, cleanness of rooms and location choice to 
improve customer satisfaction (Chang et al., 2023).  
 
Asian Customers are not all the same and hotels strategy should take in consideration the customer 
country of origin to retain, attract and recover these customers and markets seen as very profitable, 
delighting them (Tavares de Carvalho and Reis, 2023).  
 
Design/methodology/approach – A three -steps methodological approach is used: literature review; 
1.354 booking.com content analysis of customers reviews, 501 questionnaires had been sent to 
managers, valid responses were analysed using SPSS (Principal Compo nents, Hypothesis test and 
Structural Equation Modelling).  
 
Findings – Tools of digital age (online travel agencies reviews) can be an useful tool to discuss and 
improve the customer strategy approach and to the development of Hospitality Human Resources. 
Findings of content reviews analysis reveal that Japanese an d Chinese customers are pleased 
differently concerning hotel attributes and it falls into six dimensions: location, facilities, room, 
breakfast, staff -service, finance. The hotels strategy is not taking in consideration the customer 
origin, having negative  customer satisfaction implications. Training to hotels human resources  in 
Asian culture (Japanese and Chinese)  should be made.  
 
Research, Practical & Social implications – Asian Customers are not all the same and hotels strategy 
should take in consideration the customer country of origin to retain, attract these customers.  
Originality/value – There are few studies made about this subject. This study contributes for the 
understanding of the improvement that Hotel Management should do if they want to attract and 
delight the Asian customers, confirming that the use of digital p latforms are a big help in the 
understanding of the customers ‘satisfaction and dissatisfaction factors with hotel attributes.

ID:225  - Influence of Status and Characteristics of Employment on Lifelong 
Learning Participation and Perceived Quality of Life  
Eun Keong Jung, Namhee Kim  & Fabiola Pereira Aquize  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Introduction  
 
Since the global business environment is constantly and rapidly changing, how to adapt to new 
skills emerging in the workplace is becoming a serious concern among organizations and nations 
(Darlinda, 2019). Workers need to continuously learn new skills and  knowledge to either maintain 
their current jobs or transition to better employment opportunities (Sarojni & Anh, 2023) and 
lifelong learning is considered an effective tool for improving their professional lives (Päivi, 2016).  
Although lifelong learning experiences are also known to affect the perception of quality of life in 
various aspects (Dion & Ben, 2011; Hammond, 2004), the experience of learning participation differs 
based on the employment status or profession of working  adults, and these variations in 
experience may also influence their perception of quality of life (Jonathan & Maura, 2002; Lee, 
2006).  
 
The purpose of this proposal is to investigate whether employment status and stability, and types of 
occupations influence participation in lifelong learning and whether those characteristics affect 
their perception of quality of life after participating i n lifelong learning.  
 
Literature Review and Research Hypotheses  
 
From an organizational perspective, the development of workers’ capabilities is an essential task 
through education and training. At the individual level, participation in vocational programs is 
common for developing current or future job -related skills, a nd lifelong learning participation is 
reported to lead to an improvement in the quality of life as well (Hwang & Kil, 2017).  
Human capital theory is a widely recognized economic theory that explains the relationship 
between education and quality of life. Human capital represented as skills, functions, and 
knowledge acquired over an extended period through education and training can enhance an 
individual’s productivity, and ultimately leading to an improved quality of life even though it does 
not account for all factors influencing an individual’s well -being. Adult learners often participate in 
lifelong learning to perform their j obs more effectively. Knowles’ adult learning theory (1980), 
Andragogy, highlights that adults’ learning motivations frequently stem from a desire to improve 
their careers or quality of life (Sung et al., 2015).  
 
The stability of employment type affects the learning environment of working individuals. Previous 
studies suggest that individuals with higher employment stability tend to participate more in 
lifelong learning compared to those with lower stability (Son, 2004; Yoon & Park, 2017). In contrast, 
non-regular workers with lower employment stability may perceive exclusion or discrimination from 
organizational learning experiences (Pyun et al., 2007).  
Lifelong learning has also been discussed in relation to quality of life. For instance, higher 
participation in lifelong learning is associated with higher happiness levels (Hwang, 2015; Koh & Lee, 
2014; Kwon, 2013) and lifelong learning participation cont ributes to recovery from mental health 
disorders and enhances the ability to cope with potential stress -inducing situations (Hammond, 
2004). Overall, lifelong learning participation and satisfaction may positively influence the quality of 
life and happines s.

227 
Research hypotheses of this study include:  
RH1. Employed individuals are expected to show greater participation in lifelong learning than those 
who are not employed.  
RH2. Individuals with higher employment stability are expected to show greater participation in 
lifelong learning than those who have lower employment stability.  
RH 3. Individuals with more professional jobs are expected to show greater participation in lifelong 
learning than those who have non -professional jobs.  
RH 4. Employed individuals are expected to perceive a more positive quality of life through lifelong 
learning participation than those who are not employed.  
RH 5. Individuals with higher employment stability are expected to perceive a more positive quality 
of life through lifelong learning participation than those who have lower employment stability.  
RH 6. Individuals with more professional jobs are expected to perceive a more positive quality of life 
through lifelong learning participation than those who have non -professional jobs.  
 
Tentative Results  
Analysis of data from Korea's Lifelong Learning Personal Survey (Korea Education Development 
Institute, 2022), a national survey data targeting lifelong learning participants, produced the 
following results, which are still in progress: (1) Hypotheses 1, 2 , and 3 were supported and (2) 
Hypotheses 4, 5, and 6 were partially supported.  
 
Implications for HRD  
This study can provide insights into HRD in terms of workforce training and education for 
organizations and nations. At the organizational level, training programs need to be designed 
according to the demands of members and promote a learning atmosphere th at supports 
individual development. Additionally, at the national level of HRD, we can learn how to consider 
employment characteristics based on our research findings when developing vocational programs.

ID:263  - Corporate Social Responsibility Strategies of Business and Human  
Trafficking  
 
Serdar Yener, Helena Belchior -Rocha  & Aykut Arslan  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Human trafficking, a pervasive global issue with an estimated 28 million cases of forced labor, is 
increasingly spotlighting the role of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in its mitigation. This study 
endeavors to highlight the potential of the business sector in combating human trafficking through 
efficacious CSR strategies.  
 
Utilizing a literature review methodology, we delve into the dimensions of CSR approaches that 
could potentially deter human trafficking. Our review accentuates references from international 
organizations actively involved in anti -human trafficking initiat ives, with a distinct emphasis on 
recent public ations.  
 
The paper is organized into several sections: a comprehensive review of human trafficking and CSR 
concepts, a discussion presenting CSR recommendations to counteract human trafficking, and a 
concluding section that encapsulates the findings, limitations, and further recommendations.  
This study augments the discourse by introducing a business perspective to the issue of human 
trafficking, a problem intensifying in both financial and non -financial aspects. Moreover, it 
underscores the escalating importance of CSR approaches in business and strategic management 
disciplines, offering a unique viewpoint on formulating and developing strategies against human 
trafficking.

Abstract  
 
The fight for social and economic justice has been ongoing in sub -Saharan Africa (Dwyer & Zeilig, 
2012; Joseph, 1998). Even after the national liberation movements from the 1950s to the 1970s, 
when many countries broke free from colonialism, they have been  plagued by authoritarian neo -
patrimonial rulers who continue to erode democratic principles (Diamond & Plattner, 1999; 
Fonchingong, 2004; Nur, 2015). Cameroon achieved independence on January 1, 1960. However, the 
country continues to be an illiberal demo cracy with flawed elections, corruption, reduced civil 
liberties, marginalization of ethnic groups, and inequalities in the distribution of resources 
(Nsangou, 2022). President Biya has personified the regime since 1982, subverting the democratic 
process b y changing presidential term limits and by changing the constitution through legally 
dubious amendments (Fonkwa, 2020).  
 
Political activism in Sub -Saharan Africa has seen many phases. Pro -democracy protests in the 1990s 
evolved into modern street mobilization or street democracy, referred to as “rucratie” (Sadovskaya 
et al., 2021, p. xx). This new wave of protest, also called the third wave (Nwosu, 2012; Nur, 2016), is 
known for using non -traditional protest methods highlighting the persistence of activists in 
protesting in the streets and city squares. More recently, the use of nontraditional tactics including 
strikes, nonviolent resistance, etc., combined with the intensive use of social media, has given birth 
to hybrid social movements with new s trategies to curtail the effects of repressive regimes (De Waal 
& Ibreck, 2013).  
 
Activism for social and political change has the power to create movements and momentum to 
effect substantial policy changes and even overturn authoritarian regimes. Given the social 
importance of political activism, it is critical to understand what motiv ates these leaders to engage 
in it, how they become engaged in it, and their experiences as political activists, fighting for social 
justice and democratization. Past research has predominantly focused on the structural aspects of 
the movements (Mateos & E rro, 2021) rather than on leaders, or on individual and collective 
frustrations as factors that motivate political actions (Bettache et. al., 2019). However, the lived 
experiences of leaders engaged in political activism has been largely neglected in the l iterature. 
There is little known about activists in sub -Saharan Africa, and almost none about such leaders from 
Cameroon. Further, there are no studies, to my knowledge, that have looked at how experiences of 
political activism can be different when they a re embedded within an authoritarian regime, and 
when they are engaged as part of the diaspora from a different country (Moss, 2019, 2020). 
Therefore, there is a significant lacuna in the academic literature, which this study seeks to address.  
The purpose of this study was to understand, through narrative inquiry (Clandinin, 2013; 2016; 
Clandinin & Caine, 2011; Riessman, 2008), the lived experiences of nonviolent political activists in 
Cameroon and those from the diaspora who are engaged in poli tical activism for democratization in 
sub-Saharan Africa. In order to conduct this type of methodological research based upon narrative 
inquiry (Clandinin, 2013; 2016; Clandinin & Caine, 2011; Riessman, 2008), 15 nonviolent political 
activists who took par t in change movements in Cameroon were recruited as research participants 
using critical case sampling (Patton, 2002; Staller, 2021). I conducted in -depth semi -structured 
narrative interviews (Riessman, 2008) via Zoom. These interviews were recorded on Zoo m and 
transcribed into text files. After reading each transcript, member checks were conducted (Creswell, 
2018; Miles, Huberman & Saldana, 2014; Saldana & Omasta, 2022). These transcriptions served as 
the primary source of information, with the interview d ata being treated as histories, narratives, and 
events through which the interviewees described their world (Gubrium & Holstein, 1995). The

231 
process of narrative analysis encompassed multiple sequential readings, each involving text 
annotations and memo writing (Josselson & Hammack, 2021). At each step of the process, I 
returned to the video recordings, and also listened to the audio recordings  to enhance the quality of 
the transcripts.  
 
The study challenges assumptions and stereotypes about political activism. By presenting diverse 
and nuanced narratives, it underscores the complexity of activism, dismantling one -dimensional 
portrayals and fostering a more accurate and empathetic understa nding of the lived experiences of 
activists. The findings of this study will inform political activists facing similar challenges. This study 
also provides the opportunity for the voices of political activists to be heard outside the walls of the 
repressiv e regime that they are often silenced within. Insights from the study offer policymakers a 
deeper understanding of the diverse challenges faced by political activists in Cameroon. This 
understanding is crucial for developing targeted policies that support and protect activists, 
acknowledging their engagement's dynamic nature and the evolving challenges across the life 
course. Furthermore, this study is a valuable resource for social activists, advocacy groups, and 
organizations promoting political and socia l change. Highlighting activists' experiences, challenges, 
and leadership qualities provides a basis for informed advocacy strategies and the development of 
supportive networks. Further, this study sheds light on human resource processes and practices in 
social movements, which is often overlooked in HRD research since social movements do not fit the 
description of a typical organization (Callahan, 2013), contributing to the HRD literature on social 
movements.

ID:100  - Exploring the Socio -Cultural Dimensions of Sustainability 
Consciousness in Nigeria  
Ufuoma Egbegbedia, Clare Rigg  & Adetola Adekunle  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Exploring the Socio -cultural Dimensions of Sustainability Consciousness in Nigeria  
For both the sustainable growth of Nigeria and the welfare of its citizens, sustainability 
consciousness is essential. It is crucial to consider the socio -cultural dynamics at work as well as 
technological and economic aspects to properly handle these difficulties. How Nigerians interact 
with their environment and manage  it is greatly influenced by cultural ideas, traditions, and social 
conventions (Okotie et al., 2019; Onyishi et al., 2021). Therefore, creating sustainable practices and 
policies requires an understanding of and integration of the socio -cultural elements that influence 
sustainable environmental development in Nigeria.  
 
Thus, drawn from an ongoing doctoral research into exploring the notion of sustainability 
consciousness in Nigeria through the lived experiences of actors and stakeholders in environmental 
sustainability. , Our paper proposes that as Nigeria faces the twin goals of meeting socio -economic 
development and ensuring environmental sustainability simultaneously to compete in par with 
other African and global economies. The developmen t of the nation’s environmental policy is very 
much dependent on its economic and socio -cultural efficacy into implementing and monitoring 
relevant policy infrastructure and an enhancement of the environmental knowledge of its citizens 
(Goldsmith, 1997).  
 
Another key rationale for this study is the conventional application of western solutions to 
environmental issues to solve African challenges. However as previously highlighted the socio -
economic issues facing most African countries including Nigeria are d ifferent in comparison to 
socio -economic issues facing the West. Hence this study proposes how sustainability consciousness 
can be contextually inculcated for practice among environmental sustainability stakeholders within 
Nigeria.   
 
Our paper thus in -depth explores the central research question of, “How can the needs of the 
environment be made a priority for Nigeria with the persistent socio -economic issues?”. As various 
studies have all revealed that the lived experiences of victims of environmental degradation have 
been under reported, the loopholes in environmental policies and regulations have been 
improperly analyzed, and a contemporary approach to sustainability consciousness needs to 
emerge (Agboola & Agboola, 1997 and Areola, 2 001).   
 
Using the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) approach is employed by the research 
(Smith, Flowers & Larkin, 2009) in which actors and stakeholders' experiences are analyzed. Data 
was collected through in -depth semi -structured interviews from bo th pre -colonial and post -colonial 
lived experiences of victims affected by environmental degradation in Nigeria, policy makers and 
decision makers in oil producing and processing companies. This was interpreted and analyzed 
covering aspects of environmenta l sustainability; sustainability consciousness and awareness of 
policy frameworks and infrastructures for managing environmental sustainability in the country.  
This paper provides insights for future investigations and policy actions drawing on Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) framework; Theory of Change and; Theory of Planned Behaviour as 
the theoretical lenses.

235 
It seeks to give a voice to victims of environmental degradation, contribute to existing knowledge, 
and advance theoretical and practical understanding on the subject matter of sustainability 
consciousness and environmental sustainability in the Nigerian c ontext.

ID:22  - The role of HR in preventing and managing sexual Harassment in the 
Egyptian workplace  
 
Hanan Shehata  & Stevens Madeleine  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The role of HR in preventing and managing sexual harassment in the Egyptian workplace  
Sexual harassment of females in the workplace is a significant problem impacting individuals as well 
as the organisation.  Studies in the Western nations have become increasingly prevalent, whilst 
academic research in African countries such as Egypt is relatively limited.  We belief, the lim ited 
studies could be linked to the culture of fear of speaking out in Egypt. In fact, by conducting this 
research alone, the lead author experienced harassment and intimidation from nationals who 
objected to this study.  
 
One of the most significant obstacles that victims of sexual harassment face are that certain 
organisations are hesitant to accept incidences of inappropriate conduct, and they may distort 
evidence and witnesses or refuse to allow the victim of harassment to access investigation findings. 
Although they may urge victims to speak out, they do not provide them with any safety to continue 
advancing their careers. Victims may also feel victimised and vulnerable in a hostile workplace 
(Ghoneimy, 2022) for example , there was a well -known sexual harassment case in Cairo in 2018 
when The Dokki Prosecution decided to administratively close the investigation into journalist 
Dandrawy El Hawary's alleged sexual harassment of his colleague, journalist Mai El Shamy, in the  
editorial office of the newspaper Al Youm Al Sabaa, where he serves as Executive Editor -in-Chief 
(Cairo24, 2018). This case influenced a further study to establish the incidences of sexual 
harassment in Egypt.  
 
This study analyses the impact of sexual harassment on Egyptian women by establishing the 
following objectives:  
• The incandesces of sexual harassment in the workplace  
• The impact of sexual harassment on well -being, job satisfaction and productivity  
• The role of workplace social support as a mediator in mitigating the adverse effects of 
workplace sexual harassment  
 
Data was collected through a survey of 366 Egyptian women aged 18 and over, using quantitative 
analysis through Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).  
From the 366 respondents, 72.4% of the females had experienced sexual harassment in the 
workplace.  The research indicates that 81% of respondents experienced adverse effects on their 
well-being with symptoms of anxiety and depression and reduced job satis faction and decreased 
productivity, as a result of workplace sexual harassment.  
 
When it came to support from colleagues who witnessed sexual harassment a staggering 79% 
stated that they would most likely not intervene.  
 
Theoretical underpinning:  
We argue that an individual’s social identity can easily be altered through a perceived breach of 
organisational trust when sexual harassment occurs and / or is left ignored in an organisation, 
moving employees from ‘in group’ inclusiveness to ‘out group’ by drawing on Tayfel’s (1979) social 
identity framework.  The occurrence or sexual harassment thus leaves victims of sexual harassment 
with a dissatisfied social identity.

237 
 
HR’s role in helping to prevent sexual harassment:  
74.9% of respondents expressed the need for a comprehensive workplace policy to raise 
awareness, prevent and address incidences of sexual harassment.  
Only a staggering 4.3% of respondents felt that HR was very helpful when dealing with their 
respective cases of sexual harassment.  
 
Organisations must take proactive measures to combat sexual harassment and HR can help to 
create a culture of a more inclusive workplace.  
Preventing sexual harassment is less costly, time -consuming, and disruptive than investigating and 
litigating individual cases (Abdel -Fattah et al., 2020).  Prevention is the most effective method for 
limiting the high incidences of sexual harassment.  
This indicated the need for organisations to establish clear and well -communicated policies 
outlining zero tolerance for harassment, defining reporting mechanisms, and ensuring appropriate 
disciplinary actions (Cochrane, Zeid, and Sharif, 2019; Ouederni, 2 020; Abdel -Fattah et al., 2020).  
High on the agenda for HR is to raise awareness of what sexual harassment is and to advocate what 
is acceptable behaviour.  Promoting a culture of support for victims will help raise the occurrences 
of reporting which is p ivotal in addressing the problem.

ID:34  - Intercultural Communicative Competence in Virtual and Face -to-Face 
Teamwork  
Katul Yousef  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The COVID -19 pandemic has elevated the significance of virtual teams, creating a need to explore 
cultural diversity transformation in virtual and face -to-face interactions. This study investigates the 
vital role of intercultural communicative competence in the context of global, virtual coworking, and 
traditional face -to-face teamwork. This research uses a quantitative methodology to analyze 
teamwork patterns within culturally diverse teams. 133 questio nnaires were collected and analyzed 
using the IBM SPSS Statistics 27 program. The findings indicate that intercultural communicative 
competence is crucial for success in virtual teams. Proficient intercultural skills facilitate identifying 
and considering cultural differences during project management, enhancing overall team 
performance. However, the dynamics of intercultural competence in face -to-face teamwork appear 
more complex. The willingness to explore and understand the backgrounds of fellow teammate s 
emerges as a higher priority than temporary effectiveness achieved through intercultural 
competence. In today's globalized world, intercultural communicative competence is a vital 
workplace requirement across industries, professions, and geographic locat ions. The ability to 
comprehend and adapt to diverse cultural perspectives is increasingly essential for effective 
collaboration in virtual settings or face -to-face interactions. This research underscores the need to 
nurture intercultural competencies to f oster successful teamwork and cross -cultural understanding 
in contemporary work environments.

ID:13  - Block and blend teaching/learning: Impact on the international 
student experience  
Ross Kemble  & Laura Reeves  
 
ABSTRACT  
International students (IS) often face unique challenges when it comes to teaching delivery 
methods. The UK is the second most popular choice in the world for IS to study (Lillyman & Bennett, 
2014). Attention has been paid to the IS and learning experience  in UK universities (see Lillyman & 
Bennett, 2014). These experiences highlight challenges such as language barriers, writing in a 
second language (Evans & Stevenson, 2011) and cultural differences (Huang, 2012). In addition, 
there has been some attention on the issues for IS when faced with new approaches to 
teaching/learning (e.g., Carroll, 2014).  
 
One new approach to teaching/learning is block and blend. Block teaching is a mode of learning 
where courses are structured so that students engage with a single module at a time. Whilst not a 
new development in HE, with intensive course existing in many g uises across FE and HE sectors, a 
block mode of teaching/learning has been trialled more recently in UK institutions (e.g., Liverpool 
John Moores, The University of Bedfordshire, Manchester Metropolitan University). These trials 
were met with some practica l concerns around timetabling, staff fatigue and the limited time for 
reflection upon teaching delivery and materials (Buck & Tyrrell, 2022). However, on a more positive 
note, block teaching can be seen as a useful transition tool and helpful in promoting continuous 
learning experiences.  
 
Whereas blended learning can be identified as an umbrella term describing ‘the use of technology 
in education settings’ within delivery of courses and/or curriculum (Buck & Tyrell, 2022 p.1080). Its 
rapid growth, triggered by the COVID -19 pandemic, saw a m ass shift to online learning. To begin 
with the Wonkhe and Pearson (2020) student expectation survey highlighted how students 
experienced wellbeing and practical difficulties because of the transition to online learning, and the 
survey envisages this to co ntinue. However, 80% of students also agree that they would like to 
continue some form of blended teaching/learning experiences due to the flexibility of virtual 
learning. Since the COVID -19 pandemic blended learning is more of a permanent and strategic 
change across HE, because it creates greater accessibility, new ways of widening participation and 
can facilitate improved student engagement with learning (Buck & Tyrrell, 2022). However, there is 
little understanding on how block and blended approaches to teaching/learning impact on the IS 
experience.  
 
This paper aims to explore the impact block and blend teaching has on the IS experience. The 
University of XXXX adopts a block and blend approach to teaching, where full -time undergraduate 
courses are typically delivered through 12 -week modules of learning  and assessment. Using The 
University of XXXX as a case study from a pilot study, 10 -15 semi -structured interviews have been 
conducted with IS who study at the University. The paper will show the impact block and blend has 
on the learning and teaching expe rience for international studies compared to traditional forms of 
teaching. It will conclude by considering what can be done to support the IS in block and blend 
settings.

ID:16  - Teaching Research Methods in HRD: New Directions and Opportunities  
Valerie Anderson, Rita Fontinha, Henriette Lundgren, Rob Poell  & Mark 
Saunders  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Abstract / Workshop outline  
 
1. Workshop importance  
The ability to carry out robust research is a central component of HRD. Evidence based practice 
relies on practitioners who are able to identify good quality research and know how to apply 
findings impactfully in their practice.  Research methods training and the requirement for a 
dissertation or research project are core to Masters and Doctorate level qualifications.  
Pedagogy, in relation research methods, involves an interaction between learning and teaching 
practices, and educators’ underlying beliefs and values regarding how both learning and research 
can and should occur and does, occur. Most higher education pedag ogy in HRD is grounded in 
theories of experiential learning (Yeo & Marquart, 2015), reflective learning (Tomozumi Nakamura 
and Yorks, 2011) and inquiry -based or action learning (Yeo & Gold, 2011). However, many students 
struggle with this feature of their professional development and many educators find that a 
research methods pedagogy, appropriate to meet the wide range of learning needs and 
backgrounds of an increasingly diverse student population, is challenging to develop.  
 
2. Workshop aim and purpose  
The aim of this workshop is to generate practice sharing stories from everyone who attends 
focused on successes, challenges, and opportunities for learning and teaching research methods in 
contemporary contexts.  
This knowledge sharing session will be followed by the opportunity to contribute to a research 
methods teaching resource listing that will be circulated to participants after the workshop  
 
3. Workshop process  
1. The workshop will begin with short facilitator introductions and brief reflections around the 
question: How did I learn to be a competent researcher and what struggles did I encounter in this 
process?  
2. A structured but impromptu networking process will take place to enable participants to meet 
others who they do not know and share their reflections on the challenges and opportunities facing 
RM learners and (as appropriate) RM teachers these days?  
3. Following feedback of main themes / issues from this process, participants will engage in 
breakout groups to discuss RM teaching opportunities and issues in more depth by sharing stories 
of positive critical incidents; highlighting new RM teaching and lear ning opportunities they have 
encountered recently, and any other ‘lightbulb moments’ relevant to teaching and learning research 
methods   
4. The workshop will conclude with a plenary -style session to share key points from the group and 
provide pointers towards useful resources for teaching Research Methods  
 
4. Workshop facilitators

ID:31  - World Café: An Integrative Review of Empirical Studies  
Hyerim Cho  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The World Café is a widely recognized large group intervention for fostering meaningful 
conversations and harnessing collective wisdom. It creates a welcoming café -like environment 
where individuals come together to address critical issues. Despite its recognition at local, regional, 
and national levels as a promising approach to problem -solving, there has been limited scholarly 
attention on the World Café within the HRD field. This paper adopted an integrative literature 
review method to identify key insights from the World Cafe literature and suggest how the World 
Café research and practice should proceed. The review included 79 empirical articles highlighting a 
growing body of research on the World Café, particularly in English -speaking countries. Principal 
findings emphasized the diverse applications of the World Café and its positive impac ts on 
participants and organizers. The roles of café hosts and table hosts and strategies for conducting 
Virtual Cafés were examined. Despite its strengths, the review also acknowledged limitations, 
suggesting potential mitigation strategies. This review c ontributes valuable insights for HRD 
research and practice by highlighting the World Café's applicability, effectiveness, and areas for 
improvement.

ID:36  - Working paper: Developing a new framework for organisational 
performance in the post -pandemic world: A study of German Corporates  
Annika Hesse  & Lynn Nichol  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance   
The post pandemic normal of hybrid working was predicted by some (Alipour et al., 2020; Bianchi -
Weinand and Wannöffel, 2022), hoped for by others (Speck, 2022) and is not completely researched 
(Sekhar and Patwardhan, 2023; Verma et al., 2023). This working  paper focuses on developing 
appropriate frameworks to enable individual and organisational performance in the context of 
specific labour law by sharing the preliminary findings of an ongoing study in German Corporates.  
  
Theoretical base  
Hybrid work has become an integral part of today's professional life (Flüter -Hoffmann and Stettes, 
2022). The challenge for employees and employers is to find a good balance between working in the 
office and from home - with the aim of ensuring and strengt hening the performance of the 
individual as well as the overall organisational performance (Lee and Gascó -Hernandez, 2023).  
Positive aspects include the flexibility gained, the compatibility of work and family life and the 
increased personal responsibilit y of employees (Boch, 2021; Schaffelhofer, 2022). Critics emphasise 
the blurred boundaries between work and leisure time, isolation while working from home and loss 
of control by managers (Burkhart, 2023; Von Bergen et al., 2019).   
  
Both advocates and critics emphasise the need for further research to create an effective working 
model focused on the organisational perspective. Two key models of organisational performance 
developed prior to the pandemic are the JD -R model (Bakker and D emerouti, 2017)and the 
approach of the seven (formerly 16) HRM best practises (Pfeffer, 1998). Both models work on the 
assumption that the interaction of HR practices and factors can have an influence on organisational 
performance. This study explores the appropriateness of such models in developing frameworks 
for hybrid working.  
  
Research purpose   
In order to investigate the ambiguities in previous research and develop a new framework for 
hybrid working the study will seek through a series of qualitative interviews and thematic analysis 
(Braun and Clarke, 2021) answers to the following questions thr ough the perspective of HR 
managers, general managers and employees:   
  
1. What do HR professionals perceive as the essential features of effective working from home in 
hybrid patterns on an overall organisational level?  
2. What do general managers perceive as the essential features of effective working from home in 
hybrid patterns on an overall organisational level?  
3. What do white -collar employees perceive as the essential features of effective working from 
home in hybrid patterns on an overall organisational level?  
4. Where do HR professionals, general management, and white -collar employees agree and 
disagree regarding effective working from home in hybrid patterns on an overall organisational 
level?

245 
Conclusions and implications for practice  
Previous findings suggest a positive link between organisational performance and teleworking. 
However, the majority of studies have not differentiated between the perspectives of the managers, 
HR managers and employee. The integrative approach will counter act this methodological 
vagueness, gain new insights specifically drawn from the German context enable the practical 
development of frameworks to ensure organisational performance and address the pandemic -
related paradigm shift in meeting employee needs an d the shortage of skilled workers.

ID:53  - Belonging, mattering and becoming: accelerating students sense of 
belonging with high -impact, meaningful activities  
Jenni Jones  
 
ABSTRACT  
Working paper  
 
Theoretical base:          
‘Education is not just about imparting knowledge; it's about nurturing the holistic growth of 
students. Belonging, mattering and becoming form the foundation upon which self -actualisation 
and self -efficacy are built’. (Gaunt & O’Hara, 2023). In terms of be longing, we know that students 
who make friends quickly are more likely to stay, to engage and to progress better and that a sense 
of belonging is strongly associated with academic success (Thomas et al, 2021), so the activity 
showcased here is a great way  to demonstrate how these foundations are built.  
 
Papers importance:  
This presentation/paper is important as it will show how Higher Education Institutions can build a 
sense of belonging earlier for their students and as a result, develop their relationship building skills 
and their chances of staying.  
  
Research/Activity Purpose:  
The University of Wolverhampton Business School is well known for it’s successful Student -Director 
partnership whereby mentors from the Institute of Directors (IoD) nurture final year undergraduate 
students towards becoming ready for the job of their dream s. Looking for ways of extending this 
very effective 14 year partnership further for the benefit of developing a sense of belonging and 
mattering for our first year students, we developed a welcome week activity involving IoD mentors 
too, called the £10 ch allenge.  
 
This £10 challenge involves all of our new Business School students (approximately 250 students) in 
their first week with us being put into groups to set up a small business by creating a product or 
service to sell that week, with the aim of raising as muc h money for a local charity as possible within 
their first 3 days. Each group is given £10 to start with (provided by a local bank) and the hope is 
that students will at least be able to double this money; so we can give the £10 back to the bank and 
also g ive the additional monies to the local charity.  
The student groups are each given an IoD Director as a mentor to support their planning and their 
activities over the week. This year, over 25 groups of students were involved and they made over 
£1500.00 in profit, in just 3 days.  
 
Findings/Implications for practice:  
This high -impact welcome week activity provides a clear focus and holistic growth for the students 
on their first few days with us. It is an opportunity to work with other students doing meaningful 
work that is very relevant to their business degree. It is  a chance to find out more about the 
university location and surrounding environment. It is an opportunity to raise money for a much 
needed local cause. In addition, it is a great opportunity for students to make friends, settle in more 
quickly and gain an  early sense of belonging.  
 
This session/paper will share insights into how the £10 challenge was managed, the results that 
were gained and the learning gained by both students and staff alike. Having run the activity for the 
last 2 years, we have reflected on some of the challenges and have made some changes that we 
would like to share with others who may be thinking of running such an activity in the future.

ID:58  - Support and enhance learning communities al entrepreneurship 
education service through the focus group  
Candida Parlato  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The concept of learning community refers to the process that brings together (into a community) 
otherwise individual actions of self -training for common learning goals, Wenger in the book 
dedicated to processing of the concept of community of practice (Wenger, 1998) describes the 
different characteristics of the learning t hat takes place there context and more generally in the 
interaction with the world. He talks about :  Learning as meaning creation, Learning as identity 
development, Learning as belonging to a community, learning as a result of practice within a 
community. In the learning community, the key word is "Collaborate (co -labore) means working 
together, which implies a sharing of tasks, and an explicit intention to "add value”.  
Entrepreneurship education, is part of the theme, and has the aim of developing attitudes, 
knowledge, skills and competences in the participants, useful not only for their possible 
commitment in the entrepreneurial field, but in every working context and i n every experience of 
active citizenship . They are therefore transversal skills and skills for life. The aim is to create a 
"transformative" tool to educate learning communities about entrepreneurship, the methodology 
will consist of a contextual and stat e-of the-art analysis, implementing a SWOT Analysis (analysis of 
strengths), weaknesses, opportunities (opportunities) and threats (threats)) in progress and post 
intervention, using the focus group as a tool. The focus group can be a suitable tool to facilitat e and 
build a common and effective language, within the various  interdisciplinary groups, because it is a 
qualitative language -based technique; in which a group of people is invited to talk, discuss and 
discuss attitudes personal to a topic. This dyna mic of learning and change can be an effective way 
to connect and mediate between often contradictory demands regarding issues of environmental 
sustainability and companies.

ID:90  - The Circle of Life: The Development Process for An Online HRD 
Graduate Masters in Learning & Talent Development (MLTD)  
Crispin Boyd  & Ken Bartlett  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
“It’s the circle of life, and it moves us all, through despair and hope, through faith and love, ‘til we 
find our place”. From ‘Circle of Life’, The Lion King (Elton John & Tim Rice, 1994)  
In many ways, the following study on the conception, design, development and delivery of the 
University of Minnesota’s forthcoming fully online and asynchronous Master’s in Learning and 
Talent Development (MLTD) echoes the apparent themes of the above quot ed song - birth, 
opportunities, development, death, uncertainty and finally rebirth. And through the lifespan, it is 
relationships that define the journey and so perhaps the story is best told within those guiding 
parameters. In this paper, we present the development of this new graduate degree program in 
Human Resource Development (HRD) with connection of an applied pedagogical and project 
management effort within frames of existing research and theory on training and instructional 
design.  
 
There exists a number of studies that describe the characteristics and current status of HRD 
academic programs, in the UK (Stewart, J., Mills, S., & Sambrook, S. (2015), the US (Kunchinke, 2002; 
Watkins & Marsick, 2016; Zachmeier, Cho, & Kim, 2014) and glo bally (Kuchinke & Oh, 2006). Yet, 
there are few studies in HRD that describe the process of development of new programs, especially 
at the graduate level (masters and doctoral). While what we wish to present is firmly rooted in our 
own personal experiences  of being involved in the project from inception, it will also explore the 
academic program’s development from a local, national, and international perspective. The 
selection of local, national, and internationally analytical lens allows examination of cor e aspects of 
the current state of the global higher education market and more specifically to existing and future 
HRD academic program development and operation in theory and practice.  
The overall theoretical frame for this study of the development of a new graduate online HRD 
degree program draws from established models for curriculum design in training and instructional 
design. However, and in support of Willeke (2011) who observed “th e industry standard for 
curriculum developers that is increasingly found wanting due to its lack of practical application to 
real world situations is a methodology called ADDIE, and represents Analyze, Design, Develop, 
Implement, and Evaluate.” (p. 2). In response, we sought to explore alternative approaches that 
would lead to a richer and more complete understanding of the process of development of a new 
graduate HRD program. The purpose of the study was therefore to examine the design, 
development, and de livery of a fully online graduate HRD program to provide insight for faculty and 
higher education administrators interested in this complex process.  
 
Birth & Opportunities (Analysis)  
With reference to the Analysis element of ADDIE, this section will explore the conception of the new 
program. However, the term analysis often is presented as a technical, bias -free process absent 
from influence. We suggest a wide range of hegemonic factor s including institutional policy, politics, 
and individual attitudes of those involved in program development play a role. Therefore, adopting 
the Birth and Opportunities label, this phase will be considered at the local level of the University of 
Minnesot a and will especially consider its relationship to the current state of the global higher 
education market as well as existing HRD theory and practice. Even before the pandemic, many 
different observers were openly calling for higher education institutions  (HEIs) to adopt more 
flexible approaches, including the introduction of more online learning in response to lower 
revenues caused by increased competition, higher costs, fewer endowments and external aid,

250 
dwindling enrolments and a public, certainly in the US, which is increasingly questioning the overall 
value and opportunity, traditionally associated with higher education. It will also consider the birth 
of the program in response to recent calls for HRD to forge new directions in its own identity (e.g. 
Torraco, 2019).  
 
Development, Death and Uncertainty (Design and Development)  
This section will explore how the MLTD program came into being and will use the Development and 
Design phases of ADDIE, not just to describe the processes involved but also how the model was 
used to create new material required for each of the core courses  within the new program. Again, 
the Design and Development stages of ADDIE are usually presented as separate from elements 
such as human emotion, attitudes, and behavior of those involved in curriculum and program 
design. In our case, and integral to this part of the process was our recently departed colleague and 
friend, Dr David Christensen, whose unexpected death in February 2023 brought not only profound 
sadness to us all, but also great uncertainty as to the future of the program. This unexpected event  
showed how leaders of curriculum development efforts play multiple roles and how their departure 
(e.g., death, turnover, promotion to another project) can impact in numerous significant ways.  
 
Rebirth (Implementation)  
Despite the sadness and uncertainty brought about by our colleague’s passing and with the 
persistence and determination which embodied his many personal qualities, the program 
continued its development. In this section, we detail the implementation phase o f the program 
which will include a discussion about how learners were recruited to the new program, as well as 
the content of the first two courses on the program.   
 
Evaluation  
The new program will launch officially in January 2024 with its first cohort of students recruited 
from around the world. We hope to be able to share further reflections on the delivery and 
evaluation of the program as it progresses through its circle of life, but for the purposes of this 
proposal and inline with current thinking about needing to consider evaluation at every stage of the 
ADDIE model, we  will offer some observations about this aspect of the program development. 
Ultimately, this study will highlight why and how the MLTD was conceived, designed and 
implemented with lessons learned to guide other HRD academic programs interested in consideri ng 
similar new degree options.

ID:104  - Examining the Research -Practice Gap from the Perspective of HR 
Practitioners: A Qualitative Study  
Kelly Moore  & Yonjoo Cho  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This study on the research -practice gap was motivated by the first author’s reflection on her 
extensive human resources leadership role, spanning three decades in the manufacturing sector. 
As a home -grown HR practitioner shaped by one -on-one mentoring and internal promotions, her 
missed opportunities to apply HRD research in her career moved her to examine extant literature 
on the topic. Research on the research -to-practice gap (e.g., Beer, 2020; Bleijenbergh et al., 2021; 
Lawler & Benson, 2022) highlights the stark divide between research findings and their 
implementation in real -world contexts. This disconnect is evident in the HRD field, despite its 
objective of enhancing organizational performance through l earning and development at individual, 
team, and organizational levels (Cho & Zachmeier, 2015). The purpose of this study, therefore, was 
to see the current state of the research -practice gap and how to bridge the chasm between HRD 
research and its practic al applications.  
 
In this qualitative study, we examined the lived experiences of HR practitioners to gain insights into 
identifying solutions to workplace challenges and their perceptions of the role of research in 
shaping those solutions. Three key research questions guid ed our inquiry: what workplace 
challenges do HR practitioners face? What resources do HR practitioners employ to resolve 
workplace issues? And why, or why not, do HR practitioners use research to find solutions for 
workplace challenges? To address these qu estions, we employed a basic qualitative research design 
(Merriam & Tisdell, 2016) used to provide an in -depth qualitative exploration of the research -
practice gap through HR practitioners’ experiences in their own words. We used a purposeful 
sampling to s elect interview participants employed as HR practitioners with at least five years of 
work experience in the United States so that they can reflect on their perspective of research. We 
conducted semi -structured interviews with 15 HR practitioners through t he East Texas Human 
Resource Association (https://goethra.org/), using interview questions developed to probe HR 
practitioners’ perspectives on the role of research in resolving workplace issues. To ensure the 
study’s validity, we asked participants to rev iew their transcript in a member -check process. To 
analyze the interview data, we used a thematic analysis (Lester et al., 2020) with the help of NVivo 
14, qualitative data analysis software, and identified three major themes:  
 
• HR practitioners grapple with urgent workplace challenges: time constraints, recruitment, 
and retention  
• HR practitioners predominantly rely on resources provided by practitioner organizations 
(e.g., SHRM and the ATD), often bypassing research organizations (e.g., AHRD and UFHRD)  
• HR practitioners perceive research as lacking practicality, ease, and urgency in addressing 
workplace issues  
 
This qualitative study is significant as it aptly captures HRD practitioners’ insights into the research -
practice gap. Through an in -depth exploration of HR practitioners’ experiences and perspectives, 
this qualitative study yielded information about the w orkplace challenges HR practitioners face and 
their preferred resources for addressing workplace issues. Below are the implications for research 
and practice, emphasizing the importance of collaboration between researchers and practitioners.  
Tourish (2020) argued that research papers are formulaic, cautious, dull, and often unreadable and 
that academic writing often becomes a barrier as it excludes practitioners. Tourish’s critical 
observation about management research also implies the relucta nce of practitioners to engage with

252 
research articles due to language complexities and their preference for concise, actionable 
solutions. This challenge in the research -practice gap calls for research on the investigation of the 
effectiveness of various knowledge translation strategies, inc luding professional, organizational, and 
regulatory approaches. Future research agendas (Beer, 2020; Fisher et al., 2021; Gioia, 2022), 
therefore, include unraveling specific language and communication barriers, identifying effective 
translation strategies , and devising improved methods for presenting research findings that 
facilitate timely and practical resources for HR practitioners.  
 
To effectively address real -world issues, researchers are encouraged to actively seek collaboration 
with HR practitioners for a deeper contextual understanding of workplace challenges (Bleijenbergh 
et al., 2021). Collaboration between the two is pivotal fo r identifying and prioritizing research topics 
that resonate with the challenges HR practitioners encounter in the workplace. For instance, Gray et 
al. (2011) introduced the concept of mode 2 research, suggesting the formation of collaborative 
teams compri sing researchers and practitioners to address workplace issues together. Cho and 
Egan (2023) advocate for action -oriented research, wherein researchers and practitioners 
collaborate in investigating complex problems at work, leading to mutual learning that  can inform 
future problem -solving efforts. Subsequent research initiatives should delve into the mechanisms 
available and proven effective in facilitating collaboration between researchers and practitioners. 
These mechanisms can support the continuous mon itoring and evaluation of the impact and 
effectiveness of research on HR programs and policies. Embracing this collaborative approach can 
significantly enhance the impact of evidence -based solutions on the workplace (Brown & Latham, 
2018; Lawler & Benson, 2022).  
 
In practice, our study findings offer insights and actionable guidance for human resources. HR 
practitioners are encouraged to seek research that aligns with their organizations’ specific 
challenges, advocating for the seamless integration of research -base d practices into their 
workflows. Recognizing the intrinsic value of research and maintaining active engagement with 
action -oriented research can empower practitioners to make informed decisions and improve the 
quality of HR practices in their organization s. In so doing, organizations should foster a culture of 
research -based decision -making to facilitate such integration between research and practice. 
Actively nurturing collaboration among HR practitioners, researchers, and policymakers will attain 
the goa l of breaking down the research -practice gap. Such collaborative endeavors will generate the 
possibility of enhancing effective HR management and development initiatives (de Frutos -Belizon et 
al., 2020; Vosburgh, 2022). For this collaboration to happen, HR  practitioners should remain open to 
working closely with researchers, contributing practical insights, providing constructive feedback, 
and demonstrating a willingness to adapt research -based solutions to their organization’s needs 
and cultural context (B leijenbergh et al., 2021). Such partnerships will make research findings 
applicable and beneficial to HR practice.

ID:120  - Integrating Technology and AI into Teaching and Research in Higher 
Education  
Jeong -Ha Yim  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
We are entering another phase of the digital era, where technological advancements and full -scale 
use of AI begin (Levin & Mamlok, 2021). The field of educational technology has been researching 
how to incorporate technology into education and training (Luckin & Cukurova, 2019; Seels & 
Richey, 2012), and the in tegration of technology has now become the hottest topic in all fields. HRD 
is no exception. As an interdisciplinary field combining disciplines such as education, management, 
and psychology (Jacobs, 1990, 2023), HRD must be sensitive to the change and eff ective use of 
technology to improve performance.  
 
Many scholars have already encouraged the adoption of research methods using diverse 
technologies in the HRD field (Akdere et al., 2022; Yoon, 2018, 2021) and emphasized the integration 
of the latest technologies to support effective HRD and digital transformation in practice (Graßmann 
& Schermuly, 2021; Kim, 2022; Mulder, 2021; Yim, 2021). Nevertheless, few papers study how the 
latest technology and AI are used in organizational practice. In particula r, in higher education, 
Generation Z learners are already quickly adopting and using the latest technology in their 
learning(Wang et al. 2021), while many educators are straggling to adapt technology as quickly as 
students (Michel -Villarreal et al., 2023).  
 
Just as the use of technology in organizations is a still -exploring research field, the current state of 
technology and AI use in higher education remains a large gap in the literature (Zawacki -Richter et 
al., 2019). Therefore, this study explores the real ity of technology and AI utilization in higher 
education, focusing on educators. Three research questions guide this study.  
 
1) What difficulties and benefits do university faculty experience due to technological change 
and the emergence of AI?  
2) How do university faculty recognize and respond to students using technology and AI in 
their classes?  
3) How are university faculty integrating and utilizing technology and AI into their teaching 
practices?  
4) How are university faculty integrating and utilizing technology and AI into their research 
practices?  
5) What competencies do university faculty need to utilize technology and AI better?  
 
Qualitative research methods are suitable for studying underexplored topics where structured 
knowledge and theories do not yet exist (Creswell & Poth, 2016). Data is collected through semi -
structured interviews with 38 university faculty members recruited through purposeful sampling. 
Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed simultaneously with the collection. 
Several coding methods and constant comparison method are used to analyze the data (Charmaz, 
2006).  
 
As an adult learner and an educator of adult learners, it is important to study how higher education 
educators respond to the latest technological changes, the emergence of AI in practice, and how 
they utilize them in teaching and research. The findings of  this study will be able to suggest the 
direction of training for faculty in higher education to better respond to social and technological

255 
developments and equip them with the competencies to develop future talent. These potential 
implications of the study and empirical evidence of technology use in higher education will certainly 
contribute to HRD.

ID:156  – Collaborative Research and Learning and Development: An  
Integrative Research Framework and Associated Competencies  
Thomas Garavan  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Learning and development research is increasingly expected to support a variety of stakeholders 
with practical insights on how to address major organisational and societal issues ( Kulichyova et al  
2013). To address these challenges,  Bartunek (20220  has  proposed a solution  utilising  ‘ 
transformative -systemic -collaborative projects’. This arrangement involves L&D researchers working  
closely with stakeholders  to explore complex phenomenon and generate actionable outcomes ( 
Williams & Whiteman 2021). Th e L&D domain appears to be particularly well suited to provide 
actionable knowledge on organizational  and societal problems given its focus on investigating L&D 
practices and their implementation  in organisations.  Yet the reality is something different all 
together where L&D and HRD academics are focused on theory and discipline issues  and have 
given t he world  of practice a low priority ( Kougiannou & Ridgway, 2022).  
 
Collaborative research can be understood as an umbrella concepts  and covers a variety of concepts 
succah s engaged  scholarship, action research and participatory research and Guerci et al (2023) 
highlight that collaborative research can be focused on   technical,  practical and emancipatory 
interests.  while these different approaches share common principles they  do have differences   
depending on who initiate the research process , the partners degree of involvement and the focus 
on generating theoretica l knowledge ( Ellistrom et al 2020).  Despite the appeal of collaborative 
research,  it is inevitable that tensions will arise and is  significantly more challenging  than an 
approach led   by researchers alone.   This therefore explains where there are ca lls to better 
understand how to make collaborative research  work more productively.   
 
In this article, I argue that an integrative research  approach may provide an alternative   way for 
L&D research  to help bridge the theory -practice gap.  An integrative research approach is defined 
by Ellistrom et al  (2020)  as ‘ a collaborative research  approach  characterised by recurrent  
interactions and joint learning activities between researchers  and practitioners  in commonly 
agreed upon efforts  to study change and innovation on organisations’ ( p, 1520). The purpose of 
this paper is threefold:  (1) to introduce  an integrative framework into L&D research (2) to describe 
the lessons learned   from implementing such as  research  approach in three organisations over a  
period of 4 years and involving 52 interviews with multiple L&D stakeholders or  actors. (3) to 
address the skills and competencies that L&D researchers require for successful collaborative 
research.  In essence we provide insights on an approach to collaborative research that gives 
attention to theory generation and practice improvem ents,  leverages the roles of L&D researchers 
and practitioners who have different interests , responsibilities and competencies  and offers 
insights into the interaction processes and enhanced joint learning in research and practice.

ID:170  - The Mediating Effect of Innovative Work Behavior on Employee’s 
Psychological Capital and Adaptive Performance: Evidence from Start -ups in 
Thailand  
Witsarut Srisiwaset  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Work environments have long been recognized as volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous 
driven by constant change and technological advancement such as IoT and AI. But with the 
emergence of the traumatic COVID -19 pandemic, the environment has recently s hifted to what a 
futurist Jamais Cascio (2020) called BANI world where environments are brittle, anxious, nonlinear, 
and incomprehensible. Organizations need to adjust to this new reality and make sure that their 
employees are equipped with knowledge, skil ls, and behaviors that will enable even more 
successful performance if they want to survive and remain competitive in such an atmosphere.  
One of the key factors in determining an organization's success is innovation which could be 
fostered at an individual level through innovative mindset and behavior. Innovative work behavior 
(IWB) is the process by which employees develop, adopt, and imple ment new ideas for goods/ 
services, technology, and working procedures. According to earlier research, innovative work 
behavior is positively related to employees' task performance. However, task performance is 
typically defined by job descriptions and doe s not take into account employees’ ability to adapt and 
cope with dynamic and unprecedented challenges which reflect current work environment. 
Therefore, adaptive performance, a more recent construct which is simply described as employees' 
capability to ad apt to rapidly changing work situations has been introduced by researchers. It is 
interesting to investigate if, aside from task performance, innovative work behavior could also be 
associated with adaptive performance.  
 
Furthermore, studies discovered that organizations needed positive or optimistic employees who 
could thrive under the most trying circumstances to guarantee long -term business competitiveness 
and success. It is, therefore, more crucial than ever to develop  positive -minded employees and 
create a positive workplace. Among many factors, Psychological Capital (PsyCap), which is defined 
as an individual’s positive psychological state of development characterized by self -efficacy, 
optimism, hope, and resilience, might be useful to address the issue as it can be measured, 
developed, and managed to improve performance. Based on Broaden -and-Build theory by 
Fredrickson (1998) which posits that positive emotions will make a person more conscious and 
inspire them to thi nk and act in new ways, PsyCap may influence employees’ innovative work 
behavior which in turn could impact adaptive performance.  
 
The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationships among psychological capital, 
innovative work behavior, and adaptive performance with data collected from full -time employees 
working in start -up companies in Thailand through online questionn aires.  
 
The findings of this research will not only contribute to HRD domain by extending our 
understanding of psychological capital, innovative work behavior, and adaptive performance 
literature, but also provide practitioners with actionable insights as all variable s in this research can 
be managed and developed.

ID:177  - Using HRD to Develop a Model for Advising Non -Traditional College 
Students  
Kevin Rose  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
In the United States, the average age of college students across the country has risen over the past 
several decades (Goldrick -Rab & Cook, 2011). In practice, this is a result of the many degree 
programs that now cater to “non -traditional” and adult studen ts as well as the increased availability 
of online programs. These programs allow students who are caring for children, working full time, 
or managing other life issues to obtain a college education (Kasworm et al., 2010). Despite the 
astronomical growth o f this demographic of college students, historical support systems that have 
supported the “traditional” student have not kept pace. For example, student academic advising 
services are still largely focused on younger people with fewer obligations outside of the classroom. 
While some scholarship has been done in this area (e.g. Akers, et al., 2021; Roessger et al., 2019), 
there is a need to develop frameworks and models for supporting adult students in their college 
experience. The purpose of this paper is to propose a model for advising non -traditional college 
students based on a human resource development (HRD) framework. Much like HRD advances 
practices like mentoring, coaching, self -directed learning, micro -learning, and other concepts, I 
believe the fie ld of HRD can make a valuable contribution to the scholarship on non -traditional 
college students. Though HRD has focused on the workplace learner (Garavan et al., 2002; Park & 
Lee, 2018), they share many characteristics with the adult college student, I a rgue. Thus, an 
interdisciplinary model that applies HRD theory to college student advising could be fruitful.

ID:184  -Developing HE Assessment Practices in a post -pandemic world: staff 
development implications  
Christine OLeary  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Rationale  
The recent pandemic has caused a step -change in the way many institutions approach teaching and 
learning (Pokhrel & Chhetri, 2021), with an opportunity to rethink traditional models and explore 
the affordances of digital technologies in Higher Education Pedagogy (Navarro Cira & Carillo López, 
2020), including more a gentic assessment with the opportunity for choice and a multimodal 
approach (Silseth and Gilje, 2017) to cater for a diverse range of learners. The recent growth in 
generative artificial intelligence software such as ChatGBT has further challenged traditio nal 
methods of assessment, such as essays or questions of a more general nature (Moqbel & Al -Kadi, 
2023).  
 
Overall aim and purpose  
This working paper explores the implications of these changes for staff development relating to 
pedagogy in Higher Education, particularly in assessment design.  
 
Theoretical underpinnings  
Assessment as a vehicle for learning as well as a measurement of that learning. (Evans, 2013; 
O’Leary, 2014) should not be underestimated. Indeed, assessment for or as learning with a strong 
focus on the learning process and providing feedback as part of a  formative or summative 
assessment task has been recognised to improve achievement, and skills development, including 
autonomy within a social dimension (O’Leary, 2014). In addition, assessment for or as learning can 
play a role in improving assessment lit eracy i.e. students’ ability to engage successfully in the 
process (Smith et al., 2013).  
 
The emergence of generative artificial intelligence(GAI) is causing concerns in relation to 
assessment, particularly those focused on products e.g. written assignments and exam (Moqbel & 
Al-Kadi, 2023). Stobart (2023) questions the validity of evaluating s kills through traditional tests.  
Recent papers on ChatGPT express concerns about plagiarism and the authenticity of students’ 
work (see Rudolph, Tan & Tan, 2023; Kasneci et al, 2023). Moqbel & AL -Kadi (2023) suggest that 
Academic integrity can be protected through using alternative types of assessment such as: 
performance -based tasks, self -assessment, peer -assessment, portfolio and   teacher observation.  
Traditional assessment practices such as exams and essays will need to change in response to both 
the changing role of assessment, within the curriculum, and the increasing availability of generative 
AI. 
 
Methodology  
Based on a narrative literature review relating to changes in assessment practices post -pandemic 
within HE, including the impact of the recent emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence on 
these practices, the paper will examine key changes to assessm ent design principles and associated 
practices.  
 
In conclusion, this working paper will consider the changing role of assessment and the implications 
for professional practice within HE.

ID:185  - Process to develop business schools’ graduates’ readiness to become 
strategic, transformational innovative HRD leaders in the digital era  
Teresa Roca  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Pedagogic Practice Paper   
This pedagogic practice paper abstract details a learning and assessment process to develop 
Masters students employability knowledge, skills, abilities and attributes (KSAA’s) relevant to HRD 
strategic transformational leaders. Proposes developing high level self -and-other awareness, i ntra-
and-interpersonal skills, critical thinking, research, and market intelligence, together with a deep 
understanding of the holistic process of learning and learning styles. By doing so, provides 
foundations to develop metacognition, strategic and syste ms thinking, required by HRD leaders to 
make ethical informed choices, with digital era, challenges, and opportunities.  (83 words)  
  
  
The Pedagogic Practice  
Two modules designed to develop Masters graduates’ employability, providing authentic learning 
experiences and reflective learning - to identify, develop and foster managerial and leadership, 
capabilities, across programmes .  
One, delivered face -to-face, includes a residential weekend to experientially apply the key 
theoretical concepts to develop managerial and leadership competency, with problem solving 
activities, creative games, and business simulation.  
The other, distance learning using online technology, include lively discussion forums, reflective 
practitioner diary, career theory, range of experiential activities and in -depth self -analysis. Focusses 
on developing self for strategic career development,  for life. Highlights value on building authentic 
personal brands, underpinned by strong business ethics to promote sustainable employability in 
the digital era.  (109 words)  
  
What the learners do   
Learners embark on a reflective experiential process of self -discovery, undertaking accredited tools 
on personality traits, emotional, cultural and crystalised intelligence, motivation, and learning styles, 
underpinned by apposite theory. Culminating in critical and reflective analyses on the value of self -
other awareness, continuous -learning, critical thinking, and research skills.  
Learners also conduct organisational -environmental analysis, use market intelligence and research 
skills to match values, KSAA’s, and learning styles to make informed person -organisation -fit career 
paths, choices. Whilst, developing SMART career developmen t plans to achieve short -and-long -term 
goals. Frameworks learned to be periodically updated, to respond effectively to market and 
personal changes through continuous learning.  (98 words)  
  
Relevance to HRD  
This pedagogic practice is relevant to future HRD leaders, characterised by a good proportion of 
generation Z and Y, thriving on meaning and authenticity. To develop and engender authentic, 
sustainable value -driven personal career brands. A key facet of HR D is “enabling people to develop 
their employability, by facilitating them to learn about themselves to inform career choices, aligned 
to their potential capabilities, and motivations, which will ensure their flourishing in work and in 
life”. Ultimately, h igh-level critical and systems thinking, due to the ways in which human brains are 
wired, is best achieved, using a holistic process of learning, and experiential personal construction 
of knowledge, and meaning. (105 words)

261 
  
Evaluation: how have the students benefitted?  
Learners benefit from developing readiness to choose and enter HRD careers, tailored to their 
selves, aligned to targeted organisations in terms of values, KSAA’s, interests, and motivations. In 
turn, enabling graduates maximising the expression of their p otential, job satisfaction, well -being, 
and retention over time. (44 words)  
  
What are the results of the evaluation?  
Results with several cohorts, validated the proposed learning process to educate business schools 
innovative transformational HRD leaders of the future. Suggesting that thriving in the diverse, multi -
generational, complex, digital era, require authentic, s elf-and-other aware graduates. Equipped with 
a set of foundational knowledge, soft -hard skills, and holistic learning capabilities, which together 
with subject -knowledge, critical -and-systems thinking, promote strategic decision -making, enabling 
graduates to see/seize opportunities, maximise human potential development, organisational 
learning, and career success. (71 words)

ID:205 - Becoming change agents at University: challenges and opportunity  
Concetta Tino & Monica Fedeli  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
At the University of Padua, thanks to a professional development programme that started in 2016, 
has begun a process of change, detecting significant transformations within teaching processes. 
Contributing to this process of change were not only individuals, but also those teachers who 
voluntarily have chosen to follow a dedicated training path to be able to play the role of Change 
Agent (CA ) within their departments and the University Community. Exercising the role of CA in the 
Padua reality implies intersecting two trajectories and crossing the boundaries of two realities: the 
internal reality of the departments and the broader "external" r eality, that is the University 
Community. In this context acting the role of CA means operating in ways:  on the one hand, as 
facilitators, mentors and animators of innovation for colleagues in their own departments, 
generating comparison and discussion on  innovation of teaching/learning processes; on the other 
hand, as boundary spanners (Akkerman, & Bakker, 2011), as they are called to cross the boundaries 
of their department and their fields of knowledge to co -construct new sharing objects, made of 
practi ces, experiences, experimentation of methods and initiatives, in an attempt to contaminate 
the methods and processes of teaching and learning, as well as to open new perspectives within the 
individual Professional Learning Communities (PLCs). In fact, this  is precisely their role: to promote 
continuous professional development (CPD) among the teaching staff of their department through 
the care and growth of PLCs who can facilitate the transition from individual to collaborative 
professional development, cre ating a space where everyone can experience processes of sharing 
and mutual support (Cordingley et al., 2015), where everyone can recognize critical reflection as a 
determining factor that fuels and makes innovation and change sustainable, as well as the 
professional growth of teachers (Stanley , 2011). The construction of PLCs is recognized as the most 
effective strategies to promote continuous and collaborative professional development (Vangrieken 
et al., 2017), where the role of facilitators becomes cruc ial for the growth and evolution of 
communities. The most important task therefore for change agents is to promote the development 
of PLCs as the key to sustainable change within their institutions. The study, through a qualitative 
approach, sought to expl ore: (i) What changes in learning and teach have experienced after training 
as a CA? (ii) What challenges do they have faced within their departments? (iii)What elements need 
to be considered for the sustainability of a Learning Community?

ID:215 - Legal Issues HRD Practitioners face on Daily Basis; Dissemination of 
data 2010 -2022  
Bassou El Mansour  
 
       
Abstract  
1. Purpose:  
The purpose of this paper is to disseminate and report first -hand data collected by graduate 
students as course assignments starting from 2007 to 2019. Every semester, students were 
instructed and guided in a class assignment to interview an HRD/HRM practi tioner using the same 
unaltered questionnaire for 10 years. The purpose of the assignment was for the students to gain 
knowledge regarding some practices in the field of HRD/HRM as opposed to academic theories that 
are accessible through a review of litera ture and classwork. Class discussions took place using 
compiled documentation containing all the answers so the students could benefit from all the 
respondents’ practices.  
 
2. Theoretical Base  
Human Resource Development (HRD) has become a field of study and practice. In this perspective, 
HRD has developed various and multiple models and approaches for scholars and practitioners to 
utilize as frameworks. Theory is particularly important to a disc ipline that is emerging and growing 
(Chalofsky, 1990; Ruona, 2000; Torraco, 2005). While practitioners need many theories in their 
toolkit, scholars of HRD seek an encompassing theory to define and guide the profession.  
The following two definitions from HRD scholars capture the essence of theory and the challenge 
facing our profession:  
 
1. “A theory simply explains what a phenomenon is and how it works” (Torraco, 1997, p. 115).  
2. “Theory building is the process or recurring cycle by which coherent descriptions, 
explanations and representations of observed or experienced phenomena are generated, verified, 
and refined”(Lynham, 2000b, p. 160). Theory building uses scientific methods to analyze a 
phenomenon, an event, or a behavior.  
 
3.Methodology  
Every semester, students are instructed and guided in a class assignment to interview an HRD 
practitioner using the same unaltered questionnaire. The instructions to the students were to 
identify a Human Resource Development professional, a Training professional or Organization 
Development professional or any other person who can provide them with answers regarding the 
functioning of HRD in their organization (profit or non -profit). They had to write a paragraph about 
the title of the person to interview and his/her job as well as their organization. Students were also 
instructed n ot mention names or any other personal information regarding the person or the 
company. They interview the person using the questionnaire provided by the instructor. The 
students were instructed to record the answers under the question and submit the compl eted 
questionnaire via BlackBoard platform as an assignment. The questionnaire was composed of 20 
questions. Some of the questions were:  
 
1. What kind of qualifications a person in your department should have that would make them 
more successful in the HRD field?  
2.  How often does your department do training?  
3.  What challenges do you face during the recruiting and retention process?  
4. How often does your Human Resources Department, update training materials?  
5. Do you have any experience in training employees for global employment?

264 
6. What do you do when an employee has completed the provided required training, but 
remains incompetent in that skill?  
7. When recruiting, do you promote from within or do you prefer recruiting from outside your 
company  
8. What type of legal issues do you face on a daily basis?  
9. What have you found to be the most popular reward for employees?    
The purpose of the assignment is for the students to gain knowledge regarding some practices in 
the field of HRD as opposed to academic theories that are accessible through a review of literature 
and classwork. Class discussions take place using a compiled  document containing all the answers 
so the students can benefit from all the respondents’ practices.  
3. Data  
The data collected is presented as follows:  
Every semester about 300 responses regarding HRD practices are collected (15 students X 20 
questions). With an average of 15 students every semester during a period of 10 years (22 
semesters), the total number of respondents is 330 HRD practitioners or 330  questionnaires to 
analyze (660 answers). The following is an example of data to be analyzed by practice:   
• Recruiting and retention (challenges, courses needed outside HRD, internal hiring vs 
external),  
• Training ( frequency, training materials updates, needs assessment, global training),  
• Daily legal issues (training and disciplinary actions when an employee is failing, types of 
daily legal issues,).  
• Most important aspects of the job.  
• Performance improvement undertaken, turnover and design of motivation, most popular 
reward for employees.  
• Methods used in training (internet/online, teleconferences, face -to- face, handouts, Power 
Point presentations, etc.)  
The last question: “What do you think is the most challenging issue facing the HRD field today?” will 
be treated and analyzed separately as a non - practice.

Question 11: What type of legal issues do you face on a daily basis?  
          2010  Question 11:What type of legal issues do you face on a daily basis?  
          2016  Question 11:What type of legal issues do you face on a daily basis?  
          2022  
• Anything having to do with ADA, FMLA, or the perception of discrimination and/or unfair 
practices or decisions.  
• Terminations related issues, discipline issues, and dealings with the EEOC.  
• Traffic tickets for parking and accidents caused by our drivers.  
• There are lots of legal issues that HR department faces on a daily basis, for example, 
employment and background verification, harassment, information security issues, disability 
definitions and accommodations etc.  
• Privacy act laws, equal opportunity laws, fair wage laws, discrimination laws  
• When it comes to training issues, the two biggest legal issues I face are Fiscal Law and Labor 
Relations issues.  Using allotted money legally is a large part of this job, and if anyone has a 
complaint then LR will step in.  
• We deal with the Family Medical Leave Act, Child Support, and the local authorities if an 
employee has gotten into trouble  
• One legal issue I face is to not discriminate on the basis of gender or age.  Also, because 
some of the jobs are union, I have to make sure that all open positions are posted at least 5 days 
before hiring an external candidate  
• There are no daily legal issues. Occasionally there are cases of harassment or discrimination 
to be dealt with  
• Dealing with regulations with the FDA

265 
• Anti-harassment only  
• Typical FMLA discrimination issues from terminations  
• The only legal issues that I have to deal with are that the company is required to provide all 
of the required training to all team members.  As a company we are continuously getting audited 
for compliance  
• Enforcing equal opportunity laws, sexual harassment, and ensuring all OSHA required 
training documents are in order.  Most importantly I would say enforcing the health information 
privacy at.  It can be a rather daunting task at time                                                           
• It is not uncommon to have to deal with things like patient complaints of medical 
malpractice, accusations of wrongful termination, or problems between employees like harassment 
or negligence. Dealing with insurance and benefits issues, it is important t o stay informed about 
what is required.  
• Since we have much bigger global workforce and presence, many a times we deal with 
many legal issues with the country government officials we work for. Furthermore, in one of our 
outlets the NFRA compliances were not well adhered to, that did become a hu ge issue and we 
understand why it was so.  
• Safety is a big thing which must be upheld at all costs. Furthermore, adherence to OSHA is 
also another legal obligation that we take very seriously.  
• We do not have a daily basis legal issues but I would say that it is the issue of harassment at 
the workplace. It comes up quite often in the workplace.  
• Buying foreign goods or selling products all attract legal attention at some point of time. 
Food need to be approved and accredited by USFA  
• Lots of issues regarding confidentiality and issues like trade secrets.  
• There is a lot liability when it comes to worker’s comp.  
• Making sure there is absolutely no type of discrimination within the workplace. We have a 
strict zero - tolerance policy.  
• The medical industry has a significant amount of legal issues and should be a major focus 
for all employees.  I could start naming all the issues but could never including them all.  
• Many of our legal issues are tied to our acquisitions of other companies and the lay -offs 
associated with these. Also, we face issues with non -compete agreements. Our company is also in 
the middle of a 2011 government audit, so we are extremely away of a ll EEOC policies.  
• Claims of harassment, discrimination, working in a hostile work environment, Family and  
• Medical Leave Act (FMLA) compliance, and HIPPA (medical privacy issues). .   
• knowledgeable of legal trends at all levels (city, state, federal).   
• Quality of work, productivity, safety, and respect/dignity in all interactions.  
• Discrimination law suits are looking for inconsistent treatment of employees and classes of 
employees.  But there is a ton of others; wage and hour,harassment, co -employment, etc etc etc.  
• Unfair dismissal and harassment from managers, not always sexual harassment,  
• lack interpersonal skills resulting in the employees feeling harassed.  
• Termination issues are the biggest one.  Issues with wrongful termination, discrimination 
issues, etc.  
• Privacy laws and the new healthcare act  
 
5. Results  
As the workplace evolves, practices and theories interact to better serve the field of HRD/HRM. The 
660 answers gathered during a period of 10 years yielded some important facts and practices such 
as: Most respondents reported sexual harassements, hostile work environment, Anything having to 
do with ADA, FMLA, or the perception of discrimination and/or unfair practices or decisions. 
Terminations related issues, discipline issues, and dealings with the EEOC. Medical was mentioned 
in 2022 and not in previows years, while Privacy act laws, equal opportunity laws, fair wage laws, 
discrimination laws are common to 2010 ,2016, and 2022.

266 
In conclusion, the legal issues that HRD/HRM practioners did not change significantly from 2010 to 
2022. This indicates that the laws governing the workplace did not changed significantly over a 
period of 12 years.  
 
6.Conclusion  
HRD is an evolving field of every day practices that are deemed necessary to face challenges, create 
opportunities, and solve everyday problems and issues. While theories take time to  explain a 
phenomenon, many models of HRD are based on extensive practical experiences with development 
and improvement.  
 
7.Implications  
This paper has significant implications to the HRD and HRM fields as “HRD policies are closely 
associated with that aspect of HRM that is concerned with investing in people and developing the 
organization’s human capital” (Armstrong, 2006, p. 535) cited by  Matthew W. Hurtienne et al (2017). 
Theory in an applied field such as HRD is required to be both scholarly and successful in practice 
and can be the basis of significant advances.

ID:218  - Characteristics of innovator in the Royal Navy  
Thawanporn Marin  & Asma Tehmarn  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The Royal Thai Navy is responsible for preserve sovereignty of the nation includes rivers and the 
Gulf of Thailand and the Indian Ocean. The vision of The Royal Thai Navy is to be a leader in the 
region and excels in management. Thus, it must strive for ex cellence standard by being a learning 
organization and create innovations that enhance the performance for the benefit of Thai society. 
The Royal Thai Naval Academy is an educational institution that provides education and prepares 
cadets to perform their duties effectively in various departments in the future. One of the expected 
learning outcomes of the education program is to think, act, and be creative in order to solve 
problems appropriately (Education Department of the Royal Thai Naval Academy, 2021).  Office of 
the Basic Education Commission (2017) defined an innovator as a person who thinks, makes, or 
creates things whether they are tools or methods that meet the needs of people in the society in 
order to bring convenience in everyday life. It can be said that graduates should have a  
characteristics of innovator. Thus, education program should develop the innovator in the cadets. 
However, the characteristics of innovator in Thai navy are still not clearly defined yet. This study 
aims to discover the characteristics of by using literatu re review of published articles in peer -
reviewed journals and book chapters. Content analysis method is used to create themes of 
characteristics of innovator in Thai Navy. The benefit of the study is that researcher will h ave better 
understanding characteristics of innovator in Thai Navy. Furthermore, practitioners of The Royal 
Thai Naval Academy can use the findings to develop the education program in the academy to 
support innovators in Thai navy.

ID:238  - Towards a tutor supporting international students in'becoming' 
independent learners 'by developing assessment and feedback literacy'  
Dr. Chrisie Macneil  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Introduction  
A teaching and learning intervention designed by the module leader and, academic mentors helped 
support ISs transition to becoming independent learners in a Diverse UK university. This working 
paper describes how international students (ISs) during an info rmal workshop gained assessment 
literacy during tutor feedback, peer -review and academic writing practice in a Research methods 
module.  
 
Research problem  
The research methods module had a high failure rate in assessment for ISs compared with home 
students.  
The chosen IS population are Asian students from India and Pakistan in UK universities, students 
come from one -way directed tutor -directed educational cultures. Furthermore, post -graduate 
programmes students have less ‘adjustment’ time compared to undergra duate Degrees.  
ISs travel into university for formal lectures they often participate less in extra -curricular activities 
designed to support their learning and learning needs. Theoretical frame.  
The chosen pedagogy is students are not empty vessels devoid of knowledge but, are co -creators of 
knowledge with tutors. Nevertheless, ISs have different learning needs and, academic learning 
support matters to encourage their sense of ‘belonging’ within a  UK HE Institution.  
 
Research Methods  
The study included a small sample of students in the post -graduate Research methods module, 
evaluated through student feedback and, also assessment results.  
 
Findings  
The informal workshop gave students opportunities to practice their academic writing, gain 
assessment literacy and engage in co -determination with tutors of their learning.  
The home and international students shared cultural understandings during peer -feedback about 
their academic writing. The students transported their learning into feed forward between module 
lectures and workshops. This encouraged a two -way partnership bet ween tutor and students, not a 
one-way directed tutor learning process in the Research methods module.

ID:24  - SMEs – Does one size fit all? An Exploration of Learning within Small 
and Medium -Sized Enterprises  
 
Judith Woods, Martin McCracken  & Ian Smyth  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Papers Importance  
How organisations are categorised typically takes size -based definitions in terms of employee 
headcount, turnover and balance sheet. The category of small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs) 
is made up of enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and  which have an annual 
turnover not exceeding 50 million euro, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 43 
million euro (EC, 2005; OECD, 2023).  
 
With approximately 5.97 million SMEs operating within the UK (ILO, 2023 ) and accounting for two 
thirds of all jobs worldwide, SMEs play a key role in our national and global economies (FSB, 2020; 
Department for International Trade, 2020; ILO, 2023). Howev er, from an academic perspective 
SME’s are often categorised homogenously despite evidence of heterogeneity with ‘SME’ label used 
ubiquitously without an understanding of the differences inherent within the SME category itself 
(DIE, 2013).   
 
As Porter (1985) outlines, both small and large firms can effectively capture niche markets, while 
medium ‐sized firms are ‘stuck in the middle’ in the sense that they can be less competitive than 
their counterparts in either end of the firm size distribution. Conversely, other research has shown 
that medium -sized businesses can have a higher growth potential t han small businesses due to 
their greater resources and ability to access financing (North, 2011). In light of such clear variations 
in the ways in wh ich SMEs operate it is perhaps naïve and ill -informed to assume that learning 
within small versus medium sized enterprises is one and the same. With markedly different 
resource bases and organisational needs firms within the SME continuum are unlikely to e ngage in 
HRD in the same way. With limited research breaking down the SME definition (references) and 
exploring HRD across the SME size spectrum we are left with a significant gap in our knowledge and 
understanding.  
  
Theoretical base  
To help us fully understand the issues connected to this research we utilised two primary 
theoretical lenses.  The first of these was the well -established Life Cycle Theory (Greiner, 1972; 
Cameron and Whetten, 1981), which proposes that there are a series of ‘expansion’ stages and 
resultant ‘crises’, that organisations proceed through during their lifecycles, from an initial creative 
phase to expansion through collaboration. Although many contributions have augmented this basic 
theory since its initial ince ption, designed to add more practical implications for organisations in 
different sectors with a range of revenue contingencies (Flamholtz and Randle, 2007; Mosca et al, 
2021), the basic premise that an incremental movement is observed for organisations as  they grow 
through these phases has been consistent.  
 
In this research, the aim is to apply our knowledge of HRD needs and application to understand 
what type of training and development practices are most appropriate at different points during the 
organisational lifecycle. This is where the second major theo retical base for this study comes in, 
linked to informal and incidental learning (Marsick and Volpe,1999; Marsick and Watkins, 1990).  
Conventional wisdom would advocate that by their nature SMEs and particularly those 
organisations towards the smaller end  of the size spectrum, will employ more informal and

270 
incidental learning approaches vs interventions and activities which are formalised. However, such 
an assumption has not been addressed in empirical research and the nuances associated with 
understanding effective HRD and learning strategy, especially amon gst a range of organisations 
which range in size from micro (under 10 employees) to those at the larger end of the SME 
spectrum (over 200 employees) has received scant attention.  
   
Research Purpose  
With HRD research in SMEs having received comparatively less attention than HRD in a more 
general sense (Nolan and Garavan, 2016) and even less work conducted on HRD in firms of varying 
sizes along the SME spectrum there is a clear impetus for research tha t explores the nuances of 
learning within these contexts.  Eliciting a greater appreciation of the HRD techniques and 
interventions and how they differ within small versus medium sized enterprises has the potential to 
make a significant contribution to kno wledge in the field. Furthermore, value is also derived more 
broadly as we highlight the necessity of adopting a more nuanced approach to research within the 
SME categorisation and illustrate the limitations of broadly generalising behaviours and experienc es 
among firms within the SME landscape. Finally we offer insights and practical guidance on HRD 
interventions and their efficacy for firms of varying sizes within the SME context.  
 
Research question/s  
The ultimate aim of this study is to explore the nuances of learning within the SME spectrum and 
consequently our research questions are threefold:  
1.How do HRD interventions and techniques differ within the small/micro sized enterprise vs the 
medium sized enterprise?  
2.From the perspective of the firm what is the rationale for the interventions and techniques 
employed by small vs medium sized enterprises?  
3.How can HRD interventions be better tailored to meet the learning demands and resource 
profiles of firms within the SME categorisation?  
 
In pursuit of answers to these questions we are interested in exploring the application of qualitative 
research methods as both a means of understanding the complexity of learning within the small - 
and medium -sized firm as well as generate a more fine grai ned insight into HRD interventions and 
techniques employed by different sized firms within the SME category.     
Our insights are be based on 18 qualitative interviews among 4 case firms. The case firms in 
question are drawn across the SME size spectrum and interviews were conducted among 
employees as well as managerial staff allowing for a more holistic and multi -level consideration and 
exploration of the research questions posed.  
 
Implications for HRD practice  
Given existing research calls for further understanding of HRD practices in SMEs (Skinner and 
Powell, 2003; Nolan and Garavan, 2016), it is pertinent from the practitioner perspective to 
understand the full gamut of developmental activity as it relates to differences in firm size across 
micro, small and medium categories of firm size (Saunders, Gray, and Goregaokar, 2014).  Short 
(2019) argues that SMEs should not be treated as a homogenous group. Therefore, whether size is 
causal or merely correlative, a b etter appreciation of differences in resources, scale, and 
organizational structures as they relate to HRD practices is necessary.   
 
Conclusions  
Driven by a lack of nuanced research in the SME context and, more notably the assumed 
homogeneity in terms of the nature of learning and HRD among firms across the SME spectrum, 
this paper makes an important distinction and thus offers a unique insight int o SME learning and 
HRD. Focusing on 4 case study firms  we illustrate the variations in HRD techniques and 
interventions employed by firms at the multiple points along the SME spectrum.

ID:66  -Which Factor Facilitates  the Career Development of Generation Z in 
Small and Medium Enterprises? : Multi -group Analysis of Employment Type in 
South Korea  
Jaehong Joo, Dahyun Kim, MYUNGHYUN YOO  & Ji Hoon Song  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
An employee's career is a continuous journey marked by individual perceptions, behaviors, and 
attitudes towards task -related experiences and activities throughout their life (Hall & Heras, 2010). 
With a notable shift in focus from organizations to employee s in terms of career development (De 
Vos et al., 2009), the behaviors guiding their career trajectory, based on their career orientation, 
undergo continuous change (Forrier et al., 2009). Particularly, as employees subjectively interpret 
their experiences within the organization and derive meaning from their work, they actively manage 
and advance their careers in a voluntary manner (Savickas, 2013). Therefore, it is crucial to ensure 
that employees recognize their organization's provision of supportive reso urces for career 
advancement (Joo et al., 2023).  
 
As the concept of lifelong employment within an organization fades in many countries, welfare 
benefits emerge as a crucial aspect of human resource management strategy. Employee attitudes 
towards both career development and the organization are influenced by various workplace factors 
with their job fitness (Edwards, 1991; Uzair et al., 2017). It is important for employees to receive 
fairly the rewards for their efforts in performing their work and the o pportunities provided to them 
(Colquitt, 2011; Yanik & Gürsoy, 2015). Moreover, transparent HR practices are anticipated to result 
in high performance (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004; Wright & Nishii, 2007). Therefore, it is meaningful to 
examine the effectiveness of fairness in performance appraisal to employee attitudes.  
Employees perceive their careers as indicators of growth within the organization, and it becomes 
essential to shape a career identity rooted in self -awareness (Savickas, 2012; Valcour & Ladge, 
2008). This identity not only fosters confidence but also enhan ces adaptability within their careers. 
Generation Z actively seek challenging tasks and gravitate towards work that aligns with their values 
(Barhate & Dirani, 2021). Moreover, given their inclination towards a boundaryless approach to 
career development, when they perceive their organization as supportive of their career growth and 
find their tasks meaningful and challenging, employees are likely to believe in their ability to 
continually manage and develop their careers.  
 
Meanwhile, SMEs in Korea often offer less favorable working conditions compared to larger 
enterprises and are susceptible to future labor market risks (Ko, 2021). Furthermore, employees in 
SMEs receive differential resources based on their employment type (Cho et al., 2008). The quality 
of employees' experiences is contingent upon their employment type, considering varying work 
conditions such as training and development opportunities, and welfare benefits. In other words, it 
may lead to variations in caree r development behaviors based on their employment type.  
Therefore, to foster the career development of generation Z employees, it is imperative to examine 
the influential relationship between the limited support environment and job perception. 
Specifically, comparing groups can illuminate the antecedent factors  that play a decisive role, 
depending on the employment type.  
 
Theoretical base  
Organizational support is a pivotal factor influencing employees' job performance and shaping 
employee’s behavior (Zare, 2012). Our study focused on self -efficacy and adaptability from the 
perspective of career development (Lent & Hackett, 1987; Savickas, 1997). We also considered

273 
organizational satisfaction as an indicator of whether generation Z comprehensively feels positive 
experiences in the workplace. Among the determinants affecting their career development, we 
focused the organizational welfare system (Donahue et al., 2000; Jong, 2023), organizational justice 
(Murphy & Cleveland, 1995; Jawahar, 2007), and job fitness (Cable & DeRue, 2002). We applied 
organizational support theory (Eisenberger et al., 1986) and social cognitive career theory (Hackett 
& Betz, 1981) to theoretic ally discuss the relationship.  
 
Employees evaluate whether the organization adequately provides career support opportunities 
and systems. When they perceive their organization as conducive to their career development, they 
consistently invest effort with confidence. a fair system and pra ctices, along with a highly suitable 
work environment, deepen their engagement in career development. This study focuses on 
generation Z within small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Due to the specificity of organizational 
context and generational character istics, our comparative approach contributes to expand the 
theoretical discussion by integrating organizational support and career theory.  
 
Research purpose  
The purpose of our study is to provide customized career development interventions for 
employees, taking into consideration their employment type in SMEs in South Korea. In align with 
the purpose, we examined the structural relationships between organizati onal support system, 
fairness of performance appraisal, person -job fitness, organizational and career attitudes. 
Specifically, we would like to derive the strategic interventions that empower employees, recognized 
as essential organizational assets, to pro actively manage their career and cultivate a positive 
workplace experience.  
  
Implications for HRD practice  
In the context of South Korea, characterized by an abnormal organizational structure and employee 
ratio, we anticipate that our findings will enhance awareness of career development among 
employees, considering their employment type. Additionally, these results are expected  to 
contribute to an overall improvement in workplace satisfaction. By exploring organizational factors, 
including the organizational support system and fairness of performance appraisal, as well as 
individual factors such as person -job fit, based on emplo yment type, we can identify the relative 
importance of these factors in shaping employees' perceptions of career development. Identifying 
these factors is crucial in aligning with organizational development strategies. Furthermore, by 
leveraging responses from generation Z employees, our study contributes to expanding the 
discourse on the career development characteristics of generation Z, building upon previous 
discussions (Barhate & Dirani, 2022).  
 
Conclusion  
This study conducted multi -group, considering employment type, to investigate the differences in 
the influence of factors determining the perception of career development and organizational 
satisfaction among SMEs in South Korea. For the positive experienc es of the within an organization 
to directly impact the organization's performance, it is essential for the organization to provide job 
autonomy and a supportive environment, enabling employees to proactively develop their careers 
(De Fillippi & Arthur, 19 94; De Vos et al., 2009; Mihail, 2008). Developing employees’ career and 
aligning it with the organization's values and goals is the first step toward mutual growth between 
employees and the organization. Although our study's context is specific, consideri ng company size, 
employment type, and employees' generational characteristics, we believe that our findings hold 
international implications for further research.

ID:83  - Learning Emotion in workplace learning: Case Studies of SMEs in Korea  
Seok Young Oh, Sehwa Kim, Hye Yoon Jeong  & Seongju Jee  
 
ABSTRACT  
This paper explores how workplace learning is formed and practiced as experienced by Korean SME 
workers, and examine the roles of emotion in shaping, sustaining, and changing work identities 
during the workplace learning process.  
 
Based on social learning and experiential learning theories, this study defines emotions as 
conscious and unconscious phenomena that are experienced in a specific sociocultural experience 
and psychic contexts and also defines 'learning emotions' as individual or group emotions 
experienced in their learning process.  
 
This study is theoretically based on Illeris' workplace learning model which emphasizes that 
workplace learning takes place with emotions, perceived learning content, and work practices in a 
sociocultural context, and assumes that learning emotions play an  important role in shaping, 
maintaining, and changing work identities. Work identities represent the degree to which a person 
internalizes characteristic features of the social entity into their self -concept at work. And it is also 
an important prerequisit e, constituent, and outcome of agency which refers to the idea that people 
act intentionally within a given framework, rather than being completely autonomous or simply 
determined by external factors. It allows people to have partial influence over their e nvironment 
and life course.  
 
Therefore, we conducted in -depth interviews with SME workers to explore the factors and contexts 
in which learning emotions arise.  
Interviews were conducted with employees from 8 SMEs in South Korea to explore the connection 
between organizational emotions and the development and sustainability of occupational identities. 
The findings of the study reveal that transformative changes, s uch as shifts in work dynamics due to 
the COVID -19 pandemic, sales growth, business restructuring, workplace relocations, and the 
introduction of new policies, evoke learning emotions. These transformations result in shifts in 
individual roles, authority s tructures, relationships, and the political dynamics within the 
organization, prompting individuals to engage in organizational learning as a coping mechanism. 
The positive or negative emotions from this adaptive process not only contribute to the 
establis hment of a clearer occupational identity but also foster identity fusion and job satisfaction 
within the organization.

ID:110  - Leaders' learning experiences and knowledge transfer in a SME leader 
training program: a case study of SME in the Thai Chamber of Commerce 
2022 –2023  
Manu Markmanee  & Pawinee Petchsawang  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This paper aims to explore SME leaders’ learning experiences and knowledge transfer in a SME 
leader development training program. Prior research has predominantly focused on the direct 
impact of training and development on SME performance, often overlooking the complex 
experiences and k nowledge transfer processes among SME leaders. The existing literature 
frequently falls short in investigating the dynamic of SME leaders’ knowledge transfer and their 
translation into practical organizational change and improvement.  
 
Importance  
This paper identifies insight into SME leader training program on how they transfer knowledge and 
translate into business results. The research findings contribute to the HRD field in terms of filling a 
gap in the academic literature and offering recommendation s for training SME leaders.  
 
Theoretical Base  
The study employs multiple theoretical frameworks. The (Nonaka et al., 2000) SECI model involves 
the transformation of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge. The model consists of four 
components: socialization, externalization, combination, and internal ization. This SECI model helps 
in comprehending how SME leaders leverage personal knowledge exchange in the program for 
their organizational gain.  
Social Capital Theory (Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998) offers insights into how the SME training 
environment functioned as a social network, facilitating knowledge sharing and application. The 
theory focuses on the value came from social networks and relationships . In fact, this theory 
explains how close relationship of the SME leaders in the class help to facilitate knowledge sharing 
among leaders.  
Furthermore, Adult Learning Theory (Knowles, 1975) highlights the importance of practical and 
problem -centered learning experiences. Adult Learning Theory (Knowles, 1975), explains the 
concept of self -directed learning. Additionally, adults like to learn t hings that solve their real -life 
problems. This theory is particularly relevant in understanding how SME leaders, who are adult 
learners, engage with and benefit from practical, experiential learning processes like those offered 
in SME leader training.  
 
Research Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the learning experiences 
of Thai SME leaders participating in the SME Leader program,  which was designed to support SMEs 
in Thailand that were impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic. This SME Leader training program 
offers a unique context for exploring practical learning and knowledge transfer among SME leaders.  
 
Research Questions  
RQ1: What is the learning experience of SME’s leaders in a leader training program?  
RQ2: How do SME’s leaders transfer knowledge from a SME Leader training program to manage the 
organization?  
 Methodology  
We employed a phenomenological approach (Glesne, 2016). This method was chosen to capture the 
rich and detailed descriptions of the participants’ lived experiences in the training program. The

276 
study involved conducting semi -structured interviews with 12 SME leaders, designed to gather 
comprehensive insights into their learning experiences and knowledge transfer processes.  We 
analyzed the interview transcripts and mind maps, then broke them down  into 446 codes which 
were grouped into seven main themes. To address trustworthiness, we used triangulation across 
researchers and member checking.  
 
Key Findings  
Based on interviews with 12 SME leaders, their learning experiences in the SME leader training 
program were captured by six themes, which were separated into three overarching themes: 
training design, training catalyst, and training environment.  
Training Design consists of 5 themes, business challenges, learning material.  work assignment, 
diagnostic tools, and continuous business improvement. Training Catalyst includes 2 themes, 
motivation to learn and building trust. Training Environment is the learning environment in mix of 
formal and informal workshop/coach for social knowledge exchange.  
 Figure 1 Learning Model  
Based on the figure 1, SME leaders’ learning journey loop start by learning their own “business 
challenges”, for example, gap operational efficiency, market competition, financial management, 
people management or business disruption. They experience the de sign of the leadership program 
help them understand the issues they face in their day -to-day business operations.  
Additionally, the opportunity to communicate their business challenges and apply program 
knowledge to address them “motivate” the trainees to learn, which is what is meant by the term 
"training catalyst."  
 
In terms of the "training environment," the participants perceived the coaching or workshop as a 
collaborative, open learning environment. Leaders benefit from this environment's “social 
knowledge exchanges” with business -experienced coaches and classmates . It is enabling them to 
exchange implicit information and provide useful, practical guidance on how to solve problems.  
The idea of "building trust" is evident when trainees believe instructors are competent and capable 
of assisting SMEs in resolving issues. The connection of trust that develops between leaders and 
trainers via education serves as a catalyst for the sharing  of ideas between trainees and trainers.  
Trusting in trainers’ knowledge and willingness to help SME leaders solve problems motivates the 
SME leaders to exercise the knowledge in their organizations through a training design of “work 
assignments” and other “learning materials” (e.g., self -assessm ent, exercises, and “diagnostic tools”). 
Therefore, they can identify the problems in their businesses and improve their business outcomes.  
  
Finally, "continuous business improvement and changes" refers to the trainees' observation of the 
results of the adjustments they have made through learning periods. Leaders were motivated to 
share these insights back in the classroom when they saw positiv e changes in their businesses, 
resulting in a dynamic learning loop.  
Implications for HRD Practice  
 
The findings have significant implications for Human Resource Development (HRD) practices in 
SMEs. The study suggests that effective SME leader training programs design should focus on real -
world challenges with tools and framework that will help the learn er to self -diagnosis their problem. 
Emphasizing building trust between instructors and learners. The learner’s motivation to improve 
their business and trust are key catalysts for learning. The study highlights the importance of a 
learning environment that  supports social knowledge exchange where the same group of people 
exchange their knowledge.  
 
 
Conclusions

277 
The study on Thai SME leaders in a training program identified 8 key themes, divided into three 
main categories. Training Design involves diagnosing and responding to business challenges, 
leading to tangible results. The Training Catalyst, driven by motiva tion for change and building trust. 
It energizes leaders to learn knowledge for business improvement. The Training Environment in 
SME programs, focusing on social knowledge exchange. It helps the leader to develop strategic 
thinking and self -efficacy. This  environment encourages a cycle of continuous learning and 
application. They lead to tangible business improvements. These elements are critical for designing 
and implementing effective training programs for SME leaders.

ID:139  - How can governments support learning in SMEs during and after 
disasters: An international comparative study  
Heather Short, Andreas Wallo  & Eduardo Tome  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This paper examines the role of governmental support for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in 
learning and adaptation during and after the COVID -19 pandemic in European contexts, focusing on 
the UK, Sweden, and Portugal. The research explores how these nations, each with distinct COVID -
19 responses and economic structures, have supported their SMEs, which are crucial to their 
economies. By an alysing government initiatives to support SME learning, the study identifies gaps in 
current policies and practices, highlighting that while immediate financial support was prioritised, 
long -term learning and development initiatives were often overlooked.  
The findings underscore a discrepancy between the need for continuous learning within SMEs and 
the support provided by government initiatives. This gap in support, especially for SMEs without 
dedicated learning budgets, has direct implications for their re silience and their ability to respond to 
future crises.  
 
This research contributes to academic and practical understanding by offering the first comparative 
international study of government support for SME learning during a global crisis. The insights 
generated can inform future policies to enhance SME resilien ce, emphasising the critical role of 
learning and development in crisis management and recovery. This paper calls for reassessing 
strategies to better support SMEs in dynamic and challenging conditions.

Perspective  
Mike Mustafa  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Within the family business literature there have been increasing calls to understand how individual 
actions of family members can increase understanding of family businesses’ distinctive 
characteristics and behaviours. This paper examines one type of micro -foundational activity, that is 
next -generation’s lead ership development, in three Chinese family firms. Specifically, we draw on 
both the constructivist approach to learning and  the situated learning perspective. We purposefully 
chose to conduct our research in family -SMEs in China, because it provides a co llectivist and

ID:146  - T&D practices in SMEs operating internationally  
Urban Pauli  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
Human resources are crucial for the existence and growth of SMEs, but HRD -related practices in 
these companies are underdeveloped, hence SMEs may not benefit sufficiently from the potential 
of their employees. Additionally, changes in the business context exert modifications in the way 
compa nies function, which makes it necessary to provide employees with development 
opportunities. Such a situation, refers in particular to SMEs operating on international markets 
(ISMEs), as the number of factors that determine running the business is very div ersified and 
complex. This requires paying attention to T&D practices offered to employees to meet both 
domestic and foreign markets expectations. According to Francioni et al. (2016) and Paul et al. 
(2017) there is a knowledge gap concerning HRM practices  in the context of SME 
internationalisation.  
 
Theoretical base  
SMEs play an important role in economies of all countries and they are very active in building 
international cooperation. However, agreements very often cover a relatively low value of traded 
goods or services (WTO, 2016). Being a part of international trade can be very fruitful for SMEs, as  
cooperation with companies from other countries may positively impact turnover, employment and 
innovation (European Comission, 2010). These benefit s cause that the number of internationally 
active companies in the European Union has continuously been rising since 2014 (OECD 2022). 
Nevertheless, analyses of SMEs international activity made it possible to identify nearly fifty types of 
barriers that sm all and medium enterprises may encounter, among which human resource barriers 
were indicated (OECD, n.d.).  
 
The lack of adequate systems and procedures of managing employees can be a real obstacle, 
because human capital which consists of skills, abilities, and competencies is perceived as a critical 
source of  competitive advantage (Bhattacharya et al. 2014) and  that is why human resources in 
SMEs are in focus of theoretical, empirical and practical attention (Sheehan, 2014). This resource -
based view perspective represents a current paradigm on firm competitiveness. It conceptualises 
the organisation as a collect ion of competencies and draws attention to issues of learning, HRD 
investment, knowledge accumulation and experience (Garavan et al. 2001). Actions aimed at 
employees’ learning and gaining new knowledge can be executed by T&D activities that SMEs 
organise.  This type of activities is of high importance in the case of ISMEs as the ability to acquire 
knowledge and develop internationalisation capabilities influences performance (Hilmersson & 
Johanson, 2020). However, research states that T&D practices in SMEs are underdeveloped (Pauli, 
2020), and that they are executed mostly in an informal way (Tam and Gray 2016; Short and Gray 
2018), which may make the effectiveness of the whole process lower than in large entities.  
 
Research purpose  
Entering foreign markets or intensifying international activities requires competences suitable not 
only for running a business on home country market but also those that correspond with foreign 
markets conditions. That is why, ISMEs should provide their e mployees with T&D opportunities and 
what is more, these activities should be properly organised to assure the expected level of 
performance. The main purpose of this article is to investigate how T&D activities are executed in 
ISMEs, what factors may shape  undertaken activities and whether the way T&D is performed 
impacts performance.

281 
Research questions  
The study aims at answering to the following questions:  
• What factors affect the way ISMEs execute T&D activities?  
• What characterises T&D process in ISMEs?  
• Does T&D approach impact upon ISMEs performance?  
According to these RQ and research design the following hypotheses were drawn:  
• H1: There is a statistically significant relationship between an approach to T&D in ISMEs and firm -
related factors  
o H1a: There is a statistically significant relationship between an approach to T&D in ISMEs and firm 
size 
o H1b: There is a statistically significant relationship between an approach to T&D in ISMEs and firm 
age 
o H1c: There is a statistically significant relationship between an approach to T&D in ISMEs and the 
ownership  
o H1d: There is a statistically significant relationship between an approach to T&D in ISMEs and 
business profile  
o H1e: There is a statistically significant relationship between an approach to T&D in ISMEs and 
business sector  
• H2: There is a statistically significant relationship between an approach to T&D in ISMEs and their 
international activities  
o H2a: There is a statistically significant relationship between an approach to T&D in ISMEs and pace 
of internationalisation  
o H2b: There is a statistically significant relationship between an approach to T&D in ISMEs and 
range of internationalisation  
o H2b: There is a statistically significant relationship between an approach to T&D in ISMEs and 
number of countries firm operates in  
• H3: There is a statistically significant relationship between an approach to T&D in ISMEs and the 
change in the level of incomes.  
 
Means and methods  
The research was executed on a group of 200 randomly selected Polish -based SMEs that perform 
export activities and achieved at least the level of 25% FSTS. To analyse data the following statistical 
methods were applied: descriptive statistics, k -means clus tering, chi -squared test and classification 
and regression trees.  
Implication for HRD practice:  
Investing in employees T&D has a positive impact upon changes in the level of firms’ incomes. 
Companies which start their international activities should pay more attention to T&D activities as in 
most cases the approach they apply is impoverished, which m ay limit potential gains.  
Conclusions:  
Activities undertaken by SMEs operating internationally are very diverse. There is no statistically 
significant relationship between firm -related characteristics and an approach to T&D activities, but 
the factors related to the process of internationalisat ion impact upon the shape of developmental 
programmes. Companies that apply complex T&D programmes report positive changes in year -to-
year incomes level.

ID:198  - Green HRM & Labour Productivity in SMEs:  A mediated moderation 
analysis  
Maura Sheehan  & Thomas Garavan  
 
Abstract  
 
A growing body of macro -level research has found evidence of positive associations between 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and firm -level performance outcomes (Aguinis and Glavas, 
2012; Velte, 2021).  The business case for CSR suggests that the benef icial returns of investment in 
CSR depends on the capacity of CSR activity to increase the strength and quality of the relationship 
between the organisation and its stakeholders (Barnett 2007; Bhattacharya et al. 2009).  Over the 
past decade, employees’ at titudes and behaviours in response to employees’ perceptions of CSR 
have received increasing attention by scholars. Specifically, within the CSR literature, efforts to 
unlock the ‘black box’ between firms CSR and performance outcomes have led to a number o f 
studies that explore how employee attitudes and behaviours (micro -level influencers) respond to 
macro -level CSR initiatives.  Despite Aguinis’ and Glavas’ (2012) call for ‘multi -level’ perspectives, 
including a person -centric focus to CSR, and an integra tion of diverse theoretical frameworks, the 
CSR-performance literature remains highly fragmented.  
 
Utilising multi -level, longitudinal data, we focus on one dimension of CSR – firm’s Green HRM 
(GHRM) practices - which reflect ‘those HRM practices aligned with environmental sustainability 
goals and which aim at developing employees’ abilities, commitment  and motivation, and 
involvement of staff in support of those goals at the firm level’ (Jackson et al., 2011; O’Donohue and 
Torugsa, 2016: p. 240; Renwick et al., 2013) to analyse whether there is a positive association 
between GHRM and labour productivity , in the context of small and medium sized enterprises 
(SMEs).  While the SME HRM -firm performance literature has gradually been developing, in 
particular, in the past 10 years (eg Sheehan and Garavan 2022), very few studies have examined 
potential GHRM -firm performance within SMEs (see O’Donohue and Torugsa, 2016 for a notable 
exception).  
 
Informed by evolutionary resource -based theory (ERBT) (Boxall & Steeneveld, 1999; Muller, 1996; 
Sheehan and Garavan, 2022) and Social Identity Theory (SIT) (DeRoeck and Maon’s (2018) we will 
empirically test whether psychological foundations of GHRM impact s upon labour productivity in 
SMEs.  The micro -foundations examined are: Employee Attitudes (organisational commitment; 
organisational identification; job satisfaction); employees’ voluntary workplace green behaviours 
(EVGBs) (Kim et al., 2016) (the mediat ing variables); and employees’ perceptions of the firm’s 
environmental commitment (P -EC) (Raineri and Paille (2016)) (the moderating variable). This study 
focuses on firm labour productivity as the intended outcome of GHRM. Reviews of the SME 
literature (e g Dhawan, 2001; Owalla et al. 2021) highlight the importance of productivity as an 
organisational performance measure to SMEs and that SMEs face significant challenges which make 
productivity gain even more important albeit more challenging than is the cas e in larger firms.   
 
The working hypotheses are as follows:  
H1: MD’s environmental commitment (EC) is positively associated with GHRM.  
H2: GHRM is positively associated with labour productivity.  
H3: Employees’ attitudes are positively associated with labour productivity.  
H4: Employees’ voluntary green behaviours (EVGBs) are positively associated with labour 
productivity.  
H5: EAs and EVGBs serially mediate the relationship between GHRM and labour productivity.

283 
H6: The indirect association between GHRM and labour productivity though EAs and EVGBs is 
conditional upon levels of employees’ perceptions of the firm’s environmental commitment  (P -EC), 
so  that the relationship between GHRM and labour productivity is st ronger when P -EC is high.  
Data for this study were obtained from 302 UK manufacturing and service SMEs, and all of these 
firms were small and medium -sized enterprises with a median employment level of average 
headcount of 70.1 employees. The data set derived from a stratified sampl e of SMEs from the UK 
Dun and Bradstreet databases consisted of 4 waves of data (2017, 2019, 2021 and 2023) with a 2 -
year lag between each measurement wave.  In each period, responses from Manager Directors 
(MDs)/Owner Manager (OMs) and employees were coll ected and subsequently analysed. A 2 -1-2 
multilevel moderated sequential mediation model will be estimated (Croon, 2015).

ID:200  - Employee Churn Prediction in commercial aviation companies in 
Portugal  
António Brito, Maria José Sousa  & Ana Moreira  
 
ABSTRACT  
Employee churn occurs when an employee leaves voluntarily from a company. Differently from the 
concept of turnover, which represents all the workforce that leaves a company, voluntarily or not, 
churn is not only voluntary as it is implicit that that loss f or the company does not have 
replacement. Finally, churn, differently from other concepts that are used interchangeably as 
“turnover” or “attrition”, deals more with the financial consequences of an employee loss (Pirrolas, 
Correia & Nascimento, 2022). “Ch urn”, “turnover” or “attrition” are concepts that are used 
interchangeably, but in fact are different, except “attrition” that is used commonly as synonym. The 
costs of an employee's departure are various, and are not only the training costs, but the costs  of 
finding another employee of the same value, the knowledge lost to a competitor, the loss of value in 
general. Alternatively, the construct "turnover intention" is used, instead of the employee's 
departure when it actually happens. The variable "turnove r intentions" represents the employee's 
propensity to leave his organization (Ali et al, 2022; Rombaut & Guerry, 2018) not the act in itself. 
Turnover intention is found to be the best antecedent to actual turnover (Griffeth, Hom & Gaertner, 
2000; Joseph e t al. 2007). Job satisfaction is a concept that has been studied for many years and 
with thousands of contributions. The concept is not certain as job satisfaction is something different 
from person to person and involves several dimensions of analysis. Jo b satisfaction can be 
associated with a set of feelings, cognitions, beliefs, and attitudes that people have in relation to 
their work. It is a set of positive or negative feelings (Armstrong, 2006; Huang et al. 2016; Spector, 
1997; Vroom, 1964). There are  also various types of job satisfaction. When it comes to the aviation 
sector, the topic of turnover is complex and nuanced. In some cases, namely in some job roles and 
type of aviation activity/ or company, turnover is high (Efthymiou et al. 2021), as in others, it is not 
so high. There are few studies on the subject of employee churn in the commercial aviation sector. 
Also there are few studies that correlate employee satisfaction with turnover intentions in the 
commercial aviation sector. The methodology  of this study was first to define the constructs 
“employee churn”, “job satisfaction” and “turnover intentions”. Next was the step of finding in the 
literature the most common factors associated with employee churn. Also it was searched in the 
literature the subject of turnover in the commercial aviation sector. The result of the review was 
various types of job satisfaction and the most common research topics in the academic field for the 
subject of turnover in aviation. The next step was to build a resear ch model based on literature 
findings. The main hypothesis were established based on different kinds of satisfaction and the 
most common factors associated with employee churn. A sample of 370 valid responses from 
people working in the commercial aviation sector was used to assess which factors were most 
associated with employee churn and which strongest associations existed between the variables. 
Multiple linear regression was used for data analysis. The results show that the participants in this 
study are  satisfied with security and their manager but that their satisfaction with their career, 
work/life balance and pay are below the center point of the scale. The job group has a significant 
effect on employee satisfaction, as well as on their intentions to leave and perceived performance. 
PNTs are the most satisfied with their careers, security and pay. They also have the highest 
perception of their performance and the fewest intentions to leave. Those who are most satisfied 
with reconciling work and persona l life are the M&E workers, and those who have the most 
significant intention of leaving are the participants in the group of ground workers. Seniority 
significantly affects satisfaction with career, management, work/life balance and intentions to leave. 
Participants who have worked for the organization for less than a year have the highest career 
satisfaction. Participants who have worked for the organization for a year are the most satisfied 
with their manager and work/life balance. Participants who have worked for the organization for

285 
more than 30 years have the highest level of intention to leave. The number of hours worked only 
significantly affects satisfaction with security, with participants who work more hours per month 
being the least satisfied with security. Only satisfaction wi th safety and satisfaction with work/life 
balance significantly affect performance, with the effect of satisfaction with safety being positive 
and the effect of work/life balance negative. As for the effect of satisfaction on turnover intentions, 
the dimen sions of satisfaction with career, security, management, and remuneration have a 
negative and significant effect on turnover intentions. As for the moderating effect of turnover 
intentions, this effect was only found in the relationship between satisfactio n with pay and 
performance. These results are relevant to the literature because, contrary to expectations, 
satisfaction with work/life balance has a negative effect on performance.

ID:226  - Effects of transformational leadership and employee creativity on 
organizational innovation in small and medium -sized firms in South Korea: 
Moderation of intrinsic motivation  
Bui My Hanh  & Sung Jun Jo  
 
Abstract  
As the needs of study on how to increase organizational innovation have been raised recently, this 
study aims to analyze the positive effects of transformational leadership and employee creativity on 
organizational innovation. Additionally, it tests the indirect effects from intrinsic motivation. Data 
were collected from 419 Korean employees working in different small and medium -sized companies 
in South Korea via an online and offline sur veys. The survey responses were evaluated using partial 
least squares structural equation modeling (PLS -SEM) with the SmartPLS 4.0 program. All proposed 
hypotheses were confirmed in this study. The main findings of the study indicate that 
transformational leadership is significantly and positively related to organizational innovation, with 
this relationship being mediated by employee creativity. The results also indicated that the indirect 
effect of transformational leadership on organizational innovation t hrough employee creativity was 
moderated by intrinsic motivation. This study offers new insights into the effects of 
transformational leadership, intrinsic motivation, and employee creativity on organizational 
innovation in Korean organizations. It is valu able for leaders, managers, and other HR management 
specialists. Based on the findings, some implications are proposed to assist leaders of small and 
medium -sized companies in enhancing leadership to improve intrinsic motivation and employee 
creativity, th ereby fostering organizational innovation.  
 
Importance of Study  
In today's fast -paced business environment, innovation has long been considered a main objective 
for many organizations and has the potential for powerful influence on organizational growth and 
development (Mumford, 2002). To achieve innovation, business o rganizations need to have a 
motivated, stable, and nimble workforce that enables the enterprise to stay relevant and adaptable 
in a dynamic and changing economic climate. As leaders can influence their subordinates' 
motivation to engage in creative tasks b y setting expectations for creative performance (Koseoglu et 
al., 2017; Hughes et al., 2018; A. Lee et al., 2020), there is a growing interest in exploring the impact 
of transformational leadership on creativity and innovation (Chaubey et al., 2019). By in tegrating all 
of those factors together we proposed a conceptual framework and examined how 
transformational leadership, employee creativity, and organizational innovation were related. In 
addition, we tested if intrinsic motivation of employees moderates the relationships.  
This study is important because numerous organizations across various sectors currently and 
continually are experimenting various methods to inspire their employees to work creatively and 
develop new and exciting ideas (Gu et al., 2015). We examined how le adership factor affects 
promoting employee creativity which is said to be a fundamental element for achieving innovation 
in organization. (Shalley & Zhou, 2008). This study opens the black box from a new insight by 
showing the configurations of creativity and further advances in the research on human resource 
flexibility and employee creativity performance.  
 
Findings of Study  
From the study conducted in small and medium -sized companies with 419 samples in South Korea, 
we acquired the following findings.  
Firstly, transformational leadership exhibited a positive correlation with organizational innovation. 
Results of the study suggested that the more a leader demonstrates transformational leadership 
qualities, the more effectively it stimulates organizationa l innovation.

287 
Secondly, employee creativity mediated the relationship between transformational leadership and 
organizational innovation, indicating that employee creativity enhanceed the impact of 
transformational leadership on organizational innovation. This result res onates with various studies  
highlighting the role of employee creativity as a mediating factor  
Thirdly, intrinsic motivation functioned as a moderating factor between transformational leadership 
and employee creativity concerning organizational innovation. In other words, transformational 
leadership can strengthen the relationship between high -perfo rmance transformational leadership 
and employee creativity in influencing organizational innovation.

ID:261 -Exploring the Learning Emotions of Korean SME Workers  
Seokyoung Oh, Hyeyoon Jeong, Sewha Kim  & Sungjoo Ji  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This study aims to explore how SME workers' conceptions of learning are constructed and how their 
learning emotions are experienced in the learning process. This study utilized the conceptual 
frameworks of emotions in organizations (e.g. dialogic, constructivis t, functionalist, and critical) 
proposed by previous studies to explore the learning emotion of SME employees. The study was 
conducted through in -depth interviews with 21 employees from nine SMEs. The study found that 
functionalist learning emotions were m ainly expressed in the process of acquiring and developing 
job-related competencies. Constructivist learning emotions manifest as the commitment to the 
organization and work and a sense of belonging while engaging in learning activities under a shared 
vision. Dialogic learning emotions were expressed during problem -solving and exploration 
processes in the face of major crises and changes affecting the company's survival. Critical learning 
emotions were characterized by discomfort and a sense of being deceiv ed due to contradictions 
and issues within organizations. This study contributes to exploring distinct types of learning 
emotions in SMEs contexts and making an effort to overcome a prevailing functionalist perspective 
in the field of HRD. Building on this  foundation, we also suggest practical implications for fostering 
learning activities within SMEs.

ID:25  -Technological change, HRD and Lifelong Learning  
Valerie Anderson  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This paper considers the effect of advances in digital interconnectivity and ‘smart’ automation on 
work, employment, and HRD. It discusses the HRD implications of two theories concerning the 
potential effect of transformational technological change on work  and labour markets. Both labour 
scarcity and job scarcity theories predict increasing occurrences of dislocation to full -time 
employment opportunities and an accelerated shift towards non -standard employment contracts, 
including sub -contract and ‘gig’ -work. The argument of the paper is that lifelong learning can 
provide a means of individual, organizational and societal adaptation to technological 
transformation. The paper argues this means that the HRD field must reconsider its stance towards 
lifelong lea rning. An inclusive approach to provision of lifelong learning is necessary, requiring HRD 
practitioners to engage with other stakeholders beyond the traditional remit of the ‘business 
partner’ concept of HRD. The paper recommends research to develop a met ric or index for lifelong 
learning and also that practitioner engage in developing an international standard for lifelong 
learning to provide organizations with a route -map towards readiness to fully benefit from 
integrating lifelong learning into their or ganizational HRD priorities.

ID:30  -AI as the New Antecedents of Techostress at Work  
Aykut Arslan, Serdar Yener  & Helena Belchior -Rocha  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This study explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across various business sectors and 
underscores the importance of the human element in harnessing AI’s potential. It addresses the 
concept of “technostress” and aims to understand the implications of rapid AI proliferation on the 
workforce. The research seeks to understand the dimensions of technostress exacerbated by AI 
adoption and elucidate the factors that followers deem crucial in navigatin g and adapting to the 
transformative trajectory of AI technologies.  
 
A significant proportion of observed efficiency improvements can be attributed to the integration of 
systems involving collaborative efforts between human workers and AI. However, the realization of 
these efficiency gains is contingent upon the workforce’s  acceptance of these systems. Resistance to 
technological adoption due to technostress could potentially hinder the full exploitation of the 
envisioned efficiency enhancements associated with Human -AI Collaboration systems.  
Most literature has focused on the perception of AI adoption, and studies investigating the effect of 
human -AI collaboration through actual co -working with AI are scarce. This study aims to fill this gap 
in the literature, offering valuable insights into t he interplay between human cognition, technology -
induced stress, and its broader impact on individual well -being and organizational dynamics.

ID:33  - Challenging Western Orientated Assumptions: How do we achieve 
identity transformation of the HRD field?  
Valerie Anderson, Rob Poell  & Roziah Mohd Rasdi  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This working paper problematizes the current dominance of Western -centric HRD models and 
theories, which represent the voices and experiences of less than 25% of the world’s population. We 
first compare current responses in the literature to this issue, co nsidering arguments for 
generalized theorization of HRD and literature advocating indigenous HRD scholarship and practice. 
We suggest that both approaches lack emancipatory potential and fail to take appropriate account 
of the effect of power and social re lationships on the practice of HRD. We then propose an 
emancipatory structures framework as a basis for HRD theorization that is more interactive, 
intentional and synchronistic, as the basis for inclusive, and emergent co -creation of HRD 
knowledge and theo ry. Our aim is to make the case for HRD theorization that can both explain and 
foster human and organizational development across diverse global contexts.

ID:65  - What Does Hybrid Work Really Mean? A Systematic Review  
Cho Hyun Park  & Sunyoung Park  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Importance and Theoretical Base  
Hybrid work is a combination of technology -supported virtual (off -site) and in -person (on -site) work 
interactions (Chong et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2017). Since the COVID pandemic in 2020 when alternative 
work forms dramatically spread, scholars have paid c onsiderable attention to the important role of 
hybrid work for employees and organizations. Recognizing its significance for talent retention and 
attraction, organizations have increasingly adopted hybrid work models (Tsipursky, 2023). 
Choudhury et al. (20 22) reported that, despite managing a higher volume of emails, hybrid workers 
receive better performance ratings from managers than their in -office counterparts. Allen et al. 
(2024) identified critical employee behaviors for hybrid work settings such as ad apting to change, 
focusing on tasks over prolonged periods, managing the time and schedule for deliverables, and 
performing efficiently and autonomously. In a hybrid workplace, employees collaborate while 
working in different work modes. However, the dynam ics differ between a hybrid setting and face -
to-face or fully remote setting where all employees work in the same work mode (Fiol & O'Connor, 
2005). As organizations explore various hybrid work formats, the concept continues to evolve, 
necessitating a comp rehensive understanding of the meaning and ongoing evolution for effective 
implementation. Thus, there is a need to understand what hybrid work means for organizations and 
how the concept of hybrid work is evolving to implement it effectively. This study d raws on the task -
technology fit model (Goodhue & Thompson, 1995) and the job demands -resources model (Bakker 
& Demerouti, 2007) as the theoretical framework to discuss the evolution of hybrid work.   
   
Research Purpose and Significance  
This study aims to integrate existing knowledge of hybrid work and identify future research needs 
by reviewing prior research. This study is significant for HRD to (a) clarify the hybrid work concept, 
and (b) present a conceptual framework for researchers and practitioners navigating the evolution 
and implementation of hybrid work.   
   
Research Questions  
1. What are the characteristics and profiles of current hybrid work research?   
2. How have previous studies defined hybrid work?   
3. What are the prominent themes, patterns, and trends in hybrid work research?   
   
Methodology  
This research reviews hybrid work literature in SSCI - and Scopus -indexed journals. Using the Web of 
Science Core Collections and Scopus database, we found 564,032 articles with hybrid work -related 
keywords. After excluding irrelevant articles, 187 remained , which we will analyze to uncover 
research trends, definitions, main themes, and propose a future research agenda.  
   
Implications for HRD Practice  
After gaining a clear understanding of the hybrid work concept, HRD needs to establish and 
implement effective policies tailored to each organization. These hybrid work policies will help 
attract and retain talented employees while maximizing employee perf ormance.    
     
Conclusions  
This study will contribute significantly to the ongoing development and implementation of effective 
hybrid work practices tailored to diverse organizational settings. It will help organizations attract 
and retain a talented workforce.

ID:88  -Technological Advancements and Their Implications for HRD: A Scoping 
Review  
Shyamal Pandya, Kyung Nam Kim  & Gislene Ferreira dos Reis  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Importance  
In an era where digital transformation is reshaping every aspect of the workplace, our research 
paper takes a pivotal dive into understanding the implications of technological advancements for 
Human Resource Development (HRD). This study is particularly crucial as it navigates through the 
intersection of rapidly evolving technology and the foundational practices of HRD. In the  current 
landscape, where digital tools and technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big 
data analytics are becoming integral to business operations (Jafari -Sadeghi et al., 2021), their impact 
on HRD practices, strategies, and outco mes is both profound and largely unexplored.  
The significance of our research lies in its capacity to bridge the knowledge gap in how these 
technological advancements are not just altering, but also enhancing HRD functions such as talent 
acquisition, employee training and development, performance man agement, and employee 
engagement (Yorks et al., 2022). With the workforce becoming increasingly digital, remote, and 
diverse, understanding the role of these technologies in facilitating effective HRD strategies is 
essential for organizations to remain com petitive and adaptive (Hanelt et al., 2021). Moreover, our 
study delves into the challenges and opportunities presented by these advancements, providing 
insights into how organizations can leverage technology to foster a more dynamic, skilled, and 
responsi ve workforce (Thite, 2022).  
 
The findings from this research are expected to guide HR professionals and business leaders in 
making informed decisions about integrating technology into HRD practices, ensuring alignment 
with the needs and expectations of the modern workplace. In essence , our paper seeks to offer a 
comprehensive overview of the current state of technological integration in HRD and its future 
trajectory. By doing so, it contributes to a more nuanced understanding and strategic application of 
technology in human resource pr actices, an endeavor that is not only timely but imperative in the 
digital age.  
 
Research Purpose  
This paper is dedicated to exploring the influence of technological advancements on Human 
Resource Development (HRD). Our specific objectives are:  
1. To review empirical studies focusing on the integration of emerging technologies within 
HRD.  
2. To conduct a thematic analysis to identify key themes and trends in the application of 
technology in HRD practices.  
3. To identify research gaps and propose directions for future research and practical 
applications in HRD.  
 
Research Methods  
To accomplish our outlined objectives, we employed a scoping literature review. This methodology 
is particularly suited for our study as it allows us to (a) extensively explore the range and nature of 
research activity concerning technological advancements  in HRD, (b) assess the need for a more 
detailed systematic review in the future, (c) efficiently summarize and disseminate key research 
findings, and (d) identify any significant gaps in the current literature (Arksey & O’Malley, 2005). To 
ensure the thor oughness and reliability of our research process, we adhered to the Preferred

295 
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta -Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA -
ScR; Tricco et al., 2018) guidelines.  
 
Our literature identification process will be conducted in three stages. First, we will search several 
academic databases, including Academic Search Ultimate, Business Source Ultimate, ScienceDirect, 
JSTOR, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the ProQuest Business Collection, using keywords such 
as 'technology in HRD', 'digital transformation', and 'human resource development technology'. We 
established criteria for inclusion: peer -reviewed articles, published in English, from 2019 onwards.  
Next, we will review article abstracts, excluding those not focused on technological advancements in 
HRD. In the final stage, we will apply an additional criterion: the inclusion of empirical studies or 
substantial theoretical contributions in the field.  
 
Implications for HRD Practice  
The findings have significant implications for HRD professionals implementing technological 
advancements. Our analysis provides a comprehensive overview of strategically integrating 
emerging technologies into HRD practices, aligning with workforce needs an d organizational 
objectives. Key insights emphasize the necessity for HRD professionals to adopt a forward -thinking 
approach in embracing technological innovations, ensuring tech adoption fits the organization's 
culture and caters to diverse workforce need s (Leal -Rodríguez et al., 2023). This approach ensures 
that technology adoption in HRD is not just a trend but a transformative tool for personal and 
organizational growth.  
 
Furthermore, our research underscores the critical role of fostering a technology -centric culture 
within organizations as fundamental for modern HRD. This culture should promote continuous 
learning, innovation, and adaptability, enabling employees to effec tively leverage the potential of 
technological tools in their career development (Wallin et al., 2022). By embedding such a culture, 
technology becomes an integral part of the organizational ecosystem, leading to a more dynamic, 
efficient, and future -ready  workforce (Lee & Roh, 2023). The outcomes of our review provide 
strategic insights for HRD and organizational development professionals, emphasizing the need for 
a balanced integration of technology in HR practices that benefits both employees and the 
organization (Yorks et al., 2022). This strategic integration is essential for developing a workforce 
that is not only technologically proficient but also agile and responsive to the rapidly changing 
business landscape.  
 
Conclusion  
Our extensive review illuminates the complex and transformative role of technological 
advancements in the realm of HRD. The study highlights the potential for revolutionizing HRD 
practices, offering innovative solutions for workforce training, talent management, and employee 
engagement (Yorks et al., 2022). However, our analys is also reveals challenges, such as aligning tech 
initiatives with organizational strategies and addressing concerns related to digital literacy and the 
digital divide in the workforce (Lythreatis et al., 2022).  
In conclusion, the paper emphasizes strategic technology integration, recognizing immense benefits 
while also considering limitations and challenges. We advocate for a balanced approach that 
leverages the strengths of technological innovations while remain ing cognizant of potential pitfalls 
(Lee & Roh, 2023). Moreover, our research identifies a critical need for further empirical studies on 
the long -term effects of technological interventions in HRD, particularly in varied global contexts 
(Jafari -Sadeghi et  al., 2021; Thite, 2022). Such research is essential to deepen our understanding of 
effective technology utilization for current HRD needs and to prepare for future challenges and 
opportunities in the ever -evolving workplace.

ID:117  - eGovernment and citizen engagement in Portugal  
Graciete Franco  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The widespread of new technologies in public organizations has experienced a remarkable 
evolution in most countries in recent decades, driven by the design and implementation of 
ambitious digitization policies in this sector.  
 
Digitalization is changing the relationship between citizens and the Public Administration. The focus 
has shifted from administrative processes and intra -organizational management to citizen service 
and inter -organizational management (Osborne, 2010; Osbor ne et al., 2013). Governments are 
increasingly focused on serving citizens and meeting their expectations, changing the way they 
operate in order to improve transparency, democratization and the provision of public services 
through eGovernment, as citizens  are increasingly digitally empowered and demanding in terms of 
the way, speed and efficiency in which these services are provided (Mergel et al., 2019).  
In Portugal, however, despite the high level of availability of digital public services, citizen uptake is 
below the European average (European Commission, 2022). This leads us to a question: what could 
be the reasons behind this gap?  
 
The aim of this work is to provide a preliminary insight into the evolution of the digitalization policy 
of the Public Administration in Portugal over the last two decades and to raise possible research 
hypotheses on the question presented, based on theore tical principles of the new paradigms of 
public management such as the New Public Service and the New Public Governance (Denhardt & 
Denhardt, 2007; Osborne, 2010).  
 
First of all, a brief contextualization of the topic and a summary of this evolution are presented. This 
is followed by an analysis of the eGovernment digitalization/penetration paradox in Portugal, where 
statistical data is presented and analysed to help us understand the problem presented. Finally, the 
results of the analysis are discussed, with brief concluding remarks.  
This work is part of a research project being carried out as part of a doctoral thesis, the aim of 
which is to understand why there is such a contrast between the high level of availability of public 
services online and their low use by citizens in Portugal (European Commission,  2022). The 
conclusions of this study aim to contribute to an adjustment of public sector digitalization policies, 
in order to increase the levels of citizen engagement to e -government.

ID:118  - ‘Contactless’ affective labour: A gender perspective on the future of 
work in the UK’s mental health services  
Marianna Fotaki  & Didem (Derya) Ozdemir Kaya  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Recent developments in artificial intelligence and robotics, the increasing digitalisation of goods and 
services, and the shift toward remote working after the COVID -19 pandemic have reinvigorated the 
interest in the future of work (Howcroft & Taylor, 2023 ). Numerous technological tools such as 
mobile applications, messaging services, and remote online therapy platforms fill the growing 
demand for mental health services (Martin, 2015) and unmet care needs across health and social 
services in the UK and beyo nd (Dowling, 2021), despite concerns about technological determinism 
of such an approach (e.g., Fleming, 2019). There is a growing consensus around the limitations of 
technology in automating or digitalising jobs demanding ‘social and emotional capabilitie s’ (Manyika 
et al., 2017, p. 35) or ‘human touch’ (Karakilic, 2022, p. 185). Furthermore, affective labour’s 
resistance to technology has gendered implications for the future of work because broadly 
conceived care jobs are predominantly performed by women whose labour is often underpaid and 
undervalued (Fotaki, 2023). There is a danger that the change in mental health services delivery 
through online platforms as market commodities (could make the jobs of the people delivering 
them more precarious (Cotton, 2021). Yet, none of these limitations have been investigated in - 
depth from a human resource perspective, nor are the implications appreciated comprehensively 
by offering gender analysis of affective labour (Ozdemir Kaya and Fotaki, 2023a), as we do in thi s 
research.  
 
The paper uncovers the embodied, sensorial, psychosocial, and spatial elements of affective labour 
that resist technological replacement or replication, mapping their implications for mental health 
service delivery. We will study these in the setting of ps ychodynamic psychotherapy where 
technology -mediated online therapy provided via remote platforms poses peculiar challenges, 
raising questions of safety, efficacy, and equity of access (see Craciun, 2019; Johnson et al., 2022; 
Punzi and Singer, 2018). Speci fically, we will examine how technology enables and restrains job 
performance, impacts reach and affordability, pay and conditions, and occupational segregation 
from a gender perspective, contributing to the emerging future of work research (Howcroft and 
Rubery, 2019).

ID:131  - Navigating the Digital Wave: A Scoping Review of Technology's Impact 
on Employee Engagement in the Post -Pandemic Landscape (2021 -2023)  
Diane Keeble -Ramsay  & Obinna Ejiogu  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The COVID -19 pandemic ushered in transformative changes across business functions and sectors. 
The impact on Human Resource Development (HRD) was profound.  It was the catalyst to a rapid 
shift towards technology -driven practices. Remote work became the no rm.  AI -powered tools 
emerged as valuable training allies and digital learning platforms seemed to blossom into vibrant 
knowledge hubs (Onana & Kassah, 2023).   Bansal et al (2023) conceptualized providing a potentially 
unified understanding of that HR Dig ital Transformation (HRDT).  Given the potential for 
incorporation of HR digitilisation, smart -/green -/sustantainable and e -HRD, it determines HRDT as 
the process of using digital technologies to innovate and improve HR practices and outcomes.  From 
which it might be proposed that HRDT offers advantages of flexibility and scalability.  It also 
introduces challenges. Amidst this transformation of the landscape towards the post -pandemic era 
then, a critical question arose to query whether this influenced Empl oyee Engagement?   
Engaged employees are not merely committed to their tasks; potentially they are emotionally 
invested in their organization's success.  This translates into tangible benefits potentially like 
increased output and improved service quality. Therefore, Employe e Engagement has been 
considered a current critical factor within organizational success. Maintaining pre -pandemic levels 
of Employee Engagement, potentially offered by traditional HRD practices, might then be a concern.  
It is suggested that traditional H RD strategies often rely on face -to-face interactions —such as in -
person training and team -building exercises (even where technology is employed through electronic 
interactions).  Thus, may foster a sense of belonging and purpose amongst participants.   Suc h a 
sense of belonging from physical interactions may be a psychological trigger towards greater 
Employee Engagement (Kumar & Pansari, 2016).  Whereas, Digital platforms possibly lack the social 
richness and immediacy of physical human interactions.  That might lead towards feelings of 
isolation or disconnection among employees.  
  
This paper reports a scoping review investigating publications within the post pandemic period of 
2021 to 2023.  It seeks to explore reports of any relationship between technology infused HRD 
practices relative to Employee Engagement or motivation, commitm ent, and overall well -being.  
From which review progresses a timely synthesis of the evolving landscape of technology driven 
HRD and Employee Engagement.   It seeks to build upon prior knowledge to gain insights from 
HRDT’s emerging technologies, by the pr esentation a current map of trends, strategic 
considerations and challenges.   By illuminating these areas, a potential to empower HRD 
leadership more effectively might be advocated.    Being able to potentially anticipate future shifts, 
might facilitate m ore effective harnessing of such technology to cultivate further Employee 
Engagement given a rapidly changing work environment.

ID:141  - Developing AI -Savvy Leaders: A Competence Modeling Approach  
Jessica Li, Seth Martinez, Alina Waite  & Jihye Oh  
 
ABSTRACT  
The development of AI applications has been expanding rapidly ever since GhatGPT was released to 
the public in November 2022. Currently, generative AI (GenAI) has been one of the fast -growing AI 
technologies that has garnered the attention of businesses an d government organizations. 
Business and AI leaders have predicted that AI will impact many jobs by altering how work is 
accomplished and processed. An Accenture published study projected that AI would affect 40% of 
the working hours through augmentation a nd automation (Accenture, 2023). The ability to 
successfully repurpose these 40% of working hours to other productive and creative activities is 
what faces the future leaders of businesses and organizations. With the effective utilization of AI 
technology and purposeful relocation of these 40% working hours, leaders could propel 
organizations to another level.  
  
To take advantage of what AI has to offer, McGlaufin and Abrams (2023) recommended four actions 
leaders and human resource professionals must take to advance their organizations in this time of 
rapid change. First, evaluate and determine the relevant AI to ols and how and when to implement 
them in the work process. Second, determine AI competencies and KSAs needed for the 
organization and attract the right AI talents. Third, educate, prepare, and develop the rest of the 
workforce to be AI -ready. Fourth, prep are the organization for forthcoming regulations. 
Undoubtedly, future leaders are faced with the challenges of managing these crucial actions 
effectively to adopt AI technology and ensure successful organizational change. This research will 
investigate the se challenges and propose a competence -based approach toward developing AI -
savvy leaders to lead vital AI -driven organizational change.  
  
Borrowing from HRD/HRM, psychology, cognitive science, and organization behavior literature, we 
aim to set a guiding framework for developing AI -savviness leaders over and above their current 
leadership and management responsibilities. As we approach this research, the following are 
essential considerations. First, adopting AI as a technology will likely experience the technology 
adoption cycle only at a very rapid speed. Second, AI adoption will likely differ from previous 
technology innovations because of  its ability to perform cognitive functions, often considered 
unique human capabilities. Third, the generative nature of AI will likely change the dynamic of the 
leader -follower relationship since it will likely project influence on attitudes, feelings, th inking, 
behavior, and performance of the individual, groups, and organizations in unpredictable ways that 
leaders may or may not be aware (Tigre et al., 2023). Fourth, AI will likely impact the organization 
hierarchy by altering the path of communication, information sharing, and decision -making. Fifth, AI 
adoption will likely alter the organization's culture, which may require the continuous development 
and application of AI tools and digital knowledge and the creation of growth spaces for sharing and 
learning (Schiuma et al., 2022).   
  
A leadership competencies perspective will guide our inquiry. Competence is often defined as 
knowledge, skills, personal characteristics, self -concepts, traits, and motives (McClelland, 1973). 
Abbu et al. (2022), brought forth the definition of digital lea dership to include digital literacy and 
ethical AI. Philip et al. (2023) proposed six essential competencies for managing digital 
transformation: visionary thinking, agility, understanding the value of data, data -driven decision -
making, knowledge of strate gy, and acceptance of change. Zivkovic (2022) proposed nine 
competencies: vision, innovation, flexibility, understanding digital technologies, empowerment, 
collaboration, multiple intelligences, experimentation, and continuous learning.

302 
Through an integrated literature review, this study will propose a competencies framework to 
optimally develop AI -savvy leaders and learning pathways.

ID:159  - How to Redevelop Managers to understand Employee Perceptions of 
Employee Wellbeing in the Higher Educational Sector in Northern Ireland?  
Naomi Smyth -Patterson  
 
ABSTRACT  
How to Redevelop Managers to understand Employee Perceptions of Employee Wellbeing in the 
Higher Educational Sector in Northern Ireland?  
 
Contribution to the HRD field  
This research will aid the development of new insights into employee wellbeing (EW) within the 
higher educational (HE) sector in Northern Ireland (NI). Firstly, this study will contribute to helping 
managers to understand employee perceptions of EW. It wil l also contribute to the body of 
knowledge and literature on EW and expand and enrich the interpretation of pre -existing EW 
theories.  
 
Aim and Purpose  
The aim of this research study is to investigate employee perceptions of EW and help managers to 
understand EW Ulster University and Queens University.  
The purpose of this research is to investigate and propose strategies for improving the 
understanding of managers regarding their employees' perceptions of wellbeing within HE in NI. 
This research will focus on how HR professionals can best develop manager s to enhance their 
awareness and comprehension of how employees perceive and experience wellbeing in their 
respective institutions.  
 
Theoretical foundations  
Employee perceptions of EW in the HE sector are integral to the development of EW initiatives 
(Tham & Holland, 2018). The employee voice plays a significant role in the development of EW 
interventions which can lead to increased productivity, operational e xcellence, creating cooperative 
workplaces and enhancing the student learning experience (Boxall & Purcell, 2016; Pyman et al., 
2010).  
 
Employees face several wellbeing challenges in educational institutions which have affected 
employee engagement, performance, job motivation and productivity resulting in a dip in employee 
resilience (Abbas & Zhiqiang, 2020; Bently et al., 2014). Several a uthors have argued that if 
appropriate wellness interventions and successful health & wellbeing strategies are not 
implemented by managers, the TE sector will be faced with unmanageable workloads, burnout and 
creative thinking will diminish (Bao et al., 20 20; Tham & Holland, 2018).  
 
Employees perceive non -financial benefits such as working from home, flexible working hours and 
work life balance to be important factors in maintaining emotional wellbeing. However, with 
increased uncertainty around job security, employment longevity and financial benefits are highly 
sought after by employees. Managers need to enhance their communication channels around 
mental, physical, and emotional wellbeing support programmes including household composition, 
purchasing habits, and financial education, which should be tailored towards individual employee 
needs (Hinkle, 2020; Tham & Holland, 2018). Managers must ensure that they have a wide range of 
bespoke resources to offer employees, such as telehealth, stress management and resilience 
programs which c ontributes to increased productivity resulting in a happier, healthier workforce 
(Hinkle, 2020).

ID:190  - Professional Identity of HRD instructors and Generative AI  
Ajit Bhattarai  & Beixi Li  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Although the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not new, only limited scholarship exists that 
discusses AI in the context of HRD (Hamouche et al., 2023). Despite the paucity of literature, limited 
scholarship has noted how technological advances li ke AI might and can impact various dimensions 
of HRD. A portion of the scholarship has focused on broader aspects of AI related to HRD (e.g., 
Akdere et al., 2022; Ekuma, 2023) and noting its destructive and creative force (Su et al., 2020). 
Scholars have a lso discussed various concepts that are generally of HRD interest, like coaching 
(Graßmann and Schermuly, 2021), training and development (Ali et al., 2023), learning and 
development (Bhatt and Muduli, 2021), expertise development (Ardichvili, 2022), perso nalized 
learning (Li and Wong, 2023) along with a few studies on designing and conducting HRD -AI research 
(e.g., Kambur and Akar, 2021). Further, a few HRD scholars have also narrowly focused on 
specialized concepts in AI, like people analytics (e.g., Lee and Lee, 2023; Yoon et al., 2023).  
A cursory review of the HRD -AI scholarship makes it clear that HRD scholars, especially those with 
teaching responsibilities, have yet to explore questions like how AI can impact their teaching, how AI 
could be incorporated into their teaching, what challe nges might be faced in incorporating AI in 
their teaching, etc. In a way, this is not surprising given that historically, only limited HRD 
scholarship has focused on teaching HRD (Bhattarai, 2023). However, scholars in other educational 
fields have started  discussing how different forms of AI can possibly impact how they teach. Some 
recent examples are teaching science (Cooper, 2023) and mathematics education (Hwang and Tu, 
2021).  Scholars have noted that incorporating newer technologies in the classroom c an change an 
instructor’s professional identity (Howear, 2023).  
 
In this context, a narrative study is being designed to explore how incorporating innovative 
technological advances like AI in HRD classrooms influences an HRD instructor’s professional 
identity. We are interested in how generative AI, such as ChatGPT, cou ld disrupt, extend, and 
transform the subjectivity of HRD instructors. Generative AI is a technology that produces human -
like content using a machine -learning model based on a large amount of publicly available digital 
data (Baidoo -Anu & Ansah, 2023). Chat GPT, a generative AI tool regarded as affordable and easy to 
use, is gaining popularity in various fields, including education. While Ausat et al. (2023) concluded 
that ChatGPT can only be a tool and not a replacement for teachers in the classroom, the 
eme rgence of generative AI provides a unique context to explore what it means to teach when 
learners have access to an evolving learning aid that can provide customized support.  
Using the lens of socio -technical theory, we aim to interview HRD instructors who mobilize 
generative AI as a pedagogical tool to examine how generative AI interacts with their sense of 
professional identity. The study's findings will provide a better unde rstanding of how HRD 
instructors use generative AI, how they navigate issues relating to AI in their pedagogical practices, 
and its impact on their professional identity.

ID:204  - Artificial intelligence and its impact on the work of civil servants : A 
systematic review  
José Dias Lopes, Paulo Almeida Gonçalves, Ricardo Raimundo  & João 
Rodrigues dos Santos  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
There is a strong belief that Artificial Intelligence has the potential to impact the field of public 
administration for many years to come (Shark, 2019). This conviction has materialized in several 
recent initiatives that seek to analyze this development.  The United Nations regularly assesses the 
global situation of e -government, and its E -GOVERNMENT SURVEY report has only looked at the 
impacts of artificial intelligence on public administration since 2018 (the report is published 
biannually in UN reports 2018; 2020; 2022), which attests to the actuality of the subject.  
One of the areas where this impact will be felt most is in human resources (Neumann, Guirguis & 
Steiner, 2022). This situation, which is transversal to most sectors of activity (see WEF, 2023, p6; 
OECD, 2023), will necessarily affect the public administrat ion and is therefore already cause for 
concern on the part of its employees (Misuraca & van Noordt, 2020). The topic has also been the 
subject of a research effort in academia, reflected in a growing number of publications. It is this 
body of work that thi s research systematically analyses.  
 
The adoption of Artificial Intelligence in Public Administration also has the potential to increase the 
quality of the work carried out by Human Resources in the public sector. AI can optimize 
recruitment, selection, and talent management processes, making  it possible to analyze CVs and 
skills more efficiently. Then, intelligent systems can be decisive in identifying training needs and 
promoting the continuous development of employees. By automating routine tasks, HR 
professionals will be able to focus on m ore strategic activities, promoting a more efficient 
organizational environment adapted to the constantly evolving demands of public administration.  
In addition, AI will also have an impact on the cybersecurity of training and digital professions at the 
public level. Greater attention should be paid to the use of AI in cybersecurity in the validation of 
qualifications and competencies (e.g. recognition of diplomas). In other words, the ever -increasing 
complexity of the academic and professional environment will increasingly require AI -based 
support systems for decision -making that allow HR m anagers to adapt more quickly and access the 
right digital workforce, not least because electronic public services (e.g. e -health, e -learning, and e -
elderly) are set to increase exponentially (Floridi et al. 2021).  
 
The use of AI will introduce a rapid devaluation of many of today's skills and, consequently, a 
significant disruption to the labor market and the very nature of employment, with inherent 
consequences for the overall management of human resources in the Public Administration. Thus, 
prom oting the development of AI in support of new skills, while anticipating and mitigating its 
impact on current ones, will require careful management and some intergenerational solidarity 
between those disadvantaged today and those favored tomorrow, to ensur e that the disruptive 
transition between the present and the future is as fair as possible for everyone.  
 
This research uses a systematic literature review, procedurally supported by the PRISMA Protocol 
(Liberati et al. 2009; Moher et al., 2009; Page et al., 2021) for the selection and extraction of articles. 
By combining the search keys "Public administration ", "Artificial Intelligence", "e -government", 
"human resources" and "Jobs". The search resulted in a set of 100 documents published in journals, 
which constituted the research collection.

307 
This set of documents was analyzed using the traditional practices of systematic literature reviews, 
namely the type of articles, characterization of authorship, affiliations, and countries of origin, 
characterization of collaboration networks and origin o f contributions, and listing of article sources. 
These results made it possible to characterize scientific production on the subject.  
In addition to the descriptive exercise mentioned above, a content analysis of the collection was 
also carried out, which allowed for a deeper understanding of the concepts used and how they are 
structured. This analysis not only made it possible to determ ine the set of concepts that emerge as 
relevant when studying the implementation of artificial intelligence systems in public 
administration, with a focus on human resources.  
 
The research also made it possible to draw up a proposal for a research agenda on the subject.  
 
Keywords:  artificial intelligence, human resources, public administration, civil servants, systematic

ID:206  - Social -technical Approaches in AI: Building Inclusive AI Systems to 
Mitigate Social Bias  
Jerry Rhoads  
 
ABSTRACT  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has permeated various aspects of our lives. According to Jiang et al. (2017), 
"The underlying ‘backbone’ technology that supports AI is machine learning, in which algorithms can 
learn from existing data sets, identify patterns,  and make decisions without being explicitly 
programmed to do so" (p. 231). AI is used commercially from hiring decisions to loan application 
screening, from sentencing guidelines for judges to law enforcement’s facial recognition systems 
and beyond (Mehra bi et al., 2021). As these AI systems learn from human -generated data, they can 
also learn and perpetuate social biases, and not surprisingly –they have (Aizenberg et al., 2023). As 
Zajko (2021) noted “In the literature on data science, ML, and AI, the imp licit general definition of 
bias (in AI) is any tendency, pattern, or association that is problematic” (p. 2).  
 
Social bias is “discrimination for or against a person or group or a set of ideas or beliefs in a way 
that is prejudicial or unfair and behaving in a way that disadvantages a person or group or 
advantages another” (Webster et al., 2022, p. 131). Social bia s in AI is more than just an engineering 
or technical problem; it requires extending our view into the more extensive social system in which 
it operates (Dolata et al., 2021). Hence, “social -technical approaches in AI are an emerging area that 
requires a b road set of disciplines” (National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST], 2022, p. 
3) to understand the interactions between people, technology, organizations and the development 
of AI systems. Given the potential roles played by leaders and human r esource development 
professionals in guiding the development of inclusive and bias -free AI systems, the purpose of this 
literature review working paper informed by ethical leadership (Brown et a., 2005) and social 
learning theories (Banduare, 1977) is to u nderstand the relationships between the social systems 
and the design of AI systems and the factors influencing the design of inclusive and bias -free AI 
products.

ID:207  - The Influence of Digital Leadership on Innovative Work Behavior: The 
Mediating Roles of Psychological Capital and Job Crafting  
Youngjoo Song  & Yoonhee Park  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
In the era of digital transformation, organizations must enhance competitiveness through 
continuous innovation. Organizational innovation is derived from the innovative behaviors of 
individuals within the organization. Promoting individual innovative work behaviors through 
effective leadership becomes crucial. Therefore, this study focuses on digital leadership, a new 
leadership style essentially needed the  digital transformation era. Moreover, actual behavioral 
changes in individuals are influenced not only by environmental factors such as leadership but also 
by individual characteristics like individual’s psychology or attitudes. Thus, the aim of this stud y is to 
analyze the influence of digital leadership on innovative work behaviors by considering the 
mediating roles of individual psychological capital and job crafting in this relationship between the 
digital leadership and innovative work behaviors.  
 
To achieve the research purpose, data were collected from 250 employees working in large South 
Korean companies using a survey. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling 
with SPSS 29.0 and AMOS 29.0 package programs.  
 
The findings of this study are as follows. First, employees’ perceptions of their supervisors’ digital 
leadership significantly influence their innovative work behaviors. Second, the sequential mediating 
roles of psychological capital and job crafting were  found in this relationship. Thus, this study 
contributed to revealing structural relationships among digital leadership, psychological capital, job 
crafting, and innovative work behaviors. Based on the results of this study, academic and practical 
implica tions in HRD were presented by expanding the understanding in existing leadership research 
and offering managerial strategies for organizations.

ID:208  - The Influence of Organizational Digital Transformation Competences 
on Individual Job Performance: The Mediating Roles of Organizational 
Supportive Learning Environment and Individual Readiness for Change  
Jisoo KIM  & Yoonhee P ark 
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This study investigated the influence of organizational digital transformation competences on 
individual job performance and considered organizational supportive learning environment and 
individual readiness for change as mediators. For this purpose, data was collected from employees 
working in large enterprises using a snowballing sampling in South Korea.. Out of a total of 260 
responses collected, 252 were used for final analysis after excluding 8 responses that did not align 
with the study's objectives. Those collected data were analyzed using SPSS 29.0 and AMOS 26.0. The 
findings of the study are as follows: Firstly, an analysis of differences in an organization's digital 
transformation competences based on industry and organizational size revealed that while there 
were no significant differences based on industry, statistically significant evidence suggested that 
larger organizations tend to have better digital transformation capabilities. Secondly, an 
organizational digital transformation competences si gnificantly positively influenced individual job 
performance. Thirdly, the organizational supportive learning environment did not mediate in the 
relationship between an organizational digital transformation competences and individual job 
performance. Fourt hly, individual readiness for change mediated the relationship between an 
organizational digital transformation competences and individual job performance. Lastly, in 
examining the dual mediating role of the organizational supportive learning environment a nd 
individual readiness for change in the relationship between an organizational digital transformation 
competences and individual job performance, significant positive mediating roles were confirmed. 
Based on the results, this study suggests HRD implicati ons in research and practice, limitations, and 
suggestions for future research.

ID:213  - Professionals Learning while Working Remotely in the Digital Era: 
Implications for HRD  
Cierra Woods  & Maria Cseh  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The aftermath of the Covid -19 pandemic and the ongoing emergence of new digital technology, 
mandates that today’s organizations continuously adapt how they work and how they learn to 
maintain their competitive edge. The global pandemic has stressed the nee d for businesses to 
incorporate technology into their business models to enable human connection, belonging, and 
creativity in the modern workplace (Dean & Campbell, 2020). Covid -19 stressed the essential role of 
learning and development, as professionals were tasked to facilitate a seemingly overnight 
transition to remote work and use innovative learning practices to produce and sustain a wholly 
digital learning environment (Hughes, 2021).  
 
Learning and Development (L&D) is considered a key function of many organizations and is now 
“almost exclusively online” (Pugh et al., 2018; Govender & Adegbite, 2022). The Association for 
Talent Development (ATD) defines L&D as “a function within an organ ization that is responsible for 
empowering employees’ growth and developing their knowledge, skills, and capabilities to drive 
better business performance” (What Is Learning and Development?, 2023, par #1). Separated from a 
traditional working space, and f rom supervisors and office peers, continuous learning, effective 
communication, and maintaining collaboration are crucial for L&D professionals’ career success in 
virtual work environments (Yarberry & Sims, 2021).  
 
According to Govender and Adegbite (2022), the technological advancements of the 21st century 
mandates a high level of learning agility to improve how L&D professionals learn in the workplace. 
These professionals must develop extensive social capital, inte rnal and external to their 
organization, and competence in digital technologies. They need to know how technology works, 
have the discernment to select appropriate and adaptable technology to meet the needs of the 
workforce, and understand technology devel opment (Hughes, 2021).   
 
For many, working remotely has blurred boundaries between one’s personal and professional 
environments. These obscured lines have increased opportunities for some to engage in informal 
workplace learning through reflection, feedback, and fulfilling one’s o wn ideas, while for others, has 
served as an additional stressor that could diminish learning performance and one’s motivation to 
learn (Muhlenbrock et al., 2023). Nonetheless, technology not only enables informal learning, but 
also massively extends the m eans available to learn on one’s own (Watkins et al., 2018).  
Given the significance and known benefits of effective L&D and society’s expanding reliance on 
digital technologies, there is a dearth of research on how L&D professionals, who work remotely, 
learn in preparation to facilitate the learning of others. Infor med by informal learning, 
transformational learning, and generative learning theories, the purpose of this literature review 
working paper is to understand 1) how professionals learn when working remotely due to the 
COVID -19 pandemic; 2) what are the facto rs influencing their learning; and 3) how their learning 
experiences impact their professional identity. The paper will conclude with implications for human 
and organizational development (HRD) professionals working remotely while facilitating others’ 
learning and development in this digital era.

ID:214  - Educating the Digital Native Generation of Physicians in American 
Medicine: Generation Z in Graduate Medical Education Trainee Programs  
Jennifer Pomicter  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The current generation of medical students that are preparing to graduate medical school and 
enter residency are proving to have different motivators and educational needs than previous 
generations of residents (Eckleberry -Hunt et al., 2018). As Generation Z (born 1995 – 2010) is known 
as the first truly digital native generation, they rely more heavily on digital learning than previous 
generations in higher education settings (Eckleberry -Hunt et al., 2018; Shore y et al., 2021). The 
recent global COVID -19 pandemic has also had a large influence on their medical school learning 
experiences (Gallagher et al., 2022).  
 
As medical students graduate from medical schools in the United States of America, they prepare 
for the next step in their journey to becoming a physician. This transition is marked by the students 
becoming Graduate Medical Education (GME) Trainees, also k nown as Interns or Residents in 
American medical education (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023). The chosen specializations 
within medicine, such as Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Dermatology, Surgery, lead these trainees to 
their specialized training p rogram or Residency (ACGME Institutional Requirements, 2022; 
Fairbrother, 2023). These residency training programs can range from three to five years or more, 
depending on the specialty of training (ACGME Specialties, n.d.). These years are vital to the 
education and training of new physicians. They learn, not only the foundational knowledge of their 
chosen specialty, but also gain the clinical experience and familiarity necessary to interact with 
patients and navigate the American medical system. This type  of learning is rooted in progressive 
interaction with superiors, peers, and patients in the clinical setting (Ryan et al., 2022). Active 
learning of this type is situated in the experiences of the GME Residents as they participate in the 
clinical communit y they want to become a part of (Lave & Wenger, 1991). And because GME training 
takes place in a real world clinical setting, it is impacted by current and historical events (Silkens et 
al., 2023). Thus, the years spent in Residency are vital to the matura tion of autonomously 
functioning physicians, ready to practice independently (Ryan et al., 2022).  
 
While national accrediting bodies outline the basic requirements for GME training completion, 
individual programs are left to interpret the execution of training to meet these requirements. 
Informed by the Situated Learning Theory (Lave & Wenger, 1991), th e purpose of this literature 
review working paper is to understand the approaches to learning (e.g., digital learning) of 
Generation Z medical residents and the facilitation of learning of this digital native generation 
during their GME training. The paper  will conclude with implications for learning and human 
resource development professionals working in the medical field in our digital age.

ID:222  - A Study on the Roles and Competencies of Curator Changed by Digital 
Exhibition Environment  
Hyewon Kang, Mirae Oh  & Yoonhee Park  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
As the cultural industry era progresses, the significance of cultural experiences and cultural tourism 
is escalating, posing new challenges for cultural institutions like museums to maintain and increase 
their appeal. Particularly noteworthy is the profound impact of technological advancements, 
spurred by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, on the exhibition experience in museums. This 
evolution fosters the adoption of virtual exhibition systems and the creation of multi -sensory 
experience content. Consequently, it is important to understand the roles and competencies 
required of Curator due to the changed virtual environment.  
This study aims to analyze the roles and competencies required of museum professionals in the 
changed digital exhibition environment. To explore this, the Behavioral Event Interview (BEI) 
method was employed. This approach targeted curator with over three years of practical 
experience in digital exhibitions. The interview framework, grounded in the STAR (Situation, Task, 
Action, Result) methodology, provided a comprehensive view of real -life scenarios, responsibilities, 
actions taken, and outcomes.  
 
The findings reveal that curator must extend their repertoire beyond traditional roles and 
competencies. This research found that the curator should develop competencies in exhibition -
related techniques, proficiency in humanities and social sciences, an un derstanding of new media 
and technologies, skills in exhibition communication and public relations, and the capacity to 
respond to global environmental changes. Based on the results, this study suggests HRD 
implications in research and practice, limitation s, and suggestions for future research.  
 
This study contributes significantly to understanding the evolving roles of curator in a digital 
exhibition context, offering valuable perspectives for further research and practical applications in 
related fields.

ID:230  - AI and the Changing Nature of Work: Implications for HRD  
Mengying Cao  & Maria Cseh  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) consists of systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, 
such as understanding language, recognizing voices, learning, and solving problems. AI 
advancements have allowed machines to exhibit human -like intelligen ce and adaptability (Russell & 
Norvig, 2021). Over the past few years, the rapid growth and adoption of AI technology has had a 
profound impact on a number of fields, such as healthcare, financial services, and manufacturing. In 
order to understand how and  why AI is being implemented in the workplace, and its impact on 
management, working conditions and skills needs, the OECD conducted a survey study (Lane et al., 
2023) with 5,334 employees and 2,053 companies in the manufacturing and financial sectors in 
Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. 
The findings of the study show that AI is changing significantly the nature of work. AI in the 
workplace boosts productivity and enhances quality, but also leads  to job displacement and skills 
mismatches, necessitating reskilling (Bukartaite & Hooper, 2023; Cazzaniga et al., 2024). Everett 
Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations Theory provides insights into how technological changes are 
adopted within an organization (G arcía‐Avilés, 2020) and highlight the importance of developing 
HRD practices that are not only responsive to technological advancements but also aligned with the 
learners' needs and organizational goals.  
 
The literature indicates that reskilling in an AI -driven economy is a continuous learning process 
(Pradhan & Saxena, 2023). The literature also shows the critical role of strategic thinking in 
facilitating AI integration within organizations, highlighting the need for workforce learning and 
development programs in both technical and soft skills to effectively harness AI's potential 
(Morandini et al.,  2023). These programs are increasingly focusing on not only imparting technical 
know -how of AI systems but also fostering adaptability, problem -solving, and ethical understanding, 
essential for navigating the nuanced challenges presented by AI in the workplace. Considering 
human -AI collaboration, there are diverse attitudes towards AI ranging from viewing AI as  a 
supportive tool to skepticism about its functionality (Einola & Khoreva, 2023). HRD professionals are 
called to design interventions to create learning opportunities to offset the negative impacts of AI 
and highlighting the need for organizational and e ducational strategies to develop expertise in AI -
integrated workplaces (Ardichvili, 2022; Einola & Khoreva, 2023).  
 
 Uncertainties remain regarding the long -term effects of AI on employment trends, specific future 
skill requirements, and effective learning approaches. The need for future studies emphasizes 
understanding AI's broader societal impacts, ethical considerati ons, and strategies for integrating AI 
into workplaces effectively. Thus, the purpose of this conceptual paper based on a systematic 
literature review is to discuss the relationship between AI and the changing nature of work taking in 
consideration the abo ve mentioned elements, and the implication for HRD in organization.

ID:231  - Reshaping the Deal: Transforming Psychological Contracts for 
Millennial/Gen Z Employees in a Digital Future  
Hanna McCathren  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The COVID -19 pandemic triggered a global experiment in remote and hybrid work, particularly 
impacting Millennial and Gen Z employees who make up nearly half of the U.S. civilian population 
(Toossi, 2015).  Historically, the baby -boomer generation has made up a large portion of both the 
U.S. population and labor force participation. With a large number of that generation now at 
retirement age, projections show the younger generations taking up a larger percentage of the 
labor force in coming years, making un derstanding their employment needs and expectations vital 
for the health of the U.S. economy.   
 
Shaped by social norms, organizational culture, and past experiences, a psychological contract, is an 
individual's subjective belief system about the reciprocal obligations that exist between themselves 
and their employer (Rousseau, 1989). The purpose of t his conceptual working paper is to explore a 
shift in U.S. workers’ psychological contracts, from previous generations who had traditionally 
commuted to a work -site to Millennial and Gen Z employees, digital natives, who have increasingly 
engaged in digita l spaces, even prior to the mass shift to remote and hybrid work caused by the 
pandemic (Ferrazzi, 2023).  
 
Drawing on existing research and literature, the aim of this paper is to compare the more 
traditional, in -person psychological contracts of previous generations with the emerging contracts 
of remote and hybrid Millennial and Gen Z workers, born between 198 1 and 1996, and between 
1997 and 2012, respectively (Dimock, 2019). Mezirow’s (1978) transformative learning theory is used 
to interpret increasing global digitization and the COVID -19 pandemic as disorienting dilemmas that 
have triggered perspective trans formations for many U.S. employees and resulted in a noticeable 
shift in their unwritten mutual expectations between themselves and their employers (Ferrazzi, 
2023). The paper will present how these shifts challenge traditional Human Resource Development 
(HRD) learning and development approaches, as well as management practices, with a focus on 
factors such as autonomy, trust, communication, career development, and work -life integration.  
The paper concludes with a discussion on how organizations should adapt to meet the diverse 
needs and expectations of Millennial and Gen Z employees in a digital future through fostering 
flexible learning ecosystems, prioritizing personalized development o pportunities, and cultivating 
managerial competencies built on trust, effective communication, and outcome -based performance 
management. By understanding and adapting to these evolving psychological contracts, 
practitioners can play a crucial role in attra cting, retaining, and developing a thriving Millennial/Gen 
Z workforce in the digital age.

ID:237  - Responsible leadership for Artificial Intelligence: what competencies 
should matter  
Ally Memon  & Sateesh Shet  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to permeate various sectors and profoundly impact our lives, 
the need for ethical, accountable, and empathetic leadership becomes paramount.  AI, with its 
immense potential, brings about transformative changes acro ss industries, revolutionizing 
processes, decision -making, and human interactions. However, its rapid advancement raises ethical 
concerns, including biases in algorithms, potential job displacement, data privacy infringements, 
and the overarching impact on  society. Leaders must ensure that AI systems are developed and 
used in a manner aligned with ethical principles, considering their societal and workplace 
implications. This includes addressing biases in AI algorithms, ensuring fairness and transparency, 
and safeguarding against unintended consequences. Further, AI should serve humanity and not 
overshadow human values or compromise workplace safety and employee wellbeing. Responsible 
leaders should be able to prioritize the human element, ensuring that AI a ugments human 
capabilities while preserving dignity, empathy, and the human touch in decision -making processes. 
Organizations that prioritize ethical AI practices are likely to gain the trust of stakeholders, foster 
innovation, mitigate risks, and sustaina bly navigate the complexities of the AI -driven world. Thus, 
responsible leadership in the age of AI requires a delicate balance between technological 
advancement and ethical considerations. With this background, this study asks – ‘’what 
competencies are re levant for responsible leadership in an AI world’’? The outcome of this research 
contributes to identifying the critical competencies that leaders need to practice in organisations 
and society.  
 
The study examines the views of practitioner postgraduate students undertaking leadership studies 
about competencies they believe are relevant for responsible leadership in the age of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) at individual, group, organisational and so cietal levels.

ID:161  - Inclusive Leadership Development in HRD  
Zaineb El Ouazzani  & Barbara Eversole  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The paper undertakes an in -depth exploration of inclusive leadership within human resource 
development (HRD), identified as a key factor for the success of organizations in a professional 
environment characterized by increased diversity and constant change (Pless & Maak, 2004). This 
multidimensional analysis embraces several key aspects, such as diversity management, leadership 
and inclusion, as well as the a doption of an inclusive organizational culture (Barak, 2000). The aim is 
to develop innovative and effective strategies for training leaders adapted to contemporary 
challenges and requirements.  
 
With this in mind, the study focuses on how inclusive leadership principles can be effectively 
integrated and implemented in HRD strategies. It examines the processes and approaches by which 
organizations can transform their policies and practices to promo te a working environment that 
welcomes and values diversity in all its forms. This involves a thorough review of internal policies, 
training programs for managers and employees, and the implementation of practices aimed at 
cultivating an organizational cul ture that actively recognizes and celebrates diversity. The aim is to 
highlight the crucial importance of creating a working environment where talent diversity is not 
simply recognized, but actively encouraged and valued, thereby making a significant contr ibution to 
organizational innovation and growth. This requires a profound transformation of management 
practices and skills development strategies within HR departments.  
 
The analysis also extends to the impact of inclusive leadership on organizational performance, team 
dynamics and project management. It is crucial to assess how inclusive leaders can encourage 
innovation, creativity and productivity by harnessing the wealt h of diverse perspectives, experiences 
and skills present within their teams. The study highlights the importance of leaders developing an 
empathetic and flexible approach, fostering a spirit of collaboration and mutual respect.  
The role of Human Resources Development (HRD) in establishing and promoting such leadership is 
of paramount importance (Torraco & Lundgren, 2019). This involves designing training and 
development programs that not only raise awareness of the benefits of di versity and inclusion, but 
also instill practical skills for integrating these values into day -to-day management.  
 
The paper also looks at how integrating inclusive leadership into HRD strategies transforms the 
internal dynamics of organizations. This involves changing internal policies to foster a more open 
and collaborative environment. More inclusive and interactive  workspaces are created, encouraging 
the exchange of ideas and strengthening team cohesion. Similarly, transparent and respectful 
communication is promoted, which is essential to building a working atmosphere where diversity is 
not only accepted, but also seen as an indispensable asset for organizational prosperity and 
innovation. These changes require a holistic and well -structured approach, involving all levels of the 
organization. Leaders need to set an example by adopting inclusive behaviors, while comp any 
policies and practices need to be reviewed to ensure that inclusion is integrated into all aspects of 
organizational functioning. This includes, but is not limited to, recruitment processes, performance 
appraisals, professional development initiatives and career progression opportunities. These 
transformations within HR departments and organizations as a whole are crucial to establishing a 
working climate where diversity is embraced as a key component of success and innovation.

322 
Inclusive leadership, supported by effective HRD strategies, paves the way for more dynamic, 
creative and successful work environments.  
 
The analysis examines the impact of an inclusive leadership approach to human resources 
development (HRD) on the creation of fairer, more inclusive organizational cultures. Adopting this 
approach is seen as a major catalyst for employee engagement, fosteri ng a workplace where every 
voice is heard and valued (Kuknor & Bhattacharya, 2020). This integration of diverse perspectives 
not only strengthens collaboration between employees; it also significantly improves organizational 
performance by fostering a bett er understanding and appreciation of diverse experiences and skills. 
In the context of the digital age, characterized by unique challenges and opportunities, the inclusive 
approach is becoming increasingly important (Gabor & Brooks, 2017). Digital technolo gies, by 
transforming modes of communication and interaction, offer new ways of effectively integrating 
and managing diversity within companies (Bouncken, Kraus, & Roig -Tierno, 2019). Not only do these 
technologies facilitate remote collaboration and inter cultural communication, but they also make it 
possible to develop training and professional development strategies tailored to the needs of 
diversity and inclusion (Garro -Abarca, Palos -Sánchez, & Aguayo -Camacho, 2021). The study 
examines the theoretical fo undations of inclusive leadership, drawing on key theories and relevant 
research to develop a conceptual model. These include Jean Piaget's theory of social 
transformation, which highlights the importance of adaptation and integration in the learning and 
development process, and Daniel Goleman's theory of emotional intelligence, which emphasizes 
the importance of self -awareness and empathy in leadership. Other theoretical references include 
Greenleaf's work on servant leadership, highlighting the importance  of serving others in a 
leadership position, and Crenshaw's research on intersectionality, which sheds light on how various 
identities intersect and interact in the professional context. These theoretical approaches provide a 
solid foundation for the devel opment of a conceptual model of inclusive leadership. This framework 
is designed to ensure the rigor and relevance of the approach, offering an analytical tool for 
understanding and applying inclusive leadership in a variety of organizational contexts. The  model 
aims to establish links between the theoretical principles of inclusive leadership and their practical 
applications in the real world, taking into account the contemporary realities of work environments.  
In the face of rapidly changing demographics and increasingly complex global business 
environments, the importance of adopting comprehensive and innovative strategies for inclusive 
leadership development is highlighted. This paper proposes an innovative co nceptual framework 
for integrating the principles of equity and inclusion into leadership development programs. This 
framework highlights the growing importance of digital technology in facilitating and strengthening 
inclusive leadership initiatives, offer ing new opportunities for tomorrow's leaders to engage with 
their teams in more meaningful and effective ways.  
 
Building on a solid theoretical foundation, this study explores various theories and previous 
research that shed light on the inclusive leadership approach. Building on a solid theoretical 
foundation, this study explores various theories and previous resea rch that inform the inclusive 
leadership approach. Among these foundations are important contributions from social 
transformation theory, emotional intelligence, servant leadership, and concepts of intersectionality, 
which together form a robust framework for our understanding of inclusive leadership. The detailed 
analysis of existing literature, coupled with the development of a conceptual model, ensures not 
only the academic rigor of the research, but also its practical applicability. Implications for res earch 
include the opportunity to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms by which inclusive 
leadership can be cultivated and implemented in diverse organizational environments. This opens 
the way for future studies that could explore the relationship be tween inclusive leadership and 
variables such as organizational performance, innovation, and employee well -being. On the 
practical side, the implications are vast. The conceptual model developed in this study offers HRD 
professionals a framework for effect ively integrating inclusive leadership practices into their 
organizations. This includes strategies for leadership training and development, modifying

323 
organizational policies to foster inclusion, and creating a corporate culture that values diversity. 
These practical applications enable organizations to better navigate an increasingly diverse and 
interconnected business landscape, increasing their compet itiveness and capacity for innovation.  
Research provides a renewed and essential theoretical perspective, highlighting how the principles 
of inclusive leadership can be effectively and strategically integrated into HRD practices. By 
orienting the future of leadership towards greater inclusion a nd adaptability, this paper charts a 
path towards a human resources management that is not only responsive to the challenges of the 
digital age, but also proactive in promoting a diverse and inclusive organizational culture.

ID:20  - An HRD multi -level framework to address workplace bullying  
 
Helen Meyer  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Workplace bullying (WB) is a significant, current concern in all workplaces around the globe. Due to 
its high prevalence, human resource development professionals consider WB one of the most 
serious challenges in the workplace. This paper extends the literature by proposing a WB 
framework with HRD strategies on various levels to address where WB originate s. The framework 
ensues from the findings of a concurrent mixed methods study, rooted in pragmatism, that 
investigated WB and its impact on staff’s health and a recent literature review. The researcher 
collected (and analysed) both quantitative (survey) an d qualitative data (individual semi -structured 
interviews) separately and merged the results of both datasets in the interpretation. Purposeful 
convenience sampling was used to distribute the survey to a sample of 174 respondents in a higher 
education inst itution, while 29 respondents were also individually interviewed. The researcher 
collected (and analysed) both quantitative (survey) and qualitative data (individual semi -structured 
interviews) separately, whereafter, the results of both datasets were merg ed in the interpretation. 
Findings indicate the various levels where WB emerged. HRD can use the framework to address WB 
to create a respectful and supportive work environment to enhance overall employee well -being 
and organisational outcomes.

ID:28  -Promoting Sustainable Careers in Post -COVID Workplaces  
 
Khadija Al Arkoubi  & Vasiliki Kosmidou  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The COVID -19 pandemic has disrupted the career ecosystem globally, resulting in unprecedented 
changes in the world of work and significant challenges for workers and organizations. These 
disruptions are also threatening careers’ sustainability and requiring ag ile actions capable of 
restoring hope and faith in the future while increasing employees' and institutional resilience.  
In fact, COVID -19 has shaken individuals, teams, institutions, and societies generating major and 
unparalleled career shocks. The latter has been described as “disruptive and extraordinary events 
that are, at least to some degree, caused by factors outside  the individual's control and that trigger 
a deliberate thought process concerning one's career. The occurrence of a career shock can vary in 
terms of predictability and can be either positively or negatively valenced” (Akkermans, Seibert, and 
Mol, 2018, p .5). COVID -19 jeopardized work and careers in many ways:  
First, it led to widespread job losses, resignations, and economic instability. The International Labor 
Organization (ILO) estimates that the pandemic has resulted in the loss of 255 million full -time jobs 
globally in 2020 alone, with millions more workers  facing reduced hours and income (ILO, 2021). 
This substantial deterioration of the global labor market exacerbated the financial stress of 
vulnerable households, increased inequities and negatively impacted individuals’ general well -being. 
The ILO’s last projections suggest that a return to pre -pandemic performance remains elusive (ILO, 
2022).  
 
Second, it caused an unprecedented “people impact” complicating the work of both individuals and 
teams (Collings et al., 2021, p.821). The shift toward remote work or hybrid work models to comply 
with social distancing measures has created a "new normal" i n which individuals and organizations 
must adapt to novel ways of working. While this has allowed some workers to maintain their jobs 
during the pandemic, it has also created challenges related to work -life balance, access to 
resources, and social isolatio n (Owl Labs, 2021) as not all employees experience telework positively 
(Cañibano & Avgoustaki, 2022).  
 
Third, the levels of stress and burnout among employees skyrocketed. A survey by the American 
Psychological Association (APA) found that 78% of employed adults reported experiencing at least 
one symptom of stress, such as feeling overwhelmed or anxious, du ring the pandemic (APA, 2021). 
A study on a sample of 102 academics showed that 20% experienced high and prolonged levels of 
anxiety because of blurred work -life boundaries (Hughes & Donnelly, 2022). Another survey by 
Monster (2021) found that 69% of respo ndents reported experiencing burnout symptoms, such as 
exhaustion or decreased productivity. Those working in essential services and healthcare suffered 
more due to overwork and the sensitive nature of their work as first responders. According to a 
survey conducted by FlexJobs (2021), 42% of adults reported undesired weight changes due to 
stress. In addition, a global study by Gloster and colleagues (2020) examined the impact of the 
pandemic on mental health across 78 different countries using a sample of 9 ,565 individuals. The 
study found that on average, 10% of the sample reported low levels of mental health, while 
approximately 50% reported moderate levels. Some studies pointed to the fear of COVID -19 as a 
main cause of mental health decline (Simsir et al ., 2022) while others emphasized the intolerance of 
uncertainty (Elsharkawy and Abdelaziz, 2021) and a lack of quality of life due to social isolation 
(Szczepanska and Pietrzyka, 2021). This unprecedented state of burnout and low psychological well -
being h ad dramatic effects on performance, job satisfaction, and employee retention (Akgunduz et 
al., 2021).

326 
 
Finally, the pandemic has led to a growing trend of workers quitting their jobs, with many seeking 
new career paths or more flexible work arrangements. According to a report by Monster (2021), 
95% of workers were considering changing jobs, while a Microsof t survey (2021) found that 41% of 
the global workforce was considering leaving their employer within the next year.  
In response to these grand challenges and to the calls for more research on sustainable careers (De 
Vos et al., 2020; Mcdonald and Hite, 2018), we discuss in this paper the strategies organizations can 
embrace and promote to enable employees to experience meaningful work that leads to a greater 
sense of accomplishment and thriving while supporting organizational and societal growth. We 
draw from the scarce extant literature on sustainable careers as well as other disciplines such as 
organizational behavior,  sustainability, sociology, economics, and positive psychology to propose 
organizational approaches that foster and value sustainable careers.  
 
Since the concept of sustainable careers is still in an early stage of development, we will first explore 
the existing definitions to offer a comprehensive conceptualization for this construct. Second, we 
will identify the most effective organizational pra ctices leading to career sustainability in the 
changing world of work. Third, we propose some avenues on how to further research and 
discussions in this area among both academics and professionals.

ID:42  -Moments of surprise in leadership: A phenomenological study of their 
developmental influence  
 
Rachael Woodcock  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
The extent to which leaders learn to lead and how they might best do this continues to be a key 
question for researchers, educators and practitioners (Day et al., 2014; Edwards et al., 2013). This 
conference working paper explores the emerging findings fro m an ongoing PhD study which aims 
to explore interpretive insights (Cunliffe 2019, 2022) in terms of practical theories of the lived 
experience of the developing leader and how leadership is learned from relational ‘moments of 
surprise’ with others.    
 
Adopting a hermeneutic phenomenological perspective, it is hoped new insights or ways of thinking 
may emerge about what we know as leadership and what is involved in the developmental process 
of becoming a leader. In this sense, the study seeks to contribu te to the ‘critical turn’ for leadership 
research by developing insights that will ‘tell us something about the subjective, the personal and 
the interpersonal, about ideas and beliefs, about how people talk and dream about leadership’ 
(Ford, 2019, p.277); contributing to the theoretical understanding of an aspect of leadership 
research which has received less focus - the personal development of leaders over time 
(McDermott, Kidney and Flood, 2011).  
 
Theoretical base  
The study aims to contribute to the body of knowledge that advocates the importance of tacit, social 
and situated learning (Kempster and Stewart, 2010; Stead 2013). It is theoretically located from the 
perspective that leadership is a ’highly variable, rel ational and contextual phenomenon that people 
construct differently depending on who they are and how they interact with the world’ (Carroll, 
2019, p.128).  
 
It is increasingly recognised that leadership development involves felt/embodied experiences 
(Carroll and Smolovic Jones, 2018). Indeed felt experiences can be both key triggers for, and 
elements to support, meaning -making/learning from our experiences. Nu merous academics have 
explored the developmental power of such felt moments/events/conversations such as ‘moments 
of momentum’ (Sutherland 2013) and the various works of Cunliffe – ‘arresting moments’ (Cunliffe, 
2001), ‘moments of being struck’ (Cunliffe 2 002) and ‘poetic moments’ (Cunliffe 2018a). The latter 
drawing on the French philosopher, Ricoeur (1991), and their ideas on the rapturous effects of 
instants.  
 
Adopting an alternative phrase, this study explores the developmental impact of ‘moments of 
surprise’ arising from relational moments with others. Leaders identify such moments as spaces or 
times when they were called to stop and evaluate their lives in a significant way and encouraged 
personal consideration ‘of different possible ways in which we might relate ourselves to our 
understanding’ (Shotter, 2008, p.108).  
 
Research purpose  
The overarching aim is to explore the developmental influence of ‘moments of surprise’ on leaders. 
The paper will explore emerging findings drawn from in -depth qualitative interviews with ten 
leaders.

329 
 
Research Questions  
This working paper aims to explore the emerging findings of leader perceptions and 
understandings of:  
(a) how selected moments have influenced what they think and feel about leadership – what is 
their understanding of the phenomenon.  
(b) how selected moments have influenced their developmental journey of becoming a leader.  
 
Implications for HRD practice  
Through exploring practical theories of the lived experience of the developing leader, new insights 
or ways of thinking about what we know as leadership and what is involved in the developmental 
process of becoming a leader could aid individuals (researche rs, educators and HRD practitioners). 
Such insights could contribute to our understanding of the developmental importance of ‘moments 
of surprise’ within leadership practice, which could be used to inform the design of leadership 
development programmes.  
 
Conclusion  
As a working paper, emerging findings from the on -going data analysis will be presented for 
consideration by the conference community and feedback will be sought to aid ongoing analysis.

ID:44  -Unraveling the Paradox: The Persistence of Bad Leadership  
 
Vivian Ikechukwu -Ifudu  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
Everyone complains about bad leadership, yet these followers are the leaders amongst us. This 
study uses available digital technology to highlight this paradox through surveys.  
The study will focus on peoples’ reaction to bad leadership and why it persists in every sector.  
Bad leadership practices and behaviors are detrimental, ineffective, harmful to individuals, society, 
and organisations at large. Bad leadership has been known to cause poor economic indices such as 
poverty, poor health care delivery, insecurity and agitat ion which leads to civil unrest. It leaves 
detrimental consequences to nations which may suffer the effects in years. For organisations, it 
leads to low employee morale, decreased productivity, and organisational dysfunction and high 
employee turnover. In severe cases, it could lead to the death of economically viable 
companies/organisations.  
 
Theoretical base  
Theoretical frameworks from leadership studies will shed light on nuanced relations shaping 
leadership. Five types of bad leadership theories will be explored. To gain knowledge on bad 
leadership, a qualitative survey is used which served the most appropriate methodology within a 
phenomenological research paradigm, using semi structured questionnaires. This is combined with 
some quantitative descriptive statistical analysis using factors derived from the initial review of 
literature conducted.  
 
Literature on leadership, characteristics and behaviour of bad leaders, followers/individuals will be 
considered. Using data from a semi structure questionnaire sent to 83 individuals from different 
works of life, accountability and responsibility in leade rship is investigated. The analysis confirms 
that bad leadership comes from the same people who experienced it firsthand. Our leaders are us. 
We are our leaders.  
 
Research purpose  
This paper explores followers/individuals’ reactions to bad leadership practices and its 
consequences - poor and ineffective leadership. It takes a reflective and historical perspective based 
on individuals’ feelings.  
 
Research questions  
• Why do bad leaders prevail?  
• What factors influence bad leadership?  
• How are bad leaders perceived by people?  
• What can be done to prevent bad leadership in the society?  
 
The abstract highlights the interconnectedness of paradox and bad leadership and the contextual 
nature of leadership ineffectiveness.  
Factors such as non -accountability, incompetence, integrity is explored to understand their roles in 
perpetuating negative leadership outcomes.  
 
This paper will argue that the perceived bad leadership practices and behaviour affect followers. 
Yet, when in leadership positions we fail to change the way bad leaders lead. The leadership

331 
development process must adopt and achieve four objectives – get feedback, train these leaders, 
equip them to be emotionally intelligent so they can be accountable to their actions and the 
common leadership objectives.  
 
Implications for HRD practice  
Leadership is about HRD. HR identifies and grooms’ leaders.  
The research discusses the paradox of bad leadership and why it continues to persist.  
A sizeable proportion of leaders lack integrity as followers see them as grossly incompetent, selfish 
and lacking in accountability. These followers easily identify these incompetence's yet graduate to 
become these same leaders soon enough.  
Bad leadership creates stress in followers which has an adverse effect on the organisation/society 
or where leadership is required.  
These implications for practice can affect other sectors faced with bad leadership.  
 
Conclusions  
The results illustrated that bad leadership is us. As long as human nature abhors changes and 
struggles with persistence in following through on what needs to be done, we will continue to 
choose amongst us flawed individuals who reflect our personal lives.  
There is evidence to suggest that the concept of accountability, integrity and responsibility is lacking 
in this context.   
The paper, therefore, will provide valuable insights and contributions to current discourse on the 
paradox of bad leadership and its prevalence, and an understanding of how so many factors like 
lack of vision, selfishness, and more affects leadership.

ID:60  - Perception of Public Policies in Leadership  
 
Elisabete Fialho, Maria José Sousa  & Ana Moreira  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The main objective of this study is to study the perception of public policies on recruitment, training, 
and evaluation of managers in the Portuguese Public Administration. To this end, managers and 
other workers in the central state administration answere d a questionnaire about their perception 
of public policies, making suggestions for improving and building public policies.  
The sample consisted of 442 participants, workers from the Portuguese Public Administration. Of 
these participants, 122 hold managerial positions, and 320 do not hold managerial positions.  
Regarding recruitment, the participants who hold managerial positions value competence and 
experience first and foremost. Transparency, impartiality, and speed in tenders were the second 
most mentioned aspects; here, respondents gave examples of how to put  this idea into practice by 
having tenders carried out by specific entities in a position to do so or by allocating human 
resources prepared for the purpose. The responses from participants who do not hold managerial 
positions focused on the transparency, impartiality, and speed of competition. The most mentioned 
characteristics were valuing competence and experience, valuing remuneration, and fighting 
corruption. Several respondents pointed out that this last aspect could be combated by not allowing 
family  members or workers with other connections to be hired.  
 
About training, both the participants in management positions and those not in management 
positions listed training in specific areas appropriate to the position. However, what differentiates 
them are the areas each mentions as specific to the position. Participants in management positions 
considered the following to be important: so ft skills, conflict management, human resources 
management, project management, accounting, finance, law, public procurement, focus groups, 
hygiene, safety and health at work, SIADAP (performance management and evaluation system), 
ethics and sustainability . Next, the most mentioned characteristics were making training 
compulsory, carrying out employee surveys to define training, increasing the range of training on 
offer, training enabling career progression and establishing protocols with external bodies. T he 
participants who do not hold managerial positions considered the following areas: law, public 
policy, English, IT, sustainability, human resources, public service, motivation, emotional intelligence, 
mental health, or public procurement. Next, the two m ost essential aspects mentioned were the 
employee survey to define training and the increase in the training offer.  
 
Finally, concerning evaluation, the participants who hold management positions mentioned the 
360º evaluation. Next, the most mentioned aspects were the revision of SIADAP (faster career 
progression and annual evaluation) and the creation of indicators for meeting objectives. Those 
who do not hold management positions mentioned the abolition/revision of quotas. In this sense, it 
was often said that quotas should only exist for achieving excellence. Next, the most mentioned 
aspects were the revision of SIADAP  (such as faster career progression, annual evaluation, 
simplification of the process, objectives to be met being defined according to the organic unit in 
which the workers are located), the fight against corruption/increased transparency in the process 
and 360º evaluation.  
 
In this study, several suggestions were made for areas where we consider it essential to reformulate 
or develop new public policies. Based on the knowledge acquired from the literature review on 
leadership and its associated concepts, the way public admini stration works internationally and in 
Portugal, the survey of existing public policies in OECD countries, the European Union (Eurostat -

333 
Public Administrations in the EU member states, 2020) and Portugal about the recruitment, training 
and assessment of managers in public administration and, finally, the results obtained from the 
survey of managers and other workers in direct public adminis tration bodies.  
 
We believe it is extremely important for Portugal to follow the current trends of countries that have 
shown that the techniques applied have achieved very positive results, but also to make the 
necessary adaptations considering the country's reality, speci ficities, strengths and weaknesses. 
And following the winning trends that have already been applied to encourage innovation in the 
public sector through actions that make sense in the Portuguese context.  
 
Taking into account these recent trends in European countries and the characteristics of public 
administration in Portugal (Eurostat - Public Administrations in the EU member states, 2020), we 
believe that it is essential to invest in reformulating public policies on recruitment in the following 
areas: improving the attractiveness of public employment; combating the ageing of public 
employment; reviewing the remuneration status of managerial positions; the possibility of awarding 
remuneration bonuses accord ing to results; valuing competence and experience in recruitment; 
transparency, impartiality and speed in tenders; combating corruption.  
 
It is becoming essential for Portugal to implement measures to recruit and retain talent and 
increase motivation, with particular attention to digital skills as a prerequisite, assessing social 
values and sustainability, and getting closer to the recruitme nt methods used in the private sector.  
We also believe that it is essential to invest in reformulating public training policies in the following 
areas since the legal framework for professional training in the Public Administration has remained 
practically unchanged since Decreto -lei no. 50/98 entered into effect, amended by Decreto -lei 70 -
A/2000, of May 5, and Decreto -lei 174/2001, of May 31: training should focus on specific areas 
appropriate to the position; employee surveys should be carried out to define training courses; the 
training offer  should be increased; academic training should be valued for career progression; 
protocols should be established with external entities.  
 
Finally, we believe it is essential to invest in reformulating public policies on evaluation in the 
following areas: reformulating SIADAP, creating 360º evaluation, reviewing management careers, 
promoting workers' autonomy, and finding new (digital) forms of performance control.  
It is hoped that this analysis of existing public policies will contribute to formulating new public 
policies better adapted to leaders' reality and needs.

ID:69  - The adoption of complex problem -solving practices and its impact in 
companies’ ability to address strategic challenges  
Joao Loureiro  & Leandro Pereira  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Today’s world is characterized by a fast paced, constantly evolving environment, presenting 
companies and business managers with more complex, uncertain and urgent challenges than ever 
before. To remain relevant, companies need to be alert, permanently identifying and addressing 
potential threats and opportunities. Continu ous transformation plays a determinant role for 
companies who strive and are successful. However, more than just solutions’ definition or decision -
making processes, it is of the utmost importance to understand how companies identify, analyze, 
prioritize an d overcome these challenges. Due to its nature, strategic problems often entail a much 
higher risk than recurrent or at least known problems, thus becoming critical to analyze how 
business managers approach such problems.  
 
For that matter, building on prior research of complex problem solving, the key research objective 
of this study is to attempt to identify what factors influence business managers’ approach selection, 
when facing a strategic problem, and how do they adapt their behavior depending on the 
complexity, uncertainty and urgency of the problem.  
 
This objective arose from a holistic analysis of ten prior research issues and seeks to better 
understand and further develop the existing knowledge about the following questions: How do 
companies set the agenda of problem solving? To what extent do compan ies adopt scientific 
problem solving processes? Which factors have a greater impact towards the application of a 
systematic approach? Can unfamiliarity affect the type of capabilities selected to solve problems? 
Does the outlook of the situation affect the  problem solver judgment? What reasons influence the 
problem solving governance framework? To what extent do problem solvers promote a 
collaborative and interactive process? What kind of mechanisms do companies use to solve 
conflicts? Which kind of stakeho lder management model do companies use? To what extent do 
companies adopt a joint problem solving process?  
 
To enable a comprehensive view of the subject, the study is structured as follows. A first chapter 
providing a broad perspective of the existing problem solving literature, breaking it down into an 
overview of the process, the main phases towards problem r esolution and the types of capabilities, 
cognitive styles, stakeholders’ management and approaches used within problem solving. 
Subsequently, a second chapter with the description of the research methodology, the main issues, 
research questions and objecti ves that led to this study and the research instrument used to gather 
the necessary empirical evidence. Finally, two last chapters with an extensive and inclusive analysis 
of the interviews’ findings, as well as the identification of the research limitatio ns and 
recommendations for future fields of work.  
 
Keywords:  The adoption of complex problem -solving practices and its impact in companies’ ability 
to address strategic challenges.

ID:74  - A systematic literature review on integrating soft skills in the digital 
age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution: A strategy for enhancing South 
African workforce competency in higher education  
Hester Vorster  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
In a presentation at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, it was emphasized that 
workers might find their current skill sets inadequate for future demands (WEF, 2018). Klaus 
Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF, introduced the  concept of the "Fourth 
Industrial Revolution" (4IR), describing it as a fusion of the physical and digital worlds, integrating 
technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and 
robotics (Schwab, 2017). The se advancements are revolutionizing sectors including manufacturing, 
healthcare, transportation, and agriculture by enhancing automation, efficiency, and 
personalization.  
 
The WEF (2018) predicts that 'human' attributes such as creativity, critical thinking, persuasion, and 
negotiation will grow in importance alongside 'technological' skills like programming, analytical 
thinking, and continuous learning. Additionally, there will be an elevated demand for skills in 
leadership, relationship management, emotional intelligence, and social influence (WEF, 2018). Gray 
(2016) emphasizes the impact of 4IR on the skill sets required by the forthcoming generation of 
employees.  
 
This paper conducts a comprehensive Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to examine the influence 
of 4IR on the anticipated skills of future employees, specifically the human skills, and their relevance 
to the employability of graduates. This is crucial for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to reassess 
their existing curricula. The literature reveals various terms used interchangeably with soft skills, 
including critical cross -field outcomes, people skills, and interpersonal skills. These will be 
collectiv ely referred to as 'soft skills' in this paper.  
The integration of soft skills into Higher Education (HE) curricula is identified as a crucial yet 
frequently overlooked element, especially within the context of the South African job market. This 
paper highlights the critical importance of soft skills in  augmenting abilities and bolstering 
employability in South Africa. Using Constructivism, this study explores the relationship between 
soft skills and employability in the context of the 4IR in South African labor markets, emphasizing 
the necessity for tal ent management methods that promote both technical and interpersonal 
competencies.  
 
Theoretical Base  
Amineh & Asl (2015) articulate that Constructivism theory, championed by renowned thinkers such 
as Dewey, Piaget, Vygotsky, and Perkins, evolved as a response to the inadequacies of conventional 
educational methodologies.  
At its core, constructivism posits that individuals actively construct knowledge by building on their 
pre-existing understanding. This theory emphasizes the proactive role individuals undertake in 
knowledge formation and asserts that learning is a continua l, dynamic endeavor (Birenbaum, 2003; 
Woolfolk, 1993).  
 
Research Purpose  
The purpose of this research is to conduct a systematic review of literature to understand how HEIs 
can better integrate soft skills into their curricula to meet the demands of the 4IR, thus improving

336 
the employability of graduates in South Africa. This involves identifying the essential soft skills 
pivotal in the 4IR landscape and determining effective strategies for incorporating them into higher 
education.  
 
Research Question  
What soft skills are essential for students in the 4IR, and how can these be integrated into the 
accounting curriculum at Higher Education institutions (HEIs) in South Africa using Constructivism 
theory?  
 
Implications for HRD Practice  
This research has significant implications for Human Resource Development (HRD) practices. As 4IR 
continues to evolve, there is a growing need for educational systems that prioritize both technical 
skills and soft skills. Soft skills such as cross -cultural  communication, teamwork, globalization, and 
talent retention are increasingly viewed as predictors of career success (Cinque, 2016). By 
implementing the proposed strategies, educational institutions can prepare students more 
effectively for the current jo b market, thus enhancing their employability and interpersonal skills.  
 
Conclusion  
This study highlights the profound impact of the 4IR on the skill sets required by future 
professionals, emphasizing the need for an educational shift towards integrating soft skills. By 
leveraging Constructivism, HEIs can enhance curricular offerings to b etter prepare students for the 
demands of the modern workplace, equipping them with both technical skills and the soft skills 
necessary for career advancement. Ultimately, this approach not only prepares students to meet 
the challenges of the job market bu t also equips them with the competencies needed for success in 
a complex and evolving professional environment.

ID:92  - Unlocking Potential: A Study on Talent Catalysts in Crafting an 
Exceptional School Management Team for Optimal Service Delivery  
Kezell Klinck, Nancy Thutulwa  & Annemarie Pelser  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Purpose:  This study aims to provide valuable insights and guidance to School Management Team 
(SMT) members, focusing on the cultivation of their talents and capabilities. By exploring strategies 
for talent development, the goal is to empower SMTs in secondary scho ols, ultimately enhancing 
their ability to achieve successful and effective service delivery.  
Importance: This study holds paramount significance in offering essential insights and guidance to 
School Management Team (SMT) members. Its central focus on nurturing the talents and 
capabilities of SMT members through the exploration of effective talent development strategies is 
crucial. The ultimate objective is to empower SMTs within secondary schools, thereby significantly 
elevating their proficiency in achieving successful and effective service delivery. Through a 
comprehensive examination of talent c atalysts, this research seeks to contribute to the overarching 
goal of enhancing educational leadership and organizational effectiveness in secondary school 
settings.  
 
Theoretical base:  The contingency approach to management, or contingency theories, are complex 
and have broad implications (Ahmed et al. 2020).  Current research and future possibilities indicate 
that the relationship management paradigm has great promise for incorporating  the contingency 
theory into that of School Management Teams (SMT). With an emphasis on developing SMT 
members' skills and capacities, this study is committed to providing insightful analysis and helpful 
suggestions. The goal is to empower SMTs in secondar y schools by investigating talent development 
initiatives, which will ultimately increase their ability to provide successful and efficient services.  
Research purpose: The study used a qualitative research technique with an exploratory research 
design with a structured interview questionnaire to determine if SMTs had certain competences, 
knowledge, or attributes that increase their abilities and to prov ide recommendations for enhanced 
service delivery. The research enlisted the help of n = 12 participants from four different secondary 
schools to get first -hand experience of the phenomena under inquiry. Participants were specifically 
picked for their expe rtise, knowledge, and talents. Data were collected from participants via 
interviews, and the data were evaluated using content analysis. Atlas -ti (Version 8.2) was used to 
evaluate data collected from participants. The researcher used a qualitative researc h approach, 
namely a phenomenological strategy based on constructivism. With no data modification, this 
technique was adopted to understand the viewpoints of the SMT inside the selected schools.  
Main research question: What impact does talent catalysts and the development of an exceptional 
SMT have on achieving optimal service delivery in secondary schools?  
 
Implications for practi ce 
The challenges that recently appointed teachers must overcome have a substantial impact on their 
ability to advance professionally, especially in the first five years of their careers. Modern 
educational approaches, such those described by Makhananesa & Se peng (2022), highlight the 
significance of talent recognition and development in light of this era's vulnerability. For modern 
schools to succeed, systems for recognizing and developing the unique abilities of each School 
Management Team (SMT) member must be put in place. This includes projects like skill -building 
workshops, mentorship programs, and opportunities for individualized professional development.  
For SMTs to collaborate effectively and foster team cohesion, communication must be effective. 
Foste ring transparent and honest lines of communication is crucial, in line with research showing 
that teacher cooperation and SMT members' activities are positively correlated (Lu & Hallinger,

338 
2018; Benoliel, 2021). In order to maximize the team's combined skills, it is imperative that SMT 
members cultivate a collaborative culture that offers chances for cooperative problem -solving, 
knowledge exchange, and cooperative decision -making.  Ensuring comprehensive understanding of 
school legislation and regulations is imperative. Continuous updates and training sessions should 
be provided to keep SMTs informed about changes in the educational landscape. Research 
emphasizes the role of effective adminis trators in supporting efficient teaching and learning, 
contributing to school improvement (Sun & Leithwood, 2017; Benoliel, 2021).  Investing in the 
leadership potential of SMTs is vital. Training and resources should be provided to enhance skills 
such as decision -making, strategic planning, and vision -setting. Recognizing the significance of 
various individuals in leadership, not solely principals, is emphasized by scholars (Harris & Jones, 
2017; Leithwood, 2016; Malloy & Leithwood, 2017; Benoliel, 2021).  Improving the SMT's problem -
solving skills is essential. It should be possible to attend training sessions or seminars that 
emphasize creative problem -solving methods, critical thinking, and decision -making in a variety of 
situations.  It is crucial to as sist SMTs in keeping abreast of the most recent advancements in 
curriculum design and instructional techniques. Promoting the use of cutting -edge teaching 
techniques raises the standard of education as a whole.  Fostering a culture of adaptability within 
the SMT recognizes the need for flexibility in the ever -changing sector of education, enabling the 
team to welcome changes and modify tactics as needed.  It is imperative to acknowledge the 
cultural variety present in today's educational workforce, which is  shaped by factors such as 
globalization, migration patterns, and labor law modifications (Sibanda & Majola, 2023).  It is crucial 
to foster a positive and enthusiastic work environment within SMT. Acknowledging and appreciating 
successes encourages team m embers' enthusiasm and determination (Mangu'uu, 2022).  
Conclusion: The study emphasizes how crucial it is to provide specialized mentoring and training 
programs for talented School Management Teams (SMTs). Considering the broad spectrum of 
duties that SMTs perform, such as purchasing, updating infrastructure, coordinating with the 
community, and managing communications, it is critical to acknowledge the close relationship that 
exists between their positions and the delivery of accessible learning assistance in schools.  The 
study pinpoints a particular set of q ualities and traits that are essential for SMT performance, 
including emotional intelligence, management smart, interpersonal skills, effective communication, 
and team -building proficiency. It is believed that these attributes are necessary for SMTs to car ry 
out their duties and make an essential contribution to better service delivery.

ID:97  -Navigating Chaos: The Impact of Place Leadership on Volunteer Success 
in Crisis Response  
Susie Walsh  & Alan Johnston  
 
Abstract   
 
Purpose  
Covid -19 has provided a catalyst for the changing working environment, significantly considering 
the way in which leaders come to the fore and how followers are encouraged and developed. This 
paper considers the importance of Place Leadership in working wi th community environments 
during periods of turbulence and instability.  Beer et al (2019) suggest place leadership is founded 
on the social and relational connectivity between individuals and groups in a specified environment 
or place. As such it goes bey ond traditional approaches to leadership and is often dependent on the 
context of the time (Sotarauta and Beer, 2017).  Furthermore, it is rooted in a non -hierarchical, 
collaborative structure based on mutual co -operative practices (Sotarauta and Beer, 201 7). 
Lough (2021) argues that leadership developed from within communities is more effective than 
leaders trying to work with communities.  This has the benefit of both increasing engagement and 
building resilience from within.  Hamel and Välikangas (2003) iden tify the quest for resilience as an 
opportunity to yield a significant return to an organisation.  The concept of resilience has been 
explained as the ability to recover or rebound.  Other terms used include springing back, 
bouncebackability and buoyancy.  Fundamentally, it focuses on the ability to return to the original 
(natural) state. Consequently, it is an in -demand quality required for leaders and within 
organisations.  Bhamra et al (2011) suggest that resilience is about the capacity to return to a s table 
state after a period of disturbance, disruption, or adversity.  
 
Design / Methodology / Approach  
In this narrative research investigation explores the leadership dynamics of spontaneous volunteer 
activity during the Covid -19 pandemic. The research followed a case study approach based on a 
single group of spontaneous volunteers drawn together in a response to a crisis.  Data was  
collected through qualitative means to draw on individual’s interpretations of events and 
circumstances.  Through the use of semi -structured interviews, the participants shared their 
experiences and stories, and it is these narratives that are explored to  consider leadership within 
this community group of volunteers.  
 
Findings  
Significantly, empirical evidence confirms the effectiveness of leadership in achieving successful 
outcomes for the group members, the leader, and the wider community. This effectiveness is 
attributed to factors such as knowledge and understanding of the community, effective leadership 
skills, authentic behaviours, and an adaptable leadership style. It is important to note that, despite 
these contributing factors, no one styl e of leadership has been identified in this study.  
The research has found that spontaneous volunteering, in emerging groups, can be inspired, and 
positively influenced, by a transformative, authentic albeit informal leader (Walsh and Johnston, 
2022).  The findings suggest that when a leader nurtures a 'com munity culture,' demonstrating 
authenticity and shared values with group members, it proves to be a highly effective leadership 
approach within the scope of this research. Consequently, the research advocates for the 
consideration of community culture as a  best practice approach in leading spontaneous volunteers 
in response to crisis events.

Originality / Contribution  
This paper provides valuable insight for both the Human Resource Development (HRD) and the 
Human Resource Management (HRM) practitioner, especially in the context of managing and 
motivating employees within an organisation. While it is recognised that volu nteers may not be 
employees in the traditional sense, understanding the factors that drive their motivation can 
provide valuable insights applicable to the broader field of HRD/HRM and contributes to an 
understanding of the conditions necessary to create m otivated, satisfied and high -performing 
individuals and teams.  
 
Whilst crisis situations produce unique and non -replicable circumstances, this paper contributes to 
the growing body of empirical research that seeks to learn lessons from such situations and 
consider the role of leadership in contributing to an effective response to crisis.  The paper also 
contributes to research considering Third Sector leadership and the need for an understanding of 
how leading spontaneous volunteers can produce effective outcomes for their community, during 
crises and disaster response.    
 
The findings of this research provide valuable insight into the dynamics of spontaneous 
volunteering and the leadership activity that ultimately produced numerous successful outcomes 
including resilience and resilient behaviours amongst the group.

ID:98  - A Well -being Culture Influencing the Retention of Talent Generation Y 
Case Study of Top50 Companies in Thailand 2023  
Nishima  Rensep  & Juthamas Kaewpijit  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The Study of Well -being Culture Influencing the Retention of Talent Generation Y Case Study of 
Top50 Companies in Thailand 2023 has two objectives: (1) to study well -being factors to retain talent 
Generation Y in organization; and (2) to study retention fa ctors to retain talent Generation Y in 
organization. This research was conducted using a qualitative approach by utilizing semi - structured 
interviews and analyzing data through the content analysis method with 31 participants of 
Generation Y from five dif ferent business sectors including (1) Food and Beverages; (2) Food 
Production; (3) Construction Materials; (4) Commerce and Real Estate; and (5) Energy and Utilities.  
The results indicated that 13 factors influence Well -being contributing to the retention of 
Generation Y talent in the organization , respectively as follows: (1) Healthy Relationships at Work; 
(2) Health and Flexible Benefits; (3) Pay; (4) Work -Life Harmo ny; (5) Strategic Leadership; (6) 
Autonomy; (7) Work Environment; (8) Facilities; (9) Challenging Work; (10) Opportunity for Growth; 
(11) Work Process; (12) Mattering at Work; and (13) Work Location. Findings reveal that the top 
three factors are: Healthy Relationships at Work (17.32%), Health and Flexible Benefits (16.54%), and 
Pay (10.24%) of the total elements that affect Well -being, comprising 44.10% of all factors. In 
addition, there are 11 factors that influence the retention of talented Generation Y in Organization, 
respectively as follows: (1) Healthy Relationships at Work; (2) Opportunity for Growth; (3) Work -Life 
Harmony; (4) Benefits; (5) Mattering at Work; (6) Learning Opportunity; (7) Pay; (8) Strategic 
Leadership; (9) Corporate Image; (10) Work  Location; and (11) Company Culture. Findings reveal 
that the top three factors are: Healthy Relationships at Work (18.99%); Opportunity for Growth 
(12.66%), and Work -Life Harmony (12.66%) of the total elements that affect Retention, comprising 
44.31% of a ll factors. It can be concluded from the study results of the two variables that Talent 
Generation Y is most dependent on Healthy Relationships at Work.  
 
The Study will help organizations understand the factors that contribute to employee retention and 
well-being in the Thai business environment, where Generation Y is playing a significant role in 
replacing Baby Boomer retirement and Generation X in the wor kforce. These factors will help the 
organization develop a competitive edge and set goals for the future. In order to enable talent 
generation Y to remain with the organization, it is necessary to build a solution for managing a well -
being culture that inf luences talent retention. Due to the time periods or variations across the years, 
the study's conclusions might not fully capture the context or circumstances surrounding labor and 
organizations that existed during that time. Nevertheless, when using resea rch findings, one should 
take the importance of the business context into account. Furthermore, research on the connection 
between Generation Y and other Generations in organization is essential for a comprehensive 
understanding. Also, design appropriate g uidelines for fostering harmonious coexistence among 
individuals in the organization from a holistic perspective.

ID:108  - Youth Perspectives on entrepreneurship, management and talent 
development in Dr Kenneth Kaunda: Unveiling insights from North -West 
Province, South Africa  
Faan Pelser, Anna -Marie Pelser  & Kedron Peter  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
 
This study explores the perceptions of the youth regarding entrepreneurship in South Africa's North 
West Province specifically, the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District. In an area with distinct socio -economic 
dynamics and obstacles, it is critical to comprehend how the youth see entrepreneurship and its 
potential as a career route. This study aimed to determine the elements that influence young 
people's views on entrepreneurship, as well as the obstacles they face and the potential role that 
they can play in effecting social c hange through entrepreneurship.  
Theoretical base: For this study, a qualitative research design with interpretivism as its basis was 
utilised. A purposive sampling technique was applied for the selection of a maximum of twenty 
young adults to participate in focus group interviews to asce rtain the perceptions of 
entrepreneurship among the youth in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District. Around 47% of North West 
(NW) population is considered poor based on the Lower Bound Poverty Line (Selemela, 2020).  
The study explores what motivates young people to pursue entrepreneurship, the obstacles they 
encounter, and how education and societal influences affect their perceptions. This review aims to 
get a comprehensive understanding of how young people view entr epreneurship and its 
implications for future research and interventions.  
 
The conceptual development of entrepreneurship may be established through further explorations 
of the existing theoretical perspectives on entrepreneurship within the different schools of thought 
(i.e., economics, psychology, and sociology). The innovation  theory (also known as the 
Schumpeterian theory) as part of the economic theories of entrepreneurship advanced the 
conceptualisation of entrepreneurship to include innovation and creativity as critical elements to 
entrepreneurship. Schumpeter argued that i n order to create new markets and disrupt current 
ones, new ideas, goods, or technology must be introduced. This process is referred to as 
entrepreneurship (Pfarrer & Smith, 2015).  
 
According to Schumpeter, the entrepreneur, as a result of his/her innovative and creative ideas, is 
the primary catalyst to mobilise and effect economic development by introducing new 
technologically advanced processes and products with the intent to trans form, create new and 
develop more efficient business processes. Schumpeter postulated that only the extraordinary 
innovative capabilities of the entrepreneur can present new possibilities that not only challenge but 
also change traditional economic and soc ial development. Schumpter’s cognitive analysis of 
entrepreneurship further assumes the entrepreneur is responsible for innovation by performing 
the activities reflected in the below diagram (Mwatsika, Kambewa & Chiwaula, 2018).  
The importance of entrepreneurship according to the Department for International Development 
the process of economic growth in any nation places a high priority on entrepreneurship. While 
industrialised nations recognise and optimise through the value of e ntrepreneurship, developing 
nations tend to lag behind in leveraging the benefits of entrepreneurship as a crucial component to 
maintaining consistent growth (Audretsch & Keilbach, 2007). The following points assist in 
formulating an understanding of the s ignificance of entrepreneurship.

343 
Self-employment is enabled through entrepreneurship. Robinson and Taubinsky (2018) contend 
that resourceful individuals can utilise their physical and cognitive skills to ensure their own 
financial stability and well -being..  
Job creation is established when new businesses create employment opportunities. This directly 
addresses the unemployment socio -economic crisis and related effects according to Fritsch and 
Wyrwich (2017). Entrepreneurship actively and positively contribute s towards the reduction of crime 
by providing gainful employment opportunities as an alternative to participating in illegal activities.  
Research purpose: The purpose of this study is to understand how youth perceive 
entrepreneurship as a vehicle for future employment and alleviate socioeconomic challenges for 
their own context, and whether differences exist in the perceptions of youth from  townships and 
those from a suburb.  
 
The study by nature used a phenomenological strategy followed from the constructivist paradigm. 
The study therefore asked youth about their perceptions of entrepreneurship as part of their lived 
experience and how they could develop sustainable livelihoods  out of these ideas.  
The fundamental assumption is that by situating individuals in their social environments, it is 
possible to better understand how they view their own behaviour and actions. Frechette, Bitzas, 
Aubry, Kilpatrick, and Lavoie -Tremblay (2020) assert that interp retive phenomenology offers a 
special approach for examining lived experiences. The basic idea of interpretive phenomenology of 
Dasein is that “lived experience, existentialia, and authenticity” are at the core of the consideration 
of such a paradigmatic a pproach within a qualitative research approach (Frechette, et al., 2020). In 
terms of this study, it was expected that the views of youth about entrepreneurship would 
contextually reveal what entrepreneurship means to them, and how it could be made sustain able in 
their context.  
 
Research question/s:  
 What do the youth from the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District understand about entrepreneurship and 
the role they are playing in contributing to the economy?  
 What are the perceptions of the youth in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District regarding 
entrepreneurship?  
 
Implications in practice  
The implications of this study on the practice of understanding youth perceptions of 
entrepreneurship in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District are multifaceted. Firstly, the findings offer a 
critical insight into the factors shaping young people's views on entrep reneurship, unveiling 
motivators and obstacles that influence their decisions regarding this career path. Understanding 
these perspectives is pivotal for policymakers, educators, and community leaders as it enables 
tailored interventions and educational in itiatives that resonate with the youth's aspirations and 
challenges. By acknowledging and addressing these factors, stakeholders can collaboratively work 
towards fostering an entrepreneurial culture that aligns with the local socio -economic landscape. 
This highlights the necessity for nuanced approaches and targeted support mechanisms, 
considering the varying contexts within the district. Overall, this research underscores the 
significance of contextually informed strategies to empower youth in embracing en trepreneurship, 
ultimately contributing to economic development and social change within the region.  
 
Conclusion s 
Based on the findings, the following recommendations were made to encourage youth 
entrepreneurship: (1) research databases need to be created to provide a central network that can 
assist in providing information and guidance on entrepreneurship, (2) educat ion and training 
interventions that will provide the necessary entrepreneurial knowledge and skills development 
opportunities to capacitate the youth towards entrepreneurial choices, (3) creating awareness of 
entrepreneurship in an effort to transform cult ural and social norms associated with negative

344 
perceptions of entrepreneurship, (4) cultivating critical and productive partnerships that will 
financially support the entrepreneurship of the youth, (5) government initiatives that cultivate a 
supportive ecosystem for youth entrepreneurship, and (6) agil e programmes that support 
entrepreneurship.

ID:147  - Innovating Talent Management Practices for sustained employment 
in UK Public Sector organisations  
Oghale Ayetuoma  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Since the renowned publication of ‘the war for talent’ (Michaels et al., 2001) premised on talent 
shortages in the labour market, Talent Management ™ has occupied centre stage discourse for 
organisations with current reports (Bunker, 2022) showing that 3 in 4 employers are still challenged 
with attracting and retaining talent. Tasked with this challenge, in addition to an aging workforce 
particularly i n the western hemisphere (Rudolph & Zacher, 2021) which is affecting older workers on 
the micro, meso and m acro levels as research shows that a third of the working population 
particularly in public sector organisations are over 50 and approaching retirement age and this 
paralleled with a declining proportion of younger workers(Bal et al., 2015; Farndale et al. , 2019: 
United Nations, 2017) further impacting the demand for talent, the need for sustainable 
employment has become paramount for firms to manage these uncertainties and maintain their 
competitive advantage. The result is a rising paradigm shift from pre vious stereotyping of older 
workers as easily replaceable by younger workers to innovating talent and business practices 
(Boehm et al., 2021) that attract and retain older workers to remain beyond traditional retirement, 
offering bridge jobs that allow tra nsition into other kinds of work. Arguably, since an organisation’s 
human capital is its most important asset for maximising achievement of long -term goals (Barney, 
1991; Becker & Huselid, 2006; Becker & Gerhart,1996), retaining its talent for the long ter m through 
sustained employment would continue yielding results on investments for its continuous high 
performance (Huselid & Becker, 2011). This perception is further supported by consensus within the 
literature that older talented workers positively impac t the bottom -line as they are less likely than 
younger talents to leave their jobs unexpectedly and are highly valued for the knowledge and 
expertise, experience, professionalism that they bring to their roles (Festing and Schafer, 2014). This 
study is dri ven not only by calls to advance understanding of what constitutes a sustainable career 
(De Vos et al., 2020), its core dimensions and dynamics through empirical studies as there is a 
dearth of research in this area but also the need for more research and awareness on TM practices 
within public sector organisations as there is still scarcity in this area. In response to these gaps and 
using sustainable career lens as a theoretical framework for analysing findings, this paper explores 
how three UK public sec tor organisations innovate their TM programs for sustained employment of 
their talented workforce particularly the older workforce amongst others by asking the following  
 
Research Questions  
• How do organisations innovate talent programs for sustainable employment at the meso, 
micro and macro levels  
• How do organisations drive implementation of talent programs for successful outcomes 
resulting in sustainable employment of their talents  
 
Theoretical Framework  
Sustainable careers have been linked to Human Resource policies and defined as “sequences of 
career experiences reflected through a variety of patterns of continuity over time thereby crossing 
several social spaces characterized by individual agency provid ing meaning to the individual (Van 
der Heijden and De Vos, 2015, p.7). There are three dimensions important for analysis of 
sustainable careers which comprise ‘person’, ‘context’ and ‘time’. The person dimension examines 
the individual characteristics e.g.  perceptions and agency including choices they make that affect 
their work experience. The ‘context’ dimension refers to institutional factors such as the 
organisation and sector where work is situated and the impact on the individual’s experiences

346 
whilst the ‘time’ dimension is about the changes in the individual's work overtime and impact on 
their work experiences. For the measurements of these dimensions and their outcomes, the 
authors advocate three indicators which are happiness, health, and pro ductivity as these were seen 
as important factors for an individual’s all -round prosperity. Whilst Happiness indicator 
encompasses the fit between one’s career and their career goals/growth, the health indicator refers 
to the physical -mental capacity fit o f the individual to their career and productivity indicator means 
performance, high employability and /or potential. These frameworks will be used for discussing the 
findings from the perspectives of both the organisation and their different talents to und erstand 
the success or failure of talent programs for sustainable careers of these talents.  
 
Research Method  
The research adopts a qualitative research method comprising a case study of three public sector 
organisations in the local government, civil service and the other in healthcare using both semi -
structured interviews and organisation documents for data coll ection purposes. The data were 
transcribed and analysed manually, using within and cross -case study analysis methods (Eisenhardt, 
1989).  
 
Some preliminary Findings:  
For all three organisations, talent programs were mainly targeted at attracting employees in the 
higher job grade bands -band 7 -8 who held managerial roles and who had worked in the 
organisation for over 10 -15 years. One of the interviewees had worked wi th the civil service for over 
30 years and it was in his 30th year he was enrolled on the talent program, showing a very high 
happiness indicator and sustained career a result.  
The interesting finding was that each organization diversified their talent programs in recognition of 
sustainability goals such as reducing inequalities in the workplace which address micro, meso and 
macro needs as explained below:  
For example, the Local Government organisation talent program though exclusive to employees in 
very senior roles particularly appealed for applicants from under -represented groups and those 
with disability and intentionally sought for applicants through ro adshows with social networks run 
by these groups.  
 
Local government also initiated a program solely for upcoming retirees to allow them to continue 
working for the organisation to retain tacit talent that can be transferred to younger talents and in 
recognition of their valued expertise. These are indicato rs of happiness for these talents and 
productivity for their sustainable careers.  
One of the talent programs in the healthcare sector was specifically designed for leadership 
development of employees who were underemployed due to restricting immigration rules which 
limited their ability to apply and access work in senior roles that they qualify and so these talents 
could be retained to meet demands in their talent pool.  
All three organisations designed talent programs specifically to attract talents from younger 
generation which were successfully running.  
 
Originality & Implications  
Research shows that Talent attraction and Talent Management ranks as top five priorities for firms 
presently and for years to come and employers of talents must consider innovating practices that 
address sustainability goals and sustainable careers in orde r to survive the war for talent whilst 
creating the right organisation culture and environment to retain top talent.

ID:153  - A Stitch in Time Saves Nine: Developmental Human Resource 
Management Practices and Front -Line Employees' Career Success in the 
Perspective of Career Networking  
Thomas  Garavan , Waheed Akhtar  & Irfan Ullah  
 
Abstract  
 
Based on the conservation of resource theory, this study investigates the effects of developmental 
human resource management practices (DHRMPs) on employee career success directly and also via 
status striving. The study also examines the moderating role of  career networking in the association 
between DHRMPs and career success. Data were collected from front -line employees (n=217) in 
Pakistan's hospitality sector using a multi -wave research approach. For multi -level estimation, we 
used Hierarchical Linear Mo delling (HLM) (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992). The results suggest that 
DHRMPs impact career success directly and also via status striving. Furthermore, career networking 
moderates the relationship between DHRMPs and career success. This study contributes to the  
existing knowledge on DHRMPs in the hospitality sector by proposing status striving as a 
mechanism through which DHRMPs influence employee career success. Moreover, our research 
provides unique insights by suggesting that employees' status striving may va ry depending on their 
career networking when confronted with DHRMPs.

ID:167  - Veteran Experts: Transitioning Military Expertise into Civilian Work  
Sarah Minnis  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Even with ongoing military activity, civilians are unfamiliar with military members’ work and 
acquired skills. Human resource development (HRD) scholars have been engaged in understanding 
and explaining veterans’ skills transition into civilian work. Veterans’ successful movement in to 
civilian work is one of the transition outcome indicators of Kintzle and Castro’s Military Transition 
Theory. Grenier and Kehrhan defined expertise and developed the Model of Expertise 
Redevelopment as applied to the broad employment community. Minnis a nd Kirchner’s previous 
work showed how Grenier and Kehrhan’s Model of Expertise Redevelopment could provide a new 
way to understand veterans’ expertise redevelopment into civilian work as the Model of Expertise 
Redevelopment for Veterans. The purpose of th is conceptual work is to build on this previous work 
considering veterans’ transition as it takes place in the liminal space of unbecoming military service 
members and becoming civilian employees while engaged in the sensemaking of moving from one 
cultural  world to another, seeking a new identity in civilian life. Understanding their new identity 
and integrating into civilian work can create emotional disruption for veterans necessitating their 
engagement in sensemaking and reculturation. The Model of Exper tise Redevelopment for Veterans 
should serve as a valuable way for HRD researchers and HRD practitioners to represent and 
articulate the unique experience of military veterans’ expertise redevelopment into civilian work.

ID:174  - Leadership Humility Double Bind and its effects on Women  
Omaima Hajjami, Bhagyashree Barhate  & Sami El Ahmadie  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Importance  
Leadership humility is defined as an interpersonal characteristic that connotes an accurate self -
view, appreciation for others, and openness to feedback (Owens et al., 2013). Recent research has 
shown that humility is a key component of effective leadershi p. However, how followers perceive 
humility is influenced by the leader's gender (Krings et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2018). For instance, 
male leaders are appreciated and receive more followership while female leaders receive backlash 
and lose followership (Priebe & Van Tongeren, 2023). Moreover, humble female leaders are rated 
lower in their leadership competence (Chiu et al., 2020). As a result, women leaders are impeded 
from practicing authentic leadership by being in a double bind, or humility double bin d.  
 
While this issue significantly affects women leader’s performance evaluation, career advancement, 
and leadership development, human resource development has not yet addressed it in research 
and practice. This paper contributes to the body of literature by critically reviewing existing 
literature and addressing challenges faced by female leaders in relation to humility by situating it in 
the context of HRD.  
 
Theoretical base  
 Society's assumptions about gender roles shape leadership perceptions, favoring masculine 
traits over feminine traits. Women often face challenges of these gender expectations in leadership, 
and deviating from traditional feminine norms can trigger negati ve reactions due to the perceived 
role incongruity. To untangle the relationship between leadership humility and women leadership, 
we use the theories of social identity and role incongruity. Social identity theory refers to “attributes 
that reflect group membership” (Ashforth et al., 2016, p.31). For example, women are expected to 
display communal behaviors such as humility, collaboration, care, and emotional expressivity more 
than men. When women’s identity interacts with leadership, their behaviors are b ound to the 
perception of role incongruity defined as a “mismatch between beliefs about the attributes typically 
possessed by members of a social group (that is, their stereotype) and beliefs about the attributes 
that facilitate success in valued social ro les” (Eagly & Diekman, 2008, p. 19). Theoretical framework 
will help us further explore how leadership humility double bind manifests and affects women 
leadership.  
 
Research purpose  
Using an integrative literature review, we explore the relationship between humility double bind 
and women's leadership through social identity and role incongruity theories.  
 
Research question  
How does humility double bind manifest in women’s leadership?  
 
Implications to HRD  
This study emphasizes the importance to question and reassess gender stereotypes and 
conventional leadership norms. We posit that HRD plays a pivotal role in addressing the challenge 
of the humility double bind and fostering an inclusive setting for feminine traits in leadership roles. 
Through this study, we will offer insights that can inform leadership development programs and 
encourag e them to consider the nuanced impact of the humility double bind on women's 
leadership experiences.

ID:175  - Leadership styles to face grand challenges: an overview of phronetic 
and transformational leadership  
Robson Campos Leite, Américo da Costa Ramos Filho  & Victor Couto Alves  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
We live in a time of profound and intense change combined with an enormous production and 
availability of information and data. According to SGB (Social Good Brazil), the volume of data 
created between 2014 and 2016 alone was greater than the amount produc ed throughout the 
entire history of humanity. Google alone, according to the Google.com portal itself, performs 3.5 
billion searches per day. If a single person were to watch all the videos that YouTube serves in 24 
hours, it would take no less than 2,739, 726 years to accomplish this task, according to YouTube's 
own official upload data. Added to this, there is an unprecedented technological advance, such as 
big data, the creation of ChatGPT and the evolution of generative artificial intelligence, the growi ng 
concern with the acronym ESG and the energy transition, essential in risk analysis and investment 
decisions, putting strong pressure on the business sector. And all this, in a context surrounded by 
the risks of false information and disinformation.    
 
Although they are not entirely new topics, all these issues that impact society today have a common 
challenge: dealing with the volume and complexity of information and knowledge. It is an epistemic 
challenge, as it is about epistemic processes: how knowle dge and information are created or 
acquired, distributed, shared, and evaluated by individuals, communities, and organizations. This, in 
turn, fuels collective decision -making and coordinated action. For Seger et al. (2020), a collective and 
individual eff ort is necessary to develop practices that ensure epistemic security and the 
development of organizations and, consequently, of society.  
 
Of course, not all this is knowledge -driven, but will seeking knowledge in this sea of data and 
information be simple or complex? What about the management of this information? And do the 
increasingly large and intense changes in the scenario in this envir onment have a great or little 
impact on organizational strategic plans? And how to manage the teams to meet the objectives and 
goals contained in these plans within this scenario of intense and increasingly frequent changes? 
Nonaka and Takeuchi (2021) argu e we need a new type of leaders, what they call “wise leaders”, to 
cope with this new world of major transformations, to allow strategy to become more future -
oriented, society -focused, dynamic, and human -centric.  
 
For Nonaka and Takeuchi (2019; 2021), wise leaders are people endowed with phronesis, often 
forgotten type of knowledge that Aristotle talked about 2400 years or so ago. It is interpreted as 
experiential knowledge that enables us to make prudent judgments in a timely fashion, and to take 
actions guided by values, principles, and morals, better known as practical wisdom among 
practitioners.  It is essential to synthesize this growing complexity of today's social and economic 
forces. Phronesis is the primaril y responsible for the practice of knowledge, not just creation, so 
they consider it to be the driving force of knowledge flow at the personal, organizational, and 
societal levels. They would act as agents of change, making judgments understanding that 
ever ything is contextual and making decisions considering the changing nature of business and 
combining micromanagement with the aspirations of the future. These wise leaders can resist the 
short -term culture and understand how their companies can operate sust ainably.    
 
For this reason, research on management wisdom has been gaining increasing interest and 
attention. However, this discussion of wisdom has still been neglected or superficially addressed in 
the literature on knowledge management (Jakubik; Muursepp, 2022). T herefore, the development of

353 
practical wisdom has also been the subject of recent studies, especially in its application in 
management practices (Peltonen, 2022; Mahdavi et al, 2020; Bachmann et al, 2018; Scalzo; Fariñas, 
2018; Thomas, 2017). However, as observed by Rocha, Kragulj and  Pinheiro (2020), there are still 
open questions, for example, how leaders and team members seek, absorb, and develop phronesis, 
and its particularities in these processes.  
 
Grint (2007) reinforces, as stated by Aristotle, that this type of wisdom is not a set of universal rules 
easily learned and reproduced but must be achieved through experience and reflection. Even so, 
the author adds, experience alone is not enough, especi ally because phronesis is related to 
apperception , which consists of the ability to relate new experiences to previous experiences, and 
to develop it, some level of reflective learning is required. Therefore, the author concludes that the 
development of l eaders needs to be rethought, considering knowledge, skills, and wisdom, not 
necessarily together, but providing frameworks that can obtain them effectively.  
 In trying to answer these questions, this paper presents some clues and paths on how to lead, 
involving and engaging teams within the organizational environment, so that organizational goals 
can be achieved and even exceeded, even with the intense changes  in scenarios that the current 
world imposes on us. In this sense, the work in question has the objective to investigate through a 
literature review, this new type of wise leadership, which exercises practical wisdom, based on 
Nonaka and Takeuchi work and,  consequently, is responsible (Eriksen; Cooper, 2018) as well as 
presents an approach using the application of James MacGregor Burns' Transformational 
Leadership techniques combined with Carlos Matus' Situational Strategic Planning and Richard 
Whittington' s abstractions of Strategy as Practice, also including George Kohlrieser's conceptions 
present in his work called "Hostage at the Negotiation Table" and the definitions presented in 
Daniel Goleman's studies on Emotional Intelligence,  in addition to the Fr amework proposed by 
Robson Campos Leite in the work entitled "Strategy and Leadership in times of profound changes: 
the path to success in a public organization".  
 
Finally, the work aims to contribute to shed some light to the relationship of these different 
leadership development approaches with objective to nurture practical wisdom in individuals in the 
organizational context and consequently supports innovation, s hared value creation, humanized 
strategies, organizational purpose, adaptation to change, meaningful workplace, and work 
attitudes, such as ethical decision -making,  the creation and sharing of knowledge, the development 
of shared spaces, the well -being of  the worker, curiosity and creativity, involvement, commitment 
and satisfaction at work, thus preparing for the grand challenges we face today.

ID:194  - The work and non -work effects of abusive supervision  
Muhammad Farrukh Moin  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Drawing on conservation of resources theory, we examined the link between abusive supervision 
and work -family conflict. In addition, we examined the mediating role of subordinate’s burnout and 
a moderating role of organizational justice in this process. We collected time -lagged data from the 
service industry. We found that abusi ve supervision induces work -family conflict. In addition, we 
found that the relationship between abusive supervision and work -family conflict is mediated by 
subordinate’s burnout whereas organizational justice moderates this relationship such that the 
medi ated relationship was stronger when lower levels of organizational justice were present. We 
discussed the implication for theory and research and future directions.

ID:201  - Flourishing without Burning Out:  An Exploration of Factors that 
Contribute to Sustainable Careers  
Nisha Manikoth  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Longer lives and aspirations for well -being in leading such lives are leading more people to pursue 
personal learning, development and growth both inside and outside of work (Arthur, 2014; Hall, 
2004; McDonald & Hite, 2018; Sullivan & Baruch, 2009). An acc umulation of these experiences over 
time is creating a mosaic of their careers. This brings to the forefront the notion of a sustainable 
career —one that continues to grow, adapt, and flourish rather than a burst of productivity only to 
fizzle out due to bu rnout. Benefits of a sustainable career go beyond achieving productivity to 
helping individuals realize their full potential (Lawrence et al., 2015) and offering improved health 
and happiness (Van der Heijden et al., 2020). Sustainable careers offer benefi ts for individuals and 
for their surrounding context (De Vos et al., 2020).  
 
Van der Heijden and De Vos (2015) note that sustainable careers are a composite of work 
experiences intersecting with multiple life domains of work, social, and family across one's lifespan. 
They provide a definition of sustainable careers as “sequences of  career experiences reflected 
through a variety of patterns of continuity over time, thereby crossing several social spaces, 
characterized by individual agency, herewith providing meaning to the individual” (p. 7). Sustainable 
careers include two component s: employability and workability (Lawrence et al., 2015). 
Employability is the extent to which workers have the opportunity for short -term and long -term 
employment (Forrier and Sels, 2003) and workability is the extent to which job requirements are 
reasona ble so as not to result in burnout (De Vos & Gielens, 2014, as cited in Lawrence et al., 2015). 
Sustainable careers can be developed through a dynamic process of preservation and generation 
within a supportive environment that includes a constellation of p ersonal, workgroup, 
organizational, institutional, occupational, and national factors (De Vos et al., 2020). There is a 
dynamic interplay between an individual’s proactive behaviors for growth and development and 
support from organizational, occupational a nd societal contexts.  Research on sustainable careers 
that accounts for experiences gathered over time across multiple work and social contexts is still at 
a nascent stage. Career research has focused mostly at the individual level or the organizational 
level. Although the individual, organizational, and societal benefits from careers that cross 
organizational and geographical boundaries have been asserted by researchers (Khapova & Arthur, 
2011), there is a gap in the literature of exemplars personal exper iences building sustainable 
careers examining factors leading to sustainability is still sparse.  
 
The purpose of this qualitative research study is to explore how individuals who self -report that 
they are building sustainable careers describe their actions and decisions in the crafting of their 
careers, as well as the role of employers, and support sys tems from occupational and societal 
contexts in supporting such careers.  
 
Theoretical framework  
 
Sustainable careers include two components: employability and workability (De Vos & De Prins, 
2014; De Vos & Gielens, 2014 as cited in Lawrence et al., 2015). Employability is the extent to which 
workers have the opportunity for short -term and long -term em ployment (Forrier and Sels, 2003) 
and workability is the extent to which job requirements are reasonable so as not to result in 
burnout (De Vos & Gielens, 2014 as cited in Lawrence et al., 2015). Sustainable careers can be 
developed through a dynamic proce ss of preservation and generation with proactive behaviors for

356 
growth and development within a supportive environment that includes a constellation of personal, 
workgroup, organizational, institutional, occupational, and national factors (De Vos et al., 2020).  
Although the literature on sustainable careers is in its early stage of development (De Vos et al., 
2018), it is an evolution of career theory. Contemporary careers of individuals within, outside, and 
across organizations and occupations as well an emergin g focus that includes the responsibilities 
that organizations and society has in the ideology of self -actualized careers that “allow individuals to 
realize their full potential, and access to the social contexts which facilitate that realization” 
(Lawrence  et al., 2015, p. 433) provide a foundation for the development of theories on sustainable 
careers. Van der Heijden et al. (2020) clarify that the sustainable career complements rather than 
replaces existing career paradigms, such as protean (Hall, 2002), boundaryless (Arthur & Rousseau, 
1996), and customized careers (Valcour, Bailyn, & Quijada, 2007)” (pp. 1 -2).  
 
Research Design  
This is an exploratory qualitative study based on a social constructivist worldview (Creswell & 
Creswell, 2022). Participants for this study will be individuals who self -identify as having built 
sustainable careers in spite of challenges such as high stres s jobs or disruptions in personal, 
organizational, or occupational environments that had an impact on their employment. In -depth 
interviews will be conducted with eight to ten individuals to explore how they describe actions and 
decisions they took in craf ting of their careers, as well as how employers and support systems from 
occupational and societal contexts may have supported them in building sustainable careers.  
Taking a reflexive pragmatic approach (Alvesson, 2003) interviews will involve questions that 
“stimulate an interplay between producing interpretations and challenging them” (p. 16). Following 
the reflexive interview, narratives from participants (Franzosi , 1998) will be carefully interpreted 
through narrative analysis (Polkinghorne, 1995; Riessman, 2008) to understand participant 
experiences and interpretations on the topic within their life and work contexts (de Janasz et al., 
2003; Ferraro, 2021).  
 
Implications for Human Resource Development  
With careers evolving beyond boundaries of a single organization, or even a single occupation, a 
broader, societal vision for supporting sustainable careers is essential. By understanding factors 
that support sustainable careers, this study will offer insi ghts for human resource development 
professionals for developing effective policies and practices. It will also highlight how professional 
associations and local communities can contribute to building sustainable careers. Finally, it will 
contribute to NHR D (McLean, 2004) by considering beneficial strategies at local, state, and national 
levels.

ID:202  - The Longitudinal Relationship between Female Managers' Leadership 
Competencies and Career Development Activities Using Autoregressive Cross -
Lagged Modeling  
Jiyoung Kim  & Yoonhee Park  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The purpose of this study was to examine the longitudinal relationship between female managers’ 
leadership competencies and career development activities by using the autoregressive cross -
lagged (ARCL) modeling. For this purpose, the 5th, 6th, and 7th waves of Korean Women Managers 
Panel (KWMP) were used, and a total of 1,022 female managers’ data were analyzed. The final 
optimal model was selected by testing measurement invariance, path invariance, and error 
covariance invariance and conducted ARCL analysis. The results were as follows. First, the 
autoregressive effects of female manager’s leadership competencies and career development 
activities were significant. Leadership competencies and career development activities were found 
to be stable over time. Second, the cross -lagged effect of leadership competencies and career 
development activities was significant. In other words, it was found that previous leadership 
competencies had an effect on subsequent career development activities, and career development 
activities also had an effect on subsequent  leadership competencies by time -lagged period. 
Consequently, this study contributed to confirming the reciprocal relationship between leadership 
competencies and career development activities. Based on the results of this study, academic and 
practical imp lications were presented, and follow -up research was suggested.

ID:227  - The Times Are Changing: COVID -19 Impact on Effective Virtual 
Leadership Practices  
Yadira Guerrero, Jackie Robinson Brock  & Stacy Wilson  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Virtual teams have existed for many years. However, the pandemic led to the emergence of virtual 
teams composed of team members and leaders that entered new working practices with no 
established shared communication and social relationship building norms f or a virtual work 
environment (Lal et al., 2021). The enforced and accelerated nature of this virtual team formation 
led to newly transitioned virtual leaders needing specific skills to manage this adaptive challenge.  
Our comparative research question is how did the COVID -19 pandemic impact virtual leadership 
practices? A systematic literature review identified the most current and relevant research available 
on the dynamics of virtual leadership practices and examined practices required for effective virt ual 
leadership in post -pandemic work environments.  
 
The research team proposes the conceptual framework, LEAD, which synthesizes the research and 
promising practices to enhance virtual leadership competencies. The conceptual framework aligns 
the virtual leadership competencies with the key themes of pandemi c informed effective virtual 
leadership practices, which include 1) Leverage technology, 2) Establish virtual presence, 3) Amplify 
employee engagement, and 4) Develop trust virtually. Our research is significant because virtual 
leadership is here to stay. Organizations will continue to offer virtual work options to remain 
competitive. This framework can be used both at an organizational level and by individual leaders. 
At the organizational level, the LEAD framework should be used to inform the development of 
virtual leadership training programs for current and future leaders. At the individual level, leaders 
can use this framework to assess their practices and make adjustments to more effectively lead 
virtual teams.

Transparency in Healthcare  
Solange Charas, Ph.D, Heather Whiteman, Ph.D.  & James Gaskin, Ph.D.  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Despite long histories, the disciplines of healthcare performance analytics and human capital 
analytics followed parallel but separate tracks during the 19th and 20th centuries. Little has been 
done to integrate these two analytic disciplines to improve th e delivery of medical care and the 
sustainability of healthcare organizations. Today, there is an increased demand for healthcare to 
meet the aging world population, spiraling healthcare costs, and a shortage of human resources to 
meet patient needs. It is  imperative that healthcare professionals apply innovations to explore and 
optimize value from a combined discipline of healthcare human capital measurement and 
reporting.

ID:1 – In-Person and Remote Employees and Information Security Policy 
Compliance  
 
Joyce Y. Mui, Barbara A. W. Eversole &  Cindy L. Crowder  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Many workers have changed their working status from in -person to remote, in the past several 
years, with a large increase in the number of employees working remotely during and after the 
COVID -19 pandemic. In parallel, the increasing costs of data breaches  and number of security 
incidents continue to be a concern to organizations seeking to protect their organization, systems, 
and data. This study’s research questions were formed using a theoretical framework of the Theory 
of Planned Behavior (TPB) to disco ver influences on employee behavior and the Social Bonds 
Theory (SBT) to address strength of relationships and impact to compliance. This study investigated 
in-person and remote employees and their lived experiences with information security policies (ISP) , 
seeking to gain understanding of employee lived experiences, relationships within organizations, 
and ISP compliance.  
 
This qualitative study used the phenomenology research method to interview study participants, 
that worked in -person and remotely, to gather data. Lived experiences of both in -person and 
remote study participants covered their experiences such as with thei r organization’s 
implementation and enforcement of ISP, organizational culture and leadership attitudes shaping 
ISP compliance, and clarity and training of ISP for employee audiences. Top factors that influenced 
employee compliance of ISPs of both in -perso n and remote study participants included the 
automation, hectic/busy times, efficiency, availability, training, and enforcement of the ISPs. Overall, 
study participants reported positive relationships within their organization, regardless of whether 
they w ere in -person or remote, however, nearly all study participants also noted that building 
relationships was easier to do in -person than remote, even as technology has bridged some of the 
gap between in -person and remote working relationships. Human Resource  Development (HRD) 
emphasizes learning, performance, and change where mechanisms to achieve these goals include 
leadership, organizational culture, training, and rewards (Gilley & Maycunich, 2000) which aligned 
with some of the results for factors that inf luence ISP compliance, in this study.

ID:8 - A proposed framework for effective implementation of quality 
management within training  
Renier Els  & Helen Meyer  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Quality management (QM), a holistic approach integrating managerial processes, is imperative for 
effective organisational processes, including training. This research investigates leaders’ 
perceptions, attitudes, and commitment to quality training manageme nt within corps training units 
(CTUs) in the South African Army. A qualitative multiple -case study approach was used, including a 
document review and focus group interviews with 49 officers across six CTUs. The document review 
reveals deficiencies in conce ptualising national human resource development strategies, 
particularly global perspectives and technological advancements. This highlights the need to 
integrate Total Quality Management (TQM) within Department of Defence training strategies to 
ensure trai ning effectiveness and organisational alignment. Focus group interviews indicated that 
leaders' attitudes toward QM in training are influenced by organisational culture, leadership 
support and commitment, prioritisation of quality management and self -devel opment. These 
attitudes affect leaders' commitment to QM in training. Hence, the  
study proposes a framework to address organisational and  
individual factors that adversely affect leaders' attitudes and commitment. By changing leaders' 
attitudes, this research suggests potential improvements in commitment to QM of training, 
benefiting organisations beyond the military

ID:9 - Integrating knowledge management and human resource development: 
a proposed definition  
 
Petro Smith  & Helen Meyer  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The role of knowledge management (KM) as a strategic knowledge resource is crucial, especially in 
crisis times (Thumiki & Jurcic, 2021) [such as the COVID -19 pandemic]. KM is vital in [developing] and 
preparing human resources for 4IR readiness in developing essential skills as 4IR enables 
organisations to increase their competitiveness and performance (Anshari et al., 2022:4). Current 
literature is unclear on how KM relates to HRD, nor does a definition of KM exist in an HRD contex t. 
Hence this paper aims to determine to what extent KM and HRD are indeed integrated with KM and 
to propose a KM definition within an HRD context.

ID:12  - Two Worlds Apart? Engineering Students’ Perceptions of Workplace 
English  
 
Akif Çal, Tessa Mearns  & Wilfried Admiraal  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This study aims to explore the extent to which engineering students' perceptions of the role of 
English in the workplace are influenced by their internships and fields of study. Previous research 
has shown that employers highly value English communication skills among engineers, as these 
skills are crucial for employment, daily operations, and career advancement. Additionally, the 
perceptions of workplace communication requirements among practicing engineers are affected by 
their engineering disciplines and  their company structures, whether domestic or multinational. In 
contexts with English -speaking engineers from different linguistic backgrounds, mismatches 
between workplace expectations and engineers' English competencies negatively impact their 
employabi lity.  
 
To investigate this topic, this study collected data from 347 engineering students in their third and 
fourth years at a Turkish university. Two independent variables were examined: the engineering 
field of study and internship experience. The study aimed t o explore whether engineering students 
developed an understanding of workplace communication requirements in English before 
graduating. Regarding the engineering field of study, the current research assessed whether 
students in different engineering discip lines perceived workplace English requirements differently. 
Furthermore, it focused on internship experience to analyze whether exposure to a workplace 
setting helped engineering students develop perceptions of workplace English requirements similar 
to tho se reported by practicing engineers.  
 
The results suggest that neither of the two independent variables resulted in any differences in 
engineering students' perceptions of the role of English in the workplace and its importance for 
their future careers. Moreover, it was found that engineering students from different fields of study 
and with or without internship experience reported workplace English requirements differently 
than practicing engineers did in previous research. These findings  have significant implications for 
higher education institutions and engineering curricula, highlighting the need to raise awareness 
among engineering students about workplace expectations through curricular reform. Additionally, 
the findings underscore th e critical role of internship programs for engineering students in 
understanding workplace structures and operations as prospective engineers, emphasizing the 
need for a review of such programs to offer engineering students quality exposure to a workplace 
setting.

Purpose – As the world is in constant evolution, the application of the "green" idea to human 
resource management, which is crucial for achieving both competitive advantage and 
environmental goals, is more and more current. It is known as "Green Human Resource 
Mana gement" (GHRM). The purpose of this study is to identify the evolution of challenges faced by 
green  human resources, training and development practices in the last 10 years, to analyze the 
current status  of green human resource management activities in a n automobile sector company 
in order to improve its effectiveness.  
 
Design/ methodology/ approach – The research will be conducted in three phases: In the first 
phase, a preliminary study was carried out to identify the training and development challenges for 
the last 10 years. In the second phase, a bibliometric study will then be carried out to study  the 
evolution of challenges faced by green human resources, training and development practices in the 
last 10 years. Finally, structured interviews will be conducted with technical staff and human 
resources manager of the hu man resources training department to analyze the current  state of 
activities developed by an automotive sector company according to the activities identified in the 
first and second phases.  
 
Findings – The expected results should confirm our hypothesis concerning the effective 
management in Green human resources.  
Future research/ limitations – Future research and limitations will be highlighted.

ID:48  - Working Paper: Adopting Action Learning to Teach the United Nations’ 
Sustainable Development Goals in Higher Education  
Yonjoo Cho, Sunyoung Park  & Rebecca Chunghee Kim  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
In Scholarship Reconsidered: Priorities of the Professoriate, Ernest Boyer (1990), the then president 
of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, proposed four kinds of scholarship: 
discovery (research), integration (synthesis), practice (a pplication), and teaching (pedagogy) that 
“shapes both research and practice” (p. 16). However, given the focus on discovery (research) in 
applied fields (Ghoshal, 2005) such as human resource development (HRD), the scholarship of 
teaching has received lim ited attention (Cho & Zachmeier, 2015). There also is a strong need to 
expand the bounded scope of HRD research to fill the gap between research and practice through 
incorporating more socially impactful research that contributes to the global agenda of su stainable 
development (Hoffman, 2021; Howard -Grenville et al., 2019).  
 
In this context, the purpose of this study is to examine the current state of the teaching of 
sustainability and the United Nations’ (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs) and to suggest 
the adoption of action learning as an experiential teaching method  in higher education. Our study is 
based on three research constructs: sustainability management (Annan -Diab & Molinari, 2017; 
Jarzabkowski et al., 2021; Stark et al., 2010), the UN’s SDGs (Fauzi et al., 2023; Howard -Grenville et 
al., 2019; Zarestky & Coll ins, 2017), and action learning (Booth et al., 2020; Park et al., 2023) as an 
experiential teaching method. Two research questions will guide our inquiry: what is the current 
state of the teaching of sustainability and the UN’s SDGs in higher education? Ho w can action 
learning be used to teach sustainability and the UN’s SDGs in higher education? To answer these 
research questions, we will work through the following three steps:  
 
• A literature review on sustainability management, the UN’s SDGs, and action learning as an 
experiential teaching method. As for the review of the literature on action learning, we will 
review 24 articles, identified in Cho and Egan (2023) related to action  learning for the SDG 4: 
Quality Education  
• Analysis of the curriculum on sustainability and the UN’s SDGs in higher education. We will 
review previous studies (e.g., Kurland et al., 2010; Molina et al., 2023) and existing 
curriculum (e.g., The sustainability degree program in California State Unive rsity, 
Northridge)  
• Presentation of an action learning case for its adoption to teach sustainability and the UN’s 
SDGs in higher education and the corresponding suggestions  
 
Having less than 10 years left to achieve the UN’s SDGs by 2030, this study will shed light on the 
teaching of sustainability and the UN’s SDGs in higher education and provide insights into the 
importance of adopting action learning as an experiential teac hing method. The study will show 
how “to do things differently for creating societal impact” (Hoffman, 2021, p. 515) in research and 
teaching. Furthermore, integration of action learning into the teaching of sustainability will suggest 
future leaders’ acti ons of how to play a role for accomplishing sustainable development of the world 
in three sustainability agendas: environmental sustainability (e.g., climate action, affordable and 
clean energy), social sustainability (e.g., poverty, health and well -being,  gender equality), and 
economic sustainability (e.g., long -term economic growth, corporate responsibility), all of which call 
for the seamless integration for implementation.

ID:61  - Investigating the intersection of AI technologies and HRD  
Malar Hirudayaraj  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
As organizations navigate the dynamic landscape of the modern workplace, the intersection of AI 
technologies and Human Resource Development (HRD) emerges as a pivotal area of exploration. 
This research investigates the multifaceted impact of AI on HRD practices, explore innovative 
strategies, address challenges, and contribute to the broader discourse on shaping the future of 
work.  Investigating the intersection of AI technologies and human resource development is 
essential for organizations seeking to harness the full potential of AI to improve workforce 
capabilities, optimize HR processes, and navigate the challenges and opportuni ties presented by the 
evolving nature of work.  
 
AI technologies have the potential to revolutionize the way employees acquire and develop skills 
and can help organizations prepare for future workforce dynamics, including the increasing 
integration of technology, changing job roles, and the need for ongo ing reskilling and upskilling. 
Research in this area helps organizations understand how AI can be leveraged to enhance training 
programs, personalize learning experiences, and ultimately improve workforce skills and 
performance. The integration of AI in HR D offers opportunities to optimize talent management 
processes, including recruitment, performance evaluation, and succession planning. Moreover, AI 
technologies can provide data -driven insights for informed decision -making in HRD. Investigating 
this inter section helps organizations understand how AI analytics can support strategic decision -
making, align HRD initiatives with overall business goals, and contribute to organizational success. 
Understanding the impact of AI on HRD practices helps organizations enhance the overall employee 
experience. Research in this area can identify how AI contributes to creating positive work 
environments, supports employee well -being, and fosters a culture of continuous learning and 
development. AI technologies can play a cr ucial role in fostering a culture of continuous learning 
within organizations. Investigating this intersection helps identify how AI -driven learning platforms, 
recommendation systems, and adaptive training programs can contribute to building a dynamic 
and learning -oriented workplace culture.  
 
This study adopts a horizon scanning (HS) approach and delves into the potential of AI to enhance 
workforce skills and performance. While literature reviews are past and present -oriented, focusing 
on summarizing existing knowledge up to the point of the re view, HS is future -oriented, 
emphasizing the identification of emerging trends and developments.  Therefore, Horizon scanning 
is particularly valuable in dynamic and rapidly evolving fields, where exploring current trends and 
anticipating future developmen ts are crucial for informing the discourse on the future of the field. 
Using HS, we scrutinize how AI is being used in Learning and Development, and how AI helps 
address pressing workforce challenges, such as skills gaps and talent shortages, while contrib uting 
to organizational competitiveness and agility. We also explore how AI can positively impact 
employee experience, well -being, and overall workplace culture, emphasizing the importance of 
creating dynamic environments that support learning and developm ent. By investigating the 
intersection of AI technologies and HRD, this research not only provides valuable insights for 
organizations seeking to harness AI's potential but also offers a roadmap for navigating the 
complexities and opportunities.

ID:62  - Strengthening Inclusive leadership: insights from a dedicated 
Professional Development Programme  
 
Rachel Verheijen -Tiemstra, Rob Poell, Anje Ros  & Marc Vermeulen  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This paper aims to answer the following research question: How did design criteria and contents of 
a professional development programme, according to participants, contribute to the development 
of their inclusive leadership behaviour? To this end, we followed 17 school and childcare leaders 
collaborating in Dutch child centres for education and childcare, who participated in a dedicated 
professional development programme on inclusive leadership. Triangulation utilised qualitative 
data from observations and interviews, complemented by pre - and post -programme self -
evaluations for a comprehensive analysis. Six distinct design criteria derived from the literature 
where tailored to developi ng inclusive leadership, which formed the basis for the programme that 
consisted of four sessions, spread over 5 months. The main finding suggests that participants' 
involvement in the professional development programme resulted in an augmented awareness o f 
inclusive leadership  which was manifested through the adoption of new behaviours or  an 
increased application of inclusive leadership behaviours. Essential design criteria for this purpose , 
according to participants, included collective learning, parti cipation in pairs, and self -regulated 
learning through the use of learning logs and reflective interviews, particularly when learning logs 
and reflective interviews were combined

ID:63  - Utilizing the learning environment enhances the benefits of digital 
learning platform on the organizational outcomes: A Case Study of ABC 
learning application  
Siriruk Sripunchapong  & Pawinee Petchsawang  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Organizations are embracing digital learning platforms to revolutionize employee training and 
development in the digital era (Bujang et al, 2020).  These platforms offer cost -effective alternatives 
to traditional methods, reducing expenses and facilitating  scalability across various locations. Post -
pandemic shifts have highlighted the significance of digital learning in navigating hybrid work 
models and fostering active employee engagement in learning initiatives (Nachmias & Hubschmid -
Vierheilig, 2021).   
 
While digital learning platforms offer unparalleled flexibility and personalized experiences, they also 
present challenges such as potential isolation, technical issues, and the necessity for digital literacy 
(Borup et al., 2014). A well -crafted learning e nvironment is crucial to maximize the benefits of these 
platforms (Mørk et al., 2020). Understanding the intricate relationship between digital learning 
platforms and organizational factors like physical workspace, social interactions, and leadership 
suppo rt is crucial. This comprehension enables organizations to cultivate a supportive learning 
environment, fostering engagement, collaboration, and personalized experiences, impacting 
employee satisfaction, knowledge acquisition, and overall performance for s ustained success in a 
competitive landscape.  
 
Theoretical base  
 
The conceptual framework used consisted of two theoretical frameworks that formed the study's 
perspective. Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory, proposed by Urie Bronfenbrenner (1979), 
focuses on the impact of various environmental systems. This theory identifies different layers of 
influence, including the microsystem (individual's immediate environment), mesosystem 
(interconnections between microsystems), exosyst em (external environments indirectly affecting 
individuals), macrosystem (societal or cultural influences), and chronosystem (time -related 
influences). Connectivism, formulated by Siemens (2004), focuses on learning through connections 
and networks in the digital age. It emphasizes adapting to evolving information landscapes by 
developing skills to navigate networks effectively. Hence, the integration of these two theories 
established the framework for this study. Bronfenbrenner’s model identified the envir onmental 
components, while Connectivism highlighted its significant impact on digital learning outcomes.  
 
Objectives  
1. To study the digital learning environment and categorize its components   
2. To explore the organizational outcomes stemming from the utilization of digital learning 
platforms  
3. To investigate the effect of the digital learning environment on overall organizational outcomes  
 
Research Questions  
1. What are the characteristics of a digital learning environment?    
2. What are the organizational outcomes of a digital learning platform?   
3. How does the digital learning environment affect organizational outcomes?

373 
Mixed -method study: qualitative phase explores digital learning environment characteristics and 
organizational outcomes. Subsequently, quantitative phase is to test relationship between digital 
learning environment and organizational outcomes.  
 
Implications for HRD practice  
This study guides HRD in utilizing digital learning platforms for training and development, 
enhancing learning environments, fostering continuous learning cultures, and aligning 
organizational goals by upskilling employees efficiently.  
 
Conclusions  
This research emphasizes the pivotal role of digital learning environment in shaping organizational 
outcomes, highlighting their significant impact on enhancing effectiveness. It underscores the 
importance for HRD to leverage these insights, align training  strategies, and foster supportive 
learning environment through digital platforms to enhance organizational performance and 
adaptability in a rapidly changing landscape.

ID:99  - Working Paper - Can adopting critical approaches to evaluation 
enhance the understanding and value of knowledge exchange?  
Catharine Ross, Lynn Nichol, Carole Elliott, Sally Sambrook  & Jim Stewart  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Importance  
Knowledge exchange (KE) has been defined as ‘the wide range of activities HEPs [Higher Education 
Providers] undertake with partners’ (Research England 2023 a) to ensure that the knowledge they 
teach and create ‘can be used for the benefit of the economy an d society’ (Research England 2023 
b). We suggest it could be conceived as a form of HRD, ‘shaping individual and group values and 
beliefs and skilling through learning -related activities to support the desired performance of the 
host system’ (Wang et al, 2 016). Given its increasing importance (Marzocchi et al, 2023; Atta -Owuso 
and Fitjar, 2023), we explore how KE is evaluated in a KE case study and whether its value might be 
enhanced through greater application of critical HRD evaluation approaches.  
  
Theoretical base  
KE evaluation can focus on process or outcomes (Upton et al, 2014). The UK government’s current 
approaches predominantly assess outcomes, or the mere occurrence of knowledge exchange 
(Research England 2023c). Where outcome -based it tends to focus on commercia lisation metrics 
leading to concerns that certain forms of KE may be incentivised over others (Rossi and Rosli, 2015).  
A focus on commercial outcomes defined by a narrow range of stakeholders mirrors some 
orthodox approaches to HRD evaluation such as derived from Kirkpatrick focusing on impact on job 
performance and achievement of organisational goals (Reio at al, 2017). O ther approaches assess 
alternative outcomes such as increased equity for marginalised stakeholders (Bierema et al, 2024), 
recognising alternative or wider stakeholder needs. Such approaches may reflect critical HRD by 
challenging assumptions about interven tions (Corley and Eades, 2014) and/or highlighting 
conflicting interests (Sambrook, 2021).  
 
Research purpose and methods  
This research assesses whether existing mechanisms of KE evaluation enhance its value, for which 
groups, and how that might be affected by the application of approaches derived from critical HRD. 
It seeks to answer:  
-How do case study stakeholders evaluate the KE?  
-To what extent would these evaluations be captured by current dominant mechanisms for 
evaluating KE?  
-To what extent would these evaluations be captured by approaches derived from orthodox HRD 
practice?  
-How might applying critical HRD approaches to evaluation increase the value of KE?  
Thematic analysis of interviews with stakeholders in a longitudinal case study was undertaken in 
January/February 2022 and December/January 2023.  
 
Implications for HRD practice  
The research sets out potential implications of different approaches to evaluation for diverse KE 
stakeholders. It supports those involved in learning from KE to select evaluation approaches that 
reflect on the purpose and value of KE.  
 
Conclusions  
Applying outcome -based approaches to HRD evaluation could ensure that KE enhances the 
performance of the host system according to its definition of value rather than adopting

375 
government -defined value definitions, while some process -based approaches could improve 
performance in line with the goals of stakeholders. However, these might run counter to critical 
HRD aspirations which may be better served by evaluation approaches whi ch support individual 
reflection on learning regardless of system benefits. Additional critical HRD approaches (Bierema et 
al 2024) could also provide relevant methods of evaluating KE.

ID:109  - Antecedents and Outcomes of Organizational Socialization for the 
Early Careers of High School Graduates: The Role of Informal Learning  
Yoonhee Park, Suwon Yim  & Mirae Oh  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Although research has widely recognized learning through social interactions as a key factor in 
organizational socialization, empirical studies have not paid sufficient attention to informal learning 
as a trigger of newcomer socialization. In addition, there is little understanding of how job context 
and individual perceptions toward informal learning influence organizational socialization and 
turnover intention. In the present study,  it was proposed that both job characteristics and informal 
learning can influence organizational socialization. Moreover, informal learning was considered as a 
mediator between job characteristics and organizational socialization. With a sample of early 
careers of male high school graduates in South Korea, the research showed that job characteristics 
influence newcomer’s socialization directly and through informal learning. Additionally, 
organizational socialization was found to result in lowering intentio n to leave by increasing job 
satisfaction. Based on the results of the study, several implications were discussed.

ID:114  - Exploring the origins of training: A mixed -method historical study of 
Hadrian’s Wall  
Kenneth Bartlett  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
The historical origins of human resource development (HRD) have attracted attention and on -going 
theoretical debate in the field, especially when viewed from the perspective of dominate narratives 
and the privileged position of selected versions of history as foundational to be taught in colleges 
and universities. Lee (2015) noted that HRD has a history in that: “People have been “doing” what 
could have called HRD for many years, but these activities were not initially conceptualized as HRD – 
it is only us looking backwards that now call “it” HRD” (p. 3). Swanson and Holton (2001) trace the 
history of HRD in the United States with origins to the anci ent Greek and Roman era. Although, as 
Perriton (2022) observed, it is clear that Swanson and Holton discount these classical origin roots in 
the historical foundation narrative of mid -20th century development of HRD.  
As an applied discipline, HRD is not unique in exploration of ancient Roman origins that inform 
current conceptualizations of theory and practice. Historiographies on labor management (Van der 
Linden, 2010) and project management (Seymour & Hussein, 2014) have highlighted that large -scale 
projects like the Egyptian pyramids, China’s Great Wall, or Hadrian’s Wall show origins of people 
management including training, development, and leadership. Yet, historical studies with direct 
evidence of practices that a lign with contemporary conceptualizations of HRD are scant.  
 
Theoretical base  
The theoretical concept of place remains largely absent from HRD research. To explore the 
phenomenological dimensions of a place and its relative connection and contribution to the history 
of training, in this case at Hadrian’s Wall, required extension bey ond one single discipline or theory 
for a broader and diverse framework of understanding (Gruenewald, 2003). The theoretical 
framework drew from history, geography border studies, and Heideggerian philosophy applied to 
the activity -based experience followi ng the “walking and knowing the past tradition” documented by 
the historian Readman (2021). Application of this theoretical framework allowed the ‘Wall’ to serve 
as a geographic zone for temporal, spatial and experiential dimensions to examine aspects of t he 
history of HRD.  
 
Research purpose  
The purpose of this study was to conduct an interdisciplinary investigation into historical evidence 
of training associated with the construction and operation of the Roman built Hadrian’s Wall in 
northern England. The significance of this study is despite  mention of the training required to build 
and operate the Hadrian’s Wall, no investigation has focused on the collective evidence and 
consequently, the role of training in Roman Britain as a core aspect in the narrative of the origins of 
HRD is limited.  
 
Research question/s  
The broad research question was: What evidence of activity related to current conceptualizations of 
training as a core HRD practice are associated with Hadrian’s Wall during the period of AD 122 -410 .  
This study used a combination of research methods drawing from a diverse range of academic 
disciplines. However, the overarching method drew from research in adventure education, outdoor 
learning, and leisure studies with an ethnographic approach considere d vital to contextualize 
authentic interactions between person and place (Kennedy, MacPhail, & Varley, 2020). In this study, 
a six -day solo hiking expedition along the length of the Hadrian’s Wall Path provided an opportunity

378 
to explore references to training, development, and learning for Roman soldiers/administrators 
during the period of AD 122 -410 from an embedded ‘sense of place’ theoretical framework.  
Data collected included literature review of academic sources, documentation at various museum 
and historical sites directly connected to Hadrian’s Wall such as exhibits, interpretative signs, 
brochures, and guidebooks. I also maintained a written journal,  recording my observations in the 
field. Using the thematic analysis approach of Braun and Clarke (2006), the data were iteratively 
themed and analyzed.

ID:115  - The Impact of Training and Development Opportunities on Job 
Satisfaction and Turnover Intention: In a Moroccan University  
Khaoula El Fellahi, Hiba Afakkir, Mohamed Ennoman  & Jeong -Ha Yim  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Organizations provide training and development (T&D) to employees to rapidly expand and utilize 
their workforce and develop skills, and training development is an essential element in modern 
organizations (Torraco, 2016). Environmental changes resulting fr om globalization and digitalization 
require us to acquire knowledge and skills more frequently and continuously. In particular, higher 
education educators are responsible for cultivating talent who can respond to these changes. 
Therefore, due to their prof essional obligations and the digitalizing work, they are the first to face 
the need for T&D to embrace the change. Due to a lack of T&D opportunities or quality, the job 
satisfaction (JS) of employees who cannot keep up with these change demands can drop 
significantly, increasing turnover intentions (Mouaddib et al., 2023; Mahboub et al., 2023).  
Mobley (1977) proposed an early model linking employee turnover intention (TI) to JS and 
identifying attitudinal, decisional, and behavioral dimensions (Mobley, 1983). Based on the model, 
many scholars have reported a negative relationship between JS and T I (Ait Alla, 2019; Andoh, 2021; 
Berguig, 2019; Fite, 2022; Hanaty, 2022; Memon, 2016;) and the determinants of TI (Hajjami, 2023). 
However, little research links them with T&D, although continuous learning is becoming more 
important in a rapidly changing o rganizational environment. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, even 
though T&D is an important issue for organizations, including higher education institutions, 
research on this topic that targets them is limited. Therefore, this study aims to examine the impa ct 
of T&D on JS and TI of faculty in higher education and to investigate whether T&D moderates the 
relationship between JS and TI. The research questions are as follows.  
 
1) What is the relationship between T&D and JS?  
2) What is the relationship between T&D and TI?  
3) What is the relationship between JS and IT?  
4) Does T&D moderate the relationship between JS and TI?  
 
The sample consists of about 150 to 200 faculty members in a university in Morocco, including full -
time, part -time, and lecturers who have been employed at the institution for more than one year 
and have participated in the faculty T&D programs at least fo ur times in the past year. Data will be 
collected through a survey, and regression analysis will be used to reveal the relationships between 
variables and the moderating effect of T&D.   
 
By unraveling the relationships among these variables, this study is expected to provide insight into 
strategies that can increase employee satisfaction, improve performance, and reduce turnover 
among the university faculty, emphasizing the importance of T &D in the globalization and digital 
age. Furthermore, despite being a limited context, this study will contribute to filling the gap in HRD 
research as an empirical study conducted in a Moroccan higher education setting.

ID:126  - The Impact of Psychological Safety on Knowledge Sharing with 
Employees’ Well -being as a Mediator  
Shinhee Park  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This study examines the relationship between psychological safety, knowledge sharing, and the 
mediating role of employee’s well -being. As the business environment continuously evolves due to 
technological advancements, the significance of knowledge sharing  becomes indispensable for 
organizations that are seeking to establish a lasting competitive advantage. Knowledge sharing, a 
critical component of organizational effectiveness, is defined as the transmission of individual 
expertise or problem -solving skill s to the larger collective (Bock et al., 2005). Knowledge sharing 
includes employees’ voluntary sharing of relevant information to support goal achievement, 
collaborative problem -solving, and innovation (Ipe, 2003; Wang & Noe, 2010). The study will employ 
a 5-item scale (Bock et al., 2005) to measure knowledge sharing behaviors that are categorized into 
explicit and implicit dimensions. The items reflect the extent to which employees share reports, 
documents, experience, and expertise with team members in o rder to examine their contribution to 
the knowledge -sharing process.  
 
In recent years, psychological safety has gained practical significance, which was partially the result 
of an increased emphasis on learning and innovation within contemporary organizations 
(Edmondson & Lei, 2014). The concept of psychological safety, whic h is defined as employees’ trust 
that their thoughts and vulnerabilities will be treated respectfully and without repercussions 
(Edmondson, 1999), is central to this inquiry. Psychological safety is the atmosphere in which people 
feel free to express their  ideas, express their worries, and take risks without fear of retaliation. A 7 -
item scale will be used to evaluate this construct (Edmondson, 1999), which measures how much 
team dynamics encourage candid communication, taking calculated risks, and apprecia ting 
individual contributions.  
 
In terms of organizational competitiveness, employees’ well -being and knowledge sharing are 
becoming essential elements. Berraies et al. (2020) revealed that knowledge sharing uses employee 
well-being as a lever. Bietry and Creusier (2013) conceptualized e mployees’ well -being as a two -
dimensional concept integrating both eudaimonic and hedonic aspects. George and Brief (1992) 
and Wang et al. (2017) emphasized that hedonic aspects of well -being, such as happiness, pleasure, 
enjoyment, and satisfaction regard ing the physical work environment, encourage employees to 
share their knowledge with their colleagues and spread cooperation and kindness. Additionally, 
knowledge sharing is fostered by the eudaimonic aspects of well -being, which include personal 
growth, a  sense of purpose in life, and supervisors’ recognition and compassion. Knowledge 
workers may believe that their managers value their talents and consider their intrinsic needs, 
which inspires them to share their knowledge and assist others, if they are se eking autonomy, a 
challenging work environment, and personal progress (Chumg et al., 2016).  
We will employ a quantitative research approach to examine these relationships at an individual 
level of analysis. Data will be collected through surveys that will be given to IT engineers in large 
companies in South Korea. We plan to collect 300 samples f or analysis. Structural equation 
modeling (SEM) will be used to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of psychological safety on 
knowledge sharing with employees’ well -being as a mediator. The measurement model will assess 
the reliability and validity o f the measurement indicators for psychological safety and knowledge 
sharing.

381 
This study’s findings will have significant implications for both theoretical and practical fields. The 
current study will offer a validated measure of the conceptual framework by Edmondson and Lei 
(2014). By identifying the mechanisms through which psycho logical safety affects knowledge 
sharing, the study contributes to psychological safety theory and organizational behavior literature. 
This study will also have implications for organization leaders and managers from HRD 
perspectives. In particular, as emp hasized in previous studies that showed that employees’ well -
being has a direct impact on knowledge sharing, employees’ well -being can be formed through 
members’ positive self -acceptance, emphasis on personal growth and life purpose, and smooth 
interperson al relationships. In other words, it is necessary to introduce a new process for 
knowledge management, but the organization leaders and managers must first listen more 
carefully to the mind management of their members to promote knowledge sharing and stren gthen 
the organization’s capabilities.

ID:128  - Impact of Generative AI on Supply Chain and Human Resources  
Otacilio José Moreira, Cezario Bruno Santos, André Luis Azevedo Guedes, 
Aurelio Lamare Soares Murta  & Maria Carolina Rodrigues  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen -AI) is an emerging technology that could revolutionize supply 
chain management (SCM). However, there are concerns about the benefits, challenges, and 
implications of Gen -AI for businesses and workers. Research on the  impact of Gen -AI on SCM is 
important in helping businesses make informed decisions about adopting this technology. 
Therefore, the objective of this article was to understand the aspects of Gen -AI's influence on the 
management of SCM processes and people, exploring the benefits, challenges, and emerging 
trends. The methodology used for this study was based on field research and, as for the objectives, 
qualitative exploratory. Data were collected from a group of 160 professionals working in SCM 
processes in Rio de Janeiro through an online questionnaire.  The main results show that 25% of 
respondents already use Gen -AI in their processes and 17% have projects evaluating its use. The 
most significant benefit pointed out was increased efficiency. Technology can  also improve the 
overall performance of SCM, but risks and ethical considerations need to be considered. 
Organizational learning is an accelerating factor of results in the implementation of Gen -AI in SCM. 
This study offers insights for academics and prac titioners working in supply chains. The technology 
has further demonstrated a potential to improve the efficiency and performance of supply chain 
management (SCM), but there are limitations that need to be overcome for its better adoption.

ABSTRACT  
 
This study used the multi -level analysis to explore the three different relationships between 
organizational and personal levels. First, the corporate environmentalism and organization resource 
commitment (organization -level) affect employee green compente nce. Second, green curiosity and 
green creativity (personal -level) affect on employee green compentence. Third, green creativity 
mediated the relationship between green curiosity and employee green compentence.  
Drawing on natural -resource -based view, signal theory, and green human resource management. 
There are nearly 345 valid respondants from Taiwan enterprises were surveyed. After measuring 
the data using SPSS, AMOS, and HLM, the results demonstrated that corp orate environmentalism, 
green resource commitment, green curiosity, and green creativity had positively affected employees 
green compentence. The empirical research on the workplace situation, and incorporates both 
organizational and personal factors. This  study provides insightful perspectives to explore the core 
competitive advantages of enterprises. The analysis findings and insights of this study expands and 
fills in the gaps in related research, and provides a reference for future cross -level integrati on

ID:160  - ESF in Portugal – a reassessment (2009 -2021).  
Eduardo Tomé  
 
ABSTRACT  
Importance and Purpose  
This paper analyses the investment of the ESF in Portugal from the point of view of HRD. It follows 
and adjourns Tomé, 2013, who analysed the period 1986 -2008. It is an important question given 
that in the next years the EU plans to invest a lot on Portuga l through the ESF. It is decisive to make 
an update on that assessment,  
 
Theoretical base  
The paper is based in the concept of National HRD as defined by McLean, 2014.. In recent years 
National HRD models have been applied in more and more countries like the USA (Knowles, Holton 
and Swanson, 2011), China (Liu and Wall, 2005), India (Srimannaray ana,2009), Russia (Zavialova, 
2011) Brazil (Sparkman. 2015) or Japan (Warner 1984, Werner, 1994). We assume that the ESF is a 
form of investment in HRD made using EU funds, and those funds should produce some form of 
investment (European Commission, 2017) . The investments has costs, and should generate 
benefits in terms of wages, . -(Gramlich, 1997), In order to access those policies basically two types of 
methodologies exist: based on results, answering the question – what happened ? and based on 
impacts ?  based on the question – what difference did the investment make ? (Tomé, 2005). The first 
question is important but the second is really the central one when evaluating HRD policies. Rather 
significantly, HRD policies have been evaluated in fine form in t he OECD countries (Tomé, 2001).  
 
Methods  
We will use a three steps methodology The first level follows Garavan, Morley and McCharty, 2016; 
therefore we begin to describe the basic setting of HRD in the three countries analysed in the paper; 
the items to be addressed are the following: 1) context background; 2) broad vocational education 
and training (VET) systems; 3) institutional actors; 4) political context. In the second level we 
specifically detail the HRD policies basing ourselves in Tomé 2012 and Tomé 2013); the following 
topics addressed; 1) basic legislative documents, 2) guidelines on eligibility, 3) programs, 4) 
evaluation procedures. Finally, in the thir d and deepest level we analyse the policies outcomes in 
line with (Tomé and Goyal, 2016); specifically, we address the following topics: 1) stocks, investment, 
and outcomes; 2) price, quantity, supply, demand, equilibria; 3) needs. The three levels enable us to 
answer to the paper’s research question.  
 
Research question/s  
The research question is - what is the impact of the ESF in Portugal since 2009 ?  In order to answer 
to that research question we will use data published by the national administration  and will also 
compare our findings with studies which have already be en done and are available in the SCOPUS 
database.  
 
Implications for HRD practice  
The assessment should give guidelines on how to improve the investment of HRD in countries 
supported by the European Social Fund  
 
Conclusions  
At this stage we believe we will conclude that the high level of investment is not always matched by 
quality standards. indeed, a "paradox of absorption" may be observed, in which the investment is a 
waste of money and may be even be  counter -productive.

ID:162  - HRD in Portugal – a century of very relevant history  
Eduardo Tomé  & Elizaveta Gromova  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Purpose and Importance   
2024 is a very significant year in the history of Portugal. In fact it marks 50 years since the coup of 
April 25th 1974, which was ensued by a revolutionary period that ended in 25th November of 1975, 
following which a democratic constitution was approved in 1976. Therefore Portugal is celebrating 
50 years of democracy and freedom. Crucially, before democracy the country had also 48 years of a 
dictatorship, in which HR were not a priority. In fact before 1974 HRD in Portugal was elitist, 
informal or externa l (Tomé, 2007).  
 
Therefore it is very important and interesting to try to analyse the situation of HRD in Portugal in 
three points in time: 1926, 1974 and 2023. We will gain a massive volume of knowledge from a long 
term perspective by achieving that exercise.  
 
Theories  
The paper is based in the concept of National HRD as defined by McLean, 2014.. In recent years 
National HRD models have been applied in more and more countries like the USA (Knowles, Holton 
and Swanson, 2011), China (Liu and Wall, 2005), India (Srimannaray ana,2009), Russia (Zavialova, 
2011) Brazil (Sparkman. 2015) or Japan (Warner 1984, Werner, 1994). The investment in HRD has 
costs, and should generate benefits in terms of wages, . -(Gramlich, 1997), In order to access those 
policies basically two types of methodologies exist: based on results, answering the question – what 
happened ? and based on impacts ? based on the question – what difference did the investment 
make ? (Tomé, 2005). The first question is important but the second is really the central one when 
evaluating HRD policies. Rather significantly, HRD policies have been evaluated in fine form in the 
OECD countries (Tomé, 2001).  
 
Methods  
We will use a three steps methodology The first level follows Garavan, Morley and McCharty, 2016; 
therefore we begin to describe the basic setting of HRD in the three countries analysed in the paper; 
the items to be addressed are the following: 1) context background; 2) broad vocational education 
and training (VET) systems; 3) institutional actors; 4) political context. In the second level we 
specifically detail the HRD policies basing ourselves in Tomé 2012 and Tomé 2013); the following

line with (Tomé and Goyal, 2016); specifically, we address the following topics:  1) stocks, investment, 
and outcomes; 2) price, quantity, supply, demand, equilibria; 3) needs. The three levels enable us to 
answer to the paper’s research question. We want to use these three levels for the three situations 
circa 1926 (before the dictato rship), 1974 (end of the dictatorship) and 2024 (after 50 years of 
democracy) and to make useful comparisons.  
 
Research Questions  
How can we compare the situations of HRD in Portugal for 1926, 1974 and 2023 ? What are the 
main ideas that can be derived from that comparison ?  
Implications for HRD practice

387 
The political context is important for HRD. Regimes like the one that ruled Portugal from 1926 to 
1974 are the anti -thesis of HRD. They are also connected with the so -called “extreme -right”. Given 
the current raise of those political forces in Europe this type of comparison is very pertinent,  
 
Conclusions   
From 1926 to 1974 Portugal remained as a “low skills equilibria” on HRD, and as a result its 
economy went backwards and lagged more and more behind Western Europe and even Eastern 
Europe. In the last 50 years, with democracy, national effort and EU support  the country became 
first a “middle skills equilibrium” and later a “high skills equilibrium”,

ID:166  - Analysis of the paradigms of financial education and the interactions 
of financial market agents  
Bráulio Vieira de Andrade  & Américo da Costa Ramos Filho  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The quality of financial services in Brazil is intrinsically linked to various challenges and dynamics. 
The conflict of interest in large institutions highlights the tension between institutional sales goals 
and customer needs. The concentration of financi al institutions can result in a lack of competition, 
limiting choices for consumers and negatively affecting innovation. The restricted autonomy of 
professionals in these institutions contrasts with the supposed independence of autonomous 
professionals, br inging up the issue of credibility. Amidst these complexities, financial education 
emerges as a fundamental pillar. The lack of financial understanding contributes to inadequate 
decisions, making it clear the need for a more informed population. Additional ly, solid regulation 
stands out as vital to ensuring transparency, protecting the interests of clients, and promoting 
healthier competition. In this point, the theoretical approach reflects the interconnection between 
conflicts of interest, lack of competi tion, the need for autonomy, and the centrality of financial 
education and regulation in enhancing financial services.  
 
The debate on the quality of financial services in Brazil is propelled by a complex intersection of 
challenges, extensively explored through studies conducted by organizations such as the OECD 
(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) and the ENEF (National Strategy for 
Financial Education in Brazil), along with insights fro m renowned researchers including Annamaria 
Lusardi and Richard Thaler, Stephen Ball, and others. Issues such as conflicts of interest in large 
institutions, indicated by corporate goals that may supersede client interests, and market 
concentration leading to innovation stagnation, are pivotal. The discourse also encompasses limited 
autonomy in major institutions and the necessity for credibility in autonomous professionals. 
Amidst these intricacies, the paramount role of financial education becomes evident,  with its gaps 
contributing to inadequate financial decisions. Thus, the debate transcends these elements, 
addressing conflicts, fostering competition, ensuring autonomy, and underscoring the need for a 
more financially literate population, as underscored by Financial Brazilian entities.  
The discourse surrounding the quality of financial services in Brazil is a nuanced exploration, 
delving into the multifaceted impact of financial literacy, as elucidated by institutions like the OECD 
and ENEF. Amidst the backdrop of debates about professio nals in large financial institutions, a 
prominent theme emerges — the transformative influence of financial education. The inadequacies 
in financial literacy not only compromise individual decision -making but reverberate through the 
broader economic landsca pe. 
 
Crucially interlinked with this is the realm of behavioral economics, as spearheaded by scholars like 
was mentioned before. Their work accentuates how cognitive biases and informational asymmetry, 
exacerbated by a lack of financial education, can lead to s uboptimal financial choices. The 
consequences extend beyond individual portfolios, impacting the overall economic stability.  
Recognizing this, the debate extends beyond the mere autonomy of professionals and touches 
upon the fundamental need for a financially literate populace. Brazilian financial and capital market 
entities echo this sentiment, emphasizing the vital role of fin ancial education in cultivating informed 
decision -makers. This comprehensive understanding; of the interconnectedness between 
education, behavioral economics, and broader economic health; underscores the imperative for not 
only autonomy in financial advisi ng but, more fundamentally, the imperative for a populace 
equipped with the knowledge to make sound financial decisions.  
The discourse on the quality of financial services in Brazil is enriched by considering the perspective 
of Human Resource Development (HRD) practices. Within this debate, HRD plays a crucial role in

389 
empowering financial professionals. Effective HRD strategies not only promote continuous 
education in financial literacy but also cultivate an organizational culture that values ethics and 
transparency. By encouraging responsible autonomy and ethical decis ion-making, HRD practices 
can be a fundamental tool in mitigating conflicts of interest in financial institutions.  
Furthermore, in the context of behavioral economics, HRD practices can be implemented to raise 
awareness of cognitive biases and promote a customer -centric approach. HRD initiatives aimed at 
promoting diversity and inclusion can also play a crucial role, ensuring that financial institutions 
reflect a wide range of perspectives and experiences.  
 
Thus, by considering HRD practices as an integral component of this debate, it is possible to 
strengthen the connection between financial education, behavioral economics, and ethics in 
decision -making, contributing to a more holistic approach to improving financial services.  
The discussion on the quality of financial services in Brazil reaches a climax by integrating the 
various facets examined throughout this dialogue. By exploring the influence of Human Resource 
Development (HRD) practices and their intersection with financi al education and behavioral 
economics, crucial perspectives emerge to enhance the dynamics of the sector.  
Starting with financial education, the identified gaps reveal not only individual challenges but also 
systemic implications for economic stability. Financial literacy is not just an individual skill; it is a 
foundation for an economically resilient society . International organizations like the OECD and 
national initiatives, exemplified by ENEF, emphasize the importance of an informed population for 
sustainable development.  
 
Delving into behavioral economics, in this study the highlights of how cognitive biases can shape 
financial choices. This understanding is a call to action for HRD practices, as professionals need to 
be equipped to understand and mitigate these biases, pro moting a customer -centric and ethical 
approach.  
 
The inclusion of HRD practices emerges as a crucial piece in this puzzle. Ongoing empowerment, 
coupled with an organizational culture that values ethics and diversity, not only strengthens the 
autonomy of professionals but also acts as a buffer against con flicts of interest. HRD is not merely a 
department within organizations; it is a facilitator of cultural transformations, vital to align 
institutional interests with those of clients.  
 
Therefore, the unequivocal conclusion is that the quality of financial services in Brazil cannot be 
dissociated from the continuous investment in financial education and HRD practices that foster 
ethics, diversity, and adaptation to the nuances of behavior al economics. Only through this synergy 
can one envision a scenario where financial professionals, institutions, and, more crucially, clients 
thrive in a dynamic and equitable financial ecosystem.  
 
In summary, by aligning financial education, behavioral economics, and HRD practices, Brazil can 
pave the way for a positive transformation in the financial sector, elevating not only the quality of 
services but also the confidence and security of citizens  in their financial journeys.

ID:168  - Frontline Managers’ Creativity KSA Development and Performance 
Post -Structured Training Intervention : A Self -Regulated Learning Perspective  
Anastasia Kulichyova, T homas Garavan & Stefan Jooss  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Creativity research has primarily focused on employees and largely ignored frontline managers 
(FLMs) despite their key role in shaping creativity in organisations. In addition, reserah has focused 
on  structured creativity training interventions (SCTIs) as  a key approach to developing the creativity 
knowledge, skills, and abilities (CKSAs) of employees. A key gap in the literature concerned what 
happens post -structured training and  specifically what do managers do to  enhance their CKSAs.  In 
this  study w e utilise self -regulated learning theory to understand the learning  processes that FLMs 
engage in to further develop their CKSAs and achieve creative performance.  
 
We focused on FLMs who are central to managing employees in hotels and help them to deliver 
high levels of customer service (Garavan et al., 2022). This provides the common characteristics 
linking our study participants, who represented four hotels located  in Northern Ireland. Rather than 
selecting a single organisation, we approached a number of hotels that had the development of CPS 
as a key priority for FLMs. The hotels employed between 50 -100 staff and were classified as three -
and four -star hotels targe ting an upper -midlevel market. Each hotel operated in a highly 
competitive market, and the requirement for developing creative and innovative service solutions 
was considered imperative for market share. The hotels have been operating for over 20 years and  
had a well -established market position. Within each hotel, we derived a sample of 50 FLMs in key 
divisions (e.g., Sales, Marketing, Finance, HR, Rooms -Division, Food and Beverage).  
 
We used semi -structured interviews because of their potential to facilitate the exploration of 
underexamined phenomena or constructs and to generate micro -level information “that presents 
the phenomenon of interest in its variety and complexity” (Katz, 2004: 83). First, prior to the training 
session, we interviewed the HR/General Manager within each hotel to provide data on the industry 
context and und erstand current initiatives to promote FLMs’ creativity. Second, three months post -
training session, we interviewed the 23 managers who completed the training and focused don 
their CKSAs development post  training and  their creative performance. Our findi ngs highlight that 
the structured training intervention acted as an important  external stimulus for CKSA development 
in the workplace and  surface five key phases of CKDA development and  performance: preparation, 
action,  consolidation,  performance and self-assessment. In doing so we combine both cognitive 
and behavioural perspectives and their role in achieving creative performance by FLMs  post 
training.

ID:173  - Developing HR Business Partners: Understanding how a Community 
of Practice can be created given the Paradoxes and Peculiarities of the HRBP 
Role  
Martin McCracken, Hadyn Bennett  & Keira O'Kane  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Significance/contribution to the HRD field  
The research study is designed to understand how HRBPs negotiate their professional role and 
what skills and competencies are most important to ensure they are successful in dealing with the 
complexities of on one hand being expected to play a more strateg ic role, but rather frustratingly 
for them, on the other frequently find themselves drawn into more operational and transactional 
activities in the course of their day to day activities.   
 
Aim and purpose  
Over the last couple of decades the role of the HRM function has evolved to enable better 
integration and strategic partnership with other organisational functions and departments. Building 
upon previous research into the role of HR Professionals the aim o f this study is to identify core 
competences and learning processes unique to HR Business Partner (HRBP) roles by investigating 
the presence of a HRBP Community of Practice (CoP) existing across multiple organisations.  
 
Theoretical foundations  
In recent times the HRM function has evolved to facilitate better strategic partnership with other 
organizational functions and departments. Building upon previous research (McCracken et al, 2017; 
Kegan et al, 2019;  Bennett et al, 2023), this study invest igated issues linked to HR Business Partners 
(HRBP) professional development and understanding the challenges they face when building and 
maintaining relationships with functional / departmental managers and other HR colleagues. The 
findings from these pre vious studies revealed that HRBPs often find themselves at the centre of a 
dilemma in relation to their roles and need to possess key leadership competencies linked to 
emotional intelligence, decision making and managing complex political scenarios when th ey are 
drawn into operational issues which are formally not part of their duties. It was also found that they 
often found themselves in quite an isolated position where because of their roles they were never 
fully aligned to the HR function, because of the ir distance from central HR, but never fully integrated 
into the function they served due to their background in HR versus the business.  With this in mind 
the concept of Communities of Practice emerged as a theoretical position which might help us to 
better understand how HRBPs could benefit from mutual learning and development opportunities.   
In keeping with Pritchard & Fear’s (2015) perspective of expertise as ‘practice -based’, social learning 
and Community of Practice (CoP) theory will provide a lens f or looking beyond individual 
organisations to explore a wider HRBP practice.  Described as social containers of competence by 
Wenger (2000), CoPs are “considered bounded social groups identifiable where individuals are 
united around the three components of  joint enterprise, mutuality and shared repertoire” (O’Kane, 
2020: 2).  
 
Methodology/analytical techniques  
Data collection is ongoing, commencing in January 2024 but dependent on access will conclude in 
May 2024.   The research will be based upon a number of case studies undertaken with 
organisations (up to five) in various sectors in the UK through a series of  semi structured interviews 
and focus groups.  After initial discussions with key HR professionals this case study approach has 
been approved and data collection has commenced with key individuals / parties representing four  
levels / roles:

392 
1. Firstly, Senior Directors in each organization including Directors of HR and Strategic 
Development.  These interviews were designed to gain an insight into each organizations contextual 
background and key issues which impact decision -making regarding HR  strategy, structure and 
policies.  
2. Secondly, interviews will be held held with the HR Business Partners whose central role is to 
support the key organizational areas.  These interviews will investigate how HR Business Partners 
currently operate, how their roles are evolving, how they ini tiate and adapt a ‘partnership’ approach 
with other organization departments and what they feel are the critical success factors which allow 
HRBPs to form relationships and partner effectively. Another integral line of questioning in these 
interviews cente red on the skills and competencies that they employ to make the HRBP model a 
success in their organizations.    
3. Thirdly, Senior Managers in the main functional areas will be interviewed to ascertain their 
perspective on HR in general, but more specifically in relation to the HR Business Partner model and 
the HRBPs with whom they have a close working relationship.    Questions will focus upon 
establishing how the partnership works from the senior managers’ perspective, and attempts will 
be made to gain critical insights relating to the factors that ensure the model works well in practice.  
Interviews will be audio recorded using a dictaphone and transcibed verbatim into Microsoft Word 
format. This will allow the investigator to give their full attention to the participant during interview 
and enhance their ability to provide appropriate foll ow-on questions while capturing the 
participants responses word for word. The transcibed data will be uploaded to NVivo12 in 
anonomyised Mircosoft Word documents to allow for indepth narrative and thematic analysis.  
 
Conclusions/likely conclusions  
The research will offer ideas on the kind of developmental programme, based upon the 
communities of practice concept, that HRBPS might engage in to help enhance their professional 
practice.   
 
Relevance of paper to conference theme  
The research fits in the Workplace Learning, Training and Development theme given its emphasis 
on understanding how HRBPs lean and develop COPs both internally in their own organizations and 
also by liaising and networking with external professional collea gues.

ID:176  - Improving Top Management Trust In HR/D Professionals: Evidence 
Based Decision Making To The Rescue?  
Claire Gubbins, Lisa Van Der Werff, Brian Harney  & Denise M. Rousseau  
 
ABSTRACT  
Strategic business partner status represents something of a holy grail for HR/D practitioners with 
progression towards strategic business partner status still proving challenging (Lawler and 
Boudreau, 2012). One of the greatest challenges faced is gaining legitimacy and relevance in the 
eyes of top management (Claus and Collison, 2005) and skepticism concerning the performance 
impact of HR practices and interventions (Legge, Guest and King, 2004). Improving top management 
trust in HR/D professionals (Aldric h et al., 2015) is a strategic imperative due to top management 
attitudes to HR/D being a critical foundation for successful HR/D initiatives (Guest and Bos -Nehles, 
2013; Chadwick, Super, and Kwon, 2015).  
 
We propose that a key mechanism to enhance trust between HR/D professionals and top 
management is evidence based HR/D practice including HR/D data analytics. The use of HR metrics 
is identified as critical for establishing HR function credibility (Aldrich et al., 2015; Lawler and 
Boudreau, 2012, Marler and Boudreau, 2017). However, there is limited sophisticated empirical 
evidence (Marler and Boudreau, 2017). Further still, available research illustrates little strategic use 
of evidence based HR and HR anal ytics (Rasmussen and Ulrich, 2015; Gubbins, Harney and van der 
Werff, 2018; Lawler and Boudreau, 2015).  
 
Furthermore, in terms of enhancing trust in HR/D professionals, a data informed narrative is argued 
to directly impact perceptions of a HR practitioner’s professionalism and conscientiousness 
(Rousseau and Barends, 2011). These qualities have clear paralle ls with the sub facets of 
trustworthiness - ability, benevolence and integrity. However, HR analytics in the absence of an 
evidence based decision making approach may actually undermine trust in HR/D professional’s 
ability to contribute at strategic level. This failure to effectively use measures is usually attributed to 
the fact that those receiving the information lack the cognitive frameworks to make sense of the 
information (such as understanding how an engagement score or a turnover rate connects to 
business success) (Lawler and Boudreau, 2015) or lack the type of analytic and data based decision -
making capability needed to influence business strategy (Lawler, Levenson and Boudreau, 2004). 
While HR analytics may offer an opportunity to demonstrate a part icular aspect of ability, without a 
clear connection to organizational strategy it may actually undermine perceptions of ability to 
contribute at a strategic level. Moreover in this format, it almost certainly lacks the potential for 
demonstrating the alig nment of goals and values necessary to build perceptions of benevolence 
and integrity. In contrast, evidence based practice offers a more comprehensive opportunity to 
demonstrate ability along with benevolence and integrity by using data and analytics to a sk a valid 
question of importance to the business strategy and aggregate that data to answer that question 
and contribute towards organizational level goals.  
 
Thus we propose empirical investigation into if evidence based HR/D practice is a mechanism to 
enhance trust in HR/D professionals and confidence in HR/D decision making. We use an 
experimental design using experimental vignettes. This is an established re search method in 
psychology and HR research. It involves designing ideal and hypothetical scenarios whereby 
respondents are asked to make choices based on the information provided. Assignment to 
experimental conditions is randomized enabling researchers to  make causal inferences that are not 
feasible in observational studies. Experiments alleviate issues with construct clarity, in this instance 
enabling us to provide a direct assessment of the impact of evidence (Di Stefano and Gutierrez 
2019). Responses ar e aggregated to gain an assessment of the presented conditions. Experiments

394 
are appropriate for the research in question as they get to the basis of micro -level decision making.  
The sample consists of 1000 participants across 2 experiments involving 500 participants each. Data 
is collected using a survey administered using Qualtr ics and data will be collected through 
Prolific.co. The experiments investigate four hypotheses designed to assess the impact of HR’s track 
record and HR decision making style on manager trust in HR and confidence in HR decisions.

ID:178  - How does incidental learning manifest during times of uncertainty 
and complexity?  
Henriette Lundgren, Karen E. Watkins, Victoria J. Marsick, Dimitrios 
Papanagnou  & Urvashi Vaid  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The purpose of this paper is to explore how incidental learning manifests during times of 
uncertainty and complexity. We argue that the nature and focus of workplace learning has been 
transformed over the years due to changes in how people work and learn. Inci dental learning has 
advanced to the center of success, and organizations that embrace incidental learning gain 
competitive advantage as complexity reigns. We use Marsick & Watkins’ (1991) conceptualization of 
incidental learning as a starting point that we  complement with findings from empirical studies on 
learning amidst complexity. We combine inductive and deductive data analysis of our own empirical 
data that we collected in the form of critical incident technique interviews with 12 attending 
physicians at a US academic hospital. We present our findings and discuss how HRD practitioners 
need to develop strategies to support incidental learners in times of uncertainty and complexity.

ID:182  - The Role of Technology in Enhancing Employee Competencies through 
Human Resource Development (HRD) Interventions in the Digital Era  
Sunduz Yilmaz  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This comprehensive literature review examines the significant role of emerging technologies such 
as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), the 
Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud -based HR systems in th e employee competency development 
within organizations. This literature review aims to meticulously investigate how these innovative 
technologies enhance various aspects of employee competencies, including cognitive (problem -
solving and decision -making ski lls), functional (job -specific skills), meta (learning and adaptability 
skills), and social competencies (interpersonal and communication skills) through Human Resource 
Development (HRD) interventions. Drawing on a rich array of prestigious peer -reviewed j ournals 
(Advances in Developing Human Resources, Human Resource Development International, Human 
Resource Development Quarterly, Human Resource Development Review) in the HRD field, the 
review presents a detailed synthesis of the current research findings,  offering insightful 
perspectives on how these cutting -edge technologies are reshaping workplace learning, training, 
and development practices. The findings assert that such kind of technologies may play a huge role 
in the accumulation of skills within var ious fields. For example, while AI and VR are important to 
enhance the improvement of coaching and expertise, interactive platforms such as massive open 
online courses (MOOCs) and IoT may have a primary role in reducing the cost of employee training 
and th ey are also providing alternative learning opportunities. This review also explores the 
challenges and potential barriers in incorporating these technologies into traditional HRD practices, 
including issues related to cost, obsolescence of some previously valuable skills, different adoption 
levels of technologies, and resistance to the use of these kinds of technologies. Furthermore, this 
study examines the benefits of applying these technologies to HRD practices such as offering a wide 
range of learning op portunities for employees. The review contributes to the current literature by 
identifying existing gaps in the literature and suggesting avenues for future research.  Overall, this 
review serves as a crucial resource for HR professionals, organizational l eaders, and researchers, 
providing them with a nuanced understanding of the role of advanced technologies in enhancing 
employee competencies and for driving organizational success in the digital age.

ID:183  - The role of informal learning in middle -aged workers’ adaptive 
performance  
Eun-Jee Kim  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s Importance and Theoretical Base  
Aging workforce has received increasing attention from organizations as they encounter a growing 
shortage of more experienced workers who can be assets to survive in a competitive environment 
(Axelrad et al., 2017; Boveda & Metz, 2016). It is crucial for o rganizations to understand how to 
respond to middle -aged workers’ needs of transition and development. However, middle -aged 
workers have been largely left out of appropriate career guidance and support from their 
organizations due to the reduced investment  in training and development. Recently, to uphold 
organizational sustainability, the critical needs for middle -aged workers’ career development and 
advancement have regained great interest from both scholars and practitioners (Kooij et al., 2020; 
Van Dijk,  2004). Despite the needs, the limited existent research has generated rather diverse but 
ineffective interventions for middle -aged workers’ career, which are often broad and difficult to 
operationalize in practice (Creed et al., 2009; Zanjari et al., 2016 ). Therefore, to advance research 
and practice, this study presents empirical evidence conducive to better understand middle -aged 
workers’ career and aging at work by examining their informal learning mechanisms. Situated in the 
turbulent business environm ent, how middle -aged workers cope with the changes and strive to 
advance their career and performance will be examined. In order to examine the relationships 
among the study variables, the job demands -resources model (Bakker & Demerouti, 2007) will be 
adop ted as a theoretical framework to discuss the findings.  
 
Research Purpose and Significance  
This study aims to investigate the role of informal learning in the relationship between middle -aged 
workers’ career resilience and adaptive performance. It also intends to provide insights on how to 
develop middle -aged workers’ adaptability to guide futur e studies on adaptive performance in HRD 
research and practice. It holds significance in HRD for two main reasons: (a) identifying the 
relationship between middle -aged workers’ informal learning and adaptive performance, and (b) 
presenting empirical findin gs for both researchers and practitioners to better understand middle -
aged workers’ career resilience and adaptability.  
 
Research Questions  
1. What are the relationships between middle -aged workers’ informal learning, career 
resilience, and adaptive performance?  
2. Does the informal learning mediate the relationship between middle -aged workers’ career 
resilience and adaptive performance?  
  
Methodology   
The sample for this study was drawn from three IT and manufacturing organizations which recently 
experienced changes in their organizations. A targeted -sampling strategy was employed to identify 
samples of middle -aged workers who have experienced career ch anges based on various industries 
and company sizes. Data for the study was analyzed using structural equation modeling.  
   
Implications for HRD Practice   
By gaining a better understanding of the role of informal learning in middle -aged workers’ career 
resilience and adaptive performance, HRD practitioners can design and implement effective 
support systems and policies to better support aging workforce at th eir organizations.

ID:197  - Learning Organization Culture as a Mediator in the Relationship 
Between Psychological Safety and Knowledge Sharing  
Shinhee Park  & Seung -hyun Han  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
This study delves into the relationship between psychological safety and knowledge sharing, 
exploring how a learning organization's environment can bolster continued learning and knowledge 
sharing among its members. In today's multifaceted and dynamic comm ercial landscape, the ability 
to effectively manage and share knowledge has been identified as a critical behavior that can 
increase an organization’s competitiveness since no single individual possesses all the knowledge 
that is necessary for success in t oday’s complex and rapidly changing business environment (Han et 
al., 2022). In order to sustain competitiveness, organizations must adeptly cultivate, acquire, 
develop, share, and apply knowledge in an effective and efficient manner (Lemon & Sahota, 2004) . 
The creation of a systemic learning culture in organizations becomes an optimal source for 
acquiring these skills (Senge, 1990; Watkins & Marsick, 1993). Gavin and Edmondson (2008) posited 
that building a learning organization through certain learning -related behaviors and competencies 
that other organizations cannot easily imitate is the only way to increase organizational 
sustainability. In order to facilitate learning and knowledge sharing within organizations, it is 
essential to create opportunities f or members within the organization to learn from members of the 
organization (Ulrich et al., 1993). This process requires providing opportunities for individuals to 
learn from each other and to cultivate a desire for learning within the organization.  
Despite the recognized importance of knowledge management and sharing in organizations, 
corporate entities grapple with the volatility and intricacies of the business milieu. One of the 
primary challenges is the uncertainty and complexity of the current bu siness environment. With the 
rise of globalization, technological advancements, and increased competition, organizations are 
facing unprecedented levels of uncertainty and complexity. In this context, it becomes difficult to 
identify and acquire the necess ary knowledge to succeed. Moreover, sharing knowledge and 
information within an organization is not always straightforward. In many cases, individuals may be 
reluctant to share their knowledge and expertise because they either perceive their knowledge as a  
source of personal power or fear that sharing their knowledge will lead to a loss of job security or 
status (Cabrera & Cabrera, 2002). Additionally, the workplace may maintain an inappropriate 
reward system or inadequate recognition for knowledge -sharing efforts, which can discourage 
employees from sharing their knowledge. All of these factors contribute to situations in which 
knowledge sharing at the organizational level remains a challenge.  
 
In our hyperconnected reality, employees’ psychological comfort, buttressed by organizational 
cultures of risk -taking and mutual respect, is crucial (Joo, 2020). Such a process involves the creation 
of an environment, procedures, and behavior that support the acquisition, creation, and sharing of 
new knowledge by employees. In order to achieve this sharing, organizations need to foster a 
learning culture that encourages and supports the ongoing acquisition of new knowledge and skills 
by its members (Garvin et al., 2008). Thus, this study posits that psychological safety significantly 
influences the emergence of a learning organization culture, which, in turn, catalyzes knowledge 
sharing.  
 
Based on the research framework, this study was conducted using the knowledge management 
community of Chaebol companies in South Korea. We employed structural equation modeling using 
AMOS 28 to assess the hypothesized model. The theoretical and practical i mplications of this study 
are as follows. This study explores a positive and significant effect of psychological safety on the 
formation of learning organization culture and a positive direct effect of learning organization

400 
culture on knowledge sharing that results in learning organization culture as a mediator. This study 
argues that organizations create psychologically safe environments by supporting conversation and 
inquiry activities and providing individuals with opportu nities for learning, which leads to knowledge 
sharing among organizational members. Organizational leaders and managers should foster a 
stable psychological environment in which employees can ask questions and try to get answers 
rather than focusing on the  financial rewards as a motivating method to encourage knowledge 
sharing.

ID:210  -The meaning of the relationships between new technologies, 
metawork and professional development in nursing  
Regina H. Mulder, Theresa Hartl, Tai Nguyen  & Louisa Siemens  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Technological developments in society lead to changes at work, also in healthcare (Cascio & 
Montialegre, 2016). Such changes can lead to new, additional tasks, that are pivotal for good 
performance, but not always visible, nor recognized. About this so -called metawork (e.g., Aroles, et 
al., 2022) little is known, especially in situations of changes in work due to new technologies, nor 
about the learning activities that emerge from that. These insights are needed to be able to foster 
ongoing professional dev elopment required for current and future work. The research questions 
are: What are components of metawork in nursing in the context of changes in work tasks due to 
the introduction of new technologies? What is the meaning of the relationships between 
comp onents of metawork and professional development activities that emanate from it?  
Professional development consists of three categories of learning activities: ‘elaboration’, 
‘expansion’ and ‘externalization’ (Simons & Ruijters, 2004). Different kinds of metawork conceptions 
exist: metawork is considered as work tasks that makes the act ual work possible (Aroles et al., 
2022), or as person related components consisting of personal competences or behaviour (Müller -
Teusler, 2013). Metawork can be invisible to the external social environment (Star & Strauss, 1999), 
and be not recognized (Hat ton, 2017).  
 
This explorative interview study among nurses confronted with new technologies (e.g., patient 
management software system), uses the Interview To The Double Technique (Nicolini, 2009) for 
investigating the components of metawork, and the Critical Incident T echnique (Flanagan, 1954) to 
discover emanating learning activities. An interview guideline was developed and tested and then 
used for the data collection. We will present two cases, i.e., the work of two nurses, in detail and 
compare these in relation to the characteristics of work that have changed, the components of 
metawork that are generated, and the activities that are caused.  
Examples of the different conceptualizations of metawork are found. For example, a new, required, 
and invisible, task is ‘regularly checking and exchanging the batteries of the laptops’. A person 
related component was ‘organizing and planning capability’. Emanating learning activities are for 
instance ‘reflection on possible solutions and actions for new encountered problems’ (elaboration), 
‘asking colleagues for help’ (expansion), and ‘developing a timetable for colleagues with all the to -
do’s’ (externaliz ation). We will present two cases and use the results of the analysis and the 
comparison as a basis for the development of hypotheses that can be tested in further studies.

ID:217  - Teleological Investigation into Perceived Value of American 
University Education: Implications for HRD  
Josef Javier Ayala  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The vital role a post -secondary degree plays in finding and maintaining a family -supporting career 
in the Unites States of America has grown over the past 40 years, and with this shift has come 
sustained increases in college enrollment (Baker, 2017). Although post -secondary degrees attempt 
to fill an important gap in credentialing for the workforce, the value of the college experience is 
coming under scrutiny (Barrow & Malamud, 2015; Deller & Parr, 2020). While policy makers a nd 
parents continue to push the nation's youth to enter college, the cost of attending college is 
increasing and students are borrowing more than ever to finance the investment (Oreopoulos & 
Petronijevic, 2013). The devaluation of college is a phenomenon t hat has been cited and 
documented for a seventy -five-year period dating back from 1945 to 2020, in a period where 
education was previously acknowledged as a primary path into the Middle Class (Wingard, 2022). 
Based on an analysis of survey data from (Natio nal Center for Education Statistics, 2022), average 
loan balances for students who completed a research or professional doctorate increased between 
1999 –2000 and 2015 –16 for all degree programs for which data were available. For example, the 
average loan b alances approximately doubled for those who completed 1) medical doctorates (from 
$124,700 to $246,000, an increase of 97 percent); 2) Ph.D. degrees outside the field of education 
(from $48,400 to $98,800, an increase of 104 percent); and 3) other non -Ph.D . doctorates (from 
$64,500 to $132,200, an increase of 105 percent).  
 
The literature shows that the understanding of prospective students’ behavior in selecting a 
university program is subjectively constructed through their personal growth, career aspirations, 
and academic and financial resources (Baker, 2017). Using Collins  Theory of Credentialing, Self -
Directed Learning Theory, and Innovation Diffusion Theory the purpose of this conceptual working 
paper is to understand how people learn about the programs they apply for and the reasons for 
their decision making in selecting  the most promising program for their future. The impact of 
resources, both social and financial, as well as the marketing means utilized to sell the promise of a 
college or university program in the form of an ideation of some professional excellence to 
prospective students will also be explored and implications for HRD will be discussed.

ID:233  - Organizational Change & Its Shifting Nature: A Classical To 
Contemporary Understanding  
Mariam Martinez  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The concept of change is inherently intricate, impacting all entities, yet uniquely defined by human 
interpretation. Katz and Kahn's (1978) open system theory serves as a foundational perspective, 
emphasizing the pivotal role of roles within social structu res. Life, when understood in hindsight, 
propels the evolution of change. This paper systematically traverses from classical to contemporary 
views of change, encapsulating the essence of organizational roles, human behavior, ontological 
perspectives, parad ox, time, and becoming. While Katz and Kahn's theory, rooted in the 60s and 
70s, sheds light on social systems and roles, it reveals limitations in considering the dynamic 
interplay of human behavior and the broader environment.  
In the contemporary understanding, change is not merely an occasional disruption but a routine, 
complex, and paradoxical phenomenon. Resistance, often perceived negatively, emerges as a 
potent catalyst for change. Organizational identity extends beyond mer e attributes, embodying 
tensions and historical context. Paradoxes, inherent in the tapestry of organizational life, shape our 
actions in ways that are both contradictory and interdependent. Time, a constant presence, exerts a 
profound influence on the flu ctuating nature of change. Becoming, integral to contemporary 
perspectives, views change as pervasive, continuous, and either owned or unowned by 
organizational actors.  
 
This paper's contribution extends beyond theoretical exploration, finding practical relevance in the 
realm of organizational training and development. By offering a comprehensive understanding of 
change dynamics, it equips practitioners with invaluable ins ights into managing resistance and 
leveraging paradoxical tensions for positive transformation. The exploration of ontological 
perspectives and the temporal aspect of change further aids in developing adaptive strategies for 
continuous improvement.  
 
Organizational roles, as expounded by Katz and Kahn (1978), serve as the cornerstone in the 
classical understanding of change. Their open system theory emphasizes the interconnectedness 
between a structure and its supporting environment, attributing human effort and motivation as 
crucial for organizational maintenance. Roles, norms, and values are identified as the interrelated 
bases for the integration of organizations. However, this classical model, developed in the late 60s 
and 70s, offers limited insights into the intricacies o f human behavior and environmental 
influences.  
 
Moving to a contemporary lens, change is no longer perceived as an occasional disruption but as an 
inherent part of routine organizational processes. Amburgey et al. (1993) posit that most 
organizational changes result from stable, routine processes that a lign with environmental 
demands. Change, therefore, is not a sporadic event but an ongoing, complex, and 
multidimensional process deeply interwoven into the fabric of organizational life. The negative 
connotation attached to resistance is challenged, recog nizing it as a silent force essential for 
change. This multidimensional perspective embraces the coexistence of seemingly contradictory 
elements within the spectrum of change.  
 
Organizational identity emerges as a critical element in the contemporary understanding of change. 
Beyond a mere listing of attributes, organizational identity is experienced as a set of ongoing 
tensions. The COVID -19 pandemic provides a pertinent example,  forcing organizations to reevaluate

405 
their identities, challenging preconceived notions, and prompting adaptability. Kreiner et al. (2015) 
emphasize that organizational identity is contextual, historical, embodied, and temporal, 
necessitating a nuanced approach to organizational change.  
 
Paradoxes, as integral components of organizational life, play a pivotal role in shaping our 
worldview and actions. Hahn et al. (2021) assert that organizational life is besieged with paradoxical 
tensions, and contradictory yet interdependent demands that persist over time. This paradoxical 
nature of change is reflected in actions such as saving money by spending it or seeking stability 
within dynamic environments. The quantum approach proposed by Hahn and Knight (2021) views 
the ontology of paradox as para doxical itself, highlighting the complex and multifaceted nature of 
change.  
 
Time, an ever -present dimension, is often overlooked in the understanding of change. Lord et al. 
(2015) argue that individual and organizational behavior fluctuates rapidly and unpredictably with 
time, urging us to recognize the contextual nature of change . Shipp and Jansen (2021) emphasize 
that there is no single moment where time stops; instead, change unfolds and transforms within 
the continuum of time. This temporal perspective is crucial for acknowledging the evolving nature of 
organizational processes  and behaviors.  
 
Becoming, a concluding element in the contemporary understanding of organizational change, 
encapsulates the idea of change as pervasive and continuous. Tsoukas and Chia (2002) assert that 
organizational becoming involves reweaving an actor's beliefs, habit s, and actions to accommodate 
new experiences obtained through interactions. Change, from this perspective, is inherent in 
human action, and organizations are sites of continuously evolving human dynamics. The 
introduction of owned and unowned change furth er underscores the paradoxical nature of 
organizational change, acknowledging the coexistence of agency, choice, and environmental forces.  
In summary, this paper bridges the gap between classical and contemporary views of organizational 
change. It not only illuminates the foundational concepts of organizational roles and open system 
theory but also delves into the multifaceted, dynamic nature  of change in contemporary 
organizational landscapes. The practical implications for organizational training and development 
lie in understanding and navigating the complexities of human behavior, embracing paradoxes, 
acknowledging the temporal dimension o f change, and fostering adaptability in the face of routine 
transformations. As organizations grapple with unprecedented challenges, this comprehensive 
understanding provides a valuable roadmap for navigating the ever -evolving terrain of change. 
Future res earch, focusing on the impact of COVID -19, technological advancements, and 
globalization, holds the potential to further enrich our understanding of change dynamics. The 
elusive nature of change persists, urging continuous efforts to make sense of its esse nce in 
organizational contexts.

ID:236  - How managers make sense of value creation and contribute to it: a 
synthesis from the public services management literature  
Ally Memon  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The paper carries out a synthesis of the literature and  evidence specific to the public services 
management and HRD disciplines with reference to how managers make sense of value creation in 
public services and contribute to it.  
 
The aim is to review and examine the evidence on how value in public service delivery can be better 
understood and theorised from the viewpoint of managers. This is a worthwhile endeavour because 
ideas surrounding value creation (i.e., as positioned in the  HRD and Public Management literatures) 
can be challenging to interpret and/or translate into practice. For this reason, ‘value creation’ as a 
concept and its application seldom attract the attention of public service managers as practitioners.  
The paper carries out a review of debates and evidence surrounding the topic.

ID:239  - AI and Human Resources Management : Practices and Questions  
Françoise C hevalier  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently been adopted in human resources (HR). What does this mean 
in concrete terms? What AI practices have been developed in the HR function? And what are the 
related risks? This paper, prepared on the basis of qualitative interview s with HR directors at large 
corporations, sheds light on the various ways in which AI is transforming HR (administrative aspects, 
recruitment, training, motivation, etc.). It has become clear that these practices must be examined 
critically, with referenc e to the issues of HR data, the risk of gadgetization, and the transformation 
of innovation.

ID:19  - Realising the Potential of Drama -Based Techniques for Workplace 
Learning in the Hospitality Industry  
Miriam Witts, Professor Una McMahon -Beattie, Dr Lisa Fitzpatrick  & Professor 
Martin McCracken  
 
ABSTRACT  
“The techniques of the theater are the techniques of communicating.”  
Viola Spolin (1999).  
 
Importance of research  
Training in the hotel industry is facing an existential crisis (Tews et al., 2020). The delivery and 
impact of training does not match its perceived importance and employees do not have sufficient 
interactive skills to maximise the relationship between the mselves and guests (Nikadimovs and 
Ivanchenko, 2020).  
 
Literature suggests these interactive, or “soft” skills are learnable (Dhyani et al., 2020; Secchi et al., 
2020). This research examines using drama in workplace training to deliver these interactive skills to 
front -of-house employees in hotels.  
Comparisons between hospitality and theatre are pervasive (Gibbs and Ritchie, 2010; Ngcobo et al., 
2022), however the concept remains inadequately explored in terms of using drama -based 
techniques to answer such questions as,  
“What kind of training interventions should be initiated by hospitality firms to develop [interactive] 
competencies in their staff?” (Bharwani and Jauhari, 2013)  
 
Theoretical Basis  
This research is rooted in three key theoretical areas: Training & development, hospitality, and 
drama. The former has included understanding fundamental developments within HRD, as well as 
the work of Paolo Freire, John Dewey, Jean Piaget, and David Kolb.  
Hospitality research has identified skills required in front -of-house roles, as well as current training 
praxis within the industry. It has been possible to identify a very few case studies where drama -
based techniques have been utilised in training, but e ach calls for more research in the area (Daly et 
al. 2009).  
 
Applied drama and improvisation literature has demonstrated the potential for drama being used 
outside of traditional performance contexts. Nicholson, and Prentki and Abraham have written 
extensively about the philosophy as well as the implications and pra cticalities of applied drama 
practice. Dudeck and McClure (2018) highlight the growth of improvisation in training, citing its 
accessibility and adaptability as a method.  
 
Research Purpose and Question  
This research addresses the perceived lack of interactive, or soft skills in the hotel industry.  The 
primary research aim is, to establish whether drama -based techniques are an effective tool for 
delivering interactive skills to customer -facing employees in the hotel industry. The researcher will 
be carrying out a drama -based workshop in hotels across Northern Ireland, as well as holding focus 
groups with employees to determine their engagement with the method.  
 
Implications for practice  
Whilst there is an increasing body of literature which documents scenarios where drama has been 
used effectively in training (Huffaker and West, 2005; Benjamin and Kline, 2019), it is still an under -
utilised training method. This study will assess how such  training impacts employees in Northern

409 
Irish hotels and determine the potential for making drama -based training a more widely adopted 
practice.  
 
Conclusions  
“Improvisation leads to results previously unimagined” (Rerup, 2001).  
To state that drama practice could connect the Apollo 13 space mission and hotel employees 
sounds like a bold claim, yet evidence suggests that applying drama to each situation has unlocked 
and could unlock skills to enhance employee’s interactive capabilities.

ID:127  - Unleashing Human Potential in the Digital Era: Empowering for 
Technological Advancements  
Umidakhon Narimanova  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
The 21st century is the era of technology and its advanced innovations. Today, technology is 
developing so fast that many familiar specialties may disappear or transform. In particular, the 
Covid -19 pandemic reshaped the world, by dividing it into "before"  and "after", which also 
contributed to accelerating the significance of technology. According to the report of the 
International Economic Forum, by 2025, 40% of specialists will be forced to learn new skills in order 
to keep their jobs, and another 50% wi ll have to completely retrain. With the strengthening of the 
role of education in economic development and serious changes in the interaction of factors of 
production, the importance of human capital has also increased. The future of entire spheres and 
industries depends on the training of specialists. Obtaining a diploma at a prestigious university 
after several years of study has always been considered the first and only step to a successful 
career. How modern universities meet the requirements of the cur rent market and agile to change 
is a rhetorical question. Now, with the advent of online learning platforms, in particular micro -
credentials, this traditional option is no longer the only one that unlocks an abundance of new 
opportunities. In the article, the author explores the importance of capacity building, role of modern 
education and its correlation to human capital as well as the future of universities, which may be 
under threat, as new educational trends may not only substitute, but replace them.

ID:144  -How a blended programme of learning on a management 
apprenticeship can affect the transfer of training to the learner’s job role  
Peter Greenan  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Paper’s importance  
This paper addresses an under researched perspective that work -based learning and 
apprenticeships can affect the transfer of training. Secondly, it contributes to the leadership and 
management development literature by starting to evaluate the success of apprenticeships as a 
form of management development. Finally, it offers insight int o how HEI’s can diversify their content 
and delivery portfolio to synthesise with the changing work environment.  
 
Theoretical base  
The paper provides a short factual history of VET in the UK for context. The theoretical framework is 
centred around blended learning and transfer of training.  
Blended Learning  
The hybrid mode of work is here to stay (Suravi, 2023). It follows that training and development 
should follow suite. Blended learning combines online and face -to-face instructional activities to 
create more flexible modes of education (Boelens et al, 2018 ; Stein & Graham, 2020). Blended 
learning has four key challenges which are incorporating flexibility, stimulating interaction, 
facilitating students’ learning process, and fostering an affective learning climate (Boelens et al, 
2017). This study will iden tify how the apprenticeship addresses these challenges.  
Transfer of training  
Training inputs, training outputs and conditions of transfer are the focus of training transfer 
(Baldwin & Ford, 1988). Most studies focus on training inputs. Mediating factors to trainee 
characteristics are (but not exhaustive) motivation (Ali, Tufail & Khan 2022), locus of control (Cheng 
& Ho 2001); perceived utility, (Chung, Gully, & Lovelace 2017) and self -efficacy (Na -Nan and 
Sanamthong, 2020). Design principles consider identical elements, general principles, and stimulus 
variability. Newer concepts such as behaviour modelling (Murthy et al. 2008), error management 
(Ran & Huang 2019), and utilising a realistic training  environment (Grossman and Salas 2011) are 
considered. Regarding the work environment, three sources of support have been identified as 
organisational, supervisory and peer (Hughes et al. 2020). Post training interventions of goal setting 
and relapse preve ntion (Rahyuda, Syed, &Soltani 2014) are considered along with newer work on 
implementation intentions (Friedman & Ronen, 2015 Greenan, 2023). With the impetus to date on 
trainee characteristics and work environment, the focus of this paper on design is no vel and 
needed.  
 
Research purpose  
The purpose of this study is to address the limited body of support for the effectiveness of 
management development programmes. This study will investigate whether the work -based nature 
of an apprenticeship coupled with the blended learning of the programm e has resulted in transfer 
of training to the job role of those taking part.  
 
Research question/s  
This is a qualitative study based on a level five management apprenticeship being delivered in one 
UK Higher Education Institute. Data will be collected from Learning Application Reports (LAR) 
completed by learners as part of the apprenticeship. There are three research questions as follows.  
R1. Can a HEI deliver a non -degree apprenticeship?

412 
R2. Will a blended learning programme be more compatible with the non -standard work patterns of 
many organisations?  
R3. Will an apprenticeship with its emphasis on application of learning strengthen the transfer of 
management skills to the job role?  
 
Implications for HRD practice  
Implications are dependent on data analysis and conclusions.  
 
Conclusions  
Data has not yet been analysed so conclusions are not available.

ID:84  - Virtual and Remote onboarding: A Bibliometric Review  
Roba Elbawab  
 
ABSTRACT  
 
Digital transformation is described as using of the new digital technologies to enable significant 
business improvements (Vuchkovski et al., 2023). A virtual or a remote onboarding is an example of 
the digital transformation in human resources management. Despite the growing attention in the 
development of transforming the work into the remote setting, the virtual onboarding field is still 
remarkably young, and conceptual clarity is yet to be attained. Onboarding has been identified as 
the process that help s newcomers to adjust to the social and performance aspects of their new 
tasks quickly and efficiently (Bauer, 2010).  
 
Remote onboarding and virtual onboarding are two terms that have been developed and used 
interchangeably. So far these concepts and processes have been a focus since Covid -19 has 
occurred and all companies were urged to transfer their onboarding process to  an online setting 
(Yarbrough and Salazar, 2023). In fact, companies did have a virtual onboarding while the new norm 
is having a fully remote onboarding process. This paper will delve into the organizational 
socialization theory and its inference on virtu al and remote onboarding (Van Maanen & Schein, 
1979).  
 
A bibliometric review of virtual and remote onboarding from 2010 to 2023 was conducted on 
Scopus and analyzed using the VOS viewer software package. The VOS viewer software has been 
used to construct, visualize and analyze bibliometric networks. Bibliometr ic analysis examined 67 
documents. This study aimed to analyze the research trend, global distribution, contributory 
journals and conferences in virtual and remote onboarding. This paper will also focus on the 
conceptual review of the virtual and remote on boarding. The paper will also analyze the associated 
and most common keywords.  
 
The main research questions are first, what is the total number of studies conducted on remote and 
virtual onboarding from 2010 to 2023? Second, what are the different keywords used in the studies 
to conceptualize virtual and remote onboarding? Finally, Ho w has the concept of remote and virtual 
onboarding evolved throughout the years, with the new norms of work?  
The results show an exponential growth of the topic that is still growing worldwide, without 
identifying the difference between the two concepts. This paper will fill the gap by identifying the 
difference between virtual and remote onboarding. The paper wi ll also review the development and 
evolution of the concepts from the human resources perspective. The present review will be helpful 
for academicians, practitioners, and researchers in the human resources field. The study also 
presents implications that c ould help human resources practitioners and academics while designing 
and developing virtual and remote onboarding.  
 
Implications for virtual onboarding include performing one -on-one meetings to support the 
uncertainty and doubts of newcomers (Yarbrough and Salazar, 2023). In addition to the one -on-one 
meetings, the implications for remote onboarding would include team m eetings (Vuchkovski et al., 
2023). These team meetings would help with enhancing the psychological safety of the employees 
within their corresponding remote teams. Future research points in the direction of empirically 
assessing the application of the remo te onboarding while enhancing the process of remote 
onboarding in companies which would increase the satisfaction of the newcomers in return 
increase the retention of these talents.

414 
In conclusion, the remote and virtual onboarding is a rising topic that needs more attention. The 
socialization is important in the evolution of the concept. The originality of this paper is found in 
analyzing the concept and providing a review in an area that is quite scarce.
