## Abstract

Misophonia is a sound sensitivity disorder characterized by unusually strong aversions to a specific class of sounds (e.g., eating sounds). Here we demonstrate the mental health profile in children who develop misophonia, examining depression, anxiety  and ADHD. Our participants were members of the birth cohort ALSPAC ( Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children ). We screened them for misophonia as adults, then analysed their retrospective mental health data from ages 7  to  16  years  inclusive,  reported  from  both  children  and  parents.  Data  from  their Development and Wellbeing Assessments (7-15 years) and their Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaires (9-16 years) show that our misophonia group had a  greater  likelihood  of  childhood  anxiety  disorder  and  depression  in  childhood  (but  not ADHD).  Our  data  provide  the first evidence from a large general population sample of the types of mental health co-morbidities found in children who develop misophonia.

or even non-auditory repetitive actions such as chair-rocking [3]. Misophonia symptoms have been linked to subtle organisational differences in the brain, including increased functional and structural connectivity in regions related to threat,  emotion,  and  salience  [ 4 , 5]. This suggests sounds are more prominent and emotionally salient for people with misophonia, which appears to make them more distressing to hear, and harder to ignore.

Misophonia  is  a  sound  sensitivity  disorder  in  which  certain classes of sound feel unusually unpleasant [1]. Typical triggers  include  everyday  ambient  sounds  (e.g.,  chewing, breathing) which are easily ignored by most other people, but feel highly aversive to people with misophonia (hence -forth misophonics). Encountering these sounds causes neg -ative emotions for misophonics, such as anger, disgust, or anxiety,  and  also  physiological  reflexes  such  as  increased heart  rate,  muscle  flinch,  or  feeling  of  pressure  [ 2].  The strongest triggers of misophonia are human bodily sounds such as eating sounds (e.g., chewing, crunching, slurping), but can also be non-human noises (e.g., clicking, tapping),

In the two decades since misophonia was first named and recognised [6 ], a small but rapidly-growing body of research has begun to comprehensively analyse this sound sensitivity disorder,  identifying  common  co-morbidities  (e.g.,  obses -sive  compulsive  disorder,  autism;  [ 7-9])  and  component facets  (e.g.,  emotional  symptoms  vs.  physiological  symp -toms  vs.  behavioural  symptoms;  [ 10 , 11 ]).  However,  the vast  majority  of  misophonia  studies  focus  exclusively  on adult sufferers. Early exceptions were several case-studies describing children and adolescents with misophonia who were  seeking  treatment  in  clinical  environments  [12-15]. Subsequently, our own study was the first to explore miso -phonia in randomly-sampled children who had not referred for treatment. This provided important information because, unlike children at clinics (who already show sufficient dif -ficulties for their caregivers to seek clinical support), chil -dren from randomly-sampled populations demonstrate how

misophonia  manifests  in  the  wider  community.  Here  we found that average children with misophonia 10-14 years showed significantly poorer wellbeing than their peers, in terms of their life-satisfaction, health-related quality of life, levels of anxiety, obsessive compulsive traits, autism traits, sensory  sensitivities,  and  emotion  dysregulation  [ 7 , 16]. This  work  provided  the  first  evidence  that  misophonia  in the wider childhood population brings sufficient difficulties in mental health for it to be an important target for research and clinical support.

Our earlier studies had several important limitations. In seeking a random sample of children with misophonia, we screened 150 children, but this produced a testing group of only 15 target misophonics [16 ]. Although this was suffi -cient to detect large effect sizes, a bigger sample would be needed for more fine-grained work. Second, we tested ado -lescent participants in the later stages of childhood (10-14 years),  leaving  the  period  prior  to  this  as  yet  unexplored (for community misophonics). Third, our data were based on eliciting self-reports from children, which although rela -tively successful in our previous work, might nonetheless introduce  greater  noise  than  when  testing  adults.  Indeed, this  drawback  is  a  cornerstone  of  developmental  science, but one we aim to overcome in the current study. Here, we have had access to a unique cohort of adults whose early life has been rigorously and scientifically documented as part of  the Children of the 90s Cohort of  the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; [ 17]. These 30-year-old  adults  have  been  screened  extensively  since before  birth  (as  far  back  as  in  utero)  on  a  wide  range  of topics including, importantly, mental health. In the current study we screened this cohort at the age of 28 years, iden -tifying  several  hundred participants with misophonia, and several thousand without (to serve as a comparison group). Then, using data originally gathered from these adults when they were still children, we conducted a series of analyses to ask what are the timepoints in development when children in the misophonia group diverged from their peers across a range of mental health variables.

In our study, we examined three mental health conditions in particular: anxiety disorder, depression, and attention def -icit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Our choice was based on studies of misophonia in adolescents and adults, which show not only that quality-of-life declines with increasing misophonia symptoms [16 , 18] but that depressive symptoms increase [19 , 20 ], as do rates of anxiety compared with non-misophonics [8 , 16]. Poor mental health also remains a significant predictor of misophonia even after controlling for age and sex (e.g., in anxiety-related panic disorders; [ 21]). Since these mental health conditions are known to have roots childhood (e.g., three quarters of anxiety disorders originate in childhood; [ 22]) this leads us to hypothesise that anxiety and depressive traits may already exist in young misophonics. We looked additionally at ADHD tendencies, although our hypothesis here is less clear. One study [18] found that 5% of their 575 adult misophonics had co-morbid ADHD, while a figure reported elsewhere was 12% [ 23 ]. However, we have found it hard to evaluate whether these rates differ from the population baseline (of 4.4%; [ 24 ]), due either to our  uncertainty  over  their  methodology  ([ 23] 1 ),  or  due  to their participant-selection criteria, which in one study [ 18] a priori excluded participants with primary ADD/ADHD. This method  of participant-selection initially suggests ADHD may be especially high in misophonia, since remov -ing cases of ADHD still left a prevalence similar to the population baseline. Crucially however, their recruitment took place at a misophonia clinic, where the most severe cases are likely to gather. It is therefore unclear whether ADHD would be elevated in the wider general population of people with misophonia, so we address this question here. In the  current  paper,  we  tentatively  hypothesise  that  rates  of ADHD may be higher in misophonia simply because there is  a  known  link  between ADHD and sensory sensitivities [25-28]. This prediction therefore sits alongside our similar hypotheses for elevated depression and anxiety traits.

To give further background to our study, our first measure was the Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA; [29]). It comprises a series of clinical questions to determine the probability of having different mental health conditions at  different  age-points,  including  anxiety,  depression,  and ADHD.  We  therefore  examined  data  from  this  measure, completed by parents between 1998 and 2007 (when chil -dren were 7-15 years old). By evaluating scores at different ages, we can provide a valuable 'quasi real-time' simulation of how and when different mental health conditions emerge for  children  in  our  misophonia  and  comparison  groups. In addition, we also compare our two groups on a further measure for depressive traits (the short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire , sMFQ;  [ 30 ]),  administered  to  both  chil -dren and parents from the age of 9/10 to 16 years. Across all  measures, we predict that participants in the misopho -nia group will show an increased risk of anxiety disorder,

1 The prevalence of ADD/ADHD cited in this study is 12%, though we are  unclear  whether  it  applies  to  (i)  12%  of  their  entire  sample of  301  misophonics  (ii)  12%  of  the  150  misophonics  who  reported a co-morbidity, or indeed (iii) ADHD in both misophonics and their wider family, or just misophonics alone. Their report reads as follows: 'We asked [our 301] participants if they had been diagnosed with other conditions… We also inquired about the presence of neurological, psy -chological, or psychiatric conditions in their family members. A total of 151 (50%) participants reported no other conditions or diagnoses. From the list of conditions, the most commonly reported items were tinnitus (12%), PTSD (12%), and ADD/ADHD (12%)' (p. 18). Hence, although this earlier study plays an important role in raising the question of ADD/ADHD in misophonia, we hope to contribute further data in the current study.

depression and possibly ADHD in childhood compared to their peers, and that this is likely to become apparent at least by adolescence. Importantly, our retrospective study cannot identify whether these mental health symptoms are elevated in children who already had misophonia at that age, since misophonia tests were not administered to ALSPAC children  (and  indeed  the  condition  was  yet  to  be  recognised for another decade). Instead however, our study can tell us whether mental health symptoms are elevated in children who go on to report misophonia as adults - who therefore either  manifested  it  as  children,  or  went  on  to  develop  it subsequently.

Our  participants  were  drawn  from  the Avon  Longitudinal Study of  Parents  and  Children ( ALSPAC )  a  British  longitudinal  cohort  with  a  wealth  of  psychological,  genetic, educational  and  health  data  spanning  three  decades  [17 , 31 , 32 ].  Pregnant women who were resident in Avon, UK with expected dates of delivery from 1st April 1991 to 31st

December 1992 were invited to take part in the study. The initial number of pregnancies enrolled was 14,541, with an additional  913  eligible  pregnancies  added  retrospectively in subsequent waves. These 15,454 pregnancies resulted in 15,589 foetuses,  of  which  14,901  were  alive  at  1  year  of age. In the current study we screened for misophonia almost three  decades  later  in  Dec  2020-  Feb  2021  as  part  of  the 'Life at 28 + ' wave of data collection, in over 4000 of the active remaining respondents from the index cohort (known as the 'Children of the 90s Cohort'). Our participants with returned data were 4253 adults aged 28, comprising 1452 males-at-birth (mean age in months 345.81; SD 5.94), 2798 female-at-birth (mean age in months 345.49; SD 6.04) and 3 with no information about sex-at-birth (mean age in months 338.67; SD 4.51). The outcome of our screening for miso -phonia (see Materials for  screener)  shows  that  this  group contained  333  adults  with  misophonia  (77  male  and  256 female)  and  3920  without  misophonia  (1375  male,  2542 female, 3 unknown). We refer to these as misophonics versus non-misophonics respectively (or misophonics vs. the com -parison group). Of these individuals, Tables 1 and 2 show how many of these participants also had childhood data for our  measures  of  interest. Table  1 shows  the  final  number of participants in our DAWBA analyses (for ADHD, anxi -ety,  depression),  split  by  timepoints  between  7-15  years. Table 2 shows the final participants for our sMFQ analyses for depression, again split by timepoint, but also by which -ever person completed the questionnaire (child completed 10-16 years; parent completed 9-16 years).

Ethical  Approval for the study  was  obtained  from  the ALSPAC  Ethics  and  Law  Committee  and  the Local Research Ethics Committees. Informed consent for the use of data collected via questionnaires and clinics was obtained from  participants  following  the  recommendations  of  the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee at the time.

## Materials

The  Development  and  Wellbeing  Assessment  (DAWBA; [29]). This parent-completed questionnaire poses a series of clinically-based questions about the child, relating to symp -toms indicative of mental health conditions. Parents completed this questionnaire at multiple timepoints, specifically when their child was 7, 10, 13 and 15 years. The DAWBA score  indicates  the  likelihood  of  being  diagnosed  with  a series of mental health conditions based on the criteria of the International  Classification  of  Diseases-10 (ICD-10)  and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition (DSM-IV). Our hypotheses led us to consider three mental health conditions, which were available across

all  four  time  points: ADHD,  depression,  and  anxiety  dis -order. For ADHD, there were 22 items, which began with a  yes/no question ( Over the last 6 months… do you think your child definitely has some problems with overactivity of poor concentration? )  followed by 21 items on a response scale running from 0 to 2 (e.g., Have their teachers com -plained over the last 6 months of problems with poor con -centration or being easily distracted? No, or doesn't apply; A little; A lot ).  For depression, there were 17 items, com -prising 12 yes/no questions (e.g., In the last 4 weeks, have there been times when your child has been very sad, miser -able, unhappy or tearful? ), as well as two items on a 3-point scale (e.g., When your child has been miserable, could they be cheered up? Easily; With difficulty/ only briefly; Not at all ) and three items on a 2-point scale (e.g., Over the last 4 weeks, the period of being really miserable has lasted less than 2 weeks; 2 weeks or more? ). Finally, the DAWBA also indicated  the  likelihood  of  clinical  diagnosis  for  anxiety disorder. This comprised a package of interviews identifying one or more anxiety disorder from among generalised

1

anxiety disorder, social phobia, separation anxiety, PTSD, OCD, and specific phobias (e.g., Over the last 6 months has your child worried excessively on more days than not? ). The full  list  of  items  and  scoring  is  described  in  detail  for  all conditions  at  https://www.dawba.info/py/dawbainfo/b4.py (see also[ 29 , 33 , 34] ).

The DAWBA is a widely-accepted measure described in over 400 publications, and is well validated in both clinical [35] and epidemiological studies [34 ]. For example, it shows excellent  discrimination  between  clinic  and  community samples in rates of diagnosed disorders [29] and substantial agreement between DAWBA and case note diagnoses. It has been translated into at least 20 languages ( https://www. dawba.info/py/dawbainfo/b4.py ), and  has  been  used  by national statistics agencies to survey nationwide child psychiatric  morbidities  (e.g.,  the  UK  National  Statistics;  [ 33 , 36]). In our own sample we examined test-restest reliability, finding a 'good' intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of  0.85  for  ADHD,  a  'moderate'  ICC  for  anxiety  (0.59) although poorer for depression (0.38; [ 37 ]).  However, our test-retest period was exceptionally long, spanning almost a decade from 7 to 16 years, whereas the ICC is most often applied  to  test-retest  conducted  over  substantially  shorter intervals [37].

The  Short  Mood  and  Feelings  Questionnaire  (sMFQ) . This 13-item measure probes depression symptoms over the two weeks prior to testing (e.g., In the past two weeks… felt miserable or unhappy? ). Responses are given a 3-point Likert scale from Not at all (scored 0), Sometimes true (scored 1) or True (scored 2), and the test is scored out of 26 with higher  scores  representing  more  depressive  traits.  There were both child- and parent-completed versions of the test. Parents  completed  this  questionnaire  when  their  children were  9,11,13  and  16  years,  and  the  equivalent  childhood span  for  the  child/self-completed  version  was  10,  12,  13 and 16 years. The sMFQ is a validated measure of cognitive and  affective  depressive  symptomology,  and  can  success -fully discriminate clinically depressed from general population samples in children 8-16 years [37 ],  and depressed from non-depressed children within the general population (where  depression  was  independently  identified  with  the Diagnostic Interview Schedule depression scale; [ 38]) . We 2 measured test-retest reliability in our sample and found an ICC of 0.66 for child-completed sMFQ, and an ICC of 0.75 for parent-completed sMFQ, being 'moderate' and 'moder -ate-to-good' respectively [ 39].

2 Child-completed sMFQ continued into adulthood though our interest is childhood development, so our age ranges were 9, 11, 13 and 16 years (parent-completed) and 10, 12, 13 and 16 years (child-com -pleted). For evidence on depression and anxiety in adult misophonia we point the reader to the extensive literature (for review see [16]).

Sussex Screener for Misophonia (SSfM) .  We developed and  administered  this  written  screener  as  a  measure  for adult misophonia. The SSfM provided examples of known misophonia triggers ( eating  noises ; throat  clearing ; nasal noises ; etc.) as well as a characterisation of misophonia to which participants agreed or disagreed (i.e., When sounds (e.g., crunching) consistently cause extreme emotions, like anger, disgust or anxiety ). For those agreeing with misophonia, our screener contained further items probing its severity in disrupting daily life ( not at all , very mildly , moderately , severely , very  severely )  and  additional  questions  for  consideration  elsewhere,  such  as  whether  the  participant  had sought clinical support for their misophonia, and when they believe it developed ( early school [up to 11] ; later school [11 to 18] , adulthood [18 + years] ). Misophonics were classified as those agreeing with our characterisation of miso -phonia,  but  also  rejecting  'not  at  all'  for  its  detriment  to daily life (i.e., misophonia must disrupt daily life for partici -pants in our misophonia group, at least to some degree). The remainder (i.e., those without any detrimental misophonia) formed our comparison group.

To have confidence that our screener corrected identifies people  with  misophonia,  we  first  confirmed  it  converges with multiple lines of evidence for misophonia. Here, we compared it to evidence gathered from assessments administered to the same cohort, including a clinic audiology visit carried out when the cohort were 11 years old [40]. Although misophonia had not been classified or even named at the time of this earlier clinic, there are clear indicators we can use. For example, adults identified with misophonia using our screener were twice as likely than the comparison group to report a sound sensitivity in the clinic assessment at age 11 years (i.e., 'Do you ever experience over-sensitivity or distress to particular sounds?'; 6.5% misophonics vs. 3.5% non-misophonics, χ 2 (1) = 4.93, p = .026).  They  were  also more than twice as likely to be wearing ear defenders at age 11 to protect themselves from aversive sounds compared to their peers (12.5% vs. 5.05%). Although numbers here were too small to test this statistically (since only 16 misophonics were given this latter question 3 ), we can also see evidence of misophonia in other converging traits. Hence, our miso -phonia group were significantly more likely to dislike eat -ing in the presence of others at age 13 (remembering that the very strongest triggers of misophonia are other people's eating sounds). Here, 5.10% of misophonics disliked eating

3 This n is small because this question appeared in a pipeline within conditional logic, where it was not asked unless earlier questions had been asked and answered in a certain way (i.e., children were asked questions about whether they were over-sensitive to sounds, and only those who replied yes were asked further about ear defenders). However, we include this descriptive statistic for transparency so that every measure  we  inspected  is  reported  here,  even  where  small  numbers meant we did not and could not achieve significance.

with others a little or a lot compared to only 2.80% of the comparison group (Fishers exact p = .024). At age 25, miso -phonics were still significantly less likely to eat with others, and instead spent significantly more time than the compari -son group eating alone. For example, 13.82% of misophon -ics  ate  alone  5 + times  during  the  last  week,  compared  to only  10.81%  of  the  comparison  group.  This  difference  is significant  (i.e.,  using  the  response-scale  running  from  0 [i.e., never eating alone] to 4 [i.e., 7 + times eating alone], misophonics had a mean of M = 1.42, SD = 1.24; compared to non-misophonics M = 1.16, SD = 1.16;  (254.75) t = -3.29, p = .002,  Cohen's d = 0.23).  At  the  same  age,  misophon -ics  were  also  significantly  more  likely  to  use  sound-dis -tractions at the dinner table (e.g., television playing whilst eating)  compared  with  non-misophonics  (i.e.,  mean  days without distraction was 1.00 days per week for misophonics  [SD  1.18]  vs.  1.18  for  non-misophonics,  SD = 1.20; t (261.97) = 2.13, p = .034, Cohen's d = 0.15). Finally, at age 25,  people  classified  by  our  screener  as  misophonic  were also overwhelmingly more likely to indicate typical interpersonal  difficulties  expected  from  misophonia  (e.g.,  'In last  6  months  compared  to  people  of  the  same  age,  I  am easily annoyed by others'); i.e., 71.93% misophonics indi -cated  somewhat or  certainly  true  compared  to  49.52%  of non-misophonics (with respective means on the full scale scored 0-2 [ not true , somewhat true , certainly true ] as follows: M = 0.94,  SD = 0.71;  M = 0.57,  SD = 0.63; t (174.04) = -6.01, p &lt; .001, Cohens d = 0.58). Finally, we also selected a  feature  to  examine  for divergent validity,  i.e.,  a  feature expected to show no difference for misophonics and nonmisophonics. As expected from the literature [16 ], we found that  our  misophonia  screener  was  entirely  non-predictive of creative  self-concept ,  a  well-studied  self-assessment  of one's  own  creative  ability  [ 41 , 42]  which  correlates  with direct  measurements  of  creativity,  but  is  known  to  show no  difference  between  misophonics  and  non-misophonics [16 ]. Hence, using an almost identical question to previous misophonia literature  ('How  good  are  you  at  art?';  rated from not good at all to very good ) we found that the creative self-concept of misophonics (M = 3.67, SD = 1.18) was no different  to  the  comparison  group  (M = 3.57,  SD = 1.08; t (289.23) = 1.23, p = .220,  Cohen's d = 0.09),  thereby  pro -viding divergent validity for our measure of misophonia.

In summary, our screener has both convergent and diver -gent validity, since participants identified as having miso -phonia  were  significantly  more  likely  to  have  reported  a sound sensitivity at age 11, were significantly more likely to avoid eating near others by parental report at 13, and again by self-report at age 25, and were significantly more likely to use sound-distractions while eating (e.g., tv playing). They were also more likely to have been annoyed by others in the 6 months previously, and they explicitly endorsed a careful

description of misophonia at the age of 28, while agreeing that it impacted their lives. Finally, as expected, they were no different to the comparison group in their creative selfconcept. This ample convergent and divergent validity for our measure leads us to conclude that our screener successfully detects adults with misophonia.

## Procedure

Our SSfM (misophonia screener) was administered as part of ALSPAC's 'Life at 28 + ' wave of data collection. Partici -pants completed the screener online in digital form, with a pencil-and-paper version made available where requested. The  screener  took  approximately  5-minutes  to  complete. These  data  were  collected  and  managed  by  the ALSPAC team using Redcap, a secure web-based software platform hosted at the University of Bristol, designed to support data capture for research studies [43]. We subsequently accessed our data, alongside existing data from the DAWBA and the sMFQ, which were shared from ALSPAC's back-catalogue of data from the 1990-2000 s. ALSPAC's fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool can be found online at http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data.

Analytic Plan . We examined longitudinal data from the DAWBA (i.e.,  probability  of  meeting  the  diagnostic  cri -teria for ADHD, anxiety disorder and depression) and the sMFQ (symptoms of depression). The DAWBA has an ordi -nal scale with unequal distances between scale points (e.g., 1 =&lt; 0.1% probability of diagnosis, 2 =~ 0.5% probability of  diagnosis,  3 =~ 3%  probability  of  diagnosis  etc.).  We therefore  applied  a  non-parametric  test  using  the nparLD package in R [44 ]  which produces ANOVA-type statistics (and also Wald-type statistics, which held the same interpre -tation for all our results). We present our ANOVA statistics below,  henceforth  referred  to  as  non-parametric ANOVA. Our  models  examine  differences  between  groups  (miso -phonics  vs.  non-misophonics)  across  four  timepoints  (7, 10,  13  and  15  years),  for  three  different  diagnoses  (anxi -ety disorder, ADHD, depression). Hence we perform three separate analyses, with the outcome being diagnosis likeli -hood of anxiety disorder, ADHD, and depression, respec -tively.  While  ADD/ADHD  symptoms  decrease  with  age and are higher in males [45 ],  both anxiety and depression increase  with  age  around  the  middle  of  adolescence,  and start to emerge more strongly in females from around age 13 [46 , 47]. These periods correspond to the upper tail of our  age  range,  so  we  therefore  additionally  added  sex-atbirth as a predictor (which was provided in our data as male/ female). We remind the reader that effect sizes cannot be directly measured for non-parametric mixed ANOVAs [ 48]. Although some mental health domains also have sub-conditions  (e.g.,  anxiety  disorder  includes  sub-conditions  of social anxiety, separation anxiety, specific phobia etc.) we look at domain-level diagnosis. For example, we examine the likelihood of developing anxiety disorder, whether that be social anxiety, separation anxiety, or specific phobias etc. We took this approach following earlier literature e.g., [ 49] and because fine-grained analyses would be under-powered due to the relative rarity of specific sub-conditions during the period we examine (7-16 years). Finally, we use Mann Whitney Wilcoxons to explore pairwise post-hoc comparisons on ordinal data, correcting for multiple comparisons.

Scores  from  the  sMFQ  (depression  traits)  are  continu -ous but due to non-normality we also ran non-parametric ANOVA using the same framework as before. We analysed child-completed  and  parent-completed  sMFQ  scores  in separate analyses since agreement between child and parent reports can sometimes be rather low [50 , 51]. For the childcompleted model, we examined differences between groups (misophonics vs. non-misophonics) across four timepoints (10, 12, 13 and 16 years) and there were also four timepoints for our parent-competed model (9, 11, 13 and 16 years) 4 . All  analyses  were  performed  in  R  3.6.3  using  R  Studio, with the R packages tidyverse for  general data wrangling, ggplot2 for figures, nparLD for non-parametric longitudinal analyses.

## Results

## ADHD Diagnosis likelihood - DAWBA

To  remind  the  reader,  we  ran  a  non-parametric  ANOVA crossing  group  (misophonic  vs.  non-misophonic),  sex-atbirth (male vs. female), and timepoint (7, 10, 13, 15). Our statistical results are displayed in Table 3 and they show no significant  main  effect  of  group  (Misophonics  M = 0.40, SD = 0.74; Non-misophonics  M = 0.35, SD = 0.73), and no  significant  main  effect  of  time.  The  effect  of  sex-atbirth  strongly  trended  ( p = .052)  with  females  (M = 0.29, SD = 0.64) scoring lower than males (M = 0.47, SD = 0.84) - as expected from the literature [52]. There were no significant  interactions  between  any  of  our  variables.  This suggests our misophonia group were no different than the

4 Data such as ours are superficially amenable to growth model analy -ses, but our data fail to meet one important assumption of the growth curve model, which is that all individuals follow the same growth pat -tern [59]. We are likely to violate this assumption since the misophonia we detect in adults will have emerged at varying points throughout their different childhoods. This makes it less likely that all individuals will  follow  the  same  growth,  and  when this assumption is violated, fitting the growth curve model results in less power [ 59]. We therefore follow Liu and colleagues in applying an ANOVA as most appropriate to our data.

Nosophsophonic

Fig. 1 DAWBA-Anxiety scores for misophonics and non-misophonics across four timepoint (7, 10, 13, 15 years). Group and time were both significant main effects, with an interaction at the conventional threshold (see Table 4 ).  Sex-at-birth  was  also  significant  l  but  there was no interaction with group, so our figure reliably shows the pattern of results for misophonia over time

comparison group in their likelihood of an ADHD diagnosis, and had the same trajectory.

## Anxiety Diagnosis likelihood - DAWBA

We repeated our analysis (non-parametric ANOVA crossing group, sex-at-birth, and timepoint), but this time looked at

Fig.  2 DAWBA-Depression  scores  for  misophonics  and  non-misophonics across four timepoint (7, 10, 13, 15 years). Group and time did not interact, and were both significant main effects (the former just at threshold; see Table 5 ). Again, sex-at-birth was significant but there was no interaction with group, so our figure reliably shows the pattern of results for misophonia over time

the likelihood of a diagnosis of anxiety disorder. The pattern of results was rather different (see Table 4). As expected [46 ], there was a significant main effect of timepoint, sug -gesting  children  became  more  anxious  over  time  regardless of group status, and there was also a significant main effect  of  sex-at-birth,  since  females  (M = 1.73,  SD = 0.66) were more anxious than males (M = 1.62, SD = 0.61). Our data also showed a significant interaction of sex-at-birth and time, since - again as expected -- males and females show different anxiety trajectories as they age (females typically diverge from boys age 13 years; [ 46 ]). Importantly, we also found a significant main effect of group, with misophonics (M = 1.82, SD = 0.66) more anxious than non-misophonics (M = 1.68, SD = 0.64; See Fig. 1).

There  was  no  three-way  interaction  (group,  timepoint, sex-at-birth),  and  the  two-way  interaction  between  group and  time  approached  significance  at p = .052.  Given  the interest in age of onset, the two earliest timepoints at age 7 and 10 were explored with non-parametric Mann Whitney  Wilcoxon  tests.  These  showed  no  significant  differ -ence between misophonics and non-misophonics at age 7 ( W = 357,228, p = .128, r = .02), but a significant difference by the age of 10 years ( W = 327,241, p = . 001, r = .05) which survives at the corrected alpha ( α &lt; 0.025) for multiple comparison. Thus we find evidence that misophonics differ at least from the age of 10.

## Depression Diagnosis likelihood - DAWBA

Our final DAWBA scale was for depression, and again we ran a non-parametric ANOVA crossing group (misophonic vs.  non-misophonic),  sex-at-birth  (male  vs.  female)  and timepoint (7, 10, 13, 15). Our data is represented in Fig. 2 , and  our  final  model  in  Table 5 shows  a  significant  main effect of time and sex-at-birth since mental health symptoms

again worsen with age, and are higher for females (M = 0.63, SD = 0.79) than males (M = 0.49, SD = 0.69). There was no significant interaction between time and sex-at-birth, and no three-way interaction with group. In our main comparison of  group,  misophonics  scored  higher  in  their  depressionlikelihood (M = 0.67, SD = 0.86) than non-misophonics (M 0.57, SD = 0.75) but this just missed significance at a third decimal place ( p = .054). This raises the question of whether we can replicate this finding at conventional significance in our second depression measure below (i.e., the sMFQ).

## Depression Symptoms - Parent Completed sMFQ

To remind the reader, we ran a non-parametric  ANOVA look -ing  at  group  (misophonic  vs.  non-misophonic),  timepoint (9, 11, 13, 16 years), and sex-at-birth (male vs. female). Our final  model is presented in Table 6 and shows largely the same pattern of results as we saw in our previous depression measure (see DAWBA above).

As before,  there  was  a  significant  main  effect  of  time, suggesting  that  participants'  depressive  symptoms  wors -ened  with  age  regardless  of  group-status.  And  again  as before,  we  found  the  expected  main  effect  of  sex-at-birth (female M = 2.37, SD = 3.27; male M = 1.96, SD = 2.85) but additionally found a significant interaction between sex-atbirth and time, indicating a sharper trajectory for females. Importantly, we again found a main effect of misophonia, and this was highly significant, showing that misophonics

(M = 2.88,  SD = 3.67)  had  significantly  more  depressive symptoms than non-misophonics (M = 2.17, SD = 3.08; See Fig. 3). There were no two-way or three-way interactions involving group, suggesting that children in the misophonia group were already more depressed than their peers at the earliest age (i.e., by age 9) and were equally affected regard -less of their sex-at-birth.

## Depression Symptoms - Child Completed sMFQ

We repeated our analysis on the child-generated data, which this time took its timepoints at age 10, 12, 13, and 16 years. Our model presented in Table 7 shows an identical pattern of  results  as  we  found  in  parents;  i.e.,  a  significant  main effect of time and sex-at-birth (females M = 5.53; SD = 4.76; males  M = 4.37,  SD = 3.71),  with  a  significant  interaction between the two. Importantly, we again found a main effect of group, with children in our misophonic group showing greater depressive traits (M = 6.43, SD = 5.11) than our nonmisophonic group (M = 5.01, SD = 4.38; see Fig. 4).

## Discussion

Our study examined a longitudinal sample from Southern England  (ALSPAC;  [ 17])  to  test  whether  adults  with  the sound sensitivity  of  misophonia  experience  mental  health

difficulties as children. We administered a screener to our sample at the age of 28 years to identify those with misophonia, and then we examined their catalogue of back-data from  when  they  were  children.  We  looked  specifically  at three  mental  health  conditions  (ADHD,  anxiety,  depres -sion) elicited from two types of measure - the DAWBA for all three conditions, and the sMFQ for depression only. The former was completed by parents when their children were 7, 10, 13, and 15 years. The latter was completed by parents when their children were 9, 11, 13, and 16 years, and was completed by children themselves at ages 10, 12, 13, and 16. Although there was no evidence that children in the misophonia group were unduly impacted by ADHD, there was a clear picture of mental health difficulties for both depression and anxiety. For depression, our data suggest that children in  the  misophonia  group  had  significantly  higher  depres -sion symptoms in the sMFQ, and we also tested their like -lihood of a depression diagnosis using the DAWBA. The latter  showed  a  near-significant  trend  ( p = .054)  while  the former comfortably passed the conventional alpha threshold, for both adult-report and child-report, providing impor -tant  replications  from  both  parent  and  child  perspectives. Group status did not interact with other variables suggesting girls and boys with misophonia were equally affected and, crucially,  that  differences  were  apparent  even  at  the  very youngest age points -- which was ages 9 and 10 respectively for our parent- and child-completed sMFQ (and age 7 for our trending main effect in the DAWBA).

We also found further evidence of mental health difficul -ties, this time in anxiety: children in the misophonia group scored significantly  higher  than  their  peers  in  their  likeli -hood  of  an  anxiety  diagnosis  using  the  DAWBA.  In  our data, we were indifferent to the nature of the anxiety disor -der, meaning that children in the misophonia group scored higher in their likelihood of any anxiety condition whether that be social anxiety, generalised anxiety disorder, and so on  (with  girls  and  boys  in  our  misophonia  group  equally affected). Our data indicate differences emerging at a young age - either at age 7 or at age 10, with uncertainly arising since our interaction with time was detected at p = .052. A statistically conservative interpretation (rejecting the inter -action,  leaving  only  the  main  effect)  is  that  misophonics diverge at age 7. But a scientifically conservative interpretation  (accepting  the  interaction  and  exploring  with  posthoc tests) suggests a difference from age 10. Future studies might therefore further explore the time-course in the development  of  anxiety,  or  indeed  use  additional  measures  to detect anxiety in children with misophonia at yet younger ages.

In  addition  to  showing  mental  health  developments  in misophonia,  we  also  provided  convergent  and  divergent evidence for our screener[40 ]. Adults identified with miso -phonia at 28 years had exactly the profile we might expect, including the interpersonal difficulties associated with miso -phonia,  significant  early  sound  sensitivities,  and  repeated evidence  of  avoiding  communal  eating  in  childhood  and adulthood, or taking steps to mask the noise (remembering that the very strongest triggers of misophonia are other people's eating sounds; [ 3 ]). Finally, as expected, they were no different in our divergent measure (of creative self-concept; [16]). This ample convergent and divergent validity leads us to  conclude  that  our  screener  successfully  detected  adults with misophonia.

Our data provide a crucial missing link in the misophonia literature, which had pointed strongly to the possibility of  specific  mental  health  difficulties  in  childhood  prior  to adolescence, but thus far had no direct evidence aside from clinical case studies. From the adult literature we knew that misophonia is associated with elevated rates of both anxiety and depression [8 , 16 19]. This hinted strongly at childhood ,

difficulties  since  three  quarters  of  adult  anxiety  disorders, for  example,  originate  in  childhood  (e.g.,  [ 22]). We point out that misophonics also have traits co-morbid with anxiety,  such  as  greater  rates  of  autism  [ 53]  and  also  poorer well-being in adolescence [16]. All these facts suggested the possibility of specific mental health difficulties as children, which our data now support.

Our findings are important because anxiety disor -der,  for  example,  is  among  the  most  problematic  mental health disorders in children [54 ],  and early intervention is known  to  significantly  improve  life-outcomes  (e.g.,  [ 55]. Our data suggest that recognising misophonia in children should therefore routinely be interpreted as indicating risk factors  for  anxiety  and  depression.  Hence  where  children show aversions to sound (or indeed any collateral traits of misophonia shown here, such as avoiding eating with oth -ers or showing a consistent desire to introduce background noise), then this may signal an opportunity to conduct risk assessments  for  anxiety  and  depression  (e.g.,  is  the  child missing  school?  disengaged  socially?).  Using  misophonia as an indirect pointer to anxiety and depression might also be particularly important because children are less able to verbalise their poor mental health compared to adults [22]. In summary, we propose that recognising misophonia can be extrapolated to recognising the possibility of its co-morbidities in anxiety and depression, and being mindful of the negative consequences these can engender.

In  presenting  our  findings,  it  is  important  that  we  rec -ognise  not  only  our  papers'  strengths,  but  also  its  limita -tions. One strength of our paper was that we assessed the ALSPAC cohort for misophonia in 2021, when they were already adults. Doing this allowed us to identify those with and without misophonia in a relatively robust way because we can be more confident in the answers of adults than we might otherwise be had we tested for misophonia at age 7. However, one limitation from this is that we cannot be sure whether those same individuals already had misophonia at the  age  of  7,  when  we  began  our  investigation  of  mental health.  It  is  theoretically  possible  that  this  might  explain why one effect was non-significant, i.e., parental report of ADHD. However, we suggest that this absence more likely reflects our far weaker a priori hypotheses for ADHD (see Introduction ). Nonetheless, we present our study in the full understanding that misophonia may not yet have emerged in all the children who went on to present with misophonia as adults. If so, our significant findings will have emerged for one of three reasons. One interpretation is that our signifi -cance simply survived the 'noisy' environment of a group where some children may not yet have developed the misophonia  that  would  affect  them  in  later  life.  But  a  second interpretation is that the mental health difficulties we found are associated with the disposition for misophonia, whether

or not that misophonia has already emerged. A third interpretation is that misophonia emerges as a consequence of these mental health differences, and not as their cause. We are unable to answer this question with the data at hand, and suggest that such data would require large-scale screening of  a  very  large  sample  of  children  with  a  validated  diagnostic in order to detect and identify those with misophonia, to follow them in real-time. A power analysis based on our  anxiety  findings  suggests  this  would  require  n = 1034 children at 80% power, assuming misophonia is found in at least 10% of cases [16]. Since we have done similar largescale  screening  with  other  sensory  differences  (e.g.,  [ 56]) we do not under-estimate the challenges this would pose, and therefore recognise both the limitations and strengths of our own data.

A further limitation of our study is that our data suggest elevated symptoms of poor mental health but do not represent  diagnoses.  For  example,  our  DAWBA  presents  the likelihood of a mental health diagnosis from parental report, rather  than  an  actual  diagnosis  [29 ].  Similarly,  our  analy -sis of the sMFQ shows elevated traits rather than clinical diagnostic  differences.  Hence  our  results  do  not  indicate whether  children  in  the  misophonia  group  (who  certainly had poorer mental health according to parents) did in fact reach the threshold for clinical anxiety or depression at any point in their childhood. Instead, our data simply tell us that their tendency in this direction was elevated. Nonetheless, it is possible to apply caseness thresholds from the literature for our measures, and there are certainly indicators towards a meaningful clinical difference in our misophonia group. In depression, for example, a threshold of 11 in the sMFQ can be applied in line with previous research [57 , 58]. When classifying individuals about this threshold (separately for males and females),  we  found  significantly  more  females passing  the  threshold  in  our  misophonia  group  (25.18%; ns = 35  vs.  139)  compared  to  our  non-misophonia  group (16.95%; n = 274 vs. 1457, /u1D712 2 = 3.91, p = . 048), although a smaller and non-significant difference for males (misopho -nia group 10.42%, n = 5  vs. 48; vs. non-misophonia group 7.03%; n = 68 vs. 967; /u1D712 2 = 0.67, p = .42). As such, levels of depression experienced by children in our misophonia group were not only higher, but more likely to exceed diagnostic thresholds - at least for females. Our results should therefore not be considered insignificant, even if we could not reliably determine clinical diagnoses. Overall, however, the limita -tions discussed here mean our findings should be taken as preliminary data pointing to the types of mental health difficulties in children who go on to develop misophonia.

## Summary

In summary, our data show differences in the mental health of children who grow up to manifest misophonia by adulthood. As children, they showed significantly higher scores -  firstly  in  our  measures  of  depression,  with  differences emerging certainly as young as 9 years (parent-completed sMFQ) and potentially as young as 7 (at a near-significant level  using  the  DAWBA). And in anxiety, children in the misophonia  group  diverged  from  their  peers  certainly  as young as 10 (if we accept our threshold interaction) but oth -erwise from as young as 7 years. Our results bolster what is currently a relatively modest amount of science concerning childhood misophonia, and highlight a need for further research. We also suggest that any future research might be accompanied by actions to widen the public's understand -ing  of  misophonia.  To  promote  wider  understanding  in our own way, we have created an online information hub ( www.misophonia-hub.org)  as  a  one-stop  resource  containing advice and support for parents, children, educators, researchers  and  clinicians.    In  summary,  our  study  shows that misophonia can be identified in adults, and then used to retrospectively inspect the lives of those same individuals when they were children. Doing so revealed that children who  later  develop  misophonia  already  showed  important difficulties in their childhood mental health, with stronger traits in depression and anxiety compared to peers.
