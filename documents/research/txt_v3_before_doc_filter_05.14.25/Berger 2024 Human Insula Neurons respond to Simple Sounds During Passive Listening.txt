## Abstract 13

- The insula is critical for integrating sensory information from the body with that arising 14 from the environment. Although previous studies suggest that posterior insula is 15 sensitive to sounds, auditory response properties of insula neurons have not previously 16 been reported. Here, we provide the first report of a population of human single neuron 17 data from the insula and provide comparative data from the primary auditory cortex, 18 recorded intracranially from human participants during passive listening. In each 19 condition, more than 330 single neurons were recorded in 11 participants. Almost a third 20 of neurons in posterior insula and a smaller subset in anterior insula responded to 21 simple tones and clicks. Responsive neurons were distributed throughout posterior and 22 anterior insula and showed preferred frequency tuning. Onset latencies in the insula 23 were similar to those in the primary auditory cortex but response durations were 24 significantly shorter. Overall, these data highlight that insula neurons respond to 25 auditory stimuli even in non-behaviorally relevant contexts and suggest an important 26 contribution of audition to the postulated integrative functions of insular cortex. 27

## Introduction 29

- The insula, buried within the lateral fissure, is a key brain region involved in processing 30
- of interoceptive signals [1-5] which includes sensations not only from within the interior 31
- or viscera of body (e.g. cardiac, respiration, hunger) but also those arising from the skin 32
- (e.g.  pain,  temperature    and  affective  touch;  [1,  6]  for  a  review,  see  [7]).  Theoretical 33
- models of insula function suggest that these interceptive sensations form the basis for 34
- subjective feelings [8] and sense of bodily self [9]. By contrast, empirical evidence for 35
- the  role  of  insula  in  processing  of  exteroceptive  signals,  such  as  sounds  that  are 36

- external  to  the  body  and  not  associated  with  interoceptive  signals,  remains  scant, 37 although there  is  some  limited  evidence  implicating  the  insula  in  auditory  processing. 38 Case  reports  have  shown  that  damage  to  the  insula  region  can  cause  alterations  in 39 auditory perception [10-13], even without apparent damage  to auditory cortex. 40 Additionally, studies in animals [14-18], human neuroimaging using functional magnetic 41 resonance  imaging  (fMRI)  [19-22]  and  electrophysiology  [23-29],  suggest  that  activity 42 within  the  insula  may  be  modulated  by  sound,  particularly  when  it  is  emotionally 43 arousing  (e.g.  music)  or  behaviorally  relevant  (e.g.  detection  of  an  odd  tone),  while 44 recent  intracranial  local  field  potential  data  highlight  that  posterior  insula  represents 45 phonological features during both speech production and perception [30]. In 46 misophonia, a condition characterized as an intense emotional reaction to sounds of a 47 particular nature (e.g. chewing), the anterior insula is hyperactivated and 48 hyperconnected when listening to trigger sounds [31]. This finding has been interpreted 49 within the context of social cognition and interoceptive awareness [32, 33]. The insula 50 has also been implicated in auditory hallucinations [34], and intracranial stimulation of 51 this region can produce auditory sensations [35-37], although not always [38]. However, 52 electrophysiological and imaging data have almost always been obtained in behaviorally 53 salient  contexts,  such  as  music  or  speech,  while  lesion  studies  may  not  always  be 54 specifically  localized to  insula  exclusively,  and  there  are currently no  reports  of single 55 neuron responses recorded in the human insula. 56
- Prior studies also do not address whether there is any tuning to basic acoustic sound 57 attributes in the insula [39]. For example, neurons in primary auditory cortex are tuned 58 to specific spectral and temporal features of acoustic stimuli [40-42]. Can activity of 59 individual neurons in the insula also be modulated according to these fundamental 60 acoustic properties even when stimuli are not behaviorally relevant? If so, what are the 61 latencies and tuning properties of these neurons, and where are these located? 62
- We addressed this gap in knowledge by recording extracellular single neuron activity 63 from the insula in eleven humans and comparing these recordings to those obtained 64 from the adjacent posteromedial portion of Heschl's gyrus (HGPM), corresponding to 65 primary auditory cortex [43]. Data were collected while participants passively listened to 66 auditory stimuli consisting of short click trains and pure tones of various frequencies. 67

68

This allowed us to determine (1) the extent of insula neurons that are responsive to

69

auditory stimulation; (2) whether these neurons showed frequency tuning; (3) the spatial

70

distribution of responsive neurons across posterior and anterior insula (InsP and InsA,

- respectively); and (4) the latencies, magnitudes, and durations of these responses 71
- compared to HGPM. Knowledge about the neuronal properties of this brain area in 72
- response in audition is important for understanding how the human brain processes 73
- sounds. This knowledge has additional relevance to auditory hallucinations and 74 disorders such as tinnitus [44]. 75

- Thus, to characterize the properties of neuronal responses to clicks across the 105
- population, we examined response magnitudes, latencies, and durations for modulated 106
- neurons in each region. For each neuron, significant modulation in response to auditory 107
- stimuli was determined by comparing the spike rates following the stimulus to the pre108
- stimulus baseline (see Methods). Trial-averaged raster plots for all significantly 109

- comparison, 84.2% of neurons in HGPM modulated significantly to clicks (77.2% 117
- increasing their activity, 7.02% decreasing). Fisher's Exact probability tests with the 118
- Freeman-Halton extension (to allow for preserving modulation direction with a 2 x 3 119

|   129 | significantly smaller than HGPM ( p = 0.00170 and p = 0.00360, respectively), with no       |

|   131 | neurons exhibited similar latencies to HGPM neurons ( p = 0.361), with median latencies     |
|   132 | of 44.0 ms (interquartile range [IQR] = 48.8) and 48.5ms (IQR = 45.5), respectively         |

|   142 | distributed throughout each subregion of insula, though there was an absence of             |

|   147 | total; 84.8% increasing, 10.2% decreasing), with a lower proportion in InsA modulated in    |

|   154 | regions by determining the proportion of neurons showing a preference to each of the        |

## Discussion 172

Our results demonstrate that neurons in the human insula significantly modulate their 173 activity in response to auditory stimuli that are passively presented, in the absence of 174 any obvious behavioral or emotional salience. Responses in insula had similar latencies 175 and bandwidths to HGPM, but were more transient. The highest proportion of these 176 responses were in InsP, though a smaller minority of neurons in InsA were also 177 modulated, albeit more weakly. Overall, these results suggest that processing of basic 178 properties of acoustic stimuli contribute to the postulated role of the insula. 179

The insula, particularly InsA, is known to be part of a salience network [49, 50] which 180 detects and marks how behaviorally relevant the stimulus/events in the environment 181 are. Depending on the degree of saliency, the insula mediates further processing by 182 directing attention or allocating working memory by coordinating between different brain 183 networks (e.g. activating a fronto-parietal network for attention and deactivating the 184 'mind wandering' default mode network for a highly salient event). How does InsA 185 receive sensory inputs for marking their saliency? Theoretical models of insula function 186 [1, 50, 51] suggest that InsP receives sensory inputs which  are then re-represented in 187 InsA. There is now ample evidence to support the idea that interoceptive signals from 188 the body do indeed reach InsP [1]. Whether this is also the case for exteroceptive 189 signals such as auditory, however, has historically been less certain. Our high spatial190 temporal resolution single neuron data recorded from the insula highlights that - like 191 signals from the body - auditory signals from the external environment are received in 192 InsP. It should be noted that in the saliency model of insula function, stimuli need not be 193 salient or behaviorally relevant to reach InsP , and they were not in the case of the 194 presence study. The saliency of the stimuli is proposed to be marked in InsA. This 195 model may then explain why in our data the proportion of modulated neurons is less in 196 InsA compared to that in InsP when passively listening to sounds, as these sounds were 197 not required to be salient. 198

Evidence showing that insula activity is modulated even during passive listening may 199 explain - at least in part - why lesions to the insula can cause altered auditory 200 processing, such as in cases of acquired amusia, temporal processing deficits or 201 hyperacusis after a stroke [52, 53]. The results of the current study are also consistent 202 with neuroanatomical studies showing that the insula receives direct projections from 203 auditory cortex [54, 55] and medial geniculate body [56], although as highlighted by 204 Remedios et al. [14], anatomical results do not give insight into the nature of the 205 involvement of the insula in auditory processing without corresponding physiological 206 data, which we have provided here. 207

These results may also explain why stimulation of insula can produce auditory 208 perceptual experiences [35-37]. Contrasting with these other studies, Duong et al. [38] 209

In the current study, our electrode locations were confirmed to 212 be in the insula based on individual participants' MRIs, as well as plotted on a template 213 using MNI coordinates. While it is plausible that some studies may have stimulated 214 regions adjacent to the insula to produce auditory perceptual experiences, another 215 possibility is that an absence of behavioral response may be due to the still relatively 216 small fraction of neurons in this region being involved in auditory processing (about 1/3 217 in the current study). Thus, if particular neurons were not stimulated by electrodes within 218 the insula, then an auditory percept would likely not be produced. Further studies 219 utilizing both stimulation mapping and auditory presentation in the same neurons would 220 be invaluable for elucidating the dynamics of these auditory-responsive insula neurons. 221 Reports of the tuning properties of single neurons in HGPM are rare, with only a handful 222 studies to date examining this [57-59]. In the first systematic study of individual neurons 223 in human auditory cortex, the bandwidth measured in a similar manner to the current 224 manuscript was at least 1 octave [58], consistent with what we found here. Contrastingly 225 though, the bandwidth of neuronal responses to tones here was considerably larger 226 than what was demonstrated previously when using an approach that estimates based 227 on spectro-temporal receptive fields derived from random-chord stimuli [59]. It is 228 therefore likely that basic tonal stimuli - although widely used historically to study the 229 function of the auditory system [60] - do not reveal the full extent of the precision of 230 stimulus encoding, and future studies should examine this with refined stimuli for both 231 the HGPM and the insula. Moreover, while this study represents a rich and unique 232 dataset, the spatial extent of electrode coverage was still somewhat limited, as 233 determined solely by the clinical needs of the patients. This work lays the foundation for 234 further, more comprehensive, studies aimed at understanding the full extent of auditory235 related single neuron activation throughout the insula. 236

Stimuli were delivered to both ears via insert earphones (ER4B, Etymotic 274 Research, Elk Grove Village, IL) that were integrated into custom-fit earmolds or foam 275 ear tips (for two participants). In each participant, the intensity difference between click 276 trains and pure tones was within 20 dB and varied depending on comfort. Inter-stimulus 277 intervals were chosen randomly within a Gaussian distribution (mean interval 2 s; SD = 278 10 ms) to reduce heterodyning in the recordings secondary to power line noise. 279 Stimulus delivery was controlled by a TDT RP2.1 and RZ2 real-time processor (Tucker 280 Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL). 281

## Imaging 283

A T1-weighted structural MRI scan of the brain was conducted for each participant both 284 before and after the implantation of electrodes. The images were captured using a 3T 285 Siemens TIM Trio scanner and a 12-channel head coil. MPRAGE images had a spatial 286 resolution of 0.78 × 0.78 mm, a slice thickness of 1.0 mm, and utilized a repetition time 287 (TR) of 2.53 s and an echo time (TE) of 3.52 ms. To locate the recording positions on 288 the preoperative structural MRI scans, these images were aligned with post289 implantation structural MRIs. This alignment was achieved using a 3D linear registration 290 algorithm (Functional MRI of the Brain Linear Image Registration Tool; [66]) and custom291 written MATLAB scripts (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Included microwire bundles were 292 verified to be within gray matter for either the insula or HGPM. Electrode locations were 293 co-registered for each participant to a template brain, in order to derive MNI coordinates 294 for the purposes of visualization. Coordinates of microwire locations were then 295 visualized on an fsaverage MRI template showing the insula and neighboring region of 296 HGPM, using custom-written MATLAB scripts. 297

## Data processing and analysis 299

Data from high impedance electrodes localized to the insula or HGPM were first 300 extracted using Matlab and denoised with an implementation of the demodulated band 301 transform [67]. These data were downsampled to 12 kHz and common average re302 referenced to all high impedance contacts on the same assembly prior to spike sorting. 303 Spike sorting was performed using an automated procedure with manual curation, 304 utilizing an algorithm implementing high-order spectral decomposition to aid in pattern 305 recognition and identify individual features [68]. Briefly, filters were estimated for 306 potential candidate single neuron waveforms for each channel through a process 307 related to blind deconvolution. Extracted features were clustered using a gaussian 308 mixture model in Matlab (R2022a, Mathworks Inc) and spike times from these clustered 309

Single neurons were then 310 manually curated and defined based on classical waveform shapes, uniformity of 311 waveforms across different spike times for each cluster, and interspike interval 312 distributions that did not violate refractory periods (&lt;1% of interspike intervals occurring 313 within 1 ms). See Supplementary Figure 1 for summarized curation details. Putative 314 single neuron spike times were then epoched around the stimuli for each trial (500 ms 315 before stimulus onset to 1000 ms post-stimulus onset). Raster plots were created to 316 show neuronal activity for each trial and spike density functions were estimated by 317 convolving single neuron spike times with a gaussian kernel (1 ms resolution, generally 318 5 ms standard deviation, though a standard deviation of 15 ms was used for display 319 purposes in Figure 1 ). 320

## Statistical analysis 322

Single neuron modulation to auditory stimuli was determined using a two-tailed paired  t 323 test against baseline, wherein spike rates across trials between 0 to 350 ms post324 stimulus were compared to baseline firing rates from a pre-stimulus window of the same 325 duration (-400 to -50 ms). This was only considered for neurons that had a mean firing 326 rate ≥ 1 Hz across the baseline and post-stimulus windows. The p -value alpha for this 327 test was set at 0.05 for click stimuli and Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) 328 correction [69, 70]  was applied to tonal response p -values to account for multiple 329 comparisons (based on the six different tone frequencies presented). Magnitudes for all 330 responses were determined by averaging the z-scored firing rate across the post331 stimulus window. The latency of significantly modulated neurons was then determined 332 according to the first peak in the baseline z-scored spike density function from 10 ms to 333 350 ms post-stimulus, wherein this peak was a minimum value of half of the maximum 334 peak within this time window. For neurons that suppressed their activity in response to 335 auditory stimuli, spike density functions were first inverted prior to finding the peak. For 336 tone stimuli, the best frequency of each neuron was defined as the tone that elicited the 337 maximum absolute value of the z-scored average, wherein this response was 338 significant. Bandwidth in octaves was determined based on the full width at half 339 maximum of this frequency, which was obtained after interpolation of both frequencies 340 and magnitudes to create 10000 discrete sampling points. Where the lowest or highest 341 frequencies were the maximum absolute value (i.e. showed the strongest modulation), 342 these were taken as the low or high cutoff for this calculation, respectively. Response 343 durations were determined based on the time after the first peak wherein the spike 344 density function was reduced to 5% of the maximum peak value. Regional differences in 345 response properties were examined using a linear mixed effects modeling approach. 346 Output (response magnitude, latency or duration) was modeled using region of interest 347
