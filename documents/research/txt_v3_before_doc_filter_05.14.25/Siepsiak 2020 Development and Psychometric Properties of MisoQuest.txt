Abstract: Background : Misophonia is a condition related to experiencing psychophysiological
sensations when exposed to speciÔ¨Åc sound triggers. In spite of progress in research on the subject, a
fully validated questionnaire assessing misophonia has not been published yet. The goal of this study
was to create and validate a new questionnaire to measure misophonia. Methods : MisoQuest is based
on the diagnostic criteria proposed by Schr√∂der et al. in 2013, with minor changes implemented by
the authors of MisoQuest. A total of 705 participants took part in the study, completing the online
questionnaires. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and analyses using the Item Response Theory
(IRT) were performed. Internal consistency was evaluated with Cronbach‚Äôs alpha. Results : The
reliability of the MisoQuest was excellent ( =0.955). The stability at Ô¨Åve weeks was strong. There
was a signiÔ¨Åcant di erence in results between people classiÔ¨Åed as those with misophonia and those
without misophonia. Conclusions : MisoQuest has good psychometric values and can be helpful in the
identiÔ¨Åcation of misophonia. A deeper analysis showed that certain triggers might be more speciÔ¨Åc
for people with misophonia. Consideration of violent behavior in response to misophonic triggers as
a symptom of misophonia was undermined.

1. Introduction
Misophonia, or Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome, is a type of decreased sound tolerance
characterized by increased, autonomic nervous system response to speciÔ¨Åc triggers [ 1‚Äì3]. The
phenomenon of this speciÔ¨Åc sound sensitivity was Ô¨Årst described by Jastrebo in 2001 [ 4]. However,
since then the understanding of misophonia has evolved.
People with misophonia while being exposed to certain auditory triggers experience strong,
immediate, unwanted emotions and physiological reactions such as increased heart rate, sweating,
and muscle tension. The dominant, but not exclusive, emotions related to misophonia are anger,
disgust, extreme irritation, and anxiety [ 3,5,6]. In contrast to the less-discussed phonophobia [ 7],
misophonia is not associated with experiencing fear of the sound while it is occurring [ 8,9], excluding
it from classiÔ¨Åcation as a phobia. However, the deÔ¨Ånitions and classiÔ¨Åcation of these phenomena
are still being discussed; for example, Jastrebo [2] classiÔ¨Åed phonophobia as a type of misophonia.
Among the most aversive triggers are sounds made by human mouths or noses, such as chewing,
breathing sounds, lip-smacking, crunching, or sni ng. Some researchers [ 6] noted that the sound
of a baby crying orhigh-pitched voices can also trigger misophonic reactions; however, the study
by Kumar et al. [ 10] showed that these kinds of sounds evoke signiÔ¨Åcantly di erent reactions on

psychophysiological and neuropsychological levels than do sounds related to eating. They found that
in people with misophonia, sounds of eating, breathing, or drinking (trigger sounds) are related to
abnormal activation of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) and abnormal functional connectivity of this
structure with brain areas responsible for emotion processing and regulation. Other sounds produced
by people but not directly by the human body, for example, pen clicking, rustling, tapping, typing,
shuing, and environmental sounds, can also be misophonic triggers [ 5,8]. In misophonia, according
to the current state of knowledge, the acoustic characteristics of sounds have no impact on emotional
arousal [ 3] or are secondary [ 1,2]. The type of aversive triggers di er from person to person and
the reaction towards trigger sounds can depend on many factors, such as assessment of the sound,
personal experience, social context or psychological proÔ¨Åle [2].
Misophonia is not yet classiÔ¨Åed by any o cial diagnostic system, either the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) or the International ClassiÔ¨Åcation of
Diseases, Eleventh Edition(ICD-11), but it seems that despite previous beliefs, misophonia is itself a
separate disorder, rather than a symptom of other disorders [ 11,12]. Schr√∂der et al. published the Ô¨Årst
complete proposition of diagnostic criteria for misophonia in 2013 [ 8]. According to these criteria,
misophonia is diagnosed when:
 An individual experiences a strong, immediate somatic reaction that begins with irritation or
disgust which quickly turns into anger in the presence of or in the expectation of aversive sounds.
The anger makes a person feel out of control, sometimes leading to aggressive behavior;
 The person assesses these reactions as disproportionate to the situation;
 Due to the consequences of unpleasant experiences caused by certain sounds, the person, if
possible, avoids situations in which the trigger is expected or struggles with high discomfort in its
presence. Therefore, the condition has a signiÔ¨Åcant, negative impact on the person‚Äôs life;
 The avoidance and emotional reaction to certain triggers cannot be better explained by other
disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Despite signiÔ¨Åcant progress in the Ô¨Åeld of misophonia, this description still seems to be valid.
Currently, however, most scientists agree that all kinds of sounds may provoke a misophonic reaction,
not only those produced by humans [ 3]. New data has led to the creation of other criteria for diagnosing
misophonia, broadened in terms of the potential sensory modalities of the triggers as well as the type
of emotions and body sensations that occur. Some researchers claim that the aversive reaction can
be triggered not only by sounds, but also by all kinds of triggers, such as smell, movement, or touch.
The immediate physical reÔ¨Çex response, such as muscle constriction, was suggested to be the initial
reaction in misophonia [13]. Nevertheless, such cases are less documented.
Some questionnaires for measuring misophonia have been developed and used in several studies.
The Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ), developed by Wu et al. in 2014 [ 14], is the most detailed and
widely used [ 12,15‚Äì17]. The data was gathered on a group of undergraduate students of psychology
and showed good psychometric values. The MQ has good internal consistency. However, it is not clear
whether the questionnaire measures misophonia or, rather, some other, more general phenomenon
because its external validity was veriÔ¨Åed with a questionnaire which measures general sound sensitivity.
The MQ was developed before the core details of misophonia were agreed upon, and therefore may
beneÔ¨Åt from reÔ¨Ånement.
Another widely used questionnaire, the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S), was developed
by Schr√∂der et al. [ 8].This scale was one of the Ô¨Årst attempts to measure misophonia and, like the MQ,
played an essential role in exploring this phenomenon. Its psychometric values have not yet been
presented though. A-MISO-S was adapted from the Yale‚ÄìBrown Obsessive Compulsive Scale at a time
when misophonia was still strongly associated with OCD. Subsequent research did not conÔ¨Årm this
association and made the speciÔ¨Åc characteristics of misophonia clearer [ 11,12]. However, the Ô¨Åndings
from other research on the relationship between misophonia and OCD are not consistent, showing
certain common traits to these two conditions [ 16]. Other scales which measure misophonia include

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 1797 3 of 15
the Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ), created by Johnson and revised by Dozier and
published on misophoniatreatment.org [ 18], The Misophonia Physical Sensation Scale, created by
Baumanand published on misophoniatreatment.org [ 19], or the Misophonia Activation Scale (MAS-1),
created by Fitzmauriceand published on misophonia.co.uk [ 20]. All these scales have been used in
research on misophonia, but none have been validated or published in peer-reviewed journals.
The growing interest of researchers in the Ô¨Åeld of misophonia has increased the number of studies
on the subject. Despite signiÔ¨Åcant improvements in knowledge about misophonia, the problem
of generalization and comparison between research results emerges, which is exempliÔ¨Åed by the
recent discussion between two prominent misophonia researchers‚ÄîSchr√∂der and Kumar [ 21,22]. The
criteria used to diagnose misophonia in research often di er. Therefore, results from studies cannot
be easily compared with each other. Consequently, there is a need to develop a validated tool for
diagnosing misophonia.
At the moment, there is no fully validated questionnaire available that measures misophonia
based on the current understanding of the disorder. This study aimed to develop and validate a
new questionnaire to assess misophonia. The construction of the tool was based on the criteria
speciÔ¨Åed by Schr√∂der et al. [ 8]. Thus, speciÔ¨Åc misophonia-like sensitivities across other modalities,
such as misokinesia or sensitivity to certain fabrics, were not included. As well as standard statistical
methods, the Item Response Theory (IRT) was used to assess the diagnostic value of each item
and, thus, to determine which criteria best di erentiate people with misophonia from those without
this condition. Some statistics were calculated separately for participants with education in music
because it was hypothesized that they can perceive sounds and understand questions related to
sounds di erently [ 23‚Äì25] and, therefore, their MisoQuest results would di er. Similarly, the group of
participants who self-reported a psychiatric diagnosis was distinguished in the study due to potential
relationships with misophonia.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Ethical Approval
The study is a part of a research project named ‚ÄúPsychological and psychophysiological correlates
of misophonia (decreased sound tolerance)‚Äù, conducted at the Faculty of Psychology at the University
of Warsaw, Poland. The Ethics Committee at the faculty approved the project (document number:
12/5/2018). The study was conducted on-line. All participants gave informed written consent before
taking part in the study and also accepted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) policy.
2.2. Questionnaire Construction
The questionnaire was developed in two phases (on two di erent samples). The data collection
period spanned between May and December 2018. Firstly, the pool of items was created following
the criteria of Schr√∂der et al. [ 8]. Items were arranged in seven domains extracted from the criteria
(see Table 1): (1) reaction to speciÔ¨Åc sounds; (2) an occurrence of reaction; (3) emotional reactions; (4)
control of emotional reactions; (5) attitude to own reactions; (6) avoidance; (7) and daily functioning.
For each domain, a set of items (questions suited to the domains) was created (ranging from 6 to
14 items per domain). Two psychologists with experience working with patients with misophonia
assessed items in terms of comprehensibility and compliance with the criteria of misophonia. The Ô¨Årst
phase was initiated after incorporating their linguistic and theoretical corrections to the questions. The
initial version of MisoQuest had 60 items. Because there were similar questions within each domain,
veriÔ¨Åcation of their power began by analyzing their consistency with the scale for the whole group as
well as groups of individuals with and without misophonia-like issues (self-report). At this stage of the
questionnaire development, we paid attention not only to the power of the questions but also to their
content. We tried not to lose questions that can diagnose the entire spectrum of over-responsiveness to
various sounds. The results were analyzed, and 21 items were used for the second phase. As a result

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 1797 4 of 15
of the second phase, 14 items were chosen for the Ô¨Ånal version of MisoQuest. To assess the occurrence
of misophonia, the Schr√∂der et al. [ 8] criteria were used. All participants were asked in the last part of
the survey if they experienced symptoms characteristic of misophonia, and only those that met all the
diagnostic criteria were deemed to have misophonia. During this phase, the participants were also
asked whether they had been diagnosed by a specialist (i.e., not self-diagnosed) with any disorder.

2.3. Participants
During both phases of the development and validation of MisoQuest, 705 participants with and
without sound issues participated in the study (383 and 322 participants respectively for each phase).
The questionnaire was distributed online in support groups for people with misophoniaand various
groups unrelated to either misophonia or other health issues, due to the limited number of people
with misophonia. Participants were aged 18 to 68 ( M=32.09, SD =8.58). In the second phase, seven
participants under 18 years old were excluded from the analysis. Women constituted the majority of

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 1797 5 of 15
the respondents (86.2% and 80% respectively for each phase). Despite such large disproportions, no
signiÔ¨Åcant di erences were found in Phase 1 between men and women in the presence of misophonia
(2(2)=3.53; p>0.05). However, in Phase 2, the di erences were signiÔ¨Åcant. More women ( n=55;
21.8%) than men ( n=6; 9.5%) had misophonia according to their responses to the questions given at
the end of the survey ( 2(1)=4.88; p<0.05). During the second phase of the study, the diagnosis of
neurological and psychiatric disorders was validated by self-report (see Table 2). A group of musicians
who practice from one hour to seven hours a day was also distinguished.

2.4. Data Management and Analytic Strategy
The construct validity of MisoQuest was examined via Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Internal consistency was evaluated with Cronbach‚Äôs alpha.
ConÔ¨Årmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is usually performed to validate potential questionnaire models
obtained by EFA [26].
Because the Ô¨Ånal form of MisoQuest had only one factor and very high inter-item correlations and
inter-total correlations, CFA was abandoned. Analyses using the IRT were performed instead. IRT
models help to explain the relationship between latent traits (symbolized by ) and their manifestation
in questionnaire responses. In simple terms, they help determine the precision of psychological scales.
The stronger the trait is, the higher the probability of a correct response (answer in accordance with
the key) [ 27]. However, IRT models assume that a scale‚Äôs items are not equally informative across
the latent trait range. The informative value depends on two parameters of the item: di culty and
discrimination. Due to the Likert-type scale used in MisoQuest, we used the Graded Response Model
(GRM) for polytomous data [ 28]. In this model, di culty parameters indicate the threshold of a
latent trait between answer choices and the discrimination parameter reÔ¨Çects the degree to which
an item discriminates individuals across the latent trait range [ 29]. To compare the Ô¨Åt of the two

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 1797 6 of 15
models (constrained and unconstrained), the Akaike‚Äôs Information Criterion (AIC) [ 30] and Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC) [ 31] were calculated. To examine the concurrent validity of MisoQuest,
bivariate analysis was conducted using the Student‚Äôs t-test for independent samples. Finally, a subset
of the validation study ( n=97) was used to evaluate test-retest reliability at a Ô¨Åve-week interval.
Data analysis was carried out with SPSS v25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and RStudio, with alpha
criterionof 0.05. RStudio [ 32] was used to conduct IRT with the ltm, msm, and polycor packages [ 28]
and also to conduct ROC /AUC analysis with the pRoc package [ 33]. All graphs in this paper were
prepared using RStudio.
3. Results
An Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted on 60 items of the Ô¨Årst version of the
questionnaire, producing a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) index score of 0.971 and a statistically signiÔ¨Åcant
Bartlett‚Äôs test ( p<0.001). Following Kaiser‚Äôs criteria, the EFA provided a model composed of eight
factors, accounting for 69.84% of the total variance explained. However, Cattell‚Äôs scree test indicated
that only one factor lay above the debris (see Figure 1A), accounting for 50.05% of the total variance.
Thirty-eight items had high loadings ( >0.7), and ten items had low overall loadings ( <0.5). At least
two of the best items were selected from each of the seven domains (see Table 1). Two items were
added to the Ô¨Årst version of the questionnaire because they matched the criteria distinguished by
other researchers [ 34]. The Ô¨Årst of them concerned sounds only made by objects (Q13) and the second
concerned violent reactions toward others caused by the trigger (Q38). As a consequence, a preliminary
version of the questionnaire consisting of 21 items was created.

 (answer in accordance with the key) [27]. However, IRT models assume that a scale‚Äôs items are not 
equally informative across the latent trait range. The informative value depends on two parameters 
of the item: difficulty and discrimination. Due to the Likert-type scale used in MisoQuest, we used 
the Graded Response Model (GRM) for polytomous da ta [28]. In this model, difficulty parameters 
indicate the threshold of a latent trait between answer choices and the discrimination parameter 
reflects the degree to which an item discriminates individuals across the latent trait range [29]. To 
compare the fit of the two models (constrained and unconstrained), the Akaike‚ÄôsInformation Criterion (AIC) [30] and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [31] were calculated. To examine the concurrent validity of MisoQuest, bivariate analysis was conducted using the Student‚Äôs t-test for 
independent samples. Finally, a subset of the validation study ( n=97) was used to evaluate test-
retest reliability at a five-week interval. 
Data analysis was carried out with SPSS v25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and RStudio, with 
alpha criterionof 0.05. RStudio[32] was used to conduct IRT with the ltm, msm, and polycor packages [28] and also to conduct ROC/AUC analysis with the pRoc package [33]. All graphs in this paper were prepared using RStudio.

The second phase of the development of MisoQuest was prepared using an entirely di erent
sample ( N=315). An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) revealed a KMO Index of 0.961. Bartlett‚Äôs test
of sphericity was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant ( 2=4952.663, p<0.001). This analysis provided a factorial
structure with two factors that accounted for 61.63% of the variance. However, the Cattell‚Äôs scree
test indicated that only one factor should be taken into account (it explained 56.29% of variance; see
Figure 1B). Twenty items were assigned to the Ô¨Årst factor and only one item to the second factor (Q38

factor loadings are presented in Table 1.
3.2. Item Response Theory Analysis
The Graded Response Model [ 35] is the simplest model created to examine the psychometric
properties of tools with multiple response formats (like Likert-type scales). Polytomous models are
extensively used in applied psychological measurement to help reduce test length without losing
valuable information. In the Ô¨Årst step, we evaluated the Ô¨Åt of the unconstrained and constrained
models (assuming not equal and equal discrimination parameters across items, respectively). The

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 1797 7 of 15
likelihood ratio test for the unconstrained model (AIC =15,726.13; BIC =16,122.79) was signiÔ¨Åcantly
better than for the constrained model (AIC =15,904.54; BIC =16,225.64). Models with lower AIC
values are desirable, as they indicate a closer Ô¨Åt to a true model [36].
In IRT, the discrimination level, , is considered high if its value is higher than one. Only one
item (Q38), which was recognized as a separate factor in EFA, did not reach the low discrimination
level. Most items had an level higher than two, which means that these questions are very good
in dierentiating people with and without misophonia. Trace curves for each item (Figure 2) were

Trace curve analysis showed that for almost all items, the individuals responded very
dichotomously. They unambiguously chose option one or Ô¨Åve more often than the other options. This
is probably due to the speciÔ¨Åcity of misophonia symptoms. For items Q4, Q12, Q23, Q26, Q29, Q32,
Q35, Q40, Q47, Q49, and Q56, the neutral answer (choice three) was chosen less often than other item
choices. This means that individuals either had moderate or strong symptoms or had none at all.
Based on the results of the EFA and IRT, 14 items were selected for the Ô¨Ånal version of MisoQuest.
Figure 3 contains the item information curves divided into those that were selected for the questionnaire
(Figure 3A) and those that were rejected (Figure 3B). The higher the curve in the chart, the greater
the discrimination factor of the item. The more it is shifted to the right, the better it di erentiates
people with misophonia. Item Q4 has the lowest discrimination rate of the MisoQuest items, but it is
a question that fewer people respond to using the key. It is also the only question that directly asks
about sounds made by the human body. Furthermore, it is the best question according to EFA in terms
of reaction to the speciÔ¨Åc sound criteria of misophonia. On the other hand, Q15 was rejected despite a
very good discrimination level ( =2.010), since many subjects responded to it according to the key.
The Test Information Curve for the Ô¨Ånal version of the MisoQuest was estimated and indicates that the
curve covers the desired range from  2 to+2, which is necessary for a clinical diagnostic tool. The
accuracy of the measurement for subjects with misophonia for the entire scale in the range from  2to

Internal consistency of the MisoQuest was assessed by applying Cronbach‚Äôs alpha in both 
samples (utilizing only the final 14 items). The reliability of MisoQuest was excellent in both 
samples ( Œ± = 0.961, Œ± = 0.955, respectively). It was found that most items correlated with the total 
score, with values ranging from 0.69 to 0.83 (see Table 1). This indicates the very high homogeneity 
of the questionnaire. For test-retest reliability, all participants from the second phase were asked to 
complete the test again. The analysis was carried out on 97 complete response pairs. The stability of the instrument at five weeks was strong. The inte rclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in a two-way

Internal consistency of the MisoQuest was assessed by applying Cronbach‚Äôs alpha in both samples
(utilizing only the Ô¨Ånal 14 items). The reliability of MisoQuest was excellent in both samples ( =
0.961, =0.955, respectively). It was found that most items correlated with the total score, with values
ranging from 0.69 to 0.83 (see Table 1). This indicates the very high homogeneity of the questionnaire.
For test-retest reliability, all participants from the second phase were asked to complete the test again.
The analysis was carried out on 97 complete response pairs. The stability of the instrument at Ô¨Åve
weeks was strong. The interclass correlation coe cient (ICC) in a two-way random model in absolute
agreement for the total scale was 0.84, 95% CI (0.78, 0.89). Even the test-retest reliability for every item
was very high, ranging from 0.59 to 0.78 (80% of items had an ICC higher than 0.67).
3.4. Criterion-Related Validity
An independent t-test was utilized to evaluate the concurrent validity of MisoQuest. The means
(SD) for MisoQuestare based on di erent diagnoses and are for musicians and non-musicians; details
can be found in Table 3. There was a signiÔ¨Åcant di erence ( t(306,855) =21.65; p<0.001; Cohen0s d
=2.13) in results between people classiÔ¨Åed as having misophonia ( M=65.72; SD =4.3) and those
without misophonia ( M=41.77; SD =15.3). After exclusion of people with developmental, a ective,
and anxiety disorders, the di erence between people with misophonia ( n=47;M=66.04; SD =3.66)
and without misophonia ( n=206; M=39.99; SD =15.14) remained similarly signiÔ¨Åcant, but slightly

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 1797 9 of 15
higher and stronger ( t(250,296) =22.04; p<0.001; Cohen‚Äôs d =2.37). Further analysis showed that
people with any diagnosis ( M=52.87; SD =13.84) obtained signiÔ¨Åcantly higher results on the scale
(t(111,322) =3.9;p<0.001; Cohen0s d=0.52), than people with no diagnosis ( M=44.83; SD =17.09).
All diagnoses, such as autism, OCD, depression, and anxiety disorder, were merged into one factor
because of the limited number of participants with a particular diagnosis.

4. Discussion
The goal of this study was to develop and assess the psychometric value of MisoQuest, a new
questionnaire for measuring misophonia or Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome. MisoQuest consists
of 14 items organized within one factor. Its internal consistency is excellent and its stability over a
Ô¨Åve-week period is substantial. Criterion-related validity was preliminarily conÔ¨Årmed with a set of
self-reported questions derived from the diagnostic criteria for misophonia [8].
There are a few characteristics that distinguish MisoQuest from other questionnaires that also
measure misophonia. In contrast to the most common tool, A-MISO-S, and the third part of MQ,
MisoQuest was not based on a questionnaire for assessing OCD, so it does not include items speciÔ¨Åcally
associated with OCD such as time spent resisting thoughts about misophonic sounds. Rather, its items
deal speciÔ¨Åcally with elements related to the current understanding of misophonia. There are also
no questions about the time consumed by trigger sounds, as the answer can depend more on the
respondent0s adaptive abilities, avoidance, way of life (e.g., working from home) or time of the year
(e.g., Christmas time). In MisoQuest, the respondent is not directly asked about ‚Äúmisophonic‚Äù sounds,
because it is not intended to assess the intensity of misophonia, but rather to screen for misophonia.
MisoQuest was constructed based on the misophonia criteria identiÔ¨Åed by Schr√∂der et al. [ 8], with
some modiÔ¨Åcations. Possible triggers were extended from sounds only produced by humans to all
kinds of sounds and the item on aggressive behaviors was excluded. The role of anger is emphasized
(items Q12 and Q19) due to the psychometric indications as well as the aim to capture extreme emotions,
however, there is also a question on irritation (Q21) and a number of items deal with other unpleasant
emotions (Q5, Q8, Q9, and Q16). In order to identify the type of trigger sounds, separate items related
to sounds (only human vs. other sounds) were created.
According to the criteria, the emotional reaction of anger needs to be immediate (item Q19), so
MisoQuest will not identify people who are irritated or feel uncomfortable only when the sound does
not stop for a long time. This likely means that fewer people will be diagnosed with misophonia when
assessed with MisoQuest than with MQ, but those diagnosed will be more homogeneous. It is not
possible to draw conclusions about the prevalence of misophonia (measured by MisoQuest) from this
study, as this was beyond its scope. Because of these characteristics, MisoQuest can be considered

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 1797 10 of 15
to be a good tool to measure misophonia as deÔ¨Åned as a condition in which a person is triggered
immediately by certain sounds and anger as a core, but not necessarily exclusive, emotion. Therefore,
it is not claimed that MisoQuest should always be the Ô¨Årst questionnaire of choice. The use of the tool
should depend on the way misophonia is deÔ¨Åned.
Our analysis also revealed some meaningful hints regarding the characteristics of misophonia
which are mostly consistent with or complementary to the available data on this phenomenon.
One of the most interesting secondary Ô¨Åndings of this study is the signiÔ¨Åcance of the source of
the misophonic triggers. In the Ô¨Årst version of Schr√∂der‚Äôs criteria for diagnosing misophonia, the
only potential source of trigger sounds was human. In several studies, such sounds have been found
to be the most aversive for people with misophonia. Nonetheless, a number of studies have shown
that all kinds of sounds, not only human-related, can potentially provoke reactions in people with
misophonia [ 2,13]. Therefore, in MisoQuest we included all kinds of sounds as possible triggers. The
item regarding sounds made by humans had the most signiÔ¨Åcant psychometric values in EFA. IRT
analysis revealed that this question was the most speciÔ¨Åc for people with misophonia.
Interestingly, an item regarding reactions towards quiet, soft sounds had similar psychometric
properties to the one about human sounds, which are usually soft as well. Thus, this is another
indication that the source of trigger sound in misophonia might be more speciÔ¨Åc than is currently
believed and more related to humans, as was Ô¨Årst postulated in the diagnostic criteria for misophonia [ 8].
Nonetheless, this needs further exploration with more objective testing.
Another important discovery was the invalidity of a questionnaire item related to physical violence
(Q38) and verbal violence (Q37 in the 60-item version). The inclusion of these items in a preliminary
version of MisoQuest may be seen as controversial, but it was intentional. The occurrence of an act of
violence in response to triggers among people with misophonia is mentioned somewhat anecdotally
in certain publications, but can also be found in some non-validated scales for misophonia (e.g.,
the Misophonia Activation Scale). At the same time, the data shows that most cases of misophonia
develop in childhood [ 5,8,9,11,37]. Here, participants were asked if they had assaulted anybody in
their childhood because of unpleasant sounds made by this person. Questions were asked about the
past, as asking about the present might be aggravating. Moreover, aggressive behavior in misophonia
is sometimes reported as being present in children [ 38] (however, there is not enough data to draw
deÔ¨Ånitive conclusions about its presence in adults).This study showed that there is no relation between
recalled misophonia experiences in childhood and acts of violence‚Äîboth IRT and EFA analysis
indicated the inadequacy of this item. It is worth noting that some participants commented that
this question surprised them and in their opinion, it has nothing to do with sound sensitivities
or misophonia (both in the comments section of the survey and on the internet forum where the
questionnaire was made available). However, because the term ‚Äúchildhood‚Äù was not deÔ¨Åned for the
participants of the study and data on the onset of misophonia among participants was not gathered, it is
not possible to draw strong conclusions from these results regarding the relation between misophonia
in childhood and acts of violence.
An interesting characteristic was found regarding the intensity of symptoms on the scale. People
with psychiatric disorders (depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and anxiety disorders) together
with autism, merged in one variable due to the limited number of participants with a second diagnosis,
scored signiÔ¨Åcantly higher on the scale than people without any diagnosis. It is worth pointing out that
the relation between sound-sensitivity issues experienced by people with autism spectrum disorder
and misophonia is not known. More data on the characteristics of sound sensitivities in people with
psychiatric disorders and autism is needed. In this study, the di erence between mean scores of people
with psychiatric disorders and people with autism was only two points. However, after the exclusion of
participants with misophonia (see the raw data are available in the Supplementary Materials), people
with autism scored much higher on the scale than people with psychiatric disorders. Additionally,
respondents were asked about any diagnosis given by a psychiatrist and were not screened with any

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 1797 11 of 15
additional questionnaires or interviews. Diagnoses more objective than self-description should be
implemented to increase the value of results.
A dierent pattern was found in the group of musicians‚Äîthey scored signiÔ¨Åcantly lower on the
scale than non-musicians. Previous Ô¨Åndings on this subject have been inconsistent. Some results have
suggested a more frequent prevalence of sound sensitivities (not misophonia) among musicians [ 24,25]
while others did not reveal any di erence between musicians and non-musicians in terms of levels of
sensitivity to sounds [ 23]. Presumably, musicians can perceive sounds di erently to non-musicians, as
well as questions on sound issues. Nonetheless, the sample, especially of musicians and people with
autism, cannot be representative because of the methodology (internet-based, non-randomized study),
so the results must be interpreted with caution.
Finally, the study also provides valuable information on types of emotions related to misophonia.
In the second version (with 21 items; not the Ô¨Ånal version) of the questionnaire, there were two items
concerning the characteristics of emotions: a general one (‚ÄúWhen I hear some :::. immediately I
experience unpleasant emotions‚Äù ) and a speciÔ¨Åc one (‚Äú...immediately I experience anger ‚Äù). The question
specifying anger was characterized by better values in the EFA analysis than the question which
mentioned general emotions. Moreover, the IRT analysis showed that fewer people answered this
question according to the key (i.e., agreed with the item statement), so it was more speciÔ¨Åc for people
with misophonia. This is another proof that misophonia is related to the strong experience of anger,
not to general unpleasant emotions.
Limitations
Despite the good psychometric values of MisoQuest, this study has certain limitations that should
be taken into consideration when using the tool, as well as in the further development of questionnaires
for measuring misophonia.
Firstly, the criterion validity was based on a self-report assessment of the symptoms of misophonia.
This was due to the inability to individually investigate a large number of people with speciÔ¨Åc, yet
not o cially recognized, symptoms. We also rejected the idea of calling participants on the phone
because it would not be possible to properly take care of the participants‚Äô wellbeing and safety. The
questions used for assessing criterion-related validity were derived from the diagnostic criteria on
which MisoQuest was based. Nonetheless, the items in MisoQuest are slightly broader than the direct
questions taken from the diagnostic criteria.
We did not test the convergent validity of MisoQuest by correlating its results with other
misophonia measures because of some methodological issues which we believe are critical for proper
measurement of this construct.We decided not to use A-MISO-S because its main purpose is to measure
the intensity of clinical symptoms of misophonia when it is already known to be present. The MQ was
also unsuitable for testing the convergent validity of our measure because it detects a much wider
construct than does MisoQuest. In MisoQuest, the emotional reaction must be immediate (in MQ there
are items on repetitive sounds, in MisoQuest anger must be present), in MQ sadness or annoyance
are su cient to be accepted as misophonic reactions. Thus, it would not be informative to compare
MisoQuest to MQ in order to assess its convergent validity because these two questionnaires are based
on di erent diagnostic criteria. Moreover, at the time of performing this study, there was no Polish
version of MQ available.
No hyperacusis questionnaire was used in order to assess MisoQuest‚Äôs divergent validity because
there is still no consensus on the comorbidity of these two disorders. It is highly possible that a large
number of people experience both, so the correlation between results from those questionnaires would
not be informative either. If the results showed that there was a high correlation between MisoQuest
and a questionnaire that measures hyperacusis, then it would not be possible to conclude whether
MisoQuest diagnosed hyperacusis rather than misophonia or whether people with misophonia also
suer from hyperacusis. More meticulous discriminant validity, with more objective methods such
as audiological assessment of Loudness Discomfort Level and interviews focused on hyperacusis,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 1797 12 of 15
should be used in order to make sure that the questionnaire excludes people who have hyperacusis but
not misophonia. Additionally, it was not possible to perform discriminant analysis with hyperacusis
questionnaires because there has been no Polish version of any hyperacusis questionnaire available
until now.
Further analyses for external validity of MisoQuest based on psychophysiological, psychiatric,
and audiological indicators are in progress.
Secondly, aversive triggers were limited to sounds; while some data show that misophonia might
be not limited to sound triggers, visual triggers are also commonly reported to be aversive for some
people with misophonia [ 5,8,38]. This might also be seen as an advantage of the questionnaire, as the
signiÔ¨Åcance of the role of selective sensitivity in other modalities has not been as explored as sound
sensitivity and could inÔ¨Çuence the results. Nonetheless, the role of other modalities in misophonia
such as sight, touch, or smell should also be studied in the future.
Thirdly, there was a limited number of people with a second diagnosis, which made it impossible
to perform statistical analysis for each of the diagnoses. The grouping of people with a ective and
anxiety disorder with people with autism into one variable is a severe drawback of the study. The
results indicate a need to explore characteristics of speciÔ¨Åc sound sensitivities in groups with particular
disorders in further studies.
Fourthly, there is no information provided by the study on the exact sounds that were considered
to be triggers. However, this was not the aim of the study because of a vast variety of possible triggers
in misophonia; this should be explored in further studies.
Fifthly, MisoQuest was developed in Polish and tried out on a Polish population. Therefore there
is a need for further validation and adaptation for other countries and di erent languages.
Lastly, this questionnaire was constructed and validated in an internet-based, self-report study, on
people recruited via social media. Thus, even though an e ort was made to advertise the study in a
variety of internet groups and forums, including the use of paid Facebook advertisements, and to recruit
participants from various sources, there is a need for further validation of MisoQuest. Additional
validation of MisoQuest with psychological, audiological and experimental assessments is ongoing.
5. Conclusions
We have created MisoQuest, a questionnaire which assesses misophonia. It was developed and
tested in Poland and the Polish version is characterized by good psychometric values. MisoQuest is
substantially di erent from the misophonia questionnaires currently in use. It is also the Ô¨Årst fully
validated misophonia questionnaire. MisoQuest results suggest that certain triggers might be more
speciÔ¨Åc to misophonia and that people with misophonia do not respond to misophonic triggers in a
violent way.
