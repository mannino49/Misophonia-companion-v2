EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
2 ABSTRACT  
Autistic people and those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are at a high risk of 
developing an eating disorder. While there is limited evidence on the relationship between 
other forms of neurodivergence and eating disorders, research suggests associations between 
giftedness, intellectual disability, Tourette’s syndrome, and disordered eating. Factors 
underlying disordered eating and/or eating disorder risk for neurodivergent people are 
multifaceted and complex, encompassing a wide range of inte rtwined psychosocial, 
environmental, and biological processes. Moreover, research shows that neurodivergent 
individuals experience poorer treatment outcomes compared to neurotypical individuals. 
However, there is a paucity of research in this area overall.  More specifically, lived 
experience -led research remains rare, despite its critical role for improving individualised 
eating disorder care, as well as mental healthcare more broadly. Indeed, the importance of 
eating disorder care individuation is increasi ngly being recognised, particularly within the 
context of neurodivergence, given the heterogeneous experiences and support needs of 
neurodivergent people affected by disordered eating and/or eating disorders. Furthermore, 
despite documented overlaps betwee n various forms of neurodivergence (e.g., co -occurring 
autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), research looking at eating disorders in the 
context of neurodivergence through a transdiagnostic perspective is scarce. This lived 
experience -led n arrative review aims to shed light on the intersectional factors underlying 
high disordered eating and/or eating disorder risk for neurodivergent individuals. First, an 
overview of prevalence data is provided, followed by a thematic framework identifying 
factors underlying disordered eating and/or eating disorder risk in relation to 
neurodivergence. A critical appraisal of current eating disorder research and care is then 
offered before suggestions for neurodiversity -affirming eating disorder care are made.  In this 
view, this paper offers a foundation for future empirical work in this nascent field of inquiry

PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY  
Autistic people and those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have a high risk of 
developing an eating disorder. Other forms of neurodivergence, such as giftedness, 
intellectual disability, and Tourette’s syndrome, have also been associated with disordered 
eating. Compared to the general eating disorder population, neurodivergent people experience 
eating disorder symptoms over a longer period  of time  and commonly experience poorer 
eating disorder -related treatment outcomes. Yet, there is limited r esearch which is led by 
neurodivergent people with lived or living experience of eating disorders. However, it is 
essential to incorporate lived experience expertise in research  and treatment design and 
implementation  as this could improve understanding of the many complex and varied 
underlying eating disorder risk factors which may otherwise guide necessary treatment 
adaptation(s). Based on the perspectives of lived experience researchers and/or clinicians, this 
paper  discusses the various mechanisms under lying disordered eating and/or eating disorder 
risk in the context of neurodivergence to inform future developments in eating disorder -
related research and clinical practice.

4 1. POSITIONALITY STATEMENT  
All co -authors are neurodivergent and have lived experience of an eating disorder. We are 
researchers and/or clinicians specialising in the field of eating disorders. We also occupy a 
wide range of other intersecting marginalised identities across gender, sexuality, body size, 
class, and neurotype ; for example, some of us identify as gender diverse (e.g., transgender, 
gender non -binary)  and/or live in larger bodies. However, we acknowledge that there remain 
many experiences we cannot speak to as most of us identify as white, none of us has an 
intellectual disability, and we are all living in Western countries (Australia  and the United 
States of America ). Our broad collective personal and professional experiences have 
informed our investigation of intersectional factors related to disordered eating and/or eating 
disorder risk, critical appraisal of current eating disorder research and therapies, and 
considerations for neurodiversity -affirming eating disorder care.  
We take on a neurodiversity -affirming theoretical framework. Therefore, we purposefully use 
non-pathologising and non -stigmatising terminology in relation to neurodivergence. For 
example, we use terms such as ‘traits’, ‘features’, ‘characteristics’, ‘suppo rt needs’, 
‘differences’, ‘atypical’, ‘challenges’, or ‘difficulties’ rather than ‘abnormal’, ‘symptoms’, 
‘deficits’, ‘impairments’, ‘tantrums’, ‘attention seeking’, ‘dramatic’, ‘treatment resistant’, or 
‘non-compliant’ [1-3]. We also use identity -first la nguage (i.e., autistic person) in relation to 
autism as research shows this is th e preference of English -speaking autistic individuals [3-4]. 
Additionally, we refrain from using the terms ‘low/high functioning’ as these perpetuate 
erroneous and monolithic stereotypes – that is, autism being a linear construct [5-6] – and fail 
to capture the dynamic and fluctuating nature of disability [see 7 -8].

5 2. SCOPE AND AIMS  
The associations and psychopathological mechanisms underlying eating disorders in the 
context of neurodivergence remain understudied and poorly understood, as illustrated by 
limited lived experience -led, transdiagnostic, and intersectional research in this area. With 
this field of inquiry still in its infancy, this paper does not seek to provide a comprehensive, 
systematic, review of the literature. Instead, our aim is to prov ide a narrative review serving 
as a conceptual, lived experience -led, foundation f or future empirical work. In this view, this 
review  builds on the work of Adams et a l. [9]  investigating the underlying mechanisms 
linking autism and eating disorders and Field et al.'s [10] exploration of autism -specific 
eating disorder treatment adaptations. However, given the documented overlapping and 
transdiagnostic nature of neurodivergence  [11-13], our work diverges from Adams et al. [9] 
and Field et al. [10] as we take a wider lens to investigate neurodivergence using  a 
neurodiversity -affirming theoretical framework . Indeed, our  paper presents a holistic 
overview that considers intersectionality by succinctly capturing the complexity of 
interconnected socio -cultural and biological factors regarding neurodivergence and eating 
disorder risk from the perspectives of the authors’ bro ad professional and personal lived 
experience.  
 
3. BACKGROUND  
While evidence demonstrates overall lifetime prevalence of eating disorders (EDs) ranging 
between 0.74 -2.2% for males and 2.58 -8.4% for females [14], there are growing concerns 
over the increasing prevalence of EDs, particularly for children and adolescents [15]. 
However, pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
6 ED behaviours and cognitions remain poorly understood [16]. Furthermore, less than half of 
people with EDs who undergo ‘evidence -based’ treatments make a full, long -term, recovery 
[17]. The high relapse and mortality rates observed for EDs , even for those who can access 
treatment  [18], have prompted an increased recognition of the need for more lived 
experience -led research  [19] and person -centred care [20-21]. 
Neurodiversity refers to the diversity of human minds that naturally exists in our society [22]. 
Neurodivergence refers to individuals who have a neurocognitive profile that diverges from 
the majority (i.e., atypical), whereas neurotypical people are those whose neurocognitive 
profile is considered aligned with the majority (i.e., typical) [23]. There are many forms of 
neurodivergence, such as, but not limited to, autism , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) , Tourette’s syndrome, giftedness, dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, and intellectual 
disability (ID)  [11, 24 ]. 
Neuronormativity relies on the assumptions and beliefs which uphold neurotypical privilege 
–an ideologically oppressive framework which views some personality and neurocognitive 
traits as inherently superior to and more valuable than others [25-26]. The neurodiversity 
paradigm, however, rejects the assumption of there being a singular ‘normal’  personality or  
neurocognitive profile and opposes the pathology paradigm, whereby those who do not fit 
within the narrow socially constructed understanding of ‘normal ’ are perceived deficient, 
disordered, and in dire need of fixing or curing [27-29]. In this view, the neurodiversity 
paradigm argues that difference should not be regarded as inherently pathological and that the 
diversity of human minds should be accepted  and accommodated for [27, 30 ]. 
Research has highlighted high co -occurrence rates between autism, ADHD , and EDs [31-32]. 
Preliminary research has also associated other forms of neurodivergence, such as ID [33] and

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
7 Tourette’s syndrome [34-35], with disordered eating. Yet, the mechanisms underlying links 
between neurodivergence and EDs remain understudied and poorly understood; for instance, 
there is limited research on the intersectional nature of ED risk  factors  for neurodivergent 
individuals ( NDI). Subsequently, NDI are shown to experience poorer ED treatment 
outcomes compared to neurotypical people [36-37, 87]. 
While there have been calls to include lived experience expertise at the core of  mental health 
research [38], participatory and phenomenological research methods are rarely utilised in the 
context of EDs [19, 39-41]. With all co -authors being neurodivergent and having lived or 
living experience of an ED, our narrative review aims to provide a lived experience -based 
conceptual map to serve as a starting point for future empirical work. A high -level summary 
of the co -occurring prevalence rates between neurodivergence and EDs is first provided, 
followed by a thematic investigation of key factors underlying ED risk for NDI. Additionally, 
a critical appraisal of current ED research and treatments is provided before 
recommendations for neurodiversity -affirming (NDA) ED care are discussed.  
 
4. METHODS AND CONTRIBUTIONS  
A narrative review methodology was selected to provide a broad descriptive framework for 
this topic, suitable to the overall limited status of literature published to date. In addition, the 
narrative review is intentionally informed by the lived experiences of the authorship team, all 
of whom are ED re searchers and/or clinicians, providing perspectives and insights with the 
aim of promoting further conversation and inspiring future research and clinical 
considerations.

EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
8 For section five , two databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) were searched (11/03/2024 
and 07/06/2024) for prevalence data specific to the co -occurrence discussed (e.g., 
autism/EDs, ADHD/EDs). Search terms involved a type of neurodivergence (e.g., autism, 
ADHD, Tourette’s syndrome, giftedness) alongside ‘eating disorder’ or ‘feeding disorder’. 
Specific subsections on prevalence were contributed by authors RE (psychosis and OCD) and 
LC (autism, ADHD, Tourette’s Syndrome, ID, giftedness). The most recent syste matic 
reviews and meta -analyses were selected: here, if no systematic reviews and meta -analyses 
were identified, the most recent studies were discussed. However, there were instances where 
no recent studies assessing prevalence were found, in which case it  was highlighted that 
research evidence is limited.  
Section six  provides a thematic framework whereby factors underlying ED risk in relation to 
neurodivergence are identified. Co -authors contributed to themes that matched areas of their 
lived experience, interest, and/or academic expertise; for example, sexuality and gender 
diversity (authored by SS, with initial outlining by KS), sex diversity (co -authored by SS and 
KS), giftedness, systemic discrimination, and psychoneuroimmunology (author RE), and 
sensory processing, executive functioning, systemic discri mination, and 
psychoneuroimmunology (author LC). Sensory processing and executive functioning 
differences are discussed first due to their core overarching nature across neurodivergence. 
Individual characteristics, such as gender identity, sexual orientati on, and giftedness follow. 
Intersectional factors like systemic discrimination and chronic illnesses are then investigated.  
Section seven  consolidates the evidence and positionality to identify current gaps in research 
and practice (authored by LC), while section eight  provides suggestions for neurodiversity -
affirming eating disorder care (co -authored by LC and AR). Furthermore, all co -authors 
contributed to revision and editing of this narrative review.

9 5. OVERVIEW OF PREVALENCE DATA  
Gillberg  [42] was the first to suggest an association between autism and EDs. Throughout the 
1990s and early 2000s, sporadic studies have discussed the co -occurrence of EDs and 
neurodivergence; for example, Fisman et al. [43] found an overlap between obsessive -
compulsive traits and anorexia nervosa (AN), Gravestock [44] highlighted an association 
between ID and binge eating disorder (BED), and Surman et al. [45] posited a link between 
ADHD and bulimia nervosa (BN). There has been an acceleration of research on this topic in 
the past decade, consistently reporting high co -occurrence rates between autism and  ADHD 
with various ED diagnoses – namely, AN, BN, BED, and avoidant/restrictive food intake 
disorder (ARFID) [31-32]. Overall, there is a high degree of overlap and co -occurrence 
between many forms of neurodivergence  [28, 46-47], however, transdiagnostic research 
regarding forms of neurodivergence other than autism and ADHD in relation to EDs is 
limited. As such, the  evidence below is presented as a high -level summary within the most 
investigated  forms of neurodivergence in relation to EDs – namely autism, ADHD, Tourette’s 
syndrome, obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD), psychosis, ID, and giftedness.  
Despite the increased attention toward EDs in autistic and ADHD populations, there are 
limitations to estimating co-occurring prevalence rates . Indeed, there is accumulating 
evidence showing NDI assigned female at birth (AFAB) being erroneously diagnosed with 
borderline personality disorder [48-51]. One leading argument for such under - and/or 
misdiagnosis is gender biases in diagnostic instruments and practice [52-56]. Research also 
suggests that autism and ADHD are underdiagnosed in racially marginalised individuals due 
to a combination of barriers accessing assessments and ethnocentrism embedded in 
diagnostic measures [57-58]. Moreover, research shows that autism and ADHD are more

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
10 likely to be misdiagnosed as conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and/or 
oppositional defiant disorder in racially marginalised communities [59-64]. 
Relatedly, psychometric instruments commonly used for assessing eating psychopathology, 
as well as body image -related constructs, have not been tailored to, nor validated for, NDI 
[see 6 5-66]. Therefore , it is possible that ED measures  predominantly  used today , such as the 
Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire or the Eating Attitudes Test, do not accurately 
capture EDs and body image disturbances as experienced by NDI [see 6 5-66]. There is also a 
paucity of transdiagnostic research investigating neurodivergence and EDs, despite evidenced 
overlaps between many forms of neurodivergence [46], such as co -occurring autism and 
ADHD [67], leading to a significant knowledge gap regarding ED pres entation  and course of 
illness  in these populations.  
5.1. Autism  
Systematic and meta -analytic reviews have consistently highlighted a strong link between 
autism and AN: Huke et al. [68] found the prevalence of autism among those with AN 
varying between 8 -37% while  Boltri & Sapuppo [69] identified a prevalence range between 
8.8-24.5%. Additionally, between 8.2 -54.8% of children with ARFID are autistic [31], while 
21% of autistic people are deemed at risk of developing ARFID based on a genome -wide 
association study [70]. Furthermore, u ndiagnosed ARFID in autistic children represents a risk 
factor for malnutrition and death [71], highlighting the urgent need for systematic ED 
screening in autistic children. Between 14-36% of autistic children also show pica behaviours 
[72-73]. Although research has so far focused mostly on dietary restriction in relation to 
autism, there is emerging evidence linking autistic traits with all forms of disordered eating, 
including bingeing  behaviours  [74-75].

EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
11 5.2. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder  
There is a significant association between ADHD and EDs. Indeed, in a recent review which 
included five cross -sectional studies, Villa et al. [32] found that 31.37% of children and 
adolescent patients with an ADHD diagnosis presented with BED, 19.23% with BN, and 
9.38% with AN. Additionally, a meta -analysis found that the prevalence of ADHD in adults 
with EDs was 3 -16.2% for AN, 9 -34.9% for BN, and 19.8% for BED [76]. Here, ADHD 
traits were also found to predict binge eating and bulimic symptoms’ severity, even after 
controlling for anxiety and depression [76]. Moreover, in a study involving 1165 adults 
diagnosed with an ED, Svedlund et al. [37] found that 37% of individuals with AN and 35% 
of those with BN scored above the cut -off on the Adult ADHD Self -Report Scale  [77]. While 
prevalence has not been established, research suggests that children with ADHD present an 
increased risk of loss of control of eating  compared to children without ADHD  [32, 78]. High 
incidence of ADHD has also been observed in adolescents [79] and adults [80] seeking 
weight management surgery.  
5.3. Intellectual Disability   
There is limited research investigating ID in relation to EDs, in part driven by the lack of 
adapted ED assessment tools in the context of ID [see 8 1]. Additionally, there is high 
heterogeneity, with differing reported ED incidences between people with ID living in the 
community (1 -19%) compared to those who reside in care institutions (3 -42%) [44]. Another 
study showed that 27% of people with ID had an ED, with BED being the most prevalent 
[82]. In a study of children with ID, Gal, Hardal -Nasser, and Engel -Yeger [33] found that 
97% of participants had at least one eating or feeding problem (i.e., food refusal, food 
selectivity, dysphagia, rumination, binge eating). Furthermore, a systematic review

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
12 highlighted a high incidence of swallowing problems (e.g., aspiration, dysphagia) 
contributing to malnutrition in adults with ID [83]. 
5.4. Tourette’s Syndrome, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Psychosis, and Giftedness  
There is limited data regarding the co -occurrence of Tourette’s syndrome and EDs. However, 
one study estimated that the lifetime prevalence for EDs was 2% for those with Tourette’s, 
with females (7%) more at risk than males (0.3%) [84]. Furthermore, studies have highlighted 
a high incidence of disordered eating  and feeding challenges  for children with Tourette’s 
syndrome [34 -35]. For obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD), meta -analytic prevalence 
estimates report co -occurrence of OCD in EDs being 13.9 –18%, with greater frequency in 
AN [85-86]. In comparison to neurotypical individuals experiencing an ED, individuals with 
OCD or those with elevated OCD traits are at greater risk of more severe ED 
symptomatology and poorer ED treatment outco mes [87]. Research on the co -occurrence 
rates of psychotic spectrum disorders and EDs is also limited; however, higher levels of co -
occurrence between these two diagnostic groups have been indicated compared to the general 
population [88]. Indeed, a systematic review showed higher rates of disordered eating 
compared to controls in individuals with schizophrenia, with disordered eating behaviours 
observed in 10 -41.5% of patients [89]. Moreover, transient psychosis occurs in EDs 
secondary to malnutrition, electrolyte imbalance, metabolic disturbance, and re -nutrition  [90-
91] and incidence of transient psychosis among ED patients has been estimated to be 10 -15% 
[91]. Lastly, some studies have suggested a link between giftedness and EDs, with g ifted 
individuals thought to be at a high risk of developing EDs; however, there is no prevalence 
data available [92-98].

EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
13 5.5. Conclusion  
While clear associations between autism, ADHD, and EDs have been highlighted, more 
investigations are needed with regards to other forms of neurodivergence. Additionally, 
despite many forms of neurodivergence  overlapping and  co-occurring , there is limited 
transdiagnostic research investigating neurodivergence and EDs. Nonetheless, estimating 
prevalence remains challenging due to issues such as NDI being misdiagnosed with 
personality disorders and lack of ED -focused psychometric instruments tailored to, and 
validated for, NDI.  
 
6. NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING 
DISORDERS  
The reasons underlying NDI being at a high risk of disordered eating and/or EDs are varied, 
complex, and multifaceted, and encompass a wide range of interconnected environmental, 
psychosocial, and biological factors. NDI experience the world differently in a myriad of 
ways, as illustrated by differences in sensory processing, c ommunication and socialising 
(e.g., the double empathy problem), thinking and learning styles (e.g., monotropism, inertia), 
gender identity, sexual orientation, sex diversity, and executive functioning [99-101]. 
Together, these differences may contribute, either directly or indirectly, to  a wide array of 
pathways potentially contributing to  the development of disordered eating, EDs, and/or body 
image disturbances for NDI [9, 19, 101-103]. 
The section below outlines several  common neurodivergent experiences that may contribute 
to elevated ED risk. The available evidence has been integrated with the lived and living

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
14 experiences of the authorship team to provide a framework for future work on this emerging 
topic within the ED field.  
6.1. Sensory Processing  
Sensory processing differences encompassing exteroception (related to external stimuli such 
as sounds or tastes), interoception (related to internal stimuli such as thirst, pain, or hunger), 
and alexithymia (the ability to recognise and/or describe affecti ve states and associated 
physiological sensations) are core overarching characteristics associated with  
neurodivergence  [104-112]. Collectively, atypical sensory processing patterns are linked to 
EDs as well as body image disturbances, irrespective of neurotype [113-115]. Additionally, 
research shows that atypical sensory processing, as experienced by autistic people more 
specifically, is strongly associated with disordered eating [116-118].  
Exteroception and interoception influence cognitive processes such as goal -directed 
behaviours (e.g., eating, drinking), motor control and coordination, memory, learning, 
motivation, self -perception, and emotional awareness and responsiveness, and are tied  to 
neurobiological systems, particularly thalamo -cortical connectivity [119-121]. The thalamus 
is located at the centre of the brain and has historically been perceived as a passive relay 
centre for sensory information, including interoception and exteroception (except for 
olfaction, which is routed through the olfactory bulb) [122]. However, a growing body of 
evidence shows that the thalamus plays a more active and important role in many cognitive 
functions than previously thought, including regarding  memory and attentional control [123-
124], executive functioning [125], and emotional processing (e.g., thalamo -limbic 
connectivity) [126]. More recently, neuroscience research has suggested the thalamus to be 
involved in a wide range of psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder,

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
15 post-traumatic  stress disorder, substance abuse) [127-129], including EDs [130-132]. 
Atypical sensory processing likely underlies differences in eating processes and habits as well 
as vulnerability to ED development [see 13 3, pp. 22 -23]. 
There are different ways in which atypical sensory processing may lead to eating difficulties 
and/or disorders. Exteroception may contribute to dietary restriction resulting from  aversions 
whereas sensory seeking and associated cravings tied to specific tastes or textures may 
underlie bingeing [113]. Heightened exteroception (e.g., hyperacusis, misophonia) may also 
be contributing to the preference for eating alone to avoid sensory overwhelm [134-135]. 
Moreover, interoception may impact eating through the modulation of hunger and satiety; for 
instance, feeling full after consuming small amounts of food may underlie restriction whereas 
delayed satiety may promote bingeing and/or eating in the absence of  hunger [113]. 
Interoception further plays an important role in body image and has been associated with 
body image disturbances [102, 136-137]. Research has also associated alexithymia, which is 
connected to interoception, with binge eating behaviours (often referred to as ‘emotional 
eating ) [138-139]. Specifically, Vuillier et al. [140] found that alexithymia could partially 
explain the high prevalence of EDs in autistic people.  
Eating a restricted range of foods is often framed as an ED symptom. While this phenomenon 
may reflect psychopathology for some, qualitative research shows that, for autistic people, it 
may be an adaptive and self -regulatory mechanism to prevent sensory di stress, cognitive 
overwhelm, and mealtime anxiety [103, 141-142]. Indeed, research suggests that autistic 
people do not habituate to sensory stimuli in the same ways as non -autistic people [143-144]. 
In the context of such reduced habituation, coercing autistic people to eat aversive foods may 
be experienced as traumatic and unintentionally exacerbate feeding difficulties (e.g., food 
phobia ) [145]. It is therefore critical to take the different ways NDI experience eating and

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
16 feeding from a sensory perspective into account for ED identification, care, and recovery [9, 
10, 19, 36]. 
6.2. Executive Functioning  
Executive functioning differences (e.g., task initiation, memory, demand avoidance) are 
influenced by sensory processing patterns [146] and are observed in many NDI [147]. 
Executive functioning differences are also linked to EDs [148-149]; for example, executive 
functioning differences may contribute to difficulties related to remembering to eat, grocery 
shopping, meal preparation, consistently following a meal plan, and/or choosing what to eat 
[113, 101, 141]. Such difficulties may promote restrict -binge cycles, whereby forgetting to 
eat or being unable to organise meal preparation leads to prolonged periods of time without 
eating, which may be followed by compensatory bingeing episodes  [101]. Additionally, given 
that many autistic people have a literal, or concrete, thinking style [23, 150], dichotomous 
portrayals of ‘healthy’ or ‘good’ versus ‘unhealthy’ or ‘bad’ foods a ssociated with diet 
culture and public health messages may contribute to fixations towards foods considered 
‘healthy’ (e.g., orthorexia ) [101, 151-152]. 
6.3. Gende r, Sexuality, and Sex -Diversity  
People with a diverse sex, sexuality, and/or gender identity are more likely to be autistic 
and/or have ADHD [153-159] and face a high risk of EDs and body image disturbances [160-
161]. Factors contributing to the increased risk of EDs among neurotypical sex, sexuality, and 
gender diverse people include gender dysphoria, internalised cis -heterosexist ideals, and 
minority stress [133, 160, 162-168]. In contrast, identity pride, community conn ectedness, 
and gender -affirming health care can be protective  factors  [133, 160, 166, 169].

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
17 Trans people experience disproportionate rates of EDs compared to cisgender individuals  
[162-164, 170]. EDs, in this context, may function  as a way  to manage gender dysphoria; for 
instance, restrictive eating can delay the onset of puberty or minimise the appearance of 
secondary sex characteristics [162-164]. ED risk for trans people is further exacerbated by 
minority stressors, including discrimination and social exclusion, which can lead to 
heightened body dissatisfaction and increased engagement in ED behaviours [171]. 
Additionally, high levels of gender dysphoria are observed in the autistic population, partially 
mediated by atypical sensory processing, contributing to greater difficulties in coping with 
gender incongruence and body image disturbances [157, 172-174]. 
Variations of sex characteristics (VSC) – otherwise referred to as intersex – are differences in 
innate sex characteristics that differ from social and medical norms [175]. In a study of 1022 
people with VSC, 8.8% had a diagnosis of autism, 9.1% had high autistic traits, and 4.1% 
screened positive for ADHD [155]. Higher autistic trait scores were associated with lower 
self-esteem in participants with Turner Syndrome, Klinefelter Syndrome, and female 
participants with 46XY variations with and without androgenisation [155]. Additionally, 
higher ADHD trait scores were associated with poorer body image in participants with 
Turner Syndrome, female participants 46XY variations wit h and without androgenisation, 
and male participants with 46XY variations [155]. ED diagnoses were reported in 11.1% of 
the overall sample (3.7 times higher than the general population) ; however, stratified data of 
ED diagnoses for autistic intersex people and those with ADHD were not provided [155]. 
Intersectionality plays a crucial role in understanding elevated ED risk for NDI who are also 
members of the LGBTQIA+ community, highlighting the need for targeted interventions and 
support systems that address the unique intersections of neurodivergen t and LGBTQIA+ 
identities [153, 161]; for example, by acknowledging that dietary restriction may stem from

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
18 different motivations in this population  (e.g., sensory and gender dysphoria -based) , 
underscoring the importance of neurodiversity -affirming ED care also being gender -
affirming.  
6.4. Giftedness and Twice -Exceptionality  
Giftedness, which refers to outstanding intellectual and/or creative potential [176], may 
represent a  risk for ED development through perfectionism, low self -esteem, striving to 
achieve social acceptance, and avoiding ostracization and rejection  [177-179]. Obsessive 
perfectionism may develop in gifted people within the context of interpersonal trauma and 
marginalisation, wherein an individual pursues creative and/or intellectual achievements as a 
survival process to protect autonomy, identity and individuality, and to anestheti se 
psychological pain [180-182]. High academic and/or creative achievement in the context of 
giftedness may be an asset to accepting uniqueness and social difference; however, this may 
become a burden when an individual's emotional vulnerability and associated need for 
support are not recognised and addressed [183]. Twice -exceptional people (i.e., people who 
are both disabled and gifted, such as those with co -occurring giftedness and dyslexia and/or 
ADHD) may also experience psychosocial vulnerability and imposter syndrome due to 
asynchrony – referring to disparities between ones’ chronological and developmental 
trajectories, belongingness with peers, a nd expectations [177]. Perfectionism and disordered 
eating may be an attempt to cope with the psychosocial distress [see 18 4] associated with 
such asynchrony  [97, 177, 185]. Twice -exceptionality may also present a social and identity 
threat, due to experience of being 'twice different'  [186]; thereby, disordered eating may serve 
as a social survival strategy to fit in with peers through striving toward societal body ideals  
[177] and  alleviate the existential angst that may accompany fears of failure and/or imposter 
syndrom e [18 7].

19 6.5. Systemic Discrimination, Inequity, and Trauma  
NDI commonly experience systemic oppression and discrimination across  varying settings 
and contexts (e.g., edu cation, healthcare, employment ) [188-195]. Such forms of systemic 
discrimination increase the likelihood of unemployment [196], houselessness [1 97], and food 
and nutrition insecurity [19 8-199], therefore contributing to psychosocial distress  and mental 
ill-health [ 200 ], including EDs [201]. Indeed, high rates of houselessness and unemployment 
have been reported for NDI [196, 198, 202-205]. The risk for autistic people to be food 
insecure is four times greater c ompared to non -autistic people [19 8]. Moreover, a systematic 
review highlighted that between 10 -40% of adults with ID experience d houselessness [206]. 
Food insecurity is a known ED ri sk factor, particularly for BN [20 7-209].  
Rejection and stigmatisation are common experiences for NDI, and negatively impact on 
self-esteem and psychosocial wellbeing [210-212]. Rejection and stigmatisation are often 
rooted in deficit -based and dehumanising stereotypes, such as that autistic people ‘lack 
empathy’ and ‘social skills’ [213-216] or that those with ADHD are ‘lazy’ and ‘attention 
seeking’ [217-218]. Resultantly, NDI are prone to internalise such stigma and may hide their 
authentic selves to avoid being rejected and bullied – a phenomenon referred to as masking  or 
camouflaging  [219]. Masking is associated with loss of sense of self and identity confusion 
[220], which are known risk factors for EDs [221]. Furthermore, substantive evidence 
supports the link between masking and poor mental health outcomes  in autistic people,  such 
as anxiety, self -harm, suicide [222-225], and risk of EDs [151, 226]. 
NDI have been found to experience higher rates of interpersonal victimisation, including 
domestic abuse  and sexual violence, compared to neurotypical individuals  [227-231]. For 
example, nine out of ten autistic women [232] or those with an ID [233] report having been

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
20 sexually assaulted, which is three times more than neurotypical women. Additionally, a 
systematic review suggested that those with ADHD were more likely to have experienced 
child hood  sexual abuse compared to those without ADHD [234]. Such experiences of 
victimisation are relevant as interpersonal trauma, including sexual abuse, have been found to 
substantially increase the risk of EDs [201, 235-237]. 
There is emerging evidence suggesting that autistic people experience post -traumatic stress 
triggered by factors not currently conceptualised within psychiatric nosology as inherently 
traumatic [238-241]; for example, some autistic people may experience post-traumatic  stress 
resulting from  repeated exposures to aversive sensory input  (e.g., sounds, smells, tastes , 
textures ) [145]. It is estimated that up to 60% of autistic people suffer from post-traumatic  
stress disorder in their lifetime [241], with many thought to be misdiagnosed (e.g., borderline 
personality disorder) and not receiving the trauma -informed care they nee d [49 -50, 23 9]. 
Since post -traumatic stress disorder is a known contributor to the development of EDs [242], 
the delayed identification and delivery of compassionate treatment of trauma may therefore 
exacerbate the vulnerability towards developing EDs for autistic people.  
Intersecting experiences of marginalisation and structural oppression (i.e., racism and 
ethnocentrism, ableism, gender binarism, sexism, cis -heterosexism, and sizeism) may 
compound ED risk [237, 243-244]. Indeed, i n Nelson et al.’s [23 7] longitudinal study 
involving 331 undergraduate students, different forms of discrimination such as racism, 
weight stigma, and sexism all predicted body image dissatisfaction and disordered eating. 
The patterns of disordered eating were different depending on the type(s) of discrimination 
experienced [237], highlighting the importance of considering the influence of intersecting 
factors of identity, oppressive power structures, and trauma experiences in ED development 
and recovery, irrespective of neurotype [20].

EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
21 6.6. Chronic Illness and Psychoneuroimmunology  
NDI experience chronic medical illnesses at higher rates than neurotypicals [245-247]. The 
range of such medical conditions include, but are not limited to, Ehlers -Danlos syndrome, 
postural tachycardia syndrome [248], diabetes type 2 [249], polycystic ovarian syndrome 
[250], endometriosis  [251], asthma , dermatitis, food allergies [252-253], gut microbiome 
dysbiosis  [254-255], and gastrointestinal disorders  [256-257]. There is emerging evidence 
suggesting a bidirectional relationship between the aforementioned conditions and EDs; 
indeed, experiencing one of the conditions listed above may increase  the risk of developing 
an ED later in life, while having an ED may increase  the risk of developing one of the 
aforementioned conditions later in life [258-263]. 
Furthermore, there is growing evidence from the field of psychoneuroimmunology 
suggesting that psychological stressors, including in relation to systemic discrimination, 
interpersonal victimisation, and childhood  trauma, may be a key factor  in immune and gut -
brain dysregulation  [264-267]. It has been suggested that the  link between psychological 
stress and gut -brain and immune dysregulation is rooted in the mechanism whereby stress 
activates corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) which, in turn, triggers the degranulation of 
mast cells [268-270]. More specifically, research points to  a bidirectional relationship 
between the immune system, particularly mast cells and histamine [271-272], and a wide 
range of psychiatric disorders [273-274], including EDs [26 2, 275-277]. Some research also 
posits  that this relationship may be mediated by histamine playing a role in the modulation of 
dopamine neurons’ firing rates in the brain [278], particularly in the thalamic region [279-
280]. Histamine further influences glucose and lipid metabolism [281], leptin and ghrelin 
activity (i.e., appetite, fullness) [282], digestion [283], and control of arousal and energy 
expenditure (i.e., homeostasis), including propensity towards exercising [284-286]. As noted

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
22 by Keeler et al. [28 7], “infections, autoimmune diseases, and stress -related alterations in the 
immune system influence brain circuits and neurotransmitters involved in appetite and mood 
regulation”.  
6.7. Conclusion  
There are many intersectional factors underlying NDI being at a high risk of experiencing 
disordered eating and/or developing EDs. This underscores the importance of investigating 
ED risk through a holistic, intersectional, and lived experience -led lens.  Taking these 
intertwined factors into account in treatment formulation is also of great importance to 
improve ED care individuatio n. 
 
7. GAPS IN RESEARCH AND PRACTICE  
EDs are psychiatric disorders with significant negative consequences on psychosocial 
wellbeing and physical health [288]. Despite this, our current understanding of mechanisms 
for ED risk, development, maintenance, and relapse remain  poorly understood, irrespective of 
neurotype [18, 28 9]. 
While manualised psycho -behavioural mental health approaches, such as cognitive -
behavioural therapy (CBT), are often promoted as first-line ‘evidence -based’ treatments for 
most mental illnesses, including EDs [17-18], there are a range of issues that impact the 
generalisability of such broad claims [290]. Identified issues include publication bias [291-
293], selective reporting [294-295], undisclosed conflicts of interest [296-297, see 298], 
under -reporting of adverse effects [299-301], lack of long -term follow -up studies [18, 30 2], 
and lack of participatory, lived experience -led, research [39, 41, 303].

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
23 Indeed, psycho -behavioural treatments considered as the ‘gold standard’  in the context of 
EDs – namely, CBT (for adults) and family -based therapy (FBT; for young people) – have 
consistently been shown to lead to less than half of people with EDs reaching long -term 
recovery overal l [17-18, 30 4]. There is also emergent evidence showing that NDI, more 
specifically, have poorer ED treatment experiences and outcomes compared to neurotypical 
individuals [87, 305-310]. 
7.1. Reporting of adverse effects and risk assessments  
Insight into both intervention efficacy and risk of harm is essential to the practice of 
evidence -based medicine ; indeed, as noted by Junqueira et al. [311], “treatment decisions rely 
on accurate knowledge of both efficacy and harms”. However, adverse effects related to 
psycho -behavioural treatments for mental ill -health frequently lack systematic assessment 
and transparent reporting in research, subsequently  skewing eviden ce regarding risk -benefit 
ratio [299-300, 312-315]. For example, in a systematic meta -review of meta -analyses of ED 
treatments, adverse events were only acknowledged  in the context of pharmacology [31 6]. 
Furthermore, Linardon et al. [31 7] conducted a systematic review and meta -analysis to assess 
the efficacy of CBT for treating EDs where they deemed CBT to be efficacious despite 
omitting to discuss measures of short and long -term harms. Iatrogenesis, that is, harm 
resulting from healthcare practices, may not manif est immediately and be delayed [29 9], in 
which case it would only be captured in long -term follow up studies. Late onset iatrogenic 
harm is therefore missed by the lack of long -term follow -up studies in ED research  [see 18]. 
Subsequently, lack of reported iatrogenic harm in the literature is mistakenly interpreted as 
evidence of no harm [ see 301], leading mental health practitioners under -resourced to 
recognise and address iatrogenesis from psycho -behavioural treatments [see 300, 318 ], 
including in the context of neurodivergence  [36, 319-321].

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
24 There is an increasing number of community resources where NDI with lived experience of 
EDs report having experienced  iatrogenic harm from ED treatments, including psychological 
trauma [322-326]. Unfortunately, such narratives are seldom reflected in published mental 
health clinical trials and meta -analyses. Biases undervaluing qualitative, phenomenological, 
and lived experience -led research have been suggested to contribute to such narratives not 
being adequately discussed in mental health research [327-328]. Nonetheless, there is 
growing recognition that psycho -behavioural treatments can be harmful to NDI [318-319, 
329], including in the context of EDs [19, 309, 330 -331]. 
7.2. Neurodivergent Leadership and Representation: Who is Creating The ‘Evidence’ 
and Who is the ‘Evidence’  For?  
According to Curnow et al.’s  [332] umbrella review investigating the overall suitability of 
currently available mental health therapies in the context of autism, no existing mental health 
framework can claim to be NDA; a conclusion that has also be highlighted in the ED context 
[10, 36, 309]. There are two main factors, discussed below, playing into this: namely , the lack 
of representation of NDI in mental health research and the lack of non -tokenistic, lived 
experience -led, participatory research. Indeed, “inclusive research practice characterized by 
the involvement of neurodivergent people in meaningful roles ha s been described as a 
‘requirement of excellen ce’ in neurodiversity research” [33 3]. 
Participatory research methods which are led by individuals with lived experience are rarely  
utilised in ED research [39-41] or in mental health research more broadly [334-337, pp. 179 -
180].  It has been suggested that participatory research methods have potential to improve 
overall mental health outcomes for NDI  [336, 338-340], including in relation to EDs [ 19, 40]. 
Indeed, participatory research methods have been shown to facilitate the translation of

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
25 findings into real -world contexts and ensure that the research yields relevant and meaningful 
benefits for the community [340]. 
The neurodivergent community, and other marginalised communities (e.g., gender diverse 
folks) [341], are not adequately represented in ED research [10, 19, 40]. The lack of 
neurodivergen t representation is not limited to EDs; for e xample, Jubenville -Wood et al. 
[303] noted that “limited research exists that examines the experiences of autistic individuals 
in psychotherapy.” The neglect of intersectionality in ED research further extends to co -
occurring mental illnesses, despite a majority of those with an ED also bein g diagnosed wit h 
another psychiatric condition [3 42]. This is particularly relevant in the context of 
neurodivergence as NDI are shown to experience mental illnesses , including other than EDs,  
at significantly higher rates compared to neurotypical individuals  [343-347]. 
A greater focus on participatory research that takes an intersectional lens is indicated to better 
understand the connections between neurodivergence and EDs and improve ED prevention 
efforts and treatment outcomes for NDI [10, 40, 174, 264, 331 ]. 
7.3. One Size Does Not Fit All  
The indiscriminate use of a narrow range of manualised therapies, assessment tools, and 
public health campaigns for different demographic groups, such as NDI, gender and/or 
sexually diverse people, and racially marginalised individuals, is problematic, as each group 
experiences unique underlying factors to the development of EDs and may require different, 
sometimes conflicting or opposing, forms of support and formulations to recover [see 10, 
174, 348 -349]. As outlined in section six , NDI, as well as those with other minority and/or 
marginalised identities, have been found to have divergent feeding, eating, and ED 
experiences. However, hegemonic conceptualisations of feeding, eating, and EDs do not

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
26 incorporate such diversity of lived experiences, a limitation that impacts all stages of ED care 
[see 10, 174, 348 -349]. 
Evidence -based medicine requires that clinicians consider  research evidence, clinical 
expertise, and patient preferences when  deciding on a course of action [3 50]. Indeed, ED 
clinical guidelines identify a narrow range of ‘evidence -based’ ED interventions, many of 
which are manualised, whilst also acknowledging the important role of person -centred 
approaches to ED care [351-352]. This is a realistic goal when the manualised treatments are 
informed by diverse and representative samples that adequately capture divergent experiences 
and account for them. However, given the traditional misrepresentation of authentic and 
inherently ad aptive neurodivergent eating and feeding experiences as pathological, and the 
historical and ongoing legacy of epistemic injustice silencing neurodivergent (and other 
marginalised) voices in ED research [ see 19, 40, 164, 174, 348 -349], it appears that 
oppressive and unequal power dynamics have contributed to the lack of more affirming, 
innovative, and inclusive conceptualisations of and interventions for EDs, setting the scene 
for the monopolisation of ED research by a limited number of manualised intervent ions (e.g., 
CBT, FBT), despite their lacklustre success rates  [see 17-18, 304].  
Importantly, this legacy of epistemic injustice places ED clinicians who are attempting to 
translate research evidence into clinical practice in a double bind: on the one hand, clinicians  
must practice in accordance with ED clinical guidelines which identify a narrow range of 
suitable ED treatment approaches, typically manualised, that they can choose from, whilst 
simultaneously being asked to practice person -centred care that, if followed , is not likely to 
fit neatly into the prescribed formulation and tre atment plan laid out in the approved 
manualised interventions.

27 The RAVES model (an acronym representing regular eating, adequacy, variety, enjoyment, 
and social eating) is a clinical tool that is commonly used by dietitians [353]. Whilst the 
intervention targets identified in this clinical tool appear logical when framing eating through 
a neuronormative lens, they do not align with lived -experience informed conceptualisations 
of adaptive neurodivergent feeding and eating experienc es, such as preference for sameness 
[142], sensory -related food variety constraints [ see 9, 40, 151], and preference to eat alone  
[134], and risks invalidating authentic and adaptive neurodivergent feeding and eating 
support needs and preferences if applied indiscriminately [101].  
Food -related exposure -based techniques, typically used in tandem with psycho -behavioural 
ED treatments such as FBT and CBT [see 354], risk causing sensory overwhelm, distress, or 
even sensory trauma when they fail to account for and accommodate divergent sensory 
processing profiles [see 142, 145 ], particularly in light of the evidence showing that sensory 
habituation is attenuated amongst autistic individuals  [143, 355 -356]. 
Research demonstrates that those with atypical AN experience similar psychopathology, 
illness severity, and medical risks to those with typical AN, regardless of weight status [357-
359]. The current weight -centric conceptualisation of AN recovery is thus problematic, 
particularly for autistic people who report that weight is not the most predominant factor 
contributing to their food restriction [9, 10, 141,  151, 174, 309 ]. Indeed, research 
investigating treatments for AN, including CBT, mainly focuses on we ight gain as a main 
indicator of recovery and a primary outcome measure for treatment effectiveness [36-361], 
despite growing evidence that weight does not measure recovery and that focusing on weight 
in this manner contributes to weight stigma (e.g., being turned away from health services due 
to being perceived as ‘not being sick enough’) [362-364] and iatrogenic harm [365] . 
Furthermore, qualitative research shows that people with lived experience commonly

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
28 emphasise the importance of supportive interpersonal connections, strengths -based sense of 
identity, finding meaning and purpose in life, and orienting towards self -compassion as 
central factors supporting ED recovery, more so than weight  [21].  
7.4. Conclusion  
Current psycho -behavioural frameworks for treating EDs, such as FBT and CBT, are often 
broadly promoted as effective and ‘evidence -based’, despite meta -analytic evidence 
consistently demonstrating only less than half of people who access these treatments 
experience long -term recovery, irrespective of neurotype. Additionally, evidence shows that 
autistic people and those with ADHD experience poorer treatment outcomes compared to 
neurotypical people; unfortunately, there is a paucity of empirical evidence fo r other types of 
neurodivergence. Issues relating to lack of long -term follow -up data, limited assessment and 
reporting of iatrogenesis, undisclosed conflicts of interest, and protocol and publication 
biases, have been identified as factors to consider whe n interpreting efficacy claims  in this 
context . More specifically, participatory research methods are seldom used in ED research 
and NDI are rarely represented or taken into consideration in treatments’ design and 
implementation, as are other marginalised communities, thus significantly undermining the 
validity of ‘evidence -based’ mental healthcare  for a more diverse range of people. 
Furthermore, ED research rarely takes a holistic lens that acknowledges intersectional factors, 
as outlined in section six, needing to be considered in treatment formulations, leading to gross 
oversimplifications in manualised treatment frameworks that do not account for the fact that 
different people and communities have different, and sometimes conflicting, support needs.

29 8. WHAT DOES NEURODIVERSITY -AFFIRMING EATING DISORDER CARE 
ENTAIL?  
The concept of NDA care is grounded in the principles of the neurodiversity paradigm which 
views neurodiversity as a natural and valuable form of human diversity, rejecting the idea 
that there is a singular ‘normal’ personality and  neurocognitive profile that all humans should 
universally aspire to and emulate [22]. An NDA mental healthcare framework, therefore, is a 
holistic and person -centred  framework rooted in the principles of phenomenology, epistemic 
justice, and cultural humility [339, 366-371]. NDA ED care requires that ED clinicians 
engage in ongoing self -reflection to challenge biases and neuronormative assumptions, social 
norms, beliefs, and goals that further perpetuate the pathologi sation and systemic oppression 
of NDI [40, 101, 174, 264]. Crucially, NDA ED care necessitates clinicians be able to 
differentiate neurodivergent traits from ED symptoms, understand the underlying reasons and 
adaptive mechanisms of neurodivergent traits, and validate and accommodate the 
individualised support need s of NDI, such as with regards to sensory processing, 
communication, and executive functioning, rather than attempt to ‘fix’ these at the expense of 
overall wellbeing and self -determination [see 40, 101, 174, 264, 372 ]. 
8.1. Overview of currently available neurodivergent -specific psychometric assessments 
and treatment adaptations  
Specific assessment tools have been developed to improve the identification of feeding and 
eating difficulties, and related psychopathology, amongst autistic individuals (Swedish Eating 
Assessment for Autism spectrum disorders [373]; Body Appreciation Scale 2 for Autistic 
Adults  [65]; Autism Eating Questionnaire  [374]; Brief Autism Mealtime Inventory 
Assessment  [375-376]. To the authors’ knowledge, no assessment tools have been developed

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
30 or adapted to target eating  or body image  psychopathology associated with other forms of 
neurodivergence.  
Suggestions have also been made to tailor treatments for NDI [10, 37 7-378]. However, 
except for  the Body Appreciation Scale 2 for Autistic Adults [65], none of the adaptations to 
either identification or treatment discussed in this section have been  explicitly identified by 
their authors as having been developed through lived experience -led research. It is also 
important to note that while care adaptations discussed below have been developed with the 
intention of improving treatment outcomes for NDI, this does not necessarily guar antee that 
they will be experienced as NDA  by NDI with EDs  or helpful in practice [see 379]. Empirical 
evidence led by NDI with ED lived experience is required to provide insight on whether these 
ED care adaptations are experienced as helpful, harmful, or neutral.  
An ED inpatient care pathway tailored for autistic people, the PEACE Pathway, has been 
implemented in the United Kingdom [377]. The PEACE Pathway outlines the need for 
individualised sensory processing accommodations and includes training for clinicians to 
assist in making autism -specific adjustments to ED care and psychoeducation [3 80]. A 
preliminary evaluation of the PEACE pathway found that it reduced treatment duration and 
resulted in admission cost savings [380]. The PEACE pathway researchers examined the 
feasibility of implementing Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) amongst individuals with 
an ED, comparing efficacy between those with low and high autistic traits, and found CRT 
supported improvements in cogniti ve flexibility and central coherence in both groups [381]. 
However, across studies, results are heterogeneous, with Saure et al.’s [115]  narrative review 
concluding that individuals with AN with high autistic traits appear to benefit less from CRT 
(as well as from cognitive remediation and emotion skills training interventions) compared to 
those with low autistic traits.

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
31 Drawing on available research and clinical experience of supporting autistic children and 
young people with AN, Loomes and Bryant -Waugh [382] identified a range of autism -
specific modifications for family -based interventions for AN. The suggested adaptations 
target four domains : sensory processing considerations, cognitive and behavioural factors, 
difficulties with social communication and relationships, and challenges relating to emotion 
processing [382]. The authors recognise that the suggested adaptations are conceptual and 
thus require empirical assessment before we can determine their acceptability and efficacy.    
Field and colleagues [10] undertook a similar project, identifying ways in which ED services 
could better meet the needs of autistic women via a Delphi Study. Fifty -six consensus 
statements reached agreement in the final round, relating to the need to support the unique 
experiences  of autistic women, separating autistic features from the ED, and the importance 
of staff being experienced in supporting autistic individuals [10]. 
A single case report detailed adaptations to CBT to meet the needs of an individual with ID 
experiencing  difficulties with binge eating [383]. Adaptations included a focus on regularity 
and predictability of appointments, the use of images to aid with understanding, adapted use 
of language, and sensory considerations. The authors reported that the participant’s self -
regulation associated with loss of control eating  improved as a result of the intervention 
[383]. 
8.2. Human Rights, Cultural Humility, and Epistemic Justice  
An NDA approach to mental healthcare is a human rights -based approach rooted in the social 
model of disability and existential -humanistic psychology [339, 366 -368, 384]. As such, 
NDA mental healthcare is inherently gender -affirming and trauma -informed [339, 366]. This 
requires the rejection of compliance and exposure -based behavioural approaches (e.g.,

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
32 operant conditioning, contingency management) that are imposed rather than self -determined 
and client -led as these have been associated with iatrogenesis, including learned helplessness 
and psychological trauma [225, 339, 385 -389]. Instead, the priority must be on supporting 
self-determination, self -advocacy, and self -efficacy , and incorporating a person -centred , 
compassionate, and strengths -based approach to care that is informed by lived experience 
expertise [19, 337, pp. 179 -180, 366, 390 -393]. 
It is imperative that all NDA mental health interventions aim  to support the development of a 
positive and authentic neurodivergent identity, as this has been associated with benefits to 
overall psychosocial wellbeing and increased self -compassion [394-395]. The benefits of a 
positive neurodivergent identity have also been noted in relation to supporting ED recovery 
specifically [10, 19, 151, 174]. Such an approach echoes the recent call to action released in a 
joint statement by the United Nation and the World Health Organization that urges mental 
health practitioners and researchers to focus on the social determinants of mental health, 
epistemic ju stice, harm reduction, and human rights -based mental healthcare [396]. 
8.3. Reasonable Adjustments  
Founding members of Autistic Doctors International have created SPACE; an autistic -led 
framework for autism -specific accommodations aimed at improving accessibility of 
healthcare services for autistic individuals [370]. The SPACE framework identifies key 
reasonable adjustments across core support needs for autistic people, such as sensory, 
predictability, acceptance, communication , and empathy, as well as across three main 
domains of experience: physical space, processing space, and emotional space [370]. As 
noted in section six , NDI have unique sensory, communication, cognitive, and emotional 
needs that have been identified as important to understand, validate, and accommodate as part

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
33 of NDA ED care, and as such, SPACE has potential utility as a tool to support more 
neurodiversity -affirming ED service delivery [see 9, 10, 101]. For example, some autistic 
people may be non -speaking, while others may be partially speaking (e.g., situational 
mutism), and allowing communication in ways that feel comfortable is likely to improve trust 
between patient and clinician [370]. Additionally, adapting the consulting room to meet the 
sensory needs of autistic patients may also assist in building trust, self -regulation, and safety 
(e.g., noise, temperature, smells, lights) [370]. On the other hand, some autistic patients may 
prefer to remain standing or sit on the floor during the consultation, and these differences in 
proprioception should also be accommodated [370]. 
Research  exploring general mental health  has highlighted  empirical evidence support ing the 
benefits of sensory -based approaches in the general population, where the physical 
environment is tailored to the sensory processing characteristics of an individual [397-401].  
Sensory -based approaches can include strategies such as adjusting  the room’s lighting and/or 
colours, providing access to weighted blankets, fidget tools, rocking chairs, and/or noise -
cancelling headsets to reduce sensory stimulation. Sensory -based mental health approaches 
have been shown to create a sense of safety and control, increase self -regulation, reduce 
distress and anxiety, improve self -perception, and help with stabil ising (or ‘grounding’) acute 
arousal [399, 401]. There is also emerging evidence suggesting that sensory -based 
approaches in inpatient mental health facilities may contribute to  improvements in autistic 
individuals’ wellbeing and self -regulation [372, 402 -403], giving further weight to the 
argument in support of ED services attending to the unique sensory needs of NDI.

34 8.4. Conclusion  
NDA care involves respecting and validating different personality and neurocognitive 
profiles instead of de facto pathologising divergence and trying to ‘fix’ differences rather 
than celebrating diversity and accommodating specific support needs. Promoting self -
determination and a positive, authentic, sense of self are criti cal to NDA care. In the context 
of EDs, NDA care requires that researchers and clinicians engage in epistemic justice and 
remain curious towards the different ways NDI engage with eating, self -perception and 
expression, and conceptualise recovery. Indeed, distinguishing between ED symptoms and 
adaptive ND traits is key to NDA ED care and the prevention of iatrogenesis. Additionally, 
while further empirical research is required, the SPACE framework and sensory -based 
approaches may be useful in the context of ED care for NDI.  
9. CONCLUSIONS  
Prevalence data highlights that autistic people and those with ADHD are at an increased risk 
of developing EDs compared to those who are neurotypical. The limited research on other 
forms of neurodivergence (e.g., giftedness, intellectual disability, Touret te’s syndrome) and 
eating psychopathology has found them to be associated with high incidences of disordered 
eating, highlighting a need for more research. It is possible that the real co -occurrence rates 
between neurodivergence and EDs are much higher as issues such as the underdiagnosis 
and/or misdiagnosis of autism and ADHD in AFABs and racially marginalised populations, 
lack of tailored psychometric instruments, and limited research despite documented overlaps 
between various forms of neurodivergence po tentially lead to under -identification of true 
prevalence rates. Improvements in the accessibility of neurodivergent assessments and the 
development of lived experience -led ED screening and diagnostic tools are likely to support

EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
35 early identification for NDI. In addition, given the overrepresentation of neurodivergence in 
ED populations, it is ideal for ED clinicians to screen for autism and ADHD to improve ED 
care individuation.  
There are a wide range of interwoven factors underlying ED risk for NDI, ranging from 
atypical sensory processing, executive functioning, social communication, emotional 
processing, and a higher likelihood of experiencing chronic illnesses and systemic 
discrimination. Therefore, it is important that future investigations into ED risk in the context 
of neurodivergence take an intersectional approach. Transdiagnostic research factoring in the 
overlaps between varied forms of neurodivergence is also warranted given that co -occurring 
forms of neurodivergence appear to have an impact on ED presentations and the nature of 
support needs. Future empirical work should be participatory, non-tokenistic, and ideally 
lived experience -led, and acknowledge power structures associated with discrimination and 
trauma to better achieve epistemic justice and better translate to cultural humility in ED care.  
 
10. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS  
While our work did not entail a comprehensive systematic review of the literature due to the 
nascent nature of this specific area of inquiry, this narrative review allows for scoping of the 
literature available to date whilst providing a lived experience -led framework for discussion 
and an initial conceptual map for future empirical work.  
Additionally, this review can only draw from the strength of the evidence that is available. 
Although an extensive narrative review, research is still limited, and this can only be 
improved with funding and support. Furthermore, most of the literature to d ate focuses on

NEURODIVERGENCE, INTERSECTIONALITY, AND EATING DISORDERS: A LIVED 
EXPERIENCE -LED NARRATIVE REVIEW  [PREPRINT ] 
 
 
36 either autism or ADHD in relation to EDs. Therefore, there is limited data relevant to other 
forms of neurodivergence to draw upon.  
This paper was written exclusively by NDI with lived or living experience of an ED, which 
may influence reflexivity. However, the importance of lived experience -led mental health 
research has been consistently highlighted, particularly with regards to tran slation and 
implementation.
