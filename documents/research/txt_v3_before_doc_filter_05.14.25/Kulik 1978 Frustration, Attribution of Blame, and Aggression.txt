## Frustration, Attribution of  Blame, and  Aggression

Received  March 17.  1978

In  contrast to  most  recent studies of  human aggression, multiple measures  of naturally occurring aggressive  behavior were  examined in  a realistic and  involving setting. Consistent with attributional formulations, it was  found  that  aggression increased in  accord  with attributions of blame,  and that  more  blame  was  attributed to  another in response to inadequately justified thwartings than to adequately justified thwartings. As  anticipated, anger, other-directed attributions of  blame, and other-directed aggression  were  greatest  in  response  to  unjustified (illegitimate) thwartings. Justified (legitimate) thwartings produced intermediate anger and  intermediate levels  of  blame and  aggression internally and  externally. Self-caused (internal) thwartings, ostensibly caused  neither by  the  other's disposition nor by situational factors,  produced the  least  anger  and  other-directed aggression  but  the most  self-blame/self-aggression. In  addition, unexpected thwartings produced independently more  anger  than  did  expected thwartings, and  high-drive thwartings produced independently less  other-directed aggression than  did  low-drive thwartings.  The results are  discussed  with reference to  both the  need  and  the  potential for  studies  of human  aggression  which employ  more  ecologically valid  settings  and measures  of aggressive behavior.

Recent experimental studies of  human aggression have generally employed electric shock as the  primary, if not sole, measure of  aggression. Electric-shock machines (cf. Buss, 1961) have undeniably provided reliable, objective measures of  aggression with which to  test numerous important questions. However, conclusions based upon data for only one mode of  aggressive behavior are  likely to be  incomplete and/or misleading. In addition, the extremely rare real-world occurrence of shock machines and shock behavior makes experimental settings employing shock measures necessarily more artificial and leaves uncertain the

generalizability of  findings to  more natural settings and  forms of  aggressive behavior.

The present research is principally concerned with the effect that different types  of  frustration [where frustration is  defined as the  thwarting of a goal response (Dollard, Doob, Miller, Mowrer, &amp;  Sears, 1939)]  have  on unobtrusive measures of perceptions and multiple forms of naturally occurring aggressive behavior. Previous research relevant to this topic has  examined primarily the differential effects of  arbitrary (unjustified) thwartings and  nonarbitrary (justified) thwartings and  found that arbitrary thwartings produce more anger and/or aggression than do nonarbitrary thwartings (e.g., Cohen, 1955;  Fishman, 1965:  Pastore, 1952),  even  when inhibitions for aggression were  minimized experimentally (Burnstein &amp; Worchel, 1962)  or via the use  of  projective techniques (Rothaus &amp;  Worchel, 1960). However, most studies in this area have operationalized arbitrary (we will use  the  term illegitimate) frustrations in  a manner which combines elements of unexpectedness and inadequate justification. The only study  which has examined the  independent effects  of  unexpected and illegitimate thwartings found that unexpected thwartings produced greater aggression than did expected thwartings, whereas  illegitimate thwartings and  legitimate thwartings produced similar levels of  aggression (Kregarman &amp; Worchel, 1961). However, methodological problems with the adequacy of the operationalizations of  both frustration and  justification render these results in need of replication.

An  attributional approach (cf.  Heider, 1958;  Jones  &amp;  Davis, 1965)  to  the area  would suggest  that the  causal basis  for  inadequately justified thwartings should be  attributed primarily to dispositional qualities of  the frustrator, whereas appropriately justified thwartings should be attributed more to  situational factors. Work on  the  relationship between attribution and  retaliation further suggests that attributions of  blame may influence importantly the  direction and  intensity of  frustration-induced aggression; victims of attacks should retaliate more when the causal basis for the attack is  attributed to  dispositional qualities of  the  attacker than  when  it  is attributed to  situational factors (Dyck &amp;  Rule, 1978;  Jones &amp;  Davis, 1965; Kelley, 1967, 1971). Thus the victim of an illegitimate or unjustified thwarting should attribute blame primarily to  the disposition of  the frustrator and should direct aggression primarily against the frustrator. As situational constraints upon the frustrator become more compelling, the frustration should be  perceived as  more legitimate, and the frustrator should receive less  blame and  aggression. The  less  both the  disposition of and the situational constraints on  the  frustrator are  to  blame, however, the more the source of  frustration should be  perceived by  the victim as primarily self-caused. Following Dollard et  al. (1939), self-caused thwartings should produce internally rather than externally directed aggression.

Another question of  interest is  whether highly motivated relative to  less

motivated thwartings produce independently more anger  arousal (cf.  Dollard et al., 1939)  and more externally directed aggression (Buss, 1963, 1966).  However, because the  present study involved a  situation in which aggression would generally be  considered counterproductive to the attainment of  a goal, highly motivated individuals were  expected to  respond to thwartings with less other-directed aggression than were less motivated individuals.

If the foregoing notions are  correct, the following pattern of results should be obtained. Anger, other-directed attributions of blame, and other-directed aggression should be  greatest for illegitimate thwartings. Legitimate thwartings should produce intermediate anger and intermediate blame and aggression internally and externally. Self-caused or internal thwartings should produce the least anger and other-directed aggression but the most self-blame and self-aggression. In addition, thwartings which are unexpected should produce independently more aggressive behavior than expected thwartings, and thwartings of highdrive goal responses should produce more anger and  less  other-directed aggression than do  thwartings of  low-drive goal responses.

## METHOD

## Subjects

Subjects were  60 male  undergraduates at  Harvard University who  responded to  a sign-up sheet  for  a  'study of  persuasive communication' paying '$1.50 for  30  minutes with the chance  to  make  more.' In  fact  all subjects  were paid  $2.00  for  their  participation. Subjects were  randomly assigned  to experimental conditions and  were run  individually.

## Procedure

A male  experimenter presented the  study  to  each  subject  as one  of persuasive communication. The task of  each subject was to persuade members of the community over the telephone to contribute to a (fictitious) charity that helped formerly institutionalized psychiatric patients to  readjust to  society.

To increase further the credibility and  visibility of  the  expectations manipulation, two five-page lists  of  names,  addresses, and  telephone numbers were prepared which showed each  of the  names  on  the  initial 2.25  pages  with a check  mark  in  the  left  margin (signifying that  the  person had  already been  called) and  both the  response of  the  person  (Yes-No) and the  amount of  the  pledge, if any,  written in  the  adjacent right margin. The  two  lists  differed only in their respective percentages of  Yes-No margin notations, with 65%  of  the telephoned names  responding 'Yes' on  the low-expectations list compared to 15%  on  the high-expectations list.

Drive  was experimentally manipulated by telling each  subject  that  he would receive  either an  additional $1.00  (high drive) or  $.I0 (low drive) for  each  obtained pledge. Expectations (for  frustration) were  varied by telling each  subject  that  he  would call  people either from  a lo-15% success-rate  list  (high  expectations) or  from  a  60-65% success-rate  list  (low expectations). The  high  rate  of  success for  the  latter  list  was  explained by referring to  the  fact that the  individuals on  the  list  had  been  selected  by  an  actuarial prediction method as relatively likely to  donate to  charities. Subjects in the  high-expectations condition were  told that  the individuals on  that  list had  been  drawn randomly from  the  telephone book,

Subjects were then told that depending on the call's outcome, they  were to remove immediately from  either the  provided 'Successful Calls' or  'Unsuccessful Calls' folder a packet  of  three form  letters. Subjects were told that  they  would then  choose a  letter that would serve as a cover  letter  for  some literature about  the charity that  would be mailed  to the person  called. The  subjects  were  instructed to  fill  in  the  name  ofthe person  called and  to sign their own name  to the  letter that  they  chose  to  send.  Subjects were  then  informed that  their conversations would be  recorded. After the subjects had  prepared their persuasive communications from  literature provided by the  experimenter and  had  indicated that  they  were ready to begin, the experimenter administered a  questionnaire containing manipulation checks  for drive and for  expectations as well as several  filler  items.  Each  subject  telephoned the  first  two unchecked names  on  the  provided list. Two male  confederates received the counterbalanced calls. Both confederates responded to  the  efforts  of  a  given subject in  a manner  which constituted one  of three  types  of frustration: (1)  illegitimate, (2)  legitimate, or (3)  internal. In  order to  avoid  confounding frustration with attack or  insult and  to  minimize extraneous variables, the  confederates were  trained to  respond in  a  matter-of-fact, nonbelligerent manner in all frustration conditions. The confederates were blind both to the hypotheses of  the study  and  to  the  drive, expectations, and  trial conditions. The experimenter was  blind to  the  frustration condition.

## Types  of  Frustration

Illegitimate. Frustration in  this  condition is  illegitimate in that  the justification offered is inappropriate. As  such the frustration should be attributed primarily to  the  disposition of the confederate frustrator. One  confederate in this  condition stated  that  he  did not believe in charities, and that  charities were  a waste  of time  and a 'rip-off.' If the  subject  persisted, the confederate repeated his  belief  that  charities were  a waste. The  other confederate similarly stated  that he  was  not  the  type  of  person who  just gave  money  away, that  former mental patients should learn to  look out for  themselves, and  that in his  opinion mental patients should probably not even  be  allowed out of  the hospital. If the subject persisted, the confederate repeated his  belief  that  mental  patients should  learn to look  out  for  themselves.

Legitimate. Frustration in  this condition is  legitimate. being caused  ostensibly more  by situational constraints on  the  frustrator than  by his dispositional qualities. One  confederate who  had  'always tried to  give  to  charities' refused,  because  he  had  recently been  laid off from  his job and  could not  afford  the  money.  The  other confederate felt  that  the  charity was worthy of  support but  refused, because  he  had  recently donated all he  could afford  to  the United Fund.  If the  subject  persisted, both  confederates repeated that  they  could not  afford to  donate.

Internal. Frustration in this  condition should be  attributed not  to  the  disposition of  the confederate or  to  situational constraints but  rather to  the  subject's own lack  of  persuasive ability. One  confederate, after  a long, reflective pause  indicated that  it  was  difficult for  him to  refuse  any  charity, but  that  he  would rather give  to  'some other charity.' Similarly, the other confederate stated  that  the  charity was  worthwhile, but  that he would probably give elsewhere. If  the  subject  persisted, the  former  confederate said,  'I don't think so,' and  the latter confederate said,  'I don't think I  can  help you.' Thus both confederates, although ostensibly dispositionally and  situationally amenable to  charitable donations, were unpersuaded  by  the subject and  unwilling to  donate to  this  particular charity.

An independent sample of  22  college students (hereafter referred to  as  the validation subjects), drawn from the same  population as  the experimental sample, provides strong support for both the legitimacy and  the  attributional aspects  of  the  foregoing frustration operationalizations. Counterbalanced transcripts of  the  illegitimate, the  legitimate, and  the internal-frustration statements made  by  either Confederate A  or B  were rated by  each subject on  a series  of  1  l-point scales.  Separate 2  x  3 analyses  of  variance (Form X  Frustration) with repeated measures on  the last  factor indicated no significant effects  involving

form, i.e., Confederate A  versus  B  versions, on any  of  these  measures. However a  significant effect  of  frustration was  obtained for  the  perceived 'legitimacy of  the  reason for refusal  given by the  nondonor,' F(2,40) = 20.16,  p  &lt; .OOl. Consistent with the  proposed legitimacy conceptualizations, illegitimate thwartings (M = 8.55)  were rated more  illegitimate  than  were legitimate (M = 3.32)  and  internal (M =  5.32)  frustrations on  a  scale  with labeled end  points  'Very Legitimate' (1)  and  'Very Illegitimate' (I  I).  Protected t tests (see Carmer &amp; Swanson, 1973,  under the  Fischer LSD method) indicated that each  of  these means  differed significantly (p  i .05)  from  the  others.

Significant (p &lt; .OOl) effects of frustration were also  obtained on  items  concerned with 'the degree  to  which situational factors  were responsible for  the  refusal of  the  callee to donate,' F(2,40) = 21.56,  and  'the degree  to  which dispositional/personal qualities of  the callee  were responsible for  the  refusal  ofthe callee  to  donate,' F(2.40) =  22.02.  A  composite index  formed  by subtracting the  situational from  the corresponding dispositional attribution for  each  thwarting produced a  significant main  effect  for  frustration, F(2,40) =  26.70.  p  &lt; ,001. As  anticipated, illegitimate thwartings were  attributed more  to dispositional qualities of the  confederate (M = 6.82). internal frustrations slightly more to dispositional than to situational factors  (M =  2.00),  and  legitimate frustrations more  to  situational factors  (M = -3.18). Protected t tests  indicated that  each of these  means  differed  significantly @ &lt;  .OOl) from  the  others.

Finally, in  support of the  proposed attribution-of-blame formulations, significant effects of frustration were  obtained on  'the extent  to  which the  caller appears  responsible,' F(2.40) = 20.67,~ &lt;  .OOl, and  on 'the extent  to  which the  callee  appears  responsible,' F(2,40) =  4.86, p  &lt;  .02.  A  composite index  formed by subtracting caller  from  callee  attributions of responsibility for  each  thwarting likewise revealed a significant effect for  frustration, F(2,40) =  5.21, p  &lt;  .02.  Blame  attributed to  the  callee  in  the  legitimate-frustration condition (M =  5.27)  was significantly (p  &lt; .05)  less than  in  the  illegitimate condition (M =  6.91)  and  near  significantly (p  &lt; .07)  greater than in  the  internal condition (M = 3.82).

## Measures of  Aggression

Anger. The force exerted on the telephone by  the subject when terminating the  call, assessed by a Grass  Model FT 1OC force  displacement transducer and  a  Grass  Model 79D polygraph, provided a  reliable measure  of  anger arousal. The force exerted provides a relatively uncontaminated measure  of anger  given  the  uniformity across  conditions of  both the  exculpability of the  telephone as a cause of frustration and  the  minimal sanctions against slamming the telephone. In addition, the measure was completely unobtrusive and is therefore much less  susceptible than standard self-rating measures of  anger to demand characteristics arguments.

Verbal aggression. Content  analysis  of the  recorded conversations provided a  measure  of verbal  aggression expressed by subjects  to the  confederates. Two  judges who  were  blind to the  hypotheses  of the experiment coded  transcripts of each  conversation for  aggression from the  time  of  initial frustration to  the  termination of the  call.  The  content-analysis system used consisted of  three dimensions and had  an  overall interjudge reliability of .97.  The first dimension, aggressive  content, involved counting each  statement  which was  perceived by the  judges as  rebuffing, accusing, and/or condemning. For example, a  statement such  as, 'that's a  pretty  poor attitude to  have .' was  scored  for  aggressive  content. The  second and  third dimensions involved the  degree of  gratitude expressed by  the  subject and  the nature of  his  sign-off, respectively. Moderate expressions of  gratitude were scored less aggressive/more friendly than no  expression of  gratitude and  more  aggressive/less friendly than high degrees of  gratitude. Similarly, formal sign-off  expressions (e.g., 'good-bye') were scored less  aggressive/more friendly than no sign-off expression (as  for example occurred when subjects hung  up  on  the  confederate) and  more  aggressive/less friendly than informal sign-off  expressions (e.g., 'bye-bye').

In order to validate the foregoing classification scheme, the validation subjects rated randomly ordered transcripts representing all combinations of  gratitude and  sign-off expressions on  both friendliness and  aggressiveness 11-point scales.  The results of  a  3 x 3 analysis of  variance (with repeated measures  on  both  factors) provided strong empirical support for  both the  gratitude, F(2,42) =  56.42,  p  &lt; .OOl, and  the  sign-off,  F(2,42) = 38.16, p  &lt; .OOl, conceptualizations. Protected  t  tests indicated, as predicted, that  moderate gratitude (M = 4.71)  was  considered significantly CJJ &lt; .Ol)  less  unfriendly than no  gratitude (M = 7.09)  and  significantly @  &lt; .Ol)  more unfriendly than  high gratitude (M = 3.97).  Similarly, formal sign-offs  (M =  5.02)  were perceived as significantly Cp  &lt; .OI)  less  unfriendly than  no sign-offs (M =  6.58)  and  significantly (p  &lt; .Ol)  more  unfriendly than  informal sign-offs  (M = 4.18). The same  significant pattern of  means  was  obtained for  both gratitude, F(2,42) = 21.98,  p  &lt; .OOl, and  sign-offs,  F(2,42) = 37.13,  p &lt; .OOl, on ratings of  aggressiveness.

Written  Aggression. The three follow-up form  letters chosen  and  signed by  subjects to mail to  the  confederate varied in the  degree to  which each  expressed self-aggression and outwardly directed aggression. The intended self-aggressive (SA) letter was very  selfeffacing  in  tone,  apologizing for  the  'imposition on your  time,' admitting both  to  'a lack  of persuasiveness on  my part' and  to  being  'not especially gifted  at  persuasion.' In  contrast, the  intended outwardly aggressive (OA) letter was  quite threatening and/or accusatory in tone,  e.g.,  '. . consider yourself  lucky  if  none  of  your  family  or  friends is  mentally ill . you  are performing a  disservice to the community . . .  to ignore their efforts .  . .  is inhumane.' Finally, the  third letter was  meant  to  be  relatively moderate in tone, neither extremely self-aggressive nor  extremely outwardly aggressive.  Representative phrases  mentioned 'the social stigma  that  still exists  regarding mental illness,' and  the  fact  that  'at a time when assistance is  critical, rejection is  often received.'

In  order to  validate our conceptualizations of  these  letters, the  validation subjects rated counterbalanced copies of  each  form letter on  a  series  of Il-point scales. The repeated measures  analyses  of variance  indicated that  the  letters  differed significantly @ &lt;  .OOl) both for  self-aggression ratings, F(2,42) = 182.23,  and  for  outwardly directed aggression ratings, F(2,42) =  42.85.  The results  of a  set of orthogonal comparisons indicated, as predicted, that the  SA  letter contained significantly, F( 1,42)  =  362.89,  p &lt; .OOl, more  self-aggression than the  OA  letter  and  moderate letter  (M  =  9.00  versus 2.4 and  1.59, respectively), and that  the  OA and  moderate  letters  did  not  differ  significantly, F( 1,42)  = I .59,  ns. Another set of orthogonal contrasts indicated, as predicted, that  the OA  letter expressed  significantly, F(1,42) =  85.46, p  &lt; .@)I,  more  aggression  'to the  recipient of the  letter' than  did  the  SA  and  moderate  letters (M =  8.82  versus  3.50  and  3.82,  respectively), and  that  the  SA  and  moderate letters  did not differ significantly, F( 1,42) &lt; I. Interestingly, numerous validation subjects expressed gratuitously surprise that  anyone  could have  sent  such a self-effacing  (in  the case of the  SA letter) and/or such  a rude letter (in the  case  of  the  OA letter).

## Attributions of  Blame

The  attribution-of-blame measure  was  unobtrusively built into  the  form  letters chosen  by the  subjects. In  contrast to  standard rating-scale measures,  such  an  unobtrusive measure  is nondisruptive to  the  setting  and  minimizes both  demand  characteristics and the  likelihood of obtaining after-the-act rationalizations for aggression rather than 'true' attributions of blame.  Ratings  on  I l-point scales by the  validation subjects  indicated clearly  that  the  letters differed significantly (p  &lt; .OOl) both for  the  amount of  blame attributed to  the  confederate for  not  donating, F(2,42) =  39.93,  and  for  blame  attributed to  the  sender  of  the  letter,  F(2,42) = 46.71. Planned, orthogonal comparisons indicated that other blame was  significantly, F(l,42) = 79.85,~ &lt; .OOl, greater in  the  OA letter (M = 9.68)  than  in  the  moderate (M = 3.96)  and  SA  (M =  3.91)  letters, respectively, and  that  the  moderate and  SA  letters did not differ, F(l,42) &lt; I. In  contrast, planned comparisons indicated that  self-blame was  significantly,  F(1,42) =  93.12,~ &lt; .OOl, greater in  the  SA  letter (M =  7.82)  than  in  the  OA (M =

2.41)  and  moderate (M = 2.05)  letters, respectively, and  that  the  OA and  moderate letters did  not  differ,  F( 1,42)  &lt; 1. Thus subjects  who chose to  sign and  to mail  the  OA letter  blamed strongly and  primarily the confederate for  frustration, senders  of  the SA letter blamed strongly and  primarily themselves, and  senders  of the  moderate letter blamed themselves and  the  confederate equally moderately.

## RESULTS

Separate 2 x 2 x 3  analyses of variance' (Drive x Expectations x Frustration) were performed to analyze the anger and the verbal and blame/written aggression measures. For the blame/written aggression measure, the  follow-up form letters were  coded  0  (high self-aggression), 1 (moderate self/outward aggression), and  2 (high outward aggression) and entered into an  analysis of  variance (Lunney, 1970).  Intercorrelations of the  dependent measures for  the sample, collapsed across  trials, indicated that both anger  and  verbal aggression were  significantly (p  &lt; .03)  related to  blame/written aggression, r(58) = .322  and  .248, respectively, and  that there was a near-significant relationship between  anger  and  verbal aggression, r(58) = .173,  p &lt; .lO.

## Manipulation Checks

Separate 2 x 2  (Drive x Expectations) analyses of variance on  the manipulation-check items for drive and for expectations, respectively, indicated that both manipulations had their intended effects. The drive manipulation check produced only a  significant main effect for drive, F(1,56) = 5.40, p &lt; .05. Prior to  the initial frustration, high-drive individuals (A4  = 2.32) felt significantly more 'motivated for success  at  the task' than  did low-drive individuals (A4 =  2.93)  on  a scale  with end  points labeled 'Extremely Motivated' (1)  and 'Extremely Unmotivated' (7).

The expectations manipulation check produced only a  significant main effect for expectations, F(1,56) = 4.16, P  &lt; .05. Prior to the initial frustration, high expectation-for-frustration subjects (A4  = 3.80) anticipated being significantly less 'successful at the task' than did low expectation-for-frustration subjects (M =  3.17)  on  a scale  with end  points labeled 'Extremely Successful' (I) and  'Extremely Unsuccessful' (7).

Preliminary analyses of variance  included Sequence  of Confederate (AB  versus BA)  as a between-subjects factor and  Trial as within-subjects factor. Because the  results indicated no significant effects  involving sequence, the data are here collapsed across  sequence. Similarly, because  the  trials  factor  was  included to  increase  both the  generalizability of  the frustration operationalizations and  the  stability of  measurement rather than  for  conceptual interest, and  because  there were no  significant interactions of  trial with the  results to  be reported, the  data  are  also  collapsed across  trials. Only  a  significant main  effect  for  trials, F(l,48) = 15.28,~ &lt; .OOl, was  found  on the anger  measure,  such that  initial thwartings were more anger inducing than were subsequent thwartings.

## Effects of  Frustration Type

The type of  frustration significantly affected anger,2 F(2,48) = 14.80, p &lt; .OOl, verbal aggression3 F(2,48) = 3.42, p  &lt; .05,  and blame/written aggression, F(2,48) =  5.16, p  &lt; .Ol. As  predicted, illegitimately thwarted victims expressed the most, internally thwarted victims the least, and legitimately thwarted victims intermediate anger and verbal aggression. Also as predicted, illegitimate thwartings produced the most otherblame/written aggression, internal frustrations the most self-blamekelfaggression, and legitimate thwartings intermediate levels of selfand other-blame/written aggression (Table 1).  The results of  protected t tests indicated that each  of  the means for  anger significantly differed from the others (p  &lt; .Ol, one  tail), and  that the differences between internal and illegitimate and  between legitimate and  illegitimate frustrations were  significant Cp &lt; .025, one  tail) for  both verbal and  blame/written aggression measures.

## Effects of  Expectations for Frustration and  Drive

A  main effect  for  expectations was found for  anger, F(  1,48)  =  4.82,  p  -C .05,  such  that individuals with low  expectations for  frustration were  more angered in response to being thwarted than were individuals who  had higher expectations for  frustration (Table 1).  No other effects involving expectations were  significant for anger or  for verbal and blame/written aggression.

Drive significantly influenced verbal aggression, F(  1,48)  = 10.41 ,p &lt;  .Ol such  that high-drive thwartings produced less  verbal aggression than did lower  drive thwartings. No  other effects  involving drive were significant for verbal aggression or  for anger and  blame/written aggression (Table 1).

## DISCUSSION

As  anticipated, anger, other-directed attributions of  blame, and  otherdirected aggression were greatest for  illegitimate or  unjustified thwartings. Situationally justified or legitimate thwartings produced intermediate

- *  A log  transformation was  performed on  the  raw data  for  anger in  order both to  make more  homogeneous the  cell  variances and  to  reduce  the  correlation between cell  means  and variances from  r(10) = .91,  p &lt; .Ol  before to  r(lO) = .I1 ns,  after  transformation. The reported means  for  anger therefore are  log  transformations of  the  raw data.
- 3  A  Drive x Expectations x Frustration analysis  of variance (with repeated measures  on the  last  factor), performed on the length of subjects' postfrustration conversations, produced only a  significant effect  for  the  three-way interaction, F(2,48) = 3.55,  p &lt; .05.  For both internal and  illegitimate thwartings, the  two same-level  (i.e., high-high and  low-low) drive and  expectations conditions produced longer conversations than  the  two mixed-level (i.e., high-low and  low-high) drive and  expectations conditions, whereas for  legitimate thwartings  this  pattern was  reversed. Thus  the obtained significant effect offrustration upon  verbal aggression  cannot  be attributed to any built-in time  bias  of the  aggressive  content component of the  verbal  aggression measure.  A  separate  analysis  of variance  performed on the  length of conversations prior to  frustration revealed no  significant differences among conditions.

anger and intermediate levels of blame and aggression internally and externally. Thwartings which were  ostensibly caused neither by  dispositional qualities of the  other nor  by  situational constraints produced the  least anger and other-directed aggression but the most self-blame/selfaggression.

These results, obtained in a  frustration-aggression context, are  consistent with  the  notion that retaliation increases as more personal causality is attributed to  an  attacker (Kelley, 1971),  and  that more personal causality is  inferred from behavior which iti situationally unjustified (Heider, 1958; Jones &amp; Davis, 1965). These results are also consistent with recent findings of  Dyck and  Rule (1978)  that retaliation is  greater when  attacks are  considered unjustified than  when  considered relatively justified. Dyck and Rule, however, did not find a  significant relationship between justification and  attributions of  personal causality to  the self  or  to  the  opponent, whereas  our results indicated that  justification affected perceptions of  self and other's blame and consequently the direction of aggression.

Another finding of  interest is  the  greater anger  produced independently of  the  nature of  the  frustration by  unexpected thwartings than  by  expected thwartings. The  fact  that the  expectations effect was not  also  obtained on the verbal and  blame/written aggression measures indicates that expectations for frustration were  not as  critical a  determinant for aggression in this setting as was the  type  of  frustration. We  suspect  this is generally the case.  However it is  noteworthy that the manipulation check for  expectations, although statistically significant, indicated that both groups had  on average quite similar, optimistic expectations for success. It is quite possible, therefore, that larger differences in expectations for  frustration would have  produced the  effect across  the  aggression measures. Regardless,  the  obtained results for  anger are  relevant to  previous studies which have  confounded unexpectedness with unjustifiability (e.g., Cohen, 1955; Pastore, 1952;  Rothaus &amp; Worchel, 1960)  or  have failed to  find independent  effects  of  expectations and  justification because of  operationalizatiori problems (Kregarman &amp; Worchel, 1961).

The least clear results were those involving the drive level of the thwarted response. Highrelative to  low-drive thwartings did not  differentially affect  anger  arousal or  blame/written aggression but  did produce less verbal aggression. The latter result may appear to  conflict with findings that high-drive thwartings produce more aggression than do low-drive thwartings when aggression is instrumental to the attainment of  a  goal (Buss, 1963,  1966).  However if  one can  make the assumption that verbal aggression by  charity fund raisers is  generally viewed as  more likely to harm than  to  abet  pledges, the  results may  reflect similar anger  arousal but greater inhibition of  aggression by  highly motivated relative to  less  motivated individuals. Although additional research is needed to warrant a more definitive statement, it may  be  that high-drive relative to  low-drive

thwartings augment or suppress aggression as  a  function of  the relative adaptiveness or nonadaptiveness of aggression for the attainment of a goal.

Finally, and  perhaps most importantly, the  present study has  important methodological implications for experimental studies of human aggression. In contrast to  most recent studies which employ a single measure of aggression in an  artificial situation, the  present research examines multiple  measures of  naturally occurring aggressive behavior and  blame which were  unobtrusively embedded in a  realistic, involving situation [as  evidenced by  the pervasive nervousness of  subjects during their telephone conversations, by  numerous requests to  make additional calls, and  by  the fact  that 10% of  the  subjects (66%  of  which were  in  the  internal-frustration condition) offered gratuitously to  donate their earnings to  the  charity prior to  debriefing]. As  a result,  our  findings, particularly those demonstrating that the nature of  a  thwarting influences perceptions of  blame and subsequent aggressive behavior, are  likely to  have relatively greater ecological  validity. It is  not  our intention to  advocate the specific methods of  the present study  as a new paradigm for  the  study of  aggression. However it is hoped that future studies will give increased attention to  studying human aggression in more realistic settings with multiple, unobtrusive measures of  naturally occurring aggressive behavior.
