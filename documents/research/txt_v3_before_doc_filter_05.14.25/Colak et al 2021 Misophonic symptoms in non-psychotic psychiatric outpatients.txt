Somatosensory amplification ABSTRACT  
Background: Misophonia is commonly described as abnormal or disproportionately aversive and emotional re-
actions to specific sounds that interfere with patients ’ psychosocial functioning. In this study, we aimed to 
investigate the possible associations of specific psychological traits with misophonic symptoms in psychiatric 
outpatients. 
Subjects: Misophonic Symptoms Checklist (MSC), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised Short Form 
(EPQRS), Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Buss-Perry 
Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) and Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SASS) were used to assess various 
psychological traits in a sample of consecutive outpatients at University Hospital Psychiatry Department in 
September 2019. 
Results: After multiple regression analysis, we found that the MOCI, STAI, EPQRSneuroticism, SASS, and BPAQ 
predicted misophonic symptoms where only SASS and MOCI were significant predictors. 
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that proneness to somatization and obsessivecompulsive symptoms are 
significantly associated with misophonic symptoms. These findings contribute to the phenomenological under -
standing of misophonia.   
1.Introduction 
The term misophonia was introduced by Jastreboff and Jastreboff to 
describe patients ‘who react negatively to specific sounds with specific 
patterns and/or meanings to individuals in specific situations ’ (Jas-
treboff & Jastreboff, 2001 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ). Although the first 
descriptions of this condition stemmed from audiology literature related 
to hyperacusis; recently more evidence from neurophysiology and 
neurobiology research has supported its neuropsychiatric features and 
discussed it as a candidate neuropsychiatric disorder (Song et al., 2014 ; 
Brout et al., 2018 ). Currently, misophonia is still not classified as a 
distinct psychiatric disorder in any diagnostic classification system 
though it shares many aspects of a psychiatric disorder (Kumar et al., 
2017 ). 
Misophonia was described as abnormal or disproportionately aver-
sive and emotional reactions to specific sounds, generally but not limited to the oral or nasal origin, which interfere with patients ’ psychosocial 
functioning (Potgieter et al., 2019 ; Taylor, 2017 ). Negative strong 
emotional and autonomic reactions such as the ‘fight or flight ’ response 
are elicited by specific stimuli called ‘trigger sounds ’ (Edelstein, Brang, 
Rouw, & Ramachandran, 2013 ). Trigger sounds include breathing, 
wheezing, chewing, eating, slurping, lip-smacking, pen clicking/tap -
ping, typing, and cracking knuckles (Kumar et al., 2017 ; McKay, Kim, 
Mancusi, Storch, & Spankovich, 2018 ). In some cases, images or visual 
stimuli such as leg-rocking, watching someone chewing, or 
hair-twiddling, could provoke similar emotional, behavioral, and 
physiological reactions to trigger sounds (Dozier & Morrison, 2017 ). 
Emotional reactions to the stimuli vary from discomfort, anxiety, and 
distress to irritation, disgust, hate, anger, feeling trapped, impatience 
and loss of self-control, and could even be related to the subject or 
context (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Potgieter et al., 2019 ; Schroder, Vulink, 
& Denys, 2013 ). Indeed, some authors suggested that aggressive

2outbursts are a central feature of misophonic conditions (Kluckow, 
Telfer, & Abraham, 2014 ; McGuire, Wu, & Storch, 2015 ; Schroder et al., 
2013 ). Besides, physiological or autonomic reactions are reported to be 
important aspects of misophonia. Autonomic arousal in individuals with 
misophonia causes a variety of symptoms, possibly due to activation of 
the sympathetic nervous system activated by ‘trigger sounds ’ (Vidal, 
Vidal, & Lage, 2010 ). Furthermore, misophonic patients were reported 
to have specific maladaptive coping mechanisms such as avoidance of 
social situations in which the trigger sound might occur, which in turn 
could interfere with the interpersonal and occupational functioning of 
the patient (Cavanna & Seri, 2015 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ; Webber & 
Storch, 2014 ). 
Phenomenological features of misophonia have been associated with 
a variety of psychiatric disorders. Obsessive-compulsive disorders, 
agoraphobia, tic disorders, mood disorders, panic disorder, attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic dis-
order, eating disorder, trichotillomania, skin picking, and autism spec-
trum disorders have been reported to have significant associations with 
misophonic symptoms (Cavanna, 2014 ; Ferreira, Harrison, & Fonte -
nelle, 2013 ; Hazen et al., 2008 ; Johnson et al., 2013 ; McGuire et al., 
2015 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ; Taylor, 2017 ; Taylor, Conelea, McKay, 
Crowe, & Abramowitz, 2014 ; Webber, Johnson, & Storch, 2014 ). 
The variability of psychiatric symptoms associated with misophonia 
might suggest a common physiopathology between misophonia and 
psychiatric disorders instead of accepting them as entirely distinct en-
tities (Taylor, 2017 ). Research on potential intermediate phenotypes 
between misophonia and psychiatric disorders underlying both entities 
can be valuable in this respect. Various psychological trait features are 
defined for the underlying psychopathology of diverse psychiatric dis-
orders (Rosenstr om et al., 2019 ). For instance, previous research in-
dicates anxiety, anger, obsessions, and avoidance behaviours which are 
also common features in psychiatric disorders could be associated with 
misophonia (Potgieter et al., 2019 ). 
Personality, especially neurotic traits, is associated with a variety of 
psychiatric disorders (Calati et al., 2008 ; Celikel et al., 2009 ; Joyce, 
Light, Rowe, Cloninger, & Kennedy, 2010 ; Svrakic et al., 2002 ). Studies 
indicate that neuroticism is an important personality trait for general 
psychopathology risk (Ormel et al., 2013 ; Lahey, 2009 ). Psychoticism is 
related to tough-mindedness such as being intolerant, belittling, acting 
disruptively, and lacking in empathy (Heath & Martin, 1990 ). Miso-
phonic behaviours of the individuals can be disturbing to others via 
harsh criticism, anger outburst or failure of empathic understanding of 
reasonable explanations of the origins of misophonia trigger sounds such 
as making nasal sounds because of a rhino-sinusitis or hand-tapping due 
to exam anxiety. These behaviors can be understood as an expression of 
personality that can be admitted to the psychoticism factor. Further -
more, personality is found to be important in noise sensitivity (Shep-
herd, Heinonen-Guzejev, Hautus, & Heikkil a, 2015 ). According to this 
study, personality can have independent effects, accounted for 33% of 
the variance, on noise sensitivity. A recent study indicates that sensi-
tivity and emotional reactions towards unpleasant stimuli in misophonic 
individuals might be related to neuroticism (Daniels, Rodriguez, & 
Zabelina, 2020 ). Therefore, personality, especially neuroticism, could 
be an important mediator on misophonic symptoms in psychiatric pa-
tients which is worth investigating as a candidate trait. 
Misophonia was also shown to be related to obsessive and compul -
sive symptoms, especially with obsessive thoughts (Cusack, Cash, & 
Vrana, 2018 ). Obsessive-compulsive symptoms associated with ordering 
and harm avoidance dimensions, not compulsive symptoms such as 
handwashing or neutralizing, are shown to be related to misophonia 
(McKay et al., 2018 ). Obsessive-compulsive symptoms were also shown 
as a mediator between anxiety sensitivity and misophonic symptom 
severity (Cusack et al., 2018 ). These significant results underline the 
importance of obsessive and compulsive traits in misophonia. However, 
it is not well established that this is still the case for psychiatric patients 
that can be valuable to investigate the associations between these conditions. Another important facet of misophonia could be aggressive 
traits. However, trait aggression is not investigated and most of the 
studies were focused on state anger to misophonic triggers (Wu, Lewin, 
Murphy, & Storch, 2014 ; Zhou, Wu, & Storch, 2017 ). 
Anxiety is an expected response due to trigger sounds associated with 
misophonia Dozier & Morrison, 2017 ). However, little is known about 
the relations between trait anxiety and misophonia. In a recent study, 
baseline anxiety (pre-stimulus anxiety level) was found to be directly 
related to emotional responses towards trigger sounds associated with 
misophonia (Daniels et al., 2020 ). Anxiety was also shown to be an 
important mediator for aggressive reactions towards misophonic sounds 
(Wu et al., 2014 ). Anger reactions towards others were also found to be 
associated with misophonia (McKay et al., 2018 ). But it is not clear that 
anger reactions are a state or a trait feature in misophonia. So, both trait 
anxiety and aggression could be important features associated with 
strong aversive emotions and associated behaviors due to misophonic 
trigger sounds in psychiatric patients. 
Somatosensory amplification is another trait feature that could be 
associated with misophonia (Barsky, Goodson, Lane, & Cleary, 1988 ; 
Venugopal, Mohan, & Chaturvedi, 2006 ). Somatosensory amplification 
is defined as a general disposition to experience ordinary bodily sensa -
tions as uncomfortable and disturbing. Besides, sensations that are 
mildly noxious or disturbing might be experienced as very painful and 
catastrophic via the somatosensory amplification process. Somatosen -
sory amplification is a neurobiologically valid and widely accepted 
feature in the pathophysiology of somatic symptom and related disor -
ders (Nakao & Barsky, 2007 ; Çolak et al., 2021 ). Somatosensory 
amplification could interfere with normal sensory processing probably 
with associated affective and cognitive outcomes (Koteles & Witth oft, 
2017 ). Indeed, sensory processing is defined as sequential neural pro-
cessing for organizing visceral and autonomic sensations from ones ’ own 
body and the external world (Williams, Tinley, & Curtin, 2010 ), and 
deficits of sensory processing were suggested as a candidate mediator in 
the pathophysiology of misophonia (Schroder et al., 2013 ). Moreover, in 
a recent study, misophonia was found to be associated with physical 
concerns which are defined as sensitivity towards interoceptive sensa -
tions as a part of anxiety sensitivity (McKay et al., 2018 ). Therefore, 
somatosensory amplification would be suggested as a potential trait 
feature in association with misophonic symptoms. 
Evidence suggests that misophonic symptoms, although they fluc-
tuate slightly over time, emerge in adolescence and tend to have a 
chronic course; this, in turn, could be viewed as evidence that certain 
psychological traits could be features of misophonia (Rouw & Erfanian, 
2018 ; Siepsiak & Dragan, 2019 ). However, the association of miso-
phonic symptoms with other psychological traits has still not been 
investigated. As mentioned above, misophonia could potentially be 
related to personality (especially with neurotic traits), anxiety prone -
ness, obsessiveness, and aggressive tendencies. Furthermore, somato -
sensory amplification could be an important candidate for the sensory 
processing deficits in misophonia. A coherent picture of the relations 
between associated psychological traits and misophonia can give valu-
able insights into the underlying causes of this intractable condition. 
Additionally, results are far from to be conclusive due to the lack of 
studies from clinical populations. Trait phenotypes associated with 
psychiatric disorders can be valuable in this respect. 
In this study, we aimed to investigate the associations of specific 
psychological trait variables with misophonic symptoms in psychiatric 
outpatients. We hypothesized that misophonic symptoms could be 
positively associated with neuroticism, trait anxiety, obsessiveness, 
anger, and somatosensory amplification in psychiatric outpatients and 
predicted by them. B. Çolak et al.

32.Methods 
2.1. Participants 
Our study was carried out in the outpatient psychiatry clinic at 
University Hospital in Turkey in September 2019. The aim was to enroll 
enough number of consecutive outpatients who fulfill the inclusion 
criteria according to the calculated sample size. Patients with a mini-
mum of five years of education (primary education level in the country) 
were asked to participate in the study. Patients diagnosed with psychotic 
disorders, bipolar disorder, intellectual disability, cognitive disorders, 
and alcohol/drug-related disorders and marked to severely symptomatic 
patients were also excluded (mildly symptomatic patients were 
included). 
2.2. Procedure 
Patients received information about the study and invited to 
participate. Written and verbal informed consents were obtained from 
patients who agreed to participate to the study. Diagnostic assessments 
were conducted according to the established routines in the outpatient 
clinic and assessments for inclusion and exclusion to the study were 
done by experienced psychiatrists. Patients who were eligible filled the 
measures of the study in a single session on the day of their routine 
psychiatric assessments and treatments. The study has been approved by 
the local ethics committee. 
2.3. Measures 
2.3.1. Sociodemographic data collection 
Information about the age, gender, marital, educational, and occu-
pational status of the participants was obtained. 
2.3.2. Misophonic Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ) 
Misophonic Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ) is a 4-point Likert type 
scale developed by (Oz & Kılıç, 2017 ). The checklist assesses both types 
and severity of misophonic symptoms and includes 50 different sounds. 
The total score will be between 0 and 150; with higher scores indicating 
more severe misophonic symptoms. Psychometric assessments of the 
MSC has shown that the scale is both valid and reliable in assessing 
misophonic symptoms. 
2.3.3. Eysenck personality questionnaire revised-short form (EPQRS) 
The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Revised-Short Form (EPQR- 
S) is a self-report screening tool designed to assess three dimensions of 
personality; extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism. The instru -
ment consists of 6 yes/no questions for each personality dimension with 
6 additional questions belonging to the lying subscale for testing social 
desirability bias. The questionnaire was developed by Eysenck and 
Eysenck (1975) and was revised by Francis, Brown, and Philipchalk 
(1992) . The validity and reliability study of the Turkish version of 
EPQRS was done by Karanci (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975 ; Francis et al., 
1992 ; Karancı, Dirik, & Yorulmaz, 2007 ). 
2.3.4. Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI) 
Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI) was developed 
by Hodgson and Rachman and is designed to measure subsets of 
obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Hodgson & Rachman, 1977 ). MOCI 
comprises 30 yes/no items grouped into four subscales and higher scores 
indicate more serious obsessive-compulsive traits. The Turkish version 
of the inventory has been shown to have adequate validity and reli-
ability in a study conducted by Erol and Savasir (Erol & Savasir, 1989 ). 
In the Turkish form, seven items from the Minnesota Multiphasic Per-
sonality Inventory (MMPI) was added. 2.3.5. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) 
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was developed by Spielberger 
and Gorsuch and aims to measure both state and trait anxiety levels of 
individuals (Gaudry, Vagg, & Spielberger, 1975 ). The Turkish version 
has adequate psychometric properties shown in a study by Oner (Oner, 
1997 ). The instrument comprises 40 items grouping into two distinct 
categories: state and trait. The trait anxiety part of STAI was used in this 
research which comprises a total of 20 questions. Higher scores indicate 
higher trait anxiety. 
2.3.6. Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) 
Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) was developed by Buss 
and Perry and revised by them in 1992 (Buss & Perry, 1992 ). It measures 
4 dimensions of personality: physical and verbal aggression, rage, and 
hostility. The instrument comprises 29 5-point Likert-type items. Higher 
scores indicate higher levels of aggression. The Turkish version of BPAQ 
had high internal consistency (Chronbach ’s alpha .85) and stability 
(reliability coefficients 0.97) (Demirtas-Madran, 2012 ). 
2.3.7. Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SASS) 
Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SASS) was developed to assess 
the amplification of various somatic and visceral sensations that are not 
the symptoms of serious diseases. It measures various domains from 
bodily and visceral sensations such as auditory, visual, noxious, or 
visceral sensory modalities. It was created by Barsky and translated to 
Turkish by Güleç & Sayar (Barsky, Wyshak, & Klerman, 1990 ; Güleç & 
Sayar, 2007 ) with high internal consistency (Chronbach ’s alpha .78) and 
test-retest reliability (0.73). The instrument comprises 10 5-point Likert 
type items. The score ranges from 10 to 50 points. Individuals with 
higher scores are more prone to perceive somatic sensations as more 
intense and disturbing. 
2.4. Statistical analyses 
Descriptive variables were given by mean SD, n (%) or median 
(range), appropriately. T-tests were conducted for MSQ scores in de-
mographic groups. Pearson or Spearman correlation was performed to 
investigate the association between misophonic symptoms and MOCI, 
EPQRS, BPAQ, STAI, SASS according to the normality assumptions, 
appropriately. Mann-Whitney U and independent samples t-tests were 
conducted for group comparisons in terms of MSQ scores and admission 
status (first admission or one than more admission) and medication 
status (use or no-use), respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses 
were performed to explore independent associations between each risk 
variable as a predictor of MSQ using the ‘enter method ’. All the pre-
dictors in a block were entered in a single step. MOCI, EPQRS- 
neuroticism, BPAQ, STAI, and SASS were included as independent var-
iables in the model. Multicollinearity analyses were conducted for 
testing possible correlations between these variables. Total sample size 
of n 138 was calculated by g-power program (effect size f2 0.15, α 
err prob 0.05, power 0.95 with 5 predictors). Data of patients with 
missing values were excluded from further analyses (n: 23). All statis -
tical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social 
Science (SPSS, version 23.0 for Windows). A p-value of D.05 was 
considered to be statistically significant. 
3.Results 
A total of 163 patients enrolled in the study and data from 140 pa-
tients were included in the final analyses. MSQ scores were not signifi -
cantly different according to socio-demographic variables as gender 
(t  0.622; p .535), educational (F 1.735; p .180), marital 
(t  0.091; p .928) and occupational (t 0.516; p .626) status. 
Overall, 120 patients (85.7%) were under follow-up and 20 patients 
(14.3%) were during first admission. There was no difference between 
these groups in terms of MSQ scores (Z  0.569, p .570). Diagnosis of B. Çolak et al.

4the patients were as follows: depression (n: 29; 20.7%), generalized 
anxiety disorder (n:17; 12.1%), generalized anxiety disorder-not 
otherwise specified (n: 13; 9.3%), adjustment disorder (n: 18; 12.9%), 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (n: 5; 3.6%), attention deficit and hy-
peractivity disorder (n: 9; 6.4%), insomnia disorder (n: 7; 5.0%), panic 
disorder (n: 7; 5.0%), social anxiety disorder (n: 4; 2.9%), functional 
neurological symptom disorder (n: 4; 2.9%), trauma related disorders 
(n: 3; 2.1%), eating disorder (n: 2; 1.4%), sexual dysfunction (n: 2; 
1.4%), tic disorder (n: 2; 1.4%), gender dysphoria (n: 2; 1.4%). 
Of these, 109 (77.9%) patients were using psychotropic medications. 
From these, 75 (53.6%) patients were on monotherapy, and 34 (24.3%) 
patients were on combination therapy in terms of psychotropic medi -
cation. Only a small number of patients (n: 11; 7.8%) were on psycho -
therapy and last, 20 (14.3%) patients were on their first admission as 
mentioned above. There were no significant difference between patients 
who were on medication or not in terms of MSQ scores (t 0.791; p 
.430). Medication status were as follows: Selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) (n: 55; 39.3%), selective serotonin noradrenaline re-
uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (n: 8; 5.7%), SSRIs antipsychotics (AP) (n: 
19; 13.6%), SNRIs AP (n: 5; 3.6%), SSRIs atypical or tricyclic (TCA) 
antidepressants (n: 7; 5.0%), TCA (n: 3; 2.1%), psychostimulants (n: 7; 
5.0%), SSRIs psychostimulants (n: 3; 2.1%), atypical antidepressants 
(n:2; 1,4%). Sociodemographic, clinical and psychological variables of 
the sample are given in Table 1. 
There were significant weak correlations between MSQ and EPQRS- 
neuroticism (rho 0.179; p .039); mild correlations between MSQ 
and BPAQ (r 0.310; p D.001), STAI (r 0.362; p D.001) and moder -
ate correlations between MSQ and MOCI (r 0.431; p D.001), SASS 
(r 0.546; p D.001). Other character traits, extraversion 
(rho  0.107; p .221) and psychoticism (rho 0.050; p .566), were not related with MSQ scores. Age was not related with MSQ 
(r 0.131; p .125). Age was inversely correlated with BPAQ 
(r  0.215; p .013) but not with MOCI (r 0.104; p .225), EPQRS- 
neuroticism (rho  0.113; p .198), STAI(r 0.028; p .748) and 
SASS (r 0.129; p .137). Correlations of MOCI, EPQRS, BPAQ, STAI 
and SASS between MSQ were given in Table 2. 
Analysis conducted to see if the data met the assumption of collin -
earity indicated that multicollinearity was not a concern (BPAQ, 
Tolerance 0.77, VIF 1.28; SASS, Tolerance 0.72, VIF 1.372; 
STAI, Tolerance 0.44, VIF 2.24; MOCI, Tolerance 0.43, 
VIF 2.32; EPQRS-neuroticism, Tolerance 0.60, VIF 1.64). In the 
multiple regression analyses, these variables significantly predicted 
MSQ scores and explained 32.5% of the variance (R2 0.352, F 
(5,119) 12.953, p D.001). The analysis shows that STAI (Beta 0.04, 
t(124) 0.32, p .747), BPAQ (Beta 0.15, t(124) 1.74, p .083), 
EPQRS-neuroticism (Beta  0.13, t(124)  1.40, p .162) did not 
significantly predict MSQ scores, however only SASS (Beta 0.39, t 
(124) 4.52, p D.001) and MOCI (Beta 0.25, t(124) 2.25, p .026) 
scores were the significant predictors in the full model (see Table 3). 
4.Discussion 
In this study, we investigated the association of trait psychological 
variables with misophonic symptoms and significant correlations were 
found between misophonic symptoms and various psychological trait 
variables such as obsessive-compulsive symptoms, neuroticism, trait 
anxiety, somatosensory amplification, and aggression in non-psychotic 
psychiatric outpatients. No significant correlations were found be-
tween misophonic symptoms and the other personality dimensions 
namely extraversion and psychoticism. Sociodemographic and clinical 
variables were not associated with MSQ scores. Multiple regression 
analyses showed that a full model consisting of scores of EPQRS- 
neuroticism, BPAQ, STAI, SASS, and MOCS significantly predicted the 
misophonic symptoms. However, MOCS and SASS remained to be sig-
nificant in the full model even after adjustment. This is the key finding of 
our study which requires further consideration. 
4.1. Neuroticism and misophonia 
Neuroticism, not psychoticism or extraversion, correlated signifi -
cantly with misophonia symptoms. Previous studies indicate personality 
could be an important mediator on noise sensitivity (Stansfeld, Clark, 
Jenkins, & Tarnopolsky, 1985 ; Stansfeld, 1992 ). Also, neuroticism was 
shown to be positively related to noise sensitivity where extraversion 
was inversely related (Dornic & Ekehammar, 1990 ). However, this was 
not replicated in another study (Shepherd et al., 2015 ). To our knowl -
edge, the only study on the association between neuroticism and miso-
phonia was conducted by Daniels et al. (2020) . The primary measure of 
the study was not assessing personality but neuroticism was used as a 
covariate. In that study, neuroticism was found to be related both to 
sound sensitivity and emotional behaviours towards misophonia trigger 
sounds. Therefore, our results were in line with the findings of the 
aforementioned study. As a general risk factor towards psychiatric dis-
orders, neuroticism could be accepted as an important psychological 
trait towards misophonia; however, it did not remain as a significant 
predictor in the full regression model. So, to our opinion, this finding 
indicates that misophonia is a stable and distinct entity irrespective of 
personality. To our knowledge, ours was the first study that reports an 
association between misophonia symptoms and neuroticism in a clinical 
group. This finding needs to be replicated in further studies both for 
clinical and non-clinical samples. 
4.2. Trait aggression and misophonia 
Trait aggression evaluated by BPAQ correlated significantly with

5predictor in the full regression model. Wu et al. (2014) have previously 
reported a significant association between anger outbursts and miso-
phonia. In this study, also anxiety was a mediator for anger reactions 
towards misophonia. Similar results were also shown in another study 
(Zhou et al., 2017 ). In these studies, the ‘Rage Outbursts and Anger 
Rating Scale ’ were used to assess symptoms in the previous weeks unlike 
our assessment with BPAQ which reflects trait aggression. Aggressive -
ness was not also a robust feature in another study although mild cor-
relations towards misophonia were observed (McKay et al., 2018 ). 
Therefore, our results are in line with this finding that trait aggression is 
not a robust predictor of misophonia. It can be concluded that there are 
other possible mediators towards anger that could explain the mecha -
nism of misophonia. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first 
study that assessed the relation between trait aggression and misopho -
nia. Future studies should be conducted to explore the role of trait 
aggression either as an exogenous or endogenous risk factor for miso-
phonia related behaviours. 
4.3. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and misophonia 
We also found a significant association between misophonic and 
obsessive-compulsive symptoms, as measured by MOCI and it remained 
as one of the significant predictors in the full regression model. This 
finding is in line with previous researches that obsessiveness is an 
important feature of the cognitive model of misophonia (Cusack et al., 
2018 ; McGuire et al., 2015 ; Siepsiak & Dragan, 2019 ). Although 
different scales such as ‘Obsessive-compulsive inventory revised ’ and 
MOCI were used in different populations (e.g. clinical, 
population-based); it seems to be a robust finding that misophonia has 
relations to obsessive-compulsive traits in the clinical group. 
4.4. Trait anxiety and misophonia 
Previous studies have reported an association between higher levels 
of anxiety and misophonia symptoms (Quek et al., 2018 ; Wu et al., 
2014 ), prompting a discussion of misophonia symptoms as a possible 
consequence of anxiety. However, these studies have used a time scale 
which only assessed anxiety levels during the previous weeks. We found 
a significant correlation between misophonia symptoms and trait anxiety which is defined as an inclination to react anxiously towards 
general distress. In a recent study conducted by Daniels et al. (2020) , 
trait anxiety was found to be not correlated with misophonic symptom 
severity; probably due to methodological issues such as sampling and 
psychometric measures. 
On the other hand, the association between anxiety and misophonia 
is complicated which needs further elaboration. In our study, trait 
anxiety was mildly correlated with misophonia severity. However, it 
was not found to be a significant predictor in the full regression model. 
Therefore, different dimensions of anxiety should be taken into account 
(Mcwilliams & Brian, 2001 ). For instance, anxiety sensitivity was sug-
gested as an associated feature of misophonia severity (Cusack et al., 
2018 ). Anxiety sensitivity in misophonia could be defined as a fear of 
fear towards arousal related experiences, as unpleasant sounds in 
misophonia, which in turn leads to aggressive reactions for coping with 
the disturbing sensations (Wu et al., 2014 ). Although we did not have 
any measures to evaluate anxiety sensitivity, it may have some sub-
stantial effect on misophonia severity (as discussed later). Nonetheless, 
we showed the first evidence that misophonic sensitivity has a signifi -
cant positive correlation with trait anxiety in psychiatric outpatients. 
Future studies should focus on the association between different di-
mensions of anxiety and misophonia. 
4.5. Somatosensory amplification and misophonia 
We found that the severity of somatosensory amplification was 
significantly associated with misophonic symptoms even in the fully 
adjusted statistical models. McKay et al. (2018) showed that physical 
concerns as sensitivity towards interoceptive sensations discriminated 
individuals with misophonia from non-misophonics (McKay et al., 
2018 ). In that study, Anxiety Sensitivity Index –3 was used to assess the 
three dimensions (cognitive, social, and physical) of anxiety. Further -
more, Bodily Perception Scale scores which was also another measure 
for bodily sensations and interoceptive signals was found to have sig-
nificant correlations with misophonic symptoms in that study. In a 
previous study, dispositional interoceptive focus, as indicated by body 
awareness, was shown to be an important facet of somatosensory 
amplification (Koteles & Doering, 2016 ). All these results could indicate 
a salient overlap between somatosensory amplification and anxiety 
sensitivity. 
According to Perez, Barsky, Vago, Baslet, and Silbersweig (2015) , 
interactions between enhanced cortical or subcortical sensory process -
ing, cognitive evaluation, and affective modification of visceral or pe-
ripheral stimuli lead to the way to somatosensory amplification. 
Attentional bias, negative anticipation, catastrophizing, negative mood 
which also constitute the core features of misophonia are all proposed to 
be related to somatosensory amplification (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Pot-
gieter et al., 2019 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ). Indeed, evidence from 
neuroscientific research could contribute to our findings. For instance, 
in a recent fMRI study, anterior insula which has a pivotal role in the Table 2

6perception of interoceptive signals as a part of the salience network; 
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hippocampus, and amygdala 
which are associated with the cognitive and emotional aspects of so-
matic conditions were found to be associated with misophonia (Kumar 
et al., 2017 ). These brain regions are also associated with the neural 
network of somatosensory amplification (Boeckle, Schrimpf, Liegl, & 
Pieh, 2016 ; Bourke, Langford, & White, 2015 ; Perez et al., 2015 ). This 
overlap can be an important missing link in the pathophysiology of 
misophonia as a candidate feature in this respect. For example, trait 
anxiety was shown to be related to enhanced functional connectivity 
between insula and periaqueductal gray matter that leads to increased 
pain perception via its effect on thalamo-cortical sensory gating (Perez 
et al., 2015 ). Somatosensory amplification with its cognitive amplifiers 
and affective modifiers which interfere with enhanced auditory pro-
cessing could be the basis of anxiety sensitivity in this regard. To our 
knowledge, ours is the first study that indicates a possible link between 
somatosensory amplification and misophonia and this should be inves -
tigated in further studies. 
4.6. Limitations 
Although there is a growing interest in misophonia, the basis of its 
mechanism is still in nascent stages. Research on underlying interme -
diate phenotypes is valuable in this respect. We have investigated 
prominent psychological traits associated with misophonia in a psy-
chiatric outpatient sample, however with some limitations. First, the 
generalizability of our findings to all psychiatric patients is limited since 
the study sample consisted of outpatients in a single university hospital 
psychiatry department, and due to the exclusion of psychotic or other 
severe psychiatric disorders. Second, some of our findings might be due 
to the number of analyses being carried out and represent type I statis -
tical error. So, this limitation should be bear in mind when interpreting 
our results. Third, even though we are reporting preliminary evidence 
for trait features for misophonia; state assessments still need to be 
considered in understanding misophonia. For instance; depressed mood 
could interfere with self-reported psychological variables. For mini-
mizing the impact of state variables, we only enrolled patients who were 
mildly symptomatic and we have excluded severe psychiatric disorders. 
Although diagnoses such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or anxiety 
disorders could have a stronger inclination towards misophonia; due to 
the heterogeneity of the psychiatric diagnoses in our sample, it sounds 
methodologically not feasible to control diverse psychiatric symptoms. 
Fourth, self-report nature of the scales might interfere with the out-
comes. Finally, the cross-sectional methodology in our study does not 
allow us to draw conclusions about causality. 
4.7. Conclusion and future directions 
Ours is the first study reporting associations between trait psycho -
logical features and misophonic symptoms in a sample consisted of 
psychiatric outpatients. In line with previous reports in non-clinical 
population we have demonstrated that obsessive and compulsive traits 
are also significant in the clinical population. Finally, we have found 
some evidence regarding somatosensory amplification which has some 
overlaps with anxiety sensitivity as a possible explanation for the eti-
ology. These findings might contribute to the understanding of miso-
phonia as a phenomenological/clinical entity. Future studies are 
warranted to investigate the roles of these constructs, especially re-
lations between somatosensory amplification, obsessive-compulsive 
traits, anxiety sensitivity as well as different aspects of misophonia.
