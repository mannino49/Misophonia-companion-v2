Comorbidity ABSTRACT  
Diagnosing comorbid psychosis and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) may be challenging 
among severely malnourished patients. Malnutrition is an identified medical cause of psychosis and in patients 
with ARFID, symptoms mirroring psychosis could be secondary to weight loss versus a “true” thought disorder. 
Conversely, dietary restriction has been demonstrated in patients with psychosis, which conceivably, could result 
in the development of ARFID. In this case report, we present a medically hospitalized adolescent male with 
severe malnutrition, diagnosed with ARFID after 12-months of food avoidance due to sensory sensitivities and 
fears of gastrointestinal discomfort. A significant decline in his emotional, interpersonal, and cognitive func-
tioning was also reported and attributed to severe malnutrition. With nutritional rehabilitation, the patient ’s 
eating behaviors and mental state unexpectedly declined, and he was ultimately diagnosed with comorbid 
psychosis.   
Introduction 
Research demonstrates a significant association between symptoms 
of psychosis and disordered eating (Brodrick et al., 2020 ; Ganson et al., 
2022 ; Mensi et al., 2020 ; Miotto et al., 2010 ; Solmi et al., 2018 ). How-
ever, prior studies have not described co-occurring psychosis and avoi-
dant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). Introduced in DSM-5 
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013 ), ARFID is characterized by 
food avoidance secondary to sensory aversions (e.g., food taste, texture), 
fears that eating will result in aversive consequences (e.g., vomiting, 
choking, gastrointestinal pain), food neophobia, and/or low appetitive 
drive in the absence of weight and/or appearance related concerns (Brig-
ham et al., 2018 ; Norris et al., 2014 ). 
Food avoidance has also been described in the context of psychosis 
(Poletti et al., 2022 ). For example, paranoia about food contamination 
and/or olfactory hallucinations that make food unpalatable can trigger 
dietary restriction, conceivably resulting in the development of ARFID. 
For some, ARFID symptoms could also reflect prodromal signs of psy-
chosis (Kelly et al., 2004 ), insofar as a functional decline can preempt 
illness onset (Seidman et al., 2010 ). For example, distinct sensory fea-
tures have been described prior to the onset of psychosis, including 
greater sensory sensitivities, sensory avoidance, and reduced sensory seeking (Parham et al., 2019 ) that could trigger food avoidance and a 
subsequent ARFID diagnosis. 
Recognizing co-occurring psychosis and ARFID has unique chal-
lenges. In ARFID, severe dietary restriction can result in malnutrition 
and serious medical sequelae (Feillet et al., 2019 ; Nitsch et al., 2021 ). 
Malnutrition is an identified medical cause of psychosis with cognitive, 
emotional, and neurobiological changes that mirror those evidenced in 
clinical psychosis. For example, individuals with malnutrition and/or 
clinical psychosis can demonstrate withdrawal and avoidance, mood 
changes, and emotion dysregulation (Merritt et al., 2020 ), delayed 
processing speed, impaired reasoning and decision making (Fonville 
et al., 2014 ; Van den Eynde et al., 2012 ), atypical sensory processing 
(Saure et al., 2022 ), global visuospatial deficits and biased detail pro-
cessing (Mountjoy et al., 2014 ; Solmi et al., 2018 ), and progressive 
reduction of cortical gray matter (Kerem and Katzman, 2003 ; Olabi 
et al., 2011 ; Van den Eynde et al., 2012 ). Thus, in severely malnourished 
individuals with ARFID, symptoms approximating psychosis may be 
solely conceptualized as malnutrition sequelae and in cases of “true” 
co-occurring psychosis, could negatively impact treatment planning and 
prognosis. 
Herein, we present an adolescent male who was medically hospi -
talized for severe bradycardia in the context of ARFID. Emotional, social,

2and cognitive decline coinciding with weight loss was attributed to se-
vere malnutrition. Upon admission, the patient reported treatment 
motivation and slowly increased his nutritional intake. However, with 
weight gain and the resolution of bradycardia, he became progressively 
agitated and withdrawn, with a notable regression in his eating behav -
iors, prompting discharge to an inpatient psychiatric facility upon sta-
bilization. Ultimately, the patient reported imminent safety concerns 
and disclosed symptoms of comorbid psychosis. 
Case presentation 
A 16-year-old white cisgender male presented to the emergency 
department of a pediatric medical center in the United States for severe 
abdominal pain and constipation in the setting of a 22.3 kg weight loss, 
or 30% of his total body weight. Assessment indicated severe and critical 
bradycardia to 27 beats per minute, prompting admission to the pedi-
atric intensive care unit. Elevated transaminase and prolonged coagu -
lation were also noted. After five days, he was transferred to the 
hospital’s adolescent medicine eating disorder service, where he 
received specialized, multidisciplinary care. 
Upon hospitalization, the patient’s diet was limited to liquids and 
soft foods, including cream of rice, oatmeal, bananas, apples, and a 
specific type of protein bar, which he heated in the microwave to soften. 
He had begun restricting his diet 12 months prior, when he and his 
immediate family (including his biological parents and fraternal twin 
brother) collectively started a vegetarian diet. Although his family 
members resumed eating meat within a few weeks, the patient described 
meat as “repulsive” and maintained the vegetarian diet. (Notably, there 
were no prior concerns with eating meat.) The next few months, he 
developed numerous sensory aversions, including chewing sounds and 
specific smells, flavors, textures, and food combinations, resulting in his 
avoidance of many foods and situations that involved eating. He artic-
ulated a genuine fear of eating many foods and was emphatic that his 
limited diet was “safer.” He began experiencing gastrointestinal 
discomfort which further reinforced food avoidance. He became 
increasingly isolated, refusing to be in the company of others when they 
ate and refusing to eat when others were present. He reported that peers 
began making unkind comments about his eating behaviors, prompting 
distress and avoidance of social situations. (In confidence, his mother 
described the patient as socially hypersensitive; she believed that his 
peers had expressed concern about his health.) 
The patient had no prior psychiatric, medical, or developmental 
problems. Previously described as kind and shy, the patient had become 
increasingly sad and irritable over the past year. Sleep difficulties were 
also noted. He was an above average student with no history of learning 
or attention problems yet in recent months, had struggled to concen -
trate, pay attention, and make decisions. Socially, the patient was 
described as an introvert who had a few friends but preferred spending 
time alone or with his twin brother. His family history was notably 
significant for obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, and schizo -
phrenia, all in second-degree relatives. Upon admission, he presented as 
cachectic yet well-groomed, and appeared his stated age. He was 
guarded with providers, with minimal speech, limited eye contact, and 
blunted affect. When asked direct questions, he demonstrated a long 
response time which although not formally assessed, appeared consis -
tent with cognitive processing delays. His responses were limited to 
“yes” or “no” and he provided minimal details to open-ended questions. 
Following admission, underlying medical causes of the patient’s 
gastrointestinal concerns and cardiac complications were ruled out. A 
primary diagnosis of ARFID was given, insofar as food refusal was sec-
ondary to sensory aversions and fear of anticipated gastrointestinal 
discomfort, in the absence of weight and/or shape concerns. Comorbid 
psychiatric diagnoses were tentatively ruled out in the absence of pre-
morbid mental health concerns, coupled with the onset of functional 
impairment (e.g., emotional changes, social isolation, concentration 
difficulties) after he began losing weight. As such, his recent functional decline was conceptualized as a consequence of severe malnutrition. 
Further, sensory aversions were tentatively classified as misophonia, a 
condition characterized by strong emotional reactions (e.g., irritation, 
disgust, anger) and autonomic arousal to specific auditory, visual, and/ 
or sensory triggers resulting in a hyperfocus on and/or avoidance of cue- 
related stimuli (Swedo et al., 2022), most often developing in childhood 
or early adolescence (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018). The patient’s experi -
ence of worsening sensory sensitivity with the progression of weight loss 
was also attributed to malnourishment, since atypical sensory process -
ing and heightened sensory sensitivity/vigilance are associated with 
greater malnourishment (Saure et al., 2022; Zucker et al., 2013). Finally, 
the patient’s gastrointestinal symptoms were considered secondary to 
dietary changes and weight loss, consistent with research highlighting 
this association (Norris et al., 2014). 
Of note, there was family history of schizophrenia, and the medical 
team considered the possibility of a burgeoning psychotic illness. 
However, the patient’s severely malnourished state precluded a valid 
assessment of “true” versus medically induced symptoms of psychosis. 
Thus, medical stabilization and nutritional rehabilitation were priori -
tized before psychosis could be ruled out. 
The primary goal of hospitalization was the resolution of the pa-
tient’s acute medical complications. Given risks for refeeding syndrome, 
a standard refeeding protocol was implemented upon admission, 
including a slowly advanced, calorie-controlled diet with intensive 
medical monitoring and per needed supplementation. Initial meetings 
with the psychologist focused on psychoeducation about ARFID, with an 
emphasis on nutritional rehabilitation via volume before variety (e.g., 
meeting caloric needs by consuming an adequate volume of preferred 
foods before increasing the variety of foods consumed; Brigham et al., 
2018). Providers encouraged the patient to consume nutrition by mouth, 
but he was very anxious and requested that nasogastric (NG) feeds be 
used to supplement his oral intake. Although NG feeds can foster 
ongoing food avoidance in patients with ARFID and prolong hospitali -
zation (Feillet et al., 2019; Strandjord et al., 2015), his providers lacked 
confidence that he could meet caloric needs orally. Given his critical 
medical condition, an NG tube was placed and considered a short-term, 
life-saving intervention. 
Secondary goals of the hospitalization included: 1) weaning off NG 
feeds and consuming all nutritional requirements orally; 2) learning and 
implementing skills to manage gastrointestinal discomfort; 3) beginning 
exposure-based interventions to increase the variety of foods consumed; 
and 4) eating in the presence of others. Discharge disposition would be 
contingent on the patient’s progress toward secondary goals, with op-
tions for outpatient psychotherapy or inpatient psychiatric treatment. 
Upon NG placement, the patient consumed a small proportion of his 
daily calories by mouth, restricting his intake to “safe” foods like 
oatmeal, ice cream, and bananas. He disliked the NG tube and was 
motivated for its removal. With encouragement, he agreeably increased 
his intake of liquid supplements and “safe” foods over the first ten days 
of hospitalization. NG feeds were concurrently weaned and ultimately 
discontinued. The patient’s affect brightened significantly, and he was 
more engaged with providers. Gastrointestinal concerns were denied 
during this time and the patient declined offers to learn pain manage -
ment strategies for any future discomfort. 
Following NG removal, the psychologist introduced exposure-based 
interventions, including the development of a fear hierarchy and initi-
ating low-level exposures to prime the patient and family for future 
outpatient interventions. The patient lacked insight into ARFID-related 
consequences; he was emphatic that avoiding foods did not cause 
impairment and that having a very limited diet would not have future 
consequences. He was unable and/or unwilling to identify any potential 
benefits of exposures and declined participation. A reward system was 
implemented and per needed hydroxyzine (10 mg) was prescribed, yet 
the patient’s resistance to exposures intensified. Whereas moderate 
resistance to exposure-based interventions among individuals with 
anxiety is common (Selles et al., 2013), the patient’s objections were N. Bennett and A. Matthews

3markedly higher than those typically displayed in our clinical 
experience. 
Despite these setbacks, the patient consistently met daily caloric 
expectations by eating and drinking – a vast accomplishment consid -
ering his behaviors upon admission. However, his persistent avoidant 
behaviors were extreme and severely impairing. His inability and/or 
unwillingness to participate in exposures while in a controlled and 
supportive environment (i.e., the hospital) did not bode well for suc-
cessful outpatient treatment. His mother was encouraged to set clear 
expectations for the patient to complete exposures and to integrate 
feared foods into his diet. If these expectations were not met, discharge 
to an inpatient psychiatric program would be recommended, where the 
patient could receive intensive treatment. The patient expressed frus-
tration about the plan but agreed to participate because he wanted to go 
home. He ultimately agreed to do an exposure of holding crunchy cereal 
in his hands. His mother was present during the exposure and received 
coaching to assist with these interventions at home. The patient 
appeared highly anxious during the exposure and was fidgety while 
holding the cereal. He reported a significant decline in anxiety over ten 
minutes and immediately asked the provider to leave his room when the 
exposure was completed. 
The patient declined participation in additional exposures and was 
surprisingly agreeable to a psychiatric hospitalization upon medical 
stabilization. He acknowledged the need for additional help but was 
unwilling to engage in additional evidence-based treatments for anxiety 
during his medical stay. He became increasingly irritable and with-
drawn over the next two weeks, refusing to talk with providers and 
declining visits with staff and family. His eating behaviors also 
regressed; he stopped eating “safe” foods, instead drinking liquid sup-
plements to fulfill caloric requirements. He implored that providers 
place another NG tube, reporting that eating was “too hard,” yet unable 
to articulate why. His mental and behavioral decline were unexpected 
considering a 7.6 kg weight gain and adequate resolution of brady -
cardia. His providers began to question the presence of co-occurring 
psychosis, particularly given the patient’s family history of 
schizophrenia. 
After 36-days of medical hospitalization, the patient was transferred 
to an inpatient adolescent psychiatric unit with specialized eating dis-
order treatment. He agreed to integrate new foods into his diet, 
reporting motivation to go home. Over nine days, he decreased his 
intake of liquid supplements, consumed a greater volume of “safe” 
foods, and added a few more foods to his repertoire. items. He gained an 
additional 3.3 kg and was discharged to outpatient cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) with family participation. 
One month after discharging home, the patient reported suicidal and 
homicidal ideation, visual and command auditory hallucinations, and 
paranoia at a weekly therapy appointment. He was readmitted to the 
inpatient psychiatric unit and was formally diagnosed with comorbid 
psychosis. These symptoms were not previously disclosed because the 
patient was afraid to talk about them and believed that they were his 
“own” thoughts. 
Discussion 
Accurate diagnosis is imperative for illness conceptualization, 
treatment planning, and optimal outcomes in psychiatric treatment. 
This novel case highlights the potential for symptom overlap in psy-
chosis and ARFID and demonstrates the potential to overlook co- 
occurring psychosis in severely malnourished patients with ARFID. As 
such, it is recommended that diagnostic assessment be a dynamic pro-
cess, conducted over the course of weight restoration. Malnutrition can 
“mask” comorbid psychopathology (Brodrick et al., 2020) and nutri-
tional rehabilitation is required to rule out co-occurring psychosis in 
ARFID. 
In this case, the patient’s functional decline was initially attributed to 
malnutrition. However, with weight gain it became increasingly evident that these impairments were neither solely nor primarily due to signif -
icant weight loss. Upon diagnosis of comorbid psychosis, the patient’s 
treatment plan was shifted to prioritize evidence-based safety planning, 
medication management, and CBT for psychosis and ARFID. 
In the described case, identification of comorbid psychosis was 
imperative for accurate symptom conceptualization and treatment 
planning. However, earlier detection of psychosis would not have 
altered his medical admission. For severely malnourished adolescents, 
evidence-based treatment necessitates that weight restoration and 
medical stabilization take precedence over psychotherapy for eating 
disorders and comorbidities (Lock and LeGrange, 2015). As such, if the 
patient had been diagnosed with comorbid psychosis upon hospitaliza -
tion, initial interventions would have still prioritized nutritional reha-
bilitation and medical stabilization prior to psychotherapy. However, 
diagnostic conceptualization and treatment recommendations would 
have differed. 
Conclusion 
This case report highlights the potential for comorbid psychosis and 
ARFID. In cases of clear symptom overlap, accurate conceptualization 
and diagnosis may be hindered by severe malnutrition which is a 
medical cause of psychosis. Ongoing psychiatric assessment throughout 
the weight restoration process is critical for diagnostic accuracy and 
optimal treatment planning. Future research should explore the nuanced 
interplay between symptoms of psychosis and ARFID.
