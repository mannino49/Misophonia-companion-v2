## ABSTRACT

## ARTICLE  HISTORY

Purpose: to understand the breadth of sensory dysregulation on participation in daily tasks for young people  with  tic  disorders,  as  research  identified  that  sensory  dysregulation  experiences  are  broader than  the  symptoms  being  assessed.

Methods: eighteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 families with children (5-16 years)  with  tic  disorders.  interviews  ranged  from  45  to  120 min  and  were  transcribed  verbatim. data  collected  from  parents  and  young  people  were  analysed  and  coded  together. thematic  analysis using  inductive  and  open  coding  methods  was  implemented  using  nVivo.

Results: the impact of sensory dysregulation on daily life may be understood through the higher-order theme: ''sensory, emotions and tics; it's a ticking time bomb'' , and three subthemes: (1) we sacrifice and adapt to get daily activities done in the home, (2) my child's experience of the community environment hinders  participation,  and  (3)  sensory  preferences  impact  our  entire  family.

Conclusion: Sensory dysregulation experiences impact the entire family's quality of life, yet patient-reported  sensory  measures  do  not  adequately  capture  the  impact  on  the  family  unit  and breath  of  symptoms.  a  sensory-based  measure  for  children  with  tics  is  needed  to  comprehensively assess sensory dysregulation sensitivities for this population, ensuring patients' needs and effectiveness of  therapy  can  be  measured.

## IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION h

- · this  qualitative  study  provides  health  professionals  with  a  greater  understanding  of  the  sensory dysregulation  experiences  of  children  and  young  people  with  tic  disorders.
- · this  study  highlights  that  the  sensory  dysregulation  experiences  of  children  and  young  people  are broader  than  the  symptoms  assessed  through  standardised  questionnaires.
- · to  comprehensively  assess  and  treat  sensory  dysregulation  in  clients  with  tics,  the  impact  on  the family  unit  needs  to  be  evaluated  and  understood.
- · When comprehensively assessing sensory dysregulation,  understanding  the  interplay  of  tics,  sensory and  emotional  dysregulation  aids  in  treatment  planning.

## Introduction

tic  disorders,  a  neurodevelopmental  disorder,  are  the  most  common movement disorder in childhood, affecting 1 in 100 children [1].  tics  are  repetitive,  stereotypical,  rapid,  non-rhythmic  movements  or  vocalisations  that  negatively  interrupt  a  child's  daily participation  [2-4].  according  to  the  diagnostic  and  Statistical Manual of Mental disorders 5 th  edition (dSM-V), when both vocal and  motor  tics  have  been  experienced  in  a  waxing  and  waning pattern  for  longer  than  one  year,  the  condition  is  referred  to  as tourette's syndrome (tS) [4]. co-existing neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric  conditions  are  present  in  80-90%  of  children with  tic  disorders  [1,5].  these  include  obsessive-compulsive  disorders  (ocd)  (30-40%),  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorders (adhd)  (54-60%)  and  autism  spectrum  disorders  (aSd)  (5-15%) [1,3,6].

as reported in people with other neurodevelopmental disorders [7-12],  children  with  tic  disorders  and  comorbidities  experience sensory  dysregulation  [6,13-22]  when  compared  with  typically developing children [23-25]. Sensory dysregulation is more prevalent  in  children  with  neurodevelopmental disorders than in typically developing children [26-32]. Sensory dysregulation has been extensively researched in children with aSd [1,30,33-42]. children with  adhd  were  identified  as  experiencing  increased  sensory

Sensory  dysregulation;  tic disorders;  qualitative  study; lived  experience;  paediatric

dysregulation symptoms [43-45] and 81% more likely in the presence  of  foetal  alcohol  syndrome  [7].  abnormal  sensory  dysregulation was also found to have a significant relationship with overall adaptive behaviour [46]. as was the case with children with adhd, children  with  ocd  were  also  reported  to  experience  increased sensory  dysregulation  symptoms  [31,47].

Yet,  there  is  limited  research  into  sensory  dysregulation  in children with tic disorders. Since the study by Jewers et al. [14], which investigated sensory dysregulation in children with tS and adhd  compared  with  children  with  only  tS,  there  has  been growing  interest  in  the  area  of  sensory  dysregulation  in  both children  [15,48-50]  and  adults  [22,51,52]  with  tic  disorders. Furthermore, there is a growing interest globally in research into sensory  dysregulation  in  children  with  various  neurodevelopmental  disorders,  with  research  occurring  in  australia  [32,53], brazil  [12],  canada  [7,14,54],  iran  [55],  israel  [15,56,57],  taiwan [58],  turkey  [59],  the  United  Kingdom  [50,60],  and  the  United States  of  america  [40,43,45,60,61].  With  growing  interest  in  the area  of  sensory  dysregulation  in  children  with  tic  disorders,  a recent  case  series  study  in  2018  was  the  first  article  to  report on misophonic experiences and associated clinical characteristics in  young  people  with  tic  disorders  [49].  Misophonia  is  the  triggering  of  inappropriate  or  extreme  emotional  or  psychological responses  due  to  certain  sounds.  this  study  by  Robinson  et  al. highlights misophonia could be an underestimated phenomenon for  abrupt  emotional  dysregulation  in  children  with  tic  disorders  [49].

convergent evidence from electrophysiological studies [62,63], magnetoencephalography [64], and neuroimaging [65,66] are suggestive  of  people  with  tic  disorders  and  tS  experiencing  altered sensory-motor  processing  involved  in  voluntary  movement  control.  deficits  in  sensorimotor gating, resulting in problems filtering irrelevant  sensory  stimuli,  have  been  reported  in  individuals  with tS  [13,63].  as  a  result  of  these  sensorimotor  abnormalities  experienced  by  people  with  tic  disorders,  tic  disorders  should  be  recognised  as  a  'sensorimotor'  phenomenon  rather  than  being understood  to  be  pure  movement  disorder  [1,6,15,19,62].

Several terms are used to describe these observed behaviours to sensory stimuli in children with neurodevelopmental disorders, including ''sensory dysregulation'' , ''sensory processing'' , and ''atypical  sensory  reactivity''  [15,34,62,67].  here,  we  use  the  term ''sensory  dysregulation''  [15,68,69].

Sensory dysregulation can result in functional impairment and impact  children's  participation  and  enjoyment  of  tasks  due  to their  atypical  reactions  to  sensory  stimuli  [70].  difficulties  associated with sensory dysregulation across various neurodevelopmental disorders have been categorised into five functional impairment areas:  (i)  decreased  social  skills  and  involvement  in  occupational performance areas; (ii) reduced frequency, duration, or complexity of adaptive responses; (iii) impaired self-confidence or self-esteem; (iv)  poor  family  and  daily  life  skills;  and  (v)  impaired  gross-motor, fine-motor  and  sensory-motor  skill  development  [60].  Sensory dysregulation  is  associated  with  reduced  enjoyment  and  participation  in  daily  life,  including  school  engagement  [24,30,37-39] and  increased  parental  stress  [9,30,70,71].

accordingly, the assessment and management of sensory dysregulation is an accepted part of comprehensive care for children with  neurodevelopmental  disorders  [72]. therapeutic  approaches are  commonly  used  to  address  sensory  dysregulation  in  children with neurodevelopmental disorders, with most of these strategies having been developed for children with aSd [34,73,74]. Validated, sensitive, reliable, and responsive clinician-, teacher-, patient-, and proxy-reported  outcome  measures  to  assess  treatment  efficiency are  necessary  for  clinical  use  in  sensory  dysregulation  [75].

our recent systematic review of a proxy-reported sensory-based measure  for  children  with  neurodevelopmental  disorders  found only  one  measure,  the  Participation  and  Sensory  environment Question home Scale (PSeQ-h) [76,77], satisfied moderate content validity [78]. the PSeQ-h was the only proxy-reported sensory-based measure  from  12  measures  evaluated  to  have  consulted  with consumers  as  part  of  measurement  development  to  ensure  the measure  was  comprehensive,  comprehensible  and  relevant  [78]. Yet  anecdotal  reports  from  paediatric  patients  with  tics  and  their parents described sensory dysregulation experiences not recorded by  either  the  PSeQ-h  or  the  other  commonly  used  proxy-report sensory-based  measures  [19,78].  these  reported  sensory  dysregulation  experiences  predominately  relate  to  auditory  sensitivities such as 'people-made' noise, including cutlery scraping on crockery, chewing of food, or the 'scratching' sounds of clothing [19,78]. a  recent  study  with  children  with  tic  disorders  reported  similar observations relating to experiences of auditory sensitivity to the same sounds made by other people [49]. it  is  uncertain  whether these  tic-specific  experiences  are  adequately  captured  in  current patient  or  proxy-reported  sensory  dysregulation  outcome  measures  [19,78].

therefore,  a  qualitative  study  was  undertaken  to  understand the  lived  experience  of  sensory  dysregulation  experiences  and the  impact  these  have  on  the  daily  lives  of  young  people  with tic  disorders. this  study aimed to understand the breadth of sensory  dysregulation  experiences  and  the  effect  on  participation  in daily  tasks  by  exploring  the  lived  experience  of  young  people with  tic  disorders  and  their  parents.

## Method

the  study  gained  ethical  approval  through  the  human  Research ethics  committee  (2020/eth00132)  and  clinical  Governance committee  (2020/Ste00307)  at  the  Sydney  children's  hospital network,  Sydney,  australia.

## Patient  and  public  involvement

the study protocol, as well as the interview guide, was developed with  consumer  consultation.  the  principal  investigator  (nS)  met with  two  adults  diagnosed  with tS  and  sensory  dysregulation  to understand  their  lived  sensory  experiences  and  the  impacts  of the sensory experiences on their daily lives. From the knowledge gained  through  consulting  with  consumers,  clinical  experience with working with children with tic disorders and literature review, aiding in  developing the study protocol and interview questions. the  researchers  also  conducted  previous  research  into  the  prevalence  of  sensory  symptoms  in  children  with  tic  disorders  and comorbidities and a systematic review of parent and child report measures  of  sensory-based  measures  [19,79].  the  knowledge gained  from  these  studies  and  in  clinical  practice  supported  the development  of  this  study.

## Research  design

Using  thematic  analysis,  the  researchers  identified,  analysed  and reported  themes  within  the  data  obtained  from  semi-structured interviews  utilising  pre-determined  questions  [80].  Key  features from the extensive data sets were analysed and summarised using thematic analysis,  permitting  the  perspectives  of  each  study  participant  to  be  examined  [80,81].  although  an  advantage  to  thematic  analysis  is  the  flexibility  of  the  approach,  the  researchers

conducted the study in a precise, consistent and exhaustive manner through recording, systematising and transparency of analysis to  ensure  the  study's  trustworthiness  and  the  reported  findings  [81].

the  pre-formulated  interview  questions  explored  participants' responses  to  their  sensory  dysregulation  experiences  and  the impact on their daily lives and function (Supplementary documents 1  and  2).  the  wording  and  sequence  of  questions  were  left open-ended  to  support  broader  discussion  and  were  guided  by participant  responses.  in  addition,  study  participants  were  provided with two prompt pages that used pictures and simple words to  support  discussions  about  lived  experiences  of  sensory  dysregulation and the impact on the person's activities of daily living (Supplementary  documents  3  and  4).  the  semi-structured  interviews  were  anticipated  to  be  30-60 min  in  duration.  a  demographic questionnaire was completed on the day of the interview.

the recruitment of study participants ceased once the research team  agreed  that  data  saturation  had  been  achieved.  the  data saturation  point  was  understood  to  be  once  the  same  recurrent themes  were  identified  through  subsequent  interviews,  and  no new  themes  were  identified  by  additional  participants  [82].

## Sampling and recruitment

Recruitment of study participants occurred through the tic clinic at a tertiary-level children's hospital in Sydney, australia. the study recruited  either  i)  parent(s)  who  had  a  child/young  person  with a  confirmed  tic  disorder  or  ii)  young  people  with  a  tic  disorder and  their  parent(s).  it  was  at  the  family's  discretion  if  the  young person  with  a  tic  disorder  would  engage  in  the  interviews.

the inclusion criteria for young people with tics to be eligible to  engage  in  the  study  include:  (i)  be  between  the  ages  of  ten and sixteen years, (ii) have a confirmed diagnosis of a tic disorder by a paediatric neurologist, (iii) have known or suspected sensory dysregulation  and  (iv)  if  prescribed  pharmacotherapy,  be  on  a stable  medication  regime  for  a  minimum  of  six  weeks  prior  to the  time  of  recruitment.  Study  participants  were  not  excluded  if they  had  confirmed  comorbidities  in  addition  to  a  tic  disorder diagnosis.  Furthermore,  the  young  person  needed  to  (vi)  have conversational verbal skills to engage in the semi-structured interviews.  informed  written  consent  was  obtained  from  the  young person  and  their  legal  guardian.

For  parents  or  carers  to  participate  in  the  study,  they  needed to  be  the  carer  of  (i)  a  child  or  young  person  between  the  ages of  five  and  sixteen  years  with  a  medically  confirmed  diagnosis  of a  tic  disorder.  eligible  participants  were  sent  information  about the  study  and  invited  to  participate via mail.  after  receiving  a signed consent form, a convenient date for the family was set for the  interviews.

of  the  29  families  invited  to  participate,  18  engaged  in  this study. two families were excluded as additional medical information during the interview resulted in the study participants being ineligible. two families were interviewed twice, as a separate parent interview, and then a parent and young person interview was conducted  at  the  families'  request. therefore,  data  was  collected through  interactive  means  as  the  principal  researcher  conducted all  18  semi-structured  interviews  with  the  16  families  engaged  in the study. ten interviews were conducted with the young person with tics in the presence of a parent(s), and eight interviews were conducted  with  parents  of  children/young  people  with  tic  disorders  without  the  child/young  person  present.

the interviews ranged between forty-five minutes to two hours in  duration.  the  mean  duration  of  the  interviews  was  72 min.

the  demographic  details  of  study  participants  are  provided  in tables 1 and  2. all names  are  pseudonyms  to  maintain confidentiality.

## Data collection

due to the covid-19 pandemic at the time of this study, all interviews were conducted via telehealth  using  Zoom  software©  [83]. all  interviews  were  recorded  with  written  consent  from  study participants  and  transcribed  verbatim.  all  interview  transcripts were uploaded and coded using nViVo 12 software [84]. all study participants  were  provided  with  pseudonyms  to  protect  their privacy and identity. When the interview was conducted with the young person and parent present, the interviewer asked the young person the questions first so that they were not biased or guided by  their  parents'  responses.

## Data analysis

the  descriptive  qualitative  data  was  analysed  to  determine  the common themes concerning  the  participants'  experience  of  sensory  dysregulation  and  their  impact  on  their  daily  function.  the researcher  used  an  inductive  analysis  approach  as  this  was  the best  design  for  the  question  asked  [80].  the  themes  were  also identified within the coded data transcripts and were data-driven [80].  the  researchers  analysed  the  themes  for  each  study  participant  after  the  interview  was  conducted  to  understand  the  common themes emerging from the data and to allow for the analysis of  new  emerging  themes. When  no  new  themes  were  identified, it  was agreed that data saturation had been reached for the study.

the  researchers  ensured  the  study's  trustworthiness  by  being credible, transferable, dependable and confirmable [85] by implementing  the  six  phases  of  thematic  analysis,  an  iterative  and reflective process, to analyse the data [80,81,86,87]. these phases were [1]: familiarising yourself with the data [2], generating initial codes  [3],  searching  for  themes  [4],  reviewing  the  themes  [5], defining and naming the themes, and [6] producing the report [81].

Fortnightly  meetings  with  the  principal  investigator  (nS)  and research  supervisor  (Pb)  were  undertaken  regarding  information gained  from  semi-structured  interviews  and  to  discuss  findings in  assisting  with  peer  debriefing.  Frequent  meetings  with  the research  team  were  held  to  examine  and  define  codes,  aiding researcher triangulation. through discussion and agreement from the  research  team,  a  coding  framework,  identifying  codes  and definitions  of  these  codes,  was  developed.  copies  of  transcripts, journals,  memos,  email  correspondence  between  the  research team  members,  meeting  agendas,  and  meeting  minutes  were stored  to  ensure  an  audit  trail  for  the  generation  of  the  codes. hierarchical  coding  was  used  to  allow  the  researchers  to  analyse the  texts  at  varying  levels  of  specificity,  with  higher-order  codes providing  an  overview  and  lower-order  codes  providing  more specific  and  detailed  distinctions  between  study  participants  [81, 86,87].  Research  team  members  vetted  themes  and  subthemes by  testing  for  referential  adequacy  by  referring  back  to  the  raw data  and  the  study  participants'  quotes  [81].  team  consensus  on the  themes  and  the  naming  of  these  themes  was  achieved  following  researcher  triangulation,  peer  debriefing  and  team  meetings. documentation  of  the  team  meetings  regarding  the agreement  of  themes  and  the  naming  of  themes  was  kept  [81].

to  ensure  the  validation  and  trustworthiness  of  the  findings, the principal investigator met with another occupational therapist with experience in qualitative research to review the themes and peer debriefing [81]. Study participants were asked to answer ten

questions as part of the member-checking process to ensure that the  themes  reflected  the  study  participants'  experiences  and echoed  their  voices  (Supplementary  documents  6  and  7).  the questions  ensured  the  findings  relating  to  the  themes  were  relevant, comprehensible and comprehensive and reflected the study participants'  words  and  lived  experiences  [88,89].

three study participants provided feedback relating to member checking. Gaining knowledge that other children with tic disorders reported  similar  sensory  dysregulation  experiences  as  their  child or young person highlighted for these study participants that they were not isolated in their experiences. through member checking, there  was  consensus  on  the  comprehensiveness  and  relevance  of all  the  themes. Regarding comprehensibility, members agreed with the wording used to describe all the themes except for the wording of  the  second  theme  by  one  study  participant. this  study  participant, Karen (interview Pc011), explained that for them, her 13-yearold  daughter,  Keri's,  perception  or  experience  of  the  community environment hindered her participation, not the environment itself. Following  this  insight  and  knowledge,  the  wording  of  the  second theme  was  corrected  to  reflect  this  feedback.

## Results:  themes

one  higher-order  theme  emerged:  ''sensory,  emotions  and  tics; it's  a  ticking  time  bomb''  was  established,  and  three  subthemes were identified. these subthemes were: (i) ''we sacrifice and adapt to  get  daily  activities  done  in  the  home'';  (ii)  ''my  child's  experiences of  the  community  environments  hinder  participation'';  and (iii)  ''sensory  preferences  impact  our  entire  family''  (Figure  1; table  3).

## Main theme: sensory,  emotions  and  tics,  it's  a  ticking  time bomb

the  families  have  described  an  interplay  between  sensory  and emotional dysregulation that exacerbates the child/young persons' tics,  resulting  in  emotional  outbursts  and  reduced  participation or engagement in tasks, reduced quality of life, and impacts affecting the entire family unit. Gretel, mother to 9-year-old Grace with tS,  used  the  term 'ticking  time  bomb' .  this  term  explained  how, at any point, their child or young person's tics could be expressed as  a  result  of  their  experiences  of  sensory  experiences  or  emotional dysregulation. the 'explosion of tics' would result in further emotional dysregulation and thus further exacerbate the tics due to  the  impact  of  stress  on  increased  tic  expression.  in  17  of  the 18  interviews  (94%)  the  impact  of  rage  and  emotional  outburst by the child/young person with tics impacting on family members was  identified.

this  interplay  was  described  by  Gretel,  mother  to  9-year-old Grace  with  tS  (interview  P007):

''So,  she's [daughter  Grace] averse  to  heat.  She  hates  the  heat,  and  her tics  go,  um,  like  a  hundred  times  worse  in  the  summer.  So  does  the  rage. I  think  when  she  can't  move  that  she  gets  more  anxious,  and  then  she'll tic  more… Yeah. I think that's  a  big  thing…  Um.  I  honestly  feel  that  if  the sensory triggers weren't there, I think if they weren't so pronounced the tou, the  Tourette's  wouldn't  be  so  bad.  So,  we  see  a  huge  increase  in  tics  when she has to put clothes on. The whole neighbourhood hears us say F'ing C.''

Keri, 13 and 5-month-old with tics (interview Pc011), explained her  experience:

'' Breathing. [the  sound  of  other  people  breathing] I  think  is  definitely  a trigger.  It  makes  me  very  uncomfortable,  and  then  it  like  goes  and  turns into  a  tic.''

## Sub-theme 1:  we  sacrifice  and  adapt  to  get  daily  activities done in  the  home

Five families engaged in this study explained they lived their lives predictably and had become adept at identifying sensory triggers for their children. Parents and siblings avoid sensory stimuli, environments, activities, or events that may cause the child emotional distress  resulting  from  sensory  dysregulation.  Parents  also  talked about adapting, accommodating and making sacrifices to ensure their  child  felt  safe  and  comfortable  to  reduce  sensory  overload, emotional meltdowns, reduce tics and stress. nine families stated that 'things  have  to  be  just'  in  their  children's  environment  otherwise,  this  would  lead  to  emotional  outbursts.

Felicity,  mother  to  9-year-old  and  2-month-old  son  Flinn  (interview P006): ''We  learn  to  function.  We're  every  day  making  the  different  meals and  cutting  off  tags.  It's  just  as  soon  as  I  buy  his  clothes  now  I  know  to have  tags  already  off.  And  his  dinner  is  always  different  to  ours,  as  it  has been  for  the  last  couple  of  years.  So  that's  just  part  of  our  routine  now. Very  Stressful.''

Within the home environment, the different tasks were broken down into [1]  dressing  [2],  mealtimes  [3],  hygiene  and  grooming and  [4]  sleep  which  were  problematic  due  to  various  sensory stimuli.  it  was  also  identified  that  participation  in  activities  was affected  by  temperature,  such  as  the  ability  to  do  homework. each  of  these  tasks  will  be  explored  in  detail,  and  additional quotes  to  support  the  findings  are  provided  in table  3.

## Dressing  is  a  big  challenge

Many  aspects  of  clothing  are  known  to  be  problematic  from  a sensory perspective, such as the texture or feel of the fabric ( n =  12), the clothing tags ( n =  17),  seams in socks and wearing shoes ( n =  14), wearing  underwear  and  fabric  stitching  ( n =  17).  these  same  challenges  were  reported  by  the  majority  ( n =  15)  of  the  16  families interviewed. in 17 of the 18 interviews, it was identified that parents assisted  their  children  in  wearing  clothing  by  cutting  out  the  tags or  purchasing  clothing  with  the  tag  details  screen  printed  on  the fabric  instead.  during  50%  of  the  interviews,  tight  clothing  was identified  as  problematic,  and  respondents  mentioned  purchasing clothing  items  that  were  much  too  large  for  their  child,  which overcame the issue of the clothing feeling restrictive. thirteen families  explained they had adapted the school uniform. in some cases, the  children  gained  school  permission  to  wear  the  sports  uniform over  the  formal  school  uniform,  as  this  was  more  tolerable.  ten children  preferred  to  be  naked  than  wear  clothes.

Erin  (mother  to  10-year-old  and  11-month-old  Emma  with  TS)  stated: (Interview  P005):  ''Um,  but  we've  just  learned  to  adapt  to  it,  and  we  just buy. I only buy now what I know she'll like, or I'll let her pick it. Yeah, undies are  a  pain.  Always  have  been.  So  we  cut  the  tags  off  the  undies,  and  from Best  and  Less,  we  buy  these  seam-free  ones  where  the  actual  tag  is  like  a stamped onto  it,  as  opposed  to  having  a,  an  actual  tag.''

these  sensory  challenges  to  clothing  are  well  documented  in the  literature  and  rated  on  the  current  sensory  assessment  measures  [90-92].  this  was  further  supported  in  this  study,  as  in  all 18 interviews, it was identified that getting children to wear clothing was a problem. the breadth of the sensory problem of dressing  is  broader  than  just  problems  relating  to  the  feel  of  the clothing or fabric. brian explained the impacts of his 10-and-a-half-year-old son, brett, not being able to wear clothing (interview  Pc002):

''Use  to  make  us  late  all  the  time  because,  you  know,  he  just  wouldn't  find something that was comfortable, and it'd be an ordeal to get dressed. Yeah. Well, I  took him to school in his undies once. It was that bad. [Laugh] Like, he  just  would  not  get  dressed.''

the  interview  is  coded  as  either  PC  or  P .  PC  identifies  that  both  the  parent  and  the  child  were  present  in  the  interview,  and  a  code  of  P  identifies  only  the  parent  was  present.  * two  families  were  interviewed  twice as  the  parents  wanted  to  be  interviewed  in  the  absence  of  their  child  (P001  &amp;  P011)  and  then  again  with  their  child  present  (PC001  &amp;  PC011).  one  family  had  two  children  with  a  tic  disorder,  and  both  children participated  in  the  study  (PC080  &amp;  PC010).  all  study  participants  identified  as  being  australian  in  relation  to  their  ethnicity,  except  the  families  of  PC080  &amp;  PC010,  who  identified  as  european.  all  children/young people  engaging  in  this  study  had  a  primary  diagnosis  of tourette's  syndrome  (ts)  except  Derek,  a  9-year-old  who  was  diagnosed  with  a  chronic  motor  tic  disorder.

Figure  1. a  diagram  depicting  the  themes  identified  in  this  study.  there  is  one  higher-order  theme: ''sensory,  emotions  and  tics,  it's  a  ticking  time  bomb''  and three  subthemes:  (1)  We  sacrifice  and  adapt  to  get  daily  activities  done  in  the  home,  (2)  my  child's  experience  of  community  environments  hinder  participation and  (3)  sensory  preferences  impact  our  entire  family.

to tolerate the continuous feeling of wearing clothing, families have adapted to having their children dress and undress multiple times throughout the day. Sixty-two percent of children can only tolerate  clothing  for  a  limited  time,  such  as  when  in  public  or essential.  nine-year-old  derek  (interview  Pc004)  explains  his  routine  of  putting  on  clothing  when  leaving  the  house,  but  the moment  he  has  the  opportunity,  such  as  in  the  car  or  at  home, he  takes  off  his  clothes  again.

it  was  identified  that  money  was  wasted  on  clothing  items  children would not wear. the solution was only to buy clothing items chosen by the children. it has to be appreciated that taking children with sensory sensitivities to shopping centres to find clothing items of their preference comes with its challenges. Seven families identified that the sensory overload from shopping centres causes meltdown. this  will  be  further  addressed  in  theme  2.

'' When my Nan comes over to pick us up, um, … I wait for the last second to  go  to  the  car  and  then  put  them [clothes] on.  And  then  when  I'm  in the car, I  take  them off and then put them on [to  get  out  of  the  car] and then  at  my  Nan's  house,  I  then  take  them  off  when  I'm  inside.''

For  nine-year-old  Grace,  being  naked  in  public  is  preferred over  the  sensation  of  clothing  on  her  body,  as  described  by  her mother,  Gretel  (interview  P007).  due  to  the  difficulty  tolerating the feeling of clothing on her skin, her preference for being naked makes  it  impossible  for  her  mother  to  have  people  come  to  the home  to  visit.

'' Even if  that  means  being  naked  in  front  of  a  crowd  of  people.  Um,  that's, that's  a  big  thing.  Cause  after  we  leave  the  beach,  I  can't  go  and  get  milk or  anything.  We  have  to  come  straight  home  with  a  naked  Grace  in  the backseat. Um, and what it means is that we're restricted to the home, and she  doesn't  wear  clothes.  So,  people  can't  come  in.''

the  inability  to  tolerate  the  feeling  of  clothing  outweighs  the need  to  wear  appropriate  clothing.  during  the  interviews,  eight children  explained  that  they  would  rather  be  cold  than  wear clothing.  it  was  not  that  they  did  not  feel  the  cold,  but  rather the  intolerance  of  the  fabric  surpassed  the  need  to  be  warm  in cold  weather.  annie,  mother  to  9-year-old  andrew  (interview P001),  explained:

'' He  [Reference  to  son  Andrew]  really  doesn't  like  wearing  clothes.  He  likes to  walk  around  in  his  underwear,  and  he  would  do  that  year-round  if  we didn't insist that he put something more on in the colder weather. Um, and in the colder weather even, he will only wear short sleeves [Pause], including to  school.  He  wears  the  summer  uniform  year-round. [laughing] He  will have a shower or bath and then put [his] underpants back on until he has to  go  out  or  somebody  comes  to  the  door.  There'll  be  a  mad  rush.''

When purchasing clothing, 12 families mentioned that buying clothing  for  their  child  with  sensory  sensitivities  was  a  struggle.

brian,  father  to  10-year-old  brett  (interview  Pc002),  explained: '' So,  this is  the  big  one.  You  can't,  can't  buy  clothes  for  him  and  say,  here  you  go, you  have  to  take  him  to  the  shop,  and  he  has  to  try  it  on.  He's  got  to  feel the  material.  Then  he  will  decide  to  buy  it  or  if  he  wants  it,  and  then  we'll buy it. But if he turns around and says, I don't like the feel of it, even though it  fits  right,  there's  no  point  buying  it  because  he  won't  wear  it.''

although parents make financial and time sacrifices to ensure they can provide clothing their children can tolerate, it is evident that  parents  still  feel  shame  at  how  their  children  are  presented in  public.  the  feeling  of  guilt  is  attributed  to  the  concern  that others  may  think  they  are  not  adequately  providing  for  their children  when  they  are  not  appropriately  clothed  in  public. however,  in  reality,  their  children  are  wearing  the  clothing  they can  tolerate,  even  if  this  means  wearing  old,  worn-out  clothes that no longer fit, clothing not suited to the appropriate weather or  occasion,  or  scantly  clothed  with  possibly  no  shoes,  socks  and so  forth.

Gretel,  mother  to  9-year-old  Grace  with tS  (interview  P007)  stated: '' So on a carer's pension when you buy clothes for your kid, but then when they won't,  you've  got  to  spend  more  money.  And  not  only  that,  while  you're waiting  to  find  more  money  to  spend  and  try  and  find  clothes  that  they will  actually  wear,  that's  a  really  tough  thing.  You  can't  go  anywhere… And  that's  really,  really  hard  because  I  sacrifice  a  lot  to  give  her  really comfortable shoes. It's winter. And I just said, okay, my child is out at respite care  with  no  shoes  and  no  jumper.  And  everyone  probably  thinks  I'm  horrible  and  her  t-shirts  are  disgusting.''

## Mealtimes  are  very  stressful

Mealtimes as a family is a very stressful  activity,  resulting  in  nine families reporting that they eat meals separately to accommodate their child's sensory preferences. Families reported feelings of loss and being ''unconventional and different to other families,'' resulting  in  needing ''a  different  parenting  approach  to  other  families'' . this  is  reflected  in  the  quotes  by  the  following  families:

Particularly if it's around mealtimes. Um… That's the worst uh um [Pause] yeah, whenever they are chewing, or Ken is breathing at the moment, um, with the pandemic and the lockdown, it's been particularly challenging for Keri because she can't get away [laugh] and Ken's working from home, and so she has um been asking for Ken to sleep on the couch… um yeah, it tends to be more loud noises and the swallowing, chewing um and breathing…Oh, uh [Pause] not so much. We've all become so conscious of it that [Laughs] we just try not to swallow; we try to breathe shallowly. [Laughs] It's just ridiculous. |

So, we just chop up like raw carrot, and he'll eat that. Um, and he eats a lot slower, and then I'll make him a corn on the cob, and he'll have that. And then he'll either have, um, like cheese and bikkies or he'll have toast or something like that.

So, he understands what it is, but so he takes his time with Flinn, and he talks to him and tells him it's alright, but just the build-up of getting his hair cut is a struggle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| inga (Mother), P009                                     | Um, sometimes it can be regulation where she will just come home and burst out into tears, and we're not sure what's going on, and that can happen all week…, but a lot of the time, we miss the early signs, or by the time we notice somethings up it's almost to its kind of already too far gone almost. Absolutely, yes, she much harder than a three-year-old emotionally [laughing] but, um, which sounds horrible, but it just is. Well, he was having rages from a really, really young age.                                                                                                                                                |
| heather (Mother), PC010 laura (Mother), PC012           | I think it's, I think you just, um, he just doesn't have the controls in that anger department, or it's a, you know, he doesn't know when to put the brakes on, and he can't put the brakes on and in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Penny (Mother), PC016                                   | Emotions can get quite wild, but um, yeah, I don't know whether that's. I guess I am assuming it's the age bracket, really. Um, but yeah, I guess yes, she can get angry pretty quickly. Yeah, but I don't know. [Laughs].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Phoebe (12 years and six months old with ts), PC016     | Um, if I am trying to keep my anger down, I sometimes do it too, like, push the pain away. The pain from the anger, like I am trying to put my anger away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| natalie (15 years and eleven months old with ts), PC014 | Yeah, until something goes wrong, and then I have a little hissy fit. I used to I used to have really severe rage attacks… I, literally anything. The smallest little argument. Dad and I used to have a really not great relationship. Um, I yeah, it was to the point where I. Him and I actually went and seen my psychologist, Neil, um, to try and fix things because our relationship was not was not what it is today and what it needed to be. You know I was screaming at him most days. You know I have told him that I have hated him. I have told him that I want to never talk to him again, and I hate the fact that I have done that. |
| naomi (Mother), PC014                                   | But yeah, it could have been anything that was a trigger. Anything you know, anything minor from you know someone put their plate in the wrong spot to you know someone looked at her the wrong way, and they were pretty significant meltdowns. For no apparent reason so. Yeah, sometimes it is hormonal, whatever it is, but yeah. Like there is no warning, and we just sort of sit there and go, oh well, here we go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Maree,  mother  to  14  years  and  11-month-old  Megan  (interview  P013), reflected: ''We have now gotten to the point where, and I know it's probably a  really  bad  setting,  but  none  of  us  sort  of  really  eat  together  anymore because  it's  just  too,  too  stressful.

Food texture, taste, and smell are known sensory issues relating to  food  sensitivities  and  often  result  in  families  having  to  cook separate  meals.  in  17  interviews  (94%),  families  identified  their child  tolerated  a  limited  range  of  foods. two  families  engaged  a dietician  to  assist  with  their  concerns  relating  to  their  child's nutritional intake. in addition to these sensory challenges around meal  times  and  food,  a  broader  sensory  issue  relating  to  food and  meal  times  was  identified.  in  61%  of  the  interviews,  families identified  that  the  sounds  relating  to  eating  were  problematic, resulting  in  stressful  mealtimes  and  eating  together  as  a  family impossible.  these  include  i)  the  sound  of  other  people  chewing food or swallowing, ii) slurping a drink, or iii) the sounds of cutlery scraping  on  plates.

Keri (13 and 5-month-old with tics) (interview Pc011) explained: '' Anyone chewing  sounds.  Ah,  sometimes  it  stops  us  from  having  family  meals.''

Sensitivities relating to food caused seven families to be unable to  eat  outside  of  the  home  environment,  such  as  at  restaurants or  parties,  due  to  the  sensory  input  from  the  environment  and the  lack  of  acceptable  food  options  for  the  child.

Felicity,  mother  to  9-year  and  2-month-old  Flinn  (interview  P006), explained:  '' Yes,  so  we've  given  up  on  going  out  to  family  restaurants.  If me  and  my  partner  do  want  to  go  to  a  restaurant,  it's  just  us  two  now because  taking  Flinn  is  just,  but  taking  Flinn  off  to  a  restaurant,  it's  just  a struggle.''

## Hygiene  and  grooming  tasks  are  overwhelming

Six  families  reported  that  the  morning  and  evening  self-care  and grooming activities cause their children distress and are emotionally  overwhelming  due  to  the  sensory  input  experienced.  these activities  included  but  were  not  limited  to  bathing,  washing  hair, brushing  teeth,  and  cutting  their  nails  and  toenails.  due  to  the distress  and  time  these  self-care  tasks  take  to  complete,  families are  frequently  late  for  work  and  other  activities.  Seven  parents explained  that  they  support  their  children  in  completing  daily routine  tasks  by  providing  particular  products  to  try  and  reduce the  sensory  issues  their  children  experience.

Karen,  mother  to  Keri  (13-year  and  five-month-old  with  tS)  (interview P011): ''Actually,  Keri  finds  just  the  whole  package  really  stressful.  And overwhelming,  the  whole  the  getting  ready,  all  the  steps,  um,  needed  um, so  as  a  whole  it  is  quite  stressful  for  Keri  and  feeling  stressed  and  agitated and  oh  I  got  to  get  there  on  time,  that  is  a  big  thing.''

For  some  families,  challenges  around  self-care  activities  relate not  just  to  the  child  partaking  in  the  task  but  also  to  the  child's sensory  experience  of  family  members  participating  in  self-care activities.  irma,  mother  to  7-year  and  4-month-old  inga  with  tS, (interview  P009),  expressed  the  difficulty  she  and  her  husband, ian,  have  with  using  deodorant,  as  inga  struggles  with  the  smell of  them  applying  deodorant.  the  lengths  the  family  goes  to accommodate  inga's  needs  were  outlined.

''So  even  Ian's [father], Ian's  deodorant.  He  can  only  put  it  on  outside. [laughing] Because  when  he  puts  it  on  inside,  that's  all  she [inga] can smell  for  half  the  day,  and  she  complains  about  it  the  whole  day.  So [laughing]… Even  mine  smells.  He's  tried  a  fair  few  different  kinds,  so  it's not  like  he  hasn't  tried  different  kinds,  she  just  doesn't  like  it,  and  I  use  a natural  one.''

through  these  interviews,  it  was  highlighted  that  for  young girls  who have reached puberty, the feeling of menstrual products is  a  problem,  to  the  extent  of  impeding  leaving  the  house  or attending  school.

Karen,  mother  to  13-year  and  five-month-old  daughter  with  tS, (interview  P011): ''But  now she is actually, [she] just  got  her  period  in  the past  couple  of  months,  and  so  that  is  really,  really  challenging,  she [Keri]

can't  stand  the  feeling  of  that.  Yeah,  I  have  tried  so  many  things,  and  we find we have gotten onto a couple of products, but yeah, she's like so happy that it's lockdown [reference to coVid-19 lockdown] because she has got her  period  again.''

## It  all  has  to  be  right  to  sleep

Several  aspects  concerning  the  sensory  environment  have  to  be controlled  by  parents  to  enable  their  children  to  feel  comfortable and assist them in sleeping due to their child's sensory needs and sensory dysregulation. Six families explained this included the feeling  of  the  bedding,  ensuring  the  fabric  does  not  make  a  rubbing sound  (such  as  when  the  material  of  the  sheets  rubs  together), and the type of clothing or lack of clothing the child needs to wear.

Gretel, mother to 9-year-old Grace with tS (interview P007): ''Yes. Um, she didn't  want  me  putting  flannelette  sheets  on  in  winter  because  she  likes  the sheer  cotton  feeling.  Um,  but  because  she  sleeps  naked  and  only  with  one doona  and  I  had  to  buy  that  doona  in  a  hundred  percent  cotton  and  a certain  type.  And  she  makes  me  shake  the,  I  have  to  shake  the  doona  and make sure the quilt is distributed evenly every night, before bed. Mmm. And yeah, the sheets, she doesn't, she doesn't like me changing them very much. If  the sheets change, everything is a problem. Anything that touches her skin is  a  problem.  She  doesn't  have  a  top  sheet  because  of  that,  so  she  just  has a  bottom  sheet,  and  she  has  like,  um,  a  light  blanket  and  then  a  heavier blanket.''

in  seven  interviews,  parents  aided  their  children  in  sleeping by  providing  a  sensory-supportive  environment.  this  includes offering soothing sounds such as the sound of rain, ensuring the room temperature  is  comfortable,  and  the  weight  from  the  bedding  is  the  right  feel.

Karen,  mother  to  13-year  and  five-month-old  daughter  Keri  (interview P001) : ''She  just  gets  too  hot,  all  the  time,  like  she  is  always  hot  and,  um, can't  cope  with  it,  it  just  feels  so  stuffy  and  um,  just  she  doesn't  sleep  with very much on at all because she is just feeling hot all of the time. And um, and has to have a fan blowing on her all summer and often ice packs. Um yeah.  Our  bedroom  is  fairly  close  to  Keri's  bedroom,  and  she,  even  though she  actually  sleeps  to  a  rain  soundtrack  to  block  any  noise,  and  I  am  sure that  she  cannot  hear  Ken [reference  to  Keri's  father] breathing  through that,  but  she  feels  that  she  can,  and  so  then  she  gets  agitates  and  can't sleep,  and  so  poor  Ken  has  been  on  the  couch  for  a  few  months  now.''

## The  heat  affects  my  child's  ability  to  engage  in  tasks

the environmental temperature was not only identified as causing the child sensory dysregulation discomfort but also impacted the ability of the child to participate in tasks, and three families identified heat exacerbated tic expression. one parent reported scheduling  their  child's  tasks  during  the  day  to  accommodate  the weather,  thus  ensuring  that  the  tasks  may  be  completed  in  the cooler  parts  of  the  day.  Gretel,  mother  to  9-year-old  Grace  with tS  (interview  P007),  explained  the  observations  in  Grace's  functioning  when  it  is  a  hot  day:

''Um,  when  it's  hot,  yes.  It  changes  how  our  things  are  done.  Um,  she's [Grace] home-schooled.  So.  We  have  to  try  and  do  her  schoolwork  before she overheats and then just let it go for the afternoon. Um, everybody walks on  eggshells.  It's  basically  how  can  we  manage  not  to  piss  off  Grace  but still  get  her to learn things like basic chores, some schoolwork, [and] attend appointments.  It's,  it's  hard.''

## Theme 2: my child's  experience  of  the  community  environment hinders  their  participation

## Going  shopping  causes  meltdowns

Seven  families  identified  that  crowded  places  that  are  noisy  and loud  and  embody  multi-sensory  experiences  are  challenging  for children with sensory dysregulation. Such locations include shopping  centres,  parties,  and  social  events.  due  to  children's  emotional  distress  at  being  in  these  environments,  parents  explained that  they  frequently  make  accommodations  by  shopping  online or avoiding events altogether. not all shopping can be conducted online,  especially  when  buying  clothing  for  their  child,  as  they need to feel the fabric to ensure that it meets their tactile needs, or else the clothing will not be worn. Gretel, mother to 9-year-old Grace,  relayed  their  experiences  (interview  P007):

'' And  then  the  shopping  and  stuff  too.  That's  off  the  wall, [laughs] , you know.  Um,  yeah,  that's  hard.  We  have  to  go  shopping  sometimes,  I  can't do everything online, but the sensory stuff with that, it's not sensory seeking. It's  more  avoidance.  So,  she  is  constantly  overwhelmed  by  loud  noises  as well.  She's  very  loud  herself.  Um,  and  just  being  in  the  proximity  of  people. But  when  we  went  to  our  tiny  little  shop,  she  couldn't,  she  went  in  once and  came  out,  and  she  just  beat  the  crap  out  of  me.''

## We can't  use  public  toilets

community outings  need  to  be  planned  around  their  child's  toileting  needs,  as  for  eleven  families  in  this  study,  their  children are  unable  to  access  public  toilets.  Public  toilets  pose  a  problem due  to  the  sounds  made  from  the  toilet  flushing,  the  loud  noise from the hand dryers and the smells ( n =  11)  and  the  smell  ( n =  2).

Felicity  (Mother  P006): '' He [Flinn] refuses  to  use  public  toilets…  He  just says  they  smell  bad.''

Penny,  mother  to  12-and-a-half-year-old  Phoebe  (interview  Pc016):  '' I think noise has been a big thing for Phoebe from the beginning. She would block  her  ears  when  you  flush  the  toilet  and  run  away  so  she  can  try,  so she  can  try,  and  block  both  ears  whilst  she  presses  the  button.'' Phoebe (12-and-a  half-year  old  with  tS)  (interview  Pc016): ''Because  it's  always very  loud.  Um,  like,  I  can't  really  be  that  far  away  when  I  flush  the  toilet. Although I do it a lot, it gives me a fright when I do it. Because of the noise level.  Um,  the  yelling.  Um,  I  feel  a  little  bit  freaked  out  about  stuff.  Yeah.  I know,  but  it  keeps  scaring  me.''

## Nope,  no  elevators,  we  work  around  it

escalators and lifts in community settings pose a problem to some children and young people because they fear heights and dislike the  feeling  of  being  on  a  moving  surface,  and  this  experience was reported in 6 interviews. it is appreciated that parents accommodate their children's needs around using escalators and lifts in various  ways,  such  as  [1]  using  the  stairs  [2],  choosing  different shopping  centres  without  lifts  or  escalators  [3],  parking  on  the same  floor  as  the  shop  they  want  to  access  in  a  multistorey shopping  centre  or  [4]  supporting  their  children  with  strategies to  manage  to  travel  on  the  escalator  or  lift.  Maree  (interview P013)  explains  that  she  uses  the  escalator  while  her  daughter Megan (14 years  and  11 months)  uses  the  stairs  to  accommodate her  daughter's  dislike  of  escalators.

''Yes,  definitely  escalators.  She  would  go  to  the  stairs  over  an  escalator  if there  was  a  choice  next  to  each  other.  [Laughs]  Because  she  does  that  at Sydney Central Station, she will go up the stairs. I'm just like,  I'm  going  up the  escalator.''

## We have to  avoid  activities  with  strong  smells

Smells that children find overwhelming or offensive result in children  ceasing  to  partake  in  activities  or  be  in  particular  environments (identified  during  4  interviews).  For  instance,  Keri  (13-year and  five-month-old  with  tS)  (interview  Pc011),  a  young  person engaged  in  this  study,  refuses  to  attend  appointments  with  her

treating  ear,  nose  and  throat  Specialist  due  to  the  smell  of  his breath.  irma  explains  how  accommodating  her  7-year  and four-month-old  daughter  with tS,  inga's  sensitivities  to  smells  in the environment, have alternated and impacted their lives significantly  (interview  P009).

'' If  we outside and there's smoke or something like that, she gets quite upset with that, so smells do impact her, yes. So I will quite often avoid that area because  I  know  how  upset  she  gets,  and  then  we  trapped  in  a  car,  and  it can be quite, um, hard for her, she gets, she, it doesn't work. Well, most of the time, we will move because I know that it just escalates. So, if we don't do something about it, it can just get worse, and she can get more uncomfortable and then, um, her anxiety can grow. I know it has definitely come up  in  our  lives  a  lot.  So,  we  have  to  alter  our  lives,  yes '' .

## I  don't  want  to  go  to  school;  it's  just  all  too  much

there  are  multiple  facets  to  the  school  environment  being  recognised  as  a  very  challenging  place  for  children  ( n = 13)  with sensory dysregulation. Some of these factors were classrooms and the  playground  being  identified  as  too  loud,  the  tactile  element to  certain  activities,  such  as  arts  and  crafts  or  sensory  play,  and this  being  offensive  to  children  sensitive  to  getting  their  hands dirty  and  extra-curricular  activities  such  as  school  discos  being overwhelming. attending school assemblies is a difficult environment  for  many  of  our  study  participants  from  a  sensory  and  tic perspective. these difficulties relate to the loud and echoing environment,  the  expectation  that  children  need  to  remain  seated and  still,  the  close  proximity  to  other  people  in  their  space  and having to suppress tics or being concerned that peers will notice their tics. as a result, parents explained that getting their children to attend school was difficult. in two cases, parents home-schooled their  children  so  they  could  provide  an  environment  to  support their  child's  learning  and  sensory  preferences.

heather,  mother  to  13-year-old  Jesse  (interview  Pc010): ''It  used  to  be hard  to  get  him  to  go  to  school.''

annie, mother to 9-year-old andrew, explained (interview P001): ''School assemblies are difficult  for  him.  Generally,  I  would  say  the  classroom  is  his least  favourite  place,  although  he  really  loves  this  teacher.  But  even  with all  those  support  strategies  in  place,  he  still  finds  the  classroom  difficult.''

## Theme 3: sensory problems impact our child  and  family

even  though  it  is  the  child  or  young  person  who  experiences sensory  dysregulation,  the  interviews  highlighted  the  functional impact  and  toll  that  affects  every  aspect  of  the  entire  family's function, daily activity and quality of life. in 17 interviews, families explained  that  social  events  were  a  ''no  go''  due  to  the  crowds, loud noises and other sensory input. Karen, mother to 13-year-and five-month-old Keri (interview Pc011), provided insights into how their  entire  family's  lives  are  impacted  by  Keri's  challenges  with the  sensory  input  from  her  environment:

'' It's  horrible.  I  look  at  photos  of  how  we  were  two  and  a  half  years  ago, and  I  can't  believe  it's  the  same  family [laugh].  [Sigh]. Like,  uh,  it's  just awful,  we  can't  go  camping,  we  can't  do  that  anymore.  You  know  going in  cars  are  really  difficult,  it's  just  awful,  and  we  can't  have  a  family  meal together  anymore.  …  it  just  got  worse,  and  I  think  now  that  has  become, um and over time, it's just become morphed into Ken's [father] eating and chewing  and  breathing  and  my  swallowing  sometimes.  [Laughs].  And  if  I accidentally  click  my  nails  when  I  am  when  I'm  driving  the  car. [laughs]. And  Ken's  sleeping  on  the  couch.  We  can't  have  a  meal.  So,  it  was  a  bit confusing.  I  don't  quite  understand  what  that  means,  and  it's  like,  oh  my God,  our  family  is  breaking  up.  We've  all  become  so  conscious  of  it  that [laughs] we just try not to swallow. We try to breathe shallowly. [laughs] It's  just  ridiculous.''

## Leisure  activities  are  stressful  rather  than  relaxing

during nine interviews,  families  identified  that  things  have  to  be just  right  in  the  environment  for  everyone  to  be  able  to  relax. Four  families  explained  that  the  television  or  radio  volume  is frequently  a  trigger  for  a  child  with  sensory  sensitivities  to  loud noises.  as  a  result,  the  volume  will  be  turned  down,  the  show may  be  switched  off,  or  an  argument  may  ensue  between  the child  and  other  family  members. What was planned as a relaxing time for the family to spend meaningful time together inevitably becomes  a  stressful  and  disruptive  event.

Karen,  mother  to  13  and  5-month-old  Keri  (interview  Pc011): ''Every Friday night, we'd have a family movie night, and um, we just noticed every time  she [Keri] would  just  get  really  agitated  then  start  yelling  at  her brother,  who  is  two  years  older  than  her.''

Families  also  mentioned  that  they  noticed  their  child's  tics worsen  when  watching  television.  as  previously  highlighted,  a link  between  sensory  stimulus  and  tic  expression  is  apparent.

Penny,  mother  to  twelve  and  a  half-year-old  Phoebe  (interview  Pc016): '' So,  I  don't  know  whether  it  is  the  noise  or  the  flash  of  the  TV,  I  don't  know what  it  is.  But,  ever  since  we  have  noticed  this,  uh,  since  the  age  of  seven, well, when we first started with you guys as well, that was, um, definitely the biggest thing we noticed was in front of the TV, the tics got ten times worse. So,  um  yeah,  whether  it's  the  noise  or  the  lights,  I  am  not  sure.  So.  Yeah.''

erin (mother  to  10-year-old  and  11-month-old  Emma  with  TS) (interview P005 ):  ''It's  so  strange,  the  neck  tic [reference  to  daughter  emma's  tics] is  just  once  every,  so  often  at  night  time  and  when  she's  tired  and  when she's  home  or  watching  TV,  and  she's  quite  relaxed,  that's  when  you'll  get seven  or  eight  in  a  row.''

## Car  trips  are  challenging

travelling  by  car  ( n = 7)  or  public  transport  ( n = 2)  is  challenging due to factors such as the sounds from other passengers breathing, the car radio, the proximity of passengers to the child/young person,  and  the  feel  of  the  seatbelt  or  car  seats  being  offensive. the  inability  to  travel  in  a  car  or  use  public  transport  impacts not  only  functional  activities  such  as  attending  school,  medical appointments  or  community  activities  but  also  being  able  to  go on  holiday.  Families  try  to  work  around  the  sensory  issues  their children  experience  in  these  settings  by  using  headphones,  not having  the  radio  or  music  playing,  avoiding  long  car  trips,  and using  private  vehicles  instead  of  public  transport.  Karen,  mother to  13-year-and  five-month-old  Keri  (interview  P011),  highlighted that  the  family  are  unable  to  go  on  holiday  as  their  daughter  is too  distressed  by  travelling  in  a  car  or  on  public  transport  due to the sounds made by other people around her, including people breathing.

''You  know  going  in  cars  are  really  difficult,  …  um  we  can't  go  on  family holidays uh she has to um, car trips are really difficult um she has to have headphones on… Um the car would be very challenging [due to the sound of  people  breathing].  Um,  but  uh,  she  found  the  travel  on  public  transport overwhelming  and  couldn't  cope  with  the  crowded  carriages.''

brian, father to 10-and-a-half-year-old brett (interview Pc002), explained: ''But  I  think  constant  sound  also  in  the  car.  Like,  if  we  crank  up  the  music, the  other  son  and  me  love  it,  whereas  Brett's,  like,  blocked  ears,  too  loud. Got  to  turn  it  down.''

## We just  stay  at  home;  events  are  a  no-go

in 17 interviews, families reported that their children with sensory dysregulation  felt  most  comfortable  and  preferred  to  stay  home. this  resulted  in  families  not  being  able  to  engage  in  community activities  the  same  way  other  families  would.

Maree,  mother  to  14  years  and  11-month  daughter  Megan  (interview P013)  explained:  '' I  suppose  it  has  just  been  our  norm,  um,  like  because nowadays  she  just,  yeah,  won't  really  go  anywhere.  She  just  wants  to  be at  home.''

Families  experienced  social  isolation  as  not  only  could  they not engage in community events or activities, but hosting friends and  family  at  their  homes  was  not  even  possible.

Karen (interview P011): ''Loud noises, um, are an issue. She [Keri] has  always  been  really  like [that] all  of  her  life  actually,  just  very worried about all fireworks… We can't go out to see friends as much anymore or  have  friends  over.''

When going  to  a  music  concert,  brian (Interview  PC002) mentioned  that  his  son  10-and-a-half-year-old  brett  became  upset  as the  environment  was  too  loud:

''Concerts,  yeah.  He  doesn't  like  loud  music,  let's  say  we  went  to  the  U2 concert  last  year  and  it  was  a  bit  of  a  struggle  with  him.  He  got  upset.  I think it  was  a  bit  too  much,  we.  We  weren't  right  in  the  middle  of  it.  We're sort  of  in  the  stadium  towards  the  back.''

a  discussion  between  harry  (13-year-and-two-month-old  with tS,)  and  his  father,  hamilton,  during  interview  Pc008,  provided insight  into  how  parents  are  aware  of  and  protect  their  children from the triggering sensory stimuli in the community environment:

harry  (13-year-and-two-month-old  with  tS):  '' When  it's  too  loud.  It's  a small  space,  and  the  sound  waves  echo  through…  Well,  I  don't  avoid.'' hamilton (Father): '' Yeah, well, you sort of do. I've got to protect you from them.  You  run  away.  You  put  your  hands  over  your  ears.''

## The  rage  &amp;  outbursts,  we're  walking  on  eggshells

emotional outbursts by children and young people were described in  17  interviews  (94%)  by  parents  when  either  a  sensory  trigger or  a  build-up  of  sensory  input  was  experienced.  derek  (9 years old  with  chronic  motor  tics)  and  his  father,  david  (interview Pc004), explained that as the day progressed, derek became overwhelmed by the various sensory experiences involved in his daily routine,  causing  emotional  dysregulation  and  resulting  in  family arguments.

david : ''When  you  have  a  bad  day,  is  it  like  all  different  things  that  are, like  one  thing  might  annoy  you  and  then  another  one  annoys  you  more, and it sort of builds up, and then everything explodes over the top. derek : ''Yeah.  Cause,  like,  the  other  day,  um,  my  clothes,  I  didn't  like  my  clothes, and  then,  I  had  an  argument  with  my  dad,  mom,  brother,  and  nan.''

collectively,  families  voiced  the  emotional  outbursts  experienced  by  their  children  78  times  during  these  interviews,  which impacts  participation  in  activities,  quality  of  life,  family  togetherness,  and  relationships.  Gretel,  mother  to  9-year-old  Grace  with tS (interview P007), details the impact Grace's emotional outbursts have  on  their  family  and  the  lengths  she  goes  to  support  Grace to  stay  calm:

''it's  hard  because  I  restructure  everything.  Everything  to  make  things  less stressful  for  her  because  if  she's  not  stressed,  I'm  not  stressed.  But  when Grace  is  stressed,  the  iPad  gets  thrown  at  me.  Holes  get  put  in  walls.  The baby  gets  hurt.  I  get  hurt.  Then  she  thinks  she's  the  worst  person  in  the world  and  hates  herself.  And  it's  just  a  cycle,  and  it's  horrible.  So,  yeah,  I do  very  much  change  everything.''

besides the sensory triggers, parents described their sensory-sensitive  children  to  anger  very  quickly,  and  emotional dysregulation  was  very  common.  Multiple  parents  reported  that their  children  became  physically  violent  when  angered.  brett,  a 10-and-a-half-year-old  with  tS  (interview  Pc002),  described  his challenges  with  emotional  dysregulation:

brett: ''Yes.  Yes,  I  get  angry easily, yeah. Yeah. Yes. Controlling my emotions is  very  hard.  And  it  does  get  a  bit  tricky  doing  that.

Families  reported  that  even  though  their  child's  sensory  preferences  caused  sensory  dysregulation,  impacting  the  quality  of life  and  function,  it  was  actually  the  behaviours  resulting  from emotional  dysregulation  rather  than  sensory  dysregulation  that was  most  challenging.

Gretel, mother to 9-year-old Grace with TS, (Interview P007): ''Um, everybody walks on eggshells. It's basically how can we manage not to piss off Grace but  still  get  her  to  learn  things  like  basic  chores,  some  schoolwork, [and] attend appointments? It's, it's hard. It's like she has this internal engine that is  just  going,  going,  going,  going,  and  it  only  has  one  gear,  well,  maybe one  or  two  gears,  but  not  enough  to  slow  down  by  yourself  sort  of  thing. Once  she,  once  she  revs  up,  she  can't  get  back  down,  and  that's  actually, that's,  that's  a  major  thing.  So,  when  you  try  and  take  that  away  (IPad), people  get  injured.  The  anger  and  the  rage  is  so  big  and  horrible  that  I don't  get  to  see  the  other  sides  of  her  as  much  as  I'd  like  to.  That's  really hard.''

laura,  mother  to  11-year-old  and  two  months  son,  liam (interview  Pc012),  explains  the  impact  liam's  anger  has  on  the family  unit  and  on  his  brother  too:

''He just gets really angry. I mean really angry. Like people wouldn't believe me how angry he can get, he gets really angry… its starts a lot of the time it  starts with frustration. And it could last maybe, you know, half an hour… That  we  can  get  into  these  spirals  where  we,  you  know,  we've  just  go  and lie  down  or  do  something  until  we  can  bring  ourselves  back  to  where  you can  actually  function.  So  that,  that's  probably  has  a  massive  impact  on our,  on  our  lives.  Well,  the  family  unit.  I  mean,  he's  got  a  younger  brother who tends to, you know, bear the brunt of it. It's just not a nice environment. Like  when we are all yelling at one another, and um, you know where you worry that you know his head is going to come off because he's so angry.''

## Discussion

the  interplay  between  sensory  dysregulation,  emotional  dysregulation and tic expression ought to be considered. in a case series of twelve children with tic disorders, the researchers hypothesised that  sensory  sensitivity  to  sound  (misophonia)  caused  abrupt emotional  dysregulation  in  individuals  with  tic  disorders  and should be considered part of a comprehensive clinical assessment [49].  Furthermore,  children  with  tic  disorders  and  comorbidities have  been  identified  to  experience  sensory  and  emotional  dysregulation  [15,  19]. tic  expression  is  significantly  related  to  stress and emotional dysregulation by various emotional states [93-95]. it  is  suggested  that  treatment  focusing  on  the  mediating  role  of emotion  dysregulation  may  contribute  to  developing  improved therapies for children with tic disorders [94]. as there was a common interplay between sensory and emotional dysregulation and tic  expression  expressed  by  our  study  participants  in  these  interviews,  consideration  of  all  these  factors  through  the  assessment and  treatment  process  to  ensure  a  holistic  and  comprehensive understanding  of  the  patient's  needs  and  condition.

Families explained the complexity of managing the child/young person's sensory needs, in addition to dealing with tics, emotional dysregulation,  and  neurodevelopmental  and  neuropsychiatric comorbidities.  the  impact  of  sensory  dysregulation  on  function, participation  and  quality  of  life  resulting  from  the  child  experiencing  sensory  dysregulation  affects  the  entire  family,  not  just the  child  or  young  person.  in  many  cases,  the  child's  sensory needs  are  accommodated  by  the  parents,  who  provide  an  environment  that  facilitates  the  child's  or  young  person's  sensory needs and preferences, ensuring harmony in the home. We completed  18  interviews,  and  overwhelmingly,  all  families  reported

the  impact  of  sensory  dysregulation  on  all  aspects  of  their  child and young person's life and the quality of lives of the entire family.

the  impact  on  the  family  ranged  from  being  unable  to  eat meals  together  to  being  unable  to  listen  to  the  radio  in  the  car or  watch  television  without  upsetting  their  child  with  auditory sensitivities. the noises made by family members, such as chewing and  swallowing  sounds,  scraping  of  cutlery  on  plates,  breathing noises and clicking of fingernails, cause disharmony in the family and  impact  the  family  togetherness.  in  addition,  the  effects  of temperature on the child's ability to engage in tasks, the difficulty with  tolerating  the  feeling  of  seatbelts  and  car  seats,  and  the inability  to  travel  in  a  car.  hence  family  holidays  are  impossible or  very  difficult,  due  to  the  difficulty  travelling  together.

it  was  also  explained  that  when  watching  television,  children and  young  people's  tics  increased  and  therefore,  as  stated  in theme  three, ''leisure  activities  are  stressful  rather  than  relaxing'' . the increase in tics when watching television could be accounted for various reasons: the child's fatigue level at the end of the day, the sensory overload from the television, the emotional response to  the  content  they  are  watching  and  the  impact  this  may  have on the child's tic expression, the child is cognitively not engaged in an activity and hence tics seem worse when children are bored, the child may feel comfortable around their parents and not wish to  suppress  their  tics  as  a  few  explanations.

the  findings  highlight  that  parents  have  learnt  to  understand their  child's  sensory  needs. they  adapt  the  environment  and  the tasks  so  their  children  can  successfully  complete  tasks.  not  all environments  can  be  adapted,  so  some  families  have  made  sacrifices  impacting  their  quality  of  life  to  meet  their  children's  or young  persons'  needs.

a  qualitative  study  by  deGace  (2004)  found  that  families  with children  with  severe  aSd  may  experience  difficulty  engaging  in daily activities that hold positive meaning for them due to sensory needs  and  rigid  routines  [96].  intervention  for  sensory  dysregulation focuses on supporting the child rather than facilitating the occupations and needs of the entire family unit [96]. as the family unit  provides  a  valuable  source  of  learning  and  development  for a  child  with  neurodevelopmental  disorders,  it  is  prudent  that,  as clinicians,  we  support  the  family  in  expanding  and  enhancing these  opportunities  for  their  children  [96].

Parents  voiced  that  addressing  their  child's  emotional  dysregulation  in  therapy  was  paramount,  over  and  above  the  challenges of  sensory  dysregulation.  this  need  to  address  emotional  dysregulation over and above the sensory dysregulation experiences may be  because  families  have  learnt  to  be  insightful  regarding  their children's  sensory  preferences  and  how  to  accommodate  them. Study  participants  also  mentioned  an  interplay  between  sensory dysregulation, emotional dysregulation and tic expression. Research on  the  prevalence  of  sensory  dysregulation  and  tics  [15,  19]  is emerging, and the effects of emotional dysregulation and tics, such as factors such as stress, anxiety, excitement and fatigue, exacerbate tics  is  well  documented  [97].  Yet  the  interplay  between  sensory and  emotional  dysregulation  and  tics  is  to  be  further  understood.

in  addition,  the  researchers  acknowledge that 80-90% of children with tics experience other neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric  disorders  [1,  3,  6].  all  the  study  participants  experienced at  least  one  other  comorbidity  in  addition  to  a  confirmed  tic disorder  (level  1aSd: n = 4,  ocd: n = 5,  adhd: n = 7  and  anxiety: n = 12).  even  though  all  study  participants  ( n = 16)  experienced sensory  dysregulation,  these  experiences  could  be  at  least  partly influenced  by  another  comorbidity  such  as  aSd  (need  for  sameness,  restricted  eating),  ocd  (need  for  things  to  be  same,  just right), and  anxiety  (how  sensory  issues  trigger  emotional dysregulation) [4]. but this is a 'reality' of children with

neurodevelopmental disorders, who rarely have a single  disorder but  often  have  multiple  comorbidities.  all  the  study  participants were diagnosed with a tic disorder ( n =  16),  and  all  reported  experiencing  sensory  dysregulation,  which  impacted  function  regardless of the presence of various neurodevelopmental comorbidities. thus, sensory dysregulation in children with tic disorders was not restricted to children with any specific comorbidity, i.e., aSd or ocd.

therefore, as clinicians and researchers, it is valuable to understand  and  measure  the  breadth  of  sensory  dysregulation  experiences  children with tic disorders experience  to  ensure  a comprehensive  assessment  of  the  issues.  this  is  to  aid  in  determining the severity of the impact on function, assist with formulating  treatment  planning  and  measure  treatment  outcomes. the impact  of  sensory  dysregulation  experiences  on  the  family  unit as  part  of  the  assessment  should  be  considered  to  ensure  that therapy  focuses  not  only  on  improving  the  function  of  the  child, but  the  entire  family  unit.  Quantifying  the  strategies  used  by families  needs  to  be  captured  as  these  provide  valuable  data  on how  best  to  support  children  and  provide  an  understanding  of the  implications  these  accommodations  have  on  the  quality  of life  for  the  entire  family  unit  [96].

## Limitations  of  the  study

although  inductive  analysis  was  the  predominant  approach  to data  analysis,  it  is  understood  that  researchers  could  not  free themselves of their theoretical and epistemological commitments [80].  the  researchers  had  prior  theoretical  knowledge  and  experience in paediatric tic disorders, having conducted previous quantitative  research  studies  [19,78,79]  and  worked  clinically  in  this field.  Steps  were  taken  to  overcome  this  bias,  which  included researcher  triangulation,  peer  debriefing,  themes  and  subthemes being vetted by team members, and member checking to ensure that  the  research  themes  were  trustworthy  and  credible.  in  addition,  should  the  Yale  Global  tic  Severity  Scale  have  been  used, the  severity  of  the  study  participants'  tics  would  have  been reported.  With  this  said,  tic  is  present  in  a  wax  and  waning  pattern;  therefore,  it  may  not  be  a  true  reference  for  the  level  of impairment.  to  understand  the  severity  of  symptoms,  a  list  of prescribed  medication  for  each  study  participant  has  been  provided  in  table  2.

We also acknowledge that having both the young person and parent  present  in  the  interview  may  have  created  a  bias  in  the data  obtained.  Still,  we  had  to  ensure  that  the  young  person  felt comfortable  with  the  process  of  being  interviewed.  thus,  they were  offered  the  opportunity  to  be  interviewed  in  the  presence of  their  parents,  and  all  young  people  interviewed  chose  this format to their interview. two parents requested to be interviewed in addition to the young person and parent interview so additional information could be provided that they did not feel comfortable discussing  in  front  of  their  young  person.

## Future  research

as the current proxy-report sensory-base measures focus only on rating the sensory dysregulation of the child [78], there is a need for  the  development  of  a  new  measure  that  comprehensively assesses  the  breadth  of  sensory  dysregulation  experienced  by children with tic disorders and comorbidities as identified through these  lived  experiences  [89,  98-100].  in  addition,  the  measure needs  to  allow  for  the  impact  of  sensory  dysregulation  on  the family  unit  and  an  understanding  of  the  interplay  of  sensory, emotional  dysregulation  and  tic  symptoms.  this  would  not  only

n. SoleR et al.

aid in approved assessment and treatment planning but also allow for rating the effectiveness of treatment through the clinical utility of  comprehensive,  comprehendible  and  relevant  sensory-based assessment measure for children with tic disorders and comorbidity.

in  addition,  future  research  needs  to  focus  on  whether  the sensory experiences of children with tic disorder differ from those experienced by children or young people with other neurodevelopmental  conditions.  due  to  the  premonitory  urge  experienced before the tic, this does question whether interoception and sensory  experiences  are  involved  in  tic  expression  and  if  the  tic expression impacts the child or young person's sensory experiences.

## Conclusion

children  with  tics  and  their  families  experience  impacts  on  their participation in daily tasks due to sensory dysregulation that often remains  unmeasured  and  a  resultant  lack  of  treatment  options due, in part, to the hidden nature and lack of awareness of these issues. Families have reported incredible resourcefulness in adapting  to  the  challenges.  Still,  a  holistic  response  is  needed  to  manage  the  impact  on  function  resulting  from  these  sensory dysregulation  experiences.  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  the effects  of  sensory  dysregulation  in  children  with  tic  disorders needs  to  consider  a  broader  list  of  experiences  than  is  currently being assessed in current practice. the assessment needs to provide  insight  and  measurement  of  the  accommodation  and  adaptions  made  by  the  family  and  the  impact  of  sensory  dysfunction on  the  entire  family  unit.  a  comprehensive,  comprehensible,  relevant sensory-based measure is required to effectively assess and treat  children  and  young  people  with  tic  disorders.
