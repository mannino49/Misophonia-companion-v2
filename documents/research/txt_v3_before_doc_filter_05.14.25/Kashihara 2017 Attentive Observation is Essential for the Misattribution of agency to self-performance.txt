Recent studies have repeatedly demonstrated a false memory phenomenon in which
people falsely remember having performed an action by oneself when in fact they have
only observed the action by another person. We investigated the attentional effect to
the action itself on the observation inﬂation. Fifty-four participants ﬁrst performed and
read actions (Phase 1); then, they observed the action video that showed another’s
actions (Phase 2), some of which they had not performed in Phase 1. In the Phase 2,
they were required to focus on either the actor’s performance (i.e., attentive observation
condition) or irrelevant objects, which were presented in the background (i.e., inattentive
observation condition) to modulate their attention. Around 2 weeks later, participants
took a surprise source-memory test (Phase 3). In this phase, we asked them to judge
whether they “performed,” “read,” or “not presented” the action in Phase 1. Three
participants were removed from analysis, because they could not attend Phase 3 within
10–16 days after completion of the second phase. We found observation inﬂation only in
the attentive condition, which contradicted the notions from other false memory studies
that showed that attention to the target stimuli reduced false memory in general. We
discussed the observation inﬂation mechanism from the perspective of the “like me”
system, including the mirror neuron system, self-ownership, and self-agency.

INTRODUCTION
Recent studies have demonstrated a false memory phenomenon which is thought to be due to self-
other confusion in the action memory of healthy individuals (e.g., Lindner et al., 2010, 2016; Schain
et al., 2012). This phenomenon has been called the OI, in which people falsely remember having
performed an action by oneself when in fact they have only observed the action by another person
(Lindner et al., 2010). OI represents that people possibly misattribute the sense of agency of the
observed action to the self by just observing other people’s actions. Originally, self-other confusion
as an agent of a certain action has been a symptom observed in psychiatric patients, for example,
auditory hallucinations in most schizophrenic patients (Nayani and David, 1996). This is caused
by a patient’s actual utterances, as stated by previous researchers (e.g., McGuigan, 1966; Green and
Preston, 1981). Thus, “self-other confusion” as one of a symptom means the confusion of agency
judgment “who is the agent of a certain action.” Healthy adults do not likely to confuse own action
with others at the moment, however, such confusion can occur in memory.

Kashihara et al. Attentional Effect on Agency Misattribution
Since the ﬁrst study addressing this phenomenon, which
developed and used methodology to approach it (i.e., Lindner
et al., 2010), OI has been demonstrated per the following
experimental paradigm: ﬁrst, participants perform or read simple
action statements (Phase 1; e.g., “shake the bottle!”). Then, they
are asked to observe video clips that show another person’s
actions (Phase 2). Two weeks later, they take a surprise source-
memory test where they are asked to judge whether they
“performed, ” “read, ” or “not presented” the action in Phase 1
(Phase 3). OI is thought to arise when they believe they performed
some of the actions in Phase 1 that in fact they only observed in
Phase 2.
Previous researchers studying OI have demonstrated that
both facilitating and disturbing factors aﬀect this misattribution
during observation of another’s actions. When we observe
another’s action, we can obtain information to induce a feeling
“as if I do it, ” whereas we can ﬁnd any clue to be conscious of the
fact that the agent of the action is other. These ideas have already
been advocated in the “like me” hypothesis, which is a system to
determine whether a certain agent is close to oneself (Meltzoﬀ,
2007).
Regarding OI’s facilitating factor, it has been suggested that
motor simulation using the MNS, which is activated both
during performing an action and observing another’s action
(Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004), is one of the critical processes
that induce false memories of self-performance (e.g., Lindner
et al., 2016). Much evidence has shown the overlap of neural
activation during the performance of an action and during
the observation of another’s action (e.g., Grèzes and Decety,
2001); therefore, it has been considered that motor representation
is created during one’s own action performance and likewise
during observation of another’s actions. Previous studies on OI
suggested that motor representation created by motor simulation
induces the false attribution of self-performance (Lindner et al.,
2016).
Regarding OI’s disturbing factor, previous research showed
that the information in the action video indicating “the actor is
not me” decreases the occurrence rate of this misattribution. For
example, Lindner et al. (2012) manipulated group membership
by actor’s complexion (dark vs. fair), and found that when
fair-skinned participants observed actions performed by a dark-
skinned actor (i.e., out-group actor for participants), the rate
of OI was signiﬁcantly decreased. In addition, Schain et al.
(2012) suggested that when the action video showed an actor’s
face (vs. concealing the actor’s face), the rate of OI was
signiﬁcantly reduced. Previous research on a sense of ownership
has suggested that body ownership illusion on virtual objects
decreased when the object was a black cuboid (“it is not
like my own body”) compared with when the object was a
dummy body (“it is like my own body, ” Lenggenhager et al.,
2007).
Given that OI could be induced during observation of
“another’s action, ” the observed body is not, in principle,
the observer’s body; however, it contains many characteristics
indicating the fact that “it is not the observer’s body.” While
attentive observation of only the target action itself may be
likely to increase OI because of facilitation of MNS, carefulobservation of actor in OI paradigm (Lindner et al., 2010)
will provide participants with not only motor information
but also information about actor’s visual features. If so, it is
possible that the careful and attentive observation of the other’s
action decreases the occurrence of OI because participants
can feel less ownership of the people in action video. Schain
et al. (2012) examined the eﬀect of the actor’s face on OI
manipulating attentional focus to the action video. They used
three experimental conditions. In the ﬁrst (the face-invisible
condition), the actor’s face could not be observed by participants.
In the second (the face-visible/action-focus condition), the
actor’s face could be observed by the participants and they
were asked to focus on the actor’s action. In the third (the
face-visible/face-focus condition), the actor’s face could be
observed by the participants and they were asked to focus
on the actor’s face. Consequently, in the face-visible/face-focus
condition, the occurrence of OI was eliminated. In addition,
even if participants focused on the action, the appearance of
another’s face in the action video (i.e., in face-visible/action-
focus condition) decreased OI occurrence rate compared to
the face-invisible condition. Per these results, they concluded
that attention on the other’s face is a crucial factor to
disturb OI.
However, Schain et al.’s (2012) experimental design had a
possibility to confound two types of attentional eﬀects: the
ﬁrst was attention on the actor’s face as to disturb illusory
ownership on an actor in the action video (face-visible/face-
focus >face-visible/action-focus >face-invisible condition);
the second, was attention on the action itself as a factor to
facilitate false agency attribution on the other’s action (face-
invisibleface-visible/action-focus >face-visible/face-focus
condition). That is, it still is not clear how attention to the
action itself aﬀects the occurrence of OI. Schain et al.’s (2012)
ﬁndings may be due to the use of a unique stimulus of the
face as a distractor. In accordance with Leonetti et al. (2015),
MNS activation is enhanced by peripheral vision. In other words,
OI should occur in a situation where the observer’s attention is
not directed to an action itself (i.e., the inattentive observation
condition).
In this study, we modulated observer’s attention and
investigated the impact of the attention on OI to elucidate the
top-down inﬂuence on the agency misattribution without any
modiﬁcation of the video contents. We focused on the eﬀect of
attention on the action itself using visual distractor unrelated
to the actor in the action video, instead of the actor’s face. We
instructed participants to focus on the objects appearing in the
background of the action video to investigate the attentional
eﬀects of other’s actions on OI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Fifty-four healthy undergraduates (29 females, age range D
18–22 years, mean age D20.3 years, SDD1.2) participated in our
experiment. This study was conducted per the recommendations

written informed consent from all participants. This study was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Design
We used a one-way design (observation condition: attentive
observation vs. inattentive observation) manipulated within-
participants. Both observation conditions used a randomized
block design. In the attentive observation condition, participants
were instructed to focus on the action of an actor in the video
while ignoring objects appearing in the background that were
unrelated to the task and actor. In the inattentive observation
condition, participants were instructed to focus on some objects
in the background of the action video.
Materials
We generated 60 action statements and action videos consistent
with Lindner et al. (2010). The action statements described
actions to manipulate objects (e.g., “shake the bottle” in Japanese).
Each action video was the 15-s composite video that randomly
combined 60 movies showing the actor’s action performance
with 30 landscape photographs by using Adobe After Eﬀects
CC 2014.1.1 (13.1.1, Adobe Systems Software Ireland Ltd.: see
Figure 1B ). To distract participants’ attention from the actor’s
action, 6–10 unrelated objects per video randomly appeared in
the background of the video (e.g., some books appeared in the
picture of the library as part of the background).
The action video was made in accordance with Lindner
et al. (2010): that is, the video ﬁlmed a female actor’s torso,
arms, and hands from a third-person perspective. In each video,
she performed the actions described in the action statements.
Importantly, to conceal the actor’s facial characteristics, we
omitted the actor’s face from the action video. To strengthen
homogeneity of the materials, only one female actor performed
all actions in the video.
Procedure
The experiment was controlled by a computer and consisted
of three phases following Lindner et al.’s (2010) experimental
paradigm ( Figure 1 ). In Phase 1, in accordance with the
previous research, we set the condition for asking participants
to read aloud action statements (read condition) in addition
to the condition for actually performing an action themselves
(perform condition) to secure the task-diﬃculty. In Phase 2, two
observation condition (attentive vs. inattentive) were prepared
to investigate the attentional eﬀect. In Phase 3, which was
conducted 2 weeks later by Phase 2, we measured their memory
for self-performance in Phase 1. The action statements were
counterbalanced across participants.
Figure 1A shows the ﬂow of Phase 1. In the ﬁrst phase,
participants performed 15 actions, and read 15 action statements
aloud. The item lists shown in each encoding condition were
randomly chosen from all 60 action statements, and they were
presented at the center of a 2400BenQ LCD Monitor display
in a random order. We presented the following stimuli using
Microsoft PowerPoint 2010, which was manually operated by the
experimenter. At the beginning of each trial, the experimenter
handed an object (e.g., a plastic bottle ﬁlled with water) directlyto participants after its name and picture appeared on the screen.
Then, Japanese instruction to the next action statement appeared
on the screen. The instruction meant either “please perform” or
“please read.” After that, the experimenter told them to obey the
instruction (i.e., perform or read the action statement) for 15 s
[during this time, the monitor showed both the instruction and
the action statement (e.g., “shake the bottle” in Japanese)].
Between the ﬁrst and second phase, a 5-min arithmetic task
was administered as a distractor. Figure 1B indicates the ﬂow
of Phase 2. In the second phase, participants observed the 15
action videos per condition that showed other’s actions. Some
videos presented in this phase were not performed earlier (i.e.,
5 action statements were performed, 5 were read, and 5 were not
performed in Phase 1). In this phase, participants were required
to pay attention to an actor’s performance (attentive observation
condition) or the irrelevant objects, which were presented in the
background (inattentive observation condition) while watching
the action video. Each observation condition had a diﬀerent task
after watching the video: participants rated the familiarity with
the action in everyday life on a ﬁve-point Likert scale (attentive
observation condition), or participants reported the number of
objects that appeared in the background in the video.
Figure 1C demonstrates the ﬂow of Phase 3. The third phase
was conducted 10–16 days after the ﬁrst and second phases.
Participants were invited to the laboratory to participate in
another experiment and took a surprise source-memory test for
all 60 action statements. At the source-memory test, they were
asked to judge whether they performed or did not perform
(read or not presented) each action described in the statement
presented in Phase 1.
According to Lindner et al. (2010), the occurrence rate of OI
was calculated as follows: (a) all action statements were assigned
into two categories [actually performed/not performed (i.e., read
or not presented) in Phase 1], (b) the performed-response (i.e.,
participants labeled as “I have done the action in Phase 1”
in Phase 3; Table 1 ) to the action statements that were not
performed in Phase 1 was considered as a false-response, and
(c) the subtraction of the proportion of the false-response not
observed in Phase 2 from the proportion of the false-response
observed in Phase 2 was deﬁned as the OI eﬀect.
We analyzed participants’ OI rate in each observation
condition. To investigate the diﬀerences in OI between both
observation conditions, we conducted paired t-tests. In addition,
we conducted a one-sample t-test to conﬁrm the occurrence of OI
in each observation condition. The alpha level was set at aD0.05.
All analyzes were conducted by R studio (R Core Team, 2016).
Furthermore, we adopted Cohen’s das an eﬀect size of t-tests
calculated by the R package “compute.es” (Del Re, 2013).
RESULTS
All participants who joined the ﬁrst and second phase of the
experiment took part in the third phase. Three participants could
not attend the third phase within 10–16 days after from the
completion of the second phase. Therefore, we conducted the
analysis for the data from 51 participants.

The OI eﬀect in each observation condition demonstrated in
Figure 2 .
The Shapiro–Wilk test revealed that the data did not satisfy
the assumption of a normal population (for the size of the OI
eﬀect in the attentive condition, wD0.90, p<0.001; in the
inattentive condition, wD0.75, p<0.001); therefore, we applied
the logarithmic transformation.
We found that OI was signiﬁcantly larger in the attentive
condition than it was in the inattentive condition [ t(50)D5.35,
p<0.001, dD1.06]. In addition, we conducted one-sample
t-tests to ascertain whether OI signiﬁcantly occurred in each
condition. Thereby OI was found in the attentive condition
[t(50)D5.70, p<0.001, dD1.13], but not in the inattentive
condition [ t(50)D1.93, pD0.06, dD0.38].
Since the data did not satisfy the assumption of a normal
population, we also conducted a non-parametric test (i.e.,
Wilcoxon signed-rank test) on the OI occurrence rate just
to be certain. We also found a trend similar to the results
of parametric tests in non-parametric tests: There was still
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the occurrence of OI for the diﬀerence
between the two observation conditions ( VD383, p<0.001), for
a one-sample test in the attentive condition ( VD672, p<0.001).
Note that there was also a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in a one-sample
Wilcoxon signed-rank test in the inattentive condition ( VD145,

interval [95% CID( 0.01, 0.10)].
DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to conﬁrm the pure eﬀect of attention
to other’s action on OI, expanding the ﬁndings in Schain et al.
(2012).
Observation inﬂation eﬀect occurred at a signiﬁcantly higher
rate after attentive observation of another’s action video
compared with after inattentive observation. Considering the
studies on MNS, which demonstrated the enhancement of
MNS activations when participants observed target action
attentively (Muthukumaraswamy and Singh, 2008), attention

to action could facilitate “like me” judgment even if it was a
misattribution; therefore, greater OI might arise. However, it
cannot be said that the MNS activity declined in the inattentive
observation condition per the evidence on motor resonance
indicating that peripheral vision facilitates the activation of
motor resonance, which are supported by MNS activity (Leonetti
et al., 2015). Given the circumstances, conversely, another
possibility is considered: higher-order cognitive control. Brass
and Haggard (2008) and Brass et al. (2009) have suggested
that the higher brain mechanism that judges agency (e.g.,
TPJ) also monitors or controls the agency judgment supported
by lower-order system for motor simulation (e.g., MNS).
Considering this, the agency judgment confusion occurred at a
diﬀerent cognitive-hierarchical level, which would involve TPJ
regardless of MNS activation in the inattentive observation
condition.
Further ﬁndings from a one-sample t-test showed that
signiﬁcant OI was found only in the attentive observation
condition. This ﬁnding indicates that directing the attention
to the action performed by others is a requisite condition
for OI occurrence. Typical memory studies have demonstrated
that attention to the target content could help us to keep
the content in mind (e.g., Craik et al., 1996; Berryhill et al.,
2011). Although it seems inconsistent with the typical theory
of memory function, our results have higher aﬃnity with the
ﬁndings about sense of ownership or agency (e.g., Haggard
and Cole, 2007; Lenggenhager et al., 2007; Moore and Fletcher,
2012; Kokkinara et al., 2016). In previous research on ownership
or agency, it has been suggested that directing attention to
a target was related to the occurrence of a sense of agency
or ownership. For example, Haggard and Cole (2007) used
the method called “intentional binding eﬀect, ” which was one
of the objective ways to investigate participants’ sense of
agency, and showed that the binding eﬀect was increased when
participants could focus their attention to stimuli. Furthermore,
in previous studies on memory of involuntary actions, it was
suggested that a voluntary action that attends to a sense of
agency aﬀects the memory of involuntary actions, which never
have sense of agency (e.g., Jensen et al., 2014; Khalighinejad
and Haggard, 2016). Altogether, this false attribution of self-
performance may not just be typical false memory, but also
something concerning the sense of ownership as a distracting
factor or agency when observing another’s action as a facilitating
factor.
From this perspective, as discussed in the introduction section,
OI could be decreased by a disrupted sense of ownership, which
was induced by an actor’s face (Schain et al., 2012) or skin color as
a clear indicator of “not like me.” Whereas, our results suggested
that the decreased OI from focusing on the actor’s face in Schain
et al. (2012) can be explained by just distracting participant’s
attention from the action itself. It is indicated that the eﬀect of
attention to OI will be determined by the amount of the attention
to the action itself rather than by the amount of attention is paid
to the visual appearance that allows us to discriminate self from
other.
As discussed above, we have suggested new insights
concerning the OI mechanism. First, it was not a typicalfalse memory because the occurrence rate was high when
participants paid attention to the target. Second, it could be
worthy to reconsider the OI mechanism from the perspective
of the “like me” system, including MNS, self-ownership, and
self-agency. Per this perspective, we propose the process of the
occurrence of OI in the OI paradigm (Lindner et al., 2010) as
follows: (1) First, participants get a sense of agency to their
own action when they performed some actions in Phase 1.
(2) Then, they can have a vicarious-agency (Wegner et al.,
2004) to observed other’s actions by the motor simulation
based on MNS when they directed their attention to target
action during observing the other’s action in Phase 2. (3)
The judgment of “who is the agent, ” that is, “the agent is
me or not me” is started in conjunction with the second
process. If they recognize the obvious “sense of others” at
this point, such as the actor’s face, clothes or complexion,
the vicarious sense of ownership to an actor’s body can be
remarkably disturbed. (4) Finally, the misattribution for self-
performance on the action that they did not perform, namely,
the OI arises at the source-memory test in Phase 3 when they
confuse a real agency gained in Phase 1 and vicarious agency
accidentally obtained in Phase 2 during remembering their
action in Phase 1. It is possible that the OI never occurred when
they made the judgment of “the agent was other” (i.e., they
inhibited their ownership to observing another) in the third
process.
CONCLUSION
We shed light on the possible relationship between self-
ownership/agency and false agency attribution in memory,
namely OI, and investigated the pure eﬀect of the attention
to the action itself. We demonstrated the eﬀect of attention to
the action itself as a fundamental factor to induce OI. Given
that attentive observation of another’s action could facilitate
MNS activation as a lure to misattribute the other’s action
to our self, our ﬁndings might reﬂect that MNS activation
facilitates the occurrence of OI. On the other hand, it is
possible to form a diﬀerent interpretation. Given that motor
resonance is thought to reﬂect MNS activation to facilitate in
peripheral vision (Leonetti et al., 2015), and that there may
be a higher cognitive mechanism for self-other distinction
controlling our self-agency judgment (Brass et al., 2009), our
result might be explained by another mechanism [i.e., the
agency-judgment mechanism including TPJ suggested by Brass
et al. (2009)] even though MNS is actually activated in the
inattentive condition. However, our study did not directly
modulate and measure MNS, so it cannot be mentioned
properly. Furthermore, it is conceivable that the instruction
in the experimental procedure may aﬀects the occurrence of
OI. In future, it is necessary to carry out OI experiments
with full attention to the inﬂuence of the instruction, such
as translation. Further investigations are required to directly
examine the relationship between OI and MNS as an index of
agency misattribution with participants’ self-reports (e.g., Tieri
et al., 2015) or other indirect methods (e.g., intentional binding;
