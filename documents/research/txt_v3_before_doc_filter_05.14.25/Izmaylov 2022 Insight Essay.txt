## More than a little sound

To say it  feels  like  a  blade twisted  between two  ribs  is to say  nothing.  It  is  a  pain,  real  and  tangible,  the  burn  scar of a hot stove on a hand-felt simultaneously throughout the entire body. It is the scratching static of a radio turned up to full blast, throwing my mind off any frequency that can coherently be comprehended. Ask someone to define misophonia,  also  known  as  selective  sound  sensitivity syndrome, and you might be told it is a condition in which a person is overly sensitive to certain sounds.

The  notion  of  the  condition,  only  recently  defined, might  be  shrugged  off  by  some;  not  all  in  the  scientific community are accepting of its clinical significance. What is the problem in a piece of gum tossed between a chewer's  teeth,  the  smacking  of  lips  while  munching  on a  burger, the tapping of a foot on a tiled floor? But to us with misophonia that wet-squish sound of chewing gum, the sound a mouth makes when biting into a burger, the tapping  of  a  foot  on  the  floor-they  feel  like  a  threat  to our  survival.  Such  sounds  set  off  a  continuous  alarming that  shrieks  inside  our  bodies  like  a  siren,  the  sensation of a metal vice around our lungs clamped so tight that all the breath is trapped outside our bodies, such anger that it turns into a honed edge of hostility. We fight to gain a grip on how we are feeling, knowing that applying a knockout punch  to  the assailant's mouth  is  not  an  acceptable response  to what  many  people  perceive as everyday sounds. Sometimes, we sit through it, forcing ourselves to breathe through every painful moment. Or we leave where we are-running from the middle of a classroom lecture or an office meeting, as the judging gazes of colleagues follow us to the door-and search for shelter in a quiet space.

Get over it-this is the advice I am given often. Try that with someone  who  has  clinical  depression  and  get  back  to  me with the results. I keep a pair of ear plugs handy like someone with type  1  diabetes  keeps  insulin  close  at  hand.  Both  are essential  for  survival.  I'll  be  surprised  if  you  aren't  close  to rolling your eyes at that seemingly absurd statement. But let me tell you more. One evening, I escaped into an apartment hallway  in  pyjamas  because  a  neighbour's  deep  bass  noise was blasting through the floor; better to sleep in a hallway than to lie in bed with that sound drilling through my body. Back in high school, the overwhelming racket on a school bus sometimes meant long afternoons of running home just for a quiet hour. And my college experience was not like most others; it meant driving nearly 2 hours to campus every day, going to class,  and then driving home those same 2 hours just to avoid a dorm where a roommate might like chewing gum. This is misophonia. When certain sounds feel like a gun pressed against one's head, the natural reaction is often to try to flee, even at great personal cost.

Misophonia  follows my  footsteps into the hospital like  the  shadows  tethered  to  my  feet,  touching  my  life in  ways  that  may  seem  unbelievable.  In  medical  school, I  hurried  into  the  operating  room  on  my  first  day  of  the surgery  clerkship,  and  I  was  so  eager  to  learn.  I  thought of  the  excitement  of  those  medical  students  who  grew up  yearning  to  be  surgeons;  for  them,  this  would  be the moment  they  had  eagerly awaited for so long. But  the  moment  of  anticipation  was  shattered,  like  a sledgehammer smashing into glass. I stood, shaking, with shards  of  my  excitement  scattered  all  around  my  feet  as I heard  loud  music.  A  tradition  in  all  operating  rooms, I  was  told.  The  music  is  selected  by  the  lead  surgeon.  Is bluegrass music not quite my taste? I murmured 'Oh, no, it's all right', and after the operation, I stood in the hallway outside  and  thought  of  the  other  medical  students  with misophonia who wanted to be surgeons. Did they stumble out  of  the  operating  room  after  their  first  experience to  sit  and  cry  with  the  feeling  of  sharp  splinters  in  their hands? Who would have thought career choices can hinge on misophonia? But this is the reality of placement in an environment  of  constant  sound,  one  that  most  people have no choice in. I wonder whether many future surgeons have  left  their  career  dreams  on  the  floor  outside  an operating  room  in  a  hallway  that  smells  of  disinfectant. Just because they're bothered by a little sound.

This is my story, but the struggle of those with misophonia  can  be  found  in  many  professions  outside of  medicine.  A  cashier  might  scan  a  customer's  grocery purchases,  but  her  entire  body  is  honed  on  the  tapping sound  a  colleague  makes  on  the  cash  register  keys  when entering  coupon  information.  And  a  worker  in  a  cubicle knows the threat of an enclosed space and people breathing all around them-then lunchtime comes, and the lip-smack sounds of people eating add to the daily challenges of office work.  A  college  professor  instructs  a  classroom,  and  she does  her  best  to  continue  teaching  despite  the  typing  on dozens  of  laptops,  the  crunching  of  snacks,  the  constant shuffle of papers moved around on desks.

Within medicine, the experience of misophonia extends beyond the operating room; as medical students, we have no power to stop our residents from chewing gum, and as residents we tremble to ask such a thing of our attendings. And  so,  such  sounds  follow  us  on  rounds  and  shout over  attempts  at  learning.  They  follow  us,  too,  into  the classroom and the workroom: the sound of fingers typing on keyboards or the small, repetitive motion of someone tapping a foot during a lecture. This is an apology, perhaps, on behalf of all the times when someone stepped out early from  a  lunch  lecture  with  no  apparent  explanation  as  to

why.  Maybe  they  were  trembling  at  a  certain  sound  but were afraid that others would not try to understand.

I  have whispered in secret with others like me, and we all have our unique forms of torment. For some, it is the dripby-drip  water  torture  of  a  leaky  tap.  Others,  trying  to  test in  school,  cannot  hear their own thoughts  above the  clock tick-tock-ticking  on  the  wall.  For  yet  others,  the  clicking of  someone  playing  with  a  pen  is  a  needle,  and  each  click leaves a prick of pain on screaming nerve endings. A woman, dating, might find love through the screen of her phone, but will tremble when her boyfriend breathes, instantly shaking with a rage she struggles to control. A man, married, might have to learn to count down from ten whenever his daughter yawns  and  to  eat  his  meals  alone  in  his  room,  living  in constant strain because his wife cannot understand why the sound of her chewing is of such concern. Each sound leaves tender  bruises  that  might  heal  on  their  own,  but  punch  a bruise often enough and it will deepen to a wound that scars. Ours  is  a  loud  world.  We  are,  constantly,  living  in  a  place where every slight brush with sound leaves us shaking.

I write this without knowing who these words will find, or who will find them; I write because someone two seats over in the workroom just waved off my request to chew just a little  bit  more quietly because 'sorry, but I like to pop my gum this way', refusing to believe such a seemingly small sound  is  like  a  weapon  threatening  my  survival  and  that this  is  not  an  exaggeration.  I write  because,  perhaps, you may brush this off as a mental illness as if that somehow makes  it  less  significant,  but  if  these  words  help  lend perspective  to  the  unspoken  struggles  of  your  peerskept silent from stigma, from fear of judgment, from the certainty  these  concerns  will  be  dismissed-then  think  of me in any way you wish.

I  am  only  here  to  say  you  decorate  yourself  with  song and  sound.  But  a  quiet  moment  looks  good  on you too, you  know. When  we  beg you:  please,  could  you  spit  out the gum? Know that you are lowering a gun. And you have helped us survive another night.
