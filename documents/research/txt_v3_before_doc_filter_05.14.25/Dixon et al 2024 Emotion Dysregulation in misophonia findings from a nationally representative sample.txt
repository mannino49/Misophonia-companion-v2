Sound sensitivityABSTRACT
A core feature of misophonia is the emotional distress that occurs in response to specific sounds (e.g., slurping, 
pen clicking). Despite the theorized connection between emotion dysregulation and misophonia, there is very 
little research on this topic. Examining emotion dysregulation and identifying the specific emotion regulation 
deficits that are associated with worse misophonia symptoms would advance our understanding of potential 
transdiagnostic factors central to misophonia symptoms; thereby informing the development of more targeted 
interventions. The current study sought to: 1) characterize emotion dysregulation among individuals with 
misophonia, 2) compare emotion dysregulation between individuals with clinical and subclinical misophonia, 
and 3) examine the unique role of emotion dysregulation across three domains of misophonia symptoms. This 
study included a large, nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (N 4005; 51.5% female; 62.5% White, 
non-Hispanic). Participants completed self-report questionnaires to assess misophonia symptoms (i.e., miso-
phonia sounds, emotional and behavioral reactions to misophonia sounds, and misophonia-related impairment), 
stress, and emotion dysregulation. The results revealed participants with misophonia reported significantly 
worse emotion regulation abilities compared to individuals with subclinical levels of misophonia. In addition, 
emotion dysregulation was significantly associated with sensitivity to misophonia sounds, reactions to miso-
phonia sounds, and misophonia-related impairment, even after accounting for covariates. Results support 
emotion dysregulation as an important element in misophonia and suggest certain dimensions of emotion dys-
regulation should be considered in future research and in the evaluation of treatment strategies used to reduce 
misophonia symptoms.
1.Introduction
Misophonia is a disorder characterized by reduced tolerance and 
intense negative responses to specific sounds (Swedo et al., 2022 ). 
Trigger sounds can be generated by a variety of sources and include 
eating sounds (e.g., slurping), nasal sounds (e.g., sniffing), mouth 
sounds (e.g., coughing), repetitive sounds (e.g., pen clicking), rustling 
sounds (e.g., plastic bags), and environmental sounds (e.g., clock 
ticking; Jager et al., 2020 ). Ongoing research suggests visual stimuli (e. 
g., leg swinging, seeing someone eat from across the room) may also 
trigger reactions in misophonia (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Jager et al., 
2020 ). Although as many as 27.6 –78.5% of individuals report sensitivity 
to misophonia sounds (Dixon et al., 2024 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ), 
population-based studies estimate 2.2–12.8% of adults experience clin-
ical levels of misophonia (Dixon et al., 2024 ; Jakubovski et al., 2022 ; 
Kılıç et al., 2021 ). For those with clinical levels of misophonia, severe impairment is observed across life domains including impaired occu-
pational (e.g., difficulties performing work tasks), social (e.g., social 
isolation), and academic functioning (e.g., concentration difficulties; 
Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ). Misophonia has also been shown to have a 
significant impact on individuals ’ mental health, with studies showing 
high rates of co-occurring psychological disorders (Jager et al., 2020 ; 
Rosenthal et al., 2022 ), suicidal thoughts due to misophonia symptoms 
(Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ), and increased risk of self-harm and suici-
dality (Simner and Rinaldi, 2023 ).
A key component of misophonia is the intense, negative emotional 
response to trigger sounds. More broadly, emotions involve a multidi -
mensional response that incorporates physiological, expressive, cogni -
tive, and motivational changes (Levenson, 2014 ), and the dispositional 
manner in which someone experiences, processes, and responds to this 
input of information is characterized by the (in)ability to regulate 
emotions. In particular, Gratz and Roemer ’s (2004) acceptance-based

model of emotion regulation emphasizes the awareness and acceptance 
of emotions and the ability to use strategies to engage in goal-directed 
behaviors and refrain from engaging in impulsive behaviors when 
experiencing negative emotions. Within misophonia, individuals expe-
rience a myriad of reactions to trigger sounds, ranging from irritation to 
rage, along with disgust and anxiety (Jager et al., 2020 ; Rouw and 
Erfanian, 2018 ), which are accompanied by corresponding behavioral 
expressions (e.g., verbal aggression, crying, moving away from sounds), 
physiological symptoms (e.g., muscle tension, increased heart rate, 
trembling), and cognitive responses (negative thoughts, attention diffi-
culties, hyperfocus; Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Erfanian et al., 2019 ; Jager 
et al., 2020 ; Rosenthal et al., 2021 ).
Extensive research has provided support for emotion dysregulation 
as a transdiagnostic factor affecting the development and maintenance 
of symptoms across psychopathology (Aldao et al., 2010 ; Gratz et al., 
2018 ), as well as contributing to worse outcomes in chronic health 
disease (Wierenga et al., 2017 ). Moreover, interventions that indirectly 
or directly target emotion dysregulation have been shown to improve 
emotion regulation and clinical outcomes (Gratz et al., 2015 ; Sakiris and 
Berle, 2019 ). Consequently, emotion dysregulation may be critical in 
further understanding the clinical presentation of misophonia and 
informing the development of effective treatments. However, only a few 
studies to date have investigated emotion dysregulation in relation to 
misophonia. This research has shown misophonia symptom severity is 
positively associated with general emotion dysregulation in college and 
community-based samples (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ; Guetta et al., 
2022 ; Kadivarian et al., 2023 ), with one study demonstrating associa -
tions between misophonia and specific emotion regulation deficits, 
including difficulties in engaging in goal-directed behavior, inhibiting 
impulsive urges and controlling behavior when upset, limited perceived 
access to emotion regulation strategies, and lack of emotional clarity 
(Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ). In addition, Cassiello-Robbins et al. 
(2020) found difficulties in the ability to control impulsive behaviors 
mediated the relationship between neuroticism and misophonia symp -
toms, suggesting this factor of emotion dysregulation may be particu -
larly influential in the expression of misophonia symptoms. Building 
upon this work, Guetta et al. (2022) demonstrated a unique association 
between emotion dysregulation and misophonia symptoms after con-
trolling for mental health symptoms. Altogether, this work documents 
preliminary evidence for a connection between emotion dysregulation 
and misophonia; however, additional research is needed to replicate and 
extend these findings to delineate associations between specific deficits 
in emotion regulation and different types of misophonia symptoms in 
more representative samples.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate emotion dysregulation in 
misophonia, and in particular, identify specific deficits that are associ -
ated with worse misophonia symptoms using a large, nationally repre -
sentative sample of U.S. adults. This research is important for advancing 
our understanding of possible mechanisms underlying misophonia 
symptoms, which has the potential to inform the development of more 
targeted interventions for misophonia. The aims of this study were to: 1) 
characterize emotion regulation difficulties among individuals with 
clinical levels of misophonia; 2) compare difficulties in emotion regu-
lation between individuals with clinical and subclinical levels of miso-
phonia, and 3) examine the unique role of emotion regulation 
difficulties across three domains of misophonia symptoms, including 
sensitivity to sounds, emotional and behavioral reactions to misophonia 
sounds, and misophonia-related impairment. We hypothesized emotion 
dysregulation would be significantly higher among individuals with 
clinical levels of misophonia compared to those with subclinical symp -
toms (i.e., individuals who endorsed sensitivity to misophonia sounds 
but scored below the clinical threshold). In addition, greater difficulties 
with emotion regulation were expected to account for unique variance 
in misophonia symptoms, after accounting for covariates.2.Methods and materials
2.1. Participants and procedures
This sample was comprised of 4005 adults aged 18 years and older 
who completed a survey through Ipsos KnowledgePanel (Knowledge -
Panel®). KnowledgePanel was used to recruit a large, nationally 
representative sample for a parent study that examined misophonia in 
the U.S. population (see Dixon et al., 2023 , 2024 for additional infor-
mation). KnowledgePanel uses address-based sampling methodology to 
select a truly random sample of adults based on all known households 
identified by the latest Delivery Sequence File from the U.S. Postal 
Service, and geodemographic benchmarks from the latest U.S. Census 
Bureau ’s Current Population Survey are used to calculate study-specific 
post-stratification weights, which corrects for potential over- or 
under-sampling of certain subgroups (Ipsos Public Affairs, n.d.). This 
study was approved by the university ’s institutional review board.
Consistent with the demographics of the U.S. population, 51.5% of 
participants were female and 62.5% identified as White, non-Hispanic, 
with 16.9% identifying as Hispanic; 12.0% Black, Non-Hispanic; 7.2% 
Other, non-Hispanic; and 1.4% multiracial, non-Hispanic. The mean age 
was 48.32 years (SD 17.76), 56.6% reported they were currently 
married, and 62.1% reported having at least some college education (see 
Supplementary Materials).
2.2. Measures
Stress. The 4-item version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4; 
Cohen et al., 1983 ) was used to control for recent stress. The PSS-4 as-
sesses perceived stress (e.g., unable to control important things) in the 
past month. Items are rated on a Likert-type scale from 0 (never) to 4 
(very often), with higher total scores indicating greater levels of stress. 
Perceived stress was included as a covariate to account for current 
distress given its association with emotion dysregulation (Gratz et al., 
2018 ), misophonia (Guetta et al., 2024 ), and functional impairment 
(McQuaid et al., 2022 ). The PSS-4 has been demonstrated to have good 
validity and reliability (Herrero and Meneses, 2006 ). In this study, in-
ternal reliability was good (α .70).
Emotion dysregulation. A brief version of the Difficulties in 
Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) was used to assess emotion dysregu -
lation (DERS-16; Bjureberg et al., 2016 ). The DERS-16 reduces partici -
pant burden and demonstrates strong internal reliability, good 
test-retest reliability, and good convergent and discriminant validity 
that is consistent with the original DERS (Bjureberg et al., 2016 ; Hallion 
et al., 2018 ; Sorman et al., 2022 ). Items are rated on a Likert-type scale 
from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). The DERS-16 includes five 
subscales that correspond with the DERS, including lack of emotional 
clarity (Clarity), difficulties engaging in goals (Goals), difficulties con-
trolling emotions when experiencing distress (Impulse), limited access 
to effective emotion regulation strategies (Strategies), and nonaccep -
tance of emotional responses (Nonacceptance). The DERS-16 total and 
subscale scores are computed by summing the relevant items, and higher 
scores indicate greater difficulties regulating emotions. In this study, 
internal validity was good for the DERS-16 total (α .96) and each of 
the subscales (αs .85 - .96).
Misophonia Symptoms. The Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu 
et al., 2014 ) was used to measure two facets of misophonia symptoms, 
including sensitivity to certain sounds (MQ Sounds Scale) and emotional 
and behavioral reactions to misophonia sounds (MQ Emotions and Be-
haviors Scale). The MQ Sounds Scale includes seven items assessing the 
presence of specific misophonia sound sensitivities (e.g., people eating) 
on a Likert-type scale from 0 (not at all true) to 4 (always true). The MQ 
Emotions and Behaviors Scale includes 10 items assessing emotions (e. 
g., anger) and actions (e.g., cover ears) that occur after hearing a trigger 
sound on a Likert-type scale from 0 (never) to 4 (always). Total scores 
are computed by summing the relevant items for each scale. In this L.J. Dixon et al.

study, good internal consistency was observed for the Sounds Scale (α 
.87) and Emotions and Behaviors Scale (α .87).
Misophonia-related Impairment. The Work and Social Adjustment 
Scale (WSAS; Mundt et al., 2002 ) was used to measure functional 
impairment due to misophonia across five domains, including ability to 
work, tasks for the home, social leisure activities, private leisure activ-
ities, and relationships with others. The items are each rated on a 
Likert-type scale from 0 (not at all) to 8 (very severely) and summed to 
create a total score, with higher scores indicating greater impairment. In 
this sample, good internal consistency was observed (α .90).
2.3. Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 28.0. KnowledgePanel 
sample weights were applied for all analyses. Data were initially 
screened, and after accounting for the questionnaire ’s skip logic, find-
ings from Little ’s Missing Completely at Random Test indicated data 
were missing at random. Mean imputation was used to compute total 
scores where participants responded to ≽75% of items on the scale.
First, descriptive statistics were examined, and zero-order correla -
tions were computed to explore associations between key study vari-
ables. Next, a series of independent samples t-tests were conducted to 
test the hypothesis that those with clinical levels of misophonia would 
evidence greater difficulties in emotion regulation than individuals with 
subclinical misophonia symptoms. Individuals with scores ≽7 on the 
MQ Severity Scale (Wu et al., 2014 ) and ≽10 on the Amsterdam Miso-
phonia Scale (Schroder et al., 2013 ) were identified as having clinically 
significant misophonia symptoms (n 185; see Dixon et al., 2024 ). The 
subclinical misophonia group was comprised of the remaining in-
dividuals who endorsed at least some level of sensitivity to one or more 
sounds on the MQ Sounds Scale (n 3490). Given the difference in 
sample sizes, equal variances were not assumed and Hedges ’ g effect 
sizes were calculated.
Next, a series of three-step hierarchical linear regression analyses 
were conducted in the full sample to test the hypothesis that greater 
emotion dysregulation would be uniquely associated with misophonia 
sounds (MQ Sounds Scale), emotional and behavioral reactions to 
misophonia sounds (MQ Emotions and Behavior Scale), and 
misophonia-related impairment (WSAS), after accounting for relevant 
covariates. In Step 1, demographic factors were entered, including: age 
(continuous variable), gender (female 0, male 1), race/ethnicity (0 
individuals identifying as Black/African American, Non-Hispanic; 
Other, Non-Hispanic; Hispanic; Multiple Races, Non-Hispanic [Persons 
of Color]; 1 White, Non-Hispanic [White]), education (0 high school 
or less; 1 at least some college), marital status (0 not married [never 
married, widowed, or divorced/separated]; 1 now married), income 
(0 household income D$75,000, 1 household income ≽$75,000), 
and employment (0 part-time employment or unemployed, 1 
employed full time). Race/ethnicity, education, marital status, and 
employment were dichotomized based on identified social determinants 
factors known to increase health risk (World Health Organization 
(WHO), n.d.), and income was dichotomized based on median house -
hold income in the U.S. (Guzman and Kollar, 2023 ). In Step 2, current 
stress (PSS-4) was entered, and facets of emotion regulation difficulties 
(DERS-16 subscales) were entered in Step 3 as the primary variables of 
interest. Multicollinearity was observed for the DERS-16 Strategies 
subscale (variance inflation factors [VIFs] F5, tolerance values D0.20) 
when all DERS-16 subscales were simultaneously entered in Step 3 of the 
regression analyses. Therefore, Strategies subscale was omitted from the 
model. Multicollinearity was not detected in the updated models (VIFs 
D3; tolerance values F0.35). All statistical tests were two-tailed with 
alpha .01.3.Results
3.1. Descriptive statistics and zero-order correlations
The means, standard deviations, sample size, ranges, and correla -
tions for the study variables are provided in Table 1. Positive and sta-
tistically significant correlations (ps D.001) were observed between all 
study variables. The associations between each of the emotion dysre -
gulation scales and sensitivity to misophonia sounds were small (rs 
.21–.27). Moderate associations were observed for each factor of 
emotion dysregulation and misophonia emotions and behaviors (rs 
.43 - .49) and misophonia-related impairment (rs .41 - .49).
3.2. Independent samples t-tests
Means, standard deviations, independent samples t-test results, and 
Hedge ’s g are reported in Table 2. Consistent with hypothesis, partici -
pants with clinical levels of misophonia reported significantly greater 
difficulties regulating emotions across each dimension, compared to 
those with subclinical misophonia symptoms. Large effects were 
observed (Hedge ’s g 1.26 –1.54).
3.3. Hierarchical regression analyses
Three hierarchical regression model were conducted to examine 
predictors of misophonia symptoms. The change in R2, unstandardized 
coefficients, standard errors, and significance level for each model are 
reported in Table 3.
3.3.1. Misophonia sounds
With regard to sensitivity to misophonia sounds, demographic fac-
tors accounted for 3.8% of the variance in Step 1 (F [7, 3888] 22.09, p 
D.001), and stress contributed 4.8% additional variance in Step 2 (F [8, 
3887] 46.12, p D.001). The emotion dysregulation factors were 
entered in Step 3 and accounted for an additional 3.8% of the variance in 
sensitivity to misophonia sounds (F [12, 3883] 46.07, p D.001), 
indicating a small effect (f2 .04). In the last step, Clarity, Goals, and 
Nonacceptance each emerged as significant predictors. The full model 
accounted for 12.5% of the variance in sensitivity to misophonia sounds, 
demonstrating a small-medium effect (f2 .14).
3.3.2. Reactions to misophonia sounds
In the model predicting emotional and behavioral reactions to 
misophonia sounds, demographic factors accounted for 6.5% of the 
variance in Step 1 (F [7, 3594] 35.86, p D.001), and stress contributed 
9.9% additional variance in Step 2 (F [8, 3593] 88.42, p D.001). 
Emotion dysregulation factors were entered in Step 3 and accounted for 
an additional 11.2% of the variance in reactions to misophonia sounds (F 
[12, 3589] 114.48, p D.001), indicating a medium effect (f2 .15). 
All four emotion dysregulation subscales emerged as significant pre-
dictors. The full model accounted for 27.7% of the variance in reactions 
to misophonia sounds, demonstrating a large effect (f2 .38).
3.3.3. Misophonia-related impairment
In the model predicting misophonia-related impairment, de-
mographic factors accounted for 4.1% of the variance in Step 1 (F [7, 
3688] 22.57, p D.001), and stress contributed 12.2% additional 
variance in Step 2 (F [8, 3687] 89.64, p D.001). Emotion dysregu -
lation factors were entered in Step 3 and accounted for an additional 
11.9% of the variance in misophonia-related impairment (F [12, 3683] 
120.62, p D.001), indicating a medium effect (f2 .17). The Clarity, 
Goals, and Impulse subscales emerged as significant predictors. The full 
model accounted for 28.2% of the variance in impairment, demon -
strating a large effect (f2 .39).L.J.

4.Discussion
This study used a large, nationally representative sample to elucidate 
the role of emotion dysregulation in misophonia. Two of the prominent 
findings that emerged were that individuals with clinical levels of 
misophonia had significantly greater difficulties in emotion regulation 
compared to those with subclinical symptoms, and emotion dysregula -
tion was significantly associated with misophonia symptoms – above 
and beyond variance accounted for by demographic factors and current 
stress. These findings and the specific patterns observed across the re-
sults help inform the conceptualization of misophonia symptoms.
The first aim was to characterize emotion regulation difficulties in a 
large, diverse sample of adults with clinical levels of misophonia. The 
scores on the DERS-16 in the misophonia sample were similar to means 
reported by community samples of adults reporting emotion dysregu -
lation (e.g., Bjureberg et al., 2016 ); whereas the subclinical group re-
ported scores consistent with nonclinical, community-based samples (e. 
g., Sorman et al., 2022 ). These findings are not surprising; yet, the 
descriptive results established by this nationally representative sample 
of adults with clinical and subclinical levels of misophonia provide a 
useful reference point for understanding levels of emotion regulation 
difficulties among individuals with misophonia in research and clinical 
settings. That is, clinicians and researchers who administer the DERS-16 
or DERS to individuals with misophonia can use the means from this 
study to help contextualize the scores on these measures. In particular, 
this information may be helpful for detecting strengths or weaknesses in 
emotion regulation abilities and comparing patterns across samples.As hypothesized, significantly greater difficulties in emotion regu-
lation were observed in the misophonia group compared to the sub-
clinical group. Large effect sizes were observed for the DERS-16 total 
score and each of the subscales, indicating difficulties across the di-
mensions of emotion regulation. These findings dovetail with past 
research showing worse emotion regulation abilities in clinical 
compared to control samples (e.g., Miola et al., 2022 ; Oldershaw et al., 
2015 ; Stellern et al., 2023 ). Collectively, this evidence indicates emotion 
dysregulation is central to many disorders, particularly when negative 
emotions are present, and misophonia is no exception. As those with 
misophonia exhibited deficits across all emotion regulation abilities, 
future research should conduct comparisons with clinical groups to 
identify deficits that may be particularly unique to misophonia 
symptomatology.
Consistent with prior work (Guetta et al., 2022 ), difficulties in 
emotion regulation accounted for unique variance in misophonia 
symptoms after controlling for demographic factors and current stress. 
Given this result was observed in a nationally representative sample, this 
finding is particularly noteworthy and indicates a robust relationship 
between these variables that is not influenced by sampling and selection 
biases that are inherent to most studies. The models examining emotion 
dysregulation as a predictor of reactions to misophonia sounds and 
misophonia-related impairment yielded medium effects and accounted 
for a larger portion of variance compared to the model predicting 
sensitivity to misophonia sounds where a small effect was observed. This 
pattern aligns with theoretical models of emotion regulation (Gratz 
et al., 2018 ; Gratz and Roemer, 2004 ) that emphasize how individuals Table 1

understand and respond to emotions (e.g., distress elicited by miso-
phonia sounds) rather than how often distress is experienced, or in this 
case, how often one is exposed to misophonia sounds. Nevertheless, 
emotion regulation accounted for a small, but significant portion of 
variance in sensitivity to misophonia sounds. In this model, the Clarity, 
Goals, and Nonacceptance subscales were significant, which corre -
sponds to difficulties in knowing and being clear about one’s emotions, 
focusing on and engaging in goal-directed behaviors, and having a 
tendency to be less accepting of distress reactions and experiencing 
secondary negative reactions to the distress (e.g., anger, embarrass -
ment), respectively. Although it is possible that these aspects of emotion 
dysregulation may predispose someone to greater sensitivity to or 
perception of trigger sounds, it seems unlikely that these factors would 
influence the frequency of exposure to misophonia sounds. However, in 
light of the cross-sectional nature of the study design, one consideration 
is that greater frequency of exposure to misophonia sounds may worsen 
one’s abilities to regulate emotions in these specific ways. Future studies 
using experimental and experience sampling methodologies are needed 
to understand the temporal associations among these processes.
With regard to the model predicting emotional and behavioral re-
actions to misophonia, all tested dimensions of emotion dysregulation 
were significant, and emotion dysregulation accounted for a larger 
portion of the variance than current stress or demographic factors. Prior 
work has similarly found a unique association between general emotion 
dysregulation and misophonia emotions and behaviors (Guetta et al., 
2022 ) and shown that difficulties inhibiting impulsive behaviors when 
distressed mediated the relationship between trait neuroticism and 
misophonia symptoms (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ). The current results extend the literature by specifically identifying emotional clarity, 
emotional acceptance, and the abilities to remain in control of one’s 
behaviors and engage in goal-directed behaviors when distressed as 
important factors that may affect one’s reaction to misophonia triggers. 
Moreover, three of the four emotion regulation abilities, including the 
Clarity, Goals, and Impulse subscales, were also significant predictors of 
misophonia-related impairment. The results are the first to demonstrate 
that emotion dysregulation is significantly and uniquely associated with 
impaired functioning in misophonia. Taken together, these findings may 
be useful for informing treatments for individuals with misophonia. 
Specifically, clinicians should consider implementing treatment strate -
gies that may directly or indirectly target these respective emotion 
regulation abilities to improve misophonia symptoms (see Gratz et al., 
2015 ).
Although this study advances research on emotion regulation pro-
cesses in misophonia and the methodology addresses sampling and se-
lection biases inherent to other studies, there are notable limitations that 
should be considered. First, this study was cross-sectional and causality 
cannot be inferred from the current results. Prospective studies are 
needed to examine which factors of emotion dysregulation predict the 
onset and worsening of misophonia. Second, the number of survey items 
was limited. Although the questionnaires included in this study have 
been shown to have strong psychometric properties, more comprehen -
sive questionnaires may offer additional insights on patterns of emotion 
regulation in misophonia. In addition, future work should consider the 
use recently developed measures of misophonia that emphasize the 
criteria provided by the consensus definition of misophonia (e.g., Duke 
Vanderbilt Misophonia Screening Questionnaire; Williams et al., 2022 ) Table 3

and consult ongoing research in this area. Third, stress was included as a 
control variable to capture current distress resulting from external 
stressors and psychological symptoms; however, future studies should 
consider accounting for additional diagnoses or psychological processes 
that may impact emotion dysregulation and misophonia symptoms (e.g., 
anxiety, depression). Fourth, in the absence of diagnostic criteria, this 
study identified individuals with clinical levels of misophonia by using 
two criterion that have been established in prior research (Dixon et al., 
2024 ; Jakubovski et al., 2022 ; Mollmann et al., 2023 ). However, miso-
phonia is a heterogenous disorder. The current findings indicate 
emotion dysregulation is important in misophonia, and in particular, 
reactions to misophonia sounds and impairment. Nevertheless, addi-
tional research is needed to comprehensively understand how emotion 
regulation abilities and strategies factor into the development, mainte -
nance, and treatment of misophonia.
Finally, we were unable to examine the specific role of engagement 
in emotion regulation strategies (i.e., DERS-16 Strategies subscale) due 
to multicollinearity; however, moderate bivariate correlations were 
observed for its association with reactions to misophonia sounds and 
misophonia-related impairment. Additional studies are needed to 
explicate how this specific emotion regulation ability relates to miso-
phonia symptoms in the context of other psychological factors. 
Furthermore, this study used Gratz and Roemer ’s conceptualization of 
emotion dysregulation, which is posited to function as the higher-level 
processing of emotions in a situation that subsequently informs the se-
lection and deployment of discreet emotion regulation strategies (e.g., 
reappraisal, suppression) that are further delineated by Gross ’s process 
model of emotion regulation (Gratz et al., 2018 ; Gross, 2015 ). Future 
research should consider the repertoire of emotion regulation abilities 
and strategies that may be most beneficial to individuals with miso-
phonia to further inform the development of effective treatment 
packages.
5.Conclusions
In sum, this is one of the first studies to examine specific factors of 
emotion dysregulation in misophonia. The results indicate emotion 
dysregulation is important in misophonia by differentiating individuals 
with clinical levels of misophonia from those with subclinical miso-
phonia and demonstrating significant associations with misophonia 
symptoms. Moreover, medium effects were observed for the unique role 
of emotion dysregulation, beyond demographics and stress, in models 
examining reactions to misophonia sounds and misophonia-related 
impairment. These findings are strengthened by this study ’s rigorous 
methodology, including probability-based sampling and a sample 
representative of the U.S. population, and underscore the need for 
additional research examining this factor in misophonia, particularly 
given the limited treatment options for misophonia and the ability to 
address emotion dysregulation through psychological interventions to 
improve outcomes (Gratz et al., 2015 ; Sakiris and Berle, 2019 ).
