Abstract: Background/Objectives: The Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire version
2 (SSSQ2) is a brief clinical tool with six items designed to be used (1) as a measure for
severity of sound sensitivity symptoms in general (based on its total score) and (2) as a
checklist to screen different forms of sound sensitivity. The objective of this study was
to assess the psychometric properties of the SSSQ2. Method: This was a cross-sectional
study. A total of 451 people completed the online survey. A total of 154 people completed
the survey twice with a two-week interval to establish test–retest reliability. The average
age of the participants was 36.5 years (range 18 to 86 years). Results: Confirmatory factor
analysis showed that the SSSQ2 is a one-factor questionnaire. Cronbach’s αwas 0.80. The
test–retest reliability was good for the total SSSQ2 score and was moderate for the sum of
items 1 and 3 (indicating loudness hyperacusis), item 2 (for pain hyperacusis), item 4 (for
misophonia), item 5 (for fear hyperacusis), and item 6 (for noise sensitivity). The minimum
amount of change that constitutes a true change in the total SSSQ2 score is ≥5 points.
Conclusions: The SSSQ2 can be used in clinical practice or research setting to measure the
severity of general sound sensitivity as a one-factor questionnaire with acceptable internal
consistency and good reliability. In addition, the individual items in the SSSQ2 can be used
as a checklist to screen for various forms of sound sensitivity.

1. Introduction
Sound sensitivity, in this paper, is used as an umbrella term encompassing various dis-
orders of sound intolerance ranging from hyperacusis to misophonia and noise sensitivity.
Hyperacusis is the perception of certain everyday sounds, such as domestic noise or noise
in public places, as too loud or painful in such a way that it causes significant distress and
impairment in social, occupational, recreational, and other day-to-day activities [ 1,2]. There
are several forms of hyperacusis (i.e., loudness, pain, and fear hyperacusis) [ 3]. Loudness
hyperacusis refers to perception of certain everyday sounds (e.g., people’s voices, traffic
noise, music, wind noise, hand dryers, hair dryers, door slamming, dogs barking, and
the noise made by household appliances) as uncomfortably loud [ 4,5]. Individuals with
loudness hyperacusis may also experience certain bodily sensations (e.g., aural fullness,
pressure in ears, spasm/flutter in the ears, ear popping/clicking, resonance, distortion,

Brain Sci. 2025 ,15, 16 2 of 14
and/or vibration in the ears) when exposed to loud sounds [ 6]. Pain hyperacusis, also
called noxacusis, is characterised by the experience of aural pain (e.g., stabbing, throb-
bing, pinching, dull ache, sharp pain, burning pain) when exposed to certain day-to-day
sounds [ 6–8]. Some individuals with pain hyperacusis also report perceiving pain in their
face, sides of head, behind the ears, or elsewhere in their body [ 8]. Pain hyperacusis is
different from the “auditory nociception” which is a term used for a pain-like sensation in
the ear resulting from a damage to the hair cells or other tissues in the cochlea following
exposure to unsafe levels of noise [ 9,10]. According to the most recent studies on the effect
of noise on the human body, safe noise exposure to prevent tissue damage within the
cochlea and to prevent noise-induced hearing loss is about 55–60 dB (A) for a day [ 11,12].
Individuals with pain hyperacusis report experiencing pain even from short-lasting sounds
with intensities between 30 and 60 dB (HL) [ 13,14] which are well below the level that can
cause any damage to the cochlea in a short span of time. Fear hyperacusis, also known as
phonophobia, is defined as being afraid of exposure to certain sounds as an anticipatory
fear response to either the loudness of the sounds or their impact on the individual, which
can exist with or without loudness and pain hyperacusis [ 3,5]. In fear hyperacusis, it is the
fear that a sound may occur and will either hurt their ears, make their hearing or tinnitus
worse, make them more sensitive to sounds, or impact on their mental or physical health,
that is the dominant symptom [ 5,15]. Misophonia is defined as the experience of extreme
annoyance, disgust, anger, and anxiety when hearing one or more specific sound(s) or
stimuli associated with such sounds [ 5,16,17]. The sounds that typically impact individuals
with misophonia include but are not limited to sounds associated with oral functions
(e.g., chewing, swallowing, lip smacking, slurping, certain people’s voice, whistles, and
certain letters such as “S”), nasal sounds (e.g., breathing, snoring), non-oral/nasal sounds
produced by people (e.g., tapping, clicking, crepitus), and sounds produced by objects
(e.g., clock ticking) or sounds generated by animals (e.g., clucking) [ 16,18]. Another form
of sound sensitivity that can co-occur with hyperacusis and misophonia is called “noise
sensitivity” [ 15]. This is a personality trait characteristic involving underlying attitudes
towards noise in general [ 19]. A person with high noise sensitivity may perceive noise
caused by neighbours, nearby factories, workshops, farms, radiators, air conditioning,
and background music as disruptive and distressing, regardless of the loudness of such
sounds [ 19,20]. Noise sensitivity can sometimes be high enough to cause significant distress
in a person’s life [21,22].
The Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire version 2 (SSSQ2) is a brief self-report
measure developed at Hashir International Institute (HII), United Kingdom, as a clinical
tool for audiologists and other relevant healthcare professionals. The first version of this
questionnaire, the SSSQ, had five items assessing loudness hyperacusis, pain hyperacusis,
misophonia, and fear hyperacusis [ 2]. The second version, the SSSQ2, has six items. One
item has been added to assess noise sensitivity (item 6). We previously reported psychomet-
ric properties for the first version of SSSQ, which was found to be a one-factor questionnaire
with good internal consistency, with a Cronbach’s αof 0.87 [ 2,23]. However, it is necessary
to test the second version in a new sample in order to establish its factor structure, validity,
and reliability [ 24]. The SSSQ2 is intended to be used (1) as a psychometric measure for
severity of sound sensitivity symptoms in general (based on its total score) and (2) as a
checklist to screen different forms of sound sensitivity (i.e., loudness hyperacusis, pain
hyperacusis, fear hyperacusis, misophonia, and noise sensitivity). Therefore, in addition to
assessing the psychometric properties of the SSSQ2 as a six-item measure, it is important to
validate the use of its individual items or combinations of the items to screen for various
forms of sound sensitivity.

The aims of this study are to assess (1) the factor structure of the SSSQ2, and (2) the va-
lidity, reliability, and minimum detectable change for the SSSQ2 and its items/combinations
of items.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Ethical Approval
The research obtained ethical approval from the University of Surrey Research Integrity
and Governance Office (Project ID: FHMS 21-22 083).
2.2. Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire Version 2 (SSSQ2)
As shown in Table 1, SSSQ2 is a six-item questionnaire that assesses the severity
of symptoms for several types of sound sensitivity by asking the patient to indicate the
frequency of occurrence of each symptom over a two weeks period. For each item, a score
of 0, 1, 2, or 3 is assigned to the response categories of “0 to 1 days”, “2 to 6 days”, “7
to 10 days”, and “11 to 14 days”, respectively. The total SSSQ2 score is calculated from
the sum of the scores for the six items and it ranges between 0 and 18. The SSSQ2 can be
used for two purposes, namely (1) to measure the severity of sound sensitivity symptoms
in general based on its total score and (2) to act as a checklist to screen different forms
of sound sensitivity. The sum of items 1, 2, 3 and 5 assesses hyperacusis in general (a
combination of loudness, pain and fear hyperacusis). The sum of items 1 and 3 assesses
loudness hyperacusis. Item 2 asks about pain hyperacusis. Item 4 asks about misophonia.
Item 5 asks about fear hyperacusis and item 6 asks about noise sensitivity.

2.3. Study Design and Participants
This was a psychometric study with cross-sectional survey design. An online survey
was developed using the Qualtrics platform (Qualtrics, Provo, UT, USA, https://www.
qualtrics.com). In addition to the SSSQ2, several validated self-report questionnaires were
included in the online survey, as summarized in Table 2, comprising: the Hyperacusis
Impact Questionnaire (HIQ) [ 2], MisoQuest [ 25], the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale Revised
(AMISO-R) [ 26], the Tinnitus Impact Questionnaire (TIQ) [ 27,28], Screening for Anxiety
and Depression in Tinnitus (SAD-T) [ 2], and the Hearing Handicap Inventory (HHI) [ 29].
The survey included two screening questions asking if the participant had tinnitus and
hearing difficulties. The tinnitus question was: “Do you currently experience tinnitus that
lasts more than five minutes? (Tinnitus is hearing a sound in your ears or head with no
external source (e.g., buzzing, high-pitch whistle, hissing . . .)”. The question for hearing
difficulties was: “Do you have hearing loss? (Hearing loss refers to partial or complete
inability to hear sounds in one or both ears.)”. The participants who answered “yes” to the
screening questions about tinnitus and hearing difficulties were directed to complete the
TIQ and HHI, respectively. If they answered “no”, then they were not asked to complete
the TIQ or HHI.

The survey was emailed to students and staff members at the University of Surrey and
was shared with various patient support groups relevant to tinnitus and sound intolerance
via email and social media platforms. Study participants were invited to complete the
survey twice with a two-week interval so the data could be used for both factor analysis
and assessment of test–retest reliability of the SSSQ2.

Brain Sci. 2025 ,15, 16 5 of 14
A total of 451 people completed the online survey, of which 154 individuals completed
the survey twice.
2.4. Statistical Analysis
The data were anonymized prior to conducting statistical analyses. The structural
validity of the six-item SSSQ2 was tested by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for which
the values required for good model fit comprise: Standardized Root Mean Square Residual
(SRMR) ≤0.08 [ 30], Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) ≤0.08 [ 30],
Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) ≥0.90 [ 31], Comparative Fit Index (CFI) ≥0.90 [ 31], Goodness of
Fit Indexes (GFI) ≥0.90 [32], and CMIN (Chi-square/df) = 3–5 [33].
The endorsement rate, which is the percentage of respondents who gave the same
response for each of the SSSQ2 items, was reported. This is used to compare the frequency
of experiencing various forms of sound sensitivity symptoms. Internal consistency was
measured with Cronbach’s αand McDonald’s ω[34] for which values greater than 0.7 are
considered acceptable [ 35]. Test–retest reliability over a two-week interval was determined
by computing the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICC is a value between 0
and 1, where values below 0.5 indicate poor reliability, between 0.5 and 0.75 moderate
reliability, between 0.75 and 0.90 good reliability, and values above 0.90 indicate excellent
reliability [ 36]. T-tests were used for comparing means between test and retest scores.
The ICC was calculated for the total SSSQ2 score and for its items and combination of
items. The minimum detectable change (MDC) was calculated using the standard error of
measurement (SEM) based on the standard deviation (SD) of the difference between the
test and retest scores. The MDC indicates the minimum change in the questionnaire score
(i.e., total SSSQ2 score, its items and combinations of the items) that is required to be 95%
confident that the difference in scores between multiple tests reflects a true change and
not the measurement error [ 37]. The SEM and MDC were calculated with the following
formulae: SEM = SD/√2 and MDC (with 95% confidence interval) = SEM ×√2×1.96.
The convergent and discriminant validity of the SSSQ2 were examined by calculating
the Pearson correlation coefficients between SSSQ2 variables (i.e., total score, the score of
the SSSQ2 items and combinations of items) and (1) the measures related to sound sensi-
tivity construct (i.e., HIQ, MisoQuest, and AMISOS-R) for convergent validity and (2) the
measures assessing constructs other than sound sensitivity, namely hearing loss, tinnitus
impact, and anxiety/depression (i.e., HHI, TIQ, and SAD-T), for discriminant validity.
The correlation coefficients of ≥0.5, 0.30–0.49, and 0.10–0.29 indicate strong, moderate,
and weak relationships, respectively [ 38]. The data collected from the 451 participants
who completed the first survey were used for the CFA, Cronbach’s αand McDonald’s ω,
and the Pearson correlations for convergent and discriminant validity. The data for the
154 participants who completed the first and second surveys with a two-week interval
were used to calculate ICC for test–retest reliability and MDC. Statistical analyses were
conducted using IBM SPSS software version 28.0, and Amos version 28.0. Some of the
participants did not complete all of the questionnaires included in the survey. The number
of participants (N) who were included to each analysis is reported.
3. Results
3.1. Characteristics of the Study Population
The average age of the participants was 36.5 years (standard deviation, SD = 12.8 years,
range 18 to 86 years) and 60.3% were female. The mean scores and SD for the SSSQ2,
MisoQuest, HIQ, AMISOS-R, SAD-T, TIQ, and HHI were 6.6 (SD = 4.3, N = 451), 49
(SD = 12 , N = 451), 9.6 (SD = 6.1, N = 451), 18.8 (SD = 9.2, N = 451), 2.4 (SD = 1.9, N = 448 ),
7.7 (SD = 6.0, N = 173), 21.2 (SD = 9.4, N = 87), respectively. Only participants who reported

Brain Sci. 2025 ,15, 16 6 of 14
having hearing difficulties (18.4% of the sample, N = 87) completed the HHI. Based on the
scores for the HHI, among patients with self-reported hearing difficulties, 11.5% ( N = 10 )
had no hearing handicap, 51.7% (N = 45) had a mild-moderate handicap, and 36.8% ( N = 32 )
had a severe hearing handicap. Based on scores for the HIQ, hyperacusis had a significant
impact among 35.5% of patients (N = 160). Based on scores for MisoQuest, 21.7% of patients
(N = 98) had significant misophonia. Based on scores for the AMISOS-A, 20.2% of patients
(N = 91) had no misophonia (i.e., had sub-clinical symptoms), 34.1% ( N = 154 ) had a mild
misophonia, 35.5% (N = 160) had a moderate misophonia, and 10.2% (N = 46) had a
severe to extreme misophonia. Based on scores for the SAD-T, 27% of patients ( N = 121 )
had symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Thirty-nine percent of patients (N = 176)
reported experiencing tinnitus, of which 173 completed the TIQ. Based on scores for the
TIQ, 36.4% of patients (N = 63) had no tinnitus handicap, 9.3% (N = 16) had a mild tinnitus
handicap, 12.1% (N = 21) had a moderate tinnitus handicap, and 42.2% (N = 73) had a
severe tinnitus handicap.
3.2. Confirmatory Factor Analysis
The factor structure of the SSSQ2, is shown in Figure 1. One factor model for the SSSQ2
with six items gave a good fit for all measures of goodness of fit. Table 3 demonstrates that
RMSEA and SRMR values met the criteria of ≤0.08, and CFI, TLI and GFI of ≥0.90. The
CMIN was very close to 3. These findings support a good fit for the one factor model for the
SSSQ2. Table 4 shows that item 6 (noise sensitivity) and item 4 (misophonia) were endorsed
more than other items of the SSSQ2. With regard to item endorsement, items 6 and 4 were
followed by items 1, 5, 3, and 2. Item 2 (pain hyperacusis) was the least endorsed item.
The higher percentage of people selected the response choice of “2–6 days” for items 1, 4,
and 6. However for items 2, 3, and, 5, the most frequently selected response choice was
“0–1 days”.

= 6.0, N = 173), 21.2 (SD = 9.4, N = 87), respectively. Only participants who reported having 
hearing di ﬃculties (18.4% of the sample, N = 87) completed the HHI. Based on the scores 
for the HHI, among patients with self-reported hearing di ﬃculties, 11.5% (N = 10) had no 
hearing handicap, 51.7% (N = 45) had a mild-moderate handicap, and 36.8% (N = 32) had 
a severe hearing handicap. Based on scores for the HIQ, hyperacusis had a signi ﬁcant 
impact among 35.5% of patients (N = 160). Ba sed on scores for MisoQuest, 21.7% of pa-
tients (N = 98) had signi ﬁcant misophonia. Based on scores for the AMISOS-A, 20.2% of 
patients (N = 91) had no misophonia (i.e., had sub-clinical symptoms), 34.1% (N = 154) had a mild misophonia, 35.5% (N = 160) had a moderate misophonia, and 10.2% (N = 46) had 
a severe to extreme misophonia. Based on scores  for the SAD-T, 27% of patients (N = 121) 
had symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Th irty-nine percent of patients (N = 176) re-

3.3. Reliability
Both Cronbach’s αand McDonald’s ωestimate for the SSSQ2 were 0.80, which indicate
acceptable internal consistency. All of the items were strongly correlated with the total
SSSQ2 score (Table 5). As shown in Table 6, there were no statistically significant differences
in the mean scores for SSSQ2 variables between the first and the second surveys, which
were taken with a two-week interval (except from the score for item 5, fear hyperacusis).
The score for item 5 was slightly but significantly lower in the second test (retest) compared
with the first test by an average of 0.29 points. However, the mean change for other
SSSQ2 variables between the first and second tests was less than 0.28 points and not
statistically significant. The test–retest reliability was rated as good for the total SSSQ2 score
(indicating the severity of sound sensitivity symptoms) and the sum of items 1, 2, 3, and 5
(indicating general hyperacusis) based on their ICC values, which were above 0.75. The test–
retest reliability was rated as moderate for the sum of items 1 and 3 (indicating loudness
hyperacusis) based on the ICC value of between 0.5 and 0.75. Single items comprising:
item 2 (for pain hyperacusis), item 4 (for misophonia), item 5 (for fear hyperacusis), and
item 6 (for noise sensitivity) also shown to have moderate test–retest reliability.
Based on the MDC values, when this questionnaire is used for repeated measurements,
the minimum amount of change that constitutes a true change in sound sensitivity is ≥5
for the total SSSQ2 score, ≥4 for general hyperacusis (the sum of items 1, 2, 3, and 5), ≥3
for loudness hyperacusis (sum of items 1 and 3), and ≥2 for pain hyperacusis (item 2),
misophonia (item 4), fear hyperacusis (item 5), and noise sensitivity (item 6) (Table 6).

Table 5. Correlations between the total SSSQ2 score, its individual items and the combinations of the
items (N = 451). Numbers in the table refer to the correlation coefficients ( r). All of the correlations
were statistically significant ( p< 0.01). The total SSSQ2 score represents the severity of sound sensitiv-
ity symptoms. The sum of the items 1, 2, 3 and 5 (Items 1235) represents hyperacusis in general. The
sum of items 1 and 3 (items 13) represents loudness hyperacusis. Item 2 represents pain hyperacusis.
Items 4, 5, and 6 represent misophonia, fear hyperacusis, and noise sensitivity, respectively.

3.4. Discriminant and Convergent Validity
Discriminant validity of the total SSSQ2 score was demonstrated based on its weak
relationship with the HHI score. The scores for general hyperacusis (the sum of items 1, 2, 3
and 5), loudness hyperacusis (sum of items 1 and 3), pain hyperacusis (item 2), misophonia
(item 4), fear hyperacusis (item 5), and noise sensitivity (item 6) were also weakly correlated
with the score on HHI demonstrating that they too differentiate between handicap caused
by hearing loss and various forms of sound sensitivity. The weakest relationship was
observed between misophonia (item 4) and HHI (Table 7).

The total score for the SSSQ2 (sum of all six items), and the scores for general hy-
peracusis (sum of items 1, 2, 3, and 5), and loudness hyperacusis (sum of items 1 and 3)
were strongly correlated with the total HIQ score. The scores for pain hyperacusis (item
2), misophonia (item 4), fear hyperacusis (item 5), and noise sensitivity (item 6) were
moderately with total HIQ score. Overall, this provides evidence for convergent validity
(Table 7). The misophonia score (item 4) was moderately correlated with the MisoQuest
and AMISOS-R scores, which are self-report questionnaires also aiming to measure the
construct of misophonia. The total SSSQ2 score was moderately and strongly correlated
with MisoQuest and AMISOS-R, respectively. This shows that SSSQ2 encompasses the
construct of misophonia in addition to hyperacusis. It is worth noting that the scores for
general hyperacusis (sum of items 1, 2, 3, and 5), loudness hyperacusis (sum of items 1 and
3), pain hyperacusis (item 2), fear hyperacusis (item 5), and noise sensitivity (item 6) were
weakly correlated with the total MisoQuest score, providing evidence for their discriminant
validity as they aim to assess the constructs that are different from misophonia (i.e., hypera-
cusis and noise sensitivity). As shown in Table 7, correlations with another misophonia
questionnaire (AMISOS-R) showed that except from the score of pain hyperacusis (item
2), which was weakly correlated with the AMISOS-R, the scores of general hyperacusis
(sum of items 1, 2, 3, and 5), loudness hyperacusis (sum of items 1 and 3), fear hyperacusis
(item 5), and noise sensitivity (item 6) were moderately correlated with the AMISOS-R total
scores. There were moderate to strong correlations between SSSQ2 and the scores of SAD-T
and TIQ indicating that severity of sound sensitivity in general and various forms of sound

Brain Sci. 2025 ,15, 16 10 of 14
sensitivity are related to mental health and tinnitus distress (among patients who also had
tinnitus). There was a weak but not statistically significant correlation between SSSQ2 and
age. The total SSSQ2 score was not significantly correlated with gender ( r= 0.004, p= 0.93).
4. Discussion
Our results showed that the SSSQ2 can be used as a one-factor questionnaire to assess
the construct of sound sensitivity symptoms encompassing various forms of hyperacusis
(i.e., loudness, pain, and fear hyperacusis), misophonia, and noise sensitivity. Therefore,
the total SSSQ2 score can be used in day-to-day clinical practice or research settings to
measure the severity of sound sensitivity as a whole. This is consistent with previous
studies reporting a significant overlap between symptoms of various forms of hyperacusis,
misophonia, and noise sensitivity [ 6,39–41]. The total SSSQ2 score is strongly correlated
with the HIQ and AMISOS-R scores and moderately correlated with the total MisoQuest
score. These questionnaires aim to assess constructs related to sound sensitivity (i.e.,
the HIQ assesses the impact of hyperacusis on the patient’s life, while AMISOS-R and
MisoQuest assess the severity of misophonia symptoms) so their relationships with SSSQ2
indicate the convergent validity of the SSSQ2. The total SSSQ2 score was only weakly
related to the HHI scores. This indicates the discriminant validity of the SSSQ2 because
the HHI assesses the impact of hearing impairment which is a construct different from
that of sound sensitivity. Past research suggests that hyperacusis and misophonia are not
related to hearing impartment [ 42,43]. The total SSSQ2 score was strongly correlated with
anxiety and depression as measured via SAD-T and tinnitus distress as measured via TIQ.
This is consistent with previous research studies suggesting that hyperacusis, misophonia,
and noise sensitivity are closely linked with anxiety and depression as well as tinnitus
distress (among patients with tinnitus) [ 44–46]. The total SSSQ2 score was weakly but not
significantly correlated with age. This is different from a small but statistically significant
negative correlation reported between the score of the first version of the SSSQ and age [ 2].
The discrepancy with regard to the relationship with age may be due to the characteristics
of the study populations. The study population in the present study was younger with
the mean age of was 36.5 years (SD = 12.8 years) compared to that of the study on the first
version of the SSSQ with the mean age of 54 years (SD = 16 years).
It is important to note that although all six items of the SSSQ2 are strongly correlated
with its total score (as shown in Table 5), it is possible that a patient reports very frequent
experience of a particular form of sound sensitivity (i.e., by selecting the response choice of
“11–14 days” for a single item) without exhibiting high scores on other items. This can lead
to a relatively low total SSSQ2 score, despite reporting high severity for one form of sound
sensitivity (e.g., only reporting misophonia without any hyperacusis or noise sensitivity
components). Therefore, the clinicians and researchers should pay attention to the scores of
individual items too (e.g., item 2 for pain hyperacusis, item 4 for misophonia, item 5 for
fear hyperacusis and item 6 for noise sensitivity). Our results showed that the total SSSQ2
score (sum of the six items) and the score for general hyperacusis (sum of items 1, 2, 3, 5)
have good test–retest reliability with ICC values of above 0.75. However, when using the
score for loudness hyperacusis (sum of items 1 and 2), or single items for pain hyperacusis
(item 2), misophonia (item 4), fear hyperacusis (item 5) and noise sensitivity (item 6), the
test–retest reliability is at moderate level with ICC values between 0.50 and 0.75. As the
test–retest reliability of the single items is less than that of the total SSSQ2 score, single
items should be used with caution, taking this limitation into account.
The SSSQ2 can be used in clinical practice or research to assess the change in self-report
severity of sound sensitivity symptoms before and after a treatment. In the present study,
we reported the values of MDC, which demonstrate the minimum change in the ques-

Brain Sci. 2025 ,15, 16 11 of 14
tionnaire score that is required to reflect a true change beyond the measurement error of
the questionnaire when used for repeated measurements [ 37]. However, the MDC should
be differentiated from minimally important change (MIC), which represents changes in
questionnaire scores which are considered to be minimally important by healthcare profes-
sionals and patients [ 47]. In other words, the changes in questionnaire scores exceeding the
MDC reported in this study indicate true changes in the scores but they do not necessarily
represent a clinically relevant change. Future studies should assess the MIC values for the
SSSQ2, for which anchor-based methods can be used [ 48]. For instance, a global rating of
change [ 49] can be used to assess patients’ and clinicians’ views with regard to whether the
severity of sound sensitivity has got worse, better or stayed the same and to quantify the
magnitude of that change following a treatment. The global rating of change can be used
as the anchor to assess which changes on the score of the SSSQ2 corresponds with a MIC
defined on the anchor.
As the data collection in this study was via an online survey, hearing thresholds
and uncomfortable loudness levels (ULLs) were not measured. This is a limitation of
the data, as they were solely dependent on self-report measures. Future studies should
compare pure-tone hearing thresholds and ULLs among participants with different forms
of sound sensitivity as measured via the SSSQ2. Another limitation is that the study
population was largely non-clinical, hence the performance of the SSSQ2 when used for
assessing patients seeking help for sound sensitivities require more research in a clinical
population. The first version of the SSSQ has shown good internal consistency when tested
in a clinical population [ 23], however, as the SSSQ2 has an additional item, a reassessment
of its psychometric properties in a clinical population is required.
5. Conclusions
The total SSSQ2 score can be used in day-to-day clinical practice or research settings
to measure the severity of general sound sensitivity as a one-factor questionnaire (based
on the results of the CFA) with acceptable internal consistency (based on the values of
Cronbach’s αand McDonald’s ω). The test–retest reliability of the SSSQ2 is good based on
ICC analysis. The total SSSQ2 score ranges between 0 and 18. The minimum change that
reflects a true change in SSSQ2 total scores is a change of five points or more based on the
value of MDC. Future research should determine the amount of change in SSSQ2 scores
that can constitute as a clinically important change following a treatment. The SSSQ2 can
be used a checklist to screen for various forms of sound sensitivity comprising: loudness
hyperacusis (sum of items 1 and 2), pain hyperacusis (item 2), misophonia (item 4), fear
hyperacusis (item 5), and noise sensitivity (item 6). The test–retest reliability of the single
items is moderate (less than that of the total SSSQ2 score), so their scores for screening of
different forms of sound sensitivity should be interpreted with caution. The SSSQ2 and its
items have shown good convergent and discriminant validity.
