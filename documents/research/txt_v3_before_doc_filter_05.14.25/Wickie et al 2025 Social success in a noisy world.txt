SOCIAL SUCCESS IN A NOISY WORLD:  
 EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN DECREASED SOUND TOLERANCE AND 
SOCIAL PROFILES

Abstract  
Humans are inherently social creatures, yet considerable variability exists in our social 
behaviours. It is unclear what factors contribute to this variability. Given the complex and 
abundant sensory stimuli present in our daily environments, differences i n sensory processing 
abilities may contribute to the variation observed in social behaviours. Individual differences in 
sensory processing may have significant effects on an individual's capacity to navigate social 
settings and may influence  the development and expression of social competence. In this study, 
we investigated the relationship between one form of sensory processing difference, Decreased 
Sound Tolerance (DST), and social competence. Existing literature suggests that it is common 
for individuals with DST to engage in social avoidance behaviours to mitigate exposure to 
distressing sounds. However, limited research explores the potential relationship between DST 
severity and social competence. As such, a sample of 2095 undergraduate students completed an 
online survey designed to assess their DST severity and social competence. Initially, to parse the 
variability in social competence, scores on the multidimensional social competence scale 
(MSCS), underwent a k -means clus ter analysis. This analysis yielded four unique social profiles 
based on seven social competence domains (e.g., social motivation, emotion regulation etc.). 
Misophonia and hyperacusis questionnaires were then used to evaluate differences in DST across 
the social profiles. The results indicated varying severity levels of both misophonia and 
hyperacusis across the four social profiles, with the individuals who reported the highest social 
competence exhibiting the lowest levels of DST. These findings highlight  the potential 
relationship between sensory processing differences, such as DST, and social functioning.

Introduction  
Social interactions play a pivotal role in our everyday experiences as humans. Social 
characteristics and behaviours like empathy, assertiveness , self -monitoring, and sociability can 
influence the quality of social interactions (Riggio, 1986). However, social abilities are 
extremely variable across individuals, and limited information is known about the factors that 
contribute to the heterogeneity  in the development and expression of social competence. Sensory 
processing differences  have been demonstrated t o be predictive of social abilities in  both autistic 
(Hilton et  al., 2007; Kose et al., 2023; Scheerer et al., 2021) and non -autistic  (Kose et al., 2023)  
individuals . As such, these predictive relationships suggest that sensory processing differences 
may be a potential factor contributing to individual differences in social abilities. The aim of th is 
current research is to parse the variability in social abilities by modelling social profiles. By 
comparing decreased sound tolerance (DST), a common sensory processing challenge, across 
these social profiles, we may gain further insight into the relations between sensory and social 
processing.  
DST is broadly defined as a reduced tolerance of everyday sounds (Williams et al., 2021; 
Cash, 2015). Two common subtypes of DST are misophonia and hyperacusis. Misophonia is 
characterized by strong negative emotional, physiological, and behavioural respon ses to “trigger” 
sounds that are not observed in most  people (Swedo et al., 2022). Hyperacusis , on the other 
hand, is a reduced tolerance to sound(s) at levels that are not bothersome  to the majority of other 
people (Adams et al., 2020). DST  has been linked to  functional impairments. Specifically, across 
both child (Scheerer et al., 2021) and adult (Dixon et al., 2024; Scheerer et al., 2024; Williams et 
al., 2021) samples , DST has been shown to negatively influence one’s ability to participate in 
activities at home, at school, and in the community. Further, DST has been associated with 
increased anxiety and depression and a reduced quality of life (Cash, 2015;  Yilmaz et al., 2017; 
Scheerer et al., 2024 ). Information regarding the prevalence and  individual differences that are 
predictive of DST  are only beginning to emerge. D ST has been demonstrated to be more likely 
to occur in individuals affected by tinnitus (Cash, 2015). DST is also commonly present in 
autistic individuals and is often the most prevalent and disabling sensory characteristic of autism 
(Williams et al., 2021 ). Additionally, a recent misophonia prevalence study has suggested 
that females, along with younger individuals (under 55 years of a ge), those with less than a high 
school education, those who never married, and those with lower income experience more severe  
misophonia symptoms (Dixon et al., 2024). Evidence has also suggested that chronic  misophonia 
symptoms surfacing in childhood and adolescence continue  into adulthood (Dixon et al., 2024).  
Given that DST has been linked to the avoidance of social environments, it is possible that the 
social avoidance caused by DST may influence  the development and expression of social 
competence .  
The heterogeneity in the development and expression of social skills across individuals 
can complicate the investigation of relations between social processing differences and other  
potentially  related factors, such as sensory processing  abilities . One way to circumvent  this, is to

parse the variability in social  skills by creating social profiles. The id entification of social 
profiles  has functional and clinical applications . If patterns of social abilities reliably co -occur  
across individuals , these profiles may facilitate the identification of other characteristics that tend 
to co -occur with these different  social profiles . For example, individuals with a particular social 
profile may tend to have more extreme sensory processing differences or a greater likel ihood of 
having or developing DST. Therefore, the first aim of the current study is to parse the social 
competence heterogeneity to investigate whether  patterns of social abilities exist within a large 
sample of adults. The Multidimensional Social Competence Scale (MSCS) was developed to be 
used as a standardized measure of social abilities  (Yager & Iarocci, 2013). The MSCS includes 
seven distinct social competence domains , includ ing social motivation (SM), social inferencing 
(SI), demonstrating empathic concern (DEM), social knowledge (SK), verbal conversation skills 
(VCS), nonverbal sen ding skills (NSS), and emotion regulation (ER; Yager & Iarocci, 2013 ; 
Trevisan et al.,  2018 ). The MSCS was developed initially  to assess the variability in social 
expression and the severity of social challenges demonstrated by autistic individuals, as social 
difficulties were highlighted as the most distinctive and defining characteristic of autism . 
However , extreme variability in social abilities is witnessed across the autism spectrum (Yager & 
Iarocci, 2013 ). The 2013 study developed a parent -report version of the MSCS for assessing 
adolescents ( Yager & Iarocci, 2013 ). However,  more recently, a psychometric evaluation of the 
MSCS for young adults was conducted to validate the self -report version of the MSCS for both 
autistic and non -autistic adults ( Trevisan et al., 2018 ). This validation provides  significant 
support for the  reliability of the self-report version of the MSCS for both autistic and non -autistic 
individuals.  
As previous links have been established between social and sensory processing ( Hilton et 
al., 2007; Kose et al., 2023; Scheerer et al., 2021)  and DST has been shown to promote social 
avoidance, the second aim of the current study was to investigate a potential relationship 
between DST and social competence . To this end, the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ ; 
Rosenthal et al., 2021)  and the Inventory of Hyperacusis (IHS; Greenberg & Carlos, 2018) were 
used to evaluate misophonia and hyperacusis, respectively. The  DMQ was developed to 
thoroughly assess the severity, negative impact, and methods of coping with misophonia 
(Rosenthal et al., 2021), while the inventory of hyperacusis symptoms (IHS) scale was developed 
to evaluate the presence and severity of hyperacusis symptoms  (Greenberg & Carlos, 2018). By 
comparing these measures across MSCS social profiles  it was possible to explore relations 
between DST severity and social competence. It was expected that increased DST symptom 
severity would be associated with social profiles characterized by increased social difficulties. 
Given neither misophonia  nor hyperacusis  are currently recognized by the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -5 TR; A merican Psychiatry Association , 2022 ), 
despite their significant levels of impairment , identifying relations  between DST and social 
competence  may help to better define the broader consequences of DST beyond intolerance to 
sound. As such, this research may help to emphasize the need to support individuals with DST in

providing accommodations and mitigating  the adverse effects of DST o n social competence 
development and expression.

Materials  
Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ)

The DMQ ( Rosenthal et al., 2021) is an 86 -item questionnaire used to measure 
misophonia severity across nine subscales. Responses are made using a Likert scale that ranges 
from 0 (“Never”) to 4 (“Always/Almost Always”). The DMQ yields a Symptom Severity 
Composite S core and a Coping Composite Score, comprised of the subscales: Trigger 
Frequency, Affective Responses, Physiological Responses, Cognitive Responses, Coping Before 
(triggered), Coping During (triggered), Coping After (triggered), Impairment, and Beliefs. The 
Symptom Severity Composite Score is a combination of subscales measuring cognitive, 
affective, and physiological responses across 23 items to measure overall symptom severity. This 
composite measures how often participants thought/felt/responded in a p articular manner when 
exposed to trigger sounds (e.g., “I want to cry”, “I felt hostile”, “My heart pounded or raced”, 
respectively). Higher Symptom Severity Composite scores indicated more severe symptoms 
were experienced when exposed to trigger sounds. A dditionally, the 21 -item Coping Composite 
Score measures coping before, during, and after exposure to trigger sounds. Various items were 
used to measure coping prior (e.g. “I used a different sound to drown out bothersome sounds”), 
during (e.g. “I produced  an alternate sound”), and after (e.g. “I listened to a comforting sound”) 
exposure to trigger sounds. Higher Coping Composite scores indicated a greater use of coping 
strategies and more effective coping skills overall. The  DMQ has good marginal reliability for 
both coping composite score and symptom severity score (p xx = 0.9 3; pxx = 0.93;  Rosenthal et al., 
2021 ). Additionally,  high correlations were found between the Misophonia Assessment 
Questionnaire ( MAQ), Misophonia Emotional Response Scale (MER), Misophonia Coping 
Responses Survey (MCR), and the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A -MISO -S) and the DMQ 
Symptom composite score (r scores ranging from r = 0.72 to r = 0.8 1), and these correlations 
between the DMQ Symptoms scale and already existing measures were used to determine 
preliminary convergent validity for the DMQ Symptoms Severity Composite Score (R osenthal et 
al., 2021).  DMQ Symptom Severity scale scores also demonstrated a good ability to differentiate 
between clinical and subclinical thresholds of misophonia ( AUC  = 0.82, 95% CI [0.77 -0.87] ; 
Rosenthal et al., 2021 ). Cronbach’s alpha for the current study indicates reliability was excellent 
α = 0.98 . 
Inventory of Hyperacusis Symptoms (IHS) Scale  
The IHS (Greenberg & Carlos, 2018) is a 25 -item questionnaire used to measure 
hyperacusis severity, assessing loudness perception, negative emotions, fear, cognitive, social, 
occupational, and psychological functioning, as well as quality of life and menta l health. The 
response options are on a 4 -point Likert scale ranging from 1 (“Not at all”) to 4 (“Very much 
so”). The items measure the frequency/intensity of experiences (e.g. “I find the challenges of 
being exposed to loud sounds can make it difficult to  do the things I used to enjoy”) when 
exposed to trigger sounds. The IHS is scored out of 100, where higher total scores indicate 
greater severity of hyperacusis symptoms . The IHS was developed and validated using a sample 
of 324 non -autistic adults with varying levels of auditory sensitivity. In the original introduction 
to the IHS,  a clinical cutoff score of 75 was used  (Greenberg & Carlos, 2018) , however, a more

recent study was conducted assessing the internal consistency and convergent validity of the IHS 
in a clinical population (Aazh & Moore, 2021) . This recent  study suggest ed that a cutoff score of 
56 yielded more accurate results for classifying patients correctly. Therefore , for the current 
paper we used a cutoff score of 56 or greater  to indicate clinical levels of hyperacusis severity. 
The IHS has high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.93; Greenberg & Carlos, 2018 ; 
Cronbach’s α = 0.96, current study ) as well as significant convergence with measures of mental 
health and well -being, specifically the Patient Health Questionnaire -4 (PHQ -4) and the World 
Health Organization Brief Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL -BRIEF; Scheerer et al., 2024). 
Overall, the IHS has excellent  reliability ( α = 0.93 ; Greenberg & Carlos, 2018 ). In the current 
study the Cronbach’s  alpha for the IHS also indicates excellent reliability  α = 0.96.  
Multidimensional Social Competence Scale (MSCS)  
The MSCS ( Trevisan et al., 2018 ) is a 77 -item questionnaire used to measure social 
competence. The MSCS uses a 5 -point Likert scale, and response options for each item range 
from 1 (“Not True/Almost Never True”) to 5 (“Very True/Almost Always True”). The items on 
the MSCS assess social competence across seven subscales, including social motivation (e.g. “I 
prefer to spend time alone”), social inferencing (e.g. “I recognize when people are trying to take 
advantage of me”), demonstrating empathic concern (e.g. “I am sensitive to the fe elings and 
concerns of others”), social knowledge (e.g. “I know about the latest trends for my age”), verbal 
conversation skills (e.g. “I dominate conversations so that it can be hard for others to get a word 
in”), nonverbal sending skills (e.g. “My facial  expressions seem ‘flat’”), and emotion regulation 
(e.g. “I have ‘meltdowns’”). As such, the MSCS allows individual differences in social 
competence, as well as more specific strengths and challenges related to one’s social abilities  to 
be identified. High er MSCS scores across the seven domains and  a higher MSCS total score 
indicate  greater social competence . Among a sample of adults, the MSCS was previously found 
to have good  internal consistency and reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0. 80; Trevisan et al., 2018). In 
the current study the MSCS was found to have excellent  reliability α = 0.9 4. 
Procedure  
Participants were recruited over an 8 -month period from Wilfrid Laurier University’s 
research participation system and the survey was administered online via Qualtrics. Following 
informed consent, participants completed a survey that collected demographic information (e.g. 
birth date, gender, ethnicity, etc.), followed by a se ries of questionnaires, including the Beck 
Depression Inventory (BDI ; Beck et al., 1961 ), Duke -Vanderbilt Misophonia Screening 
Questionnaire (DVM SQ; Williams et al., 2022 ), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI ; Beck et al., 
1988 ), Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ ; Wu et al., 2014 ), Adult/Adolescent Sensory Profile 
(AASP ; Brown & Dunn, 2002 ), Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ ; Baron -Cohen et al., 2001 ), 
Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ), Inventory of Hyperacusis Symptoms (IHS), and the 
Multidimensional Social Competence Scale (MSCS). However, for the purpose of this study, 
only the data from the MSCS, DMQ, and IHS will be reported as they align most closely wit h

our research objectives . The remaining data, while informative, are outside the scope of the 
current analyses and will be addressed in future manuscripts. After completion of the survey, 
participants were then debriefed and compensated for their participation with course credit.  
Data Analysis  
The data were analyzed using Jamovi  (The Jamovi Project , 2024 ), the Statistical Package 
for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software – version 28  (IBM, 2023) , and R Statistical Computing 
software  (R Core Team, 2023) .  
First, participants' MSCS subscale scores were converted to z -scores and subjected to a k -
means cluster analys es to identify patterns of social abilities. A cluster analysis is an exploratory 
data analysis technique that can be used to identify subgroups (or clusters) in a dataset that 
represent participants that are like one another, but distinct from other partic ipants in other 
clusters. With a k -means cluster analysis, the algorithm groups the participants into a predefined 
number (k) of non -overlapping clusters. Here, participants were assigned to a particular cluster in 
such a way that the sum of the squared distance between all of the participants MSCS scores, and 
the mean of all participants’ MSCS scores that belong to a particular cluster, was minimi zed 
(Hartigan & Wong, 1979). Using this approach with the MSCS data allowed us to examine how 
social abilities cluster together, with each of the resulting clusters representing a distinct social 
profile . To determine the best fit model, we used Bayesian I nformation Criteria ( BIC; Zhong & 
Ghosh, 2003), and consider ed the unique explanatory power provided by each solution such that 
redundancies across clusters were minimized. Combining BIC with subjective assessment 
balanced the statistical fit of the models with their potential to have practical, real -world 
significance.  
Second, a comparison of the DMQ symptom severity composite scores, DMQ coping 
composite scores, and IHS total scores was conducted across the resultant social competence 
profiles via a one -way analysis of variance (ANOVA ). The DMQ symptom severity composite 
scores, the DMQ coping composite scores, and the IHS total scores  were treated as  three distinct 
dependent variables,  and the independent  variable  was the social profiles identified through the 
cluster analysis. The purpose of this ANOVA was to determine whether DMQ severity, DMQ 
coping, and IHS total scores were significantly different across the social competence profiles. 
Games -Howell post -hoc analyses  were used to determine how DST severity varied across the 
social profiles.  
Given the large sample size used in this study, effect sizes of partial eta -square (𝜂𝑝2 > 
0.06), Cohen’s d ≥ 0.20 Cramer’s V > 0. 20 and McFadden R2 > 0.20, were  used as the threshold 
for all statistical analyses as these represent the cutoffs for moderate effects. As such, anything 
above this value should indicate a meaningful effect (Cohen, 1994; Lang et al., 1998; Sullivan & 
Feinn, 2012; Scheerer et al., 2024; Tomczak et al., 2014).  
Results  
Cluster Analysis: Patterns of Social Competence

Results of the k -means cluster analys es indicated that a four -cluster solution produced the 
best fit after considering BIC values (see Supplemental Materials) and the unique explanatory 
power of the social profiles . The first analysis used a k of 2. The two -cluster solution 
differentiated those with high social competence from those with low social competence, relative 
to the group mean (see  Figure 1 .). With the addition of a third cluster, a group marked with 
difficulties with Verbal  Conversation Skills and Emotional Regulation emerged. Upon the 
addition of a fourth cluster, we observed a group with highly adaptive Verbal Conversation 
Skills and Emotional Regulation, but relative difficulties with Social Motivation, Demonstrating 
Empa thic Concern, and Non-Verbal Sending Skills. With the addition of each cluster, the model 
produced a new social profile that highlighted a distinct pattern of social competence. However, 
once the five -cluster solution emerged, the new cluster did not produce a highly differentiated 
pattern of social competence. As such, the k 4 cluster solution was selected (see Figure 1). 
Cluster One was classified as a socially adaptive (SA) profile, cluster two as a generalized social 
differences (GSD) profile, cluster three as a verbal and emotional regulation differences (VER) 
profile, and cluster four as a verbal and emotional regulati on adaptive (VEA) profile.

Figure 1.  Social competence profiles  based on z -scores across the k 2 -5 cluster solutions. 
Negative z -scores indicate increased social difficulties, and the line weights between cluster 
solutions represent the number of participants changing clusters across the different solutions.  
One-way ANOVAs were conducted on the MSCS sub -scale scores  (z-scores: see Fig. 1, 
raw scores: see Fig. 2)  using J AMOVI  to examine if the MSCS subscales varied across the four 
profiles . A main effect of social profile indicated that all seven subscales : social motivation, 
social intelligence, displaying empathic concern, social knowledge, verbal conversation skills,

nonverbal sending skills, and emotion regulation differed significantly across the four social 
profiles  (𝜂𝑝2 > 0.06). Post ho c tests indicate that MSCS subscales varied across each  social 
profile,  except, social knowledge w hich was not significantly different between the VER and 
VEA social profiles  (d < 0.2), and both verbal conversation skills and emotion regulation which 
were not significantly different between GSD and VER social profiles (d < 0.2; (see Fig. 2).

gender identity and social profile (see supplemental materials ). In profile SA there w ere proportionately 
more  females relative to males and other specified genders (i.e. other, prefer not to say, transgender, 
nonbinary, I don’t know, gender fluid  and gender binary ). In the GSD profile , there  were 
proportionately more males and genders not otherwise specified relative to females. The VER social 
profile had proportionately more females and fewer  males, and lastly the VEA social profile had 
proportionately more males than females and genders not otherwise specified.

that DMQ coping composite scores were significantly different across all social profiles except SA and 
VEA, and GSD and VER profiles based on effect size ( d > 0.2).  
Additionally, to further assess the relationship between DST and the social profiles we analyzed 
the distribution of individuals who met the clinical cutoff (n = 378) on the DMQ across the social 
profiles. We found a proportionately greater number of indiv iduals with clinically severe misophonia 
were classified by  the GSD  and VER social profiles. In comparison, individuals who did not meet the 
cutoff for clinically significant misophonia were more often classified by the SA and VE A social 
profiles. These results are consistent with our findings that individuals with lower severity scores of 
DST, are categorized in the social profiles with the higher  mean social competence scores  (i.e., SA and 
VEA profiles).

Discussion  
There are many factors that contribute to the development and expression of social competence. 
The first aim of the current study was to determine whether patterns of social processing abilities 
and/or difficulties tend to co -occur across individuals, allowing social profiles to be established . The 
second aim was to examine whether DST  severity  varied as a function of these social profiles to 
determine  whether DST may be related to social competence development and expression.  
Social Profiles

Using k-means cluster analys es, we identif ied four unique social profiles  that parsed variability 
in social strengths and challenges across seven social competence domains . The first social profile , 
identified is a socially adaptive profile (SA ), describe s individuals who demonstrate strengths across all 
seven social competence domains . The second social profile , a generalized social differences profile 
(GSD ), consist s of individuals who experience challenges across all seven social domains measured. 
The SA and GSD profiles represent the opposite extremes of social processing abilities and highlight 
the fact that there are large indi vidual differences in social abilities, even amongst a sample of 
undergraduate university students. Two additional intermediate profiles were identified, further 
highlighting the heterogeneity in social processing abilities. The third social profile , the verbal and 
emotion regulation differences  profile  (VER ), consist s of people who appear to have  distinct challenges 
with verbal conversation skills and emotion regulation . Finally, the fourth social profile , the verbal and 
emotion regulation adaptive profile (VEA ), contains  individuals with social motivation, empathy, and 
non-verbal communication difficulties, but markedly strong verbal conversation skills and emotion 
regulation abilities .  
A closer look at the intermediate profiles, VEA and VER, highlights the benefit of this social 
profile approach to understanding variability in social abilities. Individuals characterized by the VEA 
and VER profiles had similar total scores on the MSCS , yet these individuals have very different 
abilities to demonstrate empathetic concern, communicate verbally and regulate their emotions. 
Without taking t his more nuanced approach, these differences may be overlooked, missing the 
opportunity to target more specific social strengths and weaknesses. These  four social profiles allow for 
a more comprehensive depiction of individuals ’ social abilities  and may support more tailored 
approaches to social skills support .  
To further characterize the individuals described by these four social profiles, we examined 
potential differences in demographic characteristics across the profiles. Age was not found to vary 
across the profiles, although this was not particularly surprising given the sample was undergraduate 
students . Upon examination of the distribution of gender across the social profiles, the SA and VER 
profiles tended to have proportionately more females, while males were more common in the VEA 
profile, and both males  and gender not otherwise specific participants were relatively more frequently 
classified by the GSD profile. This suggest s that gender may also play a role in shaping an individual’s 
social abilities , contributing to an individual's social profile . Future research should  further investigate 
the relationship between social abilities and gender identity as there may be significant societal 
implications for better understanding the interplay between social profile and gender identity.  
Relating Social Profiles to DST Characteristics  
Relations between social and sensory processing have been previously established ( Hilton et al., 
2007; Kose et al., 2023; Scheerer et al., 2021 ), and DST has been shown to promote social avoidance  
(Scheerer et al., 2021; Smees et al., 2024; Blaesing & Kroener -Herwig, 2012 ), thus the second aim of 
the current  study was to investigate a potential relationship between DST symptoms  and social 
competence. Both m isophonia symptom severity and coping abilities , as well as hyperacusis severity

were found to vary across the four social profiles.  Notably, people characterized by the SA profile, 
those with the most adaptive social abilities, also had the fewest DST symptoms . The highest levels of 
DST  symptoms  were found in those  classified by the GSD and VER social profiles . As those classified 
by the GSD and VER social profiles had the lowest total social competence scores, this suggests an 
association  between higher DST severity and lower social competence.  These findings are in line with 
previous work that suggests sensory processing differences have a significant influence on the variation 
and expression of social abilities (Scheerer et al., 2021; Yager & Iarocci, 2013). However, the goal of 
the current wor k was to go beyond comparing DST symptoms to global differences in social abilities. 
As such, considering the commonalities amongst the GSD and VER s ocial profiles, verbal conversation 
skills and emotion regulation  are the notable difficulties across both profiles. Thus,  this work builds on 
previous associations between sensory and social processing by describing a more specific relation 
between DST and differences in verbal conversation skills and emotional regulation.  
Misophonia and hyperacusis have been described as independent  DST conditions (Williams et 
al., 2021) . However, in  our current study, DMQ and IHS  scores showed similar  patterns of severity 
across the established social profiles.  It is possible that despite unique underlying physiological 
mechanisms, misophonia and hyperacusis  may have similar effects on the development and expression 
of social behaviours. For example, both misophonia and hyperacusis are thought to promote avoidance 
of environments with potentially triggering and/ or distressing sounds  (Scheerer et al., 2021 ; Smees et 
al., 2024 ; Blaesing & Kroener -Herwig, 2012). Given many social environments (e.g., parks, 
restaurants, movie theatres, etc.) are sensory rich, both misophonia and hyperacusis are likely to impact  
social experiences in a similar manner. Further, many people with misophonia and hyperacusis use 
noise cancelling devices (e.g., headphones, ear plugs, etc.) to block out potentially trigger ing sounds  
(Scheerer et al., 2024; Wunrow, 2024 ) While this strategy may help individuals avoid sound triggers, it 
also limits exposure to sounds in general , including an important social sound, speech . This reduced 
social contact and speech exposure, respectively, may underlie differences in the development and 
expression of verbal conversation skills. Similarly, both misophonia and hyperacusis have been 
reported to evoke strong emotional responses ( Scheerer et al., 2021,  Aazh et al., 2019;  Henry et al., 
2022 ). As such, it is possible that the heightened sensitivity to sounds creates additional challenges for 
emotional regulation  with the intense emotional responses induced.  Thus, the relations between DST 
and social competence may be driven by more generalized neurological sensory processing differences 
rather than condition -specific difficulties. This finding is important, as it suggests that even if 
misophonia and hyperacusis have different aetiologies , they may share similar responses and coping 
mechanisms  and as a result they may have  similar relations to other affected functions like social 
development and expression.  
The relationship between DST and social competence suggests  that those affected by DST may 
have poorer social outcomes. Given social functioning plays such an integral part of our lives as 
humans,  this could have further downstream effects on things like academic outcomes, job success, 
mental health, and many other behaviours that may rely on social competence ( Smith et al., 2023 ; 
Seeber & Wittmann , 2017; Romppanen et al., 2021; Tabassum &  Iqbal, 2020) . Therefore, further

research to explore this relationship between DST and social functioning is essential to help mitigate 
the adverse effects  of this relationship , support individuals with DST,  and provide accommodations .  
With regards to post -secondary environments, sensory differences can create significant barriers 
to socialization, academic success , and housing s atisfaction  while students are away at school  (Dwyer 
et al., 2023) . However, finding the right accommodations for those with DST may be difficult, because 
if designed incorrectly, accommodations  that support sensory differences may also potentially 
negatively influence social outcomes. A recent publication written by a group of neurodivergent 
undergraduate and graduate students, along with alumni and parent allies, suggests recommendations 
for accommodations and promoting inclusion for neurodiverse students, staff and facult y in post -
secondary institutions, particularly with regards to their sensory differences (Dwyer et al., 2023). While 
the respondents in th e current  study were not all neurodivergent, given many of the recommendations  
by Dwyer and colleagues (2023)  focused on supporting  sensory differences , they are quite relevant to 
the current discussion. As such, it was recommended that  students should have access to spaces free 
from overwhelming sensory information. For example, offering  students the option of a  single roo m 
with no roommates in a building with strict noise regulations would be particularly beneficial to  
students with sensory difficulties , including DST . Although not having a roommate may reduce social 
contact, having a sensory -safe environment  to decompress may reduce overall levels of distress, 
allowing those with DST  to engage in other social engagements/ environments.  Another 
recommendation specifically relevant to DST is within dining halls. Dining areas expose students to 
various sounds and foods that may be very triggering to individuals with sensory differences , especially 
those with misophonia (Swedo et al., 2022) . As such, alternatives to sensory -aversive foods  should be 
present for individuals, providing many sensory -safe meal options  (Dwyer et al., 2023) . Additionally, 
outdoor eating spaces  allow students  to take food outside to avoid exposure to trigger sounds . This may 
alleviate distress created by  eating /food-related  triggers, but more importantly, ensure that students are 
not experienc ing malnutrition due to reduce d access ibility in  dining facilities. Specific to academic 
outcomes, triggering noises/ noise levels have the p otential to  influence information retention during 
lectures and  performance during quizzes and exams for students with sensory differences. Even 
everyday noise sources  like air condition ers or lights can have adverse effects on academic outcomes 
for those with DST. Therefore, for the success of individuals with sensory differences,  having c arefully 
designed and engineered spaces where these distractions are reduced  is imperative (Dwyer et al., 2023) , 
particularly so that students can attend classes and interact with peers without experiencing high levels 
of distress . 
The relations between higher levels of DST and poorer social competence revealed  in the 
current study emphasize  the need to focus  on finding and prioritizing accommodations to support 
individuals who suffer from DST  so that they can thrive and achieve their personal, academic , and 
occupational goals . Recently , efforts to develop consensus definitions of misophonia (Swedo et al., 
2022) and hyperacusis ( Adams et al., 2021 ), as well as  to develop validated diagnostic tools (Rosen thal 
et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2022 ; Carson et al., 2023)  have rapidly accelerated research on DST. 
However, future research needs to continue to leverage this information and these tools to better

understand how DST develops, changes throughout the lifespan, and influences other aspects of 
functioning  (Carson  et al., 2023; Williams et al., 2022) . In time , we may develop solutions to help 
mitigate the adverse  effects of DST , including finding ways to reduce avoidance behaviours, 
withdrawal from social participation, and ideally improve overall well -being  for those with DST  
Limitations  
It is essential  to recognize the limitations of any research study. The results of this study were based 
on subjective self -report measures of social competence, misophonia and hyperacusis. This may have 
limited the objectivity and reliability of the data, as well as int roduced bias to the responses as 
individuals may lack self -awareness or may misinterpret items on the questionnaires. Additionally, our 
sample consisted of university students in Southern Ontario, which limits the generalizability as the 
sample consists of a largely homogenous group of young adults, most of whom do not have clinically 
severe DST.  There was also an uneven gender distribution in our sample, as there were more female 
participants than any other gender . Thus, although we report gender differences across our social 
profiles, further work with more gender -balanced samples is required to validate these findings.  
Additionally, when conducting a k means cluster analysis, it is typical that the k cluster solution 
chosen has the lowest BIC value. However, in the current study we did not use the k cluster solution 
with the lowest BIC value. The four -cluster model was selected as it was more interpretable regarding 
the clusters themselves with the data. The four-cluster  model produced more visually distinguishable 
social profiles than the five -cluster solution. Additionally, an elbow point was found on the graph of the 
BIC values, which depicts a slowed rate of improvement starting with the four -cluster solution, 
meaning that there was not a large difference between the k 4 and k 5 BIC values. This meant that the 
five-cluster solution provided only a slightly better statistical model yet a less visually interpretable 
one.  
Conclusion  
Overall, our results demonstrate a significant relationship between DST and social competence, 
with individuals with more severe DST demonstrating lower total social competence scores. However , 
the social profiles from our cluster analyses  provided more insight into the specific challenges 
individuals with more severe DST may face. A greater number of individuals with higher severity 
scores of DST were in the GSD and VER social profiles . Challenges with verbal conversation skills 
and emotion regulation char acterize these social profiles , which  may allude to  specific challenges with 
social competence development and expression due to  DST . These results  also emphasize the need to 
support individuals with DST , as these results suggest that DST may have adverse downstream effects 
on social abilities .
