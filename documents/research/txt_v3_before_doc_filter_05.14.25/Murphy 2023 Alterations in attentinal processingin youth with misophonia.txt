Hypervigilance ABSTRACT  
Background: Misophonia is a complex condition characterized by extreme emotional distress in response to 
specific sounds or specific visual stimuli. Despite a growing body of clinical and neuroscientific literature, the 
etiology of this condition remains unclear. Hyperarousal, that is, a state of heightened alertness and disinhibi -
tion, as a core feature of misophonia is supported by behavioral and neuroimaging literature and might represent 
a viable clinical target for the development of both behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The aim of 
this study was to investigate how hyperarousal might be linked to neurocognitive processes associated with 
vigilance and stimulus discrimination in youth with misophonia. 
Methods: We compared 72 children and adolescents with misophonia (13.74 ±2.44 years) (64 % female) and 89 
children and adolescents with anxiety (12.35 ±2.57 years) (58.4 % female) on behavioral and signal detection 
performance of the immediate memory task (IMT). Anxiety patients were used as a clinical control group to 
distinguish attentional processes specific for misophonia. 
Results: Both groups demonstrated similar behavioral performance, including response rate and reaction time. 
However, misophonia was associated with elevated stimulus discrimination (d prime), which in turn was posi-
tively correlated with the severity of misophonia trigger reports. 
Conclusions: Our findings are in line with previous cognitive and neuroimaging studies, and support an arousal- 
based model of misophonia, where individuals with misophonia experience a state of heightened vigilance, being 
more aware of stimuli in the environment. Our findings provide a neurocognitive basis for future study of 
neurochemical imaging that might further progress towards clinical targets.   
1.Introduction 
Misophonia is a poorly characterized yet debilitating illness char-
acterized by extreme physiological, behavioral, and emotional reactions 
to specific sounds or visual stimuli (Cervin et al., 2023 ; Guzick et al., 
2023 ; Jager et al., 2020 ). Trigger sounds are common sounds generated 
by other people during processes such as breathing, eating, or moving. 
These can include chewing, rasping or rattling of breath during 
breathing, clicking or tapping of fingers/joints, or interaction with me-
chanical objects that results in clicking, tapping, crunching sounds. The etiology of misophonia is poorly understood, however, the presentation 
is distinct from sensory conditions such as hyperacusis and phonopho -
bia, which refer to sound level specific reactions and general fear re-
sponses respectively (Jager et al., 2020 ; Swedo et al., 2022 ). Misophonia 
often causes great distress to affected individuals and their families, with 
detrimental effects on quality of life and everyday functioning (Guzick 
et al., 2023 ). Misophonia typically onset during childhood or adoles -
cence, but the mechanisms of its prodromal development and subse -
quent maintenance remain unknown. This adds to the confusion of how 
to best classify misophonia and making it unclear if this is best

430conceptualized as a psychological, neurological, or audiological condi -
tion. Accordingly, no pharmacological intervention is currently avail-
able to alleviate misophonia symptoms, and psychological treatments 
(e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) are just beginning to emerge 
(Rappoldt et al., 2023 ). A better understanding of the key neuro -
cognitive mechanisms involved in the onset and maintenance of miso-
phonia is needed to identify clinical targets and to design and 
personalize interventions. Our aim in this study is to identify affected 
elements of attentional processing that are distinct to misophonia in a 
youth population. 
Early studies of misophonia identified physiological responses such 
as heightened galvanic skin response (Edelstein et al., 2013 ), increased 
heart rate (Grossini et al., 2022 ), and muscular tension (Dozier et al., 
2020 ) in response to certain auditory stimuli. These responses imply the 
possibility of elevated vigilance of the autonomic nervous system. 
Changes to vigilance, even when temporary or contextual, can impair 
cognitive functions across neuropsychological domains, including 
working memory (Berryman et al., 2017 ; MacNamara et al., 2019 ), set- 
shifting (Coifman et al., 2018 ), and cognitive control (Crane et al., 
2016 ), which in turn can result in impaired social functioning and poor 
quality of life (Bar-Tal et al., 2013 ; Guzick et al., 2023 ; Rinaldi et al., 
2022 ). In misophonia, heightened vigilance in anticipation of miso-
phonic triggers would at least partially explain the altered sensitivity to 
sound stimuli, as well as the mood disturbances typical for the condition 
(Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ; Siepsiak et al., 
2022 ). 
Neuroimaging studies support the notion of a heightened state of 
vigilance in misophonia, pointing to altered attribution of processing 
resources within the salience network (Kumar et al., 2017 ; Schroder 
et al., 2019 ). Findings from multivariate functional imaging suggest that 
audio-visual misophonic trigger stimuli, but not generally aversive or 
neutral stimuli, may be associated with enhanced hemodynamic 
response in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and superior temporal 
cortex in individuals with misophonia relative to controls (Schroder 
et al., 2019 ). Moreover, these stimuli elicited intense feelings of disgust, 
anger, and sadness, emphasizing the distorted salience these stimuli 
hold in affected individuals. Individuals with misophonia, but not con-
trols, have also demonstrated elevated heart rate during both miso-
phonic and generally aversive conditions (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; 
Schroder et al., 2019 ). What the combination of these findings imply is 
that individuals affected by misophonia exhibit a heightened level of 
arousal that lowers the detection threshold for potentially aversive 
stimuli. This form of systemic biasing towards certain sensory stimuli 
can be observed by examining response inhibition with a modified 
Stroop task, where higher levels of vigilance make it easier for sensory 
stimuli to override cognitive processes (Daniels et al., 2020 ). In this 
instance, misophonic trigger sounds, but not universally unpleasant 
sounds, increased the Stroop effect in participants with higher trait 
anxiety (Daniels et al., 2020 ). 
The effect of symptom provocation on attentive processes is a key 
element in the hypervigilance/arousal model of misophonia etiology. 
However, the functional imaging data to date only present a macro-level 
picture of how this aspect of misophonia is organized. This was 
addressed by Frank et al. (2020) using a modified version of the 
Attention Network Task (ANT) designed to assess neurocognitive pro-
cesses associated with three independent attention networks: alerting 
attention, orienting attention, and executive attention (Frank et al., 
2020 ). Importantly, each of these attentional networks overlap with the 
circuits described by Schroder et al. (2019) and Kumar et al. (2017) . The 
authors identified differences between misophonia patients and controls 
in alerting attention while orienting and executive attention were not 
different between the groups. Alerting attention is related to neural 
activity in a network of frontal and parietal regions, which exhibits 
control over the initiation and maintenance of an attentive response 
(Posner and Petersen, 1990 ). To address the importance of sound pro-
cessing on attention components, the task had been modified to include misophonic sound presentations in certain blocks. Interestingly, there 
was no interaction with the sound condition, suggesting that the alter-
ations to alerting attention exist as part of broader alterations in atten -
tional processing, which is in line with previous functional imaging 
studies suggesting that misophonia is associated with an altered func-
tional state characterized by heightened levels of arousal. 
For understanding misophonia etiology, it is important to break 
down the manner in which hypervigilance impacts different cognitive 
domains and computational processes. In the ANT study, individuals 
with misophonia did not display difficulties related to orienting atten -
tion (Frank et al., 2020 ), a finding presumably at odds with behavioral 
traits observed in misophonia, for example, escape/avoidance behavior 
(Guzick et al., 2023 ), and strategic delaying of responses (Eijsker et al., 
2019 ). A promising avenue to further explore the computational prop-
erties of attention in misophonia is to use the Immediate Memory Task 
(IMT). The IMT was adapted from the Continuous Performance Task 
(CPT (Klee and Garfinkel, 1983 ), a task used to measure discriminability 
and impulsive regulation by contrasting correct detections with com-
mission errors (responses to non-target stimuli (Dougherty et al., 2003 )). 
In the IMT, the goal is to select if a cue and target stimulus (5 number 
sequence) match or not. Non-matching trials can be commission errors 
(1 digit different in the target stimulus), random errors (neither cue nor 
target match), or filler errors (cue and target are two halves of a ten-digit 
sequence). See Fig. 1 for a description of the task. This design distin -
guishes random and/or impulsive incorrect responses from incorrect 
anticipatory responses (commission errors), providing a more nuanced 
approach to estimating both response sensitivity and response bias (e.g., 
the cognitive strategy for response making) (Dougherty et al., 2000 ). 
Signal detection theory can be used to resolve the degree of response 
sensitivity and bias during the IMT (Dougherty et al., 2003, 2000 ; Pas-
tore and Scheirer, 1974 ) and might help to shed light upon cognitive 
processes related to orienting and executive attention in misophonia 
(Frank et al., 2020 ). 
Modeling of reaction times (RT) during the IMT is another approach 
that can help explain variability in the allocation of resources to atten -
tive processes. In particular, ex-Gaussian modeling of RTs, which ac-
counts for the non-parametric distribution of timings, has been shown to 
be a sensitive indicator of fluctuating attention (Schumacher et al., 
2019 ) (Schumacher et al., 2019 ). The ex-gaussian distribution has three 
components: mu, sigma, and tau, which represent the mean, standard 
deviation, and exponent respectively. Studies in attention deficit hy-
peractivity disorder (ADHD) (Galloway-Long and Huang-Pollock, 
2018 ), aging (Schumacher et al., 2019 ), and working memory (Shahar 
et al., 2014 ) have helped to provide a theoretical description of the ex- 
gaussian parameters. The gaussian parameters of mu and sigma relate to 
the general accuracy of performance, whereas the tau parameter relate 
to the allocation of resources and maintenance of task-appropriate 
attention (Ratcliff, 1979 ). Previous work has identified that dysfunc -
tional aging such as in dementia (Schumacher et al., 2019 ), and devel -
opmental difficulties with hyperactivity such as in ADHD (Galloway- 
Long and Huang-Pollock, 2018 ) are associated with larger tau compo -
nents in RT distributions, indicating less precise allocation of attentional 
resources. 
The aim of the present study is to explore attentional processes in 
children and adolescents with misophonia. To distinguish processes 
specific for misophonia, we will include a clinical comparison group of 
youth with anxiety disorders, another condition characterized by al-
terations in attentional processing (Pacheco-Unguetti et al., 2010 ), 
making it possible to distinguish mechanisms specific for misophonia. 
Based on the arousal model of misophonia described above, we hy-
pothesize that the ex-gaussian tau property of RT distributions might be 
a strong computational marker of misophonia pathology. We further 
hypothesize that if misophonia patients exhibit a functional difference 
that renders them in a hypervigilant state, they will have greater 
response sensitivity and a more liberal response bias. As an exploratory 
measure, we will examine response rates for different cue conditions and N. Murphy et al.

2.Methods 
2.1. Participants 
We drew data from a broader project that included 102 children and 
adolescents (13.69 ±2.51 years) (67.6 % female) who met the proposed 
diagnostic criteria for Misophonia and 94 children and adolescents with 
anxiety disorders (12.41 ±2.55 years) (57.4 % female). The complete 
demographic profiles of these samples have been previously described 
(Guzick et al., 2023 ). Using the completion of the online IMT task as an 
entry requirement for the present study, 72 misophonia (13.74 ±2.44 
years) (64 % female) and 89 anxiety patients (12.35 ±2.57 years) (58.4 
% female) were included in the IMT analysis. 
2.2. Immediate memory task 
In the IMT, we used 5-digit sequences of numbers as the cue and 
target stimuli (see Fig. 1). The objective of the task is to make a response 
using one of the two button options provided to indicate if the target 
stimulus was identical to the cue stimulus. Participants were presented 
with a fixation cross (1000 ms) followed by the cue stimulus (500 ms) 
and then the target stimulus (500 ms). After the target stimulus had 
disappeared, participants were presented with a blank screen (1000 ms). 
At the presentation of the target stimulus, participants could respond as 
to whether it matched (1) or not (0) the cue stimulus. The IMT consisted 
of 4 trial types: 1) Match: cue and target arrays were identical; 2) Catch: target array was different from the cue array by 1 digit (e.g., Cue 
46,781 and Target 46,782); 3) Random: target array and cue array 
were completely different (e.g., Cue 16,093 and Target 27,515); 4) 
Filler: cue and target array were two parts of a ten digit sequence (e.g., 
Cue 12,345 and Target 56,789). Trials were presented in a random 
order for each participant with an inter-stimulus interval of 500 ms 
preceding the end of the response period and the start of the next fixa-
tion period. Each condition consisted of N 25 trials for a total of N 
100 trials. A brief run of 11 practice trials were presented beforehand to 
reduce random error. The total experiment time was 5 min and 55 s. The 
experiment was created using Gorilla Experiment Builder (Anwyl-Irvine 
et al., 2021, 2018 ). 
2.3. Clinical and behavioral measures 
To evaluate the influence of self-reported symptom domains on task 
performance, we used the following clinical ratings to characterize: 1) 
Misophonia : the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S) (Cervin et al., 
2023 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ), the Misophonia Inventory of Sound Trig-
gers (MIST), a trigger list that was developed for this study, which was 
summed to create a total trigger count, the Misophonia Assessment 
Questionnaire (MAQ) (Cervin et al., 2023 ; Johnson and Dozier, 2013 ), 
and the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ) (Robertson and Sim-
mons, 2013 ); 2) Anxiety: the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Chil-
dren (MASC) (March, 1997 ), the Behavioral Inhibition-Activation Scales 
(BIS/BAS) (Carver and White, 1994 ); and 3) Other emotional symptoms 
and mechanisms : Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI-5) 
(Gadow and Sprafkin, 2013 ), Cognitive Emotion Regulation Question -
naire (CERQ) (Garnefski et al., 2001 ), Youth Self Report (YSR)

2.4. Pre-processing and feature extraction 
2.4.1. Response accuracy and signal detection 
The primary analysis of the IMT task involved extracting response 
accuracy and reaction times per condition. Response accuracy was used 
to the hit rate and false alarm rate that act as the base for estimating 
signal detection measures: Sensitivity (d prime, d′), bias (c). 
To estimate these measures, we first calculated the hit and false 
alarm rates for the IMT. Hit rate (HR) refers to the ratio of correct 
matches in the “Match ” condition (hit) to the total number of “Match ” 
trials (N). Similarly, the false alarm rate (FR) refers to the number of 
commission errors made relative to the total number of trials in the catch 
trials.

d′ was then measured as the difference between the normalized HR and 
FR, where normalization was performed by estimating the percent point 
function. C was estimated as the product of  0.5 times the sum of the 
normalized HR and FR.

2.4.2. Reaction times 
We modeled the ex-Gaussian reaction times for the IMT task using 
the DISTRIB (Lacouture and Cousineau, 2008 ) toolbox for Matlab. 
DISTRIB estimates the ex-Gaussian function through the multiplication 
of the cumulative density of the Gaussian function for the reaction time 
data by an exponential function. The fit is optimized by using a 
parameter search algorithm to maximize the representation of the data 
in the distribution (Lacouture and Cousineau, 2008 ). Ex-Gaussian pa-
rameters were estimated using all correct trials with a latency F200 ms 
(collapsing across conditions). 
2.5. Statistics 
We evaluated the effect of misophonia pathology on our data using a 
two-part strategy. In part one; standard comparisons of the behavioral 
data were performed. IMT response accuracy by trial type were analyzed 
using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Signal detection 
measures and ex-gaussian parameters were compared between groups 
using independent samples t-tests. Correlations between significant 
experimental measures and clinical ratings were estimated using boot-
strapped Pearson ’s r. To perform correlations, the database was split and 
the analyses were run for misophonia and anxiety patients separately. 
Correlations were Bonferonni corrected to adjust for multiple compari -
sons within measurement (Misophonia, Anxiety, and Other emotional 
symptoms/mechanisms measures) families (Misophonia [p .008] , 
Anxiety [p D.008], Other emotional symptoms /mechanisms [p < .0125] ). 
In part two, we measured the contributions of age and biological sex to 
the variance within the data using a three-block linear regression. In 
block one the experimental group was used as the only coefficient. In 
block two age was added, and in block three biological sex was added. 
The contributions of additional coefficients were evaluated using the F 
change statistic. Sex distributions were compared between the groups 
using the chi squared test of independence. 3.Results 
3.1. IMT performance 
Our ANOVA showed a significant main effect of condition (F 
124.64, df 3, p D.001, η2 0.44) but not group (F 2.06, df 1, p D
.15, η2 0.01) or group*condition (F 0.74, df 3, p D.53, η2 
0.005). IMT task performance was associated with reduced accuracy 
during catch trials relative to other conditions, but performance was not 
affected by group membership. See Table 1 and (Fig. 2). 
3.2. Signal detection 
d′ was statistically significantly greater in Misophonia patients 
compared to anxiety patients (t  2.12, df 159, p .036, d 
 0.336, CI  0.65 to  0.02), indicating a higher rate of “hits” to “false 
alarms. ” c was not significantly different between groups (t 0.47, df 
159, p .64, d 0.07, CI  0.24 to 0.38). Means are displayed in 
Table 2. In Misophonia patients, d′ was significantly correlated with the 
MIST-C (r 0.33, p .005) and the CERQ total score (r 0.31, p 
.008). No other clinical variables were significantly associated with d′ or 
c scores (Fig. 3). 
3.3. Reaction times 
Mu (t  0.46, df 159, p .65, d  0.07, CI  0.38 to 0.24), 
sigma (t 0.49, df 159, p .63, d 0.08, CI  0.23 to 0.39), and tau 
(t  1.09, df 159, p .27, d  0.17, CI  0.48 to 0.14) parameters 
were not significantly different between groups. Means are displayed in 
Table 3 and (Fig. 4). 
3.4. Contributions of developmental biology 
After identifying that signal detection was significantly different 
between the groups, we used linear regression to model the contribu -
tions of age and biological sex. In the baseline model, group was a sig-
nificant predictor of d′ (R2 0.02, F 4.49, p .036), where group had 
a beta value of β 0.16 (p .036). The addition of age (β 0.335, p D
.001) significantly altered the model (R2 change 0.105, F change 
19.13, p ≼0.001), reducing the beta value for group to β 0.079 (p 
.302), implying a positive influence of age on d′ present in both groups. 
Conversely the addition of sex (Male B  0.1, p 55, Female β  0.1, 
p .52) did not present any additional alterations to the model (R2 
change 0.002, F change 0.207, p .81). 
3.5. Sex distribution 
Sex distributions were not significantly different between the groups 
(χ2 1.7, df 2, p .043). In the anxiety group N 30 reported male, 
N 53 reported female, and N 6 reported not identifying with either. 
In the misophonia group N 22 reported male, N 48 reported female, 
and N 2 reported not identifying with either. 
4.Discussion 
Currently the diagnosis and treatment of misophonia is suffering due 
to a lack of understanding of its underlying neurobiological mecha -
nisms. In this study, we used the IMT to investigate neurocognitive 
properties of attention in misophonia that have previously been linked 
to arousal (Frank et al., 2020 ). Using a two-step analysis of the IMT, we 
first demonstrated differences in response sensitivity (dprime, d′) be-
tween the groups, indicating heightened stimulus discriminability in 
misophonia patients relative to anxiety patients. In the second stage of 
our analysis we used linear modeling to identify the contributions of age 
and biological sex to the variance in d′. Linear modeling demonstrated a 
moderate contribution of age, but not biological sex, which in turn N. Murphy et al.

Journal of Affective Disorders 347 (2024) 429–436
433reduced the group factor. The effect of age on d′ could suggest that there 
is the possibility of misophonia specific differences in attention during 
early development but that these become less substantial in line with natural cognitive development. Conversely, poorer attention in early 
age might simply be related to less developed executive functions. 
Further work is needed to elucidate the trajectory of misophonia specific 
differences in attention. 
Existing work in the neuroscientific sphere has largely sought to 
characterize the functional architecture but has not yet identified a 
mechanism by which pathology leads to the core symptoms of the dis-
order. Current hypotheses point to a state of hyper-arousal influencing 
resource allocation during sensory processing (Daniels et al., 2020 ; 
Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Frank et al., 2020 ; Neacsiu et al., 2022 ; Schroder 
et al., 2019 ). Because both misophonia and anxiety disorders are char-
acterized by attentional impairments, and a healthy control group was 
not included in our design, we performed follow-up analysis of the 
relationship of d′ to misophonic trigger information. We observed a 
positive correlation between total sound triggers and d′ in the Table 1

434misophonia sample. This finding is in line with previous accounts of 
increased alerting of attention in misophonia patients during the ANT 
(Frank et al., 2020 ) and might imply that perceptual and attentional 
systems in misophonia are tuned to be more alert for the purpose of 
identifying and avoiding trigger sounds. However, for the purpose of 
identifying this earlier in development this hypothesis should be con-
trasted with the alternate hypothesis that heightened alertness precedes 
misophonia development and represents a potential risk factor. More 
specific developmental research will be necessary to determine the na-
ture of this hypothesis. Accordingly, behavioral performance in terms of 
response accuracy and reaction times were not significantly different 
from youth with anxiety disorders, implying that pathology in miso-
phonia might differentially affect the systems for arousal and cognitive 
function. This would track with previous reports implicating hypervig -
ilance and anticipatory anxiety as core to the clinical presentation of 
misophonia in youth and adults (Jager et al., 2020 ; Swedo et al., 2022 ). 
In our study the ex-gaussian distribution was used as it has previously 
been linked to learning effects within a task (Schmiedek et al., 2007 ). 
The shape of the exponential distribution has been linked to resource 
allocation and might be affected by arousal such as seen in attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Hwang Gu et al., 2013 ). In our 
results the lack of significant differences in the ex-gaussian parameters 
suggests that the mechanism of resource allocation for task learning is not different in anxiety or misophonia. 
The lack of significant differences between misophonia and anxiety 
groups on other IMT performance outcomes may indicate that there are 
non-specific disruptions in other attentional processes across youth with 
both misophonia and anxiety disorders (e.g. (Najmi et al., 2012 )), as 
youth with anxiety disorders have been shown to experience deficits in 
other attentional domains (Sylvester et al., 2016 ). The lack of a non- 
psychiatric comparison groups does not enable this study to make 
these conclusions definitively, though given prior work on this topic, it is 
a possibility that youth with misophonia might also experience im-
pairments in these attentional domains, reflecting transdiagnostic defi-
cits associated with psychopathology more broadly. 
5.Limitations and future directions 
The present study has several limitations. First is the lack of a healthy 
control group. In our study it is difficult to discern the extent to which 
the lack of distinctions between misophonia and anxiety constitute a 
lack of behavioral deficits. Second, our test uses numeric stimuli for the 
matching conditions, restricting our ability to draw conclusions about 
broader perceptual processes. This experiment was conducted across 
multiple years coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, certain 
elements of the experiment were limited to what could be conducted 
virtually. Due to the strict requirements for auditory processing studies, 
such as volume control and sound presentation, a visual numeric format 
of the experiment was used as it could be easily recreated on a variety of 
monitors without affecting task performance. Future work should 
address this by implementing a multivariate format of the experiment, 
including an auditory discrimination task. Third, although the IMT 
provides a means of testing the properties of decision-making and how 
they are affected by arousal, it does not describe detailed neurophysi -
ological processes constructing the functional architecture in which this 
occurs. In future work it is critical to address how properties of attention 
are related to the parameters of excitation and inhibition balance that 
can be described using electroencephalography. Finally, the relationship 
between d′ and misophonic trigger information warrants further inves -
tigation, as this might indicate a first step for exploring neurocognitive 
assessments as part of clinical practice for misophonia. In our study it is a

435possibility that our analyses of the IMT outputs are tapping into practice 
effects of people with misophonia. These individuals are used to being 
alert to stimuli indicating that a trigger might occur, therefore putting 
them in a state where it is natural to pick up on subtle differences in 
stimuli that others might not notice. Ultimately the etiology of miso-
phonia is unknown and future research must address practical designs in 
the tests use to study properties such as arousal and hypervigilance so 
that causal effects can be identified. 
6.Conclusions 
Alterations in cognitive systems, through which attentional re-
sources are directed towards the identification and avoidance of trigger 
sounds, may be an avenue for future work to refine neurocognitive 
markers for misophonia in children and adults. Approaches based on 
signal detection theory provide a complimentary perspective to existing 
functional imaging studies by summarizing the computational proper -
ties of targeted systems. In this study, we observed a dimensional rela-
tionship between misophonic trigger load and response sensitivity. 
However, it still remains unclear how bottom-up sensory gating pro-
cesses might interact with higher-order cognitive processes associated with the complex patterns of behavior (Guzick et al., 2023 ) and aberrant 
neural connectivity (Neacsiu et al., 2022 ) seen in misophonia. Future 
research should examine the exact influence of auditory stimuli on 
attentional processing and how interventions can integrate findings 
from experimental research to improve effects of treatment.
