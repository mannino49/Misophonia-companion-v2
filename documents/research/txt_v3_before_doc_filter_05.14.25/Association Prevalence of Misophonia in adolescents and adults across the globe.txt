[1]. The neurophysiological model of misophonia given by 
Jastreboff suggests that misophonia follows the same path -
way as tinnitus, which involves the autonomic nervous and 
limbic systems [ 1]. Hence, misophonia can be prevalent in 
individuals with tinnitus as well.
The specific individual producing the sounds, might be 
linked to the negative emotional response experienced by 
someone with misophonia stemming from various triggers 
[3]. This can influence the interpersonal dynamics within 
relationships with friends, family, and relatives, thereby 
influencing the overall quality of life for those with miso -
phonia. The uncertainty of when trigger sounds might occur 
creates a constant state of anxiety for sufferers. Conse -
quently, they may begin to avoid certain people, locations, 
and situations that they anticipate will elicit these trigger 
sounds. Ultimately, the daily physical and emotional dis -
comfort experienced by individuals with misophonia sig -
nificantly impacts their overall quality of life. Norena [ 4] 
suggests that misophonia is prevailing now as a matter of 
civilization and manners. This concept hints that misopho -
nia could become more prevalent in the coming generations 
due to social pressure affecting one’s functionality, work 
life, social life, etc.Introduction
Misophonia, also known as selective sound sensitivity syn -
drome, is a condition characterized by a decreased toler -
ance to specific sounds, leading to a heightened emotional 
or physiological response whose reaction is attributed to 
an amplified autonomic nervous system response trig -
gered by certain sounds [ 1]. Such sounds are called trig -
gers, and triggering stimuli may vary from person to person. 
The aversive stimuli may include human-generated sounds 
such as chewing, lip-smacking, breathing, and swallow -
ing, as well as non-body-related sounds like pen clicking, 
rustling, and typing [ 2]. Misophonia is found to coexist 
with other conditions such as Obsessive Compulsive Dis -
order (OCD), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), eat -
ing disorders, tinnitus, phonophobia, hyperacusis (another 
type of sound tolerance disorder where a person finds it 
difficult to tolerate the sound when the intensity is high)

Karnataka, IndiaAbstract
misophonia is a sound tolerance disorder which disturbs the emotions of people when exposed to specific triggers. Studies 
have shown that visual triggers alone can cause misophonia in affected individuals in the absence of auditory triggers. It 
is also said to affect people’s quality of lives affecting social life, work life and personal relationships. Different studies 
on misophonia indicate that it is prevalent between 5% and 34.67%. These studies help us understand the existence of 
misophonia across different parts of the world. Studies report factors like gender, age, socioeconomic status, etc. play 
significant roles in impacting the prevalence of disorder. This study aims to review 12 such English articles available 
online, to get a comprehensive set of data to make it easy for readers and researchers. Results of the review indicate that 
not many countries have their prevalence rates established which could be indicating the lack of awareness. In countries 
that have carried out the study, clinically significant misophonia exists in many individuals with various degrees with 
multiple factors affecting it.

A Systematic Review

Indian Journal of Otolaryngology and Head & Neck SurgeryWu et al. (2014) [ 5] found that, of 483 US undergraduate 
students, 19.9% had Misophonia. A survey was conducted on 
415 Chinese graduates by Zhou et al. (2017) [ 6], and miso -
phonia was present in 20% of the sample. In India, Aryal 
& Prabhu (2022) [ 7] found that 23.28% of participants had 
clinically significant misophonia. Thus, the literature indi -
cates how it is necessary to carry out a systematic review 
to compile the existing data for reference. Misophonia is 
still not considered a condition with significance despite its 
high prevalence across various countries, ethnic groups, age 
groups, and gender groups. Thus, compiling the data may 
help throw more light on misophonia, and it is essential to 
keep the data handy and presentable within a single form to 
make it easy for researchers and implementers. A system -
atic review of the prevalence of misophonia will increase 
awareness among health professionals and researchers from 
those countries where no study has been conducted to carry 
out more research about misophonia in their countries. And 
in those EN that have produced the data, it will encourage 
them to develop a test battery to assess and treat misopho -
nia. Hence, this study attempts to determine the prevalence 
rate of misophonia across countries through a systematic 
review.
Methods
The systematic review was registered under the PROS -
PERO International Prospective Register of Systematic 
Reviews with the ID CRD42024500395. The review was 
carried out for peer-reviewed articles based on guidelines by 
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and 
Meta-analyses statement (PRISMA statement) [ 8].
Databases like Google Scholar, PubMed, CINAHL, 
J-STAGE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus 
were systematically searched to extract articles necessary 
for the review. Citation tracking and reference lists were 
used to identify other relevant studies to be added. Arti -
cles that dealt with the prevalence data of misophonia in 
normal-hearing adults were considered. Studies involving 
misophonia coexisting with any other conditions like tin -
nitus, hyperacusis, OCD, PTSD, multiple sclerosis, etc., 
were ignored. No criteria on the year of publishing were set. 
Studies that were published in English were considered for 
the review. Articles whose full length were accessible were 
included. Articles with low methodological quality and 
languages apart from English, case reports, letters to edi -
tors, and editorials were not considered for the review. The 
selection of the articles was done using the keywords, key 
terms, related search phrases, derivatives, and MeSH words 
relevant to the study: “prevalence, misophonia,” “selec -
tive sound sensitivity syndrome,” and “sound tolerance disorders.” These were combined using Boolean operators 
like ‘OR,’ ‘AND’, and ‘NOT.’ Keywords were adjusted 
across different databases to arrive at the required results. 
The results were taken in .csv format onto an Excel spread -
sheet, and duplicates were removed. Mendeley desktop was 
used as a reference manager for further assistance with data 
search, title screening and abstract screening for inclusion. 
The short-listed abstracts were sought for full-length avail -
ability, and the available articles were retrieved for review. 
Data were extracted from the finalized full-length articles 
under the following headings: author(s), publication year, 
method, country, objectives, population, study design, tools 
used, and results of the study. The quality assessment check -
list for prevalence studies adapted from Hoy et al. [ 9] was 
used.
Results
The entire process of screening the articles has been depicted 
through the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Sys -
tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flowchart (Fig. 1). A 
total of 280 articles were screened after searching the data -
bases like Google Scholar, PubMed, CINAHL, J-STAGE, 
Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. 32 dupli -
cates were found that demanded their removal, which led 
to a total of 248 articles. After the title and abstract screen -
ing, two hundred and two articles were excluded, which 
narrowed down the options for 14 articles for a full-length 
study. 14 full-length articles were assessed for their eligibil -
ity for the review. Out of these, 1 study was excluded as 
having an irrelevant population and 1 was excluded as it 
was not peer reviewed during the time of writing this article. 
A detailed PRISMA flow chart for the selection of the study 
is shown in Fig. 1.
Table 1 summarizes the objectives, study design, spe -
cific tools used, place of the survey, and results of each 
of the studies taken up for the review in the present study. 
These studies employed self reported questionnaire surveys, 
online surveys, pen and paper method, household visits, etc.
After a full-length review of these 12 articles, different 
prevalence rates in different countries were derived with 
possible factors affecting the prevalence rates. Those factors 
can be studied under discussion (see Table 2).
9 risks of bias items were analyzed under the risk of bias 
levels: low risk for the answer ‘yes’ with 0 points and high 
risk for the answer ‘no’ with 1 point. Points from all nine 
items were added to identify the risk of each study as low 
risk (0–3), moderate risk (4–6), and high risk (7–9). All the 
articles are of low risk  as per the checklist used.

Indian Journal of Otolaryngology and Head & Neck SurgeryDiscussion
Table 1 is a summary of all the studies reviewed. Miso -
phonia is a condition identified through self-report mea -
sures rather than any standardized test battery. Commonly 
used test materials are The Misophonia Questionnaire 
(MQ), Misophonia Questionnaire, Adult Sensory Question -
naire, Sheehan Disability Scale – Misophonia, Obsessive 
Compulsive Inventory-Revised, Amsterdam Misophonia 
Questionnaire (A-MISO-S), Misophonia Assessment Ques -
tionnaire (MAQ), Selective sound sensitivity syndrome 
scale (S-Five), Misophonia Questionnaire, etc.
One can observe that Zhou et al. (2017) [ 6], Yektatalab 
et al. (2022) [ 10], Vitoratou et al. (2023) [ 11] have also con -
sidered mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, 
stress, anger, etc. which signifies that misophonia can lead to poor mental health if untreated. Although almost 50% of the 
sample population had symptoms of misophonia, they did 
not seem to be affected by the triggers so as to receive pro -
fessional attention [ 7]. The severity of misophonia is a hint 
towards seeking professional help, and people are unaware 
of the management options available for misophonia. Miso -
phonia is still in its infancy and is not readily accepted as a 
valid disorder in the scientific community [ 12]. With such 
high numbers of prevalence across the globe, misophonia is 
still not recognized as a distinct illness by either the Diag -
nostic or Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edi -
tion (DSM-V) or the International Classification of Diseases 
(ICD-11), Eleventh Edition. Although multiple question -
naires have good reliability and validity, no test materials 
have been standardized. Aryal & Prabhu (2022) [ 7] used 
AMISOS and MAQ on 81 participants who had misophonia

Indian Journal of Otolaryngology and Head & Neck Surgeryquestions used in the survey. Hence, it is desirable to have a 
standardized questionnaire with good reliability and validity 
to achieve consistent results across the globe.
Limitations of the Study
Studies available in English only were considered for the 
review which led to the ignorance of articles published in 
native languages. There is a risk of excluding eligible stud -
ies. For quality analysis, checklist for prevalence studies by 
Hoy et al. (2012) [ 9], was used to analyse the risks of the 
studies inolved. Although the current results are true and 
transparent, had there been another checklist to assess the 
risks of the studies, results of quality analyses would have 
been different.
Conclusions
Clinically significant misophonia ranges between 5% and 
34.67% as found in the 12 studies reviewed. Hence it is 
necessary not only to accept misophonia as a condition 
and to come up with management options, but also a well 
defined approach to ientifying misophonia so that its diag -
nosis remains universal. Out of 195 countries in the world, 
misophonia’s existence as an independent condition without 
any comorbidity has been studied in only 7 countries includ -
ing China, Germany, India, Iran, Turkey, the United States 
and the United Kingdom. This puts awareness of misopho -
nia in other countries into question and urges researchers to 
publish their data in English to make it accessible for oth -
ers. Considering a wider sample from different age groups, 
ethnicity, profession, etc., for reliable results is emphasized 
through this review.

Declarations
Ethical Approval  In the present study, all the testing procedures were 
carried out on humans using non-invasive techniques, adhering to the 
guidelines of the Ethics Approval Committee of the institute.
Conflict of Interest  The authors declare no conflicts of interest regard -
ing the publication of this paper.symptoms and found different severity results accordingly 
suggesting non uniformity across the questionnaires.
Articles under review incorporated different sampling 
frames and modes of data collection. Trained interviewers 
visited households randomly to do one-to-one survey [ 13, 
14]. On the other side, undergraduate and graduate students 
of various courses which included psychology, mechanical 
engineering, law, medicine, etc. were sent e-survey forms 
through convenient sampling methods [ 5, 7, 10, 15–18]. 
Zhou et al. (2017) [ 6] and Sujeeth et al. (2023) [ 19] visited 
classrooms and used pen and paper battery on students with 
self administered questionnaires. The latter authors also had 
parents assist their children while answering the question -
naires to make the process easier on the subjects as they 
were highschool students.
Factors affecting the presence of misophonia were studied 
by various authors. Discussed are the observations recorded 
from the articles reviewed. While few studies suggested 
that gender has no role in the prevalence of misophonic 
symptoms [ 5–7, 11, 14, 16, 17, 19], few studies contrast -
ingly reported that misophonia is seen more in females than 
males [ 13, 18]. It was found that age significantly affects the 
prevalence of misophonia, with younger individuals being 
affected more by the condition, and the symptoms deteri -
orated in older individuals as the age progressed [ 11, 13]. 
Paradoxically, according to Wu et al. (2014) [ 5], age did 
not have any effects on misophonia. Wu et al. (2014) [ 5] 
and Brennan et al. (2023) [ 18] showed that ethinicty has no 
effects on the occurence of misophonia in inividuals. Socio -
economic status was proved to not affect misophonia [ 18]. 
Kilic et al. (2021) [ 13] also made few unique notes such as 
not being married leading to high prevalence of misopho -
nia and also found that misophonics get triggered by visual 
stimuli as well in the absence of auditory triggers. This sug -
gests that Misophonia requires a standard approach for its 
assessment and management.
Implications of the Study
Study method is majorly skewed towards online surveys 
which may have been affected by subjects’ bias which 
could be due to inattentive random answering because of 
the absence of an interviewer, improper understanding of 
the questions, etc. The inconsistency observed in various 
studies underscores the importance of investigating the 
epidemiology of misophonia using standardized method -
ological criteria. This research studied a set of such criteria, 
revealing that a minority of published studies managed to 
meet the requirements yet it is imperative for forthcoming 
studies to adhere to a standard methodological criteria to 
enable a more straightforward comparison of. Prevalence 
of misophonia and its severity varies depending upon the
