Tics are repetitive and intrusive movements, including vocalizations, typically characterized by premonitory urge with associated relief. 1 People with tic disorders have reported heightened sensitivity to sensations, including auditory stimuli, aggravating tics. 2 Misophonia is a form of auditory hypersensitivity characterized by severe dislike of speci /uniFB01 c sounds with intense emotional responses. 3 Although misophonia is a well-established phenomenon in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and other neuropsychiatric disorders such as obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD), 3,4 its interaction with tic disorders remains unacknowledged. We present 6 cases illustrating the clinical spectrum of misophonia-associated tics and their neuropsychiatric associations.

The /uniFB01 rst case was an 18-year-old patient with chronic tic disorder (CTD), ASD, and OCD. He had motor and vocal tics, including coprolalia (the ' F-word ) triggered by speci ' /uniFB01 c sounds. Misophonia to swallowing and mouth sounds, especially from his mother, triggered intense distress and tics. Avoiding proximity to his mother while eating signi /uniFB01 cantly decreased misophonia and tics. Similarly, the second case was a 32-year-old woman with CTD, ASD, and depression, with misophonia to chewing that worsened all tics, whereas the third case was a 26-year-old woman with OCD, notably without ASD, and chewing misophonia that triggered violent thoughts and facial and shoulder shrugging tics.

The fourth case was a 14-year-old boy with CTD, ASD, and OCD. Despite tolerance to most noxious sounds, hearing the speci /uniFB01 c words ' right ' and ' sorry ' was so disturbing that rapid neck extension, aggressive head nodding, and trunk /uniFB02 exion tics occurred in intense bouts. Volume, tone, and word context were not modifying factors apart from greater impact with maternal origin of speech.

The /uniFB01 fth case was a 27-year-old man with CTD, OCD, ASD, and chromosome 2p16.3 deletion. Motor tics began at age 11, later developing prominent misophonia and hyperacusis with most sounds perceived as painful, including speech and environmental sounds like air-conditioning humming (Video 1, Segment 1). He required almost-constant noise-canceling headphones, causing extreme social isolation and impairment. Audiology testing was unrevealing. Cognitive behavioral therapy mildly improved misophonia.

The sixth case was a 19-year-old woman with a functional tic disorder. She had stereotyped repetitive shouting of phrases, including ' who makes the noise? ' and ' stop it!, ' triggered by subtle background noises like breathing (including from examiners), squeaking chair noises, and door opening (Video 1, Segment 2).

These cases illustrate the range and severity of misophonia in CTDs and their neuropsychiatric associations, as well as in functional tics. Misophonia can occur with any sound but often with oral or environmental sounds 3 and can be a debilitating symptom, commonly associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions. 3,4 Indeed, patients with primary tic disorders here also had comorbid ASD or OCD. Distinguishing their contribution from CTDs itself is challenging, but awareness that misophonia may be a tic-modifying factor is prudent for both education and behavioral therapies. Importantly, most patients experienced misophonia that itself could trigger tics, whereas avoiding misophonia triggers resulted in the absence of or decreased tics. Abrupt emotional dysregulation may cause misophonia ; 5 however, the pathophysiology remains unclear. 4 Misophonia may also occur in functional neurological disorders (FND) (case 5), potentially with different underpinnings. Although misophonia lacks evidence-based treatments, behavioral management is preferred over neuropharmacology. 3 The response of misophonia-associated tics to therapy beyond trigger avoidance is unclear; however, we guided patients for Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (cases 1 -4), behavior therapy (case 5), and FND programs (case 6).

Video 1. Segment 1, case 4: functionally incapacitating misophonia combined with hyperacusis. Constant usage of noise-canceling headphones over earplugs as coping method. Segment 2, case 5: functional tics triggered by misophonia to subtle noises, including coughing (the examiner), a dripping faucet, and phone noti /uniFB01 cations.
