Abstract  1 
Experiences of “auditory hyperreactivity ” and decreased sound tolerance , which can be 2 
separated into phenotypes such as hyperacusis and misophonia,  are prevalent in autism and 3 
ADHD  and impact  quality of life and wellbeing.  Furthermore , atypical patterns of attention 4 
regulation are common in both autism and ADHD.  While ADHD is traditionally defined by 5 
inattention, and while the monotropism hypothesis posits that autism is characterized by 6 
intense focus, increasing evidence suggests bot h hyper -focus and susceptibility to distraction 7 
are elevated in both diagnoses .  It is currently unclear whether hyper -focusing on stimuli or 8 
having one’s attention captured by them could lead to sensory hyperreactivity; therefore, this 9 
study investigates associations between  auditory hyperreactivity and hyper -focus and 10 
inattention .  492 adults (122 ADHD -only, 130 autistic -only, 141 autistic+ADHD, 99 comparison ) 11 
completed questionnaires indexing hyper -focus, inattention, and various forms of auditory 12 
hyperreactivity ; participants also completed a psychoacoustic misophonia measure .  Per 13 
questionnaires, a uditory hyperreactivity was markedly  elevated in either  autis tic and ADHD  14 
participants  relative to comparison participants  (.46≤ Cliff’s δ≤.84) , whereas differences 15 
between autism and ADHD alone were small  (.05≤|Cliff’s δ|≤.21) .  Numerous associations 16 
between forms of self -reported auditory hyperreactivity and attention variables were found in 17 
neurodivergent groups , though fewer associations attained significance in the comparison 18 
group.   However, self -reported misophonia was only modestly related to psychoacoustic 19 
misophonia scores  (.22≤ Spearman’s  ρ≤.31 ), and psychoacoustic misophonia scores were not 20 
significantly associated with attention  (.02≤ Spearman’s  ρ≤.20) .  These findings generally 21 
support  the idea that attention may be co nnected to many neurodivergent people’s auditory 22

hyperreactivity , but also emphasize  the need for improve d measurement of sensory 23 
experiences .  24

1. Introduction  26 
Atypical sensory experiences and behaviours are common in both Attention 27 
Dysregulation  Hyperactivity Development (ADHD)1 and Autism Spectrum Development (ASD) .  28 
In autism, studies  examining  autism diagnostic measures and health/educational records have 29 
reported prevalence estimates of 72 -74% (Carson et al., 2021; Kirby et al., 2022) , and  studies 30 
using dedicated  sensory measures often report considerably higher prevalences (Crane et a l., 31 
2009; Dellapiazza et al., 2018) .  Furthermore, although some studies suggest differences from 32 
typical sensory processing could be  more pronounced in autism than ADHD  (Little et al., 2015; 33 
Schulz et al., 2022) , others find no or  only  modest differences between  autism and ADHD  34 
(Cheung & Siu, 2009; Clince et al., 2016; Dellapiazza et al., 2020; Scheerer et al., 2022) .  35 
Unfortunat ely, these common neurodivergent  experiences of sensory discomfort and distress 36 
often have serious disabling consequences.  Indeed, sensory processing appears to be 37 
associated with (Lin & Huang, 2019)  or an aspect of (McConachie et al., 2020)  autistic people’s 38 
quality of life.  In both autism  and ADHD, sensory processing appears to be related to 39 
participation in activities (Engel -Yeger & Ziv -On, 2011; Ismael et al., 2018; Little et al., 2015) , to 40 
sleep (Dwyer, Ferrer, et al., 2022; Lufi & Tzischinsky, 2014; Mimouni -Bloch et al., 2021; 41 
 
1 Throughout this article, we endeavour to use terminology that is accurate, non -stigmatizing, and respectful of the 
identities of marginalized groups.  For example, in light of evidence of hyper -focus in ADHD , the traditional label of 
an attention “deficit”  appears to be not only laden with derogatory value judgements,  but also to be  empirically 
inaccurate  in many contexts .  Prior commentaries and guidelines provide further detail that informed our 
terminology choices (e.g., Bottema -Beutel et al., 2021; Dwyer, 2022; Dwyer et al., 2022; Gernsbacher, 2017; 
National Center on Disability and Journalism, 2021; Sinclair, 2013) .

Tzischinsky et al., 2018) , and to anxiety (Bitsika et al., 2020; Lane & Reynolds, 2019; Normansell - 42 
Mossa et al., 2021) . 43 
1.1. Sensory Phenotyping  44 
Although many sensory measures reflect a concept of generalized “hyperreactivity” or 45 
“hypersensitivity” in neurodivergent people (Baranek et al., 2006; Lai et al., 2019; Robertson & 46 
Simmons, 2013) , there are likely multiple distinct constructs underlying it  (Williams et al., 47 
2023) , even in single sensory modalities such as hearing (Jastrebo ff & Jastreboff, 2015; 48 
Williams, He, et al., 2021) .2  Unfortunately, it is presently unclear how these more specific 49 
sensory constructs might differ across autism and ADHD.  50 
One aspect of auditory “hyper reactivity ” might be auditory distractibility : the  capture of 51 
attention by sounds, interfering with people’s ability to concentrate on tasks, which has been 52 
reported in both autism (Howe & Stagg, 2016; Landon et al., 2016)  and ADHD (Cassuto et al., 53 
2013; Johnson, 2014; Oja et al., 2016) .  Such experiences of audit ory distractibility need not 54 
necessarily be uncomfortable or distressing.  55 
There also appear to be multiple varieties of decreased sound tolerance, including 56 
misophonia   (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2015; Williams, He, et al., 2021) .  Misophoni a is 57 
characterized by strong emotional and autonomic reactions, including irritation, anger, and 58 
disgust, towards specific trigger sounds; the reactions are driven not by the intensity of the 59 
sounds but by the patterns and meanings of sounds (Cavanna & Seri, 2015; Ferrer -Torres & 60 
Giménez -Llort, 2022; Swedo et al., 2022)  and they accordingly require sound identification 61 
 
2 Due to this complex structure, terms such as “decreased sound tolerance” or terms for specific varieties thereof 
are often used in preference to “hyperreactivity”; however, as the present study includes multiple forms of 
decreased sound tolerance as we ll as auditory distractibility/filtering issues, we use “hyperreactivity.”

5 
 
(Savard et al., 2022) .  Repetitive oral/nasal sounds (e.g., chewing) appear to be particularly 62 
common or strong triggers, but other human -generated and non -human -generated sounds can 63 
also elicit misophonic reactions (Enzler, Loriot, et al., 2021; Hansen et al., 2 021) . 64 
A further form of decreased sound tolerance is hyperacusis , which is sometimes defined 65 
as reduced tolerance of sounds that are generally perceived as normal (e.g., Adams et al., 66 
2020) , although more precise definitions of hyperacusis focus on stimulus properties such as 67 
intensity or fr equency (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2015) , e.g., by describing hyperacusis as being 68 
characterized by diminished sound tolerance a t intensity levels that are tolerated well by most 69 
people, resulting in experiences of increased loudness (Williams, He, et al., 202 1).  Such 70 
experiences are evident in both autism  (Khalfa et al., 2004)  and ADHD (Lucker et al., 1996) .  71 
Furthermore, a subset of individuals appear to experience pain hyperacusis , or physical pain in 72 
the ears caused by loud sounds (Scheerer et al., 2024; Williams, He, et al., 2021) .  Autistic and 73 
ADHD people also report experiences of sensory overload  (Scheydt et al., 2017) , a construct 74 
which might often be difficult to disentangle from the reduced tolerance of loud sounds 75 
characteristic of hyperacusis.  In sensory overload, either excessive stimulus intensity or an 76 
excessive number or diversity of stimuli can cause people to become overwh elmed and to 77 
struggle to process information (Scheydt et al., 2017) .  This can lead to internally distressing 78 
experiences of “shutdown” or provoke externalizing “meltdown” reactions (Belek, 2018) . 79 
Yet another form of decreased sound tolerance is phonophobia , a specific phobia 80 
toward s some sounds, which is associated with anticipatory anxiety and avoidance (Williams, 81 
He, et al., 2021) .  Although some authors c onceptualize phonophobia  as a form of misophonia 82 
(Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2015) , the anticipatory fear and anxiety characterizing phonophobia 83

6 
 
appear distinct from anger and disgust reactions in misophonia (Willi ams, He, et al., 2021) .  84 
However, it is only to be expected that sensory discomfort and distress , including misophonia 85 
(Jager et al., 2020) , would contribute towards anxiety, as shown by longitudinal studies 86 
(Carpenter et al., 2019; Green et al., 2012) .  Thus, in practice, phonophobia may sometimes  be 87 
difficult to disentangle from other forms of decreased sound tolerance  (Jacquemin et al., 2024) . 88 
1.2. Attention and Sensory Experiences  89 
Many theories have been advanced in an effort to explain, cognitive ly or 90 
neurobiologically, the origin of atypical sensory behaviours and experiences in 91 
neurodevelopmental disabilities (Ward, 2018) .  Some views suggest that attention plays a 92 
crucial, and perhaps neglected, role (Green & Wood, 2019; Liss et al., 2006; Murray et al., 2005; 93 
Thielen & Gillebert, 2019) . 94 
Interestingly, a lthough ADHD is canonically associated with distractibility and 95 
inattention, ADHD people can also exhibit attentional hyper -focus , particularly in highly 96 
engaging activities, such as “screen time” (Grotewiel et al., 2023; Hupfeld et al., 2019; Ozel -Kizil 97 
et al., 2016; Sedgwick et al., 2019) .  Meanwhi le, autism is  associated with slowness to 98 
disengage attention (Sacrey et al., 2014)  and with focused, intense interests  (Uljarević et al., 99 
2022) , and it is often considered to be closely linked to hyper -focusing of attention  (Rapaport et 100 
al., n.d.; Russell et al., 2019) .  Indeed, the autistic -developed monotropism theory  (Garau et al., 101 
2023; Murray et al., 2005) , postulating that autism is fundamentally characterized by a narrow 102 
focusing of attention on a small range of targets of intense interest to a given  autistic  individual , 103 
attracts broad support in communities of autistic adults (Warren, 2021) .  However , autistic 104 
people can also display enhanced processing of background  stimuli (Remington et al., 2019; 105

7 
 
Remington & Fairnie, 2017)  and a susceptibility towards exogenous, stimulus -driven capture of 106 
attention (Allenmark et al., 2021; Keehn et al., 2019; Poole et al., 2018; Venker et al., 2021) .  107 
Thus, contrary to stereotypes , both autism and ADHD can be associated  in different contexts  108 
with  hyper -focus and with susceptibility towards distraction/inattention . 109 
These atypical attentional styles could be related to atypical sensory experiences.  The 110 
developers of the monotropism account insightfully noted this possibility , suggesting that  111 
autistic  experiences of hypo -sensitivity to stimuli might reflect stimuli falling outside the focus  112 
of attention, while  sensory discomfort might sometimes reflect hyper -attention to stimuli  or 113 
stimuli exogenously disrupting  a focused attention tun nel (Murray et al., 2005 ; see also Liss et 114 
al., 2006 ).  Similarly, diminished interoception  might sometimes reflect reduced attention 115 
towards bodily signals, whereas anxiety or other factors might result in heightened attention to 116 
bodily sensations and lead to wards  somatization (Trevisan et al., 2021) .  We speculate that both 117 
hyper -focus and susceptibility towards  distraction /inattention could be related to sensory 118 
hyper -reactivity: that hyper -reactivity  may partly reflect susceptibility towards noticing and 119 
exogenously directing attention towards distracting or distressing stimuli , after which hyper - 120 
focusing of attention and difficulty disengaging could exacerbate the experience . 121 
It is possible that measu res capable of more precisely distinguishing different sensory 122 
phenotypes, such as hyperacusis and misophonia, could aid understanding of any links between 123 
attention and sensory experiences.  For example, i t seems reasonable to suggest  that intense 124 
misopho nic emotional reactions would require  individuals to attend to  the sounds that trigger 125 
these reactions , and indeed, heightened attention to detail has been reported in misophonic 126

8 
 
people (Andermane et al., 2023; Simner et al., 2022)  and trigger sounds appear to capture 127 
attention and interfere with task performanc e (da Silva & Sanchez, 2019) . 128 
1.3. Present Study  129 
The present study aims to characterize the auditory sensory experiences of autistic -only ; 130 
ADHD -only ; autistic +ADHD ; and non-autistic , non-ADHD people , with particular focus on 131 
auditory distractibility, misophonia, and loudness discomfort .  Furthermore , it aims to evaluate 132 
convergence between questionnaire and psychoacoustic measures of misophonia.  Finally , it 133 
aims to explore associations between auditor y sensory experiences and measures of hyper - 134 
focus and inattention.   We hypothesize that:  135 
1. Loudness discomfort and misophonia will be elevated in the autistic -only and  136 
autistic +ADHD groups relative to ADHD -only  individuals, and in the ADHD -only group  137 
relativ e to comparison participants . 138 
2. Auditory distractibility  will be elevated in the autistic +ADHD and ADHD -only groups 139 
relative to autism -only, and in the autistic -only group relative to comparison 140 
participants . 141 
3. Questionnaire misophonia scores will converge rob ustly with the psychoacoustic 142 
misophonia measure.  143 
4. Decreased sound tolerance phenotypes, including misophonia and loudness discomfort, 144 
will be separately associated with  both inattention and hyper -focus . 145

2. Methods  146 
2.1. Participants  147 
The study sample and recruitment procedures have been described in more detail 148 
elsewhere (Dwyer et al., 2024) .  We recruited four groups of participants : autistic people  who 149 
were not ADHD ( autistic -only), ADHD participants who were not autistic (ADHD -only), 150 
participants who were both autistic and ADHD ( autistic+ADHD), and comparison participants 151 
who were neither autistic nor ADHD (comparison).  152 
Both neurodivergent and comparison participants were recruited from  CloudResearch 153 
(Litman et al., 2017)  and Prolific (Palan & Schitter, 2018) .  Furthermore, many autistic 154 
participants were recruited f rom SPARK Research Match (Felici ano et al., 2018) . 155 
1038 unique, complete screening responses were received ( 63 CloudResearch, 6 49 156 
Prolific, and 3 25 SPARK) .  Self-identifications as autistic or ADHD were accepted, but 157 
participants were required to have ASRS -6 ADHD trait scores consistent with these 158 
identifications as described below .  Participants with uncorrected hearing loss  or who missed 159 
attention checks were excluded.  Comparison participants with  first- or second -degree autistic 160 
and ADHD relatives  were excluded . 161 
A total of 609 unique participants provided responses to  the full survey; however,  some 162 
participants were removed due to poor or discrepant data ( n=82) or RAADS -14 autistic trait 163 
scores inconsistent with their group assignment ( n=35).  This left a final sample of 492 164 
participants  (Table 1) : 99 comparison  (10 CloudResearch, 89 Prolific) , 122 ADHD -only  (7 165 
CloudResearch, 115 Prolific) , 130 autistic -only  (38 Prolific , 92 SPARK ), and 141 autistic +ADHD  (1 166 
CloudResearch, 37 Prolific , 103 SPARK ).  All participants received $15 USD for completing the 167

10 
 
final survey.   CloudResearch and Prolific participants additionally received $0.55 for the 168 
screening survey . 169

Table 1. Demographic characteristics of participants.  Analyses of ordinal variables use omnibus Kruskal -Wallis tests and Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney  
post -hocs ; however, comparisons of the ages of ADHD and autism diagnoses use only Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney tests, due to the availability of 
autism and ADHD diagnostic data only from autistic and ADHD participants.  Analyses of categorical variables use Fish er’s exact tests.

3. Including self -reports of both self -identified and formally diagnosed co -occurring conditions, if current.  In the case of miso phonia only, 
participants were provided with a definition of misophonia (“ Misophonia is a condition in which individuals have excessive and inappropriate 
emotional responses to specific "trigger" sounds (e.g., chewing, tapping, sniffling), even when those sounds do not seem loud to others. Anger, 
extreme irritation, disgust, and anxiety are the most common emotions, though some individuals may experience rage. Misophoni c triggers may 
evoke a "fight or flight" response, including symptoms such as muscle tens ion, increased heart rate, and sweating .”).  In all other cases, 
participants were not provided with a definition before being asked if they had the condition.  
4. Note that some participants with formal diagnoses could not recall which subtype they had bee n diagnosed with.

2.2. Survey Measures  170 
2.2.1. Adult ADHD Self -Report Scale  (ASRS)  171 
The six -item World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self -Report Scale (ASRS -6) (Kessler 172 
et al., 2005, 2007)  was collected in the screening survey .  The ASRS -6 offers  multiple cut -off 173 
scores (10, 14, and 18)  with varying sensit ivity and specificity (Kessler et al., 2 007) .  We varied 174 
cut-offs for different groups due to  phenotypic overlap between autism and ADHD (Krakowski 175 
et al., 2021; Vaidya & Klein, 2022) , as well as based on whether participants had formal 176 
diagnoses or were self -identified .  The following participants were considered eligible:  177 
• diagnosed or self -identified autistic participants who indicated that they were non - 178 
ADHD, and whose ASRS -6 scores fell under the least sensitive  ADHD  cut-off (18);  179 
• participants who indicated that they we re non -ADHD and non -autistic, and whose ASRS - 180 
6 scores fell under the middle cut -off (14);  181 
• participants who self -identified as ADHD, but had no formal diagnosis, and whose ASRS - 182 
6 scores met or exceeded the middle cut -off (14);  183 
• participants who had formal AD HD diagnoses and whose ASRS -6 scores met or 184 
exceeded the most sensitive cut -off (10) ; and  185 
• non-autistic participants who reported formerly (but not currently) being ADHD, but 186 
whose ASRS -6 scores met or exceeded the middle cut -off (14).  187 
In the full survey, w e collected the longer 18 -item version of the ASRS, the ASRS -18 188 
(Kessler et al., 2005) .  As this included the six items ASRS -6 items , we re -calculated  ASRS -6 189 
scores and ex cluded participants who no longer met criteria for inclusion based on  their second  190 
ASRS -6 score.  191

16 
 
2.2.2. Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale ( RAADS -14) 192 
The 14-item Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale (RAADS -14; Eriksson et al. , 193 
2013)  was collected in the full survey.   Autistic participants were excluded if they did not have 194 
RAADS -14 scores at or exceeding cut -off (14).  Comparison participants were excluded if they 195 
scored at or above cut -off.  As ADHD -only participants  often  exceeded the autism cut -off in the 196 
validation sample (Eriksson et al., 2013) , we did not exclude ADHD -only  participants based on 197 
RAADS -14 scores . 198 
2.2.3. Adult Hyperfocus  Questionnaire (AHQ)  199 
We presented a shortened version  of the Adult Hyperfocus Questionnaire (AHQ) 200 
developed by Hupfeld et al.  (2019) .  Participants answered  items about the frequency of having 201 
experience s of hyper -focus in general  (dispositional hyper -focus) .  As the original measure 202 
included doublet pairs of similar items, we, in consultation with Kathleen Hupfeld, removed one 203 
item from each doublet.  This left 6 dispositional hyper -focus items . 204 
The AHQ , as administered in the present study, also included items asking about 205 
experiences of school, hobby, and screen time hyper -focus, as well as the valence of hyper - 206 
focus experiences; these data are described elsewhere (Dwyer et al., 2024) . 207 
2.2.4. Multidimensional Inventory of Sound Tolerance -Adult  (MIST -A) 208 
The Multidimensional Inventory of Sound Tolerance -Adult  (MISTA -A) is a measure of 209 
decreased sound tolerance specifically developed to quantify multiple dimensions of sound 210 
intolerance and screen for clinically significant decreased sound tolerance in the a dult 211 
population; this measure is specifically designed to be applicable for use in autistic adults, as 212 
well as other neurodivergent and non -neurodivergent adults experiencing decreased sound 213

17 
 
tolerance (Williams, Cascio, et al., 2021) . 26 items (28 in the development version used in the 214 
present study) invit e participants to report the frequency of experiences of decreased sound 215 
tolerance  within the previous month ; 24 of these items  are grouped into four  dimensions : 216 
Misophonia , Hyperacusis  (that i s, loudness hyperacusis and auditory overwhelm , including 217 
some anticipatory anxiety ), Fear/ Panic (reactions to sounds, not anticipatory phobia of them) , 218 
and Pain (that is, pain hyperacusis)  (Williams, 2024) . Using a free online calculator 219 
(https://asdmeasures.shinyapps.io/MISTA_score/ ), the MIST -A or any subset of its items can be 220 
scored using item response theory to p roduce normed T -scores (based on 1348 US general 221 
population adults ) for each of these four dimensions.  These scores converge well with other 222 
measures of sound tolerance constructs , including semi -structured diagnostic interviews to 223 
assess for the major sound tolerance disorders  (Williams, 2024) .  T-scores > 60 are considered 224 
indicative of clinically elevated sound intolerance, and scores >70 suggest severe difficulties.  225 
Note that 9 MIST -A items were used for screening; if participants endorse d never having 226 
experiences of sound intolerance on all screening items, the remaining MIST -A items were not 227 
presented, and T -scores were based only on the administered items.  228 
In addi tion, two sets of supplemental items on the MIST -A development version (not 229 
published with the official scale but administered as part of the present study) ask participants 230 
to report the frequency of sound -evoked physical  symptoms  (15 items; two subscales  of 231 
hyperacusis -related symptoms and non -specific symptoms) , and provide ratings of sound - 232 
tolerance related functional  impairment/ quality of life  (8 items) .  Raw scores on these subscales 233 
are presented in supplementary materials.  234

18 
 
2.2.5. Vanderbilt Auditory  Distractibility Questionnaire (VADQ)  235 
The Vanderbilt Auditory Distractibility Questionnaire (VADQ) is a brief, 7 -item, 236 
unidimensional measure of auditory distractibility originally developed for use with autistic 237 
adults (Williams, 2021) . 238 
2.3. Sound Rating  Measures  239 
2.3.1. Core Discriminant Sounds  (CDS)  240 
A version of the Core Discriminant Sounds (CDS) misophonia measure  developed by 241 
Enzler et al. (2021)  was implemented in Qualtrics.  Participants first listen ed to a white noise 242 
stimulus  and were asked to adjust the volume “ until it is playing at a clear, comfortable volume: 243 
neither t oo low nor too high .”  Participants then listened to practice sounds (“marimba” and 244 
“squeaking door”) and were given opportunities to adjust the volume.  Once volume was 245 
adjusted, participants were asked not to change their system sound level.   Several  types of 246 
sound were presented , including 10 common misophonia triggers , consisting of mouth sounds 247 
(“chewing 1,” “chewing 2,”  “slurping”), breathing/nasal sounds (“breath running,”  “sniffling,”  248 
“snoring”), throat sounds (swallowing,” “throat clearing”), and r epetitive sounds (  “keyboard,” 249 
“pen clicking”) .  We also presented  4 canonically  unpleasant sounds (“clapping,” “fingernails on 250 
chalkboard,” “fork scratch plate,” “scream ”), and 7 canonically pleasant sounds (“birds,” 251 
“fountain,” “harp,” “laugh,”  “ocean,”  “piano,” “underwater ”), using  stimuli from prior research 252 
(Enzler, Fournier, et al., 2021; Enzler, Loriot, et al., 2021) .  Sounds were presented twice in a 253 
randomized o rder , with a short break between blocks,  at an equal root mean square  intensity.   254 
Participants pressed a button to play each sound, after which a horizontal 101 -point visual 255 
analogue  scale  (VAS)  from “pleasant” to “unpleasant” was presented with the instru ction that, 256

19 
 
“If the sound is very pleasant, you should click on the far left of the scale. If the sound is very 257 
unpleasant, you must click on the far right of the scale. If the sound is neutral, you should click 258 
in the middle of the scale. ”  Scores ranged from 0 (very pleasant) to 100 (very unpleasant).   259 
Participants could replay the sound before giving an answer.  260 
We examined median ratings for canonic ally pleasant, unpleasant, and misophonia 261 
trigger sounds  as an outcome in the present study . Following Enzler, Loriot, et al.  (2021) , we 262 
also calculated Core Discriminant Sound  Misophonia (CDS -M) scores for misophonic trigger 263 
sounds, which  reflect positive differences between a participant’s median rating for a sound 264 
and the 75% quantile rating from control  participants (defined here as non-autistic, non -ADHD  265 
participants reporting  no current or historical misophonia ), divided by the maximum possible 266 
value ( the largest possible difference between a participant’s rating and the 75% quantile), 267 
multiplied by 100.   Sound -specific CDS scores were then averaged to produce the CDS -M total 268 
score , as well as CDS scores for mouth, breathing/nose, throat, and repetitive  sounds .  Sounds 269 
with 75% quantile ratings > 9 0 (extremely negative) in control participants were excluded from 270 
computation of CDS scores , to avoid magnifying minute  differences  (Supplementary Table 1) .  271 
As a result, reactions to chewing  sounds are not inc luded in the CDS.  272 
2.4. Data Analysis  273 
All statistical analyses were conducted in R Studio , version 4.2.2 . 274 
2.4.1. Group Comparisons  275 
Groups were compared on continuous variables using  two-way ordinal probit regression 276 
(Harrell, 2022; Ripley et al., 2022) , with autism and ADHD as separa te independent variables.   277 
Significant interactions were  probed using Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney tests  to compare all 278

20 
 
groups , with a Benjamini -Yekutieli false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons  279 
(Benjamini & Yekutie li, 2001) .  Cliff’s δ (Cliff, 1993; Torchiano, 2022)  is reported as an effect 280 
size.  Delta values of approximately ±0.11, ±0.28, and ±0.43 are equivalent to Cohen’s 281 
benchmarks of “small,” “medium” and “large” effect sizes (i.e., d of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8, based on 282 
parametric equivalency between d and δ under normality  (McGraw & Wong, 1992) ).  283 
Comparisons of groups on misophonia CDS scores also used ordinal probit  regression, 284 
but with the additional independent variable of self -reported misophonia status (currently 285 
misophonic vs. never misophonic), as well as au tism and ADHD status.  Participants who 286 
reported historical but not current misophonia were excluded from this analysis.  287 
2.4.2. Associations of Measures  288 
Associations among misophonia measures  were examined using Spearman’s ordinal 289 
correlation coefficient s eparately in each group; a Benjamini -Yekutieli false discovery rate 290 
correction for four multiple comparisons (four groups) was applied.  291 
Unique effects of AHQ Dispositional Hyper -Focus (AHQ -DHF) and ASRS -18 Inattention 292 
(ASRS -I) scores, each controlling for the other, on sensory measures were examined using 293 
partial Spearman’s correlations (Kim, 2015) . 294 
Furthermor e, correlation matrices among all variables employed in this study are 295 
presented  in Supplementary Tables 2-5, and correlations between sensory questionnaires  and 296 
other variables presented by (Dwyer et al., 2024)  are presented in Supplementary  Tables 6-9. 297

3. Results  298 
3.1. Group Comparisons  299 
3.1.1. Decreased Sound Tolerance  and Auditory Distractibility  300 
As described in Table 2, we observed main effects of autism and of ADHD on  T-scores 301 
from  each of the four  MIST -A experience subscales ( Misophonia , Figure 1A; Hyperacusis, Figure 302 
1B; Fear/ Panic, Figure 1C ; and Pain, Figure 1D), driven by elevated scores in autistic and ADHD 303 
people relative to non -autistic and non -ADHD people  (large effects) .  However, we also 304 
observed interactions, complicating interpretation of the main effects.  Post -hoc tests in Table 2 305 
found higher scores in autistic +ADHD than ADHD -only on all subscales  (small to medium 306 
effects) , while autistic +ADHD people reported highe r scores than autistic -only on Hyperacusis, 307 
Fear/ Panic, and Pain (small to medium effects) .  Furthermore, autistic -only participants 308 
reported more Hyperacusis and auditory Pain than ADHD -only participants  (small effects) , but 309 
there was little to suggest  autistic -only people differed from  ADHD -only people  in experiences 310 
of Misophonia or auditory Fear/ Panic.  All neurodivergent groups had higher scores than 311 
comparison participants on all MIST -A experience subscales.  312 
There were main effects of autism and ADHD on Auditory Distractibility ( Figure 1E ), with 313 
greater Auditory Distractibility in autistic and ADHD people relative to non -autistic and non - 314 
ADHD people , but an interaction of autism and ADHD was  also apparent.  Po st-hoc tests in 315 
Table 2 found elevated scores  in autistic +ADHD  people  (medium effect) , and at a trend level in  316 
autistic -only people , relative to ADHD -only participants .  All neurodivergent groups reported 317 
more auditory distractibility issues than participa nts in the comparison group  (large effects) . 318

22 
 
There were also main effects of autism and ADHD on r atings of misophonic trigger 319 
sounds in the sound ratings  task, with autistic and ADHD participants giving higher (i.e., more 320 
unpleasant) ratings than non -autis tic and non -ADHD participants ( Figure 1F).  An interaction of 321 
autism and ADHD was also observed ; the n eurodivergent groups  did not significantly differ 322 
from one another  in post -hoc tests, but there were medium differences between each and the 323 
comparison group  (Table 2) . 324 
As reported in Table 2, there was a  main effect of autism on ratings of canonically 325 
pleasant sounds in the sound ratings  task, with autistic participants giving higher (i.e., less 326 
pleasant)  ratings to canonically pleasant sounds  than non -autistic participants ( Figure 1G). 327 
There were n o main effects or interactions of autism and ADHD on ratings of canonically 328 
unpleasant sounds ( Figure 1H). 329 
Raw scores on MIST -A Symptom and Impairment subscales are presented in 330 
Supplementary Table 10. 331 
However, it should be noted that patterns of sound tolerance differences among the 332 
neurodivergent groups depended upon the RAADS and ASRS autistic and ADHD cut -offs used to 333 
include and exclude participants; more rigorous ADHD trait criteria could increa se sound 334 
tolerance issues in ADHD participants relative to autistic participants  (Supplementary Table 13), 335 
while more rigorous autistic trait criteria could reverse some of these changes  (Supplementary 336 
Table 16). 337

When psychoacoustic Core Discriminant Sound (CDS) scores were calculated from 340 
misophonic trigger sounds in the sound rating task, both chewing  sound s from Enzler, Loriot, et 341 
al. (2021)  were excluded due to control 75% quantile s > 90.  All other misophonic trigger 342 
sounds were included.  343 
There were main effects of self -reported misophonia on CDS Misophonia (CDS -M) total, 344 
CDS mouth sound, and CDS repetitive sound scores, with self-identified  misophonic participants 345 
having h igher (i.e., more misophonic) scores than non -misophonic participants ( Figure 2 ; Table 346 
3).  There were also main effects of ADHD on CDS -M total and CDS breathing/nasal sound 347 
scores, with ADHD participants having higher scores than non -ADHD participants, an d a main 348 
effect of autism on CDS repetitive sound scores, with autistic participants having higher scores 349 
than non -autistic participants.    350

and comparison) and self -reported misophonia status (currently misophonic vs. non -misophonic ; historical misophoni a was excluded ).  CDS 
scores, averaged across sounds, are based on  taking  the positive differences between a participant’s rating of a sound and the 75% quantile of 
non-autistic, non -ADHD, non -misophonic participants’ ratings, then rescaling those differences on a scale of 0 ( i.e., the participant’s rating of the 
sound was equa l to or less than the 75% quantile, i.e., as or more pleasant than the 75% quantile  rating ) to 100 ( i.e., the participant’s rating was 
the maximum possible unpleasantness rating).   Pairwise Wilcoxon tests  use a Benjamini -Yekutieli  FDR correction  for 28 com parisons.

3.2. Associations of Measures  352 
3.2.1. Convergence of Misophonia Measures  353 
MIST -A Misophonia T-scores and CDS -M scores were significantly and positively 354 
correlated in all four group s: ADHD -only, Spearman’s ρ=.2 6, corrected p=.006, 95% CI=[.0 8, 355 
.42]; autistic +ADHD, ρ=.2 5, corrected p=.006, 95% CI=[. 09, .41]; autistic -only, ρ=.2 2, corrected 356 
p=.01, 95% CI=[.0 5, .38]; and comparison participants, ρ=. 31, corrected p=.006, 95% CI=[. 11, 357 
.48] (Supplementary Figure s 1-2).  However, effect sizes were only weak to moderate.  358 
3.2.2. Associations of Sensory Measures  and Attention  359 
As reported in Table 4, there were clear, unique associations between AHQ Dispositional 360 
Hyper -Focus scores and ASRS Inatten tion scores and MIST -A and VADQ scores.  For example, in 361 
ADHD -only  participants, Inattention  was positively  and moderately  associated with all MIST -A 362 
sound tolerance T-scores  and with Auditory Distractibility  (Figure 3A-E; Supplementary Figure 363 
3A-E).  All of those associations except that involving MIST -A Fear/ Panic remained statistically 364 
signi ficant  even after controlling for Hyper -Focus  – which , in ADHD -only participants , was itself 365 
weakly to moderately associated with Auditory Distractibility and self-reported Misophonia, 366 
Hyperacusis, and Fear/ Panic  367 
In autistic+ADHD participants, Hyper -Focus was moderately related to Hyperacusis, 368 
auditory Fear/ Panic, and auditory Pain, and these effects remained significant when controlling 369 
for Inattention (Table 4; Figure 3B -D; Supplementary Figure 3B-D).  Moreover, autistic+ADHD  370 
participants’ Auditory Distractibility was moderately related to Inattention, and this effect 371 
remained significant when controlling for Hyper -Focus  (Figure 3E , Supplementary Figure 3E). 372

29 
 
In autistic -only participants, Hyper -Focus was significantly and moderately associated 373 
with auditory Pain, even controlling for inattention  (Table 4 ; Figure 3D ; Supplementary Figure 374 
3D).  Moreover, autistic -only participants’ self-reported misophonia was weakly related to 375 
inattention , and their experiences of Hyperacusis and auditory Fear/ Panic were weakly or 376 
moderately related  to both  Hyper -Focus and Inattention  (Figure 3A -C; Supplementary Figure 377 
3A-C); these  associations  failed to attain statistical significance in partial correlations , so that it 378 
unclear whether unique effects of a single attentional index can account for the relationships, 379 
or whether an underlying source of shared attentional variance might  be involved.  380 
Meanwhile, in comparison participants, only Auditory Distractibility was significantly 381 
(and moderately) associated with inattention after accounting for Hyper -Focus (Table 4 ; Figure 382 
3E; Supplementary Figure 3E).  There  was also a moderate  association between control 383 
participants’ Hyper -Focus and auditory Fear/ Panic, but this did not remain  after accounting for 384 
Inattention  (Figure 3C ; Supplementary Figure 3C). However, neither Inattention nor Hyper - 385 
Focus significantly predicted CDS Misophonia  (CDS -M) scores  (Table 4; Figure 3F ; 386 
Supplementary Figure 3F). 387 
Further  associations are in Supplementary Table 11 (Supplementary Figure 4). 388

4. Discussion  389 
The present study explored auditory sensory phenotypes and their relation to hyper - 390 
focus and inattention in autistic, ADHD,  autistic+ADHD,  and general population participants.   391 
Participants filled out a multidimensional questionnaire indexing a variety of distinct forms of 392 
decreased sound tolerance, as well as questionnaires regarding auditory distractibility issues, 393 
hyper -focus , and inattention.  Furthermore, study participants  rated the pleasantness o f 394 
various sounds, including common misophonia trigger sounds.   We investigated group 395 
differences in decreased sound tolerance, auditory distractibility, and sound ratings; 396 
convergence of questionnaire -based and sound -rating -based misophonia measures; and 397 
relationships between attention and sensory phenotypes.  398 
4.1. Group Differences in Decreased Sound Tolerance and Auditory Distractibility  399 
4.2.1. Questionnaire Measures  400 
Group differences on questionnaire -based sensory measures were large and robust ; in 401 
partic ular, autistic and ADHD participants reported  more experiences of all sound tolerance 402 
problems indexed  by the MIST -A than did non-autistic and non -ADHD people .  They also 403 
reported more auditory distractibility.  404 
Moreover, there were small -to-moderate statis tical differences among the three 405 
neurodivergent groups (autistic -only, ADHD -only, and autistic+ADHD) , though these were 406 
sometimes subtler and less consistent .  As predicted by Hypothesis 1, autistic -only people 407 
reported more experiences of hyperacusis  than ADHD -only participants .  However, in 408 
supplementary analyses , this effect was not consistently maintained when higher  levels of 409 
autistic and ADHD traits were required for inclusion in the study.   Meanwhile, although 410

34 
 
Hypothesis 1 had also predicted more misophonia in autistic than ADHD -only participants ; 411 
however, autistic -only and ADHD -only participants did not statistically differ in  their reported 412 
MIST -A experiences of anger/ Misophonia  (which largely excluded the influences of co -occurrin g 413 
hyperacusis) . 414 
Interestingly , while  we had expected to find more auditory distractibility issues in ADHD  415 
than autism , due to  the overlap between auditory distractibility and ADHD traits, this 416 
hypothesis – Hypothesis 2 – was not supported by the data.  There was even a trend for 417 
autistic -only people to report more  susceptibility to auditory distraction than ADHD -only 418 
people . 419 
Patterns on other subscales were similar: in the analysis presented in the main text, 420 
autistic -only people reported more auditory pain  relative to ADHD -only participants, but these 421 
effects were not consistently maintained in supplementary analyses with more stringent 422 
inclusion criteria.  ADHD -only and autistic -only people did not differ in proneness to auditory 423 
fear/ panic . 424 
In general, then, sensory questionnaire scores  seem ed to highlight  similarities between 425 
autism and ADHD,  and appear ed consistent with the idea that sensory discomfort and distress 426 
could be an important transdiagnostic phenotype in multiple neurodevelopment al disabilities.  427 
However , statistical differences between autistic+ADHD people and all other groups 428 
were clearer.  Autistic+ADHD people reported the greatest sound tolerance challenges on most  429 
scales , such as the MIST -A Hyperacusis  experiences scale , even compared to autistic -only and 430 
ADHD -only participants, and these effects were largely maintained in supplementary analyses 431 
with different inclusion /exclusion criteria.   While interactions imply the effects  of autism and 432

35 
 
ADHD are not strictly additive /cumulative , their sensory impact s certainly appear to build on 433 
one another.  Whether this appears to be an effect of “general neurological disability” or a more 434 
specific factor that can be traced to a common autism, ADHD, or neurodevelopmentally -linked 435 
etiology remains to be seen and shou ld be the subject of future research into individual 436 
differences.  437 
4.2.2. Sound Ratings  438 
We also explored sensory phenotypes by asking participants to rate the pleasantness of 439 
short sounds canonically considered to be misophonia triggers, pleasant sounds, o r unpleasant 440 
sounds . 441 
Ratings of canonical misophonia triggers were used to derive Core Discriminant Sound  442 
Misophonia (CDS -M) scores, with nonzero  scores reflecting ratings of specific sounds that 443 
exceeded the 75% quantile of non -misophonic general population participants ’ ratings .  As one 444 
might expect, CDS -M scores were elevated in misophonic participants  compared to non - 445 
misophonic participants , suggesting that misophonic participants’ self -identifications were 446 
valid.   This effect was obtained even though chewing sounds, a common misophonia trigger, 447 
were deleted from the CDS -M battery due to non -misophonic participants frequently also 448 
reporting negative (albeit less negative) reactions to them.  Apropos thereof , after reading a 449 
definition of misophoni a, participants in the neurodivergent groups were more likely than 450 
comparison participants to  identify themselves as misophonic , and autistic participants were 451 
more likely to identify as misophonic than ADHD -only participants.   However, interestingly, 452 
ADHD  people also had higher CDS -M scores than non -ADHD people, controlling for self - 453 
reported misophonia status .  While this effect was not consistently maintained in all 454

36 
 
supplementary analyses with altered inclusion criteria,  it does imply that ADHD people mig ht 455 
sometimes experience misophoni c symptoms without identifying themselves as misophonic , 456 
even if they are exposed to information about misophonia.   When  we examined specific types 457 
of misophonic trigger sound s, ADHD  affected  CDS scores for breathing/nasal sounds , and an 458 
effect of autism on CDS scores for repetitive sounds, such as a pen clicking.  459 
We also examined responses to canonically pleasant and unple asant sounds.  460 
Interestingly, autistic people rated canonically pleasant sounds (e.g., ocean  sounds, bird 461 
chirping) more negatively than non -autistic people.  In prior research , people with hyperacusis 462 
have rated pleasant sounds negatively (Enzler, Fournier, et al., 2021) ; however, as participants 463 
themselves set  the intensities of sound presentation in the present study, loudness discomfort 464 
was probably  not the  main cause of these negative ratings.   A seemingly more plausible 465 
explanat ion might be  idiosyncratic , misophonia -like reactions to  certain canonically -pleasant 466 
sound s in some autistic people , with participants finding them irritating or uncomfortable.   467 
However, per  the correlation matrix in  Supplementary Table 4, there were trends 468 
(nonsignificant after correction) for autistic -only people who rated misophonic sounds 469 
negatively to rate canonically -pleasant sounds more positively.   Future studies , carefully  470 
controlling the intensity of present ed stimuli , will be better -suited to investigate why autistic 471 
people had less enthusiastic reactions to pleasant sounds.  472 
4.3. Convergence of Sound Ratings and Questionnaires  473 
We examined associations between  CDS-M scores and MIST -A Misophonia scores , 474 
findin g positive correlations in all four groups, as predicted by Hypothesis 3 .  Nevertheless , 475 
these correlations were only modest in size ; they did not support the convergent validity of the 476

37 
 
two measures .  The correlation coefficients were also smaller than tho se reported in prior 477 
research (Enzler, Loriot, et al., 2021) . It is possible that this reflects our use of the misophonia 478 
subscale of a multidimensional sound tolerance questionnaire, rather than a misophonia - 479 
specific tool, and the lack of chewing sounds in the CDS misophonia scores from the present 480 
study .  Additional ly, while Enzler et al.’s study was primarily focused on misophonia, the 481 
present study aimed to understand auditory processing and attention more generally in 482 
neurodivergent groups  recruited from registries .  Many participants still reported misophonia, 483 
but it is possible that their misophonia phenotypes were less extreme  than a self -selected 484 
online sample , which might have attenuated correlations.  Regardless, the limited  convergence 485 
emphasizes both the difficulty and the importance of reconciling sensory measures from 486 
different modalities  (Uljarević et al., 2017) .  Future studies incorporating more misophonia - 487 
specific tools may be better able to clarify the relationships between measures; future studies 488 
should also consider extending the duration of sounds and/ or presenting trigger sounds 489 
alongside  other stimuli , more closely replicating real -world conditions.  490 
4.4. Attention and Sensory Phenotypes  491 
Finally, the present study examined whether decreased sound tolerance and auditory 492 
distractibility were associated with reports of hyper -focus and inattention.  493 
As predicted by Hypothesis 4, there were robust associations between attention scores 494 
and scores on questionnaire measures of decreased sound tolerance and auditory 495 
distractibility.   When we used partial correlations to examine specific links between hyper -focus 496 
and sensory phenotypes, controlling for inattention, and vice versa, we found unique significant 497 
associations of both hyper -focus and inattention with different sensory response patterns in 498

38 
 
different groups , especially among neurodiverg ent participants .  This supports the idea that 499 
hyper -focus and inattention can each be involved in experiences of sensory discomfort and 500 
distraction.   As noted by the developers of the monotropism account, hyper -focus ing on 501 
unpleasant stimuli might lead to  sensory distress and decreased sound tolerance (Murray et al., 502 
2005) .  Meanwhile, a susceptibility to inattention and distraction might incr ease people’s 503 
chances of noticing unpleasant or uncomfortable stimuli in their environments.   Further 504 
research could endeavour to better understand the precise nature of these relationships by 505 
using cognitive and developmental tasks to isolate more specifi c attentional processes and 506 
phenotypes that could be involved in  both  neurodivergent sensory experiences  and 507 
experiences of hyper -focus and/ or inattention , such as attention disengagement (Baranek et 508 
al., 2018)  or salience -driven attention capture . 509 
Interestingly , while  the present study was not intended to compare sensory -attention 510 
associations across groups, we visually noted that associations between hyper -focus and 511 
decreased sound tolerance seemed strongly  evident in autistic+ADHD participants ; links 512 
between inattention and decreased sound tolerance  seemed weak  in that group .  Contributions 513 
of hyper -focus and inattention appe ared more balanced in autistic -only and ADHD -only 514 
participants ; in some cases, their respective effects appeared to cancel one another out in 515 
partial correlation analyses , which could be interpreted to suggest the influence  of a shared  516 
underlying  atypical regulation of attention.   Conversely, in the comparison group, only 517 
experiences of auditory fear/panic and auditory distractibility were significantly related to 518 
attention measures ; experiences of hyperacusis and misophonia were not significantly related 519 
to hyper -focus and inattention.   This could reflect the more restricted range of auditory distress 520

39 
 
scores in comparison participants, or it could suggest that attention is more heavily involved in 521 
experiences of auditory distress within autism and ADHD than  outside them.  522 
There was one way in which Hypothesis 4  was not supported: t he present study did not 523 
observe associations between attention measures and CDS scores .  This raises the possibility 524 
that the observed associations among  the sensory and attention  questionnaire measures might  525 
have reflected shared variance due to the  common  method  (Choi & Pak, 2005) ; for example, 526 
some participa nts may have been biased  to use certain ranges of  response options on  Likert - 527 
type  questions.   Fortunately, the MIST -A and AHQ both have clearly -defined response options 528 
(e.g., an experience arises 1 -2 times per month) , which may reduce the subjectivity of 529 
responses .  Instead,  a key factor may be that the attention and sensory questionnaires both 530 
invited participants to reflect on their real -world experiences.  Real -world environments are 531 
often complex and multisensory, and people are often  simultaneously presented with  many 532 
different possible targets of attention .  In contrast, the sound rating tasks presented 533 
participants with a single stimulus at a time , so participants would have had little option but to 534 
focus their attention on that stimulus.   Includin g multiple stimuli, such as presenting 535 
misophonic triggers amidst recordings of conversations  or other stimuli , might have more 536 
closely replicated real -world conditions,  perhaps  allowing attention allocation to shape 537 
individual differences in response patt erns.  538 
4.5. Limitations  539 
Although the present study benefits from a large sample size, autistic leadership, good 540 
gender representation, specific measurement of different forms of decreased sound tolerance , 541

40 
 
and participant groups that are statistically equiva lent in key demographic characteristics , this 542 
study also has limitations.  543 
As noted in Dwyer et al.  (2024) , the online nature of this study made verifying diagnostic 544 
group assignments difficult .  ASRS -6 and RAADS -14 scores were used to exclude participants 545 
whose questionnaire responses app eared inconsistent with their reported diagnoses and 546 
identities.  However, setting inclusion and exclusion criteria was challenging .  ADHD people 547 
often obtain high RAADS -14 autistic trait scores  (Eriksson et al., 2013) , preventing us from 548 
excluding  ADHD -only participants based on  autistic traits.  To address this issue, we conducted 549 
supplementary analyses using different inclusion and exclusion criteria; we suggest that both 550 
group differences  which were not observed reasonably consistently  across th e main text , and 551 
these supplementary analyses , should be regarded with caution.  552 
Similarly, because misophonia is a relatively novel category , community access to 553 
misophonia diagnoses and information is limited , and a consensus on diagnostic assessment 554 
proc edures is lacking (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Williams, 2022) , we presented 555 
participants with a def inition of misophonia and asked them whether they considered 556 
themselves misophonic per that definition.  Due to the brevity of the definition, some 557 
participants may not have realized it applied to them, or may have misunderstood it.  We  also 558 
did not collect  any information about participants’ misophonia triggers and the overlap 559 
between these and the canonical misophonic triggers from the sound ratings task.   560 
Furthermore, we  recognize the  present study sample contains a disproportionately high  561 
number of non -Hispanic White participants, thereby contributing to the exclusion of racialized 562 
minorities from research.  Our sample also appeared unusually well -educated  and contained 563

41 
 
almost no participants with intellectual disabilities .  Thus, it is unclear how well o ur findings 564 
apply to many multiply marginalized neurodivergent communities.  Finally, the sound rating task 565 
as administered in this study is not without limitations.  Chewing sounds were so widely disliked 566 
that there was not sufficient variability to include reactions to them in the computation of 567 
misophonia scores; more nuanced stimuli might help to avoid similar ceiling effects in future 568 
research.  Moreover, participants in the sound rating task were instructed to play all sounds at 569 
a consistent level, but we cannot verify whether some participants might have adjusted their 570 
speaker volume partway through the task.  We assume that different participants likely played 571 
the sounds at different intensities from one another , but we lack information about what those 572 
intensities might have been.  573 
5. Conclusions  574 
We found evidence that both autistic and ADHD people experience much higher levels 575 
of nume rous distinct forms and consequences of decreased sound tolerance  – including 576 
misophonia, hyperacusis , fear/ panic , and auditory pain  – relative to the general population; 577 
neurodivergent participants also experienced more susceptibility to auditory distract ion.  578 
Within neurodivergent groups, st atistical d ifferences between autistic -only and ADHD -only 579 
participants sometimes appeared or disappeared depending on the inclusion criteria employed, 580 
but autistic +ADHD people  consistently  appeared to experience  more  of several kinds of  sound - 581 
induced discomfort and distress , including hyperacusis,  than autistic -only and ADHD -only 582 
people . 583 
We also observed group differences when participants completed sound rating tasks.  584 
Unsurprisingly, s elf-identified misophonic participants , who were more likely to be 585

42 
 
neurodivergent,  rated misophonic trigger sounds more negatively than non -misophonic 586 
participants .  Interestingly, autistic people also rated canonically pleasant sounds more harshly 587 
than non -autistic peop le.  Scores based on sound ratings of misophonic triggers did converge 588 
with questionnaire anger/misophonia scores, but only modestly .  We speculate that  more tasks 589 
featuring  multiple stimuli competing for attention  might converge more closely with  590 
question naire reports based on participants’ real -world experiences.  591 
Questionnaire -based measures of attention, sound tolerance, and auditory distractibility 592 
were clearly associated  in the neurodivergent groups , suggesting that hyper -focus and 593 
inattention/distractibility can  play an important role in neurodivergent people’s real -world 594 
experiences of sensory hyper -reactivity.   Participants might hyper -focus on uncomfortable or 595 
distracting stimuli, or be more likely to become distracted and be bot hered by  background 596 
sensory stimuli.  We did not observe associations between sound rating task responses and 597 
attention questionnaires, but given that the sound rating tasks present participants with only 598 
one stimulus at a time, individual differences in a ttention allocation might have little influence 599 
on sound ratings  in this study .  Adding more auditory or multisensory stimuli to such tasks may 600 
increase their realism and allow attention to play a larger role.  601

Supplementary Figures  
Supplementary Figure 1 . Linear slopes representing associations between CDS misophonia 
and MIST -A misophonia  scores.  Note that analyses in the main text use Spearman’s ordinal 
correlation, not the linear slopes depicted here (see Supplementary Figure 2  for ordinal 
slopes).  Data points are slightly jittered for display purposes.  The horizontal dotted line 
repr esents the cut -offs suggesting clinically significant levels of misophonia (i.e., T -scores of 
60 or greater).

Supplementary Figure 3. Slopes representing ordinal associations between sensory ranked variables (MIST -A sound intolerance T -scores, Panels 
A-D; VADQ auditory distractibility, Panel E; and CDS Misophonia scores, Panel F) and AHQ Dispositional Hyper -Focus (AHQ -DHF) and ASRS 
Inattention (ASRS -I).  Raw data underlying these ranks are depicted in Figure 3  from the main text. Data points are slightly jittered for display 
purposes.

61 
 
 
Supplementary Figure 4. Linear slopes representing associations between MIST -A symptoms (of hyperacusis, Panel A; and nonspecific, Panel B), 
MIST -A sound intolerance -related impairment (Panel C), median sound ratings (of misophonic triggers, Panel D; of canonically pleasant soun ds, 
Panel E; and of canonically unpleasant sounds, Panel F) and AHQ Dispositional Hyper -Focus (AHQ -DHF) and ASRS Inattention (ASRS -I).  Note that 
statistical analyses use Spearman’s ordinal correlation, not these linear slopes.  Data points are slightly ji ttered for display purposes.

Supplementary Tables  
Supplementary Table 1. 75% quantiles of ratings of misophonic trigger 
sounds (for use in computing CDS misophonia scores ) in non -autistic, 
non-ADHD participants reporting no curr ent or historical misophonia 
(n=74 with usable data).  
Sounds in cells where the 75% quantile exceeded 90 were not used 
when computing CDS scores, in order to avoid magnifying small 
differences – are shaded red.  As a result, chewing sounds did not 
appear i n the computation of the final CDS in this study.

Supplementary Analysis: Participants Excluded Due to ASRS -18 Scores  
As a further check on the validity of the results of group comparisons, considering the 
extent of diagnostic overshadowing of autism and ADHD in the community, we reran group 
comparisons w hen restricting the sample to only exclude participants whose ASRS -18 data who 
scored in the appropriate range on the ASRS -18, as well as the ASRS -6.  We used ASRS -18 scores 
as calculated using “Method 4” as described by Kessler et al. (2005) , in which item responses 
are collapsed into binary scores reflecting the presence or absence of the given behaviour; 
ADHD -only and autistic+ADHD participants were req uired to receive an ASRS -18 “Method 4” 
score at least or exceeding the cut -off of 9, while autistic -only and comparison participants 
were required to score below 9.  This yielded a reduced sample of 95 ADHD -only (7 
CloudResearch, 88 Prolific), 110 autistic +ADHD (28 Prolific, 82 SPARK), 89 autistic -only (27 
Prolific, 62 SPARK), and 88 comparison (8 CloudResearch, 80 Prolific) participants.  
In the revised sample autistic+ADHD participants had slightly higher RAADS -14 scores 
than autistic -only participants, wh ich was not the case in the original sample (Supplementary 
Table 12, cf. Table 1 in main text).  
The pattern of significant group differences on sound tolerance measures – particularly 
the MIST -A and the VADQ – appeared to change.  As shown in Supplementary  Table 13 (cf. 
Table 2 in main text, Supplementary Table 10), restricting the sample based on ASRS -18 scores 
appeared to relatively increase sound tolerance problems in autistic+ADHD and ADHD -only 
participants compared to autistic -only participants, thereb y altering the pattern of statistical 
differences among the neurodivergent groups.  All statistical differences between ADHD -only 
and autistic -only participants disappeared, while autistic+ADHD participants began to score

75 
 
significantly higher than autistic -only participants on several further scales.  These changes are 
not necessarily surprising, as restricting the ADHD samples based on ASRS scores would have 
eliminated participants with less obvious ADHD features, while eliminating participants with 
high A SRS scores in the autistic -only group might have eliminated participants with some of the 
most obvious neurodivergence.  Perhaps similarly, an effect of ADHD on CDS mouth sound 
scores achieved significance in the revised sample (Supplementary Table 14), bu t not in the 
main text (Table 3).

Supplementary Analysis: Further Participants Excluded Due to RAADS -14 Scores  
As noted in the main text, the median RAADS -14 score of ADHD people exceeded the 
autism cut -off score even in the validation sample (Eriksson et al., 2013) , as well as in the 
present study.  Thus, eliminating ADHD -only participants scoring above the autism cut -off 
would remove the majority of ADHD -only participants, and would be unlikely to yield a 
representative sample of ADHD people.  Nevertheless, for exploratory and descriptive 
purposes, we took the previou sly-described reduced sample (as restricted based on ASRS -18 
scores) and eliminated ADHD participants scoring above the autism screening cut -off on the 
RAADS -14.  This reduced the ADHD -only sample to just 22 participants (3 CloudResearch, 19 
Prolific), fro m the 95 in the previously -described reduced sample.  
This further -reduced ADHD -only sample had significantly more educated participants 
than in the autistic+ADHD group (Supplementary Table 15), which was not the case of the 
original sample in the main text  nor of the previously -described reduced sample (Table 1, 
Supplementary Table 12).  They had significantly lower ASRS -18 inattention scores than 
autistic+ADHD participants, but their hyperactivity/impulsivity scores no longer significantly 
differed from th ose of autistic+ADHD participants.  The proportion of ADHD -only participants 
self-reporting misophonia appeared lower than in prior analyses (Supplementary Table 15, cf. 
Table 1, Supplementary Table 12), and the proportion no longer significantly differed from that 
in comparison participants.  
Eliminating ADHD participants with high RAADS -14 scores affected results of 
comparisons of sound tolerance measures across groups (Supplementary Table 16, cf. Table 2, 
Supplementary Tables 10, 13).  Interactions of ADH D and autism on many MIST -A subscores

82 
 
disappeared; this appeared to reflect declines in ADHD -only participants’ MIST -A scores relative 
to autistic+ADHD and autistic -only participants, as well as loss of sample size and statistical 
power.  However, the use of ASRS -18 scores to restrict the sample had previously caused 
ADHD -only participants’ sensory questionnaire scores to increase relative to autistic -only 
participants (compare Table 2 and Supplementary Table 10 with Supplementary Table 13), so 
these declin es to some extent acted to offset the previous increase.  For example, statistical 
differences between ADHD -only and autistic -only participants’ MIST -A impairment scores that 
had appeared in Supplementary Table 10, then disappeared when ASRS -18 scores were  used to 
restrict the sample (Supplementary Table 3), reappeared when ADHD -only participants with 
high RAADS scores were excluded (Supplementary Table 16).  
Effects of ADHD on total and breathing/nasal sound CDS scores dropped below the
