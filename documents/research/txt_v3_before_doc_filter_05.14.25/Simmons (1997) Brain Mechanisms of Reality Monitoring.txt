Brain  Mechanisms  of  Reality
Monitoring
Jon  S.  Simons,1,*Jane  R.  Garrison,1and  Marcia  K.  Johnson2
Reality  monitoring  processes  are  necessary  for  discriminating  between  inter-
nally  generated  information  and  information  that  originated  in  the  outside
world.  They  help  us  to  identify  our  thoughts,  feelings,  and  imaginations,  and
to  distinguish  them  from  events  we  may  have  experienced  or  have  been  told
about  by  someone  else.  Reality  monitoring  errors  range  from  confusions
between  real  and  imagined  experiences,  that  are  byproducts  of  normal  cogni-
tion,  to  symptoms  of  mental  illness  such  as  hallucinations.  Recent  advances
support  an  emerging  neurocognitive  characterization  of  reality  monitoring  that
provides  insights  into  its  underlying  operating  principles  and  neural  mecha-
nisms,  the  differing  ways  in  which  impairment  may  occur  in  health  and  disease,
and  the  potential  for  rehabilitation  strategies  to  be  devised  that  might  help
those  who  experience  clinically  signi ﬁcant  reality  monitoring  disruption.
How  Do  We  Know  What  Is  Real?
Thinking  back  over  your  life,  you  can  often  ﬁnd  yourself  mentally  transported  back  in  time,
reliving  a  past  episode,  sometimes  in  vivid  detail.  Except  –  how  do  you  know  that  you  were
actually  there  when  the  event  originally  took  place?  How  can  you  be  sure  that  you  are
remembering  a  faithful  representation  of  what  happened,  as  opposed  to  an  event  you  might
have  previously  imagined,  or  a  story  told  to  you  by  someone  else?  In  short,  how  do  you
determine  whether  your  memories  are  real?
One  prominent  theory,  the  Source  Monitoring  Framework,  proposes  that  there  are  decision
processes  involved  in  making  attributions  about  the  origin  of  information  that  comes  to  mind,
including  discriminating  information  that  was  generated  by  internal  cognitive  functions,  such  as
thought  and  imagination,  from  information  that  was  derived  from  the  outside  world  by  per-
ceptual  processes  (‘reality  monitoring ’  [1,2]).  According  to  this  framework,  memories  do  not
contain  propositional  tags  that  directly  specify  their  source.  Instead,  we  make  attributions  about
the  origin  of  a  mental  experience  by  considering  its  features  in  light  of  assumptions  about  the
characteristics  that  tend  to  be  associated  with  various  sources.  For  example,  a  person  might
infer  that  an  apparent  ‘memory ’  rich  in  visuoperceptual  detail  is  likely  to  be  real  (‘I  can  remember
what  the  dentist ’s  ofﬁce  looked  like ’  [3])  whereas  one  comprising  mainly  traces  of  internally
generated  thoughts  might  instead  have  been  imagined  (‘I  could  remember  I  had  a  very  speci ﬁc
reason  for  making  the  association ’;  ‘I  made  the  decision  by  knowing  what  my  train  of  thought
was  during  the  exercise ’  [4]).
Reality  monitoring  errors  tend  to  involve  misidentifying  internally  generated  events  as  being  real,
for  example  misattributing  particularly  vivid  imaginations  to  perception,  or  assuming  that  the
absence  of  memory  for  cognitive  operations  indicates  that  a  memory  is  unlikely  to  have  been
self-generated  [4],  although  misattributions  in  the  other  direction  also  occur,  such  as  in
cryptomnesia  [5].  Similarity  between  potential  sources  increases  the  likelihood  of  source  errors
[6].  For  example,  misattribution  errors  are  more  common  for  auditory  than  visual  stimuli,Trends
Mounting  evidence  identi ﬁes  anterior
prefrontal  cortex  as  playing  a  key  role
in  reality  monitoring,  the  ability  to  dis-
tinguish  internally  from  externally  gen-
erated  information.
Individual  differences  in  reality
monitoring  performance  in  healthy
volunteers  are  associated  with  varia-
bility  in  functional  activity  and  structural
morphology  in  this  region  of  the  brain.
Differences  are  also  seen  in  clinical
conditions  such  as  schizophrenia,  in
which  people  sometimes  experience
disturbed  awareness  of  what  is  real.
Dysfunction  in  anterior  prefrontal  cor-
tex  increases  vulnerability  to  misiden-
tify  internally  generated  information  as
external  in  origin,  providing  a  possible
neurocognitive  basis  for  psychiatric
symptoms  such  as  hallucinations.

perhaps  because  ‘inner  speech ’  and  real  speech  tend  to  be  more  similar  than  visual  imagery
and  actual  visual  perceptions  and,  hence,  are  more  vulnerable  to  confusion  [7].  It  is  important  to
note  that  the  features  that  are  activated  when  a  ‘target ’  memory  is  cued  are  determined  by
processes  engaged  during  encoding  of  the  event  (e.g.,  the  quality  of  feature  binding),  during  the
interval  between  the  initial  event  and  the  act  of  ‘remembering ’  (e.g.,  the  number  of  reactiva-
tions),  and  during  retrieval  (e.g.,  the  cue  eliciting  the  memory).  In  addition,  features  from  other
events  can  be  activated  at  any  point,  potentially  inﬂuencing  the  characteristics  of  the  remem-
bered  event  [8].  In  addition  to  the  phenomenal  qualities  of  mental  experiences,  reality  monitor-
ing  may  also  involve  explicit  retrieval  of  supporting  or  conﬂicting  information,  and  may  be
inﬂuenced  by  prior  knowledge,  beliefs,  and  motives  [9].  Thus,  there  are  multiple  factors
operating  during  encoding  and  retrieval,  as  well  as  in  the  intervening  period,  that  can  produce
source  misattributions  in  healthy  individuals,  and  multiple  ways  that  processes  can  be  dis-
rupted  in  clinical  populations.
In  the  past  few  years  a  number  of  laboratories  around  the  world  have  explored  the  brain
mechanisms  underlying  reality  monitoring  processes  using  cognitive  neuroscience  methods
including  functional  brain  imaging  of  healthy  volunteers  and  studies  of  neurological,  psychiatric,
and  developmental  disorders,  as  well  as  of  normal  aging  [10].  The  aim  has  been  to  understand
how  the  brain  supports  our  capacity  to  determine  the  sources  of  mental  experiences,  including
distinguishing  what  is  real  from  what  we  have  imagined,  an  ability  that  is  vital  for  maintaining
conﬁdence  in  our  memories,  and  in  understanding  ourselves  as  individuals  in  the  world  with  a
past  and  a  future.  In  characterizing  how  these  processes  might  be  instantiated  in  the  brain,  we
can  better  understand  the  way  in  which  they  may  break  down  in  disorders  such  as  schizo-
phrenia,  in  which  a  person ’s  relation  to  reality  can  be  altered  in  ways  that  disrupt  their  everyday
functioning.
Anterior  Prefrontal  Cortex  (PFC)  and  Reality  Monitoring
Neuropsychological  and  neuroimaging  studies  have  identi ﬁed  a  network  of  brain  regions
involved  in  the  recollection  of  source  information,  which  include  prefrontal,  medial  temporal,
and  parietal  cortices  [10 –12].  In  broad  terms,  regions  of  PFC  are  thought  to  provide  cognitive
control  over  the  encoding  and  retrieval  of  feature  representations  that  are  bound  together  in  a
spatial  frame  by  the  hippocampus  and  further  integrated  by  parietal  cortex  into  a  ﬁrst-person
perspective  that  supports  the  subjective  experience  of  remembering  [9,13] .  The  role  of  the  PFC
appears  to  be  particularly  crucial  for  source  memory,  and  lesions  to  the  frontal  lobes  typically
cause  severe  difﬁculties  with  the  recollection  of  such  contextual  details  even  when  old/new  item
recognition  is  unimpaired  [14,15] .  Distinct  prefrontal  regions  may  make  separable  functional
contributions  to  source  memory  [11],  with  ventrolateral  PFC  subregions  linked  to  the  speci ﬁ-
cation  of  retrieval  cues  and  the  maintenance  of  retrieved  information,  and  the  dorsolateral  PFC
exhibiting  activity  during  post-retrieval  monitoring  [16 –18].
One  region  that  has  emerged  as  playing  a  key  role  in  reality  monitoring  is  the  anterior  PFC,  an
area  right  at  the  front  of  the  brain  that,  in  relative  terms,  is  roughly  twice  as  large  in  the  human
brain  than  in  even  the  great  apes  [19].  It  has  lower  cellular  density  and  higher  dendritic
complexity  than  comparable  cortical  regions  [20],  and  is  thought  to  be  among  the  last  areas
to  achieve  myelination  [21],  enabling  nerve  cells  to  transmit  information  more  rapidly  and
facilitating  more  complex  cognitive  abilities.  As  such,  although  the  functions  performed  by  this
area  are  not  well  understood,  they  have  generally  been  considered  likely  to  be  among  the
‘higher ’  levels  of  human  complex  cognition  [21 –24].  The  role  played  by  the  anterior  PFC  in
memory  has  been  difﬁcult  to  characterize.  Several  neuroimaging  experiments  published  in  the
early  2000s  reported  activation  in  this  region  during  the  recollection  of  source  details
[16,18,25,26] ,  but  this  was  not  consistently  observed  [17,27,28] .  An  absence  of  anterior
PFC  activity  could  of  course  always  be  attributable  to  insuf ﬁcient  experimental  power  or  to
Trends  in  Cognitive  Sciences,  June  2017,  Vol.  21,  No.  6  463

susceptibility  in  the  fMRI  signal  owing  to  the  proximity  of  the  anterior  PFC  to  the  sinus  area.
However,  another  hypothesis  is  that  the  discrepancy  between  studies  might  have  arisen
because  the  types  of  information  that  participants  were  being  asked  to  remember  differed
according  to  whether  the  information  had  been  generated  internally  or  externally  at  the  time  of
encoding  [29].
In  the  past  decade  or  so  this  hypothesis  has  been  tested  by  a  number  of  experiments  from
different  laboratories  that  have  manipulated  the  recollection  of  internally  generated  and  exter-
nally  derived  source  details  (Figure  1).  Although  there  is  some  variability  in  the  patterns  of  activity
elicited  by  such  tasks,  these  studies  have  consistently  identi ﬁed  the  medial  aspect  of  the
anterior  PFC  in  particular  as  exhibiting  differential  activity  during  the  retrieval  of  internal  versus
external  aspects  of  context  (Figure  2).  For  example,  medial  anterior  PFC  responses  distinguish
recollection  of  the  encoding  task  undertaken  compared  to  remembering  where  on  the  screen
[29 –31]  or  when  in  time  [32,33]  stimuli  were  presented,  or  remembering  the  size  in  which  they
were  displayed  [25,34] .  The  same  region  is  involved  in  remembering  whether  verbal  phrases
were  previously  presented  in  full  on  the  screen  (e.g.,  ‘bacon  and  eggs ’),  or  whether  a  word  was
missing  which  participants  needed  to  imagine  (e.g.,  ‘bacon  and  ?’)  to  complete  the  phrase

themselves  [30,35] .  Likewise,  medial  anterior  PFC  is  differentially  engaged  during  recollection
of  whether  a  visual  object  was  previously  seen  or  imagined  by  participants  [36],  as  well  as  when
judging  whether  oneself  or  another  person  performed  a  particular  action  with  stimuli  [37 –39].
The  sensitivity  of  this  region  to  reality  monitoring  distinctions  is  apparent  regardless  of  whether
words,  faces,  or  objects  are  being  remembered  [29,32,34,36] ,  suggesting  that  the  effect  is
independent  of  stimulus  type.  Moreover,  medial  anterior  activation  has  been  observed  irre-
spective  of  whether  the  ‘internal ’  or  ‘external ’  condition  is  associated  with  lower  recollection
accuracy  and  longer  response  times,  or  vice  versa,  or  whether  such  behavioral  factors  are
matched  between  conditions  [29,32] ,  suggesting  that  an  account  in  terms  of  differential  task
difﬁculty  is  unlikely  to  be  sufﬁcient.  Possible  explanations  of  the  observed  activity  include  that
medial  anterior  PFC  represents  records  of  cognitive  operations  involved  in  self-generation,  or  is
involved  in  self-referential  processing  or  self-representation,  or  that  the  region  operates  as  a
gateway,  biasing  attention  between  self-generated  and  externally  generated  information,
irrespective  of  whether  that  information  is  experienced  currently  or  in  the  past  [21,40] .
Not  everyone  exhibits  perfect  reality  monitoring  performance,  of  course.  Performance  varies
considerably  even  in  apparently  healthy  individuals,  with  some  people  reliably  able  to  distin-
guish  internally  from  externally  generated  stimuli  whereas  others  perform  closer  to  chance
levels  [41].  Consistent  with  the  functional  neuroimaging  evidence  discussed  above,  recent
research  points  to  these  individual  differences  as  having  a  speci ﬁc  brain  structural  basis  in  the
medial  PFC.  One  structural  landmark  in  this  region  of  the  brain  that  exhibits  considerable
morphological  variability  within  the  general  population  is  the  paracingulate  sulcus  (PCS),  which
lies  dorsal  and  parallel  to  the  cingulate  sulcus  (Figure  3).  The  PCS,  which  is  prominent  in  roughly
half  of  the  normal  population,  is  a  tertiary  sulcus,  one  of  the  last  structural  folds  to  develop
before  birth  and,  due  to  a  combination  of  genetic  and  environmental  inﬂuences,  varies
considerably  in  size  between  individuals  [42].  This  brain  structure  variation  appears  to  be
linked  to  reality  monitoring  ability:  healthy,  apparently  cognitively  intact,  adults  whose  MRI
scans  indicate  bilateral  absence  of  the  PCS  are  signi ﬁcantly  less  accurate  in  reality  monitoring
decisions  than  people  with  a  prominent  PCS  on  at  least  one  side  of  the  brain  [41].  PCS
reductions  are  typically  associated  with  increased  grey  matter  volume  in  the  surrounding
anterior  cingulate  cortex  [43]  and,  consistent  with  this  observation,  voxel-based  analyses
reveal  that  reality  monitoring  performance  correlates  negatively  with  medial  PFC  volume
[41].  Reduced  sulcal  folding  and  increased  surrounding  cortical  volume  may  reﬂect  weakened
local  and  long-range  connectivity,  according  to  theories  of  morphogenesis  [44,45] .  These
ﬁndings  thus  suggest  an  explanation  for  individual  differences  in  reality  monitoring  ability  as
reﬂecting,  in  part,  variations  in  connectivity  between  the  medial  PFC  and  other  cortical  regions
involved  in  processing  the  sensory/perceptual  and  other  features  that  constitute  our  memories.

Reality  Monitoring  in  Schizophrenia
One  of  the  applications  of  the  work  seeking  to  characterize  the  brain  mechanisms  of  reality
monitoring  has  been  to  inform  understanding  of  the  cognitive  dysfunction  seen  in  clinical
conditions  such  as  schizophrenia.  Although  schizophrenia  can  vary  in  its  presentation,  among
the  positive  symptoms  often  observed  are  hallucinations,  such  as  hearing  voices  when  none
are  present.  For  example,  a  person  with  schizophrenia  might  imagine  a  voice  conveying  a
speci ﬁc  message,  and  misidentify  that  voice  as  being  real,  coming  from  another  person.
Hallucinations  also  occur  in  other  psychiatric  conditions  including  bipolar  disorder,  major
depressive  disorder,  borderline  or  schizotypal  personality  disorder,  post-traumatic  stress
disorder,  and  dissociative  identity  disorder  [46 –48],  but  affect  between  60%  and  80%  of
patients  with  a  schizophrenia  diagnosis  [49,50] .  Auditory  and  visual  hallucinations  are  the
most  common  forms,  with  a  prevalence  of  around  59%  and  27%  in  schizophrenia,  respectively
[51],  but  olfactory,  tactile,  somatic,  and  gustatory  hallucinations  have  also  been  reported
[52 –54].  Activity  associated  with  hallucinations  is  often  observed  in  sensory  processing  areas,
such  as  the  superior  temporal  gyrus  during  auditory  hallucinations  and  extrastriate  cortex
during  visual  hallucinations  [55],  suggesting  that  separable  modality-speci ﬁc  impairments
contribute  to  different  types  of  hallucinations  across  patients.  One  possibility  is  that  halluci-
nations  primarily  reﬂect  unusually  vivid  internally  generated  experiences  represented  in  one  or
more  of  these  modality-speci ﬁc  processing  areas,  experiences  that  are  so  vivid  that  they  seem
to  be  external  events.  In  addition,  it  is  possible  that  hallucinations  may  in  part  result  from  a  more
central  difﬁculty  in  discriminating  between  perceived  and  imagined  information,  perhaps

because  self-generated  events  have  attenuated  or  missing  records  of  the  cognitive  or  motor
operations  that  produced  them  [56].
Despite  the  interpretational  complexities  inherent  in  studying  a  heterogeneous  syndrome  such
as  schizophrenia,  a  number  of  predictions  have  been  tested  that  arise  from  the  hypothesis
linking  disrupted  reality  monitoring  with  hallucinations,  and  the  assumption  that  some  common
processes  are  involved  in  distinguishing  reality  from  imagination  both  retrospectively  and  in  real
time.  One  prediction  is  that  individuals  with  schizophrenia  should  be  impaired  on  seen  versus
imagined  memory  tasks  that  have  been  shown  to  elicit  anterior  PFC  activity  in  healthy
volunteers.  Of  20  studies  of  reality  monitoring  in  schizophrenia  surveyed  for  this  article  (Table  1),
involving  a  total  of  700  patients  and  505  controls,  19  studies  reported  impaired  reality
monitoring  in  the  patients,  including  four  studies  in  which  the  deﬁcit  was  found  to  be  speci ﬁc
to  reality  monitoring,  with  item  recognition  memory  being  preserved  [57 –60].  A  second
prediction,  if  hallucinations  result  from  misidentifying  imagined  stimuli  as  being  real,  is  that
an  externalization  bias  should  be  observed  in  schizophrenia  during  reality  monitoring  perfor-
mance,  with  more  errors  on  self-generated  than  externally  generated  trials,  and  that  this  bias
should  be  greater  in  patients  with  schizophrenia  who  experience  hallucinations  than  in  those
who  do  not.  Of  the  four  studies  reporting  a  speci ﬁc  reality  monitoring  impairment  in  schizo-
phrenia,  three  noted  that  the  deﬁcit  only  (or  disproportionately)  involved  the  misidenti ﬁcation  of
internally  generated  stimuli  as  having  been  externally  generated  [58 –60].  Furthermore,  all  ﬁve
studies  that  compared  reality  monitoring  in  patients  with  and  without  hallucinations,  and
measured  externalization  bias,  observed  a  greater  likelihood  of  misidentifying  internally  gener-
ated  stimuli  as  being  real  in  the  patients  who  experienced  hallucinations  ([57,61 –64],  see  also
[65,66]  for  previous  reviews  highlighting  such  associations).
A  third  prediction  is  that  the  anterior  PFC  region  activated  in  healthy  volunteers  during  reality
monitoring  performance  should  be  among  the  areas  that  are  dysfunctional  in  patients  with
schizophrenia.  Consistent  with  this  prediction,  the  anterior  PFC  region  linked  to  reality  moni-
toring  in  healthy  volunteers  overlaps  closely  [30]  with  one  of  the  areas  that  consistently  exhibit
reduced  activity  in  patients  with  schizophrenia  compared  with  controls  during  performance  of  a
range  of  cognitive  tasks  [67 –71].  Moreover,  lower  anterior  PFC  activity  in  healthy  individuals
during  reality  monitoring  correlates  with  proneness  to  psychosis  and  schizotypal  trait  expres-
sion  [37],  an  effect  that  is  also  observed  in  adolescents  at  risk  of  developing  schizophrenia  [72],
suggesting  its  potential  as  a  possible  marker  in  young  people  of  those  with  heightened
likelihood  of  converting  from  prodromal  to  full  psychosis  [73].
A  fourth  prediction  is  that  healthy  volunteers  who  exhibit  reduced  levels  of  activity  in  anterior
PFC  should  make  more  of  the  externalization  misattribution  errors  often  observed  in  schizo-
phrenia.  Accordingly,  analysis  of  activity  in  the  anterior  PFC  across  participants  during  reality
monitoring  performance  has  revealed  a  signi ﬁcant  negative  correlation  with  the  likelihood  of
mistakenly  endorsing  imagined  items  as  having  been  seen  [30].  A  ﬁfth  prediction  is  that  patients
with  schizophrenia  should  exhibit  disproportionately  reduced  activity  in  anterior  PFC  during
performance  of  reality  monitoring  tasks,  an  effect  that  has  been  reported  in  three  studies  to  date
[60,74,112] ,  and  which  may  be  partly  ameliorated  by  cognitive  training  interventions  [74]
(although  this  latter  possibility  requires  replication  in  larger  samples).  A  sixth  prediction,  if
hallucinations  in  schizophrenia  are  attributable  to  overstimulation  of  sensory  processing  areas
and  reality  monitoring  dysfunction,  is  that  altered  functional  connectivity  should  be  observed
between  posterior  sensory  cortices  and  anterior  PFC.  Accordingly,  several  studies  have
reported  impaired  functional  integration  between  superior  temporal  cortex  and  medial  regions
of  anterior  PFC  associated  with  misattribution  by  patients  with  schizophrenia  of  their  own
speech  as  that  of  somebody  else  [75,76] .  Finally,  based  on  the  speci ﬁc  structural  basis  for
reality  monitoring  identi ﬁed  in  the  PCS  [41],  hallucinations  in  schizophrenia  should  be

associated  with  differences  in  PCS  morphology,  among  other  areas.  Providing  support  for  this
prediction,  a  quantitative  measure  of  PCS  length  has  been  shown  to  be  capable  of  distinguish-
ing  not  only  patients  with  schizophrenia  from  healthy  controls  [77],  but  also  patients  who  have
experienced  hallucinations  from  patients  with  no  history  of  such  symptoms  (Figure  3)  [78].  The
PCS  reduction  in  patients  with  hallucinations  appears  to  be  evident  irrespective  of  the  sensory
modality  in  which  they  were  experienced  (e.g.,  auditory,  visual,  tactile,  olfactory),  consistent
with  the  observation  described  above  that  healthy  volunteers  exhibit  anterior  PFC  activity
during  reality  monitoring  regardless  of  the  type  of  stimuli  being  remembered  [29,32,34,36] .Table  1.  Studies  of  Reality  Monitoring  in  Schizophrenia

Reality  Monitoring  and  Hallucinations
These  ﬁndings  provide  evidence  that  reality  monitoring  impairment  may  be  a  key  component  of
the  cognitive  basis  for  the  hallucinations  experienced  by  many  patients  with  schizophrenia.
However,  it  is  not  only  people  with  a  mental  health  diagnosis  who  experience  hallucinations.
Approximately  1%  of  the  general  population  report  hearing  voices  when  no  speaker  is  present,
but  do  not  seek  professional  help  or  receive  a  clinical  diagnosis  [79].  Phenomenally,  the  auditory
hallucination  experience  tends  to  be  similar  in  clinical  and  non-clinical  voice-hearers  in  terms  of
loudness,  involvement  of  others ’  voices,  number  of  voices,  and  so  forth,  but  can  differ  in
frequency,  duration,  and  content,  with  patients  typically  experiencing  negative  voices  whereas
non-clinical  individuals  are  sometimes  more  likely  to  report  neutral  or  pleasant  content  to  their
hallucinations  [80 –82].  Recent  interest  has  focused  on  whether  there  might  be  a  common
neurocognitive  basis  for  hallucinations  in  clinical  and  non-clinical  groups.  If  reduced  reality
monitoring  ability  is  part  of  the  explanation  for  the  hallucinations  observed  in  schizophrenia,  can
it  also  account  for  the  symptoms  experienced  by  non-clinical  voice-hearers?
Evidence  consistent  with  a  common  underlying  mechanism  comes  from  one  study  of  reality
monitoring  in  healthy  volunteers  which  found  that  participants  who  were  prone  to  experience
hallucinations  were  more  likely  than  other  participants  to  misidentify  self-generated  words  as
having  been  spoken  by  the  experimenter  [83].  However,  two  more  recent  studies  involving
healthy  individuals  with  a  proneness  to  hallucinations  found  no  evidence  of  an  impairment  in
source  or  reality  monitoring,  or  of  an  increased  externalization  bias,  in  such  non-clinical  voice-
hearers  [84,85] .  Evidence  from  neuroimaging  suggests  common  hallucination-related  activity  in
auditory  processing  areas  such  as  the  superior  temporal  gyrus  in  clinical  and  non-clinical
groups  [86],  and  a  correlation  between  the  auditory  hallucination  proneness  scores  of  non-
clinical  participants  and  activity  in  superior  temporal  gyrus  when  imagining  voices  they  subse-
quently  misidenti ﬁed  as  being  heard  [87].  Clinical  and  non-clinical  voice-hearers  also  have
similar  aberrant  microstructure  of  the  arcuate  fasciculus  connection  between  frontal  and
temporal  cortices  [88,89] ,  but  there  is  so  far  no  evidence  as  to  whether  hallucinations  experi-
enced  by  non-clinical  individuals  reﬂect  the  same  pattern  of  anterior  PFC  dysfunction  that  has
been  observed  in  patients  with  schizophrenia.
It  may  well  be  that  there  is  more  than  one  route  by  which  hallucinations  might  occur  in  clinical
and  non-clinical  groups.  Hallucinations  are  sometimes  experienced  spontaneously  in  healthy
individuals  during  periods  of  sensory  deprivation  [50],  auditory  hallucinations  can  follow  the
onset  of  deafness  [90],  and  visual  hallucinations  can  occur  following  visual  cortex  injury  [91].
These  observations  ﬁt  with  the  proposal  that  hyperactivation  of  sensory  processing  cortices
might  provide  the  perceptual  content  for  hallucinatory  experiences  [92].  Consistent  with  this
proposal  is  evidence  that,  in  healthy  individuals  during  periods  of  silence,  there  is  spontaneous
random  activity  in  speech-sensitive  auditory  processing  areas  within  the  superior  temporal
gyrus,  together  with  associated  activation  in  the  anterior  cingulate  region  of  the  medial  PFC
[93].  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  a  hallucination  is  initiated  by  spontaneous  random  activity  in
sensory  processing  areas,  such  as  the  superior  temporal  gyrus  in  the  case  of  auditory
hallucinations,  reﬂecting  spontaneous  ‘inner  speech ’  and/or  remembered  speech,  which
may  occur  with  greater  intensity  or  frequency  during  periods  of  stress  or  heightened  emotion
[81].  In  healthy  individuals  who  do  not  experience  hallucinations,  such  sensory  activity  may  be
correctly  identi ﬁed  as  being  internally  generated  by  reality  monitoring  processes  supported  by
anterior  medial  PFC,  and  experienced  as  an  imagined  voice.  In  patients  with  schizophrenia  who
experience  hallucinations,  spontaneous  sensory  hyperactivity  may  be  even  more  intense,
accompanied  by  hypoactivation  of  medial  PFC  regions  (consistent  with  studies  of  connectivity
[75,76] ),  resulting  in  a  reality  monitoring  impairment  that  leads  to  failure  to  recognize  the  activity
as  self-generated  and  to  the  experience  of  a  hallucination.  In  non-clinical  voice-hearers,  the
spontaneous  activity  in  sensory  processing  areas  may  either  be  of  such  intensity,  or  be
Trends  in  Cognitive  Sciences,  June  2017,  Vol.  21,  No.  6  469

sufﬁciently  unusual  in  character  (perhaps  due  to  emotional  stress,  trauma,  or  tiredness  [81]),
that  an  otherwise  intact  reality  monitoring  system  fails  to  recognize  the  stimuli  as  generated
internally,  and  a  sporadic  hallucination  is  experienced.  A  multifactor  model  such  as  this  (see  also
[92,94] )  can  also  explain  why  some  participant  groups,  such  as  older  adults  [95],  people  with
developmental  disorders  such  as  autism  [96],  and  healthy  volunteers  with  bilateral  PCS
absence  [41],  may  exhibit  reductions  in  performance  on  reality  monitoring  tasks  but  do  not
apparently  experience  hallucinations.  These  ﬁndings  may  be  less  compatible  with  single  factor
accounts,  such  as  those  involving  prediction  error  (e.g.,  [97]).
Concluding  Remarks
There  is  still  much  to  discover  about  the  brain  mechanisms  underlying  reality  monitoring,  and
the  ways  in  which  they  may  fail  in  health  and  disease,  impairing  the  accuracy  of  judgments
about  what  is  real  (see  Outstanding  Questions).  Reality  monitoring  processes  are  fundamental
for  maintaining  an  understanding  of  the  self  as  a  distinct,  conscious  agent  interacting  with  the
world,  perceiving  and  interpreting  external  information  relating  to  events  happening  around  us
and  generating  our  own  thoughts  and  imaginations  and  responses.  Generally,  people  are  able
to  keep  the  ‘internal ’  and  ‘external ’  worlds  distinguished  sufﬁciently  from  one  another  to
function  under  everyday  circumstances  but,  occasionally,  anyone  may  confuse  real  experi-
ences  with  those  they  might  have  been  told  about  or  imagined  or  dreamt.  Some  individuals  face
a  greater  difﬁculty  in  reality  monitoring,  perhaps  reﬂecting  speci ﬁc  individual  differences  in  the
general  population  or,  in  more  severe  cases,  dysfunction  caused  by  neurological  or  psychiatric
disease.
The  evidence  from  cognitive  neuroscience  research  to  date  converges  to  suggest  that  the
anterior  PFC  region  of  the  brain  is  central  to  reality  monitoring  ability  and  disability.  It  is  a  key
component  of  brain  networks  that  are  engaged  when  distinguishing  internally  and  externally
generated  information,  and  its  disruption  is  associated  with  misattributions  of  reality,  confusing
internally  generated  information  with  events  taking  place  in  the  outside  world.  It  appears  to  play
an  important,  and  previously  underappreciated,  role  in  the  psychotic  experiences  that  charac-
terize  disorders  such  as  schizophrenia.  The  processes  underlying  reality  monitoring  are,
similarly  to  many  higher  cognitive  functions,  complex  [9],  but  progress  has  been  made  by
laboratories  around  the  world  in  recent  years  leading  to  a  greater  understanding  of  the  brain
regions,  especially  the  anterior  PFC,  that  subserve  reality  monitoring  mechanisms.  An  impor-
tant  next  challenge  will  be  to  apply  this  knowledge  to  the  development  of  cognitive  training
techniques  and  other  rehabilitation  interventions  aimed  at  enhancing  the  ability  to  distinguish
between  real  and  imagined  experiences  in  people  whose  sense  of  reality  may  be  disturbed.
Preliminary  evidence  suggests  that  such  an  approach  might  have  potential  [74,98] ,  but
researchers  are  only  at  the  beginning  of  this  road  and  there  is  much  further  work  to  do  before
it  can  be  determined  whether  the  potential  is  real.

Although  much  has  been  learned  in
recent  years  about  the  mechanisms
of  reality  monitoring,  and  the  way  they
may  be  impaired  in  neurological  and
psychiatric  disorders,  there  is  much
still  to  be  discovered.  In  particular:
Which  regional  and  interregional  brain
mechanisms,  and  related  cognitive
processes,  might  explain  the  intriguing
observations  that  poor  reality
monitoring  performance  in  healthy
individuals  is  associated  not  only  with
reduced  anterior  PFC  activity  but  also
with  PCS  reductions  and  greater  vol-
ume  of  surrounding  cortex?
What  are  the  common  and  distinct
components  of  neural  activity  associ-
ated  with  reality  monitoring  tasks  that
require  a  distinction  between  self  and
other,  and  internal  source  monitoring
between  self-generated  activities  (e.g.,
imagined  and  performed)?
Do  hallucinations  experienced  by  non-
clinical  individuals  without  a  psychiatric
diagnosis  reﬂect  a  similar  pattern  of
anterior  PFC  dysfunction  and  reduced
PCS  length  to  that  observed  in  patients
with  schizophrenia?  Are  similar  func-
tional  and  structural  markers  also  pres-
ent  in  prodromal  individuals  who
subsequently  progress  to  a  diagnosis
of  schizophrenia?
What  can  explain  the  subjective  differ-
ences  between  hallucinations  typically
experienced  by  patients  with  schizo-
phrenia  and  by  non-clinical  individuals
with  a  proneness  to  psychosis?  Why
are  some  people  with  hallucinations
fully  aware  that  their  experiences  are
erroneous  perceptions,  but  others  are
not?
Does  the  range  of  ﬁndings  concerning
hallucinations  require  a  multiple  factor
explanation,  or  can  they  be  explained
equally  fully  by  more  parsimonious  sin-
gle  factor  accounts,  such  as  prediction
error?
What  are  the  similarities  and  differen-
ces  in  dysfunction  in  the  brain  mecha-
nisms  underlying  reality  monitoring
processes  that  lead  to  hallucinations,
confabulations,  and  delusions?
Can  interventions  that  involve  cognitive
training,  brain  stimulation,  or  neuro-
feedback  be  developed  according  to
