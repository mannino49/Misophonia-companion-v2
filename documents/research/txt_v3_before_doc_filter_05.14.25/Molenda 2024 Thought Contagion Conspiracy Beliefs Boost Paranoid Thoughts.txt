Thought Contagion ? Conspiracy Belie fs Boost Paranoid Thoughts  
 
Abstract  
Conspiracy theories accusing specific groups of secret malevolent actions can foster a 
perception of the world as  a dangerous  place . In our research, we contend that both adherence 
and exposure to conspiracy  beliefs  can serve as a potential cause of certain psychological 
problems in the form of paranoid thoughts . This hypothesis was tested in three studies 
conducted among Polish and British participants. I n Study 1 (longitudinal, N = 603), we 
found that conspiracy beliefs  exerted a positive overtime effect on paranoid thoughts . 
Experimental s tudies 2 (N = 384) and 3 (N = 445),  showed  that being exposed to conspiracy 
theories (vs. control stimuli ) heightened paranoid thoughts . In Study 3, w e proposed  a 
potential mechanism explaining this effect, according to which exposure to conspiracies 
increased paranoid thoughts  via only negative intense emotions . Our work adds to the 
discussion on the consequences of conspiracy beliefs and has implications for mental health 
research, underlining the importance of designing interventions limiting the adverse effects of 
conspiracy beliefs.   
Keywords:  conspiracy beliefs, conspiracy theories, paranoid thoughts, negative

Thought Contagion? Conspiracy Beliefs Boost Paranoid Thoughts  
 
You've been bitten by  
A true believer  
You've been bitten by  
Someone ’s false beliefs  
(Muse , 2018)   
 
The Internet, especially social media platforms, provide almost unlimited space for the 
dissemination of conspiracy theories, making its users (un)intentionally exposed  to this type 
of beliefs on daily basis (e.g., Kużelewska & Tomaszuk, 2022 ). Although p revious research 
showed that conspiracy theories may have severe societal concomitants , to date,  not many 
studies focused on the  consequences that being exposed to them  may have on intra-individual 
outcomes  (e.g., mental health) . In the current research , we claim that theories accusing secret 
groups of colluding to achieve nefarious goals  can lead to maladaptive psychologica l 
consequences in the form of paranoid thoughts  (i.e., a kind of thinking dominated by 
suspicious  or persecutory content , such as being  followed and a tendency to  perceive others’ 
actions as intentionally  malicious; Cicero & Kerns, 2011 ).  
Previous studies (see Imhoff & Lamberty , 2018), already  associated conspiracy beliefs 
with paranoid thoughts.  Some researchers (e.g., Cichocka et al. , 2016) even suggested that  
paranoid thoughts may precede  conspiracy  theories ’ endorsement . These conclusions , 
however, were based on cross -sectional data , thereby limiting inference about causality. The 
current work aims to fill this knowledge gap by employing  longitudinal and experimental 
research designs  to scrutinize how these two phenomena are intertwined. We argue that  since  
conspiracy beliefs are omnipresent in the current days (e.g., Stasielowicz, 2022) and constant

5 
 
online exposure to theories intensif ies distrust, hostility, and negative emotions ( e.g., 
Gkinopoulos & Mari, 2023), such exposure may potentially  contribute to an upsurge in 
paranoid thoughts.  
Conspiracy Beliefs  and Their Consequences  
Conspiracy theories are described as hidden plots by powerful  and malevolent groups , 
whose actions cause outcomes of public interest (e.g., Douglas & Sutton, 2023). Conspiracy 
beliefs  were  previously linked to feelings of psychological threat (e.g., anxiety  or 
uncertainty ). For this reason,  many researchers  (e.g., Douglas & Sutton, 2023 ) understood 
them  as an attempt to reduc e negative experiences  by making sense of the uncertain  through  
quick judgements  about nefarious groups that allegedly control the world . However, it seems 
that they are merely attempts, since longitudinal research suggest ed that conspiracy beliefs 
had the potential to deteriorate initial difficulties, for instance, to heighten  anxiety (Lieke fett 
et al. , 2023)  or psychological  defensiveness (Górska  et al., 2023).  Indeed, belief in conspiracy 
theories was predominantly linked to harmful consequences, such as  prejudice (Marchlewska 
et al., 2019)  or lower adherence to safety guidelines during the COVID -19 pandemic (e.g., 
Molenda et al., 202 4; see also Marinthe et al., 2020 ).  
In fact, o nly a handful of studies, centered primarily on social psychological outcomes, 
investigated the consequences of exposure to conspiracy theories  experimentally . For 
example , exposure  to conspiracy theories about out -groups (e.g., immigrants) increased 
prejudice against these groups  (Jolley et al., 2020) . Similarly , watching a video about a 
government’s conspiracy heightened  distrust towards that government (Kim & Cao, 2016). 
Moreover, exposure to anti -vaccine conspiracy theories decreased vaccination intentions 
(Jolley & Douglas, 2014)  and exposure to antidepressant conspiracy theories  lowered health -
seeking intentions  (Natoli & Marques, 2021 ; see also Fournier & Varet, 2023; for studies on 
chemotherapy -related  conspiracy beliefs ), suggesting that ubiquitous conspiracies might

6 
 
threaten  public health.  Importantly, previous research also demonstrated that exposure to 
conspiracy theories increased  negative emotions ( Gkinopoulos  & Mari, 2023 ).  
Summing up, conspiracy theories have various detrimental consequences. However, 
none of these studies directly investigated these consequences  in the area of mental health 
issues. Using two -wave longitudinal and experimental designs, we aim to fill this gap by 
examining the possible relationships between conspiracy theories and paranoid thoughts.   
Conspiracy Beliefs  and Paranoid Thoughts  
 The relationship between paranoid thoughts  and conspiracy beliefs was the subject of 
psychological studies  before , including two meta -analyses (Imhoff & Lamberty, 2018; 
Stasielowicz, 2022), both showing a similar estimated correlation (r = .36, r = .34, 
respectively). So, what is the difference between these two constructs? Paranoid thoughts  are 
linked to an obsession “with the idea that others  are trying to harm him or her, whereas most 
conspiracy believers may fear less for themselves than for society in general” (Imhoff & 
Lamberty, 2018; p. 911).  Therefore,  conspiracy beliefs are  related to the sociopolitical  or the 
intergroup  sphere  and paranoid thoughts  are rather embedded in the interpersonal domain  
(Imhoff & Lamberty, 2018 ).  
Indeed, p aranoid thoughts are  characterized by excessive interpersonal distrust, being 
suspici ous of other ’s intentions, perceiving others as direct threats to oneself, and by hostile, 
self-referent interpretations of other’s behaviors (e.g., Freeman, 2007). According to the 
hierarchy of paranoia (Freeman et al., 2005), the development of such disturbing thoughts is 
based on the perception of the world as a dangerous place . Affective processes play a pivotal 
role in these beliefs, specifically in the form of high -intensity negative emotions , such as 
anxiety  (Freeman et al., 2010). The threat anticipation model (Freeman et al., 2002 , 2008) 
hypothesizes  that when an individual experiences such negative emotional states, this can 
shape their perception of the world, potentially leading to a misinterpretation of external

7 
 
reality. Negative emotions, such as anxiety and worry, elicit heightened danger anticipation, 
foster a state of vigilance and encourage the interpretation of ambiguous situations as hostile, 
threatening , and intended to cause harm.  
Therefore, since believing in and exposure to conspiracy theories have been linked to 
increased anxiety and negative emotions (Gkinopoulos & Mari, 2023; Liekefett et al., 2023) - 
factors  contributing  to the development of paranoid thoughts (Bagrowska et al., 2022; 
Freeman, 2007) - it seems plausible that conspiracy theories could also fuel these thoughts, 
making those holding conspiracy convictions more suspicious and distrustful in the 
interpersonal sphere.  Importantly , conspiracy theories might be  perceiv ed as a form of  
dangerous world beliefs (a worldview envisioning the social world as threatening; Leone et 
al., 2019), which  can also fuel negative emotions, and thus, increase paranoid thoughts  
(Bagrowska et al., 2022) . To our knowledge, this assumption has not yet been tested.  Some 
studies (e.g., Stasielowicz, 2022) treated these constructs as correlates, without  implying any 
direction of this relationship  and others (e.g., Cichocka  et al. , 2016 ) considered paranoid 
thoughts as a predictor of conspiracy beliefs, assuming that perceiving others’ intentions as 
hostile  on an inter -personal level  might translate into convictions that socio -political events 
are caused by plotting groups. Still, none of these studies  permitted conclusions about 
causality , which we aim to address in the present research . 
Overview of the Current Research  
The main goal of our studies was to shed more light on the role of conspiracy beliefs 
in boosting paranoid thoughts , providing new evidence on the effects of conspiracies on 
health symptoms . In a two -wave longitudinal Study 1, we hypothesized  that conspiracy 
beliefs  at Time 1 (T1) would predict an increase  in paranoid thought s at Time 2 (T2; 
Hypothesis 1). In experimental  Studies 2 and 3 , we assumed that exposure to conspiracy 
theories (vs. control stimuli ) would directly increase paranoid thoughts (Hypothesis 2).

8 
 
Moreover, aiming to investigate a potential mechanism of this causal link in Study 3 , we 
additionally  examined the role of emotions ’ intensity and valency . Specifically, as the role of 
low-valenced intense emotions in the development of paranoid thoughts was highlighted in 
past literature (e.g., Freeman et al., 2010 ), we assumed that the effect of exposure  to 
conspiracies  on paranoi d thoughts  would be mediated by higher negative (vs. positive)  
increased intensity of emotions (i.e., only by negative  intense emotions ; Hypothesis 3; 
moderated mediation).  
All the data, code s, materials , and supplements  are available at  
https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/V4P6B . Data were analyzed using SPSS v.29 (all studies), 
MPlus 8.0 (Muthén & Muthén, 2017; Study 1), and Process 4.1 (Hayes, 2021; Study 3). All 
participants issued informed consent.  The studies  (both longitudinal and experimental) were 
approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Institute of Psychology, Polish Academy 
of Sciences  (number of approval: 26/X/2020 ).  
Study 1  
Method  
Participants and Procedure  
 Study 1 was administered as part of a two -wave online survey of adult Poles. Data was 
collected in 2021 by an external research company , used in academic studies before (e.g., 
Kowalski et al., 2020 ). The two measurements were divided by a six -month interval. We 
aimed to include at least 400 participants  taking part in both measurements , as for r = .14 
(Fritz & MacKinnon, 2007 ), G*Power 3.1 (Faul et al., 2009) provides a target of 398 
participants with a power of 0.80 for detecting small associations between  variables.  Out of 
the 1000 respondents who filled  in the first measurement, 603 (60.3%) also completed  the 
second measurement. The sample for this study consisted only of  the individuals who 
participated in both waves of the survey (329 female, 274 male, Mage = 51.9 4, SDage = 15.4 3).

9 
 
Besides the variables reported here, Study 1 involved measures of other  social 
psychological variables (e.g., social dominance orientation) included for the purposes of 
different projects .1 
Measures  
Conspiracy Beliefs. Measured with the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs scale 
(Brotherton et. al., 2013; Polish adaptation: Siwiak et. al., 2019). A total of 15 statements 
were applied, such as “Certain significant events have been the result of the activity of a small 
group who s ecretly manipulate world events .” Participants responded on a scale from 1 = 
definitely not true  to 5 = definitely true . The scale demonstrated excellent reliability, α T1 = .94, 
αT2 = .95.  
Paranoid Thoughts . To measure paranoid thoughts, we used 18 items from the  
Revised Green et al. Paranoid Thoughts Scale ( R-GPTS ; Freeman et. al., 2019; Polish 
adaptation: Kowalski et. al., 2020). Participants were asked about the thoughts that they might 
have had in the last month and  responded to statements , such as “I have definitely been 
persecuted ,” on a scale from 0 = totally disagree  to 4 = totally agree . The scale showed 
excellent reliability across both measurement s, αT1 = .96, α T2 = .96.  
Results  
Analytic Strategy  
Analyses were conducted  in two steps. First, we examined intercorrelations for the 
variables of interest. Next, an autoregressive cross -lagged path model ( CLPM; Selig & Little, 
2012) was estimated to verify our hypotheses . In this solution, both variables assessed at T2 
(i.e., paranoid thoughts and conspiracy beliefs) were regressed on pa ranoid thoughts and 
conspiracy beliefs at T1.  
 
1 The list of measured constructs (for all studies) is available on the OSF project page.  This dataset was also used 
in Molenda et al.’s (2023)  paper, albeit employing a different set of variables. Please contact the first author for 
details.

Preliminary Analyses  
Descriptive statistics and intercorrelations for the variables assessed in Study 1 are 
presented in Table 1. Across both measurements, conspiracy beliefs were  positively correlated 
with paranoid thoughts. Moreover, participants ’ age  was negatively related to paranoid 
thoughts at T1 and T2.

Hypotheses Testing  
The m odel was estimated with the use of MPlus 8.0 (Muthén & Muthén, 2017)  and 
covariates (age, gender)  were accounted for . Excluding the  covariates did not change  the 
results  except for the effect of paranoid thoughts measured at T1 on conspiracy beliefs 
measured at T2 , which  reach ed significance . Figure 1 shows the results for the autoregressive 
CLPM  tested in Study 1. In line with our hypotheses, c onspiracy beliefs at T 1 were positively 
related to paranoid thoughts at T2 ( B = 0.09, SE = 0.03, 95% CI [0.04, 0.14], β = .09, p = 
.003). The effect of T1 conspiracy beliefs on itself at T2 was positive and sign ificant  (B =

11 
 
0.77, SE = 0.03, 95% CI [0.72, 0.81], β = .75, p < .001) . Paranoid thoughts at T1 were not 
related to T2 conspiracy beliefs ( B = 0.06, SE = 0.03, 95% CI [0.02, 0.06], β = .0 5, p = .052), 
but were  associated to itself  measured  at T2 ( B = 0.6 3, SE = 0.03, 95% CI [0. 58, 0.68], β = 
.62, p < .001) . Thus, the results of Study 1 supported our hypothesis that belief in conspiracy 
theories at T1 would be linked to higher paranoid thoughts at T2 (H1) . Interestingly, paranoid 
thoughts at T1 were  not linked to higher conspiracy beliefs at T2 . Noteworthy, conspiracy 
beliefs and paranoid thoughts were significantly associated with each other at T1 but not 
significantly related at T2. Our findings suggest that while conspiracy beliefs predict paranoid  
thoughts, this effect does not seem to work the other way around.  Thus, t he results  
preliminary  implied that conspiracy beliefs might contribute to hostile, self -referent 
interpretations of other’s behaviors  in the form of paranoid thoughts . However, as a two -wave 
panel survey study holds some limitations regarding causality, we conducted experimental 
Studies 2 and 3  to directly investigate the effects of exposure to conspiracy theories on 
paranoid thoughts.

 Study 2  
Method  
Participants and Procedure  
Data for  Study 2 were obtained through an online survey conducted among British 
participants via Prolific Academic  in 2023 . Based on previous experiments in the field of 
conspiracy beliefs ’ emotional concomitants  (Marchlewska et al., 2022) , we expected effect 
size d = 0.286 . We estimated our sample size with G*Power (Faul et al., 2009), assuming the 
power of .80 for differences between two independent means (two -tailed), which yielded 193 
participants per  research  condition.  The study was filled out by  393 participants . Due to the 
experimental character of the study , we added an attention check to verify  if respondents read 
the texts  attentively . Based on that , we excluded one participant. Lastly, eight  participant s 
were excluded due to  selecting “Non-binary ” or “Prefer to self -describe ” as their gender, 
which was not aligned with the study ’s demographic categoriza tion criteria .2 The final sample 
for this study included 384 British participants ( 199 women, 185 men) , aged between 1 9 and 
79 (Mage = 47.62, SDage = 14.34). 
First, participants were asked to complete demographic variables. Then, they were 
randomly divided into two conditions : conspiracy ( n = 189) or control ( n = 195). In both 
conditions, participants were exposed to three fabricated articles about: a. Muslims ’ migration  
to Europe, b. 5G  technology , c. the world of politics. In the conspiracy condition , three texts 
were designed to prime conspiracy thinking  by explain ing certain events or phenomena as 
orchestrated by secret ly plotting agents . In the control cond ition, the character of the texts was 
more neutral and scientific , describing  the same events and phenomena without referring to 
any secret plots  (see Supplements for more information). In both conditions, the texts were 
 
2 For the purpose of this study (as well as Study 3), we focused on responses from those who identified as ‘man’ 
or ‘woman’. This decision was taken to maintain data homogeneity for this specific analysis, but we 
acknowledge and respect the importance of all  gender identities.

 designed using the same graphic layouts (i.e., the fonts, the arrangement of all the elements, 
etc., were the same for both conditions in each text).  The word counts were similar in 
corresponding texts (i.e., Muslims’ migration to Europe: 209 words in the experimental 
condition vs. 221 in the control condition; 5G technology: 338 words in the experimental 
condition vs. 321 in the control condition; the world of politics: 506 words in the 
experimental condition vs. 492 in the control condition). Next, partic ipants answered 
questions about paranoi d thoughts . Finally, they were carefully debriefed (e.g., we explained 
the overall goal and design of the study and informed them that some of the presented content 
included subjective opinions that might not be true or that might not accord to the current 
state of knowledge) and thanked them for their participation.  
Measures  
Paranoi d Thoughts . This was measured as a state with six-items previously used by 
Freeman et al.  (2015), such as  “Right now I am thinking that others are trying to persecute 
me.” Participants were asked to respond using a scale from 1 = definitely disagree to 7 = 
definitely agree , α = .96. 
Results  
Analytic Strategy  
First, we examined intercorrelations between  the variables of interest. Then, we 
estimated hierarchical regression to test the role of exposure to conspiracy theories  in 
increasing paranoi d thoughts . 
Preliminary Analyses  
First, we computed correlations between all the variables across  both conditions (see 
Table 2). Similarly to Study 1, age correlated to paranoi d thoughts  negatively .

Hypotheses Testing  
We computed hierarchical regression analysis to check whether there would be an 
indirect effect of the conspiracy  (vs. control)  condition , age , and gender on paranoi d thoughts  
(see Table 3). The c onspiracy  condition  was indeed a significant positive predictor, 
suggesting that those in the conspiracy condition had increased paranoid thoughts.  Moreover, 
age and gender also predicted paranoi d thoughts  significantly , indicating that men and 
younger individuals had higher state paranoia . Thus, in Study 2, we provided first 
experimental evidence o f the effects of exposure to conspiracy theories on mental health 
issues, showing that such exposure increased paranoi d thoughts  (H2).

 In Study 3, we aimed to  replicate this effect in a d ifferent cultural context, also 
examining the role of higher negative (vs. positive) increased intensity of emotions in 
explaining the link between exposure to conspiracy beliefs and paranoid thoughts.  
Study 3 
Method  
Participants and Procedure  
Study 3 included a sample of adult Poles and data  were collected  online  in 2023 by the 
same external research company  as in Study 1 . Regarding the sample size, we followed the 
same calculations as in Study 2.  We recruited  468 participants  – we aimed to over -recruit to 
allow for exclusions . We applied  two attention chec ks to ensure data quality. With t he first 
one (a question regarding  the content of the administered articles ), we exclu ded 17 
participants. Following this, another attention check  (requir ing participants to select the 
answer “3” in a specific item ), led to the removal of 5 more individuals. Lastly, one 
participant was excluded for selecting “Other ” as their gender, which was not aligned with the 
study ’s demographic categorization criteria. The final sample for this study included 445 
participants (236 women, 209 men) , aged between 18 and 81 ( Mage = 48.58, SDage = 16.37).  
We used the same design as in Study 2, but added  questions  regarding emotions . First, 
participants complete d demographic variables and were then randomly divided into two 
research conditions : conspiracy ( n = 222) or control ( n = 223). As in Study 2, participants  in 
both conditions  were exposed to three fabricated articles  about: a. Muslims ’ migration  to 
Europe  (188 words in the experimental condition vs. 184 words in the control condition) , b. 
5G technology  (310 words in the experimental condition vs. 288 words in the control 
condition) , c. the world of politics  (446 words in the experimental condition vs. 436 words in 
the control condition) . In the conspiracy condition, these articles were  designed to provide 
conspiracy explanations for the aforementioned issues  and in the control condition, they

17 
 
 aimed to  provide more of a neutral and scientific explanation of the same topics. These 
articles were almost the same as in Study 2 – we only slightly changed several sentences to 
embed t hem more in the Polish context (see Supplements for the exact wording  of all articles 
in both experiments ). As before, the texts in both conditions were presented with the use of 
the same graphic layouts.  Next, participants answered questions about emotions ’ intensity and  
valency , and paranoi d thoughts . Finally, respondents  were carefully debriefed and thanked for 
their participation , as in Study 2 . 
Measures  
Intensity of Emotions . This was measured using one item , inspired  by Medland and 
colleagues  (2020) . Participants were asked to evaluate the intensity of the emotions they felt 
while reading the articles displayed in each condition . Item was scored on a seven -point scale  
from 1 = not intense at all  to 7 = very intense , where higher scores indicated higher emotions’ 
intensity.  
Valency of Emotions . This was measured using one item , inspired  by Medland and 
colleagues  (2020) . Participants were asked to evaluate the valency of emotions they felt while 
reading the articles displayed in each condition . Item was scored on a seven -point scale  from 
1 = definitely negative  to 7 = definitely positive , where higher scores indicated positive 
emotions.  
Paranoi d Thoughts . This was measured as in Study 2, with six items proposed by 
Freeman et al.  (2015; Polish version: Bagrowska et al., 2023 ), α = .95. 
Results  
Analytic Strategy  
 In Study 3, analyses were conducted in two stages . First, we examined 
intercorrelations for the variables of interest  and conducted  t-tests for intensity and valency of

18 
 
 emotions . Then, we estimated a hierarchical regression and a moderated mediation model to 
test the role of intensity and valency of emotions in increasing paranoi d thoughts . 
Preliminary Analyses  
First, we computed correlations between all the variables across both conditions (see 
Table 4). We found positive correlations between intensity of emotions and paranoi d 
thoughts . Valency of emotions was significantly negatively associated with paranoi d 
thoughts . Similarly to Stud ies 1 and 2 , age correlated with paranoi d thoughts  negatively . 
Additionally, age was positively linked to intensity of emotions.

Hypotheses Testing  
Intensity and Valency of Emotions . To investigate the effects of each condition on  
intensity and valency of emotions , we computed independent  t-tests for these  variables. There 
was a significant effect of the condition  on intensity of emotions  (control condition  M = 
4.14, SD = 1.48 ; conspiracy condition  M = 4.58 , SD = 1.43 ), t(443) = 3.18 , p = .002, d = 0.30 ,

19 
 
 and on valence of emotions (control condition  M = 4.39 , SD = 1.28 ; conspiracy condition  M = 
3.11, SD = 1.40 ), t(439,196 ) = -10.06 , p < .001, d = -0.95. 
Paranoi d Thoughts . We computed hierarchical regression analysis to check whether 
there would be an indirect effect of the conspiracy manipulation on paranoi d thoughts  via 
intensity of higher negative (vs. positive; i.e., valency of) emotions (Table 5) . In Step 1, we 
introduced the condition (control = 0, conspiracy = 1) and demographic variables (i.e., gender 
and age) as covariates. There was a positive and significant effect of the conspiracy condition 
on paranoi d thoughts  – we present mean differences between the conditions (for both 
experimental studies) in Figure 2. When  we added the emotions ’ intensity and valency  in Step 
2, the effect of the condition became non -significant.  However,  we found a positive and 
significant effect of intensity of emoti ons on paranoi d thoughts . The effect of valency was 
non-significant  though . In Step 2, we also found a significant negative effect of age on the 
dependent variable. When we removed the covariates, the results remained the same (see the 
Supplements for details).

Study 3); t(358,525) = 4.83, p < .001, d = 0.50, for Study 2; t(428,788) = 3.14, p = .002, d =

In order to perform a full test of our hypotheses, we conducted a moderated mediation 
analysis using model 7 in Process 4.1 (Hayes, 2021). Significance was tested with 
bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals for the unstandardized indirect effects, construct ed 
with 10,000 resamples. The analysis displayed in Figure 3 examined whether valency of 
(high er vs. low er) emotions  moderated the mediation between the condition (conspiracy vs. 
control) and paranoi d thoughts  via intensity of emotions. Valency of emotions  was introduced 
as the moderator between  the condition (conspiracy vs. control) and intensity of emotions. As 
covariates , we used gender and age . The interaction between  the condition and valency of 
emotions predicted intensity of emotions  negatively and significantly , b = -0.49, SE = 0.10, 
95% CI [-0.69, -0.30], p = <.001 , suggesting that the conspiracy condition led to more intense 
emotions only among those who had higher negative emotions . The indirect effect of the 
moderated mediation was negative and significant, b = -0.12, SE = 0.04, 95% CI [-0.21, -
0.05]. Thus, the results showed that the indirect effect of conspiracy (vs. control) condition on 
paranoi d thoughts  via int ensity of emotions was significant only among individuals who felt 
more negative emotions (i.e., scored low er on valency of emotions) , b = 0.33, SE = 0.09, 95% 
CI [0.18, 0.52], but not among those who felt more positive emotions (i.e., scored high er on 
valency of emotions) , b = -0.03, SE = 0.06, 95% CI [-0.16, 0.07].  Therefore, Study 3 
replicated the effect of exposure to conspiracy theories on increased paranoi d thoughts  (H2),

22 
 
 additionally demonstrating the possible mechanism of th is effect : it was mediated by higher 
negative (vs. positive)  valenced  intensity of emotions (i.e., negative -only intense emotions ; 
H3).

Discussion  
Across a series of three studies , conducted in two different countries (Poland and the 
UK), we investigate d the role of conspiracy beliefs in fostering paranoid thoughts . Given that 
all previous studies examining this link were cross -sectional, we decided to employ 
longitudinal (Study 1) and experimental (Stud ies 2-3) designs to provide new insights into the 
knowledge about conspiracy  beliefs  and mental -health phenomena . In a two -wave panel 
study, we demonstrated that conspiracy beliefs at T1 were related to higher paranoid thoughts 
at T2, thus supporting H1. Experimental Studies 2 and 3 investigate d the conseque nces of 
ubiquitous conspiracy theories  causally . Results of the first experiment showed that being 
exposed to articles about conspiracies indeed enhanced paranoi d thoughts  (H2). The

23 
 
 following experiment replicated this effect, additionally showing the potential mechanism 
explaining the way exposure to conspiracy theories may impact  paranoid thoughts. Namely, 
this effect was mediated  only by negative , intensive  emotions, providing support for our last 
hypothesis ( H3). These results suggest that  exposure to conspiracy theories might lead to 
higher paranoid thoughts due to eliciting negative , but not positive,  intense emotions.  
Theoretical Implications  
 The question why people  believe d in conspiracy theories has been explored by 
scientists at least since the 1990s  (e.g., Abalakina -Paap et al., 1999 ), with explanations 
typically centering around various unfulfilled psychological motives  (e.g.,  Douglas & Sutton, 
2023). However, the existing literature seems to overlook the current reality , which is  that we 
no longer need to  intentionally face maladaptive psychological processes  and actively seek 
alternative  explanations for various situations  to come across conspiracy theories . They 
pervade our surroundings and  can possibly  influence us, even if initially we were  not their 
proponents  (Kużelewska & Tomaszuk, 2022) . Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the effects 
of the exposure to conspiracy  theories, going beyond cross -sectional research designs . This 
approach is essential for determining whether the correlation between a specific variable  (e.g., 
anxiety;  Liekefett et al., 2023 ) and belief in conspiracies  indeed  stems from an individual ’s 
unmet  psychological  needs or rather is a consequence of exposure to conspiracies , which 
contributes to psychological difficulties . This principle extends to  majority of  variables 
associated with conspiracy beliefs , such as lack of control  (Kofta  et al., 202 0), narcissistic 
group identity  (Marchlewska  et al., 2019) , or the aforementioned paranoid thoughts , just to 
mention a few . 
 We were especially interested in examining the potential consequences of conspiracy 
theories since the COVID -19 pandemic resulted in a proliferation of such theories on social 
media (Kużelewska & Tomaszuk, 2022). The results of our experiment s demonstrated that

24 
 
 being exposed to conspiracy theories increased  paranoi d thoughts , suggest ing that the 
ubiquity of such views might affect  mental health , at least tempora rily. Thus, conspiracy 
theories do not only affect socio -political phenomena, such as increased prejudice (Jolley et 
al., 2020) , but they also might affect individuals ’ well-being. Obtained results are also in line 
with previous findings  regarding the increased negative emotions after being exposed to 
conspiracies (Gkinopoulos & Mari, 2023). As such,  we combined social and clinical 
psychology perspectives to offer a mechanism explaining the effects of conspiracies ’ 
exposure on paranoi d thoughts , and we showed that this exposure increased paranoi d thoughts  
via negative -only intens ive emotions. Building on prior research ( Bagrowska et al., 2022;  
Freeman et al., 2010 ; Gkinopoulos & Mari, 2023; Liekefett et al., 2023), we may conclude 
that exposure to conspiratorial c ontent has a potential to increase  the perception of the world 
as dangerous, intensif y negative emotions, and worsen mental states, increasing the likelihood 
of paranoid thoughts occurrence . Those who are more prone to paranoid thoughts, for 
example, due to factors such as low self -esteem, ongoing stress, or psychoactive substance 
use (Freeman et al., 2015), may be particularly susceptible to the adverse psychological 
effects of exposure to co nspiracy theories.  
These results also correspond to Kramer ’s (1998) paranoid cognition model, which 
identified situational, social cognitive underpinnings of paranoid cognitions (e.g., perceived 
distinctiveness, social uncertainty) that could lead to dysphoric self -consciousness, increas ed 
rumination and hypervigilance, which may contribute to an exaggerated perception of 
conspiracy (e.g., Wabnegger et al., 2024), ultimately triggering higher paranoid thoughts. 
According to that model, our results suggest that the ubiquity of conspiracy the ories and 
exposure to them could be considered situational antecedents that could lead to paranoid 
thoughts (at least temporarily ). The notion of different situational antecedents of paranoid 
thoughts (including conspiracy beliefs) is worth investigating in the future.

25 
 
 Conclusions and Future Directions  
 Although  our research  allows to perceive conspiracy theories consequences in a more 
nuanced way , it has several limitations.  Our studies were conducted  in two contexts (Polish 
and British), allowing to increase  our findings ’ generalizability , but this  does not seem enough 
to suggest that the obtained effects are universal . Future research should consider drawing 
samples from different countries and cultural contexts to replicate these results.  Additionally, 
despite establishing sample sizes based on power analysis, our research has some drawbacks. 
Especially experiments should have used more appropriate estimates (i.e., from the research 
on conspiracy theories exposure) than we used in this project (i.e., from the research on 
coping and conspiracy beliefs).  Future research should be more careful with estimations and 
effect sizes used in power analyses.  
Moreover , we examined the effects of exposure to conspiracy theories  experimentally , 
however, we did not examine if this translate d into conspiracy beliefs in the long term - future 
studies might include more elaborated designs, including both exposure and beliefs, to 
thoroughly investigate these issues.  Another interesting point would be to investigate the 
effects of the constant, long -term exposure to conspiracy theories (which we can experience, 
e.g., on the Internet). However, such studies should be conducted carefully, especially 
regarding the ethical issues  it may raise . It is worth noting that the effects of the debriefings 
should also be tested in the future. Studies showed that debriefings can be insufficient to 
utterly eliminate the experimental creation of some beliefs (see Anderson et al., 1980). Thus, 
future research should mea sure whether the effect of the experimental manipulation on 
conspiracy beliefs holds after the debriefing in order to improve the efficiency of the 
debriefing , if needed , and to ensure the well -being of the participants.  
 Another point of caution should be made regarding the CLPM  we employed in Study 
1. Although  it is a popular method for two -wave data analysis (Orth et al., 2021), it has also

26 
 
 been criticized, for example, for inadequate accounting for stable -trait-level associations, 
potentially resulting in erroneous conclusions about the cross -lagged effects (Hamaker et al., 
2015). For an adequate examination of causality, future studies should use three -wave 
designs, in which the random intercept within the model can be included, address ing some of 
the constraints of the CLPM  (Hamaker et al., 2015).   
We believe that the role of  adherence and exposure to  conspiracy beliefs in intra -
individual processes is an important issue that may help explain the nature of psychological 
problems that many people are currently struggling with. Our research  suggest s the 
detrimental consequences of conspiracy theories  and indicate s the necessity of discussing 
potential ways to attenuate the harmful aftermath of conspiracies in the age of their 
proliferation in the online world.
