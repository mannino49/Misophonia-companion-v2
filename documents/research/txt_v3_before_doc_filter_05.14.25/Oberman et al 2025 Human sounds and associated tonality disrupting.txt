## 20 Abstract

21

In protected natural areas (PNAs), at popular scenic spots, visitors often contribute

- 22 to noise pollution through their behaviour. Decibel-based sensors don't fully capture

23

this, necessitating a more holistic approach. A mixed-methods framework, based on

24

the ISO 12913 series, was tested in four European PNAs. During five soundwalks (7-

25

12 km long) organised by the

Silenzi in Quota initiative, 443 questionnaires were

- 26 gathered across 28 evaluation points, alongside corresponding binaural
- 27 measurements. Acoustic environments as silent as LAeq=31 dB and as loud as
- 28 LAeq=76 dB were observed, eliciting perceptions from very calm to chaotic.
- 29 Psychophysical measures (loudness, sharpness, roughness, fluctuation strength and 30 tonality) were calculated. The impact of the perceived sound source dominance,
- 31 visual landscape quality and psychophysical and environmental acoustic features on
- 32 the perceived soundscape pleasantness and eventfulness was analysed via Linear 33 Mixed-Effects Models (LMMs). Perceived sound source type data- and
- 34 psychophysical data-based models outperformed those based on sound pressure
- 35 level metrics. Amongst the sounds of nature, water sounds demonstrated the

36

strongest association with higher pleasantness and eventfulness. Presence of

- 37 human sounds, associated with increased tonality, was the major factor driving the

It has been shown in the past 6 years since the publishing of the ISO/TS, 127 that the Method A has been the most widely accepted approach  34 . It features the 128 assessment of the perceived affective quality (PAQ), based on the circumplex model 129 featuring a two-dimensional perceptual space defined by the orthogonal main axes, 130 labelled as Pleasant and Eventful  35 .

| 133 | Soundwalk is the recommended method for obtaining human responses based on a           |
| 134 | participatory listening walk along a (predetermined) route, featuring a number of      |
| 135 | listening stops and a number of participants gathered at the location for the specific |
| 136 | purpose of the soundwalk 36 . However, most of the research that fed into the ISO      |
| 137 | 12913 Acoustics - Soundscape series was conducted on urban environments, with          |
| 138 | urban setting in mind where a tolerance to certain noise sources is perhaps an         |
| 139 | integral part of the urban soundscape aesthetics. 37 have compared urban               |
| 140 | soundscape data 38 with the perceptual data from a national park in laboratory         |
| 141 | conditions using the 'virtual soundwalk approach' 39 , showing the majority of         |
| 142 | recordings from the national park being mapped in the pleasant and uneventful          |
| 143 | space. Conversely, while there is a growing number of studies exploring soundscape     |
| 144 | pleasantness and eventfulness in various urban settings and laboratory conditions      |
| 145 | 34 , to the best of authors' knowledge, there are no available studies conducting      |
| 146 | soundscape investigations in PNAs in a way compliant with the ISO                      |
| 147 | recommendations for assessments in situ .                                              |
| 148 | A study exploring the combined effect of the acoustic environment, as captured by      |
| 149 | microphone-based sensors, together with the content of environmental sounds and        |
| 150 | the context they are experienced in, demonstrated that the presence of visible         |
| 151 | vegetation can influence human tolerance to noise 40 . Ferrari et al (2023) have       |
| 152 | found that anthropogenic sounds have negative influence on the perceived               |
| 153 | recreational quality in PNAs. The same holds for a noise level increase beyond 38      |
| 154 | dBA 41 , which is a very conservative value compared to urban areas where a typical    |
| 155 | threshold for acoustic comfort is considered to be around 65 dBA 42 . This implies     |
| 156 | that the increase in popularity of a site and the number of visits can have an         |
| 157 | adverse effect, not only on the natural habitats but on the visitors themselves by     |
| 158 | further contributing to noise pollution. This implies a role of the context as an      |
| 159 | understanding of what a place people find themselves in is and what it means to        |
| 160 | them.                                                                                  |

| 162 | This study, based on the five expeditions conducted by the Silenzi in Quota initiative |
| 163 | aims to provide evidence about the application of the ISO 12913 framework in PNAs      |
| 164 | and deepen the understanding of the effect of environmental sounds on human            |
| 165 | perception in PNAs by gathering perceptual in situ data at locations hard-to-reach     |
| 166 | and investigating the associations between the key (psycho)acoustic metrics and        |

## 186 Perceptual measurements

187 The perceived dominance of sound sources is illustrated in Figure 1, highlighting the 188 character of the study locations covered by the soundwalks. These areas are 189 characterized by the dominance of human sounds (e.g., voices, moderately, a lot, or 190 completely dominating in 51% of cases, overall N: 435) and natural sounds, such as 191 those produced by animals (dominating in 48% of cases, N: 438), water (44%, N: 192 439), and wind (33%, N: 435). Traffic noise and other noises (e.g., sirens or 193 industrial sounds) are generally not heard (traffic: moderately, a lot, or completely 194 dominating in 11% of cases, N: 439; other noise: 5%, N: 436).

Fig. 1. Perceived dominance of different sound types.

Regarding the visual landscape, the evaluations are, as expected, very positive. In 94% of the evaluations visual landscape is rated as good or very good (N: 439).

## Relationship between sound sources dominance, overall visual quality, soundscape pleasantness and eventfulness (RQ#1)

The results of LMM1 for ISO Pleasantness show a significant effect of the dominance of traffic noise (χ 2  (4) = 15.105, p = 0.005, η 2  = 0.14), other sounds (e.g., sirens, construction, industry, loading of goods) (χ 2  (1) = 4.036, p = 0.045, η 2  = 0.04), sounds generated by other human beings (χ 2  (1) = 53.663, p &lt; 0.001, η 2  = 0.49), water sound (χ 2  (1) = 4.327, p = 0.037, η 2  = 0.04), and the quality of the visual landscape (χ 2  (1) = 21.693, p &lt; 0.001, η 2  = 0.20). Specifically, greater ISO pleasantness is associated with less traffic noise, construction noise and human voices, more dominant sound produced by water features, and better landscape quality (see Table 3). Gender, age, mountain sports habits, dominance of animals, and wind are not found to be significantly associated with the ISO pleasantness of the sound environment.

216 As regards ISO Eventfulness, LMM1 indicates a significant main effect of the 217 dominance of traffic noise (χ 2  (4) = 7.203, p = 0.045, η 2  = 0.03), and human voices 218 (χ 2  (1) = 74.099, p &lt; 0.001, η 2  = 0.91), and water sounds (χ 2  (1) = 4.390, p = 219 0.036, η 2  = 0.05). Higher eventfulness is associated with more dominant traffic 220 noise, anthropogenic noise and water sound (see Table 3).

221 The soundscape assessments are represented in Figure 2, with evaluations divided 222 into two groups based on the perceived dominance of sounds (low or high) or the 223 perceived quality of the landscape (low or high).

Fig. 2. Comparison of soundscapes based on the dominance of (a) traffic noise, (b) other noise, (c) human beings, (d) animals, (e) wind, (f) water sounds, and (h) quality of landscape. The curves represent the 50th percentile contour, and the bivariate distributions of ISO pleasantness and ISO eventfulness are plotted on the two axes. L represents low dominance (not at all, a little) or poor quality (very bad; bad) group, while H represents the high dominance (moderately, a lot, dominates completely) or high quality (neither good nor bad, good; very good) subsample.

## Relationship between the (psycho)acoustic features and soundscape pleasantness and eventfulness (RQ#2)

The single-parameter models (LMM2 to LMM10) for ISO Pleasantness show a significant association with the A-weighted continuous equivalent sound pressure level LAeq,T (χ 2  (1) = 6.789, p = 0.009), LAF,5 - LAF,95 (χ 2  (1) = 8.765, p = 0.003), tonality (χ 2  (1) = 27.332, p &lt; 0.001), and fluctuation strength (χ 2  (1) = 27.230, p &lt; 0.001). Higher sound levels, sound level variation over time, tonality, and fluctuation strength values correspond to less pleasant and more annoying soundscapes (see Table 4).

243 Regarding the modelling of ISO Eventfulness, the single-parameter models (2 to 10) 244 exhibit a significant correlation with the A-weighted continuous equivalent sound 245 pressure level LAeq,T (χ 2  (1) = 20.328, p &lt; 0.001), LAF,5 - LAF,95 (χ 2  (1) = 8.7652, p = 246 0.003), loudness (χ 2  (1) = 5.6013, p = 0.018), tonality (χ 2  (1) = 28.068, p &lt; 0.001), 247 roughness (χ 2  (1) = 4.979, p = 0.026), and fluctuation strength (χ 2  (1) = 19.454, p 248 &lt; 0.001). Specifically, more eventful soundscapes are associated with higher sound 249 levels, level variation over time, loudness values, tonality, roughness, and 250 fluctuation strength values. 251 The effect of sound pressure level, sound level variability, loudness, tonality, 252 roughness and fluctuation strength on soundscape is illustrated in Figure 3, where 253 the dataset is divided into two sub-samples based on the median value of each 254 (psycho)acoustic parameter (see Table 2). This allows for a comparison of 255 soundscape contours (i.e., the curves representing the 50 th  percentiles) according 256 to high vs. low levels of sound, loudness, and tonality. We can notice that location 257 scoring high in these psychoacoustic values are generally neutral in terms of 258 pleasantness and more eventful. In places quieter locations, with less sound level 259 variation, lower roughness, tonality and fluctuation strength the soundscape 260 contours are generally positioned in an area of greater pleasantness and lower 261 eventfulness, thus resulting in a calmer soundscape. Moreover, it can be noticed

262 that the two soundscape contours based on the median value of tonality are 263 particularly distinct and separate, clearly defining an eventful zone with high 264 tonality values and a calm zone with low tonality.

The AIC, the Rm 2  and Rc 2  coefficients are reported in Table 5, with lower AIC values corresponding to higher predictive power of the model, and higher R 2  associated to higher proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables.

274 For both ISO Pleasantness and ISO Eventfulness, perceptual models outperform 275 psychoacoustic models, resulting in considerably lower AIC values, especially for 276 pleasantness. Among psychoacoustic ones, single-parameter models based on 277 tonality and fluctuation strength are the most effective for predicting pleasantness, 278 corresponding to lower AIC values. Regarding eventfulness, the tonality parameter 279 has a similar performance in predicting eventfulness compared to perceptual 280 models (i.e., within 2 AIC units).

285

Interestingly, the marginal (R 2  m) coefficients of determination are significantly lower than the conditional (R 2  c) ones for each model. This outcome suggests that a greater proportion of the variance was accounted by random effects related to the experimental design (i.e., participants, locations nested in sites) rather than by fixed effects (i.e., perceptions and measurements).

RQ1 - How are perceived sound source dominance and overall perceived visual quality of the environment influencing the perceived soundscape pleasantness and eventfulness in PNAs?

The effects of the perceived sound source dominance and the overall perceived visual quality of the environment on the ISO Pleasantness and ISO Eventfulness were explored using the questionnaire results only. The questionnaire item

294

investigating the composition of natural sound source type, from the ISO/TS 12913-

295 2, was expanded into additional three questions to capture animal, wind-driven and 296 water sounds. This, more detailed sound source dominance questionnaire has

| 297     | revealed that different types of natural sounds contribute to ISO Eventfulness in      |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 298     | different ways. Namely, the animal (Q4.4) and wind (Q.4.5) sounds showed no            |
| 299     | significant effect, but dominance of water sounds (Q4.5) exhibited a positive          |
| 300     | correlation with ISO Eventfulness.                                                     |
| 301     | In urban environments, such as urban parks, it was found that higher human             |
| 302     | presence under a certain threshold would increase both auditory and visual             |
| 303     | satisfaction with an environment 43 . However, this study indicated that an increase   |
| 304     | in dominance of human sounds leads to a decrease in ISO Pleasantness. This             |
| 305     | difference is most likely driven by the expectations people have when visiting PNAs,   |
| 306     | which are different than in cities. Visiting a natural site is an effort implying both |
| 307     | planning and financial cost, aimed at escaping everyday urban environments and         |
| 308     | achieving a connection with nature. Not meeting such expectations likely results in    |
| 309     | a feeling of disappointment.                                                           |
| 310     | 44 have looked into the influence of different expectations driving ISO Pleasantness   |
| 311     | and ISO eventfulness, namely the residence and participants' background as a           |
| 312     | proxy for familiarity with certain urban acoustic environments. Indeed, familiarity    |
| 313     | was the third dimension, following valence and arousal, recognized by 35 . In this     |
| 314     | study, Q3 (Do you often (at least once a month) practice mountain sports?) was         |
| 315     | used as the proxy for familiarity with natural areas similar to the ones investigated  |
| 316     | but no effect was found through the analysis. This is in line with 45 who looked at    |
| 317     | the effect of tourism and showed that both residents and visitors display equal        |
| 318     | appreciation of natural sounds.                                                        |
| 319     | The questionnaire-based model LMM1 demonstrated the highest predictive power,          |
| 320     | which speaks for the potential of using crowd-sourced questionnaire data from          |
| 321     | soundwalks or equivalent smartphone-based applications, such as 46,47 , over           |
| 322     | traditional sound level monitoring stations for predicting soundscape quality. This is |
| 323     | in line with other similar studies comparing the physiological and psychophysical      |
| 324     | models 48 . Additionally, the higher LMM1 performance implies the benefit of           |
| 325     | accounting for the types of sources which are audible, highlighting the potential      |
| 326     | application of machine learning-based automatic source recognition methodologies       |
| 327     | 49 to characterize soundscapes in natural areas. While the focus of this study was to  |
| 328     | observe the effect of human activity on soundscape of PNAs, this finding is in line    |
| 329     | with other studies investigating the effect of traffic noise on annoyance where        |
| 330     | perceptual models tend to outperform the ones based on psychoacoustic features         |
| 331     | only 50 . The LMM1 for ISO Pleasant performed significantly better than for ISO        |
| 332     | Eventful, confirming the higher difficulty in predicting eventfulness/content          |
| 333     | compared to pleasantness/comfort already found for urban 35 and indoor                 |
| 334     | soundscapes 51 .                                                                       |
| 335     | Regarding the effect of the visual context, it is important to note that the           |
|         | distribution of Q8 (Overall, how would you describe the present surrounding visual     |
| 336 337 | environment?) responses is skewed towards very positive. This was expected, given      |
| 338     | that all the soundwalks took place in areas that are tourist attractions. A positive   |
| 339     | correlation was found between the overall visual quality and ISO Pleasantness, in      |
| 340     | line with the findings from other studies in urban parks where it was found that a     |

341 more attractive natural scene can improve soundscape  52 . However, the number of 342 negative soundscape quality assessments in this study still proves that not even the 343 very high visual attractiveness of a site is sufficient to ensure a high-quality natural 344 environment and its soundscape.

. The strongest effect on ISO

Eventfulness were T, F, L Aeq,T, R and N rmc. Tonality emerged as the main psychoacoustic feature affecting both perceived soundscape pleasantness and

eventfulness. The model reveals negative coefficients for ISO Pleasantness (i.e., higher tonality leads to higher annoyance) and positive coefficients for ISO

Eventfulness; hence, following the structure of the soundscape circumplex model, one could infer that higher tonality in the acoustic environment of PNAs included in

this study is related to higher perceived sense of chaos (i.e., a soundscape that features negative ISO Pleasantness and positive ISO Eventfulness can be defined as

357

chaotic).

358 At the sites investigated in this study, higher tonality (between 0.1 and 0.4 tu) 359 seems to be associated with higher perceived dominance of human sounds (voices 360 from people in this case), as shown in Table 6. This is in line with findings by  53 361 where it was observed that high presence of human speech can result in tonality 362 around 0.1 tu, while birdsong is usually less tonal (between 0.5 and 0.8 tu). It is 363 important to note that such psychoacoustic measures are highly dependent on the 364 overall acoustic context and all the measurements made are performed on the 365 samples of complex environments containing a multitude of sound sources in 366 random relationship. In urban context due to the presence of more dominant 367 anthropic sound sources (e.g., traffic noise, mechanical sounds), not present in 368 PNAs, human voices do not stand out as particularly tonal sound sources as they 369 are 'masked' by the urban noise background. In such context tonality often reaches 370 higher values, above 0.4 tu in cases of acoustic environments containing sounds of 371 church bells or music  53,54 . Therefore, the range of tonality values observed in this 372 study still falls in the 'low tonality range'.

|   376 | Other studies looking at the effects of psychoacoustic measures on ISO                  |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   377 | Pleasantness and ISO Eventfulness performed in urban context, including large           |
|   378 | urban parks, have found a strong effect of loudness, sharpness and L Aeq , while the    |
|   379 | effect of tonality was noted but was found to be less important than in this study 55 . |
|   380 | While the association between the dominance of human sounds and annoyance is            |
|   381 | clear, it is important to note that the human sounds are in fact the most frequent      |
|   382 | sound source type observed across the sample (Figure 1). Indeed, up to a certain        |
|   383 | threshold, Ednie et al. 56 have found that urban visitors still prefer to experience    |
|   384 | urban noises in protected areas. Taking tonality as a proxy for human sound             |
|   385 | presence (see Table 6), we can derive threshold values for ISO Pleasantness and         |
|   386 | ISO Eventfulness based on linear regression models. These are T = 1.248 tu for ISO      |
|   387 | Pleasant (ISO Pleasantness = 42.653 + 34.17 T, p < 0.001, R 2 adj = 0.53) and T >       |
|   388 | 0.021 tu for ISO Eventful (ISO E = 0.503 + 23.777 T, p < 0.001, R 2 adj = 0.45).        |
|   389 | Therefore, a tonality threshold indicating chaotic soundscapes (i.e., both unpleasant   |
|   390 | and eventful) in PNAs could be as low as 0.021 tu.                                      |
|   391 | Fluctuation Strength (F) is a psychoacoustic measure indicating the presence of low     |
|   392 | modulation frequencies in audio signal. Typically, F is associated with the presence    |
|   393 | of sounds sources such as the wind farm noise, yet in this study it was tied to         |
|   394 | human sounds, similarly as the tonality. This is not uncommon 53 , and it is a feature  |
|   395 | that was found to be positively associated with ISO Eventfulness and negatively         |
|   396 | associated with ISO Pleasantness in urban context as well. Based on linear              |
|   397 | regressions on collected data, a fluctuation strength higher than F > 1.78 vacil is     |
|   398 | likely to be causing negative ISO Pleasantness (ISO Pleasantness = 40.283 + 34.183      |
|   399 | F, p < 0.001, R 2 adj = 0.53), while an indicative threshold for ISO Eventful is 0.011  |
|   400 | vacil (ISO Eventfulness = 0.269 + 23.796 F, p < 0.001, R 2 adj = 0.45). Therefore, a    |
|   401 | fluctuation strength indicating chaotic soundscapes in PNAs would be F > 0.011          |
|   402 | vacil.                                                                                  |
|   403 | A practical implication for monitoring and assessment of soundscape in PNAs is that     |
|   404 | both subjective and objective measurements are necessary for accurate                   |
|   405 | characterisation following the ISO 12913 framework, while the ability to accurately     |
|   406 | monitor tonality and fluctuation strength on-site is more important than controlling    |
|   407 | sound pressure levels only. Moreover, applying management policies to improve           |
|   408 | sound-related behaviour of the visitors, .i.e. lowering their 'noise footprint' 57 , is |
|   409 | crucial for ensuring positive experience of natural areas for the visitors, such as the |
|   410 | one demonstrated by 58 .                                                                |
|   411 | Limitations and future pathways                                                         |
|   412 | PNAs are expected to feature a very high variability in human presence from             |
|   413 | overcrowded beauty spots and the associated walking paths and roads during the          |

|   414 | whole year, to the parts that almost never get visited. Both types of sites can suffer   |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   415 | from anthropogenic noise. This study is biased towards capturing the effect of           |
|   416 | overcrowding. However, even in such conditions, recruitment and obtaining                |
|   417 | consistent data can pose a challenge when compared to urban conditions. Method A         |
|   418 | presented in the Annex C of the ISO/TS 12913-2 was considered to provide a solid         |
|   419 | solution to characterize soundscape in PNAs using subjective questionnaire data          |
|   420 | and objective acoustic measurements. The large spread of responses within the            |
|   421 | two-dimensional circumplex space, and the large spread of measured                       |
|   422 | (psycho)acoustic indices confirm that.                                                   |
|   423 | However, it must be noted that conducting a soundwalk in a remote area brings up         |
|   424 | challenges related to the size of the area than can be covered, duration of the walk     |
|   425 | that is manageable to most participants, number of participants that cannot be too       |
|   426 | large before starting to bias the results and that the data are limited to the           |
|   427 | accessible hiking paths.                                                                 |
|   428 | While it can be argued that leading a soundwalk with a group of participants             |
|   429 | represents a less ecologically valid approach to characterizing soundscapes due to       |
|   430 | the bias of 'participants' presence' and the fact that participants at the last stop are |
|   431 | likely more attentive to the whole procedure than at the first stop, the authors         |
|   432 | argue that this approach still ensures the following key advantages compared to          |
|   433 | different sampling strategies, such as the one employed by 41 : 1) all the ratings       |
|   434 | from each listening stop relate to same environmental conditions, 2) a number of         |
|   435 | questionnaire responses can be collected in one day characterising a hiking path of      |
|   436 | up to 12 km length.                                                                      |
|   437 | The questionnaire tool chosen for this study based on its popularity for soundscape      |
|   438 | research 34 was developed by using sample locations characteristic for urban             |
|   439 | environments. Studies exploring the applicability of that tool for use in different      |
|   440 | context, such as indoor residential environment, have suggested some                     |
|   441 | modifications to the attributes used but have confirmed the underlying structure of      |
|   442 | a valence-arousal circumplex model. Therefore, it was considered adequate for this       |
|   443 | study and has provided meaningful results that can be interpreted in a logical way.      |
|   444 | However, as most of the responses are gathered along the diagonal between                |
|   445 | chaotic and calm soundscapes, future research might be needed to properly                |
|   446 | address the state of excitement while exploring wilderness, which might be               |
|   447 | different from calm, pleasant or vibrant dimensions.                                     |
|   448 | Negligible number of participants used the opportunity to provide more information       |
|   449 | in the open-ended Q9 (Do you have any comment on this listening point?). This is         |
|   450 | most likely because writing during a soundwalk in such locations could be                |
|   451 | considered impractical, so it speaks for the use of box-ticking questionnaires. For      |
|   452 | that reason, the use of short, structured interviews after the soundwalk sessions        |
|   453 | should be considered in future work to provide richer data sets and more                 |
|   454 | opportunities to interpret the questionnaire data accurately.                            |
|   455 | This work paved the way for future standardisation of soundscape investigations in       |
|   456 | PNAs and provided evidence for a sustainable approach to visitors' numbers and           |
|   457 | behaviour. The importance of investigating influence of exurban context on               |

458 soundscape has been highlighted together with some limitations of the current ISO 459 12913 framework when applied in large PNAs. Sound type categories and 460 psychoacoustic features displayed a clearly different pattern than those found in 461 urban context as visitors can easily become the most critical noise source 462 themselves.

## 463 Methods

464 This study is based on a mixed methods approach featuring the five participatory 465 walks conducted on-site where the subjective data was collected from the 466 participants via a questionnaire tool simultaneously with the short-term 467 environmental acoustic measurements.

## 468

## Sites

469 Five walking routes located within PNAs in the north of Italy (N=4) and Scotland, 470 United Kingdom (N=1) were investigated on a one-session-per-route basis, taking 471 place over a period of 14 months between April 2022 and June 2023. The protection 472 status of the natural areas investigated includes inscription at the UNESCO World 473 Heritage list  59  and National Park status  60 . The four walking routes in Italy are 474 located within the following three natural areas, all within the zones inscribed to The 475 Dolomites UNESCO World Heritage property: Parco naturale Fanes-Sennes Braies 476 (session Lago di Braies), Parco naturale Panaveggio - Pale di San Martino (sessions 477 Val Venegia and Passo Rolle) and Parco naturale Tre Cime (session Tre Cime di 478 Lavaredo). The walking route in the United Kingdom is within the Cairngorms 479 National Park (session Glen Lui). Throughout the text the five routes will be referred 480 to as per their respective session names in the Table 7, similar to the names chosen 481 in calls for participation via the webpage 61 .

None of the UNESCO documents related to the Dolomites World Heritage Property, available online at the corresponding UNESCO-managed webpage  59 , mention any the following keywords: sound, noise and/or acoustic. The Cairngorms National Park Authority documentation mentions the dominance of natural sounds within the section on Special Landscape Qualities - Visual and Sensory Qualities and provides brief descriptions of the auditory experiences specific to specific types of landscapes within the Park  62 . The section Good Design in National Park  63  mentions the potential of a well-designed development to reduce overall emissions, including noise, but the good design case studies provide no further details, according to the brief review by the authors.

## Questionnaire

The questionnaire was structured as per the Method A of the Annex C  36 , as follows: 1) basic demographic information, including familiarity with hiking ,2) sound source identification per sound type (sounds of technology, sounds of nature, sounds of human beings), 3) perceived affective quality of the present sound environment, 4) overall quality of the surrounding sound environment, 5) appropriateness of the surrounding sound environment to the present place. The Method A-type questionnaire was then expanded to capture more nuanced characterization of the sounds of nature, perceived overall visual quality of the present place, and participants' experience in mountain sports to account for the possible effect of familiarity. The questionnaire was administered in Italian and English, referring to  64 for the translation of perceptual attributes. Questionnaire items are described in Table 8, while the complete questionnaire in Italian and English is provided in Appendix A.

A total of 443 questionnaires was submitted in paper form. Data was cleaned during the manual entry into a digital form. No full questionnaire was discarded but

511

occasional missing data was observed, i.e. for certain questionnaire items, there are

- 512 no more than 435 responses available.

## 513 Participants

514 A total of 88 participants (Lago di Braies (N=14), Val Venegia (N=6), Passo Rolle 515 (N=18), Glen Lui (N=25), Tre Cime di Lavaredo (N=25)) have attended the five 516 walks. The reported mean age was 35.6 years old, with youngest participant of the 517 age 19 and the 77 being the eldest one, which makes for the age range of 58 years. 518 Four participants didn't report their age but were not excluded from the sample. 40 519 (45%) participants reported their gender as female, 45 (51%) as male and two (4%) 520 preferred not answering the question. 59 (67%) participants reported that they 521 often practice mountain sports such as hiking, outdoor climbing or skiing, while 29 522 (33%) participants reported that they do not practice those activities often. The 523 majority of participants across the five walks were different, with a small possibility 524 that a few attended multiple walks in Italy. This was not controlled for in the 525 analysis due to the data anonymization process. The participants were recruited 526 usually 1-2 months ahead of the soundwalk via public calls posted on social 527 networks. 528 As the research involved human participants, the study design was reviewed by the 529 Ethics Committee at the Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources, 530 University College London (registered under Z6364106/2023/05/08 social research), 531 while procedures in place at the Institutional Research Offices at EURAC Research 532 and University of Trento were followed for questionnaire administration based on 533 the principle of informed consent. This was collected in written form following the 534 online distribution of the Participation Information Sheet prior to each soundwalk. 535 Additionally, for all the soundwalks, a written consent for publication was provided 536 by participants to show individual images in the research publications and social 537 media, including online open access publications.

## 538 Audio recordings and environmental acoustic measurements

All audio recordings and measurements were performed by an operator wearing the head-mounted binaural microphone kit during the questionnaire, as shown in Figure 5 b). During some sessions a head and torso simulator was present as well, as shown in Figures 4 and 5 a), but that data was not used in this manuscript as the priority was given to the head-mounted kit for consistency. The front end devices varied between the sessions, but all the systems were Class 1 compliant and were calibrated following the same procedure using the 94 dB 1kHz sine wave generator for all sessions.

## Procedure

543 Each of the five routes featured a number of listening stops. A total of 28 evaluation 544 points (listening points) were recorded altogether (Lago di Braies (N=7), Val 545 Venegia (N=8), Paso Rolle (N=4), Glen Lui (N=6), Tre Cime di Lavaredo (N=3)). The 546 exact locations of the listening stops, shown in Figure 6, were recorded with the GPS 547 tool integrated in the binaural measurement kit and added manually where the 548 measurement device lost connection with the satellites.

|   555 | All the five walking routes were selected so most of the stops are within the         |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   556 | administrative borders of a protected natural area. It was expected that in a         |
|   557 | protected natural area where its management is focused on protection and tourism,     |
|   558 | visitors' expectations of the overall sensory experience would be higher so the       |
|   559 | message about possible issues with environmental noise would be received as           |
|   560 | stronger. Moreover, one of the walks (Lago di Braies) was selected knowingly that     |
|   561 | there is a high chance of encountering crowds. The locations of the listening spots   |
|   562 | were decided ahead of the walks by observing two key criteria: 1) distance in         |
|   563 | relation to the whole walk for pragmatic reasons, 2) diversity of sonic experiences   |
|   564 | that were to be expected during the walk, based on scouting. The authors believe      |
|   565 | this kind of sampling is inevitable in studies that combine research with public      |
|   566 | engagement and the research focus is not jeopardized in any way, i.e. a completely    |
|   567 | random location sampling wouldn't improve the level of quality at which the           |
|   568 | research questions are answered.                                                      |
|   569 | Participants and researchers walked along the predefined route as a group. While      |
|   570 | walking, participants were free to talk and interact with each other as the typical   |
|   571 | visitors would do. At each listening stop, researchers invited participants to face   |
|   572 | towards the same view as the researcher handling the binaural recording system or     |
|   573 | the head and torso simulator (Fig ure 4), and then, in silence, listened for a minute |
|   574 | and filled in a questionnaire. Meanwhile, the researchers collected at least 3        |
|   575 | minutes of calibrated binaural recordings before proceeding to the next listening     |
|   576 | point. This method aimed to ensure that the audio recorded by the operator            |
|   577 | corresponds to what participants heard while completing the questionnaire,            |
|   578 | accounting for certain small variability between the participants. During the         |
|   579 | expedition, team members also collected photos and video footage of the               |
|   580 | soundwalk for social media and outreach activities. However, care was taken not to    |
|   581 | disturb the listening moments, avoiding noise from cameras, operator movements,       |
|   582 | and drones.                                                                           |

## Data analysis

## 588

## Data cleaning

589 A total of 27 audio recordings was made. A data cleaning protocol was performed 590 where two researchers independently listened to each of the recordings and visually 591 inspected spectrograms using software package ArtemiS SUITE 12.9. Five 592 recordings were discarded due to excessive wind noise and weren't included in 593 further acoustic analyses. During the same listening sessions, 1-minute excerpts 594 were selected for the analysis, from the usually 3-minutes long recordings made on595 site.

## 596 Acoustic analysis

597 ArtemiS SUITE 12.9 software package  65  was employed to calculate environmental 598 acoustic metrics, following the recommendations from the ISO/TS 12913-2 and 599 ISO/TS 12913-3, as per Table 1.

## 600 Perceptual data

601 Following the recommendations from the Part 3 of the  66 , the following formula has 602 been applied to calculate coordinates of the perceptual outcomes of the eight 603 attributes in the Q5 and enable interpretation within the two-dimensional perceptual

- 604 space defined by the axes representing 'ISO Pleasantness' and 'ISO Eventfulness':

605 ISO Pleasantness = [( p -a ) + cos45°( ca -ch ) + cos45°( v -m )]/(4 + 32) 606 607 ISO Eventfulness = [( e -u ) + cos45°( ch -ca ) + cos45°( v - m )]/(4 + 32) 608 609 Where a is annoying, ca is calm, ch is chaotic, e is eventful, m is monotonous, p is 610 pleasant; u is uneventful, v is vibrant. 611 Statistical analysis 612 Ten Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMM) were computed, as shown in Table 4, with 613 the following aims: LMM1 to explore associations between soundscape perception 614 and the perceived sound source dominance, perceived visual quality and 615 soundscape, while accounting for individual age, gender, and habit of experiencing 616 the mountains (regular vs occasional visitor) (RQ1); LMM2 to LMM10 were designed 617 as single parameter models and computed to test the ability of a set of nine 618 acoustic and psychoacoustic metrics to predict soundscape perception. Models are 619 described in Table 9.

622 The experimental activity employed two independent factors with different levels 623 each: Site (five levels) as a between-subject factor, and Evaluation Point (between 3 624 and 7 levels depending on the Site) as a within-subject factor.

625 Considering the repeated-measure nature of the experimental design, the authors 626 adopted Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMM) using the statistical software R  67  and 627 the R packages lme4 68 , considering multiple LMMs for each dependent variable. 628 The basic theory of the LMM is that subjects' responses are the sum of fixed factors, 629 which are the variables of interest controlled during the study, and random factors 630 that can influence the covariance of the data.

631 Concerning the generation of the model, the independent variables used as fixed 632 effects were survey scores and measured acoustic parameters. Participants were 633 treated as a random factor. A random intercept varying among Sites and Evaluation 634 Points was included in each model concerning the nested random effects (i.e.,

|   635 | Evaluation Points nested in Sites). In addition, a by-subject random intercept was    |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   636 | added to estimate the variance in the outcomes related to the different individuals   |
|   637 | 69 . The specification of the general final model was as follows:                     |
|   638 | Dependent Variable ~ Independent Variable + (1|SiteID /EvaluationPointID)             |
|   639 | (1|Participant_SiteID)                                                                |
|   640 | Ten models were created and tested for each dependent variable, i.e., ISO             |
|   641 | Pleasantness and ISO Eventfulness scores, thus resulting in a total of twenty         |
|   642 | computed LMMs.                                                                        |
|   643 | LMMs were computed after verifying the assumption of normality and homogeneity        |
|   644 | of residual data distributions. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) or Generalized VIF    |
|   645 | (GVIF), in case of categorical predictor, were computed to diagnose collinearity for  |
|   646 | each predictor.                                                                       |
|   647 | Once the models were computed, it was of interest to carry out a comparison to        |
|   648 | select the one(s) with the highest predictive power given the data, especially within |
|   649 | the (psycho)acoustic-based models (LMM2 to 10) and between perceptual-based           |
|   650 | (LMM1) and (psycho)acoustic-based models (LMM2 to 10). The Akaike Information         |
|   651 | Criterion (AIC) was used to compare the quality of the hypothesised models. The       |
|   652 | model with the smallest AIC has the highest predictive power and a two unit           |
|   653 | difference on AICs (ΔAIC=2) is usually considered a threshold for evidence of a       |
|   654 | difference in the models 70 . In addition, to compare the accuracy of the tested      |
|   655 | models and represent the proportion of the total variance explained by the fixed      |
|   656 | effects and by both fixed and random effects, the marginal (R 2 m ) and conditional   |
|   657 | (R 2 c ) coefficients of determination were generated for each model. Indexes were    |
|   658 | estimated using the function r.squaredGLMM from the MuMIn package 71,72 to be         |
|   659 | interpreted using the recommended thresholds for a minimum (0.20), moderate           |
|   660 | (0.50), and strong (0.80) effect size 73 .                                            |
