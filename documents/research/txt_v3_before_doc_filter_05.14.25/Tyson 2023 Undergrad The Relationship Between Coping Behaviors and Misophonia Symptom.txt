ABSTRACT  
Misophonia is a complex disorder  that is characterized by  an extreme disliking of 
sounds. Individuals with misophonia may engage in anxiety -driven coping behaviors that 
constitute avoidance and safety behaviors. Current literature shows that while coping 
behavior may offer temporary relief of anxiety and distress, they can lead to persisting 
anxiety and avoidance of experiences.  Given preliminary evidence demonstrating a link 
between coping behaviors and maintained or wor sening symptoms, additional research is 
warranted to further understand the role of coping behaviors in misophonia . However, 
few studies have investigated the relationship between coping behaviors and maintenance 
or worsening of misophonia symptom severity  and related  impairment. As such, t he aims 
of the current study were to 1) examine the correlation between the use of  coping 
behaviors deployed before, during, and after misophonia triggers on misophonia 
symptom severity and impairment and 2) investigate t he mediating role of coping 
behaviors on trigger count and misophonia symptom severity. The sample included 62 
community members ( M = 28.6 years ; 82.1% female; 79.1% White) who  screened 
positive for misophonia. Participants completed self -report questionnaires. Bivariate 
correlations indicated that c oping behaviors (before, during, and after  misophonia 
trigger s) were significantly correlated with misophonia symptom severity and 
impairmen t, supporting our hypotheses . Counter to prediction, the  total frequency of 
coping behaviors was not a significant mediator of trigger count and misophonia 
symptom severity. The findings indicate that future research should consider exposure

vi 
thera py and reducing avoidance -related coping behaviors as an effective treatment for a 
reduction of misophonia symptom  and severity.

Introduction  
Misophonia, also known as selective sound sensitivity, is a complex neurophysiological 
condition in which individuals experience strong aversive reactions (e.g., anxiety, disgu st, anger) 
to specific sound triggers ( Brout  et al., 2018; Cavanna & Seri, 2015). Common trigger sounds 
include chewing, crunching of foods, throat clearing, pen clicking, and slurping ( Taylor, 2017 ). 
Misophonia is a devastating disorder, significantly impairing individuals as they experience a 
strong disliking of sounds  and increased emotional responses to trigger sounds (Kumar et al., 
2017; Swedo et al., 2021). Tolerance duration, defined as the length of time they can tolerate 
various tr igger sounds without having a response depending on the type of sound, and overall 
symptom severity var ies in this population ( Brout  et al., 2018; Vanaja & Abigail , 
2020).  Misophonia was first identified in the early 2000s; however, research investigating its 
prevalence, comorbidity, and possible etiological factors has advanced  in recent years (Palumbo 
et al., 2018). Prevalence rates f or misophonia have been found to vary between populations, with 
estimates ranging from 12.8 -20% (Kiliç  et al., 2021; Potgie ter et al., 2019). On average, 
symptoms develop for individuals around twelve years of age and are known to worsen over 
time ( Kumar et al., 2017 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ).  
There is a range of misophonia symptoms, including audiologic, physiological , and 
psychological symptoms. Kumar et al., (2017) observed that trigger sounds were connected to 
hyperactivity in the anterior insular cortex for individuals with misophonia compared to control 
groups. Subjective experiences of physiological arousal include increases in perceived pressure

2 
in the chest, arms, head, or whole body through clenched muscles in some misophonic 
individuals (Cowan et al., 2022; Fioretti et al., 2014). Physiological reactions occur in other 
aspects of the body as well,  including higher heart rates and skin conductance responses when 
hearing a misophonic trigger, but not when hearing an unpleasant stimulus ( Brout  et al., 2018; 
Kumar et al., 2017). Individuals with misophonia additionally tend to experience a range of 
emotional responses to triggers including anger, disgust, and anxiety ( Brout  et al., 
2018).  Although there is not yet a formal diagnostic  classification for misophonia (Vanaja & 
Abigail , 2020),  many researchers have drawn parallels between misophonia and psyc hological 
disorders, and in particular, anxiety disorders ( Taylor, 2017 ).  
One key similarity between misophonia and anxiety disorders is the engagement in 
anxiety -driven coping behaviors, which may also be described as avoidance and safety 
behaviors, in r esponse to the intense emotional reactivity to trigger sounds (Cowan et al., 2022). 
These behaviors may be performed overtly (i.e., in a way that is observable to others, such as 
wearing headphones) or covertly (e.g., attempting to ignore the sound) (Ball & Gunaydin, 2022; 
Cowan et al., 2022; Rachman et al., 2008; Thwaites & Freeston, 2005). Current cognitive -
behavioral models of anxiety and related disorders posit that coping behaviors offer temporary 
relief of anxiety and distress by facilitating escape o r distraction from perceived threat; however, 
they can lead to persisting anxiety and avoidance of experiences (Rachman et al., 2008). In the 
long-term, previously adaptive coping behaviors become increasingly maladaptive when the 
situation is perceived as  threatening but poses no actual danger and the individual consistently 
avoids it (Ball & Gunaydin, 2022; Thwaites & Freeston, 2005).  For instance, an individual with

3 
PTSD may initially avoid the location where trauma occurred, but then begin to avoid all places 
that are similar (Ball & Gunaydin, 2022). Avoidance -based coping behaviors (including safety 
behaviors) maintain anxiety symptoms because individuals inadvertently forgo opportunities to 
learn that situations or experiences, although perceived as th reatening, are safe and that distress 
can be tolerated (Ball & Gunaydin, 2022). Consequently, the individual continues to experience 
distress and impairment through associative and non -associative mechanisms.  Associative 
learning through classical conditio ning strengthens an individual’s misophonia (Palumbo et al., 
2018). Non-associative learning results in habituation or sensitization; sensitization means 
increased activity in response to a misophonic stimulus (Palumbo et al., 2018). Misophonic 
reactions a re posited to be a  conditioned learning response to aversive, trigger stimuli (Dozier, 
2015). Individuals with misophonia report that their reactions to trigger sounds are involuntary , 
suggesting that it is a  conditioned reflex or a sensitized response to hearing aversive stimuli 
(Dozier, 2015; Palumbo et al., 2018). Continued use of coping behaviors strengthen s both the 
associative learning and non -associative learning mechanisms of misophonia (Palumbo et al., 
2018). 
Coping behavior s related to misophonia appear to present and function similarly to those 
common for concerns, such as anxiety disorders. Existing literature reveals that individuals 
engage in coping behaviors that are conceptually related to the threat, meaning the anxie ty 
complaint and perceived threat typically encourage individuals to engage in a coping behavior 
that addresses the specific threat (Telch & Lancaster , 2012). In misophonia, this often means that 
individuals engage in coping behaviors that are directly rel ated to the misophonic trigger. For

4 
example, individuals with misophoni a may remove themselves from situations where the sound  
is present, ask others to stop making the sound , or engage in other sound -related strategies  during 
the interaction,  such as  watc hing TV on mute, wearing earplugs around misophonic triggers, 
mimicking trigger sounds, being aware of the sounds they make, distracting oneself from sounds 
that are made, or reciting positive internal dialogue (Cowan et al., 2022; Edelstein et al., 2013; 
Vanaja & Abigail , 2020).  Coping  behaviors are used before hearing a trigger sound to avoid  
hearing the sound ( e.g., distraction, using a different sound; Dozier & Mitchell , 2022 ). Typically, 
an individual experiences anticipatory anxiety related to trigger sounds and responds with 
avoidance behaviors (Dozier , 2015).  Coping behaviors used during hearing a trigger sound are 
used to help relieve the intense emotional reactions ( e.g., covering ears, cognitive restructuring; 
Dozier & Mitchell , 2022 ). Copi ng behaviors used after hearing a trigger sound focus on reducing 
emotional distress, while performing a mental review of the sound, enforcing learning that the 
sound is intolerable ( e.g., relaxation exercises, doing something comforting; Dozier & Mitchell , 
2022 ). Avoiding trigger sounds is associated with higher levels of distress and anger in 
individuals with misophonia (Cowan et al., 2022). Social isolation can occur when individuals 
commonly avoid situations and others due to the possibility of hearing misophonic triggers 
(Cowan et al., 2022).  Despite when an individual engages in a coping behavior, literature shows 
that these behaviors  perpetuate misophonia symptom severity and impairment ( Dozier & 
Mitchell , 2022 ).  
One important direction for  the expan sion of this research is the examination of the 
connection s between the utilization of coping behaviors and misophonia symptom severity  and

5 
impairment. Given preliminary evidence demonstrating a link between coping behaviors and 
maintained or worsening sym ptoms (Rachman et al., 2008), additional research is warranted to 
further extrapolate the role of these  behaviors in misophonia.  This study addresses several 
limitations in the current literature , specifically the limited understanding o f the maintenance of 
misophonia. This is significant to identify more effective treatments as research on interventions 
is underdeveloped . This study accomplishes this by examining the significance of the temporal 
incidence of when individuals utilize copin g behaviors related to misophonic triggers. We 
believe that the temporal incidence of coping behaviors will be significant because coping before 
commonly prevents an individual from interacting with aversive stimuli, while coping during 
and coping after mo re commonly correspond with the emotional reactions of hearing the sound 
(Ball & Gunaydin, 2022). Given the limited research on misophonia , the first aim sought to 
describe the triggers, emotions, coping behaviors, and impairment of misophonia. The second 
aim was to explore associations between the timing of the utilization of coping behaviors, 
symptom severity, and impairment related to misophonia. First, w e predicted that coping 
behaviors before hearing a misophonic trigger would be correlated with higher  symptom severity 
and impairment. Second, we  predicted that engaging in coping behaviors while hearing a 
misophonic trigger would be associated with higher symptom severity and impairment. Third, 
we hypothesized that engaging in coping behaviors after hear ing a misophonic trigger would be 
associated with higher symptom severity and impairment. Lastly, the t hird aim sought to  test the 
mediating role of coping behaviors in the relation between trigger count and misophonia 
symptom severity. Given e xisting research showing that higher anxiety symptom severity

6 
correlated to coping behaviors (Ball & Gunaydin , 2022) and misophonia trigger sounds  are 
related to symptom type and severity (Edelstein et al., 2013) , we hypothesize d that coping would 
mediate the association between trigger count and higher symptom severity.

Methods   
Participants and Procedures  
To examine misophonia and the behaviors related to it, individuals from the Oxford, 
Lafayette County , and University of Mississippi  communit ies were r ecruited  for a larger study  
through flyers, online and print advertisements, clinics, announcement boards, and word of 
mouth. Individuals who contacted or were contacted by study personnel were asked screening 
questions to assess eligibility. Individuals w ho passed the screening questions were invited to 
participate in two in -person laboratory sessions and a hearing evaluation. To participate in the 
current study, individuals had to be aged 18 -65 years old , have normal hearing and vision , and 
had to screen positive for misophonia . Individuals were excluded from the current study if they 
were : a) unable  to complete all three study sessions due to known scheduling conflict s, b) unable 
to complete English -language questionnaires , or c)  experiencing current high risk 
psychopathology symptoms including psychosis, a current manic episode, or suicidal or 
homicidal ideation.    
Participants were compensated up to $100 for completion of all three study sessions.   For 
the purposes of this study , only self -report data from the first session w as examined . In the 
current sample, 67 participants met the standards for misophonia.  The age ranged between 18 and 
61 years ( M = 28.57 years, SD = 11.84), and most participants were female (82.1%) and White 
(79.1%) . See Table 1 for a summary of demographic characteristics.    
In the first session, participants provided written informed consent, and then completed  
self-report questionnaires  and structured diagnostic interviews assessing for misophonia, mood,

8 
anxiety, personality, and other related disorders (i.e., Diagnostic Interview for Anxiety, Mood, 
and Obsessive -Compulsive and related Neuropsychiatric Disorders [DIAMOND] and Diagnostic 
Interview for Psychological Distress [DIPD]). All study procedures were approved by the 
University of Mississippi’s Institutional Review Board (IRB).    
Measures   
Demographics   
Demographic information was obtained through a self -report questionnaire developed by 
the researchers. Participants answered questions about gender, rac ial/ethnic background, 
relationship status, education, and employment.    
WSAS   
The Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) (see Appendix A) is valid and reliable 
(Mundt & Marks et al., 200 2) five question, self -report questionnaire about functional 
impairment (Mundt & Marks et al., 2002).  In this study, participants were asked to respond to 
each item by considering how their misophonia symptoms affected each area.  For example, the 
item “Because of my misophonia , my ability to work is impai red” assesses interference with 
work due to misophonia. Items are rated using a 9 -point scale ranging from zero (not at all) to 
eight (very severely impaired).  The WSAS items are summed to create a total score – a total 
score above 20 represent ing severe c linical impairment, a score between 10 and 20 represent ing 
significant impairment, and a score below 10 represent ing subclinical results (Mundt et al., 
2002). The WSAS has demonstrated good test -retest reliability, with 0.73 correlation (Mundt et 
al., 2002 ). See Appendix A.

A-MISO -S  
The Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A -MISO -S) is a 6 -item self -report questionnaire 
adapted from the Yale -Brown Obsessive -Compulsive Scale (Y -BOCS) ( Schröder  et al., 2013). 
The Y -BOCS has previously been adapted for other disorder s and was found to be reliable and 
valid ( Schröder  et al., 2013). The A -MISO -S assesses how much time an individual spends 
preoccupied with sounds, interference with daily activities, distress associated with trigger 
sounds, effort spent resisting thinking  about the sounds, control over thoughts about sounds, and 
avoidance of the stimuli (Naylor et al., 2020). Individuals rate questionnaire statements using a 
5-point Likert -type scale ranging from 0 to 4. For example, the question “Have you been 
avoiding do ing anything, going any place, or being with anyone because of your misophonia,” 
with the possible responses “no deliberate avoidance, minimal avoidance, some avoidance, much 
avoidance, or very extensive avoidance.”  Scores are totaled and range from sub -clinical [0 -4], 
mild [5 -9], moderate [10 -14], severe [15 -19], and extreme [20 -24]. Scores over five are 
considered clinically significant ; however, the clinical cutoff is a score greater than or equal to 
ten (Naylor et al., 2020).  See Appendix B.  
Duke Misoph onia Questionnaire   
The Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ) is an 86 -item, self -report assessment for 
misophonia (Rosenthal et al., 2021). The DMQ lists 14 common misophonia triggers. Two 
composite scales , Symptom Severity and Coping , are comprised of nine subscales: Trigger 
Frequency, Affective Responses, Physiological Responses, Cognitive Responses, Coping Before, 
Coping During, Coping After, Impairment, and Beliefs. To test hypotheses in this study, the

10 
Coping subscales were examined. The Coping Before subscale has six items  and measures 
behaviors used before hearing a trigger sound , such as “I avoided certain people, places, or 
things, so I would not have to hear sounds I dislike .” The Coping  During has 10 items  and 
assesses behaviors used while hearing a trigger sound w ith items such as “I produced an alternate 
sound.”  Lastly, the Coping After subscale assesses behaviors used after hearing a trigger sound 
with five items (e.g., “ I did something to comfor t myself”)  items (Rosenthal et al., 2021). The 
Coping Subscales are  each rated on a scale from 0 (Never) to 4 (Almost Always/Always)  
(Rosenthal et al., 2021). In addition, the Trigger Frequency, Affective Responses, and 
Physiological Responses subscales we re used to characterize the sample’s misophonia 
symptoms. The Trigger Frequency subscale includes a checklist of misophonia trigger sounds 
(e.g., eating or drinking mouth sounds), and participants are asked to endorse their triggers. This 
scale was also us ed to evaluate the third aim of this study (i.e., mediation analysis). The endorsed 
items were summed to create a total item. The Affective Responses subscale assesses eight 
emotional reactions (e.g., angry, anxious) to misophonia triggers on a Likert -type scale ranging 
from 0 (never) to 4 (always/almost always). Lastly, the Physiological Responses subscale assess 
five physiological symptoms (e.g., trembled or shuddered) experienced in response to 
misophonia triggers on a 0 (never) to 4 (always/almost alway s) Likert -type scale. The DMQ is a 
reliable and valid measure of misophonia symptoms and behaviors (Rosenthal et al., 2021).  See 
Appendix C.

Results   
Misophonia  Characteristics   
On the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire, participants reported between 2 to 14 triggers, 
with a mean of 8.74 triggers ( SD = 2.62). Our Duke Misophonia Questionnaire results indicate  
that our sample was most sensitive to mouth sounds while eating or drinking ( n = 59, 95.2%), 
people making repetitive sounds ( n = 52, 83.9%), people m aking nasal / throat sounds ( n = 49, 
79.0%), and people making mouth sounds when not eating ( n = 49, 79.0%).  With regards to the 
temporal incidence of coping behaviors, coping before and coping during had higher mean 
scores than coping after; the most comm only endorsed behaviors were listening to music or a 
different sound ( m = 2.92, SD = 1.04), focusing their attention on an activity ( m = 2.73, SD = 
1.07), and using a different sound to drown out bothersome sound ( m = 2.69, SD = 1.30). See 
Table 2 for a summary of misophonia specific coping behaviors. Our participants reported a 
wide range of emotional, physiological, and cognitive symptoms on the DMQ , including  
frustration ( m = 3.18, SD = 1.12), becoming rigid or stiff ( m = 2.27, SD = 1.38), and thinking 
“how do I make this sound stop” ( m = 3.21, SD = 1.06) were the most endorsed symptoms 
respectively. See Table 3 for a summary of misophonia specif ic symptoms.  
Descriptive Statistics and Bivariate Correlations   
The mean WSAS total score was 11.82 ( SD = 7.90).  On the WSAS, 50.0% ( n = 31) of the 
participants met the cutoff indicating clinical levels of impairment  (Mundt  & Marks et al., 200 2). 
On the A -MISO -S, 71.0% (n = 44) of the participants met the 10 -score cutoff recommended for a 
clinical misophonia diagnosis (Naylor et al., 2020) , with an average total score of 11.71 ( SD =

12 
3.50) . On the Duke Questionnaire, the mean Coping Before score was 2. 11 (SD = 0.89), 
suggesting an average frequency of coping behaviors before hearing a misophonic sounds as 
“sometimes.” The mean Coping During score was 2.02 ( SD = 0.58), suggesting an average 
frequency of coping behaviors while hearing a trigger as “someti mes.” The mean Coping After 
score was 0.35 ( SD = 0.18), suggesting an average frequency of coping behaviors as “never.” 
The mean total coping score was 1.49 (SD = 0.49), suggesting an average total frequency for 
coping behaviors of “rarely.”    
Bivariate correlational analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between 
temporal occurrence of coping behaviors  and misophonia  symptom severity  (A-MISO -S) and 
impairment  (WSAS) . Consistent with Hypothesis 1, coping behaviors utilized before he aring a 
trigger w ere associated with greater symptom severity (r = .687, p <.001) and impairment ( r = 
.544, p = .000). Consistent with Hypothesis 2, coping behaviors utilized while hearing a trigger 
were associated with greater symptom severity (r = .502, p = .001) and impairment ( r = .347, p = 
.007). Consistent with Hypothesis 3, coping behaviors utilized after hearing a misophonic trigger 
were associated with greater symptom severity (r = .411, p = .001) and impairment (r = .405, p = 
.001). Thus, results indicated that higher engagement in coping behaviors w as associated with 
higher impairment levels and higher symptom severity of misophonia. This finding was observed 
across  the three  subscales of coping behaviors.  See Table 4 for a summary of associations  
between study variables.  
Mediation Analysis

13 
To further evaluate the relationships between  the number of trigger sounds, coping, and 
symptom severity, a mediation analysis was conducted through the SPSS analyses PROCESS 
(Hayes, 2022).  PROCESS estimates the indirect effect through bootstrapping.  Mediation 
analyses focus on testing and identifying potential causal relationships between variables ( Agler 
and Boeck, 2017).  This study used 5,000 resamples with a 95% confidence interval. Spec ifically, 
it was hypothesized that  the total frequency of coping behaviors would be a mediator for the 
effect of  the number of misophonia trigger sounds on misophonia symptom severity. Figure 1 
depicts the paths. The t otal effect model, or c path (i.e., nu mber of trigger sounds to misophonia 
symptom severity) was significant (b = .40, SE=.17, p = .022, CI: .06 to .75).  The a path 
indicated number of trigger sounds was not a significant predictor of the average frequency of  all 
coping behaviors , b = .03, SE=.02, p =.163, CI: -.01 to .08 . The b path indicated that the average 
total frequency of coping behaviors was a significant predictor of  misophonia symptom severity , 
b = 4.54, SE=.73, p < .001, CI: 3.08 to 6.0 1. The direct effect ( c’ path)  from numb er of trigger 
sounds to misophonia symptom severity  was not significant, b = .25, SE = .14, p = .072, CI: -.02 
to .52 . The indirect path from number of trigger sounds to average frequency of all coping 
behaviors to symptom severity (a path x b path) was no t significant, indicating that average 
frequency of all coping behaviors is not a significant mediator of the relationship between 
number of trigger sounds and symptom severity, b = .16, SE=.13, CI: -.09 to .42 (See Figure 1).

Discussion  
Few studies have  investigated the associations between  the utilization of coping  
behaviors and misophonia symptom severity  and functional impairment . Thus, the purpose of the 
present study was to examine temporal engagement in  coping behaviors, a factor known to affect 
anxiety  and thought to similarly influence misophonia  symptom severity and impairment 
(Thwaites & Freeston , 2005) , among individuals with misophonia . Examining the role of coping 
behaviors in relation to misophonia symptom severity and impairment may inform the 
identification of potential treatment plans for misophonia. Understanding these relationships will 
be critical for treatment, as it is essential to educate the patient on the effect of their use of coping 
behaviors on their misophonia symptom severity and impairment (Frank & McKay, 2019).  This 
information is of particular importance for future healthcare providers to consider regarding 
misophonia treatment given the prevalence of misophonia, estimated at 12.8 -20% ( Kiliç  et al., 
2021; Potgieter  et al., 2019). Additionally, the present study adds to the limited literature 
pertaining  to coping behaviors and misophonia symptom severity and impairment by 
investigating the correlations between subscales of coping behaviors.  
With regard to  impairment, participants in this study ranged from slightly to definitely 
impaired in regard to social leisure activities and maintaining close relationships. Wu et al. 
(2014) found that  in individuals who met the clinical cutoff for misophonia, around ha lf of the 
participants experience d moderate or high levels of functional impairment in school and work 
function, and around 20% experienced moderate or high levels of social and family functional 
impairment. Previous literature shows that clinically signif icant misophonia severity is correlated

15 
to higher impairment across work and school, social, and family and home (Wu et al., 2014; 
Zhou et al., 2017). This is consistent with our research, as a strong positive correlation  was found 
between misophonia sympt om severity and impairment. This finding is significant because it 
continues to show that misophonia symptom severity is related to impairment in all aspects of 
life. Although these measures generally assess the same functional impairment constructs, direct 
comparisons of clinical scores  should be interpreted with caution as there is variability in the 
measures. Examining specific factors that could influence the relationship between misophonia 
symptom severity and impairment is crucial, as misophonia s ymptoms commonly interfere with 
daily activities (Edelstein et al., 2013; Schröder  et al., 2013 ; Wu et al., 2014 ). 
Our results are consistent with previous literature that eating sounds, smacking, pen 
clicking, and clock ticking were the worst trigger soun ds (Edelstein et al., 2013). However, there 
is a specificity in trigger sounds from person to person (Edelstein et al., 2020). Trigger sounds 
are traditionally background noise s for most individuals , but individuals with misophonia  suffer 
from a hyper -fixation  on these sounds (Edelstein et al., 2013). The significance placed on these 
sounds leads to concentration issues in academic and occupational settings (Swedo et al., 2021). 
Inability to finish tasks and perform well is common w ith misophonia  sufferers who are 
commonly around misophonic triggers (Swedo et al., 2021). On the DMQ, the most common 
emotional reactions upon hearing a bothersome sound were feeling frustrated , anxious , and 
jittery. This  result  is consistent with previou s literature , which has found irritation is experienced 
in over half of the participant sample upon hearing a trigger sound ( Schröder  et al., 2013). In a 
previous study , individuals  were found to endorse  anxiety or stress about a trigger but  were not

16 
fearf ul of the sound (Edelstein et al., 2013), which was consistent with our data. The DMQ lists 
five common physiological reactions for misophonia . In this study , the most commonly reported 
physiological reaction was becoming rigid or stiff when intensely both ered by a sound. This 
result is consistent with previous research about the physiological reactions of misophonia 
(Edelstein et al., 2013).  Misophonia can severely impair an individual’s life due to these 
psychological and physiological symptoms (Edelstein et al., 2020).  
With regard to the most common coping behaviors, individuals endorsed using different 
sounds to drown out bothersome sounds , block the sound, and focus their attention on an 
activity. The utilization of these coping behaviors is consistent with previous research about the 
types of coping behaviors individuals with misophonia use to deal with trigger sounds (Edelstein 
et al., 2 013; Cowan et al., 2022). Edelstein et al. (2013) found that individuals avoid certain 
situations where the sound might be present, try to “cancel out” the sound, or use earplugs or 
music to cover bothersome sounds.  
Consistent with our hypotheses, engagin g in coping behaviors before, during, and after 
hearing a misophonia trigger w as significantly correlated with higher symptom severity and 
worse impairment. The  correlation between coping before hearing a misophonic trigger and 
impairment suggests a relati onship between coping before and impairment, which could further 
support the idea that coping is a maintaining factor for misophonia as well as other disorders.  
Out of the three coping subscales, coping  prior to encountering misophonia triggers was  the most 
strongly correlated to impairment and misophonia symptom severity . Within the literature, 
engaging in coping before interacting with an unpleasant or feared stimulus is linked to

17 
anticipatory anxiety (Telch & Lancaster , 2012)  and negative reinfor cement ( Pittig et al., 2018 ). 
Anticipatory anxiety reflects an obsession with feared stimuli, so an individual will increase 
utilization of coping behaviors which will in turn increase anxiety related to the stimuli (Telch & 
Lancaster , 2012). Coping behavi ors negatively reinforce anxiety related to a stimulus because 
there is a temporary reduction in aversive feelings . However , this conditions the individual to 
maintain their coping mechanisms, in turn maintaining their anxiety (Pittig et al., 2018; Telch &  
Lancaster, 2012). This pattern  is reflected in our data through the strong positive correlation 
between coping before hearing a misophonic trigger and symptom severity and impairment. This 
is consistent with pre vious research. Specifically, i ndividuals wi th misophonia perceive  trigger 
sounds with an increased attention or obsession, which may amplif y the negative reaction and 
perception of the sound ( Vanaja & Abigail , 2020). Responses are typically learned specifically to 
one individual, then become generalized to any situation where the sound is made (Dozier , 
2015). Fear generalization occurs when an individual gradually begins to generalize a neutral 
stimulus categor ically related to the feared or unpleasant stimulus, increasing anxiety and 
avoidance ( Christian & Levinson, 2022 ). Generalization sustains and heightens anxiety and 
avoidance related to conditioned stimuli (Christian & Levinson, 2022).  
Our hypothesis tha t coping would mediate the association between trigger count and 
symptom severity was not supported by the current  analyses. In the mediation model, the total 
effect model was significant. Both trigger sounds and the total frequency of coping behaviors are 
predictors for misophonia symptom severity . However,  there was no  indirect effect of the 
number of trigger sounds on symptom severity through average frequency of all coping

18 
behaviors . In addition, the direct pathway from number of trigger so unds to misophonia 
symptom severity was not significant . The absence of findings may be explained by potential 
issues with the method of measurement for the trigger sounds and coping variables. Specifically , 
the average frequency of all coping behaviors may be an underestimate  as the average considers 
responses across all coping behaviors; therefore,  an individual who only uses one coping 
behavior  (albeit constantly) would have a fairly low  score. Therefore, this item considers the 
variability and frequency  of engagement in coping behaviors, rather than total engagement in 
coping behaviors. A more accurate assessment of coping may be time spent engaging in coping 
behaviors.  Secondly, the absence of findings may be explained by potential issues with the 
metho d of measurement for total trigger count. Specifically, the sum total count of trigger sounds 
may be an underestimate, because an individual may have one distressing sound they are 
exposed to constantl y; therefore, an individual who experiences high levels  of distress from only 
one sound would have a fairly low score. Our measures simplify the experience that an 
individual has. Future research should consider examining time spent exposed to one sound or 
which sounds are most distressing to the individual. A more accurate assessment of trigger count 
and impact would help clarify the individual variability between the number  and type of trigger 
sounds and coping behaviors.    
Limitations  
Several limitations warrant consideration in future investigations. First, the methodology 
relied on self -report measures. Although the measures are  validated measures, replication of this 
study with the addition of  formal diagnostic assessments conducted by psychology specialists

19 
may enhance the clinical application of these findings. Second, the study’s cross -sectional design 
prohibits casual inferences. In the future, longitudinal or experimental studies may be able to 
help experimenters to infer the dir ectionality of  behaviors . That is, does greater reliance on  
coping behavior s worsen misophonia symptom severity  or do individuals with worse misophonia 
symptoms initiate a greater number of coping behaviors over time.  A third limitation is that the 
sample primarily included female ( 82.1%) and white ( 79.1%) participants, which limits the 
scope of understanding how coping behaviors are correlated to misophonia symptom severity 
and impairment among individuals with diverse demographics. Although women represent the 
majority of misophonia cases in prior studies ( Potgieter  et al., 2021), future research including a 
more demographically diverse sample would improve the generalizability of the findings. 
However, this can be a limitation because these sample s could also be biased, or men might not 
be presenting themselves for treatment. Lastly, this investigation uses measures with 
predetermined lists of triggers. Future research should explore the role of all possible triggers to 
identify and evaluate how tr iggers truly affect misophonia symptom severity and impairment. 
The limited nature of research on misophonia limits what is known about different presentations 
of misophonia . For example, it is unknown if it is more common for an individual to endorse two 
triggers or ten . This information  is crucial for potential treatment because an individual may be 
exposed to one severely distressing sound constantly and experience high levels of impairment, 
or someone may be exposed to ten mildly distressing sounds and only experience mild functional 
impairment. Future research must investigate the differences in presentations due to trigger count 
to develop effective treatment.

20 
Despite these limitations, results of the present study contribute to greater understanding 
of the associations between the different types of  coping behaviors associated with misophonic 
trigger s for the maintenance and worsening of symptom severity and impairment. Research 
investigating the impact of trigger count, intensity, and coping strategi es on symptom severity is 
novel and new. Additional research is needed to fully understand the relationship between trigger 
count, coping, and misophonia symptom severity and impairment.  Using this information, 
researchers may find direction for appropriate treatment options for individuals with misophonia , 
as distress reduction will be crucial for treatment (Frank & McKay, 2019) . Research on effective 
treatment for anxiety and fear disorders reveals that exposure therapy and reducing avoidance -
related coping behaviors is the most effective treatment for a reduction of symptoms ( Hofmann 
& Hay, 2018 ). Avoidance is reinforced as there is a temporary reduction in aversive symptoms,  
however, the individual is never learning to deal with the stimuli (Ho fmann & Hay, 2018). For 
misophonia, this looks like an individual engaging in coping behaviors (e.g., blocking trigger 
sound, mimicking trigger, avoiding situation where sound may be present), which leads to 
maintenance of symptoms and impairment. Educatin g patients on the correlation between coping 
behaviors and learning will be important as engaging with trigger sounds could be a way to 
reduce misophonia symptom severity and impairment.

Name: ______________________________________________    Date: _____________  
Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A -MISO -S)*  
Rate the characteristics of each item during the prior week up until and including the time you fill out 
this survey.  Scores should reflex  the average (mean) occurrence of each item for the entire week.  
“Sounds” can mean any misophonic trigger (sound, sight, touch, motion, etc.)

5 times a day)    1  
Moderate , 1 to 3 hrs /day, or frequent (thoughts about) sounds (no more than 8 
times a day, most of the hours are unaffected).    2  
Severe , greater than 3 hrs and up to 8 hrs/day or very frequent (thoughts 
about) sounds.    3  
Extreme , greater than 8 hrs /day or near constant (thoughts about) sounds.    4  
  
2. How much do these misophonic sounds interfere with your social, work or role

sounds, not generalized irritation or irritation associated with other c onditions.)  
None    0  
Mild , occasional irritation/distress.    1  
Moderate , disturbing irritation/anger/disgust, but still manageable.    2

sounds? How successful are you in stopping or diverting your thinking about the misophonic sounds? 
Can you dismiss them?   
Complete control.     0  
Much control , usually able to stop or divert thoughts about misophonic 
sounds.    1  
Moderate control , sometimes able to stop or divert thoughts about 
misophonic sounds.    2

35 
Little control , rarely successful in stopping or dismissing thoughts about 
misophonic sounds, can only divert attention with difficulty.    3  
No control , experience thoughts as completely involuntary, rarely able to alter 
thinking about misophonic sounds.    4  
  
6. Have you been avoiding doing anything, going any place, or being with anyone
