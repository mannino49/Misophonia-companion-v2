Peer Review VersionAbstract
Purpose: The study aimed to evaluate working memory (WM) abilities in normal hearing 
individuals with and without misophonia using simple and complex working memory tasks and to 
correlate WM abilities with the severity of misophonia.
Method: The data was collected employing a standard group comparison and a non-probability 
purposive sampling method. The current study comprised 40 participants aged 18-30 years, who 
were classified into two groups (with and without misophonia) based on the scores obtained in the 
Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ).  Simple tasks including forward and backward 
digit span and complex tasks including operation and reading span were used to assess WM 
abilities.
Results: WM abilities, measured using simple WM tasks, were comparable between the two 
groups. Although the operation span scores revealed no statistically significant difference among 
the complex tasks, there was a statistically significant difference in the reading span scores.
Conclusions:  The performance of individuals with misophonia remained similar to those without 
misophonia in simple WM tasks. However, their WM performance becomes poorer as tasks 
become more demanding.

Peer Review VersionIntroduction
Misophonia is a complex behavioral and neurophysiologic condition that is characterized 
by intense emotional responses and aversion to particular auditory stimuli, commonly referred to 
as "trigger sounds" (Edelstein et al., 2013). It was originally believed that the presence or 
expectancy of a particular sound made by a person would trigger the patient's aversive response 
(Arjan Schröder et al., 2013). However, it was later discovered that the triggering sounds could 
also be everyday sounds – both human-made and environmental - and the reaction to sounds was 
influenced by the environment and the individual’s characteristics (Siepsiak & Dragan, 2019). The 
heightened emotional response in misophonics after triggers is often linked to the activation of the 
autonomic and limbic systems (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2002).
This neurophysiological link is further supported by the co-occurrence of tinnitus and 
hyperacusis in individuals with misophonia, both of which exhibit similar patterns of activation in 
autonomic and limbic mechanisms. Studies underlining the anatomical and physiological 
correlates of misophonia show evidence of heightened neural activity in the visual cortex, temporal 
cortex, amygdala, and anterior insula in misophonia patients compared to controls (A. Schröder et 
al., 2015). Overactivation of the insula and unusual connectivity between cortical regions, 
including the medial parietal, medial frontal, and medial temporal cortex, with the insula has also 
been reported (S. Kumar et al., 2017). The brain mechanisms underlying the emotional reactivity 
and physiological arousal in individuals with misophonia were linked to aberrant myelination in 
the medial frontal cortex (Suárez et al., 2022). While the insula and amygdala are involved in the 
processing emotional stimuli, cognitive control, and regulating autonomic functions (Craig, 2009; 
Shackman et al., 2011), the temporal cortex is involved in auditory signal processing (Griffiths & 
Warren, 2004; Hickok & Poeppel, 2007). The involvement of the temporal cortex suggests that 
hyperactivity of the temporal area to particular sounds (triggers) causes aversion or negative 
emotions in misophonic, which may be linked to the unusual connectivity of the insula with the 
temporal cortex. Recent research also indicates that misophonic reactions are not solely driven by 
the auditory characteristics of sounds; other sensory inputs, including those from different 
modalities, significantly contribute to the aversive response (Samermit, Saal, & Davidenko, 2019; 
Samermit et al. 2022). It is also reported that responses to misophonic triggers are influenced by 
whether the listener accurately identifies the source of the sound. Trigger sounds that were Page 3 of 25

Peer Review Versioncorrectly identified elicited more negative reactions (Savard, Saresm Coffey & Deroche, 2022). 
Interestingly, the study found no significant difference in sound identification ability between 
individuals with high and low misophonia symptoms. This suggests that misophonia is not 
primarily driven by a bottom-up auditory mechanism but is more likely rooted in higher-level 
neural and cognitive processes (Savard et al. 2022).
While misophonia is primarily associated with emotional responses like anxiety, anger, or 
disgust, recent studies have suggested a potential impact on attention and cognitive underpinnings 
in misophonic reactions (Aryal & Prabhu, 2023; Palumbo et al., 2018). It is also observed that 
individuals with misophonia tend to focus more on details and exhibit cognitive inflexibility which 
can intensify their aversion to certain sounds, leading to a greater sensitivity associated with the 
condition (Simner et al., 2021).  The cognitive underpinnings of misophonia can be explained 
using the framework for understanding the effortful listening (FUEL) paradigm (Pichora-Fuller et 
al., 2016). Individuals with misophonia focus their attention excessively on the sounds that 
provoke their symptoms. They have trouble diverting away from these unpleasant sounds, which 
could make it difficult for them to focus on other auditory stimuli (Edelstein et al., 2013; Simner 
et al., 2021). It is possible to conceptualize that this attentional shift in individuals towards triggers 
in the environment might interfere with the availability of cognitive resources. Extending 
Kahneman's theory of the Capacity of Attention Model (Kahneman, 1973), Pichora-Fuller et al., 
(2016) postulated that when an input is perceived by the system, it triggers a demand for estimation 
of attention resources within the listeners' capacity. According to the estimated demand, necessary 
cognitive processes are assigned to the task execution. This process is known as resource allocation 
policy.
In individuals with misophonia, the mental state of alertness and looking out for triggers in 
the environment causes anxiety in them, which in turn limits the resources available for the 
cognitive task (Palumbo et al., 2018). Misophonia severity has been found to correlate positively 
with anxiety levels (Huviyetli & Çakmak, 2024; Quek et al., 2018), with anxiety mediating the 
impact of misophonia on quality of life (Huviyetli & Çakmak, 2024). The limited cognitive 
resources in turn increase listening effort (Rönnberg et al., 2014). Perceptual deficits in cognitive 
tasks vary based on the complexity of the task being performed. It can be postulated that cognitive 
demand imparted while performing simple working memory tasks may be compensated by Page 4 of 25

Peer Review Versionincreased listening effort (Lemke & Besser, 2016). However, as the tasks become more complex, 
individuals with misophonia do not have sufficient cognitive resources to overcome the task 
demand, thus resulting in poor cognitive performance. The role of cognitive processes in 
misophonia remains largely speculative and not extensively explored.  
Working memory (WM) is an aspect of short-term memory, involving the storage and 
processing of signals in a shorter time window lasting about 20s (Baddeley, 2003). In the present 
study, WM tasks were chosen to assess misophonia's role in cognitive performance because 
misophonia has been associated with heightened emotional responses to trigger sounds, which can 
disrupt cognitive processes like attention and focus. Attention and focus on the incoming signals 
are needed for target retrieval (e.g. forward and backward digit span) and performing tasks 
incumbent with memorizing target signal train (reading and operational span tasks). The 
complexity of the WM task is directly proportional to exerted listening effort (Harvey et al., 2017). 
The listening effort corresponding to the look out of sound triggers in environment, places 
misophonics at a disadvantage in processing WM tasks, especially when they are complex tasks. 
In other words, due to the presence of misophonia, the individual is in constant search of the 
triggering sounds. This exerts limitations on the cognitive resources needed for listening the 
incoming sounds, and thus affecting the WM. The FUEL model provides a theoretical framework 
for understanding how the competition for limited cognitive resources between the misophonic 
response and the WM task can lead to decrements in cognitive performance (Pichora-Fuller et al., 
2016). As WM impairments in misophonics can have a direct bearing on their daily functioning 
and performance in academic, occupational, and other settings, the authors have chosen to assess 
the impact of cognitive interference due to misophonia on simple (target retrieval - eg. Forward 
and backward digit span) and complex (reading and operational span tasks) WM tasks.
Considering the shared cortical resources between the trigger sounds search and memory 
task (such as WM), it can postulated that misophonics may show poorer performance in the tasks 
requiring cognition. By investigating these cognitive dimensions based on working memory in 
misophonic individuals, the study findings might contribute to identifying sensitive tests for 
cognitive assessment and the development of targeted interventions that can improve their quality 
of life. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate WM in simple and complex tasks in Page 5 of 25

Methods
Study design
Standard group comparison and non-probability purposive sampling were used to gather the data 
(Schiavetti & Metz, 2006). The participation in the study was entirely voluntary. Informed consent 
was obtained from all the participants before the evaluations. The institutional ethics and research 
board approved every procedure used in this investigation (Ref: SH/AUD/2022-
23/P01II21S0022). The guidelines for conducting human bio-behavioral research constituted by 
the institutional ethical committee (Venkatesan, 2009) were followed. These guidelines aligned 
with the Helsinki Declaration's standards (World Medical Association, 2004).
Participants
The study included 40 participants aged 18-30 years, divided into two groups of 20 each. 
Group 1 comprised 20 participants with misophonia (mean age: 22.3 ± 3.15 SD years; 20 females), 
and group 2 had 20 participants without misophonia (mean age: 21.8 ± 1.97 SD years, 20 females). 
To confirm the presence of misophonia and to indicate the severity, the Misophonia Assessment 
Questionnaire (MAQ) (Dibb et al., 2021) was administered to all the participants. The data 
collection was initiated pre-COVID before the psychometrically validated questionnaires were 
available. Hence, MAQ was used in the present study.  All participants had access to the 
questionnaire via Google Forms delivered by email or social networking sites including Instagram, 
Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp.  There were twenty-one questions on the questionnaire that 
evaluated how misophonia affected individual's social and emotional lives. The Misophonia 
Assessment Questionnaire is rated from 0 to 3 points depending on how frequently the issue 
applies (0 = not at all, 1 = occasionally, 2= frequently, and 3 =nearly always). Scores of 0-21 
indicate mild, 22–42 moderate, and 43-63 severe Using the total score, misophonia severity is 
determined. Out of the 221 respondents who answered the questionnaire, 20 were included in the Page 6 of 25

Peer Review Versionstudy based on their MAQ scores. According to a modified Kuppuswamy scale (Kumar et al., 
2022), all of the participants were in the upper-lower to upper-medium socioeconomic level. Group 
1 consisted of individuals with misophonia symptoms and a MAQ score between 1 and 64 (mean 
score: 21.9 ±10.42), while group 2 included participants without misophonia symptoms and an 
MAQ score of 0. 
 
INSERT TABLE 1
The other inclusion criteria included normal peripheral hearing sensitivity, normal middle ear and 
auditory nerve functioning as inferred from pure tone hearing thresholds, tympanometry, and 
reflexometry respectively. Hearing thresholds were obtained using a two-channel diagnostic 
calibrated audiometer Inventis Piano (Padova, Italy) with the TDH-39 headphone (Farmingdale, 
New York, USA) at octaves from 250 Hz to 4000 Hz (Clark, 1981).  All the participants had ‘A’ 
or ‘As’ type tympanogram with acoustic reflexes present (Ipsilateral and Contralateral) at 500 Hz 
and 1000Hz at normal sensation levels, confirmed using calibrated GSI Tympstar pro (Grason 
Stadler, Eden Prairie, MN, USA). Participants with co-occurring diseases such as tinnitus, 
vestibular migraine, hyperacusis, and/or hearing loss, who used hearing aids, who had received 
musical training, or who complained of otological impairments or neurologic problems were 
excluded from the study. Prior to each participant being included in the study, an informal 
interview was used to gather this information.
 
Assessment of working memory
Working memory was assessed using the Smriti-Shravan software (A. Kumar & Maruthy, 
2012). A laptop (Lenovo Ideapad 300-15ISK Core i5 6th Gen) with a Smriti-Shravan module 
installed and linked to Sennheiser HD206 headphones (Wedenmark, Germany) was used to 
provide the stimuli. Simple WM tests including forward and backward digit span and complex 
WM tests including operation span and reading span were administered to each participant. Page 7 of 25

Peer Review VersionForward and backward digit span: Digit sequences from 0 to 9, with the exception of 7 (which 
is bi-syllabic), were presented in auditory mode. Inter-stimulus interval of 1000 ms and a response 
time of 10,000 ms were used.  Participants were instructed to enter the numbers on the keyboard 
in the same sequence as they appeared for the forward digit span test and in the reverse order for 
the backward digit span test. The adaptive staircase technique (Levitt, 1971) was used to track the 
forward digit span. Based on the accuracy of the response, the software raised the level of difficulty 
of the next stimulus sequence. E.g., if the participant accurately entered 4 digits in the forward 
digit span task, the software raised the sequence in the next presentation to have 5 digits.  Before 
beginning with the actual test, 1 practice trial was given. The responses were statistically analyzed 
based on the maximum number of digits recalled.
The conventional Digit Span test uses live-voice tests in that it commences with trials that 
ascend in length until a stopping criterion is met. The maximum score of recall is termed a digit 
span. However, in the current study, an adaptive procedure is used.  This alteration helped the 
experimenters to immediately provide feedback to the participant, whenever wrong the software 
reduced the digit by one. Eg., if the participant was to recall 4 numbers in the digit span test, and 
only could do so for the first 3 numbers, the software recorded the response as incorrect. Instead 
of again presenting at the same level i.e. 4 digits, the next stimuli set was adjusted to 3 digits. This 
indirectly provided feedback that the participant failed to correct recall, which in turn urged for 
allocation of better recall. This procedure for evaluating digit span for assessing working memory 
in adults is proven to increase accuracy, and internal reliability, and helps in fast automated 
scoring, making the test highly suitable for clinical use (Dillon et al., 2024).
 
Operation span and reading span: The operation span task and reading span task which were 
used in Smrithi Shravan were adapted from the versions used by Kane et al. (2004). Both the tasks 
consist of 12 items and the number of elements per item varied from 2 to 5. The difficulty of the 
items was randomized such that the number of elements was unpredictable at the outset of an item.
Monosyllabic words and arithmetic equations were presented in series for operation span 
whereas; monosyllabic words and sentences were presented for reading span. Participants were 
instructed to solve the arithmetic problem for the operation span task or judge the 
semantic/pragmatic correctness of the sentence for the reading span task (secondary task) and Page 8 of 25

Peer Review Versionremember the words. The inter-stimulus interval of 1000 ms and response time of 15,000 ms was 
used. At the end of each trial, they were asked to choose all the target words in order.
In the operation span task, each element consisted of a mathematical operation and a word 
(e.g., IS [8*5] -25 = 21 ? and SNOW). The participant’s task was to read the math problem aloud, 
say yes or no to indicate whether the given answer was correct or incorrect, and then say the word. 
After all the elements in an item were presented the participant was required to write the words in 
the correct serial order. In the reading span task, each element consisted of a sentence, followed 
by a letter (e.g., Suresh was stopped by the policeman because he did not use a helmet ? and R). 
The participant’s task was to say the sentence aloud, respond yes or no to indicate whether the 
sentence made sense or not, and then say the letter. As with operation span, after all the elements 
in an item were presented, the participant was required to write the letters in the correct serial 
order.
The inclusion of the word element in the operation span task is likely to assess both working 
memory and parietal function, as the task requires holding the word in memory while also 
processing the arithmetic operation. This dual-task requirement, involving both working memory 
and parietal function for processing the mathematical operation, may have implications for 
assessing misophonia, as both cognitive control and sensory processing are relevant to this 
condition (Edelstein et al., 2013; S. Kumar et al., 2017). The word element in the operation span 
task taps into verbal working memory, which is impaired in individuals with misophonia 
(Madappally et al., 2024). Additionally, the parietal cortex, which is involved in the processing of 
mathematical operations, may also be implicated in misophonia as their attention to problem-
solving might be compromised. Thus, the operation span task with the word element may provide 
a useful tool for assessing both cognitive and parietal functioning in misophonia.
 
The scoring was adapted from the guidelines recommended by Conway et. al 
(2001).  Partial Credit Scores Weighted (PCSW) derived from proportion score was used to 
analyze the response. The proportion score was obtained by dividing the number of stimuli recalled 
correctly by the total number of stimuli in the element (e.g., if the participant correctly recalled 
two of four words, then the score for that item would be 0.25*2 = 0.5). The total proportion score Page 9 of 25

Statistical analyses
Data analysis was conducted using the Statistical Package Social Sciences (SPSS), version 
26.0. To ascertain if the data was normally distributed, the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality was 
employed. For each of the measurements (forward digit span, backward digit span, operation span, 
and reading span) for both groups, descriptive statistics (median with interquartile range- IQR) 
were performed. Given the limited sample size, a Mann-Whitney U test (Mann & Whitney, 1947) 
was used to compare the groups. The effect size was determined using the Rosenthal formula, re 
= /Z// √N, whenever there was a statistically significant difference between the groups (Robert & 
Rubin, 2003). Also, to assess the relationship between the severity of misophonia and WM abilities 
Spearman’s correlation analysis was carried out.
 
Results
The Shapiro-Wilk test of Normality was carried out on the scores of WM tests. Results 
revealed that data follows a normal distribution for forward digit span, backward digit span, and 
operation span (p > 0.05) and a non-normal distribution for reading span (p ˂ 0.05).
Descriptive statistics revealed that the scores of WM tests were comparable between 
individuals with and without misophonia, except for the reading span. Median reading span scores 
for group Ⅰ is 0.75 (± 0.11 IQR) and for group Ⅱ is 0.83 (± 0.06 IQR). Figure 1 shows the 
descriptive statistics (with median and IQR) between the two groups. The results of the Whitney 
test comparing the WM scores across the tasks showed that individuals with misophonia had 
significantly lower reading scores compared to those without misophonia. However, there was no 
significant difference (p > 0.05) in the performance between the two groups on all the other tasks 
considered in the study as shown in Table 2.

Spearman’s rank correlation was computed to assess the relationship between MAQ scores 
and WM scores. There was no correlation between MAQ scores and forward digit span, backward 
digit span, and operation span as shown in Figure 2. However, results revealed a negative 
correlation between MAQ scores and reading span scores, r (38)=-0.36, p=0.02.

Discussion
The purpose of the current study was to examine WM among individuals with misophonia. 
All participants underwent WM tests, and results from those with and without misophonia who 
had normal hearing were compared. For the forward and backward digit span tests, the maximum 
number of digits recalled was analyzed; for the operation and reading span tests, PCSW was 
analyzed.
When the digit span scores of all the simple WM tasks (forward, backward) were 
compared, there was no statistically significant difference obtained among the two groups (Table 
2). Based on the findings it is clear that when simple WM tasks like forward digit span and 
backward digit span tests are used to compare WM abilities in individuals with misophonia, these 
individuals would not differ from healthy normals. The level of mental load needed to complete 
each of the digit span tests varies, although they are all classified as simple WM tests. While 
backward digit span involves the transformation of the sensory input where mental reordering of 
the digits is done based on the tasks performed while maintaining the input in the short-term 
memory store, forward digit span does not involve any transformation and is only concerned with 
short-term memory storage (Hoosain, 1979).
The study conducted to evaluate WM in individuals with tinnitus exhibits these variations 
in digit spans (Nagaraj et al., 2019).  However, the current study failed to show such a trend. Also, 
when complex WM span tasks like reading span were administered, group differences were seen. Page 11 of 25

Peer Review VersionThe absence of statistically significant differences in simple digit span scores between individuals 
with misophonia and healthy controls in the current study is attributed to the participants exploiting 
the extended spare time available in simple span tasks for encoding information. The response 
time (RT) in the forward and backward memory span in Smriti Shravan was 10,000 ms, whereas; 
it was 15,000 ms for the reading span and operation span task. Individuals need to process and 
recall only primary stimuli in digit span tests but need to process both primary and secondary 
stimuli while recalling only primary stimuli in operation span and reading span tasks. This absence 
of secondary stimuli with sufficient RT available for simple WM tasks could have helped in 
rehearsal, making the recall simpler in both groups. The presence of distractor stimuli interferes 
with both encoding and rehearsal of target stimuli (Körner et al., 2019).  Hence, it is crucial to 
prioritize experiments that specifically address this aspect. To shed further light on the WM 
abilities of individuals with misophonia, an expedited presentation approach, similar to the change-
detection paradigm (Rouder et al., 2011) may provide more valuable insights. However, it is 
essential to note that implementing such investigations would require a departure from the memory 
test used in the present study. Adopting a different memory test, such as the single-item-memory-
probe test along with reaction time measures (in contrast to serial reports like in forward and 
backward digit span), would be crucial to make a more meaningful comparison with the existing 
literature (Ricker & Cowan, 2014). In the current study, the participants with any co-morbid 
disorder like Tinnitus or Hyperacusis were excluded to rule out the influence of those confounding 
factors on Misophonia. If the comorbid disorders exist, they may cause interaction effects and 
might skew the data.
In contrast to simple digit-span tasks, complex WM tasks have processing and storage 
demands. Regarding complex WM tasks, the results of the study revealed that individuals with 
misophonia performed significantly poorer than the non-misophonic only on the reading span, but 
not on the operation span. This discrepancy suggests that the challenges faced by individuals with 
misophonia in complex WM tasks are task-specific and may be related to the cognitive processes 
involved in reading span. The poorer performance in the reading span task for individuals with 
misophonia could be attributed to the differences in the task-switching and resource-sharing 
mechanisms between the two tasks (Saito & Miyake, 2004). The reading span task requires not 
only the maintenance and manipulation of information but also the integration of semantic content. Page 12 of 25

Peer Review VersionIn contrast, the operation span task primarily involves the manipulation and storage of non-
semantic information (Conway et al., 1942).
Task switching becomes more demanding in the reading span task, as both the target 
(information to be remembered) and the distracting stimuli (secondary execution task) carry 
semantic information. This semantic overlap between target and distractors in the reading span 
task may exacerbate interference effects and impose an additional cognitive load on individuals 
with misophonia, contributing to their significantly poorer performance in this specific task. These 
findings underscore the importance of considering the nature of cognitive processes involved in 
different complex WM tasks when assessing the impact of misophonia.
When WM abilities were compared with MAQ scores, it was found that WM abilities 
correlate negatively with the severity of misophonia. This is evident for complex WM tasks as 
shown in figure 2. This could be due to emotional distress associated with misophonia. As the 
severity of misophonia increases emotional distress associated would also increase thus resulting 
in poorer WM abilities (Coifman et al., 2021). Building on this, various attention mediation 
therapy techniques for managing misophonia, as outlined by Mattson, D'Souza, Wojcik, Guzick, 
Goodman, and Storch (2023), warrant further exploration through larger, prospective studies to 
assess their effectiveness comprehensively.
The current study is limited by a small sample size of 20 participants in each group which 
would not be sufficient to generalize the findings. In addition, MAQ was used to identify the 
participants which may not be appropriate as it is not validated and meant for young adults (Cervin 
et al. 2023). Studies in the future should verify the results by using more standardized and validated 
questionnaires. Further studies on a larger population comparing working memory abilities using 
different levels of difficulty are required. Also, assessing and comparing WM abilities across the 
severity of misophonia is recommended.
Conclusion
In conclusion, individuals with misophonia demonstrated comparable performance to 
healthy controls in simple digit span tasks, indicating similar basic WM memory abilities. 
However, notable differences emerged in complex WM tasks, with misophonia participants Page 13 of 25

Peer Review Versionexhibiting significantly poorer performance in the reading span task. This task-specific impairment 
suggests that the challenges associated with misophonia extend beyond basic WM processes, 
emphasizing the importance of considering the intricacies of cognitive mechanisms in different 
tasks. Further exploration, incorporating expedited presentation methods and alternative memory 
tests, is essential to deepen our understanding of misophonia and its impacts on cognition.  An 
additional study involving a larger population is necessary in order to generalize the results.
