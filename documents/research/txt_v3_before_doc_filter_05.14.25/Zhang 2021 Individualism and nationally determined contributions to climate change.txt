better understanding of the enablers and barriers behind NDC formulation. However, existing quantitative anal-
yses on the drivers of NDCs from an anthropological perspective are elusive. This study proposes both a concep-tual framework and empirical analysis of how cultural values link with the pledged NDCs. The ﬁndings show that
individualism (IDV) is a signi ﬁcant and robust predictor for the mitigation levels of NDCs, after controlling for af-
ﬂuence level, renewable energy proportion, democracy and other socioeconomic factors. For every 10-point in-
crease in the IDV score (say from the score of Canada to Australia or from the score of Vietnam to Mexico), thecommitted per-capita emission in 2030 relative to 1990 levels decrease by 14% –22%. However, such a correlation
is absent when assessing the mitigation ambitions using various fair benchmarks. This study underscores the ne-
cessity of considering more cultural context and nuances in tackling common climate problems, and advocatesfor developing tailored climate communication strategies to enhance the NDCs.

1. Introduction
The Paris Agreement established a landmark framework that invites
countries to determine voluntary contributions to climate change based
on their own circumstances. Although climate actions have sped up
since the agreement, the collective efforts of Nationally DeterminedContributions (NDCs) are insuf ﬁcient to achieve the goal of keeping
global mean temperature increase well below 2 °C or 1.5 °C ( Rogelj
et al., 2016 ) by the end of the century. To bridge the emissions gap, it
is necessary to motivate countries to enhance their NDCs. Such efforts
are especially crucial in 2020 –2021 when the ﬁrst opportunity for
ratcheting up the ﬁght against climate change is approaching.
A critical step to strengthen ambitions is to identify factors that in ﬂu-
ence NDC formulation. It is well acknowledged that NDC formulation is
inﬂuenced by multiple factors, including development stages, consider-
ations of equity and responsibilities, mitigation capacity, domestic costsScience of the Total Environment 777 (2021) 146076

and bene ﬁts of mitigation, politicians' viewpoints and public percep-
tions, climate change vulnerabilities, and the possibilities of gaining in-
ternational supports ( Dash and Gim, 2019 ;Sælen et al., 2019 ). However,
few studies investigate the driving factors of NDC formulation from a
socio-cultural perspective.
There is an increasing awareness that culture plays a critical role in
climate change mitigation and adaptation ( Adger et al., 2012 ;Barnes
et al., 2013 ;Corner et al., 2014 ;Hălbac-Cotoar ă-Zam ﬁre ta l . ,2 0 1 9 ). Cul-
ture, which is de ﬁned as “the shared values, beliefs, and norms of a so-
ciety ”(Hofstede et al., 2010 ), guides behaviors and decisions by
providing a dominant logic. By such de ﬁnitions, culture mediates the
risk perceptions regarding climate change, and affects the decision mak-
ing and public acceptance of climate policies ( Crona et al., 2013 ;Zheng
et al., 2021 ). For instance, it is observed that hierarchical individualists –
individuals showing a strong belief in authority and self-reliance –are
less concerned with climate change risks than egalitarian communitar-
ians –one favoring egalitarian and communitarian values ( Kahan et al.,
2012 ). A case study from Northern Burkina Faso indicates that culture is
as i g n i ﬁcant barrier to some climate adaptation activities ( Nielsen and
Reenberg, 2010 ). In light of these existing theories and evidence, it is
conjectured that cultural values also play a role in national climate dis-
course, such as NDC formulation.
To investigate whether, and if so, how cultural values play a role in
NDC formulation, this study proposes both a conceptual framework
and empirical analysis. The conceptual framework connects cultural
values with the potential drivers of NDCs and the empirical analysis
bridges the cultural dimension model in socio-cultural sciences and
theﬁrst round of NDCs. We speci ﬁcally focus on the individualism-
collectivism culture, which is widely considered as a fundamental di-
mension of cultural variation across countries and individuals ( Oishi
and Kisling, 2009 ;Triandis, 2001 ). Individualism-collectivism culture
describes the relationships between the individual and the group
(Hofstede, 2001 ). Societies with more individualistic culture have a
loosely-knit social framework, in which societal members are autono-
mous individualists and less dependent on their groups. They are
prone to choose the universal norms independently rather than being
imposed to take the in-group ones. By contrast, in societies with more
collectivistic culture, societal members are more likely to take the
norms and duties prevalent in the group and put high values on the re-
lationships among in-group members. Both the conceptual frameworkand empirical evidence show that countries with more individualistic
culture pledge higher mitigation levels of NDCs. The correlation is ro-
bust when the af ﬂuence level, renewable energy proportion, democracy
and other socioeconomic variables are controlled. The ﬁ
ndings lay a
foundation for incorporating anthropological considerations in NDC en-
hancement and developing culturally tailored strategies to motivate
higher ambitions in climate change mitigation.
2. Literature review and conceptual framework2.1. Potential NDC drivers2.1.1. Economic factors
Costs and bene ﬁts of mitigation are main factors in ﬂuencing NDC
formulation. On the one hand, high level of abatement cost hinders
the ambitions of emission reduction ( Hof et al., 2017 ). For instance, al-
though there are substantial potentials of carbon emissions reduction
through exploiting the abundant renewable energy resources in
Kenya, the high cost of renewable energy installation (approximately
0.5% –2% of GDP in 2050) is a realistic challenge ( Dalla Longa and van
der Zwaan, 2017 ).Chunark et al. (2017) found that the economic cost
of renewable energy utilization can be as much as 3.1% of GDP loss in
stringent emission targets. In addition to the implementation cost, the
pledged countries also care about the macroeconomic in ﬂuence of mit-
igation, such as the impact on personal revenues and job opportunities
(Orlov and Aaheim, 2017 ;Vona, 2019 ).On the other hand, mitigation efforts also bring economic bene ﬁts
through avoiding loss from climate disasters or stimulating economic
growth alongside industrial chains. In countries that are vulnerable to
climate change, the bene ﬁts from avoiding loss will exceed the negative
economic impacts; hence it is understandable that they show more am-
bitions in NDCs ( Kim et al., 2020 ). Moreover, some mitigation strategies,
such as large-scale implementation of renewable energy or shift of eco-nomic structure to a service-oriented economy, can stimulate the devel-
opment of upstream industries and create more job opportunities,
bringing bene ﬁts that offset the implementation cost ( Bastidas and Mc
Isaac, 2019 ;Dai et al., 2016 ). For example, Mittal et al. (2016) and
Tran et al. (2017) found that increasing the penetration of renewable
energy can decrease the economic loss in China, India and Vietnam.
Climate mitigation can also bring environmental and social co-
beneﬁts for air pollution improvement and public health ( Dovie,
2019 ). According to Cai et al. (2018) , reducing particulate matter
(PM
2.5) pollution associated with China's electricity industry under
the pledged NDC target would decrease premature deaths by 20,000
by 2030, which offsets 18 –62% of the abatement cost. Another study
on the USA obtained similar ﬁndings that the co-bene ﬁts of its NDC
commitment will reduce emissions of SO 2and NO xby 25%, approxi-
mately avoiding 3500 premature deaths annually by 2020 ( Driscoll
et al., 2015 ). The ﬁndings that health co-bene ﬁts noticeably offset the
abatement cost will enhance the ambitions in NDC formulation.
2.1.2. Technical feasibility
Technical barriers can also explain the lack of ambition in the NDCs.
There are two principle strategies for climate change mitigation: renew-able energy development and energy ef ﬁciency improvement ( He,
2015 ). Moreover, some end-of-pipe technologies, such as carbon cap-
ture and storage (CCS), also help control the greenhouse gas (GHG)
emission level ( Miyagawa et al., 2011 ). The development level of
these technologies in the countries partially determines the potentials
of emission reduction in their NDC formulation ( Michalena et al., 2018 ).
2.1.3. International aid
Some countries' mitigation commitments are conditional on foreign
ﬁnancial support, technology transfers, and capability assistance. Chen
et al. (2018) synthesized 164 submitted Intended Nationally Deter-
mined Contributions and found that 77% of the documents mentioned
the need for ﬁnancial assistance and 70% of the documents addressed
the need for technology support. Pauw et al. (2019) pointed out that
63% of the emerging countries and 83% of the least developed countries
and small island developing states claim that the implementation of
their NDC largely depends on the capacity assistance they receive. The
conditionality of NDCs can in ﬂuence the mitigation ambitions of coun-
tries. Developing countries tend to be more ambitious when external
aid is available. Meanwhile, developed countries might take credit
from providing support for developing countries and therefore reducetheir own mitigation targets.
2.1.4. Responsibility and equality
The mitigation targets are supposed to be “fair, ”implying each coun-
try takes its responsibility for emission reduction. Within the United Na-
tions Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), countries
agreed on the principle of ‘Common but differentiated Responsibilities
and Respective Capabilities ”(CBDR-RC). CBDR-RC recognizes that cli-
mate change is a common concern of all countries and acknowledges
the different capabilities and differing responsibilities of individual
countries in combatting climate change. However, the concept of fair-
ness is controversial for decades ( Kartha et al., 2018 ;Pan et al., 2017 ;
Robiou du Pont et al., 2016 ). Some countries advocate that prior emis-
sions increase future emission entitlements (namely the principle of
grandfathering). Other arguments stress that a country's responsibility
for climate change should incorporate its historical emissions (i.e., the
principle of historical responsibility) or that every person has equalX. Zheng, K. Guo, H. Luo et al. Science of the Total Environment 777 (2021) 146076
2

carbon emission development right (i.e., the principle of egalitarianism)
(Robiou du Pont et al., 2016 ). Such divergence of the fairness principle
might be re ﬂected in the NDCs, although few countries justify the fair-
ness of their contributions in the documents ( Swingle, 2016 ).
2.1.5. Public perceptions and stakeholders' engagement
The consciousness regarding climate change of policymakers, stake-
holders, and the public can in ﬂuence the decision making progress of
NDCs. Day et al. (2015) found that 86% of countries invited stakeholders
to participate in the preparation of the INDC. Stakeholders, including
scientists and representatives from the government, environmental
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private sectors, are sup-
posed to be knowledgeable in speci ﬁcﬁelds and able to suggest feasible
mitigation actions or to contribute data ( Dash and Gim, 2019 ).
Meanwhile, public awareness and risk perception of climate change
also have effects on governments' decision on emission reduction tar-
gets. Drummond et al. (2018) found a positive association between
the proportion of people who are aware of climate change and the un-
conditional mitigation targets. When people believe climate change
will threaten their lives, income, and welfare, they are more likely to
support ambitious mitigation strategies and actions ( Alvi et al., 2020 ).
Moreover, personal knowledge ( Shi et al., 2016 ) and experience, espe-
cially those of direct exposure to climate-related disasters ( Rudman
et al., 2013 ) and physical evidence of climate change ( Arctic Climate
Impact Assessment, 2004 ), may alter opinions and attitudes towards cli-
mate change. For instance, the perception of local temperature change is
one of the strongest predictors for risk perception of climate change
(Lee et al., 2015 ).
2.1.6. International pressure and country image
Pressures from the international community and concerns for coun-
try image constitute another factor in ﬂuencing NDC formulation. Pre-
serving a favorable country image in the eyes of the international
community is important for foreign policy goals, which involve
safeguarding national sovereignty and elevating international stature
(Harris, 2004 ). The achievement of these goals determines the cost-
beneﬁt analysis of international climate change cooperation and mitiga-
tion efforts.
2.1.7. Political factors
NDC formulation is a political process by nature. The political institu-
tions and pre-existing legislation will affect the mitigation ambitions
signiﬁcantly by in ﬂuencing the agenda setting, policy coordination
and political support ( Röser et al., 2019 ). In particular, political partisan-
ship and ideology are essential predictors of political support for climate
change. For example, in the United States, there is a long-lasting political
divide on the perceptions of climate change between the Liberals and
Democrats and Conservatives and Republicans. A similar left-right ideo-
logical divide is also found in the public of the European Union (EU) and
Australia: left-wing politicians and the general public on the left (pro-
gressive parties) reported stronger belief and concerns about climate
change than ﬁght-wing ones (conservative parties) ( Fielding et al.,
2012 ;McCright et al., 2016 ). Politicians do not respond to climate
change in a straightforward way. They shape and construct arguments
that are aligned with their outlooks and political ideals, as well asthose of their supporters, to increase the possibility of being re-elected
(Willis, 2017 ).
2.2. Hypothesis and conceptual framework
The main tenets of how individualistic culture in ﬂuences NDC for-
mulation are as follows. First, individualistic culture can in ﬂuence NDC
formulation through public perceptions, which are critical components
of the socio-political context within which policy makers operate. Public
perceptions can fundamentally compel or constrain political action to
address climate change ( Leiserowitz, 2005 ). People with moreindividualistic culture don't necessarily comply with the norms of the
collective, but choose the impartial and universal ones independently
(Beugelsdijk and Welzel, 2018 ). As such, people who think alike are
more likely to get together and ﬁght for climate change mitigation. A
typical example to support this argument is that kids in Canada, a typical
individualistic country, get together and sue the government over cli-
mate change ( Tollefson, 2019 ). In these cases, governments are
pressured and motivated to take active actions to develop and imple-
ment positive climate policies. By contrast, societies with more collec-
tivist culture address obligations and subordinating to the collective ’s
interest. It is hypothesized that such societies show greater acceptance
of low mitigation ambitions, if they are the governments ’decisions.
Moreover, although the NDC formulation is a political decision, pol-
iticians seldom generate mitigation targets by themselves. They rely on
stakeholders' suggestions and contributions to make decisions. In col-
lectivist countries, scientists are more likely to consider policymakers'
preferences and national interests, and therefore tend to propose low-
ambition targets. By contrast, scientists in individualistic countries
would probably assert suggestions in line with the universal norms
which emphasize more on climate change mitigation. Thus, we conjec-
ture that the mitigation level and ambition of a country's NDC is posi-
tively related to its level of individualism.
Apart from the two in ﬂuencing mechanisms mentioned above, other
socio-political factors can also lead to the observation of the positive
correlations between individualistic culture and the pledged NDCs
(Fig. 1 ). For example, countries with more individualistic culture usually
have higher levels of af ﬂuence ( Gorodnichenko and Roland, 2011 ). Ac-
cording to the principles of “Common but Differentiated Responsibili-
ties”within the UNFCCC, developed countries are supposed to pledge
higher emission cuts. Thus, the correlation between individualism and
afﬂuence levels and the correlation between af ﬂuence and emission re-
duction can lead to an observation of the correlation between individu-
alism and emission cuts. Besides, it is found that individualism is
associated with greater levels of clean technology adoption ( Ang et al.,
2020 ). This linkage can also lead to an observation of the positive corre-
lation between individualism and emission reduction, as more clean
technology adoption associates with more ambitions on emission re-
duction. Moreover, the relations between individualistic culture and
NDC formulation can also act through national political institutions,
given the positive relation between individualism and democracy(Davis and Abdurazokzoda, 2016 ). Although these in ﬂuencing channels
support our hypothesis that the mitigation level of a country's NDC is
positively related to its level of individualism, they are not the direct ef-
fect of individualistic culture on NDC formulation. Thus, we rule out the
effects of these in ﬂuencing channels through controlling for more socio-
economic variables and employing instrumental variable analysis.
3. Methods and data
3.1. Variables and data3.1.1. Independent variables
To empirically examine the potential links between individualism
and NDC formulation, we perform the regression analysis using the var-
iables indicated in Fig. 2 .S p e c i ﬁcally, to what extent a society has indi-
vidualistic culture is measured by a set of scores obtained from the
aggregation of value surveys on individual societal members. This ap-
proach of measurement is in line with one speci ﬁc tradition of cultural
analysis –the societal cultural value dimension (SCVD) scholarship –
that reduces cultural characteristics to several dimensions and assumes
the university of cultural dimensions ( Peterson and Barreto, 2018 ). In
the SCVD approach, a wide range of survey questions were used to col-
lect personal cultural values, and factor analysis was applied to summa-
rize the data and characterize the cultural characteristics of the society.
In most cases, the societies are predetermined according to geo-political
boundaries, e.g., by countries, and the culture of a country is named asX. Zheng, K. Guo, H. Luo et al. Science of the Total Environment 777 (2021) 146076

national culture ( Beugelsdijk and Welzel, 2018 ;Gelfand et al., 2011 ;
Hofstede et al., 2010 ;House et al., 2004 ;Schwartz, 2004 ). Although
countries are not governed by monolithic values and the value hetero-
geneity within countries is even larger than that between countries
(Fischer and Schwartz, 2011 ), averaging the values of individuals still
provides a window into the prevailing culture in the society
(Schwartz, 2013 ).
The most widely used cultural dimension framework is developed
by Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede ( Hofstede et al., 2010 ).
Hofstede initially constructed four cultural dimensions –power dis-
tance, individualism versus collectivism, masculinity versus femininity,
and uncertainty avoidance –based on surveys of IBM employees across
30 countries in the 1970s. The framework has been updated by extend-
ing the survey samples to other professions and to more than 80 coun-
tries. Later he added another two dimensions –long term orientation
versus short term orientation and indulgence versus restraint –using
the data of the World Value Surveys (WVS). The scores on
Individualism –Collectivism were collected through a series of questions
on job orientations. Countries that score higher on this dimension have
more individualistic culture, which indicates that people in these coun-
tries are autonomous and less dependent on collective norms and
duties. The other end of the continuum is collectivistic culture, in
which people tend to behave in accordance with the expectation of so-
cial norms and be loyal to the cohesive group. We use Hofstede's mea-
surement of individualism and collectivism to capture the cultural
variations across countries on this dimension. Although the temporal
stability of Hofstede's framework has been criticized as outdated, it is
proved to be still representative of contemporary globalized societies,
as countries have moved along the same path, with persistent relative
changes between countries ( Beugelsdijk et al., 2015 ).
To eliminate the concerns for mismeasurement of cultural dimen-
sions, we also use the most recent framework developed by
Beugelsdijk and Welzel (2018) for robustness check. In contrast to
Hofstede's measurements ( Hofstede et al., 2010 ) based on surveys on
IBM employee forty years ago, Beugelsdijk and Welzel's cultural dimen-
sion framework ( Beugelsdijk and Welzel, 2018 )p r o v i d e su sw i t ha
more updated cultural framework based on the samples of the World
Value Surveys and European Values Studies (EVS), comprising over
Fig. 1. Conceptual framework linking individualism and NDC formulation.

495,011 individual surveys from 110 nations between 1981 and 2014.
Beugelsdijk and Welzel reframe Hofstede's six cultural dimensions to
three, including Collectivism –Individualism, Duty –Joy, and Distrust –
Trust. Survey questions on Collectivism –Individualism in this frame-
work consist of broader elements, including religious beliefs, attitudes
towards obedience, tradition, and responsibility, as well as their job
preference. Higher scores on this dimension also mean more individual-ism. Although the measurement of individualism in the two frame-
works are based on various samples and procedures, they have
signiﬁcant correlations, the coef ﬁcient of which is between 0.47 –0.84
(Beugelsdijk and Welzel, 2018 ).
3.1.2. Dependent variables
The dependent variable is the ﬁrst round of NDCs. The variations of
the submitted NDCs across countries can be assessed in various ways
(Höhne et al., 2017 ). One of the approaches is to compare the per-
capita GHG emissions pledged in the NDCs relative to a reference year.
This way of measurement enables a cross-national comparison of emis-
sion levels but fails to re ﬂect the ambitions since it is highly dependent
on the development stage of the country. According to the principle of
“Common but Differentiated Responsibilities ”within the UNFCCC, de-
veloped countries in most cases pledged higher level of mitigation com-pared to developing countries. Another way widely used to assess NDC
is to compare GHG emissions pledged in the NDCs with the “fair”effort-
sharing benchmarks that comply with a global “least-cost ”2° Co r1 . 5° C
pathway. This way of measurement is controversial since the fair bench-
marks are divergent under various equity principles and approaches.
Other approaches of the NDC assessment include comparing the NDCs
with the baseline emissions in “no policies ”baselines or “current poli-
cies ”scenario. These approaches have limitations as the information of
baseline scenarios provided in the NDC documents is elusive, which
hinders the cross-national comparison. In this study we chose the for-
mer two approaches to assess the cross-national variations in NDC
commitments.
The emission level of NDCs depends on which target years and refer-
ence years are selected. We use the per-capita GHG emissions (excl.
LULUCF) in 2020, 2025, and 2030 relative to 1990, 2000, 2005, and
2010, respectively. The per-capita emission in the target years and refer-
ence years are sourced from Meinshausen & Alexander's work
(Meinshausen and Alexander, 2017 ). Regarding the mitigation ambi-
tion of NDCs, the assessment is sensitive to what benchmarks of fair
share are selected. We reference to Robiou du Pont et al.'s work
(Robiou du Pont et al., 2016 ), which compared the submitted NDCs
with the fair shares under ﬁve equality approaches, i.e., Capacity
(CAP), Equal per capita (EPC), Greenhouse development rights (GDR),
Equal cumulative per capita (CPC), and Constant emissions ratio
(CER). Although Robiou du Pont et al.'s work has been criticized on
the ground of cascading biases against poorer countries ( Kartha et al.,
2018 ), it provides multiple choices for NDC comparison, which ﬁts the
purpose of our regression analysis.
3.1.3. Control variables
Many factors would potentially affect the observation of the rela-
tionship between the NDCs and cultural values. We control for them
to eliminate the bias of omitted variables. The Control variables can be
classi ﬁed into four categories. The ﬁrst category refers to a country's
economic factors, including af ﬂuence level (denoted by the log form of
per capita GDP), development stage (denoted by whether the country
is one of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) countries), and GDP growth rate between the reference year
and the NDC target year. The second category re ﬂects on a country's
technical change related to carbon emission. The variables of this cate-
gory include per capita energy use (in log form), proportion of renew-
able energy, and carbon emission per GDP (in log form). The third
group of variables is historical GHG emissions during 1850 –2010,
which describe the responsibility of the countries. The fourth group ofcontrol variables represents a country's other characteristics, including
its political regime, geographical position and party grouping within
the climate change negotiations. Speci ﬁcally, the political regime is de-
noted by the indicators of democracy (measured by the Polity 2 score
from the Polity IV dataset) ( Marshall, 2014 ) and governance (measured
by Worldwide Governance Indicators) ( Kaufmann et al., 2010 ). The ef-
fect of geographical position and negotiating blocks is captured by thedummy variables of region and the dummy variables of party groupings,
respectively.
3.1.4. Samples
The baseline test is based on a sample of 82 countries (for the full
name of the sample countries, please kindly refer to Table A1 in the Ap-
pendix). The decision of whether or not to include a country is anchored
by the data accessibility. Countries with both cultural trait scores and
submitted NDCs are selected for comparison. From the geographical
perspective, the sample includes 8 countries from Africa, 25 countries
from Asia, 33 countries from Europe, 12 countries from Latin America
and the Caribbean, 2 countries from the North America, and 2 countries
from the Oceania. From the perspective of the Party groupings within
the climate change negotiation, the sample includes 4 countries from
the BASIC Group (Brazil, South Africa, China and India), 4 countries
from the Environmental Integrity Group (EIG), 25 countries from the
European Union, 3 countries from the Least Developed Countries
(LDCs), 7 countries from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Coun-
tries (OPEC), 3 countries from the Small Island Developing States (SIDS),
10 countries from the Umbrella Group, and 26 countries from the Other
States.
3.2. Regression model
The basic empirical model for measuring the effect of cultural factors
on the NDCs is:
NDC
i¼θIND iþηControls iþaþei ð1Þ
where the dependent variable NDC idenotes the levels of ﬁrst NDCs
(percentage change relative to a reference year) or the ambition of ﬁrst
NDCs (percentage change relative to fair benchmarks) proposed by
each country i. The explanatory variable IND idenotes the cultural traits
of individualism and collectivism in a country i. We also control for
other socioeconomic factors which could affect the NDCs, denoted as
Controls i. The Control variables are as described in the Variables and
Data section. θandηare the respective elasticity coef ﬁcients of Culture i
and Controls i.ais the constant term and eiis the disturbance term
unique to each country.
3.3. Estimation methods
In the baseline estimation, we run a regression of the model given in
Eq.(1)using the method of between estimator (BE). BE performs a
cross-sectional regression on the average value of each country's time
series data. Compared to other estimators, BE performs better in provid-
ing consistent estimates of long-term correlations ( Stern, 2010 ), which
suits the circumstances here since cultural evolution is an extremely
slow process.
To mitigate the possible omitted variable bias, we further perform a
between estimator two-stage instrumental variable (IV) regression. The
IV analysis deals with potential endogeneity problems, including omit-
ted variable bias, mismeasurement and mutual in ﬂuences. Speci ﬁcally,
we use historical pathogen prevalence ( Fincher et al., 2008 )a sa nI V
for individualism. We choose this IV because it is a strong predictor of
individualism but does not necessarily relate to the commitment of cli-

Meanwhile, it is hard to think of the channels through which the NDC of
a country is affected by their historical pathogen prevalence. Thus, the
regional prevalence of pathogens can only in ﬂuence NDC formulation
through individualism-collectivism culture and the in ﬂuence of other
confounding factors can be ruled out.
4. Empirical ﬁndings
4.1. Individualism and the emission levels of NDCs
The empirical analysis links the Individualism scores of the sample
countries with their ﬁrst NDCs ( Fig. 3 ). Based on the BE test ( Table 1 ),
weﬁnd that at the con ﬁdential level of 99%, individualism (IDV) is a sig-
niﬁcant predictor of the relative emission levels pledged in the NDCs,
which are measured as the per-capita GHG emission in 2030 relative
to 1990 levels. The results are consistent with our hypothesis and robust
when controlling for other cultural characteristics, af ﬂuence levels, re-
newable energy proportions, democracy and other socioeconomic vari-
ables. More speci ﬁcally, countries with more individualistic culture
pledged higher levels of mitigation targets (i.e., lower levels of per-
capita GHG emissions relative to 1990) than countries with collectivistic
culture. Though the size of the coef ﬁcient seems relatively small, the
practical meaning is signi ﬁcant. The estimated coef ﬁcient on IDV
(−0.022~−0.014) indicates that for every 10-point increase in the
IDV score (say from the score of Canada to Australia or from the scoreof Vietnam to Mexico), the committed per-capita emission in 2030 rel-
ative to 1990 levels decrease by 14% –22%.
Similar signi ﬁcant correlations are con ﬁrmed when the NDCs are in-
dicated as per-capita GHG emission in the lower mitigation target rela-
tive to 2000, 2005, and 2010. However, the correlations are not robustly
signiﬁcant when higher mitigation targets relative to these reference
years are used as dependent variables. There are two possible explana-tions for this phenomenon. One explanation is that the correlation
doesn't exist and the observation of the signi ﬁcance is just regression
noise. Another explanation is that, compared to the year 1990, the
other three years (i.e., 2000, 2005, and 2010) are less widely referenced
when countries formulate their NDCs, leading to the effect of national
culture unveiled. Considering the solid theoretical basis and consistent
results obtained from the empirical analysis using both of the individu-
alism indicators (i.e., Hofstede's measurement and Beugelsdijk &
Welzel's measurement), we are leaning towards the second explana-
tion, rather than regression noise.
However, it might be the case that individualism correlates with
NDC mitigation levels through other channels than cultural in ﬂuence.
To address these concerns, we control for a set of variables and perform
an instrumental variable analysis to rule out the confounding in ﬂuence
of other factors (Table A2). First, the positive correlation between indi-
vidualism and mitigation levels of NDCs might be because individualis-
tic countries are more af ﬂuent, and af ﬂuent countries pledged higher
levels of mitigation. We rule out the effect of this in ﬂuencing channel
by showing that the correlation between individualism and NDC levels
Fig. 3. Individualism and the pledged NDCs. The color of the scatter points shows the af ﬂuence level of countries, indicated by the logarithmic form of Gross Domestic Product per capita (at
purchasing power parity).X. Zheng, K. Guo, H. Luo et al. Science of the Total Environment 777 (2021) 146076
6

are still robustly signi ﬁcant when we control for af ﬂuence level, devel-
opment stage, historical GHG emissions, and even if we instrument in-
dividualism with the regional prevalence of pathogens. Second, one
may argue that individualism positively associates with democracy
and countries showing higher levels of democracy set higher mitigation
levels of NDCs. We found that this explanation stands as the correlations
are indeed supported by our sample. However, the effect of individual-
ism on NDC levels holds when the indicators of democracy and gover-
nance are controlled and when the individualism is instrumented.
Likewise, other possible channels, such as the argument that individual-
ism correlates with more renewable energy adoption which allows for
higher mitigation levels, were ruled out as the results show that the ef-
fect of individualism on NDC mitigation levels (relative to 1990) is ro-
bust or even stronger with controlled variables or instrumental analysis.
4.2. Individualism and the mitigation ambition of NDCs
To evaluate the potential in ﬂuence of individualism on the mitiga-
tion ambition of NDCs, we use the percentage differences between the
NDCs and the “fair”shares of per capita emissions allowances under var-
ious equity principles as the dependent variables. Using the between es-timators ( Table 2 ), we didn't ﬁnd a robust correlation between
individualism and the ambitions in the submitted NDCs. Only when
CER and the average ﬁve approaches are referenced as benchmarks
are the ambitions of NDCs signi ﬁcantly associated with individualism.In other cases, the correlations are not signi ﬁcant. Through
instrumenting the cultural variable of individualism, we didn't ﬁnd sig-
niﬁcant or robust evidence to support the effect of culture on NDC am-
bitions either (Table A3).
It is worth noting that insigni ﬁcant coef ﬁcients don ’t necessarily in-
dicate the absence of correlations. One possible reason hindering the
observation of the correlation between individualistic culture and the
NDC ambitions is that the countries have not yet achieved a consensus
on the fair benchmarks, which the NDC assessment highly depends
on. Another interesting conjecture behind this ﬁnding is that most of
the countries take into consideration of the historical carbon emission
(especially that in 1990) in the process of NDC formulation while few
considered the fair shares which align with the Paris goals. That is
why we observe a signi ﬁcant correlation when the NDC is indicated as
the target relative to a reference year, but no signi ﬁcant evidence
when the NDC is indexed as the changes relative to fair benchmarks.
4.3. Discussion and policy implications
Despite the wide discussion on the factors that in ﬂuence climate
change mitigation ambitions, most researchers and politicians considerthe lack of ambitions as a technical and ﬁnancial problem ( Willis, 2017 ).
This study provides an exploratory analysis of why the NDCs are formu-
lated as they were from a cross-cultural perspective. It implies a new
pathway to enhance the ambitions of climate action from the culturalTable 1

perspective. Besides climate change, solutions to other global environ-
mental issues can also incorporate cultural considerations. Speci ﬁcally,
the study generates three policy implications.
First, it is necessary to incorporate national culture into the develop-
ment of climate change strategies. For example, how to develop effec-
tive strategies to downscale the NDCs within the country and
motivate sub-national mitigation actions is one of the critical questionsthat all country need to consider. Either a top-down emission allocation
scheme that aligns with the national mitigation target or bottom-up
mitigation commitments that adequately consider local realities can
be utilized to accelerate climate actions. The ﬁnding of individualistic
culture shows more advantages in bottom-up commitment and there-
fore implies that bottom-up downscaling strategy might be more suit-
able for such culture. Communities with such culture might prefer
independent choice over an imposed mitigation quota. They set their
own goals rather than ful ﬁlling the expectation of the collective. By con-
trast, in countries with collectivist culture, local governments at the sub-
national level may underestimate their contributions in the bottom-up
commitment to eliminate risks of failing to achieve the goals. However,
they have more motivation to enforce a top-down administrative quota
as they view it as collective duties.
Second, the paper underscores the need for a tailored NDC enhance-
ment approach that is in line with the country's cultural context. In spe-
ciﬁc, choice of target audience can be culturally dependent when
increasing climate mitigation efforts is being advocated. For countries
with collectivistic culture, it is critical to convince the political leaders
of the importance and urgency of tackling climate change. This is be-
cause, in such countries, political leaders' preference has a more signif-
icant in ﬂuence than scientists' or public perceived norms and values.
For countries with individualistic culture, improving climate literacy
and public understanding of anthropogenic causes of climate change
is as crucial as the awareness of policymakers.
Third, it is necessary to contextualize the content of the advocates. In
light of the ﬁndings in the present study, we suggest advocates in coun-
tries with a collectivistic culture should link the risks of climate change
and the merits of mitigation with the in-group interests, such as the
co-bene ﬁts of mitigation on local air pollution, human health and en-
hancing international reputation. If the public is informed that tackling
climate change can strengthen their collective interests, they are more
likely to oblige to the in-group mitigation target and thus take activeactions.
5. Conclusion
It is fascinating to study and try to understand culture's role in policy
decisions on climate change, especially when the second round of na-
tionally determined commission is approaching. This study reports the
theoretical and empirical analysis on the in ﬂuence of individualism-
collectivism culture on NDC formulation. It is found that individualism
is a signi ﬁcant and robust predictor of the mitigation level of the submit-
ted NDCs, although the countries have no intentions to consider it or not
even realize it. The correlations can be explained by two in ﬂuencing
channels. First, the public in countries with more individualistic culture
put more value on the impartial and universal norms over the collective
norms within a group. They are more likely to ﬁght for climate change
mitigation and exert more pressure on the governments' policy deci-
sion. Second, although the NDC formulation is a political process, policy
makers usually rely on stakeholders, who are supposed to be knowl-
edgeable and contribute proposals, to make decisions. Stakeholders in
individualistic societies are more independent while those in collectiv-
istic societies tend to consider policymakers' preferences and national
interests, which therefore understate the mitigation levels in NDCs.
The effects of culture on climate change actions are complicated, me-
diating or being mediated by multiple other factors. This study doesn't
intend to advocate or criticize any speci ﬁc culture, but hope to enhance
a better understanding of culture's role in climate policy decisions. Thisstudy contributes to the literature not only by responding to the advo-
cates on incorporating anthropological knowledge into tackling climate
commons but also by providing new insights on how to motivate NDC
enhancement by incorporating cultural engagement. Such contribution
is explorative and serves to lay the groundwork for further quantitative
empirical research bridging cultural values and climate change.
