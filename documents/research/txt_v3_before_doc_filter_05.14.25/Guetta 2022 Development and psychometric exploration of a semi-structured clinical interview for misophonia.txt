Clinical interview 
Sound sensitivity ABSTRACT  
Misophonia is a newly described disorder associated with significant emotional distress, functional impairment, 
and a wide range of mental health problems (e.g., mood, anxiety, and personality disorders). Although recent 
studies have begun to validate self-report measures of misophonia, no psychometrically validated interviews 
have been developed. To advance a scientific understanding of misophonia, rigorously developed semi- 
structured interviews are needed as a complementary measurement approach to self-report inventories. 
Accordingly, the aim of this study was to develop and begin preliminarily validating a semi-structured clinical 
interview for misophonia. We took an iterative, grassroots approach to item generation and interview devel -
opment involving key stakeholders (i.e., misophonia sufferers, experts in the field). Initial psychometric analyses 
from the current sample (n 30) evidenced excellent preliminary estimates for internal consistency, convergent, 
discriminant, and predictive validity. Results from this study provide preliminary support for the Duke Miso-
phonia Interview, and we recommend that this interviewer-rated measure be iteratively developed and refined 
using larger and more diverse samples.   
Misophonia is a disorder marked by decreased tolerance, as well as 
sensory and emotional over-responsivity to repetitive sounds (“trig-
gers”) and related stimuli (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 
2002, 2014 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ; Swedo et al., 2021 ; Wu et al., 2014 ). 
Triggers are typically human-produced, pattern-based oral and/or nasal 
noises (e.g., throat clearing, chewing, slurping, sniffing) or can be 
environmentally produced (e.g., pen clicking, keyboard typing, dog 
drinking), and are not attributable to aversive acoustic features such as 
volume or pitch (Brout et al., 2018 ; Swedo et al., 2021 ; Taylor, 2017 ). 
Although auditory triggers are most common in misophonia, individuals 
may also report distress in response to visual triggers (e.g., leg shaking, 
foot tapping, fan spinning; Swedo et al., 2021 ), as well as visual re-
minders of auditory triggers (e.g., watching someone open the 
refrigerator). 
The intensity of emotional reactions to triggers is expressed across a 
range of affective responses (e.g., anger, anxiety, disgust, rage) and 
physiological reactivity (e.g., muscle tension, increased heart rate, 
heightened galvanic skin response; Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Jastreboff & 
Jastreboff, 2001 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ). Individuals responding to 
misophonic triggers report difficulty disengaging their attention from the sounds, as well as aversive and negative thoughts (e.g., “I hate this 
person ” or “I can't stand it”), sometimes accompanied by urges toward 
aggression (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001 ; Swedo et al., 2021 ). Common 
behavioral responses include glaring at or mimicking the person pro-
ducing the sound, verbal agitation or aggression, and infrequent phys-
ical aggression, all of which adversely impact interpersonal functioning 
(Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001 ). In additional to interpersonal aggression 
and conflict, escape and avoidance behavior functions to prevent 
exposure to and distress from misophonic cues. 
Intolerance of possible triggering contexts (e.g., family meals and 
restaurants, certain workplaces) may lead to diminished confidence and 
ability to regulate emotions over time (Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ; Wu 
et al., 2014 ). For example, among participants recruited from online 
support groups with misophonia, 78% reported spending over an hour 
each day thinking about misophonic sounds and reported moderate to 
extreme interference in social and/or academic and work life (e.g., 
strained relationships, social isolation, inability to perform important 
work tasks, to keep jobs; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ; Swedo et al., 2021 ). 
The level of impairment and distress associated with misophonia makes 
clear the importance of both developing and utilizing evidence-based

4assessments that characterize misophonia and treatments that alleviate 
relevant symptoms. 
As the term “misophonia ” was coined in the early 2000s (Jastreboff 
& Jastreboff, 2001 ), many questions remain regarding onset, etiology, 
course, biological, genetic, and behavioral mechanisms, phenotypic and 
syndromal boundaries with other psychiatric and medical conditions 
(Taylor, 2017 ). Central to answering these outstanding questions is the 
development and validation of empirically derived assessments that 
adequately capture the heterogeneity of misophonic symptom 
presentations. 
1.Utility of a clinical interview 
Recent studies have begun to validate self-report inventories 
assessing symptoms and features of misophonia. For example, the 
Misophonia Questionnaire (Wu et al., 2014 ), Amsterdam Misophonia 
Scale (Naylor et al., 2020 ), Misophonia Response Scale (Dibb, Golding, 
& Dozier, 2021 ), MisoQuest (Siepsiak et al., 2020 ), and Duke Miso-
phonia Questionnaire (DMQ; Rosenthal et al., 2021 ) each have shown 
preliminary psychometric validation, and, collectively, provide prom -
ising new tools to help clinicians and researchers characterize miso-
phonia. Despite the value of self-report assessment measures (e.g., brief, 
accessible, convenient), however, there are inherent problems with 
relying solely on these measurement approaches. 
The focus of most self-report measures has been on types of triggers 
(e.g., oral, nasal, environmental, etc.), symptoms (e.g., physiological, 
emotional, and behavioral responses), and subjective appraisals of 
functional impairment (e.g., social, occupational, acadmic). Although 
such narrow focus is sensible in the context of brief measurement, little 
attention has been given to a more holistic understanding of the scope of 
affective, cognitive, behavioral, and physiological processes that occur 
in response to triggers, or to how misophonia affects one's self-concept. 
It is important to move beyond subjective assessment of triggers, 
symptoms, and impairment in order to obtain a more comprehensive 
understanding of an individual's experience of misophonia. In doing so, 
assessment can improve treatment by informing how to flexibly apply 
interventions capable of targeting of idiographic problems using nom-
othetically derived and empirically supported processes of change (e.g., 
cognitively, behaviorally, or physiologically-focused interventions). 
Existing instruments also have weaknesses common among self- 
report measures, including response biases (e.g., acquiescence or nay-
saying biases), variable and nonspecific interpretations of questions, and 
reductive responses, all of which can be partially overcome using semi- 
structured clinical interviews (e.g., Widiger & Saylor, 1998 ). For 
example, when administering a semi-structured interview, responses 
can be followed with probes and prompts in order to enhance the pre-
cision and accuracy of responses. Integrating follow-up questions in 
clinical interviews allows the interviewer to (a) clarify contextual details 
underlying questions/responses, (b) address ambiguous responses or 
participant uncertainty, (c) confirm the frequency, intensity, and dura-
tion of individual symptoms, and (d) situate symptom severity within 
the context of both the individual (idiographically) and what is empir -
ically and clinically considered subthreshold versus threshold (nom -
othetically). Collectively, the advantages of using semi-structured 
interviews offer greater precision, scope, and treatment utiity than brief 
self-report inventories in the measurement of misophonia. 
2.Current study 
The primary aim of the present study was to develop and conduct 
exploratory psychometric analyses of a new semi-structured clinical 
interview to assess misophonia in adults. The a priori goals were to 
create and evaluate items representing an individual's: (a) current fre-
quency of being affected by misophonic triggers, (b) degree of 
responding to triggers across affective, physiological, cognitive and 
behavioral domains of functioning, (c) social and occupational impairment caused by misophonia over one's lifetime, as well as (d) 
impact of misophonia on beliefs about the self. These items were 
generated rigorously using qualitative and quantitative approaches in 
the initial validation of the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ; for 
details, see Rosenthal et al., 2021 ). The present interview was developed 
to complement the DMQ and other self-report measures of misophonia, 
with the intention of being administered in both research and clinical 
settings to comprehensively characterize the heterogenous nature of 
misophonia. 
The development of the clinical interview was scaffolded by assess -
ment standards for creating new interview measures (Watson, 1990 ; 
Watson et al., 1991 ), including: (a) correspondence with proposed 
diagnostic criteria in order to promote generalizability and external 
validity; (b) inclusion of both dichotomous and continuous ratings to 
provide critical information about presence or absence of the condition 
in addition to dimensional characterization of severity; (c) ability to be 
trainable among paraprofessionals in order to contribute a scalable and 
broadly useful instrument; and (d) adequate reliability and validity. We 
also referenced several widely used and psychometrically validated 
clinical interviews, including the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for 
DSM-5 (CAPS-5; Weathers et al., 2018 ) and the Anxiety Disorders 
Interview Schedule for DSM-5 (ADIS-5; Brown & Barlow, 2014 ), and 
incorporated principles articulated by the creators of these instruments. 
Firstly, we aimed to craft clear and concise questions. Secondly, we 
incorporated behavioral anchors derived from clinical experience with 
misophonia sufferers in the community and pilot data into the rating 
system in order to improve reliability and reduce rater bias (Blake et al., 
1995 ). We also created dimensional ratings for symptoms that integrate 
both frequency and intensity in order to capture a more individualized 
symptom presentation and provide clinically useful information to re-
searchers and clinicians alike. Such granular analysis of symptom 
severity affords an idiographic and flexible account of misophonia. For 
example, one individual may experience relatively frequent but mildly 
distressing misophonia symptoms, whereas another may experience less 
frequent symptoms but markedly more distress. This division of fre-
quency and distress into a dimensional severity score may bolster the 
treatment utility of the assessment (Hayes et al., 1987 ; Weathers et al., 
2018 ). Lastly, we incorporated interview questions that assess both 
current symptomatology and global impact and we were careful to use 
clear wording to distinguish between time frames. 
3.Methods 
All study procedures were approved by an IRB and all participants 
provided informed consent before beginning study procedures. Devel -
oped at Duke University's Center for Misophonia and Emotion Regula -
tion, the Duke Misophonia Interview (DMI) was developed in two phases 
and was designed to overcome the limitations of existing measures of 
misophonia. In Phase 1, the interview items were generated using a 
literature review, responses to an initial version of the interview from 
both misophonia experts and a pilot sample of 10 misophonia sufferers, 
and iterative feedback from professionals. Phase 2 involved exploratory 
psychometric assessment among a larger sample of misophonia sufferers 
(n 30). A summary of the methodology used to develop the DMI is 
depicted in Fig. 1a-c. Details of each element in this flowchart are 
described below. 
3.1. Phase 1a: development of interview 
3.1.1. Literature review to identify candidate items 
To identify candidate items for the interview, a comprehensive 
literature search for existing proposed diagnostic criteria and tools to 
assess misophonia was conducted. Proposed diagnostic criteria identi -
fied were from Schroder et al. (2013) and Dozier et al. (2017) . None of 
these proposed criteria have been empirically tested, and as such, none 
of the offered criteria have been widely accepted. Items from the R.E. Guetta et al.

5Schroder et al. group reflected in the interview include assessing the 
presence or absence of sensitivity to sounds, affective sensitivity, 
avoidance, distress and impairment (2013). Items from the Dozier et al. 
group integrated into the interview included assessing the source of the 
misophonic triggers, physiological and affective responses to triggers 
during and after the misophonic response, and interference in work, 
school, and interpersonal functioning. Measures identified included the 
Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014 ), Amsterdam Miso-
phonia Scale (A-MISO-S; Schroder et al., 2013 ), Misophonia Assessment 
Questionnaire (MAQ; Johnson, 2014 ), Misophonia Activation Scale 
(MAS-1; Fitzmaurice, 2010 ), Misophonia Physiological Response Scale 
(MPRS; Bauman, 2015 ), Misophonia Coping Responses Scale (MCR; 
Johnson, 2014 ), and Misophonia Emotional Responses Scale (MER; 
Dozier, 2015 ). All items across these measures were reviewed and 
constructs (e.g., emotional, behavioral, physiological) were consoli -
dated into semi-structured interview questions. These steps resulted in 
an initial pool of 26 candidate interview items. 
3.1.2. Creation of individual interview 
Next, a semi-structured interview was developed to ensure that the 
included items would comprehensively capture the current experience 
of individuals with misophonia. Features of the interview included (a) 
dichotomous (present/absent) responses for each individual symptom in 
the past month, (b) separate ratings for symptom frequency and in-
tensity, culminating in a dimensional rating, (c) prompts, follow-up 
probes, and behavioral anchors for each dimensional rating scale in 
order to increase reliability (Blake et al., 1995 ), (d) functional impair -
ment ratings for each past-month symptom, and (e) several questions 
assessing global (lifetime) impact of misophonia on the individual. See 
Fig. 2a-b for examples of interview items. 
The first question established presence or absence of trigger sounds, 
as well as frequency and distress of the sounds. The next series of 
questions assessed cognitive, emotional, physiological, and behavioral misophonic responses. The last several questions assessed impact of 
misophonia on relationships, school, work, and important hobbies, be-
liefs about the self, and overall quality of life across the individual's 
lifetime. 
3.1.3. Scoring of the DMI 
3.1.3.1. Dichotomous ratings for current symptoms. Prompts for each 
item began with a description of the symptom to assess presence or 
absence, and if the respondent endorsed the symptom, all follow-up 
prompts in the item were administered. If the respondent did not 
endorse presence of the given symptom, the interviewer moved on to the 
next symptom and the item was scored as a 0. 
3.1.3.2. Dimensional severity ratings for current symptoms. Each past- 
month symptom included both frequency and distress ratings, which 
got converted into a single, dimensional severity rating (Weathers et al., 
2018 ). First, symptom frequency was recorded directly as reported by 
the individual, and distress was captured using a subjective unit of 
distress (SUDS) rating from 1 to 10. Respondents were asked to generate 
personally-relevant behavioral anchors, with 1 being the level of distress 
during a moment or event that represented the calmest the individual 
had been in their life and 10 being the level of distress during a moment 
or event that represented the height of distress in their life. This allowed 
the respondent to situate the distress from each misophonia symptom 
within the context of their life stressors more broadly. Distress was rated 
as “minimal ” (SUDS rating 1–3), “clearly present ” (SUDS rating 4–5), 
“pronounced ” (SUDS rating 6–8), or “extreme ” (SUDS rating 9–10). 
Next, derived from psychometrically validated, clinician-rated 
scoring rules (Weathers et al., 1999 ; Weathers et al., 2018 ), frequency 
and distress ratings were converted into a 5-point severity rating (0 
absent , 1 mild, 2 moderate , 3 severe , 4 extreme ). Behavioral Table 1

6anchors were provided next to each severity rating option for the 
interviewer to refer to. For example, a moderate severity rating for most 
items required symptom frequency to be at least once a day over the past 
month and for distress to be clearly present. 
3.1.3.3. Continuous ratings for current impairment. After collecting fre-
quency and distress ratings for each past-month symptom, the inter-
viewer followed prompts to ask about the extent to which that symptom 
had impacted their relationships with others, their ability to work or 
quality of work, as well as any other adverse impact on their day-to-day 
life that month. Impairment was rated by the interviewer on a 3-point 
Likert scale (0 no functional impairment to to 2 functional impairment ), based on the rating system derived in the Structured Clin-
ical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5; First, 2014 ). Impairment ratings 
incorporated information such as behavioral observations of the 
respondent, information gained earlier within that item and throughout 
interview, and judgment based on respondent reporting style. 
3.1.3.4. Continuous ratings for global impact. After the assessment of 
past-month symptoms, the interview included several items about the 
overall impact of misophonia on relationships, school and occupation, 
self-concept and image, and subjective distress over one's lifetime. Each 
of these items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (absent) to 4 
(extreme). Global impact ratings incorporated factors such as degree of 
subjective distress, behavioral observations and information gained 
throughout interview, and judgment regarding reporting style. 
3.1.3.5. Outcome scores. The interview yielded four scores: (a) total 
DMI score (a sum of all dimensional severity ratings for each past-month 
symptom and continuous ratings for each global impact item), (b) cur-
rent severity score (a sum of all dimensional severity ratings for each 
past-month symptom), (c) current impairment score (a sum of all 
continuous impairment ratings), and (d) global impact score (a sum of 
all continuous lifetime effect ratings). A summary of the division of 
items and DMI outcome scores is depicted in Table 1. 
3.1.3.6. Pilot study. Participants were individuals with misophonia (n 
10) and were included if they were between the ages of 18 and 65, did 
not meet criteria for current mania, anorexia nervosa, or psychosis as 
determined by formal diagnostic interviewing via the Structured Clin-
ical Interview for the DSM- 5 (SCID-5; First, 2014 ), and scored a mean 
item score of 2 or greater on the Misophonia Symptom Scale and 
Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors Scale and a score of 7 or higher on 
the Severity Scale of the Misophonia Questionnaire (Wu et al., 2014 ). 
3.2. Phase 1b: refinement of initial item pool 
3.2.1. Feedback on item wording, structure, and applicability from 
misophonia sufferers 
In addition to responding to the interview items themselves, the 
same participants as in Phase 1a (n 10) provided free response feed-
back on each item and offered changes or additions to the interview, 
including length, content, scoring criteria, wording of instructions, and 
comprehensibility of items. Participant feedback was discussed by the 
study team, and changes were incorporated to enhance accessibility 
and/or clarity of the instructions. Items flagged as confusing or redun -
dant were either removed or condensed. 
3.2.2. Feedback from experts 
The iterated interview was sent to several clinicians and professional 
experts. Expert feedback was reviewed and incorporated by the study 
team. Changes included clarifying instructions and including additional 
relevant items (e.g., functional impairment items for each misophonic 
symptom). 
3.2.3. Study team qualitative review 
As the final step in Phase 1, members of the study team reviewed the 
iterated interview and made additional refinements to increase clarity 
and specificity of the interview items. This included further collapsing 
and/or parsing questions and further simplification of instructions and 
response options. After completion of all Phase 1b modifications, 19 
items were prepared for Phase 2 data collection and initial psychometric 
analyses. 
3.3. Phase 2: scale refinement using preliminary psychometric analyses

7assess feasibility and acceptability of the measure and to begin explor -
atory psychometric analysis of the interview. 
3.3.1. Participants 
Phase 2 sample (n 30) was recruited via the same methods as Phase 
1. Sample size for this exploratory psychometric study was based in the 
law of central tendency, which posits that a sample size of 30 provides 
parameter estimates with small to medium effect sizes (Krithikadatta, 
2014 ). Thirty percent of the current sample (n 9) was randomized to a 
follow-up visit in order to compute a preliminary estimate of test-retest 
reliability and predictive validity of the DMI. 
3.3.2. Measures 
3.3.2.1. Misophonia questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014 ).The MQ is a 
brief, 17-item self-report scale divided into three subscales: the Miso-
phonia Symptom Subscale, the Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors 
Subscale, and the Impairment Subscale. A cut score of 7 (“Moderate ”) or 
higher on the Impairment Subscale indicates clinically significant 
misophonia symptomology. Initial validation of the MQ demonstrated 
good internal consistency (α 0.86 –0.89; Wu et al., 2014 ). Reliability 
for the MQ total score in the current sample was acceptable (α 0.72; 
95% CI [0.55, 0.85]). 
3.3.2.2. Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S; Schroder et al., 
2013 ).The A-MISO-S is a 6-item semi-structured interview that assesses 
the following: (1) amount of time occupied by misophonia symptoms; 
(2) interference in social functioning from misophonia; (3) level of 
general distress (irritation, anger, disgust) the misophonia symptoms 
cause the individual; (4) level of effort for the individual to resist or 
divert attention from misophonia impulses (i.e. sound-related thoughts); 
(5) how much control the individual feels they have over their 
misophonia-related thoughts; and (6) how much an individual avoids 
misophonia situations. In the current study, this measure was adminis -
tered as a self-report questionnaire rather than an interview. Scores from 
0 to 4 are considered subclinical misophonic symptoms, 5–9 mild, 10–14 
moderate, 15–19 severe, and 20–24 extreme. A good internal consis -
tency of 0.81 was reported (Naylor et al., 2020 ). Reliability of the A- 
MISO-S total score in the current sample was adequate (α 0.68; 95% CI [0.46, 0.83]). 
3.3.2.3. Brief symptom inventory (BSI-18; Derogatis, 2001 ).The BSI-18 
is an abridged version of the 53-item BSI developed to identify self- 
reported clinically relevant psychological symptoms. The BSI-18 is a 
checklist developed as a screen for symptoms ranging from depression, 
panic, to anxiety. Each symptom is rated on a five-point Likert scale with 
responses ranging from 0 (“Not at all”) to 4 (“Extremely ”), with total 
scores ranging from 0 to 72. Higher total scores indicate higher global 
psychological distress. Initial validation of the BSI-18 total score 
demonstrated good internal consistency (α 0.89; Zabora et al., 2001 ). 
Reliability for the BSI-18 total score in the current sample was excellent 
(α 0.91; 95% CI [0.86, 0.95]). 
3.3.2.4. Centrality of Religiosity Scale (CRS; Huber & Huber, 2012 ).The 
CRS is a 15-item self-report scale assessing the significance of spirituality 
in individuals' lives, and was included to assess for discriminant validity. 
The measure was designed to measure five dimensions of religiosity: (1) 
Intellect, (2) Ideology, (3) Public practice, (4) Private practice, and (5) 
Experience. The CRS demonstrated good internal consistency (α 0.73 
to 0.83; Abbasi-Asl et al., 2019 ). Reliability for the CRS in the current 
sample was good (α 0.83; 95% CI [0.73, 0.91]). 
3.3.2.5. Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MCSD; Reynolds, 
1982 ).This 13-item tool utilizing a true-false response format that 
assess the impact of social desirability, the tendency to report answers in 
a way that individuals deem to be socially acceptable. The MCSD was 
included to assess for discriminant validity. Total scores range from 0 to 
13, with higher scores indicating a social desirability response tendency. 
The MCSD was validated in a large college sample and evidenced 
acceptable reliability α 0.76; Reynolds, 1982 ). Reliability for the 
MCSD in the current sample was good (α 0.83; 95% CI [0.72, 0.91]). 
3.3.3. Data analytic plan 
Data analyses were conducted in SPSS version 27 (IBM Corp, 2020 ). 
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all measures administered, 
including tests of normality. Acceptability and feasibility ratings for the 
DMI were also evaluated. We assessed presence or absence of each DMI 
interview item using a rule of severity score rating ≽1 to examine Table 3

8patterns of endorsement rates. Prevalence rates were also used to flag 
potential items to eliminate in future iterations of the interview. Given 
the preliminary nature of this study, confidence intervals are presented 
to point estimates and significance testing throughout the results 
(Cooper, 2018 ). 
3.3.3.1. Internal reliability. To refine the DMI using exploratory psy-
chometric analyses, we examined means and standard deviations for 
each individual item, as well as for each DMI outcome score. We 
calculated total and summary scores on the DMI and evaluated internal 
consistency and inter-scale correlations in order to describe the re-
lationships between assessed constructs and further explore conceptual 
groupings of the DMI outcome scores. Cronbach's alphas were computed 
for all interview items (total DMI score), as well for the three subscores 
(current symptom severity, current impairment, and global impact 
scores). In addition, confidence intervals were calculated for the coef-
ficient alphas (Cooper, 2018 ). Item-total correlations were examined for 
all outcome scores. Items with item-total correlations less than 0.30 
were removed from subsequent analyses (Brzoska & Razum, 2010 ; 
Cristobal et al., 2007 ; De Vaus, 2004 ; Maltby et al., 2007 ; Pedhazur & 
Schmelkin, 2013 ). 
3.3.3.2. Test re-test reliability. We evaluated one month test-retest reli-
ability among the 30% of the sample (n 9) that was randomized to a 
follow-up visit in order to quantify test consistency over time. Bivariate 
correlations were computed between baseline and follow-up timepoints 
for DMI outcome scores. 
3.3.3.3. External validation using existing measures. Concurrent validity 
was examined by estimating correlations with external measures of 
misophonia and symptoms of broader psychopathology. Pearson 
bivariate correlations were conducted between DMI total score and 
subscores with the MQ and A-MISO-S for measures of misophonia, as 
well as the BSI-18 for a measure of general psychopathology. 3.3.3.4. Discriminant validity. Discriminant validity was examined 
among the same 30% of the sample (n 9) by estimating correlations 
with external constructs. Pearson bivariate correlations were conducted 
between DMI total score and the CRS and the MCSD, as neither religi -
osity nor social desirability are constructs with theoretical overlap with 
misophonia. 
3.3.3.5. Predictive validity. Predictive validity was examined by esti-
mating correlations with external constructs. Pearson bivariate corre -
lations were conducted between the DMI total score and subscores with 
the MQ, A-MISO-S, and BSI. 
4.Results 
4.1. Descriptive statistics 
Most participants in the current sample identified as female (n 23, 
76.6%), White (n 27, 90%), and non-Hispanic (n 27). The average 
age of the sample was 35.90 years (SD 12.67). Forty percent of par-
ticipants indicated they were single, never married (n 12), had 
completed college (n 12), and had a salary range of above $40,000 (n 
17, 57%). 
The total scores for the MQ, A-MISO-S, BSI-18, CRS, and MCSD were 
all within normal distribution. Skewness ranged from 0.05 to 1.12; 
kurtosis ranged from  0.93 to 1.9 (Gravetter & Wallnau, 2014 ; Trochim 
& Donnelly, 2006 ). The mean score on the MQ Symptom Scale was 
21.60 (SD 4.87) and on the MQ Emotions and Behavior Scale was 
25.60 (SD 5.79), suggesting that on average participants marked re-
sponses between “sometimes true” and “often true” when asked how 
often they were sensitive to various potential sound triggers, and how 
often they experienced certain emotional and behavioral responses to 
these triggers. Responses to the MQ Impairment Scale (M 8.73, SD 
1.82) suggest that on average the sample reported “moderate sound 
sensitivities. ” Twenty-nine participants (96.67%) reported “clinically 
significant symptoms ” on the MQ (i.e., ≽7 on the impairment subscale Table 4 
Inter-item Bivariate Correlations for Total Scores (α 0.91).

9(Wu et al., 2014 ). The mean total score on the A-MISO-S was 13.87 (SD 
3.10), suggesting that on average participants marked responses be-
tween “mild ” and “moderate ” when asked about the frequency, inter-
ference, and distress, as well as levels of resistance, control, and 
avoidance of misophonic cues in the past week. Responses to the BSI-18 
(M 13.83, SD 10.51) suggest that on average participants had mild 
anxiety, depression, and/or somatization symptoms. Acceptability and 
feasibility ratings for the DMI were, on average, both rated between 
“very acceptable ” and “extremely acceptable ” (M 4.63, SD 0.56 and 
0.62, respectively). 
4.2. Prevalence of DMI item endorsement 
To examine endorsement of DMI interview items, we computed 
frequencies of all 19 items. Current misophonia items on the DMI were 
endorsed by 100% of the current sample (symptom presence defined by 
severity rating ≽1; Table 2), suggesting strong face validity of the DMI 
items. 
4.3. Preliminary internal reliability 
In order to explore preliminary internal reliability of the DMI, we 
calculated summary scores on the DMI interview and examined inter- 
item and item-total correlations, as well as Cronbach's alphas among 
DMI outcome scores. Internal reliability of the total DMI score was 
excellent: Cronbach's alpha coefficient for all 19 interview items was α 
0.90 (95% CI [0.84, 0.95]). Item-total correlations among all inter-
view items were strong, as all items except one had item-total correla -
tions between 0.32 and 0.76 (see Table 3). Item #7, assessing worry for a 
lot of the time about future noises, had an item-total correlation of 
 0.04 and produced a higher Cronbach's alpha when the value was 
deleted. As such, Item #7 was excluded from remaining analyses; 18 of 
the 19 items were retained in subsequent analyses. 
Inter-item correlations between each of the retained 18 items are 
displayed in Table 4. Mean total score of all retained 18 items on the DMI 
was 31.67 (SD 10.98), out of a maximum of 72 points. Cronbach's 
alpha for the total DMI score was excellent (α 0.91; 95% CI [0.86, 
0.95]; see Table 5), and average inter-item correlation (AIC) for the DMI 
was 0.36. Mean current severity score was 18.40 (SD 7.34), out of a 
maximum of 48 points for the 12 items. Cronbach's alpha for the current 
severity score items was strong (α 0.86; 95% CI [0.78, 0.92]) and AIC 
was 0.33. Mean current impairment score was 10.30 (SD 6.57), out of 
a maximum of 24 points for the 12 items. Cronbach's alpha for the 
current impairment score items was strong (α 0.86; 95% CI [0.78, 
0.92]) and AIC was 0.33. Mean global impact score was 8.60 (SD 
3.45), out of a maximum of 16 points for the four items. Cronbach's 
alpha for the global impact score items was excellent (α 0.88; 95% CI 
[0.81, 0.93]) and AIC was 0.68. Further, inter-scale correlations be-
tween the DMI total score and current severity, current impairment, and 
global impact scores were all significant (rs 0.96, 0.74, 0.78, respectively, ps D0.001). Correlations among the three scores were also 
significant (see Table 6). 
Taken together, the (a) high endorsement of DMI interview items, (b) 
strong Cronbach's alphas across the four DMI outcome scores, (c) AICs 
for the DMI total, current severity, and current impairment scores within 
recommended range (Clark & Watson, 1995 ), and (d) inter-scale cor-
relations between the DMI outcome scores provide preliminary evidence 
of internal reliability for the DMI. 
4.4. Test re-test reliability 
Test-retest reliability of the DMI was explored by computing bivar -
iate correlations between DMI scores from the baseline assessment and 
the follow-up visit among the 30% of participants randomized to follow- 
up. Pearson correlation coefficients between the DMI total scores (r 
0.95, p D.0001; 95% CI [0.89, 0.99]), current severity scores (r 0.94, 
p D.0001; 95% CI [0.86, 0.98]), current impairment scores (r 0.88, p 
.002; 95% CI [0.73, 0.97]), and global impact scores (r 0.995, p D
.0001; 95% CI [0.98, 0.99]) at both time points were all strongly and 
positively correlated. Consistent with large correlation coefficient effect 
sizes (Cohen, 1988 ), these findings support preliminary evidence of test 
re-test reliability for the DMI. 
4.5. External validation 
Next, to assess preliminary concurrent validity between the DMI and 
existing measures of misophonia, bivariate correlations were conducted. 
Pearson correlations indicated that the MQ total score and A-MISO-S 
total score in the current sample were positively correlated with each 
other (r 0.50, p .005). As hypothesized, preliminary evidence of 
convergent validity was observed in correlations between the MQ and 
DMI (see Table 7). Similarly, there was evidence of significant, positive 
correlations between the A-MISO-S and some DMI scores. In order to 
examine convergent validity between the DMI and general psychopa -
thology, correlations were computed between the DMI and BSI-18. 
Bivariate correlations between BSI-18 and DMI total (r 0.42, p 
.020), current impairment (r 0.49, p .006), and global impact (r 
0.54, p .002) scores were consistent with moderate correlation coef-
ficient effect sizes (Cohen, 1988 ). DMI current severity score was not 
correlated with BSI-18 total score. Taken together, these results indicate 
preliminary evidence of concurrent validity for the DMI. 
4.6. Discriminant validity 
To examine preliminary discriminant validity, correlations were 
conducted between the DMI and the CRS and MCSD. Results suggest that 
the DMI was not significantly related to either religiosity (r 0.05, p 
.912) or social desirability (r  0.03, p .868). These findings suggest 
preliminary discriminant validity for the DMI. Table 5

104.7. Predictive validity 
Lastly, bivariate correlations were conducted between DMI at initial 
assessment visit and self-report measures of misophonia and general 
psychopathology for the subset of the sample that was randomized to the 
follow-up visit (n 9). Pearson correlations indicated that DMI total 
score was positively correlated with MQ emotions and behavior subscale 
(r 0.81, p .008), MQ severity score (r 73, p .025; 95% CI [0.57, 
0.95]) and A-MISO-S total score at follow up (r 0.71, p .032; 95% CI 
[0.34, 92]). DMI total score was not correlated with MQ total score at 
follow up or BSI-18 total score at follow up. These findings provide 
preliminary evidence of predictive validity of the DMI. 
5.Discussion 
The overarching aim of this study was to develop and begin to psy-
chometrically validate a semi-structured clinical interview to assess 
misophonia in adults. In addition to establishing symptom presence, as 
well as severity and impairment in functioning from misophonia, we 
also incorporated items that capture a broad spectrum of responses to 
triggers across affective, cognitive, physiological, and behavioral do-
mains. The interview assesses ways in which these response strategies 
are effective and/or ineffective, as well as dysfunctional beliefs related 
to misophonia. There were two phases of interview development. In 
Phase 1, interview items were generated and iteratively refined from 
both a scientific literature review and qualitative feedback from miso-
phonia sufferers and experts. In Phase 2, a separate sample of adults was 
recruited to complete the DMI and other measures in order to assess 
exploratory psychometric properties. A third of participants were ran-
domized to a follow-up visit in order to begin assesssing test-retest 
reliability and predictive validity. Iterative analytic procedures (e.g., 
estimated item-total correlations) were used to derive proposed final 
DMI items. From the overall item pool, the final DMI consists of 18 
items, and includes four outcome scores: (1) Total DMI score (all 18 
items), (2) Current severity score (12 items), (3) Current impairment 
score (12 items), and (4) Global impact score (4 items). 
The DMI is the first semi-structured clinical interview for misophonia 
developed using iterative, grassroots methods integrating suggestions 
and feedback directly from key stakeholders (i.e., individuals with 
misophonia and experts in the field). Our approach to interview devel -
opment was conducted to optimize interview accessibility and applica -
bility in both research and clinical settings, and to limit investigator 
biases or assumptions about misophonia that could influence the in-
clusion or exclusion of interview items. This study suggests that the DMI 
includes reliable and valid scores reflecting a wide range of responses to 
misophonia. Intercorrelations between DMI scores indicated strong relationships between constructs. For example, the current severity, 
current impairment, and global impact scores correlated strongly with 
DMI total score. 
As hypothesized, the DMI was significantly positively correlated with 
extant self-report measures of misophonia, including the MQ (Wu et al., 
2014 ) and A-MISO-S (Schroder et al., 2013 ), and a general measure of 
psychopathology (BSI; Derogatis, 2001 ), supporting the preliminary 
convergent validity of the DMI. Further, the DMI was not correlated with 
measures of religiosity and social desirability, two constructs with no a 
priori theoretical overlap with misophonia, suggesting preliminary 
discriminant validity of the DMI. Test-retest reliability between the two 
assessment timepoints were strong. Correlations between the DMI at 
baseline and the A-MISO-S as well as certain MQ subscales were 
significantly positively correlated, indicating preliminary adequate 
predictive validity of the DMI. 
The full DMI may be used to assess misophonia symptoms, functional 
impairment, response patterns to triggers, beliefs associated with the 
disorder, and the global impact of misophonia symptomatology. In 
addition, DMI subscores can be utilized to investigate changes in specific 
processes during treatment for misophonia. Researchers and/or clini-
cians examining intervention outcomes on patterns of thinking and 
physiological responses in misophonia could use the DMI current 
severity score as an endpoint. Similarly, the impact of interventions on 
impairment could be investigated using the DMI impairment score. 
The results of this study should be considered within the context of 
its limitations. First, it should also be noted that, despite the iterative, 
grassroots approach taken for item generation and inclusion, in light of 
the heterogeneity of misophonia, any given individual completing the 
DMI may report other features not captured by the DMI. Second, our 
sample in Phase 2 was largely homogenous (i.e., mostly White, female 
participants) and small (n 30), which may limit the reliability and 
validity of the measure. The size of the subsample for test-retest and 
predictive validity (n 9) may have inflated correlation coefficients 
through possible non-normality. Future research should replicate and 
extend our preliminary findings and evaluate the DMI using larger, more 
diverse clinical and general population samples which may provide 
useful insight into phenotypic differences on the DMI. Efforts to diversify 
future samples may include incorporating a demographic survey and 
prioritizing enrollment of underrepresented participants. The inclusion 
of comparison samples of non-misophonic participants may also func-
tion to validate the face validity of the interview items as discriminating 
between those with and without misophonia. Third, preliminary psy-
chometric examination of the DMI was limited by not conducting inter- 
rater reliability. Validation studies of the DMI should include adminis -
tration by multiple clinicians, researchers, and/or paraprofessionals, 
and include inter-rater reliability findings. Next, despite the enhanced 
precision and accuracy that semi-structured clinical interviewing is able 
to achieve, quantifying frequency, duration, and intensity of symptoms 
still may be vulnerable to response biases, variable interpretations of 
questions and limitations in respondents' ability to quantify subjective 
experience. For example, social desireability in presentation to the 
interviewer could lead to either under- or over-reporting; variable in-
terpretations of what respondents' consider to be functionally impairing 
could limit validity. As such, laboratory-based behavioral paradigms to 
assess misophonia in addition to structured clinical interviews could 
help offset these limitations. Lastly, there were weak but positive cor-
relations between the DMI scores with existing measures of misophonia, 
likely due to sample size and lack of power to detect stronger correla -
tions. In the next phase of validation studies of the DMI, inclusion of 
other self-report measures of misophonia with stronger psychometric 
properties (e.g., DMQ; Rosenthal et al., 2021 ) is warranted. 
5.1. Future directions 
The consensus definition of misophonia (Swedo et al., 2021 ) was

11DMI should ensure consistency with the recently published expert 
definition. Specifically, additions to the interview that reflect the 
consensus definition may include: more in-depth questions about in-
fluences on misophonic reactions (e.g., perceived degree of control over 
stimulus), attentional reactions (e.g., hyperfocus or obsession), and 
coping strategies to manage misophonia. Relatedly, additional input 
from interdisciplinary subspecialities (e.g., audiology, occupational 
therapy, neuroscience, otolaryngology) should be considered in future 
iterations to continue limiting investigator bias, and increasing acces -
sibility, feasibility, and clinical utility of the DMI. 
Additional future directions for the interview may include creation 
of a shorter version. DMI administration in this study took between 45 
and 90 min. A briefer version of the DMI may be preferred in some 
contexts, especially so that DMI administration could fit within a stan-
dard psychotherapy session. One approach to shortening the DMI may 
be removing items with low rates of endorsement. For example, Items 
#3 (rumination about prior sounds) and #14 (self-harm) were endorsed 
by less than 30% of the current sample, indicating preliminary empirical 
basis for removal. Further research using larger samples is needed to 
reliably identify items for removal based on this criterion. In addition to 
developing a briefer version of the DMI for adults, adaption of the DMI to 
individuals under the age of 18 is warranted, as emerging evidence 
highlights that the onset of misophonia may be during childhood (Jager 
et al., 2020 ). In addition to iterative changes to the interview and ad-
aptations of the DMI, future studies should focus on training para-
professionals to administer the DMI in order to increase both clinical and 
research utility. 
5.2. Conclusions 
The DMI was developed as the first semi-structured clinical interview 
for misophonia to overcome the limitations of existing measures for this 
new disorder. Although preliminary, initial results evaluating the DMI 
satisfy the majority of proposed interview standards (Watson, 1990 ), 
including correspondence with proposed diagnostic criteria, inclusion of 
both dichotomous and continuous ratings, and adequate reliability and 
validity. Though validation and research on the integration of the DMI 
into varied clinical and research settings is needed, preliminary findings 
suggest the DMI may have excellent internal consistency, test re-test 
reliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and predictive 
validity. This study offers promising preliminary evidence for a clini-
cally and empirically useful tool to understand misophonia, a new and 
understudied disorder.
