## ABSTRACT

## ARTICLE HISTORY

Background: Misophonia is a disorder in which patients suffer from anger or disgust when confronted with specific sounds such as loud chewing or breathing, causing avoidance of cuerelated  situations  resulting  in  significant  functional  impairment.  Though  the  first  treatment studies with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) showed promising results, an average of 50% of the patients has not improved much clinically.

Objective: The  aim  of  this  pilot  study  was  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  eye  movement desensitization  and  reprocessing  (EMDR)  therapy  as  a  trauma-focused  approach  in  treating misophonia symptoms.

Method: A  sample  of  10  adult  participants  with  misophonia  was  studied  at  the  outpatient clinic of the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam. Participants were either on the waiting list for CBT or non-responders to CBT. EMDR was focused on misophonia-related emotionally disturbing memories and delivered in a mean of 2.6 sessions of 60-90 minutes. Pre- and posttreatment  self-assessed  ratings  of  misophonia  symptoms  (AMISOS-R,  primary  outcome),  of general  psychopathology  (SCL-90-R)  and  of  quality  of  life  (SDS)  were  administered.  The  coprimary outcome was the Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale (CGI-I).

Results: A paired  -test ( t n = 8) showed improvement on the primary outcome (-6.14 [MD], 5.34 [SD])  on  the  AMISOS-R  ( P =  .023).  Three  of  the  eight  patients  showed  clinically  significant improvement  measured  with  the  CGI-I.  No  significant  effect  on  secondary  outcomes  was found.

Conclusions: These  preliminary  results  suggest  that  EMDR  therapy  focused  on  emotionally disturbing misophonia-related memories can reduce misophonia symptoms. RCTs with sufficient sample sizes are required to firmly establish the value of EMDR therapy for misophonia.

## Terapia EMDR para la misofonía: un estudio piloto de series de casos

Antecedentes : La  misofonía  es  un  trastorno  en  el  que  los  pacientes  sufren  de  rabia o desagrado cuando se enfrentan a sonidos específicos como la masticación o la respiración ruidosa, lo que provoca la evitación de las situaciones relacionadas con el estímulo y da lugar a un deterioro funcional significativo. Aunque los primeros estudios de tratamiento con terapia cognitivo-conductual  (TCC)  mostraron  resultados  prometedores,  una  media  del  50%  de  los pacientes no ha mejorado mucho clínicamente.

Objetivo : El  objetivo  de  este  estudio  piloto  fue  evaluar  la  eficacia  de  la  terapia  de desensibilización  y  reprocesamiento  por  movimientos  oculares  (EMDR)  como  enfoque  centrado en el trauma para tratar los síntomas de la misofonía.

Método : Se  estudió  una  muestra  de  10  participantes  adultos  con  misofonía  en  la  clínica ambulatoria del Centro Médico Académico de Ámsterdam. Los participantes estaban en lista de  espera  para  la  TCC  o  no  respondían  a  la  TCC.  La  EMDR  se  centró  en  los  recuerdos emocionalmente  perturbadores  relacionados  con  la  misofonía  y  se  aplicó  en  una  media  de 2,6 sesiones de 60-90 minutos. Se administraron calificaciones autoevaluadas antes y después del tratamiento de los síntomas de misofonía (AMISOS-R, resultado primario), de psicopatología general (SCL-90-R) y de calidad de vida (SDS). El resultado co-primario fue la escala de Mejora de la Impresión Clínica Global (CGI-I).

Resultados :  Una prueba t pareada ( n =8) mostró una mejora en el resultado primario (-6,14 [DM]), 5,34 [DE] en la AMISOS-R ( P = .023). Tres de los ocho pacientes mostraron una mejora clínicamente significativa medida con la CGI-I. No se encontró ningún efecto significativo en los resultados secundarios.

EMDR para la misofonía Estos resultados preliminares sugieren que la terapia EMDR centrada en los recuerdos emocionalmente perturbadores relacionados con la misofonía puede reducir los síntomas de ésta. Se requieren ECAs con tamaños de muestra suficientes para establecer firmemente el valour de la terapia EMDR para la misofonía.

## 1. Background

Misophonia is a disorder in which patients suffer from anger or disgust when confronted with specific sounds such as loud chewing or breathing, causing avoidance of cue-related situations resulting in significant functional impairments  (Jager  et  al.,  2020a;  Schröder, Vulink,  &amp;  Denys,  2013).  Misophonia  patients  can often  not  eat,  sleep  or  work  in  company  and  most social  and  family  relations  are  negatively  affected. Since the onset of symptoms is around the age of 13 (Jager et al, 2020a; Schröder et al., 2013), misophonia patients develop a lifelong coping behaviour of avoidance, like walking away or using music or earplugs to camouflage trigger sounds. There is debate about the nature of the disorder, other research groups emphasize  its  audiological  or  neurological nature. Recently, a Delphi Process study led to an agreement of experts of  at  least  80%  on  the  consensus  definition  of  misophonia (Swedo et al., 2021).

patients (Jager et al., 2020b) showed significant clinical improvement  with  CBT  post  treatment.  However, CBT is ineffective  for  more  than  half  of  misophonia patients, who therefore require alternative treatments. Except for CBT, some data suggest Tinnitus Retraining  Therapy  offers  an  83%  success  rate  for misophonia (Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff, 2014).

Estimates of the incidence of misophonia in adults vary (Naylor, Caimino, Scutt, Hoare, &amp; Baguley, 2020; Zhou,  Wu,  &amp;  Storch,  2017).  Solid  epidemiological studies  are  missing,  also  as  a  consequence  of  the ongoing  debate  about  the  definition  of  misophonia. Comorbidity is relatively low: 40% (Erfanian, Kartsonaki,  &amp;  Keshavarz,  2019)  to  72%  (Jager  et  al., 2020a) of subjects diagnosed with misophonia do not report  another  Axis  I  psychiatric  disorder.  Hence, misophonia  is  an  impairing  and  common  disorder for which  effective treatment  is urgently needed, given the huge impact on family and social relations.

The  Amsterdam  University  Medical  Center  of Psychiatry,  location  AMC  (Amsterdam  UMC)  has developed the first  protocoled  treatment  with  cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for misophonia (Van Loon et al., 2019). CBT consists of four main components: task concentration  exercises,  positive  affect labelling,  stimulus  manipulation,  and  arousal  reduction.  The  first  treatment  studies  with  CBT  showed promising results, respectively, 48% (Schröder, Vulink,  Van  Loon,  &amp;  Denys,  2017)  and  37%  of  the

EMDR therapy is an evidence-based psychological treatment  that  is  effective  for  post-traumatic  stress disorder  (PTSD)  and  its  comorbid  symptoms  (De Jongh, Amann, Hofmann, Farrell, &amp; Lee, 2019; International Society of Traumatic Stress Studies [ISTSS], 2019; National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2018). In the last decades, the insight that unprocessed  traumatic  memories  (not  only  criterion A events) play an important role in the development and maintenance of a variety of mental health conditions  led  to  the  use  of  EMDR  therapy  as  a  traumafocused treatment for a broader spectrum of disorders (Shapiro, 2018). Evidence for its effectiveness for disorders  beyond  PTSD  is  growing,  such  as  for  major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis, anxiety disorders,  obsessive  compulsive  disorder,  substance  use  disorder,  and  pain  (Matthijssen  et  al., 2020;  Maxfield,  2019).  In  a  recent  meta-analysis  of RCTs  (Cuijpers,  Veen,  Sijbrandij,  Yoder,  &amp;  Cristea, 2020),  significant  results  were  found  for  EMDR  in phobias and test anxiety, but with a high risk of bias. Overall, the authors  concluded  that  there is not enough  evidence  for  the  use  of  EMDR  for  mental health  problems  other  than  PTSD  (Cuijpers  et  al., 2020).  More  research  on  EMDR  and  larger  RCTs with  clear-cut  results  are  needed,  as  in  the  majority of the RCTs EMDR is merely used for comorbid PTSD or as an add-on to treatment-as-usual (Meyerbröker, Emmelkamp, &amp; Merkx, 2019).

The theoretical model behind EMDR, the adaptive information  processing  model  (AIP),  suggests  that 'dysfunctionally  stored'  memories  may  have  an  atiological and maintaining role for a broad spectrum of symptoms and problems, not limited to PTSD (Hase,

Balmaceda, Ostacoli, Liebermann, &amp; Hofmann, 2017; Shapiro,  2018).  Desensitization  and  reprocessing  of these  disturbing  memories  and  images  with  EMDR will result in reduction of the vividness and emotionality of unpleasant mental representations (Gunter &amp; Bodner, 2008).

Up  to date it is unknown  if  there might  be a connection  between  misophonia  symptoms  and related disturbing  experiences  or  memories.  Only one case description found a decrease in misophonia symptoms  after  EMDR  treatment  (Vollbehr  &amp;  ten Broeke,  2017).  When  relevant  memories  are  found a  trauma-focused  approach  such  as  EMDR  therapy could reduce misophonia symptoms. This pilot study aimed first to identify relevant experiences related to misophonia symptoms and secondly to reduce misophonia symptoms with EMDR therapy for reprocessing  maladaptive  implicit  memories.  Therefore,  with this pilot study we assess the feasibility and preliminary  effectiveness  of  EMDR  in  reducing  misophonia symptoms and improving general mental functioning and quality of life.

## 2. Methods

The study site was the outpatient clinic of the department  of  psychiatry  of  the  Amsterdam  University Medical  Center  (Amsterdam  UMC,  location  AMC, the  Netherlands).  All  patients  gave  written  informed consent. The study was approved by the AMC medical ethics committee and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

## 2.1. Participant selection, recruitment, and enrolment

A total of 14 patients were selected from September 2015 to July 2017 from the outpatient clinic at the Amsterdam UMC (see Figure 1). All patients were referred by their General Practitioners for treatment of invalidating

misophonia  symptoms.  All  had  received  a  psychiatric assessment  at  our  clinic.  Presence  of  comorbid  Axis I  disorders  according  to  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM-IV-TR)  diagnostic criteria was validated at baseline by the MINIInternational  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  Plus  (MINIplus)  (Sheehan  et  al.,  1997;  Sheehan  et  al.,  1998;  Van Vliet &amp; De Beurs, 2007).

Recruited patients were either on the waiting list for treatment  or  non-responders  to  CBT.  Ten  subsequently  referred  patients,  who  were  most  recently added  to  the  waiting  list,  were  approached  in  order of  registration.  Six  were  included,  four  patients  were not willing to participate. We also included four nonresponders;  patients  who  completed  CBT  without positive  results  at  the  AMC  in  the  period  of  this study and searched for help and further treatment.

Inclusion  criteria  were  diagnosis  of  misophonia (Schröder  et  al.,  2013)  and  aged  between  18  and 65  years.  Exclusion  criteria  were:  previous  EMDR treatment for misophonia, the presence of depression and  anxiety  disorder  as  a  primary  diagnosis,  bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia or any other psychotic disorder, substance-related disorder  during  the  past  6  months,  any  structural  central nervous system disorder or stroke within the last year, currently taking benzodiazepines or stimulants, patients at risk for suicide and patients with language barriers or illiteracy.

## 2.2. EMDR therapy

The EMDR therapy was conducted according to the standard  eight-phase  protocol  by  Shapiro  using  the Dutch  translation  of  the  EMDR  protocol  (De  Jongh &amp;  ten  Broeke,  2019;  Shapiro,  2001).  The  standard EMDR treatment protocol (Shapiro, 2018) consists of the  following  phases:  1.  History  Taking  (including discussion of the rationale for therapy and case conceptualization/idiographic formulation of the patient's

difficulties); 2. Preparation (preparation for reprocessing of target trauma memories and equipping patients  with  strategies  to  better  self-regulate  during trauma reprocessing work); 3. Assessment (the identification  of  a  specific  target  memory/image  as  well  as associated negative cognitions, disturbing emotions or bodily  sensations;  a  positive  cognition  that  is  preferable to the negative one is also identified); 4. Desensitization and reprocessing (involving the repetitive  use  of  bilateral  stimulation,  for  example,  the tracking  of  a  moving  object,  while  the  patient  is asked to simultaneously focus on the image, the negative  cognition,  and  the  disturbing  emotion  or  body sensation until he/she reports a marked reduction in distress associated with these experiences); 5. Installation  (in  which  the  patient  is  encouraged  to associate the trauma memory with the positive cognition  previously  identified,  or  a  new  more  adaptive positive  cognition);  6.  Body  scan  (designed  to  target any  residual  negative/uncomfortable  physical  sensation  or  bodily  tension  associated  with  the  trauma memory);  7.  Closure  (generally  involving  the  use  of distress  management  and  tolerance  strategies  before the  end  of  the  session);  8.  Re-evaluation  (where  the patient  and  therapist  reassess  the  previous  target  to evaluate whether additional work is necessary before proceeding further with the intervention).

The  memories  EMDR  focused  on  were  identified (phase  1)  following  a  standardized  search  strategy called time-line path in the first session (first method; de Jongh et al., 2010). This strategy is used for a broad spectrum  of  symptoms  beyond  PTSD  and  helps  to develop a case conceptualization in terms of a relationship between memories of significant events, on  one  hand,  and  clients'  current  symptoms,  on  the other hand. It is also suggested for the case conceptualization  for  EMDR  for  misophonia  (Vollbehr  &amp;  ten Broeke,  2017).  The  time-line  path  deals  with  symptoms whereby memories of the aetiological and aggravating events can be specified on a time line. For this pilot study, the main questions of the therapist were: 'When did your misophonia symptoms start and when did they get worse?'. The events or experiences found were target memories for EMDR and processed with EMDR.  The  order  of  targets  was  set;  starting  with targets that were related to the onset of the misophonia symptoms and subsequently, the memories of the events after which symptoms worsened. For all identified events a Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUD) score  was  given  between  0  and  10  (0  meaning  no distress  to  10  meaning  highest  distress)  that  was  felt when  the  memory  was  kept  in  mind.  Hereafter,  the standard protocol was first applied to the first target memory in time. A substantial reduction in SUD was required  to  move  to  the  next  memory.  In  all  the following  sessions,  memories  were  processed.  Eye movements were applied as a dual-attention stimulus.

Each EMDR session lasted 60-90 minutes. Treatment was ended when the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUD)  score  was  zero  for  all  indexed  misophoniarelated memories  identified  on  the  time-line. All patients were equally involved in the eight phases of the  standard  protocol.  The  total  number  of  sessions varied  across  patients  depending  on  the  number  of targets and the speed of desensitization.

The  therapist  was  a  licenced  clinical  psychologist (IJ)  with  appropriate  training  (level  II  trained)  in EMDR and extensive experience in CBT for obsessivecompulsive and related disorders and misophonia in particular.

## 2.3. Assessments

Patients were assessed at baseline (T1), and post treatment  (T2).  At  T2  an  independent  assessor  rated  all patients  in a clinical interview.  This  independent assessor  was  a  cognitive  behavioural  worker  with extensive experience in CBT for misophonia.

## 2.4. Measures

## 2.4.1. Primary outcomes

Misophonia symptoms  were measured using the revised  Amsterdam  Misophonia  Scale  (AMISOS-R) (Schröder  &amp;  Spape,  2014).  It  consists  of  10  items with scores ranging from 0 to 40. Higher scores indicate more severe misophonia; 0-10: normal to subclinical  misophonia;  11-20:  mild  misophonia;  21-30: moderate severe misophonia; 31-40: severe to extreme misophonia. (see supplementary appendix). This improved  version  of  the  A-MISO-S  (Schröder  et  al., 2013)  is  in  the  process  of  validation;  Preliminary results  of  the  validation  show  reliability  of  the  scale was good (α = .84), as well as its validity (r = .87, p &lt; .01).

The  co-primary  outcome  was  CGI-Improvement (CGI-I)  (Guy,  1976)  as  objective  observer  ratings. The  CGI-I  consists  of  one  question:  'Compared  to the  patient's  condition  at  admission  to  the  project this  patient's  condition  is:  1  =  very  much  improved since the initiation of treatment; 2 = much improved; 3 = minimally improved; 4 = no change from baseline (the  initiation  of  treatment);  5  =  minimally  worse; 6  =  much  worse;  7  =  very  much  worse  since  the initiation of treatment.'

Responses  are  defined  by  a  CGI-I  scale  score  &lt;3, usually  used  to  define  response  (Bandelow,  Baldwin, Dolberg, Andersen, &amp; Stein, 2006). Full response was defined by 25% reduction (or more) in the AMISOS-R and a CGI-I score &lt;3. Partial response was defined by either a 25% reduction (or more) on the AMISOS-R or a CGI-I score &lt;3.

## 2.4.2. Secondary outcomes

General  mental  dysfunction  was  assessed  with  the Symptom  Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R; Arrindell &amp; Ettema, 1986; Derogatis, Lipman, &amp; Covi, 1973). The total score is 90 to 450, with higher scores indicating more  general  psychopathology.  Quality  of  life  was assessed with the Sheehan  Disability Scale (SDS; Sheehan,  1983).  The  SDS  has  three  domains;  Work, Social and Family, and the range per domain is 0 to 10. The total score was 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more impairment.

## 2.4.3. Qualitative outcome

The perceived intensity of disturbance or distress of an image or an emotional memory being recalled is measured  with  the  Subjective  Units  of  Distress  (SUD) scale.  This  score  is  indexed  on  an  11-point  Likert scale,  ranging  from  0  ('no  disturbance  at  all')  to  10 ('greatest level of disturbance') (Shapiro, 2018). Participants were requested to indicate the SUD score verbally to the therapist for all identified events at the start, during and after EMDR therapy. The SUD scores are displayed at Table 4.

The severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms was measured on indication (if the presence of these symptoms  was  assumed)  with  the  Impact  of  Events  Scale (IES;  Brom  &amp;  Kleber,  1985;  Horowitz,  Wilner,  &amp; Alvarez,  1979;  van  der  Ploeg,  Mooren,  Kleber,  van der  Velden,  &amp;  Brom,  2004).  The  Impact  of  Events Scale  has  two  subscales  (avoidance  and  intrusions) and a total score ranging from 15 to 60, with higher scores indicating more PTSD symptoms and a cut-off score of 33 or more (Creamer, Bell, &amp; Failla, 2003).

## 2.4.4. Statistical analysis

Since this is a pilot study no formal sample size calculations  were  performed.  We  tested  the  decrease  in symptom severity with a paired t-test; the dependent variable was AMISOS-R total score, and independent factors were  assessments  (T1,  T2).  An  additional intention-to-treat  analysis  was  performed,  including all patients who received EMDR therapy, irrespective of whether they completed the therapy. Missing values were  hereby  imputed  by  the  last  observation  carried forward (LOCF).

All  analyses  were  all  based  on  2-tailed  t-tests.  For both co-primary and secondary outcomes P &lt; .05 was considered  to  be  statistically  significant.  All  results should  be  considered  as  exploratory.  In  all  analyses for  normal  distribution  was  controlled  by  ShapiroWilk and a visual check of the histogram. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25.

## 3. Results

## 3.1. Participant flow and characteristics

A total of 10 patients (9 [90%] female; mean [SD] age, 35 [14,53] years) were included (Table 1). Mean (SD) age  of  onset  was  13.10  (9.75).  Fifty  percent  of  the patients  fulfiled  criteria  (measured  with  the  MINIplus)  for  comorbidity  on  Axis  I,  none  of  patients suffered  from  comorbid  PTSD,  and  AXIS  II  personality traits were found in 60% of the patients.

In  eight  of  the  10  patients,  misophonia-related emotionally disturbing memories were identified; the other  two  patients  were  excluded  from  the  study. Seven  patients  completed  EMDR-therapy  and  the post-treatment  measures.  Only  one  patient  dropped out  after  the  first EMDR  session.  Despite  several attempts  to  approach  the  patient,  she  declined  to attend  treatment  appointments  and  post-treatment measures were missing.

## 3.2. Primary outcomes

On average, 2.6 sessions of EMDR were provided to each participant ( n = 7). A paired t-test for the completers  showed  significant  improvement  on  the  primary  outcome  (-6.14 [MD],  5.34 [SD]) on the AMISOS-R ( P = .023) (Tables 2 and 3). On average, the AMISOS-R total scores were reduced by 20%. In Figure 2 the decrease in AMISOS-R is shown for the completers.  An  additional  intention-to-treat  analysis showed the same significant difference and direction of  the  effect  on  the  AMISOS-R  (-5.37  [MD],  5.40 [SD], P = .026).

Three patients (#3, #7, #9) were found to be clinically improved, two of them with much improvement (CGI-I  &lt;  3).  One  patient  (#4),  who  showed  large improvement on the AMISOS-R, was not considered

clinically improved, since the improvement seemed to be related to temporary reduction of specific misophonia triggers.

In  conclusion,  the  full  response  rate  was  25%; two  of  the  eight  included  patients  had  both  25% symptom  reduction and a  maximum  CGI-I  score of 2 ('much improved' (2) or 'very much improved'  (1)).  Two  other  patients  were  considered as partial responders with at least 25% symptom  reduction  on  the  AMISOS-R or a  maximum CGI-I  score  of  2  (see  Table  4).

## 3.3. Secondary outcomes

No significant  effect  was  found  on  secondary  outcomes  (see  Tables  2  and  3).  However,  SCL-90 mean  scores decreased with 33%  and patients reported  fewer  disabilities in all SDS  subscales (work, family and social functioning) after EMDRtherapy.

In one patient who experienced neglect and aggression  as  negative  childhood  experiences,  the  IES  was administered  pre-  and  post-treatment.  The  scores  of 23 (pre) to 3 (post) were mild and not indicative for PTSD. The difference in total score between pre and post  was  large,  but  IES  was  not  used  as  an  outcome measure in this study.

## 3.4. Qualitative outcomes: misophonia-related memories

In total 14 target misophonia-related memories were  identified  in  eight  patients,  of  which  seven reported one or two targets and one patient reported  three  targets  (for  an  overview  of  the  targets,  see  Table  4).  The  number  of  EMDR  sessions varied from  1 to 4 sessions of 60-90  minutes. Subjective  Units  of  Distress  (SUD)  Scale  scores  at the  start  of  the  EMDR  therapy  varied  from  5  to  10 and  at  the  end  of  the  therapy  all  SUD  scores  were decreased  to  0.  Two  examples  of  target  memories are: firstly, as an 11-year-old girl on holiday sharing a  tent  with  her  father,  she  had  a  panic  attack  after

hyper  focusing  on  his  snoring  with  the  experience she could not escape from the tent in the middle of the night  (negative  cognition:  'I  am  powerless'). Secondly, as a 10-year-old girl who  could not grieve  at  her  grandmother's  funeral,  because  she was  so  bothered  by  the  breathing  sound  of  her crying  brother  that  she  snubbed  him  and  felt  terrible  about  herself  (negative  cognition:  'I  am  a  bad person').

## 3.5. Adverse events and side effects

No  adverse  events  were  reported. Three  patients showed  misophonia  symptoms  during  EMDR  (e.g. expressing  anger  in  reaction  to  the  ticking  of  the clock or to breathing sounds of the therapist). Other mild side effects included fatigue or headaches in three patients, lasting for two days maximum. One patient suffered  from  suicidal  ideations  with  intrusions  of suicide during EMDR treatment after the first session. After the second EMDR session, the suicidal ideations disappeared. In the end, this patient (#3) profited most of all patients from EMDR.

missing  and  extra  targets  were  used  during  EMDR therapy. Nevertheless, though no questionnaires were administered, Vollbehr and ten Broeke observed alleviation of symptoms  of  misophonia  without  full remission. Their patient was still sensitive to misophonia triggers, but his/her emotional reaction and avoidance behaviour diminished substantially. Apart from desensitization  of  the  identified  misophonia-related target  memories,  their  patient  was  also  instructed  to create an extremely inflated image of present triggers in  imagination,  after  which  desensitization  of  this image  took  place  (Shapiro,  2018).  In  our  study,  no present triggers, nor an inflated image of present triggers  were  targeted.  However,  after  having  treated  all misophonia-related target memories, the 'future template'  procedure  was  used  (Shapiro,  2018)  to  help patients  visualizing  successfully  managing  an  anticipated future event with misophonia triggers.

## 4. Discussion

This is the first clinical sample study which examines the feasibility and effectiveness of EMDR for misophonia in eight patients. The results showed that EMDR focused on desensitizing emotionally disturbing memories related to the onset or worsening of misophonia symptoms and significantly reduced these symptoms.

Our positive outcome is in line with the results of the  case  report  of  Vollbehr  and  ten  Broeke  (2017). However, comparisons with their findings is difficult, because  pre-  and  post-treatment  assessments  were

In our trial, for two out of 10 patients, no explicit disturbing misophonia-related  memories  could  be identified. For the remaining patients, their memories of the  first (onset)  misophonic  experience  and/or aggravating  experiences  were  treated.  The  nature  of these experiences were not evidently traumatic (corresponding to Criterion A of the DSM 5 PTSD criteria; American Psychiatric Association, 2013). They may be classified as unpleasant and disturbing, as is described in previous clinical case series (Ferreira, Harrison, &amp; Fontenelle, 2013; Johnson et al., 2013). Target memories related to the onset or worsening of misophonia in  childhood  consisted  in  our  pilot  of  situations  of fierce  arguments  caused  by  their  misophonia,  maladaptive coping incidents such as bulimic outrage, suicidal  ideations,  or  panic  attacks  when  misophonia triggers  could  not  be  avoided  (feeling  overwhelmed and  powerless).  Target  memories  of  the  two  full

responders were easier to identify with the time-line method  and  had  a  higher  level  of  observed  distress than  in  the  other  patients.  This  could  be  one  of  the reasons  why  EMDR  was  more  successful  in  these cases,  as  it  is  known  that  EMDR  is  more  effective when the level of disturbance at the start of the session is  high  (Littel,  Remijn,  Tinga,  Engelhard,  &amp;  van  den Hout, 2017). We did not examine predictors of treatment outcomes because of the small sample, but  we hypothesize that the nature of target memories, participant  characteristics  or  type  of  misophonia  symptoms such as disgust, might predict treatment outcomes. Hypothesizing about a treatment mechanism is beyond the scope of this article.

Since  we  used  only  the  time-line  procedure  to identify  the  target-memories  for  EMDR  therapy,  it remains  unclear  whether  the  two  patients  without target  memories  could  have  benefitted  from  EMDR. It would be interesting to add more explicit desensitization of 'present triggers' following desensitization of misophonia-related target memories, or use the creation of an extremely inflated image of present triggers (Rijkeboer,  ten  Broeke,  &amp;  Koekbakker,  2016).  We advise clinicians working with patients with misophonia to select and desensitize different types of targets, such  as  past  traumatic  or  disturbing  events,  present triggers (e.g. inflated image), and future targets as well.

Treatment options are still limited for misophonia. So far, the only well-studied intervention for misophonia is G-CBT (Jager et al., 2020b; Schröder et al., 2017). Compared to the results of the recent RCT of G-CBT, EMDR was less effective with a decrease of -6.14 vs -9.7  points  (G-CBT)  on  the  AMISOS-R  post  treatment,  respectively,  though  an  equal  percentage  of patients clinically improved, 38% with EMDR vs 37% with G-CBT on the CGI-I post treatment (Jager et al., 2020b).

G-CBT  and  EMDR  both  have  pros  and  cons. G-CBT  as  a  multicomponent  intervention  offers more  techniques  from  which  patients  can  profit, extensive  psychoeducation,  more  opportunity  to practice  under  guidance,  peer  support,  and  support of loved ones. The empirical level of evidence is higher  for  G-CBT  including  a  RCT  with  one 1-year  follow-up,  no  adverse  events  were  reported and  patient's  acceptability  is  high  (Jager  et  al., 2020b;  Schröder  et  al.,  2017).  In  this  pilot  study, EMDR therapy time was limited by a mean of 2.6 sessions of 1 to 1.5 hours (mean total of 3.9 hours) versus 8 (group) sessions of CBT of 3 hours (mean total  of  24  hours)  and  could  therefore  be  more cost-effective. As a con, apart from this case study, there is no empirical evidence for its effectivity. So far, indication to use EMDR  was  conditional, depending on the presence of emotionally disturbing  target  memories  related  to  the  onset  or  worsening  of  the  symptoms.

Our results suggest as well that EMDR is an attractive alternative for non-responders to G-CBT. In this pilot  study,  patients  on  the  waiting  list  for  G-CBT (n  =  6)  and  non-responders  to  G-CBT  (n  =  4)  were included.  Patients  from  both  groups  profited  from EMDR  (one  patient  waiting  for  CBT  and  2  nonresponders),  but  no  post-hoc  analyses  could  be  performed  because  of  the  small  sample  size.  We  might speculate in which cases EMDR or G-CBT should be considered. First, EMDR might be preferred in cases where clear  and  emotionally  disturbing  target  memories  for  EMDR  can  be  identified.  Secondly,  when therapists  can  not  provide  (G-)CBT  or  patients  are reluctant  to  participate  in  group  therapy.  Finally,  if patients are in need of a quick fix for example, when a  final  exam  in  2  weeks  is  hindered  by  misophonia symptoms.

## 4.1. Limitations and strengths

This is a small case series without a control group and therefore  our  study  suffers  from  several  important limitations.  The  lack  of  a  control  group  prevents  us from assessing the effects of time and of non-specific factors  on  misophonia  symptoms.  The  small  sample warrants caution in the  generalization  of  the  results. There was no follow-up assessment since half of the patients were on the waiting list for CBT and received CBT following EMDR, making it impossible to determine  whether  treatment  gain  was  maintained  over time.  The  inclusion  of  two  subpopulations  can  be considered a limitation in this small sample. However, this does resemble clinical practice. All participants received EMDR from one therapist, the evaluator  was  not  blind  to  treatment  and  treatment fidelity measures were not carried out, possibly leading to bias. More and larger studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of EMDR therapy and to determine the average number of EMDR sessions needed to significantly reduce misophonia symptoms. Finally, because  of  the  small  sample  size,  some  tantalizing questions regarding prediction or comparative efficacy with CBT could not be answered.

On the other hand, our study is innovative, and the use of a case series was considered appropriate given  the  exploratory  nature  of  the  study.  The sample  had  baseline  characteristics  comparable  to larger misophonia  samples  (Jager  et  al., 2020a; Rouw  &amp; Erfanian, 2018), leading to adequate external validity. We  used  a  diagnostic  clinical interview  to  assess  the  presence  of  disorders,  an objective diagnostic assessment (CGI) and a  manualized  treatment.  Data  were  also  analysed under restrictions of intention-to-treat analysis and missing values were imputed by LOCF, resulting  in  a  conservative  estimation  of  the  effect.

## 4.2. Conclusions

In  conclusion,  the  results  of  this  study  suggest  that EMDR therapy is a promising and time-limited intervention  in  reducing  misophonia  symptoms,  also  in patients  who  were  previously  unable  to  benefit  from evidence-based treatment (G-CBT). No adverse events were reported. Given the limitations due to the study design, the results should be considered preliminary. The  next  step  would  therefore  be  replication  of  the results  in  a  larger  RCT  comparing  EMDR  therapy (with  an  extended  target  selection)  with  CBT  and a  waiting  list  or  EMDR  therapy  as  an  add-on  intervention to CBT, with a long-term follow-up.
