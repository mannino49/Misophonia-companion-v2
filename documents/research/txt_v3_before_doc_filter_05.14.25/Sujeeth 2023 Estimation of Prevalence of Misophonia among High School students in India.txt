## Abstract

Objective Misophonia, an intriguing  psychological  disorder  is  characterized  by  intense  emotional  responses  to  specific sounds produced by others, has gained prominence for its distinct attributes and profound impact on individuals' emotional and psychological well-being. This study addresses the scarcity of research on misophonia's prevalence and severity among high school students, aiming to shed light on the unique challenges faced by this demographic in India.

Methods The study enrolled 597 high school students, including 269 females and 328 males, aged 14 to 16, with no history of psychological or otological problems or medication use. The Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire questionnaire, con -sisting of 21 questions with a 4-point Likert scale response, assessed emotional and behavioral reactions to sensitive sounds. Participants' scores categorized them as Sub-clinical, Mild, Moderate, or Severe misophonia.

Results The prevalence of misophonia was 34.67% among high school students, with 52.65% categorized as Mild, 45.41% as Moderate, and 1.93% as severe misophonia. A comparison with a similar study on college students in India revealed a higher prevalence of misophonia among high school students. This discrepancy may relate to adolescents' vulnerable psy -chological states, marked by limited emotional regulation and significant life transitions.

Conclusions This study significantly contributes to the evolving understanding of misophonia by spotlighting its prevalence and severity among high school students in India. The findings underscore the necessity of recognizing and addressing miso -phonia's impact during adolescence, a crucial developmental phase.

## Introduction

Misophonia is an intriguing psychological disorder that has garnered increasing attention due to its unique characteris -tics  and  significant  impact  on  individuals'  emotional  and psychological well-being. Defined as an intense emotional reaction to specific sounds produced by others, such as oral or nasal noises, misophonia triggers pronounced responses to seemingly innocuous sounds like chewing, pen clicking, and dripping water [ 2].

The concept of misophonia was first introduced by Jas -treboff and Jastreboff, highlighting the growing recognition of its significance within auditory and mental health disci -plines  [ 7 ].  In  2013, Amsterdam  University  Medical  Cen -ter  (Amsterdam  UMC)  formulated  diagnostic  criteria  for misophonia as a psychiatric disorder [ 7 ]. 'Misophonia is a disorder of decreased tolerance to specific sounds or stim -uli  associated  with  such  sounds. These  stimuli,  known  as 'triggers,' are experienced as unpleasant or distressing and tend to evoke strong negative emotional, physiological, and behavioral responses that are not seen in most other people. Misophonic responses are not  elicited  by  the  loudness  of auditory stimuli but rather by the specific pattern or mean -ing to an individual' (Consensus definition of Misophonia) [ 13].

The trajectory of misophonia involves a series of emo -tional stages, from unease triggered by the mere anticipation of  sound to escalating feelings of disgust and anger. This progression often leads to losing self-control, significantly impacting  functionality  and  well-being  [ 6 ].  To  assess  the severity of misophonia, the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale

(A-MISO-S) was developed, serving as a valuable instru -ment in gauging the extent of this disorder [ 7].

Despite  the  growing  awareness  of  misophonia,  there remains a dearth of research regarding its prevalence and underlying  mechanisms.  Existing  studies  primarily  focus on retrospective reports from adults, overlooking the ado -lescent population, even though the age of onset often cor -responds to adolescence. A study by Wu analyzed 483 US university students (18-24 years), finding 20% had miso -phonia [8]. Zhou studied 415 university students in China, revealing a 27.1% prevalence [ 10 ]. Another study assessed 336 Dutch students (mean age: 18.9 ± 2.4) with A-MISO-S, identifying a 49.1% prevalence [ 10 ]. Indian studies by Patel et al. [9] and Aryal et al. [ 3 ] reported a 15.85% to 20% prev -alence among college students (18-25 years) with moderate to severe misophonia. In the UK, 772 adults (18-50 years) took a survey including the S-Five questionnaire, estimating an 18% likelihood of misophonia [15 ].

This study aims to fill this research gap by investigating the prevalence, gender differences, and severity of misopho -nia in high school students in India. Given the limited infor -mation  on  prevalence  of  misophonia  in  adolescents,  this research endeavors to shed light on the unique challenges high school students face in India. By employing methodol -ogies such as surveys and established assessment tools, the study intends to contribute valuable insights into the mental well-being of this demographic, potentially informing early identification and intervention strategies.

## Method

The number of participants included in the study was 597 high  school  students  with  diverse  backgrounds.  Among 597 students, the number of female students was 269, the mean age was 15 years, the SD = 5, the mean was 15.12, and the male students were 328. The age range of participants was 14 to 16 years. The participants did not have any his -tory or signs and symptoms of psychological or otological problems; neither were under medications. The Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ) by Dr. Marsha Johnson, revised  by Tom Dozier, 2013 was administered to all the participants.  Every  student  was  provided  with  a  copy  of the  questionnaire.  They  were  instructed  to  read  questions

carefully and mark their answers (frequency of problems) in boxes labeled 0,1,2 and 3.

The  MAQ  questionnaire  has  21  questions,  with  four descriptive options corresponding to the score (0 = not at all, 1 = a little of the time, 2 = a good deal of the time, 3 = almost all the time). The questionnaire was self-administered with the  assistance  of  parents  or  caregivers.  Responses  were analyzed, and the participants were grouped based on their scores  as  Sub-clinical  (score &lt; 10), Mild  (score  11-21), Moderate  (22-42),  or  Severe  (43-63).  These  questions examine emotional and behavioral reactions towards sensi -tive sounds. They elicit information about the effects of their sound issues in their daily life or everyday situations. The total scores were calculated, and the severity of misophonia was assigned accordingly. Individuals with mild misopho -nia  were  considered  at  risk  for  developing  its  symptoms, and individuals with moderate and above degrees were con -sidered as individuals with misophonia.

## Results

The  findings  of  the  study  revealed  a  notable  prevalence of misophonia among high school students, with approxi -mately 34.67% of the participants exhibiting symptoms of this disorder. This statistic underscores the substantial pres -ence of misophonia within the high school student popula -tion, indicating that the condition is indeed highly prevalent in India. When examining the severity of misophonia across different degrees, it became evident that many participants were affected. Specifically, 52.65% of the students demon -strated a Mild degree of misophonia, signifying that a con -siderable portion of the sample experienced mild emotional reactions  to  specific  trigger  sounds. Additionally,  45.41% of the students exhibited a Moderate degree of misophonia, suggesting that their emotional responses to trigger sounds were more pronounced and distressing. Intriguingly, a small yet noteworthy minority of 1.93% of the students displayed a  Severe  degree  of  misophonia,  indicating  that  they  were significantly impacted by the emotional and physiological responses elicited by trigger sounds to the extent that could potentially disrupt their daily functioning. The examination of  gender  differences  in  misophonia  prevalence  yielded  a notable observation. There was no discernible gender dis -tinction in the prevalence of the disorder among the stud -ied high school students. The results of the prevalence of misophonia across severity for males, females, and total are shown in Table 1.

## Discussion

A  parallel  investigation  conducted  among  college-going students in India offers insightful comparisons to the present study's findings. In that particular study, it was ascertained that the prevalence of misophonia among college students was  approximately  15.85%,  with  a  notable  manifestation of moderate to severe levels of the disorder [ 3 ]. Compared with the current research, a discernible pattern emerges: the prevalence  of  misophonia  is  notably  higher  among  high school  students  compared  to  their  college  counterparts  in India.

This divergence in prevalence rates could be attributed to a combination of psychosocial and developmental factors unique to the adolescent phase. Adolescents, in particular, undergo  a  multitude  of  physiological,  psychological,  and emotional changes as they transition from childhood to adult -hood [ 11 ]. This phase is characterized by heightened emo -tional sensitivity, identity formation, and the establishment of social relationships [ 1 ]. This divergence can be attributed to the myriad transformations that students undergo during their  adolescent  phase,  coupled  with  their  limited  control over their psychological well-being. These factors contrib -ute  to  the  persistence  of  symptoms  or  even  an  escalation in the severity of misophonia. Students become particularly susceptible within this period of their lives, rendering them more predisposed to various disorders.The inherent vulner -ability and limited emotional regulation mechanisms during this period can amplify emotional responses, such as those triggered by misophonic sounds [14 ].

Moreover, the transitional nature of adolescence encom -passes  a  range  of  psychosocial  challenges,  including  aca -demic stress, peer pressure, and increased responsibilities, which collectively contribute to an augmented susceptibility to psychological disorders [4 , 5]. Within this developmental juncture, individuals might be more predisposed to various disorders, including misophonia. The pronounced impact of misophonia during adolescence could potentially be exac -erbated  by  the  challenges  of  self-identity  and  self-esteem formation,  alongside  the  heightened  emotional  reactivity inherent to this stage [ 1, 12].

## Conclusions

This study contributes to the growing body of research dedi -cated to uncovering the nuances of misophonia. By shed -ding light on its prevalence and severity among high school students  in  India,  it  invites  a  broader  conversation  about this  condition's emotional and psychological toll during a pivotal phase of life. This phenomenon can be attributed to the transformative nature of adolescence, characterized by heightened  emotional  responsiveness  and  a  susceptibility to  various  psychological  challenges.  Understanding  these underlying dynamics can facilitate the development of tar -geted intervention strategies to mitigate the effects of miso -phonia during this critical period of development. Moving forward, a more comprehensive approach to understanding misophonia's impact on diverse populations will enable us to develop more effective strategies for early identification, intervention,  and,  ultimately,  improved  quality  of  life  for those coping with this disorder.
