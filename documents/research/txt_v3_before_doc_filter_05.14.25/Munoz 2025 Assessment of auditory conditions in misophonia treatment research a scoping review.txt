ABSTRACT 
Objective: To identify treatment research that used a behavioural approach to treat misophonia as the 
primary focus of treatment, and the audiological testing included in the research.
Design: Scoping literature review completed in February 2023 and updated in March 2024.
Study Sample: Included studies that provided a behavioural or audiological intervention for misophonia, 
were peer-reviewed, and published in English before February 29, 2024. Studies were excluded if a 
pharmacological treatment was provided, if misophonia was not the primary treatment target, or if the 
assessment of misophonia severity was not a treatment outcome.
Results: Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Six studies had paediatric participants and nine had 
adult participants. Three studies included the identification of audiological comorbidities including hear -
ing ability, hyperacusis, and/or tinnitus in their assessment process. Nine of the studies included assess -
ment for psychological comorbidities. For the different psychological treatment approaches, misophonia 
severity scores decreased from baseline from 19% to 83%.
Conclusions: There is a need for misophonia research to identify audiological comorbidities and to pro-
vide evidence-based guidance for addressing them within treatment. Symptoms often appear during 
childhood and individuals with misophonia would benefit from timely assessment and interdisciplinary 
coordination to address broader patient impacts in the treatment process.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
Misophonia is a sound tolerance disorder characterised by an 
intense emotional reaction (e.g. anger, irritation, disgust) to spe-
cific sounds that trigger their reaction, including repetitive 
sounds such as eating, breathing, and tapping (Swedo et al. 
2022 ). This condition was first described by audiologist Marsha 
Johnson in 1990 (Bernstein, Angell, and Dehle 2013 ), and in 
2001 the term misophonia was introduced (Jastreboff and 
Jastreboff 2002 ). Research on underlying mechanisms influencing 
misophonia is evolving, and early models are emerging to 
explain the pathway for activation of the distressing emotional 
response. Recently a social cognitive model was proposed based 
on neuroimaging studies and the social context of the perceived 
sound source and the role this plays in the strength of the 
response to the trigger (Berger, Gander, and Kumar 2024 ). 
Notably, individuals with misophonia often have hearing thresh -
olds within normal limits (Jager et al. 2020a ) and objective tests 
of the auditory system have been found to exhibit no differences 
between individuals with and without misophonia (e.g. Aryal 
and Prabhu 2023a ; Suraj, Venkateswaran, and Prabhu 2024 ). 
Current and future research on the neurophysiological mecha -
nisms involved and how they are similar or different among peo-
ple suffering from misophonia will inform and refine future 
approaches to treatment. A recent consensus definition of miso -
phonia (Swedo et al. 2022 ) recognised that misophonia can co- exist with other conditions, including auditory, neurological or 
psychiatric conditions, and for individuals with misophonia, their 
symptoms of misophonia should not be better explained by a co- 
morbid condition.
Identification of co-morbid conditions represents an impor -
tant step in providing individuals seeking treatment with coordi -
nated and comprehensive care, suggesting a need for an 
interdisciplinary approach for assessment and treatment plan -
ning. Psychological comorbidities include disorders such as 
depression, anxiety, (Ferrer-Torres and Gim�enez-Llort 2022 ) 
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (Rouw and Erfanian 
2018 ), as well as other psychiatric disorders. Auditory comorbid -
ities have been found with tinnitus and hyperacusis (Jastreboff 
and Jastreboff 2015 ); however, findings vary among studies, rais-
ing questions about the prevalence of auditory co-morbidities 
and how they impact an individual’s experience with misopho -
nia, that are not yet clearly defined. For example, hyperacusis 
can be measured by self-report questionnaires and by measure -
ment of loudness discomfort level (LDL) for discrete tones. A 
recent study that compared LDLs among three groups (i.e. miso -
phonia, auditory over-responsivity, and health controls) found 
no statistically significant differences in LDLs among the groups 
(Siepsiak et al. 2022 ). Yet in another study of individuals with 
misophonia, 71% self-reported hyperacusis (Enzler et al. 2021 ).
Currently, there are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria 
for misophonia; however, it is commonly assessed using

questionnaires and/or a structured interview process developed 
to determine severity of and response to trigger sounds. People 
seeking help for coping with their symptoms typically seek out 
services from audiology, psychology, and psychiatry. The preva -
lence of clinically significant misophonia is unclear for children 
and adults. A recent study found 20% of college students experi -
enced distress from misophonia (Brennan et al. 2024 ) and a 
population-based sample in Germany aged 16 and older found 
34% reported misophonic sound sensitivities (Pfeiffer, Allroggen, 
and Sachser 2025 ). Misophonia typically emerges in childhood 
and impairment often continues in adulthood (Jager et al. 
2020a ). While the cause of misophonia is not yet known, the 
impact on daily life is significant and can lead to maladaptive 
ways of coping including social isolation (Brout et al. 2018 ).
To address the impacts of misophonia and help people man -
age their response to trigger sounds different approaches have 
been used, including psychological and pharmacological inter -
ventions (Mattson et al. 2023 ), tinnitus retraining therapy 
(Jastreboff and Jastreboff 2015 ), and technology to mask trigger 
sounds (Bernstein, Angell, and Dehle 2013 ; Zitelli 2021 ). In a 
recent systematic review with misophonia as the primary or sec-
ondary focus of psychological and/or pharmacological treatment 
(Mattson et al. 2023 ) the authors concluded that while the inter -
ventions showed potential, there currently is no clear treatment 
recommendation for misophonia. Furthermore, the authors 
established that there was a lack of rigour and comparative stud -
ies in the research, as well as limitations with sample size and 
replication. One of the treatment studies used tinnitus retraining 
therapy and identified 28% of their sample with hyperacusis 
(Jastreboff and Jastreboff 2014 ). Research does not yet have a 
clear answer for how co-morbid auditory disorders influence the 
treatment process. The current scoping review extends on the 
Mattson et al. (2023 ) study by identifying the status of assess -
ment of auditory conditions in misophonia treatment research to 
provide additional context.
Therefore, the purpose of this scoping review was to identify 
and describe treatment research that used a behavioural 
approach to treat misophonia as the primary focus of treatment, 
and the auditory conditions assessed for in the research. This 
scoping review contributes to the literature by providing infor -
mation on gaps that exist in assessing for co-morbid auditory 
conditions in misophonia treatment research for paediatric and 
adult populations. This information can help guide interdiscipli -
nary collaboration between behavioural/psychological and audio -
logical fields.
Methods
The design for this study was a scoping literature review. 
Scoping reviews identify key concepts and research gaps using a 
systematic process.
Eligibility criteria
A scoping literature review was completed in February 2023 and 
updated in March 2024 following guidance from the Joanna 
Briggs Institute (Peters et al. 2022 ). To be included, the studies 
were in peer-reviewed publications, provided behavioural or 
audiological intervention for misophonia, and were published in 
English before February 29, 2024. Studies were excluded if a 
pharmacological treatment was provided, if misophonia was not 
the primary treatment target, or if insufficient data were pro-
vided on misophonia treatment outcomes (e.g. outcomes were not measured post-treatment, a misophonia severity measure was 
not used).
Search strategy
To identify potentially relevant articles, three databases were 
searched (MEDLINE, CINAHAL Complete and PsycINFO all via 
EBSCOhost) using the following keywords: 1. (misophonia OR 
sound-tolerance); 2. (intervention OR treatment OR hearing OR 
audiol�). An overarching search string was created that incorpo -
rated the keywords for the database (see Appendix A for search 
queries).
Data extraction
Three authors (DV, MH, and DO) developed a data charting 
form prior to completing the literature search. The articles were 
screened for inclusion independently by two authors (DV, MH). 
First, a title and abstract screening was conducted. The authors 
met to discuss and resolve any discrepancies in selected articles. 
In the event of disagreement over inclusion, a third author (DO) 
reviewed the article in question. Second, a full text screening was 
completed (DV, MH), and reference lists of included articles 
were reviewed (DV, MH) to identify additional articles for con-
sideration. Third, two authors (KM, DV) independently reviewed 
articles using Joanna Briggs methodological quality checklists 
that were available for the study designs (Gagnier et al. 2013 ; 
Munn et al. 2020 ; Barker et al. 2023 ).
Analysis
Study details were extracted and entered in an Excel spreadsheet 
(i.e. publication date, first author, study design, participant infor -
mation, outcome measure(s), treatment information, and audio -
logical tests). The articles were divided into two groups to show 
the status of assessing for auditory conditions based on partici -
pant age (i.e. paediatric [under 18years] and adult [18years and 
older]) and narratively synthesised.
Results
The database search identified 934 articles after duplicates were 
removed. Title and abstract screening excluded 885, one article 
could not be accessed, and 34 were excluded during full-text 
screening. One article was identified from the reference list 
review; a total of 15 articles met the eligibility criteria for inclu -
sion (see Figure 1for the PRISMA [Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic reviews and Meat-Analyses] flowsheet). Six studies 
had paediatric participants (Table 1) and nine had adult partici -
pants (Table 2).
Paediatric
The six studies with paediatric participants were case reports. 
The children and adolescents ranged in age from 10 to 17years. 
Misophonia onset reported in five of the studies was from 
approximately age 5 to 11years. The Amsterdam Misophonia 
Scale (AMISO-S) and/or the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ) 
were used to measure severity. All the studies provided psycho -
logical interventions and decreases in severity were found post- 
treatment. Psychological comorbidities were assessed for in all 2

six of the studies. Only one study assessed for audiological 
comorbidities; hyperacusis was included using the Hyperacusis 
Questionnaire (Khalfa et al. 2002 ) and no evidence of hyperacu -
sis was identified (Cecilione, Hitti, and Vrana 2022 ).Three case studies used a mindfulness and acceptance-based 
approach, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and 
Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) (Schneider and Arch 
2017 ; Zarotti, Tuthill, and Fisher 2022 ; Petersen and Twohig

2023 ). Two studies provided online treatment (Zarotti, Tuthill, 
and Fisher 2022 ; Petersen and Twohig 2023 ). Three case studies 
used Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) (McGuire, Wu and 
Storch 2015 ; Cecilione, Hitti, and Vrana 2022 ; Dover and 
McGuire 2023 ). One study used a family-based approach and 
found family accommodations decreased by 75% from a high 
level of accommodation at pre-treatment (Dover and McGuire 
2023 ). One study measured treatment gains beyond post- 
treatment and improvements were maintained at six months 
(Schneider and Arch 2017 ).
Adult
The nine studies with adult participants used various research 
designs and different measures were used to assess severity, 
including AMISO-S, MQ, Amsterdam Misophonia Scale – 
Revised (AMISO-R), Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire 
(MAQ), and/or Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Study 
(SFive), and some also used Clinical Global Impressions 
Improvement (CGI-I). Psychological comorbidities were assessed 
for in three studies and other medical comorbidities (i.e. 
migraine, irritable bowel, hyperthyroidism) were reported in one 
study. Two studies assessed for audiological comorbidities. 
Vanaja and Abigail (2020 ) used a retraining treatment and 
assessed hearing ability and findings were within normal limits 
with no evidence of hyperacusis based on measurement of loud -
ness discomfort levels, although there was a previous diagnosis 
of hyperacusis by another clinic. Jager et al. (2020b ) used a CBT 
treatment and self-report to assess hearing ability, tinnitus, and 
hyperacusis; three participants had previously been diagnosed 
with tinnitus and no other hearing problems were reported.
Open trial and randomized controlled trial (RCT)
The open trial (Schr oder et al. 2017 ) and the RCT (Jager et al. 
2020b ) excluded individuals with significant comorbid condi -
tions. The age of misophonia onset was 12.5 years (SD 4.8) in 
the open trial, and was not reported in the RCT. At the end of 
treatment for the open trail, 48% met the criteria for response to 
treatment, defined as a 30% or greater reduction on the AMISO- 
S and a score of 1 or 2 (very much improved; much improved) on the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement (CGI-I); no fol-
low-up assessment was completed. For the RCT, the AMISO-R 
showed a large effect size (d1.97) in the treatment group com -
pared to the wait list for the decrease in misophonia severity, 
and on the CGI-I, 37% of the treatment showed a clinical 
response for misophonia, compared to 0% in the wait list group, 
and these improvements maintained at the one-year follow-up.
Single subject design
This study used a multiple baseline design across trigger stimuli 
(Dozier 2015a ). The participant experienced triggers from both 
auditory and visual stimuli for their misophonia and reported 
misophonia onset at age seven. The treatment was behavioural 
counterconditioning, a technique used for Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorder (PTSD) and was delivered remotely. Misophonia sever -
ity decreased from a moderate to a mild level for auditory trig-
gers based on the Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire 
(MAQ). This case treated single triggers in one context, and it is 
not clear if the treatment would be as effective if multiple trig-
gers were present or if they occurred in different contexts.
Case series
In the study conducted by Jager et al. (2021 ), seven participants 
completed the treatment. The mean age of onset was 13years 
(SD 9.75), and individuals with significant comorbid condi -
tions were excluded from participation. Participants received Eye 
Movement Desensitisation & Reprocessing Therapy (EMDR), 
which focused on misophonia memories that were emotionally 
disturbing. Number of sessions varied by the number of target 
memories for the person and ranged from one to four sessions. 
Two participants (28%) met the criteria for a full response to 
treatment, defined as a 25% or more reduction measured by the 
AMISOS-R and a CGI-I score of less than three. In the case ser-
ies conducted by Gregory, Graham, and Hayes (2024 ) 19 con-
secutive cases were retrospectively reviewed for patients who 
completed CBT treatment. Session length and treatment compo -
nents varied, and age of onset was not reported. The MQ and 
AMISO-S both had a large effect size for pre-treatment to fol-
low-up changes, with Cohen’s d of 1.63 and 1.55 respectively. 
Reliable improvement on the MQ was found for 78% of the Table 2. Adult misophonia treatment studies.

participants, and 61% were deemed to have clinically significant 
changes.
Case reports
Three different approaches to treatment were used, including 
retraining therapy with desensitisation and habituation (Vanaja 
and Abigail 2020 ), CBT (Altın oz, Unal, and Tosun Altın oz 2018 ; 
Gregory and Foster 2023 ), and counterconditioning (Neural 
Repatterning Technique [NRT]) with treatments conducted inde -
pendently using a smart phone app plus four sessions with the 
therapist (Dozier 2015b ). The smart phone app treatment was 
developed based on a previous study by the same author (Dozier 
2015a ). Age of onset ranged from approximately six to 24years. 
All cases reported decreased misophonia severity after treatment. 
One decreased from a severe to a mild level on the AMISO-S 
with results that maintained at three months follow-up (Vanaja 
and Abigail 2020 ). Another decreased from a moderate to a sub- 
clinical level at post-treatment (no follow-up assessment com -
pleted) on the AMISO-S (Altın oz, Unal, and Tosun Altın oz 
2018 ). In another, auditory triggers decreased from a severe to a 
mild level (visual triggers remained) on the MAQ and gains 
were maintained at the 12-month follow-up (Dozier 2015b ). 
Gregory and Foster (2023 ) used the SFive to measure outcomes 
and described meaningful changes from one session to the next, 
and found scores decreased 83% from “significantly burdensome 
symptoms” at pre-treatment.
Discussion
The purpose of this scoping review was to identify and describe 
treatment research that used a behavioural approach to treat 
misophonia as the primary focus of treatment, and the audio -
logical testing included in the research. Only three studies 
assessed for auditory conditions. One case report with an adult 
participant completed an audiological test battery finding pure 
tone thresholds within normal limits, excellent word recognition 
in quiet, and a determination of no hyperacusis (Vanaja and 
Abigail 2020 ). One case report with a paediatric participant 
assessed for hyperacusis with a negative finding (Cecilione, Hitti, 
and Vrana 2022 ). One randomized clinical trial (Jager et al. 
2020b ) completed auditory assessments but did not incorporate 
the auditory findings in the treatment process. How auditory co- 
morbid conditions should be considered within misophonia 
treatment research is unknown. The gap in research represents 
an opportunity to expand the understanding of auditory co-mor -
bidities in future misophonia treatment research.
The misophonia treatment research to date is limited. Two- 
thirds of the studies in this review were case reports. The retro -
spective nature of describing a single case has risk of bias from 
focusing on a single unusual case or outcome. It is not possible 
to determine a cause-effect relationship from the treatment and 
the results cannot be generalised to others. There was one RCT 
and outcomes were compared to individuals on a waiting list (no 
treatment) and evaluator bias may have influenced the clinical 
interview because they were aware of the treatment condition. 
Future studies are needed that include (a) independent evalua -
tors, (b) an active control group to identify treatment factors 
associated with symptom reduction, including treatment type, 
duration, and delivery considerations, (c) identification of 
comorbid conditions (e.g. psychological and audiological), (d) 
inclusion of audiological testing and description of parameters 
used to define and characterise auditory considerations, and (e) and more research with children and adolescents to inform prac -
tice protocols given gaps in protocol guidance for hyperacusis 
and tinnitus assessment.
Researchers have identified the need for comprehensive 
assessment that involves a team of professionals (Schr oder et al. 
2017 ; Palumbo et al. 2018 , Ferrer-Torres and Gim�enez-Llort 
2022 ), including audiologists (Aryal and Prabhu 2023b ). 
Identification of comorbid conditions is needed to understand 
the issues influencing an individual’s experience with misophonia 
and to inform treatment planning. Aryal and Prabhu (2023b ) 
recommended including objective hearing assessment measures 
to support the evaluation and treatment process along with the 
subjective measures used to determine misophonia severity. 
Studies have reported co-occurrence of tinnitus and hyperacusis 
with misophonia (Siepsiak and Dragan 2019 ; Brennan et al. 
2024 ), and Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2015 ) recommend treating 
hyperacusis first when it is present. There is a need to under -
stand the complex relationships among auditory conditions and 
misophonia and to determine how they influence treatment. For 
example, in a sample of children with auditory processing disor -
ders, 13% also had misophonia and these children were more 
likely to also have hyperacusis and/or tinnitus (Ahmmed and 
Vijayakumar 2024 ). There are critical practice implications 
related to the age of misophonia onset, timely initiation of treat -
ment, and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration.
Although there is limited treatment research, the studies to 
date support the importance of timely assessment and manage -
ment of misophonia. Most of the participants in this review 
reported childhood onset, as young as five years (e.g. Petersen 
and Twohig 2023 ), underscoring the need for validated assess -
ment tools for the paediatric population. Importantly, studies 
described symptoms worsening and having additional triggers 
over time (e.g. Dozier 2015a ), increasing risk for negative conse -
quences such as isolation and emotional distress. These trends of 
childhood onset and increasing symptoms over time were also 
found in a large study of misophonia (N575; onset age 
M13.17 [SD 7.37]; Jager at al. 2020b). Family engagement 
in management can provide an important source of support as 
individuals learn effective coping strategies. One study with a 
paediatric patient used a family-based approach and family 
members learned to be adaptive rather than reactive, such as 
implementing catchphrases to help the child use coping strategies 
in daily life (Dover and McGuire 2023 ). In another study with a 
paediatric patient, the mother participated in the last ten minutes 
of each session to support homework engagement between ses-
sions (Petersen and Twohig 2023 ), and one group treatment 
study included family and friends in one psychoeducation ses-
sion (Jager et al. 2020b ).
There are important clinical implications for promoting an 
interdisciplinary approach within practice. When audiology is 
the point of entry for care, there is the risk that consideration 
for psychological comorbid conditions may be overlooked, and 
treatment may not adequately take into consideration the influ -
ence of behavioural coping mechanisms on quality of life. For 
example, a narrow focus on sound attenuation (e.g. use of ear-
plugs) to help an individual eat dinner with their family would 
limit sound tolerance and emotional adjustment to the distress 
by reinforcing avoidance of the trigger sounds (Lewin et al. 
2021 ). Determining the balance for when and how to use strat -
egies is important for longer-term management. Individuals suf-
fering from misophonia seek services from audiologists. There is 
a need for clinical protocols in audiology to guide practice. 
Furthermore, comprehensive assessment and interdisciplinary INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUDIOLOGY
 5

collaboration allow for an approach to treatment that can target 
the needs of each individual.
There are limitations to consider for the study, including the 
search focused on behaviour interventions provided for misopho -
nia as the primary concern. Other research that treated misopho -
nia as a secondary concern with another condition was not 
reviewed. This could have limited our understanding of how 
auditory co-morbidities have been considered in treatment 
research. Furthermore, only studies published in English were 
reviewed.
Conclusion
Misophonia treatment research is limited; however, the early 
research is promising and demonstrates people suffering from 
misophonia can experience improvement with treatment. There 
is an urgent need for research to identify treatment factors asso-
ciated with symptom reduction to provide evidence-based guid -
ance for evaluating and treating misophonia. Individuals with 
misophonia can have co-occurring conditions that would benefit 
from interdisciplinary coordination to address broader patient 
impacts in the treatment process.
