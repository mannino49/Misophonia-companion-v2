Abstract  
 
We examined differences in physiological responses to aversive and non -aversive naturalistic 
audiovisual stimuli and their auditory and visual components within the same experiment. We 
recorded five physiological measures that have been shown to be sensitive to affect : 
electrocardiogram,  electromyography  (EMG)  for zygomaticus major and corrugator supercilii  
muscles, electroder mal activity  (EDA) , and skin temperature . Valence and arousal ratings  
confirmed  that aversive stimuli were more negative in valence and higher in arousal than non -Journal Pre-proof

aversive  stimuli . Valence also show ed an emotional enhancement effect for cross -modal 
integration.  Both h eart rate deceleration  and facial EMG potentiation  for corrugator supercilii 
were larger for aversive compared to non -aversive conditions for audiovisual stimuli  and their 
auditory component s, even after controlling for arousal . Facial EMG potentiation for 
zygomaticus major was greater for aversive compared to non -aversive  conditions for audiovisual 
stimuli  and EDA was greater for aversive compared to non -aversive conditions for visual stimuli. 
Neither of these effects remained significant after controlling for arousal.  These findings provide 
a benchmark  for examining atypical sensory processing of mundane aversive stimuli for clinical 
populations .

Introduction  
 
Sights and sounds we encounter in our daily lives significantly influence our emotion s, 
behavior, and interactions with the world around us.  For instance, the harsh noise of a chair 
scraping across the floor can trigger unpleasant feelings, while the gentl e crackle of a fire brings 
about positive responses. These emotional reactions can be defined by two dimensions: valence, 
an intrinsic aversiveness or attractiveness of a stimulus which spans from negative to positive, 
and arousal, an intensity of the emot ional response, which ranges  from  low to high  (Russell, 
2003) . These two core affect ive dimensions  partially  reflect  appetitive and defensive Journal Pre-proof

3 
motivational circuits , with valence generally  indicating either defensive or appetitive motivation 
and arousal indicating the degree of motivational activation  (Bradley et al., 2001; Carver & 
Harmon -Jones, 2009) . Affective signals are inherently multimodal, allowing us to experience  
emotions in richer, mo re nuanced ways.  The interplay between auditory and visual  modalities 
can influence the affective response. For instance, harsh sounds can amplify feelings of 
discomfort, regardless of the accompanying visual, such as  simultaneously hearing and seeing a 
chair scraping across the floor. This study aims to explore the physiological correlates of 
affective signals associated with naturalistic audiovisual clips and their auditory and visual 
components, which we will refer to as the three modalities: audiovi sual, auditory, and visual.    
Fluctuations in affective states are accompanied by changes in sympathetic and 
parasympathetic systems reflected in physiological responses.  Heart rate (HR) has been 
associated with both valence and arousal. It has been shown that initial heart rate deceleration 
was sensitive to various aversive stimuli, such as pictures  (Lang et al, 1993; Bradley et al., 2001; 
Gomez et al., 2016) , sounds  (Bradley & Lang, 2000; Coutinho & Cangelosi, 2011) , films 
(Baldaro et al., 2004; Bradley et al., 2001; Palomba et al., 2000)  and aversive environments 
designed to elicit fear and pain  (Vowles et al., 2006) . Facial electrom yography ( EMG ) measured 
over the brow (corrugator supercilii ) has been shown to increase with negative  valence for 
picture  (Cacioppo et al., 1986; Greenwald et al., 1989; Kim & Wedell, 2016; Lang et al., 1993; 
Larsen et al., 2003 ; Tan et al., 201 2), sound (Bradley & Lang, 2000; Jäncke et al., 1996;  Kim et 
al., 2019; Larsen et al., 2003) , word (Larsen et al., 2003)  and film (Sato et al., 2020; Sato & 
Kochiyama, 2022)  stimuli . EMG over the cheek (zygomaticus major ) has been shown to increase 
with intensity of both positive  and negative valence  (Bernat et al., 2006; Bradley & Lang, 2000; 
Codispoti et al., 2008; Dellacherie et al., 2011; Grewe et al., 2007; Lang et al., 1993; Larsen et Journal Pre-proof

al., 2003) . The relationship between facial EMG and arousal ratings has not received much 
attention . One study identified a positive relationship with zygomaticus major potentiation , but 
not for corrugator supercilii potentiation for videos (Gjoreski et al., 2022) , while  another  study 
found no relationship  with arousal  for picture  stimuli  (Tan et al., 2012) . Heightened 
electrodermal  activity ( EDA ) has been shown to be sensitive to emotionally arousing picture  
(Amrhein et al., 2004; Bradley & Lang, 2000; Bradley et al., 2001 ; Kim & Wedell, 2016; Lang 
et al., 1993) , sound  (Bradley & Lang, 2000; Greco et al., 2017) , and film (Sato et al., 2020; Sato 
& Kochiyama, 2022)  stimuli . Decreased nose-tip skin temperature ( SKT ) has been associated 
with increased arousal for picture (Salazar -López et al., 2015)  and film stimuli (Sato et al., 2020; 
Sato & Kochiyama, 2022) . Thus, auditory and visual affective stimuli have both been shown to 
elicit physiological responses that can be measured using vari ous physiological channel s 
(Bradley & Lang, 2000; Lang & Bradley, 2010) . 
Most of the aforementioned  studies included erotic or comed ic (Amrhein et al., 2004; 
Bradley et al., 2001; Gomez et al., 2016; Salazar -López et al., 2015; Sato & Kochiyama, 2022) , 
gore or accident -related  (Amrhein et al., 2004; Bradley et al., 2001; Gjoreski et al., 2022; Gomez 
et al., 2016; Larsen et al., 2003; Salazar -López et al ., 2015; Tan et al., 2012)  stimuli  that tend to 
elicit strong affective responses . Although stimuli rated high in affect  may result in stronger 
physiological reactions , these stimuli are not suitable for clinical applications such as  examining 
sensory sensitivity in children  with autism . The degree to which  affective states elicited by less 
extreme stimuli  that one may encounter in daily life will be reflected in  physiological responses  
is unclear  and would be informative to research ers focused on sensory sensitivity . 
In the natural environment , auditory and visual affective signals tend to co -occur  (De 
Gelder & Bertelson, 2003) . Indirect evidence from valence and arousal  ratings and event-related Journal Pre-proof

potenti als has suggested that there is an enhancement effect , where affective signals  presented 
from multi ple modalit ies elicit more extreme affective responses  than either source presented 
alone  (Gao et al., 2018a, Gao et al., 2018b) . However, m ost physiological studies have focused 
on one of the  two modalities  in isolation , with a few notable exceptions . Rosa et al. (2017)  used 
International Affective Picture System ( IAPS ) images, International Affective Digital Sounds 
(IADS ), and their combinations within the same experiment in a between -participant design to 
examine EDA differences in valence. Baumgartner et al. (2006)  used classical music, IAPS 
images , and a combination of the two in the same experi ment  to examine differences in HR, 
EDA and SKT for happiness, sadness , and fear . They reported increased physiological activity 
for audiovisual and audio stimuli compared to the picture stimuli . In both experiments that 
examined multimodal differences , the audiovisual combination was created by combining static 
images with sounds or music  from different sources that were congruent on affect . In a small 
group design , Edelstein et al. (2013)  separated the auditory and visual components of vid eo clips 
that would elicit emotionally varying responses  in participants with  and without  misophonia , a 
condition of heightened sensitivity to  specific sounds . They compared the skin conductanc e 
response and aversiveness ratings  between the  two groups  but did not focus on the modality 
effect . Thus, physiological responses to  audiov isual stimuli  and their auditory and visual 
components  from the same source have not  yet been examined  in a non-clinical p opulation . Our 
experiment builds on this literature  and fills this gap . 
In the present study , we examine d differences in physiological responses to aversive  
(negative  valence , higher arousal ) and non -aversive  (positive valence , lower arousal ) naturalistic 
audiovisual stimuli that one may encounter in daily life and their auditory and visual  components 
within the same experiment . These conditions differ on arousal , as aversive  stimuli  tend to be Journal Pre-proof

more arousing (Garrett & Maddock, 2001; Kuppens et al., 2013; Nitschke et al., 2006) . 
Understanding physiological respons es to innocuous aversive stimuli is important for 
investigating atypical sensory processing in clinical populations, such as those with Autism 
Spectrum Disorder (Jung et al., 2021) , hyperacusis  (Singh & Seidman, 2019) , a condition where 
ordinary sounds are perceived as excessively loud or painful , and misophonia (Swedo  et al., 
2022) , a condition characterized by aberrant emotional response to certain sounds . This study 
makes two important contributions. First, it  examines physiological responses to  aversive and 
non-aversive  audiovisual clips and their auditory and visual components within the same study. 
Second, it uses stimuli that may be encountered in everyday life that hold relevan ce for clinical 
applications. We record ed five physiological measures  that have been shown to be sensitive to 
affect : electrocardiogr am (ECG), EMG for zygomaticus major and corrugator supercili i muscles, 
EDA, and SKT  and investigat ed how they change as a function of aversiveness for audiovisual 
stimuli  and their auditory and visual components . We formulated four hypotheses. First,  we 
hypothesized that since facial EMG measures have been  shown to be sensitive  to valence, they 
should be sensitive to aversive ness. The EMG signals would be higher for aversive compared to 
non-aversive stimuli  (Bradley & Lang, 2000; Lang et al., 1993; Larsen et al. , 2003) , although 
mixed results have been shown for EMG Z (Bernat et al., 2006; Codispoti et al., 2008) . Second, 
we expected HR deceleration to be greater and EDA to be higher for the aversive condition. 
Negative high -arousal stimuli typically elicit larger deceleration of HR (Bradley et al., 2001) and 
larger EDA responses (Bradley & Lang, 2006; Bradley et al., 2001; Bradley & Lang, 2000)  as do 
losses versus gains in choice experiments (Crone et al., 2004; Hayes & Wedell, 2020) . Third , the 
heightened response to aversive stimuli would occur  for all three modalities . Fourth , the 
physiological and self-report sensitivity to avers iveness should be greatest in the audiovisual Journal Pre-proof

(Gao et al., 2018a, Gao et al., 2018b) . 
 
Method  
 
Participants  
Physiological data were collected from 75 participants ( Mage = 20.21 years, SDage = 2.27 
years , Range age = 18-31 years ; 60 Females, 15 Males ; 71 right -handed, 3 left-handed , 1 
ambidextrous ) in exchange for a course credit at the University of South Carolina. Data from 73 
participants ( Mage = 20.2 6 years, SDage = 2.2 8 years, Range age = 18-31 years ; 59 Females, 14 
Males;  69 right -handed, 3 left -handed, 1 ambidextrous ) were analyzed (see Data Cleaning and 
Analysis section below). All participants had normal or corrected -to-normal vision  and normal 
hearing . The study was carried out in a ccordance with the procedures and protocols approved by 
the University of South Carolina Institutional Review Board  (Pro00108272)  and all participants 
signed an informed consent form . Based on an a priori power analysis conducted in G *Power  
(Version 3.1.9.6; Faul et al., 2007) , a sample size of 55  participants  is required for an effect size 
of f = .2 and a power of .90  to detect an interaction of aversiveness and modality at 𝛼  = .05. 
 
Stimuli  
Stimuli were selected from an in-house database  of 5s naturalistic audiovisual recordings 
developed for studying auditory sensory sensitivity . Forty stimuli (20 aversive, 20 non -aversive) 
were selected based on aversiveness ratings  in the audiovisual modality . The c lip content was 
similar to what one might encounter in daily  life, featuring videos and sounds like  a squeaky Journal Pre-proof

chair rolling  across the floor for an aversive clip, and the soothing crackle of a fire for a non-
aversive clip  (Appendix A) . Each  audiovisual clip w as separated  into auditory and visual 
components, resulting in corresponding audio -only and video -only stimuli.  The audio track of 
audio and audiovisual stimuli was normalized to a uniform loudness level of –16 Loudness Unit 
Full Scale. Further, aversiveness rating s of auditory and visual components w ere validated across 
two online  experiments1. 
 
Procedure  
 Upon arrival , each participant was seated at the computer, familiarized with the study and 
valence -arousal grid to rate stimuli. Participants were asked to attend to the stimuli during the 
stimulus presentation and rate each stimulus when the grid appeared on the screen in terms of 
valence (varying from negative to positive) and arousal (varying from low to high).  Instructions 
were  both shown on the screen  and verbalized by a researcher with the prompt : “You will be 
presented with either videos with sounds, videos without sounds,  or sounds without videos. Rate 
valence and arousal for each stimulus on the 9 x 9 grid. Valence : how negative or positive. 
Arousal : how calm or excited. ” An experimenter attached the electrodes and calibrated the 
physiological signal connec tions. Following the preparation phase, participants were asked to sit 
still and rest for five minutes, during which the physiological signals could stabilize.  To 
                                                      
1 The validation experiments  were conducted on a separate set of  49 participants ( Mage = 20.10 years, SD age = 1.28 
years; 40 Females, 9 Males). In these validation experiments, the p articipants rated each audio -only and video -only 
stimulus  on valence, ranging from negative ( -4) to positive (4), arousal, ranging from low (1) to high (9), 
aversiveness, ranging from very aversive ( -9) to very pleasant (+9), a nd content recognition, either Yes or No. All 
stimuli were recognized by at least 90% of the participants. The aversiveness ratings were significantly higher for 
aversive ( aver) than the non -aversive ( non-aver) stimuli for auditory component ( Maver – non-aver = -8.49, SD aver – non-aver = 
3.48), t(48) = -17.06, p < .001, d = 2.44, 95% CI [ -9.49, -7.49], and for the visual component ( Maver – non-aver = -7.61, 
SD aver – non-aver = 3.04), t(48) = -17.54, p < .001, d = 2.51, 95% CI [ -8.48, -6.73]. There were 120 clips in total: 20 
stimuli × 2 (aversiveness: aversive, non -aversive) × 3 (modality: audiovisual, auditory component, visual 
component) . Journal Pre-proof

familiarize the participants with the task , the experiment started with a practice session 
consisting of one stimulus from each of the three modalities that were not part of the test stimuli . 
E-Prime 3.0 software (Version 3.0.3.60 Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA) was used to 
present the stimuli and record valence and arousal rating  responses. Participants were presented 
with 5s audiovisual,  audio, and video clips  that differed on aversiveness. The experiment took 40 
minutes to complete.   
 
Design and task  
The physiology experiment used a 2 (aversiveness: aversive, non -aversive) × 3 (modality: 
audiovisual, auditory component , visual  component ) within -participant design. Each of the three 
modalities  consisted of 40 stimuli  (20 aversive, 20 non -aversive) divided into  four bl ocks, each 
compri sing ten  trials . The block order was randomized, with the restriction that blocks of the 
same modality were not presented consecutively  to avoid boredom . For each block, ten 20s non -
repeating trials (five aversive and five non -aversive) were presented in  a pseudo -randomized 
order with the constraint that no more than three trials of the same aversiveness condition  were 
presented consecutively to avoid habi tuation effects  (Fig. 1A).  
Each 20s trial began with  a fixation cross centered on a white screen jittered  for 1 -2s, 
followed by a 5s stimulus presentation. During audio trials , an audio icon was presented in the 
center of the screen  while the sound played . Following the stimulus presentation , a fixation cross 
was presented on a white screen for 10s to allow enough time for physiological signals to return 
to baseline level. Next, a 9 × 9 two -dimensional affective rating grid appeared for 3 -4s, 
depending on pre-stimulus fixation cross interval to make up 20s for each trial,  where 
participants rated the stimulus on valence (horizontal axis), varying from negative to positive, Journal Pre-proof

and arousal (vertical axis), varying from low to high  (Fig. 1B). Simultaneous collection of 
valence and arousal ratings has been developed by Russell (1989) and has been successfully used 
in prior studies (e.g., Gao et al., 2018 ; Kim et al., 2017; Lazar & Pearlman -Avnion, 2014; Scott 
Killgore, 1998) . Failure to respond within the affective rating window resulted in missing data.

Physiological Data Acquisition  
Journal Pre-proof

11 
Physiological signals were acquired with a BIOPAC MP150 system (BIOPAC Systems 
Inc., Goleta, CA, USA) and processed with AcqKnowledge 3 software (BIOPAC Systems Inc., 
Goleta, CA, USA). Five channels were recorded: ECG, EMG for corrugator supercilii and 
zygomaticus major muscles, EDA, and SKT.  Heart rate  was measured using an ECG100C 
amplifier with hypo -allergic electrode gel ( GEL100 ) applied to two disposable  electrodes  
(EL503)  placed on the frontal torso, one below the right collar bone and another one below the 
lowest left rib in the common Lead II configuration. Since concurrently measured EDA provides 
an automatic grounding, a separate ground connection for ECG was not added . EMG was 
measured using a n EMG100C amplifier with  hypo -allergic electrode gel ( GEL100 ) applied to  
two 4mm reusable Ag /AgCl electrodes  (EL65 4) for corrugator supercilii muscle potentiation 
(EMG C), other two for zygomaticus major muscle potentiation (EMG Z), and another one for 
grounding . The ground electrode was placed in the middle of the inner brows. Adhesive disks 
(ADD204) were used to attach the reusable snaps onto skin. The guideline s from Fridlund and 
Cacioppo (1989) were followed to find the appropri ate positioning of the EMG C and EMG Z 
electrodes.  EDA signal was recorded using a GSR100C amplifier with isotonic electrode paste  
(GEL101A)  applied to two disposable Ag/AgCl electrodes  (EL507A ; 16mm gel cavity diameter, 
1.5mm gel cavity depth, 11mm contact area diameter ) attached to the left hand’s medial 
phalanges of the index and middle fingers. SKT was measured using a SKT100C amplifier on 
the palm side of the thumb of the left hand to record skin temperature in Celsius ( °C). The 
sampling rate for all the  physiological measures was 1000Hz.  
 
Data P reprocessing  Journal Pre-proof

12 
The analysis  time window was 0 -7s as determined by optimizing physiological effects in 
another experiment conducted in our lab , that had the same presentatio n sequence . We kept the 
analysis window consistent across channels.  For ECG, R peaks were automatically detected 
using a QRS complex detection algorithm in AcqKnowledge 3 (BIOPAC Systems, Inc.). 
Artifacts were visually identified and manually corrected . Connect Endpoints function in 
AcqK nowledge  3 (BIOPAC Systems, Inc.) was used for correcting artifact segments and label 
was inserted or removed for any missing QRS peaks or overestimated peaks, respectively . Heart 
rate was estimated with beats per minute (BPM) during the 7s post -stimulus onset, an d baseline 
correction was conducted by subtracting mean BPM during the 1s window pre -stimulus onset 
from mean BPM during the 7s window post -stimulus onset.  
 The EMG data was  first filtered  with Band Stop f ilter configured with a line frequency 
setting at 60Hz and a Q factor of 5.0 to remove the  power  line interference , using an infinite 
impulse response. Next, Band Pass filter was applied with low -frequency cut off at 20Hz and 
high-frequency cut off at 500Hz to attenuate low -frequency motion artifacts and high-frequency 
noises, using finite impulse response. The filtered signals were  further smoothed with a 250ms 
moving window  to denoise inherent variability of muscle activity  and then rectified  by taking the 
absolute value transformation . All the processes were applied to the entire waveform.  EMG in 
response to stimulus was measured as the area under the curve (AUC) calculated for the 7s time 
window after and 1s time window before the stimulus onset. Log transformation , log10(x) , was 
then applied to both time windows to reduce the skewness of the distribution s. Baseline 
correction was conducted using the log -transformed AUC to account for participants with 
higher - or lower -than-average signal.   Journal Pre-proof

13 
For EDA, phasic EDA w as derived online from the tonic EDA with a 0.05 Hz high -pass 
filter. Both the phasic and tonic EDA were  smoothed  with a 250ms moving window  to reduce 
noise . Full wave rectification was applied to the smoothed phasic EDA . The AUC calculation,  
log transformat ion, and baseline correction were done the same way as in the EMG analysis. For 
SKT, the skin temperature was averaged across the 7s post-stimulus onset  and baseline corrected 
for the  mean of  1s pre-stimulus onset. The signals for all channels were then z-transformed 
within -participant  to allow aggregation of data accounting for individual differences.  
 
Data Cleaning and Analysis  
Self-report  data analysis and data from EDA and SKT channels  included data from 73 
participants.  The final data set for EMG Z analysis included data from 71 participants, EMG C and 
ECG analyses included data from 72 participants.  
EMG Z analysis excluded two participants because of inadequate signal acquisition due to 
facial hair interference and cheek biting. EMG C analysis exclud ed one participant because of 
signal loss. ECG analysis also excluded one participant because of signal loss.   
Signals  with movement -related artifact s (e.g., yawning ; 3.92% ) were excluded from the 
physiological data analysis . Missing responses (0.27%)  and responses under 200ms ( 3.66%) 
were excluded from the self-report  data analysis  (Whelan, 2008) . Data from two additional 
participants were excluded from both physiological and self-report data  analyses due to  a large 
number of invalid  response s (29.17% and 50.00%) . Responses  to audiovisual stimuli that were  
not manipulated  based on individuals’ ratings  (3.21%)  were excluded from both the 
physiological  and self-report  data analyses . Further, signals outside 3 SD from the mean within 
individuals were excluded from the physiological data analysis. As a result, 5.79% of EDA, Journal Pre-proof

14 
8.01% of EMG C, 10.14% of EMG Z, 6.04% of SKT,  7.16% of ECG , and 6.61% of valence  and 
arousal trials  across participants were excluded.   
A 2 (aversiveness: aversive, non -aversive) x 3 (modality: A, V, AV) repeated -measures 
ANOVA was used to analyze the data for each channel. Greenhouse -Geiser adjustment  was used 
when the sphericity assumption did  not hold  (Mauchly’s test) . The results were evaluated at 
the .05 level of statistical significance.  We report the uncorrected df and the corrected p-values 
where applicable. This was followed by planned comparisons to test the simple main effects  
assessing  signal difference to aversiveness type  within each  modality and rating . P-values for 
planned t-tests were not adjusted  for multiple comparisons.  The same analyses were conducted 
using residualized physiological signal s to assess the effects of aversiveness controlling for 
arousal. Physiological signals adjusted for arousal were first extracted by modeling the 
dependent variables from arousal ratings only. Then the residuals were used for the ANOVA. 
The results were evaluated at the .05 level of statistical significance.  
We conducted an epoch analysis to closely examine the temporal structure of 
aversiveness differences across physiological channels. We applied the same preprocessing 
pipeline to extract z -transformed data for each 1 -second epoch from the onset of stimulus 
presentation to 7 seconds after the stimulus  onset , resulting in time -series data for each trial and 
participant. We used the MNE -Python package to identify continuous temporal epochs that 
significantly differ between aversive and non -aversive conditions for  each physiological channel. 
The statistical significance of clusters was assessed using a permutation test. For each channel, 
we repeated the epoch analysis 1,000 times with shuffled physiological time series, generating a 
null distribution of 1,000 value s under the null hypothesis that no significant difference exists 
between aversive and non -aversive conditions.  Journal Pre-proof

Results  
 
Valence and Arousal Ratings  
A 2 x 3 repeated measures ANOVA was performed on affect ratings to confirm the 
experimental manipulation.  There were main effects of aversiveness, modality, and interaction 
on valence ratings. The valence ratings confirmed the experimental manipulation, with more 
negative ratings for aversive  compared to non -aversive conditions  for audiovisual ( Maver = -2.53, 
SDaver = 0.48; Mnon-aver = 2.30, SDnon-aver =  0.40), auditory ( Maver = -2.35, SDaver = 0.61, Mnon-aver 
= 1.38, SDnon-aver = 0.80), and visual ( Maver = -1.71, SDaver = 0.66; Mnon-aver = 1.68, SDnon-aver =  
0.62) modalities (Table 1, Fig. 2A, 2B). Interaction was consistent with enhancement effect in 
which valence differences for AV stimuli were greater than those for A and V components.  
There were main effects of aversiveness , modality , and interaction  on arousal ratings. 
Arousal was significantly higher for aversive compared to non -aversive conditions  for 
audiovisual ( Maver = 5.88, SDaver = 1.34; Mnon-aver = 5.16, SDnon-aver =  1.22), auditory ( Maver = 
6.07, SDaver = 1.37;  Mnon-aver = 5.24, SDnon-aver =  1.09), and visual ( Maver = 4.00, SDaver = 1.39;  
Mnon-aver = 3.52, SDnon-aver =  1.30) modalities  (Table 1, Fig. 2A, 2C). Interaction was driven by 
greater aversiveness differences for AV stimuli and A component compared to V componen t.

Heart Rate 
We examined differences in HR for aversive and non -aversive conditions  across the three 
modalities. There was an interaction effect of aversiveness and modality (Table 1). Planned 
comparison s were conducted to examine  the aversiveness effect for each modality. Consistent 
with an enhancement effect, HR was significantly lower for aversive  compared to non -aversive  
conditions  for audiovisual ( Maver = -0.04, SDaver = 0.23, Mnon-aver = 0.1 5, SDnon-aver = 0.23) and 
auditory ( Maver = 0.0 3, SDaver = 0.21, Mnon-aver = 0.1 2, SDnon-aver = 0.2 1), but not  for visual ( Maver = 
-0.08, SDaver = 0.2 1, Mnon-aver = -0.06, SDnon-aver = 0.21) modality (Table 1, Fig. 3). After multiple 
comparisons correction, HR responses to aversive versus non -aversive stimuli showed a

audiovisual stimuli, and from 1s after stimulus onset to sti mulus offset (1 -5s) for auditory

Electromyography  
 Corrugator supercilii . We examined difference s in EMG C for aversive and non -aversive 
conditions across the three modalities. There was an interaction effect of aversiveness and 
modality  (Table 1) . Planned comparisons were conducted to examine the aversiveness effect for 
each modality. Consistent with an enhancement effect, EMG C potentiation was significantly 
greater for the aversive compared to non -aversive conditions  for audiovisual ( Maver = 0.10, SDaver 
= 0.27, Mnon-aver = -0.06, SDnon-aver = 0.2 7) and  auditory (Maver = 0.0 2, SDaver = 0.28, Mnon-aver = -
0.11, SDnon-aver = 0.2 6), but not for  visual ( Maver = 0.0 3, SDaver = 0.2 3, Mnon-aver = -0.002, SDnon-aver 
= 0.2 4) modality  (Table 1, Fig.3). After multiple comparisons correction, EMG C responses to 
aversive versus non -aversive stimuli showed a significant differentiation from 1s after the 
stimulus onset to the end of the examined interval  (1-7s) for both audiovisual and auditory 
stimuli.  
Zygomaticus major . We examined difference s in EMG Z for aversive and non -aversive 
conditions across the three modalities. There  were  main effect s of aversiveness and modality  
(Table 1) . Planned comparisons were conducted to examine the aversiveness effect for each 
modality. EMG Z potentiation was significantly greater for the aversive  compared to non -aversive 
conditions for audiovisual (Maver = 0.07, SDaver = 0.21, Mnon-aver = -0.01, SDnon-aver = 0.2 0), but not 
for auditory ( Maver = 0.08, SDaver = 0.22, Mnon-aver = 0.01, SDnon-aver = 0.2 1) or visual ( Maver = -
0.07, SDaver = 0.18, Mnon-aver = -0.10, SD non-aver = 0.20) modalit ies (Table 1, Fig. 3). After multiple 
comparisons correction, EMG Z  responses to aversive versus non -aversive stimuli showed a Journal Pre-proof

significant differentiation from  the stimulus offset to  the end of the examined interval (5-7s) for 
audiovisual stimuli.  
 
Electrodermal Activity  
We examined difference s in electrodermal activity for aversive and non -aversive 
conditions across the three modalities. Only the main effect of modality was significant  (Table 
1). Planned comparisons were conducted to examine aversiveness effect for each modality. 
Phasic EDA  was significantly  greater for the aversive compared to non -aversive conditions  for 
visual ( Maver = -0.13, SDaver = 0.20, Mnon-aver = -0.20, SDnon-aver = 0.19), but not for audiovisual 
(Maver = 0.04, SDaver = 0.18, Mnon-aver = 0.01, SDnon-aver = 0.28 ) or auditory  (Maver = 0.06, SDaver = 
0.21, Mnon-aver = 0.0 5, SDnon-aver = 0.20) modalit ies (Table 1, Fig. 3). After multiple comparisons 
correction,  EDA responses to aversive versus non -aversive stimuli showed a significant 
differentiation from 3s to 6s after the stimulus onset  for visual stimuli.  
 
Skin Temperature  
 We examined skin temperature difference s between aversive  and non -aversive conditions  
across the three modalities. The  only significant effect was the main effect of modality  (Table 1) . 
Planned comparisons revealed no significant results for differences between aversive and non -
aversive conditions  (Table 1, Fig. 3).

Residualized analys es controlling for arousal  
 We ran the same  ANOVA  and planned comparisons using the residuals of 
physiological signals after removing the variance explained by arousal ratings.  The pattern of 
significance for heart rate remained unchanged for both the overall F -test and planned 
comparisons. For EMG C, a significant modality effect emerged after controlling for arousal . 
However, the pattern of results from  planned comparison s remained unchanged . For EMG Z, the 
planned comparison of aversiveness for audiovisual modality was no longer significant after 
controlling for arousal.  For EDA, the  pattern of significant o verall F-test results remained 
unchanged, but  the planned comparison result for the visual condition was no longer significant . 
For skin temperature , the patten of results  remained unchanged for both overall F -test and 
planned comparisons.  Thus, HR and EMG C sensitivity to aversiveness c ould not be explained by 
arousal alone.

Discussion  
 
Our study was designed to investigate the differences in physiological responses to 
aversiveness in naturalistic audiovisual stimuli and their auditory and visual components. Five 
physiological signals were acquired during naturalistic stimuli  perception . Three of our measures 
(HR, EMG C, EMG Z) were sensitive to aversiveness in the  audiovisual stimuli , with HR and 
EMG C also sensitive to the auditory component . Only EDA was  sensitive to the visual 
component . SKT was not sensitive to the aversiveness manipulation for any modality . The 
sensitivity of HR and EMG C to aversiveness remained significant  after controlling for arousal.  
The enhancement effect was observed in our ratings on valence and in the HR, EMG C, and 
EMG Z responses. Four of our measures ( HR, EMG Z, EDA, SKT) were sensitive to modality, 
which may reflect valence and arousal differences across modalities.  We discuss these findings 
below  starting with the four hypotheses that we formulated . 
In support of our first hypothesis, both EMG C and EMG Z showed greater potentiation to 
aversive audiovisual stimuli. ( Bradley & Lang, 2000; Höfling et al., 2020; Larsen et al., 2003; 
Neta et al., 2009; Sato & Kochiyama, 2022)  Our second hypothesis  was partially supported. The Journal Pre-proof

23 
HR deceleration was larger for  aversive  compared to non -aversive  audiovisual stimuli , but EDA 
potentiation was not.  Our third hypothesis that aversiveness sensitivity would occur across 
modalities was partially supported. Valence and arousal ratings differed between aversive and 
non-aversive conditions  across all three modalities. HR deceleration and EMG C potentiation 
were greater for aversive  compared to non -aversive stimuli  for the audiovisual and auditory 
modali ties, but not for the visual modality.  In contrast, EDA signal was greater for aversive  
compared to non -aversive  stimuli for  the visual modality only.  EMG Z did not  show greater 
potentiation  to aversive compared to non -aversive stimuli  in either unimodal condition.  The 
fourth hypothesis that self-report  and physiological sensitivity to aversiveness differences should 
be larger for the audiovisual modality was partially supported.  Results from HR, EMG C, EMG Z 
and valence rating were consistent with a n enhancement effect, i.e., amplification of the affective 
response s when unimodal information is integrated  (Gao et al., 2018a, Gao et al., 2018b) . 
However, the enhancement effect was no t observed in other channels  (EDA, SKT) .(Bradley & 
Lang, 2000; Š olcová & Lačev, 2017; Salazar -López et al., 2015; Sato & Kochiyama, 2022)   
The robust relationship between EMG C and aversiveness is in line with previous evidence 
that it responds stronger for negative valence (Bradley & Lang, 2000; Höfling et al., 2020; 
Larsen et al., 2003; Neta et al., 2009; Sato & Kochiyama, 2022) . It may seem odd that EMG Z 
also showed greater potentiation for aversive stimuli. Literature about the relationship between 
zygomaticus major and valence is mixed . Some previous findings suggest that zygomaticus 
major muscle is an indicator of pleasantness (Baur et al., 2015; Lang et al., 1993, Sato et al., 
2008) . Other findings suggest there is a quadratic relationship between zygomaticus major 
potentiation and valence (Kappas & Pecchinenda, 1998; Larsen et al., 2003;  Menne & Schwab, 
2018) . One possible interpretation is that zygomaticus major potentiation is tied to avoidance Journal Pre-proof

24 
behaviors, like disgust (Shook et al., 2019) . Previous findings have found heightened EMG Z 
potentiation when processing disgusting pictures (Lang et al., 1993)  and dynamic video s (De 
Jong et al., 2002) . Another possible interpretation is that zygomatic muscles control multiple 
mouth movement angles that allow for diverse facial expressions, including lip corner puller 
(Action Unit 12; zygomaticus major) and nasolabial deepener (Action Unit 11; zygomaticus 
minor), the two action units related to  hedonic valence . Tan et al. (2012)  pointed out the 
possibility of the influence of cross talk from multiple muscles adjacent to the zygomaticus 
major. A future study can include measurement of both zygomaticus major and minor to better 
understand their roles in responding  to aversiveness .  
We found heightened HR deceleration following the stimulus presentation to aversive 
versus non -aversiv e conditions for both the audiovisual  stimuli and their auditory component s. 
These results are in line with previous findings that initial heart rate dec eleration was related to 
aversiveness perception  across various contexts  (Bradley et al., 2001; Bradley & Lang, 2000; 
Gomez et al., 20 16; Lang et al, 1993; Palomba et al., 2000 ). Surprisingly, the significant HR 
difference between aversive and non -aversive stimuli  found for audiovisual  and audio  
presentations was not absent in  the visual modality. As shown in the line graphs (Figure 3 ), there 
was a sharp HR deceleration for aversive visual stimuli that was as strong or stronger than that 
for the aversive audiovisual and auditory presentations. However, non -aversive visual stimuli 
also showed a prominent deceleration (0 -5s), rather than  the slight initial deceleration (0 -1s), 
subsequent acceleration (1 -3s), and later deceleration (3 -5s) pattern found for non -aversive 
audiovisual and auditory stimuli. The HR acceleration phase occurring 2 -3s after stimuli 
presentation has been shown to be  a characteristic feature of both pleasant sounds  (Bradley & 
Lang, 2000 ) and pictures  (Bradley et al, 2001 ; Lang et al., 1993 ). Thus, one might argue that the Journal Pre-proof

25 
lack of significant HR difference for the visual component in our data may reflect the presence of 
sustained HR deceleration rather than the expected initial HR deceleration and subsequent 
acceleration. Bradley et al. (2001 ) suggested that the HR accelerat ion in response to appetitive 
stimuli may indicate the “success of a recognition -encoding process”, with more readily 
identifieable stimuli (e.g., food and nature) eliciting greater acceleration compared to stimuli 
requiring more sustained processing (e.g. , families or sports scenes with novel individuals). A 
recent review (Skora et al., 2022) proposes that HR deceleration is associated with enhanced 
attention to external stimuli, while HR aceleration is associated with enhanced action tendencies 
and behavi oral readjustment. One potential explanation for the strong HR deceleration observed 
for non -aversive visual stimuli in our study is that identifying videos without sound may 
generally demand greater attentional resources compared to audiovisual clips and sounds alone.  
Our results on EDA only showed that it was sensitive to aversiveness for the visual 
component. This may suggest an effect of arousal, instead of valence. There are m any studies 
that has shown a reliable relationship between  EDA  and arousal  (e.g., Lang et al., 1993; Sato et 
al., 2020; Sato & Kochiyama, 2022) . In partial support of this interpretation, o ur EDA results 
were no longer significant once arousal was accounted for.  
Becau se we focused on aversiveness in naturalistic stimuli, valence and arousal were 
inherently confounded (Kuppens et al., 2013) , unlike controlled stimuli that are specifically 
designed to be balanced in terms of both valence and arousal. This natural overlap between 
valence and arousal in rea l-world stimuli makes it challenging to isolate the individual 
contributions of each factor with stimulus manipulation.  To better understand our  significant  
results of aversiveness sensitivity , we regressed out the effect of arousal to statistically isolate the 
effect of valence  using re sidualized ANOVA. Our results revealed that the sensitivity of heart Journal Pre-proof

26 
rate and corrugator supercilii to aversiveness remain even when controlling for arousal. This 
suggests that valence is the primary contributor  to the  physiological processes observed in our 
study.  
Many real -life scenarios involve sounds that carry emotional weight, such as the sounds 
of honking horns on a busy street. Our stimuli emphasize sensory sensitivity to sound, while 
visual components tend to be less emotionally evocative. For example, it is  the jarring noise of a 
chair scraping across the floor that creates an aversive reaction, rather than the visual of the 
scene itself. Thus, it  is unsurprising for  our stimuli set that the aversiveness was detectable in 
heart rate  and corrugator supercilii  signals for auditory component, and not for the visual 
component. These results highlight the powerful role that sound plays in shaping emotional 
experiences .  
Our study extended previous research regarding the effects of presentation modality  by 
comparin g naturalistic audiovisual clips to their isolated unimodal components.  This approach 
allowed us to examine  the enhancement effect across modalities more directly while controlling 
for content differences. Our self-report  data replicated the enhancement effect, in which the 
difference in valence for aversive versus non -aversive stimuli was greater for the combined 
audiovisual stimuli than for either modality separately (Baumgartner et al., 2006; Gao, Wedell, 
Green, et al., 2018; Gao, Wedell, Kim, et al., 2018) . The observed interaction of aversiveness 
and modality for H R and  EMG C also supported this effect  in physiological data . 
There are a number of limitations in the current study. Our participants were 
predominantly female  college students , reflecting student composition of the psychology 
participant pool. Thus, we were not able to examine the effects of age and gender (Burriss et al., 
2007)  on physiological responses to aversiveness. Also,  we used a fairly short stimuli Journal Pre-proof

27 
presentation interval  (5s). However, p ast research in our lab  has identified valence and arousal 
from  fMRI  (Kim et al., 2016, 2017)  and physiologica l (Kim & Wedell, 2016)  signals using 4s, 
5s, and 8s presentation intervals.  Although  the naturalistic stimuli , like the ones used in this 
study,  have the advantage of increased ecological validity, they lack control over lower -level 
auditory and visual features that may contribute to physiological responses (Coutinho & 
Cangelosi, 2011 ; Delpl anque et al., 2007 ). In addition, the direct comparison with prior research 
is limited given no extreme content (e.g. mutilation, erotica themes) or food related themes that 
previously elicited  strong cardiac responses (Bradley et al., 2001) were used in the present study. 
Finally, by  comparing aversive and non -aversive stimuli,  we are adopting a bipolar 
representation of valence and cannot test for effects that may emerge from bivalent approach.  
Further studies could address some of these lim itations.  
In conclusion, t he present study isolated the unimodal audi tory and visual components 
from naturalistic audiovisual clips to examine physiological responses as a function of 
aversiveness and presentation modality. We found that heart rate  and corrugator supercilii 
potentiation were consistently sensitive to aversiveness across audiovisual and auditory 
modalities. Electrodermal activity and zygomaticus major signals were less reliably related to 
aversiveness. Overall, physiological signals for the visual components were less differentiated. In 
addition, our results showed partial support for an emotional enhancement effect for cross -modal 
integration in both p hysiological activity and affective ratings. These findings extended previous 
research on psychophysiological audiovisual pairing and provide insights for future studies that 
may sample from clinical populations.

Highlights  
 
Audiovisual clips and their components were examined in the same experiment  
• Hear t rate deceleration for aversive audiovisual clips and their auditory components  
• Increased corrugator supercilii potentiation for aversive audiovisual clips  
• Increased corrugator supercilii potentiation for aversive auditory components  
• Overall, physiologica l responses to the visual component were less distinct
