NOR). Scandinavian Journal of Psychology .
Objective
To perform a psychometric evaluation of a Norwegian version of the Berlin Misophonia Questionnaire Revised (BMQ-R-NOR).
Design
Participants completed online versions of the self-report questionnaire BMQ-R-NOR on two occasions and MQ-NOR on one occasion. Convergent validit y
was assessed through Spearman ’s correlation between BMQ-R-NOR and MQ-NOR. Internal consistency was evaluated with McDonald ’s omega and
Cronbach ’s alpha. Test –retest reliability was evaluated using Cohen ’s weighted kappa and intraclass correlation.
Study sample
82 participants with self-reported misophonia took part in the study at T1, and 53 of these participated at T2. However, only 41 of them were included in
the test –retest analyses due to 12 participants being in treatment between T1 and T2.
Results
Subscales from the BMQ-R-NOR and MQ-NOR were signi ﬁcantly positively correlated, indicating evidence of convergent validity ( rs=0.22*–0.74**).
The BMQ-R-NOR showed overall good internal consistency (omega =0.72–0.93; alpha =0.70–0.93) and satisfactory test –retest reliability (ICC =0.35–
0.92).
Conclusion
The psychometric properties of the BMQ-R-NOR are considered satisfactory. However, it is advised to exercise caution when using it until further
comprehensive validation studies are conducted to ensure robustness and reliability in clinical practice.
Key words : Misophonia questionnaire, decreased sound tolerance, test –retest validation, self-report, Norwegian.

INTRODUCTION
Misophonia is a term ﬁrst coined by Jastreboff and
Jastreboff ( 2001 ), and the disorder has been de ﬁned and
characterized differently since then (Brout, Edelstein, Erfanian,et al.,2018 ). However, a recent publication by Swedo, Baguley,
Denys, et al.(2022 ) has aimed to establish a consensus de ﬁnition
to enhance the understanding of the disorder and facilitate thedevelopment of effective treatments. They described misophoniaas a disorder of decreased tolerance to speci ﬁc sounds, known as
“triggers. ”The triggers are often sounds made by other human
beings and repetitive in nature (e.g., eating sounds or the clickingof a pen). When individuals with misophonia detect triggeringstimuli, they often ﬁnd it challenging to shift their attention away
from them. This can lead to unpleasant and distressing
experiences, eliciting negative emotional, physiological, andbehavioral responses. These trigger stimuli can evoke a range ofnegative reactions, including anger, irritation, disgust, and anxiety,and induce increased muscular tension, heart rate, and sweating(Swedo, Baguley, Denys, et al.,2022 ). Misophonia signi ﬁcantly
disrupts the lives of those affected, as it often leads tomaladaptive behaviors and avoidance patterns that interfere with
their ability to perform tasks at work or in academics, and results
in notable impairment in their interpersonal relationships (Brout,Edelstein, Erfanian, et al .,2018 ; Ferrer-Torres & Gim /C19enes-
Llort, 2022 ).
While there is currently no universally agreed-on procedure for
assessing the disorder, use of clinical interviews and othermeasures, such as self-report questionnaires, has been suggested(Wiese, Wojcik & Storch, 2021 ). There are multiple self-report
questionnaires available for assessing misophonia. Each onecaptures speci ﬁc aspects of the disorder, although they may not
necessarily measure the same constructs or dimensions due to
variations in the de ﬁnition of misophonia (Swedo, Baguley,
Denys, et al .,2022 ). Questionnaires that have undergone
psychometric analyses include the Misophonia Questionnaire(MQ; Wu, Lewin, Murphy & Storch, 2014 ), MisoQuest (Siepsiak,
/C19Sliwerski & Dragan, 2020 ), the Selective Sound Sensitivity
Syndrome Scale (S-Five; Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes &Gregory, 2021 ), the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ;
Rosenthal, Anand, Cassiello-Robbins, et al .,2021 ), the
Duke-Vanderbilt Misophonia Screening Questionnaire (DVMSQ;Williams, Cascio & Woynaroski, 2022 ), the Misophonia Response
Scale (MRS; Dibb, Golding & Dozier, 2021 ), the Misophonia
Impact Questionnaire (MIQ; Aazh, Moore, Scaglione &Remmert, 2023 ), and the Berlin Misophonia Questionnaire
Revised (BMQ-R; Remmert, Schmidt, Mussel, Hagel &

Eid, 2022 ; Remmert, Jebens, Gruzman, Gregory &
Vitoratou, 2022 ). Utilizing psychometrically sound assessment
instruments is imperative for comprehensively understanding thenature and severity of misophonia and for effectively evaluatingtreatment outcomes by assessing changes in symptom severity
and degree of distress (Fackrell & Hoare, 2018 ).
In Norway, the MQ has undergone preliminary psychometric
analyses (i.e., MQ-NOR by Larsen, Hovland, Nielsen &Larsen, 2022 ), providing valuable insights into its measurement
properties, which were reported to be good. However, despitethese positive ﬁndings, the MQ-NOR is limited in its brevity and
insufﬁcient coverage of key aspects of misophonia. Although
demonstrating promising initial psychometric properties,
uncertainties persist regarding the MQ ’s ability to accurately
measure misophonia and its generalizability to the broaderpopulation of misophonia sufferers. These uncertainties stem fromits validation against a questionnaire assessing general soundsensitivity and its usage of a university sample. Furthermore, theuse of a single self-reported severity item limits suf ﬁcient
psychometric evaluation. Given its development prior to theestablishment of core de ﬁnitions regarding misophonia, there is a
potential need for re ﬁnement to better align with current
understandings of the disorder (Rosenthal, Anand, Cassiello-Robbins, et al.,2021 ; Siepsiak, /C19Sliwerski & Dragan, 2020 ). The
BMQ-R was validated against two misophonia questionnaires andadditional measures to suf ﬁciently validate all symptom-oriented
subscales. Data collection involved both a university sample andparticipants recruited through online posts on social media.Additionally, the BMQ-R aligns with the scienti ﬁc consensus on
the de ﬁnition of misophonia. Furthermore, it has undergone a
revision, which ensures that the questionnaire has incorporatedupdated conceptualizations and improvements based on analysesof the previous version (Remmert, Jebens, et al.,2022 ; Remmert,
Schmidt, et al .,2022 ). The BMQ-R was chosen for its
symptom-oriented construction rationale and comprehensivecoverage of misophonic symptoms. Additionally, its alignmentwith the consensus and the recent revision underscores its
suitability. Our aim was to provide clinicians with an exhaustive
and improved instrument for assessing misophonia that ensuredboth validity and reliability.
The present study
The present study aimed to conduct an initial validation of a
Norwegian version of the Berlin Misophonia Questionnaire
Revised (i.e., BMQ-R-NOR), a multidimensional diagnostic
instrument that measures a wide range of misophonic symptoms(Remmert, Jebens, et al.,2022 ; Remmert, Schmidt, et al.,2022 ).
To evaluate translation equivalence, it was hypothesized that
the translated version of the BMQ-R-NOR would maintain theoriginal meaning and intention of each item. This hypothesis wasbased on the importance of ensuring consistency in theinterpretation of questionnaire items across languages and
cultures. The forward and back translation procedure was
employed as a widely accepted method for assessing translationequivalence. An expert panel, consisting of bilingual individualswith expertise in both the source and target languages, assessedthe translation against the original to ensure semantic equivalencein each subscale. Consensus among the experts was sought to
conﬁrm the accuracy of the translation process.
Similarly, a hypothesis regarding cultural equivalence posited
that the translation would be culturally adapted to ensureunderstanding and relevance for the Norwegian population. This
criterion was based on the recognition of the in ﬂuence of cultural
factors on the interpretation of questionnaire items. Pre-testingwith potential participants was conducted to assess questioncomprehension and identify any cultural misunderstandings orsensitivities. This step aimed to ensure that the translatedquestionnaire resonated with the cultural context of the targetpopulation.
To assess convergent validity, both indirect and direct methods
were employed. Indirectly, intercorrelations between the
symptom-oriented subscales and the General Sound IntoleranceSymptoms (GSIS) subscale were utilized, aligning with theindirect validation approach employed by Remmert, Schmidt,et al ., (2022 ) and Remmert, Jebens, et al (2022 ). It was
anticipated that all subscales within each content area would
demonstrate high positive correlations. Additionally, it wasexpected that the GSIS would exhibit moderate to high
correlations with misophonic symptoms. Directly, correlations
were calculated between all subscales from the BMQ-R-NOR andthe MQ-NOR Emotions and Behaviors Scale, as well as betweenthe MQ-NOR Severity Scale and selected subscales from theBMQ-R-NOR. The MQ-NOR Symptom Scale, a triggerfrequency scale, closely aligns with the sound classes outlined inthe condition part of the BMQ-R-NOR. Consequently, no speci ﬁc
analyses were conducted on these sound classes, as their primary
function is to provide an overview of the most disturbing sounds
experienced by an individual. The MQ-NOR measures someaspects of misophonia, encompassing broad symptoms associatedwith the disorder. It was hypothesized that certain subscales fromthe BMQ-R-NOR would show moderate to high correlations withthe MQ-NOR Emotions and Behaviors Scale, which can becategorized descriptively into avoidance items, emotionalreactions items, one distress item, and dysregulation items.
Speci ﬁcally, it was anticipated that subscales aligning with the
descriptive content of the MQ-NOR Emotions and BehaviorsScale (Anger Present, Irritation Present, Anxiety Present,Behavioral Dysregulation, Emotional Dysregulation, ReactiveAvoidance, Anticipatory Avoidance, and Distress) woulddemonstrate higher correlations. Conversely, it was hypothesizedthat subscales not aligning with the MQ-NOR Emotions andBehaviors Scale on a descriptive content level would correlate
moderately. The MQ-NOR Severity Scale was correlated with the
subscales in the content areas of Dysregulation, AvoidanceBehavior, and Clinical Signi ﬁcance (refer to the Measures section
for an extensive list of content areas and subscales). It washypothesized that these subscales would demonstrate moderate tohigh correlations with the MQ-NOR Severity Scale, which is inline with current literature (Guzick, Cervin, Smith, et al.,2023 ;
Jager, de Koning, Bost, Denys & Vulink, 2020 ;M€ollmann,
Heinrichs, Illies, Potthast & Kley, 2023 ).
Last, regarding reliability, it was hypothesized that the
translated version of the BMQ-R-NOR would maintain thereliability of the measurements. This hypothesis was based on theassumption that the translation process did not introduce

signiﬁcant measurement errors. To evaluate reliability, internal
consistency (i.e., omega and alpha) were calculated for thetranslated version and compared with those of the original versionto ensure comparable reliability. Test –retest reliability was also
evaluated by assessing the consistency of responses between two
testing points. The intraclass correlation coef ﬁcient (ICC) was
calculated to quantify the degree of agreement between the testresults from the two time points, providing an estimate of thestability of the measurements over time.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Procedure and participants
Data were collected through Nettskjema, an online service provided by the
University of Oslo for creating, storing, and managing surveys and data
collection, which is connected to the secure IT platform TSD (Tjeneste for
Sensitive Data) (Nettskjema, n.d.). Participants were recruited by
experienced educational audio therapists through four audiology clinics, aswell as through social media groups and posts. No ﬁnancial or other
support was provided. To meet the inclusion criteria for participation in
the study, individuals had to be between the ages of 18 and 67 years andreport a current or suspected complaint of misophonia. Participantsreceived comprehensive information about the study, which included a
thorough explanation of misophonia experience and symptoms, aiming to
establish consistent comprehension of the term (i.e., “Do you experience
anger or irritation when someone else eats, slurps or breathes loudly? Do
you avoid meals with friends and family? Do you lose concentration when
exposed to repetitive sounds? ”). All participants were required to provide
informed consent and answer all questions before submitting thequestionnaire. The data were collected between February and April 2023.
Participants were asked to respond to the survey on two occasions,
approximately two weeks apart. These time points were labeled T1 andT2, respectively. The study was approved by Sikt —Norwegian Agency for
Shared Services in Education and Research, which allowed us to handle
personal data. Ethics approval from the Regional Committees for Medical
and Health Research Ethics (REK) was not required, as the primary focusof this study was to adapt and validate the BMQ-R-NOR.
At T1, a total of 82 participants completed the survey (85.4% female).
At T2, 53 participants completed the survey (79.2% female). The meanage was M=37.7 ( SD=12.33). Of all participants, 74.7% obtained
information about the study through social media, 21.7% acquired it from
personal acquaintances, and 3.6% received it through educational audio
therapists. To prevent any potential interference caused by treatmenteffects, 12 participants who were receiving treatment for misophonia at T1and/or T2 were excluded from the test –retest analyses.
Translation
The translation of the BMQ-R was based on the guidelines outlined in the
“WHODAS 2.0 Translation package (version 1.0): Translation and
Linguistic Evaluation Protocol and Supporting Material ”(World Health
Organization [WHO], n.d.). This process involved a forward- and
back-translation procedure aimed at achieving cross-cultural andconceptual equivalence (WHO, n.d.). Although the guidelines are
speciﬁcally tailored for the translation of WHODAS, they outline the
standard WHO method, which we followed for the translation andadaptation of the BMQ-R. Initially, permission was granted from thedevelopers of the BMQ-R to adapt the questionnaire into Norwegian.
Next, a professional translator was engaged to create a forward-translation.
An expert panel was assembled to review the translation, consisting of twoNorwegian-German bilinguals, one educational audio therapist with
clinical expertise in misophonia, and one psychologist with expertise in
family con ﬂicts. The two bilingual experts compared the
forward-translation with the original version and provided suggestions forimprovements in cases where the translation was unclear or inaccurate.Afterward, two professionals from different backgrounds reviewed both
the forward-translation and the suggestions provided by the bilingualexperts. The professional experts provided feedback on the suggestions,
often concurring with them, but occasionally proposing their modi ﬁcation
based on their expertise in the ﬁeld. Any discrepancies were discussed and
resolved by the ﬁrst and last author. A second translator was engaged to
produce a back-translation of selected items from the ﬁnal reviewed
forward-translation. The Department of Special Needs Education at theUniversity of Oslo was responsible for engaging the translators. One ofthe developers compared the back-translation with the original version and
evaluated the selected items, providing comments on which items were
equivalent in translation and which ones may have changed in meaning oritem dif ﬁculty. Due to time constraints, the pre-testing of the questionnaire
and the main data collection were conducted before a review of the
back-translation in comparison with the original version could take place.
The Norwegian instrument was pre-tested by four individuals whoself-reported having misophonia. They offered feedback on items thatwere dif ﬁcult to understand or unclear, and this resulted in minor
adjustments to the wording of three items and the inclusion of examples
for the sound classes.
Measures
Norwegian version of the Berlin Misophonia Questionnaire
(BMQ-R-NOR). The questionnaire comprises a condition part and a
symptom part (Remmert, Jebens, et al .,2022 ; Remmert, Schmidt,
et al.,2022 ). The condition part includes the General Sound Intolerance
Symptoms (GSIS) subscale and 20 items that measure the extent of
disturbances related to externally and internally produced sound classes.
The GSIS consists of four items that are rated on a six-point scale rangingfrom 0 ( not at all agree )t o5( completely agree ). The sound classes are
rated on a six-point scale ranging from 0 ( not disturbing at all )t o5
(maximally disturbing ). The symptom part consists of 73 items organized
into 20 subscales across six criteria-oriented content areas: (1) AversiveReactions to the Presence of Sounds and (2) Anticipation of Sounds,encompassing the subscales Anger, Irritation, Disgust, Anxiety, and
Physical Reactions, in response to both the presence and anticipation; (3)
Dysregulation, encompassing General, Behavioral, Cognitive, andEmotional Dysregulation; (4) Clinical Insight, consisting of the subscalesRecognition of Disproportionality and Excess; (5) Avoidance Behavior,
including the two subscales Reactive and Anticipatory Avoidance; and (6)
Clinical Signi ﬁcance, consisting of Distress and Functional Impairment
(Remmert, Jebens, et al .,2022 ; Remmert, Schmidt, et al .,2022 ).
Respondents rate each item on a six-point scale ranging from 0 ( not at all
agree )t o5( completely agree ).
Norwegian version of the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ-NOR;
Larsen, Hovland, Nielsen & Larsen, 2022 ).The MQ-NOR is a
self-report questionnaire for assessing misophonia, consisting of three
subscales. The Misophonia Symptom Scale (omega =0.71) comprises
seven items and is rated on a ﬁve-point scale ranging from 0 ( not at all
true)t o4( always true ). The Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors Scale
(omega =0.81) consists of 10 items and is rated on a ﬁve-point scale
ranging from 0 ( never )t o4( always ). The Total Score Scale is calculated
by summing the scores from these two subscales. The MisophoniaSeverity Scale is a single-item 16-point rating scale ranging from 0 ( not
sound sensitive )t o1 5( very severe ).
Statistical analyses
The internal consistency of the BMQ-R-NOR was assessed with
McDonald ’s omega and Cronbach ’s alpha coef ﬁcients, which were
classi ﬁed based on established cutoff values: 0.70 –0.79 reliable, 0.80 –0.90
highly reliable, and >0.90 very highly reliable (Cohen, Manion &
Morrison, 2018 ). Omega is the estimate utilized by the developers of the
BMQ-R, and it is particularly advantageous for use with non-normally
distributed data (Trizano-Hermosilla & Alvarado, 2016 ). Alpha estimates
were included to facilitate comparability with results from studies, as

many older studies only provide estimates of alpha. Following Remmert,
Schmidt, et al (2022 ) and Remmert, Jebens, et al (2022 ), con ﬁdence
intervals for omega and alpha were computed using bias-corrected and
accelerated bootstrapping with a bootstrapping sample size B =1,000
(Kelley, 2023 ; R Core Team, 2023 ). The interpretation of the correlation
coefﬁcients followed the rule of thumb proposed by Hinkle, Jurs, and
Wiersma ( 2003 ). Convergent validity was indirectly evaluated by
calculating correlations between the symptom-oriented subscales and theGSIS subscale. In addition, all subscales from the BMQ-R-NOR werecorrelated with the MQ-NOR Emotions and Behaviors Scale, and selected
subscales from the BMQ-R-NOR were correlated with the MQ-NOR
Severity Scale, to further examine convergent validity. Subscale scores ofthe BMQ-R-NOR were computed by calculating the mean score of allitems within each subscale. The correlation analyses were performed using
Spearman ’s rho correlation coef ﬁcients due to non-normality in the data,
as determined by the Shapiro –Wilk test. Test –retest reliability was
examined using four methods. Three methods were used for categoricalvariables (i.e., individual items), which included (1) exact agreement
between items at T1 and T2, (2) difference of one point or less in response
between T1 and T2, and (3) Cohen ’s weighted kappa (Landis &
Koch, 1977 ). The fourth method was used for continuous variables (i.e.,
BMQ-R-NOR subscales), which involved intraclass correlations (ICCs).
ICC estimates and their 95% con ﬁdent intervals were based on a single
rater/measurement, absolute-agreement, two-way mixed model (Koo &Li,2016 ). The criteria for Cohen ’s weighted kappa ratings were as
follows: 0.21 –0.40 for fair agreement, 0.41 –0.60 for moderate agreement,
0.61–0.80 for substantial agreement, and 0.81 –1 for almost perfect
agreement (Landis & Koch, 1977 ). ICC values were interpreted according
to the following criteria: <0.50 were considered poor reliability, 0.50 –0.75
were moderate reliability, 0.75 –0.90 were good reliability, and >0.90 were
excellent reliability (Koo & Li, 2016 ). The statistical analyses were
conducted using IBM SPSS (Version 29), Jamovi (Version 2.2.5), and R
Statistical Software (Version 4.9.3; R Core Team, 2023 ) with the package
MBESS (Kelley, 2023 ).
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics
Of the participants, 67.1% had the highest GSIS sum score of 20.
T h em e a nG S I Ss u ms c o r ew a s M=19.12 ( SD=1.69). Notably,
when applying the same cutoff scores as utilized by Remmert,
Schmidt, et al (2022) and Remmert, Jebens, et al (2022), where
potentially affected individuals are identi ﬁed by a sum score greater
than 12, only one participant in this sample scored below thisthreshold. Based on these results, it can be inferred that the majorityof the sample primarily consisted of individuals who may beaffected by the disorder. The three sound classes that participantswere most disturbed by were “people eating ”(M=4.32,
SD=1.05), “throat and mouth sounds ”(M=3.60, SD=1.32), and
“people drinking ”(M=3.41, SD=1.39). The least disturbing
sound class was “animal sounds ”(M=0.96, SD=1.19).
The 20 symptom-oriented subscales had means and standard
deviations ranging from M=3.7 ( SD=3.84) to M=18.4
(SD=2.88). The Anticipation Anxiety Reactions subscale had
the lowest mean, and the Present Irritation Reactions subscale hadthe highest. Please see Table 3for an overview of the means and
standard deviations of all subscales.
Convergent validity
Intercorrelations between the symptom-oriented subscales and the
GSIS subscale can be found in Table 1. The average correlationamong all subscales within Aversive Reactions to the Presence of
Sounds is moderate and positive ( r
s=0.52), and in Aversive
Reactions to the Anticipation of Sounds, it is similar ( rs=0.51).
Within the Dysregulation domain, the average correlation alsoleans toward a moderate and positive association ( r
s=0.41).
Regarding the Clinical Insight and Clinical Signi ﬁcance content
areas, high positive correlations were observed with the subscalesin each content area, as hypothesized, speci ﬁcally, the subscales
Disproportionality and Excess ( r
s=0.75) and Distress and
Functional Impairment ( rs=0.78). Additionally, within
Avoidance Behavior, the subscales Reactive Avoidance andAnticipatory Avoidance displayed moderate positive correlations(r
s=0.63). In the Presence of Sounds content area, the highest
correlation is found between the subscales Irritation and Anger,
Irritation and Disgust, and Anxiety and Physical ( rs=0.59),
whereas the lowest correlation is between Anxiety and Disgust(r
s=0.38). Within the Anticipation of Sounds domain, the
highest correlation is observed between the subscales Disgust andIrritation ( r
s=0.67), with the lowest observed between Anxiety
and Anger ( rs=0.26). The GSIS displayed an average moderate
positive correlation, with the highest correlation observed with the
subscale Irritation Present ( rs=0.55), and the lowest correlation
was found with Anxiety Present ( rs=0.16), indicating a non-
signiﬁcant correlation. These ﬁndings deviate from the initial
hypotheses, as it was expected that all subscales within eachcontent area would demonstrate high positive correlations, andthat the GSIS would exhibit moderate to high correlationswith misophonic symptoms, contrasting notably with theintercorrelations observed in the original BMQ-R dataset.
To assess convergent validity, all symptom-oriented subscales
were correlated with the MQ-NOR Emotions and Behaviors Scale.Furthermore, speci ﬁc subscales such as General, Behavioral,
Cognitive and Emotional Dysregulation, Reactive and AnticipatoryAvoidance, and Distress and Functional Impairment were correlatedwith the MQ-NOR Severity Scale (see Table 2). The correlations
between the BMQ-R-NOR subscales and the MQ-NOR Emotionsand Behaviors Scale ranged from descriptively low positive
correlation ( r
s=0.36, Cognitive Dysregulation) to high positive
correlation ( rs=0.74, Anger Present). The correlations between the
selected subscales from the BMQ-R-NOR and the MQ-NORSeverity Scale ranged from descriptively non-signi ﬁcant correlation
(r
s=0.17, Behavioral Dysregulation) to moderate positive
correlation ( rs=0.57, Anticipatory Avoidance). These results
deviate from the initial hypotheses.
Internal consistency
The internal consistency for the 21 subscales ranged from reliable
(omega =0.72) to very highly reliable (omega =0.93). Notably,
the subscale Behavioral Dysregulation exhibited the lowestreliability estimate, and the subscales Anticipation AnxietyReactions and Functional Impairment demonstrated the highestreliability. Comparatively, the internal consistency of the subscales
in the BMQ-R-NOR is slightly lower than that of the original
BMQ-R. However, the BMQ-R-NOR shows higher values ofomega in ﬁve subscales: Present Irritation Reactions (0.85),
Anticipation Anxiety Reactions (0.93), Anticipation PhysicalReactions (0.86), Reactive Avoidance (0.73), and Functional

Impairment (0.93). The con ﬁdence intervals for omega overlap for
most of the subscales between the original BMQ-R and itsNorwegian adaptation, except for ﬁve subscales, namely Present
Anger Reactions, Anticipation Disgust Reactions, BehavioralDysregulation, Recognition of Excess, and Distress. For anoverview of the reliability estimates for each subscale, please referto Table 3.
Test–retest reliability
Examining both exact agreement and agreement with a difference
of one grade or less, the agreement for individual items on theBMQ-R-NOR ranged from poor to very good. Weighted kappas
were in the fair to almost perfect agreement range with valuesranging from 0.23 (G3) to 0.81 (BD03) (see SupplementaryAppendix S1). The ICCs ranged from 0.53 (GSIS) to 0.92
(Functional Impairment), indicating moderate to excellent
agreement, except for Present Irritation Reactions, which showed
poor agreement (ICC =0.35) (see Table 4).
DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to perform a preliminary evaluation of
the BMQ-R-NOR, a Norwegian version of the BMQ-R(Remmert, Jebens, et al.,2022 ; Remmert, Schmidt, et al.,2022 ),
by examining its psychometric properties. The main objective was
to introduce a second, more comprehensive misophoniaassessment tool speci ﬁcally designed for the Norwegian context.
This evaluation signi ﬁes notable progress in research and clinical
practices in the ﬁeld of misophonia within the Norwegian
population.
It was hypothesized that the translated version would accurately
preserve the original meaning and intent of each item while being
culturally adapted to the Norwegian population. However, due to
time constraints, the back-translated items were not reviewed priorto questionnaire testing, potentially resulting in changes inwording that could alter the intended measurement, reduceextremity, or deviate from the original meaning of certain items.Comments from the developer of the BMQ-R suggested thatcertain items may indeed have changed in terms of meaningduring the translation process, particularly within the subscales
Behavioral Dysregulation, Disproportionality, and Distress. In the
Behavioral Dysregulation subscale, one item has been modi ﬁed to
have less extreme wording compared with the original version,using get furious (“bli rasende ”) instead of freak out (“ausrasten ”)
in the Norwegian translation. This change potentially affects theitem ’s alignment with the intended construct of behavioral
dysregulation, as it may now load onto the factor of angerreactions instead. Another item in the Behavioral Dysregulation
subscale also has less extreme wording in the translated version,
potentially altering the perception of control over unsolicitedcomments. These modi ﬁcations were made to better align with
the Norwegian language and culture. The item in the subscaleDisproportionality was unintentionally modi ﬁed by adding a
moral component resulting in the statement I shouldn ’t react like
that...(“Egentlig bør jeg ikke reagere s /C23ann...”) instead of the
original, which stated I should not have to react to ...(“Eigentlich
m€
usste ich gar nicht so ...”). This change was prompted by
uncertainty regarding the correct interpretation of the originalitem, as one of the bilingual experts found it to be ambiguous.Ultimately, the modi ﬁed version was chosen to ensure better
alignment with the remaining items in the same subscale.Additionally, within the subscale Distress, the Norwegian versionused less extreme wording compared with the original version,using terms such as emotionally stressed (“emosjonelt stresset ”)
and stressed (“stresset ”) instead of emotionally burdened
(“emotional belastet ”) and bothered (“belasten ”). The choice of
terminology was based on feedback from the bilingual expertsand the desire to maintain coherence throughout the questionnaire.Furthermore, in the Anxiety Present subscale, termed Fear PresentTable 2. Relationship between subscales from the BMQ-R-NOR and the

in Norwegian to avoid confusion with the clinical diagnosis of
anxiety, one item was adjusted accordingly. For instance,Sometimes I experience intense anxiety or panic (“Noen ganger
føler jeg intens angst eller panikk ...”) was translated as
Sometimes I experience intense fear or panic (“Noen ganger føler
jeg intens frykt eller panikk ...”) to better re ﬂect the intended
construct in the Norwegian context.
The intercorrelations between the symptom-oriented subscales
exhibit signi ﬁcant positive correlations within their respective
content area, although consistency across different domainsvaries. While some correlations were indeed high and positive, itis noteworthy that not all correlations aligned descriptively withthe hypothesis of high positive correlations. In comparison withthe original BMQ-R (Remmert, Jebens, et al.,2022 ; Remmert,
Schmidt, et al .,2022 ), the BMQ-R-NOR demonstrates lower
overall correlations. The observed discrepancies may stem from
sampling variations, wherein homogeneity of the participantgroup could in ﬂuence the observed correlations, or the translation
process, which could potentially lead to inaccurately translateditems (Beaton, Bombardier, Guillemin & Ferraz, 2000 ; Cohen,
Manion & Morrison, 2018 ). Additionally, the use of summed
scores may have contributed to the overall lower correlationsobserved in our study. Notably, the GSIS displays moderate to
low, and in two cases non-signi ﬁcant, correlations with the
respective symptom-oriented subscales. This observation isparticularly noteworthy and not in line with the initial hypothesis.However, it may be explained by the low variance of the GSIS.The relatively low and non-signi ﬁcant correlation between theGSIS and the Anxiety subscales (Present and Anticipation) could
be attributed to the possibility that the scale does not captureprimary reactions but rather secondary emotions in response tosounds. Individuals with misophonia may not identify panic orfear as their primary reactions to sounds. Instead, they mayinitially respond with anger, followed by a sense of panic(Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes & Gregory, 2021 ).
The correlation analyses conducted between all BMQ-R-NOR
subscales and the MQ-NOR Emotions and Behaviors Scale, aswell as between selected BMQ-R-NOR subscales and theMQ-NOR Severity Scale, provide support for the hypothesis thatthe BMQ-R-NOR subscales measure conceptually relatedconstructs. Notably, a descriptively higher correlation wasobserved between the MQ-NOR Emotions and Behaviors Scaleand the BMQ-R-NOR ’s Anger Present subscale compared with
Irritation Present, a pattern similarly observed in the Anticipation
domain. This difference in correlation strengths may be attributedto the composition of the MQ-NOR subscale, which comprisescomposites of various symptoms. For instance, within theEmotions and Behaviors Scale, four out of ten items re ﬂect anger
symptoms, while only one item represents irritation. Thisdiscrepancy in item representation could potentially in ﬂuence the
strength of correlations observed between speci ﬁc subscales.
Contrary to our hypothesis, regarding the correlations with the
MQ-NOR Severity Scale, the selected BMQ-R-NOR subscalesdid not exhibit descriptively high correlations with the MQ-NORSeverity Scale. However, all but one scale showed signi ﬁcant and
descriptively low to moderate positive correlations. The absenceTable 3. Descriptive indices and reliability estimates for the BMQ-R-NOR subscales

of a signi ﬁcant correlation between the Behavioral Dysregulation
subscale and the Severity Scale raises concerns regardingconvergent validity. While it is expected that behavioral
dysregulation and symptom severity are closely related constructs,
this observed discrepancy prompts further examination. Theseresults provide preliminary empirical support for the validity ofthe BMQ-R-NOR as a measure for assessing misophonia. Toestablish construct validity, the original BMQ-R underwentcomprehensive evaluations using various instruments thatassessed constructs similar to the different symptom-orientedscales (Remmert, Jebens, et al .,2022 ; Remmert, Schmidt,
et al.,2022 ).
The ﬁndings regarding internal consistency offer valuable
insights into the measurement properties of the BMQ-R-NOR.The analyses indicate satisfactory internal consistency across allsubscales, suggesting that items within each subscale are coherentand measure the same underlying concept. However, whenexamining the Dysregulation domain, all subscales showed highto very high reliability except the Behavioral Dysregulation
subscale, which exhibited only reliable indices. This discrepancy
could be attributed to some items loading onto the factor of anger,as previously stated. Moreover, upon comparing the con ﬁdence
intervals of the reliability estimates between our sample and theoriginal sample, it is evident that most subscales exhibit
overlapping con ﬁdence intervals, indicating statistically indifferent
estimates. However, there were notable exceptions where theconﬁdence intervals did not overlap, speci ﬁcally in ﬁve subscales.
These discrepancies suggest potential differences in reliability
between our sample and the original sample. Nonetheless, these
results tentatively suggest that the translation of the BMQ-R tothe BMQ-R-NOR appears to be appropriate.
At the descriptive level, the test –retest analyses revealed that
the mean exact agreement across all items was 49% (i.e., 77 itemsby 41 participants). Additionally, the mean difference of onegrade or less across all items was 80.6%. These ﬁndings indicate
that the majority of the changes in responses from T1 to T2 were
minor, with only one grade or less difference. However, there
were variations in responses, raising questions about the stabilityof the questionnaire. Based on the statistical test –retest analyses,
the indices using Cohen ’s weighted kappa revealed moderate to
almost perfect agreement for 65 items, while 12 itemsdemonstrated fair agreement. This suggests that there is a certainlevel of agreement between the items, but there is still room forimprovement, and the questionnaire should undergo further
psychometric evaluations. The indices using ICCs indicated poor
agreement for only one subscale, Irritation Present. The observedvariations may be attributed to respondent fatigue as the length ofthe questionnaire could potentially impact participants ’level of
engagement and attention (Cohen, Manion & Morrison, 2018 ).
Another factor that could contribute to the variations in responsesis the potential differences in the experience of misophoniasymptoms between T1 and T2. It is known that misophonia
symptoms can change over time (Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ) and
may potentially be in ﬂuenced by factors such as stress levels
(Frank & McKay, 2019 ). These factors could have contributed to
the observed discrepancies in participants ’responses, which are
also evident in the statistical analyses, including Cohen ’s
weighted kappa and ICCs. This study is the ﬁrst to examine the
test–retest reliability of the BMQ-R. The results suggest that the
BMQ-R-NOR demonstrates adequate test –retest reliability,
indicating its potential for reliable use over time.
Based on our ﬁndings, the questionnaire has potential
applications across various domains including clinical practiceand research in the ﬁeld of misophonia. Clinically, it can be
utilized for diagnosing misophonia, assessing the severity ofsymptoms, tailoring treatment plans, and evaluating theeffectiveness of interventions/treatment. In research, it can be avaluable instrument for investigating prevalence, risk factors, and
outcomes related to misophonia.
Limitations
When interpreting the study ﬁndings, it is important to consider
several limitations. First, the sampling method, which involvedrecruiting participants from social media and clinics, may limitthe generalizability of the results to the broader Norwegian
population. Second, the study had a lower-than-expected number
of participants, which hindered the execution of con ﬁ
rmatory
factor analyses and limited the ability to compare the results withthe original BMQ-R study by Remmert, Schmidt, et al (2022 ) and
Remmert, Jebens, et al (2022 ). The small sample size resulted inTable 4. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) assessing the test –retest reliability

elevated standard errors and wider con ﬁdence intervals, which
may increase the uncertainty of our ﬁndings and warrant careful
consideration when interpreting the results. Third, the samplepredominantly consisted of females, with only a small proportionof male participants (14.6%). While this gender imbalance may
not have directly in ﬂuenced the study ’sﬁndings, it affects the
comparability of results between genders. Last, the utilization ofthe MQ-NOR as the sole instrument for validation raises concernsabout its appropriateness for assessing the BMQ-R-NOR.Although our ﬁndings provide initial evidence for valid
conclusions regarding broader misophonic symptoms, it isimportant to acknowledge that the MQ-NOR may not be theoptimal instrument for this purpose. Hence, future research should
consider incorporating a broader range of convergent measures to
further validate the BMQ-R-NOR and ensure its robustness acrossvarious contexts and populations. Particularly, efforts to recruitparticipants from clinical settings alongside those from socialmedia platforms could enhance the representativeness of thesample and strengthen the generalizability of ﬁndings.
Additionally, inclusion of a control group in future studies wouldprovide valuable comparative data, allowing for more rigorous
examination of the speci ﬁcity and sensitivity of the BMQ-R-NOR
in distinguishing misophonia from other disorders.
CONCLUSION
The present study has demonstrated that the BMQ-R-NOR
exhibits overall satisfactory psychometric properties, includingadequate internal consistency and test –retest reliability.
Additionally, most subscales of the BMQ-R-NOR have
demonstrated moderate to high correlations with the MQ-NOR,indicating initial evidence of convergent validity. The non-signiﬁcant correlation of the subscale Behavioral Dysregulation
and the MQ-NOR Severity Scale questions the convergentvalidity. The BMQ-R-NOR serves as a valuable tool for assessingvarious aspects of misophonia in Norway, providing a morecomprehensive questionnaire option. However, it is important to
acknowledge the limitations of this study, and further extensive
validation is recommended. Clinicians in Norway should thereforeexercise caution when using the BMQ-R-NOR in their practice.
