SUMMARY
Synaptic conﬁgurations underpin how the nervous system processes sensory information to produce a
behavioral response. This is best understood for chemical synapses, and we know far less about how elec-
trical synaptic conﬁgurations modulate sensory information processing and context-speciﬁc behaviors. Wediscovered that innexin 1 (INX-1), a gap junction protein that forms electrical synapses, is required to deploycontext-speciﬁc behavioral strategies underlying thermotaxis behavior in C. elegans . Within this well-deﬁned
circuit, INX-1 couples two bilaterally symmetric interneurons to integrate sensory information during migra-tory behavior across temperature gradients. In inx-1 mutants, uncoupled interneurons display increased
excitability and responses to subthreshold sensory stimuli due to increased membrane resistance andreduced membrane capacitance, resulting in abnormal responses that extend run durations and trap the an-
imals in context-irrelevant tracking of isotherms. Thus, a conserved conﬁguration of electrical synapses en-
ables differential processing of sensory information to deploy context-speciﬁc behavioral strategies.
INTRODUCTION
Behavioral outputs rely on sensory information. Sensory infor-
mation can be differentially processed based on the conﬁgura-
tions of synapses in the circuit, enabling similar sensory stimuli
to elicit different behavioral strategies in context-dependent
manners.1–15This action selection16–18enables animals to avoid
deploying incompatible locomotory strategies in response to
similar sensory stimuli at behavioral choice points. While theimportance of action selection in behavioral choice strategies
is well recognized,
16–18the synaptic conﬁgurations that support
action selection are not well understood.
Dissecting action selection mechanisms at a circuit level re-
quires (1) deriving predictable choice points for a given behav-
ioral paradigm, (2) knowing the circuit substrates underlyingthe behavioral choice points, and (3) understanding sensory
input processing and locomotory strategy selection at the
behavioral choice points. C. elegans thermotaxis behavior
19pro-
vides a tractable model to interrogate the circuitry and synapticbases of action selection. C. elegans does not have an innate
preferred temperature and instead learns to prefer the tempera-
ture at which it was cultivated in the presence of food (called‘‘cultivation temperature,’’ or T
c).19When in a temperaturegradient, animals perform two behavioral strategies to reach
and stay within learned T c: migrating across the gradient to arrive
at T c(gradient migration) and tracking the isotherms upon
encountering T c(isothermal tracking) ( Figure 1 ; Hedgecock
and Russel19). Isothermal tracking occurs within ±2/C14C from
Tc,22and wild-type animals placed in a temperature gradient
away from this T crange will ﬁrst perform gradient migration,
and they will then change their behavioral strategy to isotherm-
oriented runs in part via the suppression of turns upon encoun-tering the T
crange ( Figures 1 A and 1E; Luo et al.22).
Because the action selection switch between gradient migra-
tion and isothermal tracking occurs within the temperature win-dow at which the animal was cultivated (T
crange), thermotaxis
behavior provides an assay in which the behavioral choice point
is both predictable and quantiﬁable. Importantly, the speciﬁcneurons that underlie thermotaxis behavior have been identiﬁed
via neuronal ablation and behavioral genetic studies ( Figure S1 A;

rons in this circuit produces defects in both isothermal tracking
and gradient migration,11,23–27 ,41,42indicating shared circuitry

this circuit inﬂuence the processing of thermosensory information

RESULTS
Mutant allele ola375 displays abnormal persistence in
isotherm-oriented runs
To uncover circuits that underpin action selection mechanisms,
we performed behavioral genetic experiments in C. elegans .W e
used traditional thermotaxis assays42as well as an adapted ther-
motaxis assay designed to enrich for the quantiﬁcation of
isothermal tracking and gradient migration in a population ofisogenic animals ( Figures 1 A, 1B, 1E, and 1F). Individual animals
were placed in speciﬁc regions of a temperature gradient with
respect to their preferred temperature goal (16
/C14C for Figures
1A–1C; 20/C14C for Figures 1 E–1G), and the locomotory trajectories
were recorded, segmented, and quantiﬁed while they performed
gradient migration and isothermal tracking ( Figures 1 and S1).
Consistent with previous reports,22wild-type C. elegans spent
about /C2412% of their total time on the assaying arena performing
isothermal tracking when within ±2/C14C of their preferred temper-
ature, with each isothermal run lasting an average of 65 s ( Fig-
ures 1 B, 1F, 1H, and S1B). Distribution of the durations of
isothermal track events followed an exponential decay with a
time constant of 49.6 s and a half-life of 34.4 s ( Figure 1 I; Luo
et al.22).
To identify molecules that underlie behavioral choice, we per-
formed an unbiased forward-genetic screen for animals that out-performed wild-type animals in isothermal tracking, irrespectiveof their preferred temperature, and isolated allele ola375 (Figures
1C, 1G, 1H, S1B, and S1C). The genetic lesion in ola375 animals
does not affect their temperature preference (as assayed by theircapacity to migrate toward their learned cultivation temperature)
but displayed defects in abnormally deploying isothermal
tracking at temperatures in which the animal would normallybe performing gradient migration ( Figures 1 A–1C, 1E–1G, S1B,
and S1C). ola375 -mutant animals spent /C2434% of their timetracking isotherms, almost three times that of their wild-type
counterparts ( Figures 1 H and S1B). Moreover, the average run
duration of the isothermal track for ola375 -mutant animals was
140.5 s, more than doubling the wild-type average. The distribu-tion of their isothermal run durations still followed an exponential
decay ( Figure 1 I), but the decay rate was two times slower than
that of the wild type, with a time constant of 120.1 s and a half-lifeof 83.2 s. The distributions of run durations for isotherm-orientedruns were consistently higher across temperature gradients in
ola375 -mutant animals compared with wild-type animals ( Fig-
ure 1 J), with the difference being larger near T
c. The number of
isotherm-oriented runs initiated was inﬂuenced by the distance
from their preferred temperature in both the wild type and the
ola375 mutants ( Figure 1 K). A previous study reported that the
wild type performing isothermal tracking ‘‘strongly suppresses
the occurrence of abrupt reorientation maneuvers,’’ displaying
a 1.25% likelihood of terminating a run by reorientation, incontrast to the 5% likelihood of termination seen during gradientmigration.
22Similarly, we observed that wild-type animals per-
forming isotherms displayed 1.65% likelihood of terminating a
run. In contrast, ola375 animals displayed 0.7% likelihood of ter-
minating a run, less than half of that seen in wild-type animals
performing isotherms. ola375 animals also displayed fewer
omega turns, as compared with wild-type animals ( Figures
S1D and S1E). Together, our data indicate that ola375 animals
spent signiﬁcantly more time than wild-type animals in iso-
therm-oriented runs.
The ola375 allele carries a mutation in inx-1 , encoding a
gap junction protein that forms electrical synapses
Genetic characterization of the ola375 allele revealed it
behaved as a recessive single locus lesion. To identify the ge-
netic lesion resulting in the behavioral defects of ola375 ani-
mals, we performed positional mapping and whole-genomesequencing.
43–46These strategies revealed a missense muta-
tion and a small insertion-deletion, resulting in an early STOP
codon in the ﬁfth coding exon of the gene for innexin 1(INX-1) ( Figures 1 D and S1F). Three additional lines of evidence
support that ola375 is a recessive loss-of-function allele of
inx-1 . First, if ola375 corresponds to inx-1 , we would expect
other alleles of inx-1 to display similar defects in thermotaxis
behaviors. We examined two available alleles ( inx-1(tm3524)
and inx-1(gk580946) alleles) and observed that they phenocop-
ied the ola375 allele in the behavioral defects during thermo-
taxis ( Figure 1 E). Second, if ola375 corresponds to inx-1 ,w e
would expect a transheterozygote consisting of the ola375
allele and inx-1(tm3524) to display behavioral defects during
thermotaxis (in other words, we could expect inx-1(tm3524)
to fail to complement the ola375 allele). Consistent with this,

we observed that inx-1(tm3524) failed to complement ola375
alleles ( Figures S1 G–S1I), suggesting that the tm3524 and
ola375 alleles correspond to genetic lesions within the same
gene, inx-1 . Third, if ola375 corresponds to inx-1 , we would
expect transgenic expression of wild-type inx-1 genomic DNA
to rescue the thermotaxis behavioral phenotype of inx-
1(tm3524) mutants, which we observed ( Figure 2 A).INX-1 is a member of the innexin family of proteins, which is
functionally and topologically related to vertebrate conne-
xins.49–54Connexins can form gap junctions in vertebrates,
and innexins do so in invertebrates.50,51,55–62InC. elegans,
inx-1 is expressed in neurons and body wall muscles.63,64It con-
tributes to the electrical coupling of body wall muscle cells65and
synchrony of neuronal activities during rhythmic behavior.66,67

INX-1 functions in AIY interneurons to suppress context-
irrelevant isothermal tracking
Rescue experiments with inx-1 , using different lengths of the
inx-1 promoter, revealed that expression of wild-type inx-1 in
inx-1(tm3524) mutants under the control of a 2.5-kb but not a
1.5-kb promoter sequence (upstream of the inx-1 translation
initiation site) could rescue the mutant behavior ( Figures 2 and
S2). To identify the neurons where INX-1 acts to regulate the
thermotaxis behavior strategies, we expressed GFP under the
control of the Pinx-1(2.5 kb) promoter fragment ( Figure 2 B) and
mCherry under the Pinx-1(1.5 kb) (Figure 2 C) fragment, respec-
tively, and used a subtractive strategy to identify the neurons
in which inx-1 is likely required for rescue ( Figures 2 B–2E and
S2A). This strategy identiﬁed four pairs of neurons that were de-
tected with the longer (rescuing) but not the shorter Pinx-1 pro-
moter fragment: AIYs, RIMs, RIGs, and an unidentiﬁed amphid
neuron. To determine whether only one speciﬁc pair of theseneurons is required for the inx-1 function, we generated cell-spe-
ciﬁc conditional knockout strains by ﬂanking the inx-1 gene with
loxP sites ( Figure 2 B; Dickinson et al.
68) and expressing Cre69in
the candidate neurons by using cell-speciﬁc promoters ( Pttx-3G
for AIY, Pcex-1 for RIM, and Pceh-16 for RIG). We observed that
knockout of inx-1 in AIYs (but not in other neurons, including RIM
and RIGs) recapitulated the aberrant action selection phenotypeobserved in inx-1 mutants ( Figure 2 F). Consistent with this, AIY-
speciﬁc expression of wild-type inx-1 abrogated the isothermal
tracking phenotype of the inx-1(tm3524) mutants. The expres-
sion of wild-type inx-1 in AIY also caused an abnormal gradient
migration phenotype, presumably from inx-1 overexpression
(Figures 2 C–2F; Hawk et al.
70).
INX-1 electrical synapses between AIYs serve to
dampen excitatory inputsThe AIY neuron class consists of two bilaterally symmetric inter-
neurons that are required for proper thermal gradient migration
and isothermal tracking.
11,22–24 ,31,42,71,72They are the only
known chemical postsynaptic partners to the bilateral pair of
thermosensory neurons, AFDs (White et al.32and Witvliet
et al.73;Figure S1 A). AIY also forms electrical synapses onto
interneuron RIM, and this electrical synapse is necessary forpersistent neural activity and sustained behavioral patterns.
74
Electron microscopy studies of the C. elegans connectome
have also predicted an electrical synapse between the twoAIYs at their synaptic regions,
32but the physiological function
and molecular composition of these structures remain unknown.
Since cell-speciﬁc knockout of inx-1 in RIM did not restore the
inx-1- mutant phenotypes ( Figure 2 F), we focused our analyses
on AIY and investigated how loss of inx-1 affected AIY respo-
nses, whether the AIY pair is electrically coupled, and whetherthis coupling relies on INX-1.
To answer these questions, we used transgenic animals ex-
pressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6 in
AIY and assessed the effect of depolarizing one AIY (referredto as the voltage-clamped AIY [AIY
c]) on the calcium dynamics
of both AIY cand the unclamped AIY (AIY uc). We depolarized
from /C060 to +40 mV for 1, 3, or 20 s and quantiﬁed the calcium
signal within a region known as zone 2 ( Figure 3 A),75where the
two AIYs have been shown to respond to thermal stimuli27,70and have exhibited, by EM, morphologically deﬁned gap junc-
tions between them.32In response to the voltage step, calcium
signals increased in both AIYs of wild-type animals ( Figures
3B, 3C, and S3). In contrast, in inx-1(gk580946) -mutant animals,
only AIY cresponded, with the difference in the ratio of AIY uc/AIY c
calcium intensity being statistically signiﬁcant for the voltagesteps of 3- and 20-s durations ( Figures 3 B, 3C, S3B, and S3D).
The calcium signal ratio of the AIY pair (unclamped overclamped) during the depolarizing voltage step (+40 mV) was
0.85±0.06 in the wild type and 0.19 ±0.05 in the inx-1 mutants
(Figure 3 D), indicating that INX-1 is required for the activation of
AIY
uc. The calcium signal of AIY ucremained quiet prior to the
voltage step (while AIY cwas held at /C060 mV) in all wild-type an-
imals, but it ﬂuctuated in four of six inx-1(gk580946) -mutant an-
imals ( Figure 3 A). These results indicate that the hyperpolarizing
voltage ( /C060 mV) could effectively silence the calcium activity of
both AIYs in wild-type animals, but only in AIY cininx-1 mutants,
further suggesting that the two AIYs are electrically coupled byINX-1 gap junctions.
Considering that INX-1 forms electrical synapses between the
two AIYs, we explored how the absence of these electrical syn-apses might enhance isothermal tracking. To address this ques-
tion, we began by measuring the membrane resistance (R
m) and
membrane capacitance (C m) of AIY. In wild-type animals, the
observed responses of AIY to current injections were consistent
with those previously reported (membrane voltage responses to
positive current injections were smaller than those to negativecurrent injections).
76We then examined inx-1 mutants and
observed a signiﬁcant increase in R mand a substantial reduction
in C mininx-1(tm3524) mutants, compared with the wild type
(Figures 4 A–4C). As R mrelies on membrane conductance, and
Cmis directly proportional to the cell membrane area, our results
support the idea that the measured R mand C mvalues reﬂect the
contributions of both AIYs in the wild type but only one AIY in theinx-1 mutant. We predicted that the increased R
mand reduced
Cmwould make AIY neurons hyperresponsive to applied stimuli.
Indeed, when we injected current into one AIY, it induced greaterchanges in membrane voltage of that same AIY in the inx-1
mutant, as compared with the wild type ( Figure 4 D). Collectively,
these ﬁndings suggest that gap junctions may serve to dampenAIY responses to sensory inputs by shunting excitatory currents.This conﬁguration is reminiscent to that of electrical synapses
in amacrine cells of the retina and midbrain mesencephalic tri-
geminal nucleus neurons (MesV), in which electrical synapsesdampen responses, resulting in reduced noise during sensory
processing.
78–81Together, our ﬁndings suggest that disrupting
coupling between the bilaterally symmetric AIYs enhances indi-vidual AIY responses, making them hyperresponsive to sensory
stimuli.
AIY sensitization in inx-1 -mutant animals increases
response frequency to small temperature changes
AIY activity is known to regulate animal locomotion by suppress-ing turns to induce and sustain bouts of forward movement, or
‘‘runs’’
35–40 ,82. During isothermal tracking, animals strongly sup-
press reorientation maneuvers to persist in runs.22Since this
phenotype is abnormally enhanced in inx-1 mutants ( Figures 1
and S1), we hypothesized that in inx-1 -mutant animals, thell

uncoupled and hyperresponsive AIY interneurons might display
an increased probabilistic response rate to sensory stimuli,
including to small-scale changes in temperatures (like thoseexperienced by the animals tracking isotherms). The hyperres-ponsiveness in AIYs might therefore result in suppressed turns
and sustained runs during the small temperature ﬂuctuations
that animals experience during isotherms.
To examine this hypothesis, we ﬁrst determined the tempera-
ture experiences of animals performing isothermal tracking
versus gradient migration by modeling (1) head bends, by ﬁttinga sinusoidal function to positional measurements of the nose of
an animal as it freely navigates a temperature gradient ( Figures5A and S4A), and (2) bouts of forward movement, by recording
the speed of animals as they move directly up a temperature
gradient and ﬁtting the data with a lognormal distribution(Figures 5 A, 5B, and S4B). Our calculations indicate that animals
performing isothermal tracking under our experimental condi-
tions experience oscillations, with each head bend, deviating ±
0.011
/C14C from the absolute temperature being tracked. This
result is consistent with the known AFD temperature limit of
0.01/C14C22,33,34and consistent with previous estimates for experi-
enced temperatures during isothermal tracking.22Therefore, an
animal performing a perfect isotherm in our experimental condi-
tions will experience a net temperature change of 0.022/C14C for

each completed head bend, but over time, as it tracks the
isotherm, the integrated net change in temperature would bezero. In contrast, during the same head-bend period of 3 s, ani-
mals moving up the gradient (at median speed) experience an in-
crease in temperature of 0.03
/C14C(Figure 5 B), and in a period of 10
s, they will experience temperature changes that are an order of
magnitude larger than the largest temperature change experi-
enced by an animal performing isothermal tracking ( Figure 5 B).
Based on our model and the known probabilistic nature of AIY
responses upon AFD activation (during increases of temperat-ure),34we hypothesized that AIY activation might be signiﬁcantly
different in inx-1 -mutant animals, compared with wild-type ani-
mals, particularly under conditions of small-scale temperature
changes such as those seen during isothermal tracking.
To test this hypothesis, we imaged calcium dynamics of both
AIYs in immobilized wild-type and inx-1 -mutant animals after
conditioning them at 20/C14C for several hours and presenting
them with oscillating temperature stimuli (every 4.1 s) centeredaround 20
/C14C (with an amplitude of ±0.01/C14C) (Figure 5 C). In the
wild type, calcium transients occurred at a low rate of 0.020 Hz

(one response every /C2450 s). These responses in the wild type
were often concurrent in the two AIYs, with a Pearson’s correla-
tion coefﬁcient of 0.72 ( Figures 5 C, 5D, and S4C). In contrast,
calcium transients occurred at a signiﬁcantly higher frequencyof 0.031 Hz (or one response every /C2432 s) and were more asyn-
chronous (Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient of 0.36 between the
two AIYs) in inx-1(tm3524) -mutant animals, as compared with
the wild type ( Figures 5 C, 5D, and S4C;Videos S1 and S2).
Our ﬁndings support a model in which the uncoupled AIYs in
inx-1 mutants respond more frequently than those in wild-type
animals to changes in temperature, including small-magnitudetemperature changes like those seen during isothermal tracking.
In combination with previous ﬁndings that determined that
activation of AIY sustains forward movement runs,
35–40 ,82our
data support a model in which inx-1 -mutant animals are ‘‘trap-
ped’’ in long runs in response to subthreshold sensory stimuli, re-
sulting in increased isothermal tracking behavior ( Figure 5 E). Our
model predicts that inx-1 animals would perform longer runs un-
der all conditions, including those outside of a temperature
gradient, as AIY would also become activated by sensory stimuli
and lock animals in runs (but not in isotherms, as they would notbe in a temperature gradient). To test this, we performed run
dispersion assays in an arena without a temperature gradient
(in these assays, AIY responses are still expected due to existingpresynaptic inputs and sensory stimuli, including those from
chemosensory neurons that directly innervate AIY
32). Consistent
with our hypothesis, we observed that inx-1(ola375) mutants per-
formed signiﬁcantly longer runs, as compared with wild-type an-
imals ( Figure S4 D).
Expression of Cx36 just in AIYs suppresses context-
irrelevant isothermal tracking in inx-1 mutants
Innexins can form homotypic or heterotypic gap junctions be-tween neighboring cells.
83Our loss-of-function experiments indi-
cate that INX-1 is necessary, cell speciﬁcally, in the AIYs to
couple these bilaterally symmetric interneurons. But the INX-1-dependent gap junction could be forming between the twoAIYs or onto other cells (such as RIM, which is also electrically
coupled to AIY
32,74). The question arises, is a gap junction be-
tween just the two AIYs sufﬁcient to explain the observed behav-ioral phenotypes? To address this, we introduced vertebrate con-
nexin 36 ( Cx36 ) speciﬁcally into AIYs of inx-1(tm3524) animals (byusing the cell-speciﬁc promoter fragment, Pttx-3G
77) and exam-
ined if reconstituting this heterologous gap junction was sufﬁcient
to suppress the electrophysiological and behavioral inx-1- mutant
phenotypes. Vertebrate connexins do not interact with theendogenous innexins, and introduction of Cx36 cell speciﬁcally
onto AIY would only couple the bilaterally symmetric AIYs.
84,85
We observed that expression of Cx36 speciﬁcally on AIYs sup-
pressed the signiﬁcant increase in R mand the reduction in C m
ininx-1(tm3424) mutants, restoring them to wild-type levels
(Figures 4 A–4D). Moreover, the transgenic animals expressing
Cx36 speciﬁcally in the AIY interneurons exhibited a signiﬁcant
decrease in the time spent on isothermal tracking, compared
with the original inx-1(tm3524) mutant ( Figure 4 E). These results
provide further support to the idea that the abnormal thermotaxisbehavior of the inx-1 mutants speciﬁcally results from the loss of
electrical coupling between the two AIYs.
DISCUSSION
We uncovered a speciﬁc conﬁguration of electrical synapses
which is necessary in vivo for context-dependent action selec-
tion. These electrical synapses form between bilaterally symmet-
ric AIY interneurons to decrease R
mand increase C m, which in
turn dampen the effects of subthreshold excitatory synaptic in-puts onto AIYs. The bilateral coupling of the AIY interneurons is
necessary for animals to ‘‘ﬁlter’’ sensory information of sub-
threshold magnitude and for the animal to suppress isothermsto correctly migrate across the temperature gradients toward
its preferred temperature. INX-1 has been previously shown as
necessary for the execution of rhythmic behavior regulated bythe AVL and DVB neurons. These two neurons are coupled via
an INX-1-dependent electrical synapse that synchronizes their
presynaptic terminals and inhibits their ectopic activation be-tween rhythmic cycles.
66Our ﬁndings are consistent with these
roles of inx-1 in inhibiting ectopic responses and extend them to
demonstrate that in AIYs this coupling is necessary to inhibit acti-vation in response to subthreshold sensory stimuli. Uncoupledinterneurons in the inx-1 mutants result in hyperresponsive
AIYs that trap animals in context-irrelevant isotherms, affecting
correct action selection during thermotaxis behavior.
AIY calcium activity is required to initiate and sustain a
forward-moving run in multiple behavioral contexts.

(E) Schematic model of AFD to AIY signaling, and resulting behavior, in wild type versus inx-1 mutants. In wild-type animals, coupled AIYs have lower resistance,
which would result in dampened responses to thermosensory stimuli coming from AFD. These dampened responses enable AIYs to integrate larger changes of
thermosensory information as animals perform gradient migration. In inx-1 mutants, uncoupled AIYs are hyperexcitable due to a change in their electrophysi-
ological properties resulting from the uncoupling. This hyperexcitability results in AIYs responding to subthreshold sensory signals. Activatio n of AIY initiates and
sustains a forward-moving run,35–40and their hyperresponsiveness to subthreshold stimuli would result in a higher probability of animals abnormally persisting in
isotherms.See also Figure S4 .ll

ﬁndings support a model in which the probability of AIY activa-
tion accounts for the behavioral differences observed between
the wild type and the inx-1 mutants. In wild-type animals, AIYs
have a low level of activity at the initiation of an isotherm-orientedrun far away from their preferred temperature. The absence of
activity would result in the probabilistic exit from the isothermal
orientation via the execution of a reversal or pirouette,
22,39
thereby ending the run and reorienting the animal in a different
direction. However, hyperresponsive AIYs in inx-1 mutants
would be activated by stimuli that are subthreshold for AIY acti-
vation in wild-type animals. The hyperresponsiveness of AIYs ininx-1 mutants would lead to the persistence of isotherm-oriented
runs and for animals to be ‘‘trapped’’ in this behavioral state.
Wild-type animals also track isotherms, but unlike inx-1 mu-
tants, this behavioral strategy is restricted to a temperature
context near ( ±2
/C14C) of their cultivation temperature (T c).11,19,22
Like inx-1 mutants, wild-type animals also suppress reorienta-
tions and turns to persist in runs during isotherms, but unlikeinx-1 mutants, they do so in the correct context (near T
c).22
We hypothesized that in the wild-type animals near T c, signal
gains in the AFD /AIY synapse lead to activation of AIY in
response to smaller temperature derivatives at the preferred
cultivation temperature to promote isothermal tracking perfor-
mance near T c. The gain of AFD /AIY could be achieved
via INX-1, which could serve as a regulatory switch for modu-
lating action selection in wild-type animals. In C. elegans ,
expression of innexins can be plastically regulated in aneuron-type and environment-speciﬁc manner.
64The open/
close states of electrical synapses can also be regulated by
other molecules or posttranslational modiﬁcations.57,60,86–90
We therefore posit that regulation of INX-1 may be a molecular
substrate that enables a plastic uncoupling of the AIY pair and
that this uncoupling could change sensory processing to ulti-
mately affect action selection.
Speciﬁc conﬁgurations of electrical synapses can support cir-
cuit architectures with unique properties, and the organization of
electrical synapses between the two AIYs might be a conservedand important conﬁguration in sensory processing. For example,
in vertebrates and invertebrates, a central hub neuron can be
electrically coupled to multiple input neurons to form hub-and-spoke circuits. Hub-and-spoke circuits can modulate integrationof sensory processing, perception, and behavioral respon-
ses.
91,92In AIY, coupling of this interneuron to motor neuron
RIM via an electrical synapse is important for encoding both tem-perature and motor-state information.
74In this study, we ﬁnd
another conﬁguration of electrical synapses, linking bilaterally
symmetric interneurons to alter their electrophysiological re-sponses and sensory processing. Most interneurons in C. ele-
gans are bilaterally symmetric and coupled via gap junctions,
32
and we speculate that this architecture might represent a circuit
motif by which the system modulates neural gain. Consistent
with this, in our previous study, we identiﬁed an electrical
coupling between right and left AVA locomotor interneurons,which equilibrates asymmetric synaptic inputs from inhibitoryGABAergic neurons to guide correct behavioral selection in
response to mixed threat and reward sensory cues.
93These
conﬁgurations are reminiscent of the gap junction organizationbetween amacrine cells in the retina. Amacrine cells are coupledby gap junctions that are critical for coincidence detection by
photoreceptors, noise reduction, and sensory processing during
light adaptation.
78–81Ininx-1 mutants, synchronous excitation
between the two AIY pairs is also lost and might also representa property of the circuit in performing coincidence detection,
which could then be important in noise reduction and sensory
processing of the temperature gradient, or its integration withother sensory responses. Together, our ﬁndings reveal a con-served electrical synapse conﬁguration that might confer circuits
the ability to deploy context-dependent plastic responses by dy-
namically modulating sensory information processing, therebyincreasing the versatility of neural circuits during sensory stimuli.
Limitations of the study
In this study, we uncovered a role for INX-1 in AIY in regulating its
electrophysiological properties to modulate sensory processing
and action selection. While our cell-speciﬁc knockouts of INX-1in AIY show that INX-1 is necessary in AIY for the observed phe-
notypes, and our expression of Cx36 in AIY of inx-1 mutants
demonstrate that an electrical synapse between the two AIYsis sufﬁcient to reverse the inx-1 phenotypes, our experiments
do not exclude the possible requirement of other innexins that
might pair with INX-1 in forming the electrical synapse betweenthe two AIYs.
Our ﬁndings provide a molecular foothold to understand how
action selection in the thermotaxis behavioral paradigm mighthappen in wild-type animals, but our study focused on under-standing inx-1 mutants and did not examine its molecular
regulation in wild-type animals or the changes wild-type ani-
mals undergo when performing isothermal tracking. Whilewe speculate that INX-1 might be a substrate for regulation
in wild-type animals, this needs to be empirically tested. We
also emphasize that there could be other ways beyond theregulation of INX-1 electrical synapses, which could affect sen-
sory processing in the AFD /AIY synapse and which would
be consistent with our results, including presynaptic facilitationor increased responses of AFD near the cultivation tempera-
ture range.
Our ﬁndings demonstrate a role for INX-1 in modulating R
m
and C min AIY, as well as its responses to sensory stimuli. While
it is known that activation of AIYs results in suppression of turns
and forward movement,38the link between increased AIY activity
observed in inx-1 mutants and forward movement is based on
the untested assumption that activation of a single AIY inter-
neuron is sufﬁcient to result in forward movement. INX-1 couples
the two AIYs, and coupling of the AIYs might contribute to coin-cidence detection. Coincidence detection could occur from sig-
nals from the two AFD sensory neurons or from other sensory
neurons known to form presynaptic specializations onto AIYs(including chemosensory neurons AWA, AWC, and ASE).

C. elegans crawls on its side (ﬂexing in a dorsoventral direction),
and in our assays (performed in ﬂat plates), the bilaterally sym-
metric AFDs are sampling the same thermal space of thegradient. However, C. elegans evolved to navigate a 3D environ-
ment, and in that context, the two AFD neurons might sample
different thermal spaces in ways in which coincidence detec-tion would be important for tracking 3D isotherms. Future behav-
ioral studies examining responses in freely moving animals,ll

preferably in 3D environments, will be necessary for understand-
ing the role of coincidence detection proceeding from AFD or
other sensory neurons in these responses.
Despite these limitations of the study, our data support the
following mode: electrical coupling of the AIY interneurons via
INX-1 electrical synapses is necessary for animals to ‘‘ignore’’
isotherms in contexts in which they perform gradient migration.Ininx-1 mutants, AIY interneurons are uncoupled, displaying
increased excitability due to increased R
mand reduced C m.
This causes AIY to respond to the subthreshold sensory stimuli
like those encountered during isotherms. Because stimulationof AIY suppresses turns and promotes runs, this excitability
would cause extended run durations and ‘‘trap’’ animals in iso-
therms, including isothermal runs in the incorrect contexts. Theobserved conﬁguration of electrical synapses might be a
conserved circuit conﬁguration that enables differential process-
ing of sensory information to deploy context-speciﬁc behavioralstrategies.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND STUDY PARTICIPANT DETAILS
C. elegans
Nematodes were regularly maintained at room temperature (20-23/C14C) or inside Precision 815 (Thermo Scientiﬁc) or I-36NL (Percival
Scientiﬁc) incubators at 20/C14C, grown on bacterial lawns of Escherichia coli strain OP50 seeded onto Nematode Growth Medium, ac-
cording to husbandry standards.98One-day adult hermaphrodite worms were used in all experiments unless otherwise noted. The
N2Bristol strain was used as the wild-type background. See the key resources table for a complete list of the strains used in this study.
METHOD DETAILSMolecular biology
Plasmids were generated using Gibson Assembly (New England Biolabs) or the multi-site Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). EitherPhusion or Q5 High-Fidelity DNA-polymerase (NEB) were used for cloning or subcloning elements into the Gateway entry vectors.
Cell-speciﬁc promoter fragments were ampliﬁed from genomic DNA or preexisting plasmids and introduced into pENTR41 orpENTR
50-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen); CDS of interest were inserted into pDONR221[1-2] (Invitrogen); and preexisting 3’UTR regions of
commonly used genes ( unc-54, let-858 ) into pDONR221[2-3] were used. Every insert was sequenced in their respective entry vector
prior to the four-component LR recombination to generate the ﬁnal expression plasmid.

Nematode Strains and maintenanceNematodes were regularly maintained at room temperature (20-23
/C14C) or inside Precision 815 (Thermo Scientiﬁc) or I-36NL (Percival
Scientiﬁc) incubators at 20/C14C, grown on bacterial lawns of Escherichia coli strain OP50 seeded onto Nematode Growth Medium, ac-
cording to husbandry standards.98One-day adult hermaphrodite worms were used in all experiments unless otherwise noted. The
N2Bristol strain was used as the wild-type background.
Genotyping of mutant strains
Adult worms were lysed following standard protocols and PCRs were performed using GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega, REF-M7123). Mutant alleles were distinguished from wild type by imaging Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLP) on an
agarose gel or by Sanger Sequencing performed by GENEWIZ (Azenta Life Sciences). The full set of genotyping primerscan be found
in the key resources table , and supplemental information sections.
For genotyping the inx-1(tm3524) X allele, the annealing temperature was 55
/C14C, and elongation 1 minute at 72/C14C. Ampliﬁed prod-
ucts were run on a 2% agarose gel. Homozygous wild type produces 542bp & 159bp bands, while homozygous inx-1(tm3524) X pro-
duces a single 304bp band, and a heterozygous inx-1(+/tm3524) X will produce three bands at 542bp, 304bp & 159bp.
Forinx-1 exome sequencing, annealing temperature was 55/C14C, elongation time 1 minute and 15 seconds at 72/C14C. Resulting prod-
ucts were sent out for Sanger Sequencing performed by GENEWIZ (Azenta Life Sciences). Products are 576bp, 982bp, 994bp and
250bp for each respective exome primer sets.
Generation of transgenic strains
Transgenic C. elegans strains were generated by microinjection of the plasmids of interest into the gonad syncytia following standard
approaches.100Transgenic lines were selected and maintained based on the expression of one or multiple of the followingContinued

T6137 ), following standard methods. For a full list of strains used and generated by this work, please refer to key resources table .
Sensitized forward-genetic screens
To unbiasedly ﬁnd new genes that might regulate or modulate the distinct thermotaxis gradient migration and isothermal tracking
behaviors, forward-genetic screens were performed on pkc-1(nj1) loss-of-function mutants (strain IK105 in key resources table ),
which perform constitutively thermophilic behaviors. This screen resulted in recovery of ola375 . In addition to suppressing the
pkc-1(nj1) mutant phenotype of migrating up a shallow temperature gradient regardless of their preferred trained temperature,101
these animals tracked isotherms more often, and further away from their preferred temperature. We mapped the causative lesion
to a 5 Mb region in Chromosome X (genomic position /C243Mb to /C248Mb) by Hawaiian SNP mapping43and Whole-Genome Sequencing
(WGS)44,45making use of the CloudMap pipeline.46Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) was performed by the Yale Center for
Genome Analysis (YCGA).
Identiﬁcation of ola375 causative lesions
We further characterized the causative molecular lesion of ola375 by ﬁne mapping using SNPs present in the divergent, Hawaiian
wild-type strain ( CB4856 )43and outcrossing SNPs with the reference N2 wild-type strain. When recombinants with wild-type DNA
regions within the 5Mb previously-mapped region were recovered, from either the 3Mb or the 8Mb ﬂank, both the suppressingpkc-1(nj1) phenotype and the isothermal ‘‘hypertracking’’ phenotype were greatly diminished. Further analysis of the behavioral phe-
notypes, in combination with underlying molecular lesions in that region, led us to identify a mutant allele for gap junction innexin gene
inx-1(ola375) , which was exclusively responsible for the isothermal ‘‘hypertracking’’ phenotype under a wild-type background. This
genetic lesion consists on both a missense SNP and a small indel in the ﬁfth coding exon, resulting in an early STOP codon (see
Figure1 D;Figure S1 ;supplemental information ). We established that inx-1(ola375) is the causative lesion to the isothermal tracking
defects detected in this screen via four approaches: 1) examining additional alleles of inx-1, namely tm3524 andgk580946 , and deter-
mining that they phenocopy the behavioral phenotypes (persistent isothermal tracking) observed for inx-1(ola375) ; 2) performing
complementation tests to allele tm3524 and determining that inx-1(ola375) fails to completement the observed behavioral pheno-
types; 3) performing genetic rescue experiments with a genomic region of inx-1 and observing that is sufﬁcient to rescue the behav-ioral phenotypes and 4) performing conditional knock-out experiments and observing that cell-speciﬁc knockouts of inx-1 in the AIY
interneurons are sufﬁcient to reconstitute the observed behavioral phenotype for inx-1(ola375) .
Generation of ‘‘ﬂoxed’’ inx-1(ola278) for conditional Knock-Out experiments
We inserted LoxP sites ﬂanking the endogenous inx-1 genomic coding locus via the CRISPR-based, genomic edition protocol

30LoxP insertion ( Figure S1 F). Complete inserted sequence can be found in Data S1 .
Complementation Assays
To obtain inx-1(tm3524)/ola375 transheterozygous animals, inx-1(tm3524) males that have coelomocytes tagged with GFP (see key
resources table ) were crossed with ola375 hermaphrodites. From the progeny, hermaphrodites possessing the marker were picked
in L4 stage for running behavioral assays at 0.8/C14C/cm gradient.
Thermotaxis Behavioral Assays
For all behavior experiments, the animals’ developmental stage was synchronized by either allowing gravid adults to lay eggs in a
seeded plate for two hours, three days prior to the assay or by picking L4 animals – identiﬁed by the clear half-moon patch in the
midsection of the animal – the day before the experiment. The plates were then kept in Precision 815 (Thermo Scientiﬁc) orI-36NL (Percival Scientiﬁc) incubators at 20
/C14C up to the time of the experiment for experiments with a cultivation temperature of
20/C14C, or shifted to the appropriate temperature 4-6 hours prior to testing, in the case of temperature shift assays. Behavioral analyses
were performed as described previously.42,70A population of synchronized one-day adult hermaphrodites were picked onto an un-
seeded plate and washed in M9.1023-5 worms were then transferred by micropipette on a 3 ml M9 droplet to the respective starting
points on the assay plates,103equilibrated for 5-10 min, and they were allowed to freely crawl on the arena for 30-60 min, acquiring
images at 2fps with a MightEx BCE-B050-U camera. Nematode tracks were identiﬁed from the collected images using theMagatAnalyzer software package with modiﬁcations as previously indicated.

Shallow gradients for Gradient Migration Quantiﬁcation
The original suppressor screen was performed on equipment previously described,42,70monitoring nematode gradient migration in
the presence of a shallow temperature gradient (0.18/C14C/cm). Brieﬂy, two pairs of thermoelectric components controlled by two Ac-
cuthermo FTC100D PID controllers sit at either side of an aluminum slab, and generate a deﬁned linear temperature gradient. The
system is cooled by a closed refrigeration system connected to a liquid cooling radiator in contact with dry ice. The aluminumslab in turn contacts a square assay plate (Corning /C226) with a 224 x 224 mm internal arena where the worms will perform. To ensurell

efﬁcient heat transfer between the slab and the arena, either a volume of glycerol was used, or a ﬁtted smaller aluminum sheet was
intercalated between the aluminum slab and the assay plate. Red LEDs parallel to the plate generate a dark background image with
bright outlines of the nematodes, captured by a MightEx camera (BCE-B050-U) above, at 2 frames per second, for 30-60 min. The
whole system is encased in a modiﬁed cabinet. Unless otherwise explicitly noted, the gradient of the arena goes from 18/C14Ct o2 2/C14C,
and animals are placed in the middle of the arena, near 20/C14C. 24-33 animals are tested per assay.
Moderate and steep gradients for Isothermal Tracking Quantiﬁcation
C. elegans perform maximal isothermal tracking behavior at /C240.6/C14C/cm gradients or higher.22To generate these gradients, we used a
modiﬁed, smaller version of the equipment described above and previously,42,70kindly gifted to us by Aravi Samuel (Harvard Univer-
sity). Unless otherwise explicitly noted, the gradient on the arena is centered on 20/C14C and goes from 17/C14Ct o2 3/C14C for 0.6/C14C/cm
gradient and 16/C14Ct o2 4/C14C for 0.8/C14C/cm gradient. For the classical assay placement, 9 animals in 3 droplets were placed along
the 20C isothermal line in the middle of the arena. To quantitatively assess and adequately quantify isothermal tracking across
the full gradient, a population of animals is assayed by starting in an H conﬁguration, as shown in Figures 1 F and 1G (yellow start
sites). The ‘‘H-format’’ assay was intentionally developed to examine the choices of animals performing isotherms when they areplaced above, below or at T
cfor the examined genotypes. For an assessment of animals performing more isothermal tracking or un-
der the wrong context, four starting droplets at each respective edge of the gradient were used. 24–27 animals are tested per assay.
Dispersion Assays
L4 stage hermaphrodites were picked into a plate seeded with E. coli the day before the experiment, and kept overnight at 20/C14C.N o
less than 1 hour before the experiment, the plates were placed next to the assay arena to acclimate animals to ambient temperature.
Unlike for thermotaxis assays, in dispersion the heating and cooling units were turned off to not generate a predetermined temper-ature gradient. Animals were then washed in M9 buffer and unto an unseeded plate, and transferred into the 22x22cm agarose arena
in 3mL droplets, each with approximately 3 animals. Animals were distributed in the arena as to avoid collisions (in the top left, bottom
left, center, top right and bottom right areas of the arena). Acquisition started no less than 10mins after placing the last droplet.
Confocal imaging
Young adults or L4 hermaphrodite animals were mounted in 2% agarose dissolved in M9 buffer pads and anaesthetized with 10mMlevamisole (Sigma). Confocal images were acquired with dual Hamamatsu ORCA-FUSIONBT SCMOS cameras on a Nikon Ti2-E In-
verted Microscope using a confocal spinning disk CSU-W1 System, 488nm and 561nm laser lines and a CFI PLAN APO LAMBDA 60X
OIL objective. Images were captured using the NIS-ELEMENTS software, with 2048px x 2048px, 16-bit depth, 300nm step size,300ms of exposure time and enough sections to cover the whole worm depth.
Calcium Imaging
Imaging calcium dynamics was performed as previously described,
70with some modiﬁcations. The sample mounting protocol was
modiﬁed to enrich the samples with animals positioned dorsoventrally, allowing for imaging of both AIY neurons simultaneously.
Temperature control elements and most microscopy elements remain identical to Hawk et al.,70with a Leica DM6B being used in
addition of Leica DM5500. Image acquisition was performed using MicroManager.97For imaging calcium dynamics, the imaging
pad was ﬁrst made by placing 5% Agarose dissolved in M9 buffer unto a 22x22mm glass slide and pressing it with a larger
25x75cm microscope slide. 18ul Levamisole was then placed on top of the pad. Using a minimal amount of bacteria, worms were
picked from their respective cultivation plate, unto one without bacteria, removing excess bacteria afterwards. It was then ﬂoodedwith M9 buffer, then pipetted as many as possible in 2 droplets of 3ul into the imaging pad. The levamisole, M9 buffer, and NGM platewithout bacteria were maintained at cultivation temperature of 20C. To enrich for dorsoventral view, a 5mins rest time was given
before proceeding. Any excess liquid remaining was removed by slightly tilting the coverslip while keeping the worms uphill, and
then removing the excess on the bottom by cutting that part of the pad. The worms were grouped together using an eyelashpick. Once the pad is almost dry, the top coverslip was carefully placed. The imaging pad was then moved to the temperature stage,
previously set to constant 20C, while the image was focused to start acquisition.
The temperature stage consists of a black painted Peltier plate surface. A cooling system removing excess heat runs through a
copper cooling block attached to the bottom surface of the stage. Temperature was controlled through custom LabView (National
Instruments) software and H-bridge ampliﬁer (Accuthermo FTXD700D) and controller (Accuthermo FTC200), that obtain temperature
measurements from a thermal probe (Omega SRTD-2). Micromanager
97was used to acquire ﬂuorescence images over time at
250ms exposure time, 1fps and 1x1 binning. A Leica DM5500 and Leica DM6B microscope with a 10XX/0.40 HC PL APO air objec-
tive, Photometrics Dual-View 2 (DV2) optical splitter and Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0 LT camera were used to acquire images with
both green and red channels.
Electrophysiological experiment and analyses
The electrophysiological experiments involving calcium imaging of AIY neurons were conducted using transgenic strains expressing
Pmod -1::GCaMP6s andPttx -3::mCherry , in both wild type and inx-1(gk580946) mutants. Experiments performed for measuring AIY
membrane resistance, membrane capacitance and membrane voltage response to current injections were conducted in transgenicll

strains expressing P ttx-3G::GFP in wild type and inx-1(tm3524) mutants. In each experiment, a young adult hermaphrodite animal
was immobilized on a Sylgard-coated circular coverglass by applying Vetbond Tissue Adhesive (3M Company) along the anterior
dorsal region. A longitudinal cut ( /C24200mm) was made by a diamond dissecting tool in the glued area. The cuticle above the cut
was gently pulled back and afﬁxed to the coverglass, exposing head neurons. The coverglass was then placed in a recording cham-ber ﬁlled with extracellular solution (composition: NaCl 140 mM, KCl 5 mM, CaCl
25 mM, MgCl 25 mM, dextrose 11 mM and HEPES
5 mM, pH 7.2). The pipette solution contained (in mM) KCl 120, KOH 20, Tris 5, CaCl 20.25, MgCl 24, sucrose 36, EGTA 5 and Na 2ATP
4 (pH 7.2). The two AIYs were identiﬁed based on either mCherry or GFP ﬂuorescence, and one of them was patch-clamped to estab-lish the classical whole-cell conﬁguration.
Since this study represents, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst-time information about gap junction function in C. elegans has been
obtained based on the voltage clamp of a single neuron, we implemented a new system (dPatch-2, Sutter Instruments) and meth-
odologies that were optimized in collaboration with technical staff from Sutter Instruments towards measurements of membraneresistance and membrane capacitance of very small cells (like C. elegans neurons). Membrane capacitance and resistance were
determined using the Membrane Test function of a dPatch-2 digital patch clamp ampliﬁer system (Sutter Instruments). In voltage-
clamp experiments for assessing membrane depolarization on calcium signals, one AIY was stepped from -60 mV to +40 mV for20 seconds before returning to -60 mV. Calcium transients of both AIYs were imaged before (10 sec), during (20 sec), and after
(30 sec) the voltage step at 1-second intervals using an electron-multiplying CCD camera (iXonEMþ885, Andor Technology), a
FITC ﬁlter set (59222, Chroma Technology Corp.), a light source (Lambda XL, Sutter Instrument), and NIS-Elements software (Nikon).TTL signals from the camera synchronized the recordings of calcium transients with the voltage-clamp protocol. In current-clampexperiments for assessing the effect of current injections on membrane voltage, negative and positive currents ranging from
-10 pA to +20 pA at 2.5-pA intervals were injected into a clamped AIY for 5 seconds per step. Except for the voltage-clamp exper-
iments for measuring membrane capacitance and membrane resistance, all electrophysiological experiments were conducted usinga Multiclamp 700B ampliﬁer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), a digitizer (Digidata 1550B, Molecular Devices), and Clampex soft-
ware (version 11, Molecular Devices) with data ﬁltered at 2 kHz and sampled 10 kHz. The voltage-clamp experiments for measuring
membrane resistance and membrane capacitance were conducted using a digital patch clamp ampliﬁer system (d-Patch-2, SutterInstrument). Borosilicate glass pipettes with a tip resistance of approximately 20 MOhm were used as electrodes in all electrophys-
iological recordings. The electrophysiological and calcium imaging experiments utilized a Nikon FN-1 microscope equipped with a
40X water immersion objective, an electron-multiplying CCD camera (iXonEM+885, Andor Technology), a light source (Lambda XL,Sutter Instrument) with a ﬁlter wheel, and the NIS-Elements software (Nikon).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical Tests
Statistical tests of dispersion assay results were performed using Python version 3.11, Python Software Foundation, www.python.
org. All other statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, Cali-
fornia USA, www.graphpad.com . Chosen statistical tests are described in the relevant ﬁgure legends. All the codes used in the study
can be accessed at the following repository: GitHub: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14170612 .
Quantiﬁcation of isothermal tracking
Worm tracks were ﬁrst analyzed and segmented by a modiﬁed MAGATAnalyzer software package.
42,94These trajectories were then
ﬁltered into periods of isothermal tracking, deﬁned as forward motion events in which at least 90% of the displacement occurred inthe vertical, isotherm orientation, for a minimum of 25 seconds; and periods of non-isothermal tracking in which the movement of theworm did not pass the isothermal tracking ﬁlter. The segmented isothermal tracking periods were further analyzed by their duration in
seconds, temperature at which the period started and number of events.
Quantiﬁcation of behavior
Quantiﬁcations of turns, thermotaxis indices and other parameters relevant to gradient migration were automatically scored per
worm track by an adapted MAGATAnalyzer software package, previously described.
42,94For dispersion assays, worm tracks
were ﬁrst analyzed and segmented by the same modiﬁed MAGATAnalyzer software package. Then in custom MATLAB scripts tra-
jectories movements were ﬁltered into 2 categories: runs, which are deﬁned as forward motion events where the direction of travel
does not change abruptly by more than 25 degrees, and is sustained for at least 22.5 seconds; and other forms of movements liketurns. We note that using other parameters similar results. Statistical analysis and plotting were done on python. All codes used in the
study can be accessed at GitHub: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14170612 .
The time taken to reach the isothermal tracking region (14
/C14C for the 0.8/C14C/cm gradient going from 16/C14Cto 24/C14C) was obtained by
identifying the time point corresponding to when the X coordinates for the tracks ﬁrst registered to reach or pass the positional co-ordinate pertaining to 14
/C14C.Tracks that, within the experimental time of 1 hour,never met this criteria were not included in the average
and analysis. This procedure was coded in Python.ll

thon scripts, which includes alignment of intensities with temperature, response detection and heatmap generation. Responses werescored as the initial rise of the AIY calcium signal as determined by an automated response calling based on signal intensity and its
