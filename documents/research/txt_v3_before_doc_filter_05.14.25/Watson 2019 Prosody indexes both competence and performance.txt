Prosody is an important feature of language that conveys a wide range of informa-
tion. However, prosody is widely considered to be a difficult domain of study within
the language sciences. One consequence of this is that existing grammatical theories
of prosody fail to explain prosodic choices that seem to arise from nonlinguistic cog-nitive demands, such as communicative context, top-down expectations, and recent
articulatory and acoustic experience. We provide an account of some of these phe-
nomena and argue that linguistic theories that do not incorporate these factors into
models of prosody are likely to mischaracterize its role in language.

1|INTRODUCTION
A challenge for the language sciences is characterizing the representations that underlie prosody as well as building theories
of how prosody functions in communication. Prosody can be defined as aspects of the acoustic signal that convey informationindependently of the segmental information in a sentence. It is typically realized acoustically by changes in pitch (intonation),
intensity (volume), and duration (timing), but subjectively, prosody is experienced as emphasis on a word, pauses in an utter-
ance, and changes in intonation, to name just a few examples. It is impossible to speak without prosody: it exists in every lan-
guage, signed or oral, and is even generated during reading (e.g., Breen, 2014; Fodor, 2002). Prosodic form (e.g., pitch)
regularly correlates with other aspects of linguistic structure that are critical for determining what a speaker means. Thesefacets include syntax, semantics, segmental phonology, and pragmatics (Büring, 2007; Steedman, 2000; Wagner & Watson,
2010, inter alia). Prosody also conveys paralinguistic information, such as happiness, fear, or frustration (Crystal & Quirk,
1964). Despite prosody's important role in language, there is disagreement about the acoustic correlates of prosodic phenom-ena (e.g., accenting; Beckman, 1986; Breen, Fedorenko, Wagner, & Gibson, 2010; Eady, Cooper, Klouda, Mueller, & Lotts,
1986; Kochanski, Grabe, Coleman, & Rosner, 2005; Ladd & Morton, 1997; Sluijter & van Heuven, 1996) or the meanings
that prosody can be used to convey (compare, for example, Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg (1990) to Aylett and Turk (2004) to
Selkirk (1984) to Wagner (2016)).
Typically, prosody is studied through the lens of linguistic competence, or idealized representations that link form to mean-
ing. Traditionally, the distinction between competence and performance (Chomsky, 1965) has been used to motivate the study
of linguistic knowledge independent of language use. However, in this paper, we argue that it is critical to study prosodicknowledge at the same time as prosodic use. We argue that a necessary component of understanding prosodic structure isReceived: 20 February 2019 Revised: 17 October 2019 Accepted: 1 November 2019

understanding the psychological processes that generate and interpret prosody. The structure of the paper continues as
follows: First, we discuss the types of linguistic information that prosody conveys. We then review work showing that theperception and production of prosody appears to be sensitive to cognitive constraints and communicative factors, as well astraditional linguistic factors, such as syntactic structure and information status. We then outline why understanding prosodicstructure requires models that tightly integrate grammatical representations with processing and contextual constraints.
2|WHAT INFORMATION IS THERE IN THE PROSODIC SIGNAL?
There is a great deal of evidence suggesting that prosody conveys information about other levels of linguistic representation.
In English, prosody conveys syntactic, discourse, and pragmatic information (Shattuck-Hufnagel & Turk, 1996; Wagner &Watson, 2010). For example, we know that speakers tend to place prosodic breaks at major syntactic boundaries. Consider the
sentence below:
1. Andrés decided to try a special dish from Rochester called a garbage plate // but he regretted ordering it as soon as he
saw it.
Most speakers are likely to place a break (or pause) between “plate ”and“but”because this is a boundary between two syn-
tactic clauses (Breen, Watson, & Gibson, 2011; Cooper & Paccia-Cooper, 1980; Gee & Grosjean, 1983; Watson & Gibson,2004). Listeners take advantage of this link between syntax and prosody in production, by using boundary placement to infer
the speaker's intended syntactic structure (Snedeker & Trueswell, 2003; Speer, Warren, & Schafer, 2011). Consider for exam-
ple the following Groucho Marx joke from the movie Animal Crackers:
2. One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I don't know.
The joke's punchline depends on a syntactic ambiguity, where the listener incorrectly assumes that Groucho, and not the
elephant is wearing pajamas. This ambiguity can be resolved with an intonational boundary. A boundary after “shot”creates a
bias towards an interpretation in which the elephant is wearing pajamas. A boundary after “elephant ”creates an interpretation
in which Groucho is wearing pajamas. Critically, prosody is useful to a listener precisely because it conveys information about
syntactic structure.
We see similar types of mappings between prosodic structure and other levels of linguistic representation. In English, new
and unpredictable words tend to be marked with pitch accents, which are acoustic prominences marked by foregroundingwords with fundamental frequency (F0), duration, and intensity (Chafe, 1987; Fowler & Housum, 1987; Prince, 1981). Simi-
larly, pragmatic information, such as marking a sentence as a question vs. a statement, can be conveyed prosodically
(Gunlogson, 2003). The difference between a statement like “You're leaving me. ”and a question like “You're leaving me? ”is
signaled by prosody, and not the individual words in the sentence.
This mapping between prosody and other aspects of linguistic structure seems to be straightforward: a given prosodic cue
maps onto a specific pragmatic meaning, syntactic structure, or discourse status. However, as we discuss below, these exam-ples belie the complexity of this mapping.
3|PROSODY AND COMPETENCE
Linguists have described this relationship between prosody and other levels of linguistic representation by using formal
approaches. Some theories have proposed linguistic rules or constraints that describe the relationship between intonation andmeaning (Gussenhoven, 1984; Pierrehumbert & Hirschberg, 1990; Rochemont, 1986; Schmerling, 1976; Selkirk, 1984); pros-ody and syntax (Nespor & Vogel, 1986; Selkirk, 1995; Truckenbrodt, 1999); prosody and morphology (McCarthy & Prince,
1993); and prosody and segmental phonology (Beaver, 1968; Chomsky & Halle, 1968; Ohala & Kawasaki, 1984), among
others. These approaches have provided important insights into prosodic choices and acoustic correlates of prosody. One com-mon idea among these approaches is that the mapping between prosody and other aspects of grammar can be formalized as a
system of rules and constraints to explain how prosody is realized depending on other linguistic factors. On one hand, this
approach has been quite useful in uncovering some of the factors that seem to effect prosody. On the other hand, theseapproaches fall short of explaining some speaker and listener prosodic preferences, which we outline below.2o f7 WATSON ET AL .

4|PROSODY AND PERFORMANCE
Some findings from the literature suggest that the perception of prosody is driven by several cognitive and contextual factors
that are at least partly independent of linguistic ones. It is often acknowledged that performance factors will affect the produc-tion and comprehension of prosody (Ferreira & Karimi, 2015; Turk & Shattuck-Hufnagel, 2014). In fact, in some cases, stud-ies have revealed whether a certain phenomenon can be best explained by competence or performance (Wagner & Klassen,2015). However, competence and performance are not always separable. Below, we discuss experiments showing that (a) theperception of syntactic boundaries is influenced by expectations; (b) the communicative goals of the speaker strongly influ-
ence the production of acoustic prominence; and (c) production-internal factors such as difficulties in phonological sequencing
influence speech rate and whole-word duration.
4.1|Prosody and expectations
The traditional approach to studying prosodic comprehension has consisted of building prosodic inventories that define different
prosodic categories based on their acoustic manifestations, and mapping this set of cues to a meaning. For example, an acousticdisjunction in speech might be interpreted as a prosodic break. However, research suggests that listeners' perceptions of prosodyare not influenced by just the bottom-up acoustic signal. Instead, prosodic perception is at least partly driven by what the listener
expects to hear given the syntactic, discourse, and pragmatic context. Recently, Buxó-Lugo and Watson (2016) investigated the
perception of prosodic boundaries in contexts in which intonational boundaries are likely to occur versus perception of bound-aries in locations where they are less likely. They presented participants with sentences like the ones below:
(3a) Put the bigbowl on the tray.
(3b) Put the bowl that's bigon the tray.
They found that participants were more likely to report hearing a boundary after “big”in (3b) compared to (3a), even when
the acoustic information was digitally altered to be identical across contexts. This was true even when there was almost noacoustic evidence of a prosodic boundary. Buxó-Lugo and Watson (2016) argue that syntactic expectations drive this effect:listeners expect a boundary after “big”in (3b) because it coincides with a larger syntactic boundary than in (3a). In a corpus
analysis, Cole, Mo, and Baek (2010) similarly found that the largest predictor of the presence of a boundary by naïve raters
was syntactic context, followed by vowel duration. Consistent with these effects, Bishop (2012) found that the perception ofprosodic prominence on a word can be manipulated by changing the discourse context in which that word appeared. Contextsin which the targets were discourse focused elicited higher prominence ratings compared to contexts in which the same targetword was nondiscourse focused.
Together, these data suggest that prosody is not just a product of the stimulus. Instead, predictions based on our knowledge
of the language influence how we perceive prosody, and evidence suggests these expectations can change somewhat quickly(Buxó-Lugo, 2017; Kurumada, Brown, & Tanenhaus, 2012; Roettger & Franke, 2019). While effects of expectations havebeen found for other areas of language processing (e.g., syntax, phonology), prosody is different in that there is little consen-sus over the structures and categories that make up prosodic representations (Wagner, McClay, & Mak, 2013 for discussionon potential meanings of the Rise-Fall-Rise intonation contour; for a more general discussion, see Ladd, 2014). Consequently,whereas in the case of syntax and phonemes one can more easily isolate the linguistic structure from the effect of expectations,
in prosody effects of expectations might be confused with the linguistic structures themselves. This makes it difficult to deter-
mine what the grammatical structure of prosody actually is. Crucially, studying the effect of expectations on prosodic compre-hension informs us about the relationship between listener's knowledge of a language and the acoustic signal they are trying toparse. For example, in Buxó-Lugo and Watson (2016), listeners report boundaries in unexpected locations, but only when theacoustic evidence was very strong. The weaker the acoustic evidence, the higher the likelihood that a listener would answeraccording to their expectations. This tells us that listeners balance acoustic information with expectations in ways that can beexplicitly measured. Understanding these dynamics may be critical for understanding how prosody works.
4.2|Prosody and communicative context
In English, acoustic prominence, or pitch accenting is used to signal that a referent is new to the discourse and/or potentially
contrastive with something in the environment (e.g., the GREEN ornament, not the BLUE ornament). Although there isWATSON ET AL . 3o f7
 19395086, 2020, 3, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.1522 by UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA 170 WILSON LIBRARY, Wiley Online Library on [28/05/2024]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License

general agreement that pitch, duration, and intensity are related to acoustic prominence (Breen et al., 2010), which of these
combinations of features is most important is controversial. In fact, different labs have found different features to be important
for signaling prominence (Beckman, 1986; Eady et al., 1986; Kochanski et al., 2005; Ladd & Morton, 1997; Sluijter & van
Heuven, 1996). This may stem from the assumption that there is an idealized representation of prosody that generalizes acrosscontexts. However, there is data suggesting that nonlinguistic factors such as speaker engagement and communicative contextcan influence how prosody is acoustically realized.
Buxó-Lugo, Toscano, and Watson (2018) compared two tasks that varied in speaker engagement: naming colors versus
playing an interactive computer game with a partner. In both tasks, participants described three color patches in succession asin (4):
(4a) Green Blue Black.
(4b) Green Pink Black.
We varied the discourse status of the underlined word: it was either new, contrasted with the previous three-word descrip-
tion, or repeated. In the less engaging task, speakers described these color patches alone in a room without an interlocutor. In
the more engaging task, participants played an online three-dimensional (3D) game with a partner. The participants weretasked with solving puzzles that allowed them to navigate an online dungeon. In critical trials, speakers had to describe colorpatches to their partner so that their partner could enter the colors into a combination lock that would allow them to proceed tothe next trial. Clearly, the communicative or interpersonal stakes across the two types of trials differ enormously, which was
reflected in speakers' prosodic choices. Although speakers in both tasks differentiated discourse status using duration, it was
only speakers in the more engaging task who used F0 to mark differences between given and new words.
While it may not be surprising that more engaged speakers produce more distinctive prosody, the idea that the communica-
tive context might be important is not reflected in how prosody is typically studied. Although there is evidence that even
speakers participating in nonengaging tasks can reliably produce intonational patterns that convey a specific meaning(e.g., incredulity; Goodhue, Harrison, Su, & Wagner, 2016), the effect we see in the above study might explain why differentlabs find different acoustic correlates across different tasks. Perhaps a lesson for language researchers is that anyoneattempting to make judgments about the generic value of a sample of speech for understanding prosody must consider thedegree to which a person is engaged in the communication task. Rather than assuming that prosodic structure is realized in the
same way across contexts, researchers must acknowledge that prosody is realized in different ways depending on the goals of
the speaker and the situations in which she is communicating. Critically, these data suggest that a theory of how prosodyworks must incorporate how context influences prosodic choices.
4.3|Prosody and the production system
As we discussed above, there is a clear relationship between discourse status and acoustic prominence. New, unpredictable
words are more likely to be prominent than given, predictable words. However, there is a great deal of evidence suggestingthat low-level phonological encoding mechanisms may partly mediate this link.
Speakers are slower to produce words that share phonological structure with words that have already been produced
(Watson, Buxó-Lugo, & Simmons, 2015; Yiu & Watson, 2015). For example, consider (5) below:
(5a) The beaker/house shrinks.
(5b) The beetle flashes.
In a scene description task from which the above stimuli were taken, Yiu and Watson (2015) found that speakers were
more likely to lengthen the phonologically overlapping word “beetle ”in (5b) when it was preceded by “beaker ”as compared
to a phonologically unrelated word like “house. ”They argue that producing two similar sounding words creates interference
during the phonological sequencing process that is linked to how quickly the sounds of those words are ordered.
In contrast to the phonological overlap results above, producing the same word twice leads to reduction (Jacobs, Yiu, Wat-
son, & Dell, 2015; Kahn & Arnold, 2012; Lam & Watson, 2010, 2014), which may be the result of priming the phonologicalencoding system. Importantly, this ease comes notfrom retrieving the lexical item itself, but rather from sequencing the
sounds in order, as speakers do not reduce words that they have only said in their heads to themselves (Jacobs et al., 2015).Evidence that repetition reduction effects are at least partly mediated by production processes comes from work by Jacobs4o f7 WATSON ET AL .
 19395086, 2020, 3, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.1522 by UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA 170 WILSON LIBRARY, Wiley Online Library on [28/05/2024].

et al. (2015) showing that speakers also reduce repeated sequences of sounds that refer to an entirely different concept, such
as homophones. That is, producing the word piewill make the subsequent production of pishorter in duration (Jacobs
et al., 2015).
Other work suggests that the semantic relatedness of words produced in succession might even impact production fluency,
though the exact mechanisms are still debated (Balota, Boland, & Shields, 1989; Fink, Oppenheim, & Goldrick, 2018). Exis-ting accounts that link aspects of speech timing to production ease (Arnold, 2008; Arnold, Kahn, & Pancani, 2012; Zerkle,Rosa, & Arnold, 2017) are also consistent with our perspective.
Ultimately, these data demonstrate that aspects of language that have traditionally been categorized as performance can
have very real consequences for how prosody is realized in production and interpreted in comprehension. More importantly,the general finding that words that are easy to say are shorter than words that are more difficult to say poses a challenge forprosody researchers. In competence accounts, acoustic prominence, which is linked to duration, correlates with informationstructure (e.g., focus or discourse status). However, the data above suggests that words that are new to the discourse also hap-pen to be words that are likely to be more difficult to produce, potentially conflating performance factors and linguistic cues.Understanding the many ways that prosodic production is directly and indirectly affected by other aspects of cognition may beimportant for uncovering system relationships between prosody and other aspects of linguistic structure.
5|CONCLUSION
In sum, often-overlooked factors such as communicative context, top-down processing, and production pressures play an impor-
tant role in the production and comprehension of prosody. Nongrammatical factors, such as an individual's boredom or engage-ment; the lexical, phonetic, and phonological properties of other entities in the discourse; and expectations about linguisticstructure all impact prosodic processing. We have shown that speakers produce prosody in ways that do not necessarily reflectgrammatical representations, but rather cognitive ones. Cognitive and grammatical representations may correlate in ways thatmake it difficult to disentangle the two in language production. Likewise, listeners are surprisingly sensitive to their own expec-tations of what the signal should sound like even when these expectations contradict the available acoustic evidence. We wishto make it clear that we are not arguing that competence-based approaches to prosody have not made contributions to our under-standing of prosody, nor are we claiming that we should abandon these approaches completely. Instead we argue that under-standing both prosodic knowledge and prosodic use in tandem will be critical for making progress in the study of prosody.
