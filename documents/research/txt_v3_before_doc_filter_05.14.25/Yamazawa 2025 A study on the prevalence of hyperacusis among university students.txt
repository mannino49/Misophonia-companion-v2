In  recent  years,  social  consideration  for  the  sound  environment  has  begun  to  
spread.  Airports  have  installed  calm-down  spaces  that  reduce  surrounding  noise,  
and  drugstores  have  introduced  quiet  hours  that  limit  sound  and  lighting  for  certain  
hours.  The  background  to  these  efforts  is  the  spread  of  understanding  of  
developmental  disorders,  as  well  as  consideration  for  the  sensitivity  to  various  
stimuli  that  often  accompany  developmental  disorders  (Asahi  Shimbun,  2023).  For  
people  who  are  sensitive  to  auditory  stimuli,  even  everyday  environmental  sounds  
that  are  generally  not  noticeable  can  be  unbearable.  This  state  of  reduced  
tolerance  to  sound  is  called  hyperacusis  (Henry  et  al.,  2022).  Hyperacusis  is  
frequently  seen  in  autism  spectrum  disorders  (ASD)  (Khalfa  et  al.,  2004;  Rosenhall  
et  al.,  1999).  Many  studies  on  ASD  have  demonstrated  the  existence  of  specific  
sensory  processing,  including  sensory  hypersensitivity  (Ben-Sasson  et  al.,  2009;  
Leekam  et  al.,  2007).  In  response,  the  items  of  sensory  hypersensitivity/
hyposensation  and  sensory  seeking  were  added  to  the  diagnostic  criteria  of  ASD  
in  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM-5)  (American  
PsychiatricAssociation,  2013  (translated  by  Takahashi  and  Ohno,  2014)  and  is  considered  
one  of  the  characteristics  of  ASD.This  study  aims  to  reveal  the  characteristics  of  auditory  hypersensitivity  among  Japanese  university  students  with  a  particular  focus  on  two  elements  of  
auditory  hypersensitivity:  hyperacusis  and  misophonia.  We  conducted  an  investigation  of  the  prevalence  and  interrelationship  of  these  conditions  in  a  non-
clinical  sample  of  439  indi-viduals  using  self-reported  measures.  Additionally,  we  performed  a  meta-analysis  to  compare  our  findings  on  hy-peracusis  and  
misophonia  with  the  existing  literature.  Our  results  revealed  a  prevalence  of  8.2%  for  hyperacusis,  40%  for  misophonia,  and  a  7.2%  comorbidity  rate  for  
both  conditions.  Our  meta-analysis  indicated  that  our  hy-peracusis  and  misophonia  scores  are  consistent  with  those  reported  in  previous  studies,  but  also  
suggested  vari-ability  in  these  conditions  across  different  countries.  This  implies  that  cultural  and  gender-related  factors  might  influence  the  prevalence  rates  
of  hyperacusis  and  misophonia  in  the  general  population.  
Key  words:  auditory  hypersensitivity,  hyperacusis,  misophonia,  meta-analysis.  Yusin  Yamazawa  (Chuo  University),  Akira  Midorikawa  (Chuo  University)Research  Report
Hearing  hypersensitivity  is  expressed  as  "acusis  hypersensitivity"  in  Japan,  
but  in  the  West  it  is  also  called  Decreased  Sound  Tolerance  (DST),  which  means  
"a  state  in  which  one  cannot  tolerate  everyday  sounds  that  are  no  problem  for  
others,"  and  is  classified  as  hyperacusis  and  misophonia  (Jastreboff  &  Jastreboff,  
2014).  Hyperacusis  is  a  state  in  which  everyday  sounds  are  perceived  as  louder  
than  they  actually  are.  The  response  to  a  stimulus  depends  only  on  its  physical  
properties,  is  unrelated  to  the  context  or  meaning  of  the  sound,  and  may  be  
accompanied  by  discomfort  or  pain  (Aazh  et  al.,  2014;  Fackrell  et  al.,  2019).  On  
the  other  hand,  sound  aversion  is  not  caused  by  the  physical  properties  of  sounds,  
but  by  specific  patterns  or  meanings  of  sounds  (Jastreboff  &  Jastreboff,  2002;  
Swedo  et  al.,  2022),  and  the  sounds  that  are  aversive  vary  from  person  to  person.  
The  aversive  sounds  are  often  sounds  made  by  other  people  (Jastreboff  &  
Jastreboff,  2014;  Palumbo  et  al.,  2018),  such  as  the  sounds  of  others  eating,  
breathing,  coughing,  clicking  a  pen,  or  typing  (Henry  et  al.,  2022;  Zhou  et  al.,  
2017).  Furthermore,  when  exposed  to  such  sounds,  sound  aversion  sufferers  
experience  negative  emotions  such  as  anger  and  anxiety,  and  show  autonomic  
nervous  system  symptoms  such  as  increased  heart  rate  and  sweating.Yumi  Yamazawa  (Chuo  University),  and  Akira  Midorikawa  (Chuo  University)A  study  of  the  prevalence  of  auditory  hypersensitivity  in  university  students:

The  survey  was  conducted  from  July  to  October  2023.  The  survey  
subjects  were  440  university  students  (257  men,  183  women)  taking  
psychology  classes  at  a  private  university  in  Tokyo,  and  439  people  (256  
men,  183  women,  average  age  19.57  years  (SD  =  1.35))  who  responded  to  
all  items  were  analyzed.
Questioning  Project
To  evaluate  sound  hypersensitivity,  we  used  the  Japanese  version  of  
Khalfa's  (2002)  Hyperacusis  Questionnaire  (HQ)  (Kumagaya  et  al.,  2013).  It  
consists  of  14  items  in  total  and  is  divided  into  three  factors:  attention,  
social,  and  emotional.  Khalfa  (2002)  used  a  four-point  scale  with  a  maximum  
score  of  42  points,  while  the  Japanese  version  uses  a  six-point  scale  with  
a  maximum  score  of  70  points.  The  higher  the  score,  the  greater  the  degree  
of  sound  hypersensitivity,  with  40  points  being  the  cutoff  point.  In  this  study,  
we  followed  the  scoring  and  analysis  methods  of  the  Japanese  version.The  cause  of  the  comorbidity  is  unclear.  Therefore,  in  this  study,  we  
conducted  a  survey  of  the  same  university  students,  distinguishing  between  
sound  hypersensitivity  and  sound  aversion,  to  clarify  the  prevalence  and  
comorbidity  rates  in  Japan.  Secondly,  we  examined  gender  differences.  
Thirdly,  although  differences  in  prevalence  rates  have  been  shown  by  
country,  the  standards  for  calculating  prevalence  rates  differ  from  study  to  
study,  so  in  this  study,  we  targeted  literature  that  used  the  same  scale  and  
used  meta-analysis  to  make  a  comparison  based  on  the  scale  scores.
Eligible  people  and  proceduresHyperacusis  is  known  to  be  a  common  symptom  in  ASD  (Khalfa  et  al.,  
2004;  Rosenhall  et  al.,  1999),  but  it  has  also  been  shown  to  be  present  in  a  
certain  percentage  of  the  general  population.  However,  the  frequency  varies  
by  country,  with  a  self-report  questionnaire  survey  showing  that  6.8%  of  
subjects  in  Sweden  (Andersson  et  al.,  2002),  15.2%  in  Poland  (Fabijan-ska  
et  al.,  1999),  and  4.6%  in  Japan  were  found  to  be  hyperacusis  (Kumagaya  
et  al.,  2013).  Regarding  gender  differences,  many  studies  have  reported  a  
higher  rate  in  females  (Khalfa  et  al.,  2002;  Paulin  et  al.,  2016;  Yilmaz  et  al.,  
2017),  but  some  studies  have  reported  a  higher  rate  in  males  (children)  (Hall  
et  al.,  2016)  and  no  gender  differences  (Kumagaya  et  al.,  2013),  and  the  
results  are  not  consistent.  The  prevalence  of  sound  aversion  has  been  
reported  to  be  20-23.4%  in  the  United  States  (Brennan  et  al.,  2024;  Wu  et  
al.,  2014),  23.1%  in  China  (Zhou  et  al.,  2017),  and  41.4%  in  Japan  (Tada  
et  al.,  2022),  based  on  surveys  using  self-report  questionnaires.  Many  
studies  have  shown  that  there  is  no  gender  difference  in  sound  aversion  
(Jakubovski  et  al.,  2022;  Wu  et  al.,  2014;  Zhou  et  al.,  2017),  but  it  has  been  
reported  that  women  in  Japan  score  higher  (Tada  et  al.,  2022).  Thus,  sound  
hypersensitivity  and  sound  aversion  are  characterized  by  a  large  gap  
between  countries.  In  particular,  the  prevalence  of  sound  aversion  is  
remarkable  in  Japan,  but  the  number  of  reports  is  limited.  In  addition,  there  
have  been  no  consistent  results  regarding  gender  differences  in  sound  
hypersensitivity  and  sound  aversion.  Although  it  has  been  shown  that  sound  
hypersensitivity  and  sound  aversion  are  different  pathologies,  it  has  been  
pointed  out  that  the  two  can  coexist  (Henry  et  al.,  2022).  Jager  et  al.  (2020)  
found  that  the  proportion  of  
people  with  sound  aversion  who  had  previously  been  diagnosed  with  
sound  hypersensitivity  was  about  1%,  but  in  a  survey  using  a  self-
administered  questionnaire,  the  comorbidity  rate  of  sound  hypersensitivity  
among  participants  classified  as  sound  aversion  was  71%  (Enzler  et  al.,  
2021).  A  strong  correlation  between  the  two  was  also  shown  in  a  survey  by  
Brennan  et  al.  (2024).  On  the  other  hand,  the  concept  of  sound  aversion  is  
hardly  known  in  Japan,  and  there  are  no  studies  on  the  coexistence  of  
sound  hypersensitivity  and  sound  aversion.  In  addition,  Sakata  (2017)  
explains  that  hyperacusis  "often  accompanies  negative  emotions  such  as  
discomfort,  fear,  and  irritation. ...  The  triggering  sound  may  or  may  not  be  
limited,  and  the  volume  may  vary  (Sakata,  2017,  p.1184)."  Sound  
hypersensitivity  and  sound  aversion  are  comprehensively  considered  as  
hyperacusis  (for  example,  Matsui  and  Sakuma,  2020;  Tsuji,  2018).  Sound  
hypersensitivity  and  sound  aversion  are  different  characteristics  and  should  
be  considered  separately,  but  in  Japan,  the  two  have  not  been  sufficiently  
clarified.  In  light  of  the  above  situation,  the  purpose  of  this  study  is  as  follows.  
First,  in  Japan,  sound  hypersensitivity  and  sound  aversion  have  not  been  
sufficiently  distinguished  from  each  other,  so  it  is  necessary  to  clarify  the  
relationship  between  the  two.It  has  also  been  noted  that  there  is  increased  neurological  arousal  (Rinaldi  
et  al.,  2023;  Swedo  et  al.,  2022).
To  evaluate  sound  aversion,  we  used  the  Japanese  version  of  the  
Misophonia  Questionnaire  (MQ)  by  Wu  et  al.  (2014)  (Tada  et  al.,  2022).  It  is  
composed  of  two  scales:  the  sound  aversion  symptom  scale,  which  
evaluates  aversion  to  specific  sounds,  has  seven  items,  and  the  affective  
and  behavioral  scale,  which  evaluates  emotional  responses  and  behavior,  
has  10  items.  A  five-point  scale  was  used,  with  the  maximum  score  being  68  
points,  and  the  higher  the  score,  the  stronger  the  degree  of  sound  aversion.  
Wu  et  al.  (2014)  established  a  cutoff  score  of  14  points  for  the  sound  
aversion  symptom  scale,  and  this  was  also  followed  in  this  study.
Literature  collection
Literature  was  selected  to  compare  the  mean  scores  of  sound  
hypersensitivity  and  sound  aversion  using  meta-analysis.  To  collect  
literature,  Google  Scholar  and  PubMed  were  searched  using  the  keywords  
"Hyperacusis"  and  "Misophonia".  For  domestic  studies,  Google  Scholar  and  
CiNii  were  searched  using  the  keywords  "Hyperacusis",  "Misophonia",  
and  "Sound  Aversion".  The  selection  criteria  for  literature  were  (a)  that  HQ  
or  MQ  was  used,  and  (b)  that  the  general  population  was  targeted,  and  
those  targeting  clinical  groups  were  excluded.methodMachine Translated by Google

Note.  As  Kumagaya  et  al.  (2013)  and  the  current  study  used  a  six-
point  scale,  the  values  were  converted  to  scores  using  the  four-
point  scale.

This  may  reflect  the  difference.
The  prevalence  was  3.9-5.8%  (Brennan  et  al.,  2024;  KumagayaThis  suggests  that  sound  sensitivity  may  be  due  to  biological  and  cultural  differences.

No  differences  were  observed.The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  compare  these  differences  using  the  above.The  age  ranges  vary  widely,  with  Paulin  et  al.  (2016)

Furthermore,  no  gender  differences  were  observed  in  sound  hypersensitivity.InvestigationNote.  HQ  =  Hyperacusis  Questionnaire;  MQ  =  Misophonia  Questionnaire.  Note.  ÿ  =  Groups  with  both  hyperacusis  and  misophonia;  ÿ  =  groups  with  misophonia;    =  groups  with

It  is  determined  by  the  nature  of  the  sound,  and  the  results  of  Tada  et  al.  
(2022)  and  this  study  suggest  that  Japanese  culture  may  have  a  tendency  
to  promote  sound  aversion  in  particular.  This  susceptibility  to  cultural  
influences  is  thought  to  be  one  of  the  reasons  for  the  large  difference  in  
the  prevalence  of  sound  hypersensitivity.  Sound  hypersensitivity  is  said  to  
be  a  state  that  depends  only  on  the  physical  properties  of  sound,  and  no  
clear  differences  were  observed  between  different  cultures,  while  sound  
aversion  shows  large  differences  between  different  cultures.  Namba  et  al.  
(1991)  reported  that  the  daily  sound  environment  is  diverse  and  there  are  
differences  in  noise  awareness  depending  on  the  country,  and  such  
studies  also  suggest  that  sociocultural  factors  are  related  to  the  difference  
in  the  prevalence  of  sound  
aversion.  A  moderate  correlation  (r  =  .649)  was  observed  between  
sound  hypersensitivity  and  sound  aversion,  and  the  proportion  exceeding  
the  cutoff  value  for  both  was  7.3%.  In  a  report  by  Jager  et  al.  (2020),  the  
proportion  of  people  with  sound  aversion  who  had  previously  been  
diagnosed  with  sound  hypersensitivity  was  0.7%.  On  the  other  hand,  
studies  using  self-report  questionnaires  have  reported  that  more  than  70%  
of  individuals  who  meet  the  criteria  for  sound  aversion  also  meet  the  criteria  
for  sound  hypersensitivity  (Aazh  et  al.,  2022;  Enzler  et  al.,  2021).  Although  
the  coexistence  of  these  conditions  varies  greatly  depending  on  the  
listening  method  and  cutoff  value,  a  correlation  between  the  two  has  been  
observed  in  Japan,  suggesting  that  sound  hypersensitivity  and  sound  
aversion  share  a  common  background  and  coexist  to  a  certain  extent.  In  
addition,  both  sound  hypersensitivity  and  sound  aversion  have  been  linked  to  ASD  and  mood  disorders  (Jager  et  al.,  2021).However,  this  study  and  Tada  et  al.  (2022),  both  conducted  in  Japan,  had  
relatively  high  scores,  suggesting  that  cultural  factors  may  be  influencing  
the  results.  In  addition,  most  of  the  studies  included  in  the  meta-analysis  
were  conducted  on  young  people,  whereas  the  study  by  Jakubovski  et  al.  
(2022),  which  had  significantly  lower  scores,  had  a  wide  age  range  of  
subjects,  from  16  to  96  years  old.  Kÿlÿç  (2021)  reported  that  the  incidence  
of  sound  aversion  decreases  with  age,  and  it  is  possible  that  the  age  of  
the  subjects  may  have  influenced  the  differences  in  scores  between  the  
studies.  In  an  analysis  of  the  questionnaire  items,  the  most  disgusting  
sounds  in  the  United  States  and  China  were  "repeated  sounds"  and  
"sounds  of  people  eating"  (Bren-nan  et  al.,  2024;  Wu  et  al.,  2014;  Zhou  
et  al.,  2017),  whereas  in  this  study,  it  was  "surrounding  noise."  Norena  
(2023)  points  out  that  sounds  that  cause  sound  aversion  are  sounds  
that  must  be  suppressed  from  the  perspective  of  etiquette,  and  that  sound  
aversion  is  caused  by  increased  sensitivity  to  others  deviating  from  social  
norms.  Therefore,  it  can  be  inferred  that  the  sounds  that  are  disgusted  by  
sound  aversion  and  the  degree  of  disgust  differ  between  cultures.  Although  
there  are  no  studies  that  directly  compare  cultural  differences  in  sound  
aversion,  
Brennan  et  al.  (2024)  investigated  the  differences  in  MQ  scores  by  race  
in  American  college  students  and  found  no  racial  differences  in  MQ  scores  
or  types  of  sounds  that  were  disgusting.  This  suggests  that  sound  aversion  
is  not  determined  by  biological  differences  but  by  the  environment  and  
culture.Meta-analysis  for  HQ  scores
