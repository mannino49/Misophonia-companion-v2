The effect of noise on human brain activity and its cognitive 
function has often been taken for granted.[1] Noise has various 
detrimental effects, including interruptions in cognitive 
processing, negative effects on mental and physical health,[2] 
nonauditory effects such as interruptions in comprehension 
processes, cognitive disturbances, cardiac discomforts, 
and sleep issues.[1] Exposure to noise in different work 
and nonwork places is considered to be a problem. Noises 
impertinent to professional duties are highly dangerous to 
the safety, efficiency, and personal health of an individual.[3] 
A number of studies have demonstrated that exposure to 
noise could negatively affect the individuals’ safety due to 
causing professional mistakes and interruptions in safety 
communications and alarms. Furthermore, cognitive effects 
resulting from noise such as losing attention and increase in anxiety might bring about a higher possibility of accident 
occurrence.[4‑6]
The type of noise and its features, the amount of being exposed 
to it, personal characteristics, and sensitivity to noise determine 
the harmful effects of noise. Studies report that age, sex, genetic 
factors, underlying diseases, personal characteristics, and other 
personal features such as sensitivity to noise have a significant The Analysis of the Cognitive Function Parameters in Exposure

Aim:  Exposure to noise in different work and nonwork places is considered to be a problem. Noises impertinent to professional duties are 
highly dangerous to the safety, efficiency, and personal health of an individual. This study aims to analyze the electroencephalography (EEG) 
signals to reveal the effect of produced noises in a laboratory environment on the cognitive function of the brain. Materials  and Methods:  In 
this case/control study, the sample volume was determined based on similar studies and previous researches of 20 individuals. Fifty percentage 
of the individuals were male and the other half were female. Initially, the EEG device was connected to the students’ heads. The duration of 
this test was 8 min; the student took it a number of times, while his cognitive performance was measured with the EEG device in the midst 
and at the end of the test. The fulfillment of cognitive duties (the daily quota of lessons) and the n‑back test took place for the cohort in an 
environment in which a simulated noise was provided. Results:  The age average in boys and girls were respectively 24 ± 4.2 and 23 ± 3.5. 
The results demonstrated that cognitive parameters of concentration, excitement, anxiety, calmness, commitment, and interest in exposure to 
low‑frequency sound using an EEG Emotiv EPOC headset in different intervals. The parameters of commitment, concentration, and calmness 
decreased as the allotted time increased, and only the fall in commitment parameter was significant (P = 0.006). Conclusion:  The findings 
of the present study demonstrate that the decrease in cognitive performance and brain signals in exposure to 85 dB noise was significant. 
This could have also been caused by psycho‑acoustic factors such as sound level, tonality, duration of exposition, and the type of sound. In 
relation to exposure time, results have shown that in the presence of loud noise and in comparison, to quietude, the average response time 
to stimulants increase (slower response).

Mohebian, et al.: The analysis of the cognitive function parameters in exposure to noise
International Journal of Environmental Health Engineering ¦ 20232role in the nonauditory effects of noise.[4,7‑9] Previous survey 
has shown that exposure to noise affects health, professional 
memory, consciousness, and being professionally content, 
which varies based on the complexity of the job.[10]
Until 1930, a common belief was that noise effects on health 
were limited to decreasing hearing ability. In a published study 
in US acoustic association magazine, it was concluded that 
noise effects on human beings go much further than decreasing 
hearing ability.[11] Subsequent to a meager improvement in this 
scientific field in 1960s, the 1970s brought about a number 
of research instances to evaluate the annoyance caused by 
environment noises.[12‑14] Exposure to noise causes disturbance 
in calmness and increases physiological provocation and 
anxiety.[15] Exposure to noise could have early and later effects. 
One of the main effects is the decrease of cognitive function, 
which could lead to professional accidents to a great extent[16] 
Easterbrook “states that exposure to noise could elevate the 
threshold of sensitivity to noise, in a way that if noise exceeds 
the sufficient amount, it could cause the lowering of focus.”[17] 
The annoyance resulting from environmental noise is under the 
effect of nonacoustic causes such as personal characteristics 
and an individual’s stance toward the source of the noise. 
Noise sensitivity is considered to be a stabilizing element or 
an annoyance mediator, and among the other noise effects are 
mental interruptions during sleep or disruptions in function 
while awake.[18] Most probably, the noise will not only affect 
a worker’s function through intense confrontation but also on 
the accounts of hazardous confrontations of higher levels.[19,20] 
According to Leather, Beale and Sullivan, it seems a decrease 
in environmental noise would lead to the fall in social and 
mental anxiety in workplaces.[6]
A number of various techniques could be utilized to measure the 
reflex of an individual’s cognitive and physiological parameters 
in exposure to noise. Among these techniques, we can mention 
the continuous performance test to measure people’s sustained 
attention and the paced auditory serial addition test to measure 
working memory capacity and performance.[21,22]
Another of these techniques is using electroencephalography 
(EEG), in which a series of indicators dependent on EEG have 
been used.[23] EEG performance is in the form of registering 
the brain’s electrical activities, where the produced signals are 
sent to the neural cells of the brain. EEG could be measured 
noninvasively subsequent to the placement of electrodes on 
the surface of the head skin.[24‑26] An advantage of using EEG is 
that one could use its results for determining the amount of an 
individual’s confrontation with noise. One could also find out 
the constant psycho‑physiological indicators of an individual, 
rendering the individual’s explicit response unnecessary.[27]
Several studies exist on the effect of noise on brain’s cognitive 
functions. Due to the fact that sound pressure level is one of the 
most effective causes regarding the effect of noise on cognitive 
performance and brain signals, the present study focuses 
on a level of 85 dBA. Furthermore, having considered the 
paradoxical results in other studies on cognitive performance and its significance in several duties, and in turn the rarity of 
studies on the effects of noise on brain activity patterns, this 
study aims to analyze the EEG signals to reveal the effect of 
produced noises in a laboratory environment on the cognitive 
function of the brain.
MaterIals  and Methods
In this case/control study, the sample size was determined based 
on similar studies and previous researches of 20 individuals 
(10 men and 10 women); however, due to the break of 
COVID‑19, the authors faced several discomforts in collecting 
data which led to the participation of 16 individuals in the 
study.[3] Fifty percentage of the individuals were male (8 men) 
and the other half were female (8 women). The current 
research was undertaken in 2022, aiming to analyze the effect 
of noise on such student cognitive performance as excitement, 
engagement, focus, relax, stress, interest in using EEG device, 
and measurement of professional memory using the n‑back test. 
The individuals sampled for this study were those who were 
formerly tested for previous high exhaustion, and consumption 
of special drugs and caffeine, while these were considered as the 
inputs and outputs of the study. The duration of the study was 
40 min. The study proceeded in the manner described below:
Initially, the EEG device was connected to the students’ heads. 
The EEG Emotive EPOC + portable device, made in the USA, 
including 14 sensors was mounted on the head according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Sensors were moisturized using 
brine. It was then connected to its software on the computer via 
a USB connection. Subsequent to the initiation of the focused 
parameters, the rate of anxiety received by the headset from 
Bluetooth waves was noted and recorded in the software.
Primarily, the student started his daily studying routine 
which included studying a textbook, Q/A, and searching for 
a scientific subject related to his very own major. His brain 
performance was recorded while doing the activities and then 
he began taking the n‑back test. The duration of this test was 
8 min; the student took it a number of times, while his cognitive 
performance was measured with the EEG device in the midst 
and at the end of the test.
In the end, the student filled out the noise annoyance 
questionnaire to determine his feeling toward the conditions 
of the experiment.
The fulfillment of cognitive duties (the daily quota of lessons) 
and the n‑back test took place for the cohort in an environment 
in which a simulated industrial noise was provided. Industrial 
noises are such as those made by grinders, sandpaper machines, 
hammer, vehicles, and drills. The sound pressure level was 
adjusted to 85 dBA, set proportionately to the minimum level 
of hearing protection performance (for an 8‑h workday) as 
suggested by EU (EC/10/2003 EU instructions).[28] Thus, we 
found out the degree of the effect of noise on the students’ 
cognitive performances through changes in peak cognitive 
function indicated by EEG.

International Journal of Environmental Health Engineering ¦ 20233
Bearing in mind the fact that this experiment was comprised of 
students and was undertaken in a laboratory, the sound pressure 
level was set lower than standard to observe ethical norms and 
ensure the safety of students. On the other hand, the duration 
of the exposition was determined in a way that the safety of 
students would not be compromised. The control cohort was 
studied under the same circumstances, however without any 
exposition to noise.
Brain waves were recorded using the Emotiv‑EPOC + which 
has 14 active electrode channels: (i) Frontal lobe: AF3, AF4, 
F3, F4, F7, F8, FC6, FC5,[29] and Temporal lobe: T7, T8.[24] 
Occipital lobe: O1 and O2, and[30] Parietal lobe: P7 and P8. 
In a 14‑channeled EEG device, the frequency of Theta waves 
is 4–8 Hz, Alpha’s 8–12 Hz, Beta’s 12–25 Hz, and Gamma’s 
25–45 Hz. The θ waves have a higher domain in a state of 
drowsiness. The α waves are of a higher domain in a state of 
tranquility. The β wave has signals with short domains which 
tend to appear while working when one is alarmed, and when 
one is engaged in an activity.[29]
N‑back is a test that measures the cognitive performance 
related to executive function, which is normally used in 
neuroimaging studies to provoke the brain functions of 
the subjects. This test was first introduced by Kirchner in 
1958.[31] The test proceeded as follows: A series of stimulants 
(often visual) would be offered to the subject step‑by‑step, 
and the subject would find out if the recent stimulant is in 
accordance with the one offered in the previous step. The 
test would take place with different n values and the higher 
the value of n, the more difficult the test was. Thus, in the 
1‑back (n = 1), the last offered stimulant would be compared 
with the previous stimulant, and also in 3‑back (n = 3), the 
last offered stimulant would be compared with the last three 
stimulants (in this test, n could be 1, 2, 3).
This test has been deemed an appropriate method of evaluating 
professional memory and in the recent years has been widely 
employed in this field. Studies have shown that the various 
modes of this test could well be employed in laboratory studies 
on professional memory and other cognitive actions such as 
fluid intelligence.[32] Using this test as an evaluating indicator of 
professional memory performance is highly acceptable. While 
doing the tasks of n‑back, executive actions such as controlling 
and focusing attention, decision‑making, and planning the 
processing of peripheral information is engaged. Also in the 
field of professional memory, the highest rate of engagement 
in the performance of the central executive system is achieved 
while doing these tasks.[32] At the end of this test, the degree 
of sensitivity to noise was evaluated using a noise annoyance 
questionnaire. The questionnaire comprises three sections or 
three subscales: (1) The misophonia scale (measures the signs of 
misophonia and has 7 items) is Graded 0–4.  (2) Behaviors and 
excitements caused by misophonia (measures the exciting and 
behavioral reactions caused by misophonia and has 10 items) 
and is Graded 0–4. The overall grade of the questionnaire is 
comprised of the items related to the misophonia subscale and the exciting and behavioral reactions caused by misophonia 
and the range is between 0 and 68. (3) Misophonia intensity 
scale, which includes a general question and is an adaptation 
of the obsessive‑compulsive disorder demarcated by the 
National Institute of Mental Health, and evaluates the general 
intensity of misophonia from 1 (minimum) to 15 (very intense). 
A Grade of 7 or higher is a testimonial of significant clinical 
symptoms.[33]
Finally, continuous variables were reported in an average 
manner  (standard deviation) and the qualitative variables were 
reported based on plenitude (percentage). The comparison of 
cognitive parameters and the n‑back test results at different 
times and levels were tested, using repeated measures if the 
data were normal, and Friedman test if the data were not 
normal. The results of n‑back test were used to measure the 
relation between cognitive parameters, the Pearson correlation 
coefficient was used to measure the intensity of normal data, 
and Spearman Coefficient was used for the abnormal data. All 
statistical analyses were done using SPSS software version 20.

questions (P = 0.002). The average number of questions 
correctly answered and the result percentage decreases 
with the rise in levels, and the fall is significant in both 
cases (respectively  P = 0.001 and  P < 0.001). The increase in 
the average responding time is more in level 2 in comparison 
with the other 2 levels (P = 0.001). Table 3 shows the rate of 
sensitivity intensity in the participants; the average and the 
standard deviation of sensitivity intensity was 2.53 ± 5.20. 
Fifty percentage of the participants reported low sensitivities.
Table 4 shows the correlation between the cognitive parameters 
resulting from EEG headset in different intervals and levels of 
n‑back test. Fifteen minutes after starting the excitement test, 
this parameter showed a negative relation with the number 
of correct choices in level 1. Furthermore, 25 min after the 
initiation of the test, it showed a positive relationship with 
the wrong choices in level 3. On the other hand, after 40 min 
there was a positive relation with the unanswered questions in 
level 1, a negative relation with the correct answers in level 1, 
and a positive relation with the wrong answers in level 3. The 
focus variable after 25 min had a negative relation with the 
results percentage in level 1. Focus in 40 min had a positive 
relationship with the unanswered questions in level 1 and 
the number of wrongly answered questions in levels 2 and 
3. Fifteen minutes after the initiation of the test, the interest 
and relax variables had a negative relation with the number of 
correct choices and the results percentage in level 1. Interest 
after 25 and 40 min had, respectively, a positive relationship 
with the number of correctly answered question in level 3 
and the results percentage in level 2. The relax parameter 
after 25 and 40 min had, respectively, a positive relation with 
the correctly answered questions in level 3 and a negative 
relation with the number of wrongly answered questions. The 
stress parameter after 15 min had a positive relationship with 
the number of wrong answers in level 2. Furthermore, after 
40 min, it had a positive relationship with the correct answers 
and the result percentage in level 2. The remaining correlative 
coefficients were not significant in tables (P < 0.05). Table 5 
shows the correlation between the intensity of sensitivity and 
the cognitive parameters which resulted from the EEG headset 
in different intervals. The intensity of sensitivity showed a 
positive and significant relation with a focus in 25 min and 
relaxation in 40 min.dIscussIon
Within this section, the effect of noise on the parameters 
of cognitive performance (EEG device and n‑back test) 
was explicated and its probable causes were analyzed. 
Subsequently, the limitations and the participation in the study 
were discussed.
According to the findings of the present study, the parameters of 
engagement, focus, and relaxation descended with the increase 
in the exposition time. Over time, when the human body is 
exposed to a dangerous physical factor (noise), stress will in 
turn occur as a physiological response. Such a phenomenon 
could be explained using Walter Cannon’s fight‑or‑flight 
response theory. This theory explains that when an individual 
feels stress, the autonomous nervous system is activated and 
a physiological provocation appears in response to it. At 
thatprecise time, negative feelings might be created.[34] On 
the other hand, these observations of performance disruptions 
in stressful circumstances are in direct accordance with the 
previous findings. Based on the findings of this study, the alpha 
waves are more sensitive to mental stress in comparison with 
other EEG waves.[35]
The findings of this research demonstrated that as a 
stress‑inducing factor, noise impacts cognitive performance 
and brain signals. Also, sound pressure level is an important 
factor in causing an interruption in cognitive performance, 
meaning that a low sound pressure level is not as disruptive 
in performance as a higher sound pressure level. It could 
be claimed that the findings of this study are in accordance 
with the proposition that there is a relation between weak 
performance and sound pressure level.[36] In addition to 
increasing stress level, noise has a great impact on reaction Table 2: Comparing different levels of the n‑back test

Mohebian, et al.: The analysis of the cognitive function parameters in exposure to noise
International Journal of Environmental Health Engineering ¦ 20236ability and focus. In other words, as the noise level rises, it 
will have a negative and more significant impact on focus. One 
of the explicable viewpoints avers that exposition to low‑ or 
high‑level noise is likely to hinder the brain’s stability. Stress 
is any internal or external provocation that is perceived by 
human. When the provocation is more complex and intense, 
mental and physical performance might be impaired. Stress 
compromises human efficiency and has close ties with 
mental and physical issues. It could create negative feelings 
such as anxiety and depression, and more serious stress 
could cause mental disruptions such as anxiety issues and 
melancholy.[37] In an indoor situation and amidst a stressful 
situation, each individual has a different physiological, 
emotional, or behavioral reaction.[38,39] In a study by Selye H, 
the EEG signals were used as a new method for the analysis 
of stress‑inducing circumstantial factors. Using EEG to 
bypass the limitations of physiological evaluation methods 
is suggested[37] Melamed, Samuel  et al . suggest an eclectic 
use of all the above to improve the evaluation of cognitive 
and mental stress.[40] Patricia Tassi  et al . demonstrated that 
the Stroop effect and the performance of mental calculation 
in exposure to a 50 dBA noise has increased compared to a 
70 dBA noise. Patricia Tassi  et al . reported that exposition 
to noise higher than 85 dBA could cause vulnerability, 
exhaustion, and stress; a result in accordance with the present 
study.[41] The findings of Patricia E. C. Poulton  et al . showed 
that exposure to noise decreases focus in people, a claim in 
concord with the study at hand.[42] The effects of exposure to 
high sound pressure level on cognitive performance could 
be linked to  Poulton’s  provocation model, which claims that 
confronting noise will at first heighten cognitive performance, 
mainly to increase provocation to reduce noise’s effect on 
cognitive performance. However, gradually, the provocation 
effect fades and the adverse effects of exposure to noise on 
cognitive performance begin.[43] The findings of the study 
at hand are explicable through the provocation theory. This 
theory poses that the activity level of the central nervous 
system (which alternates between sleep and vigilance) adjusts 
human’s response to stimulants. Currently, there is no general 
agreement on the credibility of this theory, and some believe 
that it could not be used to describe the relation between 
exposition to noise and cognitive performance. Nevertheless, 
bearing this theory in mind, one could aver that however 
low or high provocation is, or with every degree of stress, 
performance faces a decline.[44] In previous studies, there were 
a number of paradoxical results about the effects of noise 
on cognitive performance. A  number of studies posed that 
noise had improved cognitive performance,[45] while others 
concluded that it acted otherwise.[46] The findings of the present 
study demonstrate that the decrease in cognitive performance 
and brain signals in exposure to 85 dB noise was significant. 
This could have also been caused by psycho‑acoustic factors 
such as noise level, tonality, duration of exposition, and the 
type of noise. The importance of noise pitch and its effects 
on the brain’s cognitive performance and activity has been 
emphasized in other studies.[47‑49] Studies undertaken by Table 5: Relationship between the cognitive parameters resulted from the Emotive‑EPOC electroencephalography headset in different intervals with the intensity

Mohebian, et al.: The analysis of the cognitive function parameters in exposure to noise
International Journal of Environmental Health Engineering ¦ 20237
Allahverdy and Jafari demonstrated that the complexity of 
brain activity increases in medium frequencies and shows 
the effects of changes in frequency on brain activity.[50] The 
simplicity or complexity of the action is quite effective 
in the evaluation of cognitive performance. For instance, 
in comparison to simpler actions, more complex actions 
cause greater turbulence in cognitive performance. When 
individuals face noise, personal characteristics could be of 
noteworthy significance due to the fact that some individuals 
might experience a decline in cognitive performance while 
others might not, and some might even show symptoms of 
a rise in cognitive performance.[51] These causes are perhaps 
not so effective on this study to necessitate the analysis of 
the subjects’ mental disruptions, cardiovascular disruption, 
and behavioral anomalies. Several dimensions of the brain’s 
behavior and performance could merely be discussed based 
on the relation between neurons. All cognitive processes in the 
brain are undertaken via nervous activities such as synapses 
and spikes. Here, the analysis of brain signals demonstrated 
that frequency bands such as alpha and beta were affected by 
noise. With the increase in sound pressure level, the relative 
power of alpha increased and that of beta decreased. While 
various parts of the brain implement complex activities during 
the analysis and confrontation with noise, measuring changes 
in the temporal lobe was effective in evaluating stress. In the 
same vein, the relation of high‑beta frequency which appears 
when individuals are negatively provoked was made clear. 
Studies have shown that the alpha and beta bands, respectively 
correlate with stress levels and rapid brain activities such as 
decision‑making, analysis, and processing of data.[52] Increase 
in alpha demonstrates that the subject feels more relaxed 
after being exposed to noise, following which the decrease 
in alpha shows that he feels less tension or relaxation.[53] The 
comparison between alpha and beta bands in men and women 
and in 15, 25, 40‑min intervals, shown in Figures 1 and 2, 
reveals a significant difference; after being situated in a noisy 
place, the decrease in the range of alpha bands and the increase 
in the range of beta bands were more in women than men. 
Because the alpha bands are in correlated with relaxation and 
the beta bands with focus, the results of our study show that 
men have more relax than women and the latter have more focus in noisy places than the former. Relax might come with 
stress and a noise‑induced focus. Stress and relax signify 
emotional statements with opposite meanings.[54] A similar 
effect of noise on alpha and beta band have been reported in 
previous studies. This would mean that noise could induce 
stress in individuals. In fact, one of the ways of diagnosing 
stress is through brain signals, high range of beta bands and 
low range of alpha bands.[55]
In the study at hand, the average of unanswered and wrongly 
answered questions increased with a raise in n‑back levels 
and extension of the duration of being exposed to noise, and 
this increase was only significant for the average number of 
the answered questions. The average number of correctly 
answered questions was reduced with a rise in n‑back levels 
and the increase in the duration of exposition to noise. These 
results are in concord with the previous studies. For instance, 
Zheng‑Guang Li et al. stated that exposition to noise causes an 
increase in reaction time and the possibility of error occurrence 
in field and laboratory studies.[56] Kristiane Roed Jensen  et al. 
found a noteworthy effect of noise on memory.[20] A.Rabat et al. 
analyzed the impact of sound pressure level on the participants’ 
short‑term memory. They figured out the percentage of 
correct answers using a negative correlation.[57] Eva‑Maria 
Elmenhorst  et al. found that exposition to high sound pressure 
level, particularly when duties were medium or challenging 
in difficulty (levels 2 and 3 of n‑back test), caused a major 
reduction in focus and professional memory.[58] Smith reported 
that the speed of encrypting new data and operating a response 
is interrupted when exposed to noise and therefore changes 
are caused in the individuals’ performance.[59] Professional 
memory consists of encryption, summoning of data and 
appropriate conduct. Thus, as the complexity of an action 
grows, sound pressure level becomes responsible for distracting 
attention and processing of data within the memory, leading 
to a downfall in performance when undertaking cognitive 
duties. As a result, supervising several sources of information 
simultaneously in the presence of a distracting factor (noise) 
while doing a task becomes increasingly difficult. In simpler 
actions, a stimulating factor (noise), and on more complex 
levels, uniqueness, the newness of stimulant and distraction 
determine cognitive performance. In fact, when the burden on

Mohebian, et al.: The analysis of the cognitive function parameters in exposure to noise
International Journal of Environmental Health Engineering ¦ 20238professional memory increases, focus and therefore resistance 
against distraction decreases and disturbing stimulants lead 
to the hindering of data processing. In relation to reaction 
time, results have shown that at the presence of loud noise 
and in comparison, to quietude, the average response time to 
stimulants increase (slower response), which could be the result 
of noise‑induced stress and might have made the participant 
to respond with more latency. In a calm situation, focus and 
short‑term’s memory performance is better and reaction time 
grows faster. This is due to the absence of annoying noise.[60] 
These results are in accordance with Andrew P Smith  et al.’s 
study, whereby the analysis of noise’s effect on focus and 
short‑term memory, they found that an increase in sound 
pressure level culminates in the extension of the duration of 
time to react.[61]
The strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the study
Among the strengths of this study, we can mention the 
examination of cognitive performance parameters in the face 
of noise using the EEG Emotive‑EPOC headset. In this study, 
there was no invasive method in conducting the tests, and the 
test was stopped when the subjects felt tired. There are better 
and more efficient tools to check the memory level such as 
simple, complex, and meaningful Stroop software tests, but in 
this research, we were not able to prepare them due to financial 
problems. In this study, due to the outbreak of COVID‑19, 
some people did not attend the study and it was difficult to 
find the cooperation of some people.
conclusIon
The findings of the present study demonstrate that the decrease 
in cognitive performance and brain signals in exposure to 
85 dB noise was significant. This could have also been caused 
by psychoacoustic factors such as sound level, tonality, 
duration of exposition, and the type of sound. In relation to 
exposure time, results have shown that in the presence of loud 
noise and in comparison, to quietude, the average response 
time to stimulants increase (slower response).
