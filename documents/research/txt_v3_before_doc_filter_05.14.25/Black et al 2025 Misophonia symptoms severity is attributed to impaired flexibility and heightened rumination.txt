Misophonia links  to flexibility and rumination    
 
   
 2 Abstract  1 
Misophonia is a disorder involving sensitivity to certain sounds and related stimuli. Here, we 2 
explore the relationship between misophonia and affective flexibility, which describes cognitive 3 
shifting abilities in the face of emotion -evoking stimuli. Previous evidence suggests impaired 4 
subjective cognitive flexibility in misophonia, but this relationship has not been confirmed 5 
behaviourally or in emotionally -salient contexts. The secondary aim of this study is to test the 6 
potential association between misophonia and cognitive flexibility, building upon findings from 7 
previous research. The third objective is to examine the relationship between misophonia and 8 
rumination, a maladaptive cognitive process characterized by repetitive negative thinking and 9 
linked to both cognitive and affective inflexibility. One hundred and forty participants  completed 10 
the recently developed Memory and Affective Flexibility Task (MAFT), designed to assess affective 11 
flexibility, as well as a battery of self -report measures to evaluate misophonia severity, cognitive 12 
flexibility and rumination. Results suggested an inverse relationship between affective flexibility 13 
as measured by switch accuracy, but not reaction time, and misophonia severity. Cognitive 14 
flexibility was also inversely associated with misophonia severity, but notably did not attribute to 15 
task-based affective flexibility, suggesting two independent constructs both involved in 16 
misophonia manifestation. Rumination associated positively with misophonia severity and 17 
inversely with cognitive flexibility, but not affective flexibility. Taken together, these findings 18 
highlight a unique cognitive profile of misophonia, characterized by rigidity at the psychological 19 
level through cognitive inflexibility and rumination, as well as at the executive -function level in 20 
terms of affective switching difficulties.  21

Misophonia links  to flexibility and rumination    
 
   
 3 Introduction  1 
Misophonia is a disorder characterized by decreased tolerance to certain sounds, such as 2 
orofacial (e.g., chewing or sniffing), non -orofacial but human -based (e.g., knuckle  cracking ), or 3 
innocuous  environmental  sounds (e.g., clock ticking) . Among individuals with misophonia , these  4 
trigger sounds , and sometimes also visual (misokinesia) or other related sensory stimuli, evoke 5 
strong emotional reactions such as anger, irritation, disgust, and (anticipatory) anxiety  (Swedo et 6 
al., 2022) . These emotional reactions are accompanied by autonomic nervous system arousal 7 
(Edelstein et al., 2013; Oszczapinska et al., 2024)  and altered neural activity in areas including 8 
those related to emotion processing , the salience of sensory stimuli , and motor control  (Kumar 9 
et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2017; Schroder et al., 2019) . Resulting behavioural  responses, such as 10 
aggression, anger outbursts and avoidance, often cause significant impairment in daily life, 11 
especially in the case of more severe misophonia  (Brout et al., 2018) . Despite prevalence 12 
estimates ranging from 4.6%  to 20% (Dixon et al., 2024; Vitoratou et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2014; 13 
Zhou et al., 2017) , research on misophonia , especially its treatment , is still at its early stages  14 
(Rosenthal et al., 2023; Swedo et al., 2022)  15 
Evidence  has highlighted the presence of executive functioning deficits in individuals with 16 
misophonia  in areas such as  cognitive  control,  response bias, emotion regulation and attention al 17 
processing  (Daniels et al., 2020; Eijsker et al., 2019; Guetta et al., 2022; Murphy et al., 2024; 18 
Simner et al., 2021) . Those affected often show a tendency to hyper -focus on certain bothersome 19 
sounds (misophonic triggers) and face significant challenges in shiftin g attention away from th ese 20 
stimuli (Edelstein et al., 2013; Jager et al., 2020) . They show selective attention deficits in 21 
response to trigger sounds as well as hypervigilant anticipation , including anticipatory 22 
anxiety  (Murphy et al., 2024; Sanchez & Silva, 2018) . This pattern may reflect deficits in 23 
attentional set-shifting , a core feature of cognitive inflexibility , which is defined as the inability to 24 
disengage  from irrelevant stimuli and redirect attention to information relevant to the task or 25 
situation at hand (Horning & Davis, 2012; Uddin, 2021) . In support of this idea, there is evidence 26 
of higher self -reported cognitive inflexibility among those with misophonia (Simner et al., 2021) . 27 
Cognitive flexibility, which facilitates  efficient shift ing between mental processes to 28 
produce contextually appropriate behavioural  responses, follows a protracted developmental 29 
trajectory and is frequently impaired in numerous common neurodevelopmental and psychiatric 30 
disorders  (Dajani & Uddin, 2015; Morris & Mansell, 2018) , includ ing obsessive -compulsive 31 
disorder (OCD ) (Gruner & Pittenger, 2017) , anorexia nervosa (AN ) (Miles et al., 2020) , autism 32 
spectrum disorder (ASD ) (Albein -Urios et al., 2018; Lage et al., 2023) , Post -Traumatic Stress 33 
Disorder (PTSD) (Popescu et al., 2023) , and a ttention -deficit and hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) 34 
(Zhang et al., 2023) . Misophonia shows substantive comorbidity with these conditions, and the 35 
presence of such comorbidities relate to severity of misophonia as well  (Andermane, Bauer, 36 
Simner, et al., 2023; Erfanian et al., 2019; Kluckow et al., 2014; Rinaldi et al., 2023; Rouw & 37 
Erfanian, 2018; Wu et al., 2014) . The occurrence  of these symptoms  suggests potential overlap 38 
of neurobiological or psychological mechanisms , and cognitive flexibility is one such candidate 39 
mechanism.  40 
It remains , however , unclear whether cognitive inflexibility in misophonia manifests 41 
primarily in the face of triggers vs. across a broad range of contexts. There are some indications 42

Misophonia links  to flexibility and rumination    
 
   
 4 that the cognitive inflexibility may be broad. For instance, misophonia symptoms are associated 1 
with a greater aversion to expectation violation in social contexts, suggesting a broader inflexible 2 
application of social standards to others’ behaviour  (Banker et al., 2022) . Furthermore, 3 
misophonia has repeatedly been associated with perfectionism (Jager et al., 2020; Jakubovski et 4 
al., 2022) , which is a process associated with cognitive inflexibility, characterized by a  rigid  pursuit 5 
of unrealistic personal goals and standards  (Egan et al., 2011) . In other words, perfectionism may 6 
contribute to misophonia by fostering a tendency to inflexibly identify with negative self -views  7 
when self-imposed standards are not met (Nguyen & Morris, 2024) . Perfectionists show  an 8 
attentional bias that directs greater focus toward negative information than positive information  9 
(Shafran et al., 2002) . In the context of misophonia, this translates to an intensified focus on 10 
negatively perceived sounds  (Simner et al., 2021) . These findings may reflect cognitive inflexibility 11 
among individuals with misophonia that extends beyond contexts specifically associated with 12 
triggering stimuli.  13 
Task -Based correlates of cognitive flexibility in misophonia  14 
To understand cognitive flexibility in misophonia, it is crucial to examine whether  deficits 15 
shown on self -report data can also be reflected in a neurocognitive task. Self-report data may not 16 
accurately capture deficits in executive  functioning as they tend to emphasize personality -level 17 
traits of flexibility rather than task -specific performance  (Buchanan, 2016) . In this respect, 18 
behavioural studies have yet to establish a consistent link between task -based cognitive flexibility 19 
and misophonia . For instance,  despite reduced cognitive flexibility reported  in questionnaire s 20 
(Simner et al., 2021) , individuals  with misophonia  do not appear to perform differently on the 21 
Wisconsin  Card Sorting Task  (WCST)  (Abramovitch et al., 2023) , a task in which perseverative 22 
responses/perseverative errors are often considered to reflect cognitive inflexibility  (Miles et al., 23 
2021) . This discrepancy may stem from inconsistent definitions of cognitive inflexibility, as well as 24 
methodological and reporting biases, which likely underlie  lack of connection  between self - 25 
reported measures of cognitive flexibility and performance on neuropsychological tasks . In 26 
addition, self -report measures  may  not be reliable  proxies for neuropsychological tasks of 27 
cognitive flexibility  (Howlett et al., 2021) . As such ,  the self -reported cognitive flexibility among 28 
those with miso phonia (Simner et al., 2021)  may not inform  the extent  to which  individuals with 29 
misophonia show impairments in set shifting  or task switching , core components  intricately linked 30 
to cognitive flexibility (Dajani & Uddin, 2015; Stemme et al., 2007) .  31 
Affective Flexibility in Misophonia: Cognitive Flexibility in Emotional 32 
Contexts  33 
Another  possible reason for the previous null findings regarding task -based cognitive 34 
flexibility in individuals affected by misophonia, would be that cognitive inflexibility is evoked only 35 
in the presence  of triggers  (e.g.,  orofacial sounds)  or other relevant stimuli . For instance, the 36 
association between impaired cognitive control and misophonia severity was specific to 37 
performance  on the Stroop task in the presence of misophonia trigger  sounds , with misophonia 38 
severity not relating to Stroop effect when faced with sounds considered to be generally 39

 5 unpleasant  (Daniels et al., 2020) . This could indicat e that specific executive functioning deficits 1 
may only be present in certain contexts among individuals  with misophonia .  2 
Further, t he WCST contains only neutral stimuli , which we hypothesize may not be 3 
sufficient to evoke impairments in shifting or switching abilities in misophonic people.  4 
Considering the role of emotion regulation deficit s in misophonia (Dixon et al., 2024; Guetta et 5 
al., 2022) , emotionally  evocative stimuli could be necessary to evoke significant inflexibility in 6 
behavioural  responding during a task by individuals with misophonia.   The potential importance 7 
of affective stimuli to evoking flexibility deficits can be shown by drawing parallels with previous 8 
research in ASD, which has shown a relationship with misophonia in the form of heightened 9 
presence of autistic traits  (Rinaldi et al., 2023) . Task-switching paradigms revealed that switch 10 
costs associated with autism were specific to trials involving switching attention either to or away 11 
from emotional stimuli, with directional findings referring to variations in these costs based on 12 
the direction of the shift. In other words, these costs differ by direction, reflecting distinct 13 
cognitive processes engaged by emotional salience (De Vries & Geurts, 2012; Latinus et al., 2019) . 14 
Cognitive  flexibility in response to emotion -evoking stimuli is referred to as affective  flexibility 15 
(Eckart et al., 2021) . Hence i n the present study, we use a novel neurocognitive task, the Memory 16 
and Affective Flexibility Task (Allen et al., Under review)  that incorporates neutral and 17 
emotionally -arousing  stimuli in working memory and affective flexibility trials  (Lang & Bradley, 18 
2007) .  19 
Rumination: A key process related to inflexibility potentially involved in 20 
misophonia  21 
Rumination is recognized as a transdiagnostic process associated with cognitive and 22 
affective inflexibility (Altamirano et al., 2010; Davis & Nolen -Hoeksema, 2000; Genet et al., 2013; 23 
Morris & Mansell, 2018) . Defined as repetitive, self -focused thought related to  negative emotions 24 
and their origins, rumination is pervasive across a range of psychiatric disorders  (Treynor et al., 25 
2003) . Inherently rigid and maladaptive, r umination involves cycling through the same negative 26 
thoughts  without transitioning to more adaptive cognitive approaches . Inflexibility may manifest 27 
in rumination through  deficits  in the ability to di sengage  from negative emotional elements of 28 
stimuli , resulting in  difficulty shifting focus from negative to neutral or positive cognitions (Genet 29 
et al., 2013; Koster et al., 2011) . In misophonia, rumination may manifest as inflexible, repetitive 30 
negative thinking, not only about trigger stimuli and their sources but also involving internally 31 
focused thoughts, such as judgments about the misophonic reaction itself. Misophonic 32 
individuals  tend to  ruminate even when no triggers are present, such as by anticipating what 33 
trigger sounds may come next or replaying previous triggering situations (Vitoratou et al., 2021) . 34 
Although people with misophonia do anecdotally report rumination surrounding their 35 
misophonic experience , it remains unclear to what extent ruminati ve thinking  is pervasive in 36 
broader contexts as an overarching cognitive tendency  in people with misophonia . Thus, In the 37 
current investigation, we ask whether  this tendency to ruminate extends more generally to daily 38 
life, both about misophonia and other unrelated topics. We aim to explore rumination as a 39 
potential manifestation of cognitive and affective inflexibility in misophonia, focusing here on 40 
three subtypes: perseverative thinking (Ehring et al., 2011) , brooding (Treynor et al., 2003) , and 41 
anger rumination (Sukhodolsky et al., 2001) .  42

 6 Current study  1 
By employing a neurocognitive task (Allen et al., Under review) , the first aim is to evaluate 2 
the relationship between affective flexibility performance and the severity of misophonia 3 
symptoms . The MAFT  is designed to  assess  affective flexibility , which may be relevant to 4 
individuals with misophonia  as well as broader psychopathology (Friedman & Banich, 2019) . We 5 
predict an  association of self -reported misophonia severity with affective inflexibility, as indexed 6 
by worse performance on the MAFT switch trials in terms of reduced accuracy  and slower 7 
Reaction T ime (RT) (H1).   8 
In addition, we examine the relationship between self -reported cognitive inflexibility and 9 
the severity of misophonia , expecting to replicate the findings of Simner et al.  (H2) and we predict 10 
a positive association between diminished cognitive flexibility and the severity of misophonia 11 
symptoms . Furthermore, we evaluate the association between self -reported cognitive inflexibility 12 
and task -based indices of affective flexibility, specifically switch accuracy and switch RT , derived 13 
from the MAFT  to examine whether self -report flexibility aligns with task -based measures . We 14 
hypothesize that self -reported and task -based measures of flexibility w ill be positively correlated, 15 
showing  a convergence between cognitive and affective dimensions of flexibility  (H3). This 16 
investigation aims to deepen understanding of the interplay between subjective and objective 17 
facets of flexibility and their relevance to misophonia severity.  18 
Additionally , we explore the association  between rumination , misophonia  severity , 19 
affective  flexibility , given  affective  inflexibility , specifically the difficulty in disengaging from 20 
processing the emotional aspect  of negative stimuli , has been linked to increased rumination in 21 
daily life  (Genet et al., 2013) . In particular , we  expect to find a positive relationship between 22 
increased self -reported rumination , and misophonia severity  as well as worse switch accuracy 23 
and switch RT to correspond with greater levels of rumination  (H4). As part of our exploratory 24 
analyses, we also examine the relationship between cognitive flexibility and measures of 25 
rumination. We hypothesize that decreased cognitive flexibility will be positively correlated with 26 
increased levels of rumination  (H5) . 27 
Method  28 
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Committee for Protection of Human 29 
Subjects at the University of California, Berkeley  (CPHS protocol ID 2024 -01-17038).  The study 30 
was pre -registered on OSF ( https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/UCBG4 ) before the creation of data.  31 
Participants  32 
The sample comprised 140 participants (mean age = 29.98 ± 6.72 year s; 49 females, 91  33 
male s). Of those,  128 participants were recruited from Prolific (www.prolific.com ), an online  34 
study participant pool , and 12 were volunteer participants recruited from misophonia -related 35 
newsletters ; specifically, the soQuiet Misophonia Research Pool ( www.soquiet.org/pool ) and 36 
Misophonia International  (www.misophoniainternational.com ).  37

Specifically, 18.75% of Prolific participants ( N = 24) endorsed significant misophonia. This rate  is 9 
highly similar to the rate of significant misophonia  on the S -Five (18.4%) found by previous 10 
research in a general population  (Vitoratou et al., 2023) . Out of the volunteers identified from 11 
misophonia -related newsletters, 91.67% ( N = 11) endorsed significant misophonia  (Figure 1) . 12

Figure 2. Sequence and timing of stimulus events in the Memory and Affective Flexibility (MAFT) task. A standard block design was 2 
used, in which images were presented for 1500 ms with 500 ms fixation cross as intertrial intervals.  Participants judged whether 3 
the current image matched or mismatched the image presented 1, 2, or 3 trials prior by pressing “A” for match and “L” for 4 
mismatch. After each trial, participants received visual feedback indicating the accuracy of their response, displayed as either 5 
“CORRECT” or “ERROR” on the screen.  In switch trials, they assessed the valence of emotional images (positive, negative or neutral) 6 
from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS ) (Lang & Bradley, 2007) , pressing “K” for negative and “S” for positive . 7 
 8 
In the MAFT , participants engaged in two types of trials: memory trials and emotional 9 
switch trials. Memory trials required participants to determine whether the current image 10 
matched one shown N trials earlier, measuring working memory. Emotional switch trials, 11 
randomly interspersed within the task, required participants to rapidly evaluate whether an 12 
image was positive or negative, measuring affective flexibility. The working memory trials were 13 
based on the widely used N-back task (Owen et al., 2005) , designed to measure behavioural 14 
responses to emotional and non -emotional stimuli. Switch trials assessed affective flexibility, as 15 
they required participants to shift from a memory -based response to evaluating emotional 16 
valence, reflecting task switching in the context of affective stimuli. For the current study, only 17 
switch accuracy and switch RT were of interest (Figure 2) . 18 
The MAFT consisted of 198 trials organized into nine experimental blocks, with 19 
participants completing three valence -specific blocks (positive, negative, neutral) for each level 20 
of N-back difficulty ( N = 1, 2, and 3). Each block included 20 + N trials to account for initial 21 
“mismatch” stimuli before the first potential “match” target. Prior to the experimental blocks, 22 
participants completed two practice blocks with 500 ms trial -level feedback, repeating them until 23 
they achieved at least 70% accuracy on N-back trials at N = 1 (11 trials) and N = 2 (12 trials). 24 
Approximately 60% of trials within each block were N-back trials (12 + N per block), consisting of 25 
four “match” trials and the remainder as “mismatch” trials, with emotional valences congruent 26 
with the block type. The remaining 40% (~8 trials per block) were switch trials, which alternated 27 
between emotional valences and were presented in a pseudo -randomized order. Stimuli were 28 
drawn without replacement from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) image pool 29 
(Lang & Bradley, 2007) , with negative and positive image sets matched on standardized arousal 30 
and valence ratings (negative: arousal M = 5.94 ± 0.77; valence M = 7.22 ± 1.04; positive: arousal 31

Misophonia links  to flexibility and rumination    
 
   
 9 M = 5.22 ± 1.02; valence M = 7.15 ± 0.79), and neutral images selected for low arousal (M = 2.88 1 
± 0.57) and intermediate valence (M = 4.98 ± 0.30)  (Figure 2) . 2 
Performance metrics included accuracy, calculated as the proportion of correct “match” 3 
hits and “mismatch” rejections for  N-back trials and the proportion of correctly classified positive 4 
and negative stimuli for switch trials, as well as RT , calculated as the mean response time for 5 
correct trials, consistent with prior research  (Eckart et al., 2021, Malooly et al., 2013).  Neutral 6 
stimuli in switch trials were analysed  for interpretive bias, with the proportion categorized as 7 
negative serving as an index. Neutral stimuli were predominantly classified as positive (M = 0.64 8 
± 0.11), providing insight into the evaluation of stimuli without salient emotional content.  9 
In memory trials, participants responded by pressing “A” for a match and “L” for a 10 
mismatch, while in switch trials, they judged emotional valence, pressing “K” for negative and “S” 11 
for positive. Recent findings suggest that RT may not be specific to trial type, as RT indices are 12 
highly correlated across tasks, indicating it may reflect general motor or cognitive processing 13 
speed rather than task -specific variables (Allen et al., Under review) . Although both accuracy and 14 
RT were pre -registered for the switch task, recent evidence highlights accuracy as the more 15 
meaningful measure of affective flexibility; therefore, both metrics are reported here.  16 
Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Scale (S -Five, (Vitoratou et al., 2021) )  17 
Misophonia symptom severity was assessed using the 25 -item Selective Sound Sensitivity 18 
Syndrome Scale (S -Five)  (Vitoratou et al., 2021) . The S -Five scale is designed to assess five 19 
different dimensions of misophonia severity: externalizing, internalizing, impact, threat, and 20 
outburst , as well as overall severity . Participants are asked to  respond to questions (e.g. “The way 21 
I react to certain sounds makes me wonder whether deep inside I am just a bad person” and “The 22 
way I feel/react to certain sounds will eventually isolate me and prevent me from doing everyday 23 
things”) on a 10 -point scale, ranging from (0) for not at all true to (10) for completely true. The 24 
maximum possible score on the S -Five is 250.  A score of 87 or above indicate s significant 25 
misophonia as suggested by ROC analysis (Vitoratou et al., 2021) . The S -Five has previously 26 
exhibited good internal consistency ( α >= 0.83) and strong test -retest reliability (ICC >= 0.86) for 27 
all factors, as well as good convergent and discriminant validity.  In the  current study, the S -Five 28 
showed excellent internal consistency ( α = 0.96).  29 
Detail and Flexibility Questionnaire (D flex, (Roberts et al., 2011) ) 30 
The 12 -item flexibility subscale of the Detail and Flexibility Questionnaire (DFlex) was 31 
included as a self -report measure of cognitive inflexibility (Roberts et al., 2011) . In a previous 32 
study, participants classified as having misophonia scored significantly higher for inflexibility on 33 
this questionnaire compared to those without misophonia (Simner et al., 2021) . Participants 34 
rated each item (e.g., “I can be called stubborn or single minded as it is difficult to shift from one 35 
point of view to another”) on a 6 -point Likert scale ranging from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly 36 
Agree (6). Total scores range from 12 to 72, with higher scores indicating greater levels of 37 
inflexibility. This scale has previously demonstrated very high internal consistency ( α = 0.93) as 38 
well as strong construct and discriminant validity. In the current study, the DFlex flexibility 39 
subscale showed good internal consistency ( α = 0.83).  40

 10 The Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ , (Ehring et al., 2011)  1 
Perseverative thinking , a measure of Repetitive Negative Thinking (RNT),  was assessed 2 
using the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ) (Ehring et al., 2011) . RNT describes the 3 
transdiagnostic process of unproductive, repetitive thinking, and rumination is one form of RNT 4 
(Ehring et al., 2011) . Participants were asked to rate how each of 15 statements applied to them 5 
in terms of how they typically think about their negative experiences or problems. Participants 6 
responded using a 5 -point Likert scale, from Never (0) to Almost Always (4). Example statements 7 
include “The same thoughts keep going through my mind again and again” and “I can’t do 8 
anything else while thinking about my problems ”. The higher -order PTQ scale has previously 9 
exhibited excellent internal consistency ( α = 0.94 - 0.95), as well as good internal consistency for 10 
subscales (Core Characteristics of RNT: α = 0.92 - 0.94; Unproductiveness of RNT: α = 0.77 - 0.87; 11 
RNT Capturing Mental Capacity: α = 0.82 - 0.90); satisfactory test -retest reliability (total score 12 
retest correlation = 0.69), and good convergent validity (Ehring et al., 2011) . In the current sample, 13 
the higher -order PTQ scale also showed excellent internal consistency ( α = 0.95).  14 
Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS , (Treynor et al., 2003) ) 15 
Brooding rumination was assessed using the 5 -item Brooding subscale of the Ruminative 16 
Responses Scale (RRS -B), which is considered the maladaptive form of rumination and has been 17 
implicated in the development of psychiatric disorders, such as depressive symptoms  (Treynor et 18 
al., 2003) . Participants responded using a 4 -point Likert scale ranging from Almost Never ( 1) to 19 
Almost Always (4), rating how often they engage with an indicated thought or mental behaviour  20 
when down, sad, or depressed. Items included, for example, “Think ‘What am I doing to deserve 21 
this?’” or “Think about a recent situation, wishing it had gone better.” This scale has demonstrated 22 
acceptable reliability ( α = 0.77) with a test -retest correlation of 0.62 in previous research (Treynor 23 
et al., 2003) . In the current sample, the RRS -B showed good internal consistency ( α = 0.81).  24 
Anger Rumination Scale (ARS , (Sukhodolsky et al., 2001) ) 25 
Anger rumination was assessed using the Anger Rumination Scale (ARS) (Sukhodolsky et 26 
al., 2001) . The ARS comprises 19 items designed to measure the inclination to mentally engage 27 
with past episodes or feelings of anger. Participants are asked to rate each of the 19 items on a 28 
Likert  scale ranging from Almost Never (1) to Almost Always (4), with higher scores indicating 29 
heightened anger rumination. Example items include statements like "Memories of even minor 30 
annoyances bother me for a while" and “I re -enact the anger episode in my mind after it has 31 
happened.”  The ARS includes four subscales: angry afterthoughts, thoughts of revenge, angry 32 
memories, and understanding of causes. The ARS has previously exhibited adequate internal 33 
consistency, test -retest reliability, as well as both convergent and divergent validity (Sukhodolsky 34 
et al., 2001) . In this study, the internal consistency was excellent ( α = 0.93).  35 
Screening for Anxiety and Depression in Tinnitus -Hyperacusis -Misophonia (SAD -T, 36 
(Aazh, Hayes, et al., 2022) ) 37 
The 4 -item Screening for Anxiety and Depression in Tinnitus -Hyperacusis -Misophonia 38 
(SAD -T) is a brief measure of anxiety and depression and has been validated in samples with 39 
auditory conditions (Aazh, Hayes, et al., 2022) . A score of 4 or higher on this measure is 40

Misophonia links  to flexibility and rumination    
 
   
 11 considered the threshold for anxiety or depression symptoms. Participants are asked to rate how 1 
often they are bothered by the problems described in each item, with statements such as “Feeling 2 
nervous, anxious or on edge” and “Feeling down, depressed or hopeless.” In previous research, 3 
the SAD -T has shown good internal consistency ( α = 0.91) and satisfactory ITC values between 4 
0.76 and 0.84 (Aazh et al., 2024) . In the current sample, the SAD -T showed excellent internal 5 
consistency ( α = 0.90).   6 
Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire (SSSQ,  (Aazh & Kula, Under review) ) 7 
The Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire (SSSQ) is a 6 -item questionnaire designed 8 
to measure symptoms of abnormal sound intolerance, specifically hyperacusis and misophonia. 9 
Participants are asked to rate how often each of the statements apply to them, with scores on 10 
each item ranging from 0 to 3, corresponding  to different frequency intervals (e.g. 0 to 1, 2 to 6,7 11 
to 10, and 11 to 14 days). Example statements include “Pain in your ears when hearing certain 12 
loud sounds? Examples: loud music, sirens, motorcycles, building work, lawn mower, train 13 
stations” and “Fear that certain sounds may make your hearing and/or tinnitus worse?”. Total 14 
scores range from 0 to 18, with a total score of 4 considered to be the threshold for presence of 15 
sound sensitivity (Aazh et al., 2024) . We included this measure to control for symptoms of 16 
hyperacusis, which has a high rate of co -occurrence with misophonia (Ahmmed & Vijayakumar, 17 
2024; Andermane, Bauer, Sohoglu, et al., 2023) . The previous version of SSSQ , which had 5 items , 18 
has shown good internal consistency ( α = 0.87) as well as convergent and construct validity (Aazh 19 
et al., 2024). Here we utilized a new version with 6 items , which based on data from the authors  20 
showed a good Cronbach alpha estimate ( 𝛼 = 0.80), acceptable McDonald’s ω with values of 0.80, 21 
and test -retest reliability with an r -value of 0.81 well above Cohen`s suggested threshold for high 22 
correlation. In the current sample, the 6 -item version  showed acceptable internal consistency ( α 23 
= 0.7 7) as well as when removing item -4 (which measures misophonia) from the scale ( α = 0.71).  24 
Procedure  25 
We first recruited participants through Prolific ( www.prolific.com ), an academic research - 26 
focused crowdsourcing platform. Eligibility criteria as screened using the demographic pre -screen 27 
feature on Prolific included age of 18 -45, since individuals within this age range generally have 28 
similar audiological profiles, allowing control for hearing impairment/other periphery issues (Lee 29 
et al., 2012) ; no hearing loss or hearing difficulties; absence of cognitive impairment or dementia, 30 
normal or corrected -to-normal vision; fluency in English, and willingness to be exposed to 31 
distressing stimuli, considering the graphic nature of images included in the MAFT task. In 32 
addition, although no formal screening was used for comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, this was 33 
included as an exclusion criterion in the study ad vert and consent form (phrased as “No current 34 
psychiatric diagnosis or cognitive impairment” in the eligibility section).  35 
Eligible participants based on Prolific pre -screen filter  were shown a study advert briefly 36 
describing the procedures  and also stating the compensation amount of $6.73 total USD  (~ €6.56  37 
or ~ £5.51) . This compensation amount is equivalent to an estimated rate of $9.58 per hour (~ 38 
€9.34 or ~ £7.85) based on the median completion time of 42 .06 min. Two participants, recruited 39 
from Prolific during the pilot stage of the study, were compensated in the approximate GBP 40 
equivalent to 6.73 USD based on the conversion rate at the time of the study.  41

 12 After recruitment of participants via Prolific, we initiated an email campaign targeting 1 
newsletters (mentioned in participants section ) aimed at individuals interested in volunteering 2 
for misophonia research. Those potential participants were sent the same study description and 3 
inclusion/ exclusion criteria used in the Prolific advert. Those who expressed interest were 4 
directed to a Qualtrics pre -screen survey to assess the same criteria (with identical wording of 5 
questions used to filter Prolific participants ). Volunteer participants recruited from newsletters 6 
were not compensated for their time  and were made aware of this before participation . This 7 
limitation arose from the requirement to exchange identifiable information, such as PayPal 8 
account details, which posed privacy and confidentiality concerns.  9 
All participants were directed via URL to Qualtrics (www.qualtrics.com ) to provide 10 
informed consent.  This involved a description of the nature of images they might encounter 11 
during the MAFT task  and participants were required to indicate their willingness to proceed 12 
knowing they would be exposed to such images. Upon providing consent, participants were 13 
redirected from Qualtrics to complete the Memory and Affective Flexibility Task via Inquisit Web 14 
version 6.6.1 ( www.millisecond.com ).  15 
After completing the MAFT , participants were directed back to Qualtrics, where they re - 16 
entered their subject ID (Prolific -generated for Prolific participants, and Qualtrics -generated for 17 
volunteers), reported their age and gender, and then completed a battery of questionnaires  (e.g., 18 
S-Five, rumination questionnaires , including the  ARS, PTQ , RRS-B, SSSQ, SAD -T, and DFlex ). Seven 19 
attention checks were included in the questionnaire battery, with one per questionnaire, in an 20 
Instructional Manipulation Checks format (e.g. “Please select ‘Often’ for this question”).  21 
The entire study, including both MAFT and all questionnaires, took an estimated 40 to 45 22 
mins, with a median study completion time of ~42 mins. Upon adequate completion of the 23 
battery, Prolific -recruited participants were provided with a completion code and instructed to 24 
return to Prolific to receive compensation through the platform. Participants failing two or more 25 
attention checks received a custom code indicating failure and would have been requested to 26 
return their submission without compensation; however, no participants failed based on this 27 
criterion  (Figure 3). Volunteer participants were not redirected upon completion, and the study 28 
concluded once they completed all components.  29 
Upon completion, Prolific -recruited participants' self -reported demographic data became 30 
available for download via Prolific, with optional data first language, nationality, country of birth, 31 
student status, and employment status. This data was matched to participants' Inquisit and 32 
Qualtrics data using Prolific ID; however, demographic data was not used for analysis purposes in 33 
the current study.  34 
A total of 199 participants were recruited for the study, of whom 163 completed the 35 
MAFT : 142 from Prolific and 21 from outreach to newsletters . We excluded participants who did 36 
not complete the MAFT in full (N = 20) or attempted the MAFT task multiple times before 37 
completion ( N = 1), or did not complete the Qualtrics questionnaires in full despite completing 38 
the MAFT ( N = 2), leaving a final sample  size of 140  (Figu re 3) . None of those participants failed 39 
two or more of the seven attention checks.  40

Figure 3. Diagram of online experiment progression. The diagram illustrates the study procedure, detailing each step from 3 
initiation to completion, along with the number of participants remaining at each stage. 199 subjects were initially recruited for 4 
the study. Of 157 Prolific participants, 142 attempted the MAFT, while 21 of 42 volunteers did so. From 163 total participants, 5 
exclusions included incomplete MAFT (N = 20), multiple attempts (N = 1), and incomplete questionnaires despite completing MAF T 6 
(N = 2), leaving N = 140. The final analysis included 140 participants who successfully completed the study. Only participant s 7 
providing consent began the experiment. If the participants did not read the information sheet or did not consent, they were 8 
debriefed and directed to the end of the experiment.  9

 14 Independent  and Dependant  variables  1 
Our key independent variables included MAFT switch accuracy and switch RT indices, 2 
along measures of cognitive flexibility (DFlex) , perseverative thinking (PTQ), brooding (RRS -B), and 3 
anger rumination (ARS) . The dependent variables consisted of the S -Five total score and its five 4 
subscales. Possible confounding variables examined in the study were the total scores of the SSSQ 5 
and SAD -T, as well as gender.  6 
The rationale behind controlling for hyperacusis as confounding variable was driven by the 7 
heightened SSSQ scores, suggestive of hyperacusis, in participants with significant misophonia. 8 
This pattern persisted even after excluding the misophonia -specific item (item 4). This is 9 
consistent with previous findings of heightened comorbidity with audiological disorders like 10 
tinnitus and hyperacusis (Aazh, Erfanian, et al., 2022) . However, misophonia can also occur 11 
without audiological abnormalities (Swedo et al., 2022) . Thus, where warranted, we include 12 
additional tests for all primary hypotheses with the SSSQ as a covariate in order to control for 13 
hyperacusis.  14 
Evidence suggests that there is a high prevalence of depression and anxiety in individuals 15 
with misophonia (Aazh, Erfanian, et al., 2022; Danesh & Aazh, 2020; Erfanian et al., 2018; Erfanian 16 
et al., 2019; Erfanian & Rouw, 2018; Jager et al., 2020; McKay et al., 2018; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018; 17 
Siepsiak et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2014) . Hence, we also control for depression and anxiety by 18 
incorporating the SAD -T score as a covariate in each regression model . 19 
Data Analytic Plan  20 
Pre-processing  21 
We pre -processed  MAFT  data using Pytho n (Foundation, 2022) , consistent with the 22 
methods of (Allen et al., Under review) . All further statistical analyses were conducted using R 23 
version 4.3.1 (Team, 2023)  and MATLAB 2019b (MATLAB, 2019)  with an alpha set at 0.05. Bivariate 24 
Pearson  correlations were calculated for all measures to assess overlap and correlations between 25 
variables.  26 
Implausibly fast responses (< 200 ms) and missed responses (> 4500 ms), where 27 
participants were only allowed to register a response within the 4500 ms trial period, were 28 
excluded. Following the approach outlined in (Allen et al., Under review) , trial-level outlier RTs 29 
with Z-scores > |3| were trimmed. Participants with a switch omission rate exceeding 0.5 were 30 
also excluded from analysis.  31 
Across other measures , we reviewed outliers  > 3 SD. These outliers (S -Five: two 32 
participants > 3 SD above the mean total score; ARS: one participant >  3 SD above the mean, and 33 
one < 3 SD below the mean) were retained in the data as they likely reflected natural variation, 34 
not measurement error. However, primary analyses were conducted both with and without 35 
outliers for comparison purposes to ensure consistency of findings.  36 
Participants were categorized as experiencing clinical  misophonia using a threshold score 37 
of 87 indicating significant  misophonia (Vitoratou et al., 2023) . Group differences were analysed  38 
using Χ² tests for nominal variables and Welch t -tests for continuous variables. Due to a significant 39 
difference in gender ratio between groups, primary analyses were repeated with gender as a 40 
covariate to ensure consistency.   41

 15 Model specification (Multiple Linear Modelling)  1 
 To address the primary research questions, a series of Multiple Linear Models (MLMs) were 2 
conducted to examine the relationships between MAFT performance (switch accuracy and switch 3 
RT) as independent variables and misophonia severity, using the S -Five total score and its five 4 
subscales: externalizing, internalizing impact, threat, and outburst, as dependant variables.  5 
Separate parallel regression models were performed to investigate associations between 6 
cognitive flexibility, and rumination including the PTQ, RRS -B, and ARS as independent  variables , 7 
misophonia severity  and its subscales as the depend ent variable s. This resulted in 36 regression 8 
models. Gender , depression, anxiety and hyperacusis  were included as covariate s in models 9 
predicting S -Five scores to control for potential confounding effects. As no significant correlations 10 
were found between MAFT indices and the SAD -T or SSSQ measures, these variables were 11 
excluded as covariates in analyses of the relationships between switch accuracy and switch RT 12 
and S -Five scores.  13 
Subsequently, we conducted independent regression models to examine the relationships 14 
between cognitive flexibility and rumination, including the PTQ , RRS -B, and ARS (dependent 15 
variables ), resulting in a total of 3 models , while  controll ing for covariate s.  16 
For the mediation analyses exploring the interaction between rumination and cognitive 17 
factors in predicting misophonia severity, DFlex, ARS, RRS -B, and PTQ were included as 18 
independent variables, with the S -Five total score as the dependent variable. The same covariates 19 
were retained for consistency across analytical frameworks  (3 models) .  20 
Results   21 
Correlation between study variables  22 
 To establish  the linearity  between all pairs of variables, including independent , mediating  23 
and dependant  variables, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. The variables analysed  24 
included the MAFT affective inflexibility indices including switch accuracy and switch RT , self- 25 
reported cognitive inflexibility measured by the DFlex, three rumination measures (PTQ, ARS, and 26 
RRS-B), misophonia severity as assessed by the S -Five total score and its subscales (externalizing, 27 
internalizing, impact, threat, and outburst) , anxiety and depression symptoms assessed using the 28 
SAD-T, and hyperacusis measured by the SSSQ (Figure 4) . 29 
Switch a ccuracy  but not switch  RT is associated with  S-Five total , internalization, 30 
impact and outburst facto rs 31 
Initially, we  investigate d the relationship  of affective flexibility, as measured using switch 32 
accuracy and switch RT of the MAFT , with the severity of misophonia . As illustrated in Figure 5 ,  33 
switch accuracy on the MAFT demonstrated a significant inverse relationship with  overall 34 
misophonia severity (total score ; β = -0.21, t = -2.56, p = 0.01 , as well as the internalizing  (β  = - 35 
0.24, t = -2.87,  p < 0.01) , impact  (β = -0.38, t = -4.86, p < 0.0 01), and outburst domains  (β = -0.26, 36 
t = -3.16, p < 0.01) , but not the threat (β = -0.04, t = -0.48, p = 0.63) and externalizing (β = -0.06, t 37 
= -0.70, p = 0.49) domains . After  excluding the two participants who scored > 3 SD above  the 38 
mean S -Five total score, the relationship between switch accuracy and S-Five total score remained 39

 16 
significant ( β = -0.24, t = -2.94, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the relationship between switch accuracy 1 
and misophonia severity was robust after controlling for gender (β = -0.24,  t = -2.88, p < 0.01).  2

Figure 4. Correlation matrix of variables. The correlation matrix displays Pearson correlation coefficients among all study variables, 25 
with relationships represented by colour coding and size scaling. The size and colour gradient of the circles indicate the st rength 26 
of the correlations, with warm colours (red) denoting negative correlations and cool colours (blue) denoting positive correla tions. 27 
Circles marked with crosses represent non -significant correlations (p ≥ 0.05).  28 
As shown in Figure 4 , switch accuracy was not significantly correlated with SAD -T score ( β 29 
= -0.04, t = -0.49, p = 0.62) nor with the SSSQ (misophonia question excluded), ( β = -0.07, t= -0.79, 30 
p = 0.43), indicating that the relationship between switch accuracy and misophonia severity may 31 
be independent of comorbid anxiety, depression, or hyperacusis.  32 
Given the absence of significant correlations between the switch RT index and the  other  33 
variables of interest, as determined by Pearson correlation analysis, switch RT was excluded from 34 
subsequent multivariate analyses.  Although not significant, our findings are consistent  with those 35 
of (Allen et al., Under review) , reporting  that RT indices were highly correlated across all MAFT 36 
summary metrics of affective flexibility. This pattern suggests that RT scores may primarily reflect 37 
individual differences in processing or motor response speed rather than specific effects of task 38 
conditions  (Allen et al., Under review) . 39

 17 Participants with significant misophonia score worse for switch accuracy on the 1 
MAFT but do not demonstrate a slower switch RT  2 
Given that a substantial proportion of our sample scored below the threshold for 3 
significant misophonia ( N = 105), participants were divided into two groups based on a threshold 4 
score of 87. Switch accuracy and RT were then compared between those with lower misophonia 5 
severity (<87) and those with higher severity (>87) (significant misophonia). As shown in Figure 6 
6, we found a significant between -group difference in mean switch accuracy, with individuals 7 
classified as experiencing significant misophonia showing worse accuracy on the MAFT switch 8 
trials, with a medium effect size (t = 2.61, p = 0.01, d = 0.67).  No significant difference, however, 9 
was observed comparing the two groups’ switch RT data (t = -0.13, p = 0.90, d = -0.03 ), in line 10 
with our continuous -scale findings.  This demonstrates that the relationship between switch 11 
accuracy and misophonia is also evident dichotomously when comparing groups based on the S - 12 
Five cutoff threshold.  13

represents the 3rd quartile (Q3, 0.75). The lower end of the kernel density curve indicates the 1st percentile (Q  0.01), and the upper 8 
end represents the 99th percentile (Q  0.99). The bottom of the long bar illustrates the standard deviation, while the black horizontal 9 
line indicates the mean. The top asterisk denotes statistical significance between the groups. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and ***p < 10

S-Five total and all its subscales are associated with decrease in cognitive flexibility 12 
score on DFlex  13 
To further explore whether impaired  mental flexibility potentially extends  beyond the 14 
behavioural task and can be extrapolated to broader  contexts , we tested the replicability of 15 
Simner et al., ( 2021).  As shown in Figure  4, Pearson correlation analysis established a significant 16 
moderate relationship between S -Five score (total and all 5 factors) and DFlex flexibility subscale 17 
score. Regression models confirmed the significance of cognitive inflexibility score as predictor of 18 
S-Five total: β = 0. 26, t = 3. 44, p < 0.001, externalizing: β = 0.38, t = 4. 42, p < 0.001, impact: β =  19 
0.19, t =  2.27, p = 0.02; threat: β = 0. 15, t = 2. 00, p < 0.05; outburst: β = 0.21, t = 2.53, p = 0.01). 20 
Controlling for gender, SSSQ, and SAD -T as covariates, however, DFlex score did not account for 21 
significant variance on the internalizing domain of the S -Five ( β = 0. 16, t = 1. 78, p = 0.08). In light 22 
of these observations, we conducted additional analyses to explore the emergence of this pattern 23 
further. The model was re -run after excluding SAD -T, revealing a noteworthy, albeit marginal, 24 
association between D Flex scores and internalization  (β = 0.178, t = 2.069, p = 0.0 4). Integrating 25

 19 these results , our findings  indicate that misophonia is significantly associated with self -reported 1 
cognitive inflexibility on a continuous scale. These outcomes not only corroborate but also expand 2 
upon the findings  of (Simner et al., 2021) . Furthermore, it appears that the relationship between 3 
cognitive inflexibility and the internalization factor is predominantly accounted for by the co - 4 
occurrence of anxiety and depression, highlighting a potential mediating role for these affective 5 
states . Although this result holds considerable importance, it is noteworthy that staggering 6 
evidence show that depression and anxiety are primarily internalizing disorder s which help to  7 
explain this connection (Doering et al., 2022; Kovacs & Devlin, 1998; Priest & Cobb, 2020; Tandon 8 
et al., 2009)  (Figure 7). 9 
Switch accuracy or switch RT of MAFT are not associated with score on DFlex  10 
Our findings indicated no significant correlation  between affective flexibility (MAFT) and 11 
self-reported cognitive flexibility (switch accuracy: r = 0.0 2, p = 0.7 9; switch RT: r = 0.0 7, p = 0.4 3). 12 
These results suggest that while misophonia is linked to cognitive inflexibility, the observed 13 
relationships are likely independent of the mechanisms captured by switch accuracy -based 14 
measures of affective flexibility in the MAFT paradigm. These findings highlight the notion that 15 
task-based and questionnaire -based measures may overlap conceptually but likely represent 16 
distinct psychological constructs.  17

Misophonia links  to flexibility and rumination    
 
   
 20 
Self-reported rumination  is associated with total score of S -Five, and effects 1 
persist when controlling for  gender, SAD-T and SSSQ  2 
 As shown by Figure  4, Pearson correlation analyses revealed  moderate  positive 3 
association s between all three forms of rumination and misophonia severity  (including all S -Five 4 
subscales) . We then used regression models  to explore the relationship between three forms of 5 
rumination , perseverative thinking (PTQ) , brooding (RRS -B), anger rumination  (ARS) , and 6 
misophonia severity  while accounting for the influence of potential confounding variables: 7 
anxiety and depression, gender, and comorbid hyperacusis . 8 
Using a separate regression equation for each rumination questionnaire (three total , 9 
shown in Figure 8 ), each subtype of rumination remained significant predictor of misophonia 10 
severity (measured by S -Five total) when controlling for SAD-T score , gender, and SSSQ score  11 
(PTQ : β = 0.36, t = 4.05, p < 0.001; ARS :  β = 0.33, t =4.37,   p < 0.001; RRS-B: β= 0.36 , t = 4.65, p < 12 
0.001), and also when excluding participants who reached outlier scores on the S -Five (PTQ: β = 13 
0.35, t = 3.92 , p < 0.001; ARS: β = 0.43, t = 4.30, p < 0.001;  RRS-B: β = 0.32, t = 4.04 , p < 0.001) or 14 
the one ARS outlier ( β = 0.48, t = 4.81, p < 0.001).  15 
In more details, perseverative thinking was associated with externalization (β = 0.42, t = 16 
3.81, p < 0.001 ), internalization  (β = 0.30, t = 3.55, p < 0.001 ), impact  ( β = 0.23, t = 2.79, p = 0.006 ), 17 
threat  (β = 0.33, t = 3.54, p < 0.001 ), and outburst  (β = 0.14, t = 1.76, p = 0.08 ). We observed 18 
similar pattern for brooding  and exter nalization ( β = 1.0 2, t = 2.77, p = 0.006 ); internalization  (β = 19 
1.29, t = 4.98, p < 0.001 ), impact ( β = 1.099, t = 4.32, p < 0.001 ); threat  (β = 1.002, t = 3.31, p = 20 
0.001 ); and outburst ( β = 0.94, t = 3.75, p < 0.001 ). Interestingly , the same pattern continues in 21 
anger rumination with externalization  (β = 0.43, t = 4.33, p <001 ) ; internalization  (β = 0.31, t = 22 
4.15, p < 0.001 ); impact  (β = 0.25, t = 3.4 1, p <0.001 ); threat  (β = 0.26, t = 3.13, p <0.001 ); and 23 
outburst  (β = 0.17, t = 2.35, p = 0.0 2) (Figure 8 ). 24 
These results show that rumination, not limited to one subtype, is positively associated 25 
with misophonia severity  and all five dimensions of misophonia . Although both rumination and 26 
misophonia are associated with anxiety,  depression and hyperacusis (Figure 4) , these findings 27 
imply that rumination explains variance in misophonia over and above the variance explained by 28 
anxiety/depression, hyperacusis and gender.  29

and its subscales : 1) externalization, 2) internalization,  3) impact , 4) threat, and 5) outburst  with  A.1 to A.5 ) perseverative thinking  2 
(PT), B.1 to B.5 ) rumination , and C.1 to C.5 ) anger rumination  (AR) . The circles represent individual data points, while the diagonal 3 
black lines indicate the line of best fit.   4 
Self-reported rumination is unrelated to MAFT switch accuracy or switch RT, but 5 
linked to DFlex  6 
As shown in Figure 4 , Pearson correlation analysis established no significant relationship 7 
between switch accuracy any of the three rumination subscales : ARS: r = -0.11 , p = 0.20 ; PTQ: r = 8 
-0.07 , p = 0.40 ; RRS -B: r = -0.02 , p = 0.83 . The same was true for switch RT , which also showed no 9 
significant relationship with the rumination questionnaires based on correlation  analyses: PTQ: r 10 
= 0.06 , p = 0.48 ; RRS -B: r = 0.04 , p = 0.67 ; ARS r = 0.16 , p = 0.06 .  11 
However, the correlation analyses  yielded significant relationships between DFlex score 12 
and all three forms of rumination  and this was confirmed with  regression analyses  (ARS: β = 0.42, 13 
t = 5.57, p < 0.001; PTQ: β = 0.39, t = 6.04, p < 0.001; and RRS -B: β = 0.35, t = 4.72, p < 0.001) , 14 
when controlling for the confounding factors.  The observed relationship between cognitive 15 
flexibility and rumination, despite the MAFT indices showing no significant association with 16 
rumination, points to the notion that cognitive and affective flexibility, while closely 17 
interconnected, may represent distinct constructs (Figure 9) . 18

Figure 9. The scatterplots show  the bivariate relationships between DFlex, representative of cognitive flexibility and A) 30 
perseverative thinking,  B) brooding , and  C) anger rumination. The circles represent individual data points, while the diagonal red 31 
lines indicate the line of best fit.  32 
Since significant associations were observed between the S -Five total score and all three 33 
types of rumination (perseverative thinking, brooding, and anger rumination) alongside cognitive 34 
flexibility, it is reasonable to argue that the interplay between rumination and cognitive flexibility 35 
may better explain the variations in S -Five total. To explore this interaction, separate regression 36 
models  were applied  with PTQ, RRS -B, ARS  and DFlex  as independent , and S -Five total as the 37 
dependant  variable s, while controlling for depression , anxiety  and hyperacusis .  38 
The analyses revealed nuanced interaction effects across the models. In Model 1 ( R2 = 39 
0.298, p < 0.001), DFlex emerged as a negative moderator of the relationship between PTQ and 40 
misophonia severity, as evidenced by the interaction term coefficient ( b = -0.022 ). This finding 41 
indicates that greater cognitive flexibility mitigates the adverse influence of perseverative 42 
thinking on misophonia symptoms. Similarly, in Model 2 ( R2 = 0.29, p < 0.001), the interaction 43

Misophonia links  to flexibility and rumination    
 
   
 23 term coefficient ( b = -0.019) suggested that  DFlex  attenuated the effect of  RRS-B on misophonia 1 
severity. In Model 3 ( R2 = 0.2 78, p < 0.001), the interaction term coefficient ( b = -0.031) 2 
demonstrated a comparable moderating effect of  DFlex  on the relationship between  ARS and 3 
misophonia severity. These findings point to  the complex and context -dependent role of cognitive 4 
flexibility in moderating the effects of rumination on misophonia. In essence, cognitive flexibility 5 
may buffer the detrimental impact of certain types of rumination, highlighting the need for a 6 
nuanced understanding of its interaction with cognitive and emotional processes in the context 7 
of misophonia.  8 
Discussion  9 
In the current work, we extend previous research on cognitive inflexibility in mis ophonia  10 
in several ways.  First, we conjointly considered a self -report measure of broad cognitive flexibility, 11 
together with a behavioural  measure of affective flexibility.  Second, we considered how 12 
misophonia and cognitive inflexibility related to multiple forms of rumination .  Third, throughout 13 
our analyses, we considered multiple dimensions of misophonia symptoms.  Consistent with 14 
hypotheses, we  demonstrate d that affective flexibility, limited to  switch accuracy, was inversely  15 
associated with misophonia  severity and internalization , impact and outburst  factors . We also 16 
observed that cognitive inflexibility was significantly associated with  the severity of misophonia 17 
and these findings generalized across misophonia subscales , except for  internalization.  Consistent 18 
with previous work, we found that cognitive flexibility and affective flexibility were separable, 19 
with no significant correlation between these indices.  Furthermore, our findings reveal ed that 20 
various types  of rumination, including perseverative thinking , brooding,  and anger -related 21 
rumination, were  associated  with misophonia severity  and cognitive inflexibility but not affective 22 
inflexibility.   23 
 Taken together, t hese findings imply  that the mechanisms of misophonia may not be 24 
specific to sound triggers. Instead, misophonia appears to involve a complex interplay of cognitive 25 
and emotional processes, which may contribute to the heightened sensitivity and exaggerated 26 
responsivity to specific auditory stimuli. That is, we observed reduced  task-switching accuracy 27 
when faced with  emotion -evoking stimuli that were unrelated to auditory  triggers , which 28 
suggests the broader cognitive affective contributors to this condition , beyond reactions 29 
specifically linked  to misophonic triggers.  Findings also highlight the potential role of maladaptive 30 
emotional regulation strategies, such as rumination, in the path ology of misophonia . Overall, our 31 
findings emphasize  the need to consider cognitive and affective processes in understanding this 32 
condition.  33 
Switching to affective stimuli: Greater challenges linked to increased misophonia 34 
symptom severity  35 
To provide evidence of affective flexibility  deficits in individuals with misophonia , we 36 
employed a  newly developed task designed to capture affective  switching . This task allowed us 37 
to explore the relationship between two performance indices , switch accuracy and switch RT , and 38 
misophonia severity.  As expected, overall misophonia severity  and affective flexibility , limited to  39

Misophonia links  to flexibility and rumination    
 
   
 24 switch accuracy , were inversely associated . RT performance was not related to misophonia, and 1 
this is consistent with early evidence that RTs on this task are not specific to affective flexibility 2 
but tend to reflect a more  general motor response rate across conditions (Allen et al., Under 3 
review) . The diminished affective flexibility may hamper the ability to effectively  switch  4 
responding  to demands  in the face of emotional stimuli . This finding is in line with previous 5 
studies which highlight the role of emotion regulation in misophonia (Bagrowska et al., 2022; 6 
Barahmand et al., 2023; Cassiello -Robbins et al., 2020; Dixon et al., 2024; Guetta et al., 2022) . 7 
Similar patterns have been revealed  in individuals with high autistic traits , overlapping 8 
with misophonia symptoms  (Ertuerk et al., 2023; Rinaldi et al., 2023) , who show greater switch 9 
costs  (worse accuracy) , suggesting potential links between cognitive inflexibility and the 10 
expression of autistic traits  (Zhou et al., 2024) . Two broad, mutually inclusive classes of 11 
explanation can be distinguished  to account for the increased switch costs observed in individuals 12 
with misophonia. The Task -Set Reconfiguration (TSR) Theory (Rogers & Monsell, 1995)  posits that 13 
switch costs arise from the cognitive effort required to reconfigure a new task set during switch 14 
trials, a process reliant on endogenous, top -down control mechanisms  (Zhou et al., 2024) . 15 
Evidence suggests that cognitive control, a mechanism that facilitates task reconfiguration, is 16 
impaired in individuals with misophonia when confronted with trigger sounds that are necessary 17 
for reconfiguring the task (Daniels et al., 2020) . In addition, effective cognitive control is crucial  18 
for deploying response inhibition when needed, such as restraining automatic but contextually 19 
inappropriate behaviours , like anger outbursts in response to trigger sounds. Altered response 20 
inhibition related to misophonia also has been observed using the stop -signal task, revealing a 21 
bias toward longer stop -signal delays (Eijsker et al., 2019) . According to this framework, the larger 22 
emotion switch costs observed individuals with misophonia  may reflect difficulties in 23 
reconfiguring the emotional task set.  24 
Alternatively, the Task -Set Inertia (TSI) Theory (Allport & Wylie, 1999; Meiran, 2008; 25 
Waszak et al., 2003; Wylie & Allport, 2000)  asserts that switch costs arise from interference 26 
caused by residual activation of previous task sets. From this perspective, the larger emotion 27 
switch costs in misophonic individuals  may indicate greater susceptibility to interference from 28 
prior task sets when transitioning to an emotional task.  Both task -set inertia and task -set 29 
reconfiguration are thought to jointly contribute to the increased emotion switch costs  30 
(Vandierendonck et al., 2010) . 31 
The reduced affective flexibility in misophonia can also be better understood by  the neural 32 
correlates of misophonia. Inhibition is essential for set -switching  within  affective flexibility , 33 
facilitating the shift between behaviour, emotion or cognitive  process or task sets by suppressing 34 
competing or irrelevant ones and minimizing interference during the transition  (Arbuthnott & 35 
Frank, 2000) . Elevated orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activity has been documented  during successful, 36 
as opposed to failed, behavioural  inhibition, highlighting its role in regulatory control processes  37 
(Deng et al., 2017) . In individuals with misophonia, the OFC exhibits hyperactivation specifically 38 
in response to trigger stimuli. This heightened activity suggests the critical role of OFC in 39 
facilitating functional synchronization among brain regions, potentially influencing the 40 
misophonic ‘response’ as reflected in behavioural  task performance (Cerliani & Rouw, 2020) .  41

Misophonia links  to flexibility and rumination    
 
   
 25 Heightened misophonia severity links to reduced cognitive flexibility  1 
Confirming our behavioural  findings and replicating the results of (Simner et al., 2021) , 2 
individuals with more severe misophonia showed  reduced cognitive flexibility. These findings 3 
impl y a broader contextual rigidity in misophonia, extending beyond specific behavioural  4 
responses.  Such rigidity has been observed in other overlapping psychiatric and 5 
neurodevelopmental disorder s (Geurts et al., 2009; Gruner & Pittenger, 2017; Miles et al., 2020; 6 
Murphy et al., 2012)  with high co-morbidity with misophonia (Erfanian et al., 2019; Erfanian & 7 
Rouw, 2018; Jager et al., 2020; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018) .  8 
Cognitive inflexibility in misophonia may account for heightened sensitivity to norm 9 
violations in uncontrollable conditions  (Banker et al., 2022) , reflecting a diminished ability to 10 
adapt to environmental deviations or unpredictability  (Miyake et al., 2000)  and to flexibly adjust 11 
cognitive strategies to manage change (Han et al., 2012) . Similar to individuals with autism, those 12 
with  cognitive inflexibility often resist change and struggle to shift their mental frameworks or 13 
expectations, leading to a rigid adherence to established norms (Lacroix et al., 2024) . 14 
Consequently, when faced with uncontrollable situations that deviate from these norms, their 15 
difficulty in adapting results in heightened sensitivity and an amplified reaction to perceived 16 
violations (Norena, 2024) . This rigidity intensifies discomfort and limits their ability to 17 
contextualize or tolerate variability  18 
Although mental rigidity, attributed to misophonia, is likely a key explanation for the 19 
tendency to over -attend or hyperfocus in response to misophonic triggers (Edelstein et al., 2013; 20 
Jager et al., 2020; Simner et al., 2021) , it may also represent an underlying pathological 21 
mechanism that contributes to broader perceptual and behavioural  deficits.  To advance the field  22 
and explore whether the behavioural  symptoms are underpinned by the rigidity or rigidity should 23 
be considered per se  as a symptom , experimental measures must evolve to reflect mechanistic 24 
models of flexibility deficits.   25 
The severity of misophonia is linked to elevated rumination tendencies  26 
Building on the robust evidence linking cognitive flexibility and rumination across various 27 
psychopathological conditions, we delved into the potential association of misophonia with three  28 
forms of rumination (Altan -Atalay et al., 2022; Davis & Nolen -Hoeksema, 2000; Genet et al., 2013; 29 
Lei et al., 2022; Miles et al., 2023; Owens & Derakshan, 2013) . All three forms of rumination were 30 
moderately associated with misophonia severity,  and t hese relationships remained significant 31 
even after controlling for depression, anxiety and hyperacusis . This finding  impl ies that the 32 
relationship between rumination and misophonia severity  cannot be explained by the presence 33 
of these comorbid symptoms. Although  rumination is a hallmark feature of depressive and 34 
anxiety disorders  (Ruscio et al., 2015) , both of which frequently co -occur with misophonia  35 
(Erfanian et al., 2018; Erfanian et al., 2019; Erfanian & Rouw, 2018; Jager et al., 2020; Rosenthal 36 
et al., 2022; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018) , our findings emphasize  the unique connection  between 37 
rumination and misophonia severity .  38 
Anecdotal reports, consistent with our findings, indicate that individuals with misophonia 39 
employ internal coping strategies. These strategies involve cognitive processing of trigger 40 
characteristics, anger rumination, and contemplation of emotional responses associated with 41 
misophonia, aimed at avoiding or escaping triggers (Dozier & Mitchell, 2023) . 42

Misophonia links  to flexibility and rumination    
 
   
 26 Yet, these findings should be interpreted in the context of cognitive flexibility, especially 1 
given its association with all forms of rumination within this cohort . First , the in ability to mentally 2 
switch between cognitive sets may lead to  perseveration  (Altan -Atalay et al., 2022; Beckwé et al., 3 
2014; Nolen -Hoeksema, 2000; Watkins & Brown, 2002) . Second, s imilar to  mood disorders, the 4 
ruminati ve tendencies  observed in misophonia could  reflect disturbances in cognitive switching 5 
processes  (Piguet et al., 2010) , leading to maladaptive emotion regulation strategies that are less 6 
effective in the moment  (Barahmand et al., 2023; Cassiello -Robbins et al., 2020; Dixon et al., 2024; 7 
Erfanian et al., 2018; Guetta et al., 2022; Rinaldi et al., 2023; Spencer et al., 2023) .  8 
It is important to note that we were not able to disentangle the conjoint effects  of 9 
cognitive flexibility vs. rumination  in relation to misophonia.  All forms of  rumination  and 10 
cognitive inflexibility overlap in their relationship with  misophonia . Previous research supports 11 
the bidirectional effects of cognitive flexibility and rumination (De Lissnyder et al., 2012) . For 12 
instance, i n the context of AN, which shows  high comorbidity with misophonia , evidence suggests 13 
that eating disorder -specific rumination acts as a mediator between subjective cognitive 14 
flexibility and eating disorder symptoms  (Miles et al., 2023) .  15 
All in all, as we measured  multiple forms of ruminatio n and focused on general tendencies 16 
of responding to distress rather than misophonia -specific  experiences , our findings demonstrate  17 
that a tendency toward perseverative thought in misophonia extends beyond trigger -related 18 
situation s. Fortunately, perseverative thought such as rumination can be targeted in treatment  19 
through therap y modalities  such as CBT   (Querstret & Cropley, 2013) , which ha s shown promise 20 
in managing misophonia symptoms  (I. J. Jager et al., 2020) . 21 
Conclusion  22 
This study provides novel evidence  that the severity of misophonia is related to affective 23 
inflexibility , cognitive inflexibility, and perseverate  thinking. Affective inflexibility  was distinct to 24 
cognitive inflexibility and perseverative  thinking, as no significant association was observed with 25 
measures of these constructs . These findings provide insights into the rich set of affective  and 26 
cognitive dimensions involved in misophonia .  The profile of affective and cognitive difficulties 27 
observed  here are well -documented as transdiagnostic risk variables, consistent with the 28 
diagnostic overlap of misophonia with conditions such as ASD and OCD. By delineating these 29 
characteristics, the study contributes to reducing the risk of misdiagnosis and enhances our 30 
understanding of thee cognitive and affective processes involved in misophonia.  Importantly, 31 
this research offers practical implications for clinical practice, encouraging a more targeted 32 
approach to treatment protocols that emphasise addressing the cognitive aspects of misophonia.  33
