Abstract
Most theoretical and empirical discussions about the nature of consciousness are typically couched in a way that endorses a tacit adult-
centric and vision-based perspective. This paper defends the idea that consciousness science may be put on a fruitful track for its next
phase by examining the nature of subjective experiences through a bottom-up developmental lens. We draw attention to the intrinsic
link between consciousness, experiences and experiencing subjects, which are first and foremost embodied and situated organisms
essentially concerned with self-preservation within a precarious environment. Our paper suggests that in order to understand what
consciousness ‘is’, one should first tackle the fundamental question: how do embodied experiences ‘arise’ from square one? We then
highlight one key yet overlooked aspect of human consciousness studies, namely that the earliest and closest environment of an
embodied experiencing subject is the body of another human experiencing subject. We present evidence speaking in favour of fairly
sophisticated forms of early sensorimotor integration of bodily signals and self-generated actions already being established in utero . We
conclude that these primitive and fundamentally relational and co-embodied roots of our early experiences may have a crucial impact
on the way human beings consciously experience the self, body and the world across their lifespan.

Introduction
In the past decades, significant theoretical and empirical
efforts from philosophy , neuroscience, psychology , psychiatry
and the computational sciences have worked to unravel the
psychological and neurobiological nature of human conscious-
ness. The so-called ‘hard problem’ ( Chalmers 1995 )—how and why
do certain physical structures and functions of the brain and body
relate and give rise to conscious subjective experiences ( Nagel
1974 ;Block 2008 )—continues to fuel current debates. Most the-
orists address this question by exploring the relationship between
‘conscious experiences’ and the ‘brain’ ( Dennett 1992 ;Dehaene
2014 ), in the search for neural correlates of consciousness. An
exhaustive discussion of these theories and their metaphysical
assumptions would lead to a substantial digression and cannot be
addressed here in detail. (See Table 1 for an overview of the most
recent and seminal accounts and ( Safron 2020a ,b) for a recent
discussion.)In this paper, we propose to zoom out from the classical
conundrum of the relationship between consciousness and its
neural correlates. Instead, we go back to ‘square one’ in order to
examine the nature of experiences as they arise in early human
life, in utero . The underlying assumption is that by endorsing a
bottom-up and developmental perspective in exploring how con-
scious experiences dynamically arise and develop in concert with
the developing organism, we may reveal important insights into
what consciousness ‘is’ and its basic organic structure ( Lyon et al.
2021 ).
We build upon the idea that consciousness is intrinsically
linked to ‘experiences’. Experiences are particular spatiotemporal
events that consist in the instantiation of experiential properties
by experiencing subjects (i.e. particular spatiotemporal individ-
uals) ( Nida-R ¨umelin 2017 ). This means that experiences do not
occur in a vacuum, but they are intrinsically linked to an experi-
encing subject or to ‘someone’ as their ontological ‘bearer’ ( Sartre

1943 ;Zahavi 2005 ;Legrand 2006 ;Ciaunica 2016 ,2017 ). As Nida-
R¨umelin points out: ‘we cannot even think the occurrence of an
experience without thereby thinking it as involving an experi-
encing subject’ ( 2017 , 56). Hence, the notion of an experiencing
subject is conceptually prior to the notion of an experience, and
the notion of an experience is conceptually prior to the notion of
consciousness.
If this is so, then before any attempt to understand con-
sciousness, we must address the nature of ‘experiencing subjects’.
As we will see shortly , this emphasis is far from being trivial.
This is because, as it happens, this ‘someone’, or the ‘bearer’
of experiences is not an abstract entity floating in an abstract
space. Rather, humans—the experiencing subjects at stake here—
are ‘embodied’ living organisms actively engaging with a wider
physical and social environment in order to secure survival, self-
preservation and potential reproduction ( Gibson 1977 ;Varela et al.
1991 ;Aitken and Trevarthen 1997 ;Gallagher 2000 ;de Jaegher and
Di Paolo 2007 ;Thompson 2007 ). Indeed, recent years have seen
an ‘embodied turn’ in addressing the nature of conscious expe-
riences. There is a growing consensus in philosophy , psychology
and cognitive neuroscience that multisensory and sensorimotor
information about the ‘body’ plays a central role in structuring
our basic sense of self and subjective conscious experiences (Reed
1996; Gallagher 2000 ;Blanke and Metzinger 2009 ;Trevarthen and
Delafield-Butt 2017 ;Trevarthen et al. 2006 ).
However, as we will see shortly , if we understand con-
sciousness as necessarily related to experiences and from there
to embodied experiencers (i.e. human embodied individuals
actively engaging with an environment in order to maintain self-
preservation), then it becomes clear that consciousness cannot
be addressed in isolation from ‘bodily self-consciousness’. Recent
work in mind and brain research stipulates that our percep-
tions, cognitions and actions are fundamentally geared towards
self-preservation,1i.e. the need to maintain and regulate the psy-
chological and physiological needs for the integrity of the living
organism (the human body or individual) within a wider and
highly volatile social and physical environment ( Varela et al. 1991 ;
Northoff and Panksepp 2008 ;Clark 2013 ;Hohwy 2013 ;Ciaunica
2019 ;Limanowski and Friston 2018 ;Seth and Tsakiris 2018 ;Seth
2021 ). In order to fulfil the fundamental conditions for self-
preservation, humans need to constantly move, act and interact
with the physical and social environment. Multisensory integra-
tion of sensory signals arising from both inside and outside our
bodies is fundamental to building a cohesive model of our body ,
self and the world ( Park and Blanke 2019 ). It scaffolds not only our
subjective experience of being present, in the here and now, but
most importantly , it ensures successful navigation in a complex
and ever-changing physical and social world.
Now, one way the human organism may complete this task
is described by the influential ‘Predictive Processing’ framework
(Friston 2010 ;Clark 2013 ;Hohwy 2013 ). This theory proposes that
the brain maintains conditions for self-preservation by extracting
patterns of information from its embodied, worldly interactions
in order to generate self- and world models of the environment
(Conant and Ashby 1970 ). These models form the basis of the
so-called ‘expectations’ of the agent about the causal structure
of its internal and external worlds ( Rao and Ballard 1999 ). The
human brain actively predicts or anticipates causes of incoming
1Note that this is not to say that agents are limited to perceiving
events/objects that are directly related to their survival. Rather, it is to say
that perception functions first and foremost a manner of contributing to
self-maintenance. We are grateful to one anonymous reviewer for pressing
clarification on this point.sensory inputs via Bayesian ‘prior’ beliefs,2allowing the modelling
of possible ‘hidden’ causes of the sensory information.
If this is so, then two key observations arise for consciousness
studies. First, in order to understand the nature of conscious expe-
rience in the here and now of adult life, it is essential to look
at how these experiences get off the ground from the outset, in
early life. This is because adult conscious experiences cannot be
addressed in isolation of prior (early life) perceptual experiences.
Regardless of when various forms of consciousness first emerge,
there is an experiential continuum between early and later
experiences.
Second, if consciousness cannot be addressed in isolation from
experiences, then the latter cannot be isolated from experienc-
ing subjects, which in turn cannot be isolated from their bod-
ies and their closest environment. Or the most primitive and
closest ‘environment’ of the developing human body is another
human body . Hence, the most basic perceptual experiences—
the ‘first priors’ ( Ciaunica et al . 2021b )—may arise already in
the womb, that is, when humans share bodily and organismic
resources with another human being. Indeed, one essential yet
overlooked aspect of current discussions on consciousness is that
experiencing subjects first develop ‘within’ another human body .
These primitive and fundamentally relational co-embodied roots
of our experiences may have crucial impacts on the way human
beings start consciously experiencing the self, body and the
world.
We unpack these ideas below as follows. In second section,
we start with the observation that consciousness studies typi-
cally endorse an adult-centric, vision-biased perspective. Cash-
ing out conscious perception in terms of visual processing may
be misleading because it overlooks the fundamental multisen-
sory , relational and dynamic nature of our perceptual experi-
ences from the outset, in early life. We suggest that we need a
more dynamic and inclusive approach in order to include sub-
jective experiences that are potentially felt, experienced, and yet
unreported and/or verbally unreportable. We then introduce the
phenomenological notion of pre-reflective self-consciousness that
lies at the core of all our conscious experiences and outline its
embodied sensorimotor roots. Third section looks at evidence
pointing to the sensorimotor roots of embodied experiences in
utero . Indeed, while it is widely acknowledged that the integra-
tion of ‘bodily sensory’ inputs is fundamental for human per-
ceptual experiences, less attention has been paid to the idea
that human bodies necessarily emerge within another human
body (co-embodiment). We describe how the preconditions for
pre-reflective self-consciousness are established in utero in terms
of basic forms of self-awareness. Fourth section builds upon
the robust evidence speaking in favour of self- and environ-
ment exploratory movements and actions in foetuses in order to
argue that the latter may be regarded as experiencing subjects
in a basic sense, i.e. they perceive and explore themselves, the
world and their relation to the world via repeated trials, learn-
ing and observation, mainly through proximal senses such touch
and olfaction. We suggest that these embodied experiences—
regardless of whether they are or are not associated with phe-
nomenal consciousness—come first and constitute the roots of all
conscious experiences, even though we do not explicitly or ver-
bally recollect them as adults, nor we always pay attention to
them later in life.

Consciousness is not all about seeing a ripe
tomato (and reporting it)
Consciousness studies typically endorse an adult-centric, vision-
biased perspective in both theoretical and experimental frame-
works, predicated mostly on verbal reports ( Faivre et al. 2017 ). As
Graziano notes, many scientists who study consciousness focus
on ‘a microcosmic problem: a person looking at a small round spot
on a screen’ ( Graziano 2018 ) and subjectively reporting that visual
conscious perception. Being able to report a given perception
counts as an indicator of the fact that that perception is conscious.
For example, two key features of conscious sensory states, namely
‘qualitative character’ and ‘subjectivity’ ( Nagel 1974 ;Kriegel 2009 ),
are usually and famously exemplified with the case of ‘seeing a
ripe tomato’ ( Jackson 1986 ;Levine 2006 ).
This bias runs deep in current consciousness studies, char-
acterizing even the distinction between conscious versus uncon-
scious perception. For example, subliminal perception is ‘inferred
when a stimulus is demonstrated to be invisible while still influenc-
ing thoughts, feelings, actions, learning or memory’ ( Kouider and
Dehaene 2007, 857, our italics ). It is ‘primarily via the demonstra-
tion of semantic activation from invisible stimuli that researchers
tried to define the limits of non-conscious perception’ ( Kouider
and Dehaene 2007, 858, our italics ) (see also Marcel 1974). There
is some early work tackling tactile detection and auditory modal-
ity ( Stroh et al . 1908 ). However, vision-based studies became the
predominant research paradigm of conscious perception in the
past century (but see Arzi et al. 2020 for a recent experimental
approach; see Barwitch 2020 ;Millar 2021 on recent theoretical
accounts of olfactory perception).
This tacit bias can be straightforwardly accounted for in terms
of the facility of the experimental designs and reportability . After
all, it is easier to ask adult participants ‘what it is like’ to
see a ripe tomato or whether they have spotted a word on a
screen. It is less evident to ask infants whether there is some-
thing ‘what it is like’ for them to listen a lullaby or to detect
a tactile experience on their skin, because infants do not yet
have language with which to report their experiences. But can
we safely infer from lack of potential reportability abilities to
lack of conscious awareness? Here, we suggest that we need a
more inclusive approach in order to include under the umbrella
of consciousness science those subjective experiences that are
potentially felt, experienced, and yet unreported and/or verbally
unreportable.
The focus on visual conscious perception may be seen as an
intellectual inheritance from the historical development of phi-
losophy and neuropsychology that approached vision as the most
accessible, ‘lowest hanging fruit’ in the dissection of subjective
experience and its neural underpinning. However, as we will
examine throughout this paper, our daily experiences involve
more proximal and rich multisensory inputs such as tactile, pro-
prioceptive, visceral, as well as olfactory and auditory signals ( Noë
2004 ;Faivre et al . 2017 ;Ciaunica 2017 ;Barwitch 2020 ). All these
multisensory dynamic perceptions are blended to form an ‘invis-
ible’ or ‘transparent’ experiential background that consciousness
studies typically take for granted ( Ciaunica et al. 2021 ).
This idea has been long advocated by theorists from the phe-
nomenological tradition ( Sartre 1943 ;Merleau-Ponty 1945/1962 )
and more recently by Zahavi (2005) ;Fuchs (2005) ;Legrand (2006) ;
Nida-R ¨umelin (2017) ;Ciaunica (2016) ;Ciaunica (2017) . According
to these theorists, the awareness involved in ‘my’ experiences is
not an awareness of it as an ‘object’, in the sense that I cannot
endorse the perspective of an external observer or spectator onit.3Rather, any experience directed towards an object in the
world (e.g. seeing a ripe tomato or my face in a mirror) implies
a ‘pre-reflective self-consciousness’ that makes my experiences
immediately and tacitly given as mine ( Zahavi 2005 ).
As Sartre famously put the point, this fundamental form of
pre-reflective self-consciousness should not be regarded as an
extra layer added to the on-going experience. Rather, it essen-
tially constitutes the very mode of being of ‘any’ conscious expe-
rience: ‘This self-consciousness we ought to consider not as a
new consciousness, but as the only mode of existence which
is possible for a consciousness of something’ ( Sartre 1943 , 20
[1956, liv]). In Sartre’s view, necessarily , any conscious experi-
ence is a pre-reflective self-conscious experience ( Legrand 2006) :
‘a consciousness has no need at all of a reflecting [higher-order]
consciousness in order to be conscious of itself. It simply does
not posit itself as an object ’ (Sartre 1936 , 29 [1957, 45], our italics).
Pre-reflective self-consciousness is intrinsically a non-objectifying
form of self-awareness. This form of self-awareness is thought
to pervade and constitute every conscious experience without
requiring introspection or reflection ( Zahavi 2005 ).
Importantly for our discussion here, those theorists4claiming
that one attains self-consciousness only if one has the ability to
use the first-person pronoun ‘I’ to refer to oneself are also com-
mitted to the idea that infants are not conscious beings capable of
exhibiting pre-reflective self-awareness ( Carruthers 1996 ). By con-
trast, those theorists who claim that pre-reflective consciousness
is an intrinsic feature of our primary experiences and does not
stand in a transitive relation to the state of which it is aware allow
for infants to be self-aware in this basic sense ( Rochat and Striano
2000 ;Ciaunica 2016 ).
Interestingly , the phenomenological view—according to which
every experience has necessarily and tacitly an experience of bod-
ily selfhood underwriting it ( Merleau-Ponty 1945/1962 )—echoes
recent influential work in mind and brain research stipulating
that self-preservation, i.e. the maintenance of one’s vital integrity ,
is at the core of all perceptual events ( Northoff and Panksepp
2008 ;Ciaunica 2017 ;Rudrauf et al. 2017 ;Seth and Tsakiris
2018 ;Limanowski and Friston 2020 ). In this view, the self is
not only embodied, but also perceptual experiences are impera-
tively driven by basic constraints of physiological regulation that
subserve self-preservation of the embodied human individual.5
Whenever we perceive something, self-related interests (infor-
mation relevant to self-preservation) necessarily guide both our
perception and actions ( Ciaunica and Crucianelli 2019 ).
In what follows, we propose that examining the nature of our
basic pre-reflective embodied experiences may help us shed light
on the nature of conscious experiences tout court . Specifically ,
we suggest that the preconditions for basic and embodied forms
3This is not to deny the existence and importance of the fact that I can
endorse a third-person objectifying view on myself and take myself as an object
of experience (e.g. self-introspection or self-recognition). Rather, it is just that
this observational stance should be regarded as emerging late in phylogeny and
ontogeny , being dependent on a more primary form of self-consciousness. For
example, for some authors, the child’s ability to recognize herself in the mirror
via the famous rouge test ( Lewis and Ramsey 2004 ), i.e.∼18 months of age, con-
stitutes the hallmark of self-consciousness. This point however is controversial
(see Rochat and Striano 2000 ;Ciaunica 2016 ).
4For example, some theorists account for the intransitive use of the term
‘conscious’ by means of some kind of higher-order theory ( Carruthers 1996 ). For
these authors, the presence/absence of a relevant meta-mental state was sup-
posed to serve as a criterion in distinguishing conscious/unconscious mental
states.

of pre-reflective self-consciousness are already becoming estab-
lished in utero . That is, prenatal organisms possess a basic form
of self-awareness ( Ciaunica 2016 ), which constitutes the funda-
mental basis or roots for all conscious experiences. As we will
see shortly , there is growing empirical evidence suggesting that
the most basic experiences are already present in utero (Zoia
et al. 2007 ;Castiello et al. 2010 ;Piontelli 2010 ;Delafield-Butt
and Gangopadhyay 2013 ;Ciaunica 2017 ;Ciaunica and Crucianelli
2019 ;Quintero and de Jaegher 2020 ;Ciaunica et al. 2021 ).
A metaphorical way of putting the point is to say that in order
to understand the nature of a tree, it is not enough to mea-
sure its observable ‘reflective’ branches. Rather, one must also
take into account its less accessible, implicit ‘pre-reflective’ roots,
which are, as we will see shortly , fundamental to understand
how humans consciously experience themselves, their bodies and
their relation to the environment. This is because perceptual expe-
riences develop and unfold gradually on a continuum, spanning
from pre-reflective bodily forms towards more sophisticated and
reflective forms. The latter are grounded on the former, the same
way the directly perceivable branches of a tree both spring forth
from, and are also supported by its underground roots. Attention
only to the visible branches may produce a superficial account;
yet, the tree has deep roots fundamental to its entire form and
function. In the next section, we present evidence describing
how the preconditions for pre-reflective self-consciousness are
established in utero in terms of basic forms of self-awareness.
The sensorimotor roots of embodied
experiences in utero
A significant body of work in philosophy , psychology and neu-
roscience proposed that at the heart of human perceptual expe-
rience of all kinds lies the integration of ‘bodily sensory’ inputs
(Varela et al. 1991 ;Gallagher 2000 ;Legrand 2006 ;Seth et al. 2011 ;
Apps and Tsakiris 2013 ). The embodied aspects of self-related
experiences have been extensively investigated in the literature
from various theoretical perspectives (Berlucchi and Aglioti 1997;
Damasio 2000 ; Downing et al. 2001; Critchley et al. 2004; Panksepp
2005 ;Trevarthen and Delafield-Butt 2017 ; Allen and Tsakiris 2019;
Free 2020 ;Jékely et al. 2021 ). Again, a detailed discussion of these
accounts would lead to a substantial digression.
Here, we build upon the fairly uncontroversial idea that the
multisensory integration of sensory signals must always serve the
survival and the maintenance of the body within a wider physi-
cal and social environment. Crucially , to achieve this vital goal,
the organism needs to remain active. Rather, it needs to actively
coordinate the movements of its skeletomusculature to achieve
in action the goals that sustain its vitality . All animals share this
common foundation of sensory-motor integrative activity , medi-
ated by a highly evolved cell system to serve this purpose rapidly ,
and with efficient effect—the nervous system ( Sherrington 1947 ).
It has been proposed that a potentially reliable marker of an
organism’s emergence of perceptual experiences is the identifica-
tion of anticipatory , goal-directed sensory-motor actions ( Merker
2005 ;Panksepp 2011 ). The development of prospective, antic-
ipatory awareness in motor control emerges at the beginning
of foetal life at the end of the first and beginning of the sec-
ond trimester ( Delafield-Butt and Gangopadhyay 2013 ). This is an
emerging hub of endogenously generated actions with outcomes
contingent on proprioceptive, tactile and distance receptors to
sense the effect of one’s own self-generated action on the exter-
nal or intra-personal world. In human development, the first signs
of the self-generated actions are at exactly 7 weeks and 2 daysof gestational age ( L¨uchinger et al. 2008 ). This is a composition
of whole-body , writhing worm-like movements with a patterned
oscillatory cascade that travels limbs and trunk as one integrated
system. These very first movements lack the discrete, isolate
control of a part of the body (an arm, a finger) commonly asso-
ciated with voluntary , intentional control. Rather, they reflect a
whole-organismic motility within uterine fluid dynamics and the
gelatinous structure of a late-stage embryo. The latter has limited
affordances for action. At this point the nervous system is very
immature. Indeed, cervical spinal cord nuclei are rapidly forming
axodendritic synapses, initially between interneurons and motor
neurons, and then between afferent fibres and interneurons. It
begins to function now as an integrated system. Moreover, the
‘special visceral nuclei’ of the brain are formed and they are
becoming innervated via integrative affective systems ( Trevarthen
1985 ).
It is not until 12–14 weeks of gestational age that the organism,
now an early-stage foetus entering its second trimester of gesta-
tion, makes isolate movements of the limbs or head, indicating
differentiated voluntary control of discreet elements of the skele-
tomusculature. Most profoundly , shortly after this point in gesta-
tion, quantified kinematic analyses reveal the foetus has acquired
a sensory knowledge of its environment and can plan movements
that expect their sensory consequences ( Castiello et al. 2010 ). For
example, it has been shown that in the case of twin pregnancies,
twin foetuses have been observed to make special twin-directed
movements that are distinct from movements towards the uterine
environment, such as the placenta wall or umbilical cord. These
movements can be differentiated by the start of their action, indi-
cating a prospective awareness of the sensory consequences of the
self-generated action from the very beginning. The authors of this
study note that the action patterns used to touch the twin were the
same as those used to touch one’s own face but distinctly differ-
ent from those used to touch the placenta, indicating a very early
‘social’ awareness of an ‘other’ agent ( Castiello et al. 2010 ). In sin-
gleton pregnancies, motor planning evident in the action pattern
of the arms is structured by its final position, or ‘goal’, by at least
22 weeks of gestational age ( Zoia et al. 2007 ).
Foetal awareness of the consequences of a self-generated
action is also evident in anticipatory movements of the hands and
fingers to a target part of the body during self-directed action.
For example, the mouth of the foetus is observed to open dur-
ing mouth-directed movements of the arm, carrying the finger
to it, but before actual contact ( Myowa-Yamakoshi and Takeshita
2006 ;Reissland et al. 2014 ). This indicates an awareness of a
self-generated future that manifests in sensory-motor movement
and anticipates its sensory consequences. Finally , at birth, the
detailed high-precision sub-second kinematic analysis demon-
strates new-born arm movements are prospectively organized,
with an anticipation of their outcome in body space ( Delafield-Butt
2007 ).
Taken together, these studies demonstrate that a cardinal sign
of anticipatory experience, goal-directed motor control, is evi-
dent from the start of the second trimester in utero and develops
in complexity and precision through foetal life as the skeleto-
musculature and neural connectivity matures ( Delafield-Butt and
Gangopadhyay 2013 ). Spinal column, brainstem and midbrain,
where connectivity to limb musculature is already established,
must be responsible for these first, cardinal signs of agentive
control ( Delafield-Butt 2007 ;Delafield-Butt and Gangopadhyay
2013 ). Notably , however, corticospinal projections do not reach
the cervical spinal cord until 24 weeks of gestation ( Eyre et al.
2000 ).Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2021/2/niab037/6432320 by guest on 17 July 2022

It has been argued that these phylogenetically ancient brain
structures, well-known for visceral organ regulation and sen-
sory and motor information transmission, are not simple relays
along the corticospinal tract sending sensory information from
inferior visceral and somatic receptors to superior cortical areas,
where mental operation generates motor commands for trans-
mission back through brainstem for skeletal muscle movement.
Theorists draw on clinical and comparative neurology , neuro-
science and neuropsychology findings to present a new per-
spective of brain stem function that recognizes its capacity
for these so-called higher cognitive functions and its impor-
tance as a core generator of the conditions for conscious
agency and which some have suggested may constitute physi-
cal substrates of consciousness in their own right ( Merker 2007 ;
Northoff and Panksepp 2008 ; Panksepp and Northoff 2009; Winn
2012).
However, the question whether subcortical or cortical regions
are necessary and/or sufficient conditions for constituting the
neural systems responsible for intentional control of action and
conscious experience continues to be a subject of debate. For
example, some scholars have argued for a subcortical basis for
affective consciousness ( Panksepp 2005 ;Damasio 2012 ;Solms and
Friston 2018 ), drawing on evidence from emotional expressions
in anencephalic patients and the preservation of feelings with
bilateral insula damage ( Merker 2007 ;Damasio et al. 2013 ). By con-
trast, others suggest that core affects can be described in terms of
emotions and feelings without necessarily being conscious ( Safron
2021a ,b).6In what follows we build upon the fairly uncontrover-
sial idea that the neural and sensorimotor basis necessary for the
emergence of perceptual experiences and agentive control are in
place by the second trimester of gestation. In the remainder of this
paper, we motivate the claim that these early perceptual experi-
ences and signs of proto-agentive control constitute the core of
what we call pre-reflective self-consciousness, which is in turn the
implicit core of all conscious experiences.
The co-embodied roots of early conscious
experiences
How do we start perceiving and experiencing ourselves and the
world and when? Is it with our first breath after birth, or before,
already in the womb, when we breathe throughout the pla-
centa? How exactly can an ensemble of biological cells expand
and transform into a human person able to consciously expe-
rience herself as distinct from the world and others? These
are fascinating questions that remain largely unexplored. The
transformation from biological cells into new human life is a
complex, precarious and captivating journey7(see Young 2005 ;
Trevarthen et al. 2006 ;Piontelli 2010 ;Ciaunica and Crucianelli
2019 ;Quintero and de Jaegher 2020 ;Ciaunica et al . 2021 for an
extensive discussion).
As we saw earlier, both phenomenological and Predictive Pro-
cessing (PP) approaches rightly point to the role of an agent’s
6This view suggests that affects might only be made conscious via re-
representation by processes capable of coherent world modelling ( Safron
2020a,b ,Safron 2021a ,b). Alternatively , it could be argued that core affects
can be described in terms of emotions and feelings without necessarily being
conscious ( Safron 2021a ). From this point of view, these affects might only be
made conscious via re-representation by processes capable of coherent world
modelling (Safron 2020; Safron 2021a ,b), likely depending on either a thalam-
ocortical system or a functionally similar homologue ( Dugas-Ford et al. 2012 ;
Shanahan 2012 ).
7The fascinating phenomenology of shared embodiment and emerging
selfhood during pregnancy has been addressed elsewhere in the literature in
more detail (Young 2005; Smith 2016; Lymer 2011 ;Ciaunica 2017 ;Ciaunica and
Crucianelli 2019 ;Quintero and de Jaegher 2020 ).prior experiences in understanding the constitutive relationship
between self-organizing systems (such as human bodies) and
their physical and social environments ( Varela et al. 1991 ;Seth
and Tsakiris 2018 ). Perception and movement are like the two
sides of the same coin ( Lee et al. 1999 ;Noë 2004 ;von Hofsten
2007 ;Lee 2009 ). Indeed, as we outlined earlier, consciousness
does not float in a vacuum but rather is rooted in experiences—
particular spatiotemporal events—which are in turn intrinsically
linked to experiencing subjects—particular spatiotemporal indi-
viduals. Experiencing subjects are not isolated and static islands.
Rather as Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1945/1962) noted, the basis of
perceptual experiences is rooted in the moving body exploring and
exchanging with the environment.
However, less attention has been paid to the idea that
human bodies necessarily emerge within another human body
(co-embodiment) ( Ciaunica et al. 2021 ). For a set time period (typi-
cally 9 months), two (or more) human organisms are bound to co-
regulate and share bodily and environmental resources in order to
survive (co-homeostasis; Ciaunica et al . 2021 ) in what Trevarthen
and colleagues call ‘amphoteronomic regulation’ ( Trevarthen et al.
2006 ).
Let us go back to square one and imagine what it might be
like to be a foetus at 10 weeks of gestational age, regardless of
whether or not such experiences entail consciousness as defined
by standard consciousness science. This is an important founda-
tional question because while the experience of being pregnant
is given to a certain category of individuals, the experience of
being a foetus is universal (Ciaunica et al . 2021). We all have
been foetuses at some point of our experiential life; hence, we all
have been impacted by the experience of co-embodiment. First,
it is important to bear in mind that contrary to the common
view of the foetus being passively ‘contained’8and solipsistically
‘trapped’ in the solitude of the womb, evidence speaks in favour
of an active and bidirectional co-regulation between the two living
bodies ( Quintero and de Jaegher 2020 ), what it has been termed
‘co-embodiment’ and ‘co-homeostasis’ (Ciaunica et al . 2021), or
‘amphoteronomic’ ( Trevarthen et al. 2006 ) that draws attention
to the mutual regulation of both maternal and foetal autonomic
physiologies.
Second, it is crucial to note that in the womb, the most devel-
oped sensory systems in foetuses are tactile and olfactory , not
visual. Sound, touch and smell are the principal modalities of
perception in early life as well as proprioceptive control of move-
ments and body posture (Witherington et al . 2002). These inputs
may provide the fundamental basis upon which all our perceptual
experiences are built later on in adult life ( Ciaunica 2017 ;Ciaunica
and Crucianelli 2019 ). Indeed, it may be the case that visual con-
sciousness fundamentally depends on non-visual modalities in
order to overcome otherwise intractable inverse problems (e.g. is
an object near and small, or distant and large) and possibly also
for realizing phenomenal binding via affordance relations ( Safron
2021a ).
Intriguingly , in the womb, foetuses spend a significant amount
of time in tactile exploration of the boundary between inner-
vated and non-innervated regions ( Piontelli 1992 ,2010 ;Mori and
Kuniyoshi 2010 ). Early foetal self-generated action reveals its
exploratory , sensation-testing nature. At the start of isolate limb
movement at 10 weeks of gestational age, some areas of the body
are innervated with sensory nerve fibres, such as the lips, cheeks,
8For example, Kingma (2019) identified two options for conceiving of the
relation between foetus and maternal body: (i) the foetus is merely contained
within the maternal body and (ii) it is a part of the maternal body .Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2021/2/niab037/6432320 by guest on 17 July 2022

ears and parietal bone, and others are not ( Piontelli 2010 ). Those
areas that are innervated are frequently touched by the hands
of the foetus, the fingers of which are themselves richly inner-
vated. Importantly , touches to sensitive innervated regions create
an autostimulatory feedback loop, with sensory signals generated
in both the effector (finger) that is moved to touch and the area
being touch (such as the lips). Touches to un-innervated regions do
not produce this simultaneous autostimulation, but they do pro-
duce the feeling of touch in the fingers and commensurate haptic
resistive forces sensed proprioceptively .
Using real-time ultrasonography , foetuses have been observed
exploring the boundary of the innervated and uninnervated
regions, particularly at the anterior fontanel of the forehead where
innervation ceases (ibid.). The nervous innervation of the fore-
head migrates during the second trimester. Consequently , the
foetus’ exploration this innervated and un-innervated body parts
migrates as well, demonstrating that the foetus is attracted to
the special relationship between differences in self-stimulatory
feed-back on either side of the boundary of innervation ( Piontelli
2010 , 61–67). The foetus is thus exploring the boundaries of his
or her self, developing knowledge of the effects of his or her own
self-generated action, and its consequences.
The foetus also displays preferential behaviour in olfactory per-
ception. Early work outlined discriminative swallowing response
to amniotic fluid after it was flavoured with sweet versus bitter
stimuli (Mistretta and Bradley 1986). Another study found that
preterm infants 2 months before the gestational term increased
their rate of respiration to engage in the pleasant odour of vanilla,
while inhibiting their breathing rate to avoid adverse odours
(Marlier et al . 2001). Moreover, the delivery of odorants or tas-
tants into the amniotic fluid (either through direct infusion or
through maternal ingestion) induced subsequent preferences for
these chemostimuli when tested between successive foetal stages
(see Schaal et al . 2000; Lipchock et al. 2011 ). These intentional
actions and demonstration of preferences to engage or disengage
provide critical evidence that proto-agentic phenomena may be
operative as early as the start of the second trimester of foetal
life.
Interestingly , this exploration echoes the common etymolog-
ical understanding of what the term ‘experience’ designates,
namely: (i) the noun ‘eks-p ˉ e’ri-ens’, through trial of, practical
acquaintance with any matter gained by trial, repeated trial, long
and varied observation, personal or general; and (ii) the verb, to
make trial of, or practical acquaintance with, to prove or know by
use, to suffer, to undergo. T ypically , experiences are regarded by
philosophers and scientists as tacitly endowed with phenomenal
character ( Nagel 1974 ;Kriegel 2009 ). This seems to suggest that
the subjects undergoing these experiences must be in a position to
at least have the ability to detect and access the phenomenal and
subjective aspects of these experiences ( Block 1997 ,2002 ). How-
ever, the question whether experiences necessarily have phenom-
enal character is debatable in philosophy (see Lee 2016 ) but leaves
open the possibility that observed experiences can be defined as
‘practical acquaintance’ or ‘exploratory observation’ of self and
world ( Delafield-Butt 2007 ).
Given the extensive evidence in favour of self- and environ-
ment exploratory movements in foetuses, one may suggest the
latter are experiencing subjects in this basic sense: they per-
ceive and explore themselves, the world and their relation to
the world via repeated trials, learning and observation, mainly
through proximal senses such as touch and olfaction. Crucially ,
these embodied experiences come first and constitute the roots ofall conscious experiences, even though we do not explicitly recol-
lect them as adults nor we always pay attention to them later in
life. Whether or not these primitive experiences have a phenom-
enal character—namely ‘there is something that it is like to be a
foetus in someone’s else body’—is beyond the scope of the present
discussion.
Even though these early experiences remain inaccessible to
explicit adult recollection, they may have a powerful impact on
the developing mind, especially if the body is found to ‘keep the
score’ ( van Der Kolk 2015 ) of our past experiences ( Piontelli 1992 ,
2002 ;Delafield-Butt and Trevarthen 2015 ;Delafield-Butt 2018 ).
Perhaps, our bodies (the pre-reflective bodily self) kept track of
these early experiences and use them as the fundamental basis
or material for our full-blown consciousness, the one who allows
us to successfully report seeing a ripe tomato or a dot on a screen.
One may use the metaphor of a ‘growing tree’ to better express
this idea: that in order to understand the nature of our directly
perceivable or accessible conscious experiences (i.e. the contents
of conscious experiences that we can explicitly attend to and
report), one needs to go back to its pre-reflective, implicit and
less accessible, less visible bodily roots. This is because basic
pre-reflective bodily forms of conscious experiences may serve
as a basis for more sophisticated and meta-cognitive-type con-
sciousness. Examining the early and pre-reflective roots of the
‘growing tree’ of embodied minds may teach us something essen-
tial not only about its accessible aspects but also about the entire
structure of minds, understood as a whole.
Conclusion and future directions
This paper advances the idea that consciousness science may
be put on a fruitful track for its next stage by examining the
nature of subjective experiences through a bottom-up develop-
mental lens. Most theoretical and empirical discussions about the
nature of consciousness are typically framed in a way that tacitly
endorses an adult-centric and vision-based perspective. Here, we
draw attention to the idea that in order to understand what con-
sciousness ‘is’, one should first tackle the fundamental question:
how do embodied experiences ‘arise’ from square one?
We started with the observation that the problem of con-
sciousness cannot be addressed in isolation from the question of
experiences, which in turn are intrinsically linked to the question
of experiencing subjects. Making explicit the fact that conscious-
ness is fundamentally linked to experiencing subjects flags out the
idea that humans are embodied and situated living organisms,
essentially concerned with self-preservation within a precarious
environment.
Next, we built upon the influential Predictive Processing frame-
work in philosophy of mind and computational neuroscience to
motivate the claim that in order to understand the nature of con-
scious experiences, one needs to go back to prior experiences,
which are fundamental in shaping the experiences of an embodied
subject situated in the here and now. We employed the metaphor
of a growing tree to argue that in order to understand the nature of
our conscious experiences one must explore its pre-reflective and
implicit bodily roots. Indeed, pre-reflective bodily forms of (self)-
consciousness may serve as a basis for more sophisticated and
meta-cognitive types of (self)-consciousness.
Then, we drew attention to a universal, essential, yet over-
looked aspect, namely that the earliest and closest environment
of human experiencing subjects is the body of another human
experiencing subject. Embodied experiencing subjects are thusDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2021/2/niab037/6432320 by guest on 17 July 2022

fundamentally and biophysiologically linked to another embod-
ied experiencing subject from the outset. We presented evidence
speaking in favour of fairly sophisticated forms of early sen-
sorimotor integration of bodily sensory signals and movements
already being established in utero . Examining the early and pre-
reflective roots of the ‘growing tree’ of embodied minds may
teach us something essential not only about its directly accessi-
ble aspects (i.e. the contents of conscious experiences that we can
explicitly attend to and report) but also about the entire structure
of minds, understood as a whole.
This fundamental ontological and biophysiological depen-
dence of an embodied experiencing subject on another embodied
experiencing subject may have profound implications on the way
we understand the very nature of conscious experiences. Future
work needs to address in more detail what are the implications
of this primitive and universal co-embodiment on the very nature
of our conscious experiences. For example, it may question the
idea of an integrative model of consciousness restricted to and
built mainly upon adult-centric and vision-based conscious expe-
riences. Cashing out all conscious experiences in terms of primar-
ily visual processing may cause us to overlook the fundamental
multisensory , relational and dynamic nature of our perceptual
experiences from the outset, in early life. Second, setting the focus
on the nature of early experiences may also shed light on the
question of consciousness (or its lack) in non-human animals. It
may even help speak to debates on the potential conscious sta-
tus of non-neural organisms such as plants ( Trewavas et al. 2020 ),
single cells ( Delafield-Butt et al. 2012 ;Baluška et al. 2021 ) or per-
haps more pertinently , complex brain organoids grown in the
laboratory ( Bayne et al. 2019 ).
Finally , endorsing a developmental view may help us develop
a more dynamical, ‘real-life’ understanding of conscious experi-
ences, based on an explanatory model focusing on how we ‘relate’
to our self, body and the world, rather than exploring how we stat-
ically and photographically ‘detect’ and report a small dot on a
screen.
