## Abstract

Misophonia, a neurobehavioral syndrome, reduces tolerance to specific stimuli and impacts various domains of life. It is also strongly correlated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of misophonia among medical students at King Saud University (KSU), Saudi Arabia, identify related sociodemographic factors, and assess misophonia association with OCD and depression. This cross-sectional study included 371 participants. The study tool was distributed electronically between November 19 and December 07, 2023. It consisted of 4 sections: a questionnaire developed  by  the  research  team,  the  Amsterdam  Misophonia  Scale  (A-MISO-S),  the  Obsessive-Compulsive  InventoryRevised  (OCI-R),  and  the  Patient  Health  Questionnaire-9  (PHQ-9).  The  results  indicated  that  42.32%  of  the  participants had previously experienced misophonia, with symptoms developing suddenly in 28.66%. The majority of participants had subclinical misophonia (71.16%) and minimal depression (37.47%), with a significant proportion experiencing mild-to-severe misophonia (28.84%) and varying degrees of depression (33.15%). Approximately 31.00% of the students exhibited likely OCD. The PHQ-9 and A-MISO-S scores showed weak positive correlations, whereas the OCI-R and A-MISO-S scores showed a moderate positive correlation. Furthermore, a moderate positive correlation was observed between the OCI-R and PHQ-9 scores. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that sex, family history of misophonia, depression severity, and OCD were significantly associated with clinical misophonia. This study underscores the significance of recognizing misophonia among medical students and its associated factors, such as OCD and depression. Further multicenter studies using more rigorous research methodologies are warranted.

## 1. Introduction

Misophonia  is  a  neurobehavioral  syndrome  characterized  by reduced  tolerance  to  specific  stimuli,  resulting  in  heightened autonomic nervous system arousal. [1]  The prevalence of misophonia  varies  among  studies, [2-4] with  evidence  suggesting  a familial  tendency. [3,5,6] Symptoms  of  misophonia  often  onset during  childhood  or  adolescence. [3,5,7] A  study  indicated  that

75%  of  the  301  participants  experienced  misophonic  symptom onset during childhood or teenage years, with symptoms intensifying  over  time. [5] Another  study  in  the  United  States (US) involving 1061 participants found a correlation between a higher level of misophonia and earlier age of onset. [7]

Misophonic triggers are precise and encompass visual cues, such  as  pointing  fingers,  leg  jiggling,  or  hair  twisting, [8] and

auditory cues, such as chewing, low-frequency bass sounds, pen clicking, and typing. [9] While lip-smacking, sniffling, and throat clearing  represent  the  primary  organic  or  biological  sounds that  serve  as  misophonic  triggers,  affected  individuals  also report distress caused by non-organic sounds, such as electronic noises, keyboard tapping, and animal sounds. [10]  Furthermore, a study revealed a significant correlation between misophonic reaction intensity and the volume and duration of the triggering stimuli. [11]

Misophonic phenomena can elicit physiological, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive responses. [1,9,11,12] Emotional responses include annoyance, irritation, anger, and anxiety. [1,9,11] Behavioral responses include avoidance, glaring at, or mimicking the person producing the sound, as well as verbal and physical aggression. [12] Physical manifestations include chest, shoulder, head, or body pressure; elevated body temperature; pain; headache; and breathing difficulties. [9]

Misophonia  can  negatively  affect various life domains, including  social  interactions,  occupational  performance,  and overall role functioning. [13-15] It also affects an individual's overall quality of life; as misophonia symptoms worsen, their impact on quality of life becomes more pronounced. [7]

Several studies have shown that misophonia is strongly correlated  with  comorbid  obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD) and depression. [2,16,17] For example, an American study demonstrated  a  significant  increase  in  the  likelihood  of  clinically significant OCD symptoms among individuals with misophonia.  Similarly,  research  has  indicated  a  significant  correlation between misophonia and depression. [2,7,13,17] Furthermore, some studies indicated that the intensity of misophonia tends to  decrease  when  no  concurrent  psychiatric  disorders  are present. [5]

Research on misophonia among students has also been conducted. For example, a study in the United Kingdom assessed the prevalence of misophonia among 336 undergraduate medical students. The study revealed that 49.1% of the participants exhibited clinically significant symptoms, 37% displayed mild symptoms, 12% showed moderate symptoms, and 0.3% exhibited severe symptoms. [18]

In  Saudi Arabia  (SA),  very  limited  research  has  been  conducted  concerning  misophonia.  The  present  study  aimed  to estimate the prevalence of misophonia among medical students at King Saud University (KSU), identify associated sociodemographic factors, and assess the association of OCD and depression  with  misophonia  among  participants.  This  study  adds to  the  literature  on  misophonia  in  SA  and  provides  valuable insights  for  stakeholders,  including  physicians,  academicians, and policymakers.

## 2. Materials and methods

## 2.1. Study design, setting, and participants

A  quantitative  cross-sectional  study  was  conducted  among the  targeted  population:  all  medical  students,  both  male  and female, enrolled in the first through fifth years at KSU Medical College in Riyadh, SA. The exclusion criteria encompassed students  with  any  communication  barriers  and  those  who  were in the preparatory or internship year at the time of the study. The research team distributed the study tool electronically to reduce costs and time among participants between November 19 and December 07, 2023 via social media channels, such as WhatsApp. Concerning the sample size, the number of medical students at KSU Medical College was estimated to be approximately  1494,  including  both  males  and  females.  Using  the Raosoft  sample  size  calculator  (http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html), with a margin of error of 5% and a confidence level of 95%, the estimated sample size was 306 participants. An additional 20% was added to account for nonrespondents (367 students).

## 2.2. Study instruments

The study instrument consisted of 4 sections: a questionnaire developed  by  the  research  team,  the  Amsterdam  Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S), the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).

The research team developed a questionnaire to assess sociodemographic factors, including age, sex, and current academic year. The questionnaire also evaluated whether the participant had been diagnosed with a mental health condition and if they were currently receiving any psychotropic medication. It further assessed if they had ever experienced misophonic-related symptoms  and,  if  they  had,  the  onset  (whether  gradual  or sudden), and the age of onset. Additionally, the questionnaire inquired about the presence of a family history of misophonia, and if present, the degree of the relationship with this family member.

The A-MISO-S is a self-report scale that measures the presence  and  severity  of  symptoms  experienced  in  response  to specific  auditory  stimuli. [19] It  comprises  7  questions:  6  are multiple-choice questions and the last is a short-answer question.  It  is  rated  on  a  5-point  ordinal  scale  ranging  from  0  to 4, with a total possible score of 24. The scores are interpreted as  follows:  0  to  4  indicate  subclinical  misophonic  symptoms; 5 to 9, mild; 10 to 14, moderate; 15 to 19, severe; and 20 to 24,  extreme. [20] Previous  studies  demonstrated  the  validity  of the scale, with Cronbach's alpha values of 0.838, [19]  0.89, [4] and 0.814. [18] We obtained permission from the authors of the scale for its use in the present study.

The OCI-R is a self-report assessment tool designed to measure the severity of OCD symptoms. [21]  It is used in clinical and research settings to assess the presence and intensity of various obsessive  thoughts  and  compulsive  behaviors  associated  with OCD. [21] One study showed that the OCI-R exhibits a sensitivity of 84.4%, specificity of 85.6%, positive predictive value of 85.4%,  and  negative  predictive  value  of  84.6%. [22] The  scale comprises 18 questions, with answers scored from 0 ('not at all')  to  4  ('extremely'). The  scores  are  generated  by  adding each item score. [22] The possible range of total scores is 0 to 72. The recommended cutoff score is 21, with scores at or above this level indicating the likely presence of OCD. [22] The OCI-R is in the public domain, allowing its use free of charge without the need to obtain permission from its authors. [23,24]

The  PHQ-9  is  a  multipurpose  instrument  for  screening, monitoring, and measuring the severity of depression. [25]  The internal  reliability  of  the  PHQ-9  was  found  to  be  excellent, with a Cronbach's α of 0.89 in the PHQ Primary Care Study and 0.86 in the PHQ Ob-Gyn Study. [25,26]  The  questionnaire comprises 9 multiple-choice questions. The raw score ranges from  0  to  27,  with  higher  scores  indicating  greater  severity of  depressive  symptoms. [25] A  PHQ-9 score &gt; 10 has a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 88% for major depression. [25] The severity categories are as follows: minimal depression, 0 to 4; mild depression, 5 to 9; moderate depression, 10 to 14; moderately severe depression, 15 to 19; and severe depression, 20 to 27. The PHQ-9 was developed and copyrighted by Drs R.L. Spitzer, J.B. Williams, and K. Kroenke in 1999, funded by an  educational  grant  from  Pfizer  Inc. While  Pfizer  holds  the copyright to the PHQ-9, it is available for use and replication without needing permission. [25]

## 2.3. Descriptive statistics

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 29 (IBM  Corp.,  Armonk).  The  PHQ-9  scale  was  used  to  assess the severity of depression. Misophonia was assessed using the A-MISO-S. The OCI-R was used to assess the presence of OCD. The cutoff points used for the 3 scales were as follows: a score of ≥ 10 for the PHQ-9, [25]  ≥ 5 for the A-MISO-S, [20] and ≥ 21 for the OCI-R.

ADHD = attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, OCPD = obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, SD = standard deviation.

Categorical variables are presented as frequency and percentage (%) and were analyzed using the chi-square test. Numerical data are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD), analyzed using the independent-samples   test and one way analt ysis of variance. Testing for normality of the distribution was done using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and post hoc testing was done using Bonferroni adjustment. Pearson's correlation was used to study  the  association  between  different  numerical  variables. Multiple  logistic  regression  was  employed  to  investigate  the factors associated with clinical misophonia (individuals with an A-MISO-S score between 5 and 24). Statistical significance was set at P ≤ .05.

## 3. Results

Table 1  presents  the  demographic  characteristics  of  the  participants. A total of 371 individuals participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 21.14 years, SD = 1.59 years. Of the participants, 234 (63.07 %) were males, and the remaining 137 (36.93%) were females. Most participants, 113 (30.46%), were second-year students. Only 58 (15.63%) participants  were  diagnosed  with  mental  health  conditions:  40 (68.97%)  and  18  (31.03%)  were  diagnosed  with  depression and anxiety, respectively. Among the participants, 26 (7.01%) were  taking  psychotropic  medications.  Of  the  students,  157 (42.32  %)  had  experienced  misophonia,  with  45  (28.66%) and 43 (27.39%) experiencing misophonia-related symptoms that developed suddenly and gradually, respectively. Out of the 152 students who had experienced misophonia, only 7 (4.61%) experienced misophonia during early childhood (age, ≤ 4

years),  46  (30.26%)  during  childhood  (age,  5-12  years),  65 (42.76%)  during  teenage  years  (age,  13-17  years),  and  34 (22.37%) during adulthood (age, ≥ 18 years). Eighty (21.56%) participants had family members who previously experienced misophonia. Seventy-nine out of these 80 specified the degree of  the  relationship  with  the  family  member  who  had  previously experienced misophonia, with 71 (89.87%) being firstdegree family members. Twenty-five (32.47%) and 23 (29.87%) students  responded  to  misophonic  sounds  inwardly  and  outwardly, respectively.

Table 2 presents the A-MISO-S, PHQ-9, and OCI-R scores of the participants. The mean A-MISO-S score of the participants was 3.22, SD = 3.48. Most of the students, 264 (71.16%), had subclinical  misophonia.  Eighty-three  (22.37%),  21  (5.66%), and 3 (0.81%) students experienced mild, moderate, and severe misophonia, respectively.  Out  of  371  students,  107  (28.84%) had clinical misophonia. The mean PHQ-9 score of the participants was 7.39, SD = 5.76. Among the students, 139 (37.47%) had  minimal  depression,  109  (29.38%)  had  mild  depression, 80 (21.56%) had moderate depression, 29 (7.82%) had moderately  severe  depression,  and  14  (3.77%)  had  severe  depression. Thus, of the 371 students, 123 (33.15%) were found to have depression. The mean OCI-R score of the participants was 15.49, SD = 12.51. Among the 371 students, 115 (31.00%) had likely OCD.

Table 3  shows  the  associations  between  the  A-MISO-S, PHQ-9,  and  OCI-R  scores.  Pearson's  correlation  analysis revealed  significant  associations  between  these  variables. The  correlation  coefficient  ( r ) between  the  PHQ-9  and A-MISO-S scores was 0.276 ( P &lt; .001),  indicating  a  weak positive  correlation.  Additionally,  the  correlation  coefficient between the OCI-R and A-MISO-S scores was 0.333 ( P &lt; .001),  indicating  a  moderately  positive  correlation. Similarly, the correlation coefficient between the OCI-R and PHQ-9 scores was 0.478 ( P &lt; .001), also indicating a moderately positive correlation.

Table 4  shows  the  association  between  the  PHQ-9  categories  and  OCD  across  misophonia  categories.  Depression categories showed significant associations: the percentage of students with minimal depression and subclinical misophonia (114, 43.2%) was higher than that of students with minimal depression  and  mild,  moderate,  or  severe  misophonia  (23, 27.7%; 2, 9.5%; and 0, 0%, respectively). Furthermore, the percentage of students with mild depression and subclinical misophonia (82, 31.1%) was higher than that of students with mild  depression  and  mild,  moderate,  or  severe  misophonia (24, 28.9%; 3, 14.3%; and 0, 0%, respectively). Moreover, the percentage of students with moderate depression and severe misophonia (2, 66.7%) was higher than that of students with moderate depression and subclinical, mild, or moderate misophonia (45, 17%; 24, 28.9%; and 9, 42.9%, respectively). The percentage of students with moderately severe depression and moderate misophonia (7, 33.3%) was higher than that of students with moderately severe depression and subclinical, mild, or severe misophonia (15, 5.7%; 7, 8.5%; and 0, 0%, respectively).  In  addition,  the  percentage  of  students  with  severe depression and severe misophonia (1, 33.3%) was higher than that of students with severe depression and subclinical, mild, or moderate misophonia (8, 3%; 5, 6%; and 0, 0%, respectively; P &lt; .001).

The  association  with  OCD  was  significant:  the  percentage of  students  with  likely  OCD  and  moderate  misophonia  (16, 76.2%) was higher than that of students with likely OCD and subclinical, mild, or severe misophonia (61, 23.1%; 36, 43.4%; and 2, 66.7%, respectively; P &lt; .001).

Table 5 shows the associations between participant demographic characteristics and the A-MISO-S, PHQ-9, and OCI-R scores. Age, sex, diagnosis of a mental health condition, current  use  of  psychotropic  medication,  history  of  experiencing misophonia,  and  family  history  of  misophonia  showed  significant  associations  with  the  A-MISO-S  score.  The  correlation  coefficient  between  age  and  the  A-MISO-S  score  was 0.123 ( P = .018), indicating a weak positive correlation. The mean A-MISO-S score was lower among males (mean = 2.79, SD = 3.21)  than  among  females  (mean = 3.96,  SD = 3.79) ( P = .003).  The  mean  A-MISO-S  score  of  participants  diagnosed with a mental health condition (mean = 4.29,  SD = 4) was  higher  than  that  of  those  not  diagnosed  with  a  mental health  condition  (mean = 3.02,  SD = 3.34)  ( P = .026).  The mean A-MISO-S score of participants who were taking psychotropic  medications  (mean = 4.96,  SD = 3.85)  was  higher than  that  of  those  who  were  not  taking  any  psychotropic medications  (mean = 3.09,  SD = 3.42)  ( P = .008).  The  mean A-MISO-S  score  of  participants  who  had  previously  experienced misophonia  (mean = 5.34, SD = 3.51) was  higher than  that  of  those  who  had  not  experienced  misophonia (mean = 1.66,  SD = 2.49)  ( P &lt; .001).  The  mean  A-MISO-S score of participants who had a family member with a history of misophonia (mean = 5.13, SD = 3.74) was higher than that of participants who did not have a family member with a history of misophonia (mean = 1.6, SD = 2.33). Participants who indicated  that  they  did  not  know  had  a  score  (mean = 3.49, SD = 3.52) that was higher than that of those who had a family member with a history of misophonia but lower than that of those who had no family members with misophonia ( P &lt; .001).

Age,  sex,  current  academic  year,  diagnosis  of  a  mental health condition, current use of psychotropic medication, history  of  experiencing  misophonia, and family history of misophonia showed significant associations with the PHQ-9 score. The correlation coefficient between age and the PHQ-9 score was  0.15  ( P = .004),  indicating  a  weak  positive  correlation. The mean PHQ-9 score among males (mean = 6.51, SD = 5.8) was  lower  than  that  among  females  (mean = 8.9,  SD = 5.38) ( P &lt; .001).  The  mean  PHQ-9  score  of  second-year  students (mean = 9.04,  SD = 5.63)  was  higher  than  that  of  fourth(mean = 5.18, SD = 5.35) and fifth-year students (mean = 5.88, SD = 5.44) ( P &lt; .001).

The  mean  PHQ-9 score  of  participants  who  had  previously  experienced  misophonia (mean = 8.54, SD = 5.89) was higher than that of those who had not experienced misophonia (mean = 6.55, SD = 5.52) ( P = .001).  The  mean  PHQ-9  score  of  participants  who  had a  family  member with a history of misophonia (mean = 8.99,

SD = 5.7)  was  higher  than  that  of  participants  who  did  not have a family member with a history of misophonia (mean = 6, SD = 5.65). Participants who indicated that they did not know had a higher score (mean = 7.64, SD = 5.66) than those who had no family members with misophonia; however, their score was not different from that of those who had family members with misophonia ( P = .001).

Age, sex, current academic year, diagnosis of a mental health condition,  current  use  of  psychotropic  medication,  history  of experiencing  misophonia,  and  family  history  of  misophonia showed significant associations with the OCI-R score. The correlation coefficient between age and the OCI-R score was 0.194 ( P &lt; .001),  indicating  a  weak  positive  correlation.  The  mean OCI-R score  of  males  (mean = 13.25,  SD = 11.94)  was  lower than  that  of  females  (mean = 19.33,  SD = 12.58);  ( P &lt; .001). The mean OCI-R score of second-year students (mean = 19.76, SD = 13.24)  was  higher  than  that  of  fourth-  (mean = 11.75, SD = 13.48) and fifth-year students and (mean = 11.45, SD = 9.66)  ( P &lt; .001). The  mean  OCI-R  score  of  participants diagnosed  with  a mental  health condition (mean = 19.93, SD = 12.51) was higher than that of participants not diagnosed with  a  mental  health  condition  (mean = 14.67,  SD = 12.36) ( P = .003).  The  mean  OCI-R  score  of  participants  who  were taking  psychotropic  medications  (mean = 23.12,  SD = 14.26) was higher than that of those who were not taking psychotropic medications  (mean = 14.92,  SD = 12.2)  ( P = .001).  The  mean OCI-R score  of  participants  who  had  previously  experienced misophonia (mean = 18.92, SD = 13.24) was higher than that of those who had not experienced misophonia (mean = 12.98, SD = 11.34)  ( P &lt; .001).  The  mean  OCI-R  score  of  participants  who  had  a  family  member  with  a  history  of  misophonia (mean = 18.53, SD = 13.06) was higher than that of those who did not have a family member with a history of misophonia  (mean = 12.13,  SD = 11.35).  Participants  who  indicated that  they  did  not  know  had  a  higher  score  (mean = 16.49, SD = 12.59) than those who had no family members with misophonia; however, their score was not different from that of those who had family members with misophonia ( P &lt; .001).

Table 6  shows  the  association  between  the  participants' demographic  characteristics  and  misophonia,  depression,  and OCD. Sex, diagnosis of a mental health condition, current use of psychotropic medication, history of  experiencing  misophonia, and family history  of  misophonia  showed  significant  associations with the A-MISO-S. The percentage of males with clinical misophonia (51, 21.8%) was lower than that of females with clinical misophonia (56, 40.9%) ( P &lt; .001). The percentage of participants who were diagnosed with a mental health condition and had clinical misophonia (24, 41.4%) was higher than that of those who were not diagnosed with a mental health condition and had clinical misophonia (83, 26.5%), ( P = .022). The percentage of participants who were taking psychotropic medications  and  had  clinical  misophonia  (14,  53.8%)  was  higher than that of those who were not taking any psychotropic medications and had clinical misophonia (93, 27%) ( P = .004). The percentage  of  participants  who  experienced  misophonia  and had clinical misophonia (85, 54.1%) was higher than that of those who had not previously experienced misophonia and had clinical misophonia (22, 10.3%) ( P &lt; .001). The percentage of participants  who  had  a  family  member  who  had  experienced misophonia  and  had  clinical  misophonia  (43,  53.8%)  was higher than that of those who did not have any family member who had previously experienced misophonia and had clinical misophonia (11, 9%) and those who did not know if a family member had misophonia (53, 31.4%) ( P &lt; .001).

Age,  sex,  current  academic  year,  diagnosis  of  a  mental health condition, current use of psychotropic medication, history  of  experiencing  misophonia, and family history of misophonia showed a significant association with the PHQ-9. The mean age of participants  who  had  depression  (mean = 20.80, SD = 1.55)  was  lower  than  that  of  those  who  did  not  have depression (mean = 21.31, SD = 1.58) ( P = .004). The percentage of males with depression (60, 25.6%) was lower than that of females with depression (63, 46.0%) ( P &lt; .001). The percentage of second-year students who had depression (51, 45.1%) was higher than that of fourth- (8, 13.3% and fifth-year students  (14,  20.9%)  ( P &lt; .001).  The  percentage  of  participants who were diagnosed with a mental health condition and had depression (38, 65.5%) was higher than that of those who were not diagnosed with a mental health condition and had depression  (85,  27.2%)  ( P &lt; .001).  The  percentage  of  participants who were taking psychotropic medications and had depression (19, 73.1%) was higher than that of those who were not taking

Table 7 presents the results of a multivariable logistic regression  analysis  identifying  factors  associated  with  the  presence of clinical misophonia. The analysis indicated that sex, family history of misophonia, depression severity, and OCD are significantly associated with the presence of clinical misophonia. Sex showed a significant  association  with  the  presence  of  clinical misophonia. Compared with males, females had higher odds of having clinical  misophonia  (odds  ratio  (OR) = 1.70,  95%  CI: 1.01, 2.87, P = .048). A family history of misophonia showed a significant association with the presence of clinical misophonia.  Compared  with  participants  without  a  family  history  of misophonia, those with a family member who had experienced misophonia and those who could not remember whether they had  a  family  member  who  had  experienced  misophonia  had higher  odds  of  having  clinical  misophonia  (OR = 9.53,  95% CI: 4.32, 21.03, P &lt; .001 and OR = 3.97, 95% CI: 1.93, 8.18, P &lt; .001, respectively). Depression severity showed a significant association with the presence of clinical misophonia. Compared with participants who had minimal depression, those who had moderately severe depression had higher odds of having clinical misophonia (OR = 2.72, 95% CI: 1.04, 7.12, P = .042). OCD showed a significant  association  with  the  presence  of  clinical misophonia.  Compared  with  participants  who  had  no  OCD, participants  who  had  likely  OCD  had  higher  odds  of  having clinical misophonia (OR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.28, 3.94, P = .005).

## 4. Discussion

In our study, 42.76% of the participants who experienced misophonia reported its onset during their teenage years, whereas 30.26% reported its onset during childhood. A previous study conducted  in  the  Netherlands  found  that  45%  and  30%  of participants reported misophonia onset during childhood and teenage years, respectively. [5] Our findings and those of the previous  study [5] indicate  a  common  occurrence  of  misophonia onset  during  childhood  and  adolescent  years.  Therefore,  we recommend  screening  for  misophonia  in  at-risk  age  groups. Concerning the nature of the response to misophonic sounds in  our  study,  32.47%  of  participants  displayed  inward  reactions,  whereas 29.87% exhibited outward responses. Another study conducted in the UK explored the nature of responses to misophonic sounds. [18]  We propose enhancing the awareness of misophonia and implementing screening strategies  to  identify individuals who may be affected by this condition. Furthermore, our study found that 27.39% of the participants who experienced  misophonia  reported  gradually  developing  symptoms. In contrast, a previous study in the Netherlands revealed that most participants (93%) reported a gradual onset of misophonia. [6] The variation between our findings and those of previous

studies [6] could  be  attributed  to  methodological  differences. Specifically,  most  (74%)  participants  in  the  previous  study [6] were  already  diagnosed  with  misophonia,  whereas  our  study did not require participants to have a prior diagnosis for participation.  Despite  the  differing  percentages,  our  findings  and those  of  the  previous  study [6] indicate  that  misophonia  onset may be gradual. Therefore,  implementing  screening  strategies could be beneficial for identifying misophonia at an early stage, enabling  early  intervention  and  support.  Furthermore,  our findings  revealed  that  most  participants  experienced  subclinical  misophonia, with approximately one-third of them exhibiting clinical misophonia. Contrary to our findings, a previous study conducted among undergraduate medical students in the UK reported that almost half exhibited clinical misophonia. [18] The variance in percentages between our findings and those of the previous study [18] could be attributed to differences in the demographic composition: most (73%) participants in the previous  study [18] were  females.  Notably,  other  studies  have  also shown a  higher  prevalence  of  misophonia  among  females. [3,4] Despite  these  percentage  variations,  we  recommend  increasing  awareness  of  misophonia  among  medical  students.  Such awareness initiatives are crucial, as the condition could trigger a spectrum of physiological, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive responses. [1,12]

The  present  study  identified  a  weak  positive  correlation between  the  PHQ-9  and  A-MISO-S  scores  and  a  moderate  positive  correlation  between  the  OCI-R  and A-MISO-S scores.  Our  findings  align  with  those  of  a  previous  study involving  undergraduate medical science students. The previous  study  also  found  a  significant  association  between misophonia,  depression,  and  OCD. [2]   We  recommend  that universities establish screening programs to identify students with misophonia, depression, and OCD. Early identification and intervention are crucial as misophonia, depression, and OCD negatively affect individuals' lives. [7,14,27,28] Furthermore, in  our  study,  depression  severity  showed  a  significant  association with the presence of clinical misophonia, consistent with  the  findings  of  another  study  conducted  in  Poland [17] using  the  hospital  anxiety  and  depression  scale.  The  study conducted  in  Poland [17]   showed  a  moderately  positive  correlation between the severity of misophonia and depressive symptoms. Similarly, our study revealed a significant association between OCD categories and misophonia. Correlations between misophonia and psychiatric symptoms and illnesses have  been  reported  previously. [16,29]   In  addition,  previous research has found that the intensity of misophonia diminishes  in  the  absence  of  concurrent  psychiatric  disorders. [5] Screening  for  depression  and  OCD  among  students  with misophonia  symptoms,  and  vice  versa,  is  crucial  for  early identification and appropriate intervention.

Furthermore, our results indicate a weak positive correlation  between  age  and  the  A-MISO-S  score.  Another  study conducted  in  Singapore [30]   found  that  age  was  not  significantly associated with the severity of misophonia symptoms. Our research found a significant association between female sex and misophonia, with the mean A-MISO-S score in males being  lower  than  that  in  females.  This  finding  is  consistent with that of study conducted in Turkey, although the association observed in that study was not statistically significant. [3] However, our findings  concerning  sex  and  misophonia  were inconsistent  with  those  of  studies  conducted  in  the  USA [14] and  Germany, [4]   which  found  no  significant  sex  differences. Concerning  the  mental  health  condition(s)  in  our  research, the mean A-MISO-S score among participants diagnosed with a mental health condition was higher than that among those without  such  a  diagnosis.  These  results  are  consistent  with those of a study conducted in Turkey involving high school and college students, [19] which showed that the mean A-AMISO-R score was higher among those with a known psychiatric disorder than among those with no psychiatric disorder. Therefore, screening for psychiatric conditions in patients with misophonia  is  recommended. Furthermore, our results indicated that the use of psychotropic medication was significantly associated with  misophonia,  a  finding  that  we  hypothesize  reflects  the coexistence of misophonia with other psychiatric conditions. Our hypothesis aligns with a study conducted in China that revealed a medium-to-strong relationship between misophonic symptoms  and  anxiety,  depression,  and  OCD. [31]   This  aligns with another study that found that misophonia may be related to  multiple  forms  of  psychopathology  through  either  direct or  associative  relationships. [14] Furthermore,  our  results  suggest that having a family history of misophonia may increase an individual's likelihood of having misophonia, indicating a potential genetic predisposition to the condition. This finding is consistent with those of previous studies. [3,32] Therefore, we recommend screening both individuals experiencing misophonia and their family members for the condition.

Regarding  the  PHQ-9  score,  our  study  found  that  females tended to have higher mean PHQ-9 scores than males and that the percentage of females with depression was higher than that of males. These findings are consistent with those of a prior study involving adolescents, which showed that sex was a significant predictor, with male students being less likely to have depression  than  female  students. [33] Furthermore,  our  findings  are consistent with those of another study conducted in SA [34] ; however, the results of that study were not statistically significant. Furthermore, our study found that the mean age of participants who had depression was lower than that of participants who did not have depression. This finding is inconsistent with that of a study conducted in India, [35] which found a significant increase in prevalence with age. The variation between our results and those of the Indian study could be attributed to the differences in  the  sample  populations.  Our  study  focused  exclusively  on medical students, whereas the Indian study incorporated a more diverse  sample  from  various  specialties.  Furthermore,  in  our study, we found that the percentage of students with depression in the first 3 years was higher than that in the fourth and fifth years. This result suggests that students in the first 3 years might have difficulties adjusting to medical school, potentially contributing to an increased risk of depression. In another study conducted at the same institution (i.e., KSU), [36] the results showed a similar pattern of decreasing depressive scores in the later years of medical school. Furthermore, our study reported that participants with mental health conditions had higher PHQ-9 scores than those without mental health conditions. Hence, clinicians should recognize the increased risk of depression in individuals with mental health conditions. Furthermore, our data showed that the percentage of participants who experienced misophonia and depression was higher than that of those who had not experienced misophonia and had depression. These findings are consistent with those of a study conducted in Iran, [2]  which indicated a significant and direct relationship between misophonia and depression.

Regarding  OCD,  our  results  showed  that  age  was  significantly associated with OCD, as participants with higher OCI-R scores  tended  to  be  slightly  younger,  suggesting  that  younger students  might  be  more  susceptible  to  developing  OCD. This finding is consistent with that of a study conducted in Iraq, [37] which found that OCD symptoms were significantly related to younger age. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that males had  a  lower  mean  OCI-R  than  females.  Additionally,  female participants had a significantly higher likelihood of OCD than their male counterparts. These findings are consistent with those of a study conducted in SA, [38]  which also reported that women were more prone to higher OCI-R scores. Moreover, our results were consistent with those of a broader meta-analysis, [39]  which found  that  women  were  1.6  times  more  likely  to  experience OCD than men. Hence, we recommend that clinicians consider sex-related  variations  when  assessing  OCD.  Furthermore,  our findings showed that participants in the first 3 years of college

had  a  higher  mean  OCI-R  score.  These  findings  align  with those  of  another  study,  which  indicated  a  significant  association between OCD and college years. [37]  Our findings also align with  those  of  a  study  conducted  at  Taibah  University,  SA, [40] which found an increase in the probability of OCD in the early academic years. Hence, we advise facilitating access to mental health services for college students, especially those in their first 3  years.  Furthermore,  in  our  study,  the  percentage  of  participants who were diagnosed with a mental health condition and had likely OCD was higher than that of participants who were not  diagnosed  with  a  mental  health  condition  and  had  likely OCD. This result reflects a possible association between mental health conditions and OCD. This finding aligns with that of a study conducted in the USA, [41]  which found that endorsement of  one  or  more  obsessive-compulsive  symptoms  was  significantly more frequent in the depressed group than in the nondepressed  group.  Furthermore,  we  found  that  participants taking  psychotropic  medications  had  a  higher  mean  OCI-R score  than  those  who  were  not.  Moreover,  the  percentage  of participants who were taking psychotropic medications and had likely OCD was higher than that of those who were not taking any psychotropic medications and had likely OCD. This finding indirectly supports the hypothesis that OCD is comorbid with other mental health conditions. Furthermore, our study showed that participants who had likely OCD had higher odds of having clinical misophonia than those without OCD. This result is consistent with that of a study conducted in Iran, [2] which found a  significant  relationship  between  misophonia  and  OCD.  We recommend that clinicians consider assessing for misophonia in individuals diagnosed with OCD. Furthermore, individuals with a family history of misophonia had higher mean OCI-R scores than those who did not. As such, we recommend screening for OCD in patients with a family history of misophonia, and vice versa.

## 5. Strengths and limitations

This  study  has  several  strengths  and  limitations.  In  terms  of strengths, this study addressed misophonia, which has not been sufficiently studied in SA. In addition, the tool comprises validated scales. Moreover, the sample size was sufficiently large to obtain significant results. Regarding limitations, the study was conducted solely at one location, namely KSU, potentially limiting the generalizability of the results. Future multicenter studies, such as those involving multiple universities, may mitigate this limitation. Another limitation is that convenience sampling was used to recruit participants. A more rigorous sampling method can yield more meaningful results.

## 6. Conclusions

This study assessed the prevalence of misophonia and its association with depression and OCD. Among other significant findings, we found that close to half (42.32%) of the participants had  experienced  misophonia,  with  clinical  misophonia  being observed more in females than in males. In addition, we found a significant correlation between misophonia, OCD, and depression,  suggesting  that  individuals  with  misophonia  are  more susceptible  to  these  mental  health  conditions,  and  vice  versa. We  recommend  increasing  awareness  of  misophonia  and  its manifestations to facilitate early detection and proper management. We also recommend screening for depression and OCD in patients with misophonia.
