The Selective  Sound  Sensitivity  Syndrome  Scale  (S-Five)  is  a  contemporary and multidimensional self-report instrument measuring different aspects of misophonia. The five-factor scale consists of 25 items measuring the severity of the misophonic experience. The items capture misophonia in relation to internalising and externalising appraisals, perceived threat, aggressive behavior (outbursts), and adverse impact on individuals' lives. It is complemented by a trigger checklist (S-Five-T), measuring the emotional nature and intensity of reactions to sensory triggers. In this work, we administered the S-Five in two German samples with a majority of individuals with significant misophonia. The S-Five and the supplementary S-Five-T were both translated into German using a rigorous translation procedure (i.e., TRAPD) and were separately tested in  large  German  community  samples.  Psychometric  analyses  included  the evaluation  of  the  factor  structure,  measurement  invariance  with  respect  to age and gender, reliability (internal consistency and stability over time), and an extensive examination of the construct validity in a proposed nomological network.  The  nomological  network  we  explore  in  this  work  consists  of several constructs including different misophonic manifestations, anger and aggression,  disgust  propensity,  anxiety  sensitivity,  depression,  obsessivecompulsive traits, and functional impairment in different life domains. Results indicate evidence in line with the nomological network as demonstrated by strong correlations between the S-Five dimensions and convergent measures. All S-Five dimensions strongly correlated with overall misophonic symptoms ( r ≥ 0.53).  Internalising  appraisals  were  highly  associated  with  insight  into excessive  or  disproportionate  reactions  to  sounds  ( r ≥ 0.59),  externalising appraisals  with  anger  and  irritability  ( r ≥ 0.46),  threat  with  trait  anxiety  and dysregulation facets ( r ≥ 0.62), aggressive behavior (outbursts) with anger and behavioral dysregulation ( r ≥ 0.70),  and  impact with distress and functional impairment ( r ≥ 0.64). The results demonstrate that the S-Five has a robust five-factor structure and allows to draw reliable and valid conclusions about misophonic  experiences  in  German  samples.  The  proposed  nomological network gives an initial insight into the nature of misophonia and provides

- a  formalized  fundament  to  develop  and  test  further  hypotheses  about misophonia in a more sophisticated and symptom-oriented way.

## Introduction

Misophonia is a disorder related to decreased tolerance to certain  sounds  (Swedo  et  al.,  2022),  most  commonly  sounds related to eating, nose  and  throat  sounds,  and  repetitive environmental sounds (Vitoratou et al., 2021a). Individuals with misophonia  can  experience  profound  distress  and  functional impairment  from  their  emotional,  physical  and  behavioral responses to these sounds (e.g., Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2014; Brout et al., 2018; Jager et al., 2020).

approach and resulting five core dimensions of misophonia, this scale measures typical misophonic experiences in a more efficient manner. Further, the S-Five allows to investigate the emotional nature and intensity of triggers. The strengths of the S-Five would thus certainly complement the measurement of misophonia in German samples. We therefore see merit in providing a valid German translation of the S-Five and in utilizing the strengths of both the S-Five and BMQ-R to investigate associations between misophonic symptoms.

For the assessment of the multidimensional experience of misophonia,  Vitoratou  et  al.  (2021b)  developed  a  five-factor model scale known as the S-Five-E (Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Scale - Experiences). The S-Five was constructed based on  the  responses  and  feedback  of  a  large  sample  of  Englishspeaking self-identified misophonic  individuals, over four sampling waves. The resulting scale consists of 25-items corresponding  to  five  dimensions:  (1) internalising  appraisals attributing blame for reactions to oneself (e.g., believing to be an unlikable or angry person), (2) externalising appraisals blaming other people (e.g., believing others to be rude and inconsiderate), (3) perceived emotional threat (e.g., feeling distress, trapped and helpless), (4) having or fearing having verbal or physical outbursts , and (5) the impact of misophonia on the ability to do things they would like to do. Along with the main scale, the S-Five has a supplementary trigger checklist (S-Five-T), which captures the emotional  nature  and  intensity  of  the  responses  to  sounds (Vitoratou et al., 2021b, 2022a). The format of the S-Five-T allows the researcher or clinician to modify the trigger sounds list and the response types, in line with changes in the growing literature on the field and individual presentations of the disorder. The fivefactor model of the S-Five has been replicated in a large sample representative  of  the  UK  population  (Vitoratou  et  al.,  2022a). Excellent psychometric properties have been shown for the scale in English (Vitoratou et al., 2021b) and Mandarin (Vitoratou et al., 2022b), with cross-cultural replication of the five-factor model. A German translation, however, is still pending.

To our knowledge, the only genuine German questionnaire measuring  misophonic  symptoms  is  the  Berlin  Misophonia Questionnaire  Revised  (BMQ-R;  Remmert  et  al.,  2022).  The BMQ-R reflects the proposed diagnostic criteria of misophonia by Jager et al. (2020). However,  the  BMQ-R  is  a  long  and comprehensive diagnostical instrument comprising 77 items. In comparison,  given  the  S-Five's  inductive  scale  construction

Albeit evidence for the construct validity of the BMQ-R and the S-Five has been gathered, neither those two scales, nor any other misophonia questionnaire can be considered fully validated. Thus, construct validation plays a principal role in developing misophonia scales and in translating existing questionnaires. A widely  used  method  for  corroborating  construct  validity  is showing evidence in line with nomological networks (Cronbach and Meehl, 1955). In nomological networks theoretical associations of constructs are to be empirically demonstrated and new constructs (e.g., misophonic symptoms) are to be placed in the  proposed  associational  structure.  To  this  end,  hypotheses about relationships between attributes which are measured by a new instrument (e.g., the (German) S-Five) and convergent or discriminant constructs are formulated and tested. However, for relatively new constructs, such as misophonia, there is few and limited information on theoretical associations between constructs (i.e., misophonic symptoms or experiences). This does not imply the lack of a nomological network, but rather that it needs to be explored gradually. This study is a first and partially exploratory attempt to develop such a nomological network. The remainder  of  this  introduction  presents  the  descriptive  and theoretical  background  for  the  development  of  the  proposed nomological  network  of  misophonia,  followed  by  specific hypotheses and aims of the study.

A reasonable starting point for a nomological network of misophonic symptoms is the proposed diagnostic criteria put forward by Schröder et al. (2013) and revised by Jager et al. (2020). Based on a large sample of participants with misophonia, Jager et al. (2020) proposed five main symptom domains in their diagnostic  criteria  for  clinically  significant  misophonia:  (1) aversive emotional and physical reactions to sounds, with (2) insight into the excessive and  disproportional nature of responses, (3) loss of self-control, (4) avoidance behavior, and (5) functional impairment. This description largely coincides with the  recently  published  consensus  definition  of  misophonia

(Swedo  et  al.,  2022).  Nevertheless,  several  of  the  symptoms reported in the literature  are  not  covered  by  those  symptom domains, such as externalising and internalising appraisals as described by Vitoratou et al. (2021b) and Vitoratou et al. (2021a) and misophonic beliefs as described by Rosenthal et al. (2021). We  therefore  identified  further  symptom  domains  based  on phenomenological similarities, and explored how these domains relate to different nomological aspects of misophonia. Recognition of similar psychological processes (e.g., reactions to sounds  or  influences  on  reactions;  Swedo  et  al.,  2022)  and functions of symptoms (e.g., emotional regulation) is pivotal for the broadening of main symptom areas. This means grouping symptoms  not  necessarily  by  symptom  type  (e.g.,  a  domain related to behavioral, cognitive, etc. symptoms), but rather by the function of the symptom (e.g., a domain for behavior used for the function of avoiding sounds or associated perceived threat, as separate from a domain for behavior used for the function of emotion regulation).

Based on the symptoms reported in contemporary misophonia literature (Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2014; Brout et al., 2018; Potgieter et al., 2019; Jager et al., 2020; Vitoratou et al., 2021b;  Swedo  et  al.,  2022)  we  identified  five  main  symptom domains: (1) misophonic appraisals, (2) misophonic emotional experiences, (3) misophonia-specific dysregulation, (4) misophonic avoidance, and (5) misophonic impairment. Critically, these symptom domains serve to give the nomological network a broader  structure  by  clustering  symptoms.  In  order  to  better understand  this  clustering  attempt,  the  individual  symptom domains and their associated symptoms are described in further detail below.

Misophonic appraisals encompass symptoms associated with the subjective meaning or evaluation placed on or knowledge about one's own reactions to sounds and the circumstances in which they occur (i.e., attributional styles and clinical insight; Vitoratou et al., 2021b). These are meta-cognitive processes or beliefs  about  misophonic  symptoms,  rather  than  thoughts  in response to misophonia triggers. The initial item pool for the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (Rosenthal et al., 2021) included cognitive responses in the moment of triggers, but the items that were retained after factor analysis seemed to relate more to the state of urgency and intensity that occurs in that moment (e.g., 'I would do anything to make it stop, ' was retained), than to an appraisal of the situation (e.g., 'They do not care how this sound affects me, ' was not retained). In the symptom severity composite scale of the DMQ, these cognitive responses clustered together with other symptoms physical and emotion symptoms, not as a separate  'cognitive'  factor.  That  is,  cognitions  relating  to  the anguish of the moment were part of a dimension of physical, emotional  and  cognitive  distress,  and  cognitions  relating  to assumptions about the moment did not seem to be part of the latent  variable  of  misophonia symptom severity. We therefore focused  this  dimension  on  appraisals  reflecting  more  general beliefs  about  the  meaning  of  their  symptoms,  rather  than appraisals in the moment.

The domain includes internalising and externalising appraisals (blaming  for  symptom  experience;  Rosenthal  et  al.,  2021; Vitoratou et al., 2021b) as well as clinical insight (Jager et al., 2020; Swedo et al., 2022). Clinical insight included recognition of excess and recognition of disproportionality (e.g., see Jager et al., 2020). A broader definition of clinical insight includes the comprehension of  one's  own  symptoms  (i.e.,  symptom  coherence;  e.g.,  MossMorris et al., 2002; Witteman et al., 2011). However, symptom coherence is  a  characteristic  that  has  not  been  studied  in  the context  of  misophonia  yet  and  is  thus  entirely  exploratory  in our study.

Misophonic emotional experiences entail all immediate emotional and physical reactions and experiences to misophonic triggers (i.e., anger, irritability, aggression, disgust, anxiety, and corresponding physical symptoms). Note that aggression entails different phenomenological aspects. We follow Buss and Perry (1992)  distinguishing  anger  related  to  aggression,  verbal  and physical  aggression  as  well  as  hostility.  Physical  reactions  or symptoms  are  clustered  within  this  domain  since  physical symptoms are part of the emotional misophonic response (i.e., autonomic stress response or emotional arousal; e.g., Edelstein et al., 2013). Although it has been shown that physical symptoms can be modelled as a separate misophonic factor (e.g., Dibb et al., 2021; Rinaldi et al., 2021), we do not see the benefit in separating physical reactions from the domain emotional experiences.

Misophonic emotional experiences are to be distinguished from misophonia-specific dysregulation ,  which is defined as an extension  of  loss  of  self-control  (Remmert  et  al.,  2022)  as  an incapability  to  cope  with  emotional  experiences  as  well  as uncontrolled  behavioral  manifestations  for  elevated  levels  of emotional  arousal  and  negative  affectivity.  This  also  means disentangling various aspects of impaired self-control, including behavioral  dysregulation  (e.g.,  verbal  or  physical  aggression), cognitive, and emotional dysregulation (i.e., loss of control over emotional experiences; e.g., Swedo et al., 2022). This domain is a category into which failed coping attempts fit (e.g., Guetta et al., 2022). It is not yet clear which domain the S-Five construct of perceived emotional threat fits into, as it includes items related to experiencing anxiety and distress, which may fit in the emotional experiences domain, as well as items related to feeling trapped and helpless (i.e., lack of regulative strategies to cope with misophonic experiences), which may align with the dysregulation domain.

Misophonic  avoidance includes  dysfunctional  behavioral coping strategies to either prevent being exposed to misophonic sounds  (anticipated  avoidance)  or  escaping  such  situations (reactive avoidance; e.g., Remmert et al., 2022). Both avoidance behaviors form part of the definition of misophonia (Swedo et al., 2022). Rosenthal et al. (2021) showed that anticipated avoidance is the most prominent coping strategy before being faced with triggers, whereas reactive avoidance is the most prominent coping strategy when being triggered. Although avoidance behavior is a coping  strategy,  it  can  be  distinguished  from  dysregulation because it serves the purpose of (re-)gaining control over the stimuli and is not the incapability to control emotional reactions.

Grey squares represent symptoms being measured by the S-Five scales. Dashed lines around symptoms within symptoms domains shall indicate that symptom domains are not strictly separated. Strong associations are indicated by black arrows, weaker associations are grey, negative associations are blue with less negative associations in light blue, dashed arrows indicate uncertainty.

It may  also  include  behaviors  intended  to  prevent  feared consequences of emotional dysregulation.

The fifth  domain is misophonic impairment ,  which  entails symptoms associated with the suffering and limitations caused by misophonic experiences (e.g., Wu et al., 2014; Jager et al., 2020; Swedo et al., 2022). Functional impact can be assigned to life domains or activities in which the impact occurs: e.g., cognitive impact, social impact, and impact on daily routine (WHO, 2001). Further,  this domain  entails  distress  as  a  consequence  of misophonic symptoms including depressive mood and emotional burden (e.g., Jager et al., 2020; Remmert et al., 2022).

Note  that  this  clustering  of  symptoms  into  domains  is intended to facilitate the investigation of misophonic symptoms, rather than a strict classification. The domains may thus naturally overlap  in  some  characteristics,  while  grouping  misophonic symptoms reasonably. After having defined the broader structure of  the  nomological  network,  the  following  section  outlines theoretical, empirical, and exploratory assumptions about how the specific symptoms are associated with each other, both within and across  symptom  domains  (see  Figure  1).  Since  there  are  190 possible correlations between  symptoms,  we  pragmatically concentrated on the core nomological structure, which predominantly involves symptoms being measured by the S-Five (indicated in grey boxes in the network in Figure 1). This is also due to the fact that the German S-Five is the focus of the presented studies.  The  proposed assumptions on associations are drawn from both misophonia research and the broader literature on mental disorders.

## Associations in the nomological network

Principally, we expect that misophonic symptoms, regardless of their proposed symptom domain, are significantly positively associated with each other. This is based on the understanding that these symptoms together constitute the higher-order construct of misophonia and are hence naturally associated with each other, which is widely empirically supported (e.g., Rinaldi et al., 2021; Rosenthal et al., 2021; Vitoratou et al., 2021a,b, 2022a,b; Remmert et al., 2022). Moreover, misophonic symptoms within the proposed symptom domains are expected to be strongly associated since they are identified on account of sharing common characteristics and functions. Any exceptions to these two principles, as well as specific hypotheses about associations between symptoms from different symptom domains, are outlined  in  the  following  sections.  An additional  principle  of  our  validation  approach  is  that  explicit convergent measures (i.e., measures that exactly measure the same symptom) are assumed to correlate strongly.

## Misophonic appraisals

Misophonic attributional styles (internalising and externalising appraisals) have been shown to correlate moderately with each other  (Vitoratou  et  al.,  2021b),  which we  assume  to  replicate in this study. Beyond  this, the relationships  of  interest  for  misophonic  appraisals  are  with clinical insight (i.e., recognition of excess and disproportionality, and symptom coherence), functional impact and distress, as well as misophonia-specific aggressive behavior (S-Five outbursts).

Individuals  with  misophonia  often  recognize  that  their behavior  is excessive or disproportionate  to the situation (Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Jager et al., 2020; Swedo et al., 2022). Although  the  relationship  between  attributional  styles  and dimensions of clinical insight have not been investigated yet for misophonia, it is reasonable to assume that those recognizing their reactions as excessive or disproportionate would be more likely to attribute blame to themselves (internalising) than to other people (externalising). Critically, these relationships have been substantiated for psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia; Cotton et  al.,  2012)  and  neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., autistic spectrum conditions; Didehbani et al., 2012). We therefore expect a higher correlation between recognition of excess or disproportionality and internalising appraisals compared with externalising appraisals. Further, it has been found that a good understanding of the nature and cause of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (i.e., symptom coherence) is associated with internal attributions, but not with external, environmental attributions (Pedley et al., 2019). Based on this, we likewise expect individuals with  higher  levels  of  symptom  coherence  for  misophonic symptoms  to  be  less  likely  to  blame  themselves,  and  instead understand that the source of the problem is not the individual, but the condition of misophonia itself. Thus, a negative correlation is expected  between  misophonic  symptom  coherence  and internalising  appraisals  and  a  less  negative  or  non-significant correlation with external appraisals.

Another  characteristic  of  internal  attribution  is  that  it  is strongly associated with depression, distress and daily impact, whereas external attribution has been shown to be less strongly associated (e.g., Peterson et al., 1981; Hu et al., 2015), which has also  been  shown  for  misophonia  (Vitoratou  et  al.,  2021b). We  therefore  expect  strong  associations  to  emerge  between misophonic  distress  symptoms  and  functional  impact  with internal appraisals, but substantially less with external appraisals.

Finally, regarding the relationship with misophonia-specific aggression  (outbursts),  the  original  validation  of  the  S-Five (Vitoratou  et  al.,  2021b)  found  that  the  outbursts  factor  was moderately correlated with internalising and externalising appraisals. Surprisingly, outbursts were more strongly correlated with internalising than with externalising appraisals and both appraisal factors had low positive correlations with anger reactions to  trigger  sounds.  While  other  research  indicates  that  anger, aggression, and aggressive behavior are more frequent in those who blame others than themselves for their reactions (e.g., Averill, 1983; Quigley and Tedeschi, 1996), this appears to be have been the case with misophonia (Vitoratou et al., 2021b). We anticipate that both types of appraisals will be associated with higher levels of  anger,  aggression,  behavioral  dysregulation,  and  outbursts. Since irritability shares common emotional characteristics with anger and aggression (e.g., Stringaris, 2011) we assume it will also be associated with internalising and externalising appraisals.

## Misophonic emotional experiences

Misophonia can cause a strong physical reaction (Edelstein et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2017), which is most strongly associated with emotional reactions (Rosenthal et al., 2021). Accordingly, strong correlations between emotional misophonic responses (i.e., anger, aggression, irritability, disgust, and anxiety) and physical symptoms  are assumed. Whilst anxiety may  co-occur in misophonia, it is different in the psychological process compared to other emotional reactions (i.e., anger, aggression, irritability, and disgust).  Anxiety  is  a  rather  anticipatory  emotion  caused  by perceived threat whereas anger and related emotions (aggression and irritability)  as  well  as  disgust  are  rather  reactive  emotions caused by violations of personal needs, integrity or boundaries. For misophonia, anger is the most prominent reactive emotion whereas anxiety, if present, is rather anticipatory (e.g., Jager et al., 2020). Since anxiety is different from other emotional reactions in some features and does not necessarily need to co-occur, it is assumed to correlate lower (but still moderately) with other emotional reactions.

## Misophonia-specific dysregulation

As  experiencing  anger,  aggression  and  irritability  when confronted with sounds might manifest in behavioral dysregulation such  as  aggressive  outbursts  (e.g.,  Swedo  et  al.,  2022),  these symptoms  are  particularly  expected  to  correlate.  Likewise, behavioral dysregulation and outbursts are likely to be related to functional impact, with this behavior naturally contributing to social conflicts and negative consequences in daily life (Wu et al., 2014). It is further hypothesized that emotional dysregulation is

linked to the concept of threat as measured by the S-Five, which includes experiences of feeling trapped and  helpless (i.e., expressions of dysregulated threatening emotions). Experiencing threat  is  conceptually  and  empirically  related  to  anxiety  and heightened autonomic arousal (i.e., physical symptoms; Vitoratou et al., 2021b) and therefore expected to be associated with anxiety and physical symptoms. Moreover, threat entails aspects of failed avoidance strategies in the sense that threat emerges when triggers cannot be avoided. We expect that experiencing threat motivates increased avoidance behavior in order to circumvent the feared consequences  of  being  triggered.  Thus,  positive  associations between threat, anxiety and avoidance strategies are expected. Threat  has  further  been  shown  to  be  strongly  correlated  with functional impact (Vitoratou et al., 2021b) and is likewise expected to cause significant distress in individuals' lives.

## Misophonic avoidance

Experiencing threat and anxiety is generally associated with pronounced avoidance behavior causing significant distress and social  isolation  (Abramowitz  et  al.,  2019).  Considering  the frequent  reports  of  both  anxiety  and  avoidance  behavior  in misophonia (Wu et al., 2014; Jager et al., 2020; Swedo et al., 2022), we assume that perceived threat, anxiety and avoidance behavior will be strongly correlated. Avoidance behavior can also contribute to the maintenance of symptoms (e.g., Spinhoven et al., 2017) and poor treatment outcomes, thus elevating symptom burden (e.g., Wheaton et al., 2018). Hence, we assume strong associations with functional impact.

## Misophonic impairment

Most of the associations for symptoms from this domain have already been described in the previous sections. In summary, all misophonic symptoms being measured by the S-Five except for impact  (i.e.,  externalising  appraisals,  internalising  appraisal, outbursts  and  threat)  are  expected  to  highly  correlate  with symptoms from the domain misophonic impairment.

## Associations  with  symptoms  of other  mental  disorders  and  traits

To  further  explore  the  extension  of  the  nomological network, we also investigated associations between the S-Five and S-Five-T scores with related psychological constructs. In particular, anxiety sensitivity, which is a relatively stable trait fear  of  arousal-related  sensations  (Hovenkamp-Hermelink et  al.,  2019),  has  been  shown  to  be  related  to  misophonic symptoms (Cusack et al., 2018; McKay et al., 2018; Schadegg et al., 2021).  Higher  anxiety  sensitivity  was  found  to strengthen the relationship between misophonia and aggression (Schadegg et al., 2021). Cusack et al. (2018) found that the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and misophonia was partially mediated by obsessive-compulsive symptoms.  An  association  between  obsessive-compulsive symptoms and misophonia has also been reported elsewhere (Wu et al.,  2014;  Erfanian  et  al.,  2019;  Jager  et  al.,  2020). Misophonia has been associated with symptoms of depression (Erfanian et al., 2019), particularly in relation to internalising appraisals and impact (Vitoratou et al., 2021b). This fits with the notion that internal attributional appraisals are strongly associated  with  depression  and  distress  (Hu  et  al.,  2015). Therefore, we assume high correlations between internalising appraisals and  impact,  and  depressive  symptoms.  The associations between anxiety sensitivity, obsessivecompulsive symptoms and misophonic symptoms are exploratory because the associations with misophonia have only been shown for overall misophonic symptoms. However, experiencing  threat  when  confronted  with  sounds  entails aspects of anxiety and heightened arousal (see Misophoniaspecific dysregulation), so it is likely that threat is associated with higher levels of anxiety sensitivity.

## Hypotheses

We expect to find equivalent psychometric properties for the  German  S-Five  compared  with  the  original  version. Specifically, we hypothesize configural invariance between German-speaking and English-speaking populations, high internal  reliability  and  high  stability  in  time  (&gt;0.75  in agreement coefficients). We further expect to find similar intercorrelations between symptoms measured by the S-Five compared to the original validation study (Vitoratou et al., 2021b),  which  are  outlined  in  Table  1.  In  relation  to  the nomological  network,  we  outlined  our  hypotheses  in  the preceding section and summarize them in Table 2.

## Aims

## Materials  and  methods

The study has five specific aims:

- 1. Provide a rigorous German translation of the S-Five and S-Five-T instruments.
- 2. Replicate the results from the original S-Five in German.
- 3. Scrutinize the psychometric properties of the scales (i.e., internal  consistency,  model-based  reliability,  and  testretest reliability as well as evidence on construct validity including the factorial structure).
- 4.  Utilize the S-Five to investigate an associational network of misophonic symptoms to demonstrate evidence for the construct-valid  measurement of misophonic symptoms using the S-Five.
- 5. Provide  a  structural  and  theoretical  basis  for  further explorations of misophonic symptoms and their associations through a nomological network.

## Study overview

Two studies were conducted. The first study was part of a larger validation study that investigated a nomological network for misophonia using the responses to the 25-items of the S-Five and to the items of a new diagnostical instrument for misophonia, the Berlin  Misophonia  Questionnaire  (BMQ-R;  Remmert  et  al., 2022). The purpose of the second study was to provide a (partial) replication of study 1, to include the S-Five-T measure, to evaluate the stability of the German versions of the S-Five and S-Five-T, and to extend the nomological network.

## Participants

For both studies, individuals at least aged 16 or older were included  in  the  analyses.  Further  eligibility  criteria  were  not

having  been  diagnosed  with  a  severe  learning  disability  or intellectual disability and having sufficient self-reported German language  skills for answering  the  survey.  Data  protection guidelines  were  met  and  participants  gave  informed  consent before completing the surveys. The studies were approved by the Ethics Committee at the Department of Education and Psychology of  the  Freie  Universität  Berlin,  Germany  (document  number: 029/2020) and by the PNM Research Ethics Panel, King's College London (RESCM-19/20-11,826).

In study 1, we further administered items assessing participants' attention in line with DeSimone et al. (2015) and chose 80% correct answers as an inclusion cut-off. To check for aberrant response behavior we calculated a response pattern index as proposed by Meade and Craig (2012) excluding participants with more than 30% consecutive equal answers. The first study aimed at the evaluation of the dimensionality of the S-Five. Forero et al. (2009) suggested a sample size of N &gt;  200-500 for using latent trait  models  for  ordinal  data  using  the  WLSMV  estimator. We collected data from 952 individuals, of which N =  639 (67.12%) completed the S-Five and met the inclusion criteria. For study 2, we recruited 322 participants, of which N =  235 (73.0%) met the inclusion criteria and completed at least the S-Five. The second study focused on the translation of the S-Five-T complementary trigger checklist along with providing a confirmation dataset for the factor structure of the S-Five scale and evaluating stability.

Both studies were conducted using social media platforms in Germany (e.g., Facebook and Instagram) as well as university mailing  lists.  Groups  with  individuals  identifying  as  having misophonia as well as unspecific recruitment groups and groups with individuals suffering from any form of impaired hearing or disorders related to hearing (e.g., tinnitus, hyperacusis, etc.) were included in the sampling frame. The recruitment language was German. As an incentive participants could participate in a lucky draw for 10 × 5 Euro Amazon voucher and psychology students received  course  credit.  In  the  second  study  motivation  was provided  in  terms  of  a  lucky  draw  for  25  ×  20  Euro  amazon vouchers. A test-retest study was conducted two to 4 weeks later.

## Translation procedure

The translations of the scales from their respective language (i.e., Polish or English) to German was conducted by applying the TRAPD procedure (Harkness, 2003). TRAPD is an acronym for the following steps ensuring the quality of questionnaire translation:  translation,  review,  adjudication,  pretesting,  and documentation. Two translators, who are fluent or native speakers of the respective languages, independently translated the items of each  scale.  The  translated  items  were  then  reviewed  with  the translators and authors of the study (three of whom are German native speaker and fluent in English). Objects of the review were content, wording, and authenticity (i.e., evaluation of how natural or native the translation is) of the items. In this part, alterations of items were implemented if indicated.

## Measures

All measures are described in detail below. For both studies, three scales measuring aspects of misophonia were administered: S-Five, BMQ-R, and MisoQuest.

For study 1, non-misophonia specific scales were administered, each with its instructions contextualized for the respondent  to  answer  in  relation  to  misophonia.  At  the beginning of the study, participants were asked to think about the sounds that bothered them most or, if not applicable, about typical  misophonic  sounds  (i.e.,  eating,  swallowing,  and sniffing) and were instructed to consider either the presence or impact of those sounds in relation to each scale. For instance, we  added  the  accessory  sentence:  '[…]  when  you  are confronted with bothersome sounds.' This procedure aimed at minimizing  between-person  variability  and  within-person inconsistency due to thinking about different contexts when giving a response and thus aimed at increasing validity (cf. Lievens et al., 2008). The scales contextualized for misophonic sounds in study 1 were the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), Brief Irritability Test (BITe), State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive  and  Somatic  Anxiety  (STICSA),  Difficulties  in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Noise Avoidance Questionnaire (NAQ), Brief Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire (BEAQ), World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0), Illness Perception Questionnaire Mental Health (IPQ-MH). Note that items from each instrument were administered randomly in blocks. For the BMQ-R, items from each symptom area were presented in randomized blocks (see Remmert et al., 2022).

For study 2, non-misophonia-specific  scales were not contextualized for misophonia, because we aimed at investigating associations with adjacent clinical constructs not only limited to misophonic  contexts.  Further,  the  three  constructs  are  not described as misophonic symptoms, so it is not reasonable to contextualize them accordingly. These were the Anxiety Sensitivity Index 3 (ASI-3), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DOCS). Additionally, the S-Five-T was included in study 2, but not in study 1. For the S-Five, the order of questions (five S-Five items per question), and the order of item presentation in each question were randomized. Answering  the  S-Five-T  trigger  checklist  was  optional  and participants were given the opportunity to skip to the following section  after  each  trigger  sound  presented.  This  was  done  to minimize the potential distress and discomfort experienced when reading about misophonic triggers. Moreover, participants were randomly evenly allocated to either the BMQ-R or MisoQuest. The order of presentation for the BMQ-R items was randomized, as well as the order of the PHQ-9, DOCS, and ASI-3 thereafter. The three non-misophonia scales were optional. The links for the test-retest were sent out two to 4 weeks after initial participation in the survey. The follow-up survey contained the S-Five, S-Five-T, and  basic  demographic  data  such  as  a  unique  participant identification number and age.

## Measures of misophonia

The  Selective  Sound  Sensitivity  Syndrome  Scale  (S-Five; Vitoratou et al.,  2021b)  is  a  self-report  instrument  measuring misophonic symptoms which consists of 25 items corresponding to five subscales: internalising appraisals, externalising appraisals, perceived threat, outbursts, and impact. Items are rated on an 11-point rating scale (0 = not at all true to 10 = completely true). A supplementary  trigger  checklist,  the  S-Five-T,  consists  of  37 misophonic triggers and both the emotional response (e.g., anger and disgust) and the intensity (from 0 to 10) of the response to triggers. Three indices can be derived: Trigger Count (i.e., number of triggers; TC), Frequency/Intensity of Reactions Score (i.e., total value  of  the  intensity  of  triggers;  FIRS),  Relative  Intensity  of Reactions Score (i.e., intensity of reactions relative to the number of triggers; RIRS). The German and English S-Five can be found in the Supplementary material.

The  Berlin Misophonia  Questionnaire  Revised  (BMQ-R; Remmert et al., 2022) is a multidimensional diagnostical instrument for measuring misophonic symptoms. It consists of 15 symptomoriented scales (excluding scales on anticipated reactions to sounds) which can be assigned to their corresponding diagnostic criteria by Jager et al. (2020). The scales have been shown to be reliable with McDonald's ω ranging from.72 to.94. Results from latent variable models as well as correlations with convergent and discriminant measures give substantive evidence regarding construct validity. In total, 67 items were used, which are rated on a 6-point rating scale (0  =  does not apply at all to 5  =  completely applies).

MisoQuest 1 (Siepsiak et al., 2020) is a unidimensional selfreport instrument of misophonia with 14 items, rated on a 5-point Likert  scale  (1 = strongly  disagree  to  5 = strongly  agree).  The instrument was translated from Polish into German.

## Emotion states and dispositions

The Aggression Questionnaire (AQ; Buss and Perry, 1992) comprises four dimensions: (1) physical aggression, (2) verbal aggression, (3) anger and (4) hostility with 29 items being rated on a 4-point rating scale (1 = does not apply to 4 = fully applies). We used the German version of the Aggression Questionnaire (Werner and von Collani, 2004)  in an optimized version for the 2 measurement of misophonia (see Remmert et al., 2022).

The  Disgust  Propensity  and  Sensitivity Scale Revised 3 (DPSS-R;  Cavanagh  and  Davey,  2000)  reduced-item  version (Fergus and Valentiner, 2009), is a measure of disgust encompassing  the  dimensions  disgust  propensity  and  disgust sensitivity.  The  items  measure  the  frequency  of  physical  and emotional  symptoms of disgust  which  are  rated  on  a  5-point rating  scale  (1 = never  to  5 = always).  For  this  study,  only  the disgust  propensity  (DP)  items  were  used  (six  items),  which

measure how easily an individual is repulsed. The instrument was translated from English into German.

The State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety 3 (STICSA; Ree et al., 2008) measures dimensions of state and trait anxiety. Only the two trait scales were used for the present study, which capture a predisposition to experience anxiety in response to  certain  types  of  stressors,  namely  cognitive  (10  items)  and somatic (11 items) stressors. The items are rated on a 4-point rating scale (1 = not at all to 4 = very much so). The instrument was translated  from  English  into  German  and  optimized  for  the measurement of misophonia (see Remmert et al., 2022).

The  Anxiety  Sensitivity  Index  (ASI-3;  Taylor  et  al.,  2007) consists of 18 items that assess anxiety sensitivity, that is fear of anxiety-related sensations. It consists of three subscales: physical, cognitive, and social concerns. Responses are given on a 5-point rating scale from 0 = do not agree at all to 4 = fully agree. The German version was developed by Kemper et al. (2011).

The Brief Irritability Test  (BITe; Holtzman et al., 2015) is a 4 5-item measure of irritability in the last 2 weeks. Items are rated on a 6-point rating scale (1 = never to 6 = always). We used the German version by Krey (2017).

The  Dimensional  Obsessive-Compulsive  Scale  (DOCS; Abramowitz  et  al.,  2010)  is  a  20-item  measure  of  obsessivecompulsive  disorder.  There  are  four  categories  of  concerns: contamination, responsibility for harm, unacceptable thoughts, and  'just  right'  concerns  (denoted  as  symmetry).  For  each category there are five questions (rated from 0 to 4), asking about time occupied, avoidance behaviors, associated distress, functional impairment, and resistance to obsessions and compulsions. The German version by Fink-Lamotte et al. (2020)  was used. 5

The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke et al., 2001) is a 9-item measure of symptoms of depression. Respondents answer how often they were bothered by each symptom in the past 2 weeks, on a 4-point rating scale from 0 = not at all to 3 = almost every day. We used the German version by Gräfe et al. (2004). 6

## Emotion regulation

The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz and Roemer, 2004) is a measure of emotion regulation which consists of six subscales. For this study, we chose the following three subscales: (1) impulse control difficulties, (2) difficulties engaging  in  goal-oriented  behavior,  and  (3)  limited  access  to emotion regulation. These subscales consist of 19 items in total, of which 15 were chosen regarding their content validity to match the intended validation purpose. The items are rated on a 5-point rating scale regarding the experienced frequency (1 = almost never (0-10%) to 5 = almost always (91-100%)). The German version by Gutzweiler and In-Albon (2018)  was used. 4

## Avoidance behavior

The  Noise  Avoidance  Questionnaire   (NAQ;  Bläsing  and 5 Kröner-Herwig,  2012)  is  a  German  self-report  instrument measuring sound avoidance in daily life. It comprises 25 items of which 10 items describe specific situations that might be avoided. The remaining 15 items refer to specific behaviors related to sound avoidance. The more behavior-oriented items were chosen which are rated on a 5-point rating scale (1 = never to 5 = very often/ always).  We  could  not  obtain  the  German  items,  so  that  the English items were translated. Since the statements are short and concise, we do not expect compromising effects due to translation, however, we optimized the item selection for the measurement of misophonia (see Remmert et al., 2022).

The  Brief  Experiential  Avoidance  Questionnaire  (BEAQ; Gámez et al., 2014) is a 15-item measure of avoidance behavior. For  this  study,  items  from  the  original  Behavioral  Avoidance subscale of the German version (Böge et al., 2020)  were relevant 7 as they reflect situational avoidance of physical distress. Items are rated on a 6-point rating scale (1 = strongly disagree to 6 = strongly agree).

## Impairment

The  World  Health  Organization  Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0   (WHODAS 2.0; Üstün et al., 2010) is a clinical 8 instrument based on the International Classification of Functioning,  Disability  and  Health  (ICF;  WHO,  2001)  which measures the impact of a given health condition in six domains of life: Cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities, and participation. Since mobility and self-care appear to be irrelevant for  misophonia,  these  domains  were  not  administered.  The German self-report 36-item version (27 items after discarding the two domains) was optimized for the measurement of misophonia (see Remmert et al., 2022). Items are rated regarding the extent of difficulty individuals have doing the presented activities using a 5-point rating scale (1 = none to 5 = extreme or cannot do).

## Clinical insight

Illness Perception Questionnaire Mental Health (IPQ-MH; Witteman  et  al.,  2011)  is  an  adapted  version  of  the  Illness Perception Questionnaire Revised (IPQ-R; Moss-Morris et al., 2002) measuring an individual's perception of their mental health problem. Only the coherence subscale (five items), measuring the extent of an individual's understanding of their mental health problem, was used for this study. The items are rated on a 5-point rating scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree), with a higher score indicating more symptom coherence. The German version of the IPQ-R  (Gaab et al., 2008) was used and adapted in 9 line with Witteman et al. (2011) by replacing the term 'illness' with

'problem' in each item. There was one item from the coherence subscale of the IPQ-R that was removed from the scale for the final version of the IPQ-MH ('the symptoms of my condition are puzzling to me'). We included it in our survey as it had appeared in the German version of the IPQ-R and after initial psychometric examination  showed  a  good  fit,  we  retained  the  item  in the measure.

## Statistical analyses

The  subscales  of  the  S-Five  were  jointly  modelled  in  a confirmatory factor analysis  (CFA)  according  to  the  specified measurement  model  by  Vitoratou  et  al.  (2021b).  Therefore, we specified a correlated first-order factor model. Measurement models of the validation instruments were specified according to the original factor structure, but sometimes with an optimized set of items which adequately fit the measurement of misophonia (see Remmert et al., 2022). For the DERS scales we specified an S·I-1 model  (Eid  et  al.,  2017)  with  one  item  as  the  reference  item (general dysregulation) and the other items as specific factors (dysregulation facets), which is different from the original. This procedure allows us to investigate associations of misophonic symptoms with general dysregulation and its facets rather than with the facets alone.

Non-normality and categorical indicators were taken into account  using  the  weighted  least  square  mean  and  variance adjusted (WLSMV; Muthén et al., 1997) estimator with ordered categories.  For  the  S-Five  (continuous  indicators)  we  used maximum  likelihood  estimation  with  robust  (Huber-White) standard errors (Huber, 1967; White, 1980). Item omissions were addressed using full information maximum likelihood estimates.

Model fit  was  evaluated  by  using  absolute  and  relative  fit indices. Namely, the exact relative χ 2 (that is the ratio of the χ 2 over the degrees of freedom) with values ranging from 2 (Hoelter, 1983; Ullman, 2001) to &lt; 5 (Wheaton et al., 1977; West et al., 2012) indicating adequate fit (Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003), the Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA) with values close to 0.06 indicating adequate fit (Hu and Bentler, 1999), the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) with values close to 0.08 indicating good fit (Hooper et al., 2008), McDonald's Centrality Index (Mc) close to 0.90 (Hu and Bentler, 1999); as well as Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) close to 0.97 (Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003). The Expected Cross Validation Index (ECVI) was used to compare non-nested models (Browne and Cudeck, 1989).

The  multiple  indicator  multiple  causes  model  (MIMIC; Joreskog and Goldberger, 1975; Muthén, 1979) was used to assess measurement invariance in relation to gender and age. An item was regarded as non-invariant when the effect of the exogenous variable (age or gender) on the item directly (hereafter direct effect or de) was statistically significant.

Internal consistency was estimated with model-based McDonald's ω (McDonald, 1999). The test-retest reliability was

evaluated using the intraclass correlations coefficient (ICC; Shrout and  Fleiss,  1979).  ICC  values  &gt;  0.75  are  interpreted  as  good reliability, according to Koo and Li (2016).

Correlations were interpreted in line with Cohen (1988); i.e., r =  |0.10|, r =  |0.30|, r =  |0.50| are considered weak, moderate and strong, respectively. Differences between  correlations were statistically compared using Fisher's z-test of dependent correlation or between an empirical and a hypothesized correlation (Fisher, 1956). We applied Bonferroni correction to significance-level α in order to address α -error inflation due to multiple testing (Bonferroni, 1936) and further decided to be as conservative  as  possible,  thus  correcting  for  all  calculated correlations per study. In study 1 we calculated 820 correlations and  therefore α =  0.00006  and  for  study  2  we  calculated  465 correlations and therefore α =  0.0001. Additionally, we corrected for hypothesized correlation comparisons. For the 17 comparisons in  study  1 α =  0.0029  and  for  the  17  comparisons  in  study  2 α =  0.0029. Ten comparisons between independent samples were tested using Fisher's z-test of correlations in two independent samples (Fisher, 1956) with a corrected α =  0.005. Note that due to dropouts (respectively pairwise complete analyses) the sample sizes of dependent comparisons between correlation may vary within both studies, so we always selected the smallest overlapping sample size and still counted all comparisons within each study to adjust alpha-inflation, which is the most conservative method. The statistical software of Stata 16 (StataCorp, 2019), Mplus 8 (Muthen  and  Muthén,  1998-2017),  and  the  'lavaan'  package (version 0.6-9; Rosseel, 2012) in R (R Core Team, 2017) were used to carry out the analysis.

## Results

## Descriptive indices

In  sample 1 with N =  639,  most  participants  (86.2%)  were female, and two individuals indicated non-binary gender. The mean  age  was  M = 34.28 years  (SD = 11.52,  range  16  to  69). Approximately one-third (32.7%) were students. Further, one-third of the sample had a university degree and 46.7% had at least a college entrance qualification. A majority had a partner or was married (65.1%), whereas 33.9% did not have a partner or was living separated. Almost a third of the sample (30.3%) was either part-time or marginally employed, 37.3% was full-time employed, and 13.3% unemployed. About half of the sample (47.5%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria by Jager et al. (2020) (with 24.6% having severe symptoms) as classified by the BMQ-R. 10 According to the

10 Fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria was determined by proving if each criterion is fulfilled. A criterion was considered as fulfilled if the mean of the respective symptom scale was greater than 3 (i.e., greater than the mean of the response scale, meaning self-reported approval of the items). For severe symptoms, the fulfillment cutoff was set to 4. Note that this

S-Five  total  score  cut-off  (i.e.,  total  score  of  87  or  higher; cf. Vitoratou et al., 2022a), more than half of the sample (57.4%) had significant misophonia.

In sample 2, with N =  235, the majority of participants was female (85.1%), with two participants identifying as non-binary. The mean age was 35.8 years (SD = 11.8, range 19 to 80). The majority of the sample (95.3%) reported living in Germany or another  German-speaking  country  (Germany  86.0%,  Austria 5.5%, Switzerland 3.0, 5.9% rest of world). In terms of educational attainments, 6.4% had up to high school, 47.7% reported having done  apprenticeships, 26.8%  undergraduate  degree, 14.5% postgraduate degree, and 4.7% doctoral or similar. Significant misophonia as indicated by the S-Five total cut-off was observed for 58.3% of the sample.

## Structural validity and measurement invariance

The five-factor correlated model showed adequate fit to the data in both the first [ χ 2 (265) = 850.93, p &lt;  0.001,  rel. χ 2 =  3.21, CFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.07 [0.06-0.07], SRMR = 0.05, Mc = 0.55, ECVI = 1.87] and the second sample [ χ 2 (265) = 452.15, p &lt;  0.001, rel. χ 2 =  1.71, CFI = 0.94,  TLI = 0.94,  RMSEA = 0.06 [0.05-0.06], SRMR = 0.05]. An outline of the estimated model in sample 1 is shown Figure 2.

Measurement invariance  was  explored  with  respect  to gender and age, each adjusted for the other and the levels of the five factors. In sample 1, five items were directly affected from age but with negligible effect sizes (INT01: de = -0.018, p = 0.017; INT02: de = -0.020, p = 0.005, INT04: de = 0.020, p = 0.042,  IMP03:  de = 0.032, p = 0.001,  IMP02:  de = 0.670, p = 0.017). Two items were also affected from gender adjusted for age and the five misophonic dimensions of the misophonic experience (INT05: de = 0.698, p = 0.001; OUT03 de = 0.670, p = 0.017), with however less than one unit of effect on a 0 to 10 scale. Similar results emerged in the second sample, with three  significant  effects  emerging  for  either  age  (INT02: de = -0.037, p = 0.002, INT04: de = -0.034, p = 0.007, OUT04: de = -0.032, p = 0.017) and  gender  (EXT01:  de = 1.001, p = 0.013;  IMP01:  de = 1.068, p = 0.002;  IMP03:  de = 1.588, p &lt; 0.001), with low magnitudes in either case.

An alternative bifactor S-1 model (Eid et al., 2017) was also  fitted  as  from  a  theoretical  perspective,  the  outburst factor comprises both verbally as well as physically aggressive behaviors.  The  bifactor  S-1  model  maintains  a  general outburst factor but takes the implied two-dimensionality of outbursts  into  account.  The  model  was  specified  with physically aggressive behavior as the reference facet (G-factor) and verbally aggressive behavior as the specific factor yielding

a model with good fit [ χ 2 (4) = 11.84, p &lt; 0.05, rel. χ 2 = 2.96, CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.07 [0.03-0.12], SRMR = 0.02, Mc = 0.99, ECVI = 0.08]. Likewise, an adapted five-factor correlated model integrating the presented bifactor S-1 approach for the factor outbursts demonstrated good fit [ χ 2 (259) = 714.73, p &lt; 0.001, rel. χ 2 = 2.76, CFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.95, RMSEA = 0.06 [0.05-0.06], SRMR = 0.05, Mc = 0.63, ECVI = 1.63]. Model comparison using a likelihood ratio test yielded a significantly better model fit of the bifactor S-1 model [ Δχ 2 (6) = 115.29, p &lt; 0.001, Δ CFI = 0.01, Δ RMSEA = 0.01]. For an outline of the alternative bifactor S-1 model see Figure 3.

## Internal consistency and intercorrelations of the S-Five

In both samples, the estimated internal consistencies of the factors were good to excellent, according to McDonald's

ω ( ω ranged from 0.86 to 0.93; see Table 3). Descriptively, we found similar internal consistencies compared with the original validation study, except for impact and perceived threat, which were found to be slightly higher in our studies. In Study 1, the factor intercorrelations ranged from r = 0.40 to r = 0.72 with threat and impact being highest correlated (Table 1). Similarly, in study 2 the factor intercorrelations ranged from   = 0.51 to   = 0.79, with threat and impact again r r being  most  strongly  correlated.  All  intercorrelations  are significantly  higher  than  in  the  original  validation  study ( p &lt; 0.005 for all comparisons), but we found almost the same correlational  pattern.  An  exception  was  perceived  threat which was comparably higher correlated with internalising appraisals and outbursts than other factors were correlated with internalising appraisals and outbursts. This aligns with the fact that perceived threat and outbursts were in general unproportionally highly correlated with other factors when compared  to  the  original  validation  study  (differences between 0.16 and 0.36).

M = mean, SD = standard deviation; Min = scale minimum, Max = scale maximum; N =  633-636 (Study 1); N =  235 (Study 2). Means were calculated for manifest sum scores of the respective scale.

## Test-retest reliability (study 2)

The S-Five items and scores all showed excellent agreement across the test and retest ( N =  52), with ICC ≥ 0.86 in all cases and ICC = 0.90 for the total S-Five score. Similarly for the S-Five-T trigger scores, agreement was excellent with ICC ≥ 0.84 in all cases and ICC = 0.90 for the TC, FIRS, and RIRS.

## Nomological network of misophonic symptoms: Construct validity

In  this section, we  report  results  regarding  the  proposed nomological network of misophonic symptoms for each symptom domain. In each section, we first describe associations within the respective symptom domain followed by associations between different domains and associations with symptoms of other mental disorders and traits. W e additionally report associations between misophonic trigger  scores  and  between  S-Five  scales  and  overall  misophonic symptoms at the end of this section. An updated version of Figure 1 depicting the empirical nomological network can be found in Figure 4.

## Misophonic appraisals

Internalising and externalising appraisals were moderately to highly positively correlated (Table 3). For internalising appraisals, the correlations with recognition of disproportionality and excess were  higher  than  the  moderate  correlations  emerging  with externalising  appraisals  ( p &lt;  0.0029 for  all four  comparisons; Table 4). Coherence of misophonic symptoms (IPQ-MH), i.e., the level of comprehension regarding misophonic symptoms, moderately  negatively  correlated  with  internalising  appraisals, whereas externalising appraisals were not significantly associated with symptom coherence and were further less negatively correlated compared to internalising appraisals ( p &lt;  0.0029; T able 5).

externalising  appraisals,  except  for  hostility  and  internalising appraisals where we found a high correlation (Table 5). Irritability (BITe) emerged to correlate highly with both appraisal styles, however,  stronger  with  internalising appraisals ( p &lt;  0.0029; Table  5).  This  pattern  could  also  be  partly  shown  for  the association with behavioral dysregulation (BMQ-R; Table 4) in study  1  ( p &lt;  0.0029),  but  not  for  study  2  ( p =  0.013),  and  for outbursts in study 2 ( p &lt;  0.0029;  Table  3),  but  not  for  study  1 ( p =  0.014). However, for difficulties in impulse control (behavioral dysregulation; DERS) we found no correlations with misophonic appraisal styles (Table 5). We further found associations between internalising and externalising appraisals and functional impairment in different life domains: social interactions, participation in society, cognition, daily routines, and household (WHODAS  2.0;  Table  5).  Internalising  appraisals  were  most strongly correlated with impairment in social interaction, society and cognition, whereas externalising appraisals were significantly lower but still moderately correlated with impairment in different life  domains ( p &lt;  0.0029),  except for impairment in household ( p =  0.0170) and impairment in daily routine ( p =  0.004). Further, misophonic distress and functional impairment (BMQ-R) were strongly correlated with internalising appraisals, but relatively lower with externalising appraisals in study 1 ( p &lt;  0.0029; Table 4), but  not  for  study  2  ( p =  0.054 and p =  0.455, respectively). We  further  found  lower  correlations  between  externalising appraisals and impact (S-Five) compared  to internalising appraisals in study 1 ( p &lt;  0.001), but not for study 2 ( p =  0.146).

For both externalising and internalising appraisals, we found strong positive correlations with anger and irritation reactions in both samples (Table 4). Hostility, verbal and physical aggression, all of which are part of the definition of aggression (AQ), were found to be mainly moderately correlated with internalising and

Anxiety  sensitivity (ASI-3) moderately  correlated with internalising  appraisals  and;  Table  3  descriptively  lower  with externalising appraisals (Table 6). The highest correlation was found for the cognitive facet of anxiety sensitivity with internalising  appraisals,  whereas  the  lowest  (not  significant) correlation  emerged  between  the  physical  facet  of  anxiety sensitivity and  external  appraisals.  Notably,  the  obsessivecompulsive facets contamination and unacceptable thoughts of the DOCS were positively weakly to moderately correlated with both misophonic appraisal styles showing no descriptive difference  in  the  magnitude.  The  facets  responsibility  and symmetry  were  weakly  or  not  correlated  with  misophonic

appraisals.  Depressive  symptoms  (PHQ-9)  were  moderately correlated with both internalising and externalising appraisals, however,  not  significantly  lower  with  externalising  appraisals ( p =  0.176).

## Misophonic emotional experiences

As we did not assign any of the S-Five scales to the domain misophonic emotional experiences, we report results within this domain in a separate table (see Table 7).

All misophonic emotional reactions were highly correlated with physical symptoms (BMQ-R) except for verbal and physical aggression,  hostility  (AQ),  and  disgust  propensity  (DPSS-R), which were moderately correlated. We found high associations between anxiety and anger and irritation (BMQ-R) as well as between  cognitive  anxiety  symptoms  (STICSA)  and  anger, irritation (BMQ-R), and verbal aggression and hostility (AQ). Interestingly, cognitive anxiety (STICSA) was descriptively highest correlated  with  hostility  and  anger  (AQ).  Contrary  to  our prediction, anxiety was not always lower correlated with other emotional reactions than their respective intercorrelations. For example, anxiety and irritation (BMQ-R) correlated to r =  0.72, whereas  irritation  correlated  lower  with  anger  (AQ; r =  0.50; p &lt;  0.0029)  and  irritability  (BITe; r =  0.62; p &lt;  0.0029).  Another example is a similarly high correlation between anxiety and anger (BMQ-R) compared to the correlation between two measures of anger  (BMQ-R  and  AQ; r =  0.58; p =  0.062).  An  even  clearer

pattern emerges for the second study, where we only found a predicted  difference  between  the  association  of  anxiety  and disgust  (  = 0.53) r compared  to  disgust  and  anger  (  = 0.77; r p &lt;  0.0029). All other correlations were not significantly different ( p &gt;  0.0029 for all comparisons).

associations with avoidance behavior, we found high correlations between threat and reactive and anticipatory avoidance (BMQ-R), noise avoidance (NAQ), and behavioral avoidance (BEAQ).

## Misophonia-specific dysregulation

Outbursts (S-Five) and threat (S-Five) were highly correlated with behavioral dysregulation (BMQ-R)  in  both samples. Outbursts also correlated highly with threat in both samples and further significantly higher than in the original validation study ( p &lt;  0.001  for  both  comparisons).  Also,  general  dysregulation (DERS;  BMQ-R;  Tables  4  and  5)  was  highly  correlated  with outbursts  and  threat,  whereas  difficulties  in  impulse  control (behavioral  dysregulation;  DERS)  when  controlled  for  general dysregulation  was  not  significantly  correlated  with  any  S-Five measure (Table 5). As expected, emotional dysregulation (BMQ-R) was highly correlated with threat, but emotional dysregulation when  controlled  for  general  dysregulation  (DERS)  was  not significantly associated with threat. Notably, we also found a strong association between cognitive dysregulation (BMQ-R) and threat.

Besides correlations within the domain misophonia-specific dysregulation, threat was very strongly associated with misophonic anxiety  (BMQ-R)  as  well  as  cognitive  and  somatic  anxiety symptoms (STICSA). Likewise, physical misophonic symptoms were strongly associated with threat. In line with predictions about

Symptoms within the domain misophonic impairment were predominantly strongly associated with threat. For example, impact (S-Five)  as  well  as  distress  and  functional  impact  (BMQ-R) correlated strongly with threat in both samples (Table 4). Also, specifically impairment in society and social interaction (WHODAS 2.0) were strongly associated (Table 5), whereas impairment in cognition, daily routine and household were moderately correlated. Likewise,  strong  associations  between  outbursts  and  impact (S-Five),  functional  impact  and  distress  (BMQ-R),  as  well  as impairments in social interaction (WHODAS 2.0) were observed. Moderate associations emerged for outbursts and impairment in household, daily routine, and society (WHODAS 2.0).

Depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) were moderately associated with both threat and outbursts (Table 6). For anxiety sensitivity (ASI-3), we found low to moderate associations with threat and outbursts, descriptively being slightly higher for threat than for outbursts. Obsessive-compulsive thoughts (DOCS) were moderately associated with threat and outbursts, whereasother OCD symptoms were not significantly correlated.

Low to moderate correlations emerged with anxiety sensitivity (ASI-3),  depressive  symptoms  (PHQ-9), and some obsessivecompulsive traits: unacceptable thoughts and symmetry (DOCS), but not with contamination and responsibility (Table 6).

## Misophonic avoidance

All  avoidance  symptoms  were  highly  correlated  with threat and impact (S-Five). For example, reactive avoidance and anticipatory avoidance (BMQ-R) were highly correlated with threat and impact in both samples (Table 4).

Furthermore, noise avoidance (NAQ) and behavioral avoidance (BEAQ) were highly correlated with threat and impact. Descriptively, these correlations were higher than any other  correlation  between  avoidance  symptoms  and  other S-Five scales.

## Misophonic impairment

Most  predicted  associations  between  symptoms  from  the domain misophonic impairment and other misophonic symptoms have already been described in the preceding sections. Simply summarized,  all  S-Five  scales  were  expected  to  be  strongly associated with misophonic impairment symptoms. We found high correlations for all S-Five scales with functional impact and distress  (BMQ-R;  Table  4),  except  for  a  moderate  correlation between distress and externalising appraisals in the second study. Further, impairments in different life domains (WHODAS 2.0) were  moderately  to  strongly  associated  with  all  S-Five  scales. However,  impairments  in  household  (compared  to  other  life domains) emerged to correlate descriptively lower with all S-Five scales on average (see Table 5).

Impact was further moderately correlated with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), cognitive symptoms of anxiety sensitivity (ASI-3) and obsessive-compulsive thoughts (DOCS; see Table 6). Low correlations were observed for social and physical symptoms of anxiety sensitivity and  obsessive-compulsive symmetry symptoms.  Other  obsessive-compulsive  symptoms  were  not significantly correlated with impact.

## Associations with symptoms of other mental disorders and traits.

The correlations of the five reaction counts (irritation, distress, disgust,  anger,  panic,  physiological  response)  and  the  three S-Five-T indices (TC, FIRS, RIRS) with the S-Five factors, the BMQ-R, ASI-3 and DOCS scores are presented in Table 6.

The number of triggers (TC) selected from the 37 sounds list was strongly correlated with all S-Five dimensions ( r &gt;  0.50 in all cases). Correlations of similar magnitude emerged with the MisoQuest total score, the BMQ-R scales of misophonic anger, irritation, disgust, physical reactions, behavioral dysregulation, reactive avoidance, and functional impairment. The  strongest  correlation  emerged  with  misophonic  disgust reactions  and,  unexpectedly,  the  lowest  with  distress  (both BMQ-R). However, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) correlated moderately high. Low or non-significant coefficients emerged with  anxiety  sensitivity  (ASI-3)  and  obsessive-compulsive traits (DOCS).

For the FIRS index very strong correlations with the total S-Five, the total MisoQuest and the BMQ-R disgust reaction scale ( r &gt;  0.70) emerged.  Further,  all S-Five factors were  highly correlated with the FIRS index. Moderate to moderate high were also the correlations between FIRS and the rest of the BMQ-R subscales. Further, we observed moderately high correlations with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9). As in the case of the TC, low or non-significant coefficients emerged for most anxiety sensitivity (ASI-3), and most obsessive-compulsive traits (DOCS). However, moderate  correlations  were  observed  for  cognitive  anxiety sensitivity and unacceptable thoughts. Similar patterns emerged for the RIRS index, even though coefficients were descriptively somewhat smaller in all cases.

With respect to the reaction counts (RC), RC-Irritation did not show significant correlations with any of the scales.

RC-Distress was moderately to moderately low associated with most scales. The strongest correlations appeared between distress and the S-Five outburst factor and the total MisoQuest. Distress  was  not  found  to  be  significantly  correlated  with  all BMQ-R scales, with social anxiety sensitivity (ASI-3) and the DOCS scales. Interestingly, externalising appraisals was the only S-Five  subscale  which  was  not  significantly  correlated  with RC-distress.

RC-Disgust also did not relate with most of the subscales considered.  An  exception  was  the  moderate  correlation  with disgust reaction (BMQ-R).

On the contrary, RC-Anger was strongly related to all S-Five scores, MisoQuest, and all BMQ-R scores, with a lower correlation only  with  anticipatory  avoidance.  Non-significant  coefficients emerged between RC-Anger and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety sensitivity (ASI-3), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (DOCS).

Interestingly,  RC-Panic  did  not  correlate  with  the  S-Five externalising and internalising appraisals and outburst factor but correlated  moderately  with  threat  and  impact.  RC-Panic  also correlated moderately with the BMQ-R anxiety reaction scale while  moderately  low  correlations  emerged  with  the  BMQ-R scales of physical reactions, recognition of excess,  anticipatory avoidance, distress, and functional impairment, however, these associations were not significant when considering Bonferronicorrection. RC-Panic did not correlate with the other BMQ-R scales.  Low  but  non-significant  correlations  emerged  between RC-Panic and PHQ-9, all ASI-3 factors apart from the social factor, and with the DOCS thought factor.

Finally, the RC-Physiological did not correlate with the S-Five factors or the total MisoQuest. Moderate correlations emerged with the BMQ-R scales of physical and anxiety reactions, reactive and anticipatory avoidance, distress, and functional impairment, however, these associations were not significant when considering Bonferroni-correction.  Low  but  non-significant  correlations emerged between the RC-Physiological and the total PHQ-9, and the  contamination  scale  of  the  DOCS.  The  only  significant associations were found between RC-Physiological and the ASI-3 total as well as the ASI-3 cognitive and social subscale.

## Associations with overall misophonic symptoms (S-Five).

Overall misophonic symptoms (MisoQuest) strongly correlated with each of the S-Five subscales with externalising appraisals  being  lowest  correlated  and  threat  being  highest correlated (see Table 4). The scales were further strongly associated with general sound intolerance symptoms (BMQ-R;   &gt; 0.60). r

## Discussion

The presented studies aimed at providing a rigorous and valid German translation of the S-Five. We thus presented a thorough examination of the reliability and construct validity by specifying measurement models and introducing a nomological network which delineates associations between misophonic symptoms.

Our results demonstrate a good fit of the five-factor model to our data in both samples when using the translated S-Five items, emerging a similar fit to the English version ( cf. , Vitoratou et al., 2021b). However, some misspecifications were identified which need  further  investigation  in  future  studies.  We  therefore presented a promising, alternative model, which incorporates a bifactor S-1 measurement model for misophonic outbursts. This has three advantages: the model (a) fits better to the data (even when penalizing for more parameters), (b) provides a clearer interpretation of different aspects of outbursts, and (c) preserves a general outburst factor with a clearer interpretation. Besides the goodness  of  fit of the factorial structure, we  investigated measurement invariance  regarding  gender  and  age.  Based  on findings of minor effects, we conclude that the German S-Five items do not function differentially due to gender and age, and therefore structural differences of the scores can be assessed.

We also demonstrated excellent internal consistency in both samples and high test-retest reliability for the five factors. As an interim conclusion, these results reveal two main properties of the German S-Five: a) highly reliable measurement and b) factorial valid conclusions when applying these scales. Another striking result is the mostly replicated correlation pattern between S-Five factors with medium to strong intercorrelations. Unexpectedly, the factors were in general higher correlated than in the original validation study. Interestingly, threat is highly correlated with each of the four remaining factors, especially with impact. Further, threat  was  comparably  higher  correlated  with  internalising appraisals and outbursts than other factors. We argue that these are beneficial properties of the threat scale, however, users of the S-Five should keep the small differences in the correlative pattern in mind when administering the German version. Initial evidence on the construct validity was shown through high correlations with measures of overall misophonic symptoms, however, this does not allow to disentangle which misophonic symptoms are correlated with the S-Five scales. Therefore, we developed the nomological network of misophonic symptoms.

## Construct validity and the nomological network

To our knowledge this is the first study that begins to explore a formal and comprehensive nomological network for misophonic symptoms.  Recent  developments  of  misophonia  instruments, which  emphasize  a  more  symptom-oriented  measurement (Rosenthal et al., 2021; Remmert et al., 2022) and the German translation  of  the  S-Five  provide  the  basis  to  scrutinize  the proposed  nomological  network  with  five  broader  symptom domains, in which the symptoms are proposed to be clustered. These domains are misophonic appraisals, misophonic emotional experiences, misophonia-specific  dysregulation,  misophonic avoidance,  and  misophonic  impairment.  Our  aims  were  to explicitly  provide  evidence  for  the  construct  validity  of  the (translated)  S-Five  as  well  as  giving  a  deeper  insight  into  the associations of misophonic symptoms.

We  found  strong  evidence  for  the  construct  validity  of internalising  and  externalising  appraisals  in  the  misophonic appraisals domain. Internalising appraisals were strongly associated with the recognition of the excessive and disproportionate nature of  the  reactions  and  furthermore  higher  correlated  with  these dimensions of clinical insight than externalising appraisals. This aligns  with  similar  findings  from  other  mental  disorders  (e.g., Cotton et al., 2012; Didehbani et al., 2012).

Problem coherence, that is, having a good understanding of your problem, was negatively correlated with internalising appraisals, as expected.  We  had  also  expected  the  relative  difference  between internalising and externalising appraisals in their relationship with coherence (with externalising appraisals not being correlated) but had not anticipated these negative correlations across all factors. These relationships were in the opposite direction to those between the S-Five and variables about awareness of the disproportionate and excessive  nature  of  reactions,  indicating  that  awareness  of  these aspects  is  not  the  same  as  having  a  good  understanding  of  the problem.  So,  what  we  labelled  as  'insight'  on  the  nomological network is a reflection of awareness that misophonic symptoms are indeed a problem, but not necessarily insight into the problem. This finding was consistent with research finding that OCD severity is negatively associated with problem coherence (Pedley et al., 2019). Further research is needed to test possible explanations for this. Perhaps  the  simplest  understanding  of  this  relationship  is  that misophonia is easier to make sense of when it is less severe. It is also important to consider that there could be a causal relationship in the other direction. That is, it is possible that as one' s understanding of the problem of misophonia improves, their symptoms decrease. Lack of  an  explanation  for  the  problem  may  be,  in  fact,  part  of  the problem. Our cross-sectional correlative study does not allow us to draw  any  conclusions  about  causality.  Future  research  would therefore  benefit  from  testing  problem  coherence  as  a  potential mechanism of change for misophonia. This would make sense for internalising in particular, which is characterized by a felt sense that the  individual  with  misophonia  is  reacting  this  way  to  sounds because of some deeper character flaw, being a bad or angry person underneath. It thus makes sense that as one comes to understand a theory that misophonia is a decreased sensory tolerance problem shared by many and shaped by our experiences, that their previous theory of 'bad character' loses its credibility.

Besides associations within the domain misophonic appraisal, we also found evidence for construct validity through associations between internalising and externalising appraisals with symptoms from other domains. For example, we found that both appraisal styles were at least moderately associated to anger, aggression, irritability, and behavioral dysregulation and outbursts, which is in line with previous findings on these appraisal styles (Vitoratou et al., 2021b). Considering general psychological theories of appraisals and their associations with anger and related constructs (e.g., Averill, 1983) it is a rather contradicting result, but there seems to be a difference for misophonia, which has been replicated in our studies. Further studies should consider investigating the role of appraisals for experiencing misophonic anger, aggression, and potential outbursts. An unpredicted  result  was  the  non-significant  correlation  between difficulties in impulse  control  (behavioral  dysregulation)  and appraisals, which does not support our hypotheses on appraisals. Note that we also found mixed results for comparing associations of externalising and  internalising appraisals with outbursts and behavioral dysregulation, which do neither support equally high associations  nor  higher  associations  with  either  appraisal  style. Further research should investigate these relationships in depth.

Lastly,  we  observed  medium  to  strong  associations  with different symptoms from the domain misophonic impairment, which were almost all higher for internalising appraisals than for externalising appraisals. Only the association between the S-Five scale impact was equally high for internalising and externalising appraisals in our second study, which contradicted our hypotheses on the associations with impact. Furthermore, we found depressive symptoms to be equally moderately correlated with both appraisal styles. Thus, our results show evidence that both appraisal styles might be associated with impact on lives of affected individuals as well as with respective depressive symptoms. We strongly suggest investigating  how  both  appraisal  styles  are  associated  with misophonic impairment exploring possible explanatory variables.

Within the  domain  of  misophonic  emotional  experiences we  found  strong  evidence  for  our  hypothesis  that  physical symptoms  of  misophonia  are  strongly  associated  with  all emotional symptoms, which again replicates the results from past studies  (e.g.,  Rosenthal  et  al.,  2021).  While  we  found  strong associations between explicitly convergent measures of the same emotional  reaction,  we  found  strong  evidence  against  our hypothesis that anxiety is differently related to other misophonic emotional reactions. Especially in the second study almost all associations between anger, irritation, disgust and anxiety were as high  as  the  associations  among  anger,  irritation  and  disgust, respectively. Mind that due to the small sample size in study 2, interpretations should be made cautiously. However, the findings of study 1 also support the conclusion that anxiety is not weaker associated with all other emotional reactions. Although Jager et al. (2020)  see  anxiety  reactions  as  a  subordinate  misophonic symptom,  others  have  pointed  out  that  anxiety  is  a  crucial symptom (e.g., Swedo et al., 2022). Our findings give further evidence  that  anxiety  is  strongly  related  to  other  emotional reactions  and  hence  a  paramount  emotional  symptom  to be considered when investigating misophonia.

For  the  validation  of  the  S-Five  the  domain  misophoniaspecific dysregulation plays a particularly important role since two scales  were  assigned  to  this  domain:  outbursts  and  perceived threat. As expected, outbursts and threat were strongly associated not only among each other but with different facets of misophoniaspecific dysregulation. Outbursts were predominantly strongly related to convergent measures of behavioral dysregulation and threat was strongly related to emotional dysregulation. We further found strong associations with threat and anxiety and physical symptoms, which replicate findings from the original validation study (Vitoratou et al., 2021b). Both threat and outbursts were expectedly strongly associated with symptoms from misophonic impairment,  especially  with  functional  impact,  distress,  and impairment in social interaction.

Interestingly, we found an exploratory association of threat with symptom coherence. Regarding the possible impact of lack of coherence  on  an  increased  sense  of  emotional  threat,  which includes feelings of being trapped, helpless and distress, it also makes sense that one might experience a greater sense of these in a moment where their initial reactions do not make sense to them,

thus compounding the overall reaction. This theory would provide support for the S-Five concept of threat to fall within the domain of dysregulation rather than affectivity. Our assumption was that threat would show stronger associations with anxiety. However, not only anxiety but other emotional reaction correlated strongly with threat,  too.  Additionally,  threat  was  strongly  correlated  with emotional and cognitive dysregulation, and moderately associated with  general  and  behavioral  dysregulation  and  both  types  of avoidance. While the term 'threat' may denote a sense of fear, these results indicate that it is not an anxiety response, but rather a more complex emotional and cognitive experience. We propose that the sense of emotional threat comes from a combination of the initial emotional reaction, compounded by a lack of understanding of the problem, and a sense of not being able to cope (dysregulation) in that moment, resulting in a feeling of being trapped, panicked and helpless  if  unable  to  get  away  from  the  situation.  This  could be explored further in qualitative studies seeking to understand the complexity of what is happening in these moments.

As expected, there were also strong associations for threat with avoidance. Future experimental research would be helpful to determine whether avoidance plays a maintaining role in the sense of threat experienced  by  those  with  misophonia.  Further, symptoms of avoidance were strongly associated with the S-Five scale impact. Future studies could investigate how avoidance and coping strategies are related to impairment.

The domain misophonic impairment has been shown to be a crucial domain insofar that symptoms from this domain, and especially  impact  as  measured  by  the  S-Five,  were  highly correlated with symptoms from all other domains. Further, all scales  from  the  S-Five  were  highly  associated  with  impact. Although impact plays an important role in the nomological network because it  is  related  to  a  wide  range  of  misophonic symptoms, future studies should investigate the causes of impact. This study provides a basis to select variables that have been shown to be strongly associated. With regard to the S-Five-T reactions,  we  found  that  misophonia  severity  was  strongly associated with the number of times anger was reported as a primary reaction to triggers, supporting the frequent reporting of  anger  as  the  predominant  response  in  misophonia  (Brout et al., 2018; Jager et al., 2020), at least with regard to the primary reaction to trigger sounds. Reports of panic as a primary reaction were  also associated with misophonia  severity, which  is supported  by  the  findings  of  Vitoratou  et  al.  (2021b),  but  is contrary to the suggestion by Jager et al. (2020) that anxiety and panic should not be considered a primary reaction in misophonia.

It was interesting to note that the count of physiological reaction was not associated with overall misophonia severity but  was  associated  with  anxiety  sensitivity.  One  possible explanation for this is that the physiological reaction reported in misophonia (Edelstein et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2017) may be mostly a physical manifestation of emotions. While there may be some individuals who experience only a physiological reaction, it's also possible that some report it as physiological if  they  are  not  able  to  identify  or  label  specific  emotions, especially if they show high traits of anxiety sensitivity, which measure fear of anxiety symptoms. Further in-depth investigation is needed to understand this better.

We found that the reaction count of irritation as a primary reaction to sounds was not associated with misophonia severity, nor any of the related scales. However, the S-Five factors were all positively associated with the BMQ-R measure of irritation and irritability more generally. This supports the notion proposed by Vitoratou et al. (2021b), that while irritation may be part of the experience of misophonia, if someone reports that irritation is their most  frequent  response  to  trigger  sounds,  that  is  likely  not indicative of the disorder of misophonia, and in fact represents a typical  response  to  unpleasant  sounds  reported  in  the  general population (Vitoratou et al., 2022a). Finally, we looked at the S-Five in relation to symptoms of depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In line with previous studies, misophonia severity was associated with symptoms of depression (Wu et al., 2014; Erfanian et al., 2019; Jager et al., 2020), particularly with regards to threat and  impact  (Vitoratou  et  al.,  2021b).  Threat  was  moderately associated with anxiety sensitivity, which  warrants  further investigation to expand on previous work examining misophonia and anxiety sensitivity (Cusack et al., 2018; McKay et al., 2018; Schadegg et al., 2021). In line with previous research (Cusack et al., 2018; McKay et al., 2018), symptoms of misophonia were associated with  some  aspects  of  OCD  symptoms  but  not  others,  with moderate  correlations  with  unacceptable  thoughts  and  low correlations with symmetry. This adds to growing evidence that misophonia is not specifically part of obsessive-compulsive and related  disorders  (McKay  et  al.,  2018).  Further  research  could investigate overlapping transdiagnostic mechanisms, for example intrusive thoughts and urges in misophonia and potential related beliefs around the likelihood of acting on those intrusions.

Overall, the results have shown that symptoms measured by the  S-Five  fit  well  in  the  proposed  nomological  network  of misophonic symptoms, which provides strong evidence for the construct validity of the (German) S-Five. The studies have also replicated past results from studies with the S-Five and revealed unknown  exploratory  associations  of  the  S-Five  scales  with misophonic symptoms and symptoms of other mental disorders.

We hope that the proposed nomological network is understood as a first attempt to formalize further investigations of misophonic symptoms and thus provide a structural and theoretical basis. Furthermore, this article aims to raise awareness of a symptomoriented approach to investigate misophonia and thus help readers and future research to understand associations between misophonic symptoms and how to disentangle and explain them.

## Limitations

Although two large and independent samples were drawn, we did not implement a random sampling scheme. Our samples were drawn from social media which is why our results are not representative for the German population (e.g., more women, more highly educated, younger individuals were sampled) and are therefore biased and difficult to generalize. However, as we aimed

at gathering data mainly from affected individuals, there is no alternative  random  sampling  strategy  applicable.  We  suggest administering the German S-Five in a large representative sample to assess the psychometric properties for the German population without sampling bias. Also note that for some of the analyses in study 2, the sample sizes were rather small ( N =  76-155), which should be considered in the interpretation of results. We hence strongly recommend interpreting results, which stem from these smaller samples, with caution and replicating them.

The surveys lasted more than 40 min on average which might have caused exhaustion and higher dropout rates, but we  implemented  a  rigorous  data  quality  assessment  which certainly minimized this issue. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee unbiased estimates due to systematic missing responses or exhaustion.

A methodological issue limiting the scope of our results is the exclusive administration of questionnaires. Podsakoff et al. (2003) demonstrated artificially increasing correlations due to shared method-specific variance. We therefore suggest an extension of the study using different measurement methods (e.g., interviews and  behavioral  data).  Another  limitation  of  our  study  is  that we did not assess hyperacusis (i.e., a decreased sound tolerance condition related to misophonia, which is mainly characterized by aversive reactions to physical characteristics of sounds such as loudness; e.g., Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2014) as a measure of discriminant validity which should be addressed in follow-up studies.

Since  misophonia  is  still  a  relatively  little  investigated condition, we did not fulfill strong properties of a nomological network. Thus, a major weakness of our study is the network was based on observations from the misophonia and broader literature,  rather  than  being  derived  from  a  comprehensive theoretical framework, which does not yet exist for the etiology and maintenance of misophonia. Our observed associations therefore  need  to  be  further  corroborated.  The  proposed nomological network should be interpreted as a first attempt to formalize and disentangle associations between misophonic symptoms. This attempt is thus deemed to stimulate further development of a more rigorous and extended nomological network  in  future  research.  A  more  profound  nomological network for misophonia is dependent on substantiated theories on misophonic processes, requiring theoretical models with testable  hypotheses.  Our  study  provided  a  formalized  and reasonable  first approach  to  a  nomological  network  for misophonia,  one  which  will need to be further tested and refined.

## Conclusion

In summary, the presented nomological network overall clearly supports the validity of the German S-Five and gives comprehensive  insight  into  the  relationship  of  misophonic symptoms in general. The demonstrated measures to capture symptoms of misophonia have been shown to be psychometrically robust and allow for reliable and valid conclusions.
