## Neuroscience & Brain Research
- **Abnormal Brain Connectivity:** MRI studies at Newcastle University show abnormal connections in the frontal lobe and heightened activity in the anterior insular cortex in people with misophonia.  
  [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/articles/archive/2021/05/misophonia-asupersensitivebrainconnection/)
- **Mirror Neuron Hypothesis:** Dr. Sukhbinder Kumar’s research suggests that mimicry behaviors (copying trigger sounds) are common and may relieve distress in misophonia.  
  [Psychology Today, 2024](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/noises-off/202405/misophonia-research-takes-another-leap-forward)

## Genetics
- **Genetic Markers:** 23andMe identified genetic markers linked to misophonia risk in a study of 80,000+ people.  
  [23andMe White Paper](https://medical.23andme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Misophonia.pdf)

## Psychology & Mental Health
- **Mental Health Risks:** Adults with misophonia show higher rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. Females are at higher risk in their teens, males at age 24.  
  [University of Sussex, Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/noises-off/202405/misophonia-research-takes-another-leap-forward)
- **Daily Stress vs. Trauma:** Recent Duke studies show daily stress is a stronger predictor of misophonia severity than PTSD or trauma history.  
  [Psychology Today, 2024](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/noises-off/202412/new-studies-shed-light-on-misophonia)

## Therapy & Treatment
- **CBT Efficacy:** Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce misophonia symptoms and improve quality of life.  
  [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8475117/)
- **Unified Protocol:** Duke’s adaptation of the Unified Protocol (transdiagnostic psychotherapy) is effective and acceptable to patients.  
  [Psychology Today, 2024](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/noises-off/202412/new-studies-shed-light-on-misophonia)
- **Therapy Guidelines:** Exposure therapy is not recommended; therapists should tailor strategies and focus on emotional, cognitive, and neurological layers.  
  [Dr. Jane Gregory, Oxford, Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/noises-off/202405/misophonia-research-takes-another-leap-forward)

## Advocacy, Diagnosis & Community
- **ICD-11 Proposal:** Misophonia has been proposed as a new diagnostic code for international recognition.  
  [Duke Center for Misophonia and Emotion Regulation](https://psychiatry.duke.edu/duke-center-misophonia-and-emotion-regulation)
- **Awareness Initiatives:** Major efforts are underway to educate clinicians and the public, including training for 988 hotline staff and partnerships with advocates.  
  [Psychology Today, 2024](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/noises-off/202412/new-studies-shed-light-on-misophonia)

## Research Funding & Community
- **Misophonia Research Fund:** Over $10 million invested in new studies, including semantic sound suppression technology and lived experience research.  
  [Misophonia Research Fund](https://misophoniafund.org/)
- **soQuiet & Misophonia Association:** Ongoing research, grants, and published studies.
