Introduction : Prolonged exposure to noise environments can induce stress 
and fatigue, even impacting individuals’ physical and mental health. Conversely, 
positive soundscapes can have a beneficial impact on health by alleviating stress 
and fatigue, promoting psychological recovery. To assess the restorative potential 
of soundscapes, various scales have been developed to create environments 
conducive to recovery. However, current research on perceptual restorativeness 
soundscape scales primarily focuses on adults, lacking a dedicated scale for 
children to evaluate the restorative potential of their surrounding acoustic 
environments from their perspective.
Methods:  Therefore, this study introduces the development and validation 
process of the Perceived Restorativeness of Soundscapes Scale for Children 
(PRSS-C) using survey questionnaires and data statistical analysis.
Results:  The study comprises two experiments. Experiment one aims to develop 
an effective PRSS-C, evaluating the restorative potential of soundscapes in 
different environments (urban center, urban suburb, and urban peripheral forest) 
among 185 children aged 10-12. Through a series of analyses, a dual-factor 
structure scale consisting of 15 items is developed, revealing that the restorative 
potential of soundscapes is lower in urban centers than in urban suburbs and 
lower in urban suburbs than in urban peripheral forests. Experiment two aims 
to further validate the effectiveness of PRSS-C. 244 children aged 10-12 assess 
the restorative potential of soundscapes in similar environments (two city parks) 
using the PRSS-C developed in experiment one. Factor analysis confirms the 
dual-factor structure, with assessment results indicating that the restorative 
potential of soundscapes in Temple of Heaven Park is lower than in the National 
Botanical Garden. This suggests that PRSS-C enables children to differentiate 
the restorative potential of soundscapes in similar environments within the 
same city, further confirming its effectiveness.
Discussion:  This study successfully develops and validates the PRSS-C through 
two experiments. The use of this scale allows for the assessment of the 
restorative potential of acoustic environments surrounding children, providing 
an effective tool for evaluating and creating positive soundscapes for children.

Frontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org1 Introduction
Noise severely affects the physical and mental health of 
individuals. Prolonged exposure to noisy environments can cause 
serious damage to the auditory system ( Prell et al., 2012 ), nervous 
system ( Kabuto et al., 1993 ), cardiovascular system, and more ( Nawaz 
and Hasnain, 2010 ). It may even lead to adverse psychological 
reactions such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders ( Zhu and 
Jones, 2010 ; Lai et al., 2014 ). To address this issue, numerous measures 
have been established to assess people’s negative perceptions of sound 
(Berglund et al., 2000 ; Stansfeld et al., 2005 ; Maynard et al., 2009 ), 
including noise interference models ( Botteldooren et al., 2003 ) and 
noise disturbance surveys ( Fields et al., 2001 ). However, as an integral 
part of daily life, the acoustic environment has garnered increasing 
attention for its positive impacts on health ( Aletta et al., 2018 ; Hong 
et al., 2019 ; Aletta et al., 2023 ). In the late 1960s and early 1970s, 
Canadian composer and scientist Professor Schafer (Schafer, R.M.) 
introduced the concept of “soundscape” ( Schafer, 1969 ). In the same 
year, Southworth (1969)  also mentioned the concept of soundscape in 
his paper The Sonic Environment of Cities . Unlike traditional noise 
control, soundscapes prioritize perception over mere physical 
quantities. They consider positively impactful sounds rather than just 
non-noise ( Kang, 2014 ). Creating a positive acoustic environment for 
residents not only alleviates stress and fatigue but also promotes 
communication and interaction among people ( Kang et al., 2016 ).
To evaluate people’s positive perceptions of sound, various 
soundscape indicators have been established worldwide as evaluation 
standards. Current soundscape assessments primarily rely on 
sociological and psychological methods. For instance, Raimbault et al. 
(2003)  observed behaviors and conducted surveys to derive a 
soundscape element evaluation method, revealing a correlation 
between people’s perception of spatial size and acoustic indicators. 
Pheasant et al. (2008)  proposed a method to evaluate “tranquility” 
using a ratio function of noise levels and natural elements in the 
environment through questionnaire surveys. Torija et  al. (2014)  
developed a city soundscape assessment tool using support vector 
machine algorithms, enabling the evaluation of people’s acoustic 
perception and monitoring acoustic characteristics at selected 
locations. The UK researcher Payne (2013)  first developed a Perceived 
Restorativeness Soundscape Scale (PRSS) for adults, assessing the 
restorative potential of surrounding acoustic environments. The 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) ( International 
Standardization Organization, 2018 ) standardized soundscape 
assessment methods, including soundwalks, questionnaire surveys, 
and guided interviews.
The aforementioned studies mainly focused on adults. However, 
due to children being in a special stage of physical and psychological 
development, the impact of the soundscape on children differs 
significantly from that on adults ( Spivak and Chute, 1994 ). As a result, 
researchers have begun to pay attention to the positive effects of sound 
on children’s health. For example, British researchers like Lubman 
(2002)  found that the sounds in classrooms and play areas affect 
children’s behavior and learning. They suggested using outdoor 
natural sounds to promote children’s learning, which is beneficial for 
their communication and interaction. Chinese researchers like Ma 
et  al. (2022)  discovered that the pleasantness and tranquility of 
soundscapes significantly influence children’s evaluations of 
soundscapes, demonstrating that soundscape quality significantly affects children’s cognitive development. Visentin et al. (2023)  found 
through their research on indoor soundscapes in elementary schools 
that the pleasantness of soundscapes is related to students’ age, 
perceived sound loudness, and the frequency of sounds from nearby 
classrooms. The study results also showed that most school-aged 
children are exposed to unpleasant sounds and they prefer music and 
natural sounds.
Meanwhile, an increasing number of researchers have begun to 
focus on the psychological recovery effects of soundscapes on 
children. For instance, Shu and Ma (2018)  created a PRSS-C Scale, 
consisting of 16 items that divide children’s perception of soundscape 
restorativeness into three dimensions. Through their research, they 
found that children’s perception of the restorativeness of acoustic 
environments is positively correlated with fluctuation intensity and 
sharpness, and negatively correlated with loudness and roughness. 
Subsequently, the team ( Shu and Ma, 2019 ) discovered that music, 
bird sounds, fountain sounds, and stream sounds can significantly 
alleviate children’s psychological stress, improve their attention 
restoration performance. The team ( Shu, 2023 ) further demonstrated 
that music, bird sounds, and fountain sounds have potential restorative 
effects on children, with music being the most restorative sound.
However, the scale created by Shu and Ma (2018)  needs further 
development and validation. Firstly, in terms of sample size, the 
sample size chosen by Ma et al. for creating PRSS-C was relatively 
small (only 36 students). Although there is no minimum sample size 
requirement for statistical purposes in developing scales, a sufficiently 
large sample size is needed to focus attention on the appropriateness 
of items ( Devellis and Thorpe, 1991 ). Secondly, in the process of data 
statistical analysis, an effective scale should include a complete process 
of development and validation. The purpose of the development 
process is to analyze the initial sample, calculate the internal 
consistency of the scale, evaluate scale items, and adjust the number 
of scale items. The validation process is to cross-validate the initial 
analysis results and test whether the data analysis results of the 
development process can be reproduced ( Devellis and Thorpe, 1991 ). 
Therefore, addressing the aforementioned issues, this study, based on 
the results of Ma et  al. ’s research, referred to some items in the 
Perceived Restorative Components Scale for Children (PRCS-C) 
(Bagot, 2004 ) and the PRSS for adults ( Payne, 2013 ), further developed 
and validated the effectiveness of the PRSS-C, providing an effective 
assessment tool for children’s perceived restorative soundscapes.
Since the 20th century, “restorative environments” have gradually 
become a research hotspot in various fields, attracting widespread 
attention from disciplines such as environmental psychology, public 
health, and urban planning ( Hartig and Staats, 2003 ; Su and Ziqiang, 
2010 ). There are two main theoretical frameworks: the Attention 
Restoration Theory (ART) proposed by Kaplan and Kaplan (1989)  in 
the field of environmental psychology, and the Stress Reduction 
Theory (SRT) put forth by Ulrich in the field of restorative architecture 
(Ulrich et al., 1991 ). Building on these theories, research on restorative 
environments has made significant progress, with numerous studies 
confirming that natural environments have greater restorative 
qualities compared to urban environments ( Karmanov and Hamel, 
2008 ; Gidlow et al., 2016 ; Grazuleviciene et al., 2016 ).
Psychological recovery involves bouncing back from attention 
fatigue and everyday work stress ( Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989 ; Herzog 
et  al., 1997 ). It has been shown that psychological recovery can 
enhance people’s attention performance ( Tennessen and Cimprich,

Qin et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1362096
Frontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org1995 ). The Attention Restoration Theory ( Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989 ; 
Kaplan, 1995 ) outlines four components that should be present in a 
restorative environment: Fascination, Being-Away, Compatibility, and 
Extent (collectively referred to as FACE in this paper). In a given 
environment, the presence or absence of these four components 
determines its restorative nature. Overall, a highly restorative 
environment should encompass each component of FACE; otherwise, 
the restorative potential of that environment may be  diminished. 
Fascination is the most crucial feature of a restorative environment, 
signifying that when environmental elements are highly interesting, 
involuntary attention plays a primary role. Individuals no longer need 
to actively focus their attention, and the effort to suppress distractions 
can relax, thus allowing directed attention to recover and reducing 
attention fatigue ( Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989 ). Being-Away refers to 
distancing individuals from mentally taxing cognitive activities that 
require directed attention, facilitating the recovery of fatigued 
attention. This component is further divided into two types of 
“away”—physical away, referring to different geographical locations, 
and psychological away, involving a shift in thoughts ( Kaplan and 
Kaplan, 1989 ). Compatibility indicates that the environment aligns 
with people’s purposes or interests ( Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989 ). High 
alignment between individual interests and the environment reduces 
the use of directed attention, thereby decreasing fatigue associated 
with directed attention. Extent refers to the capacity of the restorative 
environment to offer sufficient content and information. It must 
possess coherence and richness, encouraging people to observe, 
experience, or contemplate, thus occupying their minds to a certain 
extent and placing them in a completely different psychological state, 
allowing overworked attention to rest ( Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989 ).
The magnitude of environmental restorativeness depends on an 
individual’s perception of FACE in that environment. Consequently, 
various scales have been developed to assess individuals’ perception 
of FACE in different environments, helping to determine the 
restorative potential of those environments ( Hartig et  al., 1997 ; 
Laumann et al., 2001 ; Herzog et al., 2003 ). Additionally, the PRCS-C 
has been developed ( Bagot, 2004 ) to compare children’s perception of 
environmental restorativeness with that of adults. However, a positive 
impact on health can also result from a favorable acoustic 
environment. Research on restorative soundscapes, grounded in the 
Attention Restoration Theory, explores how pleasant sounds 
contribute to psychological recovery. To this end, Payne (2013)  
developed the PRSS in 2013, aiming to assess people’s perception of 
the FACE components in acoustic environment environments and, 
consequently, evaluating the restorative potential of acoustic  
environments.
In summary, the current research on restorative soundscapes 
predominantly focuses on adults. However, with the emergence of 
restorative environments, an increasing number of researchers are 
exploring the psychological recovery effects of soundscapes on 
children. Many studies have already demonstrated that favorable 
soundscapes can significantly promote psychological recovery in 
children. For this reason, Ma et al. created the PRSS-C ( Shu and Ma, 
2018 ), which allows children to assess the restorative quality of the 
surrounding acoustic environment. However, further development 
and validation of the PRSS-C are needed. Therefore, this study 
employed scale assessment and statistical data analysis methods to 
conduct two experiments, ultimately developing and validating the 
PRSS-C effectiveness. This scale was designed and adapted based on the general PRCS-C ( Bagot, 2004 ) and the PRSS-C created by Shu and 
Ma (2018)  while also referencing the development and testing process 
of the PRSS ( Payne, 2013 ). Unlike the PRCS-C, the PRSS-C mainly 
focuses on the impact of sound on children rather than the general 
environment. Additionally, unlike the PRSS, the research subjects of 
the PRSS-C are children, focusing on children’s perception of 
restorative soundscapes rather than adults. The first study was 
conducted under semi-controlled conditions to initially analyze the 
samples and test the ability of the PRSS-C to distinguish the restorative 
nature of soundscapes in three different types of environments (urban 
center, urban suburb, and urban peripheral forest). The second study, 
also conducted under semi-controlled conditions, aimed to cross-
validate the initial analysis results by testing the PRSS-C’s ability to 
distinguish the restorative nature of soundscapes from two similar 
environments (two city parks) within the same city. Specifically, the 
ultimate goal of these two experiments was to develop and validate the 
effectiveness of the PRSS-C, providing an effective assessment tool for 
evaluating the restorative potential of acoustic environments 
surrounding children.
2 Establishment of PRSS-C
The main purpose of this study is to develop and validate the 
effectiveness of PRSS-C. To do so, we first need to create a PRSS-C. The 
design of items in the scale includes designing and adapting some 
items from PRCS-C ( Bagot, 2004 ), and referencing the creation of 
some items in PRSS-C by Shu and Ma (2018) . Additionally, based on 
the opinions of scale compilation experts, some items from the PRSS 
were also referenced ( Payne, 2013 ). The adaptation method follows 
the adaptation method of PRSS ( Payne, 2013 ), and the initial PRSS-C 
was created according to the scale compilation guidelines in “Scale 
Development: Theory and Applications” ( Devellis and Thorpe, 1991 ).
To ensure the validity of each item in PRSS-C as much as possible 
during the initial creation stage, further analysis of the composition 
characteristics of the three referenced scales is needed. Firstly, 
Kathleen L. Bagot developed PRCS-C ( Bagot, 2004 ) in 2004 and 
further developed PRSS-C II ( Bagot, 2007 ) in 2007. The scale consists 
of 15 items forming a five-level speech scale, dividing children’s 
perceptual recovery of the general environment into five dimensions: 
Fascination, Being-Away-ph, Compatibility, Being-Away-ps, and 
Extent. The cumulative percentage of variance of the five factors is 
60.75%. The scale is mainly used to assess the restorative potential of 
the general environment for children. However, this study mainly 
focuses on the restorative potential of acoustic environments for 
children. Therefore, the descriptions related to the general 
environment were modified to be related to sound, and the adaptation 
of each item was validated using statistical analysis.
Secondly, Payne (2013)  developed and validated the PRSS for 
adults in 2013. The development and validation process of this scale 
referred to the development and validation process of the Perceived 
Restorativeness Scale (PRS) for adults by Laumann et al. (2001) . The 
scale consists of 14 items forming a seven-level speech scale, dividing 
adults’ perception of acoustic environments into two dimensions: 
general dimension and Being-Away-Extent dimension. The 
cumulative variance percentage of the two factors is between 36 and 
45%. The scale is mainly used to assess the restorative potential of 
soundscapes for adults. However, this study focuses on school-aged

Qin et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1362096
Frontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.orgchildren, so the development and validation process of PRSS was 
referenced. Based on the opinions of different elementary school 
educators and relevant scale compilation experts, the descriptions 
related to the acoustic environment for adults were modified to 
be understandable to children.
Finally, Shu and Ma (2018)  created a PRSS-C in 2018. The scale 
consists of 16 items forming a five-level speech scale, dividing 
children’s perception of acoustic environments into three dimensions: 
Fascination, Compatibility, and Extent. The cumulative percentage of 
variance for Fascination is 40.06%, for Compatibility is 20.41%, and 
for Extent is 11.75%. The overall cumulative variance percentage is 
relatively high (72.21%), and the scale also has high reliability and 
validity during its creation process (KMO = 0.909, p < 0.01, Cronbach’s 
α > 0.8). Therefore, although the sample size for creating this scale was 
small (19 boys and 17 girls), and there was no further development 
and validation in the data analysis process, it still has high 
reference value.
Based on the above three scales, this study created the initial 
PRSS-C, which consists of 17 items corresponding to the FACE 
divided into 5 components. The first 5 items represent Fascination, 
items 6 to 8 represent Being-Away-ph, items 9 to 11 represent 
Compatibility, items 12 to 14 represent Being-Away-ps, and items 
15–17 represent Extent. In order to make the scale easier for 
children to understand, one scale compilation expert, two 
elementary school teachers, and one elementary school educator 
inspected and proposed corresponding modifications to the 
wording of each item in the scale to ensure its suitability for 
children, as shown in Table 1 .
The method of adapting each item in the initially created PRSS-C 
is shown in Table 2 . For example, the first item of the scale “I can hear 
many interesting sounds” refers to the description of Fascination 
components in the PRCS-C, “There are lots of interesting places in the 
school ground, ” where the description of “interesting places” in the 
general environment is changed to “interesting sounds, ” and the 
specific range-related term “in the school ground” is removed to 
facilitate other researchers’ use. The second item of the scale “This 
sound makes me want to hear more” directly quotes the description 
of Fascination components in the acoustic environment from the 
PRSS-C created by Ma et al.
3 Experiment 1
The purpose of this experiment was to develop a test of the 
initially created PRSS-C. The questionnaire data were first collected, 
after which the initially created PRSS-C was developed using statistical 
analysis of data in the following steps: (1) It was determined that each 
item in the PRSS-C represents only one of the components of FACE; 
(2) The Cronbach’s alpha coefficients and the mean values of the item 
correlations were compared to determine the internal consistency of 
the different components of FACE in the scale; (3) It was determined 
that the number of extracted number of factors; (4) Extract the 
number of fixed factors to analyze the structure of the scale; Finally, 
analyze the reliability and validity of the scale to determine whether 
the scale was developed successfully.
First, the Attention Restoration Theory ( Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989 ) 
describes that a restorative environment should contain four 
components of FACE. Furthermore, it distinguishes between psychological and physical aspects of Being-Away, totaling five 
components. The higher people perceive these five components in 
their environment, the greater its potential for restoration. Since the 
acoustic environment is a significant part of the general environment, 
a good acoustic environment also possesses high restorative potential. 
Thus, this study, based on the Attention Restoration Theory, divides 
the items in the scale into five dimensions. This allows school-aged 
children to assess the extent of FACE contained in different acoustic 
environments, thereby evaluating the restoration potential of each 
acoustic environment. Therefore, it is anticipated that PRSS-C should 
be  able to be  divided into five components in this experiment. 
Secondly, previous studies indicate that people prefer natural sounds 
(Y ang and Kang, 2005 ), and natural environments are significantly 
associated with restorative environments ( Purcell et al., 2001 ; van den 
Berg et al., 2003 ). Specifically for children, natural sounds like flowing 
water and bird calls promote children’s attention restoration ( Shu, 
2023 ). However, in this experiment, the three environments include 
more natural elements in the forest areas near the city, predominantly 
natural sounds. The suburban areas encompass both natural sounds 
and vehicle noises, while the city center is mainly dominated by 
vehicle noises. Therefore, it is expected that the forest areas near the 
city have the highest potential for soundscape restoration, while the 
city center has the lowest.
In summary, based on previous research findings and predictions 
of experimental results, two hypotheses are proposed:TABLE 1  The initial creation of PRSS-C is grouped according to attention 
restoration theory.

 2. For children, restorative potential of soundscapes Is lower In

This experiment was conducted in six classrooms, each with an 
area of 54 square meters. The room height, layout, building materials, 
size and position of doors and windows, as well as the location of 
speakers and TVs were all the same. Therefore, the reverberation time 
in all rooms was the same. Additionally, the sound level in each 
classroom was controlled to be the same on the multimedia control 
end. Two teachers supervised the children’s answering in each 
classroom. Throughout the experiment, all participants maintained 
relative quietness, and there were no instances of mutual cheating or 
other sound interference. The experiment took place at noon, after 
participants had experienced a morning of classes, putting them in a 
naturally fatigued state ( Hartig and Staats, 2006 ). Participants were 
then asked to imagine themselves in the environments shown in the videos ( Laumann et al., 2001 ) and were informed that there were no 
correct answers to the questions, and they should respond based on 
their own perception of the sounds. Finally, they were evaluated 
using PRSS-C.
3.1 Experimental method
3.1.1 Participants
Considering that younger children may have difficulty completing 
the questionnaire, participants in this experiment were students in 
grades 5–6 from Gonghua School in Changping District, Beijing, 
totaling 185 individuals aged between 10 and 12 years old, including 
108 males and 77 females ( M = 11.25, SD = 0.44). The participants were 
divided into three groups: Group 1 with 61 participants, Group 2 with 
62 participants, and Group  3 with 62 participants. Since each 
classroom can accommodate a maximum of 40 students, participants 
from the three groups were evenly distributed into six classrooms in 
sequence to conduct the experiment simultaneously. All participants TABLE 2  Adaptation methods for each item in the initially created PRSS-C.

sessions were recorded in August 2023, on a sunny and clear day. 
The recording locations were the city center of Changping District, 
the urban outskirts of Shijingshan District, and the wooded area 
within Fragrant Hills Park, all in Beijing. Images of the recording 
sites are shown in Figure 1 . The audio and video were captured 
using a digital single-lens reflex camera (Canon EOS 600D) paired 
with a dual-channel stereo microphone (MAMEN mic08). The 
camera was positioned at the eye level of children, and the 
microphone was slightly below the camera height, positioned at the 
ear level of the children.
The audio-visual stimuli for the three experimental conditions 
were reproduced in a classroom setting. The classroom was equipped 
with an 84-inch color television (Hisense LED84XT900G3D) and two 
multimedia speakers placed at the left and right upper corners of the 
room. The sequence of video playback varied across the three 
conditions to control for order effects ( Payne, 2013 ) (1: urban outskirts 
wooded area, urban suburbs, city center; 2: city center, urban outskirts 
wooded area, urban suburbs; 3: urban suburbs, city center, urban 
outskirts wooded area).
The sounds recorded in the city center primarily include the 
sounds of vehicles driving and honking, pedestrian chatter and 
footsteps, construction noise from nearby construction sites, and the 
faint rustling of leaves when a summer breeze passes through. The 
sounds recorded in the suburban areas mainly consist of the chirping 
of cicadas in the summer, the gentle rustling of leaves when a summer 
breeze passes through, pedestrian chatter and footsteps, along with 
occasional honking and driving sounds from passing vehicles. The 
sounds recorded in the forest areas near the city primarily include the 
chirping of birds and cicadas in the summer, the sound of a small 
stream flowing, along with occasional footsteps and chatter from 
passing pedestrians.
3.1.3 Experimental scale
The scale utilized in Experiment 1 was the PRSS-C, originally 
developed by the researchers and outlined in Table 1 . Each item in the scale represented a component of Attention Restoration Theory, with 
five items indicating Fascination, three items representing Away-ph, 
three items representing Compatibility, three items representing 
Away-ps, and three items representing Extent. The scale employed a 
five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 to 5, with options being 
“Strongly Disagree, ” “Disagree Somewhat, ” “Neither Agree nor 
Disagree, ” “ Agree Somewhat, ” and “Strongly Agree. ” Children were 
required to mark a check under each item based on their 
own perceptions.
All participants exhibited enthusiasm and interest in the 
experiment, with the entire process being communicated by teachers 
and peers. The teachers had undergone a certain level of training and 
were well-acquainted with each step of the experimental procedure. 
Before initiating the experiment, the teachers provided an overview of 
the process to the participants, emphasizing that there were no correct 
answers for each item. Participants were instructed to respond based 
on their personal perceptions of the sounds. Simultaneously, 
participants were asked to imagine themselves being present in the 
video environment during the presentation of audio-visual stimuli 
(Laumann et al., 2001 ).
3.1.4 Experimental procedure
Before the commencement of the experiment, the instructor 
provided participants with an introduction to the experimental 
procedures. Participants were instructed to immerse themselves in the 
described environment through imagination. Subsequently, survey 
questionnaires were distributed, and participants were given the 
opportunity to read through the project. Any areas of confusion or 
lack of understanding were addressed by the instructor, with research 
personnel noting such instances for later analysis.
To enhance children’s immersion in the acoustic environment, 
following the experimental procedures described by Payne during the 
development of PRSS ( Payne, 2013 ) and by Ma and others during the 
creation of PRSS-C ( Shu and Ma, 2018 ), The experiment commenced 
with the presentation of audio-visual stimuli for a duration of 2 min, 
following this, the visual stimuli were discontinued, and only the 
audio stimuli were played for an additional 2  min. After the 
completion of the audio stimuli, participants utilized the PRSS-C to 
assess the auditory scenes. This evaluation process was repeated for a 
total of three different environments, with each environment being 
repeated once. The entire experimental session lasted approximately 
20 min, as illustrated in Figure 2 .

Frontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org3.2 Experimental analysis
A series of analyses were conducted using SPSS (26) to assess the 
relationship between PRSS-C and Attention Restoration Theory, and 
to determine the appropriate factor structure for PRSS-C. These 
analyses were conducted following the analytical procedures outlined 
in the development of the PRSS ( Payne, 2013 ). The analyses were 
repeated three times, once for each environment. Missing value 
analysis revealed that all variables had missing values of less than 1%. 
Missing values were replaced with means, and a normality test 
indicated a skewed distribution. Due to the sample size exceeding 30 
and the difficulty in transforming variables, the data were not 
transformed into a normal distribution ( Tabachnick and Fidell, 1996 ).
Initially, a preliminary principal axis analysis was conducted to 
determine whether each item in PRSS-C represented only one 
component of FACE. The principal axis analysis was performed three 
times, once for each environment. Based on the eigenvalue greater than 1 criterion, both urban center and suburban areas extracted 5 
factors, while the urban periphery with wooded areas extracted 4 
factors. Items with factor loadings above 0.35 (high loadings) and 
below −0.35 (low loadings) were marked ( Payne, 2013 ) with gray 
shading to indicate their joint high or low loadings on multiple factors 
or no loading on any factor. Finally, items with high and low loadings 
consistently across two or three environments were removed 
(Fascination 5 and Away-ps 13), as shown in Table 3 .
Next, reliability analyses were conducted on the remaining 15 
items, repeated three times, once for each environment. The analysis 
results showed high internal consistency for each environment (Forest 
Area: α = 0.873, Suburban Area: α = 0.829, City Center: α = 0.841). 
Subsequently, individual analyses were conducted on the FACE 
components in each environment. Internal consistency between items 
is in the optimal range when the Mean Value of Inter-Item Correlations 
is between 0.2 and 0.4 ( Briggs and Cheek, 1986 ). The results of the 
analyses showed that the internal consistency of each constituent in

Gray-padded portions of the table indicate that the item loaded onto more than one factor or did not load onto any factors.

Qin et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1362096
Frontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.orgthe three environments was high, except for the Away-ph constituents 
in the suburban and urban centers, where Compatibility and Extent 
in the peripheral forested areas, Extent in the suburban areas, and 
Compatibility in the urban centers were in the optimal ranges, as 
shown in Table 4 .
Thirdly, to determine the factor structure of PRSS-C consisting of 
15 items, principal component analyses were conducted for each 
environment. The factor structure of the data was determined by 
comparing the eigenvalues generated by the principal component 
analysis for each environment with the random eigenvalues generated 
by parallel analysis ( Watkins, 2000 ). The rationale behind this method 
is that the eigenvalue of the last factor extracted should be greater than 
the random data eigenvalues under comparable conditions. Although 
some studies have advocated factor extraction based on scree plots 
(Bagot, 2004 ), a more rigorous approach involves comparing 
eigenvalues generated by principal component analysis with those 
generated by parallel analysis ( Devellis and Thorpe, 1991 ). The 
analysis results indicated that a two-factor structure was suitable for 
all three environments, as depicted in Figure 3 .
Fourthly, a varimax rotation was applied to the principal 
component analysis using the maximum variance method, extracting 
a fixed number of two factors for each environment. The results of the 
analysis varied for the three environments, with some items not 
loading onto the same factors. The factor structure loadings are 
presented in Table 5 . For the first factor, the variance percentages in 
the Urban Periphery with Wooded Areas, Suburban Area, and Urban 
Center were 26, 19, and 20%, respectively. For the second factor, the 
variance percentages in the three environments were 25, 19, and 19%, 
respectively. To assess whether the factor structure was consistent 
across the three environments, it was necessary to examine the factor 
loadings of each item in the three environments to determine which factor each item loaded onto. The gray shaded areas in Table 5  indicate 
higher loadings of items on that particular factor. By comparing the 
factor structures across the three environments, it was observed that 
the factor structures were similar, with the exception of Compatibility 
9 and Away-ps 15, which loaded onto different factors in the three 
environments. Factor 1 consists mainly of Away and Extent, referring 
to Factor 1 as the Away and Extent factor, and Factor 2 consists mainly 
of Fascination and Compatibility, referring to Factor 2 as the 
Fascination and Compatibility factor.
Finally, the scale underwent reliability and validity analyses. 
Firstly, reliability analyses were conducted on the items for each factor 
in these three environments. The results of the analysis showed that 
the internal consistency of the items on these two factors was in the 
optimal range (0.2 < M < 0.4) in all three environments. Subsequently, 
validity analyses were performed on the scale, and the results indicated 
that the scale had high validity (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure >0.7). 
As shown in Table  6 , the scale demonstrated good reliability and 
validity (0.2 < M < 0.4; KMO > 0.7; p < 0.05). Therefore, a scale with a 
dual-factor structure consisting of 15 items was created. However, 
PRSS-C did not correspond to the five components of FACE, thus the 
first hypothesis was not supported.
To validate whether PRSS-C can differentiate the restorative 
potential of soundscapes in three different environments, the scores 
of each environment’s items were summed and averaged. By 
comparing the average scores of these environments, the restorative 
potential of the three environments was evaluated ( Bagot, 2004 ). 
Mean scores of the three environments were compared using one-way 
ANOV A, and the results of the analysis showed that there was a 
significant difference between the mean scores of the three 
environments ( F  = 9.764, Sig. < 0.05), and then Post Hoc  Multiple 
Comparisons using the LSD and S-N-K methods revealed that the TABLE 4  Mean value of inter-item correlations.

SD = 0.76) were higher than those of the suburban environment scores 
(M  = 3.25, SD = 0.67) this difference was statistically significant 
(I-J = 0.305, Sig. < 0.05); environmental scores in the urban periphery 
(M  = 3.24, SD = 0.67) were higher than those in the urban center 
(M  = 2.97, SD = 0.70) this difference was statistically significant 
(I-J = 0.267, Sig. < 0.05).
Afterwards, we compared the factor scores of the Fascination and 
Compatibility factor and the Extent and Being-Away factor of the 
three environments, and the results of the analysis showed that there 
was a significant difference in the Fascination and Compatibility factor 
of the three environments ( F = 16.28, Sig. < 0.05), and after that, Post 
Hoc Multiple Comparisons revealed that the Fascination and 
Compatibility factor scores of the peripheral forested area ( M = 3.37, 
SD = 0.95) were higher than that of the urban suburb ( M  = 2.88, 
SD = 0.86), this difference was statistically significant (I-J = 0.499, 
Sig. < 0.05), and that of the urban suburbs ( M = 2.87, SD = 0.84) was 
higher than that of the urban centers ( M  = 2.44, SD = 0.89), this 
difference was statistically significant (I-J = 0.429, Sig. < 0.05), however, in all three environments the Being-Away and Extent factor scores 
were not significantly different ( F = 2.418, Sig. > 0.05), therefore the 
soundscape restorative potential of peri-urban forested areas was 
significantly higher than that of the urban suburbs, and that of the 
urban suburbs was significantly higher than that of the urban centers, 
and therefore the second hypothesis was valid.
3.3 Experimental results
The first experiment aimed to develop and test the initially created 
PRSS-C by researchers. The results indicated that PRSS-C, like PRSS, 
exhibited a bifactor structure. The scale successfully differentiated the 
restorative potential of soundscapes in different environments within 
the same city (urban center, suburban area, and peri-urban forest). 
Overall, due to the good reliability and validity of PRSS-C, a successful 
development of PRSS-C was achieved.
Firstly, PRSS-C yielded a bifactor structure, where four items of 
Fascination, Compatibility 9, Compatibility 10, and Extent 15 loaded TABLE 5  Rotated factor matrixa.

Frontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.orgonto the same factor, termed the Fascination and Compatibility factor. 
The four items of Away, Compatibility 11, Extent 16, and Extent 17 
loaded onto another factor, termed the Away and Extent factor. 
Comparing the factor loadings of items, it was found that the Away 
component did not bifurcate into two components (Away-ph and 
Away-ps) as described in the Attention Restoration Theory. This 
suggests that children’s perceptions of the restorative potential of 
soundscapes do not significantly differ in terms of physical and 
psychological experiences.
Secondly, compared to PRCS-C, PRSS-C yielded a different 
number of factors, which could be attributed to several factors. Firstly, 
PRSS-C developed in this study only assessed the magnitude of 
soundscape restorative potential from two dimensions. Secondly, 
considering the shorter attention span of children in this study, having 
more scale items might result in lower reliability and validity. Hence, 
this experiment only designed 17 items, but having more items might 
generate more factor structures.
Thirdly, as PRSS-C focused on children as the study population, 
it is more suitable for children compared to PRSS. Although both 
PRSS and PRSS-C initially divided the items into five dimensions 
regarding FACE during the initial creation phase, further development 
and validation revealed a bifactor structure for items in both scales. In 
PRSS, Fascination, Compatibility, and Extent loaded onto one factor, 
while Away loaded onto another factor. In PRSS-C, Fascination and 
Compatibility loaded onto one factor, while Extent and Away loaded 
onto another factor.
Fourthly, the internal consistency of the items on both factors of 
the PRSS-C was in the optimal range (0.2 < M < 0.4) in all three 
environments. The entire scale demonstrated high validity in all three 
environments (KMO > 0.7, p < 0.05), indicating the successful 
development of the PRSS-C, consisting of a bifactor structure with 
15 items.
Finally, as the scale did not divide into five components for FACE, 
proving that children’s perception of acoustic environments may differ 
from the restorative perception of general environments, Hypothesis 
1 was not supported. However, as predicted by Hypothesis 2, the 
restorative potential of soundscapes in peri-urban forests was 
significantly higher than that in suburban areas, and the restorative 
potential in suburban areas was significantly higher than that in urban 
centers. PRSS-C successfully differentiated the restorative potential of 
three environments, confirming that soundscapes with more natural 
elements have greater restorative potential for children. Therefore, 
Hypothesis 2 was supported.
4 Experiment 2
The scale developed in Experiment 1 requires further validation. 
The purpose of Experiment 2 is to determine the stability of the factor 
structure of the scale and investigate whether children can use it to 
differentiate the restorative potential of similar environmental 
soundscapes. If PRSS-C can distinguish the restorative potential of 
two similar environments and the factor structure of the scale is stable, 
the value of PRSS-C as a tool for assessing children’s perceptual 
restorative soundscapes will be further enhanced.
Firstly, the purpose of this experiment is to further validate the 
PRSS-C developed in Experiment 1. The data analysis process is 
consistent with that of Experiment 1. The validation process aims to cross-verify the initial analysis results and examine whether the data 
analysis results of the development process can be replicated ( Devellis 
and Thorpe, 1991 ). Therefore, it is expected that the PRSS-C in this 
experiment can be  divided into two components similar to 
Experiment 1.
Secondly, Payne (2013)  found that when further validating the 
developed PRSS in 2013, the potential for soundscape restoration in 
the Weston Park with lower vegetation coverage, smaller area, and 
louder sound was lower compared to the botanical garden with higher 
vegetation coverage, larger area, and quieter sound. In this experiment, 
to further validate the developed PRSS-C from Experiment 1 and 
examine whether PRSS-C distinguishes the potential for soundscape 
restoration in similar environments, two similar environments (the 
National Botanical Garden and the Temple of Heaven Park) in the 
same city (Beijing) were selected. The sound pressure levels of the two 
parks were compared using the TES1359A sound level meter. 
Measurements were taken in mid-August 2023, selecting 15 locations 
along the tour routes in each park. Ten measurements were taken at 
each location with a two-minute interval between measurements. 
Measurements were taken from 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. for 2 days in 
each park, totaling 4 days. A total of 600 sound level data points for 
the two parks were recorded. Subsequently, an independent sample 
t-test was used to compare the sound levels of the two parks. The 
analysis results showed that the sound level in the botanical garden 
(M = 54.9, SD = 8.8) was lower than that in the Temple of Heaven Park 
(M = 64.8, SD = 4.2), and this difference was statistically significant 
(t = −17.5, Sig. = 0.000 < 0.05). Therefore, it is predicted that in this 
experiment, compared to the Temple of Heaven Park, the botanical 
garden, which is larger, quieter, and has higher vegetation coverage, 
has higher soundscape restoration potential.
Based on the data analysis results of Experiment 1 and the 
prediction of the potential for soundscape restoration in the National 
Botanical Garden and the Temple of Heaven Park, two hypotheses 
are proposed:
 1. The items in PRSS-C will be divided into two components, 
consistent with the results of Experiment 1.
 2. For children, potential of soundscapes in Temple of Heaven 
Park is lower than in the National Botanical Garden.
This experiment was conducted in a classroom similar to 
Experiment 1. All physical properties of the classroom were the 
same as those in Experiment 1. The experiment took place at noon 
after participants had undergone a morning of classes, placing them 
in a naturally fatigued state. Participants were then asked to imagine 
themselves in the environment shown in the video and were 
informed that there were no correct answers to the questions, and 
they should respond based on their own perception of the sounds. 
Finally, the PRSS-C developed in Experiment 1 was used 
for evaluation.
4.1 Experimental method
4.1.1 Participants
The participants of this experiment were students in grades 5–6 
from Gonghua School in Changping District, Beijing. There were a 
total of 244 participants, aged between 10 and 12 years old ( M = 11.2,

Qin et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1362096
Frontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.orgSD = 0.42), with 144 males and 100 females. All participants were 
evenly distributed across 8 classrooms and had normal hearing 
abilities. The experiment was conducted with the consent of both 
teachers and parents, and it received approval from the Ethics 
Committee of Inner Mongolia University of Technology.
4.1.2 Experimental stimuli
The experimental stimuli for this study consisted of two audio-
visual recordings, each lasting for 2 min. These recordings were 
captured at the end of August 2023, on a sunny and clear day. The 
recording locations were the Beijing Botanical Garden and the Temple 
of Heaven Park in Beijing, as depicted in Figure 4 . The recording 
equipment and methods were consistent with those used in 
Experiment 1. For Experiment 2, the audio-visual stimuli were 
reproduced in a classroom setting. The classroom was equipped with 
an 84-inch color television and two multimedia speakers (Hisense 
LED84XT900G3D), positioned in the upper left and upper right 
corners of the classroom, respectively.
The recordings from the botanical garden primarily include the 
rustling sound of leaves in the summer breeze, cicadas and birds 
chirping in the summer, the gentle flowing sound of water when the 
breeze passes over the lake’s surface in summer, as well as the voices 
and footsteps of visitors. The recordings from the Temple of Heaven 
Park mainly consist of the voices and footsteps of visitors, cicadas 
chirping, a small amount of bird calls, and the rustling sound of leaves 
in the summer breeze.
4.1.3 Experimental scale
In Experiment 2, the scale developed in Experiment 1 was used. 
Since the participants in both experiments were Chinese children, the 
scales used in both experiments were in Chinese. The scale developed 
in Experiment One underwent data analysis, resulting in the removal 
of items Fascination 5 and Compatibility 13. The refined scale, as 
presented in Table  7 , consists of 15 items. Each item represents a 
component of the Attention Restoration Theory, with four items 
indicating Fascination, three items for Away-ph, two items for 
Compatibility, three items for Away-ps, and three items for Extent. 
The scale adopts a five-point Likert scale, where respondents can 
express their agreement on a continuum from 1 to 5: “Strongly 
Disagree, ” “Disagree a Little, ” “Neither Agree nor Disagree, ” “ Agree a 
Little, ” and “Strongly Agree. ”In Experiment Two, the entire process continued to involve 
communication between the teachers and the students. These teachers 
had undergone a certain level of training and possessed a detailed 
understanding of each step of the experimental procedure. Before the 
commencement of the experiment, the teachers provided participants 
with an overview of the process. Participants were informed that there 
were no correct answers for each item and were encouraged to 
respond based on their own perceptions of the sounds. Additionally, 
participants were instructed to imagine themselves immersed in the 
video environment while experiencing the audio-visual stimuli.

Frontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin.org4.1.4 Experimental procedure
The process of Experiment Two closely mirrored that of 
Experiment One. Prior to the start of the experiment, teachers 
provided participants with an introduction to the experimental 
procedure, encouraging them to imagine themselves in the described 
environments. Subsequently, participants were given the survey 
questionnaire to read. Any areas of confusion or lack of understanding 
were addressed by the teachers, and the research personnel marked 
those specific items.
The experiment commenced with the presentation of audio-visual 
stimuli for 2 min. Following this, the visual stimuli were turned off, 
and only the identical audio stimuli continued for an additional 2 min. 
After the audio stimuli, participants used the PRSS-C developed in 
Experiment One to assess the auditory scenes. This process was 
repeated for each of the two environments, resulting in a total duration 
of approximately 15 min for the entire experiment.
4.2 Experimental analysis
The data analysis process for Experiment Two replicated the 
analysis process used in Experiment One for the development of 
PRSS-C. SPSS (version 26) was employed for a series of analyses to 
verify whether the developed PRSS-C exhibited a stable factor 
structure and could differentiate the auditory restorativeness 
potential of similar environments. The analyses were repeated 
twice, once for each environment. The results of the missing value 
analysis indicated that missing values for all variables were less than 
1%. Missing values were replaced with the mean, and similar to 
Experiment One, the data exhibited a skewed distribution. Due to 
the sample size being greater than 30 and the difficulty of transforming variables, the data were not transformed into a normal 
distribution. Using an independent samples t-test, the analysis was 
conducted to examine whether there were significant differences in 
perceptual outcomes between children who participated in the 
experiment for the first time and those who participated for the 
second time. The analysis results indicate that there were no 
significant differences (Sig. > 0.05) in perceptual outcomes for both 
the acoustic environments of the Temple of Heaven Park and the 
botanical garden between children who participated in the 
experiment for the first time and those who participated for the 
second time. This suggests that the number of times children 
participated in the experiment did not affect the accuracy of the 
experimental results in this study.
Firstly, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted twice, once 
for each environment. Following the principle of extracting factors 
with eigenvalues greater than 1, five factors were extracted for both 
the Botanical Garden and the Temple of Heaven Park. Items with high 
factor loadings (>0.35) and low factor loadings (<0.35) were marked 
with gray shading and listed in Table 8 . Items that loaded heavily on 
multiple factors or failed to load on any factor were eventually 
removed, such as Fascination 4, which exhibited high loadings in 
both environments.
Subsequently, reliability analyses were conducted on the 
remaining 14 items, with the analysis repeated twice, once for each 
environment. The results indicated high internal consistency for each 
environment (Temple of Heaven Park α = 0.753, Botanical Garden 
α = 0.781). Following this, separate analyses were conducted for the 
FACE components in each environment. The results of the analysis 
show that the internal consistency of the items of the Compatibility 
component in two similar environments is in the optimal range, as 
shown in Table 9 .TABLE 8  Rotated factor matrixa.

Qin et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1362096
Frontiers in Psychology 13 frontiersin.orgThirdly, to establish the factor structure of PRSS-C consisting of 
14 items, a principal component analysis was conducted for each 
environment. The factor structure was determined by comparing the 
eigenvalues generated by the principal component analysis with the 
random eigenvalues generated by parallel analysis. The results 
indicated that a two-factor structure was suitable for both 
environments, as illustrated in Figure 5 .
Fourthly, a maximum variance method rotation was applied to the 
principal component analysis for each environment, extracting a fixed 
number of two factors. The analysis results for both environments 
were similar, with only Away-ph 5 and Extent 13 loading onto different 
factors. The factor structure loadings are presented in Table 10 , where 
shaded areas indicate higher loadings on that factor. For the first 
factor, the variance percentages for the Botanical Garden and Temple 
of Heaven Park environments were 21% each. For the second factor, 
the variance percentages were 15% for the Botanical Garden and 12% 
for the Temple of Heaven Park. Comparing the factor structures 
between the two environments revealed similarities. In the Botanical 
Garden environment, three items from Fascination, three items from 
Compatibility, and Away-ph 6 and 7 loaded onto Factor 1, while 
Away-ph 5 and two items from Away-ps loaded onto Factor 2. In the 
Temple of Heaven Park environment, three items from Fascination, 
Away-ph 6, three items from Compatibility, and Extent 14 and 15 
loaded onto Factor 1, while Away-ph 5 and 7, two items from Away-ps, 
and Degree 13 loaded onto Factor 2.
Finally, reliability and validity analyses were conducted on the 
scale. Firstly, reliability analyses were performed on each factor’s items in both environments. The results of the analysis showed that the 
internal consistency of items on both factors in two similar 
environments was in the optimal range (0.2 < M < 0.4). Subsequently, 
validity analyses were conducted on the scale, revealing high validity 
(KMO > 0.7). As shown in Table 11 , the scale demonstrated good 
reliability and validity (0.2 < M < 0.4; KMO > 0.7; p < 0.05). Therefore, 
the developed PRSS-C yielded a dual-factor structure as predicted, 
supporting Hypothesis 1.
To validate the restorative potential of the developed PRSS-C in 
distinguishing similar environmental scenes, the scores for each 
environmental setting were aggregated. A paired-sample t-test was 
employed to assess the restorative potential of the acoustic scenes in 
these two environments. The analysis revealed that the environmental 
score in the botanical garden ( M = 3.44, SD = 0.56) was significantly 
higher than that in the urban outskirts ( M = 3.07, SD = 0.57), with a 
statistically significant difference ( t = 5.02, Sig. < 0.05). Subsequently, 
the general factor scores and Away factor scores between the two 
environments were compared. The analysis revealed that the general 
factor score in the botanical garden ( M = 3.65, SD = 0.68) was greater 
than that in the Temple of Heaven Park ( M = 3.19, SD = 0.67), and this 
difference was statistically significant ( t = 5.02, Sig. < 0.05). Similarly, 
the Away factor score in the botanical garden ( M = 3.73, SD = 0.78) was 
greater than that in the Temple of Heaven Park ( M = 3.49, SD = 0.77), 
and this difference was statistically significant ( t = 2.31, Sig. < 0.05). As 
expected, the perceived restorativeness potential of the botanical 
garden was significantly higher than that of the Temple of Heaven 
Park. Therefore, the second hypothesis is supported.

Frontiers in Psychology 14 frontiersin.org4.3 Experimental results
Experiment two aimed to further validate the efficacy of the 
PRSS-C and explore the characteristics of restorative soundscape 
evaluations in children when faced with similar environments. The 
results indicated a certain stability in the factor structure of PRSS-C, 
and children successfully differentiated the restorative potential of 
soundscapes between the botanical garden and the Temple of Heaven 
Park. This further demonstrates that soundscapes with more natural 
elements have greater restorative potential for children.
Compared to Experiment 1, the PRSS-C in Experiment 2 also 
exhibited a dual-factor structure. However, the same items loaded 
onto different factors in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. Specifically, 
in Experiment 1, Fascination and Compatibility loaded onto one 
factor, while Extent and Being-Away loaded onto another. In 
Experiment 2, Fascination, Compatibility, and Extent loaded onto one 
factor, while Being-Away loaded onto another. Several reasons could 
account for this discrepancy. Firstly, sample differences: the samples 
used during the development and validation processes may have had 
different characteristics, such as varying socioeconomic backgrounds. 
Differences in sample characteristics could lead to variations in the 
degree of association between different items and factors across 
samples, thereby resulting in inconsistent factor structures. Secondly, sample size and effect size: Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 had 
different sample sizes, and the magnitude of effects may also vary. The 
size of the sample and effect size could influence the stability of the 
factor structure. Smaller sample sizes or smaller effects might make 
the factor structure more susceptible to the influence of individual 
data points within the sample, thereby leading to differences across 
different samples. Thirdly, changes in scale content: in Experiment 2, 
modification or removal of items, such as the removal of Fascination 
4 through principal axis analysis, could affect the factor structure.
Despite the fact that the same items did not consistently load onto 
the same factors across Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, both 
experiments overall yielded similar dual-factor structures. This 
demonstrates that the PRSS-C exhibits a degree of stability and 
consistency across different samples or datasets, thus enhancing the 
value of the scale. Compared to the development process of the PRSS 
(Payne, 2013 ), PRSS-C yielded a bifactor structure when assessing the 
restorative potential of similar environments. This discrepancy might 
be attributed to the heightened perceptual sensitivity of children to 
acoustic environments compared to adults. Compared to the 
development process of the PRCS-C ( Bagot, 2004 ), the PRSS-C in 
Experiment 2 still did not yield specific components corresponding to 
each aspect of FACE. The PRSS-C developed in this study can only 
assess the magnitude of restorativeness potential from two dimensions.TABLE 11  Mean value of inter-item correlations.

Frontiers in Psychology 15 frontiersin.orgFinally, similar to experiment one, PRSS-C was divided into two 
components, and children successfully differentiated the restorative 
potential between two similar environments, proving that the 
botanical garden had a significantly higher restorative potential in its 
soundscape compared to the Temple of Heaven Park. Therefore, both 
hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2 were supported.
5 General discussion
Through two experiments, we have demonstrated that PRSS-C 
enables children to differentiate the restorative potential of 
soundscapes in different environments (urban peripheral forest areas, 
suburban areas, urban centers) and similar environments (botanical 
gardens, Temple of Heaven Park). Additionally, PRSS-C exhibits a 
stable dual-factor structure with good reliability and validity ( Briggs 
and Cheek, 1986 ) (α > 0.7; KMO > 0.7; p < 0.05). Consequently, we have 
successfully developed a perceptual restorative soundscapes scale for 
children, consisting of 14 items with a dual-factor structure. This scale 
can be  used to assess the restorative potential of soundscapes in 
children’s activity spaces, thereby improving the quality of the acoustic 
environment surrounding children.
In both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, PRSS-C yielded a dual-
factor structure. Although some identical items loaded onto different 
factors in these environments (Experiment 1: Compatibility 9 and 
Away-ps 15; Experiment 2: Away-ph 5 and Extent 13), most items 
loaded onto the same factors. This suggests that PRSS-C produced a 
more similar factor structure in both experiments. While differences 
in factor structure across environments have been observed in the 
development of other related soundscape scales ( Payne, 2013 ), 
continuous improvements to PRSS-C have resulted in a more stable 
factor structure across diverse environments, enhancing the scale’s 
overall value.
Comparing the development process of the PRSS-C with the PRSS 
(Payne, 2013 ), PRSS-C similarly produced two-factor structure when 
assessing the restorative potential of soundscapes in three different 
environments. However, different items were included in each factor. 
In PRSS, the factor of “Being-Away” was split into two components 
(Away-Go and Away-Come), whereas in PRSS-C, “Being-Away” was 
not split into two components, except in the urban peripheral forest 
area where Away-ps 15 was an exception. This difference may 
be attributed to significant distinctions in children’s perceptions of 
leaving in psychological and physical contexts compared to adults 
when perceiving the acoustic environment. When assessing the 
restorative potential of similar environments, PRSS and PRSS-C 
exhibited different factor structures. PRSS extracted only a single 
factor, while PRSS-C extracted two different factors, suggesting that 
children’s perceptions may be  more sensitive than adults when 
perceiving the restorative potential of similar acoustic environments.
Compared to the development process of a general perceptual 
restorative scale for children (PRCS-C) ( Bagot, 2004 ), PRSS-C did not 
yield a five-factor structure. This could be attributed to several factors. 
Firstly, PRCS-C consists of 23 items, while PRSS-C has only 17 items; 
a greater number of items may lead to more diverse factor structures. 
Secondly, PRCS-C employed gravel maps for factor extraction, 
whereas PRSS-C utilized parallel analysis to compare eigenvalues 
generated by feature extraction and principal component analysis. 
Lastly, compared to general environments, acoustic environments may not contain as many environmental elements, thus limiting the 
emergence of diverse factor structures. Although early stages of 
developing perceptual restorative scales did not yield multifactor 
structures ( Hartig et al., 1997 ), and similar multifactor structures were 
not observed when developing perceptual restorative soundscapes 
scales for adults in general environments ( Payne, 2013 ), it is still 
necessary to further refine PRSS-C to align with attention restoration 
theory ( Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989 ) and establish a multifactor structure.
Although PRSS-C did not form a five-factor structure for each 
component in FACE, conducting reliability analysis for each 
component in FACE is still valuable. For example, in Experiment 2, 
reliability analyses were conducted for each component of FACE. The 
analysis revealed that Fascination and Away-ps components exhibited 
high internal consistency. However, when extracting two fixed factors, 
these two components were loaded onto different factors. This 
indicates that Fascination and Away-ps components are two crucial 
aspects when children assess the restorativeness potential of acoustic 
environments. Improving PRSS-C by increasing the number of items 
and sample size allows the scale to establish a stable factor structure 
for each component in FACE. This enhancement enables 
comprehensive exploration of the different restorative components 
(FACE) provided by various environmental types for children. 
Identifying which aspect of the restorative components in FACE can 
significantly enhance the soundscape’s restorative potential will help 
improve the acoustic environment for children.
In Experiment 1, the cumulative percentage of explained variance 
by factor loading ranged from 38 to 51%, while in Experiment 2, it 
ranged from 33 to 36%. This is comparable to the cumulative variance 
percentage for PRSS (36–45%) ( Payne, 2013 ). However, when 
compared to general PRCS-C (47–61%) ( Bagot, 2004 ) and other 
related scales (35–70%) ( Korpela and Hartig, 1996 ; Laumann et al., 
2001 ; Ivarsson and Hagerhall, 2008 ), the cumulative variance 
percentage in PRSS-C is relatively lower. This discrepancy may 
be attributed to the rapid physical and psychological development of 
children, making them highly susceptible to the influence of their 
surroundings ( Ferguson et al., 2013 ). Children’s heightened sensitivity 
to their environment may result in significantly different perceptions 
of acoustic environments and general environments. Additionally, 
factors such as fatigue, individual differences among children, visual 
elements, olfactory factors, etc., could also influence children’s 
assessments of soundscape restorativeness. Therefore, when using 
PRSS-C for restorativeness assessments in different acoustic 
environments, consideration should be  given to these 
influencing factors.
6 Conclusion and outlook
This study collected assessment data from 445 children and 
developed and validated a perceptual restorative soundscapes scale for 
children using survey questionnaires and data analysis methods. 
Through hypothesis testing, the study explored the characteristics of 
children’s perception of restorative soundscapes. The results indicate 
that the reliability and validity of the scale are good. It was 
demonstrated that children’s perception of the acoustic environment 
is divided into two components, and soundscapes with more natural 
elements have greater restorative potential for children. A comparison 
with PRSS and PRCS-C revealed differences in children’s perception

Qin et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1362096
Frontiers in Psychology 16 frontiersin.orgof the acoustic environment compared to adults. Children may 
be more sensitive to the perception of restorative potential in similar 
environments, and their perception of acoustic environments differs 
from general environments. Unlike the assessment of general 
environments, there was no formation of a five-factor structure when 
evaluating acoustic environments. Therefore, developing a perceptual 
restorative soundscapes assessment scale specifically for children is of 
significant importance.
Using PRSS-C, children can significantly differentiate the 
restorative potential of soundscapes in different environmental types 
(urban peripheral forest areas, suburban areas, urban centers) and 
similar environments (botanical gardens, Temple of Heaven Park). 
This study is expected to contribute to the existing database on the 
characteristics of children’s soundscape perception, providing an 
effective assessment tool for studying children’s perception of 
restorative soundscapes.
Although this study successfully developed and validated the 
effectiveness of PRSS-C through two experiments, it still has certain 
limitations. Firstly, despite the high correlation between photo-
based judgments and on-site judgments in studies of environmental 
preference, and the extensive use of photos or videos as 
experimental stimuli in many studies ( Laumann et al., 2001 ; Payne, 
2013 ; Shu and Ma, 2018 ), considering that children’s perceptual 
restoration of sound scapes may differ from that of adults, it is 
necessary to conduct on-site research to enhance the experiential 
and immersive aspects of the environment. Secondly, PRSS-C did 
not form a five-factor structure for every component in FACE, and 
the cumulative variance percentage of the two-factor structure has 
not reached a satisfactory level. Therefore, further improvements to 
PRSS-C are necessary, such as extensively collecting children’s 
understanding of different scale items, increasing the number of 
items and sample size, etc. Lastly, because the focus of this study is 
on the development and validation of PRSS-C, there was no deeper 
exploration of individual factors such as age, gender, and family 
economic status on children’s perceptual restoration of soundscapes, 
as well as the effects of acoustic indicators such as sound level, 
reverberation time, loudness, sharpness, roughness, etc., on 
children’s perceptual restoration of soundscapes.
Given the limitations of this study, future research can further 
improve PRSS-C through methods such as on-site experiments and 
adding scale items, which will make PRSS-C a more scientifically 
effective tool for assessing children’s soundscapes. Furthermore, in 
future research, a deeper exploration of individual differences and the 
impact of acoustic indicators on children’s perceptual restoration of 
soundscapes can be conducted, which will assist architects, planners, 
and childhood educators in creating a conducive acoustic environment 
for children.Data availability statement
