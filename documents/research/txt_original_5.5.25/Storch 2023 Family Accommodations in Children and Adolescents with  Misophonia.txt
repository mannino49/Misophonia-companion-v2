Misophonia       2
Abstract
Family accommodation (e.g., reassurance, modifying routines, assisting avoidance) has not 
been explored among youth with misophonia but may have important clinical and 
intervention implications. We examined family accommodation in 102 children and 
adolescents with interview-confirmed misophonia and compared its frequency and content to 
family accommodation in 95 children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. Findings 
showed that family accommodation was ubiquitous in pediatric misophonia and may be even 
more frequent than in youth with anxiety disorders. Assisting the child, participating in 
misophonia-related behaviors, and modifying family routines were endorsed by more than 
70% of parents of children with misophonia. Further, compared to parents of children with 
anxiety disorders, parents of children with misophonia more frequently reported child distress 
and anger when they did not accommodate. Family accommodation was a moderate to strong 
predictor of misophonia severity even when accounting for co-occurring internalizing and 
externalizing symptoms and sociodemographic factors. This first study of family 
accommodation in pediatric misophonia suggests accommodation may be an important 
clinical feature oand a potential candidate to target in interventions.

Misophonia       3
Introduction
Misophonia is characterized by selective sound sensitivity to a variety of triggers 
(Swedo et al., 2021). Triggers may evoke anger, irritation, or disgust, and are avoided or 
endured with significant distress (Schröder, Vulink, & Denys, 2013). Common triggers 
include sounds from others breathing, eating, talking, or humming, and the distress is often 
exacerbated when triggered by family members or close friends (Schwartz, Leyendecker, & 
Conlon, 2011). The exact prevalence of misophonia is unclear (Wiese, Wojcik, & Storch, 
2021) with current estimates ranging from 6% to 20% (Naylor et al., 2021; Kılıç  et al., 2021; 
Wu et al., 2014; Zhou, Wu, & Storch, 2017; Yektatalab et al., 2022). While research has 
begun to show that individuals with misophonia often have psychiatric co-morbidities and 
that misophonia symptoms can cause substantial impairment (Claiborn et al., 2020; Rinaldi et 
al., 2022; Rosenthal et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2014; Yektatalab et al., 2022), less is known about 
the effects of misophonia on everyday life, especially in the context of children and their 
families. 
Family accommodation is characterized by the extent and manner in which family 
members take part in an individual's symptoms. This could include actions such as modifying 
behaviors, removing/reducing demands, and/or providing reassurance. While this has never 
been studied systematically in misophonia, family accommodation has been extensively 
studied in obsessive-compulsive and anxiety disorders, which are also characterized by 
heightened emotional reactions to specific stimuli (Iniesta-Sepulveda et al., 2021; Lebowitz, 
Panza, & Bloch, 2016; Kitt et al., 2022). A recent meta-analysis found that family 
accommodation for children with anxiety is very common (86-100%) with most parents 
endorsing daily accommodation (61-81%; Iniesta-Sepulveda et al., 2021). Rates of 
accommodation are similar among youth with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; Wu et 
al., 2016).  More family accommodation is associated with more severe symptoms in youth 
with anxiety and OCD (Lebowitz, Scharfstein, & Jones, 2014) and is with a poorer treatment 
response in OCD (Garcia et al., 2010; Peris et al., 2012). The extent of family accommodation 
in youth with misophonia has never been examined, but clinical accounts indicate that, similar 
to anxiety and OCD, family accommodation may be common (Wu et al., 2014).
Examining family accommodation among misophonic youth is important for several 
reasons. First, the causal link between accommodation and symptom maintenance has been 
well supported in the literature. While not in samples of individuals with misophonia, studies 
in adults with OCD and in children with anxiety and OCD have found that family 
accommodation may mediate the relation between symptom severity and functional 
impairment, although these results are based on cross-sectional results (La Buissonnière-Ariza 
et al., 2022; de Barros et al., 2020; Storch et al., 2007). Second, there are potential treatment 
implications, as accommodation is an important target in the treatment of anxiety and OCD in 
youth (Lebowitz et al., 2020; Peris et al., 2017). Third, accommodating the avoidance of 
triggers is likely to be a maintaining factor for misophonia and several case studies report 
family accommodation as a prominent feature of misophonia (Dover & McGuire, 2021; Wu 
& Banneyer, 2020; McGuire, Wu, & Storch, 2015; Johnson et al., 2013); further, preliminary 
reports suggest that reducing family accommodation may be beneficial (Wu & Banneyer, 
2020; Dover & McGuire, 2021). However, the only study to date about family 
accommodation in children with misophonia included only 4 participants (Johnson et al., 
2013), vastly limiting the current knowledge about family accommodation in pediatric 
misophonia.

Misophonia       4
When trying to elucidate the role of family accommodation in pediatric misophonia, 
the influence of co-occurring mental health problems needs to be considered. Psychiatric 
comorbidity is common in youth with misophonia (Guzick et al., 2023) and it may be that 
accommodation is only present or elevated in children struggling with other psychiatric 
symptoms as emotional outburst and aggressive responses may be more common among these 
children. 
The present study had three major aims. First, we sought to examine the incidence and 
extent of parent-reported accommodation of misophonia symptoms in children and 
adolescents with misophonia. Given the high incidence of symptom accommodation in other 
related conditions, we predicted similarly high rates of accommodation and we included a 
sample of youth with anxiety disorders for comparison. Second, to inform treatment 
development, we examined the frequency of specific accommodation behaviors (e.g., 
modification of family routines, avoiding activities) and again compared youth with 
misophonia to youth with anxiety disorders. No hypothesis was generated for this aim as this 
is the first systematic examination of family accommodation in misophonia. Third, we 
examined whether accommodation was associated with misophonia symptom severity (using 
both child- and parent-reports of misophonia) while accounting for co-occurring internalizing 
and externalizing symptoms. In line with the literature on pediatric anxiety and OCD, we 
predicted that family accommodation would be uniquely associated with the severity of 
misophonia. 
Method
Participants  
Participants included 211 subjects between 8-17 years of age with misophonia or 
anxiety symptoms. Participants were recruited through a multimedia approach including 
social media, stakeholder websites, electronic Listservs, referrals from health and mental 
health professionals, and flyers. Youth were categorized as having either misophonia or an 
anxiety disorder (AD). No participants in the anxiety disorder sample had clinically 
significant misophonia symptoms. Core inclusion criteria for both groups included: 1) child 8 
to 17 years of age, 2) fluent in English, 3) IQ > 70 as assessed using the KBIT, 4) no 
documented or suspected history of psychosis, and 5) not actively suicidal. Additional 
inclusion criteria for the misophonia group included a score ˃ 10 on the Amsterdam 
Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S), corresponding with moderate to severe symptoms (Schroder 
et al., 2013), as well as confirmation on the Misophonia Assessment Interview (Lewin et al., 
2021). Additional inclusion criteria for the anxiety disorder sample included: 1) a score ≤ 4 on 
the A-MISO-S, 2) met criteria for an anxiety disorder using the Mini International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview, Kid Version (MIN-KID, Sheehan et al., 2010), and 3) had 
elevated anxiety (T-score ≥ 60) assessed using the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for 
Children 2nd Edition Parent-Report (MASC-2, March, 2013). 
Of the 211 participants who originally provided consent, 14 participants (5 Anxiety 
participants and 9 Misophonia participants) were not assessed (i.e., could not be scheduled). 
For the misophonia group, of the 112 that were consented, 5 were found ineligible due to too 
low A-MISO scores, and 4 did not complete the entire study due to difficulty in scheduling. 
Our screen failure rate is relatively low in comparison to Naylor et al. as they recruited from a 
general sample. However, our study used a targeted recruitment approach to directly reach 
those with suspected misophonia. Analyses included 197 parent-child dyads across both 
groups with 102 subjects in the misophonia group (33.7% male, 67.6% female, 1.0% 
transgender male, 1.0% transgender female, 2.0% Other; mean age = 13.69 years, SD = 2.51 
years) and 95 subjects in the AD group (28.4% male, 57.9% female, 8.0% Other; mean age =

Misophonia       5
12.43 years, SD = 2.54 years). See Table 1 for participant information across the misophonia 
and AD groups. 
 
Procedure
Participants interested in the study were pre-screened for initial eligibility via 
telephone. After obtaining consent and assent, parent-child dyads took part in a virtual, 
remote assessment with a trained rater and completed several online self- and parent-report 
measures and tasks (not included in this report). Training of the rater included reviewing 
didactics of the MINI-KID, viewing videos of the MINI-KID, achieving concordance with a 
gold-standard rater, and finally completing administrations under supervision. Regular clinical 
supervision was held. The child/adolescent and parent were interviewed together for the 
Misophonia Diagnostic Interview and the MINI-KID. Participants were compensated $90 for 
their time.
 
Measures  
Family Accommodation Scale. The Family Accommodation Scale (FAS) is a 13-item 
parent-report measure related to participation in symptoms, modification of parental behaviors 
in response to symptoms, and associated distress and consequences. The scale used in this 
study was adapted from the Family Accommodation Scale–Anxiety (Lebowitz et al., 2013), 
itself an adaptation and modification of the Family Accommodation Scale for OCD 
(Calvocoressi et al., 1999), to reflect misophonia by changing the word “anxiety” to 
“misophonia” (e.g., “How often did you provide items needed due to their 
[anxiety/misophonia]?”). The internal consistency of the items of the FAS for misophonia was 
adequate ( a = .76) but somewhat lower for the 9 items examining specific areas of 
accommodating behaviors ( a = .67), indicating that accommodation behaviors in misophonia 
is a heterogeneous construct. Therefore, we examined not only the total score of the FAS, but 
also each item, which describes different areas of accommodation. 
Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children.  The Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview 
for Children (MINI-KID, Sheehan et al., 2010) is a structured, psychometrically validated, 
interviewer-administered transdiagnostic interview for youth. It assesses the presence of 24 
psychiatric disorders, the timeline of symptom presentation, and suicide risk. Clinicians have 
flexibility to probe further items to ascertain relevant clinical data to make diagnoses. 
Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S). The Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-
MISO-S) (Schroder et al., 2013) was used to measure overall misophonia severity. The A-
MISO-S is a 6-item, self-report assessment based on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive 
Scale (Y-BOCS) (Goodman et al., 1989) and assesses the time occupied by misophonia 
symptoms, interference, level of distress, effort to resist impulses, control over thoughts, and 
time avoiding misophonia situations over 1 week using a Likert Scale. Anchors for the Likert 
scale range from None to Extreme for the time occupied, interference, and distress items; 
Makes an effort to always resist to completely and willingly yields to all obsessions for the 
Resistance item; Complete to No control for the control over thoughts item; and No deliberate 
avoidance to Extreme, very extensive avoidance for the time avoiding misophonia situations 
item.  Scores can be characterized as subclinical (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), severe 
(15-19) or extreme (20-24) (Naylor et al., 2020; Rosenthal et al., 2021). This measure has 
demonstrated high internal consistency as well as good construct validity (Naylor et al., 
2020), but empirical work examining the scale in youth indicates that the item assessing effort 
to resist should be excluded (Cervin et al., under review). More specifically, this item did not 
load statistically significantly onto the broad single factor. The internal consistency of the 
remaining five items in the present misophonia sample was adequate ( a = .76)

Misophonia       6
Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ).  The MAQ is a 21-item measure with 
statements describing how sound sensitivities may affect the responder, including change of 
thoughts, feelings, behavior and effect on social life. The MAQ was used as a complementary 
measure of misophonia severity. In MAQ, responses range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (almost all 
of the time). Scores on each item are summed to assess severity of misophonia. Both parent 
and child versions of the MAQ were used in the present study. Previous work has shown that 
the MAQ has a 4-factor structure that together are valid indicators of overall misophonia 
severity (Cervin et al., 2022). The internal consistency of the items of the parent and child 
versions was excellent ( a = .93 and .94, respectively). Psychometric evaluations have showed 
that the MAQ assesses partly unique domains of misophonia severity compared to the A-
MISO-S (Cervin et al., 2022).
            Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The CBCL is a 113-item parent-report measure 
that assesses externalizing and internalizing behaviors in children. Subscales assess broad 
externalizing and internalizing symptoms, as well as social problems, anxious/depressed 
symptoms, and aggressive behavior. In the present study, we examined the broadband scales 
of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and raw scores were used. The internal 
consistency of the items of the internalizing and externalizing scales was good (αs = .89 for 
each subscale).
Data Analysis
All analyses were conducted in SPSS version 27. To compare scores across the 
misophonia and AD groups, we used independent samples t-tests for continuous variables 
(age, FAS total score), Mann-Whitney U tests for ordinal variables (FAS item scores), and 
chi-square tests for frequencies (gender, weekly accommodation). Further, to account for the 
presence of anxiety disorders in the misophonia sample, we divided the misophonia sample 
into those with and without anxiety disorders and compared the two groups on family 
accommodation. To examine whether accommodation was associated with misophonia 
severity, we ran multivariable linear regression models with A-MISO-S and MAQ as the 
dependent variables. An a priori  decision was made to account for age and gender in these 
models and we also accounted for internalizing and externalizing symptoms (CBCL). An 
alpha level of .05 was used as an indicator of statistical significance in all models. We did not 
adjust the alpha since this is the first major study of accommodation in youth with 
misophonia, since we reported all outcomes, analyzed partially associated outcome variables 
and did not test a universal null hypothesis.
Results
Preliminary Analyses
Participants in the misophonia group were statistically significantly older than those in 
the AD group (t [195] = 3.49, p < .001). There was no statistically significant difference in the 
proportion self-identifying as girls across groups.
Frequency of Family Accommodation
In Table 2 are scores for each behavioral accommodation domain rated as part of the 
FAS, the FAS total score, and the frequency in each group reporting at least weekly 
accommodation (an item score of 2 or above). Parents of youth with anxiety disorders 
reported significantly more reassurance than parents of youth with misophonia. Conversely, 
parents of youth with misophonia reported higher scores and more weekly accommodation for 
(1) participating in behaviors related to the child’s difficulties, (2) assisting the child in 
avoiding things that might make him/her exhibit symptoms, (3) avoiding activities, and (4)

Misophonia       7
modifying family routines. The misophonia group also had a higher score for providing items 
needed due to the child’s difficulties, but the frequency of weekly accommodation was not 
statistically significantly different between the groups for this item. For the four FAS items 
assessing distress and consequences, non-parametric group comparisons indicated that parents 
of children with misophonia experienced that their child became distressed or angry/abusive 
when the parent did not provide assistance significantly more frequently than parents of 
children with anxiety disorders. The misophonia group also had a statistically significantly 
higher total FAS score ( p < .001) and the difference corresponded to a moderate to large 
effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.84 [0.54 – 1.13]).
A large majority of families in both groups showed at least weekly accommodation for 
one of the assessed accommodation areas (misophonia: 98.0%; AD: 90.5%) and the 
difference in frequency across groups was statistically significant. Weekly accommodation for 
at least three of the assessed accommodation areas was also common (misophonia: 81.4%; 
AD: 56.8%) and again the difference in frequency across groups was statistically significant.
Accommodation was negatively correlated to age in the misophonia group (r = -.24, p = 
.01), indicating that there was more accommodation for younger children. Accommodation 
did not differ statistically significantly between those self-identifying as girls versus those 
self-identifying as boys (t [95] = 0.28, p = .87).
Fifty-three (51.5%) of the children and adolescents with misophonia also met criteria 
for one or more anxiety disorders. Those with an anxiety disorder ( M = 37.81 [10.65]) did not 
show significantly different scores on accommodation compared to those without an anxiety 
disorder ( M = 36.03 [8.07]; t[99] = 0.94, p = .35).
Accommodation and Misophonia Severity. 
To examine associations between accommodation and misophonia severity, we only 
analyzed data from the misophonia sample. Zero-order Pearson correlations showed that 
accommodation was not significantly correlated with internalizing symptoms ( r = .16, p = 
.12), but there was a significant correlation with externalizing symptoms ( r = .29, p = .003).
A linear regression model with misophonia severity (A-MISO-S) as the dependent 
variable and accommodation (FAS total score), age, and gender (girl/boy) as independent 
variables was conducted. The model was statistically significant ( p < .001) and the 
independent variables explained 21.5% of the variance in misophonia severity. The 
statistically significant predictors were family accommodation ( β = 0.50, p < .001) and age ( β 
= 0.22, p < .001). A model that included accommodation, internalizing symptoms, 
externalizing symptoms, age, and gender as independent variables and misophonia severity as 
the dependent variable (A-MISO-S) was statistically significant ( p < .001) and explained 
23.4% of the variation in misophonia severity. Accommodation ( β = 0.46, p < .001) and age 
(β = 0.27, p = .009) were the only significant predictors.
A model with the child-reported MAQ total score as the dependent variable and 
accommodation, age, and gender as independent variables was statistically significant ( p < 
.001) and explained 23.5% of the variance in the child-reported MAQ score. All independent 
variables were statistically significant predictors: accommodation ( β = .39, p < .001), age ( β = 
.35, p < .001), and gender (boy vs girl, β = -.20, p = .028). A model that included 
accommodation, internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, age, and gender as 
independent variables was also statistically significant ( p < .001) and explained 26.1% of the

Misophonia       8
variation in misophonia severity. Accommodation ( β = 0.34, p < .001) and age ( β = 0.31, p = 
.002) and internalizing symptoms ( β = 0.21, p = .045) were significant predictors.
A model with the parent-reported MAQ as the dependent variable and accommodation, 
age, and gender as independent variables was also statistically significant ( p < .01) and 
explained 11.7% of the variance in the parent-reported MAQ score; the only statistically 
significant predictor was accommodation ( β = .32, p < .01). A model that included 
accommodation, internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, age, and gender as 
independent variables was also statistically significant ( p = .004) and explained 12.6% of the 
variation in misophonia severity. Accommodation ( β = 0.28, p = .009) was the only 
significant predictor.
Discussion
This study is the first to examine family accommodation in youth with misophonia. 
Rates of accommodation were significantly higher in misophonic youth relative to youth with 
anxiety disorders overall, and in several specific behaviors including participating in 
behaviors related to the child’s difficulties, assisting the child in avoiding things that might 
make him/her exhibit symptoms, avoiding activities, and modifying family routines. Families 
with misophonic youth were significantly more likely to accommodate in at least three 
different ways per week compared to anxiety disorder controls. There were increased 
instances of accommodating relative to anxious youth by providing additional items to help 
the distressed child. Parents of children with misophonia were also more likely than parents of 
anxious children to report their child becoming distressed or angry when the parent did not 
provide assistance. These data suggest the impact misophonia has on family functioning and 
may reflect efforts of family members to support or foster adaptive living of the affected 
child, especially in younger children, for whom accommodation rates were highest. 
Accommodation, however, may have problematic secondary consequences by limiting 
engagement in important life activities, reinforcing problematic and maladaptive behavioral 
responses to stressors, and lowered ability to regulate emotions. 
Family accommodation is a key target in psychological therapy for OCD and anxiety 
(Lebowitz et al., 2020; Peris et al., 2017). The frequency and impact of accommodation in 
pediatric misophonia indicated in this study suggest it could be a similarly critical target in 
psychological treatment development for youth with misophonia. For example, reducing 
avoidance of triggers and provision of tangible items are likely important clinical targets 
given their reinforcing nature. Encouraging misophonic youth to align their values with 
actions may be one method of reducing avoidance. Similarly, helping parents develop 
methods of verbally (i.e., supporting adaptive actions) or tangibly (e.g., reward systems) 
supporting their child besides taking on responsibilities for providing assistance/items or 
modifying routines may be useful. It is important to note that our findings suggest that the 
specific targets in treatment may differ somewhat between misophonic versus anxious youth. 
Reducing the degree to which families support avoidance, modify family routines, or assist 
with daily activities may be particularly salient for misophonic youth, whereas reassurance 
seeking may be a salient target for anxious youth.   
Consistent with findings in childhood OCD and anxiety (Iniesta-Sepúlveda et al., 
2021; Lebowitz et al., 2012, 2016; Stewart et al., 2008; Storch et al., 2007), higher levels of 
family accommodation were associated with increased misophonia symptom severity. This 
finding was robust across three assessments of misophonia severity and remained when 
controlling for other relevant variables, including co-occurring internalizing and externalizing

Misophonia       9
symptoms, age, and gender. These findings suggest that as the child’s misophonia increases in 
severity, family members are more likely to engage in accommodating actions to mitigate the 
child’s distress. We expect that this relationship is bidirectional, in that accommodation does 
not allow a child to develop effective independent strategies to manage or overcome triggers, 
which should be investigated in future work. Somewhat surprisingly, externalizing behaviors 
were only weakly related to family accommodation and not a significant predictor of 
misophonia severity when accommodation was accounted for, suggesting that there is a 
particularly strong link between misophonia severity and accommodation. The frequency of 
accommodation, intense anger or distress when accommodation is not provided, and the 
observation that accommodation is associated with symptom severity suggest that children 
with misophonia experience difficulty self-regulating emotions when faced with triggers and 
instead rely on (or demand that) family members make changes to minimize exposure to 
triggers. It will be important for interventions to consider how to both address accommodation 
as well as to provide methods for the child to cope with distressing triggers.  
There are several study limitations.  First, the sample was predominantly Caucasian 
and the caregiver completing the parent forms was predominantly the mother. Second, the 
sample of youth with misophonia responded to advertisements specific to this condition and 
may represent those with more severe presentations. Third, the study was cross-sectional in 
nature, which precludes directional inferences. Fourth, the A-MISO-S has several 
psychometric limitations including the lack of a clearly established cut-off point and clarity on 
the optimal method of administration (self-report versus clinician administered). Fifth, the 
present study used an existing measure of accommodation revised for misophonia symptoms; 
however, as evidenced by the modest internal consistency of the scale, modifications may be 
in order with regards to item content (e.g., specificity of reassurance, nature of family 
modifications). Finally, given the early nature of this work, no statistical correction was used.
Within these limitations, this study has several implications. First, the importance of 
considering family accommodation when assessing youth with misophonia is highlighted 
given the frequency of occurrence and its clear association with severity. Indeed, specific 
familial behaviors may be maintaining maladaptive behavioral patterns and compound 
impairment. Future research should focus on optimal ways of engaging parents of youth with 
misophonia in treatment and examine whether reducing accommodation results in 
improvement in symptoms and impairment. Second, like in other psychological conditions 
(e.g., anxiety disorders, OCD), the present study suggests that family accommodation may be 
a mechanistic target for maintaining symptoms, which should be incorporated into emerging 
conceptual models of misophonia.  Interventions that include components targeting 
maintaining variables, such as accommodation, as well as components that help the child 
develop abilities to effectively cope with and overcome misophonic triggers are advised.
