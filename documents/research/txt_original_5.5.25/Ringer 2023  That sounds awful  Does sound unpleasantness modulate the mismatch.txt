There are sounds that most people perceive as highly unpleasant, for instance, the sound of rubbing pieces of polystyrene together. Previous research showed larger physiological and neural responses for such aversive compared to neutral sounds.  Hitherto,  it  remains  unclear  whether  habituation,  i.e.,  diminished  responses to repeated stimulus presentation, which is typically reported for neutral sounds, occurs to the same extent for aversive stimuli. We measured the mismatch negativity (MMN) in response to rare occurrences of aversive or neutral deviant sounds within an auditory oddball sequence in 24 healthy participants, while they performed a demanding visual distractor task. Deviants occurred as single events (i.e., between two standards) or as double deviants (i.e., repeating the identical deviant sound in two consecutive trials). All deviants elicited a clear MMN, and amplitudes were larger for aversive than for neutral deviants (irrespective of their position within a deviant pair). This supports the claim of preattentive emotion evaluation during early auditory processing. In contrast to our expectations, MMN amplitudes did not show habituation, but increased in response to deviant repetition-  similarly for aversive and neutral deviants. A more fine-  grained  analysis  of  individual  MMN  amplitudes  in  relation  to  individual

arousal and valence ratings of each sound item revealed that stimulus-  specific MMN amplitudes were best predicted by the interaction of deviant position and perceived arousal, but not by valence. Deviants with perceived higher arousal elicited larger MMN amplitudes only at the first deviant position, indicating that the MMN reflects preattentive processing of the emotional content of sounds.

## 1 | INTRODUCTION

Human experience and behavior are inextricably linked to  emotions.  Emotions  are  widely  assumed  to  govern the preparation  of  appropriate  behavioral  reactions in  a  given  situation,  thus  rendering  fast  and  effective emotional  evaluation  evolutionarily  adaptive  (Bradley &amp;  Lang,  2002).  Across  sensory  modalities,  emotional stimuli  have  been  found  to  evoke  a  variety  of  characteristic responses,  including  physiological  reactions, behaviors, and feelings (Bradley &amp; Lang, 2002). In the auditory domain, unpleasant sounds (such as scraping sounds,  animal  cries,  or  angry  voices)  are  known  to elicit an enlarged startle reflex, increased skin conductance,  enhanced  heart  rate  deceleration,  and  stronger muscle  activity  (Bradley  &amp;  Lang,  2000).  Furthermore, unpleasant sounds are recalled more readily compared to  neutral  or  pleasant  sounds  (Bradley  &amp;  Lang,  2000). Among unpleasant auditory experiences, certain sounds are  perceived  as  particularly  discomforting  by  most people,  such  as,  for  instance,  the  sound  of  fingernails scraping across a chalkboard or rubbing two pieces of polystyrene  together  (Cox,  2008;  Halpern  et  al.,  1986; Schweiger  Gallo  et  al.,  2017).  The  discomfort  induced by  these,  henceforth  called  aversive  sounds,  has  been related  to  specific  acoustic  properties  such  as  a  high spectral  frequency  and  rather  little  temporal  modulation  (Kumar  et  al.,  2008).  Such  aversive  sounds  elicit a  distinctive  pattern  of  heart  rate  responses  compared to other unpleasant, pleasant and neutral sounds (Schweiger Gallo et al., 2017). On the neural level, they activate the amygdala, reflecting the sound's association with negative emotions, and are (in comparison to neutral sounds) accompanied by higher activity in auditory cortex regions (Kumar et al., 2012). In the current study, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to compare brain responses and their habituation characteristics between such aversive sounds and sounds with neutral valence that are embedded as infrequent 'deviant' sounds in an oddball paradigm while participants do not pay attention to the sound input.

The  emotional  valence  of  sounds  is  very  likely  evaluated  automatically  during  early  processing  steps  (e.g., Paulmann &amp; Kotz, 2008; Schirmer et al., 2005). From other research, we know that the auditory system automatically detects and exploits regularities in the auditory environment. Specifically, the mismatch negativity (MMN) as a component of the auditory event-  related potential (ERP) is often used as a measure to tap into this automatic, preattentive auditory processing (for reviews see, e.g., Escera &amp; Malmierca, 2014; Näätänen et al., 2007; Schröger, 2005). MMN is typically studied in auditory oddball paradigms, which present  participants  with  a  sequence  of  frequent 'standard'  sounds  randomly  interspersed  with  infrequent, unexpected 'deviant' sounds that differ from the standards in terms of some acoustic feature. The MMN is a  characteristic  frontocentral  negativity  that  is  observed in the difference of the deviant minus standard ERP between 100 ms and 250 ms relative to deviance onset, often accompanied by a polarity reversal at bilateral mastoids (Näätänen et al., 1978, 2007; Schröger, 2005). MMN has been  argued  to  result  from  a  mismatch  between  anticipated and actual auditory input, with the anticipated input stemming from an internal model of the environment that was extracted from the regularities in stimulation and used to predict upcoming sensory events (Näätänen et al., 2007; Schröger, 2005). We use MMN as a tool to study the processing of aversive and neutral sounds that deviate from the regular auditory environment.

As  supported  by  various  studies,  the  magnitude  of the MMN elicited by a deviant is sensitive to the affective content of the eliciting sound. Most of these studies used voices (that pronounced a specific syllable) as stimuli that were arranged in typical oddball sequences, with deviants differing from the standards with respect to  their  emotional  valence  in  pronunciation.  For  example, the MMN amplitudes were enhanced for angry compared to neutral deviants and correlated with physiological  arousal  in  terms  of  heart  rate  acceleration, which indicated that the MMN amplitude is modulated by  the  deviants'  (emotional)  relevance  for  the  listener (Schirmer &amp; Escoffier, 2010). Chen et al. (2016) reported

MMN amplitudes in response to fearful deviant syllables within  a  sequence  of  happy  standard  syllables  during both wakefulness and all stages of sleep, whereas nonvocal control stimuli elicited MMN only in wakefulness and sleep stage 3, which corroborates the proposed automaticity  of  an  emotional  change  detection  reflected by  the  MMN.  Furthermore,  the  increased  MMN  amplitudes  for  deviants  that  differ  from  the  standards  in terms of their emotional valence occur in particular for certain emotions: When comparing angry and happy deviants among neutral standards, angry deviants consistently evoked a larger MMN than happy deviants even in  the  absence  of  attention  to  the  stimulation,  which indicates a processing bias towards negative emotional information  (Chen  et  al.,  2018).  Likewise,  disgusted (compared to happy) deviants in a sequence of neutral standards were associated with activation of the anterior insula, a brain region implicated in negative emotional experience (Chen et al., 2014). The finding that MMN amplitudes were increased and MMN latencies were decreased specifically for fearful (compared to happy, sad and neutral) voices further supports a susceptibility of the MMN to processing negative emotional content and suggests that emotional stimuli with a special relevance from an evolutionary perspective are processed preferentially  (Carminati  et  al.,  2018).  Notably,  the  authors found that the amplitudes were also largest for fearful voices during the subsequent P3a time window (Carminati  et  al.,  2018).  P3a  is  often  observed  in  response  to deviant or novel sounds in auditory oddball paradigms and is commonly associated with an involuntary shift of attention  towards  unexpected,  distracting  stimuli  (see, e.g., Escera et al., 1998; Polich, 2007).

To the best of our knowledge, only Czigler et al. (2007) examined electrophysiological responses to aversive  (compared  to  neutral)  environmental  sounds other  than  voices  presented  as  deviants.  Participants were  instructed  to  detect  targets  (differing  in  pitch) within a stream of pure tones that also contained the deviants. While both aversive and neutral deviants evoked a broadly distributed negativity between around 150 ms and  250 ms  after  stimulus  onset,  amplitudes  were  significantly  larger  for  aversive  than  for  neutral  deviants (Czigler et al., 2007).

The  studies  cited  so  far  provide  evidence  that  an initial evaluation of a sound's emotional content takes place  during  early  auditory  processing  and  tends  to be  biased  in  favor  of  negative  emotional  information. However,  certain  aspects  regarding  the  processing  of aversive sounds have not yet been addressed in the literature. Specifically, it remains unclear which of the orthogonal dimensions of valence and arousal, commonly used to classify emotions (Bradley &amp; Lang, 2000; Posner

et  al.,  2005;  Russell,  1980),  drives  the  preferential processing  of  aversive  stimuli:  a  sound's  unpleasantness (i.e., its valence) or rather the associated arousal. We address this issue by taking into account our participants' individual valence and arousal ratings of the stimuli we presented.

Besides the emotional valence, the repetition of a deviant remarkably influences MMN magnitude. EEG studies  have  typically  shown  diminished  MMN  in  response to  repeated  deviants,  that  is,  deviants  directly  following another  deviant  (e.g.,  Müller  &amp;  Schröger,  2007;  Müller et al., 2005a, 2005b; Sams et al., 1984). This effect is presumably related to the well-  established  phenomenon  of habituation: a decrease in neural response to a repeatedly presented  stimulus.  Habituation  enables  effective  processing  of  novel  and  potentially  more  relevant  sensory events (Müller et al., 2005b). Importantly, habituation of the MMN magnitude was only observed when the two deviants that occurred in a row carried the same stimulus feature  (e.g.,  frequency;  Nousak  et  al.,  1996),  and  when they were grouped into the same auditory stream (Müller et al., 2005a) or tone pair (Müller &amp; Schröger, 2007). Critically, the MMN amplitude reduction was maximal in response to a repeated deviant that was identical to the first one (Müller et al., 2005b). A similar effect was reported for the subsequent P3a, which was considerably reduced following an identical, but not following a non-  identical deviant repetition (Rosburg et al., 2018).

In  short,  MMN  amplitudes  underlie  habituation  if deviants are repeated in directly consecutive trials, especially  if  the  repeated  deviants  are  identical.  However,  it remains unexplored whether deviant repetition effects interact with the emotional content of the repeated deviant, especially its unpleasantness. Since emotional, especially aversive  or  painful  stimuli,  may  carry  relevant  information about potential threats that require a prompt adaptive response, it is plausible to assume that habituation is suppressed for this kind of stimuli compared to emotionally neutral stimuli. For instance, previous studies in the visual domain reported diminished habituation of N1 amplitudes for negative compared to positive or neutral pictures (Carretié et al., 2003), reduced habituation (signaled by the absence of the typical inhibition-  of-  return effect) for  angry  compared  to  happy  or  neutral  faces  (PérezDueñas et al., 2014), and decreased adaptation of steadystate  visual-  evoked  potential  amplitudes  to  face  identity for fearful compared to happy or neutral faces (Gerlicher et al., 2014). Hence, one could expect a similar suppression of habituation also for sounds that are particularly aversive in nature and potential carriers of threat-  related information.

Therefore,  we  examined  potential  habituation  effects to aversive auditory events during early processing

stages, as reflected in the MMN. Beyond replicating the effects  of  deviant  unpleasantness  and  deviant  repetition  on  MMN  amplitudes,  which  have  been  studied separately  so  far,  we  aimed  to  investigate  potential interaction  effects  of  these  factors.  Participants  were presented with oddball sequences that contained naturalistic environmental sounds as deviants that were either of aversive or of neutral emotional valence among white noise standards. Deviants occurred as single deviants  (following  and  preceding  a  standard  sound)  or as  deviant  pairs  (the  same  deviant  presented  in  two consecutive  trials).  This  allowed  us  to  measure  ERPs depending  on  the  position  within  deviant  pairs,  i.e., the effect of habituation, while at the same time controlling for physical stimulus differences. In accordance with earlier findings, we expected (a) enhanced MMN amplitudes in response to aversive as compared to neutral  deviants  (effect  of  emotion),  and  (b)  decreased MMN amplitudes in response to deviants in the second as compared to the first position in a deviant pair (habituation). The higher emotional relevance of aversive relative to neutral sounds would render habituation to these sounds evolutionarily maladaptive. Hence, critically, we assumed (c) habituation effects only for neutral, but not or to a lesser extent for aversive deviants. Importantly, we also explored the relationship between participants'  valence  and  arousal  ratings  of  all  sound items that occurred as deviants and MMN amplitudes at  the  item-  and  participant-  level.  This  allowed  us  to disentangle whether potential differences between the emotional  categories  were  driven  by  the  stimulus  valence or rather by the associated arousal.

## 2 | METHODS

## 2.1 | Participants

A  total  of N = 24  participants  (21  female,  three  male) took  part  in  the  experiment,  most  of  them  being  undergraduate psychology students at Leipzig University (Germany).  They  were  between  18  and  39 years  old ( M = 22.46 years, SD = 4.89 years), all of them were righthanded, and reported normal or corrected-  to-  normal vision, normal hearing, and no history of any neurological or psychiatric disorder. Data from all tested participants were  included  in  the  analysis.  All  participants  were naïve regarding the purpose of the experiment and gave written informed consent before the testing started. Experimental  procedures  were  performed  in  accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and subjects received either course credits or monetary compensation (8€/hr) for their participation.

## 2.2 | Stimulation

## 2.2.1 | Auditory oddball sequences

Auditory  stimuli  were  delivered  binaurally  via  headphones (Sennheiser HD-  25-  1 II, Sennheiser GmbH &amp; Co. KG,  Germany)  at  approximately  72 dB  SPL.  The  auditory oddball sequences consisted of standard and deviant sounds, each of which had a duration of 300 ms. Stimulus  onset  asynchrony  (SOA)  between  two  consecutive sounds was jittered  between  500 ms  and  1000 ms  (in  10 steps of 50 ms) around a mean SOA of 750 ms. Gaussian white noise served as a standard stimulus, which occurred in 80% of the auditory trials. Deviants were presented in the remaining 20% of the trials and differed with regard to  their  emotional  valence  (unpleasantness),  such  that half of them were neutral and the other half of them were aversive.

Deviants were drawn from a pool of 18 different environmental sounds, which had been selected in a pre-  test. In  this  pre-  test,  a  different  group  of  participants  rated the unpleasantness for overall 75 environmental sounds, including  natural  sounds  (such  as  sounds  of  birds  or water),  but  also,  for  instance,  cries,  metal  scraping,  or styrofoam  squeezing  sounds.  Based  on  these  ratings and the sounds' characteristics regarding the parameter space of the modeled auditory cortex representation (see Shamma,  2003),  we  selected  a  subset  of  18  soundsnine aversive and nine neutral ones. These stimuli were chosen on the criteria of maximizing differences in unpleasantness ratings between the two categories, while minimizing differences regarding the dominant spectral and  temporal  modulation  frequencies  in  the  modeled auditory  representations,  particularly  when  sound  duration was trimmed to shorter values (i.e., 300 ms). All stimuli  were  matched  in  terms  of  loudness,  using  the model by Glasberg and Moore for time-  varying sounds (Glasberg &amp; Moore, 2002).

Stimuli were arranged in oddball sequences such that the  sequence  of  standards  was  randomly  interspersed with  deviants.  The  latter  either  occurred  as  single  deviants,  i.e.,  between  two  standards,  or  as  double  deviants, i.e., as a pair of deviants presented in two directly successive trials (see Figure 1). Each of the 18 deviant sounds occurred equally often as a single and as a double deviant. Note that the two deviants within a double deviant pair were always identical, and randomization was  restricted  such  that  the  second  deviant  in  a  pair was always followed by a standard (i.e., no triple deviants  occurred).  Furthermore, single deviants and double deviants were presented equally often, leading to a 50% probability for either a standard or another (identical)  deviant following the first deviant after a row of

FIGURE 1 Schematic display of concurrent visual and auditory stimulus sequences presented to the participants. In the visual sequence (top of the figure), a white square probe occurred for 150 ms randomly at one of eight possible positions (dark gray frames) every 1500 ms. Concurrently, but unrelated to the visual task, a sequence of 300-  ms sounds (bottom of figure) was presented with an SOA jittered between 500 and 1000 ms (in 10 steps). A white noise token (black) was presented in 80% of the auditory trials (standard sound), whereas occasionally either an aversive (purple) or a neutral (green) deviant sound was presented, either in isolation (single deviant) or as a pair (double deviant). The figure shows an example of an aversive double deviant preceded by three standard sounds and a neutral single deviant preceded by two standard sounds. Participants were instructed to focus on a visual 2-  back task and to ignore the sounds. (Please note that spatial and temporal proportions were slightly adapted in the figure to improve the visibility).

standards. In short, we manipulated deviants in terms of their unpleasantness (neutral vs. aversive) and position (first  vs.  second  position  within  a  pair),  with  all  types of  deviants  occurring  within  the  same  experimental blocks.

## 2.2.2 | Visual 2-  back distractor task

Visual stimuli were presented on a computer screen (Iiyama HM903DT A, Iiyama North America, Inc.) located outside  a  shielded  cabin  behind  a  window  at  approximately  80 cm  distance  from  the  participants'  eyes.  The display  consisted  of  a  white  fixation  cross  (width  and height: 0.37° visual angle) in the center of the screen and eight black-  squared frames (width and height: 0.50° visual angle) arranged in a circle around the fixation cross (radius: 2.11° visual angle) at equal distance from each other on a gray background.

During  each  visual  trial,  a  white  square  appeared randomly at one of the eight frame positions for 150 ms.

Subjects were asked to fixate the central cross and to compare  the  position  of  the  white  square  to  the  position  of the white square two trials before (i.e., 2-  back). They were instructed to press a button whenever they detected a 2back target, that is, when the position of the square in the current trial matched the position of the square two trials before (see Figure 1). The SOA for the appearance of the white squares was set to 1500 ms. 2-  back targets occurred randomly in 15% of the visual trials, with the only restriction that each 2-  back target was followed by at least two non-  target trials.

## 2.3 | Procedure

During  the  EEG  experiment,  participants  sat  inside  a soundproof  and  electrically  shielded  cabin.  Stimulus presentation was  controlled using the Psychophysics  Toolbox  extension  (PTB-  3;  Brainard,  1997;  Kleiner et al., 2007) in Matlab (version R2016a; The MathWorks Inc.,  USA).  Participants'  button  presses  were  captured

|

with a response time box (Suzhou Litong Electronic Co., China). Before the start of the actual experiment, participants had the chance to familiarize themselves with the visual task.

Trials were arranged in 16 blocks. Each block lasted approximately 3.4 min and comprised 270 auditory trials (54 deviant and 216 standard sounds, corresponding to 20% and 80% of the trials, respectively) and 140 visual trials. Thus, over the course of all blocks, each of the 18 deviant sounds was presented 24 times, 8 times as a single deviant and 8 times as a double deviant (with each double deviant corresponding to two sound presentations, respectively). In the first 4 s of each block, only visual stimuli were presented in order to engage participants in the visual distractor task before the auditory sequence started, which they had been instructed to ignore. Auditory and visual trials were neither temporally synchronized nor otherwise systematically related. Detection performance for visual targets was assessed via hit and false alarm rates and reaction times  for  correct  responses  to  check  participants'  attention towards the task. We used hit and false alarm rates to compute the sensitivity index d ' , defined as the difference of the inverse normal transforms of hit rate minus false alarm rate (corrected using the so-  called log-  linear transform, see: Hautus &amp; Lee, 2006).

After the EEG experiment, we asked participants to rate the auditory stimuli regarding their valence and arousal on  9-  point  Likert  scales  using  self-  assessment  manikins (SAM; Bradley &amp; Lang, 1994). The valence scale ranged from 1 = very negative to  9 = very positive and the arousal scale ranged from 1 = not aroused at all to 9 = very aroused . The  18  deviant  stimuli  and  the  standard  stimulus  were presented in random order four times, such that valence ratings were obtained in the first two runs and arousal ratings in the last two runs.

## 2.4 | EEG data acquisition

During the experiment, EEG data were recorded continuously from 32 Ag/AgCl active electrodes mounted in an elastic cap according to the extended 10-  20 system with the following electrode positions: FP1, FP2, AF3, AF4, Fz, F3, F4, F7, F8, FC1, FC2, FC5, FC6, Cz, C3, C4, T7, T8, CP1, CP2, CP5, CP6, Pz, P3, P4, P7, P8, PO3, PO4, Oz, O1, and O2. Additionally, signals were recorded from left and right mastoids (M1, M2) and from electrodes placed on the outer canthus of each eye and above and below the right eye (horizontal and vertical electrooculogram). One electrode on the tip of the nose served for later offline referencing. Online high-  pass and low-  pass filters were applied during recording, attenuating frequencies below 0.16 Hz and  above  100 Hz,  respectively.  Signals  (referenced  to the  CMS-  DRL  ground)  were  amplified  with  a  BioSemi ActiveTwo amplifier (BioSemi B.V., Amsterdam, Netherlands) and digitized with a sampling rate of 512 Hz.

## 2.5 | EEG data processing and statistical analysis

EEG  data  were  processed  offline  in  Matlab  (version R2018b,  The  MathWorks  Inc.,  USA)  with  the  EEGLAB toolbox (version 15.0.1; Delorme &amp; Makeig, 2004). Statistical  analyses  were  conducted in RStudio (version 4.0.1; R Core Team, 2020). After pre-  processing, we determined and  compared  MMN latencies,  and  analyzed  the  MMN amplitudes in two ways: First, to identify the overall effects  of  deviant  unpleasantness  and  position,  we  compared amplitudes category-  wise between deviants priorly categorized as neutral or aversive that occurred at the first position (following a standard) or at the second position (following a deviant). Second, we evaluated the relationship between stimulus-  specific ratings of deviant sounds (in terms of their valence and arousal) and the amplitude of the MMN they elicit when presented at the first or second position.

## 2.5.1 | Preprocessing

Data were referenced to the electrode located on the tip of  the  nose  and  high-  pass  filtered  at  0.2 Hz  (transition bandwidth: 0.4 Hz, Kaiser beta: 5.65) and low-  pass filtered at  35 Hz (transition bandwidth: 10 Hz, Kaiser beta: 5.65) with  Kaiser-  windowed  sinc  finite  impulse  response  filters. We cut the filtered continuous data into epochs that ranged from -100 ms to 500 ms relative to the onset of an auditory stimulus, and baseline-  corrected them to the 100 ms interval before sound onset. Epochs corresponding to the first sound that occurred directly after a visual target as well as to standard sounds following a deviant were not included in the analysis. Additionally, any epoch with a peak-  to-  peak difference exceeding 150 μ V for at least one electrode  was  discarded  from  the  analysis  (on  average 13.9% of the epochs).

## 2.5.2 | Category-  wise MMN analysis

After pre-  processing, we averaged the remaining epochs within each participant, separately for standards, and for neutral  and  aversive  deviants  at  the  first  position  after a  standard  (including  both  single  deviants  and  deviants at  the  first  position  of  a  deviant  pair,  because  they  take functionally  indistinguishable  roles)  and  at  the  second

position within a deviant pair, respectively. We computed difference  waveforms  by  subtracting  the  standard  ERP from the deviant ERP for each of the four deviant types (aversive/neutral × first/second  position).  We  extracted individual  MMN peak latencies-  defined as the latency of the minimum within a time window that ranged from 100 ms  to  250 ms  after  stimulus  onset-  from  the  difference waveforms at electrode Fz for each deviant type. We statistically  compared  the  extracted  MMN  latencies  between the conditions using a repeated-  measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the two-  level factors Unpleasantness (neutral vs. aversive) and Position (first vs. second position). Mauchly's test of sphericity was used to check whether the  assumption  of  sphericity  was  fulfilled,  and non-  sphericity  (as  indicated  by  a  significant  Mauchly's test with p &lt; .05) was automatically corrected by applying Greenhouse-  Geisser correction.

Subsequently, we computed grand averages across participants from the single-  subject difference waveforms for the four deviant types (using the grandaverage plugin for EEGLAB, authored by Andreas Widmann, https://github. com/widma  nn/grand  average). We determined time windows for the statistical analysis of MMN amplitudes based on the MMN peak latencies in the grand average difference waveforms, again at electrode Fz and within a time window from 100 ms to 250 ms relative to stimulus onset. MMN latencies were shorter for deviants at the first position (neutral: 129 ms; aversive: 121 ms) than for deviants at the second position (neutral: 146 ms; aversive: 156 ms). Therefore,  we  defined  position-  specific  40 ms  time  windows centred around the mean peak latency across deviant unpleasantness levels for the first and second position, respectively.  Specifically,  MMN  time  windows  ranged from 105 ms to  145 ms  for  deviants  at  the  first  position, and from 131 ms to 171 ms for deviants at the second position. From these time windows, we extracted mean amplitudes at electrodes Fz, M1, and M2 for each subject for each of the four deviant types. To capture the strength of the whole dipole associated with the typical frontocentral negativity and mastoidal positivity, we subtracted the average of the amplitudes at M1 and M2 from the amplitude at  Fz.  Following  this,  we  submitted  the  resulting  mean MMN amplitudes to a  repeated-  measures  ANOVA  with the two-  level factor unpleasantness (neutral vs. aversive) and position (first vs. second position).

## 2.5.3 | Stimulus-  wise MMN analysis

We used linear mixed models (built with the lmer function of the lm4 package in RStudio; Bates et al., 2015) to predict  MMN amplitudes as a function of the stimulusspecific ratings of the respective deviant sound (in terms

of its valence and arousal) and its position. This approach allowed to model fixed effects of the predictors while controlling for random variance by including random effects (e.g.,  from  random  intersubject  variance)  in  the  model. Hence, we included participants as a random effect in all our models. Valence and arousal ratings for each stimulus  were averaged across the two runs within each participant and mean-  centred prior to the linear mixed model analysis. We extracted individual mean MMN amplitudes (again at electrode Fz minus the mean of M1 and M2) for each of the 18 deviant stimuli from position-  specific time windows as described above.

In two separate analyses, models were specified analogously  for  valence  and  arousal  ratings.  We  computed  full models, including the (valence or arousal) rating of a deviant, its position, the interaction of the two factors as fixed effects,  and  random  intercepts  for  participants  to  predict MMN  amplitudes.  We  assessed  the  significance  of  the fixed effects with  -  tests using Satterthwaite approximation. t Whenever  the  interaction  effect  reached  significance,  we compared the full model (using χ 2 -  tests) to a reduced model that considered only (valence or arousal) rating and position as fixed effects, but not their interaction, to test whether the interaction significantly improves the model fit above and beyond the effects of (valence or arousal) rating and position. Furthermore, we compared the full model to reduced models that considered only (valence or arousal) rating or position as the only fixed effect, thus testing whether adding position or (valence or arousal) rating as an additional predictor improved the model significantly.

## 2.5.4 | Time course of differences between neutral and aversive deviant ERPs

Based on previous studies, our main hypotheses were focussed on the peak of the MMN component, yet processing differences between neutral and aversive deviants seemed to occur already earlier after the sound onset. Therefore, we additionally explored the latency of the earliest processing  differences  through  a  non-  parametric  clusterbased permutation test (Maris &amp; Oostenveld, 2007). The time courses of neutral and aversive deviant ERP (from -100 to 500 ms; averaged across positions 1 and 2) were compared  using  point-  wise  independent-  samples t -  tests to identify clusters of amplitude differences between neural versus aversive deviants (using an alpha of p &lt; .05). A permutation approach was used to compare cluster-  level t -  scores  against  a  null  hypothesis  distribution  (using  a tmax procedure, 1000 permutations, and an alpha level of p &lt; .05) in order to determine time intervals of significant differences between neutral and the aversive deviant ERP, specifically in a frontal electrode cluster (around Fz).

## 3 | RESULTS

## 3.1 | Visual 2-  back distractor task

On average, participants correctly detected 71.9% of the visual targets ( SD = 11.8%), while they produced very few false alarms (false alarm rate: M = 2.0%, SD = 1.1%). Individual d' -  values ranged from 1.66 to 3.55 around a mean of 2.71 ( SD = 0.46). The mean reaction time for the 2-  back target detection was 474 ms ( SD = 75  ms). Together these data suggest that the visual distractor task was challenging,  but  all  participants  performed  well  above  chance. These results indicate that their attention was successfully directed towards the task.

## 3.2 | Ratings of auditory stimuli

In Figure 2 and in Table 1, we show the average valence and arousal ratings (and their standard error of mean or standard deviation) for each of the 18 deviant stimuli as well  as  for  the  standard  stimulus.  Overall,  participants tended  to  rate  aversive  deviants  as  more  arousing  and more negative than neutral deviants. The standard stimulus was located between the two types of deviants on both the valence and the arousal dimension. Notably, participants in the current study rated two of the stimuli that had been categorized as  aversive  in  the  previous  pilot  study (aversive stimulus 1 and stimulus 5) as rather neutral (i.e., valence and arousal ratings were comparable to those of the neutral deviants). Therefore, these two stimuli were excluded from the category-  wise ERP analysis.

## 3.3 | EEG data

Figure 3 shows ERPs (at electrode Fz and averaged bilateral  mastoids)  evoked  by  the  standard  stimulus  and  by neutral and aversive deviants at the first and second position, as well as the difference waveforms (deviant minus the standard ERP) for each of the four deviant types. The figure also depicts their topography in the MMN time window. All four deviant types elicited a clear MMN as indicated by a frontocentral negativity, along with a polarity reversal at mastoidal electrodes.

In  the  left  panel  of  Figure  4,  we  depict  individual  and mean  MMN  peak  latencies  at  electrode  Fz  for  neutral and  aversive  deviants  at  the  first  and  the  second  position. Across both neutral and aversive deviants, the MMN

Aversive sounds are colored in purple (A1 to A9) and neutral sounds in green (N1 to N9) according to the original categorization in a previous pilot experiment. The standard stimulus is colored in black (S).

Therefore, responses to these two stimuli were excluded from the categorywise analysis of neutral and aversive deviants.

peaked somewhat earlier in response to deviants  at  the first position compared to deviants at the second position. The  ANOVA  with  the  factors  unpleasantness  (aversive vs.  neutral)  and  position  (1  vs.  2)  revealed  a  significant main  effect  of  position, F (1,  23) = 31.26, p &lt; .001, partial η 2 = 0.58,  supporting the notion of an overall shorter MMN peak latency for deviants at the first compared to the second position. Conversely, there was neither a main effect of Unpleasantness, F (1,  23) &lt; 0.01, p = .945,  partial η 2 &lt; 0.01, nor an interaction between the two factors, F (1, 23) = 1.46, p = .239,  partial η 2 = 0.06,  suggesting  that  the unpleasantness of a deviant does not influence the MMN peak latency.

deviants  at  the  first  and  the  second  position,  respectively. The repeated-  measures ANOVA on MMN mean amplitudes  with  the  factors  Unpleasantness  and  Position yielded a significant main effect of Unpleasantness, F (1, 23) = 15.52, p = .001, partial η 2 = 0.40, and a significant  main  effect  of  Position, F (1,  23) = 20.18, p &lt; .001, partial η 2 = 0.47, but no significant interaction between the two factors, F (1, 23) = 0.05, p = .830, partial η 2 &lt; 0.01. These results  indicate  that  aversive  deviants  elicited  a larger (i.e., more negative) MMN than neutral deviants at  both  positions,  and  deviants  at  the  second  position elicited a larger MMN than deviants at the first position, irrespective of the deviant's unpleasantness. Contrary to our expectations, we found no interaction of the two factors on MMN amplitudes.

## 3.3.3 | MMN amplitudes: Stimulus-  wise effects depending on participants' valence and arousal ratings

A substantial proportion of the variance of MMN amplitudes was explained by individual subjects, ICC(1) = 0.16, F (23, 840) = 7.92, p &lt; .001, which were therefore modeled as random intercepts. Amplitudes were very homogeneous across participants, ICC(2) = 0.87.

## Valence

The  full  model,  including  the  valence  rating  of  a  deviant, its Position, and the interaction of the two factors as fixed effects as well as random intercepts for participants to predict MMN amplitudes, revealed a significant effect of  Position, β = -1.98, SE = 0.23, t (837) = -8.47, p &lt; .001, but neither a significant effect of Valence rating, β = .14, SE = 0.09, t (856) = 1.53, p = .127,  nor  a  significant  interaction, β = -.01, SE = 0.13, t (837) = -0.08, p = .936.  Subsequent model comparisons showed that the full model, including Valence rating, Position, and their interaction as fixed effects, AIC = 4645.5, R 2 = .237,  yielded  a  significantly better model fit, χ 2 (2) = 69.04, p &lt; .001, compared to a reduced model with Valence rating as the only fixed effect, AIC = 4710.6, R 2 = .172.  Thus, adding position as an additional  predictor  improved  the  model  substantially. In contrast, including valence rating as an additional predictor did not improve the model, as suggested by the absence of a significant difference in model fit, χ 2 (2) = 3.89, p = .143, between the full model and a reduced model with Position  as  the  only  fixed  effect, AIC = 4645.4, R 2 = .227. These results indicate that the position of a deviant reliably predicted the amplitude of the elicited MMN (with larger amplitudes for deviants in the second compared to the first position), whereas no significant additional variance in MMN amplitudes was explained by participants' ratings of a specific deviant sound on the valence dimension (i.e., how positive or negative they perceived the respective sound).

## Arousal

The full model, including the arousal rating of a deviant, its position and the interaction of the two factors as fixed effects as well as random intercepts for participants to predict MMN amplitudes, yielded significant effects of both arousal rating, β = -.22, SE = 0.09, t (858) = -2.39, p = .017,  and  Position, β = -1.98, SE = 0.23, t (837) = -8.47, p &lt; .001,  and  a

A reduced model that considered only arousal rating and position as fixed effects, but not their interaction, was outperformed by the full model in terms of model fit (full model: AIC = 4643.3, R 2 = .232;  model  without  interaction:

AIC = 4645.5, R 2 = .228; χ 2 (2) = 4.18, p = .041).  Model  comparisons further showed that the model fit was significantly better for the full model than for reduced models with either arousal rating, AIC = 4712.3, R 2 = .163; χ 2 (2) = 72.96, p &lt; .001, or Position ( AIC = 4645.4, R 2 = .227; χ 2 (2) = 6.08, p = .048, as

the only fixed effect. This suggests that adding either factor  as  an  additional  predictor  substantially  improved  the model. To resolve the significant interaction, we computed separate models including Arousal rating as a fixed effect for the first and for the second position, respectively. As shown in  Figure  5,  MMN  amplitudes  were  reliably  predicted  by participants'  ratings  of  a  specific  deviant  sound  (i.e.,  how arousing they perceived the respective sound) at the first, β = -.19, SE = 0.09, t (430) = -2.09, p = .037,  but  not  at  the second  position, β = .00, SE = 0.10, t (430) = -0.02, p = .988. More arousing deviants elicited a larger MMN when they occurred unexpectedly after a sequence of standard sounds (i.e., at the first position), whereas MMN amplitudes were generally larger and not further modulated by their arousal ratings for repeated deviants (i.e., at the second position).

## 3.3.4 | Time course of differences between neutral and aversive deviant ERPs

Processing differences between neutral and aversive deviants were seemingly not restricted to the time window of the MMN peak, as neutral deviants elicited a more positive ERP than that of aversive deviants over a wider time interval (see Figure  6).  A  cluster-  based  permutation  test  revealed  that significant ERP differences in an electrode cluster around Fz emerged as early as 50 ms after deviant onset and lasted until around 320 ms (with a short interval of nonsignificance between 126 and 154 ms after the deviant onset).

## 4 | DISCUSSION

Using a modified oddball paradigm with single and double deviants we explored how MMN amplitudes are modulated (a) by the aversive nature of deviant stimuli, (b) by (identical) deviant repetition in successive trials, and (c) by potential interactions of those two factors.

Across conditions, all deviants elicited a clear MMN, as  reflected  by  a  frontocentrally  distributed  negativity, accompanied  by  a  polarity  reversal  at  mastoidal  electrodes.  Crucially,  MMN  amplitudes  were  systematically influenced by the deviants' unpleasantness and position. Specifically, our category-  wise analysis revealed (a) larger MMN amplitudes for aversive than for neutral deviants (irrespective of their position), and (b) larger MMN amplitudes for the second (identical) than for the first deviant  in  a  row  (irrespective  of  their  unpleasantness).  The effect of deviant repetition did not differ significantly between both neutral and aversive deviants and might be explained by an overlap with a positive P3a component that only occurred at the first deviant position. Interestingly, using a more fine-  grained linear mixed model approach, we observed that deviant position and individual arousal

ratings were significant predictors of item-  specific MMN amplitudes  at  the  participant-  level.  In  particular,  at  the first presentation of a deviant, more arousing sounds were associated with larger MMN amplitudes.

## 4.1 | Increased MMN amplitude for aversive deviants

The finding  that  MMN  amplitudes  were  enhanced  in  response to aversive (compared to neutral) deviants is consistent with our hypothesis and closely in line with the results of  a  previous  study  (Czigler  et  al.,  2007).  It  suggests  that novel auditory stimuli are discriminated with regard to their unpleasantness at an early stage of processing. In fact, processing differences between neutral and aversive deviants emerged as early as 50 ms after sound onset (i.e., around the time of the beginning slope of the MMN). Aversive deviants may initiate evaluation processes that enable the preparation of adaptive behavioral reactions to potentially relevant or  even  threatening  changes  in  the  environment  (Czigler et al., 2007; see also, Schirmer &amp; Escoffier, 2010). Our findings  extend  those  of  Czigler  et  al.  (2007)  in  two  critical ways: First, Czigler et al. showed larger MMN amplitudes for  aversive  than  for  everyday  sounds  while  participants performed an auditory discrimination task, whereas in the present study participants' attention was directed away from the  auditory  stimulation  towards  a  visual  distractor  task. Our findings show distinct central auditory processing for aversive compared to neutral sounds even when attention is directed to another modality, consistent with automatic, pre-  attentive  processing  of  aversive  sounds.  Second,  we matched the dominant spectral frequencies and temporal modulation frequencies between neutral and aversive deviants in the stimuli we used. Hence, MMN amplitude differences may be more reliably attributed to the emotional valence and associated arousal of the sounds instead of lowlevel acoustic properties. Nevertheless, based on the current study  we  cannot  easily  distinguish  whether  the  observed differences between neutral and aversive deviants are attributable either to a genuine emotional mismatch response or to the processing of the emotional (aversive) stimulus content per se, which modifies or accompanies auditory deviant processing.

## 4.2 | Increased MMN amplitude for repeated deviants across unpleasantness levels

Contrary to our hypothesis and in contrast to previous studies (Müller et al., 2005b; Sams et al., 1984), identical deviant repetition did not result in a decrease (i.e., the

|

expected habituation), but in an increase of MMN amplitudes in response to deviants at the second compared to deviants at the first position. We found this enhancement of MMN amplitudes as a result of deviant repetition for both neutral and aversive sounds. This is also inconsistent  with  our  hypothesis  of  differential  effects depending on the unpleasantness of the repeated deviant. We consider two reasons for this unexpected result.

First, the discrepancy between the present and previous  findings  might  be  a  consequence  of  differences in the auditory  stimulus  material.  Whereas  earlier studies were conducted with simple sine tones (Müller et al., 2005b; Sams et al., 1984), we employed complex and more ecologically valid environmental sounds that might have led to different repetition effects. In fact, two magnetoencephalography studies  provide  evidence  for enhanced  brain  responses  that  emerge  around  150 ms after sound onset following the repeated presentation of complex  frequency-  modulated  sounds,  but  not  following  the  repeated  presentation  of  simpler  unmodulated tones  (Altmann  et  al.,  2011;  Heinemann  et  al.,  2010). Notably, the effect was specific to the first repetition of a frequency-  modulated sound and gave way to a secondorder repetition suppression during further repetitions (Altmann et al., 2011). It remains to be clarified by future  research  whether  this  pattern  of  initial  repetition enhancement  and  subsequent  repetition  suppression holds  true  for  complex  environmental  sounds  as  used in our study, and whether it may be modulated by the emotional  content  of  the  stimuli.  Similarly,  a  recent study compared neural adaptation to complex vocal and non-  vocal sounds and found that repetition suppression was delayed, i.e., required more repetitions to occur, for acoustically richer vocal compared to non-  vocal sounds, further suggesting that sound complexity may modulate the pattern of repetition effects (Heurteloup et al., 2022).

Second, amplitude differences between conditions in the MMN time window might be confounded with amplitude differences in earlier or later time windows. In our data, both neutral and aversive deviants evoked a positive P3a component from around 200 ms after sound onset for deviants in the first position (cf. Figure 3, best seen in the difference  waves  at  Fz,  third  row).  The  P3a  component may already begin to emerge at time points overlapping with the MMN time window, thereby partly canceling out the MMN, particularly in conditions with large P3a amplitudes. Given that the P3a seems strongly diminished for deviant  repetitions  (in  line  with  previous  research,  e.g., Rosburg et al., 2018), the MMN amplitude differences between first and second deviant position are more likely to reflect an overlap with a larger P3a resulting in a smaller MMN for the first deviant than an increased MMN for the second deviant.

## 4.3 | Influence of individual arousal, but not valence ratings on MMN amplitudes

Above  and  beyond  the  comparison  of  MMN  amplitudes to  deviants  priorly  categorized  as  neutral  or  aversive,  we evaluated  the  relationship  between  individual  ratings  of sounds and MMN amplitudes when presented as deviants at the first or the second position. Analyses of valence and arousal  ratings  allowed  to  dissociate  which  of  these  two well-  established  dimensions  to  describe  and  classify  emotions (Posner et al., 2005; Russell, 1980) was specifically associated with MMN amplitudes. Interestingly, we did not find any predictive value for MMN amplitude in the individual valence ratings. However, we found that individual arousal ratings reliably predicted MMN amplitudes in interaction with the position of the deviant. MMN amplitudes for deviants were overall larger at the second than at the first position, but more arousing stimuli were associated with enhanced MMN amplitudes for deviants only at the first, but not at the second position. While literature on dissociable effects of valence and arousal in response to auditory stimuli is scarce (see, e.g., Scheumann et al., 2017), more research has been done in the visual domain. For instance, Anders et al. (2004) found that the valence and arousal of emotional pictures were consistently related to activity in distinct brain regions  and  to  distinct  peripheral  physiological  reactions in  a  functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  study.  Vogt et al. (2008), on the other hand, showed that the allocation of (spatial) attention was dependent on the arousal induced by an emotional picture, but not on its valence. Kensinger and Corkin (2004) reported that-  compared to neutral wordsimproved memory capacity for (negative) emotional words relied on distinct neural networks depending on whether the words were arousing: memory capacity for highly arousing, as opposed to non-  arousing words, was specifically related to activity in the amygdala irrespective of stimulus valence, which the authors argued to be triggered automatically. If we consider MMN to reflect pre-  attentive, automatic stimulus processing, its dependence on or predictability by the arousal associated with a deviant might suggest contributions from brain structures associated with processing emotional or arousing stimuli. For instance, Kumar et al. (2012) showed that aversive sounds activated the amygdala, and that  amygdala  activity,  in  turn,  modulated  activity  in  the auditory cortex in order to facilitate sensory processing and evaluation of these stimuli. This is also in line with previously reported amygdala activation for emotional compared to neutral voices (Schirmer et al., 2008).

Regarding ERPs, there have been only few attempts to dissociate  the  effects  of  valence  and  arousal.  A  study  by Rozenkrants and Polich (2008) used images from the International Affective Pictures System (IAPS) and found larger

ERP amplitudes (e.g., N2, P3) in response to stimuli associated with high compared to low arousal, whereas stimulus valence had only weak effects on late ERPs. The authors suggested  that  arousal  is  the  primary  determinant  of  affective oddball processing. Thus, an explanation along the lines of arousal differences that modulate sensory processing  appears  plausible  for  our  finding  of  enhanced  MMN amplitudes in response to rare, more arousing stimuli.

At  first  glance,  it  may  seem  counterintuitive  that  our category-  wise analysis did not reveal a significant interaction between deviant unpleasantness and position, whereas the  stimulus-  wise  analysis  showed  a  link  between  MMN amplitudes and participants' arousal ratings that, crucially, depended on the deviant position. However, rather than a discrepancy, the results may reflect a specification of the effect of emotional content on MMN amplitudes: The interaction was driven by one dimension (arousal) of the stimulus' unpleasantness and was specific to individual ratings for the particular sound items (rather than to an a priori -  defined emotional category). Thus, an interplay between a deviant's unpleasantness and its repetition exists, but apparently acts more subtly  at  the  level  of  individually  perceived  arousal than to show in the category-  wise analysis.

## 5 | CONCLUSION

We show evidence for an enhancement of MMN amplitudes in response to aversive compared to neutral environmental sounds presented as deviants. However, given that the identical repetition of deviants resulted in larger MMN amplitudes for the second compared to the first deviant, we did not find signs of habituation as originally expected, but instead observed an unspecific MMN amplitude increase for repeated, complex, and ecologically valid deviants irrespective of their unpleasantness. Critically, we provide evidence that an increase in perceived arousal rather than perceived valence  of  a  deviant  sound  is  associated  with  a  stimulusspecific  MMN  amplitude  enhancement.  This  strengthens the assumption of a fast emotional evaluation that gates automatic sensory processing with all its evolutionary advantages of allowing adaptive behaviors.
