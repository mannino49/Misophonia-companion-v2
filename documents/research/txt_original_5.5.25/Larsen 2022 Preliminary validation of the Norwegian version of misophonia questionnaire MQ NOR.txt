ABSTRACT
Objective: To perform a psychometric validation of a Norwegian version of the Misophonia Questionnaire
(MQ-NOR) and to test the link between the personality trait neuroticism and misophonia assessed with the
MQ-NOR.
Design: Participants completed online versions of the MQ-NOR on two occasions about two weeks apart
and the neuroticism scale from BFI-20.
Study sample: Two-hundred and twenty-seven (T1) and 173 (T2) participants with self-reported misophonia.
Results: The MQ-NOR was found to comprise two factors: Symptom Scale and Emotions and Behaviours
Scale. Overall, the MQ-NOR evidenced good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Regression
analyses supported a positive relationship between misophonia and neuroticism that was moderated byparticipant age, but not gender.
Conclusion: The MQ-NOR demonstrates good psychometric properties, but until more extensively vali-
dated, it is cautiously recommended for use by clinicians in Norway to assessing misophonia. Future val-
idation studies should be carried out.ARTICLE HISTORY

There are many definitions of misophonia in the literature.
Jastreboff and Jastreboff ( 2015 ) defined misophonia “as an
abnormally strong reaction to a sound with a specific pattern
and meaning to a given subject. The physical characteristics of
the sound are secondary ”(p. 376). A recent consensus definition
was reached to aid empirical investigations, describing misopho-nia as a disorder related to decreased sound tolerance that evokes
strong negative emotional, physical, and behavioural responses to
sounds that do not bother people normally. It is the specific pat-tern or meaning rather than the loudness of sound that appearsto be the problem, and the trigger sounds are often elicited by
another individual and often produced by the body (e.g. eating
or chewing sounds). Individuals with misophonia may find itdifficult to distract themselves from the trigger sound and mayexperience impaired social, occupational, or academic function-
ing. Misophonia symptoms and severity vary between individu-
als, however, it commonly develops in childhood or earlyadolescence (Swedo et al. 2021 ).
The consensus definition of misophonia does not specify the
aetiology, relation with psychological conditions or whether
misophonia should be considered a psychiatric condition due to
a paucity of empirical evidence on these topics (Swedo et al.2021 ). However, some studies support an underlying neurobio-
logical mechanism with evidence from functional magneticresonance imaging of abnormal functional connectivity of the
anterior insula (Kumar et al. 2017,2021; Schr €oder et al. 2019 )
and a significantly smaller mean peak amplitude of the N1
event-related brain potential component during an auditory odd-
ball task, suggesting a neurobiological deficit reflecting eitherimpaired processing or perception of auditory information
(Schr €oder et al. 2014 ). Others have explored misophonia in rela-
tion to neuroticism due to a similarity in characteristics, that is,
the frequent and intense negative emotional reactions to trigger
sounds in misophonia and to stressors in individuals high in the
personality trait neuroticism (Cassiello-Robbins et al. 2020 ;
Widiger 2009 ). For instance, one study reports preliminary find-
ings of above average scores on neuroticism by individuals with
suspected misophonia (Jager et al. 2020), while others report sig-
nificant correlations between neuroticism and symptoms of
misophonia in university students (Daniels, Rodriguez, and
Zabelina 2020 ), an adult transdiagnostic sample (Cassiello-
Robbins et al. 2020 ), and a clinical sample of non-psychotic psy-
chiatric outpatients, although in this study, neuroticism was not
a significant predictor of misophonia (C ¸olak et al. 2021 ). Further
research is needed to elucidate the relationship between miso-
phonia and neuroticism, but current research suggests that
higher neuroticism is a risk factor for misophonia (Cassiello-
Robbins et al. 2020 ). The different foci within misophonia

research serve to underscore that misophonia should be studied
as a condition within several scientific disciplines such as audi-ology, psychology, and neuroscience (Swedo et al. 2021).
Misophonia assessments in a Cross-Cultural perspective
Irrespective of scientific discipline, it is important to have avail-
able valid and reliable measures to uncover the background,resulting emotions and behaviours, and degree and severity ofmisophonia. There are several misophonia questionnaires avail-able including the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al.2014 ), the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-Miso-S; Naylor et al.
2021 ), MisoQuest (Siepsiak, /C19Sliwerski, and Łukasz Dragan 2020),
and the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (Rosenthal et al. 2021 ).
The MQ (Wu et al. 2014 ) was the only misophonia questionnaire
that had preliminary psychometric data when the present study
was initiated and therefore the focus of our study.
Notwithstanding the MQ being a relatively new measure, severalstudies have already used it to detect and map misophonia dueto individual differences in symptoms, and emotions and behav-iours. In general, studies report good internal consistencies withCronbach ’s alphas ranging from .75 to .90 across different
nationalities and populations (e.g. Zhou, Wu, and Storch 2017 ;
McErlean and Banissy 2018; Daniels, Rodriguez, and Zabelina
2020 ; Honarmand et al. 2019 ). The MQ has also been utilised to
report treatment effects in at least one study (McGuire, Wu, andStorch 2015). Importantly, the original study by Wu et al. ( 2014)
detailing the development and validation of the MQ did not testfor the stability of the measure over time and to our knowledge,no other study has evaluated this. This warrants an investigationof the test-retest validity the MQ.
Cross-cultural adaptations of questionnaires have clear advan-
tages (e.g. time and cost savings) over developing new question-naires (Beaton et al. 2000) and additionally, by adapting an
already validated questionnaire into a new language, it more eas-ily enables comparisons of results from different studies. A
guideline specifically developed for adapting questionnaires
within the field of audiology was recently developed with theaim of proposing a good practice guide on the translation pro-cess and encouraging transparency in the process by publishingthe details of the process (Hall et al. 2018). The procedure pro-
posed by Hall et al. ( 2018) is based on a synthesis of existing
guidelines and involves a series of (six) steps involving prepar-ation, translation from source language to target language, back-translation, evaluation by a cross-disciplinary expert team, pilottesting and final evaluation and completion of the adapted ques-tionnaire. The process may thus be described as well-justified inaddition to being particularly thorough and it therefore used inthe present study.
The current study
The current study addressed a need by pedagogical hearing
therapists, and clinicians and researchers in Norway to have aself-report measure available for assessing the background,resulting emotions and behaviours, and degree and severity ofmisophonia. The tradition in Norway is for technical cliniciansworking with individuals with (suspected) misophonia to followTinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) protocols (Jastreboff, 2000 ),
even if the evidence for this approach is not supported.Nonetheless, other audiological conditions may be differentiatedby using audiological evaluations (Ferrer-Torres and Gim /C19enez-
Llort 2022), but the preferred is to use a self-report questionnaireto assess misophonia. To the best of our knowledge, those work-
ing with individuals with (suspected) misophonia in Norway
have no validated misophonia questionnaire available. Thus, the
aim of the present study was to adapt the MQ into Norwegian(i.e. MQ-NOR) using Hall and colleagues ’approach (Hall et al.
2018 ), before submitting the MQ-NOR for a pre-validation;
investigating the factor structure, internal consistency, and thetest-retest reliability. This is the first ever evaluation of the test-
retest reliability of the MQ and provides a much-needed tool for
assessing misophonia in Norway. Further, given the demon-
strated link between misophonia and neuroticism and research
interest in this relationship at the time of our study (e.g.Cassiello-Robbins et al. 2020 ; Daniels, Rodriguez, and Zabelina
2020 ), this will be tentatively explored in our Norwegian sample
of individuals with misophonia to provide even further evidence.
Materials and methods
Procedure and participants
Data were collected through an online survey and participants
were recruited through five audiology clinics and via social
media (e.g. Facebook groups). To be able to participate in the
study, participants had to be between 18 –67 years and have (or
suspect to have) a complaint of misophonia. A detailed descrip-
tion of the experience and symptoms of misophonia was
included in the participant study information, to ensure uni-
formity in the understanding of the term (i.e. “Do you feel frus-
tration or anger when someone else eats, breathes or makesother repetitive sounds? Do you avoid meals with friends or fam-
ily or lose concentration when someone else types on a key-
board? ”). The data were collected between February and March
2021. Participants were asked to complete the survey on two sep-
arate occasions about two weeks apart (T1 and T2). The studyreceived approval from the Norwegian centre for research data
(Norsk senter for forskningdata; NSD).
A total of 227 participants (84.1% female) completed the sur-
vey at T1 and 173 (83.2% female) completed the survey at T2.The average age was 37.7 years ( SD¼11.6). The average age for
females was 37.5 ( SD¼11.3) and for males 39.1 ( SD¼13.2).
Twenty-six participants receiving treatment for misophonia at
either T1 and/or T2 were excluded from the test-retest analysis
to avoid any confounding treatment effects.
Questionnaire translation
The step-by-step process proposed by Hall et al. ( 2018 ) was used
to adapt the MQ (Wu et al. 2014 ) into Norwegian. In the prep-
aration phase, permission was received from the developers of
the MQ for the adaption of the questionnaire into Norwegian. In
the next step, two forward translations were produced, one by aprofessional translator and one by a pedagogical hearing therap-
ist. An external reviewer, who is also a pedagogical hearing ther-
apist with expertise in misophonia, then consolidated thesetranslations. In the back-translation step, a third translator, a
Norwegian-English bilingual with clinical experience in peda-
gogical hearing therapy, performed a back-translation of the con-
solidated questionnaire. In the next step, the back- and
consolidated-forward translations were compared to the originalMQ and any discrepancies were discussed and resolved by a
review committee comprising the study authors. Finally, in the
last two steps, four individuals with self-reported misophonia
test-piloted the Norwegian adaptation and feedback on the last2 E.-A. LARSEN ET AL.

item (i.e. misophonia severity) resulted in minor adjustment to
the wording of the response option. The pilot testers then
approved the adjustment. See Supplementary Appendix A and
A1for further details and the translation protocol.
Measures
Participants completed a Norwegian version (MQ-NOR) of the
Misophonia Questionnaire (Wu et al. 2014 ). Items on the
Misophonia Symptom Scale are rated on scale from Not at all
true (0) to Always true (4), while items on the Misophonia
Emotions and Behaviours Scale are rated on a scale from Never
(0) to Always (4). The two scales are summed to get the Total
Score Scale (possible score range: 0 /C068). The single item
Misophonia Severity Scale is originally rated on a scale from
Minimal (1) to Very severe (15), with scores of 7 or higher corre-
sponding to clinically significant symptoms (Wu et al. 2014 ), but
we allowed participants to indicate if they thought they were not
sound sensitive (0). Participants also completed the Neuroticism
Scale from the Big Five Inventory 20 (BFI-20), a short version of
BFI-44 (Engvik and Clausen 2011 ). The Neuroticism Scale is
comprised of four statements (e.g. Is relaxed, handles stress well;I worry a lot) rated on a scale from Does not fit (1) to Fits per-
fectly (7). After reverse scoring items, an average score is calcu-
lated with values close to 7 reflecting a high degree of
neuroticism. Internal consistency with Cronbach ’s alpha was
a¼.77.
Statistical analyses
The factor structure of the MQ-NOR was investigated using
exploratory factor analysis with an oblique factor rotation. Thecut-off for factor loadings was set at 0.30. Factor extraction wasdetermined by parallel analysis, inspection of the scree plot and
eigenvalues >1 (Kaiser 1960). The internal consistency of MQ-
NOR was assessed with Cronbach ’s alpha using the following
cut-offs: <.60 unacceptable; .60-.69 minimally reliable; .70-.79
reliable, .80-.90 highly reliable and >.90 very highly acceptable
(Cohen et al., 2017). Test-retest reliability was investigated by
examining (1) the exact agreement between items at T1 and T2,(2)/C201 response grade difference between T1 and T2, and (3)
Cohen ’s weighted kappa for categorical variables (i.e. individual
questionnaire items) and Intra Class Correlations (ICCs) for
numerical variables (i.e. MQ-NOR scales) using a two-way mixedmodel with absolute agreement. Cohen ’s weighted kappa criteria
were: .21-.40 fair; .41-.60 moderate; .61-.80 substantial; and /C21.81
almost perfect agreement (McHugh 2012), while ICCs <.50 was
considered poor; .50-.75 moderate; .75-.90 good; and >.90 excel-
lent (Koo & Li, 2016 ). Finally, ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression analyses were used to examine the relationshipbetween the misophonia scales and neuroticism. The statistical
analyses were performed using IBM SPSS (Version 27) and
Jamovi (Version 1.6.15.0).
Results
Descriptive statistics
The sounds that participants were the most sensitive to (i.e. rated
Often true orAlways true ) were people eating (77.3%) followed
by nasal sounds (74.1%). Participants were the least sensitive toconsonant/vowel sounds (14.1%). The emotional or behaviouralresponses that participants engaged in most often (i.e. ratedOften orAlways ) were becoming annoyed (83.2%) followed by
leaving the environment (56.3%), while becoming sad anddepressed (16.3%) and physically aggressive (3.5%) were the least
experienced emotional responses. Descriptive statistics for indi-
vidual items are provided in Supplementary Appendix B and
Supplementary Appendix C presents the MQ-NOR in
its entirety.
Bivariate correlations showed that the Misophonia Total Score
Scale and the Emotions and Behaviours Scale were significantlyand strongly associated with the Severity Scale ( r¼.67 and r¼
.62, respectively, ps<.001), while the association between the
Misophonia Symptom Scale and the Severity Scale was moderate(r¼.34,p<.001).
Factor analyses
Prior to performing the exploratory factor analyses investigating
the underlying structure of items on the MQ-NOR, Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett ’s test of sphericity were exam-
ined to ensure the quality of the correlation matrix and sampling
adequacy. KMO was acceptable (KMO ¼0.87), and Bartlett ’s
test of sphericity was significant, X
2(136)¼1675, p<.001, sug-
gesting that the data were suitable for factor analysis. Results
showed that a two-factor solution was the better fit to the data
and together the factors explained 42.13% of the variance. Twoitems ( “People Eating ”and “Nasal Sounds ”) cross-loaded, but as
“Nasal Sounds ”loaded more strongly on Factor 2 it was included
in this factor, while “People Eating ”loaded equally on the two
factors. Despite this it was deemed more appropriate to include
this item in Factor 2 akin to Wu et al. ( 2014 ) rather than exclude
the item as it is a particularly salient symptom for patients withmisophonia (see Table 1 ).
Internal consistency
Cronbach ’s alpha for the Misophonia Symptom Scale was a¼
.81 and for the Misophonia Emotions and Behaviours Scale itwasa¼.88. The internal consistency of each scale remained (or
was marginally lower) if an item was dropped from the scale.
Cronbach ’s alpha for the Total Score Scale was a¼.88, which
was largely unchanged if an item was deleted.

Test-retest reliability
The agreement for individual items on the Misophonia Symptom
Scale and the Emotions and Behaviours Scale was generally goodwhen inspecting the exact agreement and /C201 grade difference
agreement. Weighted kappas were in the high moderate to sub-
stantial range with values ranging from .56 (Verbally Aggressive)
to .76 (People Eating) (see Table 2 ). ICCs were good to excellent
with ICCs ranging from .77 (Severity Scale) to .92 (Total ScoreScale) (see Table 3 ).
Regression analyses
Neuroticism showed statistically significant relation with the
Symptom Scale, b¼.214; p¼.001, Emotions and Behaviours
Scale, b¼.356; p<.001 and Severity Scale, b¼.252; p<.001.
This suggests that participants more plagued by misophonia alsoreported a higher level of neuroticism. Further, results showed
that age was a significant moderator of the relationship between
neuroticism and scores on the Emotions and Behaviours Scale, b
¼.613; p¼.026, which suggest a stronger association in older
rather than younger participants. The age by neuroticism inter-
action effect on misophonia symptoms and severity, respectively,
did not reach statistical significance, nor did any of the genderby neuroticism interaction effects.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to perform a pre-validation of theMQ-NOR, a Norwegian translation of the MQ (Wu et al. 2014),
and to tentatively explore the association between the personalitytrait neuroticism and misophonia using our Norwegian sample.
The MQ-NOR is the first ever validated Norwegian misophonia
questionnaire and will be a valuable tool for audiologists, peda-
gogical hearing therapists and other professionals working withindividuals with misophonia in Norway.
When Wu and colleagues developed the MQ, they found that
three factors best described the questionnaire; the Symptom
Scale, the Emotions and Behaviours Scale and the Total Score
Scale (sum of other two scales; Wu et al. 2014 ). However, this
finding was not replicated in our study, which found only twofactors as did an Iranian validation study (Honarmand et al.
2019 ). Items clearly loaded on one of two factors except for two
items (i.e. People eating and Nasal sounds) that had loadings
exceeding the cut-off of .30 on both factors. It was decided to
include both items in the Symptom Scale as both are commonlyreported (i.e. salient misophonia symptoms; Swedo et al. 2021 )
and thus, despite the difference in the number of factors best
describing the structure of the MQ, it is noted that each of our
factors comprise the same items as Wu ’s first two factors.
Interestingly, Wu ’s third factor is the Total Score Scale (i.e. the
sum of the Symptom Scale and Emotions and Behaviours Scale),
which has an eigenvalue greater than one even though several
items have generally low factor loadings. Even if the present
study did not find statistical evidence for a third factor (i.e. a
Total Score Scale), it makes intuitive sense to have a Total Score
Scale as an index of severity, breadth of trigger sounds and reac-
tions. Regarding MQ-NOR inter-scale correlations, we foundsimilarly to Wu et al. ( 2014 ) a significant and strong association
between the Total Score Scale and the Severity Scale, something
that indeed supports the utility of the Severity Scale as an index
of severity even if it has not been validated against an (objective)
alternative measure of severity and remains purely adapted fromthe NIMH Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Murphy, Pickar, and
Alterman 1982 ) as described by Wu et al. ( 2014 ). This therefore
presents an avenue for future research to address.
Further, our results demonstrate high internal consistency
with Cronbach ’s alpha above .80 for the Symptom Scale,
Emotions and Behaviours Scale and Total Score Scale, respect-ively. This is reassuring and in accordance with other studies
also reporting good internal consistency statistics for the MQ
(Daniels, Rodriguez, and Zabelina 2020 ; McErlean and Banissy
2018 ; Wu et al. 2014 ; Zhou, Wu, and Storch 2017 ). Finally, ourTable 2. Test-retest agreement for individual items from the MQ-NOR ( n¼147).

test-retest analyses revealed at the more descriptive level that the
mean exact agreement across items on the Symptom Scale and
Emotions and Behaviours Scale was 60.9% (i.e. 17 items by 147participants). Further, for all items, more than 90% of partici-pants had /C201 grade difference between scores at T1 and T2,
that is, there was either no change in scores or only one grade
difference from for example, Not at all true (0) to Rarely true
(1). Based on the statistical test-retest analyses, indices with
Cohen ’s weighted kappa and ICCs supported the stability of par-
ticipants ’responses over a period of 2 –3 weeks. This is the first
time the test-retest reliability of the MQ has been investigatedwith results indicating that the MQ-NOR may be reliably used
over time, however, further investigations of the test-retest reli-
ability of the MQ using both clinical and non-clinical popula-tions are strongly encouraged.
Results from our supplementary regression analyses con-
firmed our hypothesis of a positive relationship between miso-
phonia and neuroticism. These findings are in line with previousresearch (e.g. C ¸olak et al. 2021 ) and now demonstrates this rela-
tionship in a Norwegian sample of individuals with a complaint
of misophonia. The moderation analyses revealed a stronger rela-
tionship between neuroticism and misophonia emotion andbehaviour reactions in older participants than younger partici-
pants. A possible explanation for this might be related to the
idea that misophonia trigger sounds tend to generalise over time,similar to a conditioned reflex (Edelstein et al. 2013 ). In adult-
hood there may also be an increased awareness of the condition,
which is often reported as a hidden and shameful condition to
live with. Thus, trigger reactions might promote more worry/ner-vousness and particularly reduce the ability to handle stress for
those higher on neurotic personality traits, which in turn might
exacerbate the experience of misophonia in a system wheremisophonia and neurotic traits in essence feed into each otherover time. Taken together, our findings add to our understand-
ing of the relationship between misophonia, a condition within
decreased sound tolerance, and personality by demonstrating theimportance of patients ’age on this relationship, which has previ-
ously been shown in another related condition, namely, noise
sensitivity where both age and gender was found to be importantin the relationship with personality (Shepherd et al. 2015 ).
Strengths and limitations
A clear strength of our study is the rigorous cross-cultural adap-
tation of the MQ into Norwegian using the guidelines proposedby Hall et al. ( 2018 ). Another methodological strength is our
test-retest design and extensive test-retest analyses. However, our
study has some limitations that should be mentioned. The pro-portion of males to females was unequal at around 1:5. Whilethis is regrettable, it is often the case and in the original MQ
study by Wu and colleges ( 2014 ), a similar proportion of males
to females was found. This may indicate that the populationwith a complaint of misophonia is higher among women than it
is among men. Further, the participants were recruited via clinics
and online fora, and the present study relied on participants whowere recruited online to self-report a complaint misophonia. It isthus not entirely clear if all participants in fact have misophonia
or whether they may have confused this with sound over-respon-
sivity generally, for example. But given the detailed descriptionof misophonia in the study information to participants, we have
good reason to believe in the participants ’self-report. This was
also confirmed in the rather high proportion of the sample (i.e.48.9%) who meet cut-off for clinically significant misophoniasymptoms. Finally, the present study did not include individuals
without misophonia nor were other misophonia questionnairesincluded (as none were validated at the time), something that
prevented a more extensive validation of the MQ-NOR. We
strongly encourage future studies to address these issues andadditionally, using clinical samples in this endeavour.
Conclusion
The present study has demonstrated, using a sample of individu-
als with self-reported misophonia complaints, that the MQ-NOR
has adequate psychometric properties in terms of factor struc-ture, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. However,until the MQ-NOR has undergone more extensive validation, itshould be cautiously implemented as a measurement tool formisophonia in Norwegian clinics. Future studies should focus onthe psychometric validity of MQ-NOR using clinical samples andit would be of interest to probe the personality trait of neuroti-cism as a risk factor for misophonia.
