## Abstract

Brainspotting (BSP) is a relatively new type of brain-body psychotherapeutic approach discovered and developed by David Grand (2003) that accesses the  client's  innate self -observing and  self-healing capacities in the frame of a neurobiologically attuned clinical relationship. Despite it being increasingly growing in popularity among therapists, there is still a paucity of literature on its effectiveness. The aim of the study was to explore the efficacy of BSP in treating distressing (not necessarily traumatic) memories  in  a  non-clinical  sample  of  adults.  A  within-subjects  design  was  employed  for  the Brainspotting effectiveness analysis, with two within-subjects factors (treatment, time). The treatment factor had two levels: Brainspotting, and a control condition (Body Scan Meditation). Both objective (Heart Rate Variability - HRV parameters) and subjective (self-report) measures were used in the study. Results showed that, after about 40 minutes of treatment, Brainspotting significantly reduced memoryrelated distress in comparison with Body Scan Meditation control condition ( p = .028). Additionally, the participants had better HRV than before the treatment (all Time Domain parameters   &lt; .05). p Participants' Interoceptive Awareness dimensions and dispositional traits such as attachment style, temperament and character were also examined and discussed within the Brainspotting theoretical frame.  These  findings,  more  broadly,  highlighted  the  key  role  of  interoceptive  awareness  in  the processing of distressing memories.

## 1. Introduction

The current psychology defines memory as the capacity of encoding, storing, and retrieving information (Squire, 2009). Human autobiographical memory can consist of information stored both in episodic memories or experiences placed in time and space, and in semantic memory

characterized by a conceptual, generic, and schematic knowledge of one's own life (Conway &amp; Williams, 2008). Among the information stored in the personal history, there can be several distressful or traumatic memories. Distressing memories can consist of images, thoughts and feelings related to stressful events including extremely upsetting adverse life events such as nonlife-threatening injuries, childhood humiliations, death of a pet, bullying, and loss of significant relationships  (Shapiro,  2018).  These  memories  are  generally  negatively  emotionally  charged. Traumatic memory is a particular kind of distressing memory emerging from a person's direct exposure to or witnessing of a traumatic event such as serious injury, threatened death or sexual violence (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). These traumatic events are risk factors for the development of several mental disorders, including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (Bromet et al., 2018).

Brainspotting (BSP) is a brain-body psychotherapeutic approach used to support reprocessing of  traumatic  or  distressful  memories.  Originating  from  an  innovative  modification  of  Eye Movement  and  Desensitization  and  Reprocessing  (EMDR)  protocol,  called  'Natural  Flow EMDR' (Grand, 2001), David Grand di scovered and started to develop BSP in 2003. Until now,  over  13,000  therapists  have  been  trained  worldwide.  However,  despite  the  growing popularity of BSP, there is still a paucity of research reporting on the mechanisms and clinical efficacy of this treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of BSP on distressing, not-necessarily traumatic, memories in a sample of healthy adults.

The basic idea behind BSP is the motto «Where you look affects how you feel» (Grand, 2013, p. 3). Vision is a core sensory modality that the brain uses to orient humans in their environment (Chubb et al., 2013). Grand suggests that not only eye movements and positions have a high correlation with emotional experiences, but also the subcortical brain organizes itself around that eye position. For example, when you are exposed to a traumatic event, the eye position could be relevant to how you perceive the experience. The BSP therapist makes use of this natural tendency of humans to orient to what is salient in their environment to help clients find a presumed fixation point holding a trauma's unprocessed information in the brain. By focusing on eye position, you can connect to the traumatic experience and promote your self-healing ability to address and resolve trauma (Grand, 2013).

Similar to EMDR (Shapiro, 2018), BSP enables the client to access body and emotions to help dislodge the frozen material and to nudge along the brain and body's natural processing system. This type of processing is not typically achieved through traditional talk therapy. Indeed, while traditional talk therapy is conversational, BSP follows a bottom-up approach, which means that

mindfulness is used to explore what is happening to the clients' emotions and body as the client s are exploring their problematic experience (Grand, 2013).

Corrigan and Grand (2013) proposed that the adaptive orientation to distressing information engages the orienting response in the midbrain tectum. This basic orientation response occurs unconsciously for survival and helps the human being pay attention to potentially dangerous environmental stimuli (Ogden et al., 2006). Adaptive orienting can become truncated at any point  of  sequence  (arousal,  stopping  the  current  activity,  sense  of  alertness,  muscular adjustments, etc.) due to trauma (Corrigan &amp; Grand, 2013; Corrigan et al., 2015). It is supposed that, when the brain cannot integrate all parts of the traumatic experience, residues of trauma are  stored  in  its  physiological  'capsule'  that  holds  traum atic  experience  in  memory  form (Grand, 2013).

BSP aims  to  create  the  environment  for  adaptive  orientation  to  the  trauma  by  finding  the relevant  eye  position  (called  'brainspot')  to  the  trauma.  Brainspot  is  defined  as  a  «stored oculomotor orientation to a traumatic experience which has failed to integrate» (Corrigan &amp; Grand, 2013, p. 761). Holding the gaze on that brainspot, the client is then invited to observe the  internal  process,  including  body  sensations,  memories,  emotions,  and  thoughts,  with curiosity and without judgment (Grand, 2009).

This selfobservation is called "focused mindfulness" and recruits the brain's medial prefrontal regions (Corrigan &amp; Grand, 2013). It is supported by another core element of the BSP approach: the client/therapist 'dual attunement', which is simultaneously the combined relational and neurobiological attunement that is similar to the model of Interpersonal Neurobiology (Siegel, 2010). In this way, the mindful and compassionate presence of the therapist supports the healing promoting brain pathways that are associated with feelings of safety, support, and connection. BSP mechanism of action on the right brain hemisphere, the limbic system, and the brain stem (midbrain) are only neurobiological hypotheses for now, that need future empirical research.

To the best of our knowledge, there have been only a few studies in the literature addressing BSP  clinical application: a preliminary  evidence  on  BSP  efficacy  in  the  treatment  of Posttraumatic stress disorders (Hildebrand et al., 2014); a comparative study between BSP and EMDR  on  treating  traumatized  clients  (Hildebrand  et  al.,  2017);  an  unpublished  clinical comparison  study  (EMDR,  BSP,  and  Cognitive  Behavioral  Therapy)  on  the  treatment  of generalized anxiety disorder (Anderegg, 2015); two single case studies that focused on trauma (Masson et al., 2017) and on a persistent genital arousal disorder (Mattos et al., 2015).

Since  these  studies  are  based  on  self-report  inventories,  it  could  be  important  to  integrate subjective measures with objective measurements like psychophysiological assessment. Indeed, BSP appears to promote coherence between the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) and the Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) activities (Grand, 2009). Moreover, it is argued that, through  the  therapist-client  dual  attunement  and  the  processing  of  the  brainspot,  BSP  can down-regulate the amygdala and facilitate PNS homeostasis (Scaer, 2005). These hypotheses could  be  tested  through  non-invasive  measures  such  as  Heart  Rate  Variability  (HRV) parameters.

For example, in the field of Mindfulness Based Interventions (MBIs -Zhang et al., 2021) such as Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) protocol (Kabat-Zinn, 1994), research supports the  utility  of  using  HRV  as  a  biomarker  capable  of  demonstrating  intervention  effects (Christodoulou  et  al.,  2020).  The  Body  Scan  Meditation  (BSM)  is  a  Focused  Attention meditation (Lutz et al., 2008) that serves as a foundation for all MBIs. It involves focusing on bodily sensations, even unpleasant ones, gradually and sequentially moving one's own attention through each part of the body without judgement. A number of physiological changes occur during this practice, among which an increased Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) (Ditto et al., 2006). Normally, during inspiration the Heart Rate (HR) increases and during expiration it decreases. RSA is the naturally occurring variation in HR that occurs during the breathing cycle (Yasuma, &amp; Hayano, 2004). RSA represents an index of cardiac vagal tone and therefore of HRV (Grossman, &amp; Taylor, 2007; Porges, 1995).

These benefits derived from mindfulness practice may be primarily due to the cultivation of Interoceptive Awareness (IA) resulting in the capacity to stay in a non-evaluating contact with body sensations (Farb et al., 2013; Mehling et al., 2012). Although IA can be considered a core component of MBIs, it is a distinct construct and, at the same time, it is tightly interwoven to the construct of dispositional mindfulness (Hanley et al., 2017). IA is defined as «the conscious perception of sensations from inside the body, such as heartbeat, respiration, satiety, and the autonomic  nervous  system  sensations  related  to  emotions,  which  create  the  sense  of  the physiological condition of the body» (Calì et al., 2015, p.1). At this point, one can hypothesize that IA may well be a fundamental component of mindfulness practice, but it could also be involved in the BSP processing phase of focused mindfulness.

## 1.1 Objectives of the study

The purpose of the current study was to make an empirical contribution to the research on BSP using both subjective (self-report questionnaires) and objective (psychophysiological indices)

measures.  The  primary  hypothesis  regarded  the  therapeutic  potential  of  the  technique, specifically,  if  BSP  is  effective  in  reducing  psychological  pain  related  to  distressing,  but  not necessarily traumatic, memories. In relation to this first hypothesis, the autonomic correlates of BSP intervention were also studied. Specifically, if  the  BSP  technique can  increase  HRV  in participants facing distressing memories.

The secondary hypothesis concerned which characteristics of the participant would favor or hinder the processing of the disturbing memories. Specifically, which dimensions of IA are related to a better processing of disturbing memories in the focused mindfulness phase, and which dimensions of the client's temperament and character, as well as attachment style, can affect the dual attunement and thus, the effectiveness of the technique.

Therefore, these hypotheses comparing BSP with an active control condition (BSM) were tested on a sample of healthy adults.

## 2. Materials and Methods

## 2.1 Participants

Participation in the study was voluntary, and potential participants were selected from available adult students attending a psychotherapy  training course at the Institute of systemic psychotherapy of Udine (Italy). Students who met the criteria were offered the opportunity to participate.  Criteria  included  not  reporting  diagnosis  of  mental  and  neurological  disorder, medication or any other form of therapy, and no experience of BSP therapy and mindfulness meditation.

Of the 32 participants who completed the study, 4 participants were excluded from statistical analyses for not meeting HRV artifact threshold criteria. The remaining 28 participants' mean age was 34.19 years ( SD = 6.65); 6 participants were male.

Informed consent for research assessment and procedure was obtained from all participants. The procedures were approved by the local Ethics of the University of Udine and were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration guidelines.

The study was conducted by the clinician-researcher and author of this article, who has been trained  in  BSP  in  addition  to  holding  a  master's  degree  in  MBIs,  advanced  diploma in psychotherapy teaching and clinical supervision.

## 2.2 Measures

Subjective Units of Disturbance (SUD) Scale. The SUD Scale, originally developed by (Wolpe, 1969), is a subjective disturbance scale ranging from 0 to 10. This self-report measure was used to  assess  the  distress  perceived  by  participants  during  the  memory  telling.  Psychotherapy outcome research supports SUD scores (SUDs) as global measures of level of distress (Tanner, 2012) with good psychometric properties (Kim et al., 2008).

Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA). The MAIA (Calì et al., 2015; Mehling et al., 2012) is a 32-item self-report questionnaire measuring multiple dimensions of Interoceptive Awareness ('Noticing', 'Not Distracting', -'Not Worrying', -'Attention Regulation', 'Emotional Awareness', 'Self Regulation', 'Body Listening', and 'Trusting'). -The eight scales showed Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from .66 to .83.

Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). The TCI (Cloninger et al., 1994; Delvecchio et al., 2016), is a self-report questionnaire composed of 125 true -false items that operationalizes Cloninger's personality model (Cloninger et al., 1993) organized into four Temperament scales (i.e., NS,  'Novelty  Seeking';  HA,  'Harm  Avoidance';  RD,  'Reward  Dependence';  Pe, 'Persistence') and three Character scales (i.e., SD, 'Self Directedness'; Co, 'Cooperativeness'; -ST, 'Self Transcendence'). Internal consistency of the TCI was acceptable across different ages -(i.e., α ≥ .70).

Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ). The ASQ (Feeney et al., 1994; Fossati et al., 2003) is a 40 items self-report questionnaire designed to assess several dimensions of adult attachment ('Confidence',  'Discomfort  with  Closeness',  'Need  for  Approval',  'Preoccupation  with Relationsh ips', and 'Relationships as Secondary'). The five scales showed adequate internal consistency, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients ranging from .76 to .84.

Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). While HR counts the number of heartbeats per minute, HRV is based on the changes in time between successive heartbeats (also called Inter-Beat-Intervals or NN intervals). It can be considered a non-invasive and accurate measure of the Autonomic Nervous System (Laborde et al., 2017). Participants wore a soft textile strap with high quality electrodes designed for fitness that allowed them to move freely during the session. The HR monitor was connected to a compatible mobile app via Bluetooth. Research showed that measuring the HRV with a HR monitor chest strap can be comparable to HRV measured with an electrocardiogram (Gambassi et al., 2020; Plews et al., 2017).

The  raw  data  were  successively  imported  into  Kubios  HRV  Standard  3.3.1  software  that provided satisfactory  tools  for  handling  artefacts  and  analysing  HRV  data  (Tarvainen  et  al., 2014). Participants having at least one measurement with a correction index of artefacts equal to or greater than 5% of the entire trace ( N = 4) were discarded. The baseline measurement was set at 5 minutes, while the measurement of memories (5 minutes maximum time) depended on the length of the telling.

HRV analysis was performed considering Time-domain (i.e., SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50) and Frequency-domain (LF Power, and HF Power) variables.  SDNN indicates Standard Deviation of Normal to Normal (or NN) intervals and reflects the combination of both sympathetic and parasympathetic  influences.  Root  Mean  Square  of  the  Successive  Differences  (RMSSD)  is considered the most relevant and accurate measure of Autonomic Nervous System activity (i.e., vagal tone) (Kleiger et al., 2005). While NN50 is the number of pairs of successive NN (R-R) intervals that differ by more than 50 ms, pNN50 is the percentage of NN50 divided by the total number of NN (R-R) intervals.

Despite the conventional minimum recording standard being 5 min (Malik et al., 1996), ultrashort term recording periods from 60 sec. can also be reliable measurements (Esco &amp; Flatt, 2014; Munoz et al., 2015; Nussinovitch et al., 2011; Salahuddin et al., 2007).

The  Low-Frequency  (LF)  component  of  the  HRV  spectrum  (0.04 -0.15 Hz) provides information on both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity and is generally recorded over a 2 min period (Shaffer et al., 2014). Even though several recordings were shorter than 2 minutes, this parameter was kept for the qualitative and overall HRV analysis. The High-Frequency (HF) power component (0.15 -0.40 Hz) is  considered as  a  marker  of  vagal  modulation  of  cardiac activity and it is generally recorded over a 1 min period (Grossman &amp; Taylor, 2007).

Since the measures were taken in different days with the risk of significant circadian variations in HR and HRV (Massin et al., 2000), the same time of the day was generally maintained. HRV during resting baselines and memory tasks was measured while sitting upright.

## 2.3 Procedure

For the purposes of this explorative study a within subject design was used to gather data. All participants  were  exposed  randomly  in  sequence  to  both  BSP  treatment  and  BSM  control condition. Each memory was assigned to one condition randomly.

This  type  of  experimental  design  was  adopted  because  it  did  not  require  a  large  pool  of participants  and  is  highly  recommended  for  HRV  experiments  because  it  reduces  errors

associated  with  individual  differences  (e.g.,  age  and  gender,  respiratory  rates,  caffeine  and alcohol consumption, smoking, etc.) (Quintana &amp; Heathers, 2014).

The experimental design followed a four-time points structure referred as: assessment (t0), pretreatment (t1), treatment (t2), and post-treatment (t3).

Assessment (t0). Participants completed online questionnaires (MAIA, TCI, and ASQ) a few days before the first meeting with the clinician-researcher. During the first meeting participant was asked to recall and tell in sequence two distressing memories and, immediately after each of them, report the SUDs. The instructions given to participants were to freely tell the memory with no time limits. The clinicianresearcher's task was to listen in silence. Only memories with high SUD scores (SUDs ≥ 6) were accepted.

Pre-treatment (t1). After about a week, at the second meeting, participant short-term (5 minutes) at-rest HRV was recorded. Subsequently, the researcher explained the procedure (psychoeducation of the intervention foreseen in that session, i.e., BSP or BSM) and which of the assessment phase memories would be processed. Then, the participant was invited to recall and retell the memory as if it were the first time, not taking into account that the interlocutor already knew different aspects of that memory and trying not to repeat everything s/he said in the Assessment phase. During the memory telling HRV was recorded. Immediately after the memory telling participants reported the SUD score (i.e., On a scale of 0 -10, where 0 is not disturbance/distress  or  neutral  and  10  is  the  highest  disturbance  you  can  imagine,  how disturbing does the memory feel to you now?).

Treatment (t2). The experimental condition was the 'Inside Window' BSP (Grand, 2009). In this  BSP  technique  clinician-researcher  and  participant  cooperated  to  locate  one  brainspot through  the  participant's  felt  sense  of  the  highest  intensity  of  somatic  activation.  In  Inside Window  eye  position  was  divided  into  two  axes,  X  and  Y.  First,  clinician-researcher  and participant found the most activated (access) spot horizontally (left, center and right along the X axis), and from there they explored vertically (above, at or below eye level on the Y axis).

The BSP set-up was: (1) recall  the  disturbing  memory,  (2)  check  on  activation,  (3)  level  of activation perceived (0 to 10), (4) location of activation in the body, (5) find highest activation tracking horizontally at eye level (X axis), (6) then track above, at and below eye (Y axis) for the highest activation to locate brainspot, (7) focused mindfulness (processing phase), (8) go back to the beginning to assess change, (9) 'squeeze the lemon' (if possible).

In the procedure called 'squeeze the lemon' (Grand, 2009), the participant was guided, after a zero level of activation was attained, to go inside and do whatever was needed doing in order to achieve maximum reactivation level. If at any time this level was more than zero, the processing of the original brainspot continued following the same cycles until activation reached zero.

The participant wore stereophonic headphones with 'Biolateral Sound'.  The audio was listened to  throughout  the  processing  phase and  the  headphones  were  removed  when  the  clinicianresearcher  ended  processing.  The  audio  track  consisted  in  slow  and  continuous  bilateral stimulation with the sound of the sea waves. Volume was set at the lowest audible so as not to distract processing (Grand, 2009).

BSM  was  the  active  control  condition  chosen  from  MBSR  protocol  (Kabat-Zinn,  1990). Although it forms the core of the lying down practices of the MBSR, in this study BSM was practiced sitting on a chair and under the verbal guidance of the clinician-researcher, in the same setting condition of the BSP treatment. The participant was invited to close his/her eyes and to voluntarily shift his/her attention first to specific body parts (e.g., toes, back or head), then to the whole body; and to notice what happens (e.g., sensations such as pain or muscle tension) in the present moment without judging or reacting.

BSP intervention lasted on average 40.317 min. ( SD = 3.426); BSM intervention fixed time was 40 min. The clinician-researcher respected the individual processing time by agreeing with the participant optimal time to stop.

Post-treatment (t3). At the end of the session, the participant was asked to recall and retell the memory again as if it was the first time. The new SUDs and HRV were measured.

After about a week, the participant was then invited to a similar session (t1-t2-t3) in order to process the second memory through the other treatment in the present study' s focus.

## 2.4 Analysis

A within group research design was employed to analyze the data. Statistical analysis through SPSS Version 26.0 was carried out for within group mean comparisons. Changes in SUDs and in  HRV values for each memory told pre- and post-treatment were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVAs. In these analyses, the withingroup factors were Session ('Pre treatment', -'Post treatment') and Intervention ('BSP', 'BSM'). The analysis of these variables was also -conducted  using  Paired-samples  t-tests  and  Wilcoxon  Signed-Ranks  Test  (for  non-normal distribution  data).  Spearman's  correlation  analysis  was  performed  to  analyze  the  correlation between SUDs reduction and self-report questionnaires.

## 3. Results

## 3.1 SUDs analysis

Since for the SUDs at t0 the data were not normally distributed, non-parametric analysis was used to check if there could be a significant variation in the SUDs between assessment and pretreatment for both conditions.

Note: BSP = Brainspotting, BSM = Body Scan Meditation; SUD = Subjective Units of Disturbance; HR = Heart Rate, SDNN = Standard Deviation of Normal-to-Normal R-R, RMSSD = Root Mean Square of  the  Successive  Differences,  pNN50  =  percentage  of  NN50  divided  by  the  total  number  of  NN intervals, LF = Low-Frequency, HF = High-Frequency.

A Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test indicated that pre-test scores were not significantly different from assessment scores for both conditions (BSP Z = -1.629, p = .103; BSM Z = -1.144, p = .253). Furthermore, a paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare the SUDs at t1 in BSP and BSM conditions. There was not a significant difference in the scores for BSP ( M = 6.946, SD = 1.623) and BSM ( M = 7.268, SD = 1.417) conditions;  (27) = -1.000, t p = .326. Thus, the starting point of the SUDs for memories treatment was the same for both conditions (i.e., BSP and BSP).

Prior to conducting the ANOVA, the assumption of normality was evaluated and determined to be satisfied as the two-time (t1 and t3) SUDs distributions were associated with skew and kurtosis less than |2.0| and |9.0|, respectively (Schmider et al., 2010).

Furthermore, the assumption of homogeneity of variances was tested and satisfied based on Levene's F test, (pre -treatment F (1, 54) = .970, p = .329; post-treatment F (1, 54) = .028, p = .867).

A repeated measures ANOVA with between-subjects factor was conducted to compare the effect of BSP and BSM techniques on SUDs in a single session of treatment.

There was a main effect of time (pre/post treatment) on SUDs ( F (1, 54) = 129.979, p &lt; .001, η 2 p = .706) and also a significant effect of condition on SUDs ( F (1, 54) = 7.086, p = .010, η 2 p = .116).  Consistently  with  the  primary  hypothesis,  there  was  a  significant  time  by  condition interaction, F (1, 54) = 5.102, p = .028, η 2 p = .086 (see Figure 1).

Planned comparisons using paired sample t-test revealed that participants in the BSP condition reduced significantly more SUDs after the treatment  (27) = 9.335, t p &lt; .001, d = 1.764; there was also a significant difference pre-post treatment in the BSM condition  (27) = 6.705, t p &lt; .001, d = 1.267.

Results  showed  that,  after  only  about  40  minutes  of  treatment,  BSP  significantly  reduced memory-related SUDs compared with BSM control condition.

The experimental design structured in four time points allowed to measure the change between baseline and pre-treatment at t1 (reactivity during the memory task), to measure the change between pre-  and  post-treatment  (t3-t1),  and  to  compare  the  change  between  baseline-pretreatment difference and baseline-post-treatment difference (recovery from treatment/residual reactivity during the memory task).

Following the same criteria of SUDs analysis, changes in HR and HRV parameters for each memory told from pre- to post-treatment were analyzed with two groups of repeated measures ANOVAs and Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Tests. In these ANOVAs, the within-group factors were Session ('Pre treatment' and 'Post treatment') and Treatment ('BSP' and 'BSM'). --In the first group t1 and t3 referred to HR/HRV pre- and post-treatment values, while in the second group they  referred  to  the  difference  in  percentage  between  the  HR/HRV  baseline  and  the  pretreatment, and  the difference in percentage  between  baseline  and  the  post-treatment, respectively.

## HR/HRV Data analysis 1

There was a main effect of Session ( F (1, 54) = 73.029, p &lt; .001, η 2 p = .575) with HR mean decreasing. There was not a significant Session by Condition interaction ( F (1, 54) = .271, p = .605, η 2 p = .005). A paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare HR mean before and after each condition. There was a significant difference in the scores for pre- (BSP: M = 80,821, SD = 14,409; BSM: M = 82,107, SD = 12,218) and post-treatment (BSP: M = 75,536, SD = 11,983; BSM: M = 77,429, SD = 11,315) sessions both in BSP and BSM conditions,  (27) = 5.502, t p &lt; .001, d = 1.040,  (27) = 7.080, t p &lt; .001, d = 1.338, respectively.

There was a main effect of Session ( F (1, 54) = 8.142, p = .006, η 2 p = .131) with SDNN parameter increasing. A paired-samples t-test revealed that the significant difference in scores for pre- (M = 46.204, SD = 14,127) and post-treatment (M = 49,875, SD = 15,481) sessions happened only in the BSM condition,  (27) = -2.441, t p = .021, d = -0.461.

There  was  a  main  effect  of  Session  ( F (1,  54)  =  15.512, p &lt;  .001, η 2 p =  .223)  with  RMSSD increasing. There was not a significant Session by Condition interaction ( F (1, 54) = .001, p = .980, η 2 p = .000). A paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare RMSSD before and after each condition. There was a significant difference in the scores for pre- (BSP: M = 34.257, SD = 19.001; BSM: M = 30.286, SD = 14.681) and post-treatment (BSP: M = 37.846, SD = 19.829; BSM: M = 33.921, SD = 14.681) sessions both in BSP and BSM conditions,  (27) = -2.418, t p = .023, d = -.457,  (27) = -3.374, t p = .002, d = -.638, respectively.

A  Wilcoxon  Signed-Ranks  Test  indicated  that  both  post-treatment  pNN50  scores  were statistically significantly higher than pre-treatment scores for each condition (BSP Z = -2.273, p = .023; BSM Z = -2.778. p = .005).  The same test showed also that there was not a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-treatment in the Frequency Domain (i.e., LF Power and HF Power parameters, all p &gt; .05).

## HR/HRV Data analysis 2

The  analysis  of  pre-  and  post-  changes  in  terms  of  percentage  difference  compared  to  the baseline  confirmed  the  previous  analysis.  No  significance  interaction  was  found  between Session and Treatment (all p &gt; .05). Paired-samples t-tests showed a significant decrease in scores for HR mean for pre- (BSP: M = 5.710, SD = 8.265; BSM: M = 6.152, SD = 6.691) and post-treatment (BSP: M = -0.871, SD = 7.785; BSM: M = 0.215, SD = 6.956) sessions both in BSP and BSM conditions ( (27) = 5.619,   &lt; .001, t p d = 1.062,  (27) = 6.970, t p &lt; .001, d = 1.317, respectively), a significant increase in scores for SDNN for pre- (BSP: M = 13,833, SD = 28,648; BSM: M = 7,773, SD = 26,566) and post-treatment (BSP: M = 23,443, SD = 32,882; BSM: M = 15,730, SD = 28,486) sessions both in BSP and BSM conditions ( (27) = -2.294, t p = .030, d = -0.434, t (27)  =  -2,204, p =  .036, d =  -0.417,  respectively),  and  no  statistically  significant difference between pre- and post-treatment in the Frequency Domain (i.e., LF Power and HF Power  parameters,  all p &gt;  .05).  A  Wilcoxon  Signed-Ranks  Test  indicated  that  both  posttreatment RMSSD scores were statistically significantly higher than pre-treatment scores for each condition (BSP and BSM Z = -2.550, p = .011).

In summary, results showed that after BSP (and BSM), when participant recalled and retold the distressing memories, there was a significant reduction in HR mean and a significant increase in SDNN,  RMSSD  and  pNN50  parameters.  No  significant  difference  was  found  in  HRV Frequency Domain.

## Correlations

Finally, Spearman's correlation analysis was performed to analyze the correlation between the efficacy in the reduction of SUDs (i.e., the difference in percentage between pre- and posttreatment) reduction and self-report measures of attachment (ASQ), temperament/character (TCI) and interoceptive awareness (MAIA).

The results of the Spearman's Rho test showed a significant negative linear relationship between BSP-SUDs efficacy and TCI-Co subscale ( r s (28) = -.472, p = .011), MAIA 'Noticing' ( r s (28) = -.405, p = .032) and 'Emotional Awareness' ( r s (28) = -.438, p = .020) dimensions. Results of the Spearman correlation indicated also a significant positive association between BSP-SUDs efficacy and ASQ 'Discomfort with Closeness' ( r s (28) = .425, p = .024), and  'Relationships as Secondary' ( r s (28) = .446, p = .017) scales.

Regarding instead the BSM, a significant negative correlation was found between BSM-SUDs efficacy and ASQ 'Confidence' ( r s (28) = -.382, p = .045) scale, MAIA 'Emotional Awareness' ( r s (28) = -.383, p = .044), 'Body Listening' ( r s (28) = -.437, p = .0 20), and 'Trusting' ( r s (28) = .376, p = .049)  dimensions.

Note :  BSP  =  Brainspotting. BSM = Body Scan Meditation; SUDs = Subjective Unit of Disturbance scores; ASQ = Attachment Style Questionnaire, MAIA = Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness, TCI = Temperament and Character Inventory.

To sum up, correlation analysis showed that the low scores obtained in ASQ "Discomfort with Closeness" and "Relationships as Secondary" scales, and the higher scores in MAIA "Noticing" and "Emotional Awareness" scales were associated to greater effectiveness of BSP in reducing SUDs. On the other hand, the effectiveness of BSM was associated to higher scores in ASQ "Confidence" scale and MAIA "Emotional Awareness", "Body Listening" and "Trusting" scales.

## 4. Discussion

The aim of the study was to explore the efficacy of BSP in treating distressing, not necessarily traumatic, memories in a non-clinical sample of adults. Specifically, participants were exposed to BSP Inside Window technique (Grand, 2009) in a single 40-min session for the reprocessing of  a  personal  distressing  memory.  Each  participant  was  also  exposed  to  an  active  control condition (BSM). Both objective (HRV) and subjective (SUDs) measures were used in the study. And in addition, a correlation analysis was performed on the participants' possible dispositional traits that could have influenced the effectiveness of the treatment.

Although, in normal clinical settings, a session of BSP may generally last from 1.5 to 2 hours, in the current study only about 40 minutes of treatment were enough to significantly reduce SUDs by an average of 64%. Moreover, 8 of 28 participants completed all the steps of the technique, including  the  'squeeze  the  lemon'  procedure  (Grand,  2009).  These  outcomes,  that  are significantly  better  than  BSM,  suggest  that  BSP  could  have  a  high  therapeutic  potential applicable not only in psychotraumatology, but also in the treatment of several disorders as previous studies have already shown (Anderegg, 2015; Mattos et al., 2015).

However, it should be noted that BSM was also effective in reducing perceived disturbance by an average of 43%. This outcome supports the idea that the BSM may have its own intrinsic value as an independent clinical resource (Dreeben et al., 2013). Indeed, it seems that having greater confidence in oneself and in others (ASQ "Confidence"), experiencing one's body as safe and trustworthy (MAIA "Trusting"), awareness of the connection between body sensations and emotional states (MAIA 'Emotional Awareness'), and capacity to active listening to the body for insight (MAIA 'Body Listening') could be associated to the BSM therapeutic potential. Indeed, the ASQ 'Confidence' scale reflects a secure attachment style characterized by being able to rely and depend on others in a balanced way and an efficient interactive regulation and autoregulation of internal emotional states (Schore, 1994). Furthermore, research showed that this secure adult orientation is linked to adaptive coping in facing threatening stimuli, such as distressing memories, to increased self-regulation, and could be related to mindfulness and IA in dealing with stress (Bornemann et al., 2015; Fischer et al., 2017; Gibson, 2019; Stevenson et al., 2017).

In the present study, improved vagal modulation recorded after BSM (significant HR decreasing and  HRV  indices  increasing)  may  be  associated  with  a  state  of  calm  and  relaxation  that influenced the subjective memory-related disturbance. However, research indicated that BSM works more through neural mechanisms of sensory-awareness (including the insula and the

pregenual anterior cingulate) than through the relaxation-response (Sevinc et al., 2018). Indeed, several  participants  reported  insights  or  different  perspectives  on  the  event  after  the  BSM, without having thought about the memory during the meditation practice.

Coming back to the core topic of the present study, the primary hypothesis on the BSP efficacy was supported as well  as  by  SUDs also  by  psychophysiological  measures.  Indeed,  after  the treatment participants showed significant indices of lower arousal activation (decreasing of HR mean) and improved HRV Time Domain parameters. The decrease in hyper-arousal associated with an increase in general variability (SDNN) and in vagal tone (RMSSD, pNN50) could be an index  of  parasympathetic  dominance  and  enhanced  efficiency  of  physiological  regulation systems (Laborde et al., 2017). These results seem to be the first evidence in support on the assumption that BSP helps down-regulate the amygdala and promote coherence between SNS and  PNS  activity  (Grand,  2009;  Scaer,  2005).  The  psychophysiological  effects  of  BSP  are comparable to those of BSM and this similarity could be studied further in future research. Instead, identifying which component of the Inside Window BSP technique (e.g., brainspot, Biolateral Sound stimulation, etc.) may have been most relevant to the processing goes beyond this study and would perhaps require a more reductionist laboratory approach.

Regarding the secondary hypothesis, on which characteristics of the participant would favor or hinder the processing of the disturbing memories, correlation analysis showed that awareness of uncomfortabl e, comfortable, and neutral body sensations (MAIA 'Noticing') and awareness of the connection  between  body  sensations  and  emotional  states  (MAIA  'Emotional Awareness')  were  associated  with  the  processing  (focused  mindfulness).  The  more  the participant was able to notice body sensations and was aware of their connection with emotions, the more s/he processed the distressing memory. There is a large body of literature showing IA benefits on emotional regulation (Füstös et al., 2013; Pinna &amp; Edwards, 2020; Price &amp; Hooven, 2018). The key role of sensory (physical and emotional) awareness in reducing distress, and improving emotional regulation found in the present study results suits well a definition of BSP as an attuned treatment approach for effective brain-body healing in therapy (Baumann, 2020).

However,  it  should  be  borne  in  mind  that  study  participants  were  medical  doctors  and psychologists,  who  may  have  developed  expertise  in  observing  their  own  emotional  states related with bodily sensations. Therefore, it would be useful to extend the research to healthy non-therapist subjects and to clinical populations.

Correlation analysis also showed that the more the participants had a personal trait of being agreeable in relationships with other people (TCI Co), and the fewer features of

avoidant/dismissing  attachment  (ASQ  "Discomfort  with  closeness"  and  "Relationships  as secondary" scales), the more effective was BSP in reducing SUDs (for the relationship between TCI-Co trait and ASQ secure attachment style see Martinotti et al., 2008). These findings fit well  with  the  central  role  attributed  to  the  therapeutic  relationship  in  BSP  (Grand,  2013). Therefore, the dual attunement could require not only a mindful therapist, but also a client who can feel comfortable in a close relationship, be willing to bring out disturbing material in the presence of another person, and show a collaborative attitude in engaging with the therapist.

In summary, as enthusiastically observed by thousands of therapists in nearly 20 years of clinical practice,  the  present  study  showed  the  early  empirical  evidence  supporting  the  BSP  high therapeutic potential in processing painful experiences. However, this study was just exploratory and had several limitations that need to be considered.

First,  the  sample  consisted  of  a  few  subjects,  mainly  women  psychologists.  This  particular sample allowed to conduct a study focused on the technique in a single treatment session but did  not  allow  to  extend  results  to  the  general  population,  and  even  less  so  to  the  clinical population. Furthermore, the experimental design lacked one or more follow-up sessions to study the results maintenance in the medium/long term.

Regarding the psychophysiological measures, results must be considered very cautiously due to the limited number of participants, the high individual variability in the HRV parameters, the limits of technical instruments (e.g., the absence of direct measures of respiration, chest belts create more artefacts than electrodes due to friction against the skin) and recordings being short. However, it is also true that HRV results could be easily underestimated (Laborde et al., 2017).

In future research it would be interesting to measure also HRV trend during BSP in both patient and therapist. Furthermore, in the field of BSP research, directions could be important not only to understand and validate this therapeutic tool, but also to deeply study the complex eye/brain interactive mechanisms.
