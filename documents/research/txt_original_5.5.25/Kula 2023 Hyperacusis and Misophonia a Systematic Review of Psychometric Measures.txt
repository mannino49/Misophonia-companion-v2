## Abstract

## Keywords

- ► hyperacusis
- ► misophonia
- ► psychometric instruments and properties

Background Hyperacusis can be de /uniFB01 nedas an intolerance of certain everyday sounds, which are perceived as too loud or uncomfortable and which cause signi /uniFB01 cant distress and impairment in the individual s day-to-day activities. Misophonia is de ' /uniFB01 ned as a high magnitude of emotional and behavioral reaction to certain sounds produced by human beings, such as eating sounds and breathing sounds. Several psychometric instruments have been developed to assess symptoms and the impact of hyperacusis and misophonia; however, to the authors ' knowledge, no study has evaluated and compared the methodological quality of the studies on psychometric properties of the existing instruments.

Purpose This article systematically reviews the research studies assessing the psychometric properties of the instruments used for hyperacusis and misophonia and assesses the quality and appropriateness of the methodologies used.

Research Design Systematic review.

Data Collection and Analysis A systematic literature search was performed using /uniFB01 ve electronic literature databases (PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and Web of Science). Studies were included if they were written in English and reported information about the psychometric properties of instruments measuring hyperacusis or misophonia symptoms or their impact. The quality of the studies and that of the psychometric instruments were evaluated using the consensus-based standards for the selection of health-measurement instruments (COSMIN) tool.

Results The title and abstracts of 916 articles were screened and 39 articles were selected for full-text evaluation, with 14 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. From these 14 articles, 8 different instruments (5 for hyperacusis and 3 for misophonia) were identi /uniFB01 ed and reviewed comprising: (1) Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ), (2) Inventory of Hyperacusis Symptoms, (3) questionnaire on hypersensitivity to sound, (4) Hyperacusis Handicap Questionnaire, (5) short HQ, (6) Amsterdam Misophonia Scale, (7) MisoQuest, and (8) the Misophonia Questionnaire.

Conclusion None of the papers reviewed reported all the information required to meet the COSMIN standards. The studies methodological quality varied between ' ' very good ' and ' inadequate ' depending on their grade on the COSMIN tool. There is a need for further research on the psychometric properties of the instruments included in this review.

Hyperacusis can be de /uniFB01 ned as an intolerance of certain everyday sounds, which are perceived as too loud or uncomfortable and which cause signi /uniFB01 cant distress and impairment in the individual s day-to-day activities. ' 1 Other de /uniFB01 nitions of hyperacusis are largely in agreement with this de /uniFB01 nition, with some differences in details. 2,3 Tyler et al 4 described four categories of hyperacusis comprising (1) loudness hyperacusis, (2) fear hyperacusis, (3) pain hyperacusis, and (4) annoyance hyperacusis. There is some overlap between annoyance hyperacusis and misophonia. A recent consensus study described that misophonia is characterized by the experience of unpleasant or distressing emotions when exposed to certain sounds generated by another individual, especially (but not exclusively) those produced by the human body. 5 In misophonia, the speci /uniFB01 c pattern or meaning of the sound to the individual as opposed to its loudness seem to be the key contributing factor to the individual s ' reaction. Individuals with misophonia often experience suffering, distress, or cannot tolerate sounds associated with oral functions (e.g., chewing, eating), nasal sounds (e.g., breathing and snif /uniFB01 ng), as well as non-oral/-nasal sounds (e.g., pen clicking, keyboard typing, clock ticking). 5

structural validity (the degree to which the scores of the instrument is an adequate re /uniFB02 ection of the dimensionality of the construct to be measured), (4) hypotheses testing (the degree to which scores on the instrument are consistent with hypothesized relationship with other instruments), (5) cross-cultural validity (the degree to which items on a translated or adapted measure correspond to the performance of the original items), and (6) criterion validity (the degree to which scores correspond with a gold standard measure).

Prevalence estimates range from 2 to 15.2% for hyperacusis 6,7 and 6 to 49.1% for misophonia. 8 -10 It is likely that the discrepancy in prevalence reports is related to the differences in study populations and the way that hyperacusis and misophonia were assessed and diagnosed.

Several psychometric instruments have been developed and applied in research and clinical practice to evaluate hyperacusis and/or misophonia. The methodologies used to design and evaluate the psychometric properties of these instruments (e.g., validity, reliability, sensitivity to change) are very diverse. The two important psychometric properties are reliability and validity which are essential for choosing suitable instruments for research or clinical purposes. 11 Reliability comprises measures of internal consistency (degree of interrelatedness among the items), test -retest reliability (consistency of scores obtained at different times), interrater reliability (consistency of scores obtained by different raters), and measurement error (the systematic and randomerror of a patient s score that is not attributed to true ' changes in the construct to be measured). 12 Validity is de /uniFB01 ned as the extent to which an instrument measures what it claims to measure 13 and comprises (1) content validity (the degree to which the questions on the instrument represent the construct that it seeks to measure 14 ), (2) construct validity (the extent to which the instrument validly measures the construct it purports to measure), (3)

Studies assessing the psychometric properties of hyperacusis and misophonia instruments have used inconsistent methods. For example, participants in some studies were recruited from hospital patient referrals 15 -17 while others from the general population or university students. 9,18 Some of these instruments are validated in languages other than English and the English versions although published, have not been validated. 19 In addition, among the published papers there are some discrepancies regarding reporting of the important psychometric properties of the instruments they evaluated or developed. As the result of these discrepancies, it may not be clear to many audiologists whether the psychometric properties of the existing hyperacusis and misophonia questionnaires meet the standards required for them to be used effectively in research and/or clinical practice.

To develop a greater understanding of the reliability and validity of the existing hyperacusis and misophonia instruments, a systematic review of the literature can be extremely informative. Systematic reviews provide a summary of the strengths and weaknesses of the existing questionnaires, appraise the methodological quality of published studies, and discuss the differences between them 20 ; the results of which, can guide clinical practice and research.

Consensus-based standards for the selection of healthmeasurement instruments (COSMIN) were developed to provide a comprehensive methodological tool for assessing the methodological quality of patient-reported outcome measures. 21 COSMIN is an initiative of an international multidisciplinary team of researchers with a background in epidemiology, psychometric, medicine, qualitative research, and health care, who have expertise in the development and evolution of outcome-measurement instruments. They developed the COSMIN risk of bias checklist that can be used in systematic reviews to assess the methodological quality of the studies included to the review. 22,23

The present study aimed to systematically review the psychometric properties of the existing hyperacusis and

misophonia questionnaires, summarize their strengths and weaknesses, and appraise the methodological quality of published studies against the criteria set by COSMIN tool. 21,23

## Methods

This systematic review was conducted in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline 24 and it was registered with the PROSPERO database (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/ prospero; registration number: CRD42021235539).

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

The following inclusion criteria for articles were applied: (1) published in English, (2) published in a peer-reviewed journal, and (3) detailed the development or evaluated the measurement properties of instruments measuring hyperacusis or misophonia symptoms or their impact.

Articles were excluded if they: (1) were not indexed in a recognized database, (2) did not report at least one psychometric property as de /uniFB01 ned by the COSMIN checklist (information relating to the psychometric properties are presented ► Appendix 1 ), and (3) were a review, personal/ expert opinions and manuals, guidelines, or reported animal studies and any unpublished and incomplete studies.

## Search Strategy

An initial search was conducted on January 29, 2021. A systematic search was performed in the following electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. We entered a speci /uniFB01 c search term strategy in each search engine ( ► Table 1 ), searching in articles topics, titles, abstracts, and keywords. The database search was conducted without setting any limits in terms of the publication date of the studies. If possible, /uniFB01 lters were applied to /uniFB01 nd related articles in the English language only and with humans only. The reference lists of any relevant articles were checked throughout the process to ensure that any related studies were not missed. Original searches were last updated on April 29, 2021. Prior to submitting the /uniFB01 nal revision of this article on June 17, 2022, a quick search was conducted to double check if any new studies have emerged with regard to the questionnaires reviewed in this article which did not show any new relevant studies.

## Selection Criteria

After the removal of duplicate articles, one reviewer (F.K.) screened titles and abstracts to identify eligible articles. The reference lists of any relevant articles were also reviewed by the /uniFB01 rst author. Then, two reviewers (F.K. and H.A.) screened the full text of the articles independently. The decision regarding the inclusion/exclusion of studies was made as a result of two reviewers ' judgment about the selection of the articles and to verify interrater reliability of the full text screening, we calculated the Kohen s kappa value which was ' 0.65 indicating substantial agreement between the two reviewers. 25 Any disagreements were resolved by the third reviewer (M.C.).

## Data Extraction

Psychometric properties including content validity, structural validity, internal consistency, reliability, hypothesis testing for construct validity, cross-cultural validity, measurement error, criterion validity, and responsiveness were extracted from studies in line with recommendations speci /uniFB01 edintheCOSMIN guidelines. 22 Other extracted information was country of origin, number of samples, gender, study population, and instrument-related factors such as construct measured, numberof items, range of total score, and response options. All data were extracted by the /uniFB01 rst author in May 2021.

## Evaluation of Methodological Quality

Two reviewers independently applied the COSMIN checklist for all included studies according to the recommended guidelines. Discrepancies of opinions were resolved by consensus between the two reviewers or, if the agreement was not achieved, disagreements were discussed and resolved through consultation with the third reviewer. No one graded any of their own papers.

The methodological quality of studies and their psychometric properties were assessed using the COSMIN checklist 21 as shown in Appendix 1. Based on this assessment we reported whether the above-mentioned nine domains were assessed or adequately reported by various studies on psychometric properties of the hyperacusis and misophonia questionnaires.

## Evaluation of Psychometric Properties of the Included Instruments

Each measurement property was rated by applying a four-point COSMIN risk of bias scale (4 ¼ ' very good, '

3 ¼ ' adequate, ' 2 ¼ ' doubtful, ' 1 ¼ ' inadequate ). Consistent ' with COSMIN instructions, the overall quality rating for each measurement property was determined by taking the ' worst score counts ' method (i.e., the lowest rating of any of the items in a given category). 23 For the next step, the result of individual studies on measurement properties was also evaluated against COSMIN 2018 updated criteria for good measurement properties ( ► Appendix 1 ). The assessment resulted in rating for each questionnaire: suf /uniFB01 cient ( þ ), insuf /uniFB01 cient ( -), or indeterminate (?). We used this information to create a table that demonstrates whether the key nine psychometric properties were reported for each questionnaire and if they meet the COSMIN criteria.

Interrater reliability between the two reviewers was 82.0% (kappa: 0.73) for the risk of bias ratings, and 84.5% (kappa ¼ 0.82) for the measurement properties, indicating substantial agreement between the two reviewers. 25

## Results

## Study Selection

A total of 1,040 articles were identi /uniFB01 ed through the initial search ( ► Fig. 1 ), and 10 additional articles were identi /uniFB01 ed through a review of citations. After removing duplicates, 916 articles were screened based on their title and abstract, and 39 articles were selected for full-text assessment. As a result of this full-text evaluation, 25 of the 39 articles were removed because they focused on the different constructs or did not report any psychometric property de /uniFB01 ned by the COSMIN checklist. In addition, one of the articles was not included in this study because it was published in a preda-

tory journal. 26 Fourteen articles were included in this review, and from these 14 articles, 8 different hyperacusis and misophonia instruments were evaluated. 9,10,15 -19,27 -33 See the PRISMA /uniFB02 ow diagram in ► Fig. 1 .

## Study and Participant s Characteristics '

► Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the included studies. The eligible studies were published from 2002 to 2020. Approximately 20% of the studies were conducted in the U.K. 9,15,28 and 13% in the U.S. 10,29 and Italy. 17,33 The rest of the studies were conducted in India, 32 Belgium, 30 Germany, 16 Japan, 31 Turkey, 27 Poland, 19 and France. 18 The most used questionnaire reported was the Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ) developed by Khalfa et al in 2002. 18 All questionnaires were developed to assess or diagnose hyperacusis or misophonia.

- ► Table 2 also shows the participants ' characteristics of the studies included to this review. Sample sizes for these studies ranged between 46 and 705 individuals from the general population and/or clinical population. Most studies included clinical populations ( n ¼ 9) and two studies reported student populations, with the remainder utilizing individuals from the general population ( n ¼ 3).

## Psychometric Instruments for Hyperacusis and Misophonia

► Table 3 provides a summary of the description of the questionnaires including /uniFB01 ve hyperacusis and three misophonia instruments. All measures utilized the Likert-type scales using 3 to 5 points scale. In addition, the structure of the included instruments varies greatly; /uniFB01 ve measures have three-factor structure, 10,16,18,32,33 two measures have one-factor structure, 9,19 and the other measure has a /uniFB01 ve-factor structure. 29

## The Methodological Quality of the Included Studies

► Table 4 summarizes methodological quality ratings for the 14 studies included to the review. All the studies reported more than one psychometric property. In addition, all studies reported internal consistency. Most studies described hypotheses testing for construct validity (11/14) and structural validity (8/14). Only a small number of studies included psychometric data on cross-cultural validity (2 studies), reliability (1 study), and measurement error (1 study). No information was retrieved on responsiveness and criterion validity in any study.

## Psychometric Properties of the Included Instruments

► Table 5 presents ratings for each psychometric instrument. The psychometric properties extracted from the studies were evaluated against the criteria for good psychometric properties on the COSMIN. None of the instruments could be fully evaluated over all nine psychometric properties as the necessary data was not always reported.

## Discussion

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the quality of psychometric properties of the current hyperacusis

and misophonia instruments (until April 2021) using the COSMIN guidelines. The COSMIN checklist is a well-known toolandhasbeendevelopedinconjunctionwithotherexisting guidelines for systematic reviews, such as the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention, 34 the PRISMA statement, 35 and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Emulation principles.

## The Methodological Quality of the Included Studies and Psychometric Properties of the Instruments

To our knowledge, this is the /uniFB01 rst systematic review to evaluate the measurement properties of instruments designed to measure hyperacusis or misophonia across a range of health-care contexts and settings. This review identi /uniFB01 ed eight measures ( /uniFB01 ve for hyperacusis and three for misophonia) and 14 studies on the psychometric properties of these instruments. In general, the methodological quality of the included studies in this review varied between ' very good ' and ' inadequate ' across all psychometric properties based on the COSMIN tool. None of the identi /uniFB01 ed instruments has reported all nine psychometric properties recommended by COSMIN.

According to the COSMIN guideline (2018), content validity is considered an important measurement property of an instrument. 21 However, none of the included articles reported using adequate methods to assess content validity. One explanation is that the constructs of hyperacusis and misophonia are not fully understood. Therefore, it was not possible to rate this following the COSMIN recommendation. However, all the questions within the various questionnaires appeared to have good content validity, as the questionnaires appeared to have included all the relevant items measuring the constructs in question. In addition, the questionnaires have been designed by clinicians and/or researchers working with patients who experience hyperacusis and/or misophonia so they were in a good position to create relevant items.

In terms of structural validity, six studies did not report any psychometric data. The rest of the studies '

methodological quality for structural validity varied between ' very good ' and ' inadequate ' according to COSMIN risk of bias checklist assessment. This mainly was due to studies only reporting exploratory factor analysis without con /uniFB01 rmatory factor analysis (CFA). To test the factor structure, CFA or item response theory (IRT) analysis are preferred according to the COSMIN checklist. 36

None of the instruments reported on all three psychometric properties within the domain of reliability (reliability, internal consistency, and measurement error). Only one measurement instrument (MisoQuest) reported reliability with measuring interclass correlation coef /uniFB01 -cient, while all instruments reported internal consistency with receiving a very good score for study quality. Although measurement error is clinically important because as more error is introduced into the score, the lower the reliability will be, only one article that tested MisoQuest, 18 reported it.

None of the studies reported information on criterion validity. As there is no universally accepted gold standard to measure hyperacusis and misophonia, this feature of criterion validity could not be reported in this review. In addition, cross-cultural validity was reported in two studies 17,27 with doubtful ratings. However, /uniFB01 ve studies 10,16,18,19,29 included in this review did not conduct cross-cultural validity because the measures were developed and validated in the original language.

Hypotheses testing for construct validity were reported in 11 studies (78.6%) with ratings of either very good, adequate, or doubtful. Only four studies, 15,16,29,30 reported both convergent and discriminant validity according to COSMIN risk of bias assessment. Except for these four studies, the remaining studies had limited evidence for construct validity.

► Table 5 gives information about the results of each study on the different measurement properties, and it was rated as suf /uniFB01 cient ( þ ), insuf /uniFB01 cient ( -), or indeterminate (?) following COSMIN criteria for good measurement properties. There is insuf /uniFB01 cient evidence within the included papers to making a judgment on their overall quality. Therefore, we chose not to summarize the results and thus not to grade the total level of evidence per psychometric instruments.

There are some other hyperacusis questionnaires used in clinics and research, but these were not reviewed as their relevant publications did not provide the psychometric properties required by COSMIN. One questionnaire, for example, is the Multiple-Activity Scale for Hyperacusis, by Dauman and Bouscau-Faure. 37 The development procedure and metrics were not reported in this paper, so it was not possible to review its psychometric properties.

Several newly developed hyperacusis and misophonia questionnaires were not included in this reviewas the results of their psychometric properties were not published in a peer-reviewed journal at the time our original literature search. 1,38,39 Therefore, it was not possible to evaluate them with the COSMIN checklist in this review. Future reviews should assess the questionnaires which were published from April 2021.

In this systematic review, the populations within included studies varied, with both clinical and nonclinical samples. Clinicians desiring to select measures for clinical use should consider how generalizable the results are to the intended population, taking into account the populations from which the data in these studies were generated. For example, Inventory of Hyperacusis Symptoms (IHS) 29 appears to be internally consistent in both clinical and nonclinical populations. The MisoQuest 19 is internally consistent for the clinical population. The HQ originally developed by Khalfa et al 18 was internally consistent for just general population and Fackrell et al 28 investigated the validity and reliability of the HQ in a population who had tinnitus. They found the HQ to have high internal consistency (Cronbach s ' α ¼ 0.88) but CFA revealed that the proposed three-factor and an alternative one-factor structure were poor. Therefore, HQ does not seem to work well within a tinnitus population. Future studies should endeavor to use clinical population of patients with hyperacusis or misophonia when developing questionnaires.

## Implications for Future Research

Given the recent measures being adapted for use in other countries and languages, we believe that there is a need for appropriate and more testing for cross-cultural validity. Studies with different cultural groups should perform factor analyses for multiple groups and complete measurement invariance or differential item functioning to give information on whether the measures are equivalent when used in different cultures/languages. For example, MisoQuest was developed in Polish, and validation has only been performed in a Polish population. Therefore, for future directions, validation and cross-cultural evaluation of MisoQuest are needed for other countries and different languages.

Regarding structural validity, future studies should perform factor analyses using CFA or IRT for seven instruments (HQ, IHS, Hyperacusis Handicap Questionnaire [HHQ], short HQ[SHQ], questionnaire on hypersensitivity to sound [GUF], Misophonia Questionnaire [MQ], Amsterdam Misophonia Scale [A-MISO-S]).

To gain a comprehensive picture of reliability, all elements of reliability should be assessed. Internal consistency has been assessed for all instruments, but future studies should assess test -retest, interrater, and intrarater reliability for HQ, IHS, SHQ, GUF, MQ, MisoQuest, A-MISO-S, and HHQ. Measurement error also needs to be assessed for all eight instruments.

We also believe that future studies measuring content validity should state more explicitly how they evaluated content validity and follow COSMIN criteria when developing and reporting a new measure. This may include exploring the relevance, comprehensiveness, and comprehensibility of the measure among a suf /uniFB01 cient sample of participants and professionals, which could lead to more credible evidence of its content validity.

All the available questionnaires regarding hyperacusis and misophonia are designed for adults and therefore may not be appropriate for use in children and adolescents.

Therefore, future studies are needed for the development of new questionnaires in these speci /uniFB01 c groups.

Responsiveness is de /uniFB01 ned as the ability of the psychometric instrument to detect change over time in the construct measured. 36 This review showed that responsiveness to change has not formally been tested for hyperacusis and misophonia questionnaires. However, HQ and A-MISO-S have been used in several interventional studies and appear to be sensitive to change 40 -48 (scores have changed following treatment). This provides some evidence for responsiveness. More systematic studies are needed to further explore responsiveness to change and the cutoff for meaningful or clinically signi /uniFB01 cant change in hyperacusis and misophonia questionnaires.

## Conclusion

This study systematically reviewed publications that evaluated the psychometric properties of eight hyperacusis and misophonia instruments using COSMIN guidelines (i.e., HQ, IHS, HHQ, SHQ, GUF, MQ, A-MISO-S, and MisoQuest). Evidence concerning psychometric properties was limited and no single measure of hyperacusis and/or misophonia was found to meet all nine methodological quality standards according to the COSMIN guideline. There is a need for further research on the psychometric properties of the instruments included in this review.
