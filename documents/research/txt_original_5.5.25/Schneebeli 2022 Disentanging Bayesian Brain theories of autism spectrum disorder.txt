## Abstract

Background : Bayesian  theories  of  perception  have  provided  a  variety  of  alternative mechanistic  explanations  for  autistic  symptoms,  including  (1)  overprecise  sensations,  (2) imprecise priors, (3) inflexible priors, and (4) altered hierarchical learning. Here, we designed a  set  of  experiments  to  systematically  test  predictions  from  each  of  the  four  hypotheses  in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Methods :  Two versions of a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) random dot motion task were developed to disentangle the influence of sensory inputs and prior expectations and test implications  of  the  four  Bayesian  hypotheses.  Using  a  cross-sectional  observational  study design, behavioural data were obtained from participants with autism spectrum disorder ( N =47) and a control group ( N =50). Analyses used mixed effects models and a drift diffusion model.

Results : Contrary to the sensory overprecision hypothesis, individuals with ASD did not differ from controls in performance or parameter estimates during the perceptual 2AFC task. When adding cues to the task, individuals with ASD profited less from this prior information than controls, as predicted by the imprecise prior hypothesis. However, individuals with ASD were still able to update their initial priors, contradicting the inflexible prior hypothesis. Finally, in line with the hierarchical learning hypothesis, volatility differentially modulated expectation effects, exerting a significantly smaller effect in the ASD group compared to the control group.

Conclusion : Our findings support two mutually compatible alterations of perception in ASD (imprecise priors and, to a lesser degree, altered hierarchical learning). By contrast, they are not compatible with the notions of sensory overprecision and inflexible priors.

## Introduction

Autism has long been described as a condition associated with difficulties in social interactions, repetitive behaviours, and difficulties in dealing with changes. 1,2 While early theories of autism suggested  social  deficits  as  the  core  of  the  disorder, 3-5 subsequent  work  has  proposed  that autism  may  be  a  primarily  perceptual  disorder  of  which  social  deficits  arise  as  secondary symptoms. 6,7

Concomitant  with  this  shift,  Bayesian  models  of  perception  have  become  an  increasingly popular framework for explaining autistic symptoms. 8-11 The key idea behind these Bayesian accounts is that perception combines current sensory information with a priori beliefs (Figure 1A) and represents an act of inference, driven by precision-weighted prediction errors 12 (Figure 1B). In the context of autism, it was suggested that perception in affected individuals is altered by  a  shift  in  precision  weights,  leading  to  a  domination  of  sensory  inputs  relative  to  prior information and increased weighting of prediction errors, which, in turn, results in overfitting and a lack of generalization. Notably, both increased sensory precision and decreased precision of prior beliefs could lead to this imbalance. However, the exact mechanism that causes this imbalance is being debated. 8,11,13,14

Specifically, there are at least four different mechanisms that could explain an overemphasis of sensory information in a Bayesian framework (Figure 1). As explained in the following, all of these four mechanisms have previously been hypothesized to result in autistic symptoms.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of a Bayesian model of perception in autism ( A) The percept is a combination of the bottom-up sensory information (likelihood) and predictions (prior beliefs) from an internal model of the world. The mismatch between the prediction or prior belief and the sensory input results in a prediction error, which serves to update the belief. ( B) Left: Illustration of the belief update and percept using Gaussian distributions. Prior and likelihood are combined in a statistical optimal manner (according to Bayes' rule) to yield a posterior (percept). Right: A generic form of belief updates in Bayesian models: belief updates are proportional to prediction errors, weighted by a ratio of sensory,  sensory , and prior precision,  prior, .  ( C) Sensory dominance in autistic perception might be caused by different  mechanisms:  high  sensory  precision  (H1),  or  low  prior  precision  (H2),  high,  inflexible prediction errors, indicating a failure of correct prior updating (H3) and deficits in hierarchical learning leading to an overestimation of volatility (H4).

First, individuals with ASD could have more precise sensory channels. 13 Since the individual weighting of prior expectations in a Bayesian framework depends on the relative uncertainty of the information sources, highly precise sensory information would decrease the effect of prior  expectations.  This overprecise  sensation  hypothesis (H1)  is  closely  related  to  the 'Enhanced Perceptual Functioning' theory 7 and  motivated  by  reports  that  individuals  with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are more sensitive to pitch and loudness in discrimination tasks than healthy controls. 15-17

Second,  sensory  processing  itself  may  not  be  affected  in  individuals  with  ASD,  but  prior information is considered unreliable (i.e. of low precision). 18 Here, this is referred to as the imprecise prior hypothesis (H2).

A third proposal is that individuals with ASD can appropriately acquire prior knowledge but are inflexible in adjusting these beliefs at a later stage. This inflexible prior hypothesis (H3) was,  for  instance,  motivated  by  work  showing  that  individuals  with  ASD  have  difficulties updating priors in a multisensory integration task. 19

Finally, it has been proposed that perceptual deficits in individuals with ASD may arise from abnormalities at higher levels of inference hierarchies. This hierarchical learning hypothesis (H4)  derives  from  hierarchical  Bayesian  models  of  perception  (e.g.  predictive  coding), 20,21 where  predictions  and  prediction  errors  are  exchanged  between  hierarchical  layers  that represent increasingly abstract aspects of the world. More specifically, this hypothesis suggests that higher processing levels might be more affected than lower ones. 14 Empirically, this is supported by work showing that in individuals with ASD higher-order beliefs (about volatility) may be overestimated. 22

While recent studies have begun to test these competing hypotheses empirically, 19,22-35 the results have been inconsistent and difficult to reconcile. There may be a number of reasons for that: (i) most studies only tested a subsets of the above hypotheses, (ii) some studies did not examine individuals with a diagnosis of ASD, but  non-affected individuals with autistic traits 26,29,31 and (iii) those that tested diagnosed individuals mostly had relatively small sample sizes, ranging from N =14-26. 19,22,24,25,28,30-33,35-37 Only three studies 23,27,34 employed larger sample sizes (up to 56) but provided inconsistent results.

Here, we tested predictions of all four hypotheses in a cross-sectional study with 47 participants with ASD (AG: ASD group) and 50 age and gender matched controls (control group; CG). We used two versions of a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) motion discrimination task in which we probed the integration of sensory processing with prior expectations. The paradigm was specifically designed to disentangle the predictions made by the four hypotheses outlined above and involved several components of learning. Using both model-agnostic analyses and a computational model of the behavioural decision-making, we found evidence supporting the presence  of  imprecise  priors  and  altered  hierarchical  learning,  but  no  evidence  for  the overprecise sensations or inflexible priors hypothesis in ASD.

## Methods

## Study Design

The data presented in this paper are part of a larger study on ASD that was conducted at the Translational  Neuromodeling  Unit  (University  of  Zurich  and  ETH  Zurich).  The  study  was approved  by  the  cantonal  ethics  committee  (BASEC-Nr:  2016-0838)  (see  Supplementary Material: Study design).

The analysis plan for this experiment and its revisions are available on an online repository (https://gitlab.ethz.ch/tnu/analysis-plans/schneebelietal_biasd_mdt) (for updates and specifications of the analyses evaluated in the current work, see also Supplementary Material: Analysis plan). A review of the analysis code was conducted by a project member (AR) not involved in the initial data analysis (https://gitlab.ethz.ch/tnu/code/schneebelietal_biasd_mdt). An a priori power analysis (G*Power) indicated an overall sample size of 102 participants (51 per group) to detect a group difference of medium effect size (Cohen's d =0.5, two-sample ttest) with type I error probability of 0.05 and type II error probability of 0.8.

## Participants

To account for possible dropouts, we recruited slightly more participants than the estimated N =51 per group. Specifically, 54 participants with a diagnosis of ASD and 57 age-, genderand  handedness-matched  controls  were  included  in  the  study.  The  diagnosis  of  ASD  was independently verified by a board-certified psychiatrist with specialisation in ASD (HH). After the  application  of  the  exclusion  criteria  for  data  analysis  (see  Supplementary  Material: Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria), an overall sample of 97 participants remained: 50 controls (CG) (27 male/23 female) and 47 participants with ASD (AG) (17 male/30 female). These sample sizes are slightly smaller than those recommended by the power analysis (i.e., N =51 per group). We  used  the  Autism  Quotient  (AQ)  and  four  neuropsychological  tests  (see  Table  1  and Supplementary Material: Neuropsychological tests) to assess symptom levels and exclude that effects were driven by differences in cognitive and intellectual abilities between the groups.

## Experimental design

Non-cued motion discrimination task (NCMDT)

#Question: "In which direction will the dots move next? Place the further out the more confident you are point

Figure 2 Schematic depiction of the non-cued motion discrimination task (NCMDT) and the cued motion discrimination task (CMDT). ( A) During the NCMDT, participants were first asked to fixate on the centre of the screen (fixation period). After the inter-trial interval and a successful fixation period of 100ms was registered (eye tracking), the random dot motion stimulus would appear at the centre of the screen until participants indicated their estimated motion with a saccade to the left or right target location (Pac-Man symbol). If no response was given within 2500ms, the trial was registered as a missed trial and feedback was given accordingly. Following a successfully registered saccade, the Pac-Man

fixating on the centre again, before the next trial would be initiated. Participants played through 280 One of seven motion strengths was selected for the stimulus in a certain trial in  both  tasks.  The  absolute  values  of  the  motion  strength  indicate  the  fraction  of  the  dots  moving accordingly in one direction (negative numbers=leftward motion, positive numbers=rightward motion). (C) The trial in CMDT is identical to the NCMDT except that an arrow cue was presented before each stimulus providing additional information about the upcoming motion direction, followed by a cuestimulus interval (CS-Interval). (D) The probability of the validity of the cue varied across the CMDT (valid  and  invalid  phases:  85%  and  15%  correct  indication  of  the  upcoming  motion  direction, respectively). Moreover, we distinguish between rapid alternations between the two phases (volatile) or longer periods of one validity phase (stable). (E) Zoom into a partial sequence of the trace with example  responses  from  a  participant.  Trials  can  be  separated  into  different  categories  (grey  dots: response, blue dots: cue). 1. Valid or invalid cue: A valid cue in a trial correctly indicates the upcoming motion direction independently of its phase (upper blue dots). 2. Expected and unexpected outcomes: If a valid cue appears during an invalid phase or an invalid cue appears during a valid phase, the outcome is labelled unexpected (yellow circle around blue dot). 3. Correct or incorrect response: A participant's response is correct if it indicates the correct motion direction, independently of the cue or phase (red circle around incorrect responses). 4. Cue consistent or inconsistent: If a participant's response follows the cue independently of its validity, it is labelled as 'cue consistent' (upper dots). 5. Phase consistent: If a participant's response follows the overall phase of the cue (following the cue during valid phases, not following the cue during invalid phases) it is labelled 'phase consistent' (pink shaded responses).

(F) In addition, in 15 trials instead of the stimulus presentation, a question was presented after the cue. Participants were asked to indicate the expected upcoming stimulus direction and their confidence in this prediction.

The experiment consisted of two consecutive 2AFC tasks: A non-cued motion discrimination task (NCMDT ; Figure 2A) and a cued motion discrimination task ( CMDT ; Figure 2C). In the NCMDT, participants were asked to make decisions about the motion direction of a moving dot stimulus (motion coherence levels in percent: [-51.2, -12.6, -3.2, ±0, +3.2, +12.6, +51.2]%, uniform distribution)  (Figure  2B).  Responses  were  made  by  a  saccade  towards  a  Pac-Man shaped target on the left or on the right side and recorded with an infrared eye tracker 39 (see Supplementary Material: Apparatus). Feedback was given for correct and incorrect responses and a progress bar indicate the accumulated points, which would result in an extra monetary compensation. The CMDT, was identical to the NCMDT except that an arrow cue pointing towards the left or the right side appeared prior to the motion stimulus, which would provide additional prior information about the upcoming motion direction (Figure 2C). Critically, the

validity of the cue followed a probabilistic pattern with changing volatility (Figure 2D&amp;E). Additionally, to assess beliefs about the cue in the absence of motion, on every eleventh trial (24 trials) instead of the motion stimulus a question appeared immediately after the cue asking about the expected motion direction and their confidence thereof (Figure 2F). This response was given by pressing the arrows on the keyboard and moving a dot along a line. Overall, participants played 280 trials of the NCMDT and 266 trials of the CMDT in a consecutive order. For detailed descriptions of the tasks see Supplementary Material: Task design.

## Drift-diffusion Model

A drift-diffusion model (DDM) was fit to the choice behaviour and reaction time (RT) 40,41 (see Supplementary  Material:  Drift-Diffusion  Model).  The  model  used  here  has  three  free parameters: a non-decision time 𝑇 𝑒𝑟 , a drift 𝑣 , and a boundary 𝑏 . To assess the NCMDT, the starting point 𝑧0 was fixed to 𝑏 2 , the center between the two boundaries thus indicating no bias towards either choice (left or right) (H1). For the CMDT, the starting point was a free variable which indicated a bias towards the current  ( 𝑧0 in valid phases and -𝑧0 in invalid phases). The non-decision  time  reflects additional sensory and  motor  delays  outside  the evidence accumulation process. The drift and the boundary describe the evidence accumulation process. The faster evidence is accumulated, the higher the drift. The boundary describes the threshold, at which point the accumulation process stops and a decision is made. Before fitting the model to our data, we first assured in simulations that all model parameters could be successfully recovered (see Supplementary Material: Parameter recovery analysis).

## Behavioural readouts

For the model-based (DDM) analysis in both the CMDT and NCMDT, we used the percent correct responses (PC) and the reaction time (RT).

In  addition,  for  the  model-agnostic  analyses,  we  labelled  trials  and  responses  based  on  the information provided by the cue and the individual response to the cue in the CMDT (Figure 2F). Specifically, we defined the following behavioural readouts:

-  Cue  consistency: Cue  consistent trials  are  trials  on  which  the  individual  response follows the direction indicated by the current cue. Specifically, during invalid phases, this is a metric which indicates to what extent individuals follow a-priori information

perpetuity. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in The copyright holder for this this version posted February 8, 2022. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.07.22270242 doi: medRxiv preprint

provided by the cue itself over the accurately learned phase about the validity of the cue.

-  Phase consistency: Phase consistent trials are trials on which the judgement of motion direction mirrors the cue during valid phases and opposes to the cue direction during invalid phases. This information is particularly meaningful for zero coherence trials where behaviour is predominantly guided by the cue.
-  Outcome expectancy: If a valid cue appears during an invalid phase or an invalid cue appears during a valid phase, the trial outcome is labelled unexpected .  For instance, during a valid phase of the cue (85% correct predictions of the motion direction), a trial outcome would be considered unexpected if the cue points in the opposite direction of the following motion direction (15% of trials) and conversely for the other (Figure 2E). Note that expectancy here refers to the true probability structure, not to an individual's trial-wise level of surprise.
-  Stability: Stable trials  include  all  trials  during  a  stable  phase,  independently  of  its validity (first and last 98 trials; Figure 2D). Volatile trials correspond to all trials during the volatile phase where the cue validity changes every 14 trials.

In  the  intermittent  question  trials  (see  Figure  2F),  a  cue  was  shown  without  a  subsequent stimulus, followed by an explicit question about cue confidence. That is,  participants were asked  to  indicate  which  motion  direction  they  expected  given  the  cue  they  just  saw.  This response was given on a continuous scale which allowed for assessing the confidence in this expectation (compare Figure 2F). The following three definitions are related to these question trials only:

-  Reported cue consistency: If participants choose the same direction as the cue, their explicitly reported cue consistency is 1, otherwise it is 0.
-  Reported phase consistency: If participants' explicit prediction was phase consistent (see above), the reported phase consistency is 1. Note that this judgment is made in the absence of any stimulus and can thus only rely on the information associated with the cue.
-  Reported cue confidence: Absolute distance from 0.5 (centre of the bar). Any value between 0 and 1 was possible (0.01 step size).

## Hypotheses Testing

As described in the Introduction, there are multiple competing Bayesian hypotheses explaining symptoms in ASD: the overprecise sensation hypothesis (H1), the imprecise prior hypothesis (H2), the inflexible prior hypothesis (H3) and the hierarchical learning hypothesis (H4). We aimed  to  disentangle  these  different  hypotheses  using  a  new  experimental  design  and  a predefined analysis (the analysis plan incl. its revisions can be found at https://gitlab.ethz.ch/tnu/analysis-plans/biasd_sensory_uncertainty_task). A detailed description of the hypotheses and how we tested them is given in the Supplementary Material: Hypotheses testing. An overview of the tested and confirmed hypotheses is given in Table 3.

For  lack  of  space,  the  preprocessing  procedures  used  in  this  study  are  described  in  the Supplementary Material: Outlier removal.

## Statistical analyses

In general, we adopted a significance level of 𝑝 ≤ 0.05 .  For tests between two samples we used  the  MATLAB (MathWorks, version 2016b) functions ttest2 for  parametric  testing  of homoscedastic data (tested by Levene's test), or ranksum (Wilcoxon rank sum test) for nonparametric  testing  and crosstab (χ 2 -test)  for  testing  proportions,  respectively.  Generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) and repeated measures ANOVAs were calculated in R (version 3.5.2) using the package afex . Greenhouse-Geissner (GG) correction for the analyses of variance was applied if variances were not equal (tested by Mauchly's test of sphericity) to reduce type-I-errors. For binary data in mixed effect models, i.e. for the analysis of interaction effects on correct and incorrect trials, we employed a GLMM, therefore GG correction was not applied.

We corrected post-hoc tests within an ANOVA using the family-wise error correction Tukey's HSD.  For  stimuli  different  from  zero  coherence,  we  used  accuracy  and  RT  as  dependent variables. For stimuli with zero coherence, there is no true correct response; therefore, we used phase consistency and cue consistency as dependent variables.

## Results

## Demographics and neuropsychology

Between the two groups there were no significant differences in age (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, U =0.91, p =0.36),  handedness  ( χ 2 (1) =0.45, p =0.50),  or  gender  ( χ 2 (1) =3.11, p =0.08),  but  a significant difference in the autism quotient  ( U =6.03, p &lt;0.001) (Table 1). Furthermore, there were no significant between-group differences in general neuropsychological measures like perceptual logical thinking (BDT: U =0.78, p =0.43), working memory (arithmetic: t96=1.29, p =0.22) and attention (d2-R: t 96 =0.63, p =0.53), except for the measure for processing speed (DSST, t 96 =3.16, p =0.002) (Table 1).

## Testing alternatives hypotheses of perceptual alterations in ASD

In the following, we present the results for the hypotheses tested within this study. A detailed description of the hypotheses and the methods used to test them is given in the Supplementary Material: Hypotheses testing.

## Lack  of evidence for overprecise sensory information processing in individuals with ASD (H1)

We used  a  classical  2-AFC  motion  discrimination  task  without  cue  (NCMDT)  to  capture differences in sensory evidence integration and decision-making during motion discrimination between the AG and CG. We found no significant group differences in average performance and RT (H1a) (Table 2, Figure 3A-C, see also Supplementary Material: Hypotheses testing). Furthermore, the DDM analysis did not reveal any group differences in the boundary and nondecision  time  parameter  estimates.  Although  there  was  a  marginal  difference  in  the  drift parameter ( t 95 =2.04, p =0.04; not surviving multiple comparison correction), this effect was in the opposite direction to what would be expected if information processing in the AG were characterised by increased sensory precision: that is, the AG showed a smaller drift compared to the control group. (H1b) (Table 2). This suggests that the AG integrated sensory evidence similarly or even slightly slower than the CG in the NCMDT, and that both groups employed similar decision thresholds.

## Differences in the use of prior information (H2)

To assess differences in the use of prior information we used a second paradigm where an initial probabilistic cue indicated the potential motion direction on each trial (CMDT) (Figure 2C). To further assess the effect of learning and hierarchical modulation of prior information the validity of this cue was changed over the course of trials (valid: 85% correct; invalid: 15% correct) and the frequency of these changes was altered (stable vs. volatile phases) (Figure 2E).

## Individuals with autism spectrum disorder use prior information less to make difficult perceptual decisions (H2a)

According to Hypothesis 2, individuals with ASD treat prior information as unreliable (i.e. of low precision). They should thus benefit less from information provided by the cue, and this should become particularly apparent when sensory uncertainty is high.

To test this, we used a mixed effects model for accuracy and RT data, with the fixed factors task (NCMDT vs CMDT) and group (CG vs. AG) and a subject-specific random factor. We found that the task had a main effect on performance ( χ 2 (1) =6.9, p =0.009). This effect was driven by the CG only (task  group interaction: χ 2 (1) =8.3, p =0.004). In other words, while the CG showed a significant increase in performance on the CMDT task, compared to NCMDT ( b =-0.152 (95%CI [-0.228, -0.076]), z =-3.97, p =8.6e-5), the AG did not show any benefit of cue ( b =0.007 (95%CI [-0.070, 0.084]),  =0.18, z p =0.860).  We also found a main effect of task

Behavioural  data  (dots)  and model  predictions  (solid  line)  for  the  non-cued  (upper)  and  cued  (lower)  version  of  the  motion discrimination task for both groups (AG in blue, CG in magenta). Model predictions (solid lines) were generated by the DDM, using the empirically obtained parameter estimates and simulating responses across different coherence levels. From left to right: (A) and (D) Reaction time, (B) and (E) percent rightward responses and (C) and (F) proportion correct responses plotted across motion strength levels. In panels (C) and (F), motion strength for left and right was combined and, since there is no correct response for zero coherence stimuli, we assigned a random response (i.e. 50% chance of responding correctly/incorrectly) to these stimuli. Panel (G) shows a zoom-in of the highlighted section in (C) and (F) for the 3.2% coherence level across both tasks. Error bars reflect 95% confidence interval. CMDT: cued motion discrimination task; NCMDT: non-cued motion discrimination task; AG: autism spectrum disorder group, CG: control group.

Next, we tested if the beneficial effects of prior information in the CG (but not AG) was mainly driven by the fact that controls benefit more from the cue when stimuli were difficult and sensory uncertainty was high (i.e. low-coherence trials). This analysis used a GLMM with task, group  and  difficulty  level  (coherence)  as  fixed  factors.  As  expected,  there  was  a  highly significant  main  effect  of  coherence  on  accuracy (χ (1) 2 =6493, p &lt;2.2e-16)  and  a  task  coherence  interaction  ( χ 2 (2) =18.65, p =8.9e-5),  indicating  that  performance  increase  across tasks differed across coherence levels. Additionally, there was also a marginally significant 3way interaction effect of task  group  coherence ( χ 2 (2) =6.11, p =0.047) on accuracy. Tukey-

corrected post-hoc analysis revealed that the 3-way interaction effect was driven by the lowest (non-random) motion strength in the cued task between groups. In other words, as predicted by H2, the CG benefited from using the cue on the most difficult (3.2% coherence) trials ( b =-0.310,  95%CI=[-0.413,-0.207], z =-5.88, p =2.5e-8)  whereas  the  AG  did  not  (b=-0.050, 95%CI=[-0.156,0.057],  =-0.908, z p =0.800); see Figure 3G. This difference was not found for easier trials where sensory information alone might have been sufficient to provide a correct response (Figure 3F).

## Individuals with ASD are less sensitive to expectations mediated by the cue (H2b)

Another  way  to  test  hypothesis  2  is  to  assess  how  much  the  behaviour  of  both  groups  is modulated by cue validity. Given the informative nature of the probabilistic cues (85% and 15% cue validity, respectively), task performance and RT can be improved by exploiting the information  of  the  cue  about  the  most  probable  motion  direction.  However,  due  to  the probabilistic nature of the cue, this use of prior information makes errors more likely when cue validity is not as expected during the current phase of the task (i.e., a valid cue during an invalid phase and an invalid cue during a valid phase). Indeed overall performance was higher and RT were lower for expected compared to unexpected trial outcomes (GLMM with fixed effects: group and expectancy, random effects: subject; main effect of expectancy on RT: F1,95 =61.91, 𝜂𝐺 2 =0.010, p =5.7e-12  and  GLMM:  main  effect  of  expectancy  on  accuracy: χ 2 (1) =411.81, p =1.5e-91). Across groups, expectancy had a differential influence on accuracy (expectancy  group  interaction: χ 2 (1) =9.08, p =0.003)  but  not  on  RT  (expectancy  group  interaction: F1,95 =0.51, 𝜂𝐺 2 &lt;0.001, p =0.475).  This  effect  was  driven  by  a  selective  group  difference  in accuracy  for  expected  stimuli  (post-hoc  test  of  group  effect  for  expected  stimuli: b =0.239 (95%CI  [0.04,  0.44], z =2.38, p =0.017;  for  unexpected  stimuli: b =-0.038  (95%CI  [-0.275, 0.199], z =-0.315, p =0.752).    In  other  words,  individuals  with  ASD  performed  as  well  as controls on unexpected trials when cue information was potentially misleading. However, they did not benefit as much from the cue during expected trials where the cue provided helpful information about the stimulus direction (Figure 4A).

This suggests that individuals with ASD take information by the cue less into account than controls.

Figure  4  Group  differences  between  expectedness  and  stability. Panel (A) shows  the  effect  of expectedness  on  RT  (left)  and  accuracy  (right)  (H2a).  There  is  a  significant  interaction  between expectedness and group on accuracy but not RT (see main text). Panel (B) shows phase consistent behaviour. 'Phase consistent' means that the response is consistent to the phase of the cue (congruent in  valid  phases  and  incongruent  in  invalid  phases)  in  trials  without  stimulus  information,  i.e.  zero coherence trials (left) and questions (middle and right bar plot) (H2b, H2c). A more detailed description of  phase  consistency  is  given  in  the  Methods  section.  Panel (C) depicts  the  significant  three  way interaction  effect  of  expectedness  x  stability  x  group  ( 𝜒 2 (1) =6.75, p =0.009)  (H4a).  Post-hoc  tests revealed that volatility modulated the effect of expectedness more in the CG compared to the AG. Finally, panel (D) shows how the group effects of trials without stimulus information in panel B are modulated by stability (H4b, H4c). While there is no significant interaction effect of group and stability on  choice  phase  consistency  (direction  response  in  zero  coherence  trials)  and  on  reported  phase consistency (direction response in question trials), we found a significant group x stability interaction effect of reported cue confidence, where stability modulated cue confidence more in the CG compared to the AG.

## Individuals  with  ASD  benefit  less  from  cue  information  in  the  absence  of  sensory information about motion direction (H2c-e)

Until now, we have examined the effects of the use of prior information on performance in the presence of stimuli with non-zero motion coherence, where information provided by the cue competes with actual sensory information. Another more direct readout of the use of prior information are trials where sensory stimuli are not informative about motion direction, i.e. zero-coherence trials (H2c). We found that the AG were significantly less likely to base their decisions on the phase of cue validity (phase consistency on zero coherence trials: t 96 =2.52, p =0.013, d =0.512).  This  effect  is  mirrored  by  their  subjective  report  during  question  trials (H2d; reported phase consistency: t-test: t 96 =2.77, p =0.007, d =0.562) and their reported cue confidence (H2e; reported cue confidence: Mann-Whitney U test: U =3.15, p =0.002,  =0.320) r (see Figure 4B). This suggests that participants with ASD relied less on the prior information provided.

Importantly, this effect was not driven by difficulties of individuals with ASD in inferring the meaning of the cue during invalid phases, but rather by a general reduction in cue use (see additional post-hoc analysis in Supplementary Material: Reduced cue benefit not due to invalid phases only).

## Reduced reliance on cue is not a consequence of inflexible priors (H3)

Earlier  work  proposed  that  inflexibility  in  the  use  of  prior  information  rather  than  general uncertainty might drive deficits in individuals with ASD. 11,19 To test this, in the CMDT, the first experimental phase (49 trials) used a stably reliable cue (85%) to allow for the acquisition of an informed prior. We tested whether after exposure to this early phase the AG showed a tendency to choosing the cue-congruent motion direction more frequently over the rest of the experiment compared to the CG, independently of the validity of the phase. While there was a marginally significant effect, this was in the opposite direction as postulated by the hypothesis (H3a; t 96 =2.11, p =0.038, d =0.428), i.e. the CG tended to choose the cue congruent direction more often than the AG. Furthermore, and also not consistent with the hypothesis, there was no  group  difference  in  the  cue  consistency  reported  on  question  trials  (H3b): t 96 =0.856, p =0.394, d =0.174). These findings suggest that the overall tendency to rely less on the cue in individuals with ASD was not driven by the inflexibility to change a prior established early in the task (as was predicted by hypothesis 3).

## Volatility-induced hierarchical learning is diminished in the AG (H4)

Finally, the last hypothesis suggested that overreliance on sensory information in individuals with  ASD  may  be  driven  by  alterations  in  hierarchical  learning.  To  test  this,  our  CMDT paradigm  introduced  volatile  changes  in  cue  validity.  According  to  Bayesian  models  of learning,  higher  uncertainty  about  cue  reliability  should  occur  during  volatile  phases, accompanied by faster learning rates.

We first assessed the predicted effect of higher uncertainty about cue validity by comparing the expectancy effect on accuracy between stable and volatile phases (H4a). A GLMM (fixed effects: stability, expectedness, group; random effects: subject) showed that stability affected the expectancy effect (expectedness  stability interaction: 𝜒 2 (1)=47.94, p =4.4e-12) and this effect  was  different  across  groups  (3-way  interaction:  expectedness  stability  group: 𝜒 2 (1)=6.75, p =0.009).

Interestingly,  Tukey-corrected  post-hoc  tests  showed  that  the  3-way  interaction  effect  was driven by an opposing effect of stability on unexpected ( =4.70 z p =1.5e-5) and expected trial outcomes  in  the  controls  ( z =-5.41, p =3.7e-7)  (Figure  4C):  while  overall  performance  for expected  stimuli  decreased  during  volatile  phases,  performance  for  unexpected  stimuli increased. This suggests that during volatile phases the CG became less influenced by the cue. By contrast, in the AG, this effect of volatility was not observed for unexpected trial outcomes ( z =1.96, p =0.204) and was less clear for expected trial outcomes than in CG ( z =-2.80, p =0.026). This suggests that choices were less influenced by stability in the AG compared to the CG.

However, on trials without information about stimulus direction, i.e. trials with zero motion coherence  (H4b)  and  question  trials  (H4c),  a  corresponding  effect  of  stability  on  phase consistency  was  not  found  (Figure  4D;  for  further  details,  see  Supplementary  Material: Hierarchical learning hypothesis).

Finally, we examined reported cue confidence on question trials (H4d). We found a strong main  effect  of  stability  (GLMM: F1,95 =33.93, 𝜂𝐺 2 =0.04, p =7.8e-8,)  and  group  ( F1,95 =11.30, 𝜂𝐺 2 =0.09, p =0.0011)  and  an  interaction  effect  of  group  stability  ( F1,95 =5.94, 𝜂𝐺 2 =0.007, p =0.017) (Figure 4D).

Overall,  hypothesis  4  could  thus  only  be  confirmed  partially.  While  stability  modulated accuracy  and cue  confidence differently in both groups, this effect  was not apparent  when examining phase consistency on trials without relevant sensory information.

## Discussion

In  this  study,  we  investigated  competing  predictions  that  arise  from  the  general  'Bayesian brain'  theory  of  autism.  While  this  theory  suggests  that  autistic  symptoms  result  from  an overweighting  of  sensory  information  relative  to  prior  information 8-10 ,  there  are  different reasons why this imbalance could arise. Specifically, four different causes have been proposed by  previous  literature:  overprecise  sensations  (H1),  imprecise  priors  (H2),  inflexible  priors (H3), and altered hierarchical learning (H4).

These  hypotheses  have  been  tested  in  previous  studies, 19,22-25,27-29,31,32,43,44 however,  with conflicting results. At least the three aforementioned reasons may explain this inconsistency: (i) many studies did not compare the relative plausibility of the different hypotheses but tested a single one, (ii) some studies did not examine individuals with a clinical diagnosis of ASD, but  autistic  traits  in  the  general  population, 26,29,31 and  when  diagnosed  individuals  were investigated,  (iii)  sample  sizes  were  mostly  small,  ranging  from N =14  to N =26  in  most studies, 19,22,24,25,28,31-33,36,37,44 with few exceptions. 23,27,34

In  the  current  study,  we  tried  to  address  these  issues  and  designed  a  set  of  experiments  to systematically test the different hypotheses in a larger clinical sample (47 adults diagnosed with ASD and 50 matched controls). We found evidence for imprecise priors and, to a lesser degree, altered hierarchical learning, but not for overprecise sensations or inflexible priors. An overview of all hypotheses we tested and the results is provided by Table 3.

In the following, we briefly discuss these results hypothesis by hypothesis and compare them to previous literature.

## Hypothesis 1: Sensory information processing is more precise in individuals with ASD

Sensory  processing  in  individuals  with  ASD  has  been  investigated  by  numerous  studies. 45 Although the literature is not consistent, several studies in different sensory domains suggest that individuals with ASD may experience hypersensitivity to sensations, 46-49 may process lowlevel stimulus features with higher sensory precision, 15-17,46,50,51 and may have difficulties in processing more complex sensory stimuli 50,52 and integrating multiple sensory domains. 53,54

Sensory processing can be investigated in many different ways. We chose a well-established experimental  paradigm  (moving  dots  task  with  different  motion  coherence  levels 55 )  that allowed us to quantify sensory processing using a drift diffusion model (DDM). Our analyses did not reveal any superiority of individuals with ASD in evidence accumulation - neither in overall accuracy and RT, nor in any of the DDM parameter estimates (H1a, H1b) - as would be  expected  when  sensory  precision  is  enhanced.  On  the  contrary,  there  was  a  marginally significant effect (not surviving correction) in the opposite direction, i.e. the controls showed a faster accumulation of sensory information (higher drift). These results differ from those of a previous study using a smaller sample and a different paradigm (discrimination of orientation in static Gabor patches) 56 . Notably, this study focused on evidence accumulation as the only explanation of perceptual differences, without considering the possibility of altered priors. This is important because, from a Bayesian view, an increase in the weight of sensory information could equally result from enhanced sensory precision or less precise priors.

So far, only one study reporting enhanced sensory processing allowed for investigating changes in either sensory processing or priors. 26 That study, however, used a different type of motion detection task and, more importantly, investigated autistic traits in the general population (as opposed to individuals with a clinical diagnosis of ASD).

## Hypothesis 2: Individuals with ASD weigh prior information less

The imprecise prior hypothesis assumes that perception in individuals with ASD is dominated by sensory information because their priors are less precise. This notion was first articulated, in an explicitly Bayesian context, by Pellicano and Burr. 10 Their proposal was partially based on earlier  studies  suggesting  that  altered  use  of  prior  information  may  affect  perception  in ASD. 18,57,58 Specifically,  Pellicano  and  Burr 10 proposed  the  existence  of  "hypo-priors" in

individuals with ASD, i.e. priors with reduced precision, leading to smaller influence of prior expectations on perception and a greater weight of sensory information. They predicted that hypo-priors  would  become  particularly  visible  in  situations  where  priors  help  to  resolve uncertainty. Our paradigm allowed for testing this hypothesis directly, confirming five distinct predictions (H2a-H2e):

First, comparing the versions of our task with and without cues, the AG benefitted less from the availability of cues than the CG (H2a), especially on trials with low coherence. Second, on trials where the outcome was predicted by the cue, the AG profited significantly less from the cue  than  the  CG  (H2b).  Third,  our  experiment  included  trials  where  sensory  input  was completely uninformative (zero coherence trials) and the only information that could guide decisions was provided by the cue. On these trials, individuals with ASD relied significantly less on cue information than the controls (H2c). Fourth, on "question trials" in our experiment participants were asked, after the cue was presented, to indicate which stimulus direction they expected. In the AG, responses were less consistent with the cue prediction than in the CG (H2d).  Fifth,  on  question  trials,  individuals  with  ASD  reported  lower  confidence  in  their prediction  than  controls  (H2e).  Sixth,  an  additional  model-based  analysis  (DDM  with  the starting value as free parameter to account for valid vs. invalid phases) provided results that were  consistent  with  the  model-agnostic  analyses  described  above  (see  Supplementary Material).

Our results thus support the prediction by Pellicano and Burr 10 that the precision of priors is reduced in ASD. This prediction has previously been tested by numerous studies using a variety of different visual or auditory tasks or temporal integration paradigms, both in individuals with a clinical diagnosis and in the general population. While the majority of studies yielded results consistent with less precise priors, 24,25,27,29,31-33,35 two studies did not find evidence for weaker priors. 26,28 We comment on possible reasons for this discrepancy below.

## Hypothesis 3: Individuals with ASD have inflexible priors

Inflexible  priors  might  represent  an  alternative  reason  why  prior  information  may  not  be exploited  fully  in  individuals  with  ASD:  they  might  be  capable  of  acquiring  priors  upon exposure to a new environment or context, but are then possibly inflexible in adjusting their priors once this environment changes. This possibility was suggested by previous concepts and studies. 11,19,31,36 Because inflexibility has been defined inconsistently in the context of Bayesian

perception, the findings might also be explained by other causes, 36,37 as  discussed by some authors. 19

We investigated the possible presence of inflexible priors by testing whether the priors acquired at  the  beginning  of  the  experiment  (during  the  initial  valid  cue  phase)  shaped  responses throughout the remainder of the experiment. However, we did not find any evidence supporting this  notion:  individuals  with  ASD  did  not  choose  options  consistent  with  the  cue  more frequently than controls, neither on standard trials nor on question trials (where the expected direction had to be indicated, in the absence of a stimulus).

## Hypothesis 4: Volatility-induced hierarchical learning is diminished in the AG

Another reason why individuals with ASD may differ in their use of prior information may relate to how they adapt to changes in uncertainty, specifically through learning hierarchical relations between environmental causes. For example, the updating of low-level priors (e.g. about concrete events in the world) depends on higher-order estimates of abstract quantities, such as environmental volatility. 59,60 For ASD, it has been suggested that changes in learning occur at higher (i.e. more abstract) levels of perceptual hierarchies in particular, e.g. due to altered precision of beliefs about volatility. 14

The results from our study were largely in line with this hypothesis. In particular, we found a group  difference  in  how  volatility  affected  cue  use  (i.e.  a  group  volatility  expectedness interaction): in the CG, the cue exerted less influence on responses during volatile phases, with decreased performance for expected stimuli and increased performance for unexpected stimuli. By contrast, this effect was significantly weaker in the AG - a finding that would be consistent with altered hierarchical learning in ASD and ensuing weaker weighting of prior expectations compared to sensory information, e.g. due to higher estimates of volatility. 8

However, one would expect that this putative difference is also visible on trials without sensory stimulus information (question trials and zero coherence trials). Here, our results were mixed: while we did not find an effect of volatility on phase consistency, we did observe an effect of volatility  on  reported  cue  confidence.  In  summary,  although  not  all  predictions  could  be confirmed,  no  evidence  to  the  contrary  was  found.  Overall,  our  findings  thus  support  the hypothesis of altered hierarchical learning in ASD.

In the previous literature, three studies have examined learning under volatile conditions in individuals with ASD, with contradictory results. Two studies on adults with ASD also found evidence for altered hierarchical learning. 22,34 One computational modelling study demonstrated elevated learning of volatility and increased estimates of changes in volatility (meta-volatility) during an audio-visual learning task, suggesting that individuals with ASD learn to 'expect the unexpected'. 22 By contrast, a second study, 34 reported that perception in individuals with ASD during an auditory serial discrimination was more strongly dominated by information from the past, implying reduced learning of volatility. Finally, a third study failed to find a difference in learning rate between volatile and stable phases during a visual associative learning task. 23 This study differed from our and the other previous studies in that it  investigated children (not adults) with ASD and did not use stimuli imbued with sensory uncertainty.

## Strengths and weaknesses of our study

Our study has strengths and weaknesses. One particular strength of our study is that it was designed  to  provide  readouts  allowing  for  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  tests  of  four competing hypotheses. In order to test the processing of sensory information, we focused on an established computational model (DDM) that was applied to data from an equally wellestablished perceptual paradigm (dot motion task). Conversely, to probe the role of priors, we included  specifically  designed  trials  for  testing  the  influence  of  prior  expectations  in  the absence of informative sensory information (zero coherence trials) and in the absence of any sensory information (question trials). These trials allowed us to probe putative effects of altered priors without the need of adopting a specific model of perceptual inference. This qualitative approach has the advantage of obtaining a directly informative readout and obviates the need of inverting a (potentially complex) model. A weakness of this approach to testing the influence of priors is that understanding the exact mechanism behind data in relation to hypotheses H2 (imprecise priors) and H4 (altered hierarchical learning) requires trial-by-trial modelling.

Additionally,  we  took  care  to  ensure  that  our  experimental  assessments  avoided  potential confounds  such  as  previously  reported  deficits  in  motor  skills  in  ASD. 61-64 Instead,  we developed patient-friendly tasks that only required eye movements to express decisions.

Finally, it is worth emphasising that, compared to previous investigations, we recruited a large sample of adults with ASD, together with a control group carefully matched with regard to age,

gender, and handedness. Diagnosing adults with ASD is challenging and requires particular expertise,  and  some  of  the  variability  in  the  literature  may  result  from  different  diagnostic standards.  In  our  study,  diagnoses  of  ASD  were  carefully  established  and  confirmed  by  a specialised psychiatrist.

## Summary and outlook

This study has compared different hypothetical mechanisms of altered perception in ASD all of which derive from the general "Bayesian brain" theory. Our findings suggest that perception in  adults  with  ASD  relies  less  on  prior  information  and  may  adjust  less  to  changes  in  the environment. These findings may help explain salient clinical features of ASD, such as higher intolerance  of  uncertainty 65-70 and  frequent  feelings  of  being  overwhelmed. 10 Our  study illustrates how competing explanations derived from the same theoretical (i.e. Bayesian brain) framework can be compared, using a combination of computational modelling and qualitative tests. If the present results can be confirmed in future studies of this sort, they might help to inform  new  treatment  approaches,  e.g.  cognitive  interventions  specifically  focused  on developing more precise prior expectations. 8
