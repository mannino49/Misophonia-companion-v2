and meaning to a given individual. In this paper, we review the clinical features of this relatively 
common yet underinvestigated condition, with focus on co-occurring neurodevelopmental 
disorders. Currently available data on the putative pathophysiology of the condition can inform 
our understanding and guide the diagnostic process and treatment approach. Tinnitus retrain -
ing therapy and cognitive behavior therapy have been proposed as the most effective treatment 
strategies for reducing symptoms; however, current treatment algorithms should be validated 
in large population studies. At the present stage, competing paradigms see misophonia as a 
physiological state potentially inducible in any subject, an idiopathic condition (which can 
present with comorbid psychiatric disorders), or a symptomatic manifestation of an underly -
ing psychiatric disorder. Agreement on the use of standardized diagnostic criteria would be 
an important step forward in terms of both clinical practice and scientific inquiry. Areas for 
future research include phenomenology, epidemiology, modulating factors, neurophysiological 
underpinnings, and treatment trials.

What is misophonia?
Shortly after the turn of the new millennium, Jastreboff et al first reported original 
clinical observations of subjects complaining of decreased sound tolerance with or 
without tinnitus.1–3 Interestingly, classic descriptions of hyperacusis (as characterized 
in patients who respond consistently to sounds above a certain intensity and whose 
reactions can be correlated with the physical parameters of the sound) did not fit 
majority of the reported cases. The authors therefore proposed misophonia as a new 
medical entity and defined misophonia as present when an abnormally strong reaction 
occurs to a sound with a specific pattern and/or meaning to an individual, with the 
context in which sound is presented frequently playing a role as well. Misophonic 
reactions often include autonomic arousal and unpleasant emotional experiences, 
such as anxiety, in response to specific sounds. Since the first scientific descriptions 
by Jastreboff et al, selective sound sensitivity syndrome has sometimes been used as 
a synonym of misophonia, alongside a range of layman’s terms such as sound-rage, 
whereas decreased sound tolerance encompasses both misophonia and hyperacusis.4–6 
Individuals with misophonia are sensitive to a specific set of trigger sounds, which are 
usually recognized since childhood; these sounds tend to be trivial noises produced 
by other people, including gum popping, food chewing or crunching, nose sniffing, 
breathing, pen clicking, clock ticking, whistling, lip smacking, and finger or foot tap -
ping. However, it is important to note that trigger sounds do not necessarily need to be 
produced by other people: the noise produced by a train or an airplane, distant sounds 
of engines, as well as sounds made by animals can all potentially result in misophonic Correspondence: Andrea e Cavanna

reactions in selected individuals. Interestingly, in addition 
to auditory cues, the observation of specific movements 
(eg, fingers pointing, legs swinging, and hair twirling) can 
also trigger intense aversive responses associated with feel -
ings of distress, disgust, irritability, and anger.7–10 In contrast 
to phonophobia, a specific case of misophonia in which fear 
is the dominant emotion experienced in response to sound, 
misophonia is characterized by feelings of anxiety, distress, 
and occasionally anger. A range of physical manifestations 
have been described, which can accompany these psychologi -
cal reactions, including tightness or pain in the chest, arms, 
head, or entire body, increased muscular tone, diaphoresis, 
dyspnea, tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia.6 In 
general, there is a perception that the media have occasionally 
popularized misophonia by propagating an idea of extreme 
reaction of young people to sound related to eating; although 
such cases exist, misophonia can indeed emerge in elderly 
people and to a vast variety of sound as well. Moreover, 
contrary to the media reports, misophonic reactions in the 
majority of cases are mild-to-moderate, and external reac -
tions can typically be kept under control. Finally, although 
persons with misophonia have a relatively preserved insight 
into the disproportionate nature of their feelings and reac -
tions to sounds/movements that the vast majority of people 
would consider irrelevant, misophonic symptoms can lead 
to significant impairment across school, work, family, and 
social domains. In fact, stimulus-avoidance and other dys -
functional behaviors triggered by the auditory cues often 
affect the person’s ability to achieve daily life goals and 
enjoy interpersonal interactions.7–9
The clinical spectrum of misophonia
The majority of studies on misophonia to date have been case 
reports/series, and although more systematic studies have 
recently been conducted, potentially more informative addi -
tional population studies are still needed.7–9,11 A large sample 
of 42 persons with misophonia was clinically characterized 
by Schröder et al in 2013.8 These authors developed the 
Amsterdam Misophonia Scale, a six-item self-report rating 
scale to assess the type and severity of misophonia symp -
toms. Although this instrument was developed based on the 
Y ale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale used for obsessive-
compulsive disorder, it also maps onto a set of six criteria 
proposed for the diagnosis of misophonia: 1) the presence or 
anticipation of a specific sound, produced by a human being 
(eg, eating sounds, breathing sounds), provokes an impulsive 
aversive physical reaction, which starts with irritation or 
disgust that instantaneously becomes anger; 2) this anger initiates a profound sense of loss of self-control with rare 
but potentially aggressive outbursts; 3) the person recognizes 
that the anger or disgust is excessive, unreasonable, or out 
of proportion to the circumstances or the provoking stres -
sor; 4) the person tends to avoid the misophonic situation, 
or if he/she does not avoid it, endures encounters with the 
misophonic sound situation with intense discomfort, anger, 
or disgust; 5)  the person’s anger, disgust, or avoidance causes 
significant distress (ie, it bothers the person for whom he or 
she has the anger or disgust) or significant interference in the 
person’s day-to-day life (eg, the anger or disgust may make 
it difficult for the person to perform important tasks at work, 
meet new friends, attend classes, or interact with others); and 
6) the person’s anger, disgust, and avoidance are not better 
explained by another disorder, such as obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (eg, disgust in someone with an obsession about con -
tamination) or posttraumatic stress disorder (eg, avoidance of 
stimuli associated with a trauma related to threatened death, 
serious injury, or threat to the physical integrity of self or 
others).8 According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders  (DSM) criteria, rates of psychiatric 
conditions in this misophonia sample were as follows: mood 
disorder 7.1%, Tourette syndrome 4.8%, attention-deficit 
and hyperactivity disorder 4.8%, trichotillomania 4.8%, skin 
picking 2.4%, panic disorder 2.4%, and hypochondria 2.4%. 
Although DSM axis-1 obsessive-compulsive disorder was 
diagnosed in 2.4% of subjects, more than half of the sample 
met diagnostic criteria for axis-2 obsessive-compulsive 
personality disorder (52.4%). Based on their observations, 
Schröder et al suggested that misophonia is a primary 
nosological entity, which can be appropriately categorized 
within obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, a group of 
conditions sharing elements of obsessionality, compulsivity, 
and impulsivity.8,12,13 This definition of misophonia contrasts 
with the one originally proposed by Jastreboff et al accord -
ing to which the six criteria developed by Schröder would 
capture only a subset of individuals with misophonia (those 
with obsessive-compulsive and impulsive features) rather 
than all cases.1–3 In fact, the work by Jastreboff et al provides 
evidence of exceptions to each one of the six criteria: the 
misophonic trigger can sometimes be produced by animals 
or machines instead of human beings, and reactive anger is 
not observed in all subjects; beyond anger, negative reactions 
such as irritation and annoyance can create tension, but many 
subjects are able to control the external manifestation of 
misophonic reaction and keep self-control (with extra effort), 
as aggressive outbursts are observed only in a subgroup of 
patients (usually of young age); although the anger or disgust

is recognized as excessive, unreasonable, or out of propor -
tion to the circumstances/provoking stressor in the majority 
of cases, some subjects believe that other people behave 
in an unreasonable/disrespectful manner toward them, and 
therefore, their feelings/reactions are normal and justified; 
misophonic reactions can frequently be limited to annoyance 
or mild discomfort, rather than intense discomfort, disgust, 
or occasionally anger, and sometimes individuals with 
misophonia decide not to participate in a given activity due 
to concerns that their behavior would be distressful to their 
loved ones; negative reactions can interfere with daily life, 
although they do not necessarily involve anger or disgust; the 
presence of psychiatric or psychological disorders (diagnosed 
in ~5% of cases in a recent large study on 184 consecutive 
subjects with misophonia) does not seem to play a role in 
determining misophonic reactions.11
Other observations, however, raise the possibility that 
at least in some cases, misophonia could be attributed to 
(or associated with) neuropsychiatric disorders, despite 
preliminary evidence supporting the suggestion that sensory 
over-responsivity can occur as a sole diagnosis.14,15 Intrigu -
ingly, misophonic symptoms and sensory over-responsivity 
have been recently documented in the context of pediatric 
obsessive-compulsive disorder,16–18 as well as a number 
of neurodevelopmental conditions, including attention-
deficit hyperactivity disorder, autistic spectrum disorder, and 
Fragile X syndrome.19–21
Furthermore, atypical sensory responses have been 
described in young patients with tic disorders, a group of con -
ditions characterized by repetitive sudden, rapid, nonrhythmic 
movements (motor tics) or vocalizations (vocal of phonic 
tics).22,23 Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder 
characterized by chronic multiple motor and vocal/phonic tics 
and, in the majority of patients, specific obsessive-compulsive 
symptoms.24,25 A recently published report from the Interna -
tional College of Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum Disorders 
revealed that the most common comorbidity of obsessive-
compulsive disorder in terms of obsessive-compulsive-related 
disorders was tic disorder (12.5%), suggesting a bidirectional 
link between these patient populations where symptoms of 
misophonia have been reported.26 Importantly, although overt 
tics are the defining feature of Tourette syndrome, patients 
commonly report specific urges to tic, which are characterized 
by a strong sensory component.27,28 Premonitory urges are 
difficult to describe for many patients and result in unpleas -
ant sensations, which increase in severity and are transiently 
relieved by tic expression.29–32 An article published in 1994 by 
Michael Kane, a graduate student with Tourette syndrome, offered useful insights into these experiences, which can 
be perceived as more bothersome than the tics themselves 
and bear resemblance with misophonia-related discomfort 
(eg, urge to flee, comment on the noise, or otherwise avoid the 
noise).33 Based on his introspective case study, Kane proposed 
that the premonitory urges that precede tics are manifestations 
of sensory hyperawareness. In his words,
Perhaps the best description for the sensory state of Tourette 
syndrome is a somatic hyperattention: it is not as itch-like 
as it is an enduring somatosensory bombardment.33
Although a recent publication showed that subjects with miso -
phonia can have enhanced autonomic reactivity to a sound, 
but not to other sensory stimuli,7 the subjective experiences 
described by these subjects following exposure to trigger 
sounds share qualitative features with the sensory symptoms 
reported by patients with tic disorders. Moreover, patients with 
Tourette syndrome often report the phenomenon of site sensiti -
zation, in which they become acutely aware of, distracted, and 
distressed by faint sensory stimuli, which include the auditory 
modality.34 A study on 28 patients with Tourette syndrome 
revealed that 70% reported heightened sensitivity to auditory, 
tactile, and/or visual stimuli, including noise from the televi -
sion, electrical appliances, and loud settings such as parties.35 
A more recent study using standardized questionnaires and 
in-depth interviews with 19 adult patients with Tourette syn -
drome and 19 aged-matched healthy controls showed that 80% 
of the patients described a heightened sensitivity to external 
stimuli in at least one sensory modality, namely smell (70%), 
tactile perception (65%), light (60%), sound (55%), and taste 
(50%). Interestingly, these patients reported that stimuli that 
were faint, repetitive, or constant and nonsalient were the most 
bothersome, whereas intense stimuli were perceived as less 
troublesome.36 Recent reports have also suggested that miso -
phonic symptoms can be found in the context of two of the 
most common psychiatric comorbidities of Tourette syndrome, 
in addition to obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized 
anxiety disorder,37,38 and schizotypal personality disorder.39,40 
Overall, although there is preliminary evidence supporting the 
suggestion that misophonia can occur as a sole diagnosis, these 
observations raise the possibility that in some cases, it could 
also be attributed to underlying neuropsychiatric disorders.
An elusive pathophysiology
Research into the neurobiological underpinnings of miso -
phonia is still in its infancy, and there are still a number of 
unanswered questions regarding the clinical characterization 
of this condition (Table 1). For example, the variability of

the time course (onset, natural history) seems to depend on 
both life circumstances and degrees of exposure to trigger 
sounds.4,8 However, it is unclear which factors contribute to 
individual differences in severity of responses to misophonic 
triggers and in the nature of the triggers themselves. Both 
intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including family accommo -
dation and exposure to visual stimuli typically associated 
with sound (eg, seeing somebody eating),11,15 seem to play 
a role in determining interindividual variability in the clini -
cal presentation, which could be reflected in heterogeneous 
pathophysiological processes underlying misophonia. There 
is also uncertainty with regard to a possible genetic com -
ponent to misophonia, as early observations identified the 
condition in multiple family members.4
Existing literature highlights broad similarities with tin -
nitus, a symptom that is often considered in the differential 
diagnosis of misophonia.1–3,6 According to Jastreboff and 
Hazell, both conditions could share a pattern of increased 
connectivity between auditory and limbic structures, result -
ing in heightened reactions to sounds.41 A comprehensive 
description of this interesting pathophysiological model, 
including proposed mechanisms by which conditioned 
reflexes can result in enhanced functional connections 
between the auditory system and other systems in the brain, 
particularly the limbic and autonomic nervous systems, 
has been included in recent publications by Jastreboff and 
Jastreboff.42,43 However, in misophonia, clinical manifesta -
tions are triggered by external, mostly human-produced 
sounds and situations, whereas persons who experience tin -
nitus report distress related to internally perceived, abstract 
sounds. Moreover, it is known that the majority of people can 
experience general and unelaborated emotional reactions to a range of annoying sounds: among the most familiar examples 
are the sounds of train wheels on rail tracks, fingernails on 
glass, or chalk on blackboard.44–46 It is possible that symptoms 
of misophonia reflect a more extreme subjective discomfort 
and physiological response to these and other emotionally 
evocative stimuli. This hypothesis would be consistent with 
the mentioned overlap with neurodevelopmental disorders, 
including Tourette syndrome, where sensory hyperawareness 
accompanied by subjective distress has been reported. The 
pathophysiology of the anomalous physiological/autonomic 
effects in the context of misophonia has recently been investi -
gated: a study by Edelstein et al showed increased autonomic 
responses to auditory (but not visual) stimuli in six subjects 
with misophonia, compared to typically developed controls.7 
Albeit in a small cohort, findings from this study using skin 
conductance responses provided an objective corrobora -
tion to subjective reports that specific sounds evoke intense 
emotional and physical reactions.
Evidence from the pharmacological modulation of the 
severity of misophonic symptoms might offer some insight 
on its pathophysiological mechanisms. Alcohol can alleviate 
the intensity of misophonia, whereas caffeine, a substance 
known to reduce auditory sensory gating in a paired-click 
auditory paradigm,47 has been reported to have opposite 
effects on symptom severity.7 Importantly, these notions are 
derived from early observations that are to be interpreted 
with caution until future studies on larger populations have 
been conducted.
Treatment approaches
Since the first documentation of misophonia cases in the 
scientific literature, there have been few treatment studies or 
empirical reports that could provide an evidence base for the 
treatment of its distressing symptoms. Until recently,11 there 
have been no large empirical treatment studies to evaluate the 
efficacy of therapeutic approaches to misophonia. Moreover, 
the lack of a coherent theoretical and etiological framework 
has hindered the identification of effective management strat -
egies. Analysis of the coping strategies adopted by persons 
with misophonia have revealed that avoidance (removing 
self from distressing situations) and other socially dysfunc -
tional behaviors (challenging the person who generates the 
trigger noise) can be replaced by more positive approaches. 
These include mimicry to cancel out the trigger sound, use 
of earplugs, headsets, or music, focusing consciousness to 
own sounds, self-distraction, and positive internal dialogs.7 
Jastreboff and Jastreboff recently reported a success rate of 
83% in a large treatment study of 184 patients recruited at a Table 1  Suggestions for future research into misophonia

specialist center.11 The treatment approach followed general 
tinnitus retraining therapy principles, with additional use of 
four specific protocols for misophonia, sometimes including 
multisensory stimulation, and was based on active extinc -
tion of conditioned reflexes with incorporating principle of 
complex conditioned stimuli.11,48
Coming from a different perspective and building on 
the phenomenological similarity between misophonia and 
obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, Webber and 
Storch recently proposed a theoretical model based on 
the central role of anxiety and distress in order to explore 
potentially helpful treatment interventions.10 According to 
this model, the auditory or visual clues act as triggers for 
a negative emotional reaction (involving distress, anger, 
or anxiety) that is negatively reinforced by the behavioral 
response. The few published treatment studies for misopho -
nia have limitations in scope, methodology, and sample size. 
The therapeutic approaches used in these studies ranged from 
psychoeducation and habituation to exposure and response 
prevention.49 The latter could be more effective in patients 
who experience significant anxiety and distress in response to 
the misophonic triggers, whereas patients who report severe 
anger or rage may be more likely to benefit from cognitive 
restructuring or stress inoculation.50 Other possibilities to 
explore in the treatment of misophonia are mindfulness- and 
acceptance-based approaches, such as dialectical behavior 
therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy.51 Overall, 
it seems likely that treatment plans need to be tailored to the 
needs of individual patients. It is also possible that persons 
who report misophonia in the context of neurodevelopmental 
and/or anxiety disorders could respond to pharmacological 
agents modulating serotonergic and/or antidopaminergic 
pathways, although these speculative suggestions need to 
be tested in clinical trials.4
Physiological state, symptom, or 
disorder?
The reviewed literature suggests a number of open questions 
about the exact nature of misophonia. According to the defi -
nition originally proposed by Jastreboff, misophonia is not 
to be considered a pathology or a psychological/psychiatric 
problem.1–3 Therefore, misophonic reactions could be induced 
in any person by creating an association between specific pat -
terns and any type of sounds with negative reinforcement: it is 
enough that certain sounds regularly accompany situations of 
emotional stress, when the subject experiences pain or other 
negative emotions (for instance, as a result of hyperacusis or 
tensor tympanic syndrome, annoyance, anxiety) or beliefs (such as the belief that a specific sound will enhance tinni -
tus, produce hearing loss, or is produced by a person who is 
perceived in a negative manner). Real-life examples include 
the sound of the steps of the stepmother who is following the 
subject and makes his/her life miserable; the sound of kissing 
made by a sibling and accompanied by negative comments to 
irritate the subject; the sound of a train passing by after the 
subject has been in a car accident where the car was hit by a 
train; the clicking sound made by the claws of a cat walking 
over hard surfaces near the subject, who dislikes cats jumping 
on the table, etc.42 This definition challenges the subsequently 
proposed views that misophonia is a discrete/idiopathic 
condition (which can present with comorbid psychiatric 
disorders)8 or a symptomatic manifestation of an underly -
ing psychiatric disorder, at least in a proportion of cases.4 If 
confirmed by future systematic studies in large populations, 
the presence of high rates of comorbidity would go against 
the argument that misophonia should be labeled as a primary 
diagnosis. In fact, it would suggest that it is a symptom 
manifestation of other underlying or comorbid diagnoses and 
should more appropriately be labeled as a symptom, rather 
than as a stand-alone diagnosis. Either way, the addition of 
misophonia to nosographic classification systems of psy -
chiatric disorders, such as the DSM, would require careful 
consideration. This issue was raised in a poignant way by 
Ronald Pies in a  relevant commentary on the appropriateness 
of designating Internet addiction as a mental disorder in the 
fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-V). Pies eloquently argued 
that in recent years psychiatric nosography proliferated in an 
unprecedented and apparently unstoppable way, leading the 
general public to believe that the definitions of psychiatric 
disorders are settled by “vote by committee” in the academic 
equivalent of the “smoke-filled room”.52 Needless to say, 
such a view, albeit possibly exaggerated, can affect public 
trust in psychiatry to a significant extent.
Although misophonia is believed to be far from rare,8,42 
this topic has attracted relatively little academic interest to 
date. Encouraging trends include the First International Con -
ference on Hyperacusis, which was organized by the tinnitus 
and hyperacusis therapy team of the Royal Surrey County 
Hospital and held at Birkbeck College (University of London) 
in 2013.53 This landmark event was followed by a highly suc -
cessful second scientific meeting held at the same premises in 
2015. There is general awareness that further research needs 
to be conducted before firm conclusions can be drawn with 
regard to both the pathophysiology and treatment of miso -
phonia. Ideally, a comprehensive research agenda should also 
encompass epidemiological, phenomenological, and genetic

aspects (Table 1). It is hoped that by combining qualitative 
and quantitative data from large populations, it will become 
possible to fully elucidate the hidden nature of this intrusive 
condition and alleviate the distress that it can cause.
