Objective: Misophonia is a psychiatric condition character-
ized by strong emotional and/or behavioral responses to
auditory stimuli, leading to distress and functional impair-
ment. Despite previous attempts to define and categorize
this condition, misophonia is not currently included in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or
International Classification of Diseases. The lack of formal
diagnostic consensus presents challenges for research
aimed at assessing and treating this clinical presentation.
Methods: The current study presents clinical characteristics
of youth ( N= 47) with misophonia in the largest treatment ‐
seeking sample to date. We examined demographic
characteristics of the sample, frequency of comorbid
disorders, frequency of specific misophonia symptoms
(i.e., triggers, emotional and behavioral responses, and
impairments), and caregiver ‐child symptom agreement.
Misophonia symptoms were evaluated using a multimodal
assessment including clinician, youth, and caregiver reports
on empirically established misophonia measures, and
concordance among measures was assessed.
Results: Youth seeking treatment for misophonia presented
with marked misophonia symptoms and an array of
comorbid conditions. Youth and caregivers identified

various triggers of misophonia symptoms (e.g., chewing
sounds, breathing sounds), as well as a wide range of
emotional (e.g., anger, annoyance, disgust) and behavioral
(e.g., aggression, avoidance) responses to triggers. Youth
and caregivers exhibited high agreement on misophoniatriggers but lower agreement on symptom severity and
associated impairment. Compared to younger children
(aged 8 −13), older children (aged 14+) appeared to report
symptom severity and associated impairment more reliably.
Conclusion: Misophonia is a heterogenous and impairing
clinical condition that warrants future investigation and
evidence ‐based treatment development.

1|INTRODUCTION
The term “misophonia ”was first coined by audiologist Pawel J. Jastreboff in the early 2000s following his clinical
observations of patients' negative reactions to specific auditory stimuli (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2000 ). When
triggered by a specific sound or anticipation of a sound, individuals with misophonia typically experience strongemotional and/or behavioral responses (Lewin et al., 2021 ; Potgieter et al., 2019 ; Rosenthal et al., 2021 ; Swedo
et al., 2022 ). Following the initial inception of the term, Schröder et al. ( 2013 ) characterized misophonia as a
psychiatric disorder and proposed criteria for its diagnosis. These proposed criteria included: (1) a strong adversereaction to the presence or anticipation of a particular sound produced by another human, (2) immediate feelings ofanger and a loss of self ‐control, (3) recognition of the unreasonableness of this reaction, (4) purposeful avoidance of
such sounds or intense discomfort in such situations, and (5) significant distress in daily life. Conceptualizations of
misophonia have more recently expanded to include a wider range of auditory triggers (i.e., nonhuman as well ashuman sounds) and responses (i.e., anxiety and disgust in addition to anger; see Swedo et al., 2022 ). Diagnostic
criteria for misophonia have also been proposed from an audiological perspective, though no formal diagnosis has
been established in this frame either (Aazh, 2023 ; Campbell, 2023 ). Misophonia is not currently included as a
psychiatric disorder in the latest versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM ‐5‐TR;
American Psychiatric Association, 2022 ) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD ‐11; World Health
Organization, 2022 ), despite previous attempts to categorize the condition and despite the clinical evidence that
misophonia is a distinct psychiatric phenomenon not explained by the presence of another disorder, that leads to
significant distress and impairment.
While misophonia research has grown considerably in recent years, there is still limited empirical evidence of
the prevalence, etiology, phenomenology, and clinical characteristics of this condition. Given the paucity in theliterature and the lack of formal nosology for misophonia, guidance, and consensus on the assessment and common
clinical presentations of misophonia remains unclear. Numerous clinician ‐and self ‐reported measures have been
developed to assess misophonia symptom presentation and severity to aid in diagnosis, yet it is unclear the extentto which these tools measure distinct aspects of the disorder versus related characteristics of commonly comorbid
psychiatric symptoms (e.g., anxiety, anger/irritability). Researchers examining clinical characteristics of individuals2 |LEWIN ET AL.

with misophonia have generally used convenience samples (e.g., undergraduate university students, online
crowdsourced individuals; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ; Wu et al., 2014 ) and variable measurement of misophonia for
inclusion criteria given the historical lack of consensus on disorder criteria (Rosenthal et al., 2022 ; Schröder et al.,
2013 ). Moreover, most existing research on the measurement and clinical presentations of misophonia symptoms
has been conducted within adult samples (e.g., Jager et al., 2020 ; Rosenthal et al., 2022 ). Recent research has
assessed misophonia within an internet ‐based youth sample (Guzick et al., 2023 ), yet little is known about the
clinical characteristics of treatment ‐seeking youth with misophonia.
To address these gaps in the literature, the current study presents clinical characteristics of youth misophonia
in the largest clinical treatment ‐seeking sample to date. Specifically, we examined demographic characteristics of
the sample, frequency of comorbid disorders, frequency of specific misophonia symptoms (i.e., triggers, emotional
and behavioral responses, and impairments), and caregiver ‐child symptom agreement. Misophonia symptoms were
evaluated using a multimodal assessment including clinician, youth, and caregiver reports on empirically establishedmisophonia measures, and concordance among measures was assessed.
2|METHODS
2.1 |Participants
Participants included 47 youth with misophonia (ages 8 −17) and their caregivers who were screened for enrollment
in a cognitive behavioral therapy treatment study (Lewin et al., 2021 ). Of these, 46 youth and 45 caregivers
completed study measures. Inclusion criteria included: (1) children who exhibited clinical ‐level misophonia
symptoms as defined as a clinical severity rating (CSR) of 4 ( “Moderate ”) or greater on the Misophonia Assessment
Interview (MAI) and/or a misophonia symptom severity score of 3 ( “Mildly Ill ”) or greater on the clinical global
impression –severity scale (CGI ‐S), (2) misophonia symptoms were the primary concern for treatment (in the case of
comorbidity), and (3) children and caregiver were able to complete informed consent and assessment procedures in
English. Exclusion criteria included: (1) children who had previously received treatment for emotional disorders (i.e.,
Unified Protocols for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children and Adolescents) ormisophonia, (2) children who presented with a psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, eating disorder, alcohol/substance use, intellectual disability, or active suicidal ideation.
2.2 |Measures
2.2.1 |Clinician ‐reported measures
Misophonia assessment interview (MAI ; Lewin, 2020 )
The MAI is a semistructured clinical interview created by Dr. Lewin based on proposed diagnostic criteria from
Swedo et al. ( 2022 ) and Schröder et al. ( 2013 ). The MAI is comprised of 11 items that assess various aspects of
misophonia and related symptoms, including sound sensitivities, emotional and behavioral responses to sound
triggers, distress caused by having excessive sensitivity of sounds (i.e., misophonia), and avoidance of specificsituations. Respondents also rated interference caused by misophonia symptoms on a scale from 0 to 8, where 0indicates “Not at all, ”4 indicates “Some, ”and 8 indicates “Very, very much. ”Caregivers and youth were both
administered the MAI. Clinicians assigned a misophonia CSR based on data gathered from the MAI. Approximately
half ( n= 26) of participants' CSRs were double ‐rated to assess interrater reliability. Agreement on misophonia CSR
ratings was good (Cohen's ϰ= 0.79, p< .001). In almost all cases (25 out of 26; 96%), clinicians agreed on whether
the presenting misophonia symptoms were above the clinical threshold (CSR ≥4).LEWIN ET AL. | 3

Anxiety and related disorders interview schedule for the DSM ‐5, child and parent version: Child interview
schedule (ADIS ‐5; Albano & Silverman, 2014 )
The ADIS ‐5 is a semistructured interview designed to assess for anxiety, mood, trauma and stressor, obsessive ‐
compulsive, and related disorders using criteria from the DSM ‐5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2022 ). The
ADIS ‐5 is based on previous versions of the ADIS, which have demonstrated strong psychometric properties (Wood
et al., 2002 ). In this study, the ADIS ‐5 was used to assess the presence of comorbid clinical conditions. Clinicians
assigned a CSR for each presenting comorbidity. A CSR for youth's misophonia diagnosis was assigned based on the
MAI. Disorder severity was rated on a scale from 0 to 8 and disorders rated 4 or higher were considered to meet the
threshold for clinical diagnosis of a comorbidity.
Clinical global impression ‐severity scale (CGI ‐S; Goodman et al., 1989 ; Guy, 1976 )
A modified version of the CGI ‐S was used to assess youths' overall severity and impairment of presenting
symptoms. Clinicians rated overall symptom severity on a 7 ‐point scale, ranging from 1 ( “No psychiatric illness ”)t o7
(“Extremely severe ”). In this study, clinicians provided both a CGI ‐S rating of the youths' overall illness severity and a
separate CGI ‐S rating specific to the youths' overall misophonia symptom severity.
Children's global assessment scale (CGAS; Shaffer et al., 1983 )
The CGAS is a measure of a child's overall psychological and social functioning. Overall functioning is rated on a
scale from 1 to 100, using 10 ‐point increments, on which 1 −10 indicates “Extremely impaired (needing 24 h care) ”
and 91 −100 indicates “Doing very well. ”
2.2.2 |Caregiver ‐and youth ‐reported measures
Amsterdam misophonia scale (AMISO ‐S; Schröder et al., 2013 )
The A ‐MISO ‐Si sa6 ‐item caregiver ‐and youth ‐reported measure of misophonia symptom severity. Total scores
range from 0 to 24. Scores of 5 and above are considered clinically elevated, and scores of 15 and above indicate
severe misophonia symptoms. Previous studies have demonstrated adequate ‐to‐good internal consistency for the
A‐MISO among youth with misophonia (Cervin et al., 2023 ; Guzick et al., 2023 ). In the current study, the AMISO ‐S
caregiver ( α= .71) and youth ( α= .70) reports exhibited adequate internal consistency.
Misophonia assessment questionnaire (MAQ; Johnson et al., 2013 )i sa2 1 ‐item caregiver ‐and youth ‐reported
measure that assesses misophonia ‐related thoughts and feelings. Items are rated on a scale of 0 ( None of the time )t o
3(Almost all the time ). Items are summed to create a total score ranging from 0 to 63. Scores above 22 indicate
clinically elevated symptoms, and scores above 43 indicate severe symptoms. The MAQ parent ‐and child ‐reported
versions have shown strong internal consistency among a sample of youth with misophonia (Cervin et al., 2023 ). In
the current study, the MAQ caregiver ( α= .94) and youth ( α= .92) reports exhibited strong internal consistency.
Misophonia questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014 )
The MQ is a three ‐part youth self ‐reported scale that evaluates misophonia symptoms, emotional and behavioral
responses, and overall condition severity. The MQ has participants respond to several statements on a 4 ‐point scale
from 0 ( Not at all true )t o4( Always true ). The MQ offers an overall rating of a respondent's misophonia on a scale of
1−15, with 1 being “Minimal ”and 15 being “Very severe. ”An overall severity score of 7 or above indicates clinically
significant misophonia symptoms. The MQ has previously shown good internal consistency among college students
(Wu et al., 2014 ). In the current study, youth report on the MQ symptom scale ( α= .63), the MQ emotional and
behavioral response scale ( α= .68), and the MQ total score (i.e., the sum of both the misophonia symptoms and
emotional/behavioral response scales; α= .68) demonstrated questionable internal consistency.
In addition to these questionnaires, youth and their caregivers also completed a demographics questionnaire.4 |LEWIN ET AL.

2.3 |Procedure
2.3.1 |Recruitment and enrollment
Potential participants were identified through routine clinic recruitment channels as well as advertising with local
mental health professionals, pediatricians, audiologists, and misophonia ‐based patient organizations. All study
activities were approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the two study sites. Caregivers provided informed
consent and youth provided assent before any study procedures.
2.3.2 |Participant assessment and compensation
Participants who appeared eligible after initial phone sc reening completed a semistructured clinical interview
using the ADIS ‐5 and MAI to assess presence and severity of misophonia and comorbid disorders. Assessors
were graduate student and post ‐doctoral clinicians trained to relia bility on both assessment measures.
Participants also completed caregiver ‐and youth ‐reported questionnaires at the time of the clinical
interview. Participants were compensated up to $50 for t heir completion of study procedures, including the
baseline clinical interview, youth ‐and caregiver ‐report questionnaires, and follow ‐up clinical assessments if
applicable.
2.3.3 |Data analysis
Descriptive analyses were conducted to characterize ( 1) the demographics of the sample, (2) frequencies of
comorbid disorders, measured using the ADIS ‐5 and associated CSR ratings, (3) overall symptom
severity of the sample, and (4) frequencies of speci fic misophonia symptoms, measured using the MAI.
Rates of agreement on each item of the MAI were cal culated between caregiver and youth reports.
Statistically significant symptom agreement/di sagreement was assessed by calculating Cohen's ϰ;pvalues
less than .05 indicate significant agreement, and pvalues greater than .05 indicate nonsignificant agreement,
or significant disagreement. Differential rates of sy mptom endorsement per reporter were assessed using
McNemar's test, which assesses whether one reporte r was more likely to endorse a given symptom across
the sample (i.e., caregivers consistently endorsing a given symptom more or less frequently than youth;indicated by p< .05). A correction for multiple testing was not employed given that the analyses were
exploratory in nature. Zero ‐order correlations were conducted to assess relationships among clinician ‐rated
misophonia severity and the caregiver ‐and youth ‐reported misophonia symptom measures. A post hoc
analysis was conducted to examine concordance of caregiver ‐and youth ‐reported measures between
younger (aged 8 −13) versus older (aged 14+) children to dete rmine if there were di fferences in these
relationships by age group.
3|RESULTS
3.1 |Demographic characteristics
The sample was majority female (69.6%), White (87%), and non ‐Hispanic/Latino (63%), with a mean age of 13.2
years (SD = 2.0). Caregiver demographics differed only marginally. See Table 1for demographic characteristics of
the study sample.LEWIN ET AL. | 5

3.2 |Clinical characteristics
3.2.1 |Comorbidities
Many participants had comorbid conditions along with their misophonia. The most common comorbid clinical
diagnoses included generalized anxiety disorder (36.2%), social anxiety (29.8%), and attention ‐deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (14.9%). See Table 2for frequencies of comorbid diagnoses among youth with misophonia.
3.2.2 |Misophonia symptoms
Overall, youth presented with moderate to severe misophonia symptoms and reported marked distress and
functional impairment. See Table 3for descriptive statistics for all symptom measures.
Symptom onset
All participants reported that their child's sensitivity of certain sounds had been happening for at least 4 weeks, with
35 youth (92.1%) and 35 caregivers (87.5%) indicating that their child has had this sensitivity of certain sounds for at
least 1 year. Youth reported a mean age of onset of 9.2 years (SD = 2.7), while caregivers reported a mean age ofonset of 8.7 (SD = 3.8). Caregivers also more frequently indicated that their child had experienced specific sound
sensitivity (i.e., misophonia ‐related symptoms) from birth.TABLE 1 Demographic characteristics of the study sample.

Triggers
Caregivers of youth with misophonia reported that eating sounds were the most common sound sensitivity ( n= 44,
98%), followed by breathing sounds ( n= 32, 71%), throat sounds ( n= 25, 56%), and tapping sounds ( n= 23, 51%).
Additional trigger sounds reported included environmental sounds (e.g., clock ticking, refrigerator humming, etc.;n= 8, 18%), rustling/clattering ( n= 10, 22%), specific language sounds/tones (e.g., “k”sounds, etc.; n= 10, 22%), and
sounds from silverware/dishes ( n= 8, 18%). Youth reports were consistent with caregiver reports of individual
sound triggers (see Table 4).
Emotional and behavioral responses
Caregivers most commonly reported t heir child experiencing anger ( n= 40, 89%) in response to hearing or
anticipating a trigger sound, followed by annoyance/irritation ( n= 36, 80%), distress ( n= 32, 71%), and
disgust ( n= 28, 62%). However, youth reported annoyance/irritation ( n= 42, 91%), followed by anger ( n=4 1 ,
89%), worry/anxiety ( n= 29, 63%), and distress ( n= 29, 63%) as emotional responses to sound triggers.
Caregivers also reported several behavioral responses to hearing or anticipating a trigger sound. About one ‐
third of caregivers reported that their child had become verbally aggressive in the past ( n= 30, 67%), and a
little over 40% reported that their child had lost self ‐control ( n= 19). Youth more frequently reported no
previous behavioral response ( n= 12, 26%) compared to their caregivers ( n= 8, 18%). Both youth (( n=3 1 ,
89%) and caregivers ( n= 28, 78%) in this sample reported awarene ss that their emotional response (e.g.,
anger, fear, irritation) was unreasonable or excessive.TABLE 2 Frequency of comorbid diagnoses among youth with misophonia.

Distress and impairment
Only 46% of youth ( n= 21) reported that having misophonia bothered or caused them distress (in contrast to 63% of youth
who reported that experiencing or expecting to hear trigger sounds caused them distress ). Caregivers agreed, with 44%
(n= 20) reporting that their child was distressed by having misophonia symptoms and 71% ( n= 32) reporting that
experiencing or expecting to hear trigger sounds caused their child distress . Nevertheless, a majority of youth participants
reported purposely avoiding specific people or place sa sar e s u l to ft h e i rm i s o p h o n i a ,w i t hf a m i l ym e m b e r s( n= 31, 67%)
and meals ( n= 28, 61%) being the most common. Additionally, many r eported using various protective measures such as
wearing protective equipme nt, headphones, or ear plugs ( n= 33, 72%); covering ears with hands ( n= 29, 63%); or eating
privately ( n= 29, 63%). For both caregiver and youth reports, only one respondent (2%) expressed using no protective
measures. Interference was reported by youth in a variet y of domains, including family life/relationships ( n= 35, 76%),
interacting with people ( n= 13, 28%), and learning/homework ( n= 13, 28%). Similarly, caregivers reported that family life/
relationships were the most frequently impacted ( n= 37, 82%) and additionally indicated their child experienced
interference with being in public ( n= 11, 24%) and attending classes ( n= 11, 24%). Youth reported a mean interference
rating of 5.4 (SD = 1.8) on a scale from 0, meaning “N o ta ta l l , ”to 8, meaning “Very much. ”Caregivers of youth with
misophonia reported an average i nterference rating of 5.76 (SD = 1.3) on the same scale. While overall interference ratings
were not significantly different between caregiver and youth reports, we had five youth give a rating of 0 −2, whereas no
caregiver reported interference less than 3.

special considerations ”(Cohen's ϰ= 0.19, SE = 0.19, t= 1.26, p= .209) for preventative actions in response to
misophonia triggers. Notably, disagreement on these items appeared to be at “random ”rather than in a particular
direction; caregivers did not consistently endorse these items more or less frequently than youth, as indicated by
nonsignificant McNemar tests for these items. Examining differential rates of endorsement, youth were significantly
more likely to report covering their ears ( n= 29, 62%) than caregivers ( n= 19, 40%; McNemar's test p= .013). All
other items were endorsed at similar rates by caregivers and youth across the sample (i.e., McNemar's test
p> .05) ( p> .05).

4|DISCUSSION
This study examined the clinical characteristics of 47 youth with misophonia in the largest clinical treatment ‐
seeking sample to date. The sample was predominantly female, White, and non ‐Hispanic, which is fairly consistent
with previously studied samples of youth with misophonia symptoms (Guzick et al., 2023 ; Wu et al., 2014 ). Most
youth presented with moderate to severe misophonia symptoms. A majority of youth presented with at least oneclinical comorbid condition, with the most common being generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, and
attention ‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The finding of high comorbidity in this sample is consistent with findings in
other samples (e.g., Guzick et al., 2023 ; Siepsiak et al., 2023 ).
Participants reported a variety of misophonia triggers, including but not limited to eating sounds, breathing ‐
related sounds, throat clearing and coughing sounds, and tapping, each of which has been identified as misophonia
triggers in prior studies (Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ). Surprisingly, only half of youth were reported to be distressed
about having misophonia (despite a high rate of reported distress associated with trigger stimuli, more specifically).This lower ‐than ‐expected rate of “distress with having misophonia ”by youth may reflect the range of
compensatory behaviors (including avoidance/accommodation) participants used to cope with misophonia ‐
related distress. Participants reported a range of emotional responses to hearing or anticipating a trigger sound,including annoyance, irritation, anger, worry/anxiety, and distress, as well as behavioral responses such as becoming
physically or verbally aggressive and losing self ‐control. A majority of youth were aware of the unreasonableness of
their emotional response to the sound triggers. Avoidance of people and locations was also commonly reported,with family members and meals being the most frequently avoided settings. Over two ‐thirds of participants
reported using protective measures in anticipation of trigger sounds, including wearing headphones, covering their
ears, or eating separately from others. Participants reported that their family life and relationships were impactedsignificantly by misophonia symptoms. Findings are largely consistent with prior studies indicating that misophoniasymptoms lead to a range of responses and impairments. However, compared to a recent study examining clinical
characteristics of youth misophonia in an internet ‐based sample (Guzick et al., 2023 ), participants in the current
treatment ‐seeking sample less frequently endorsed experiencing distress related to misophonia triggers (63% of
youth and 71% of caregivers reported distress caused by triggers sounds in this sample compared to 93% of youth
within the internet ‐based sample). Participants in this sample also less frequently reported engaging in emotional
and behavioral responses to triggers (e.g., 63% of youth and 56% of caregivers in this sample reported worry/anxiety as an emotional response compared to 79% of youth within the internet ‐based sample). While many
individual symptoms were reported more frequently within the internet ‐based sample, there were not any
noteworthy differences in the respective rates of symptoms (i.e., the more common and lesser common symptomsremained the same). Differences between these two samples may be related to sampling bias as the current study
required consent for participation in exposure ‐based treatment after baseline assessment whereas the internet ‐
based study did not. It is possible that particularly severe youth may have self ‐selected out of participation in the
current study. The sample of youth included in the current study nonetheless reported a range of clinicallysignificant symptoms and impairments distinct from those explained by comorbid disorders, without any one sole
consistent comorbid disorder across the sample, providing further evidence of misophonia as a distinct clinical
symptom presentation warranting evidence ‐based treatment.
We also examined concordance among a range of empirically established clinician ‐, caregiver ‐, and youth ‐
report measures of misophonia symptoms. Overall, findings suggest that caregivers and youth exhibit high12 |LEWIN ET AL.

agreement on specific misophonia symptoms (e.g., triggers) but lower agreement on symptom severity and
associated impairment. A closer examination of concordance among measures within younger children (8 −13 years)
versus older children (14+ years) subsamples suggests that adolescents are more reliable reporters (i.e., exhibit
greater concordance with clinician ‐and caregiver ‐report measures) of misophonia symptoms than young children.
This finding suggests that clinician and caregiver reports may be the most reliable reports of misophonia symptomsfor younger children. This finding could inform guidance for clinicians conducting clinical interviews of misophoniasymptoms with youth and families.
This study presents several limitations that should be noted when considering the results. The sample
was predominantly female, White, and non ‐Hispanic, and participants we re recruited from mostly urban/
suburban areas. Clinical characteristics of youth with m isophonia may differ slightly across racial, ethnic and
cultural populations. As misophonia is still an under studied condition, further validation of assessment
measures is needed, particularly among racially, ethni cally, and geographically representative samples.
F i n a l l y ,a n da sd i s c u s s e da b o v e ,c e r t a i na s p e c t so ft h i s study's recruitment and enrollment procedures may
have impacted characteristics of the sample. Youth we re only included if they had not previously received
treatment for misophonia, were willing to enroll in an exposure ‐based treatment, and identified misophonia
as the primary treatment target, and thus, it is likely that youth with more complex clinical presentations (e.g.,
nonresponse to prior treatment, tr eatment refusal, severe comorbid disorders) are not reflected in this
study's results.
Future research should continue to examine misopho nia as a distinct clinical condition needing further
investigation. Studies of misophoni a prevalence and clinical characteri stics should aim to recruit a diverse
array of participants from geographi cally representative locations to capture the full range of possible
symptom presentations. While various measures hav e been developed, as described in the current study,
future research is nonetheless needed to further establ ish the psychometric properties of these measures in
diverse populations and settings. Future etiological re search should aim to identify factors (e.g., specific
misophonia symptoms, comorbid disorders) associated with greater misophonia symptom severity and poorer
outcomes. Finally, as scientific understanding of misoph onia as a distinct clinical condition increases, efforts
should be made to design and empirically test clinica l interventions for this symptom presentation.
Transdiagnostic treatment approaches may be well ‐suited for the treatment of misophonia given the
apparent high rates of comorbid psychiatric disord ers. In particular, transdiagnostic cognitive ‐behavioral
interventions such as the Unified Protocols for Transdia gnostic Treatment of Emotio nal Disorders in Children
and Adolescents (Ehrenreich ‐May et al., 2017 ) may improve emotion regulation skills as to reduce the strong
emotional responses that characterize misophonia. For individuals who respond with anxiety and avoidanceto sound triggers, exposure ‐based cognitive behavioral intervent ions may be effective (Mattson et al., 2023 ),
although more research is needed in this area, as exp osure alone may not be sufficient for some youth with
misophonia. As misophonia is a heterogenous clinical c ondition with a range of triggers and emotional and
behavioral responses, evidence ‐based treatment approaches will need to be tailored to the unique symptoms
of the individual to maximize likelihood of response. Fur ther research will elucidate particular interventions
that are effective to treat differing patte rns of misophonia symptom presentations.
