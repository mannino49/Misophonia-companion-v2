ABSTRACT  
Misophonia disorder is a neurological disorder in which people show emotional, physical or aggressive reactions upon hearing a series of 
sounds, which ultimately leads to disruption in the work environment and relationships of these people. Therefore, the aim of this study 
was to investigate the effectiveness of cathodal tDCS and cognitive -behavioral therapy in reducing the symptoms of misophonia disorder.   
The current research is practical based on the purpose and based on the method of data collection, it was a semi -experimental type of 
pre-test and post -test with a control group. People with misophonia were selected and randomly assigned to five groups of 10 people, 
which included four experimental groups and one control group. The interventions included 9  sessions (tDCS) for 15 minutes with an 
intensity of 1 milliampere and 9 sessions of group cognitive behavioral therapy (120 minutes) and Wu's noise aversion questio nnaire was 
used. For data analysis, multivariate analysis of covariance was performed with SPSS -25 software.  
The findings showed that each of the tdcs and cognitive -behavioral treatments individually and also in combination reduce the symptoms 
of misophonia disorder.   It seems that tdcs along with cognitive behavioral therapy has more effectiveness, which reminds the need to 
pay more attention to this combined treatment method, also, cognitive -behavioral therapy and electrical stimulation each have significant 
results a nd effects in They have a reduction in the symptoms of misophonia disorder . 
 
Keywords:   Hearing impairment, Misophonia disorder, Cognitive -behavioral therapy, Electrical stimulation of the brain . 
 
Introduction    
Misophonia is a strong emotional reaction to normally occurring 
sounds. Jastreboff & Jastreboff coined this term at the beginning 
of the new millennium [1]. Lexicologically, miso means dislike 
or hatred and phonia means sound. Thus, misophonia means 
sound aversion or hatred of sound. According to Dozier, 
misophonia is a term that does not include the hatred of all 
sounds, but only the hatred of certain sound s, which are called 
triggers [2]. Misophonia was also first described as an 
overreaction of the limbi c and autonomic systems of the brain in 
response to specific auditory stimuli [3]. The term “misophonia” 
means hatred of sound, which was first introduced to the 
scientific community in 2001 by Jastreboff, although this term 
was used at first to express the difference between different 
terms in the field of hearing, which was caused by  intolerance to 
sound, such as hyperacusis and phonophobia. None of these terms expressed the psychological state of a person suffering 
from misophonia. Thus, the new term mis ophonia was coined. 
However, more experts expanded the meaning and concept of 
this disorder due to the prevalence of this disorder.  
The symptoms of this disorder include a very intense and 
negative reaction toward trigger sounds [4, 5, 6] .  Trigger sounds 
are often related to the sound of the nose or mouth, such as the 
sounds of breathing, finning, straining, and chewing food, and 
some other sounds such as typing and the ticking of the clock. 
They are considered stimulating sounds for some pe ople. The 
patients are mostly aware of the inappropriateness of their 
reaction to the sound source but are unable to control their 
reaction and use  a series of coping mechanisms such as avoiding 
the social environment [7]. Using these mechanisms leads to 
disruption in the work environment and relationships between 
these people. These people experience loneliness and exclusion 
from society [8]. The rejection of these people leads to more 
loneliness leading to more anxiety and the worsening of the

disorder . 
Misophonia disorder is a mental disorder in which people have a 
kind of sound sensitivity syndrome and show emotional, 
physical, or aggressive reactions when hearing some sounds. 
These can affect people's nerves. They can include the sound of 
typing on a keyboard, a car wiper, a faucet running, drawing 
chalk on a board, breathing, a clock ticking, chewing, or 
whistling, and other sounds that can cause annoyance and 
sensitivity to people.   In other words, misophonia are sounds that 
are repeated frequently and people with this disorder show 
nervous reactions to them. The frequency of creating this sound 
can exacerbate this disorder [9]. 
Materials and Methods  
Research design and participants  
The present study is applied regarding purpose and quasi -
experimental type of pre -test, and post -test, with a control 
group in terms of data collection method. The statistical 
population of the present study included all people with 
misophonia in Mashhad i n 2022. A convenient purposeful 
sampling method was used in this study.  
Accordingly, explanations were given about misophonia disorder 
to the participants in a call on various social networks. Then, the 
subjects were asked to answer the misophonia questionnaire. 
Then, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. The 
inclusion criteria of the study included the willingness to 
cooperate and participate in the study, having at least a secondary 
level of education, physical and cognitive ability, not suffering 
from physical diseases to participate in therapeutic interventions , 
being in the age range of 15 to 55 years, and not taking drugs at 
least two weeks before the start of the intervention. The 
exclusion criteria included pregnant women, people outside the 
age range of 15 to 55 years, and people with physical illnesses, 
using drugs, alcohol consumption, and suffering from brain and 
skull injuries. Accordingly, 60 people with misophonia were 
selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were 
randomly assigned to five groups of 12 people.  
 
 
According to  Research design , the quasi -experimental design of 
the present with the participation of 50 people includes four 
experimental groups (Group 1: tDCS therapy, Group 2: 
cognitive behavioral therapy, Group 3: tDCS therapy plus 
cognitive behavioral therapy, and Group 4: sham group) and one 
control group. The experimental and control groups were 
rando mly matched and before the experimental interventions 
were assigned to the experimental and control groups, a pre -test 
was implemented on them. The diffe rence between the pre -test 
and the post -test of each group was analyzed based on statistical 
significance. Accordingly, the effectiveness of tDCS and 
cognitive behavioral therapy was applied to determine its effect on reducing the symptoms of misophonia disorder. The data 
collection tool included Wu et al .’s (2014) misophonia 
questionnaire  [10]. After selecting the sample group and 
assigning them randomly into four experimental groups and one 
control group, the experimental groups received the 
interventions.  
Tools  
Misophonia Questionnaire: The Misophonia Questionnaire is a 
self-report tool developed by Wu et al. in 2014 to assess the 
symptoms of misophonia and emotional and behavioral 
responses, the overall intensity of sound sensitivity, and 
functional impairment  [10]. This questionnaire contains 17 items 
divided into two subscales [10]. 
1- Subscale of misophonia symptoms: This subscale evaluates the 
frequency and severity of misophonia symptoms experienced by 
the respondent. The items of this subscale assess the intensity of 
bad reactions to specific stimuli that are usually associated wi th 
misophonia.  
2- Subscale of emotions and behaviors caused by misophonia: this 
subscale assesses the emotional and behavioral responses caused 
by misophonia stimuli. It assesses the range of emotional 
experiences (such as anger and anxiety) and coping behaviors 
(such as  avoidance) in response to stimulus stimuli.  
This questionnaire is scored on a 5 -point Likert scale ranging 
from very high, high, moderate, low, and very low in a score 
from 0 to 4 indicating the intensity of or degree of agreement of 
the respondent to each item. This questionnaire provides a 
compreh ensive assessment of misophonia symptoms, and 
emotional responses, and allows a multidimensional 
understanding of this disorder. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 
calculated at 0.86 for the scale of misophonia symptoms, 0.86 for 
the subscale of emotions and  behaviors caused by misophonia, 
and 0.89 for the whole scale [10]. 
Transcranial direct current stimulation  (tDCS): tDCS is a non -
invasive brain stimulation method that uses low electrical current 
to modulate brain activity. Two electrodes are usually involved 
in tDCS: an anode (positive electrode) and a cathode (negative 
electrode). A small brain stimulation dev ice that transmits a 
constant electric current from the skull to the brain by 
connecting electrodes with the different polarity of the anode 
(activating) and cathode (inhibiting) that are installed on the 
scalp, and  the electrodes that are mostly made of carbon and 
conductive materials, are placed on the scalp and the device 
transmits direct electrical current from the skull to the brain. A 
sponge soaked in salt solution is often used to prevent chemical 
reactions at  the electrode -skin interface. The device was 
powered by a 9 V battery, with a maximum current of 2 mA and 
a maximum voltage of 80 V in direct current (DC) format [10]. 
At this stage, the target brain regions were selected according to 
the international sy stem of 10 -20 electrodes. A 2.5 x 2.5 cm 
cathodal electrode was placed at the midpoint between F8 and 
T4, while the anode electrode was placed on the arm in both 
cases, and the subject was exposed to sounds and images that

Journal of Advance d Pharmacy Education & Research  | 2024 | Vol 14  | Issue S1                                                                                       3 stimulated misophonia. The electrodes were approximately the 
same size. In each tDCS session, a constant current of 1 mA was 
applied for 15 min. The total number of sessions was 9. 
Stimulation for the sham group was stopped after 30 seconds. 
Each group rec eived 5 stimulation sessions every other day. This 
montage was adapted by applying changes from the montage that 
Sagliano et al. (2019) designed in 2020  [11]. After completing the 
treatment sessions, all the subjects in the experimental, control, 
and sham groups underwent a post -test. One of the experimental 
groups received cathodal and cognitive behavioral sessions 
simultaneously.  
Cognitive behavioral therapy: In this section, all subjects 
underwent a pre -test before the intervention. The experimental 
group received 9 sessions (45 minutes) of counterconditioning -
focused cognitive behavioral therapy. In the counterconditioning 
stage,  based on new results in the field of the role of mirror cells 
in causing misophonia disorder, images containing pleasant faces 
and also desirable sounds were used after presenting the 
misophonic stimulus. After the completion of the treatment 
sessions, al l the subjects underwent a post -test and the 
experimental and control groups were compared. As mentioned, 
one of the experimental groups received tDCS and cognitive 
behavioral sessions simultaneously. The treatment protocol of 
the cognitive behavioral ther apy was adapted from Jager et al. 
(2020) and the changes considered by the researcher (related to 
the counterconditioning part) were added  [12]. 
Cognitive behavioral therapy protocol (based on 
counterconditioning)  
The first session: welcome, introduction, initial evaluations, and 
familiarity with the program. In this session, Lazarus Coping 
Styles Questionnaire and Misophonia Questionnaire were 
completed by the subjects.  
The second session: interaction of thoughts, emotions, 
physiology, and behavior, and identification of automatic 
thoughts.  
The third session: evaluation of automatic thoughts related to 
misophonic stimuli, training of thought model of behavior 
emotion.  
The fourth session: Opposing automatic thoughts and replacing 
proportional logic. Identifying intermediary thoughts and core 
thoughts and explaining them to avoid stressful situations.  
The fifth session: Identifying specific mediating beliefs and 
analyzing thoughts and how to reconstruct and prepare logical 
opposing.  
The sixth session: In this session, relaxation training was 
performed. Accordingly, the person was placed in a comfortable 
place and began to contract and extend all his muscles from head 
to toe in a quiet and peaceful environment.  
The seventh session: continuation of relaxation along with 
playing misophonic images and sounds and immediately after that 
playing pictures of happy faces with soft music.  
The eighth session: Continuing the process of the seventh session 
and selecting an alternative behavior instead of avoiding and 
confronting the client's opinion.  The ninth session: Termination of treatment and completion of 
misophonia and coping styles questionnaire.  
Data analysis  
 The data were analyzed in two sections using SPSS -25 software.  
The first section: This section presents a report of descriptive 
results using prevalence, percentage, mean, and standard 
deviation indices.  
The second section: In this section, to test the hypotheses of the 
study, after examining the assumptions of the multivariate 
analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), which includes the 
normality and homogeneity of the variances, multivariate analysis 
of covariance test (with control of pre -test scores ) was used.  
Results and Discussion  
Descriptive results  
 
 
 Base on finding regarding the misophonia variable, the highest 
mean in the groups is related to the tDCS group, and the lowest 
mean is related to the control group in the pre -test stage. Also, 
the highest mean is related to the sham group, and the lowest 
mean is related t o cognitive behavioral therapy in the post -test 
phase. Also, regarding the variable of excitement caused by 
misophonia, the highest mean is related to the sham group, and 
the lowest mean is related to the control group in the pre -test 
stage. The highest mean is related to the sham group and the 
lowest mean is related to the cognitive behavioral and tDCS 
group in the post -test stage.  
Inferential results  
In this section, based on the research hypothesis, a multivariate 
covariance analysis test was used. Therefore, we will examine the 
assumptions required to use the test:  
Normal distribution of variables: This assumption means that the 
distribution of variables in this society was normal. In other 
words, the parametric test can be used when the population 
distributions do not differ much from the normal distribution 
[13]. To examine the normal distribution of the variables due to 
the small sample size, the Shapiro -Wilk test was used. A 
significance level higher than P<0.001 in this test indicates the 
normal distribution of the variables [14]. The following table 
presents the  results.  
 
 
The results  show that the distribution of all variables by groups is 
normal (P ≤0.05).  
2. Equality of variances: This assumption means that two samples 
have been selected from populations with equal variances. In 
other words, the parametric test can be used when the variances

[13]. To examine the equality of variances, Levene's test of 
equality of variances was used. In this test, if the significance level 
is higher than 0.05, it means that the assumption of equality of 
variances is fulfilled [15]. The results of this hypothesis are shown 
in the table below.

of variance error

Misophonia  1.50  4 44 0.217  
Excitement caused 
by misophonia  2.17  4 44 0.087  
  
According to the results of the above table, it can be concluded 
that the equality of variances has been fulfilled in all variables.  
3. The assumption of equality of variance -variance matrices: the 
fulfillment of this assumption is necessary for multivariate 
variance analysis. Generally, the assumption of equality of 
variances seeks to investigate whether the samples are selected 
from p opulations with equal variances or not. When this 
assumption is fulfilled, the data from these two populations can 
be combined to obtain an unbiased estimate of the population 
variance [13]. 
The implementation of the assumption of equality of variance -
variance matrices also follows such a goal. Box's M test is used to 
examine the quality of the variance -variance matrices of the 
research variables. Based on the significance level obtained in th is 
test, it is possible to judge the equality or non -equality of the 
variance -variance matrices. Thus, if the obtained significance 
level is higher than P = 0.05, the matrices are equal and vice 
versa [15]. The results of this hypothesis are shown in the t able 
below.

variance -covariance matrices  
Box` s M  F Df1 Df2 Sig 
25.42  1.90  12 13939.921  0.059  
 
The results of the above table show that the assumption of 
equality of the variance -covariance matrix has been fulfilled 
(P<0.05).  
3. Multiple Correlation of Dependent Variables: There are 
disagreements about the extent to which dependent variables 
should be correlated with each other. This assumption is 
examined using Bartlett's test. The significant coefficients of this 
test indicat e the multivariate correlation between the dependent 
variables [14]. The results of this hypothesis are shown in the 
table below. The results indicate the fulfillment of this 
assumption.  
 
Table 3. Results of Bartlett's test of sphericity  
X2 value  df sig 12.47  2 0.002  
 
Based on the results of Table 6 , the above assumption is fulfilled.  
Given what was stated, the necessary assumptions to implement 
the test have been fulfilled. Thus, the test results are reported.  
 
 
The assumption of equality of the regression slope is fulfilled for 
all variables (significance level is higher than 0.05).  
A multivariate test was used in this study. This test compares the 
linear combination of variables among the subjects of different 
groups. The results of the Wilks -Lambda test are presented as 
one of the most valid multivariate tests when the assumptions o f 
the analysis are fulfilled. The results a re reported in the table 
below.  
 
Table 4. Multivariate test  
Variable  Wilks -

Group membership  0.403  5.889  0.00  
 
 the difference in the linear combination of variables in the groups 
is statistically significant. The level of effect or difference 
according to the Wilks -Lambda test is 0.403, in other words, 
40% of individual differences in the post -test scores of 
misop honia symptoms and excitements and behaviors caused by 
misophonia is related to the effectiveness of TDCS and cognitive 
behavioral therapy in people suffering from misophonia (group 
membership).

According to the above table, it can be concluded that by 
controlling the pre -test effect, there is a significant difference 
between groups based on group membership in all variables. 
Thus, the general hypothesis of the  study is confirmed.

As shown in Table 6, by controlling the pre -test, there is a 
significant difference between the subjects in the tDCS, cognitive 
behavioral therapy, cognitive behavioral group plus tDCS, sham, 
and control groups regarding the variable of misophonia 
symptoms. Therefore, the hy pothesis related to the variable of 
misophonia symptoms is confirmed (p<0.05). In other words, 
the tDCS therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and cognitive 
behavioral therapy plus tDCS according to the mean symptoms 
of misophonia of the subjects in the ex perimental groups 
compared to the mean of the control group and the sham group 
caused a decrease in the misophonia symptoms in the 
experimental groups.

Control  sham  2.223 - 0.412  
 
Based on Tables 6 and 7, if the significance level related to 
pairwise comparison is less than 0.05, the difference will be 
significant.  
As presented in Table 7, by controlling the pre -test, there is a 
significant difference between the subjects in the TDCS, 
cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive behavioral group plus 
tDCS, sham, and control groups regarding the variable of 
excitement caused by misophonia. Thus,  the hypothesis related 
to the excitement caused by misophonia is confirmed (p<0.05). 
In other words, tDCS therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and 
cognitive behavioral therapy plus tDCS according to the mean 
symptoms of misophonia  of the subjects in the experimental 
groups compared to the mean of the control and the sham groups 
reduced the excitement caused by misophonia in the 
experimental groups.  The present study investigates the effectiveness of tDCS based on 
brain mapping in the right anterior insular region and 
counterconditioning -focused cognitive behavioral therapy in 
reducing the symptoms of misophonia disorder and improving 
the coping style . Multivariate analysis of covariance was used for 
this purpose. The results revealed that both tDCS therapy and 
cognitive behavioral therapy separately and the simultaneous use 
of tDCS therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy reduce the 
symptoms of misoph onia disorder and improve coping styles in 
people with misophonia disorder.  
These results are in line with those of studies by Kumar et al. 
(2017) regarding the effectiveness of tDCS, Schr öder et al. 
(2017), Aazh et al. (2019), Jager et al. (2021), and Safari (2021) 
regarding the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy in 
reducing misophonia symptoms  [12, 16 -19]. Although the 
difference between the intervention methods was not significant, 
based on mean symptoms of misophonia in the subjects of the 
experimental groups compared to the mean of the control group, 
it can be concluded ethat among the three types of in tervention 
or treatment (1 -tDCS, 2 - cognitive behavioral therapy, 3 - tDCS 
plus cognitive behavioral therapy) in reducing the symptoms of 
misophonia, tDCS therapy was more effective than the other two 
methods of inter vention, and the cognitive -behavioral plus tDCS 
has the least effect.  Also, tDCS therapy was more effective in 
reducing the excitement caused by misophonia, and cognitive 
behavioral therapy was less effective than the other two 
interventions. These results are somewhat consistent with the 
results of studies by Safari (2021) and Abramovitch et al. (2024)  
[19, 20] . In interpreting and explaining these results and the 
reason for the higher effectiveness of tDCS therapy in reducing 
misophonia symptoms, we can refer to the results of 
Abramovitch et al. (2024), who studied the neuropsychology of 
misophonia  [20]. 
In this study, people with misophonia disorder performed 
significantly weaker in 2 neuropsychological outcomes, including 
verbal memory recovery and attention, than the control group. 
The misophonia group reported significantly higher symptoms of 
anxiety, behavioral impulsivity, and functional disorders. They 
had a higher rate of ADHD and OCD. Thus, based on the 
mentioned study, it can be stated that misophonia disorder is 
widely related to the nervous system and brain. In this regard, 
misophonia has been d escribed as an overreaction of the limbic 
and autonomic systems of the brain in response to specific 
auditory stimuli in one of the well -known definitions [3]. Thus, 
tDCS can have significant effectiveness. Also, the number of 
cognitive behavioral therapy sessions and the improvement of the 
skills in conducting the sessions make this intervention method 
to be more effective. Also, it seems that the interference , fatigue, 
loss of quality, and accuracy in the simultaneous use of tDCS and 
cognitive behavioral therapy lead to a decrease in its 
effectiveness.

6                                                                                      Journal of Advance d Pharmacy Education & Research  | 2024 | Vol 14  | Issue S1   It is concluded that each tDCS and cognitive behavioral therapy 
individually and simultaneously using them reduces the 
symptoms of misophonia disorder. However, tDCS is more 
effective, highlighting the need to pay more attention to this 
method of treatment . Also, cognitive behavioral therapy has 
significant effects in reducing misophonia disorder symptoms. 
Accordingly, one of the treatments mentioned above methods 
can be considered considering the conditions and facilities. 
However, observing and paying att ention to considerations such 
as the conditions of the clients, the correct application of the 
principles and techniques of cognitive behavioral therapy, setting 
the appropriate number of sessions, conducting treatment 
follow -up courses, and using up -to-date guidelines can 
significantly increase the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral 
intervention.  
The results revealed that cognitive behavioral therapy, despite its 
effectiveness in reducing misophonia symptoms, was less 
effective than tDCS therapy. Thus, it is recommended to pay 
more attention to the number of sessions, principles, and 
techniques of cognitive behavioral therapy, and up -to-date 
protocols in this area. Additionally, due to the significant 
effectiveness of the tDCS method, the introduction of this 
method of intervention in scientific and academic workshops, 
and mass media, healthcare cen ters should benefit from this 
method along with other treatment methods.
