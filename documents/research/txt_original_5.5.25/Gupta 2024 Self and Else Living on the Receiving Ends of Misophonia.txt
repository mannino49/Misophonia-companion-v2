Self And Else Living On The Receiving Ends Of Misophonia

Deepak Gupta MD

Misophonia is an underdiagnosed disorder wherein self and/or else suffering from it may not be even aware about it. Thereafter, it may be understandable to assume that one (self or else) suffering because of its underdiagnosed presence in other (else or self) may even be rarely if ever explored. Anyhow, while being accommodative to underdiagnosed misophonia in self or else, else or self on the receiving end of misophonia may have to learn the temporary adaptations if interacting transiently or the permanent adaptations if living permanently with self or else suffering from underdiagnosed misophonia.

-  The first adaptation could be to recognize and understand that self or else may be suffering misophonia whenever objecting to else or self not regulating the production of sound by else or self.
-  The second adaptation could be to measure with various available decibel meter apps how much else or self uptrends the decibels when gulping fluids (maybe nothing change), relishing chocolates (maybe low 40s become high 40s), biting apples (maybe low 40s become high 60s) and urinating standing (maybe low 30s become high 60s) as compared to watching news or working keyboards (maybe low 40s become low 50s). Maybe so on and so forth.

-  The third adaptation could be to gauge pathophysiology and evolutionary significance of misophonia in self and/or else. Could sound be getting transmitted via open unblocked nostrils to induce misophonia? Could sound be getting conducted from non-muscular shallow bones to induce misophonia? Could it be the sound of cuisine? Could even loud sound of joy and celebration be resonating and even fibrillating heart of self or else? Were sounds emanating while drinking, eating and completing any other body function for activities of daily living as well as for instrumental activities of daily living thus distracting peers while attracting dangerous predators searching for preys in the evolutionary jungle? Maybe so on and so forth.
-  The fourth adaptation could be for else or self to decide whether or not to adapt by ingesting only ultra-processed choke-free liquid diet at least whilst wining dining publicly unless the privacy in isolation allows ingestion of chewable raw solids as well; and whether or not to adapt by urinating sitting only at least whilst using public toilet unless urinating standing induces misophonia at home as well. Maybe so on and so forth. not only for the sake of self but also for the sake of else, the bottom-line is that publicly biting an

Although it may take an unpredictable amount of practice and experience for inadvertent sound generation by self or else to get promptly recognized, understood and corrected by self or else apple a day may actually be keeping the doctor and everyone else away especially if self and/or else is suffering from underdiagnosed misophonia because only Kevin Hart can generate accepting laughs whilst noisily urinating standing in 'The Man from Toronto' onscreen.
