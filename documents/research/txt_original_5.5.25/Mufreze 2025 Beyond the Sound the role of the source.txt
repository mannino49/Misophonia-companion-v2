## ABSTRACT

Introduction: Misophonia is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterised by  abnormally  extreme  reactions  to  certain  sensory  stimuli.  In  this paper, we aimed to investigate the effect of the individual producing the human-generated trigger sound on the level of discomfort reported to the trigger sound. Our hypothesis was that when the misophonic sound is presented with the information that it is produced by a relative, it will create more subjective discomfort than the sound presented with the information that is not produced by a relative.

Methods: This experimental study was conducted with 15 participants aged 18-65 years living in Antalya who volunteered to participate in the study.

voice was presented with the information that it was not produced by the relative (p&lt;0.001). In the second comparison, participants reported more subjective discomfort when the voice of the relative was presented with the information that it was produced by the relative than when the voice of the relative was presented with the information that it was not produced by the relative (p=0.001). In the final comparison, there was no significant  difference  in  subjective  discomfort  between  presenting  the voice of the voice bank with the information that it was produced by the relative and presenting the voice of the relative with the information that it was produced by the relative (p=0.783).

Results: In  the  first  comparison, participants reported more subjective discomfort when the voice from the sound bank was presented with the information that it was produced by the relative than when the relative's

Conclusion: In conclusion, it seems source of the trigger, especially for human-made sounds, is more important than the trigger sound itself.

## INTRODUCTION

Misophonia is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterised by abnormally extreme reactions to certain sensory stimuli. The term 'misophonia' was coined in the early 2000 s, combining the Greek words miso ,  meaning hatred,  and phonia ,  meaning  sound,  to  describe  a  group  of  patients who differ from other patients in terms of decreased sound tolerance (1).  Individuals  with  misophonia are often sensitive to sounds that are considered  insignificant  by  other  people  (2).  Triggers  in  misophonia can  be  human,  such  as  throat  clearing,  chewing,  slurping,  smacking, breathing  and  gasping  are  examples  of  human-induced  sounds  or environmental  sounds  (3).  The  intensity  of  the  emotional  response  to the  trigger  is  expressed  through  emotional  reactions  (anger,  anxiety, disgust)  and  physiological  activation  (muscle  tension,  increased  heart rate,  skin  reactions)  (4).  People  who  respond  to  misophonic  triggers report difficulty separating their attention from the sounds and negative thoughts, sometimes accompanied by aggressive impulses ('I hate that person'  or  'I  can'  t  stand  it').  Common  behavioural  responses  include staring at or imitating the person making the sound, verbal agitation or aggression, and rarely physical aggression (5).

Considering current research, Jastreboff et al. (2014) reported that 3% of the general population and 90% of cases of decreased sound tolerance were reported to have misophonia. In another study, it was observed that

## Highlights

- · Sound bank voice as a relative's voice is more disturbing than their voice as another's.
- · Relative's voice as itself is more disturbing than as the voice of someone else.
- · Sound bank voice as a relative's voice is not more disturbing than their own voice.

20% of the participants had clinically significant symptoms of misophonia (6). In the study conducted by Naylor et al. in 2021 with medical students in  the  United  Kingdom,  approximately  49.1%  of  the  participants  were found to have clinically significant misophonia (7). In a study conducted in Türkiye, the prevalence of misophonia was found to be 12.8% and it was observed that only 5.8% of the participants sought help (8). There are also studies suggesting that misophonia may be genetically transmitted. In one study, a total of 15 people in 3 generations of the family studied had

symptoms of misophonia. This has led to the discussion that misophonia may be genetically transmitted of (9). In a study of approximately 500 participants who met the criteria for misophonia, it was found that 33% of participants had a family history of misophonia (10).

Studies  have  suggested  that  misophonia  is  not  caused  by  a  pathology related  to  audiological  problems,  but  that  abnormal  processes  occur because of increased or strong connections in the limbic and sympathetic nervous  systems  that  occur  when  exposed  to  trigger  sounds  (11,12). The study in which Kumar et al. addressed the neurological processes in the aetiology of misophonia suggested that it may be a neurological disorder (13). They also investigated which regions of the brain may be associated  with  the  triggering  sounds  in  misophonia.  Based  on  their functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results, it was suggested that  misophonia  may  be  associated  with  increased  activity  in  the anterior insular cortex and regions associated with the processing and regulation  of  emotion,  including  the  ventromedial  prefrontal  cortex, amygdala,  posteromedial  cortex,  and  hippocampus.  It  has  also  been reported that when misophonics are exposed to triggering sounds, they exhibit high autonomic responses, such as increased heart rate, and the anterior insular cortex plays a mediating role in this situation. Another study investigating the neurobiological processes of misophonia found that the volume of the right amygdala was larger in misophonics, and the  connection  between  the  left  amygdala  and  the  cerebellum  was increased. The reason for all this is thought to be increased emotional reactivity, physical responses to triggers and the effect of visual triggers. In other words, it has been suggested that there are abnormalities including emotional and attentional dysfunction in misophonia (14).

A review of the studies shows that the onset of the participants' symptoms was in childhood and adolescence. In the study by Schröder et al. (2013), the average age of onset of the participants was 13 years (15). In another study, 80% of participants reported that their symptoms started in preadolescence.  These  participants  mostly  reported  that  their  symptoms started  in  childhood,  when  they  were  disturbed  by  the  sounds  made by  family  members  while  eating  (16).  Furthermore,  in  some  studies, participants stated that the sounds that disturbed them were of human origin (such as family members with whom they had a close relationship), that  they  were  not  affected  by  their  own  sounds  or  animal  and  baby sounds, and that they were sometimes even disturbed by their own inner voices (2,15,17). However, there is no empirical study that investigates the statement pointing out 'If the source of the trigger is someone who is close to (18) the misophonic, it generates more disturbance'. The most recent study pointing to this statement is the study presented by Natalini et al. where three cases were presented in which maladaptive schemas and personality were examined in misophonia. In two of these cases, it was observed that, in one of them, the feeling of discomfort was reduced when he realised that a pigeon was making the noise; in both, the state of their relationship with their partner influenced the feeling of discomfort related to the misophonia.

In this paper, we aimed to investigate the effect of the person producing the human-generated trigger sound on the level of discomfort reported to  the  trigger  sound.  Our  hypothesis  was  that  when  the  misophonic sound is presented with the story of the voice of the relative, it will create more subjective discomfort than the sound presented with the story of not being the voice of the relative.

## METHODS

## Participants

This experimental study was conducted with 15 participants aged 18-65 years  living  in  Antalya  who  volunteered  to  participate  in  the  study.  A power analysis was conducted via G*Power 3.1.9.7. With 0.05 alpha error and 0.9 effect size, the sample size was calculated as 16. However, the sample size was determined in line with the recommendations of Cohen (2013), in which at least 15 participants are needed for an experimental study (19).  In  addition,  all  participants  were  informed  about  the  study and their written informed consent was obtained. The participants were given the socio-demographic information form, A-MISO-S (Amsterdam Misophonia  Scale)  and  Misophonia  Questionnaire  (MQ).  Inclusion criteria were as follows: being an individual between the ages of 18-65, having moderate and high scores on the MQ and A-MISO-S, not having a  neurological  disorder,  not  having  a  severe  psychiatric  disorder  such as  schizophrenia  spectrum  disorder,  bipolar  spectrum  disorder,  and volunteering to participate in the study.

## Measurement Tools

The subjects who participated in the selection/acceptance phase of the study were given an 'informed consent form' before the study began and were asked to confirm that they were participating in the study voluntarily. The MQ and the A-MISO-S were completed online for subject selection/ acceptance, and those who met the inclusion criteria completed them again by hand with other scales before the experiment.

## Socio-demographic information form

The socio-demographic information form we used in our study included questions about gender, education level, employment status, occupation, marital  status,  whether  they  had  children,  whether  they  were  taking medication, and whether they had a psychiatric disorder. This form was completed jointly by the participant and the clinician.

## Amsterdam misophonia scale (A-MISO-S)

An  adapted  version  of  the  Yale-Brown  Obsessive-Compulsive  Scale (Y-BOCS), which has been adapted for various conditions and is mostly used to measure OCD, was developed by Schröder et al. (2013) to measure the severity of misophonia (15). The Turkish validity and reliability study was conducted by Sarıgedik and Gülle in 2021. As a result of the study, it was found to be valid and reliable above the age of 15 (20). This Likerttype  scale  (range  0-24),  consisting  of  6  sub-domains,  measures  1)  the amount of time patients spend with misophonia; 2) its impact on social functioning; 3) the level of anger; 4) the level of resistance to impulses; 5)  how  much control they have over their thoughts and anger; 6) the amount of time they spend avoiding misophonia situations. A score of 0-4 is given for each item. Scores between 0-4 are considered subclinical, between 5-9 as mild, between 10-14 as moderate, and between 15-19 as severe, between 20-24 as extreme.

## Misophonia questionnaire (MQ)

The MQ developed by Wu et al. (2014) and adapted into Turkish by Sakarya and Çakmak (2022), aims to measure the symptoms of misophonia and the emotions and behaviours that occur when encountering the triggering sound (6,21). The scale is divided into 2 factors. The first factor examines the presence of symptoms of misophonia and consists of 7 statements. The items are answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'definitely not true' [0] to 'always true' [4]. The second factor measures the emotions and behaviours experienced when encountering the trigger sound and consists of 10 items. These items are answered on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'never' [0] to 'always' [4]. The scale is scored by looking at the responses to a total of 17 statements in these two factors. The total scale score ranges from 0-68. As the scale score increases, it is assumed that  there  is  an  increase  in  the  frequency  of  misophonia  symptoms and the negative emotions and behaviours developed by the person in response to them. In the last part of the scale, the patient is  asked  to select the number and degree of sounds to which he/she is sensitive, and how much they interfere with his/her daily life, on a scale of '1-15' . This section provides information on the severity of the misophonia and is not

included in the factor structure or scoring. In this section, scores of 7 and above indicate clinically significant misophonia.

## Procedure

Ethical  approval  was  obtained  from  the  Social  and  Human  Sciences Ethics  Committee  of  Antalya  Bilim  University  before  the  study  started (Approval No: 2023/25). All volunteers who met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study were explained the tests to be applied and the experimental procedure in detail and their written consent was obtained. The Sociodemographic Data Form, A-MISO-S and MQ were administered to all volunteer participants.

## Experimental Design

Participants  were  exposed  to  a  3-step  experimental  procedure.  The experimental set-up was performed in the same order and in the same way for each participant. The participant and researcher were seated at a desk facing each other, with the computer screen facing the researcher. The  participant  wore  a  pair  of  Apple  Inc.  AirPods  headphones.  The misophonic  trigger  sounds  transmitted  by  participants,  neutral  and constant sounds selected by the researcher were presented through the headphones at 75% of the computer volume.

The experimental phase started with individuals with moderate and high scores on the A-MISO-S and MQ. Participants were contacted using the contact  details  provided  in  the  socio-demographic  information  form they had filled in and were first asked to record for at least 20 seconds the triggering sound of their relative that disturbed the participant the most, in a place with as little external noise as possible. After the participants transmitted the sound, the sounds were processed using the Apple Inc. IMovie application on the Apple Inc. Macbook Pro computer used by the researcher and ByteDance Capcut application on A. Ş. Acer computer, and the triggering sound was amplified to minimise the possibility of the participant recognising the sound and giving a biased response. In terms of the content of the sounds obtained from the participants, 12 of them were the slurping sound when chewing food and 3 of them were the crunching smacking sound when eating a food such as chips and crackers. Due to the different sound contents, 1 sound of the slurping sound when chewing food and 1 sound of the crunchy smacking sound when eating a food such as crisps and crackers were selected as fixed sounds, like the sound contents obtained from the participants in the ByteDance Capcut application, to be listened to while presenting a false story. In addition, in order not to increase the clients' discomfort and to provide an objective measure, the sound of water was selected and listened to from the Spotify AB  application  as  a  neutral  sound  before  listening  to  each  triggering sound. 5 repetitions of breathing exercises were performed, and 5-minute breaks  were  taken  between  the  sounds  for  relaxation.  The  interviews were conducted in the same room for each participant, creating the same experimental  environment  and  using  the  same  materials  (computer, headphones). The applications were conducted in a quiet and normally lit room, with the participant and researcher sitting opposite each other and the computer facing the researcher. Subjective levels of discomfort were measured verbally using the VAS scale (Figure 1).

An individual trial started with 5 repetitions of breathing exercises before the trigger sounds and stories were presented and the neutral voice was played for 1 minute. The voice from the sound bank is presented to the participant as the voice of a relative and listened to for 20 seconds, and the subjective level of discomfort at this time is measured and recorded on a VAS scale between 1 and 10. The participant is made to listen to the neutral voice for 1 minute with 5 repetitions of breathing exercises and a  break of 5 minutes. The voice of a relative is presented as someone else's  voice  and  listened  to  for  20  seconds,  and  the  subjective  level  of discomfort at this time is measured and noted on a VAS scale between 1 and 10. The participant is made to listen to the neutral voice for 1 minute by performing 5 repetitions of the breathing exercise, and a break of 5 minutes is taken. The voice of the relative is presented as the voice of the relative and listened to for 20 seconds, and the subjective level of discomfort at this time is measured and noted on a VAS scale between 1  and  10.  The  participant  is  made  to  listen  to  the  neutral  voice  for  1 minute with 5 repetitions of breathing exercises, and the application is terminated after 5 minutes. A representative version of the experimental set-up is shown in Figure 1. Participants were informed in advance that a subjective discomfort rating of '1' on the VAS scale indicated little or no discomfort, whereas a rating of '10' indicated extreme discomfort, a strong reaction that they wanted to avoid or could not tolerate.

## Statistical Analysis

Frequency and descriptive analysis were conducted for sociodemographic  variables  and  scale  scores.  To  investigate  differences between  VAS  scoring  belonging  to  each  experimental  phase,  the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was used. The confidence interval in the study was 95%. For this reason, the Type-1 error level was used and evaluated as 5%; p&lt;0.05 indicates significance. For analysis, IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) program version 22.0 was used.

## RESULTS

Socio-demographic variables are presented in Table 1. Data-related scale scores and VAS scoring are exhibited in Table 2.

There  was  no  significant  difference  between  genders  (respectively p=0.840; p=0.840), educational status (p=0.448; p=0.536), marital status (p=0.859; p=1.000), occupational status (p=0.056; p=0.104), having children (p=1.000; p=0.840), psychiatric disorder (p=0.463; p=0.281) and medicine usage (p=0.136; p=0.295) in terms of A-MISO-S and MQ scores.

Comparison 1: Sound bank voice as relative's voice vs. relative's voice as the voice of someone else

As  the  result  of  the  Wilcoxon  Signed  rank  test  for  the  comparison  of disturbance levels between sound bank voice as the relative's voice and the relative's voice as the voice of someone else, participants reported significantly higher subjective disturbance level to sound bank voice as the relative's voice (p&lt;0.001, Z=-3.482).

Comparison 2: Relative's voice as relative's voice vs. relative's voice as the voice of someone else

In  the  second  comparison,  the  subjective  disturbance  level  was  significantly higher to the relative's voice as the relative's voice in comparison with the relative's voice as the voice of someone else (p=0.001, Z=-3.472).

All three comparisons are presented in Figure 2.

## DISCUSSION

In this study, we only focused on one single hypothesis. The hypothesis is that when the misophonic trigger is presented with the information of a relative's voice, it will cause more subjective discomfort than the voice presented with the information of a non-relative's voice. The results of the analysis confirmed this hypothesis.

The results of the study by Edelstein et al. (2020), in which they investigated the influence of context on the way misophonic react to voices, showed that  the  source  of  the  misophonic  trigger  plays  an  important  role. Schröder et al. (2013) reported that animal or infant sounds are generally less disturbing than adult human sounds. Not only did the study show that human eating sounds were generally perceived as significantly more annoying  than  animal  non-eating  sounds  for  misophonic,  but  it  also showed that the interpretation of these sounds can significantly influence how annoying they are perceived to be. In the present study, significant differences  were  found  between  the  subjective  discomfort  scores  of subjects who thought the voice source was not their relative, even when it was not their relative, and the subjective discomfort scores of subjects who thought the voice source was someone else's voice, even when it was their  relative.  This  finding  suggests  that  the  source  of  the  voice  is more important than the trigger sound itself.

Research  on  misophonia  shows  that  people  feel  more  uncomfortable with  the  sounds  made  by  their  relatives  and  that  they  cause  more discomfort (2,15,17). In the study conducted by Schröder et al. (2013), it was found that the misophonic responses were more intense, especially to  the  sounds  made  by  family  members.  At  this  stage  of  the  current study, results have been obtained that support the previous studies and this  discourse  of  patients  with  misophonia.  The  factor  that  should  be considered here is not who the source of the misophonic sound is, but who the patient perceives the sound to be.

The existing literature states that the context is more important than the structural characteristics of the misophonic trigger. Although it has been stated by experts in the field that who produces the sound within the

context is also important, there has been no objective data beyond an interpretation of the patients' statements. In this study, we aimed to reveal this subjective statement in an experimental setting. In accordance with the  hypothesis,  the  discomfort  felt  was  greater  when  it  was  presented in the story that the sound was produced by the relative, regardless of the sound itself. This finding shows us that misophonia is more than just exposure to so-called triggering sounds. Misophonia patients react more intensely when a relative makes the sounds or when they realise that they cannot get away from these sounds (17). At the same time, there are also patients who state that the sounds are made deliberately to disturb them and even report that their discomfort increases when they believe this (18). Again, in a study conducted by Edelstein et al. in 2013, 80% of the participants stated that their first symptoms began in childhood, when they  were  disturbed  by  the  sounds  made  by  family  members  during meals. Putting all this information together, it can be thought that the condition may have arisen because of interactions with family members during childhood, and that in subsequent periods, relationship problems with that family member may manifest themselves through misophonic responses.  In  other  words,  it  is  thought  that  in  addition  to  sensory sensitivity to the triggering sound, there is a matching of negative feelings towards the family member who made the triggering sound.

When  we  look  at  the  neurobiological  part  of  the  pairing  of  negative emotions with misophonic trigger sounds and the reactions that occur when  exposed  to  the  trigger  sound,  it  is  necessary  to  mention  the amygdala in the structure of the limbic system. Sensory stimuli arriving at the thalamus go to the amygdala on the short pathway and to the sensory cortex  on  the  long  pathway,  and  sensory  responses  are  generated.  In other words, the amygdala evaluates incoming stimuli (22). The amygdala system is faster. The amygdala is an important structure for the emergence and  learning  of  the  fear  response  and  related  emotional  processes. The  amygdala  is  stimulated  in  situations  of  fear,  stress,  or  anxiety  (23). Once stimulated,  the  central  nucleus  of  the  amygdala  stimulates  many centres via glutamate. In other words, the amygdala helps to recognise these situations to avoid situations that are mapped as dangers that may reappear in evolutionary processes related to survival from the past to the  present.  However,  because  of  these  mappings,  it  is  said  that  it  can re-enact the traumatic experience if there are no triggering factors and cues to remind it of the traumatic event (24). This re-experiencing leads to avoidance. Looking at misophonia from this perspective, the amygdala can be thought of as negatively mapping the traumatic and/or dangerous situation for misophonics. In this context, for a misophonic who expresses that he is more disturbed by his family members, especially the sound of his relative's mouth spluttering affects him badly, considering the amygdala's relationship with unconscious processes and the automatic reactions it gives, it can be thought that the mapping after the negative experience he may have had with his relative is actually paired with the normal sound, resulting in a reaction and avoidance. In the context of this study, it can be argued that the fact that the participants were more disturbed when they heard the sound source because they thought it was a close person may be related to the stimulation mechanism and negative mapping of the amygdala, and the fact that they were less disturbed by people outside may also be related to the emotional mapping in the amygdala.

The function of the amygdala is controlled by the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Considering the relationship between the amygdala and  the  hippocampus,  the  hippocampus  is  responsible  for  regulating the  stress  response  triggered  by  the  amygdala,  if  the  hippocampus  can function properly, the stress response can be stopped, but prolonged stress can impair the functioning of the hippocampus (25). The hippocampus is  known to be effective in memory and almost all sensory stimuli such as sight, hearing and smell activate the hippocampus, especially in recent studies (26). This connection between the amygdala and the hippocampus makes us think that the state of being more disturbed by relatives' voices in  misophonia  may  be  the  negative  form  of  a  mechanism  such  as  'the effect of the good affect that occurs when a positively mapped recognised sound or smell is perceived on the formation of good affect when similar sounds or smells are perceived'. In other words, it should be discussed that the hippocampus may be disrupted in its relationship with the amygdala as a result of prolonged exposure to stressful events, and that when the triggering  sound  is  exposed,  negative  past  life  experiences  are  recalled from the hippocampus with the unconscious effect, and now automated sensory responses are produced by the amygdala, and that this may be the  reason  why  misophonics  feel  more  uncomfortable  when  they  hear the  source  of  the  sound,  thinking  it  is  a  relative.  In  addition,  smacking one's mouth while eating is a sign of appreciation in some societies, but an unwelcome behaviour in others. If we look at the research on mouth smacking, which is considered normal in China, we find findings related to misophonia (27). This further supports the idea that misophonia may be related to the negative mapping of sounds, regardless of the environment.

Another  neurobiological  explanation  for  our  results  could  be  attained from  the  study  conducted  by  Kumar  et  al  (28).  In  this  study,  authors indicated  that  misophonia  could  be  hyper-mirroring  of  the  orofacial action of others and they observed stronger activation of the orofacial motor area in response to trigger sound and stronger resting state fMRI connectivity  between  both  visual  cortex  and  auditory  cortex  and  the ventral  premotor  cortex  responsible  for  orofacial  movements.  In  our study, all the participants brought us an orofacial action-related trigger sound in the misophonia group. When we gave them sound with the information  that  'This  sound  was  produced  by  your  relatives'  ,  this statement could stimulate participants  to  image  visually  their  relatives while they are producing the trigger sound.

As a result of the findings, it was observed that the discomfort of hearing the  sound  source  as  a  relative  of  the  patient  with  misophonia,  even if  the  sound  source  is  not  a  relative  of  the  patient  with  misophonia, is  higher than the discomfort that occurs when the sound source is a relative of the patient with misophonia and is perceived as a different sound  source.  Looking  at  the  psychological  interpretation  of  the neurobiological interpretation, one study found that after exposure to the triggering sound, misophonics had discourses such as 'why am I like this? The people making the sound are very inconsiderate and rude, I hate them, I want to hurt them, they could have been more considerate' (16).  Taking  these  discourses  into  account,  it  can  be  suggested  that when it comes to misophonic triggers, patients with misophonia use projection and displacement defence mechanisms and associate them with sound.

There  are  several  limitations  to  the  study.  The  first  limitation  of  the current  study  is  that  the  participants  were  selected  from  people  with moderate and high levels of misophonia. As the level of discomfort in misophonia increases, so does avoidance. In the experiment, some of the misophonics who were told they would be exposed to the trigger sound refused to take part in the study. It was therefore difficult to find participants. Another limitation of the current study is the measurement of subjective discomfort scores saying that the first story presented to the participants was 'the sound of the sound bank, the sound of a relative -  the  sound  of  a  relative,  the  sound  of  someone  else'.  Although  it  is taken into account that the participant, who already knows that he/she is disturbed by his/her relative at the beginning of the study, is honestly reporting the scores, psychological bias may be an issue. However, it is believed that this limitation is minimised by the model used in the study. Another limitation is that the participants were not asked whether the sound of water, which was used as a neutral sound, was neutral for them. This  sound  was  selected  from  the  sound  list  in  the  study  of  Kumar  et al.  (28).  However,  no  participant  reported  any  discomfort  after  neutral sound  exposure  during  the  study.  Added  to  this  we  did  not  evaluate

factors which are observed as variables increasing the irritability of the participants such as smoking, fasting, caffeine consumption etc. Finally, Participants'  subjective  level  of  discomfort  was  assessed  using  the  VAS scale, and the physiological response was not measured objectively.

In conclusion, it seems the source of the trigger, especially for humanmade  sounds,  is  more  important  than  the  trigger  sound  itself.  These data show that misophonia is a neuropsychiatric disorder that is more than  an  exaggerated  negative  response  to  certain  sounds.  With  better experimental design, a larger sample and the addition of physiological measurements or fMRI, our findings will be taken further.
