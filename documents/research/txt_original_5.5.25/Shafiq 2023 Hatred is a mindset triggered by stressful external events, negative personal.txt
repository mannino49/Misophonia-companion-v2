## Abstract

Objectives: Hatred may affect the mental health of oneself or of others. This article aims to explore what information can be obtained from the medical literature to understand the reasons regarding the generation of hatred in human beings. Methods: Systematic search of medical literature was carried out on the PubMed medical library to identify articles that deal with the subject matter of hatred. Articles included were those added to the PubMed library in 2015 and onwards till the date of data collection. Included articles were divided into ten categories according to the aspect of hatred discussed. Full text search of those articles was carried out that were identified under the category of 'generation of hatred' was carried out. Data was collected to understand the generation of hatred by carrying out a thematic analysis.

Results: The word hatred is used in a variety of meanings in medical literature. Medical researchers utilise a variety of methods and take several different kinds of approaches to understand various aspects of development of hatred.

Hatred is a mindset that people can develop for several reasons. Hatred can take a focus towards one's own self, towards inanimate objects or towards other people. Stressful events, personal interpretations, group interpretations and real or virtual life environmental factors are some of the major reasons that may contribute towards the generation of hatred. Conclusion: Findings from this literature search suggest that there is no single pattern or theory that can fully explain the development of hatred in humans: hateful mindsets can manifest in numerous ways. Each manifestation can be understood in its unique context and background. There seem to be some common external and internal factors that are recurrently identified across the studies that tend to play a role towards its generation.  Some of the internal reasons that may lead to development of hatred include personal attitudes, negative cognitions, negative feelings, and individual motivations of the hater etc. Some of the external reasons may include suffering sexual abuse, negative life experiences and exposure to online hateful activities on social media etc.

## INTRODUCTION

## Human emotions

Understanding and studying human  emotions has  attracted  experts  throughout  the  history  of mankind. Freud refers to the pivotal role of human emotions  as  an  integral  part  of  a  growing  baby's experience in some  of  the most  fundamental concepts that he described. Oedipal Complex and Ambivalence both include interplays of emotions (Freud,  1924).  Darwin  studied  emotions  across various cultures of the world, not only in humans but  in  animals  too.  His  book  on  this  subject  is titled  `The  expression  of  the  emotions  in  man and  animals´  (Darwin,  1872).  Eckman  who  is  a psychologist and anthropologist developed an atlas of  human  emotions.  He  identified  10,000  facial expressions that can express up to 3,000 different kinds  of  emotions  (Ekman,  2018).  He  states  that words are representations of emotions, but not the emotions themselves. According to him, `Emotion is a process, a particular kind of automatic appraisal influenced by our evolutionary and personal past, in  which  we  sense  that  something  important  to our welfare is occurring, and a set of physiological changes  and  emotional  behaviours  begin  to  deal with the situation´ (Ekman, 2004). Eckman identified six basic emotions including fear, anger, joy,  sadness,  disgust,  and  surprise.  Hatred  is  not

one of them.

## Definition of hatred

Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines hatred as `extreme dislike or disgust, ill will or resentment that is usually mutual and as prejudiced hostility or animosity´. The word is well-known to speakers of the English language. It is commonly used in dayto-day  interactions  and  in  a  variety  of  informal meanings. For example, hatred may be used interchangeably to express negative emotions such as  disgust  or  resentment  or  dislike  or  disrespect etc. Expressions like love-hate are well known both in  verbal  and  written  communications.  Few  haterelated  terms  have  started  receiving  importance following some significant events around the globe. For  example,  hate-crime,  hate-group,  group-hate, hatemonger, hate-speech, hate-mail, hate-rally, racial-hate,  hate-campaign,  or  collective-hate  etc. Hatred is used as noun. Hate is used as both verb and noun. Hateful is adjective. Hating is verb.

## Hatred in Philosophy

Brogaard (2020) describes in her book, titled `Hatred, Understanding Our Most Dangerous Emotion´ that all emotions have some characteristic attached to them  sometimes  also called their valence.    Hatred  is  one  with  a  negative  valence. She  describes  some  other  important  concepts  to elaborate on hatred. `Intentionality´ is the outward directedness  of  our  mental  state.  `Intentionality´ separates emotions from moods, the latter are not about any particular  thing  or  event.  For  example, depression may be experienced by those suffering from mood disorders without any reason. Emotions have a focus of concern (or simply called `focus´), i.e., something that has triggered the emotion. For example, it can be triggered in response to an action or  verbal  expression.  Emotions  may  also  have  a target  though  this  may  not  always  be  the  case. However,  hatred  has  both.  `Emotional  blaming´ involves accusing others, holding them responsible for  their  actions  or  foreseeable  consequences  of their actions. However, in the case of hatred, blame is above  and  beyond  the  observer's  perception of someone's guilt. How an observer's mind perceives  something  then  leads  to  a  relationship impairing attitude in them.  In the case of hatred, the  generation  of  relationship  impairment  is  also accompanied  with  a  kind  of  inner  protest.  The blame, thus, may manifest as 'disrespect' for the one who is hated because they performed the act that is disapproved.

Brogaard identifies three further types of disrespect including critical disrespect, dehumanising disrespect, and hubris. When blame involves dehumanising  disrespect,  it tends to focus on who  one  is,  rather  than  what  one  has  done.  She calls this human tendency of dehumanising blame for  their  flawed  character  as  condemnation.    To condemn someone for their flawed character is to disrespect them for cultivating or failing to unlearn the corresponding bad habits. Contempt creates an irreparable  power  imbalance  and  hate  is  also  tied to fear or reprehension. Hate is a complex emotion, built out of negative emotions: resentment, condemnation, and reprehension. Disrespect is the component that unites antagonistic emotions such as anger,  resentment,  indignation,  envy,  blame, contempt and hate.

## Hatred in Neurology

There are several attempts done to understand the neurological  aspects  of  hatred.  For  example,  Zeki and Romaya carried out functional MRI studies to examine the neurological reactions inside the brains of  the  participants  when  they  viewed  the  images of  the  people  who  they  hated  (Zeki  and  Romaya, 2008).  The  authors  reported    that  certain  parts  of the brain including the amygdala and the premotor cortex showed  increased activity when  people watched these images. The authors concluded that, there  is  a  unique  pattern  of  activity  in  the  brain in the context of hate, distinct from the pattern of activity that correlates with romantic love.

## Hatred in Neurodevelopment

From  the  neurodevelopmental  perspective  when we  encounter  a  stimulus  then  the  hippocampal system usually is the first responder that may draw information  from  neocortical  system  to  help  us understand  the  meaning  of  the  stimulus.  If  the stimulus  is  repeated,  then  it  may  become  part of general  knowledge  based  neocortical  system permanently (Bodenhausen et al., 2003). This system enables us to navigate through reality quickly without  paying  much  attention  to  each  stimulus repeatedly. He describes that these schemas help us make sense of unspecified and unknown aspects of stimuli or situations.  Although this system offers some flexibility, it is not perfect and is prone to errors

whilst  analysing  information.  For  example,  how  a person appreciates stereotypes can be considered as an error in interpretation of social information in these schemas. The stereotypes get embedded into the  neocortical  system  and  are  highly  resistant  to change. Once the stereotypes get incorporated into a person's world view then several cognitive errors can  make  it  persistent.  Errors  in  judgment  can sometimes happen just by automatic activation of schemas.

## Hatred in Sociology

Culture  is  sometimes  called  `the  personality  of  a society´.  Society  teaches  its  norms  to  individuals living within them and these differ across cultures. Social identity theory emanates from social cognition tradition (Tversky and Kahneman, 1973).  Social  cognition  approaches  rely  on  the observations that the human mind is not a perfect information processing unit. The human mind has an innate tendency to utilize shortcuts to categorize information quickly and efficiently from our social worlds and draw conclusions from what we perceive. These  shortcuts,  or  mental  heuristics,  allow  for faster processing of information, but they also make us  susceptible  to  a  wide  array  of  poor  judgments. Some authorities believe that social categorisation of individuals, such as gender and ethnicity, would not  gain  importance  unless  they  are  internalised (Tajfel et al., 1979). An individual may internalise a  variety  of  social  identities  that  may  manifest  in different  kind  of  encounters  that  a  person  comes across in life.  Availability heuristic as described by Tversky  and  Kahneman  also  influences  people´s tendancy to overestimate certain classes of events. When memory of certain events is available readily, its prevalence is overestimated (Tversky and Kahneman,  1973).  Some  of  the  social  influences that may  contribute  to  development  of  hatred include prejudice (Taylor and Moghaddam 1994), intergroup aggression (Sherif, 1937), construction of social norms (Sherif, 1937), the power of social roles  (Zimbardo  et  al,  1974),  bystander  apathy (Latan  and  Darley,  1968),  obedience  to  authority (Milgram, 1965) and conformity (Asch, 1951). `Ingroup´ is a term used to describe a social group to which  a  person  psychologically  identifies  with. On  the  contrary,  `out-group´  is  a  social  group with  which  an  individual  does  not  identify  with. According to Harrington, the social scientists consider intergroup hostility, aggressive behaviour, prejudice, and ethnocentrism as the major factors that lead to the development of hatred in a group (Harrington, 2004).

## Hatred in Psychology

Staub  (2005)  defines  hatred  as  a  strong  negative feeling against the object that is hated. The hater sees the object of their hatred as bad, immoral, dangerous, or all this together. According to him, a triangle of three components leads to development of hatred. They include negation of intimacy (distancing from object of hatred), presence of passions (for example intense  anger)  and  the  cognitions  of  diminution and  devaluation  through  contempt  for  targeted group. The hater considers contempt towards target group  and  considers  them  barely  human  or  even may  consider  them  inhuman.  Hatred  then  leads to acts of intense violence, for example, terrorism, massacres, and genocides (Sternberg, 2005).  Based on  this model  Sternberg  outlined  seven  types of hatred  that  consist  of  components  of  these three  factors  in  various  combinations.  `Accepted hatred´  is  one  in  which  intimacy  is  denied  but no  harm  is  done.  `Hot  hatred´  is  dominated  by intense feeling of hatred that may result in escape or  attack.  `Cold  hatred´  is  dominated  by  feelings of  devaluation.  `Burning  hatred´  is  one  in  which a group is inferiorised and it is felt that something needs to be done about this group. In `simmering hatred´ an individual is disliked forever, intimacy is denied, and commitment is devalued. In `furious hatred´ passion and devaluation of commitment is observed. And `all-embracing hatred' is dominated by denial of intimacy, devaluation of commitment and passion often resulting in a need to annihilate the one that is hated.

Navarro  et  al  (2013)  reported  that  the  victim  of hatred  is  devaluated  intentionally  with  increasing intensity  to  a  degree  that  they  loses  all  human  or moral  considerations  in  the  eyes  of  the  hater.  As the feeling of hatred is intensified the hater can take steps  to  harm  or  even  eliminate  the  object  that  is hated. To support the ideology of hatred, relevant situations are created, and even facts are distorted to spread and promote hatred.

In the cognitive behavioural model, it is understood  that  thoughts  influence  feelings  and emotions that in turn influence behaviours (Beck, 1991).  The  following  cognitions  are  reported  to contribute  to  the  generation  of  hatred  including: overgeneralisation  i.e.,  generalising  a  small  event

or information to the entirety; arbitrary inference or assumption i.e., unrealistic, or false conclusions drawn from common appraisal or observation of a situation; emotional reasoning, i.e., the tendency of an individual to assume that their feelings always bring them the correct information; selective abstraction  i.e.,  the  ability  of  an  individual  to selectively pick  and  choose  the  negative  from the greater picture ignoring all the positives; maximisation or magnification i.e., minor flaws or shortcomings of an individual or group are blown out of proportion; minimisation i.e., contributions and capabilities are minimised or ignored as if those aspects related to them are irrelevant; catastrophic thinking, i.e. the ability to jump on to the worstcase  scenario  triggered  by  a  minor  stimulus;  and dichotomous  thinking  i.e.,  dividing  individuals into  absolute  discrete  categories  (Navarro  et  al., 2013).

## Rationale for this study

When  medical  professionals  come  across  hatred, it  generates several questions: where does it come from; does the word hatred always refer to the same meanings; are we born with it; is it manufactured or synthesised or created; and what reasons or factors contribute to its generation.  Medical professionals, particularly  mental  health  and  forensic  professionals, seek to explore the answers to questions like this. They are sometimes dealing with the client groups that  require  psychological  formulations  aimed  at understanding the predisposition, presentation, precipitation,  and  perpetuation  of  various  hateful activities  and  behaviours.  They  are  expected  to identify protective factors that can help understand and stop development of hatred. Hatred can manifest  in  the  form  of  signs  and  symptoms  of certain psychiatric conditions too, like depression, psychosis,  phobias,  or  PTSD.  Reverse  causality also plays a role between hatred and mental health problems:  is  it  hatred  that  leads  to  mental  health problems  or  vise  versa?  Consider  the  example of  hatred  exhibited  by  those  who  are  involved  in terrorist activities. Mental health professionals are keen to understand whether terrorists are mentally unwell,  thus,  get  involved  in  such  activities,  or they get involved in such activities and as a result become unwell.

This study seeks to find answers to these questions by systematically reviewing the medical literature. One purpose of this study is to test the observation whether the word hatred is used with a variety of meanings in medical literature or not. Another is to combine the knowledge that is acquired from the data regarding the generation of hatred.

## AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

To  carry  out  systematic  literature  search  on  an international  medical  database  to  find  what  the emerging categories in which the word hatred is used in medical literature are, and to gather information regarding the generation of the emotion of hatred in  human  beings  by  thematically  analysing  the relevant collected data.

## METHODS

To  identify  the  information  on  hatred  relevant for  mental  health  professionals,  we  performed  a systematic  review  using  the  following  approach and  criteria.  We  used  the  following  strategies  for literature identification and selection.

## Literature search strategy

Research was carried out on PubMed database on National  Library  of  Medicine  (NCIB),  to  identify the studies containing words 'hate' , 'hatred' , 'hateful' or 'hating' within the title or abstract of the articles. We  used  the  following  search  terms:  hate  [Title/ Abstract]) OR (hatred [Title/Abstract])) OR (hateful [Title/Abstract]) OR (hating [Title/Abstract].

## Eligibility criteria

All relevant medical studies that were available on Pub Med medical database on 14th Nov 2021.

## Inclusion criteria

The included articles contained either of the words hate/hatred/hating/hateful in either title or abstract.

## Exclusion criteria

There were no exclusion criteria.

## Paper selection strategy

A total of 1193 studies were identified on 14th Nov 2021 utilising the above search terms. To keep the focus  on  the  current  relevance  of  generation  of hatred,  papers  from  2015  to  2021  (as  appearing on PubMed  library on 14th November  2021)

containing  any  of  the  four  words  (Hate,  Hatred, Hateful,  Hating)  either  in  the  title  or  the  abstract were selected for the review. This led to the selection  of  500  of  the  most  recent  studies  on PubMed as  appearing  on  NCIB  (National  Center for Biotechnology Information) library.

## Data extraction

Titles  and  abstracts  of  the  identified  five  hundred studies were reviewed by the author and imported to NVivo (qualitative data analysis software) version-10 for data interpretation and an endnote diary of references was kept. After removing duplicates, 470 studies were included in the review. They  were  categorized,  and  selected  papers  were submitted to thematic analyses.

## Data items and synthesis of results

Following the title and abstract review, each study out  of  the  470  was  categorised  according  the  10 content themes to understand different aspects of the use of word `hatred´ in medical literature. Data was then extracted from 113 studies that qualified for the emerging category of 'generation of hatred' after  full  text  review.    With  the  intention  to  carry out  a  thematic  analysis  aimed  at  understanding the  generation  of  hatred,  each  of  the  113  studies was given a code with the aim to understand the generation  of  hatred.  The  common  codes  were combined under one theme. The details of emerging themes are discussed within the results sections of this paper.

## Thematic analysis

Thematic  analysis is a method  of  interpreting qualitative  data.  According  to  Braun  and  Clarke (2006) thematic analysis is a method for identifying, analysing, and reporting patterns (themes) within data. It minimally organizes and describes the data set in rich detail. Sometimes it may go deeper and attempt  to  interpret  multiple  aspects  of  the  topic being researched (Boyatzis et al, 1998). According to Braun and Clarke, a theme captures something important about the data in relation to the research question  and  represents  some  level  of  patterned response or meaning within a data set. Overall, the thematic analysis aims to find the repeated pattern of  themes  that  can  be  clustered  together,  and  the final product must contain an account of what was done and why.

## RESULTS

## Outcome of Literature search and eligibility assessment

To organise the papers we followed the Prisma flow diagram. The diagram shows our selection process.

To  find  that  in  which  context  the  words  hate/ hatred/hateful/hating were used and what medical researchers  were  aiming  to  explore,  the  following ten categories emerged (table 1).

In all ten identified categories, a record was kept of the titles of the studies with relevant references and of the context in which the word/s were used within the title or abstract.

The  table provides  the results of the eligibility assessment for the subject generation of hatred. Only those 113 studies that focused on the generation of hatred were used for further analysis and discussion. The sum total of studies in this table is 488. This is due to some studies being included under more than one category.

The  following  paragraph  indicates  the  categories in  papers  used  and  not  used  in  further  thematic analysis. According to the eligibility assessment, the following categories were not included in the main analyses of the generation of hatred. The categories are  explained  to  reveal  their  differences  from  the main subject of the study i.e. generation of hatred.

## Literal meaning of the word

79 studies were identified as using the word hate or hatred in literal meaning. For example, as used in the title of the study, 'Salmonella and Reactive Oxygen Species~ A Love-Hate Relationship' (Rhen, 2019).

## In context of medical or psychiatric conditions

20  studies  were  identified  as  using  the  word  hate or hatred as a symptom of a medical or psychiatric condition.  For  example,  as  used  in  the  title  of  the study,  'Confinement  and  the  Hatred  of  Sound  in Times of COVID-19: A Molotov Cocktail for People with Misophonia' (Ferrer-Torres and GiménezLlort, 2021).

## Unique meanings

7  studies were identified as using the words hate/ hatred in some unique sense that couldn't be coded elsewhere.  For  example,  in  the  abstract  of  the study,  `Image-based  Analysis  of  Emotional  Facial Expressions in Full Face Transplants´, the authors described that they studied 6 emotional expressions in patient who underwent face transplant and one of them included hate (Bedeloglu et al., 2018).

## Word is used but not relevant to current investigation

6 studies were identified in which the words hate/ hatred  was  used  in  a  context  considered  to  be irrelevant  to  the  overall  aim  of  the  study.  For example,  the  study  titled,  `Is  there  an  association between  surgeon  hat type and 30-day wound events  following  ventral  hernia  repair?´  (Haskins et al., 2017). The abstract contained the statement: Our  findings  suggest  that  surgical hate type  may be  chosen  at  the  discretion  of  operating  room personnel without fear of detriment to their patients. The word hate is a typo/misspelling here.

## Used in keywords but not in title or abstract

25 studies were identified that contained one of the four words within the 'keywords' section but not in title or abstract of the study. They were not included in the overall interpretation.

## Topic of a piece of writing

Two  studies were identified in which  authors discussed  hate/hatred  as  commenting/discussing on someone else's writings. For example, the title of one of the studies was, For 'Physicians of the Soule': The Roles of 'Flight' and 'Hatred of Abomination' in  Thomas Wright's The Passions of the Minde in Generall' . (Firth-Godbehere, 2015).

## Detection/assessment of hatred

130 studies were identified that  discussed  assessment and  detection  of  hatred  by  various  means.  For example,  in  one  study  authors  integrate  social neuroscience findings with classic social psychology theories offering a framework to better understand how  intergroup  threat  can  lead  to  violence.  The role of moral disengagement, dehumanization, and  intergroup  schadenfreude  in  this  process  are discussed,  together  with  their  underlying  neural mechanisms (Lantos and Molenberghs, 2021).

## Addressing hatred

54 studies were identified that discussed the subject of  addressing  hatred.  For  example,  in  one  study the  author  argued  that  within  the  Filipino  psyche, the  notion  of  'Kapwa'  or  'shared  self '  can  be  an equivalent socio-normative ideal that can be utilized towards  not  just  countering  the  ill-effects  of  social discrimination  but  also  fostering  deep  communal and  group  solidarity  among  people,  regardless  of race, colour and ethnicity (Macaraan, 2021).

## Manifestation of hatred

52 studies qualified for the category of 'manifestation of  hatred' .  For  example,  Nagy et al (2021) reported that individuals who self-injure often report doing so in order to punish the self or express self-hatred and self-criticism is associated with NSSI (Non suicidal self-injury).  Choi  (2021)  reported  that  hatred  can manifest  as  hate  crime  including  anti-Asian/antiChinese  sentiments  and  increased  discrimination due  to  the  COVID-19  Pandemic.  Choi's  paper  is titled `People look at me like I AM the virus': Fear, stigma,  and  discrimination  during  the  COVID-19 pandemic´. Mendes and Silva, (2020) reported that hatred may manifest as homicide of lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transvestites, transexuals, and transgender people.

Further discussion below contains the details of the findings and of the emerging themes from thematic analysis  that  was  carried  out  to  understand  the reasons  for  generation/development  of  hatred,  the primary aim of this systematic review.

## Generation of hatred

113 studies were identified that focused on exploring the generation of hatred. On reading the title  and  abstract  it  was  noted  that  the  authors  in these  studies  primarily  focused  on  understanding the reasons that lead to development of the hatred are.  Whether the reasons are internal, to the hater, or external, that one is exposed to. What focus the hateful mind-set may take i.e. whether the focus is towards oneself, towards an object, towards an event or towards another person or group. To understand the pertinent information, full text reading of each article was carried out and the required information was collected in the form of a table that is available at the end of this article (table 2).

Second, the study did not examine prior exposure to trauma, and thus it could not be controlled as a covariate. Third, as the data were derived from self- report measures, a well-acknowledged range of biases may have been introduced, caused by factors such as mood-dependent recall, forgetting, and social desirability. Fourth, we capitalized on a nonrepresentative, volunteer sample that may not accurately represent the study variables' rates of occurrence among combat veterans. | Specific cause of hating others: Morally injurious event                    |

(Online questionnaire) Authors report investigating the motivations ("ingroup love" and "outgroup hate") underlying individual participation in intergroup conflict between natural groups (fans of football clubs, supporters of political parties), by employing the Intergroup Prisoner's Dilemma Maximizing- Difference (IPD-MD) game. N=7 Americans self- | The study demonstrates that outgroup hate can also play an important role, depending on the degree of enmity between the groups, whether it involves imposing negative externalities or denying positive externalities, and whether conflict is morality-based.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Results show an overall reluctance to display outgroup hate by actively harming outgroup members, except when the outgroup was morality-based.

## Generation of Hatred

According to the information gained from analysis of these studies hatred is focused on some object/s. The victims  of  hatred  may  include  the  hater's  own self  or  that  of  others.  The  studies  also  throw  light on  the  reasons  that  may  lead  to  development  of hatred. These reasons can be internal i.e., how a hater interprets the information/stimuli that may lead to the generation of hatred, or, external i.e., how factors influencing/interacting with the hater may  lead to  hatred.  Below  we  present  the  themes  under  the respective headings.

## Targets of Hatred

Hatred can be directed inwards (self-hatred). It can be directed outwards for example directed towards other humans or towards inanimate objects.

## Sele-hatred

We found  that  people  can  develop  hatred  towards their own  selves  due  to the following reasons. The  themes  reported  by  medical  researchers  are mentioned in alphabetical order below.

## Attraction towards minors

It can develop due to being attracted towards children ['non-offending  paedophiles'  or 'minor  attracted persons'] (Stevens et al., 2019).

## Drugs use and sex working

It can  develop  due  to  being  in  the  hypothetical scenario of being infected with HIV/AIDS in future by sex workers who use drugs (Lau et al., 2017).

## Left behind children

Self-hatred, sadness, and fatigue can develop as part of depression in left-behind children (Li et al., 2021).

## Mental illness

It  can  develop  due  to  depression,  anxiety  or  stress (Kotera et al., 2021).

It can develop due to depression with suicidal intent (Borentain et al., 2020).

It  can  develop  in  those  suffering  from  borderline personality disorder (Mou et al., 2018)

## Negative life experiences

It can develop in those who are exposed to negative experiences  with  parents  and  peer  victimization (Xavier et al., 2016)

## Sexual abuse

It can develop due to being a victim of sexual abuse as a child (Collin-Vézina et al., 2021).

## Sexual abuse by sibling

It can develop in the victims of sexual abuse by their siblings (Tener and Dafna, 2021).

## Towards self-image

It  can develop due to a distorted self-image (JalaliFarahani, 2021) that itself can have multiple causes, for example, eating disorder and self-criticism (Mantilla, 2015) or bodyweight shame (Carter et al., 2021).

## Towards some aspect of self

Self-Hatred may be limited to one aspect of the self, for  example,  this  may  include  hatred  towards  the habit of smoking (Amato, 2021), proneness to crying (Millings, 2016) or the word 'obesity' if the subject is obese (Atkinson, 2016).

## Sele-perceived hatred

Victims  may  perceive  being  hated,  for  example, experiencing self-perceived hatred due to acculturation  stress  (Atteraya  and  Madhu,  2021, Iorga et al. 2020 and Shan et al., 2020).

## Hatred towards inanimate objects

According to these studies haters can develop hatred towards  inanimate  objects  or  events  for  several reasons.  They are mentioned in alphabetical order below.

## Brand

Hatred  can  develop  towards  business  brands  and market  products  (Husnain,  2021),  (Pantano  and Eleonora, 2021).

## Buildings

It  can develop towards asylums [mad houses] (Sidi and Leah, 2021).

## Historic event

Kumar and Raman (2019) report that a permanent scar  and  hatred  was  created  by  the  British  empire when British colonial rule ended in India in 1947.

## Machines

It can develop towards cars (Tonetto et al, 2016).

## Political bodies

It can develop towards political bodies (Camparo et al., 2021).

## Vegetables

It can develop towards vegetables as a dietary option (Leak et al., 2017), (Tao et al, 2016).

## Reasons for hating other humans

The  studies  highlight  several  reasons  why  haters develop hatred towards other people. The emerging themes are organised below in alphabetical order.

## Academic performance

People may hate others on the basis of their academic performance (Shan et al., 2020).

## Addictions

People may be hated if If they differ in ideology from the  majority  (Bélanger,  2021).  If  they  are  Muslims (Hackett  et  al., 2020).  If they  are  non-Muslims (Fanani et al., 2020). If they are exposed to arsenic in the Ganges River (Chakraborti et al., 2018). If one's faith is seen as societal threat (Hackett et al., 2020).

If  they  are  persuaded  to  hatred  using  grounds  of ['nature of situation' , the 'authority appeal' , the 'duty' , the 'logical empirical' and the 'moral appeal'] (Fanani et al., 2020). If they are exposed to morally injurious events (Schwartz, 2021).

## Social issues

People  may  develop  hatred  if  they  are  exposed to  social  prejudice  (Hoskin  and  Rhea,  2020).  If they  are  exposed  to  the  practice  of  propagation  of moral  values  oriented  around  group  preservation [Prejudice] (Hoover, 2021).

## Others

Other people may be hated if they were perpetrators of childhood  physical  or  sexual  abuse  or  both towards victim (Collin-Vézina et al.,  2021).  If  they are  considered an outgroup for any reason (Weisel et  al.,  2015).  If  they  have  certain  types  of  lifestyles or routine activities (McNeeley et al., 2018). If they exhibit social disorganisation (McNeeley et al., 2018). If  they  are  hypocrites (Jordan et al., 2017).  If they are  part  of  a  community  that  carried  out  terrorist attacks  (Álvarez  and  Fabian,  2020).  If  they  have been  discussed  in  sensitive  topics  (Racism,  IsraelPalestine or War and Conflict) on social media news stories (Salminen et al., 2020).

If they  are  violent  (Blanco  et  al.,  2020).  People may  develop  hatred  if  they  are  exposed  to  spread of  populist  rhetoric  through  humour  (Sakki  and Jari,  2021).  If  they  are  exposed  to  police  brutality (Martinez-Cola et al., 2018). If they are exposed to violence  (Babvey  et  al.,  2021).  If  they  are  exposed to  economic  downturn  [recession]  (Bianchi  et  al., 2018).  If  they  are  exposed  to  'othering  practices' for example, deep-seated stereotyping of a group of people  (Li  et  al.,  2021).If  they  are  exposed  to  hate speech  for  any  reason  (Mendelsohn  et  al.,  2021). If they  are being  physically  or  sexually  abused by  someone  (Tener  and  Dafna,  2021).  If  they  are stigmatised for any reason (Xu et al., 2021).

## Internal reasons for development of hatre

The medical researchers found the following internal psychological, emotional and other relevant reasons that lead to development of hatred. They are described in alphabetical order below.

## Attitudes

Ability to express emotions (Tamir et al., 2017)

Prejudice (Hoover, 2021)

## Cognitions

Ideological obsession and perceived social injustice (Bélanger and Jocelyn, 2021).

Dehumanisation the other person or group (Kramer et al., 2021), (Mendelsohn et al., 2021), (Simpson and Robert, 2015), (Stern and Alexandra, 2021)

Pathological worrying (Pace et al., 2018).

Learning following memory consolidation, reconsolidation, and  repeated reinforcements or strengthening over time, resulting in a phenomenon called mental  representation  block  (Tobore  and Tobore, 2021).

Constant  appraisal  of  body  image  or  body  weight (Mantilla, and Andreas, 2015).

## Emotions

Because  people  want  to  experience  it  as  a  part  of their emotions (Tamir et al., 2017).

Because  someone/something  generates  disgust  in hater. (Matsumoto et al., 2017)

Impulsivity  and  internalizing  symptoms  in  case  of online hate offending (Kaakinen, 2020).

Reliance on in-group stereotypes [i.e., selfstereotype] (Kaakinen et al., 2020).

Development of combination of emotions of anger, contempt, and disgust [ANCODI] (Matsumoto et al., 2017).

## Feelings

Complete absence of love for someone or something (Bisagni, 2020).

Having  mixed  feelings  of  love  and  hatred  towards someone (Perelberg and Rosine, 2016).

Having stronger feelings of love in the past towards the one who is hated (Jin et al., 2017).

## Individual motivation

Individually  motivated  offenders  including  'news junkies, ' 'Bollywood  fanatics, '  and  'lone-wolves' who  do  not characteristically engage in direct targeted attacks against a single person but express hatred towards women of influence on social media for example doing hateful Tweets [through the online platform called Twitter] (Kumar, et al 2021).

## Perceptions

Perception of someone (whether self or others) as an

excessive load/burden due to the care-needs that one has (Horta and Ana, 2016).

Because someone sends false signals to hater's brain due to their hypocrisy. (Jordan et al., 2017)

## Others

Oedipal-like hatred (Wang et al., 2016).

Identity saving (Jaccard et al., 2021).

Development of a digital reality that is different from true reality (Kravis and Nathan, 2017).

Experiencing  moral  disengagement  (Blanco  et  al., 2020).

## DISCUSSION

I learnt that it is difficult to categorise the reasons for development of hatred in the form of any simplified categories. The  above  described  organisation of results is data driven and it is one of the pragmatic ways  in  which  I  was  able  to  present  the  findings. The major themes that were identified on thematic analysis  of  113  studies  included  targets  of  hatred, reasons for development of self-hatred, self-perceived hatred, reasons of hatred towards other humans and internal reasons for development of hatred. Medical researchers all over the world are obviously working in varied environments, cultures, circumstances and  have  unique  personal  and  academic  interests. However, it appears that regardless of the circumstances or the background they all appreciate that  hatred  and  hateful  mind-sets  exist  and  that efforts  are  needed  to  understand  various  aspects of hatred. From a medical and psychiatric point of view, they seem to make use of scientific approaches like psychological, psychopathological, neurological, neurobiological  and  physiological  approaches  etc. to understand the subject matter.  Among targets of hatred, the medical researchers are keen to explore the reasons for self-hatred too. Exploration of self-hatred is useful especially in understanding its development in depressive illness that may lead to subsequent selfharm and even suicide. Hatred is also reported to have developed  towards  inanimate  objects  or  historical events. It can be a person's inner thoughts, feelings, emotions,  interpretations,  approaches  or  attitudes that  can  lead  to  the  development  of  this  mind-set. Or it can be external reasons, for example, the kind of  environment,  peer  group,  background,  culture, economic situation or society that one is exposed to.

One major reason that leads to the development of hatred that stands out across studies is the intolerance towards the difference that others may present with, namely, difference in race, in ethnicity, gender, sexual preferences, religion, ideology, regional background, status of illness, personal habits or age are some of the recurrent themes that are reported. With regards to environmental factors, and given the time of crosssectional data collection, the importance of online/ virtual  environments  and  practices  are  highlighted across studies. During the COVID pandemic when real  life  contact  was  decreased  and  online  virtual interactions increased significantly, researchers had the opportunity to study the patterns and behaviours that led to the development of hateful behaviours and mind-sets in the virtual world, especially on virtual social media platforms.

It  appears  that  the  findings  of  this  review  are  in keeping with the findings that others have quoted on various  platforms.  For  example  the  online  website titled 'Understanding and overcoming hate' (https:// www.overcominghateportal.org) offers a list of multiple categories and kinds of hatred. According to this website Every-Day Hate includes peer rejection, bullying, mocking,  teasing,  social  exclusion  and ostracism.  Discriminative-Hate  can  be  carried  out on  the  basis  of  gender,  sexual  orientation,  gender identity, ethnicity, nationality, family heritage, socioeconomic status (class), regional location, party  affiliation,  looks,  hair  length,  clothes,  body type, disability, weight, and age. Hate on the basis of Dogmatic Beliefs (isms) is carried out on the grounds of ideologies, nationalism, exceptionalism, manifest destiny,  fundamentalism,  literalism,  millennialism, and  McCarthyism.    Stereotyping  (caricature)  type hatred manifests as stigmatizing, scapegoating, attribution, or projection. Prejudice-Racism-Bigotry like hatred manifests as supremacy, aversive racism, and chauvinism. Xenophobia manifests as tribalism, anti-immigrant, nativitism and ethnocentrism. Hate  Groups  and  Extremism  manifests  as  coercive cults, white supremacy groups, militia groups, neo-Nazi/far  right,  patriot  movement,  right  wing populism, gun groups, jihadist revolutionaries and the John Birch society (American ultraconservative, farright, radical right political advocacy group). There are  a  further  five  types  of  hatred  that  are  classified under  the  common  heading  of  social  injustice. Among these manifestations of InstitutionalDiscrimination include disenfranchisement, segregation, eugenics, apartheid, forced sterilization, racial  quotas,  racial  profiling,  caste  systems  and

state-sponsored pogroms.  The  manifestations of Collective-Rage  include  group-activated  violence, (hazing,  wilding,  gang  rape,  riots),  (lynch  mobs; vigilante justice), (ethnic  violence,  hate  crimes), mass  hysteria  leading  to  massacres  (i.e.,  Rwanda Genocide, witch trials), terrorist acts, suicide bombings  and  witch  hunts.  The  manifestation  of Abuse  of  Power  includes  death  squads,  rebel  and state-run  paramilitary,  mercenary  violence,  police brutality, secret  police,  rendition,  denial  of  civil liberties and rights and torture.  Oppression like hate manifests as autocratic authoritarian regimes, forced collectivization, fascism, theocracy, kleptocracy, oligarchy  and  plutocracy.  And  finally,  the  Extreme Cruelty on Mass Scale manifests as deliberate annihilation, atrocities, torture, eliminationism, massacres,  human  trafficking,  war  crimes,  crimes against humanity and genocide.

Comparing  the  findings  of  this  review  with  the categories  appearing on the website it appears that medical  researchers  are  reporting  many  of  these forms and categories of hatred. However, there are some  categories  like  self-hatred  and  self-perceived hatred  that are not mentioned on other forums but are an area of special interest for medical/mental-health researches. I did not come across any contradictions in  findings  of  this  review  to  the  findings  on  other forums, for example, in the above mentioned website. However  for  medical  researchers  the  biological, psychological  and  social  understandings  of  these matters appear more pertinent than understanding the political or historical aspects of the same. Nonetheless,  it  seems  that  medical  researchers  are neither oblivious nor blind towards the non-medical aspects  that  are  sometimes  an  integral  part  of  the bigger picture.

## Multiplicity of meanings

I found that the medical researchers are interested in several aspects of exploring hatred and use the same word for numerous meanings. It is nearly impossible to summarise them under discrete types. However, the emerging categories following analysis of initial coding of all included studies provide an opportunity to broadly understand that when medical researchers use the word hatred, then what are they aiming for? To fully understand the meaning of the same word, the background, broader aim of the study and context of  the  discussion  in  which  the  word  is  used  needs to  be  kept  in  mind.    Without  that,  any  conclusion drawn  about  the  meaning  of  hatred  may  lead  to a  spurious  outcome.  This  multiplicity  of  meaning finding agrees with numerous categories and kinds of  hatred  outlined  on  the  website  'Understanding and  overcoming  hate' . This systematic literature search provides the opportunity for us to appreciate a  variety  of  opinions  that  have  been  incorporated into the data pool across a longer duration of time. On one hand, the opinions of individual authors can be understood in detail, and on the other, a broader viewpoint emerges by combining the acquired knowledge from individual studies.

## Self-perceived hatred and Self-hatred

There were a couple of themes that were identified in medical literature and were not commonly reported in  other  sources.  One  of  these  themes  was  that  of self-perceived hatred. For example,  studies carried out by Atteraya et al., (2021) and Shan et al., (2020) on  students  belonging  to  a  variety  of  nationalities and ethnic backgrounds  reported that students can  perceive  hate  and  rejection  in  the  new  host culture that they join for their academic needs. This perception  appears  to  be  the  part  of  acculturation stress  that  they  experience.  This  is  a  unique  theme that suggests that hatred is more like a mindset that people can develop towards how they perceive they are  treated  and  what  they  internally  consider  what hatred is.

About  fourteen authors talk about self-hatred that  subjects  experience  for  a  variety  of  reasons. For example, some  recurrent emerging themes for  the  generation  of  self-hatred  are  in  the  context of  depressive  illness  and  in  the  context  of  repeat self-appraisal of body image. However, other than  that,  there  are  some  unique  reasons  for  the development  of  self-hatred  that  are  highlighted  by this  literature  review.  For  example,  Stevens  et  al., (2019) described that non-offending paedophiles are a group of individuals that are attracted to children but nevertheless suppress their attraction. They are  reported  to  develop  self-hatred  as  a  result  of experiencing such feelings. In case of self-hatred in children,  three  articles,  including  those  written  by Rhodes et al., (2017), Collin-Vézina et al., (2021) and Gijzen et al., (2021), highlight that it is the childhood physical abuse, childhood sexual abuse and childhood depression that leads to its development. Childhood  depression  appears  to  be  a  recurrent emerging  theme  that  may  lead  to  development  of self-hatred in children.

## Hating others

## Hating inanimate objects

It seems people can develop a hatred towards almost anything and anyone. This may include other objects and  other  people.  The  inanimate  objects  can  be hated  for  various  reasons  for  example,  Tonetto  et al., (2016), reported that people can develop hatred towards their  cars  after  an  appraisal.  Whether  it  is one's  body  image  that  is  appraised,  one's  own  self that is appraised  or if it is an inanimate possession, this  negative  appraisal  reinforces  the  generation  of hatred.  Some  children  reported  to  have  developed hatred towards vegetables as a dietary option, Leak et al., (2017).

## Events that lead to hatred of others

Hatred  tends  to  manifest  following  exposure  to some important and usually stressful personal or social event. For example, one repeatedly reported event that led to the generation of hatred was the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of 59 studies that dealt with  hatred  towards  others,  15  studies  reported the  development  of  hatred  due  to  COVID-19 pandemic. One reason for this obviously is that the cross-sectional data was collected when the world was still going through the impact of COVID-19, and it was an area of interest for medical researchers at the time. However, at the same time the  other  aspect  was  that  COVID-19  generated unprecedented stress, anxiety, vulnerability, scarcity  of  resources  and  increased  competition to receive the required help and health care from shared common resources.   For example, Erasmus reported  that  professionals  carrying  out  critical care triage can possibly develop hate towards elderly patients when work stresses are increased due to extra  work  generated  by  a  pandemic  (Erasmus, 2020).  Nishimura  et  al  (2020)  reported  that  the COVID-19  pandemic  caused  stigmatization  and hatred  against  Health  Care  Workers  (HCWs), which  led  to  increased  prevalence  of  burnout  in them. Hall et al., (2021) described experiences of those  AIDS  (HIV  positive)  patients  who  tested positive for COVID-19 too, the majority regarding their  HIV  diagnosis  as  having  a  more  profound impact on their lives compared to being affected by  the  pandemic  but  found  similarities  between COVID-19 stigma and HIV-related stigma. Other significant  events  reported  by  authors  that  led to  the  generation  of  hatred  were  the  UK  Brexit movement (Dalle et al., 2020) and US presidential elections of 2016 (Hackett et al., 2020).

## Cognitions that contribute towards hatred

Nine articles reported on the role that cognitions play  in  the  generation  of  hatred.  For  example, the role of Dehumanisation is discussed by four  different  authors  in  a  variety  of  scenarios (Kramer  et  al.,  2021)  (Mendelsohn  et  al.,  2021) (Simpson and Robert 2015) and (Stern and Alexandra,  2021).  Nonetheless,  in  addition  to that, medical  researchers have reported some other  cognitive  patterns  too  that  are  related  to hatred.  For  example.  Bélanger  (2021)  reported that  ideologically  obsessed  individuals  are  easily threatened  by  information  that  criticises  their ideology, which  in turn leads to hatred and violent retaliation. Tobore  and  Tobore  (2021) described  'Mental  representation  block'  (MRB). According to them, because of the brain's energy efficiency  evolutionary  adaptations,  all  learning following memory consolidation, reconsolidation, and repeated reinforcements or strengthening over time, results in a phenomenon called MRB. The  implications  of  this  block  include  cognitive biases  and  hatred  including  homophobia,  and transphobia.

## Attitudes, emotions, and sentiments that contribute towards hatred

In  addition  to  emotions,  medical  researchers  are interested  in  exploring  around  attitudes,  emotions, and  sentiments  too  that  lead  to  the  generation  of hatred.  For example, Cichocka et al (2017) described that after controlling for self-esteem, narcissistic selfevaluation was positively associated with the social dominance orientate, that leads to hatred of others. Gheorghiu  et  al  (2021)  reported  that  immigrants from low-status or poorer countries (Poland, India) are  more  likely  to  be  perceived  as  encroaching  on the  majority  group's  entitlements  than  those  from high-status or richer countries (Germany, Australia). Hoskin  and  Rhea  (2020)  reported  that  sources  of oppression underlying many forms of violence today (e.g., anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes, Incel attacks, sexual violence, transgender murders) are all symptoms of the same underlying social prejudice: femmephobia. Gervais  et  al  (2017)  reported  that  sentiments  are functional networks of attitudes and emotions. Distinct sentiments, including hate serve both bookkeeping  and  commitment  functions  within relationships.

## Social issues that lead to development of hatred and collective hatred

Medical researchers are interested in exploring and understanding  social  reasons  for  development  of hatred  too.  For  example,  Martin  and  Julia  (2020) who are teachers, carried out a survey on students marching for social justice. They reported that issues of  gender  equality  were  of  great  concern  to  the marchers,  in  particular,  issues  related  to  economic and  social  equity  for  example  including  inequality of  the  salary  among  genders.  Whilst  exploring  the reasons  for  the  development  of  collective  hatred, Sakki  et  al  (2021)  reported  that  it  was  the  spread of  populist  rhetoric  through  humour  that  led  to the  mobilization  of  collective  hatred,  encouraging a  sense  of  moral  superiority  in  groups  during  the US presidential  election  campaign  in  2016.  Whilst exploring  the  group-hatred,  Weisel  et  al  (2015) reported that outgroup hate can play an important role towards development of group hatred, depending on the degree of enmity between the groups, whether it involves imposing negative externalities or denying positive externalities, and whether conflict is morality-based.

## Psychoanalytic approaches towards understanding hatred

On the subject of hatred, medical researchers are interested in exploring the reasons for the generation of hatred employing psychodynamic and psychoanalytical approaches. Kravis and Nathan (2017) applied Kierkegaard's concept of 'levelling' to the dynamics of envy, particularly as they come into play  among  psychoanalysts  doing  clinical  analytic work. The `digital reality principle´ is introduced as a  way  of  conceptualizing  an  aspect  of  the  hatred  of thinking and certain envious responses to distinction. In another  example,  through  a  detailed analysis of  a  clinical  example,  Perelberg  and  Rosine  (2016) examines Bion's distinction between hysterical hallucinations and psychotic hallucinations and formulates their own hypothesis about the distinctions between  the  two.  Their  paper  suggests  that  whilst psychotic  hallucinations  express  a  conflict  between life  and  death,  hysterical  hallucinations  express  the conflict between love and hate.

## Role of online resources towards the generation of hatred

At least nine studies covered the role of a variety of online platforms that contribute to the development of hatred. It appears that the virtual world is unique in  several  ways  making  it  distinct  and  sometimes a dangerous  environment  that  may  lead  to  the development  of  hatred.  For  example,  Salminen  et al  (2020)  carried  out  the  classification  of  online news on a news channel and reported that hateful commenting,  also  known  as  'toxicity' ,  frequently takes place within news stories in social media when sensitive  topics  are  discussed.  Average  toxicity  of comments varies by topic. Selkie et al (2016) reported that  most  commonly  witnessed  online  behaviours that  lead  to  or  manifest  as  cyberbullying  included 'posting  degrading  comments  or  hate  speech'  and 'posting  explicit  or  unwanted  pictures' .  According to  Tynes  et  al  (2016),    the  reasons  for  online  hate activity,  includes  the  amount  of  time  spent  online, traditional, and online racial discrimination, and  adolescent  adjustment  (including  depressive symptoms,  anxiety,  and  externalizing  behaviours). Uyheng, and Kathleen (2020) collected online conversations around the COVID-19 pandemic and reported that 'Bot activity' was linked to higher hate in the US and the Philippines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of this review suggest that  virtual  world  scenarios  are  equally  capable  of contributing  towards  the  generation  and  spread  of hatred as real-world ones.

## Contributions from the current study

This  study  highlights  that  the  systematic  review of  medical  literature  could  be  a  good  source  to understand the variety of aspects of hatred. With the backdrop  of  existing  knowledge,  the  current  study brings a variety of approaches and opinions together that  suggest  that  medical  researchers  are  keen  to understand 'hatred' from different perspectives and points  of  view.  It  appears  that  some  are  interested in understanding the internal reasons at the level of cognitions,  attitudes,  sentiments,  and  personalised meanings of the subjects that develop hatred, whilst others are keen to explore the external reasons that may  lead  to  its  development.  The  findings  of  the review suggest that various different forms of hatred surfaced, or some already existing manifestations of hatred intensified following some significant global events. In addition, this study also highlights the latest online (virtual) reasons that lead to the development of  hatred  that  seem  to  have  some  similarities  with real  world  patterns  but  with  some  uniqueness  that are specific to online interactions only.

## CONCLUSIONS

The  word  `hatred´  is  used  in  medical  literature  in a  multiplicity  of  meanings  that  range  from  using it  in  its  literal  sense  to  describe  a  subtle  attitude such as a phobia-philia relationship, or to describe a  unique outcome that is generated as an interplay of several different kind  of factors. These  may include  cognitions,  behaviours,  social  interactions, attitudes,  sentiments,  developmental  backgrounds, psychodynamic interactions with others in real and virtual worlds etc. It may be ignored as another dayto-day attitude and paid little attention, for example, someone  using  the  word  hatred  to  describe  the disliking of his car. However, on the other hand, it may  manifest  as  negative  expressions,  for  example of  raging  dehumanising  contempt  and  disrespect that  may  be  accompanied  with  extreme  actions towards what is hated. It appears that hatred is more like  a  mind-set  that  people  can  develop  towards themselves,  towards  others  and  towards  inanimate objects or situations too. Fear, anger and disgust are primary emotions (that we are born with); human psyche is naturally prone to several inevitable cognitive  errors;  human  thought  is  subjected  to unavoidable logical fallacies; and human ego cannot avoid utilising  unhealthy  ego-defence mechanisms. Every child is born in a family and culture that has its own unique background and history. Therefore, it appears that we humans are prone to the generation of  the  hateful  mindset  as  an  unavoidable  outcome in  a  variety  of  scenarios.  It  seems  that  depending on the background of the person or the group, their environment  and  circumstances  and  the  intensity of  the  stress  that  one  is  exposed  to,  the  generation of  the  hateful  mind  set  will  vary.  There  are  several other factors that contribute towards its generation. Keeping  these generational patterns in view, it would be reasonable to say that an early  detection and  addressing  the  early  warning  signs  towards development  of  the  hateful mind-set  would  be helpful for ourselves and for others. As the word is used in several different meanings, the background information,  context  and  overall  scenario  of  the discussion needs to be kept in mind whilst attempting to draw any meanings about the use of hate/hatred in a verbal or written expression. In each case where the word `hatred´ is used, needs to be approached with epistemic  curiosity  and  in  some  instances,  it  may need detailed epistemic inquiry to fully comprehend the  meaning  of  this  word  in  any  given  expression. More similar kind of research would hopefully bring more insights into the subject with time.

## LIMITATIONS

This literature review took a cross-sectional approach for data collection at a specific point in time. There are multiple studies that are added to the same data base ever since the information was collected for this study and during the course of data interpretation, write up and publication. Choosing from the most recently added studies from 2015 onwards in PubMed was initially to keep the focus on contemporaneous studies. However, it was realised after the initial data was collected that even older studies were added at Pub Med. As the data was already collected, I decided to  mention  this  pitfall  in  the  limitations  section rather than changing the entire research strategy and carry out data collection again.

## MOTIVATION AND DEDICATION

This  study  is  dedicated  to  Mrs  Talat  Afzaal,  my primary school (Divisional Public School Faisalabad, Pakistan)  teacher  who  lost  her  life  in  a  terrorist attack in London, Ontario, Canada on 6 th June 2021. Mrs Afzaal was 72 years old.  The motivation for this study came to reflect on the reasons that go through the mind of people who perform acts of hatred, like terrorism.  The  Canadian  government  immediately declared  the  incidence  as  an  act  of  Islamophobia (Jiwani, 2022). It appears  that Mrs  Afzaal  and three of her family members were apparently killed because  of  the  attire  that  they  were  wearing.  If Nathaniel Veltman had had the opportunity to meet Mrs.  Afzaal,  I  am  sure  he  would  have  appreciated that  she  was  an  unsuitable  stereotyped  candidate except for her attire. Following a road traffic accident and having undergone plastic surgery it was difficult for her to face the society with the scars on her face, though she never gave up fulfilling her professional responsibilities. In the early 1980s culture of Faisalabad (Pakistan), when a military dictator had imposed martial law rules restricting the freedom of women, it was not easy for a woman to work as a schoolteacher. It was difficult for any family to face the  conservative  community  in  that  culture  where the woman of the house works, and the family relies on  her  wage.    She  herself  was  educated,  and  she prepared  her  children  to  choose  higher  education. She was a disciplinarian and would insist on rules to be followed as an essential virtue whilst teaching us in the classroom. She was able to take the initiative in her sixties and embrace change to emigrate out of the country to a different culture. In order to understand more  about  the  social  circumstances  that  she  was

exposed to, I would refer to the life stories of Benazir Bhutto,  ex-prime  minister  of  Pakistan  who  herself was assassinated in a terror attack (Bhutto, 2014) and Malala  Yousufzai,  the  youngest  Nobel  Peace  Prize holder of Pakistani origin who was shot in head in a terror attack for advocating in favour of education of  young  girls  (Y ousafzai  and  McCormick,  2014). The narratives of these well-known Pakistani women frankly  cover  the  problems  and  challenges  that they faced in Pakistani society due to their gender. At  one  level,  it  feels  that  it  is  not  only  the  murder of  another  Asian  immigrant on the street, but it is also the murder of a dream of an independent, free, opinionated,  and  self-sufficient  Pakistani  woman; a  privilege  that  she  is  largely  denied  in  her  parent culture. Mrs  Afzaal apparently was striving to achieve this in her new host culture. It seems that her efforts  to  achieve  independence  and  betterment  in her quality of life and of her family's continued to the end of her days. Goodbye Mrs. Afzaal.
