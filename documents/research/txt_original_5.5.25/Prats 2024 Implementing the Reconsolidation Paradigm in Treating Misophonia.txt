## Abstract

Misophonic patients experience extreme sense of disgust when exposed to acoustic and/or visual triggers. In this longitudinal study, the reconsolidation paradigm was applied to treat 25 patients during a month. The findings reveal that reminders in a control  setting  did  not  improve  maladaptive  memories,  but  counterconditioning update ameliorated symptoms.

## 1. Introduction

'Memory is a way of holding onto the things you love, the things you are, the things you never want to lose' (Kevin Arnold), And in some instances, the things you need to update in order to change (Angel Prats)

Remembering our memories, even the darkest ones, makes us understand why we experience what we experience,  our  present,  and  who  we  are.  The  many  maladaptive  memories  become  the  origin  of psychiatric disorders and influence personality traits (Johnson et al., 2005). We can find these types of memories at the epicenter of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), phobias, and also in some dysregulated behaviors such as alcoholism and drug abuse (Milton &amp; Everitt, 2012). Among the many disorders affected by maladaptive memories, we find misophonia.

Misophonic patients experience extreme sense of disgust when exposed to acoustic and/or visual triggers.  The  most  common  triggers  are  those  related  to  oral  consumption  such  as  chewing, slurping, gum chewing, but there are others related to repetitions such as pen clicking, keyboard typing,  scraping  sounds  and  loud  breathing.  Being  near  such  triggering  sounds,  and  even  just watching them, causes misophonia patients to develop aversion symptoms such as anger, anxiety and in some extreme cases panic-like attacks (Wu et al, 2014; Schröder et al., 2015; Ferrer-Torres, et  al.,  2022).  Other  than  the  feeling  of  disgust,  patients  also  experience  muscle  tension  and/or physiological arousal (increased heartbeat, sweaty palms…) (Edelstein et al., 2013).

Due  to  the  scarcity  of  studies  on  misophonia  to  date,  there  has  not  been  definitive  evidence allowing for consensus as to whether it is a comorbidity found in other psychiatric disorders or if

it is a condition in of itself (Potgieter, et al., 2019). This issue impedes it to be added to the DSMV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition). In regards to its etiology, the most commonly used explanation for the origin of misophonia is a maladaptive conditioning. Misophonia is considered a conditioned response that was originally unconditioned but through association  with  a  negative  outcome  became  conditioned. Unfortunately, the little information available on misophonia makes it difficult to propose ideal diagnostic criteria, let alone methods of treatment. Several diagnostic tools have been hypothesized to accurately evaluate misophonic symptoms, but none has been completely validated, replicated and generalized (Potgieter, et al., 2019).  Several  clinical  cases  have  investigated  the  role  of  different  psychiatric  therapies  on remediating the aversive misophonic symptoms patients disclose. Among the most popular types of treatments implemented for misophonia we find Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with and without exposure therapy element, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and Dialectical Behavioral therapy (DBT). No treatment has been successful at completely correcting misophonia symptomatology; at best, some treatments have shown to temporarily reduce the symptoms, but with extreme variability (Mattson, et. al., 2023).

In another field of study with relatively the same years of existence as the term misophonia we find  reconsolidation  (both  getting  recognition  at  the  outset  of  the  21st  century).  A  molecular, anatomical,  and  cognitive  process  considered  to  be  the  paradigm  that  allows  for  updating memories (Hupbach et al., 2007; Schiller et al., 2010; Nader, 2015; Lee et al., 2017). This process in  which  a  reminder  of  a  maladaptive  memory  is  required  to  destabilize  a  prior  consolidated memory has been studied in its potential capacity to interfere and modify the valence of memories. Reconsolidation, which has been studied in both animal and human models, has shown to be able

to manipulate/update declarative, procedural and emotional memories through amnesic agents or by introducing additional information that competes with the original memory (Agren, 2014; Lee et al., 2017). It is in this application that reconsolidation is intended to be used as a mechanism through which maladaptive memories can be remediated. To this extent, several clinical trials have taken  place  in  improving  the  treatment  mechanisms  used  in  conditions  such  as  phobias, alcoholism, drug abuse and PTSD, among others (Gray &amp; Liotta, 2012; Das et al., 2015; Xue et al., 2015; Bjorkstrand et al., 2016; Dunbar &amp; Taylor, 2017; Vermes et al., 2020).

Both  reconsolidation  and  misophonia  are  relatively  new  topics  with  many  questions  to  be answered. The main objective of this research is to shed some light on misophonia while also analyzing  the  role  reconsolidation  could  have  as  a  potential  treatment  mechanism.  The  study undertaken in this master thesis is part of a larger research project being carried out at Mt Sinai Hospital (Icahn School of Medicine) under the direction of Dr. Daniela Schiller, who has granted us access to the data. This project (NCT05928689) is funded through The Misophonia Research Fund as a part of the REAM Foundation, a private family foundation. To the best of our knowledge the implementation of reconsolidation mechanisms in a misophonia sample is novel and has not been attempted before.

In sum, in this master thesis I hypothesized that participants undergoing a reminder of their trigger prior  to  receiving  counterconditioning  (i.e.,  reconsolidation  updating)  will  show  a  significant reduction  of  their  aversive  responses  compared  to  misophonic  participants  that  do  not  get  a reminder.  In  this  way,  we  hope  to  address  whether  reconsolidation  therapy  in  the  form  of counterconditioning is sufficient in reducing aversion to misophonic triggers.

## 2. Misophonia

This chapter will introduce the phenomenon of misophonia, a proposed condition that has a great impact on the daily lives of the people that suffer from it. I will explain its symptoms, the relevant findings, and issues in the study of misophonia. By synthesizing the literature of this understudied condition, I hope to contribute to a more holistic perspective that will hopefully lead the reader to better understand misophonia, its implications for clinical practice, and its research opportunities.

Misophonia is a relatively new condition coined by Jasterboff in 2001 (Jasterboff, 2001). Even though the original term was intended to be 'An abnormally strong reaction occurring to a sound with specific pattern and/or meaning to an individual '' (Jasterboff &amp; Jasterboff, 2014), it is the literal Greek/Latin translation that receives the most popularity miso = hate, of the phonia = sound (Potgieter et al., 2019).

People suffering from this condition are characterized as experiencing disproportionately extreme aversion to certain sounds (triggers) differently from the general population. The triggers tend to be diverse and multiple for each individual, the most common are chewing, slurping, lip smacking, sniffling,  screeching,  and  throat  clearing.  To  these  individuals,  being  exposed  to  the  triggers, activates both limbic and autonomic systems causing them to experience strong responses related to feelings of anxiety, disgust, and anger (Potgieter et al., 2019). Misophonia is different from Hyperacusis- an auditory condition in which noise is perceived to be too loud, to the point that it can cause discomfort and pain- in that the volume of the triggering sound is not related to the outcome (Jasterboff &amp; Jasterboff, 2014). To misophonic patients, even just observing an individual doing the activity related to the trigger without sound is sufficient to trigger them. This has been

considered  one  of  the  trademarks  of  misophonia.  This  misokinesia  (hatred  of  movementreferring to the image of the movement related to trigger) element makes misophonic patients aversive to socialize, eat with others and, in extreme cases, cause the patient to become incapable to attend classes or go to work due the fear of being triggered (Swedo et al., 2022). Patients with misophonia tend to report inability to focus after being triggered, hyperfixation on the triggering individual, and hypervigilance of perceived follow up triggers (Potgieter et al., 2018). Interestingly, misophonic patients tend to deem misophonic triggers as stronger when the sounds are produced by an individual close to them such as a family member or a partner (Bernstein et al., 2013). Even though the triggers are stronger when coming from their immediate social network, the sounds that are emitted by the patients themselves do not become triggering. Another common trademark  experienced  in  misophonia  patients  is  the  presence  of  involuntary  physiological movements  such  as  clenching  teeth,  keratosis  pilaris  (chicken  skin)  or  jerk  movements  when exposed to the patients' triggers (Schröder et al., 2018; Eijsker et al., 2021).

The novelty of misophonia raises a plethora of unanswered questions. What is its prevalence, how does it come to be, who is affected, how may we treat it and many more questions. What is known though is that misophonia is a complex response experienced due to sensory information that arises from a specific context with varying valence. To date, research has delved into the prevalence of misophonia and out of the few studies, there is discrepancy. Wu et al. (2014) found that out of 483 American undergraduate students, 20% reported significant misophonia impairment symptoms. In contrast, a similar study performed in China found that 20% of 415 students declared experiencing sound sensitivity 'often' or 'always', but only 6% of these had significant misophonia impairment (Zhou et al., 2017). These findings not only lead to the conclusion that there is a lack of consensus

in misophonia, but also that it may be more prevalent in specific populations. Through case study reports, the scientific community has estimated that even though misophonia symptoms tend to appear at different time spans, the patients report experiencing their first anger, disgust, and anxiety symptoms related to their triggers at early stages of development. Estimations to date postulate that on average misophonic symptoms appear around the age of 12 (Dozier, 2015; Jager et al, 2020).

In regards to how misophonia may have come to be, plenty of hypotheses have emerged, but no consensus has been reached. Some researchers have tried to explain the misophonia inception as rooted in a temporary hearing loss experienced by patients at childhood, which may have led the patient to develop higher sensitivity to specific sounds (Aazh et al., 2022). Others have suggested that the origin of misophonia may be due to the anatomical proximity between the auditory cortex with the Anterior Insular Cortex, which led the patients to create spurious associations similar to those experienced by synesthesia patients (e.g., hear-color, taste-word) (Edelstein et al., 2013). To date though, the first and most prevalent explanation for misophonia is believed to be due to a simple conditioned response-a classic Pavlovian conditioning (Dozier et al., 2023).

According  to  this  hypothesis,  an  unconditioned  stimulus  (trigger)  became  associated  with  an unpleasant experience which caused an unconditioned response (anger, disgust). Over time, the trigger becomes conditioned and consolidated; thus, every time the trigger is present, the patient experiences the now conditioned response: anger, disgust, as well as physiological responses.

Even though very limited studies have been done in the field of misophonia due to its novelty and the lack of awareness, some studies have brought forward that a genetic component may also be at play (Brout et al., 2018; Sanchez &amp; Silva et al., 2018). Through case studies, researchers have reported that it is habitual to find a parent or a sibling of a misophonic patient to also exhibit misophonic symptoms. A case study describes a report of 15 individuals from the same family in Brazil, in which all individuals suffer from misophonia (Sanchez &amp; Silva et al., 2018). Even though this poses some evidence for misophonia to be considered a psychiatric condition, more studies will need to be carried out to draw significant conclusions.

Misophonic  patients  also  tend  to  suffer  additional  psychiatric  issues,  making  it  difficult  to characterize misophonia alone. Misophonic patients tend to report having other disorders such as post traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, as well as major depressive disorder (Erfanian et al., 2017; Quek et al., 2018). Because misophonia is often comorbid with other disorders, this has brought out questions of whether misophonia is a symptom  or  a  condition  in  of  itself.  Something  which  has  some  members  of  the  Psychiatry community in dissent- genetic condition or symptom of disorders?.

Researchers have tried to characterize misophonia as a condition since Schröder, Volnik &amp; Denys (2013) brought forward the diagnostic criteria to characterize misophonia. Although it has not been accepted into the DSM-V, researchers have tried to find anatomical and functional differences to single out misophonia and to make a claim of it being a condition. To do so, researchers have relied  on  physiological  and  neuroimaging  techniques  such  as  galvanic  skin  response  (GSR), electroencephalograms (EEG) and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).

In the field of physiological responses, researchers such as Kumar et al. (2017) have studied the physiological reactivity experienced by misophonic patients. In this study, Kumar et al. analyzed the skin reactivity of misophonic patients and healthy controls. The results showed that misophonia patients  experience  higher  galvanic  skin  responses  to  auditory  stimuli  than  healthy  controls, suggesting that there is a dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system where patients experience high sympathetic arousal while potentially reducing the parasympathetic system response. In the field of neuroimaging, implementing EEG imagery studies, Schröder et al. (2014), showed that misophonia patients have reduced mean amplitude of the auditory N1 (part of the event related potential-the  electric  response  to  a  specific  event),  which  indicates  differences  in  the  early processing (attention and detection) of auditory stimuli. This suggests that misophonic patients are unable to filtrate or habituate to the incoming sounds. These findings led Schröder et al. (2014) to propose that being unable to process the information and habituate to the trigger may result in hypersensitivity  to  the  specific  stimuli,  which  leads  to  increased  physiological  and  emotional responses compared to controls. Although this correlation is a potential explanation, further studies are needed to corroborate the pattern and the explanation.

In relation to fMRI studies, the few studies completed to date have postulated that Misophonia patients  have  aberrant  neural  responses  compared  to  control  groups.  Studies  in  this  field  have found that misophonic patients exhibit hyperactivation of the bilateral auditory cortex with the left amygdala (Giorgi, 2015), increased activity  in  the  auditory  cortex  (Schröder  et  al.,  2015)  and disrupted  functioning  of  the  connection  between  anterior  insular  cortex  and  superior  temporal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posteromedial cortex, hippocampus and amygdala (Kumar

et al., 2017). In the most recent work in this field, undertaken by Eijsker et al. (2021), in which misophonic patients underwent fMRI with their eyes closed, it was found that patients had greater volume  of  gray  matter  compared  to  controls,  specifically  in  the  right  amygdala;  altered connectivity between the amygdalae and the cerebellum; and greater connectivity within lateral occipital cortices and fusiform gyri found in the ventral attention network.

Findings  such  as  these  bring  forward  that  both  functional  and  anatomical  abnormalities  are implicated in misophonia. These reports explain why misophonic patients report feeling anxiety, anger, and discomfort upon being triggered, and are predisposed to hyperawareness. Corroboration of these findings needs to be done in order to verify these findings and give strength to the claim of misophonia being a singular condition.

When it comes to treatment, the lack of consensus and awareness on misophonia has impeded the development  and  research  of  potential  therapeutic  interventions.  Not  many  of  the  established therapeutic  techniques  have  proven  efficient  in  treating  these  patients.  Cognitive  behavioral therapy through exposure therapy, as a second-generation mechanism, has shown the best promise to  date  (Mattson  et  al.,  2023).  The  scarcity  of  clinical  reports  in  this  field,  limits  any  definite conclusions  on  best  therapeutic  practice.  Thus,  in  this  thesis,  I  hope  to  shed  some  light  on mechanisms that may make misophonia treatment more efficient.

## 3. Reconsolidation

In this chapter, I will review the literature of reconsolidation. I will bring forward its hypothesized role,  the  application  it  has  in  treating  maladaptive  memories  that  are  at  the  center  of  many disorders, and argue the benefit it could have in treating misophonia patients.

To  begin, we  must  first understand consolidation since reconsolidation depends on it. Consolidation is the required period of stabilization needed for acquiring new memories. This is demonstrated in part by the impairment found in interruptions of consolidation due to amnesic treatments or new learning occurring soon after initial learning (McGaugh, 2000). Similar to the evidence  that  demonstrates  consolidation,  there  is  evidence  suggesting  the  existence  of  postretrieval restabilization. In this case, evidence suggests that previously consolidated memory can be destabilized if amnesic treatment or new learning happens after a memory is retrieved (Nader, 2000; Nader, 2015; Lee et al., 2017). This destabilization has given rise to the concept of postretrieval  reconsolidation,  where  the  memory  that  has  been  retrieved  becomes  destabilized  and requires reconsolidation in order to become stabilized once more.

Several memory systems have been demonstrated to be capable of modification. Studies indicate that declarative, procedural, and emotional memories have the potential to be manipulated through the reconsolidation paradigm (Hupbach, 2007; Monfils et al., 2009; Schiller et al., 2010; Agren, 2014; Scully et al., 2016).  Its potential to treat maladaptive memories are being put to the test nowadays  and  the  thought  that  memories  can  only  be  consolidated  once  has  decreased  in popularity.

The field of reconsolidation, as mentioned before, works on the premises that memories upon being retrieved and expressed enter a malleable state where one can manipulate them by either reducing (amnesic) or increasing the emotional valence attributed to them (Lee et al., 2017; Deng et  al.,  2023).  This  change  in  emotional  valence  can  be  obtained  by  either  incorporating  new experiences, psychological and physiological changes, and or through interventions (both invasive and non invasive) (Deng et al., 2023). The mechanisms through which this takes place are complex and involve molecular, cellular and synaptic plasticity processes (Lee et al., 2017).

Regarding  the  functionality  of  reconsolidation,  it  has  been  hypothesized  that  it  allows  us  the capacity to update our memories with new information (Hupbach et al., 2007). This is supported by the bidirectional nature of reconsolidation. Memories from our past can be strengthened or weakened by the addition of new information. Thus, what was once traumatic may fade away thanks to prolonged updating in reconsolidation or, on the other hand, it can worsen the emotional valence one had about its trauma. Experimental studies trying to test this hypothesis have delved into updating these maladaptive memories in order to change the outcomes they cause. Some of the more significant studies to date have delved in the application of reconsolidation in PTSD, phobias and drug use.

In a clinical study where reconsolidation mechanisms were used to treat heroin addicts, those who underwent a reminder of the drug (video clip) and received extinction training (repeated exposure to heroin cues) had lower craving for the drug 6 months after (Xue et al., 2012). This is in contrast to the other groups in the study which did not get drug reminders or that took a 6h break before extinction  training  (i.e.,  outside  the  reconsolidation  window).  Findings  in  this  study  imply  the efficacy the reconsolidation may have in treating drug disorders and the role it can play for relapse

prevention.  In  another  study  using  alcohol-related  memory  manipulation,  alcoholics  that  were presented with actual alcohol followed by counterconditioning (alcohol cue paired with disgusting image) showed a perceived reduction of attentional bias, cravings upon being cued, and lower liking ratings (Das et al., 2015). Other groups with different conditions (drank alcohol or drank non alcoholic drinks) were less effective, which indicates that there is a specific type of violation needed to destabilize the memory alcoholics have (Das et al., 2015). This indicates that the type of reminder is important in activating the memory and that counterconditioning is effective at mitigating some of the adverse effects maladaptive memories have.

In  another  pilot  study,  a  small  sample  of  PTSD  patients  underwent  Rewind  Technique,  a reconsolidation  protocol  where  the  patients  are  cued  to  remember  their  traumatic  events  and imagine it as if it were a movie (Gray et al., 2012). The majority of the participants no longer met criteria for PTSD diagnosis after the intervention. Replication of this is still required to verify the efficacy of the Rewind Technique in reducing PTSD, but this study showcases the applicability of reconsolidation  mechanisms.  In  regards  to  reconsolidation  used  in  clinical  studies  of  phobia treatments, retrieval-extinction protocols show mixed results when targeting a sample population with arachnophobia (Shiban et al., 2015). In Shiban et al. (2015), although retrieval-extinction efficiency  was  not  clear  and  protocol  optimization  is  required,  the  post-retrieval  exposure  to spiders significantly decreased. Thus, the participants suffering arachnophobia may have benefited from reconsolidation updating. In a separate study, also focused on phobias, Agren et al. (2017) demonstrated  that  reminders  in  an  in  vivo  or  imaginary  extinction  protocol  disrupted  the reconsolidation process regardless of the type of reminder.

Figure 1. The reconsolidation process.

Once a memory is being reactivated it destabilizes and must begin the process of reconsolidation (see figure#).. If we implement updating via extinction, counterconditioning, or interference, we can change the emotional valence that image has over the person. Extinction would be through repetitive exposition of the person to a trigger image without experiencing side effects (e.g., a dog collar  is  not  a  dangerous  dog).  Counterconditioning  would  be  experiencing  a  gain  or  loss associated with the triggering image (e.g., monetary compensation). Another updating mechanism for  reconsolidation  would  be  interference,  where  one  information  competes  with  the  other  to consolidate. Once this additional information is associated with the original memory it becomes reconsolidated.  The  memory  which  is  now  updated  with  the  new  information  could  be  more accentuated thanks to having gone through enhancing mechanisms or less accentuated through amnesic mechanisms.

Through  experiments  using  animal  and  human  models,  scientists  have  estimated  that  the reconsolidation  period  takes  about  6  hours  (Lee  et  al.,  2017).  That  is,  from  the  moment  the reminder is given, the memory is labile for the first 6h, once the period has passed the memory is consolidated and no updates are able to modify it.

The elements discussed in this section: the reconsolidation paradigm, the update mechanisms, prior findings, and the timeframe required for consolidation are the cornerstones from which we develop our study. Therefore in this thesis, I will analyze the reconsolidation paradigm with the updating mechanism of counterconditioning in the hope of changing the emotional valence misophonia patients experience.

## 4.  Study

This Master's thesis is based on a subsection of a larger study directed by Dr Daniela Schiller taking  place  at  Mt  Sinai  Icahn  School  of  Medicine  (NCT05928689)  funded  through  The Misophonia Research Fund as a part of the REAM Foundation, a private family foundation. Due to the nature of the study and the fact that it is ongoing, only 2 out of 5 groups it is composed of are being analyzed in this work. The original population will be introduced in the sections below to explain the onboarding process.

## 4.1 Participants

In this study, a total of 25 participants who were 'diagnosed' or self-identified as misophonic, between the ages of 18 - 55, were recruited through advertisements in social media platforms, pool samples of SoQuiet members (a platform dedicated to people with Misophonia, where they can gather information, resources and apply for research grants) and posters around New York City. Out of the initial pool of 284 prospective participants who expressed interest in our study,  42.4% (123) were deemed not eligible for our study. Eligible criteria were established for participants to

express  misophonia  triggers  and  some  reported  distress  when  confronted  with  a  trigger  (see appendix # for exclusion criteria). An additional approximately 10% of the remaining participants did not consent to have their data stored in our system. Lastly, those participants who did not successfully score above threshold in 3 misophonia questionnaires out of 4 were also dropped (15%). We implemented these 4 questionnaires due to no consensus in the field regarding the psychometric properties of each of the individual questionnaires, including reliability or validity and generalizability (Roshenthal et al., 2021). Following the completion of the questionnaire, 20% more  participants  dropped  from  the  study  due  to  un-responsiveness,  inability  to  commute  or personal reasons.

The composition of our remaining 84 participants (30%) was divided among the 5 groups of the larger study, taking into account the individual's preference. At the time that this thesis was being written 25 participants fell under the groups analyzed.

Table 1.  Summarizing the descriptive data of the sample.

Demographics of the sample (see table 1) were primarily composed of caucasian females (86%) averaging  the  age  of  35.09  (SD=10.45).  Regarding  our  sample  socioeconomic  attributes,  the majority  of  our  participants  (47%)  held  a  college  degree  and  33%  had  completed  graduate programs (Master, PhD). The average income of our sample reported having an income between $75,000 and $100,000 (SD =2.3). Participants also described on average experiencing their first misophonia triggers at 11 years of age (SD=4.8), this finding is closely related to that reported in other studies where it is estimated to be at 12 years of age (Dozier, 2015; Potgieter, et al., 2013).

## 4.2 Apparatus and Materials

## Surveys and questionnaires

Our  study  implemented  a  battery  of  surveys  and  questionnaires  through  REDCap  (Research Electronic Data Capture) online software (REDCap, 2023). This allowed us to track the entirety of the participants task completions, send surveys as well as collect survey data. The exclusion criteria  for  participating  in  our  study  was  established  as  passing  (scoring  above  average)  in  a minimum of 3 of the following validated and reliable questionnaires:

## a) Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ) - (Score &lt; 18) See appendix 1

First misophonia assessment tool created by Marsha Johnson et al. (2013), designed to identify the degree misophonia affects the life of the patient. It is composed of 21 phrases the patient needs to rate  from  0  to  3.  MAQ  is  centered  around  noise  triggers,  and  does  not  account  for  visual implications.

## b) Misophonia Questionnaire from USF (MQ) - (Score &lt; 24) See appendix 2

The Misophonia Questionnaire, first published by Wu et al., 2014; from the University of South Florida, consists of 3 scales. MQ tries to identify the sensitivity (8 items), frequency of behavioral responses (11 items) and severity the patients have when exposed to their triggers.

## c) Amsterdam Misophonia Scale ( AMISO ) (Score &lt; 9) See appendix 3

This questionnaire, adapted from Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, assesses the level of interference  misophonia  causes  to  the  patients.  It  includes  the  word  trigger  to  encompass  any sounds,  sight,  touch  or  motion  considered  aggravating  to  the  patient.  AMS  is  an  18  item questionnaire that has been revised and developed by Schröder, Vulnik, and Denys (2013).

## d) Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (revised) (AMISOr) - (Score &lt; 18) See appendix 4

This questionnaire is a revision to AMISO undertaken by Schröder, Vulnik, van Loon and Denys in 2017. It was revised to improve the reliability and validity of AMISOS while making it more comprehensive.

To  establish  any  psychopathology  in  the  patients,  researchers  implemented  the  use  of  Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) (Sheehan et al., 1998). This allowed us to account for  diagnosis  of  Depression,  General  Anxiety,  Social  Anxiety,  Mania,  Panic  disorders,  PTSD, OCD, Substance use disorder, Schizoid or Delusional comorbidities.

## Approach Avoidance Task - (AA)

The misophonia triggers were short clips (30 seconds) of a person: wet chewing, gulping, slurping, sniffling or scraping; that had been used and validated in similar studies of misophonia by the

Davidenko  lab  at  Duke  University  (Samermit  et  al.,  2022).  Using  PsychoPi  the  videos  were embedded into a task for participants to be able to choose between watching the particular video they stated had triggered them the most or a static screen. Each video had a specific monetary compensation of $0, $0.2, $0.4,  $0.6,  $0.8  or  $1  and  responses  were  recorded  and  totaled  by PsychoPi Software. A total of 20 video events were recorded with a total compensation of $12 if participants watched the trigger video all the time. Response times and attention tasks were also embedded and recorded into this Psychopy task. The same task was also brought online through Pavlovia Software so that the participants could use it at the different follow up times throughout the study.

## Counterconditioning

A  counterconditioning  video  was  created  using  the  same  process  established  above  using PsychoPi. In this case the participants did not have an option to choose from, but got compensated ($4  for  each  trigger  video  and  $0  for  each  static  video)  as  a  conditional  stimulus.  The implementation of this task was intended to be used as the mechanism through which the emotional valence of the trigger could be updated. In doing so, the trigger was hoped to be associated with the positive valence of obtaining monetary compensation instead of the original feeling of anger, disgust or anxiety that the trigger had had.

## Analysis

The analysis of all the data collected was analyzed through JASP (version 0.16.1 JASP team, 2022).

## 4.3 Measures

Misophonia reactivity - the desire to not be exposed to a specific trigger in fear of the physical, emotional and psychological repercussions that arise from such triggers was measured through several parameters. Surveys and questionnaires (MAQ, MQ, AMISOS and AMISOSr) that are designed to analyze misophonia reactivity were implemented at different periods of time for self declared statuses of misophonia reaction. Through the analysis of reaction changes we hoped to see  a  trend  dependent  on  the  treatment  the  participant  underwent.  Another  measurement  of misophonia  reactivity  is  the  scores  each  participant  obtained  in  their  follow  up  Approach Avoidance task compared to their initial score.

Reconsolidation - the process through which memories can be recalled, and re-stored after being modified into stabilized long-term memories. The study analyzed this process by having reminders of  the  participant  triggers  (11  sec  video)  or  control  reminders  (control  -  static  video)  prior  to intervention and distraction tasks. Approach Avoidance task in this parameter also functions as a reconsolidation measurement. Since, the participants that undergo reminder are expected to have gone through an update memory the Approach Avoidance task is expected to be a proper indicator of the evolution and power reconsolidation had on the participants.

## 4.4 Procedure

Once participants showed interest in participating in the study, they received a phone call from the research  team.  This  preliminary  phone  screen  served  as  an  introduction  to  the  study,  where researchers explained the process step by step, asked them questions to determine their eligibility as well as determined the test subgroup they may be eligible for. After determining what subgroup the participants pertained to, they underwent a zoom call where they gave their consent. During

this  time,  the  participant  granted  researchers  permission  to  record  the  zoom  call  while  they performed the MINI diagnostic questionnaire. The purpose of the MINI and the recording was explained  to  the  participant  as  being  needed  to  know  if  they  had  any  potential  psychological condition  that  could  explain  their  Misophonia,  as  well  as  getting  validated  opinion  from psychologists and psychiatrists in the team. Once the consent call was finished, the participant would receive a battery of surveys and questionnaires MAQ, MQ, AMISOS and AMISOSr as well as the additional surveys pertaining to personality, emotionality, and psychological state of mind. At this point the participant also received the link for their first Approach Avoidance test. Once consent was obtained and surveys had been completed successfully (Misophonia score pass), the participant  scheduled  a  visit  at  the  Seaver  Center  at  Mount  Sinai.  Participants  who  had  been selected for the behavioral trial got designated to either manipulation (group 1) or to control (group 2) (see  Figure  2).  Group  1  underwent  a  reminder  of  their  trigger  (reconsolidation)  and counterconditioning,  while  group  2  underwent  counterconditioning  without  reminder  (static screen).  Designation  to  either  group  1  or  2  was  chosen  by  a  simple  coin  toss  as  a  method  of randomization.

Figure 2. Experimental and Control Group Schedule of Events

In their first in person visit (Visit 1), all participants filled in a survey reporting their stress level of that day. After the arrival survey researchers asked the participants to declare whether they had refrained from taking any medication 24h prior to arriving, whether they had used drugs of abuse or if they happened to be pregnant. Once answers were collected all participants were directed to watch a video. The video was either a triggering video (reminder) or a static screen. The volume of the video was set to 8 bars for all participants. Participants were then instructed to rate their experience  of  the  video.  Following  this,  the  clinician  performed  a  distraction  task  on  the

participants, lasting 10 minutes. The distraction task consisted of some subparts of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence task (WAIS-IV), specifically: digit span and simple arithmetic questions. The participants had to repeat the numbers read to them in a specific order or answer simple math questions.  This  distraction  task  was  implemented  to  prevent  participants  from  interacting  and reactivating the memory of their misophonia triggers. Once this was completed a counterconditioning video was shown to the participants, where the participants obtained monetary compensation for watching the videos (they had no choice as to what they could watch).

Six hours after visit 1 took place, participants had to come back to the center to start session 2 (Visit 2). All participants watched their respective short clip video reminding them of their trigger regardless of what group they were in. After this, the participants were then presented with an Approach Avoidance task (same task they had done in their screening process). After finishing the Approach Avoidance task, Visit 2 was completed and participants were sent home.

Participants received 3 online follow ups after in person session 1 and 2. These were 24 hours after the in person visit (Visit 3), a week after (Visit 4) and a month after (Visit 5). All three follow ups were  identical.  The  participant  filled  in  the  4  misophonia  surveys  (MAQ,  MQ,  AMISOS  and AMISOSr)  and  completed  an  approach  avoidance  task.  Participants  were  instructed  to  use  a computer  and  headphones  to  complete  the  Approach  Avoidance  task  and  the  volume  was specified.

The total time spent completing surveys and tasks was estimated to be approximately 5h &amp; 30 min and compensation was postulated to be $20/h. Therefore, the participants were paid $110 with the

option of an additional bonus depending on how they interacted with the Approach Avoidance. The Approach Avoidance tasks gave the participant the chance to collect an additional $12 each time  they  completed  the  task.  The  total  compensation  ranged  from  $110  to  $170  maximum depending on the participant choices in the Approach Avoidance task.

## 5. Results

The  effects  of  reconsolidation  in  the  misophonic  samples  were  analyzed  using  Linear  Mixed Models ANOVA (analysis of variance) to analyze the data in relation to the time frame (Screening, Visit 1, 2, 3 and 4) as the within-subjects parameter and group (1 and 2) as the between-subject factor.

## 5.1 Approach Avoidance (AA)

The results  obtained  by  the  analysis  revealed  that  there  was  no  significant  main  effect  on  the Approach Avoidance scores when accounting for session as a fixed effect (F(4, 75.40) = 1.40, p =.24) nor group as fixed (F (1, 23.78) = .031, p = .86) and no significant interaction between session and group (F(4, 75.40) = .42, p = .79). These findings suggest that neither the type of session nor the group had an impact on the approach avoidance score in our study (See Table 2).

Figure 3. AA scores - Graph represents the longitudinal progression of the two groups in each of their visits. Screen = pre-intervention, Visit 2 = 24h after intervention, Visit 3 = 7 days after intervention, Visit 4 = 1 month after Intervention.

Although no statistical significance was reached, visual interpretation of the data (see figure 3) suggest that group 1 (which underwent reminder) did have a slight improvement of AA from Screening session (M= .744, 95% Cl [.622, .865]) to Visit 1 (In person session) (M= 0.857 (95% CI [.736, .979]) and Visit 2 (24h after in person) (M=.870, 95% Cl [.746, .994]). However, even though  Paired  Sample  T  Test  shows  some  size  difference  (see  table  #)  between  Approach

Avoidance  scores  at  screening  compared  to  Visit  1  (t  =  -2.019,  p  =  .055),  post-hoc  pairwise comparison  revealed  that  this  improvement  was  not  statistically  significant  after  comparing multiple comparisons (Boneferroni correction, p &gt; .05). (See table 3)

Table 3.  Describing the differences between AA Screening to each of the different session scores of AA. Screen = AA_S, visit 1 (6h after intervention) = AA_1, visit 2 (24h after intervention) = AA_2, visit 3 (7 days after intervention) = AA_3, visit 4 (30 days after intervention) = AA_4.

These findings suggest that although a trend can be visually inferred, the data is not sufficient to draw statistical conclusions. Therefore, at most, this trend seems to indicate AA could pose some benefits in treating misophonic patients.

## 5.2 Questionnaires

In  a  similar  matter,  linear  mixed  model  analysis  was  performed  to  analyze  the  evolution  of misophonic triggers through the questionnaires. What follows is a synopsis of the findings after Vovk-Sellke Maximum p-Ratio correction.

## MAQ

There was a significant main effect on Session (F (3, 57.19) = 3.582, p = 0.019), indicating that there was a significant change in the participant responses at the different sessions, but no such

findings  were  found  while  accounting  for  Group  (F  (1,  23.02)  =  0.133, p =  0.719).  Statistical analysis taking into consideration the interaction between Session and Group was also deemed not significant (F (3, 57.19) = 2.121, p = 0.108) (See table and figure 4).

## MQ

The  results  of  the  analysis  revealed  that  there  was  no  significant  main  effect  on  MQ  while accounting for session  (F (3, 57.08) = 2.499, p = 0.069) nor group as fixed (F (1, 22.97) = 0.005, p = 0.943) and no significant interaction between session and group (F (3, 57.08) = 2.317, p = 0.085) (see Table and Figure 5).

## AMISOSr

Analysis of variance of the AMISOSr questionnaire indicated that there was a significant main effect of session (F(3, 57.03) = 3.415, p = 0.023), but no significance in effect was observed in groups (F(1, 22.86) = 1.432, p = 0.244). The interaction between groups and sessions was also not significant (F(3, 57.03) = 0.479, p = 0.698) (see Figure and Table 6).

## AMISOS

The linear mixed model of AMISOS revealed through the analysis of variance that there was no significance in the main effect of session (F (3, 57.30) = 2.493, p = 0.069) nor group main effect (F (1, 23.00) = 1.595, p = 0.219) and the interaction between session and group also indicated no statistically significant difference (F (3, 57.30) = 1.170, p = 0.329) (see Table and Figure 7).

## 6. Discussion, Recommendations, &amp; Conclusions

The results from the analysis showcase the longitudinal evolution of the two groups in their scores of AA and the 4 questionnaires. Even though the findings did not indicate any significance in respect  to  reconsolidation,  there  is  a  case  to  be  made  on  the  role  of  counterconditioning. Nevertheless,  with  the  data  collected  so  far,  the  hypothesis  that  'participants  that  undergo  a reminder of their trigger prior to receiving counterconditioning will show a significant reduction of their aversive responses compared to misophonic participants that do not get a reminder' has not been supported.

In  contrast  to  the  hypothesis,  the  results  seem  to  indicate  that  counterconditioning  (which was given  to  both  groups)  improves  misophonic  symptoms.  In  both  groups,  avoidance  of  the misophonic triggers decreased, while the misophonic scores from the questionnaires decreased, indicating  that  the  misophonic  triggers  were  losing  their  aversive  effects.  These  findings  are interesting since they indicate that a therapeutic and experimental protocol relying on counterconditioning could potentially change emotional valence associated with misophonic triggers. In other words, even though reconsolidation did not seem to play a role in AA and some of the questionnaires, in this limited sample, counterconditioning on its own does show some promise. Further studies would benefit from having a true control group where the participants do not get any intervention, neither reconsolidation reminder nor counterconditioning.

In  regards to the Approach-Avoidance task results, the biggest significance was deemed to be between Screening and Visit 1 and 2. The lower scores at screening could have been caused by the novelty of the triggering video. However, since  the trigger video was constant throughout the experiment, the results may also be due to the habituation and practice the subjects experienced. Therefore, the aversion to the video may have lost its power, causing both groups to respond similarly regardless of intervention. Findings in the questionnaire analysis indicate that out of the 4 questionnaires analyzed, MAQ and AMISOSr had significant changes in regards to the session. This is specifically true in scoring going from Screening to Visit 2. Visit 2 scores happened 24h after counterconditioning (in person sessions), and no effect was found comparing the two groups' evolution.

In respect to the difference between groups, it may well be the case that misophonia is an ingrained maladaptive  memory  that  has  been  exposed  to  consolidation  and  reconsolidation  over  a multiplicity of times. This may cause the negative valence of the trigger to be more stable than we anticipated.  In  order to  change the valence, we  may have to repeat the reconsolidation update multiple times at different sessions before a significant improvement can be found. Similar results and conclusions are found in other studies where the reconsolidation paradigm was put to test in smoking and alcohol cessation as well as in animal models (Suzuki et al., 2004). In these studies, the longer the participant smoked/drank, the less effect reconsolidation had in the craving (Das et al., 2015). Thus, there is a case to be made that reconsolidation is affected by the years a memory has.  In  this  study  the  participants  reported  experiencing  their  first  misophonic  symptoms,  on average, at age 11 and the age of our participants oscillated around 35 years of age. In other words, in this study researchers were trying to treat a maladaptive memory that is 24 years old with a single reconsolidation update intervention. To verify this hypothesis, further studies would need to analyze the efficiency reconsolidation poses to maladaptive memories in respect to the period of time elapsed since the memory was first consolidated. As mentioned in the misophonia chapter, not many studies have been done in the acquisition of misophonia. Even though it is estimated to appear at around age 12, no study has tried to remediate misophonia in preteens. Analyzing the effect of reconsolidation in this group (preteens) and comparing it to our sample (average 35 years of age) may demonstrate the age dependency of the reconsolidation paradigm.

Another factor to consider in explaining the results is the monetary compensation given to the participants.  Compensation  was  provided  constant  (no  option)  in  the  counterconditioning  and variable during Approach Avoidance (dependent of choice). Implementing monetary

compensation as the positive reinforcer through which to change the emotional valence of the trigger may not have been sensitive enough in conditioning or tracking the responses. Individual perspectives on monetary compensation appraisal would lead to a more robust analysis.

It may  also  have  been  the  case  that  in  an  uncontrolled  manner  both  groups  underwent reconsolidation. The expectancy of being triggered at the in-person visit 1, may have caused the participants  to  reactivate  their  misophonic  memories,  activating  their  reconsolidation  process which ended up being updated regardless of experiencing the cue reminder (group 1) or the static screen (group 2). Or on the other hand, perhaps the reminder that was given to Group 1 was not efficient in triggering the misophonia of the patient, thus not reactivating and destabilizing the maladaptive memory.

Further  studies  with  larger  samples  are  needed  to  analyze  the  efficacy  of  reconsolidation. Increasing the sample size may result in more robust conclusions and perhaps even change the findings. In addition, a more personalized assessment of monetary values in each participant could determine  the  efficacy  that  monetary  reward  might  have  as  an  update  mechanism  (modify memory). Lastly, comparing the sample to younger subsets would allow us to determine whether the  time  period  elapsed  since  the  memory  was  first  consolidated  plays  a  role  in  the  need  for repeated reconsolidation paradigms in order to change memories valence.

In  summary,  in  this  study  we  set  to  test  the  reconsolidation  paradigm  potential  in  updating misophonia maladaptive memories. Our analysis did not conclude that there was a significant difference  between  undergoing  theorized  reconsolidation  compared  to  no  reconsolidation.

Although there was a slight improvement in the approach avoidance task in the experimental group (group1-Reminder), the small sample from which this analysis arises does not allow for a definite conclusion. However, the results do indicate that there is an amelioration of the symptoms in both groups,  indicating  that  counterconditioning,  which  was  given  to  both  groups,  is  a  prospective therapeutic mechanism.

## 2. Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ)

By Wu, Lewin, Murphy, &amp; Storch, 2014; Cash, 2015

The Misophonia Questionnaire was developed for a study at the University of South Florida, and it was also used in a recent doctoral dissertation. The study considered a score of 7 or higher on the misophonia severity scale (part 3, 115  rating)  to  be  'clinically  significant.'  This  means  that  misophonia  created  a  serious  problem  in  their  life  that warranted seeking treatment. Adding the score of all 20 questions provides an overall measure of misophonia severity.

## Part 1. Misophonia Symptom Scale

Directions: Please rate how much the following statements describe you on a scale from 0 to 4.

## Implementing the Reconsolidation Paradigm in Treating Misophonia

- 0: Not at all True
- 1: Rarely True
- 2: Sometimes True
- 3: Often True
- 4: Always True

In comparison to other people, I am sensitive to the sound of:

- 1. People eating (e.g. chewing, swallowing, lips smacking, slurping, etc.).
- 2. Repetitive tapping (e.g. pen on table, foot on floor, etc.).
- 3. Rustling (e.g. plastic, paper, etc.).
- 4. People making nasal sounds (e.g. inhale, exhale, sniffing, etc.).
- 5. People making throat sounds (e.g. throat-clearing, coughing, etc.).
- 6. Certain consonants and/or vowels (e.g. 'k' sounds, etc.).
- 7. Environmental sounds (e.g. clock ticking, refrigerator humming, etc.).

Part 3. Misophonia Severity Scale

Directions: Please rate the severity of your sound sensitivity on the following scale from 1 (minimal) to 15 (very severe). Please consider the number of sounds that you are sensitive to, the degree of distress, and the impairment in your life due to your sound sensitivities.

- ____ If you do not have any sound sensitivities, please check here.
- 1-3: Minimal within range of normal or very mild sound sensitivities. I spend little time resisting or being affected by my sound sensitivities. Almost no or no interference in daily activity.
- 4-6:  Mild  sound  sensitivities.  Mild  sound  sensitivities  that  are  noticeable  to  me  and  to  an  observer,  cause  mild interference in my life and which I may resist or be affected for a minimal period of time. Easily tolerated by others.
- 7-9: Moderate sound sensitivities. Sounds sensitivities that cause significant interference in my life and which I spend a great deal of conscious energy resisting or being affected by. Require some help from others to function in daily activity.
- 10-12: Severe sound sensitivities. Sound sensitivities that are crippling to me, interfering so that daily activity is 'an active struggle.' I may spend full time resisting my sound sensitivities or being affected by them. Require much help from others to function.
- 13-15:  Very  severe  sound  sensitivities.  Sound  sensitivities  that  completely  cripple  me  so  that  I  require  close supervision over eating, sleeping, and so forth. It is hard to function on a day-to-day basis because of this.

## 3. Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (AMISOS)

By Schröder, Vulink, &amp; Denys, 2013.

Note: This form has been modified by replacing 'sounds' with 'triggers' to include visual and sound triggers.

The Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S) is an adaptation of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) and was developed by researchers in Amsterdam. The severity of your misophonia is determined by the sum of the points from these questions.

AMSTERDAM MISOPHONIA SCALE: Rate the characteristics of each item during the prior week up until and including the time you fill out this survey. Scores should reflect the average (mean) occurrence of each item for the entire week.

## Q1. How much of your time is occupied by misophonic triggers? How frequently do the (thoughts about the) misophonic triggers occur?

- 0: None
- 1: Mild - less than 1 hr/day, or occasional (thoughts about) triggers (no more than 5 times a day)
- 2: Moderate - 1 to 3 hrs/day, or frequent (thoughts about) triggers (no more than 8 times a day, most of the hours are unaffected).
- 3: Severe - greater than 3 hrs and up to 8 hrs/day or very frequent (thoughts about) triggers.
- 4: Extreme - greater than 8 hrs/day or near constant (thoughts about) triggers.
- Q2. How much do these misophonic triggers interfere with your social, work or role functioning? (Is there anything that you don't do because of them? If currently not working, determine how much performance would be affected if you were employed.)

- 0: None
- 1: Mild - slight interference with social or occupational/school activities, but overall performance not impaired.
- 2: Moderate - definite interference with social or occupational performance, but still manageable.
- 3: Severe - causes substantial impairment in social or occupational performance.
- 4: Extreme - incapacitating.
- Q3. How much distress do the misophonic triggers cause you? (In most cases, distress is equated with irritation, anger, or disgust. Only rate the emotion that seems triggered by misophonic triggers, not generalized irritation or irritation associated with other conditions.)
- 0: None
- 1: Mild - occasional irritation/distress.
- 2: Moderate - disturbing irritation / anger / disgust, but still manageable.
- 3: Severe - very disturbing irritation/anger/disgust.
- 4: Extreme - near constant and disturbing anger/disgust.

Q4. How much effort do you make to resist the (thoughts about the) misophonic triggers? (How often do you try to disregard or turn your attention away from these triggers? Only rate effort made to resist, not success or failure in actually controlling the thought or sound.)

- 0: Makes an effort to always resist, or symptoms so minimal, doesn't need to actively resist.
- 1: Tries to resist most of the time.
- 2: Makes some effort to resist.
- 3:  Yields  to  all  (thoughts  about)  misophonic  triggers  without  attempting  to  control  them,  but  does  so  with  some reluctance.
- 4: Completely and willing yields to all obsessions.
- Q5. How much control do you have over your thoughts about the misophonic triggers? How successful are you in stopping or diverting your thinking about the misophonic triggers? Can you dismiss them?
- 0: Complete control.
- 1: Much control - usually able to stop or divert thoughts about misophonic triggers.
- 2: Moderate control - sometimes able to stop or divert thoughts about misophonic triggers.
- 3: Little control - rarely successful in stopping or dismissing thoughts about misophonic triggers, can only divert attention with difficulty.
- 4: No control - experience thoughts as completely involuntary, rarely able to alter thinking about misophonic triggers.

Q6. Have you been avoiding doing anything, going any place, or being with anyone because of your misophonia? (How much do you avoid, for example, by using other loud sounds, such as music?)

0: No deliberate avoidance.

1: Mild, minimal avoidance. Less than an hrs/day or occasional avoidance.

2: Moderate, some avoidance. 1 to 3 hrs/day or frequent avoidance.

3: Severe, much avoidance. Greater than 3 up to 8 hrs/day. Very frequent avoidance.

4: Extreme very extensive avoidance. Greater than 8 hr/day. Doing almost everything you can to avoid triggering symptoms.

Finally:

What would be the worst thing that could happen to you if you were not able to avoid the misophonic triggers?

Describe:

_________________________________________________

The sum score of these questions determines the severity rating as follows:

- 0-4: Subclinical (meaning you do not need treatment)

- 5-9: Mild

- 10-14: Moderate

- 15-19: Severe

- 20-24: Extreme
