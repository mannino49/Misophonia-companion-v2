Misophonia is characterized by a preoccupation with and strong emotional and 
behavioral reactions to certain triggers, mostly sounds related to eating and 
breathing. We  applied functional impairment due to misophonic symptoms as 
a central criterion to investigate differences between clinical misophonia and 
normative decreased sound tolerance in a large non-random sample of n = 1,881 
individuals from an online survey. We  assessed the frequency of self-reported 
misophonia symptoms across various symptom measures, compared severity, 
triggers and emotional reactions, general psychopathology, interpersonal 
emotion regulation, and quality of life between both groups with and without 
functional impairing misophonia. Individuals with functional impairment due 
to misophonia ( n = 839) revealed significantly higher general psychopathology 
symptoms, lower interpersonal emotion regulation skills, and lower quality of life 
than individuals without impairment ( n = 1,042). Anxious/distressed and annoyed 
reactions to triggers were experienced more frequently compared to emotional 
reactions of disgust and sadness or depression in both groups. Overall, the group 
differences were primarily quantitative in nature. We discuss practical implications 
regarding classification and treatment and provide cutoffs for each symptom 
measure derived from group assignment for functional impairment.

1. Introduction
Misophonia is described as a condition marked by negative reactions toward primarily oral 
and nasal auditory stimuli, such as smacking or slurping. These are usually conceptualized as 
“triggers” as they are responsible for the sequelae of subsequent intense emotional (e.g., 
irritation, anxiety, disgust, and tension), physiological (e.g., increased heart rate), cognitive (e.g., 
internalizing or externalizing appraisal of own reaction), and behavioral (e.g., avoid the stimuli) 
reactions ( 1). Misophonia is currently not included in the International Classification of Diseases 
(ICD-11) ( 2) or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR) ( 3) 
although most research demonstrates significant symptom presentation which seems unrelated 
to hearing levels or perceptual abilities ( 1, 4, 5).
The existing consensus definition on misophonia includes a general description ( 1) but 
where and how to define a clinical threshold for the specific features and their combination is a OPEN ACCESS

Frontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.orgchallenge still to be mastered. Accordingly, estimates on how often 
misophonia occurs [e.g., reported here, ( 6–17)] are characterized by 
a considerable heterogeneity regarding measures and suggested 
cutoffs. For example, in the cited studies, ten different measures in six 
different languages were used to assess misophonia, mostly using self-
reports such as the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S) ( 18), 
the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ) ( 16), or one item only ( 7). Some 
studies included a diagnostic interview on mental disorders and/or 
misophonia as a disorder ( 14, 18, 19), which includes functional 
impairment. The heterogeneity led to frequency estimates between 5 
and 49% across studies, with sample sizes ranging from 94 ( 14) and 
2,519 ( 9), including two samples representative of the general 
population ( 9, 10). For estimates based on self-report, 5% ( 9) and 7.3% 
(15) may be the best evidence currently available, for the first study 
because of the large representative sample, but the estimate is based 
on one item only (item 18 = the MQ severity scale); for the latter 
because of the sample size and the use of the Duke-Vanderbilt 
Misophonia Screening Questionnaire (DVMSQ), which includes 
impairment in its screening algorithm. Still, Swedo et al. ( 1) concluded 
in their Delphi study that a prevalence estimate would be premature.
The higher estimates [e.g., about 35–50% in a help-seeking or 
student sample ( 8, 11)] usually include a mild symptoms group as 
suggested by the developers of the A-MISO-S ( 18). However, it is 
unclear if mild symptoms correspond to a clinical level of a mental 
disorder including sufficient functional impairment or suffering. This 
is somewhat implied as five groups can be  identified with the 
A-MISO-S and only one group is described as “no symptoms/
subclinical. ” Questions on the extent of distress and functional 
impairment are included; however, it is not required to indicate 
impairment or suffering to score in the clinical groups. The MQ in 
contrast derives the clinical group assignment from one item only, 
leading to estimates for clinical symptoms of 16.6–19.9% in college 
students ( 16, 20).
Misophonia symptoms have been reported to be associated with 
symptoms of other mental disorders and lower quality of life in clinical 
as well as student samples. In their large clinical sample, Jager et al. 
(19) reported mild symptoms of anxiety and depression and lower 
quality of life. The comorbidity rate was 28%, with major depressive, 
attention deficit (hyperactivity), and obsessive–compulsive disorder 
as the most common comorbid disorders. The prevalence of these 
disorders was elevated in the misophonia sample compared to the 
general population. Obsessive–compulsive personality traits were also 
very common in the clinical sample (23.8%). Accordingly, Wu et al. 
(16) reported medium significant correlations of misophonia 
symptoms and anxiety, obsessive–compulsive, and depressive 
symptoms in their student sample. Emotion regulation difficulties 
were reported to be  associated with misophonia symptoms, even 
beyond the associations with depressive and anxiety symptoms ( 21, 
22). As both, the experienced emotions toward certain sounds and the 
appraisals of the emotional reaction (externalizing: blaming others; 
internalizing: blaming oneself), differ in individuals with versus 
without misophonia ( 23), a closer investigation of emotion regulation 
processes appears warranted. Many individuals report misophonic 
symptoms to occur with family members and/or significant others but 
not, or at least not to the same extent, to unfamiliar others. We were 
therefore interested to evaluate if there is any relation to interpersonal 
aspects that may function as a discriminating factor between 
individuals with or without misophonic disorder.In the present study, we  examined responses from an online 
survey advertised through different media [(online) newspaper, social 
media, and mailing lists] to recruit individuals who are affected as well 
as unaffected by misophonia. The study had three aims: First, to assess 
the frequency of self-reported misophonia symptoms and compare 
the scoring across various common symptom measures in a large 
sample ( n = 1,881). Second, to perform a clinical group assignment 
based on functional impairment due to misophonia symptoms and 
examine differences between these groups regarding symptoms, 
associated characteristics (e.g., triggers), general psychopathology, 
interpersonal emotion regulation, and quality of life. Third, to provide 
cutoffs for existing symptom measures to differentiate functional 
impairing from non-impairing misophonia based on the same 
measure of functional impairment for each symptom measure.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants
Two thousand one hundred and fifty individuals started the 
online survey. The data of n = 1,881 individuals were included in the 
analyses1. Reasons for exclusion of n = 269 participants were: aged 
under 18 ( n = 23); participation terminated prior to main measure for 
the current study ( n = 246). The mean age of the participants was 
M = 33.10 years ( SD = 11.29; range: 18–77), 1,556 individuals (82.7%) 
self-identified as female (male: 16.9%, non-binary or trans: 0.4%). 
Approximately 71% of the participants ( n = 1,326) were living in a 
relationship (cohabitating) or were married. Most participants were 
well educated (high school degree: 37.7%; college degree: 45.0%). The 
first question of the survey was introduced after a brief description of 
misophonia and requested a self-assignment on how much the 
description applies the participants (translated description: 
“Misophonia is an increased sensitivity to specific sounds (e.g., eating 
sounds, pen clicking, and breathing sounds), and/or an increased 
sensitivity to movement (e.g., bobbing with a leg) which regularly 
leads to extreme emotional reactions (e.g., irritability, anger, and 
disgust)”  - “This definition describes myself: 0 “not at all” to 100 
“entirely”). 87.5% ( n = 1,646) of the individuals indicated that the 
description applied to them with scores ≥50.
2.2. Procedure
The online survey study was approved by the local institutional 
review board of the University of Bielefeld. The survey link was 
provided on the psychotherapy outpatient clinic website, via private 
social networks, and e-mail distribution lists of psychology students 
and individuals interested in misophonia research. Several national 
(online) media became aware of the study and included the link in 
their articles on misophonia. Participation was possible between 
September 2020 and May 2021. Pilot trials indicated a duration of 
30–45 min to complete the survey. All participants provided informed 
consent prior to participation. Participants were able to take part in a

2.3. Materials
2.3.1. Misophonia measures
Most of the misophonia measures described below include several 
items on distress due to misophonia and only single items on 
functional impairments caused by the symptoms. However, the 
respective cutoffs for clinical misophonia can be exceeded without 
having indicated functional impairments on the items. We  were 
specifically interested in impairments in the main areas of functioning 
due to misophonia, as this is one important aspect in the diagnostic 
criteria of mental disorders according to DSM-5 and ICD-11. 
We assessed functional impairments due to misophonia symptoms 
with the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), a five item self-
report measure developed to assess “functional impairment 
attributable to an identified problem” (pp. 461), beyond both disorder 
specific syndromes and the potential distress the syndromes may 
cause ( 24). The items (e.g., “Because of my <<misophonia 
symptoms>>, my ability to work is impaired”) are rated from 0 no 
impairment  to 8 very severe impairment . In the current study, 170 
participants skipped (only) the WSAS in the survey. These participants 
had indicated an impairment of 0 in the introductory question at the 
beginning of the survey. Thus, their WSAS score was set to 0.
Misophonia symptoms and related aspects were assessed with 
eight different self-report questionnaires, with higher sum scores 
indicating higher symptom severity. The measures were translated and 
back-translated from the original language (Dutch or English) to 
German according to a standardized translation and back-translation 
protocol. More detailed information on the translation process are 
presented in the electronic Supplementary material  ESM1.
Three of these measures come from the Amsterdam based 
research group, the 14-item Misophonia Screening List [MSL ( 25), 
German translation ( 26)], the 7-item Amsterdam Misophonia Scale 
[A-MISO-S ( 18), German translation ( 27)] and the 12-item revised 
version of the A-MISO-S [AMISOS-R ( 28), German translation ( 29)]. 
In each instrument, approximately half of the items refer to the main 
symptoms (e.g., “How much of your time is occupied by misophonic 
sounds?” or “How intense is your feeling of irritability/anger when 
you  hear these sounds?”) and the other half to impairments in 
functioning, distress, suffering and/or avoidance due to the symptoms. 
Regarding the emotional reactions and impulses, Schröder and 
colleagues focus on irritability, anger, aggressive impulses, and disgust. 
The A-MISO-S was adapted for misophonia from the Y ale-Brown 
Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) ( 30), a gold standard measure 
to assess symptom severity of obsessive–compulsive disorder. 
Accordingly, aspects of resistance against and control over (obsessive, 
here: misophonia trigger related) thoughts are considered in the 
A-MISO-S and AMISOS-R items, respectively. In the AMISOS-R, the 
respondent is first asked to identify his*her individual trigger and 
emotional reaction (yes/no) and answer the subsequent items 
regarding this individual profile of the most disturbing trigger and 
typical emotion. There are slight but potentially significant differences 
between the measures, the reference period and the way misophonia 
triggers are defined: the A-MISO-S relates to the last 7 days, and 
counts any trigger (“sound, sight, touch, motion, etc.); the AMISOS-R relates to the last 3 days, and counts different sound triggers (e.g., 
eating sounds, nasal sounds, ambient noises); and the MSL does not 
relate to a time period, and speaks of “sounds people make. ” Regarding 
the scoring, symptom severity in the A-MISO-S is indicated by a sum 
score of six out of seven items on a 5-point scale, in the AMISOS-R a 
total score is reflected by a sum of ten items on a 5-point scale for the 
respondents’ typical sound and emotion. According to Jager et al. ( 31), 
preliminary psychometric indices of the scale are good. For the MSL, 
psychometric indices and interpretation guidelines have not been 
published yet. See Table 1  for interpretation of the total scores of the 
measures. Internal consistencies in the current study were Cronbach’s 
α = 0.939 (MSL), α = 0.929 (AMISOS-R), and α = 0.862 (A-MISO-S).
The 18-item Misophonia Questionnaire [MQ ( 16), German 
translation ( 33)] assesses sensitivities to certain sounds in 7 items 
(same sounds as in AMISOS-R) and the frequency of misophonia-
related emotional and behavioral reactions in 10 items (e.g., “Once 
you are aware of the sound (s), because of the sound (s), how often do 
you: Become sad or depressed?”). The sum score of the 17 items 
ranges from 0 to 68. Internal consistency of the MQ sum score was 
α = 0.879 in the current study. Additionally, one item (item 18 = MQ 
severity scale) assesses the self-rated severity of the sound sensitivity 
including related impairments or interferences in daily life 
[0 = minimal  to 15 = very severe , scores above 6 indicating “clinically 
significant symptoms, ” Wu et al. ( 16), p. 997].
The 21-item Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire [MAQ ( 34), 
German translation ( 35)] assesses a person’s emotional reactions and 
interferences with daily life caused by their so-called “sound issues” 
(e.g., “My sound issues make me feel guilty/unhappy/… ”; “My sound 
issues impact my family relationships”) as well as some experiences 
with others’ reactions to the problem (e.g., “My sound issues have not 
been recognized as legitimate. ”), with sum scores from 0 to 21 
interpreted as mild , 22–42 as moderate , and 43–63 as severe . Internal 
consistency in the present study was α = 0.960.
The Misophonia Trigger List (MT) ( 36) contains 79 sounds which 
are to be rated regarding their trigger potential from 0 = “does not 
apply ” to 4 = “ extremely applies . ” The sounds were derived from 
misophonia descriptions ( 37, 38) and extended by generally 
unpleasant sounds, such as mosquito buzzing, dentist’s drill, or 
toilet flushing.
We administered further misophonia measures (one targeted to 
assess diagnostic criteria; the other exploring other areas of 
impairment) in the present study, but this measure is intended to 
be used for a different purpose (a comparison for a clinical sample 
recruited in a different study) which is why the data are not 
reported here.
2.3.2. Other measures
With one item each, we asked about other forms of diagnosed 
decreased sound tolerance, namely hyperacusis, tinnitus, and 
phonophobia, as well as any lifetime diagnosis of audiological or 
hearing disorders or any lifetime diagnosis of a mental disorder. 
Further, we  asked for congenital sensory processing disorders or 
sensory hypersensitivity, experiencing Autonomous Sensory Meridian 
Response (ASMR), and synesthesia. The survey contained questions 
on demographic and health related information and questionnaires 
on the severity of general psychopathology according to diagnostic 
categories in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), 
assessed with the 29-item ICD-10 Symptom Rating (ISR) ( 39), related

assessed with the WSAS ( 24), quality of life, assessed with the 
Bielefelder Instrument for Quality of Life (BIFL) ( 40), and 
interpersonal emotion regulation, assessed with the Interpersonal 
Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (IERQ) ( 41).
2.4. Design and statistical analyses
The present study has a cross-sectional correlational design. 
We assigned participants to two groups according to their WSAS sum 
score of the five regular items and cutoffs, which we derived from the 
mean and standard deviation of a German WSAS validation study 
with depressed patients (i.e., clinical significant impairment from 
depression) ( 42): no or mild impairment, associated with subclinical 
populations  = 0–8, significant functional impairment  ≥ 9 (moderate: 
9–29; severe functional impairment  scores ≥30). Analyses were 
conducted with SPSS Version 26 and the KALPHA macro ( 43). 
We report descriptive statistics for the overall sample and chance-
corrected agreement coefficient Krippendorff ’s alpha per measure 
comparison. Group differences regarding measures on general 
psychopathology, interpersonal emotion regulation, and quality of life 
as well as trigger characteristics were analyzed with t-tests with 
Bonferroni-corrected alpha-levels and interpreted according to 
Cohen’s d effect sizes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
analyses and calculation of related coefficients were performed in RStudio with the packages pROC  (44) and bootLR  (45) to estimate the 
diagnostic capacity of the symptom measures quantified by the Area 
under the curve (AUC) to detect functionally impairing misophonia. 
Cutoff scores were derived based on the Y ouden Index (i.e., an index 
maximizing the sum of sensitivity and 1-specificity).
3. Results
3.1. Frequency of misophonic symptoms 
and functionally impairing misophonia in 
the overall sample
The sum scores and symptom severity levels of the misophonia 
measures for the overall sample are presented in Table 1 . Applying 
the A-MISO-S and the AMISOS-R suggested cutoff scores to the 
present sample resulted in about 15% of the individuals without or 
with subclinical symptoms and about 85% with clinical, at least 
mild symptoms. According to the MAQ, “mild symptoms” is the 
lowest severity category, which applies to about 50% of the present 
sample, with the other 50% presenting with moderate to severe 
symptoms. Similarly, the MQ only differentiates clinically 
non-significant versus significant symptoms, which again resulted 
in about 50% of the sample for each category or—applying a stricter 
criterion ( 32)—about 60% in the clinically non-significant category, 
respectively. These frequencies are relatively high and indicate that TABLE 1 Misophonic symptom sum scores and their classification, based on existing cutoffs per measure, for the whole sample ( N = 1,881).

to this condition.
Based on the binary categories per measure (c.f. Table  1 ; i.e., 
“mild” for the lowest two categories of the A-MISO-S and AMISOS-R 
and the lowest category of the MAQ and “moderate to extreme” for 
the remaining categories; similarly for the MQ item with categories 
“not” versus “clinically significant”), Table 2  presents the concordance 
rates and the chance-corrected agreement coefficient Krippendorff ’s 
α between each two measures. Concordance rates ranged between 82 
and 88% for the category “mild” and 72–85% for the category 
“moderate to extreme. ” The chance-corrected agreement coefficients 
Krippendorff ’s αs (46) ranged between 0.57 and 0.66.
3.2. Phenomenology of individuals with 
misophonia with or without functional 
impairment
According to the WSAS, about 55% of the participants 
experienced no or mild and 45% experienced significant functional 
impairment due to  misophonia symptoms (with 42.8% moderate, 
1.8% severe impairment). Table  2  shows concordance rates and 
Krippendorff ’s α for the WSAS with the binary misophonia 
questionnaires. Means and standard deviations on misophonic symptom severity, other ICD-10 related psychopathology symptoms, 
interpersonal emotion regulation, and quality of life separated by 
group (functional impairment yes/no) are presented in Table  3 . 
T-tests on the non-misophonia measures revealed significant 
differences between the groups regarding psychopathology symptom 
severity, t (1512.68) = −18.43, p < 0.001, d = 0.88, and quality of life, 
t (1813) = 11.78, p < 0.001, d = 0.56, indicating higher 
psychopathology and lower quality of life in the group with versus 
without functional impairing misophonia symptoms. Significant 
group differences on interpersonal emotion regulation scores were 
found for the subscales enhancing positive affect , t (1853) = 4.45, 
p < 0.001, d = 0.21, perspective taking : t (1852) = 3.79, p < 0.001, 
d = 0.18, and soothing , t (1855) = 4.68, p < 0.001, d = 0.22, indicating 
that individuals with versus without functional impairing 
misophonia use these emotion regulation strategies less often. No 
significant group differences were found regarding the subscale 
social modeling , t (1849) = 1.37, p = 0.17, d = 0.06. Frequencies of 
potential self-reported comorbid and/or differential diagnoses or 
phenomena ranged from 0.7% (phonophobia) to 30.5% (ASMR). 
The frequencies separated per functional impairment due to 
misophonia are presented in Table 3 , revealing significantly higher 
rates of phonophobia, hyperacusis, sensory processing disorder or 
hypersensitivity, and mental disorders in the group with versus 
without functional impairments due to misophonia. The odds of a

Frontiers in Psychiatry 08 frontiersin.org4. Discussion
The present study aimed at assessing the frequency of misophonia 
symptom (severity) in a large non-representative sample according to 
common misophonia measures, describing differences in the clinical 
picture of misophonia for those with versus without significant 
functional impairment, and to provide cutoffs on misophonia 
questionnaires for the purpose of identifying those best who reported 
significant functional impairment in their daily lives due to 
misophonia, and as such, are most likely individuals who would need 
access to and benefit from treatment for this condition.
First of all, this is to our knowledge the first study to compare 
scoring across various misophonia symptom measures in a large 
sample of n = 1,881. We found 85% of the individuals in the mild-to-
severe misophonia symptoms range based on the A-MISO-S or 
AMISOS-R. The MQ and MAQ only identified 50% of this sample to 
be in the clinical range. The measure comparisons revealed that 12 to 
28% of individuals scored in the “mild group” of one but the 
“moderate–severe” group of another misophonia measure, indicating 
that the measures at least partly assess different aspects of misophonia. 
The pattern was even more pronounced for the functional impairment 
measure WSAS compared to symptom severity measures, with a 
proportion of up to 37%. This underlines the subordinate role of 
misophonia-caused functional impairment in the classification into 
mild and moderate–severe of these measures. It demonstrates that the 
majority of classifications within misophonia measures so far are 
based primarily on severity (e.g., simply reflecting the extent to which 
a person is triggered by sounds) and put less emphasis on the 
difference between impairment due to and severity of the misophonic 
reaction. The consequences may be less significant the more severe the 
misophonic reaction, as with increasing severity is it likely to also find 
more impairment. However, especially in the moderate range of 
misophonic reactions, this discrimination may be significant. The 
developers of the A-MISO-S and AMISOS-R, respectively, name the 
lowest symptom class “subclinical, ” implying that all other symptom 
classes exceed the clinical threshold: the mild symptom class and the 
moderate and severe class ( 18, 29). Based on our results, we suggest to 
conceptualize the mild symptom class still as subclinical, rather 
reflecting variations in this specific form of decreased sound tolerance 
than meeting threshold for a clinical disorder. This would also be in 
line with our attempt to identify a disorder (clinical threshold) by 
using misophonic-related functional impairment in daily lives as a 
quantification of one of the suggested revised diagnostic criteria for 
misophonia ( 19). When differentiating the sample in those reporting 
clinically significant impairment, we identified 44% of the present 
sample to be affected by a clinical expression of misophonia. This is 
much lower than the number of participants who self-assigned to the 
condition before they started the survey (87.5%). Similarly, Williams 
et al. identified 7.3% as clinical and 10% as subclinical misophonia 
cases using the DVMSQ that differentiated between the groups by a 
functional impairment item ( 15). On the one hand, these findings 
demonstrate that experiencing symptoms, such as not liking specific 
sound stimuli, is overestimating the presence of a functional impairing 
condition. On the other hand, it underlines that self-identification 
with misophonia is rather based on a dimensional construct than a 
categorical disorder approach. We follow up on a suggestion made by 
a reviewer of this article (Zack Williams) and propose to use the term 
“misophonic disorder” for a clinically relevant manifestation of this condition only and use “misophonic reactions” when subclinical 
manifestations are the focus of research on misophonia. Thus, 
we suggest misophonia might be used as an umbrella term for all 
manifestations, analog to for example, depression for depressive 
symptoms and depressive disorders or in the context of tinnitus 
symptoms (and tinnitus as a disorder) ( 47). The dimensional approach 
still leaves open what defines the respective underlying construct (s). 
We propose to follow up on this aspect in future research investigating 
whether the tendency of experiencing misophonic (emotional) 
reactions varies between individuals; and if this individual tendency 
is rather representing a risk factor for the development of a misophonic 
disorder (alike behavioral inhibition in anxiety disorders) or if it is in 
itself a main criterion of the disorder and only needs to reach a certain 
threshold. For example, it might be important to compare the patterns 
of symptoms in non-misophonic, subclinical, and clinical misophonia 
groups across multidimensional measures.
We determined large group differences between the subclinical 
and the clinical manifestation with literally more severe/more frequent 
symptom scores across all measures, independently of whether they 
focus on misophonic symptoms or general psychopathology including 
depressive, anxiety, or obsessive–compulsive symptoms. These 
differences also extend to other concepts, such as quality of life with 
medium and interpersonal emotion regulation skills with small effect 
sizes. This study is adding a comparison group study to the existing 
evidence and it suggests mostly more severe reactions in the clinical 
compared to the non −/subclinical group ( 16, 19) and extends findings 
on emotion regulation ( 22) to interpersonal emotion regulation skills. 
However, as in ( 48), there is also evidence for qualitative differences, 
e.g., in emotional reactions to misophonic stimuli.
Regarding potential comorbid or differential diagnoses and 
phenomena, the pattern is similar for diagnosed hyperacusis and 
phonophobia with odds around 7 times higher for these diagnoses in 
the clinical versus non −/subclinical group. However, the rates of 
diagnosed tinnitus and experiences of ASMR and synesthesia were not 
significantly different and reported less often in the group with clinical 
versus non −/subclinical manifestations of misophonia. Finally, the 
types of stimuli that are experienced as annoying are vastly the same 
across both groups, primarily sounds related to eating and breathing. 
This may indicate a normative power of these stimuli to elicit 
annoyance in many individuals, although this should be interpreted 
with caution in light of the high proportion of individuals self-
identifying with misophonia in the current study.
However, it remains unclear why these sounds are annoying for 
so many people. The similarity in trigger sounds in both groups may 
imply cognitive and emotional processes involved in evaluating the 
stimuli to be key when trying to make a difference for those affected 
by misophonia ( 23). In the current study, the difference between 
functionally impaired and non-impaired groups rather lay in the 
intensity to which these stimuli were experienced and evaluated as 
annoying. In line with the idea mentioned earlier, we hypothesize that 
the difference between clinical and subclinical manifestations may 
be more a matter of quantity than quality (“quantity hypothesis”); that 
is a clinical group may not be characterized by a specific symptom 
profile or different (types of) stimuli that function as a trigger but may 
be  more reflected by similar symptoms and a similar ranking of 
functional stimuli (i.e., with the power to trigger the specific 
emotional, behavioral and physiological reactions associated with 
misophonia). Similarly, Savard et al. ( 49) found support for the idea

Frontiers in Psychiatry 10 frontiersin.orgof a continuum for misophonia symptom severity from their online-
survey results. Additionally, derived from results of an experimental 
masking paradigm with different (trigger) sounds, they found that 
individuals with high versus low misophonia symptoms had similar 
detection rates of sounds—triggers were identified best in both 
groups, followed by unpleasant and neutral sounds—but differed 
regarding the subsequent emotional reaction with higher ratings of 
negative emotions in the high versus low symptom group.
Interestingly, the “quantity hypothesis” appears to also apply 
within the clinical group: when examining differences between 
moderate and severe clinical presentations, all scores descriptively 
increase when moving to the severe group. The size of these effects 
varies around one standard deviation ( d = 0.69–1.53), roughly, across 
all measures—except for the interpersonal emotion regulation 
questionnaire. Effect sizes for the differences drop clearly with the 
largest one reaching roughly d = 0.25 on “Enhancing positive affect, ” 
and going further down to d < 0.01 on the other three scales. Thus, the 
differences on the interpersonal emotion regulation subscales are 
statistically significant (exception: social modeling). However, the 
effects are small and were only detectable due to the large sample size, 
which may suggest that the group differences for the subscales 
“soothing” and “perspective taking” are not clinically meaningful. At 
the same time, this may point at the relative significance of positive 
emotion regulation and the lack of adaptive regulation skills within 
the clinical group while both interpersonal maladaptive and adaptive 
emotion regulation skills distinguish clinical from subclinical 
presentations. The interpersonal emotion regulation questionnaire is 
a measure that reflects how individuals may utilize others to regulate 
their own emotions ( 41) and this specific subscale “Enhancing positive 
affect” is significantly correlated with reappraisal, tolerating and 
accepting emotion regulation skills. It may be beneficial to include a 
treatment module on how to deliberately improve one’s own positive 
affect when working with more severe cases (in addition to working 
on reducing maladaptive interpersonal emotion regulation for 
everybody in treatment). Another interpretation of these findings 
would be that the lack of interpersonal emotion regulation is adaptive 
in the clinical group as long as misophonia symptoms are still present, 
as individuals with misophonia may have experienced invalidation of 
their emotions and others might rather trigger (negative) emotions 
than regulate them. These suggestions need to be considered with 
caution because the comparisons rely on very different sample sizes 
per group. The percentage of those with severe presentations is 
proportionally small in the entire sample. Nevertheless, it is still a 
considerable number of individuals ( n = 34) and in light of the few 
empirical findings helping to derive treatment recommendations, it 
may add some further ideas on what to include in psychological 
treatment (packages). Further, we  mainly looked at interpersonal 
enhancing positive affect. This does not necessarily relate to one’s own 
skills. When thinking about clinical implications, one way to go may 
include a module of specific emotion regulation skills. However, it is 
unclear from our results, if individuals are generally lacking in their 
ability to experience positive affect or if this is more specific to 
interpersonal emotion regulation. In the latter case, it may also imply 
to include interventions related to drawing on others to support their 
own emotion regulation. Following the interpretation of the lack of 
interpersonal emotion regulation as adaptive and a result of 
misophonia, interpersonal emotion regulation would not be targeted 
in treatment but would possibly improve eventually with a decrease in misophonia symptoms. These different implications may be tested in 
future studies.
Another interesting result relates to the emotions experienced in 
response to triggers. It may be noted that misophonia measures partly 
differ regarding the emotional reactions they assess. While the 
A-MISO-S and AMISOS-R do not assess anxious/distressed 
reactions—in contrast to the MQ—the latter does not assess disgust. 
According to the MQ, annoying, anxious/distressed, and angry 
emotional responses to misophonic stimuli were the responses most 
frequently endorsed in our study. Although sad/depressed feelings 
also occur (similarly disgust, AMISOS-R), they ranked clearly behind 
anxiety and anger, mentioned only about half as often. Comparing 
irritation and anger, group differences in endorsement rates were 
larger for anger, indicating that anger might be  better able to 
discriminate clinical from subclinical reactions. In the consensus 
definition of misophonia, Swedo et al. ( 1) name all the aforementioned 
emotions as “most common” reactions to triggers (pp.  10) and 
dispense with weighting further. In contrast, Jager et al. ( 19) define 
(only) irritation, anger and/or disgust as required emotional reaction 
toward triggers in their revised criteria of misophonia, and leave out 
anxiety. They discuss anxiety as potentially mistaken emotional 
response as their study participants with clinical misophonia did not 
mention anxiety as first (i.e., as fear reaction) but either anticipatory 
or secondary emotional response. Similarly, lower endorsement rates 
of the fear/panic item were found in the validation of the Duke-
Vanderbilt Misophonia Screening Questionnaire (DVMSQ) ( 15). As 
distress and anxiety are combined in the MQ item, they cannot 
be disentangled in the responses. Because of the somewhat mixed 
findings across studies, we suggest continuing to capture all these 
different emotions, including disgust and anxiety, as a potential 
response in research studies until the evidence basis points more 
clearly to an emotional reaction which is the most typical and/or 
differentiates misophonic disorder best from subclinical misophonic 
reactions or other conditions.
Regarding group differences in the current study, with severity 
increasing, the steepest increase is observed in anxious or depressed 
emotional responses relative to angry and annoyed responses when 
exposed to annoying stimuli. Externalizing attributions may increase 
the externalizing emotional reactions (i.e., angry, annoyed). 
We speculate that this externalizing pattern might be common along 
the continuum of symptom severity, whereas the internalizing 
emotional reactions might appear more often and more strongly in 
those individuals with higher, clinical symptom severity and duration. 
Thus, providing skills to regulate specifically anger and/or attributional 
retraining may be  another promising candidate for a treatment 
module—on the one hand, to prevent the significantly increased 
occurrence of verbally as well as physically aggressive reactions in 
individuals with clinical misophonia (medium effect sizes) and, on the 
other hand, to prevent or decrease secondary depressive reactions.
Finally, when screening for misophonia with the purpose of 
identifying clinical manifestations that deserve treatment-related 
attention, it is recommended to use a higher cutoff on the common 
instruments for misophonia symptoms (e.g., A-MISO-S or AMISO-R) or 
to add a functional impairment requirement in the interpretation of the 
scales. A (mental) disorder usually requires clear impairment in areas of 
daily life (e.g., ICD-11) ( 2) and health insurances usually only cover 
treatment expenses when a clinical threshold is met. While this diagnostic 
issue is best addressed with a clinician-administered interview,

Möllmann et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1112472
Frontiers in Psychiatry 11 frontiersin.orgpre-selection, for example for inclusion in randomized controlled 
treatment trials, could be successfully conducted based on recommended 
cutoff scores. We provide several possibilities of sum score cutoffs across 
misophonia instruments with associated costs and benefits on sensitivity 
and specificity to help tailoring the cutoff score to the associated research 
purpose2. Of those published previously (e.g., AMISO-S, AMISO-R), our 
recommended cutoffs are higher, and of those without cutoff  
recommendations so far (MQ, MAQ), we provided our suggestions. The 
former indicates that clinical cases may have been underrepresented in 
previous studies, specifically in the mild symptom class.
Assignment to a class also requires reflecting upon the best 
conceptual match with other examples of the overall disorder group. 
Focusing on the emotional reactions, one might come to different 
conclusions depending on which emotion (s) one focuses on. Whereas 
anger, irritation, or fear/anxiety indicate an emotional disorder 
(anxiety and mood disorders, e.g., disruptive mood dysregulation 
disorder), distress and/or disgust reactions point more toward an 
obsessive–compulsive spectrum. Even if there is rather little evidence 
from our study that OCD-related assumptions maybe transferred to 
this condition, valid conclusions still appear premature. Progress in 
classification also requires to reflect upon potentially effective 
psychological treatments. The present study supports CBT strategies 
already used in the treatment of misophonia such as attention training 
and arousal reduction ( 51). Further, it suggests that it may 
be worthwhile to assess changes in interpersonal emotion regulation 
in other interpersonal contexts beyond the misophonic reaction itself 
during treatment. If individuals experience persisting difficulties, the 
therapeutic strategies may be  extended to interpersonal emotion 
regulation, for example, teaching (specific) emotion regulation skills 
to enhance positive affect as well as skills to reduce negative affect and 
anger in these non-misophonic contexts in general.
4.1. Limitations
Compared to the general population, a disproportionate number 
of female, highly educated, young individuals participated in the 
study. This reflects a typical but not less critical pattern, which should 
be  addressed with targeted sampling in future studies to improve 
generalizability. Similarly, (online) surveys that disclose misophonia 
as a central topic, lead to inclusion of more individuals with an 
increased interest in the topic and/or self-identifying with the 
condition, which does not allow conclusions about the prevalence of 
misophonia in general and may also be a potential source of bias 
regarding other results. However, the self-selection by interest and 
subjective affectedness also led to many participants with symptom 
severity around our diagnostic threshold so we could compare and 
differentiate the two groups particularly well. It should be noted that 
we did not include attention checks in the survey and that there was 
no compensation for every participant. However, we  did check if 
we  detect unusual response patterns (e.g., random or careless 
responses to the survey questions) and did not find evidence for any

selection of an optimal cutoff depending on the purpose.clear pattern in the participants. Some of the misophonia measures 
were primarily developed to assess symptom severity in individuals 
with (probable) misophonia and may thus include terms which are 
more intuitively comprehensible by individuals familiar with the 
phenomenon. Another limitation results from the use of self-report 
measures only without a diagnostic interview and without 
comprehensively addressing other forms of decreased sound tolerance 
which would allow the identification of differential diagnoses and/or 
comorbidities. The selection of the five misophonia questionnaires 
used in the current study was based rather on the level of dissemination 
at the time of data collection and does not reflect all available 
misophonia questionnaires. Other measures which were developed or 
published afterward could naturally not be considered.
4.2. Conclusion
In the present study, a large difference of roughly 45% was found 
between the proportion of individuals who indicated the description 
of misophonia as applying to them (87.5%) and those who revealed 
functional impairments due to misophonia symptoms (44%). 
We suggest to use the latter as a criterion to differentiate individuals 
with (subclinical) misophonic reactions from those with misophonic 
disorder. Accordingly, we provide cutoffs for five different misophonia 
measures (A-MISO-S, AMISOS-R, MSL, MQ, and MAQ) which best 
detect individuals with and without misophonic disorder (i.e., with 
and without functional impairments due to misophonic reactions) in 
settings in which a diagnostic interview is not applicable. These values 
partly differ from existing classifications of some of the measures in 
that they raise the threshold for clinical misophonia.
The comparison of the groups regarding aspects of misophonia 
and other characteristics, such as general psychopathology or quality 
of life, revealed rather quantitative differences, such as increasing 
symptom severity or number of triggers with higher functional 
impairments. However, some misophonic reactions and associated 
aspects appeared more typical—in both groups. For example, annoyed 
and anxious/distressed reactions were experienced more frequently 
compared to reactions of disgust and sadness/depression. Similarly, 
within interpersonal emotion regulation skills, especially skills to 
enhance positive affect were significantly impaired with increasing 
misophonia severity. We  suggest to include and extend specific 
interventions on improving the regulation of negative, more 
externalizing emotions, as the typical misophonic reactions and also 
target the ability to enhance positive affect.
