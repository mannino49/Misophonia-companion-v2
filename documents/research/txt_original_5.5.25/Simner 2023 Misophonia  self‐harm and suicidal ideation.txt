Aim: Misophonia is a sound sensitivity disorder characterized by an unusually strong aversion to a specific class of sounds -often human bodily sounds (e.g., chewing). These sounds can cause intense negative emotions which can cause profound difficulties in everyday life. The condition is linked with higher rates of anxiety and depression, and here we ask whether it co occurs with elevated self harm and suicidal thinking. --

Methods: We measured self harm -and misophonia in the general population by examining a birth cohort sample from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We screened them for misophonia as adults, then analyzed their earlier data on well being, self harm, and suicidal thinking. --

Results: Adults with misophonia had significantly higher rates of self harm and suicidal -ideation, as well as poorer well being in a number of different measures at ages 16 --17 and 23 -24 years. Female misophonics were particularly at risk, from as early as their teenage years, though males, too, show elevated self harm at 24 years compared to -nonmisophonic peers.

Conclusion: Our data provide evidence of elevated risks of self harm associated with -misophonia and suggest the need for greater recognition and treatment pathways.

## KEYWORDS

Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), mental health, misophonia, self harm, -suicidal ideation, suicide

Misophonia is a sound sensitivity disorder in which certain classes of sound feel unusually unpleasant. 1,2 Typical triggers are human bodily sounds (e.g., chewing), repetitive sounds (e.g., clicking), or even nonauditory repetitive actions, such as leg rocking, -3 6 -despite its primary classification as a sound sensitivity. For people with misophonia, these triggers can cause intense negative emotions, such as anxiety, disgust, or anger. 2 Although recognized by many as a psychiatric disorder in its own right, 7 misophonia has also been linked to other mental health challenges (e.g., depression), including self -harm (see below). However, these links have sometimes been based on participant samples which are self selected or more extreme cases -(e.g., drawn from clinics). Here we examine misophonia in the wider population using a large birth cohort. We investigate well being in the - context of self harm and suicidal ideation, asking whether the general -population of misophonia sufferers is more at risk than nonmisophonics in this regard.

Self harm -is a key public health concern 8 with a lifetime European prevalence of 17.1% at 17 years. 9 Self harm comes with -an elevated risk of suicide, 10 as well as suicidal thoughts and planning. 8 Relevant here is that self harm is five times higher among -depressed individuals 8 and, importantly, people with misophonia have higher depressive traits 11,12 and anxiety 13 -15 as well as poorer well being. -14 As such, there may be a link between misophonia, depression, self harm, and suicidal ideation, which we explore here. -Our investigation also reflects that self harm has been divided into -distinct classes: self harm with intent to die (attempted suicide), and -

self harm without suicidal intent (sometimes called nonsuicidal self --injury), 16,17 though these may yet be different intensities of the same phenomenon. 8,18 A related phenomenon is suicidal thinking (prevalent at 11% 17%) or planning (9.5%). -19,20 Importantly, those who self harm -with no intent for suicide still have an elevated risk of attempted suicide 17 and suicidal thoughts. 21 Hence our investigation not only targets self harm (with and without intent to die) but suicidal -thinking.

Case studies have described self harm and suicidal ideation/planning -in misophonics with co morbidities -such as anxiety. 22 25 -However, participants have often been drawn from clinics, where the most severe cases are likely to gather. Moreover, case studies cannot provide a meaningful link to misophonia because they may be a chance co -occurrence which drew the attention of clinicians/researchers. Groupwise studies have provided a useful continuation but have presented a mixed picture. Two had no controls but showed suicidality in approximately the normal range for the general population (Edelstein et al. 26 =9.1%; Rouw and Erfanian 27 =21.9%; See 28,29 ), while a third 30 did not provide analyses for self harm/suicidality -alone (but merged it among 16 different psychiatric disorders). A fourth study targeted a random cohort in Ankara using a battery of questions including a single question on attempted suicide. 31 Suicide attempts were reported significantly more often in those with misophonia, but the study was unable to achieve its random recruitment goal because a large portion (one third ) -* of their target population declined to take part or were rejected. However, this study makes the important first step towards random sampling and suggests that suicide rates may potentially be higher in misophonia.

Our own investigation targets a large birth cohort of adults who have been tested extensively since infancy, including measures of well being -and mental health (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children [ALSPAC]). 32 We screened them at 28 years, identifying several hundred participants with misophonia, and several thousand without. Then, using data gathered earlier from the same cohort, we ask whether the misophonia group diverged from their peers in self harm, suicidal ideation, -and well being in this earlier data. Our interest in well being is to explore --the types of prerequisites that might make self harm likely to manifest. -We know that quality of life declines with increasing misophonia symptoms, and misophonics have poorer life satisfaction as adults 4 and children. 14 But subjective well being -is a heterogenous construct, including not only evaluative life satisfaction 33 but also hedonic well -being (e.g., emotional stability), eudemonic well being -(e.g., positive attitude), 34 and health related quality of life. -35,36 People with misophonia show significant deficits in the former and latter, but other well being -constructs in misophonia are less well understood. Here we analyze data from scales of mental well being, -subjective happiness, personal well -being, and life satisfaction (this latter to replicate earlier findings and establish additional validity).

In summary, we hypothesize higher rates of self harm (with or -without intent to die) in our sample of people with misophonia,

*We deduce these researchers targeted approximately 822 participants in 300 households because the average household size of eligible participants was 2.74 (given their report of 710 eligible residents living in a subset of 259 houses). Of these 822 targeted, 541 took part.

accompanied by poorer well being. These hypotheses are based on -higher rates of depression/anxiety found in previous misophonia studies and lower life satisfaction.

## METHODS

## Participants

We tested the ALSPAC birth cohort 32,37,38 whose original recruits were pregnant women from Avon, UK, with expected delivery dates between April 1, 1991 and December 31, 1992. Initial enrolment resulted in 14,901 babies alive at 1 year of age. In the current study we screened over 4000 of the active remaining respondents (called the Children of the 90s cohort ) in December 2020 -February 2021 as part of the ' Life at 28+ ' wave of data collection. Our returned data were from 4253 adults, comprising 1452 males at birth --(mean age 345.81 months; SD 5.94 months), 2798 females at birth --(mean age 345.49 months; SD 6.04 months) and three without sex at birth data (mean age 338.67 months; --SD 4.51 months). After our screening for misophonia (see Materials), this group contained 333 adults with misophonia (77 male, 256 female) and 3920 without (1375 male, 2542 female, 3 unknown) who form our nonmisophonic comparison group. Table 1 shows how many participants also had data for our earlier measures of interest.

## MATERIALS

Table 2 summarizes which measures were administered at each period of interest (16 -17, 23 -24, 28 years).

## Sussex Screener for Misophonia 11

The Sussex Screener for Misophonia (SSfM) was administered at 28 years of age, and provides a characterization of misophonia to which participants agree or disagree (i.e., When sounds (e.g., crunching) consistently cause extreme emotions, like anger, disgust or anxiety ), as well as examples of major categories of misophonia triggers ( eating noises , throat clearing , nasal noises , etc.). For those agreeing with misophonia, the screener contains further items probing its severity in disrupting daily life ( not at all , very mildly , moderately , severely , very severely ), and additional questions (for consideration elsewhere), such as whether the participant had sought clinical support, and when they believe it had developed. Misophonics are classified as those agreeing with the characterization of misophonia, but also rejecting ' not at all ' for its detriment to daily life (i.e., misophonia must disrupt daily life for participants in our misophonia group, at least to some degree). The remainder formed our comparison group (i.e., disagreeing to misophonia, or saying they dislike sounds but not to any detriment in their daily life).

The screener shows ample convergent and divergent validity from multiple lines of evidence from the participants' lives, described fully in Rinaldi and Simner. 11 For example, those identified with

Similarly, they were significantly more likely than the comparison group to use sound distractions -while eating (e.g., tv), and showed typical interpersonal difficulties aged 25 (e.g., more annoyed by others). Finally, the screener has divergent validity, being nonpredictive of unrelated traits (e.g., creative self concept). -11 Participants completed the screener in digital form, with a pencil and paper version on request. These data --(and those that follow) were gathered by the ALSPAC team using Redcap, the secure web based -software platform hosted at the University of Bristol to support data capture for research studies. 40

The questionnaire has no total score but comprises individual questions of relevance, with certain questions contingent on previous answers. For our purposes here, participants at age 16 were asked ' Have you ever hurt yourself on purpose in any way (e.g., by taking an overdose of pills or by cutting yourself)? ' Responses were yes/no , and affirmative responders were subsequently asked: ' On any of the occasions when you have hurt yourself on purpose, have you ever seriously wanted to kill yourself? ' ( yes / no ). Finally, the entire sample was given a question drawn from a study of suicidal feeling, 41 this being: ' Have you ever felt that life was not worth living? ' ( yes/no ). In the abridged version at age 24, participants were again asked the first two questions above, as well as a suicidal thinking question, phrased as follows: ' Have you ever thought of killing yourself, even if you would not really do it? ' ( yes / no ). â 

## Questionnaire on self harm and suicidal feeling -8

This self complete questionnaire measured self harm (with and --without intent to die) as well as suicidal thinking and planning. It was administered at 16 and 24 years, the latter in abridged form.

â  Additional questions were not explored further, either because we had no a priori hypotheses (e.g., about methods of self harm), or because questions were deeply embedded -(required multiple ' yes ' responses at different earlier questions). All questions are found at Kidger et al., 8 and ALSPAC's searchable data dictionary (http://www.bristol.kiac.uk/alspac/ researchers/our-data).

Multiple studies show convergent validity between these items and a number of biological and psychological traits. For example, the self harm -items show the known inverse correlation with puberty indicators, such as age of menarche 42 and peak height velocity, 43 while suicidality items show known correlations with birth order 44 and maternal depression. 45

## The Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale --46

This 14 item scale measured hedonic and eudemonic well being at --17 and 23 years. Questions cover mental well being over the past 2 -weeks (e.g., ' I've been feeling optimistic about the future ) ' with responses on a five point scale ( -none of the time to all of the time ). Responses are summed for a total score (14 -70), where higher scores indicate better mental well being. -

The measure shows high internal consistency and moderate to high test -retest reliability in 13 -16 year olds, --47 university students, and the general population aged 16 -75 years. 46 In the same studies it also showed convergent validity with measures of life satisfaction as well as divergent validity with opposing constructs (e.g., physical health) and concurrent validity with the World Health Organization -Five Well Being Index. -48

## The UK Office of National Statistics four subjective well being questions -49

The Office for National Statistics 4 Item -Scale (ONS4) was administered at 23 years, and comprises four questions about three types of well being -(evaluative, eudemonic, affective): Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays? Overall, to what extent do you feel that the things you do in your life are worthwhile? Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday? How anxious did you feel yesterday? Responses run from 1 to 10 ( not at all to completely ). This measure is designated for National Statistics (i.e., deemed to meet high standards of trustworthiness and value) 49,50 and used extensively by the ONS and UK Government (citations at www.tinyurl.com/ons4surveys). For example, one recent validation 51 showed good internal reliability (Cronbach's Î± = 0.90), and moderate/strong correlations with health confidence and health status.

## Subjective Happiness Scale 52

This four item scale of hedonic well being in subjective happiness --was administered at 23 years. Responses have a seven point -scale with labels adjusted by question. Its four questions are: In general, I consider myself â¦ not a very happy person â a very happy person ; Compared with most of my peers, I consider myself â¦ less happy â more happy ; Some people are generally very happy. They enjoy life regardless of what is going on, getting the most out of everything. To what extent does this characterization describe you? Not at all â A great deal ; Some people are generally not very happy. Although they are not depressed, they never seem as happy as they might be. To what extent does this characterization describe you? Not at all â A great deal . The scale has been translated into more than 30 languages and validated extensively with a unidimensional structure and adequate test -retest reliability and internal consistency, as well as convergent validity against related constructs such as depression. 52,53

## Satisfaction with Life Scale 54

This self -report for life satisfaction was administered at 23 years, and has responses on a five point Likert scale ( -disagree a lot to agree a lot ). Its five items are: In most ways my life is close to the way I would want it to be ; The things in my life are excellent ; I am happy with my life ; So far I have gotten the important things I want in life ; If I could live my life over, I would have it the same way . The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) is one of the most widely used well being scales across a range of different age groups, genders, -and nationalities. 55 Multiple validations show it to be a reliable measure of life satisfaction, with good convergent validity, and satisfactory to high --reliability and internal consistency (e.g., Î± = 0.74). 55 -58

## ANALYTIC PLAN

Since our sample is female skewed and there are known associations between sex and well being/self harm --(where girls are especially affected), 59 we examine males and females separately (i.e., either as separate datasets for Ï 2 s or as a predictor in analyses of variance [ANOVAs]). Given this, we also removed the three participants whose sex at birth was unknown. --

We used Ï 2 analyses (with Yates corrections where required) for the categorical self -harm data at each timepoint. For well -being in late adolescence (Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well Being --Scale [WEMWBS at age 17), we report a 2 Ã 2 ANOVA crossing group (misophonics, nonmisophonics) and sex at birth (females, --males) having removed outliers ( n = 17 with z -scores &gt;3), and meeting assumptions of normality, linearity, and homogeneity of variance (using Levene's test). 60 We additionally report a binary logistic regression for the link between well being and self harm, --selecting the earliest time point (16 -17 years) and longest well -being measure (WEMWBS).

At age 23, we report a 2 Ã 2 multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) crossing group (misophonics, nonmisophonics) and sex -at birth -(females, males) predicting our four well being -measures (subjective happiness, life satisfaction, WEMWBS, ONS4). We removed excessive missing data (of &gt;5%), and multivariate outliers (using Mahalanobis distance) totalling 198 participants ( n = 175 for missingness, n = 23 outliers). Data were approximately multivariate

normal, and met linearity and homogeneity of covariance (Box's M ). 61 We also conducted univariate ANOVAs (correcting post hoc tests) -for each outcome. We used R/R Studio 62 with the following packages: tidyverse for general data wrangling, ggplot2 and gridExtra for graphs, ez for univariate ANOVA, car for Levene's test, and heplots for Box's M.

We remind the reader that we split our participants into ' misophonics ' and ' nonmisophonics ' only once, using the screener at 28 years. Hence when we describe ' data from our misophonia group at age 16 ' (or ' misophonic participants at age 16 ), this means ' data from 16 year old --individuals who went on to demonstrate misophonia when screened at 28 years. Sample size for each analysis is shown in Table 1 (given that sample size changed according to participant availability across the three decades of this longitudinal data).

## RESULTS

## Time block 16 -17 years

## Self harm age 16 -

We first inspected the proportion of misophonics and nonmisophonics who had ever self harmed. -Ï 2 s were performed separately for females and males. Males showed no difference for misophonics versus nonmisophonics ( Ï 2 (1) = 0.12, p = 0.723) but females showed a significantly higher percentage of misophonics self -harming compared to nonmisophonics ( Ï 2 (1) = 20.98, p &lt; 0.001; see Table 3). Within yes responders we next looked -at whether their self harm -was with intent to die ( 'â¦ seriously wanted to kill yourself? ). ' We found no significant groupwise difference for either females ( Ï 2 (1) = 1.64, p = 0.200) or males ( Ï 2 (1) = 0.03, p = 0.852; see Table 4). However, this embedded question means numbers were small, especially for males.

Finally, we examined suicidal feelings with the question targeting the entire sample ( 'â¦ felt that life was not worth living? ). We again '

found no groupwise differences among males ( Ï 2 (1) = 2.65, p = 0.103), but a significant difference among females ( Ï 2 (1) = 25.53, p &lt; 0.001; seeTable 5) such that misophonics experienced suicidal feeling more than nonmisophonics.

Our 2 Ã 2 ANOVA crossed group (misophonic, nonmisophonic) and sex at birth --(female, male) in the WEMWBS well being scale. We -found a significant main effect of group ( F [1, 2613] = 6.65, p = .009, Î· p 2 = 0.003), where misophonics scored lower ( M = 46.13, SD = 9.35) than nonmisophonics ( M = 48.33, SD=8.24). We also found an expected main effect of sex at birth ( --F [1, 2613] = 11.14, p &lt; 0.001, Î· p 2 = 0.004) where females scored lower ( M = 47.22, SD = 8.43) than males ( M = 49.97, SD = 7.96), but there was no significant interaction between group and sex at birth --( F [1, 2613] = 0.08, p = 0.775, Î· p 2 &lt; 0.001; Figure 1). Finally, we performed a binary logistic regression to confirm the expected negative link between well being and self --harm ( p &lt; 0.001). This showed that for every 1 unit increase in WEMWBS there was a 0.06 decrease in log odds of self harming. -

## Time block 23 -24 years

## Self harm age 24 -

We began at 24 years by looking at the same two initial questions probed at age 16. For the first question ( ' â¦ hurt yourself on purpose â¦ ' ? ) we found a significant groupwise difference among males ( Ï 2 (1) = 4.31, p = 0.038) and also among females ( Ï 2 (1) = 35.86, p &lt; 0.001). In both cases, misophonics were significantly more likely to self harm compared to nonmisophonics (Table 6). -

We next looked at the same embedded question asked at 16 years, related to self harm with the intention to die ( -' â¦ have ever you seriously wanted to kill yourself? ). Numbers were again small, and ' there were no groupwise differences among males ( Ï 2 (1) = 1.43, p = 0.232) but we found a significant effect for females ( Ï 2 (1) = 6.88, p = 0.009) where female misophonics self harmed with intent to die -more often than nonmisophonics (Table 7).

Finally we looked at the question about suicidal ideation asked of the entire samples at 24 years ( Have you ever thought of killing ' yourself, even if you would not really do it? ). Although there was no ' groupwise difference among males ( Ï 2 (1) = 1.42, p = 0.234) we found

## Well being age 23 -

Our between groups -MANOVA crossed group (misophonic, nonmisophonic) and sex at birth (female, male) predicting four well being ---measures (Subjective Happiness Scale [SHS]/subjective happiness; SWLF/life satisfaction; WEMWBS well being; -ONS4 well being; -Figure 2). Significant multivariate effects were found for group ( F [4, 2837] = 4.99, p &lt; .001, Î· p 2 = 0.007) and sex at birth --( F [4, 2837] = 4.93, p &lt; 0.001, Î· p 2 = 0.007), and for the interaction between group and sex at birth ( --F [4, 2837] = 2.61, p = 0.034, Î· p 2 = 0.004).

Subsequent univariate ANOVAs showed that misophonics had significantly poorer well being than nonmisophonics in all four well --being measures, first in subjective happiness scores ( F [1, 2840] = 17.70 p &lt;0.001, Î· p 2 =0.006) where their mean was M = 17.87 (SD = 5.71) compared to nonmisophonics ( M =19.78 SD = 5.01). Life satisfaction

showed the same main effect of group ( F [1, 2840] = 5.03 p = 0.028, Î· p 2 = 0.002) where misophonics ( M =21.98, SD = 6.86) again reported lower satisfaction than nonmisophonics ( M =24.11, SD = 6.54). Similarly, misophonics had lower well being in the WEMWBS ( -M = 45.80, SD=9.77) compared to nonmisophonics ( M =49.38, SD = 8.77; F [1, 2840] = 11.64 p &lt; 0.001, Î· p 2 =.004). And finally, they also had lower well being -( M = 23.25, SD=5.51) than nonmisophonics ( M = 24.63, SD=4.96) on the ONS4 ( F [1, 2840] = 7.94 p =0.004, Î· p 2 = 0.003).

There was no main effect of sex at birth for subjective happiness --( F [1, 2840] = 0.91, p =0.339, Î· p 2 =&lt;0.001), nor in satisfaction with life ( F [1, 2840] = 0.17 p =0.682, Î· p 2 =&lt;0.001), nor in the ONS4 ( F [1, 2840] = 0.93 p =0.336, Î· p 2 =&lt;0.001). However females scored lower in their WEMWBS ( [1, 2840] = 4.06 F p =0.044, Î· p 2 =0.001) with a mean of 48.76 (SD = 8.84) compared to males who scored M =49.91 (SD = 8.98).

There were no (group Ã sex at birth) interaction effects for three --of our four well being -measures: subjective happiness ( F [1, 2840] = 0.10, p = 0.757, Î· p 2 = &lt;0.001), WEMWBS ( [1, 2840] = 0.93 F p = 0.334, Î· p 2 = &lt;0.001), or ONS4 ( F [1, 2840] = 0.02 p = 0.881, Î· p 2 = &lt;0.001). However, there was a significant interaction for Life

Satisfaction ( F [1, 2840] = 3.95 p = 0.047, Î· p 2 = 0.001), since misophonics had lower life satisfaction -in the female group ( p &lt; 0.001, which survives the corrected Î± ) but not the male group ( p = 0.710) using the Bonferroni test. This is illustrated in Figure 2 (bottom right). -

## DISCUSSION

Our study examined adult participants from a large birth cohort who were screened at 28 years for misophonia, and then examined retrospectively on measures they had already completed at 16 -17 and 23 -24 years. We found that female misophonics aged 16 -17 years were more likely to have suicidal thinking than nonmisophonics (i.e., that life was not worth living), and were self harming more --although at this age they did not show more tendency to self harm -with intent to die . Nonetheless, by the age of 24 years, female misophonics were again thinking more about suicide, and self -harming more than their nonmisophonic peers, but additionally, they were now also more likely to self harm with a serious intent to die -(i.e., more so than nonmisophonics). They were also now joined by male misophonics in self harming -more than their nonmisophonic peers at 24 years. Our study therefore provides support for previous assumptions of self harm -in case studies 22,24,25 or as descriptive statistics, 30 or in early random sampling methods. -31

Given these higher risks in the misophonia group, we also found poorer well being -across multiple measures and time points -(WEMWBS at age 17, and the same at 23 in addition to the SWLS, SHS, and ONS4), covering multiple facets of well being -(hedonic/ affective, eudemonic, evaluative, and life satisfaction). We found significantly lower scores for misophonics in both males and females at both 17 and 23 years. This was true in all measures except Life Satisfaction at 23 years, which was the only measure to show negative effects for female misophonics but not male (perhaps because life satisfaction is typically lower for males in general, introducing a floor effect; see Figure 2). 63 Overall, our findings present a clear picture of poorer well being in misophonics. -

WEMWBS also showed a main effect of gender, and SWLS showed an interaction.

Misophonia is often assumed to manifest in early adolescence, several years prior to our earliest testing period. 14,23,64 -66 This makes it likely that members of our cohort were already expressing misophonia at 16 17 years --although one important limitation of our study is that we cannot know for sure (because we screened for misophonia at 28). An alternative interpretation is that poorer well -being (and greater self harm in females) at age 16 might have been -associated with the disposition for misophonia, whether misophonia has already emerged or not. Future studies might engage in large -scale screening with a longer assessment targeting a very large sample of adolescents in order to identify those with misophonia in real time, and then following them over time. Since we have done similar large scale screening with other sensory differences -67 we do not underestimate its enormous challenges, and therefore recognize both the limitations and strengths of our study.

Another possible limitation is that our group sizes were sometimes small, despite screening over 4000 participants for misophonia, of which 3000 had additionally completed our self -harm/well being measures in earlier time slots. Small group sizes are --the natural consequence of studying rare traits (self harm) within rare -populations (with misophonia). Nonetheless, we have the distinct advantage of testing randomly sampled participants (as far as misophonia is concerned) since we did not rely on misophonics to self refer, -and we did not recruit from clinics, where the most extreme cases are likely to gather. Hence a key strength of our own study is that we make a meaningful epidemiological link between misophonia on the one hand, and poor well being and elevated self --harm on the other.

Our study shows that self harm and suicidal ideation were higher -in the misophonia group, but the reasons are not yet definitively clear. So although higher self harm could be the result of a daily onslaught of -unpleasant sensory experiences (misophonia), it could equally be the result of the depression or anxiety which accompanies misophonia. But the critical first step is to identify that this group is indeed at risk -and this was the aim of our paper (using random sampling). As such, our work now suggests that clinical professionals might therefore engage in an active screening for self harm or suicidal ideation in any -patient where misophonia is confirmed (see Aazh &amp; Moore 68 , for a similar suggestion in tinnitus). Future studies may also now ask a separate question, which is why does this happen? A relevant approach might be to conduct clinical mental health screening alongside random misophonia sampling, showing potential links between misophonia and self harm via the mediation of, say, anxiety or depression. Finally, since -self harm in misophonia may be exacerbated by poor understanding of -misophonia itself, we also flag the reader to our online information hub (www.misophonia-hub.org).

In summary, both male and female misophonics showed poorer well being -in multiple ways. They also self harmed -more than nonmisophonics from age 16 in females and from age 24 in males, and with female misophonics having a greater intent to die (than nonmisophonics) emerging from 24 years. We conclude that misophonia is accompanied by important differences in well being -and self harm, -emerging from the teens onwards. We therefore propose better understanding and screening for people with misophonia in this regard.
