## ABSTRACT

## ARTICLE HISTORY

Objective: It  is  thought  that  decreased  sound  tolerance  can  be  subdivided  into  distinct  types  including misophonia  (involving  specific  trigger  sounds)  and  hyperacusis  (broader  in  profile).  However,  there  are few  established  methods  for  differentially  assessing  these  disorders  and  this  is  complicated  by  the  fact that some measures (e.g. the HQ Hyperacusis Questionnaire) were developed before the concept of misophonia was accepted.

Design/Study  sample: We  took  a  group  of N ¼ 119  participants  with  misophonia  (varying  in  severity) and asked them about the presence of hyperacusis (based on a scoping review definition).

Results: Scores  for  some  items  on  the  HQ  were  correlated  with  scores  for  misophonia  severity  (e.g.  social impact  of  sound)  and  others  with  scores  for  hyperacusis  (e.g.  ability  to  concentrate  in  noise).  Similarly, some  trigger  sounds  were  more  indicative  of  hyperacusis  (e.g.  dishes  being  stacked)  and  others  were more indicative of misophonia in the absence of hyperacusis (e.g. chewing).

Conclusions: These  double  dissociations  provide  compelling  evidence  for  separable  forms  of  sound intolerance.  Moreover,  our  research  suggests  that  a  single-item  question  about  hyperacusis  is  associated with other characteristics of hyperacusis, even when assessed 18 months later.

## Introduction

An intolerance of sounds can occur in the presence of other hearing abnormalities  (such  as  tinnitus  or  hearing  loss)  but  can  also  be found for some people in the general population with no other auditory abnormality (Baguley and Hoare 2018; Paulin, Andersson, and Nordin 2016; Sheldrake, Diehl, and Schaette 2015). Decreased sound tolerance is more prevalent in certain neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g.  autism  spectrum  disorder;  Ren  et  al.,  2021;  Williams,  et  al. 2021) even where there is no reason to suspect audiological problems  as  a  root  cause,  and  decreased  sound  tolerance  may  also  be comorbid with psychological problems (e.g. anxiety), which potentially have an exacerbating effect (e.g. Andermane et al., 2023a).

the  extent  to  which  sound  intolerance  affects  daily  living,  as  an indicator of clinical severity (Khalfa et al. 2002). Despite the name, however, we suggest that the HQ should today be considered as a measure  of  a mixed class  of  sound  intolerances,  including  -  but crucially  not  limited  to  -  hyperacusis.  We  show  how  the  HQ assesses both hyperacusis and another condition, misophonia, and suggest this has arisen simply from a historical shift in the semantic boundaries of the word 'hyperacusis'.

The term  'hyperacusis'  has  historically  been  used  as  a  general umbrella term to denote lower tolerance to sounds, across multiple possible aetiologies. Patients with  hyperacusis  typically report everyday  sounds  as  feeling  too  loud,  and  when  presented  with pure  tones,  judge  them  to  be  uncomfortable  at  a  lower  loudness level  than  people  without  hyperacusis  (Aazh  and  Moore  2017). ICD-10 describes  hyperacusis  as  'an  abnormally  disproportionate increase in the sensation of loudness in response to auditory stimuli  of  normal  volume.'  (World  Health  Organization  1993).  Some people  with  hyperacusis  also  report  that  sounds  induce  pain, although  this  is  neither  a  universal  nor  defining  characteristic (Williams,  Suzman,  and  Woynaroski  2021).  Questionnaires  such as the Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ) have been developed as a self-report measure of the symptomatology of sound tolerance and

There  has  been  significant  recent  interest  in  the  idea  that decreased  sound  tolerance  can  be  subdivided  into  distinct  types, such that the term hyperacusis has recently come to be restricted to one  profile with a second  profile (misophonia)  alongside (Swedo et al. 2022). Notably, Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2002) proposed the term misophonia to denote decreased tolerance to specific  trigger  sounds,  largely  eating  sounds  such  as  chewing  and repetitive sounds such as tapping. In this conceptualisation, hyperacusis  is  essentially  the  residual  sounds  outside  this  category, much broader in nature,  but  largely  sounds  with  high  amplitude or  frequency,  and  easily  construed  as  'too  loud'.  A  recent  Delphi consensus  definition  of  misophonia  described  it  as  'a  disorder  of decreased  tolerance  to  specific  sounds  or  stimuli  associated  with such  sounds.  These  stimuli,  known  as  'triggers',  are  experienced as  unpleasant  or  distressing  and  tend  to  evoke  strong  negative emotional,  physiological,  and  behavioural  responses  that  are  not seen in most other people. Misophonic responses do not seem to be  elicited  by  the  loudness  of  auditory  stimuli,  but  rather  by  the specific pattern or meaning to an individual.' (Swedo et al. 2022).

## KEYWORDS

Hyperacusis;  misophonia; differential  diagnosis; questionnaire

Several questionnaires have been developed to diagnose misophonia  (Rosenthal  et  al.  2021;  Simner,  Rinaldi,  and  Ward  2024;  Wu et  al.  2014).  However,  the  extent  to  which  they  may  also  assess hyperacusis  is  unknown.  Similarly,  measures  such  as  the  HQ (Hyperacusis Questionnaire) were developed before the concept of misophonia became accepted and it is uncertain whether the HQ assess hyperacusis as a distinct entity in the more recent sense, or whether it assesses a generic sound intolerance (akin to the more historical  interpretation  of  the  term).  A  recent  scoping  definition of  hyperacusis  in  its  contemporary  restrictive  sense,  formed  by reviewing the extant literature, defined it as 'everyday sounds feel overwhelming, loud,  intense,  or  painful  that  do  not  bother  other people in the same way' (Fackrell et al. 2017). In the present study, this definition served as a 'ground truth' with which to assess the performance  of  other  measures.  But  it  is  worth  noting  that  a Delphi  consensus  definition  of  hyperacusis  provided  a  much broader  conceptualisation:  'A  reduced  tolerance  to  sound(s)  that are perceived as normal to the majority of the population or were perceived as normal to the person before their onset of hyperacusis' (Adams  et  al.  2021).  This  consensus  definition,  produced amongst  clinicians,  is  similar  to  its  historical  meaning  and  does not  straightforwardly  capture  a  distinction  between  hyperacusis and misophonia.

The  aim  of  our  study  was  to  take  a  measure  of  misophonia (the  Sussex  Misophonia  Scale,  SMS;  Simner,  Rinaldi,  and  Ward 2024) and a measure of hyperacusis (based on the scoping review definition)  and  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  other  measures (such as the HQ) differentially assess  hyperacusis or misophonia. Our  sample  was  recruited  from  a  previous  study  of  participants with  misophonia  with  a  range  of  severities,  who  were  also  asked about  hyperacusis  (reporting  it  to  various  degrees  based  on  the scoping  review  definition).  To  pre-empt  our  findings,  we  show that  some items on the HQ are indicative of misophonia severity and  others  of  hyperacusis.  Similarly,  some  trigger  sounds  are more  indicative  of  misophonia  (e.g.,  swallowing,  chewing)  and others  are  more  indicative  of  hyperacusis  (e.g.  barking).  These double  dissociations  across  several  measures  provide  compelling evidence that these two clinical constructs have distinct features.

## Method

## Participants

Participants with complete datasets comprised 119 adults aged 1870 years (mean age ¼ 44.8, S.D. ¼ 14.3; 79.0% female, 18.5% male, 2.5%  non-binary).  All  had  self-identified  as  having  misophonia and had been recruited and tested for misophonia as part of previous research (Andermane et al., 2023a), as detailed below. Specifically, they had joined our participant pool following a BBC radio interview on misophonia was aired on May 18, 2021, during which listeners were invited to contact us. All participants agreed that  the  following  statement  applied  to  them  'Misophonia:  When sounds (e.g. crunching) consistently cause extreme emotions like  anger  or  disgust  which  does  not  bother  other  people  in  the same way.' They were heterogeneous in terms of severity of misophonia as indicated by the total score on the SMS (mean ¼ 83.7, S.D. ¼ 23.1, range ¼ 37-139) where a score of &gt; 50.5 is an optimised cut-off for binary classification (Simner, Rinaldi, and Ward 2024).  For  the  hyperacusis  screener  (see  below),  47%  (66/119)  of our  sample  reported  that  this  applied  to  them  ( N ¼ 26  'definitely does  apply', N ¼ 40  'may  apply', N ¼ 27  'don't  think  it  applies', N ¼ 26 'definitely does not apply'). The participants did not undertake an audiological assessment but they were required to indicate that they had no known hearing loss as this was an exclusion criterion for the study.

The  study  was  approved  by  the  Sciences  and  Technology Cross-Schools  Research  Ethics  and  Governance  Committee  of the University of Sussex (reference: ER/JAMIEW/32).

## Materials  and  procedure

Our initial assessment of misophonic participants used the Sussex  Misophonia  Scale,  SMS,  and  a  hyperacusis  screener  (see Andermane et al.  2023a).  This  latter  was  based  on  the  definition of hyperacusis  arising  from  the  scoping  review:  'Hyperacusis: When  everyday  sounds  feel overwhelming, loud, intense, or painful that do not bother other people in the same  way'. Participants  indicated  their  level  of  agreement  with  this  statement  on  a  four-point  Likert  scale  ('This  definitely  does  NOT apply  to  me',  'I  don't  think  this  applies  to  me',  'This  may  apply to  me',  'This  definitely  DOES  apply  to  me').  The  SMS  is  a  twopart questionnaire, firstly presenting 48 specific triggers for misophonia  (e.g.  chewing  sounds)  with  a  checkbox  judgement  and, secondly,  39  Likert-type  questions  about  the  associated  experiences  of people  with  misophonia  (e.g.,  feelings,  behaviours,  life consequences)  (Simner,  Rinaldi,  and  Ward  2024).  The  48  potential triggers  for  misophonia  are  grouped  into  eight  categories (e.g.  'I  hate …  the  sound  of  people  eating')  followed  by  sub-category  items  (e.g.  'crunchy  foods  (e.g.  apples)',  'crispy  snacks', 'chewing'  etc.).  In  creating  the  SMS,  three  sounds  that  were  initially  included  ('car  engines',  'house  and  car  alarms',  and  'sirens (e.g.  ambulance)') were discarded as they were assumed to reflect hyperacusis.  Here  we  test  that  assumption  because  the  current participants  had  these  extra  items  included.  The  39  Likert-type items  (e.g.  'I  avoid  going  to  work  because  of  difficulties  with sounds')  are  rated  on  a  five-point  Likert  scale  and  coded  from 0-4  (Never,  Hardly  Ever,  Sometimes,  Often,  Always),  with  the total score ranging from  0-156. Simner, Rinaldi, and  Ward (2024)  showed  that  a  cut-off  value  of  50.5  on  the  SMS  has 'excellent'  discriminative  ability  between  misophonics  and  nonmisophonics (area-under-curve, AUC ¼ 0.91).  The  SMS  also  has strong convergent  validity, with scores being correlated with those for other misophonia  questionnaires such as the MQ (r ¼ 0.78), DVMSQ  (r ¼ 0.85), and  AMISO-S  (r ¼ 0.81) -see Supplementary Material.

Two further questionnaires relating to hyperacusis were administered  18 months  later,  using  Qualtrics  (Provo,  UT)  and taking  around  30 minutes  to  complete.  The  18 month  time  lag means  that  any  association  between  our  initial  assessment  of hyperacusis  and  misophonia  and  these  later  measures  presumably reflects enduring  traits. Both  later measures  purport  to measure  hyperacusis.  However,  the  first  (HQ;  Khalfa  et  al.  2002) was  created  before  the  narrowing  of  its  definition.  The  HQ  consists  of  14  items  answered  on  a  four-point  Likert  scale  (No,  Yes a  little,  Yes  quite  a  lot,  Yes  a  lot)  and  the  individual  items  are shown in Table 1. Total scores are calculated by summing across items  (coded  from  1  to  4)  although  here  we  also  analyse  at  the item  level.  We  also  used  relevant  items  from  a  second,  more recent  hyperacusis  questionnaire.  The  CORDS  (Coordination  of Rare  Diseases  at  Sanford)  hyperacusis  questionnaire,  reported  by Williams  et  al.  (2021),  contains  various  items  related  to  hyperacusis  and  loud  sound  exposure.  There  is  no  known  way  of  collapsing  items  (e.g.  into  factors  or  total  scores)  and  so  we  analyse them  separately.  The  following  items  were  used  noting  that  we changed the subject from 'the participant' to 'you' (e.g. the wording of the original question was 'Are everyday sounds unbearably

## Analyses

For  the  SMS  a  total  score  is  obtained  from  the  second  part  (39 Likert questions) by summing the responses (0-4 scale). The first part  of  the  SMS,  selection  of  triggers  (from  a  list  of  48),  is  not part  of  the  quantitative  assessment  of  misophonia  but  is  used  in a  secondary  analysis  exploring  how  trigger  profiles  may  differ

between  participants  with  and  without  hyperacusis,  noting  that we excluded five 'other' items (e.g. 'other repetitive sounds') leaving a final set of 43 (e.g. as shown in Figures 3, S2 and S3).

The method of Steiger (1980) was used to compare two correlations  within  the  same  sample  of  participants  (r 12 and  r 13 )  and considering  the  degree  of  relationship  between  the  two  measures (r 23 ). In  our  case,  we  are  comparing  the  correlations  between items  on  the  hyperacusis  measures  (HQ,  CORDS)  against  the SMS (r12)  and  hyperacusis  screener  (r13 ),  where  r 23 is  the  correlation  between  SMS  total  and  hyperacusis  screener  itself.  The  tand p-values  were  obtained  using  the  Excel  calculator  of  Zaiontz (2014), shared in Supplementary Material, and can also be obtained  in  R  using  the  r.test  function  in  the  Psych  package (Revelle 2017).

## Results

We remind the reader that our participants were all self-declared misophonics, additionally screened by the SMS  (misophonia scale),  a  hyperacusis  screener  (based  on  the  scoping  definition), and two other measures of hyperacusis (HQ; CORDS).

## Overall  HQ

The mean HQ total score for our misophonic group was 24.3 (± 7.2)  which  compares  against  published  population  norms  of  15.0 (±  6.7)  from  Khalfa  et  al.  (2002).  This  corresponds  to  a  significant difference (t ¼ 11.67, p &lt; .001) and  a large effect size (Hedge's  g ¼ 1.35).  Using  Khalfa  et  al.'s  (2002)  threshold  ( &gt; 28 score):  30%  of  our  misophonic  sample  would  be  classified  as having hyperacusis (36/119), if we were to base this classification solely  on  the  HQ.  Applying  Meeus  et  al.'s  (2010)  slightly  more lenient  threshold  ( &gt; 26  score)  would  raise  the  percentage  classified  as  having  hyperacusis  to  39.5%  (47/119).  The  correlation between the HQ total and the SMS total was a moderate and significant  ( r ¼ 0.49, p &lt; .001).  Nonetheless,  we  remind  the  reader that  the  HQ  was  devised  before  the  refinement  of  the  historical term 'hyperacusis' into two sub-classes of misophonia and (modern-use)  hyperacusis.  As  such,  it  is  not  surprising  that  a  high portion of misophonics score highly on the HQ.

The  correlation  between  the  HQ  total  and  scores  for  the hyperacusis screener question was moderate and significant ( r ¼ 0.41, p &lt; .001),  while  the  correlation  between  scores  for  the hyperacusis  screener  question  and  the  SMS  total  score  was  weak and not significant ( r ¼ 0.13, p ¼ 0.177).

## Item-level  HQ  correlations

The  correlations  between  responses  to  individual  items  on  the HQ (HQ1 to HQ14) and (a)  level  of  agreement  with  the  hyperacusis screening question and (b) the total SMS score were determined. Our aim was to determine the extent to which individual questions in the older HQ tapped into (modern uses of the terms for)  hyperacusis  and  misophonia.  The  difference  between  these correlations  was  therefore  used  to  determine  whether  the  items correlated significantly more  highly with one construct than another. The results are shown in Table 1. Scores for three items were  correlated  with  hyperacusis  significantly  more  than  with misophonia  (H � M),  and  scores  for  five  items  were  correlated significantly  more  with  misophonia  than  hyperacusis  (M � H). Scores  for  two  items  were  significantly  correlated  with  hyperacusis  but  not  misophonia,  although  the  difference  in  correlations was  not  significant  (H &gt; M).  There  were  four  items  for  which misophonia and hyperacusis could not be discriminated (M ¼ H):  scores  for  two  items  correlated  with  both,  and  scores for  two  were  correlated  with  neither.  In  summary,  whilst  the total  HQ  score  does  not  reliably  distinguish  between  hyperacusis and  misophonia  individual  items  showed  differential  sensitivity. Hyperacusis questions were related more to sound-based distraction  and  background  noise,  whereas  misophonia  questions  were related  more  to  social  impacts  of  sound.  Most  significant  differences  between  correlations  survived  correction  for  multiple  comparisons using the False Discovery Rate (only HQ3 did not).

## Other  hyperacusis  questions

The questions taken from Williams et al. (2021) were analysed in the  same  way.  The  results  are  shown  in  Table  2.  Scores  for  one question  were  more  sensitive  to  hyperacusis  than  misophonia (everyday sounds being loud), scores for two were equally related to  hyperacusis  and  misophonia  (pain,  ear  protection)  and  scores for  the  others  were  not  significantly  related  to  either.  The  SMS contains four questions relating to pain, but the association between  misophonia  severity  and  reports  of  pain  in  the  last 12 months  from  CORDS  remained  significant  (r ¼ 0.21, p ¼ .021) when these items were dropped.

Categorical dependent variables were analysed with chi-square taking  a  binary  split  of  participants  into  misophonics  with  and without  hyperacusis  (as  determined  by  the  hyperacusis  screening question). Figure 1 shows  the level of endorsement  for  the CORDS  trigger  sounds  contrasting  misophonics  with  and  without  hyperacusis.  There  were  13  sounds  (/20)  that  significantly distinguished between these groups, and in all cases this reflected greater levels of endorsement by those who reported hyperacusis. However,  when  considering  a  wider  pool  of  triggers  (those  used in  the  SMS)  there  were  some  sounds  that  were  more  strongly endorsed as triggers by those reporting misophonia  without hyperacusis (see below).

Those  with  hyperacusis  were  significantly  less  likely  to  have attended many loud concerts ( v 2 (1) ¼ 5.73, p ¼ 0.017) suggesting that  hyperacusis  modified  behaviour  in  this  sample  (as  opposed to hyperacusis being caused by loud concerts). Those with hyperacusis  were  significantly  more  likely  to  report  sensitive  teeth ( v 2 (1) ¼ 7.08, p ¼ 0.008).  The  fact  that  we  found  group  differences in both  directions  argues  against  a  simple  response  bias (over-reporting across all questions). The level of endorsement of these statements is shown in Figure 2

## SMS trigger profile

Our  earlier  research  included  the  hyperacusis  screener  question together  with  51  triggers  in  the  SMS:  48  were  assumed  to  be related to misophonia  and  three  to  hyperacusis  (Andermane et  al.,  2023a).  Figure  2 shows the level of endorsement for different  triggers  ranked  by  group  difference.  Some  triggers  were  significantly  more  endorsed  by  those  reporting  both  misophonia and hyperacusis ( N ¼ 5, house and car alarms, car engines, repetitive  barking,  typing,  sirens)  and  other  triggers  were  significantly  more  endorsed  by  those  reporting  misophonia  without hyperacusis  ( N ¼ 3, lip smacking,  swallowing,  chewing).  Thus, there  was  a  double  dissociation  across  trigger  sounds.  A  similar pattern  was  found  in  a  reanalysis  of  the  full  dataset  reported  by Andermane  et  al. (2023a) as reported in the supplementary material.

## Discussion

The  term  hyperacusis  was  historically  applied  to  all  forms  of decreased sound tolerances, across a range of aetiologies (with or without  known  hearing  disorders)  and  presenting  characteristics. The  term  misophonia  was  later  introduced  to  designate  a  subtype  linked  to  specific  sound  triggers,  irrespective  of  loudness

(e.g.,  chewing). Although this has been hypothesised for two decades, quantitative evidence for this distinction is extremely sparse. Current consensus definitions of hyperacusis, from clinicians,  do  not  make  a  clear  delineation  between  hyperacusis and  misophonia  (Adams  et  al.  2021)  and  some  commonly  used measures  such  as  the  HQ  (Hyperacusis  Questionnaire)  were  not designed with these subtypes in mind  (Khalfa et al. 2002).

A  recent  summary  of  the  field  notes:  'the  results  of  reported studies  [on  misophonia]  are  corrupted  by  the  lack  of  exclusion from  the  evaluated  group  of  subjects  with  hyperacusis.'  (Page  5,

Jastreboff  and  Jastreboff  2023).  The  approach  taken  here  was  to examine a sample of people with misophonia, varying in severity, who  also  presented  with  hyperacusis  to  varying  degrees  and  to

determine which of these two independent variables predicts performance  on  the  HQ,  as  well  as  endorsement  of  sound  triggers and  other  characteristics  (e.g. sound-induced  pain,  and  painrelated conditions). Participants' level of agreement to a researcher-derived definition of hyperacusis from a scoping review (Fackrell et al. 2017) was used as a ground truth. Responses  to  this  single-item  question  are  associated  with  other characteristics  of  (narrowly  defined)  hyperacusis,  independently of  misophonia,  even  when  assessed  18 months  later.  For  misophonia,  we  used  a  validated  questionnaire  (Simner,  Rinaldi,  and Ward  2024)  which  has  good  convergent  validity,  scores  being correlated  with  other  recently  developed  measures  of  misophonia.  Although  the  total  score  for  the  HQ  was  correlated  with both  our  measure  of  hyperacusis  and  our  measure  of  misophonia, at the item level, there were double dissociations, some items tracking  misophonia  severity  and  others  tracking  hyperacusis. Misophonia  was  linked  more  to  the  social  impacts  of  sounds, and  hyperacusis  more  to  the  impact  of  noisy  surroundings  (e.g. on  concentration).  These  aversions  were  both  linked  to  avoidance behaviours: misophonics were more likely to report turning down  social  invitations  because  of  the  sounds  (reported  on  the HQ),  and  those  with  hyperacusis  were  less  likely  to  attend  loud concerts  (reported  on  the  CORDS  questions).  Sound-induced pain  was  linked  to  both  misophonia  and  hyperacusis,  although people  with  hyperacusis  reported  more  sensitive  teeth.  Tooth sensitivity  is  conventionally  defined  as  brief  episodes  of  sharp well-localized  pain  when  teeth  are  subjected  innocuous  stimuli such  as  cold,  air-currents  or  probing  with  a  metallic  instrument (Markowitz  and  Pashley  2008).  Another  candidate  hearing  disorder linked to jaw pain is Tensor Tympani Syndrome (Westcott et al.  2013).

One  possible  way  of  conceptualising  the  difference  between misophonia  and  hyperacusis  is  that  misophonia  is  narrow  in terms  of  the  range  of  sounds  that  elicit  it  and  hyperacusis  is broad (perhaps encompassing all sounds if they are loud enough).  However,  this  idea  remains  largely  untested,  and  our evidence  suggests  that  the  difference  could  also  relate  to  the nature  of  the  sounds  themselves  (rather  than  the  number  of sounds  that  typically  act  as  triggers).  There  were  some  sounds (lip  smacking,  swallowing,  chewing)  that  bothered  people  with 'pure  misophonia'  (i.e.  without  hyperacusis)  more  than  those who had both.  And  there  were  other  sounds  that  were  linked  to hyperacusis  more  than  misophonia.  These  latter  included  prototypically  loud  sounds  (e.g.  sirens,  power  tools,  lawnmowers)  but also  sounds  that  might  not  be  considered  so  (e.g.  typing  on  a keyboard).  Note  that  responses  to  played  sounds  of  typing  were also  predictive  of  hyperacusis,  independently  of  misophonia,  in  a separate study (Andermane et al. 2023b). Research is needed that presents  some  of  these  sounds  at  different  loudness  levels  to understand  the  relative  contribution  of  these  factors.  Do  sirens bother  people  with  hyperacusis  more  than  other  people  even when presented at a low level? Is the nature of the response (e.g. pain,  anxiety)  different?  Is  this  the  case  for  all  sounds  or  are sirens and certain other sounds special in some way?

The  status  of  painful  responses  to  sound  in  hyperacusis  and misophonia  is  also uncertain. Although  pain  has  often  been linked  to  hyperacusis,  it  is  not  considered  a  defining  property. Our research suggests  that  the  same  may  also  apply  to  misophonia.  In  the  present  study  reports  of  pain  were  correlated  both with  misophonia  severity  and  hyperacusis  (the  correlations  did not  differ  significantly  in  magnitude  from  each  other).  The  same held true when a small number of items in the misophonia questionnaire  that  explicitly  mentioned  pain  were  dropped  (e.g.  'It hurts  when  I  hear  certain  sounds,  even  if  it  doesn't  hurt  other people').  Although pain appeared as a separate factor in the SMS questionnaire, the association with  more  conventional  factors (e.g. intersocial reactivity) was strong (Simner, Rinaldi, and Ward  2024).  Individual  differences  in  responses  to  these  pain questions  are  partially  separable  from  the  overall  misophonia severity  and  hyperacusis  status  based  on  the  ratings  of  sounds (Andermane et al. 2023b). Our speculation is that painful responses to sounds can be linked to both hyperacusis and misophonia  and  need  not  reflect  one  more  than  the  other.  Whether the presence of pain is simply related to severity or to some additional variable remains for future research to determine.

There are a number of limitations to be recognised. As participants were self-selected they may  not be representative of decreased  sound  tolerances  within  either  the  general  population or  those  recruited  as  a  result  of  clinical  diagnosis.  Of  course  the latter group  may  themselves  have  distinct  characteristics  (e.g., co-comorbidities)  that  drives  treatment  seeking.  Further  studies should seek to replicate findings in opportunistic samples as well as contrasting  against  clinically  diagnosed  samples.  Moreover, there  are  many  definitions  and  ways  of  assessing  both  misophonia and hyperacusis and the extent to which the patterns observed here are tied to the specific  measures used is uncertain. For  example,  hyperacusis  could  be  measured  in  terms  of  lower loudness  discomfort  thresholds  and  other  audiological  assessments  (e.g.  speech-in-noise)  may  be  informative.  Definitions  of these conditions are likely to evolve in light of new evidence, just as  the  original  definition  of  hyperacusis  was  changed  to  recognise previously unclassified heterogeneity (now classified as misophonia).

Moving  forwards,  researchers  interested  in  measuring  hyperacusis  (as  distinct  from  misophonia)  may  use  the  subset  of  questions  identified  in  the  HQ  rather  than  the  entire  scale  (these  are listed  again  in  the  Supplementary  Material).  Secondary  datasets where  the  HQ  can  be  split  could  also  be  reanalysed  in  light  of the  present  results.  Other  measures  are  available  that  have  been developed that target hyperacusis as a distinct entity to misophonia  and  are  broadly  in  line  with  the  research  presented  here  (e.g. Aazh  et  al.,  2022).  This  latter  measure,  the  HIQ  (Hyperacusis Impact  Questionnaire),  contains  eight  items.  None  relate  specifically  to  the  social  impact  of  sounds  but  tend  to  relate  to  the ability to function (concentrate, relax, etc.) in noisy places.

In  summary, the  study  provide  evidence  that  misophonia  and hyperacusis  are  at  least  partially  dissociable  entities  with  distinct profiles relating to trigger sounds  and  effects on real-world behaviour.
