Green space ABSTRACT  
In landscape planning and policy-making, environmental sounds have only negative impacts on human health. 
The natural sounds that promote healthy and supportive environments remain neglected. Although the sound -
scape concept and approach have considered natural sounds as a resource, the related knowledge has not been 
employed in landscape planning yet. The purpose of this study is to advance existing state of knowledge to 
synthesize common preferences for soundscape resources, and then to propose an assessment method for 
landscape planning. We introduce a planning-oriented soundscape resource evaluation framework to guide a 
PRISMA systematic literature review. The review includes an in-depth analysis of 74 peer-reviewed journal 
articles and a meta-analysis for 21 of them. We find that (1) current research has under-explored the soundscape 
with regard to spatiotemporal evolution, health benefits, and preferences and values; (2) in green spaces, people 
from different sociocultural contexts exhibit common preferences for soundscape resources. According to these, 
soundscape formal characters tend towards naturalness, diversity, and appropriateness; (3) exposure to natural 
sounds does have positive effects on human health and well-being, but the degree of the effects was varied. In 
addition to birdsongs and water sounds, wind-induced vegetation sounds also have high values. Based on these 
findings, we suggest basic natural sound scores and categorized indicators for evaluating NSES. It can be 
implemented in Geographic Information System to produce place-based and comparable results under uncer -
tainty. The results can help landscape planners better consider the contribution of the acoustic environment to 
human health, well-being, and quality of life, protect the areas of high-quality soundscape resources without 
actual human uses, and reveal the differences between the actual provision of aesthetic values and demands for 
nature-based recreation.   
1.Introduction 
Natural sounds have been neglected in landscape planning (LP) until 
now, in spite of their obvious positive impact on people ’s health and 
well-being (Aletta et al., 2018; Derryberry et al., 2020; Tong and Kang, 
2021 ). This is surprising, because LP as a strong forward-looking action 
to enhance, restore, and create landscapes (Council of European, 2000 ), 
is concerned with protecting natural processes and significant cultural 
and natural assets (Ogrin, 2010 ). Natural sounds and their compositions 
are part of those valuable assets, because they are a dynamic property 
and resource of ecosystems (Carson, 1962 ), which are worthy of pro-
tection in many national parks, reserves, and wilderness areas (NPS, 
2006; Harbrow et al., 2011; Gale et al., 2021 ). In order to protect landscape assets, functions or ecosystem services (ES), LP evaluates 
different qualities of biodiversity and ES including landscape aesthetic 
quality (LAQ) (Hermes et al., 2018 ), assesses impacts of existing and 
planned land uses (Mace et al., 1999 ), and proposes measures for 
landscape restoration (de Groot et al., 2010 ). Whereas current LP or 
environmental impact assessment (EIA), especially the LAQ assessment, 
only considers the impact of noise, the natural sounds, positively 
perceived by people and as an essential motivation to visit natural areas 
(Wenny et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2019 ), are not included in the assessment. 
These gaps not only waste an opportunity for strengthening the argu-
ments for protecting valuable ecosystems and landscapes, but also 
deprive the quality of natural environment of an effective protection 
that may importantly contribute to human nature-based experiences and

2well-being (Hermes et al., 2021 ). 
In response, landscape planners should consider people ’s common 
preferences and needs for the acoustic environment of nature, based on 
their general perception of certain sound features. However, although 
CICES V5.1 (Haines-Young and Potschin, 2018 ) has talked about the 
enjoyed sounds in the group “physical and experiential interactions with 
natural environment ”, natural sounds still do not receive enough 
attention in the ES context. The concept of “soundscape ” (ISO, 2014 ) is 
helpful for improving such a state, since it emphasizes the relationship 
between human perception and the acoustic environment, and chiefly 
focuses on the meaningful sound compositions rather than equating 
sounds with noises (Brown et al., 2011 ). In fact, similar to natural 
landscapes, the natural soundscape resource contributes to providing 
the setting or condition that enables aesthetic experiences and nature- 
based recreation activities (Axelsson, 2015; Hong et al., 2019b; Liu 
et al., 2019 ), therefore promoting people ’s health and well-being 
(Barber et al., 2016 ). Such benefits afforded to people by nature 
belong to the ES realm (Bratman et al., 2012; Francis et al., 2017 ). In this 
context, natural sound and soundscape resources should be treated as an 
integral part of biodiversity (Davies et al., 2020; Holgate et al., 2021 ) 
and ES (MEA, 2005; TEEB, 2010 ), especially cultural ecosystem services 
(CES) in LP. 
In order to find a methodological way to include natural sounds and 
sound compositions into LP, we have to understand how LP basically 
works and where possible entry points are. Methodologically, LP in-
corporates the evaluation of landscape functions (as of yet ES and 
biodiversity), projecting possible changes of landscape (values), 
deducting objectives and measures to maintain landscape qualities (ES), 
and restoring them with regard to driving forces, pressures and impacts of landscape change (Albert et al., 2016 ). To this end, modelling in 
Geographic Information System (GIS) is employed, which is based on a 
set of practice-oriented methods (Haaren et al., 2019 ) and usually based 
on easily derived spatial information. This under-complex modelling is 
necessary, because LP has to bridge the gap between science and prac-
tical implementation, thus having to produce place-based, comparable 
(scaled) results under uncertainty (Neuendorf et al., 2018 ). Compara -
bility of ES values and impairments is needed in practice to derive pri-
orities for actions and to define the space for public participation. 
Against this backdrop, an approach to sound assessment will also possess 
such abilities and is preferably based on readily available information. 
Integration of natural sounds into LP thus should be sought both in as-
sessments of LAQ and in EIAs, if soundscape resources are threatened by 
planned land use changes or already deteriorated. Such integration of-
fers the chance to improve the aesthetic value (Wang and Zhao, 2019 ) as 
well as the quality of nature-based recreation (Liu et al., 2018a ), thus 
providing restorative benefits for individuals and collectives (Fisher 
et al., 2021 ). In general, it may contribute to the conservation of the 
natural environment (Doser et al., 2020 ). Finally, landscape planners 
can deduce sound-related objectives and measures and therefore 
communicate with stakeholders. 
However, it remains insufficient that the state of knowledge 
regarding methods for incorporating the assessment of soundscape re-
sources into planning phases, since established methods and standards 
are only for assessing disturbing noise. For instance, the Environmental 
Noise Directive (END 2002/49/EC ) was the first EU policy concerning the 
assessment and management of environmental noise (Directive, 2002 ). 
Based on this, the Good Practice Guides were published to help related 
authorities undertake noise mapping (WG-AEN, 2006 ) and quiet area

judgment for common preferences of soundscape resources (based on ISO, 2014, 2018, 2019; Ribeiro et al., 2019 ). Z. Chen et al.

3identification (EEA, 2014 ). Similar regulations also exist in, e.g., Ger-
many (TA Larm, 1998 ), the US (Menge et al., 1998 ), the UK (Defra, 
2010 ), and China (HJ 2.4, 2009 ). Nevertheless, all of these solely focus 
on noise aspects. Only recently, the Welsh government published the 
Noise and Soundscape Action Plan, which firstly involves the soundscape 
matter (Welsh Government, 2018 ), but only introduces the masking 
effect of the natural soundscape on noises. On the other hand, scientists 
have gradually made progress in identifying positive aspects of the 
soundscapes (van Kempen et al., 2014; Aletta et al., 2018; Hong et al., 
2020a ). A good example is the Positive Soundscape Project , which ac-
knowledges the importance of positive soundscapes in urban planning 
(Davies et al., 2007 ), but is still inadequate in evaluating the soundscape 
resources of nature for LP. A major current limitation is that existing 
soundscape approaches, such as interviews, soundwalks, and laboratory 
experiments (ISO, 2018 ), are mainly based on individuals ’ responses to 
soundscape features. Besides, they are weather-dependent, time- 
consuming, and cost-intensive (Votsi et al., 2017 ). Despite such pro-
gresses having made contributions to noise mitigation and expanded 
concerns about positive sounds, they are not planning-oriented and the 
results are neither comparable nor across LP spatial units (e.g., biotope 
or habitat), and they do not fully explore the potential of integrating 
natural sounds into LP from ES perspectives (Haaren et al., 2019 ). 
The aim of this paper is to review and advance the state of knowledge 
regarding the evaluation of soundscape resources for LP. To this end, we 
(1) provide a planning-oriented soundscape resource evaluation (PSRE) 
framework based on a practice-oriented ES evaluation model (Haaren 
et al., 2014; Albert et al., 2016 ), to consider the soundscape resource 
evaluation from the ES perspective, (2) conduct a PSRE-guiding sys-
tematic review to synthesize evidence of people ’s preferences for 
soundscape compositions in green spaces, and to examine the values of 
various natural sounds, based on the effect sizes of natural sounds on 
human health and well-being, and (3) discuss review results and then 
propose an initial assessment approach, which could be a supplement to 
the current LAQ assessment and EIAs in LP. 
2.Towards a Planning-oriented soundscape resource evaluation 
(PSRE) framework 
We adapted the practice-oriented ES evaluation (PRESET) model to 
include and highlight the evaluation of soundscape resource in order to 
set up a “Planning-oriented Soundscape Resource Evaluation (PSRE) ” 
framework (Fig. 1). The main features of this PSRE are outlined as fol-
lows. The center is nature-based soundscape ecosystem services (NSES), 
a CES (Haines-Young and Potschin, 2018 ), that can be understood as the 
direct and indirect contributions from soundscape resources of ecosys -
tems to humans (MEA, 2005; TEEB, 2010 ). It consists of both those 
“offered ” by ecosystems and those actually “utilized ” by humans (Albert 
et al., 2016 ). The offered NSES represents the aesthetic pleasure that 
arises from the state of harmony between the imaginative representation 
of soundscape resources (a Natural Capital) and people ’s understanding. 
Such pleasure may provide benefits to people but not necessarily 
currently utilized (Haaren et al., 2014 ). This means that the offered 
NSES is a special “formal quality ” dependent on the perceptual prop-
erties of soundscape resources, as is the case with LAQ (Hermes et al., 
2018 ). It is a formal purposiveness but not of function — purposiveness 
without purpose (Lothian, 1999 ). Utilized NSES are those that are 
actually enjoyed and/or appreciated by humans. The use may encom -
pass various activities that range from walking, hiking, and cycling in 
(semi-) natural surroundings to consciously experiencing soundscape 
resources, and such use may require human inputs (Haaren et al., 2014 ). 
This differentiation is important for planning as it allows for protecting 
high quality areas based on the public ’s benefits even without actual 
uses. It also reveals the difference between high demand for nature- 
based recreation and the actual provision of LAQ in areas such as 
urban fringes or countryside. 
We recommend, as a first explorative approach, applying intersubjective values instead of the non-use value proposed in the 
original PRESET concept (Haaren et al., 2014 ). The reason is that CES 
norms expressed in international legislation are non-existent for evalu -
ating NSES. Intersubjective values (not objectively proven as generally 
applicable but agreed upon by a majority of people) can refer to core 
preferences of soundscape compositions for the offered NSES that may 
even be common to all human beings (Hermes et al., 2018; Haaren et al., 
2019 ). This core can be deduced from the existing literature, and used to 
compare and rate offered NSES in different areas as an initial criterion. 
This can inform planning decisions in terms of protecting and main -
taining soundscape resources, and developing the tourism potential of a 
region. In addition, individual, local values and preferences can be 
captured by economic values that are primarily related to the utilized 
NSES and obtaining benefits (Albert et al., 2016 ). The valuation results 
of utilized NSES can be compared with the offered NSES for planning 
purposes. 
In addition, a judgment mechanism is employed here to indicate how 
to determine the common preferences for soundscape resources. Pref-
erences and perception are neither synonymous nor two separate di-
mensions. In fact, the perception process (auditory sensation and 
interpretation of it), generating responses that may have outcomes (ISO, 
2014; Aletta et al., 2018; Erfanian et al., 2019 ), is the cognitive foun-
dation that can influence preferences (Istv˘an, 2003 ). An important point 
to note here is that perception - the way people perceive a soundscape - 
is a process. It is influenced but not exclusively determined by the 
acoustic environment and context. Conversely, preferences are more 
directly related to the physical elements of the soundscape, such as 
liking or disliking the attributes of a certain soundscape element through 
the use (e.g., identifying, listening, or experiencing) of the acoustic 
environment. In this case, determining common soundscape preferences 
should also include the potential precursors that lead to preferences, i.e., 
responses and outcomes (Brown et al., 2011 ). 
3.Method 
Our systematic review adheres to the PRISMA 2020 (Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) method 
(Page et al., 2021 ). This approach is considered reliable and transparent 
in terms of collecting scientific evidence based on specific research 
questions (Mallett et al., 2012 ) and has also been used for relevant ev-
idence collection for soundscape studies (Aletta et al., 2018; Erfanian 
et al., 2019; Lionello et al., 2020 ). It reduces sampling bias by capturing 
all relevant empirical evidence, and it clearly articulates the eligibility 
criteria for each step, which allows verification and replication by other 
researchers (Liberati et al., 2009 ). The PSRE framework served as a 
guidance for the PRISMA-based systematic review. 
3.1. Eligibility criteria and search strategy 
The specific inclusion criteria included: (1) studies should include at 
least one measure for the determinants of common soundscape prefer -
ence; (2) studies should be observed in at least one green space 
(ecosystem) that can generate natural sounds, regardless of whether 
they are real, recorded, or virtual (ISO, 2018 ); and (3) reviewed papers 
should be published in an accessible peer-reviewed journal and written 
in English (Aletta et al., 2018; Erfanian et al., 2019 ). Based on the 
mechanism of judgment (Fig. 1), the common preference for soundscape 
resources is determined by: (1) direct preferences: like/dislike or prefer/ 
not prefer; (2) perceptual responses: positive (e.g., good, vibrant, 
pleasant, calm, or similar) or negative (e.g., bad, chaotic, annoying, 
monotonous, or similar) reactions and emotions (Axelsson et al., 2012; 
ISO, 2018 ); and (3) outcomes: restorativeness, stress recovery, and 
mood state (Aletta et al., 2018; Erfanian et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, we 
argue that the effect degree of natural sound on the three aspects above 
can be a reflection of the intersubjective values for evaluating NSES. 
Effects include improved (restorativeness and positive affection) and Z. Chen et al.

4reduced (stress and negative mood) effects due to exposure to natural 
sounds. 
We searched Scopus (https://scopus.com ) and Web of Science 
(https://webofknowledge.com ), which have been widely used to collect 
evidence on the practice of the disciplines of landscape architecture and 
urban planning (Kabisch et al., 2015; Wen et al., 2018 ). The search scope 
(“title”, “abstract ”, and “keywords ”) was set up for searching articles in 
both databases. The search terms were: (“sound* ” OR “soundscape* ”) 
AND (“perceive* ” OR “percept* ” OR “prefer* ”) AND (“natur* environ -
ment* ” OR “natur* area* ” OR “natur* surrounding* ” OR “natur* 
setting* ” OR “green* space* ” OR “green* area* ” OR “ecosystem* ” OR 
“habitat* ” OR “biotope* ”), where “*” is a wildcard character that rep-
resents all words with the same presented roots. The time frame was limited to 1 January 1990 until 1 October 2021. Each record retrieved 
was independently screened by the first author in accordance with in-
clusion criteria. Automation tools were used to filter out the peer- 
reviewed journal articles. 
3.2. Study selection and data extraction protocol 
Study selection was accomplished in three steps (Fig. 2): identifica -
tion, screening, and inclusion. Of the 85 articles initially screened from 
the databases, only one was not retrievable (Bjerke and Østdahl, 2005 ). 
Then, 54 eligible articles were selected after excluding 30 for specific 
reasons. Moreover, 20 additional articles that were relevant to the 
research questions but did not show up in the search results were added. 
Ultimately, a total of 74 eligible articles were selected for evidence 
synthesis, and 21 of them with randomized controlled trial (RCT) study 
design were used to perform a meta-analysis (West et al., 2008 ). The 
extracted data is shown in Table 1. 
3.3. Meta-analysis 
The risk of bias assessment indicated that the 21 studies were of good 
quality and could be used in the meta-analysis (for details see Fig. S1, 
Supplementary material ). The values in terms of M, SD, and sample size 
of these studies were extracted to compare and statistically analyze the 
effect degree of natural sounds. We built two models for improved and 
reduced effects separately. Because these data were continuous vari-
ables with non-uniform units, we used standardized mean differences 
(SMD, Cohen ’s d) as effect size measures (Magnusson, 2014 ), and 
random-effects models (Higgins et al., 2003 ) for pooling the outcome 
data of each effect separately. To account for the possibility of multiple 
comparisons and outcomes in a single study, the study ID was included 
Fig. 2.Workflow of the systematic literature based on the PRISMA approach (Page et al., 2021 ).

6as a random factor in each model (Buxton et al., 2021 ). Both models 
showed significant heterogeneity between effect sizes, i.e., I2 F50%, p 
D0.001. This may be due to the difference in sample size within the 
same natural sound source. We examined publication bias by visually 
assessing funnel plots( Supplementary material , Fig. S2), which are 
scatter plots of effect sizes versus their precision (Nakagawa and Santos, 
2012 ). The scatter plots seem to indicate publication bias, which may be 
because natural sounds do have significant effects on human health and 
well-being. In addition, we also performed sensitivity analysis (Copas 
and Shi, 2000 ) for both models, and all recalculated SMD values after 
removing any of the studies were within the 95% confidence interval 
(CI) of the combined values, which implies our results are reliable and 
robust. All statistical analyses were performed with STATA 16.0. 
4.Results 
4.1. General information 
We extracted general information from the 74 articles included. As 
shown in Fig. 3a to 3d, more than half of the total number of studies 
came from Europe (n 38), followed by Asia (n 19), only one study 
occurring in Australia (Uebel et al., 2021 ), but no included study was 
conducted in Africa. China (n 14) and the United Kingdom (n 10) 
were the two countries with the highest number of studies; Germany and 
the United States had the same number of studies (n 4). The included 
studies more often set their study area in urban green spaces (n 52), 
and most of these occurred in urban parks (n 25). Field interviews (n 
29) and laboratory experiments (n 25) were the most commonly 
used methods to collect data; few studies (n 6) combined two ap-
proaches to conduct experiments. Most of the data had no spatial and/or 
temporal characteristics (n 59), and studies that considered such 
accounted for only one-fifth (n 15) of the total. 
For the soundscape elements, we chiefly focused on extracting in-
formation from the studies about the natural sound type (Fig. 3e), the 
soundscape measure (Fig. 3f), and the type of associated contextual 
factors (Fig. 3g). Usually, multiple types of natural sounds were explored 
simultaneously in a study. Biological sounds (f 103) were studied 
much more often than geophysical sounds (f 60). Birdsongs and water 
sounds were the two most studied natural sound sources, with 32 and 31 times, respectively, followed by wind-induced vegetation sounds (f 
21) and wind sounds (f 18). Most studies combined at least two or 
more measures to test human experiences in the acoustic environment. 
Perceived sound intensity/level (f 19) and identification of sound type 
(f 18) were the most frequently used measures, followed by restor -
ativeness (f 14) and semantic attributes (f 13). Most studies focused 
on the perceptual responses to soundscapes, compared to soundscape 
induced health benefits and preferences and values. The context can be 
categorized as the place, person, and activity (ISO, 2014 ), the effects of 
which on soundscapes were simultaneously explored in some studies. 
Place-related factors, e.g., naturalness, visual perception or quality, and 
landscape morphology or pattern, were studied most frequently (f 97). 
4.2. Evidence of soundscape compositions that people preferred 
The research evidence suggests that people have common prefer -
ences but also differences due to their cultural backgrounds. We classi -
fied preferences into three main categories based on the perceptual 
construct of soundscape (ISO, 2014 ), including natural sound sources, 
soundscape characteristics, and contextual features (for details see 
Table S1, Supplementary material ). Each type contains many general 
preferences, along with some special findings that arise in certain con-
ditions, such as specific places, human groups, or human-nature in-
teractions. In subcategories, single types of natural sounds and 
landscape aesthetics are the most studied subcategories, followed by 
natural sound combinations, and physical features and perceptual at-
tributes of soundscapes. A small number of studies focused on contextual 
elements such as biodiversity, proximity, temporal or seasonal changes, 
and infrastructure. 
4.3. Effects of natural sounds on human health and well-being 
The two effect models are shown in Fig. 4. Multi-species birdsongs 
are those explicitly stated or unspecified species in the studies; single- 
species birdsongs are those coming from only one type of songbird; 
sounds of domestic animals come from unspecified animals that were in 
villages; mixed natural sounds represent the combination of more than 
one type of natural sound, or natural sounds without explicitly indicated 
types.

inclusion calculation. The left and right sides are the reduced model and the improved model, respectively. Z. Chen et al.

Ecological Indicators 141 (2022) 109156
7The overall mean effect size for the improved effect was 2.20 (95% 
CI 1.98, 2.43), indicating that the group exposed to natural sounds 
obtained a significant overall improvement in restorativeness and pos-
itive affection relative to the control group. The mean overall effect size 
for the reduced effect was  1.79 (95% CI -2.41,  1.16), which proves 
that natural sounds also have a significant overall reduced effect on 
stress, annoyance, and negative mood. As shown in Fig. 4, bird sounds 
from multiple species had the strongest effect (4.80, 95% CI 4.04, 
5.56), followed by mixed nature sounds (3.07, 95% CI 2.30, 3.85) and 
wind-induced vegetation sounds (2.64, 95% CI 1.87, 3.40). Water 
sounds (2.03, 95% CI 1.63, 2.43) were slightly more enhanced than 
single-species birdsongs (1.82, 95% CI 1.30, 2.33). Dog barking 
exhibited the weakest improved effect (0.45, 95% CI 0.27, 0.64). 
Although a reduced effect result was obtained for the frog croaking 
(-0.30, 95% CI -1.44, 0.83), its 95% CI intersected with the null line, 
representing that the result was not statistically significant, i.e., the frog 
croaking may not have a substantial influence on human health and 
well-being. Regarding the reduced effects model, water sounds had the 
strongest reduced effect (-2.33, 95% CI -3.00,  1.67), followed by 
mixed natural sounds (-1.99, 95% CI -2.95,  1.04). However, in 
contrast to the performance in the improved effect, multi-species bird-
songs presented the weakest effect in reduction (-0.77, 95% CI -1.09, 
 0.45). 
5.Discussion 
5.1. Theory: Framework for integrating natural sounds in landscape 
planning 
In this study, a PSRE framework was introduced as a methodology 
for incorporating soundscape resources into LP. The framework is based 
on the PRESET model (Haaren et al., 2014; Albert et al., 2016 ) and 
considers the soundscape assessment from an ES perspective so that it 
can be more smoothly and closely linked to established LP tools. This 
framework incorporates natural sound sources, differentiated NSES, 
relevant human inputs, and potential benefits of NSES. It indicates the 
interrelationships between these components, and theoretically they can 
be evaluated using separate indicators. This differentiated approach 
suggests that a portion of the NSES, namely the offered NSES, is already 
included in planning considerations and is therefore more adaptable to 
the established planning process. In this way, based on the ES-in- 
Planning framework (Albert et al., 2016 ), predicting future states of 
the soundscape resources becomes possible. Such prediction can help 
capture the effects of land use planning, change, or degradation on the 
values of soundscape resources. With the support of PSRE, landscape 
planners can not only effectively identify and evaluate high-value 
soundscape resources, but also develop conservation measures, even 
in the absence of human use. These processes can also reveal the 
discrepancy between actual aesthetic value provision and recreational 
needs in the area, and description of the results can be incorporated into 
the public participation. In addition, PSRE broadens the framework of 
ISO 12,913 (ISO, 2014, 2018 ) by suggesting concerns in terms of the 
monetary and non-monetary values of soundscapes, as well as health 
benefits from soundscape, so that landscape planners and researchers 
can realize the deeper contributions of soundscape resources. 
5.2. Evidence: common soundscape preferences 
5.2.1. Current challenges for introducing soundscape into landscape 
planning 
As presented in the characteristics of the included studies (Fig. 3), for 
the purpose of including soundscape evaluation in LP, some shortcom -
ings in the focuses and research methods still exist. First, limitations still 
exist in the selection of study area. Due to the differences in socio- 
cultural backgrounds, cross-regional studies can provide more compre -
hensive information for planning (Jeon et al., 2018 ), thus improving the rationality of planning objectives setting, especially in developed 
countries with diverse populations, such as Germany (Green, 2013 ). In 
addition, the concerns are mostly located in urban green spaces. How-
ever, natural green spaces also provide rich soundscape resources but 
could suffer from some negative effects (Abbott et al., 2016 ), which fall 
under the scope of Nature-based solution (NBS) (Hanson et al., 2020 ). LP 
can provide complementary contributions to NBS (Albert et al., 2019 ), 
therefore a greater focus on the soundscape of natural green spaces in 
the context of LP can also contribute to the development and imple -
mentation of NBS. 
Second, the studies lacked expansion based on ISO 12913-2 (ISO, 
2018 ) in terms of data collection and studied sound types. Most included 
studies evaluated the acoustic environment by collecting people ’s re-
sponses through questionnaires. Although this is the advocated 
approach, it still suffers from being time-consuming and labor-intensive 
(EEA, 2014 ). This issue may also potentially limit the ongoing explo -
ration and evaluation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the soundscape. 
For the studied sound sources, less attention has been paid to specific 
species or types of sound sources that fall under main sound categories. 
For example, different species of birdsongs (Zhao et al., 2020 ), or 
different types of water sounds such as ocean, stream, and waterfall 
sounds (Galbrun and Ali, 2013; Rådsten-Ekman et al., 2013 ). Such 
precise classification may lead to different physiological and psycho -
logical reactions in humans. 
Third, few studies focused on human value and preferences, health, 
and well-being for soundscapes. Such aspects are not even mentioned in 
the ISO 12913 documents (ISO, 2014, 2018, 2019 ), nonetheless it is 
particularly important in ES-informed LP. Because LP is more concerned 
with the public preferences, needs, and well-being, it evaluates and se-
lects valuable natural resources based on collective values (Haaren et al., 
2019 ). For incorporating into LP, soundscape researchers should expand 
the study horizon and applicable indicators, and summarize the general 
public values and preferences (Hermes et al., 2018 ), so as to interface 
well with planning rules and also be able to advance relevant legislation 
and policy development. 
5.2.2. Formal characteristics of soundscape resources based on common 
preferences 
Our evidence synthesis essentially responds to some findings from 
previous studies. It suggests that people have common core preferences 
of soundscape compositions for NSES. In addition, people with different 
sociocultural backgrounds may differ in the degree of preference (e.g., 
the difference between liking very much and liking in general). Based on 
the evidence, the formal characteristics of soundscape resources can 
converge into three categories: naturalness, diversity, and 
appropriateness. 
The naturalness of the soundscape is considered by Carles et al. 
(1999) to be one of the most important components of the soundscape 
preference, which is consistent with our results. We argue that natu-
ralness is rather a “fundamental ” characteristic from which a variety of 
positive attributes (e.g., pleasantness and calmness) can be derived. The 
evidence indicates that the naturalness is highly dependent on the type 
or dominance of the natural sounds that comprise soundscapes (Benfield 
et al., 2010; P˘erez-Martínez et al., 2018 ), which may explain in part why 
the natural sounds provide many positive attributes. Nevertheless, not 
all types of natural sounds can be perceived positively. The evidence 
shows that humans generally dislike dog barking and frog croaking (Liu 
et al., 2019; Wang and Zhao, 2019 ), which may be because they make 
people feel noisy and unsafe. In general, such animals need to ward off 
enemies by raising their voices when threatened or attacked. However, 
such aversion can be mitigated after adding preferred natural sounds. 
This phenomenon can be regarded as a positive “masking effect ”, and it 
is generally accepted that natural sound source combinations have a 
high degree of harmony (Liu et al., 2018b; Hong et al., 2019a ). These 
may be expressions of the naturalness. Therefore, the role of soundscape 
naturalness as an integral part of landscape naturalness should receive Z. Chen et al.

Ecological Indicators 141 (2022) 109156
8more attention especially in LAQ assessments. 
The soundscape diversity is usually closely related to biodiversity 
and acoustic features. In fact, these two can be discussed together. For 
instance, some evidence suggests that birdsongs of different species 
varied from hardness and timbres, leading to the perception of either 
friendliness or aggression (Ratcliffe et al., 2013 ). In addition, the com-
bination of bird calls from different species can present variable acoustic 
features (e.g., with regard to frequencies or fluctuation strengths) and is 
more likely to be appreciated (Hong et al., 2021 ). We speculate that 
people may be able to perceive the energetic atmosphere or euphoric 
state of mind due to exposure to such sounds. This may also be a possible 
reason why humans prefer multi-species birdsongs to single-species 
birdsongs. Theoretically, the preference for vegetation sounds of 
different species can also be explored. However, most of the vegetation 
is planted in combination, and it may be difficult to distinguish species- 
specific vegetation sounds. Interestingly, one study found that humans 
cannot identify more than four types of bird sounds simultaneously 
(Hong et al., 2021 ), which indicates that current data collection methods 
may be flawed in exploring the diversity of soundscapes. 
Furthermore, we suggest focusing on the appropriateness of the 
soundscape based on the evidence synthesis, which is consistent with 
Axelsson ’s conclusion (Axelsson, 2015 ). Appropriateness focuses more 
on how the soundscape interacts with the non-acoustic environment, 
and can provide information beyond whether the soundscape is good or 
bad. It can be reflected in the soundscape spatial and temporal di-
mensions, and the soundscape and human multi-sensory interactions. 
For the spatial dimension, natural sounds are appropriate for green 
spaces. The evidence demonstrates that the magnitude of natural sound 
levels in green spaces does not reduce human preferences (Nicolosi 
et al., 2021; Uebel et al., 2021 ) and may even contribute to tranquility 
(Liu et al., 2018b ). We speculate that it may be because the natural 
sounds provide a high level of perceived naturalness, which is an 
important metric for calculating tranquility (Watts and Marafa, 2017 ). 
Assuming that the sound pressure level is kept within a certain range 
(Watts and Pheasant, 2015 ), even relatively loud natural sounds can 
enhance the tranquility of green spaces. For the temporal dimension, 
some sounds have been found to be better suited to particular seasons, 
such as woodpecker sounds in summer and sparrow sounds in winter 
(Putman and Blumstein, 2019 ). Such vocalization depend largely on the 
habits and needs of the singer (Hao et al., 2021 ). For multi-sensory in-
teractions, the evidence indicates that good visual quality, consistency 
in audio-visual or audio-visual-olfactory, and good provision of service 
facilities can all contribute to soundscape quality (Hong et al., 2020b; 
Zhao et al., 2020; Kogan et al., 2021 ). 
5.2.3. Quantified common preferences for various natural sounds 
The results of the meta-analysis indicate that exposure to nature sounds has positive effects on human health and well-being, which is 
consistent with those of previous studies (Bratman et al., 2012; Swaffield 
and McWilliam, 2013; Buxton et al., 2021 ). This finding, when inter-
preted from an evolutionary perspective (Katcher and Wilkins, 1993 ), 
suggests that humans are instinctively concerned with the safety pro-
vided by the environment in which they reside. Preferred natural 
soundscapes may provide a safe and orderly environment (Wang and 
Zhao, 2019; Fisher et al., 2021 ), in which people can more easily control 
their emotional state and find mental nourishment and satisfaction. 
Conversely, people may dislike an acoustic environment that lacks 
natural sounds or delivers disturbing information (as described in Sec-
tion 5.2.2 ), because such surrounding may cause people to experience 
increased mental tension and stress. This also reflects another determi -
nant “alarm ” of soundscape preference proposed by Carles et al. (1999) . 
The data show that multi-species birdsongs and water sounds possess 
the greatest improved and reduced effect sizes, respectively (Fig. 4), 
which more objectively echoes some findings that bird and water sounds 
are the most preferred types of natural sounds (Krzywicka and Byrka, 
2017; Liu et al., 2019 ). However, our results are not entirely consistent 
with the findings of Buxton et al. (2021) . We speculate the differences 
arise from two possible sources: On the one hand, the studied types of 
sound sources were different. We focused on all types of natural sounds 
examined in green spaces instead of just bird and water sounds, and bird 
sounds were further distinguished from single and multiple species in 
our study. On the other hand, the included outcomes were different. We 
completely considered all possible outcomes that determine common 
preferences based on PSRE, but Buxton et al. focused only on the health 
outcomes. Nonetheless, we also have similar findings. For the acquired 
dataset, we shared the same finding as Buxton et al.: the supporting data 
for the reduced model were smaller than those of the improved model. 
This again echoes our discussion in Section 5.2.1 . 
Additionally, we unexpectedly found that wind-induced vegetation 
sounds outperformed even water sounds in the improved effect model 
(Fig. 4). The vegetation sound, like birdsong, is also an important rep-
resentation of biodiversity (Ng et al., 2018 ). Interestingly, we found no 
mention of vegetation sounds in the natural sound category proposed by 
ISO 12913 -2 (ISO, 2018 ). Even though Fig. 3e shows that there were 
many studies measuring vegetation sounds, in the review process we 
found that few of them considered and discussed deeply. In addition, 
small amount of the data for the reduced model (Fig. 4) delivers a similar 
information to Fig. 3f, namely that most of the current studies are only at 
the perception stage and do not further consider soundscape health or 
soundscape values and preferences. The results of the reduced model 
also quantitatively illustrate that perceiving nature sounds are stress- 
reducing and relaxing, which may also explain their contribution to 
tranquility (Section 5.2.2 ). Besides, the performances of mixed natural 
sounds in the two models (Fig. 4) echo the speculation in Section 5.2.2 : 
The positive “masking effect ” and high harmony produced by the 
combined natural sounds. The results of meta-analysis can be considered 
as a proxy for intersubjective values, thus providing the basic data base 
for determining the public general preferences for natural sound 
sources. 
5.3. Application: basic natural sound scores and proposed indicators for 
assessing NSES 
Based on our results, we suggest a relatively rough but effective 
approach to NSES evaluation. In the context of LP, the soundscape re-
sources of any given ecosystem should be able to be modeled and 
mapped based on geographic data and landscape ecological knowledge. 
Therefore, we are committed to constructing a preliminary but generally 
applicable standardized evaluation, including: (1) an assignment of 
value scores to natural sounds (Table 2), derived from the outcomes of 
the two effect models, and (2) a series of proposed indicators for 
assessing differentiated NSES (Table 3), classified according to the PSRE 
framework and corresponding to soundscape common preferences. We Table 2

9exclude the mixed natural sounds to only focus on individual ones. The 
natural breaks (jenks) method was employed for the division of the 
value score, which aims to maximize the variation among each category 
(Chen et al., 2013). Due to the research limitations mentioned above, the 
preliminary evaluation methods suggested here are temporarily unable 
to achieve a very detailed distinction across species of sound sources. 
To spatially evaluate NSES, Table 2 and Table 3 should be combined. 
Table 2 is able to examine the initial values of identified natural sounds. 
The indicators in Table 3 are used to assess the “simulated” values 
(based on the initial values) of such sounds in a spatial unit (e.g., 
biotope) of a given green space. Because such values or preferences of 
sounds for people may change due to variations in soundscape charac -
teristics and contextual factors in a place. Theoretically, natural sounds 
or soundscapes with their value scores can be located and assigned to 
spatial units in GIS, and the relevant components can be layered, 
superimposed, and evaluated through spatial analysis methods, if the 
required indicators are filled by specific metrics. However, the selection 
of such metrics is beyond the scope of this study, but we will carry out 
the exploration in the subsequent research. Also, a spatial sound database, or called the “audiotope”, that contains corresponding re-
cordings should be built to support the model, which needs validation 
and refinement by knowledge of specific vocal species. Based on the 
model, it is possible to implement the user-independent approach for 
assessing the soundscape resources in LP. 
5.4. Limitations and future studies 
The set scope and the outcomes of meta-analysis may be the main 
sources of the limitations of this study. For the former, we focused on the 
soundscape resources only in green spaces, but some natural sounds may 
also be perceived e.g., roads or urban squares. Besides, our research was 
limited to peer-reviewed articles that were published in English, which 
might lead to missed studies. For the latter, significant heterogeneity 
and publication bias were observed among the included studies, which 
could not be avoided and might have some effects on the results. 
Moreover, the included studies provided relatively small sample sizes 
for building the reduced effect model. 
Based on the review, we suggest the following three aspects for Table 3

10future studies:  
(1) More studies need to explore the preferences for species-specific 
sounds. Although some studies have focused on species-specific 
birdsongs, most do not follow certain criteria in species selec-
tion. Future studies could, for instance, consider all bird species 
that may occur in a given season or biotope type, thus enhancing 
the completeness and validity of the data and making it easier to 
use in planning practices. By the same token, we also suggest a 
more in-depth exploration of species-specific differentiation of 
the preferences for vegetation sounds.  
(2) More research could focus on the formal characteristics of 
soundscapes. In contrast to the dominant user-dependent sub-
jectivist approach currently, user-independent formal assess -
ments can more efficiently capture community or collective 
preferences for the soundscape resources (Daniel, 2001 ), and 
provide place-specific and comparable results for regions and 
areas (Hermes et al., 2018 ), thus supporting decisions regarding 
soundscape resource conservation or regional tourism develop -
ment. However, this does not mean that only one or the other can 
exist. The two approaches serve different purposes in planning 
and can be combined to obtain the best planning results.  
(3) More studies could explore the non-monetary and monetary 
values of soundscape resources based on ES concepts. At this 
stage, soundscape studies are mostly at the level of individuals ’ 
perceptions, but future research could focus more on the collec -
tive values or preferences for soundscapes, impact of soundscapes 
on human health, well-being, and quality of life, and their in-
terrelationships. In terms of the monetary value, the attention 
should not only be paid on how much people were willing to 
invest in noise reduction (Calleja et al., 2017 ), but could also be 
the willingness to invest in soundscape resource measures. For 
example, the survey of people ’s willingness to invest economi -
cally in the preservation, restoration, and creation of valuable or 
locally-distinctive soundscapes. 
6.Conclusion 
This study provides an enhanced point for incorporating the concept 
and evaluation of soundscape resources into LP from the perspective of 
ES. As a supplement to ISO12913 documents that consider soundscape 
as the acoustic environment that people perceive instantly, we advocate 
that soundscape resources can also be an inherent property or capability 
possessed by green spaces. The introduced PSRE framework proposes 
the concept of NSES and distinguishes different modules, linking the 
dimension of intersubjective and economic values as value bases for 
evaluating differentiated NSES. The PRISMA method was employed to 
collect qualitative and quantitative empirical evidence based on the 
PSRE framework. We summarized the current challenges in incorpo -
rating soundscape evaluation into LP, revealed and advanced the state of 
knowledge about people ’s soundscape preferences, and quantified the 
value of different natural sound sources for human benefits. Finally, we 
propose a preliminary assessment method for NSES based on the study 
results, for the soundscape assessment in LP. The results of this study can 
help landscape planners to better address people ’s needs for the acoustic 
environment, more effectively protect soundscape resources even in the 
absence of human use, and more comprehensively conduct LAQ as-
sessments and EIAs. In our next research, we will further deepen the 
construction of user-independent models and conduct case studies, and 
obtain actual perception data through immersive experiments to verify 
and calibrate the modelresults.
