SYMPTOM -BASED SUBGROUPS IN MISOPHONIA  
 1 
Abstract  
Misophonia is characterized by intense emotional and physiological reactions to everyday 
sounds such as chewing and tapping. While previous research ers have focused on defining and 
characterizing the disorder, limited attention has been given to the variability in symptom 
presentations across individuals. In this study, we sought to identify distinct subgroups of 
individuals with misophonia by applying a Gaus sian finite mixture model to explore the 
heterogeneity of symptom profiles. Sixty treatment -seeking participants completed the Duke 
Misophonia Interview, which assessed the presence and severity of various behavioral, affective, 
and cognitive symptoms. Ite ms from this measure served as model indicators. Two clusters were 
found: anticipatory and reactive. The anticipatory  group reported heightened awareness of 
potential triggers, preemptive anticipatory distress , and increased avoidance behaviors, while the 
reactive group primarily displayed emotional and physiological responses during the occurrence 
of sounds. Notably, both groups reported similar frequencies of misophonic triggers, but the 
anticipatory  group demonstrated greater internalizing symptoms, such  as intrusive thoughts  or 
rumination about misophonic sounds  and social isolation. Our findings support the need for 
tailored interventions that address subgroup -specific symptom patterns. Future research ers 
should aim to include larger sample sizes and de velop more comprehensive models to capture 
the full spectrum of misophonia symptoms, including externalizing behaviors.

Recognizing Individual Variability in Misophonia: Identifying Symptom -Based Subgroups 
with Gaussian Mixture Modeling  
The first scientific investigations of misophonia began just over a decade ago (e.g., 
Schroder et al., 2013). Psychologists, audiologists, and neurologists  who have led the init ial 
stages of this research  have primarily focused on defining and characterizing the disorder. This 
research has led experts to classify misophonia as a sound sensitivity disorder, marked by intense 
emotional and physiological reactions to common sounds l ike chewing, breathing, and tapping 
(Swedo et al., 2022). The research thus far has consistently show n that misophonic reactions can 
severely impact relationships and are associated with significant difficulties in social, academic, 
and occupational functi oning (Ferros -Terras et al., 2022; Brout et al., 2018).  Additionally, 
misophonia can co -occur with psychiatric conditions such as generalized anxiety disorder and 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  (Jager et al., 2020 ; Woolley et al., 2024 ). However,  it is 
increasingly recognized that misophonia should be classified as a distinct disorder (Rosenthal et 
al., 2022; Swedo et al., 2022).  
Despite key scientific advancements such as a set of proposed diagnostic criteria 
(Schröder et al., 2013; Jager et al.,  2020), measurement tools , and treatment studies (see Mattson 
et al., 2023 for a review) , individual variability in misophonia presentations remains 
underexplored, which has important implications for diagnosis and treatment . Notably, symptom 
severity appears to vary widely, particularly emotional responses to misophonic sounds. Some 
studies highlight a spectrum of emotional responses . For instance, emotional responses for those 
with moderate levels of misophonia typically invo lve more manageable experiences such as 
irritation and distress (Dibb et al., 2021; Tunç et al., 2017; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018). 
Alternatively , a substantial subset experience more intense reactions, escalating to panic, rage, 
Journal Pre-proof

SYMPTOM -BASED SUBGROUPS IN MISOPHONIA  
 3 
and in some cases, aggressive b ehaviors such as violence (Tunç et al., 2017; Guzick et al., 2023).  
Variability in physiological reactions  has also been reported , ranging from muscle tension to 
headaches and physical pain (Wu et al., 2014; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018; Mednicoff et al., 2024).   
Similarly, avoidance behaviors vary widely, from minimal strategies like covering the 
ears to more disruptive actions, such as avoiding family meals or certain individuals. The timing 
of avoidance differs as well; some individuals reactively avoid misoph onic triggers in the 
moment, while others engage in anticipatory avoidance, taking preemptive steps to avoid 
situations where trigger sounds are expected (Guzick et al., 2023). Unsurprisingly, the extent of 
avoidance has been linked to the level of discomf ort experienced when exposed to misophonic 
triggers (Claiborn et al., 2020). Furthermore, the intensity of misophonic symptoms is often 
associated with impairment and disruptions in quality of life (Möllmann et al., 2023; Guzick et 
al., 2023).  
As research advances and diagnostic criteria for misophonia are refined (e.g., Swedo et 
al., 2022), the variability observed in the disorder suggests that it may be more appropriately 
understood  dimensionally rather than categorically. While psychiatric diagnoses typi cally follow 
categorical frameworks, assessing symptoms on a spectrum provides a more nuanced 
understanding (Zimmerman et al., 2018). Moreover, diagnostic heterogeneity in psychiatry is not 
solely about differences in severity but also about how disorders manifest uniquely across 
individuals, depending on the presence of specific symptoms. For example, latent profile 
analysis has shown that individuals with severe and moderate depression exhibit distinct 
symptom patterns, with those experiencing severe depression reporting significantly higher 
levels of suicidal ideation and cognitive diffic ulties, such as problems with concentration and 
memory (Li et al., 2024). Similarly, studies of adults with post -traumatic stress symptoms

following natural disasters have identified four distinct profiles —minimal, low, moderate, and 
severe —where differenc es in avoidance, hyperarousal, and numbing play  a critical role in 
distinguishing more severe presentations (Bondjers et al., 2018; Rosellini et al., 2014).  
Recent efforts to understand the heterogeneity of misophonia have employed similar 
clustering techn iques. For example, Norris et al. (2022) used k -means clustering to examine 
symptom presentations in a non -clinical sample, identifying subgroups with varying degrees of 
misophonia severity and associated conditions  (e.g.,  tinnitus and sensory hypersensiti vity). 
Similarly, McKay et al. (2018) applied Profile Analysis via Multidimensional Scaling to identify 
psychological symptom profiles, which highlighted  different  patterns associated with obsessive -
compulsive features, interoceptive sensitivity, and distr ess tolerance. While these studies 
highlight the utility of clustering approaches for identifying broad symptom patterns of 
misophonia and its phenotypic features, these approaches have yet to classify individuals based 
on the specific behavioral, cognitiv e, and emotional processes involved in the disorder. 
Developing a more nuanced understanding of these mechanisms could advance classification 
systems, assessment tools, and interventions tailored to unique presentations of misophonia.  
Recognizing the need to understand heterogeneity in the specific 
symptomatology of misophonia, researchers have begun examining the distinct 
symptom patterns that manifest differently among individuals with the disorder . For 
example, youth  with misophonia  experience varying le vels of internalizing symptoms (e.g., 
anxiety, mood disturbances), which may be linked to isolation, rumination, and self -blame 
regarding their misophonic reactions. In contrast, externalizing symptoms (e.g., aggression, 
outbursts) were associated with ove rt dysregulated responses to trigger sounds and external 
blame (Armstrong et al., 2023). Although both symptom dimensions are related to misophonia

severity, they may manifest differently; one study showed  for youth with misophonia, 
internalizing symptoms are linked to a lower quality of life whereas externalizing symptoms 
were not (Kook et al., 2024). Another study of adults found that more severe misophonia 
symptoms were associated with heightened anxiety or depressive emotions, rather than feelings 
of an ger or annoyance, when exposed to triggering sounds (Möllmann et al., 2023). While these 
findings illustrate that individuals with misophonia may present with varying symptom 
profiles —ranging from internalizing to externalizing dimensions —there remains a need for more 
comprehensive measures that assess the full spectrum of emotional, behavioral, and 
physiological responses.  
Currently , most existing measures of misophonia primarily assess symptom intensity and 
impairment (e.g., Wu et al., 2014; Siepsiak et al., 2020), with less focus on evaluating the full 
range of psychological, affective, and physiological responses that contribute to the complexity 
and heterogeneity of the disorder. To address this gap, Rosenthal et al. (2021) developed the 
Duke Misophoni a Questionnaire (DMQ), which captures a broader range of internal and external 
behavioral, affective, physiological, and cognitive experiences. The DMQ later informed the 
development of the Duke Misophonia Interview (DMI; Guetta et al., 2022), a semi -struc tured 
interview designed to assess these facets in -depth through participant interviews and clinician 
ratings. This approach allows for the assessment of the presence and severity of unique 
psychological aspect s of misophonia. Naturally, heterogeneity in s ymptomatology and intensity 
is revealed through individual -level  item responses. Such person -specific variability in symptom 
endorsement holds significant implications for  tailoring  treatment, and the developers of these 
measures have emphasized the import ance of flexible, person -centered interventions, such as the 
Unified Protocol and Process -Based Therapy (Rosenthal et al., 2023).

In the current study, we explored variability in misophonia symptoms by assessing 
whether distinct subgroups of individuals wi th misophonia can be identified. Using a model -
based clustering approach, we utilized the behavioral, affective, and cognitive dimensions 
captured by the DMI as indicators to define these subgroups. Additionally, we examined the 
clinical relevance of these  subgroups by comparing their levels of functional impairment, as well 
as comorbid psychological factors including stress, anxiety, and depression. The ultimate goal of 
this study was to enhance our understanding of potential differences in how misophonia  presents 
and provide preliminary recommendations for more tailored intervention approaches.  
Methods  
Study Context  
The present study includes data collect ed as part of a larger randomized controlled trial 
(RCT) evaluating a psychological intervention for misophonia (see MASKED FOR REVIEW). 
This study focuses exclusively on data collected during the initial assessment phase, prior to any 
intervention. All RCT procedures were preregistered on  www.clinicaltrials.gov  [INDE NTIFER 
MASKED] and on  the Open Science Framework : 
https://osf.io/9mw pd/?view_only=f7789c49dffe4a829cc6e504daac4bdc . The research was 
approved by a University Institutional Review Board.  
Procedures  
Recruitment and Eligibility Screening  
The RCT was carried out in Utah, with participants recruited from within the state 
between November 2022 and November 2023 . Participants were recruited through local 
advertisements and social media. Ads via Facebook and other platforms invited individuals 
interested in treatment for misophonia to participate in the study. Potential partic ipants were

directed to an online screener that included the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014). 
A total of 261 individuals completed the screener.  
Participants qualified for an intake appointment to assess their eligibility  for treatment if 
they scored above 5 on the severity item of the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ ; Wu et al., 2014), 
indicating at least mild impairment. Of the 261 individuals screened, 232 met this criterion and 
were invited to proceed to the next step. These individuals were contacted by email and invited 
to schedule a clinical intake interview. Of the contacted individuals, 75 consented and agreed to 
participate. The remaining individuals who were invited to participate did not respond to the 
invitation or declined to partici pate.  
Baseline Procedures  
All 75 of the consenting participants attended an intake appointment, which included a 
structured clinical interview for misophonia (the Duke Misophonia Interview; DMI; Guetta et al., 
2022) to confirm the presence of misophonia a nd continued interest in receiving therapy for 
misophonia. The Diagnostic Interview for Anxiety, Mood, and Obsessive -Compulsive and 
Related Neuropsychiatric Disorders ( DIAMOND; Tolin et al., 2018) was administered to assess 
comorbid diagnoses based on DSM -5 criteria  (not reported in this paper [see MASKED FOR 
REVIEW]) . The interview served  to rule  out any psychiatric conditions that would prevent 
misophonia from being identified as the primary condition requiring treatment.  All interview s 
were conducted by a traine d doctoral student in clinical psychology and supervised by the 
principal investigator , a lic ensed psychologist . 
Additionally, the participants completed self -report questionnaires to provide information 
on their sociodemographic background , symptoms of misophonia , and other mental health 
variables . Finally, a doctoral student in audiology, under the supervision of an audiologist, 
Journal Pre-proof

SYMPTOM -BASED SUBGROUPS IN MISOPHONIA

conducted an audiological evaluation to assess any peripheral hearing issues, such as hyperacusis 
or hearing loss . These audiological results were part of the broader clinical trial and are not 
examined in this paper (see [masked for review] for further details ). Each participant received 
$60 as compensation for completing the clinical interview and the self -report q uestionnaire.  
After completing the initial intake appointment, participants were deemed eligible for the 
study if the y scored a total score of  20 or greater on the Duke Misophonia Interview (DMI ; 
Guetta et al., 2020). This score was pre -selected as a cutof f to mark clinically significant levels 
of misophonic symptoms, as it falls one standard deviation below the norm established by the 
measure ’s validation sample. This score was used as a clinical cutoff to ensure that participants' 
symptoms were sufficient ly severe to warrant intervention. Following the administration of the 
DMI, during which misophonia symptoms and their functional impact were discussed, 
participants were asked to confirm their continued interest in pursuing therapy to ensure the 
sample co nsisted of individuals actively seeking treatment. A total of 15 participants were 
excluded from the final sample for the following reasons: nine individuals scored below the 
established cut -off on the DMI , two had sound sensitivities related to trauma, on e participant had 
sound sensitivities primarily due to volume, one participant met criteria for a current manic 
episode (which represented a primary presenting problem over misophonia ), and two participants 
decided they no longer wished to pursue treatment  for misophonia.  
Sample Characteristics  
The final sample included 60 treatment seeking  participants  with misophonia who 
primarily self -identified as White (98.3%), non -Hispanic (96.7%), heterosexual (76.7%), women 
(90.0%), with an average age of 33.80 years ( SD = 12.18); see Table 1 for all participant 
demographics.

Measures  
Duke Misophonia Interview (DMI; Rosenthal et al., 2021; Guetta et al., 2022)  
The Duke Misophonia Interview (DMI) is an 18 -item semi -structured clinical interview 
designed to assess both the presence and severity of misophonia symptoms. The DMI evaluates 
trigger sounds, reaction severity, and functional impairment, focusing on both current symptoms 
and symptoms experienced over the participant's lifetime.  
Items 2 through 14 of the DMI  assess a range of specific internalizing and externalizing 
cognitive, behavioral, and emotional symptoms associated with misophonia (e.g., the experience 
of negative emotions during a misophonic trigger, as evaluated in Item 6). These items capture 
the pr esence, frequency, and intensity of symptoms. Symptom severity over the past month is 
rated using a 5 -point Likert scale, and these ratings are combined to generate a current severity 
score. When a symptom is present, its perceived impact on functioning is  assessed, contributing 
to a "current impairment" subscale. Global levels of impairment are assessed separately using 
items 15 to 18, which focus on the broader impact of misophonia symptoms on daily 
functioning, such as relationships with family, friends,  and colleagues (e.g., Item 15).  
For the current study, only the severity scores from the current severity subscale were 
used as indicators in model -based clustering to identify distinct subgroups based on misophonia 
symptoms. The global impairment subscal e, rather than the current impairment subscale, was 
selected to assess functional impairment in this study. This decision was made because the 
current impairment items are only administered when a symptom is present, leading to overlap 
between impairment a nd severity that would complicate subgroup comparisons in the clustering 
analysis.

The DMI has demonstrated excellent preliminary psychometric properties, including 
strong internal consistency, predictive validity, and test -retest reliability (Guetta et al ., 2022), 
making it a reliable and valid instrument for clinical assessment of misophonia. While formal 
interrater reliability testing was not assessed, the doctoral student interviewer and the principal 
investigator (a licensed psychologist) reviewed inte rview recordings for the first ten participants 
together. This process ensured agreement on item scoring, enhancing the consistency and 
accuracy of the assessments. The reliability of the global impairment subscale in this study was 
acceptable (α = .68).  
Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014)  
 The Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014) is a self -report instrument 
consisting of 18 items that measure various aspects of misophonia, including severity and the 
specific nature of symptoms. It contains three subscales ; the first subscale (7 items) assesses the 
presence of misophonia -related symptoms, while the second (10 items) focuses on the emotional 
and behavioral responses to misophonic triggers. The final subscale is a single -item measure o f 
overall symptom severity. For the symptoms subscale, participants rate their sensitivity to 
specific sounds (such as repetitive tapping or eating noises) on a 5 -point Likert scale, ranging 
from 0 ( not at all true ) to 4 ( always true ). Similarly, the emoti onal and behavioral responsivity 
subscale evaluates participants ’ reactions (e.g., leaving the area, feeling irritated), also on a 5 -
point scale, from 0 ( never ) to 4 ( always ). 
The total MQ score, calculated by summing the scores from the symptoms and 
emoti onal/behavioral subscales, ranges from 0 to 68, with higher scores indicating greater 
symptom severity. Additionally, the single -item severity scale captures the overall intensity of 
misophonia on a scale from 1 ( minimal ) to 15 ( very severe ), where scores of higher  than 6  
Journal Pre-proof

suggest clinically significant levels of impairment. In this sample, the MQ demonstrated 
acceptable internal consistency (α = 0.74). 
The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale -21 (DASS -21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) .  
The DASS -21 is a 21 -item self-report questionnaire that evaluates levels of emotional 
distress in three areas: depression, anxiety, and stress. Each subscale contains seven items. 
Participants are asked to rate how often they experience specific symptoms on a 4 -point Likert 
scale,  ranging from 0 ( never ) to 3 ( almost always ). The scores for each subscale are summed and 
then doubled, with higher scores indicating greater levels of distress. The DASS -21 has shown 
strong psychometric properties, including good validity and reliability (Henry & Crawford, 
2005). In the current sample, the internal consistency of the subscales ranged from .81 to .93.  
Statistical Analysis  
Software and Preprocessing  
All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.4.1 (R Core Team, 2024), 
specifical ly utilizing the mclust  package (Scrucca & Raftery, 2018). Preprocessing of the data 
revealed no item -level missingness across the measures used in this study. Transparent and 
reproducible code for all analyses can be found on the Open Science Framework : 
https://osf.io/ytd3a/?view_only=160f09b399b34050a2c5098faa0a5953 . 
Model -Based Clustering  
To assess heterogeneity in misophonia symptom presentations, a Gaussian finite mixture 
model was employed to identify distinct subgroups within the sample. Symptom profiles were 
constructed using items 3 through 13 of the DMI. Item 14, which addresses self -destructive 
behavior (i.e., self -harm) to cope with misophonia, was not included in the model due to its low 
endorsement ( n = 3). 
Journal Pre-proof

SYMPTOM -BASED SUBGROUPS IN MISOPHONIA  
 12 
This clustering approach  assumes that the data consist of several Gaussian distributions, 
each representing a distinct subgro up. We selected the Gaussian mixture modeling  (GMM)  
approach due to its flexibility in modeling different covariance structures and its ability to handle 
complex, multivariate relationships. This flexibility allows for more accurate identification of 
clust ers based on symptom profiles, an essential consideration given the exploratory nature of the 
study and the relatively small sample size. Unlike latent profile analysis, which assumes equal 
variances within clusters  (Vermunt, 2002) , GMM accommodates variat ions in the shape, size, 
and orientation of clusters. As this is the first study to examine misophonia subgroups based on 
cognitive, emotional, and behavioral indicators of misophonia as measured by the DMI , GMM 
provided the necessary flexibility to captur e the complexity of symptom relationships . 
Model selection was guided by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the 
Integrated Complete -data Likelihood (ICL) criterion (Baudry et al., 2010), with lower values 
indicating better -fitting models. Uncerta inty of group assignment was assessed to ensure that 
participants were assigned to the most appropriate group with high confidence.  The process 
began with a two -group solution, incrementally increasing the number of groups until the 
optimal solution was id entified.  
Clinical Comparisons  
 Once the best -fitting model was selected, further between -group comparisons were 
conducted to assess differences in relevant clinical measures, including misophonia symptoms as 
measured by MQ subscale and misophonia related impairment using the DMI global impairment 
score. Additionally, groups were compared on measures of stress, anxiety, and depression  as 
assessed by the DASS -21. Shapiro -Wilk ’s tests were performed for each measure to determine

 13 
whether scores were normal ly distributed . When the assumption of normality was violated, 
Mann -Whitney U tests were used for comparison . 
Results  
Model -Based Cluster Analysis   
The model -based cluster analysis (see Figu re 1 for models with BIC values) initially  
identified an equal volume and shape (EEI) model with two classes as a viable solution. The two -
class model showed good fit based on BIC ( -1751.64 ) and ICL ( -1758.18 ) values. Furthermore, 
the bootstrap likelihood ratio test indicated that the improvement from one class to two classes 
was significant ( p = .001). Uncertainty tests for the two -class model demonstrated high certainty 
in class assignments, with average posterior probabilities of 0.9 4 for class one ( n = 31) and 0.9 7 
for cla ss two ( n = 29) , indicating high certainty in class assignments based on the two-class  
model.  
Although the two -class model showed good fit, a three -class solution was also considered 
based on its BIC ( -1755.90 ) and ICL ( -1760.16 ) values, which were similarly strong. The 
bootstrap likelihood ratio test confirmed that the improvement from two to three classes was 
significant (p = .00 1), although the improvement from three to four classes was not significant (p 
= .055), suggesting that a  three -class model could also be a viable solution.  Moreover, 
uncertainty tests for the three -class model revealed average posterior probabilities were 0.9 6 for 
class one ( n = 18), 0.97 for class two ( n = 25), and 0.9 8 for class three ( n = 17), demonstrati ng 
reliable group assignment, albeit with slightly lower certainty for the third class.  
Model Selection  
Given that the two -class and three -class models fit the data well, a data -driven approach 
was employed to determine which model provided a better fit. C omparisons were made between

the two groups in the two -class solution and the three groups in the three -class solution, using 
MQ severity and DMI global impairment scores. These comparisons were conducted to evaluate 
which model more effectively distinguis hed unique classes of individuals with misophoni a. 
Mann -Whitney U tests were performed for the two -class comparison, while analysis of variance 
(ANOV A) was performed to examine differences across the three -class group solutions.  
In the two -class model, group two scored significantly higher than group one on the MQ 
emotional and behavioral responses to trigger sounds (Cohen's d = 0.68, p = .032 ), MQ severity 
(d = 0.79, p = .012 ), and DMI global impairment (d = 1.13, p = .001 ), iden tifying group two as 
more severe and impaired. In contrast, the three -class model showed no significant differences 
across the groups for MQ misophonia symptoms , MQ severity , or MQ emotional and behavioral 
reactions (ps < .084). However, a between groups e ffect was observed for DMI global 
impairment (F(2, 57) = 5.284, p = .008) , but post-hoc Tukey ’s Honestly Significant Difference 
test revealed that these differences were only significant between classes one and two ( diff = 
1.93, p = .00 7), but not between classes one and two or classes two and three. Due to the clearer 
group distinctions in severity and impairment in the two -class model, it was selected as the most 
optimal solution.  As a result, we did not interpret the three -class soluti on further, but between -
group comparisons for the DMI model indicators in the three -class solution can be found in the 
supplemental material (see Table S1).  
Model -Based Cluster Analysis: Group Interpretation  
The two clusters were a reactive  group ( n = 31),  who have fewer misophonia symptoms 
and predominately react to misophonic triggers only when they occur, and an anticipatory  group 
(n = 29), who have more symptoms , heightened  vigilance, and increased anticipat ion of  triggers. 
The anticipatory group scored  significantly higher than the reactive group on the majority of 
Journal Pre-proof

SYMPTOM -BASED SUBGROUPS IN MISOPHONIA  
 15 
DMI symptoms, with moderate to large effect sizes (see Table 2 for details), indicating a more 
severe or symptomatic presentation of misophonia.  
The most pronounced symptom differences betwee n the anticipatory and reactive groups 
were observed for negative emotions before triggers ( d = 2.64) and hypervigilance for 
misophonic triggers ( d = 1.76). These results suggest that the anticipatory group experienced 
higher levels of preemptive internalizing symptoms, such as anticipatory distress and heightened 
emotional responses even before triggers occurred, whereas the reactive group exhibited  fewer 
signs of pre -emptive misophonic distress or vigilance towards the possible misophonic triggers. 
This distinction is further illustrated in Figure 2, which shows plotted means for each subgroup 
across all items in the model.  
Additional notable differ ences emerged between the groups, with the anticipatory group 
reporting significantly higher levels of intrusive thoughts or rumination about prior misophonic 
experiences ( d = 1.38) and a stronger sense of being misunderstood or detached from others due 
to their symptoms ( d = 1.72). These findings highlight the anticipatory group's tendency toward 
more persistent internalizing symptoms. Moreover, the anticipatory group reported greater 
engagement in deliberate avoidance of situations where they might encoun ter triggering sounds 
(d = 1.00).  
Despite these differences, both groups displayed similarly high scores for the need or 
desire to escape from triggering situations, physiological reactions to misophonic triggers, and 
negative thoughts during such events. These symptoms were reported at moderate to severe 
levels across both groups. However, the anticipatory group reported significantly higher scores 
on these reactive symptoms, suggesting that for the anticipatory group these symptoms may be 
more intense ( ds = 0.88 -1.01).

Interestingly, no significant group differences were found in negative emotions after 
misophonic sounds or verbal or physical aggression in response to triggers ( ps > .05). This 
indicates that both subgroups exhibited similar emotional and b ehavioral responses during and 
immediately following misophonic triggers, reflecting shared externalizing reactions in the 
moment. However, more pronounced distinctions were evident when triggers were absent, with 
the anticipatory group displaying more pro nounced internalizing symptoms, such as 
hypervigilance, anticipatory anxiety, and persistent distress outside of the triggering situations.  
Clinical Comparisons  
Finally, we compared the two groups on relevant clinical variables (see Table 3). No 
significan t differences were found between the groups in terms of anxiety symptoms, with both 
groups reporting average anxiety levels within the normal range based on clinical cutoff scores 
for the DASS -21. Similarly, there were no significant differences in depress ive symptoms, 
though it is worth noting that on average the reactive group endorsed little to no depressive 
symptoms (normal range), while the anticipatory group reported mild depres sive symptoms. In 
contrast, the anticipatory group reported significantly higher levels of stress, though the effect 
size was modest ( d = 0.64). The reactive group scored within the normal range for stress, while 
the anticipatory group ’s scores met the criteria for mild levels of stress.  
Discussion  
In this study, we investigate d variability in misophonia symptom profiles by employing a 
model -based clustering approach to identify distinct subgroups. A two -class model, which nearly 
evenly divided the sample, provided the best fit for the data, differentiating participants into 
anticipatory and reactive subgroups. Using this model, we successfully distinguished subgroups 
based on the severity and impairment of misophonia symptoms, with the anticipatory group 
Journal Pre-proof

SYMPTOM -BASED SUBGROUPS IN MISOPHONIA  
 17 
reporting more severe symptoms and greater impairment. While previous resea rchers have 
acknowledged heterogeneity in misophonia symptomatology (e.g., Armstrong et al., 2023; 
Guzick et al., 2023), this study is the first to distinguish subgroups of individuals based on 
unique cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms specific to misophonia using a clustering 
approach . 
The anticipatory group was characterized by heightened awareness of potential triggers, 
even when misophonic sounds were absent. These individuals demonstrated increased 
preemptive anticipation and vigilance towar d triggers, which could explain why avoidance was 
also more elevated among this group. In contrast, participants in the reactive group displayed 
elevated emotional and physiological reactions primarily when the sounds were occurring.  
Interestingly, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the 
MQ symptom subscale, which measures the frequency of misophonic triggers. This suggests that 
both groups may experience a similar number of triggers, leading to questions about why the 
anticipatory group exhibits greater levels of behavioral and emotional reactions to the sounds and 
impairment. One possibility is that the anticipatory group ’s heightened vigilance consumes more 
cognitive and emotional resources, intensifying their overall exp erience of misophonia. This 
theory aligns with the concept of experiential avoidance, where individuals attempt to control or 
avoid intense emotional reactions, leading to increased preoccupation with potential triggers 
(Cowan et al., 2022). This may expla in why the anticipatory group is more consumed by 
anticipatory anxiety and hypervigilance, whereas the reactive group predominately displays 
negative cognitive, emotional, and physiological reaction to sounds when they occur. To fully 
understand how sympto ms interact and maintain misophonia in these subgroups, researchers 
Journal Pre-proof

SYMPTOM -BASED SUBGROUPS IN MISOPHONIA

could apply network modeling to explore the unique symptom interactions that drive the disorder 
in each group.  
Both subgroups reported moderate to severe negative cognitive, emotional, and  
physiological reactions to misophonic sounds, though these symptoms were more intense in the 
anticipatory group. This finding suggests that stress responses to misophonic sounds may be 
common across different presentations of the disorder, regardless of s everity. Interestingly, there 
was no significant difference between the groups in emotional reactions after the sounds had 
stopped, suggesting that the in -the-moment stress responses are substantial enough to linger, 
making recovery more difficult for both  groups.  
The anticipatory group reported significantly more internalizing symptoms, such as 
intrusive thoughts, rumination about prior misophonic sounds, and feelings of social isolation. 
Historically, misophonia was thought to be characterized by externalizing behaviors, such as 
rageful outbursts (Vitoratou et al., 2021; Jager et al., 2020). However, our findings, along with 
more recent research (Guizick et al., 2023; Spencer et al., 2023), suggest that misophonia is more 
closely associated with in ternalizing symptoms. This shift in understanding aligns with findings 
from Kook et al. (2024) and Vitoratou et al. (2021), which link misophonia severity to 
internalizing forms of distress.  
While the externalizing dimension of misophonia was assessed thro ugh verbal or 
physical aggressive reactions, both groups reported moderate levels of aggression, with no 
significant differences between them. This suggests that externalizing symptoms, such as 
aggression, may be a more universal symptom dimension in adult s, regardless of the severity of 
the disorder. However, the DMI item assessing aggression also captures the distress individuals 
feel about their reactions, revealing that this item might reflect internalizing (e.g., guilt or regret) 
Journal Pre-proof

SYMPTOM -BASED SUBGROUPS IN MISOPHONIA  
 19 
and externalizing (e.g ., aggressive behavior) dimensions of misophonia. This complexity makes 
it challenging to distinctly identify externalizing symptoms using the DMI. Therefore, 
researchers should explore variability on externalizing symptoms in adults with misophonia.  
In comparing other clinical measures between the groups, the anticipatory subgroup 
reported significantly higher levels of general stress, as expected, given their tendency to be 
more overwhelmed by misophonic symptoms. Surprisingly, both groups reported simil ar levels 
of anxiety and depression, which may seem unexpected given the association of mood and 
anxiety symptoms with internalizing forms of psychopathology. However, while the overall 
means for anxiety, depression, stress symptoms on the DASS -21 were in the normal to mild 
range, prior research has documented similar patterns in misophonia samples  (e.g., Wu et al., 
2014; Ghorbani et al., 2022) . This suggests that our sample  may not be entirely atypical in this 
regard and reflects the variability commonly observed in psychological distress and comorbidity 
rates among individuals with misophonia (Rosenthal et al., 2022; Jager et al., 2020). Still, the 
generally mild levels of symptoms in the sample may have contributed to the absence of 
significant group dif ferences for depression and anxiety, despite their established associations 
with misophonia  severity  (Almadani et al., 2024) .  
Overall, our  findings support the need for a more individualized approach to treatment in 
misophonia. For the anticipatory group,  interventions that focus on internalizing symptoms, such 
as addressing anticipatory anxiety and intrusive thoughts and rumination, may be particularly 
beneficial. Cognitive skills that help address internalizing appraisals such as self -blame or 
mindfulnes s-based strategies to manage hypervigilance could be effective in this group. For the 
reactive group, treatments may need to focus more on managing in -the-moment emotional and 
physiological reactions to misophonic sounds. This may include teaching emotion regulation

strategies or relaxation practices that can be used in moments of heighten distress when the 
sounds themselves are occurring.  
Leveraging symptom profiles to guide clinical decision -making may represent a 
promising avenue for treatment developmen t in misophonia. For example, the Personalized 
Advantage Index (PAI; DeRubeis et al., 2014) demonstrates the potential of predictive modeling 
to allocate individuals to treatments likely to yield the greatest benefit. For misophonia, 
predictive algorithms could be developed to assign individuals to targeted interventions based on 
their symptom profiles. However, a challenge lies in the tendency to impose binary or categorical 
classifications when assigning treatments, which may fail to capture the full comp lexity of 
individual differences. Furthermore, strict algorithmic prediction models often reflect the 
constraints of the samples they are based on (van Bronswijk, 2024) and invite ongoing debate 
about the utility of actuarial methods compared to clinical j udgment, as proposed by Meehl 
(1954) in his seminal work. As algorithm -based clinical decision -making evolves (see 
Deisenhofer et al., 2024, for a discussion), future research may revisit the implications of the 
subgroups identified in the current study wi thin a binary or catagorical treatment matching 
framework.  
For now, r esearchers are increasingly recognizing the value of therapy protocols that can 
be flexibly adapted to meet the unique needs of individuals with misophonia (Rosenthal et al., 
2023; Mattso n et al., 2023). Approaches like the Unified Protocol allow for the selection and 
delivery of various cognitive and behavioral intervention modules based on the individual’s 
presenting symptoms  (Barlow et al., 2011) . Similarly, process -based therapy tailors treatment 
components to target the processes of change most relevant to the individual  (Hofmann et al., 
2022).  These interventions are actively being tested in clinical trials to address misophonia 
Journal Pre-proof

 21 
symptoms (see Rosenthal et al., 2023). Our finding s contribute to the growing body of literature 
suggesting that a one -size-fits-all treatment model may be insufficient given the diverse ways in 
which individuals with misophonia present to treatment.  To support this tailored approach, tools 
that assess th e spectrum of misophonic symptoms each individual experiences are essential for 
guiding case formulation. The DMI appears to be a valuable resource for understanding 
symptom variability in misophonia, helping clinicians personalize interventions to address  the 
specific needs of each patient.  
 Our results should be considered in light of several limitations. Firstly, the DMI is a 
clinician -rated interview, and interrater reliability was not assessed, which limits the ability to 
ensure that DMI scoring is rep licable across different raters or settings. Current research using 
the DMI has yet to report interrater reliability (see Guetta et al., 2022), highlighting the need for 
future studies to establish this metric.  Additionally, while diagnostic criteria for m isophonia have 
been proposed (Jager et al., 2020; Swedo et al., 2022) and validated screening measures exist 
(Williams et al., 2022), these were not used as inclusion criteria in this study. However,  
participants were recruited into the parent trial based on their perceived need for treatment due to 
the intensity of their symptoms, suggesting a clinically relevant misophonia sample.  
Another limitation is the sociodemographic homogeneity of our sample, reflecting Utah's 
population, where 22.3% identify as non -White or Hispanic, which is significantly lower than 
national averages (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2024). Utah's unique cultural 
and geographic factors further shape its demograph ics. Future research should prioritize 
nationally representative samples to validate these subgroups both across the United States and 
globally.

 Finally , a sample size of 60 poses limitations, as GMM and cluster -based approaches are 
highly data -driven and  sensitive to the selected sample. Future studies should replicate this work 
in larger and more diverse samples to determine whether these clusters remain consistent or if 
alternative models, such as a three -group solution, better capture the variability i n misophonia 
presentations. That being said, w hile our data supported a two -class solution, our findings also 
suggest ed additional subgroups may exist. Future research should also explore whether these 
clusters can be replicated using different person -centered methodologies, such as LCA or LPA, 
which may provide a complementary perspective on subgroup variability.  
 It should also be noted that the identified subgroups are not entirely homogeneous, as 
GMM is a variable -centered modeling approach rather than a person -centered one, as seen in 
other clustering techniques. Consequently, variability within each identified group is expected 
and should be considered when designing interventions and conducting future research. This 
within -group variation highlights t he importance of tailoring treatments to individual needs, even 
within distinct subgroups.  
Despite limitations, t he current study contributes to the growing understanding of 
misophonia by identifying distinct subgroups within individuals based on symptom p rofiles, 
using GMM. The two -class model differentiated participants into anticipatory and reactive 
subgroups, revealing important differences in symptom severity, internalizing symptoms, and 
functional impairments. These findings underscore the need for ta ilored treatment approaches 
that address the unique symptom constellations within each group. Specifically, anticipatory 
individuals may benefit from interventions targeting anticipatory anxiety and rumination, while 
reactive individuals may require strate gies for managing immediate emotional and physiological 
reactions to triggers. The results also suggest that misophonia may be best understood as a

dimensional disorder, with varying degrees of severity and symptom presentations across 
individuals. Looking  ahead, researchers should aim to use larger samples to investigate symptom 
interactions and explore the potential existence of other unique subgroups. These efforts will be 
essential for refining our understanding of misophonia and enhancing personalized treatment 
strategies for misophonia.
