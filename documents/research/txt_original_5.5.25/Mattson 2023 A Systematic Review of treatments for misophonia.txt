Pharmacotherapy ABSTRACT  
Research into misophonia treatments has been limited and it is unclear what treatment approaches may be 
effective. This systematic review extracted and synthesized relevant treatment research on misophonia to 
examine the efficacy of various intervention modalities and identify current trends in order to guide future 
treatment research. PubMed, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Central were searched using the keywords 
“misophonia, ” “decreased sound tolerance, ” “selective sound sensitivity, ” or “decreased sound sensitivity. ” Of the 
169 records available for initial screening, 33 studied misophonia treatment specifically. Data were available for 
one randomized controlled trial, one open label trial, and 31 case studies. Treatments included various forms of 
psychotherapy, medication, and combinations of the two. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) incorporating 
various components has been the most often utilized and effective treatment for reduction of misophonia 
symptoms in one randomized trial and several case studies/series. Beyond CBT, various case studies suggested 
possible benefit from other treatment approaches depending on the patient ’s symptom profile, although meth -
odological rigor was limited. Given the limitations in the literature to date, including overall lack of rigor, lack of 
comparative studies, limited replication, and small sample size, the field would benefit from the development of 
mechanism-informed treatments, rigorous randomized trials, and treatment development with an eye towards 
dissemination and implementation.   
1.Introduction 
Misophonia is an impairing condition, generally presenting in 
childhood or early adolescence, characterized by a decreased tolerance 
to specific sounds or stimuli associated with these sounds, known as 
“triggers ” [50]. The term misophonia was originally coined in 2002 [24] 
with the literature gradually expanding thereafter. These triggers elicit a 
range of negative emotional, physiological, and behavioral responses, 
often leading to avoidance of triggers and significant functional 
impairment [41,50] . Triggers are typically related to oral and nasal 
sounds produced by other people, such as chewing and breathing, but 
can include a broad range of typically benign auditory stimuli, such as 
tapping or scratching [20,51] . Responses to triggers include agitation, 
anger, disgust, and/or anxiety, as well as a “fight-or-flight ” autonomic 
response [4,13,41] . Misophonia commonly presents with co-occurring 
depression and anxiety disorders, and less commonly with OCD, Tour-
ette’s syndrome, ADHD, autism, panic disorder, personality disorders, 
and suicidality [6,30,45,55] . Regarding the underlying pathophysi -
ology, brain-body connectivity mechanisms have been proposed based on functional neuroimaging findings revealing increased activation of 
the anterior insula in individuals with misophonia, as well as increased 
connectivity between cortical sensory and orofacial motor processing 
pathwaysCavanna and Seri [5,26;27] . 
To date, variable treatment approaches for misophonia have been 
reported. With several notable exceptions, majority of the literature 
consists of case reports implementing a range of psychotherapy tech-
niques, and medications either in isolation or combination with psy-
chotherapy [3,8,38,40,54,58] . Psychotherapeutic interventions include 
various forms of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Exposure Ther-
apy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavior 
Therapy (DBT), and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing 
(EMDR). Medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibiters 
(SSRIs), stimulants, anti-psychotics, and β-Blockers. In addition, one 
randomized controlled trial supported the efficacy of group CBT relative 
to a waitlist control with treatment components including task con-
centration, positive affect labeling, stimulus manipulation, and arousal 
reduction [21–22]. Due to the paucity of experimental trials, proto -
colized practice parameters for the treatment of misophonia remain

2elusive. 
Misophonia research is increasing in breadth and scope, with new 
research exploring prevalence, symptomatology, phenomenology, de-
mographics, and comorbidities [16,21,31,14] . Methodologically 
rigorous research on treatment interventions remains limited, and there 
has not yet been a systematic review to synthesize data and overall ef-
fects of extant treatments. This review extracts and synthesizes research 
from case series, case studies, open trials, and randomized-control trials 
on the treatment of misophonia to examine the preliminary evidence for 
various treatment modalities and identify current data trends, which 
will provide guidance for clinical practice and future research. 
2.Methods 
This review is reported according to the PRISMA checklist extension 
for scoping reviews [34]. First, the rationale and study objective were 
defined. Next, the relevant studies were identified using a broad, 
comprehensive approach to the literature. Studies were selected based 
on pre-determined search parameters. The results were summarized, 
synthesized, and reported. The findings were then reviewed by experts 
in the field. 2.1. Eligibility criteria (PICO) 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were formulated using the PICO 
framework. 
Population : We included records if they reported case or cohort 
studies, case series, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or non-RCTs 
where the effectiveness of a treatment was documented and tested, 
and misophonia was the primary complaint/treatment target. All ages 
and comorbidities were included. Only studies published in English 
were included. 
Intervention : We considered all treatment interventions if the pur-
pose of the study was to describe a patient or patients where the primary 
or secondary complaint was misophonia. Regardless of whether miso-
phonia was the patient ’s primary or secondary concern, the treatment 
had to specifically target misophonia symptoms. Examples of studies we 
did not include were reviews, non-peer reviewed studies, editorials, 
manuals, or guidelines. We did not include records without a full-text 
translation into English. 
Comparison : Studies that did and did not include comparison 
treatments were included. 
Outcome : To be included, studies had to have defined misophonia 
symptom severity and either quantitative or qualitative reporting of 
treatment outcomes.

32.2. Information sources and search strategy 
On May 27th, 2022 we conducted a search of PubMed, PsycINFO, 
Cochrane Central, and Google Scholar using the keywords “misopho -
nia”, “decreased sound tolerance ”, “selective sound sensitivity ”, or 
“decreased sound sensitivity. ” Additionally, the reference section of 
relevant sources was searched to locate other related sources that were 
not found in the initial primary search. 
2.3. Study selection 
All abstracts were assessed by an independent reviewer. Only records 
addressing misophonia treatment were included in the initial screen. 
This was followed by a full text review, which was checked by a second 
reviewer to determine if eligibility criteria were met by all included 
studies (See Fig. 1). Reviewers (3) included a clinical psychologist, a 
post-doctoral clinical psychology fellow, and a medical student under 
the supervision of the last author. Discrepancies arose regarding the 
inclusion of studies where misophonia symptoms were not the direct 
target of therapy but included as a comorbidity. It was deemed these 
reports did not meet initial eligibility criteria, leading to a consensus 
decision to exclude them. One exception to this was the study by Naguy 
et al. (2022), which was deemed relevant because of the proposed 
mechanism by which the medication, targeting primary ASD symptoms, 
also treated secondary misophonia symptoms. 
2.4. Outcomes and prioritization 
The primary outcome was improvement on standardized misophonia 
severity questionnaires, where the most commonly utilized measures 
included the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S; [41], the upda -
ted Amsterdam Misophonia Scale-Revised (AMISOS-R; [42]), and the 
Misophonia Questionnaire [56]. The A-MISO-S and AMISOS-R, which 
were modeled after the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scales 
[15,48] , are the most widely used measures in the misophonia literature 
to date. Psychometric properties have been reported including good 
internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity and treatment 
sensitivity [22]. The Misophonia Questionnaire has demonstrated good 
internal consistency, and convergent and divergent validity [56,59] . 
Other validated outcome measures used included the Clinical Global 
Impressions Improvement (CGI-I) Scale [17] and the Children ’s Global 
Assessment Scale (CGAS). Outcome measures that were less commonly 
used in the included studies are the Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS) 
scale [3], Navaco Anger Scale (NAS) [38], and the Misophonia Assess -
ment Questionnaire (MAQ) [9–11]. 
3.Results 
After removing duplicate records, 169 records were obtained for 
initial screening. From these, 130 were excluded because they did not 
study misophonia treatment. Of the remaining 36 papers sought for full- 
text review, 3 were excluded for various reasons (see Fig. 1) Of the 33 
included reports, 1 was an RCT, 1 was an open label study, and 31 were 
case studies/series. Of the 31 case studies/series, 15 were primarily CBT 
interventions (9 of which included exposure-based techniques), 3 
involved counter-conditioning alone, 1 was DBT, 1 was ACT, 1 was 
EMDR, 2 were TRT, 6 were primarily pharmacological interventions, 
and 2 reported a combination of both therapy and pharmacological in-
terventions. The characteristics of included trials are shown in Table 1. 
All interventions were given to individuals diagnosed with misophonia 
using various clinical criteria, with most studies utilizing the A-MISO-S 
[41]. 
The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess risk of bias in 
included randomized control trials (Higgins & Green, 2011). The Jager 
et al. [22] RCT has an overall low risk of bias based on criteria such as 
the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of 
reported results. 
3.1. Cognitive-Behavioral therapy 
Although results are both preliminary and heterogeneous, of all the 
treatment approaches studied to date, cognitive-behavioral therapy 
(CBT) is the most consistently effective. The only randomized-controlled 
trial published to date, by Jager and colleagues (2020), studied 54 adult 
patients randomized to either weekly group-based CBT or similar 
duration wait-list. CBT involved a closed group setting of 9 patients per 
group, and CBT components included exercises in task concentration, 
positive affect labeling, stimulus manipulation, and arousal reduction. 
Stimulus manipulation involved counter-conditioning methods, a form 
of exposure that will be discussed in detail later. Therapists also pro-
vided psychoeducation around eating norms to both the individuals and 
their families. After 3 months of weekly group therapy, patients showed 
an average decrease of 9.7 points on the AMISOS-R (95% CI,  12.0 to 
 7.4; p D.001, d 1.97), and 37% were rated as treatment responders 
on the CGI-I. Effects were modest and maintained at 1-year follow-up, 
suggesting short and long-term benefit for misophonia symptoms. The 
same research group previously conducted an open label trial with a 
similar CBT approach. After 7–8 group CBT sessions, 90 total patients 
reported a mean reduction of 4.5 points on the A-MISO-S. Overall, 
nearly half of the patients experienced at least a 30% reduction on the A- 
MISO-S [43]. Lewin et al. [28] published a case series (N 4) from an 
ongoing RCT examining the effect of a transdiagnostic CBT protocol 
known as the Unified Protocol. Results indicate mild improvement, 
especially in severe cases. 
Counter-conditioning, a common behavioral technique across case 
studies, involves pairing a stimulus that evokes a specific behavior with 
a behavior that is incompatible with it. Counter-conditioning for miso-
phonia involves pairing a positive auditory stimulus (e.g., music) with 
the negative (often reduced in intensity) conditioned stimulus (e.g., 
chewing) while inducing physiological relaxation incompatible with the 
typical tension response evoked when encountering a trigger (e.g., 
through progressive muscle relaxation). It was first implemented for 
misophonia by Dozier [11,9 –10] in a case series. Anecdotal improve -
ment was reported after anywhere from 7 to 23 treatment sessions of 30 
min each [9–11]. Subsequent studies, including the seminal study by 
Jager and colleagues (2020), have implemented counter-conditioning 
components in conjunction with other techniques [43,7] . 
CBT has been shown to be beneficial in multiple case studies, in both 
in-person [1,2,3,38] and virtual formats [57]. Of the patients in these 
studies (n 7), all were young females ranging from 16 to 22 years old 
and the most common reaction was anger [1,2,3,38,57] . There was a 
wide range of symptom improvement, with one case improving from 
moderate severity (11 on the A-MISO-S) to subclinical (4) severity [1] 
while another case showed improvement from extreme (23) to moderate 
(12) severity [1]. Of the CBT components utilized, Roushani and col-
leagues (2021) implemented a similar model as described by Schneider 
and Arch [40]. Others utilized cognitive reappraisal components, 
behavioral components to move from avoidance to healthy coping 
strategies, and relaxation exercises [3]. 
3.2. CBT with exposure therapy 
Case studies have also examined CBT protocols that incorporate 
various exposure techniques. While some report treatment with co-
morbid OCD, all the exposures in these studies were directed towards 
misophonia symptoms specifically. Cases were mostly young females 
although ages ranged widely across all studies (10–35 years). Further, 
symptom profile as well as primary outcomes varied across the 13 pa-
tient cases. In general, length of therapy was longer and more intense 
compared with the studies of non-exposure-based CBT alone, ranging 
from 2 to as many as 23 total sessions [8,37] . Therapy was typically S.A. Mattson et al.

7divided into distinct phases, with exposure comprising one of the pha-
ses. Exposure was defined variably among studies with some utilizing 
traditional graded exposure [46], while others were grounded in newer 
inhibitory learning models of extinction learning [8]. For example, 
Dover and McGuire [8] implemented 23 total sessions of a family-based 
CBT approach, with distinct phases of habit reversal training, parent 
management training, and exposure therapy. This report showed a 70% 
reduction in misophonia symptoms. Family accommodation behaviors 
also significantly decreased, suggesting some added benefit to a family- 
based approach. 
Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) is a type of treatment aimed at 
decreasing the strength of negative reactions through exposure to a 
continuous low-level broadband sound in which the patient has variable 
levels of control over the environment, sounds used, and duration of 
sound exposure. Jastreboff and Jastreboff [23] report clinical 
improvement in 86% of 201 total patients based on self-reported mea-
sures of functional impairment. Misophonia symptom reduction (from 
severe (17) to mild (6) based on the AMISOS-R) was also achieved 
through a combination of TRT, desensitization techniques, and habitu -
ation therapy (Vanaja and Abigail, 2020). 
3.3. “Third-Wave ” therapy approaches 
Two case studies implemented “third wave ” behavioral approaches, 
including ACT and DBT. One case study described an adolescent female 
with a primary response of intense rage who was unsuccessfully treated 
with exposure-based CBT. While on paroxetine (25 mg) to treat anxiety, 
the patient received DBT focusing on mindfulness and distress tolerance 
skills for 5 days a week during a 7-week partial hospitalization program. 
A-MISO-S scores reduced from extreme (22) to moderate (10) [25]. 
Another third-wave case study implemented mindfulness and 
acceptance-based techniques to target high levels of anger and disgust in 
a 17-year-old male patient [40]. Treatment also integrated DBT and CBT 
interventions. After 10 sessions, severity ratings on the A-MISO-S scale 
decreased by 50% from moderate (14) to minimal (7). 
3.4. Pharmacotherapy 
The most widely reported medication class used to treat misophonia 
was selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) [39,53,58] . Three 
case studies of variable demographics (one adolescent female, one adult 
female with comorbid OCD and one adult male with comorbid anxiety 
and depression) showed responses to SSRIs ranging from complete to 
partial remission of misophonia symptoms [39,53,58] . Sarigedik and 
Yurteri [39] indicated a response time of one month on fluoxetine 20 mg 
daily, and continued improvement with increased dose (30 mg) at 3 
months. Zuschlag and Leventhal [58] reported remission of symptoms 
after 3 weeks of sertraline 150 mg daily. 
In certain cases with specific comorbidities, treatment of a primary 
behavioral impairment led to the secondary improvement of misophonia 
symptoms. For example, in a 4-year-old with autism, low-dose risperi -
done reportedly resolved misophonia symptoms (Naguy et al., 2022). In 
a 14-year-old with comorbid ADHD, a combination of methylphenidate 
and CBT reportedly improved distractibility symptoms in addition to 
improving distress tolerance to misophonia triggers [32]. Lastly, in a 
case of misophonia with primarily autonomic symptoms (e.g., increased 
heart rate, sweating, rapid breathing), propranolol one hour before each 
meal reduced symptoms from severe (15) to subclinical (2) levels on the 
A-MISO-S [54]. 
4.Discussion 
To date, there has been a paucity of research on the treatment of 
misophonia. This systematic review highlights preliminary efficacy for 
one non-exposure-based CBT protocol [22], as well as preliminary case 
study-level support for a number of other psychotherapeutic approaches. The only randomized control trial to date [22] describes a 
group therapy CBT approach, implementing task concentration exer-
cises, positive affect labeling, stimulus manipulation, and arousal 
reduction techniques. This approach was significantly superior to a 
waitlist control in misophonia severity reduction, and improvements 
were maintained post-CBT treatment and at 1 year follow up. Across this 
randomized trial and many other case studies, CBT-based interventions 
with variable core components demonstrated potential in the treatment 
of misophonia. This is consistent with previous literature on related 
disorders (e.g., anxiety, OCD) and we posit that this may be due to 
similar mechanisms (e.g., associative and non-associative learning re-
sponses to aversive stimuli) underlying the development and mainte -
nance of symptoms across these conditions [33]. CBT is believed to 
target maladaptive learned responses to trigger sounds through cogni -
tive techniques such as positive affect labeling and acceptance, as well as 
behavioral strategies such as exposure and affect regulation skills. 
However, the high prevalence of anger and disgust responses, as well as 
the sensory nature of misophonia, suggest the underlying mechanism of 
misophonia may be related to but distinct from primary anxiety disor -
ders [35,56] . Targeting anger and disgust responses through nuanced 
therapy approaches beyond CBT may prove to be an effective approach. 
Several case reports described benefit from exposure-based CBT 
protocols utilizing a traditional habituation model of exposure. How-
ever, exposure therapy is not widely accepted as a credible intervention 
among individuals with misophonia [47], and it has been argued that 
exposure therapy can have deleterious effects [12]. An inhibitory 
learning model may better target the unique symptoms of misophonia 
by emphasizing distress tolerance and violating expectancies about 
triggers by using more adaptive approaches when confronting them 
(Frank & McKay, 2019). While there is promise in various CBT pro-
tocols, it is unclear what components are most effective and contribute 
to response. For example, the current protocols described by Jager et al. 
[22] and Schroder et al. [43] include elements that are not classically 
thought of as exposure, but carry elements of exposure in the intro-
duction of trigger sounds during counter-conditioning procedures, 
which involve pairing a misophonia trigger with a pleasant stimulus to 
develop a new positive association with the trigger. It remains unclear 
which of these modalities contribute to the positive outcomes reported 
in these initial reports; dismantling studies are needed to understand 
core treatment components that contribute to outcome. 
There is preliminary evidence for third-wave behavioral approaches 
such as ACT and DBT, suggesting possible benefits from implementing 
mindfulness and acceptance techniques. Mindfulness techniques may 
provide patients with an adaptive framework for engaging with distress 
evoking stimuli by taking a present-centered, non-judgmental perspec -
tive. Mindfulness techniques may assist in creating psychological dis-
tance from negative thoughts while fostering openness towards a 
patient ’s anger [40], allowing them to strategically re-engage in 
meaningful activities, even if misophonia symptoms are ongoing. 
Moving beyond case report data is necessary to understand the potential 
utility of interventions like ACT for misophonia. 
While the psychotherapeutic literature is at a relatively early stage, 
research on pharmacotherapy for misophonia is in its infancy. Case re-
ports provide preliminary directions. For example, the autonomic 
arousal implicated in misophonic responses [13] can be directly 
dampened by specific medications such as β-Blockers [54]. As research 
continues taking steps towards understanding the underlying neuro- 
physiological mechanisms of misophonia [44], future research should 
focus on understanding how the physiologic response can be targeted 
with appropriate medications. 
While overall response rates to published CBT reports for misophonia 
were generally positive, the lack of validated measures beyond the 
single-item CGI-I reveal a gap in the current treatment research para-
digm. Psychometrically valid measures of misophonia symptom severity 
are needed to determine if treatment modalities are consistently effi-
cacious. The A-MISO-S measures, modeled after the Y-BOCS, are most S.A. Mattson et al.

Personalized Medicine in Psychiatry 39–40 (2023) 100104
8often used. However, it remains unclear if the self-report nature of this 
scale is optimal (relative to clinician rated administrations, as the Y- 
BOCS is done); concerns about self-reported Y-BOCS ratings have been 
reported, especially items that tap into resistance and control di-
mensions of symptom severity [49]. Based on our clinical experience, we 
hypothesize similar issues may exist in self-reported misophonia 
severity. 
Despite the first report of misophonia in the literature almost two 
decades ago, there exists no single frontline treatment for misophonia to 
date. This systematic review of misophonia treatments highlights the 
significant lack of strong empirical support for any interventions for 
misophonia. Several directions for future research are noted. First, and 
most broadly, development of mechanistically informed treatment 
protocols that have meaningful stakeholder engagement are needed. 
Treatment development efforts should engage multiple stakeholders (i. 
e., individuals with lived experience, clinicians, researchers) to develop 
robust and acceptable interventions that will translate well to real-world 
clinical settings. Second, future studies should focus on further re-
finements of promising extant interventions (e.g., dose of treatment, 
isolation of specific components) and replication by a second, inde-
pendent team. Third, third-wave and pharmacological approaches may 
hold promise but require considerable additional study. Fourth, as 
mentioned previously, limitations of the overall literature which impact 
the present study include a lack of robust comparative trials as well as a 
lack of psychometrically validated measures for diagnosis and 
measuring severity. Using the growing pool of psychometrically vali-
dated measures of misophonia (both currently published, and measures 
to be developed) in assessing treatment efficacy is necessary. While the 
misophonia intervention literature is at an early stage, there is an op-
portunity to use strong scientific methods to build on the foundational 
research that has been done to date to develop efficacious treatments 
that reducing suffering and improve quality of life for children and 
adults with misophonia.
