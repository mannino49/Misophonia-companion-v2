## ABSTRACT

Objective: The objective of this study was to compare patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with and without misophonia in terms of sociodemographic data, clinical features, and executive functions.

Method: This  study  included  39  patients  with  obsessive-compulsive  disorder  and  misophonia,  as  well  as  38  patients  with obsessive-compulsive disorder without misophonia. A sociodemographic data form, the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale,  the Yale-Brown  Obsessive-Compulsive  Scale  Symptom  Checklist,  a  structured  interview  form  for  the  Diagnostic  and Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Fifth  Edition  (DSM-5)  Disorders,  and  the  Hamilton  Depression  Rating  Scale  were administered to all patients. The executive functions of the patients were evaluated using the Digit Span Test, the Stroop Test, the Trail Making Test, the Verbal Fluency Test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and the Tower of London test.

Results: The  obsessive-compulsive  disorder  group  with  misophonia  had  a  higher  rate  of  dirtiness  obsession/cleaning compulsion, other compulsions, agoraphobia, and eating disorder comorbidities compared to the group without misophonia (p&lt;0.05). Additionally, patients with misophonia had significantly higher Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale obsession scores (p=0.016). However, no difference was found between the groups in terms of executive functions (p&gt;0.05).

Conclusion: The presence of high dirtiness obsessions, other compulsions, and agoraphobia comorbidity in in patients with obsessive-compulsive  disorder  and  misophonia  suggests  an  association  with  disgust  sensitivity,  sensory  phenomena,  and anxiety  sensitivity,  respectively,  in  obsessive-compulsive  disorder.  Contrary  to  expectations,  the  preservation  of  executive functions in misophonia can be interpreted as misophonia diverging from the OCD category.

## INTRODUCTION

Obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  is  a  mental disorder characterized by chronic, sometimes episodic,  repetitive  obsessions  and/or  compulsions that  cause  significant  distress  and  time  loss,  as  well as a notable deterioration in daily work, occupational functioning,  and  interpersonal  relationships  (1).

lifetime  prevalence of OCD is estimated to be 2-3%, with an equal incidence in men and women during adulthood, typically  manifesting  in  late  adolescence and early adulthood (2). In the Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Fifth  Edition (DSM-5),  OCD  is  recognized  as  a  distinct  clinical entity  separate  from  other  psychopathologies,  and it is no  longer  classified  under  anxiety  disorders. Instead, OCD is classified under obsessive-compulsive and  related  disorders  (OCRDs)  in  DSM-5,  alongside diagnoses such as trichotillomania, skin picking disorder,  hoarding  disorder,  and  body  dysmorphic disorder. This classification is based on similarities in clinical presentation, underlying etiologic factors, and neuropsychological processes (1).

Considering OCD as a single disease based on diagnostic classifications is insufficient for understanding OCD. OCD is accepted as a heterogeneous cluster in which various severe impairments  can  be  observed  in  different  cognitive areas due to its different clinical manifestations (such as early/late onset, symptom clusters, neurodevelopmental type) and overlapping phenomenologic  and  neurobiologic  aspects  with other psychopathologies  such  as  autism  and  tic disorders (3-5). Impairment in fronto-striato-thalamocortical  circuit  functions  in  patients  with  OCD  has been implicated in cognitive dysfunctions in OCD and conditions overlapping with other psychopathologies (6). Despite conflicting results in the literature, studies have reported that patients with OCD have impaired executive  functions  related  to  cognitive  flexibility, inhibition,  decision-making,  and  planning/problemsolving compared with healthy controls (7,8). Although cognitive impairments are not included in the diagnostic criteria of OCD, their adverse effects on the functioning of patients are known, and they are proposed to be endophenotypic features (9).

Misophonia was first described in the audiology literature in 2001 as an abnormal response to human sounds (10). Misophonia is seen with equal frequency in  men  and  women,  and  its  incidence  has  been found to be 6-20% (11,12) in university students and 13-18% in a community sample (13,14). Misophonia typically begins in childhood and adolescence, and affected  individuals  often  have  a  family  history  of misophonia (15).  Ordinary  sounds  such  as  clipping nails,  brushing  teeth,  eating,  breathing,  smelling, speaking, sneezing, yawning, walking, chewing gum, laughing, snoring, whistling, television sound, or  coughing  are  the  sounds  that  make  patients with misophonia uncomfortable or even angry (16).

These  sounds  can  cause  intense  anxiety  or  disgust and  avoidance  behavior,  significantly  affecting  the individual's functioning (10,17).

Misophonia is associated with various disorders such as OCD, specific phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder  (PTSD),  autism  spectrum  disorder,  and mood disorders.  Phenomenologically,  misophonia is  similar  to  OCD  in  that  it  focuses  on  a  specific sound,  leading  to  obsessive  engagement  with  it and  exhibiting  avoidance  behaviors  to  alleviate the  discomfort  associated  with  this  sound  (18). In  a  clinical  sample  study,  OCD  co-diagnosis  was found in 3-11% of patients with misophonia, making OCD one of the most common diagnoses (10,19).  Additionally,  a  significant  correlation  has been observed between obsessive-compulsive symptoms  and  the  severity  of  misophonia,  and the  presence  of  either  misophonia  symptoms  or an OCD diagnosis increases the risk of developing the  other  (11,19,20).  Although  the  treatment  of misophonia remains unclear, it has been reported that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is beneficial for individuals with misophonia (21), and exposure and response prevention therapies have been recommended,  especially  when  misophonia  cooccurs with OCD (22).

Some authors have suggested that misophonia should  be  classified  under  OCRDs  as  a  separate psychiatric disorder. The recommended diagnostic criteria are as follows: (A)  The presence or anticipation of  a  specific  sound,  produced  by  a  human  being (e.g.,  eating  sounds,  breathing  sounds),  provokes an impulsive aversive physical reaction that begins with  irritation or disgust  and  quickly  escalates to  anger.  (B) This  anger  triggers  a  profound  sense of loss of self-control, occasionally leading to aggressive  outbursts.  (C)  The  person  recognizes that the anger or disgust is excessive, unreasonable, or  disproportionate  to  the  circumstances  or  the provoking  stressor.  (D)  The  individual  tends  to either  avoid  the  misophonic  situation  or  endure encounters  with  the  misophonic  sound  situation despite experiencing intense discomfort, anger, or disgust. (E) The person's anger, disgust, or avoidance causes significant distress (i.e., the person is bothered by their anger or disgust)  or  substantial interference in their daily life. (F) The person's anger, disgust,  and  avoidance  are  not  better  explained by another disorder, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (e.g., disgust in someone with an obsession about contamination) or PTSD (10). However, due to

the lack of consensus on misophonia as a separate psychiatric disorder, it was not included in the DSM5 diagnostic classification.

Although  there  are  some  findings  supporting the relationship between misophonia and OCD, further studies are needed to examine the similarities between  the  two  conditions  in  terms  of  etiological, epidemiological,  neuropsychological  processes,  and treatment  interventions  for  misophonia  to  find  its place within the OCD spectrum. Some authors have claimed that the majority of patients with misophonia do  not  have  comorbidities  and  that  it  represents a separate psychiatric disorder (22). However, insufficient  research  on  this  subject  in  the  literature leaves  it  unclear  whether  misophonia  is  a  distinct disease or a variant/subtype/premorbid condition of an existing disorder.

It has been suggested that there may be abnormalities in the connections between the auditory, autonomic, and limbic systems in the neurobiology  of  the  disease.  Specifically,  abnormal functioning of the amygdala, a brain area associated with negative emotions, aversive learning, and attention processes, has been implicated (23). Recent studies  have  also  highlighted  abnormal  activation of  the  anterior  insula,  which  plays  a  major  role  in emotional  processes  and  sensory  perception  (24). There are a few studies with small sample sizes that have investigated cognitive functions in misophonia (17,25-27). These neurocognitive studies have emphasized  that  misophonia  might  be  associated with selective attention deficit rather than executive dysfunction. From this perspective, the preservation of  executive  functions  in  misophonia  may  be  an important  point  of  distinction  from  OCD,  but  more comprehensive studies are needed.

The  lack  of  sufficient  information,  the  absence  of inclusion  in  diagnostic  classifications,  and  the  gaps  in understanding  the  relationship  between  misophonia and  OCD  make  misophonia  an  intriguing  area  that requires  further  research.  We  believe  that  the  age  of onset, clinical features, and comorbidity rates of patients with  OCD  and  misophonia  may  differ,  and  they  may exhibit poorer  performance  on  neuropsychological tests.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  no  study  in  the literature  has  identified  differences  in  clinical  features and  executive  functions  between  patients  with  OCD with and without misophonia. Our study aimed to compare  patients  with  OCD  with  and  without misophonia in terms of sociodemographic data, clinical features, and executive functions.

## METHOD

## Participants

Patients who  presented  to  the  Health  Sciences University Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital  (Istanbul,  Turkiye) Psychiatry  Outpatient Clinic  and  were  diagnosed  with  OCD  according  to the  DSM-5  diagnostic  criteria  were  included  in  the study.  The  participants  were  between  the  ages  of 18-50 years, at least primary school graduates, and volunteers for the study. We re-evaluated the patients from  a  diagnostic  perspective  and  assigned  them to  two  separate  groups  based  on  the  presence  of misophonia. Considering the difference between the groups with a medium effect size (effect size=0.55), the alpha significance level was set at 0.05, and a sample size of 42 for each group was calculated to achieve 80% power (G*Power Version 3.1.6).  Accordingly,  it was planned to include 45 individuals in each group. Once the planned number of patients was reached for one group, no further patients were included in that group, while the patients referred to the other group  continued  to  be  evaluated  until  the  desired number  was  reached.  Six  patients  with  moderateto-severe  depressive  disorder  and  12  patients  who could not complete their neuropsychiatric tests were excluded from the study. A total of 77 patients (39 with OCD and misophonia, and 38 with OCD without misophonia) were included in the study. Individuals diagnosed with dementia, psychotic disorder, bipolar  disorder,  or  intellectual  disability  according to  the  DSM-5  diagnostic  criteria,  as  well  as  those with  known  chronic  internal/neurological  diseases (e.g., hypothyroidism,  diabetes  mellitus,  epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, previous cerebrovascular disease, and  malignancy)  were  excluded.  Additionally,  to minimize  interference  in the neuropsychological tests,  patients  with  active  alcohol  and  substance use disorders (28), those with a score of 17 or higher on  the  Hamilton  Depression  Rating  Scale  (HDRS) indicating  moderate-to-severe  depression  (29),  or those with an active suicide risk were also excluded.

The  patients  were  diagnosed  with  misophonia after being evaluated according to the misophonia diagnostic  criteria  defined  by  Schröder  et  al.  (10). A  sociodemographic  data  form,  the  Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive  Scale  (Y-BOCS)  and  YaleBrown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Symptom Checklist  (YBOCS),  and  HDRS  were  administered to  all  participants  through  clinical  interviews.  The patients'  comorbidities  were  evaluated  using  the Structured  Clinical  Interview  for  DSM-5  Disorders

(SCID-5-CV), a structured interview form. The following executive functioning tests were conducted on the participants: the Digit Span Test (DST),  Stroop  Test  (ST),  Trail  Making  Test  (TMT), Verbal  Fluency Test  (VFT),  Wisconsin  Card  Sorting Test  (WCST),  and  the  Tower  of  London  (ToL)  test. After  explaining  the  purpose  and  design  of  the research  to  the  participants,  their  consent  was obtained.  The  study  was  approved  by  the  Ethics Committee  of  the  Health  Sciences  University  Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital (Date and Number: 31.12.2019 - 2612).

## Assessment Instruments

## Sociodemographic Data Form

This  form,  completed  by  a  physician  during  the interview,  records  the  individual's  age,  sex  (female/ male), educational  status  [(a) primary  school,  (b) secondary  school,  (c) high  school, (d) university, indicating the total number  of years of study], marital  status  [(a)  single,  (b)  married,  (c)  divorced, (d)  widowed],  employment  status  [(a)  working,  (b) unemployed,  (c)  retired,  (d)  student,  (e)  housewife], history of previous or ongoing physical illness, and age of onset of OCD and illness. It also includes questions about  the  duration  of  drug  use,  history  of  alcohol, cigarette, and substance use, and whether there is a history of mental illness in the family.

## Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS)

Developed by Hamilton to assess  the  severity  of depression  in  patients  diagnosed  with  depression, this scale consists of 17 questions and is completed by the interviewer (30). The Turkish version of the HDRS was used in the study (31).

## Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)

The  Y-BOCS  was  developed  by  Goodman  et  al. (32,33) to measure the type and severity of obsessivecompulsive  symptoms.  It  consists  of  a  total  of  19 items,  with  scores  included  for  the  first  10  items. Questions  1-5  evaluate  obsessions,  while  questions 6-10  evaluate  compulsions.  The  scale  also  includes a  symptom  checklist  to  investigate  the  distribution of symptoms. The Turkish version of the Y-BOCS was used in the study (34).

## Digit Span Test (DST)

The DST was developed by Wechsler to measure attention and concentration (35). It consists of two parts:  forward  and  backward  digit  span.  In  the forward digit span, participants are asked to repeat the numbers given to them in the same order. In the backward digit span, they are asked to repeat the numbers in reverse order. Test normative data were collected as part of the BILNOT battery (36).

## Stroop Test (ST)

The ST measures the ability to change perceptual setups in response to changing demands and under the influence of interference. In other words, it assesses focused attention and information processing speed (37). It is considered the most selective assessment of inappropriate  stimulus  inhibition  and  is  sensitive  to orbitofrontal  cortex  damage.  The  Turkish  version  of the ST was used in the study (38).

## Verbal Fluency Test (VFT)

The  VFT  is  used  to  assess  sustained  attention, fluency, and mental flexibility. The VFT was performed in  Turkish  using  the  letters  K,  A,  and  S.  Norms  for the  Turkish  version  of  the  test  were  collected  in  a psychology graduate study (39).

## Trail Making Test (TMT)

The TMT consists of two parts: A and B. It assesses attention,  motor  speed,  visual  scanning,  cognitive flexibility, set-shifting, response inhibition, and susceptibility  to  interference  (37,40).  Part  A  of  the TMT  evaluates  processing  speed  based  on  visual scanning ability, while part B evaluates the ability to shift between sets of stimuli, complex attention, and sequential processing (41).

## Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)

The  WCST  evaluates  skills  such  as  perseveration, working memory, abstraction ability, conceptual flexibility, complex  attention,  maintaining  attention, maintaining goal-directed behavior, and inhibiting inappropriate  responses.  The  validity  and  reliability study of the test  in Turkish  society  was  conducted  by Karakas et al. (42).

## Tower of London Test (ToL)

The ToL was developed by Tim Shallice in 1982. It is an executive function test that is sensitive to planning and  problem-solving  skills  (43).  The  Turkish  validity and reliability studies for the ToL were conducted by Atalay et al. (43).

## Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package  for  the  Social  Sciences  (SPSS)  20.0  for Windows.  Descriptive  statistics  are  presented  as

Student's  t-test  was  used  to  compare numerical  variables  between  two  independent groups  for  normally  distributed  data,  while  the Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-normally distributed data. The Chi-square test was used to analyze  ratios  between  groups.  Nonparametric analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  (Quades's)  was used to compare neuropsychological test results while controlling for age and educational status. The statistical alpha significance level was set at p&lt;0.05.

## Patients with OCD with and without Misophonia

Table  1  compares  the  clinical  features  of  patients with  OCD  with  and  without  misophonia.  There were  no  significant  differences  between  the  two groups in terms of age, sex, and education (p&gt;0.05). The  mean  age  of  disease  onset  was  lower  in patients  with  misophonia compared to the group without  misophonia,  showing  a  significant  trend (t=1.952,  p=0.055).  Patients  with  misophonia  had significantly  higher Y-BOCS  obsession  scores  than those without misophonia (t=-2.474, p=0.016). There were  no  significant differences between patients  with  and  without  misophonia  in  HDRS, Y-BOCS compulsion score, Y-BOCS total score, disease  duration,  and  drug  use  (p&gt;0.05).  Patients with OCD and misophonia had significantly higher rates of cleaning obsessions and other compulsions (excessive asking and touching) compared to those without misophonia (p&lt;0.05). There was no difference  between  the  groups  in  other  types  of obsessions and compulsions (p&gt;0.05).

Among  all  patients  with  OCD,  49.3%  had  at least  one  anxiety  disorder,  32.5%  had  at  least  one diagnosis from the Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders category, and 16.9% had at least one comorbidity of depressive disorders (dysthymic disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder). There was  no  significant  difference  in  the  comorbidity rates between patients with misophonia and those

## DISCUSSION

## Neuropsychological Test Findings

The comparison of neuropsychological test results between  patients  with  OCD  with  and  without misophonia is shown in Table 3. Patients with OCD and  misophonia  had  significantly  lower  scores  in TMT-A  (p=0.039),  ToL  application  time  (p=0.008), and ToL time violations (p=0.021) compared to  patients  without  misophonia.  There  was  no significant difference  between  the  two  groups in  terms  of  ST-interference  time,  WCST,  VFT,  DST, TMT-B, TMT interference time, and other parameters of  the  ToL  (p&gt;0.05).  After  conducting  ANCOVA analysis  while  controlling  for  age  and  years  of education, the significant differences in TMT-A, ToL application time, and ToL time violations between patients  with  OCD  with  and  without  misophonia disappeared (p&gt;0.05).

Our study compared patients with OCD with and  without  comorbid  misophonia  in  terms  of sociodemographic  and  clinical  characteristics, as well  as  executive  functions.  It  is  the  first  study  in this  field.  Our  findings  demonstrated  that  patients with  OCD  and  misophonia  had  significantly  higher Y-BOCS-obsession scores, dirtiness obsession/ cleaning  compulsions,  other  compulsion  subtypes, agoraphobia, and eating disorder comorbidities compared  to  those  without  misophonia.  However, in further analyses where age and educational status were controlled, no differences were found between the groups in terms of executive functions.

According  to  our  findings,  patients  with  OCD and  misophonia  had  significantly  higher  rates  of dirtiness  obsession/cleaning  compulsion  compared to  those  without  misophonia.  Misophonia  can  be triggered  by  intolerable  and  disturbing  stimuli  such as  chewing,  smacking,  and  burping,  depending  on individual  sensitivity  (44).  People  with  misophonia may  experience  emotional  reactions  like  disgust, anger,  and  irritability  towards  auditory  and  visual stimuli, and  they  may  exhibit  behaviors  such  as avoidance, escape, and confrontation (17). Studies on

OCD  have  specifically  highlighted  the  relationships between dirtiness/contamination obsessions and the  experience  of  disgust  (45).  While  anxiety  is  the most  prominent  emotion  associated  with  acquiring cleaning  and  washing  rituals,  recent  research  has revealed the potential significance of disgust in this process as well (46). Abnormalities in specific neural circuits of the limbic system may contribute to disgust sensitivity  in  both  OCD  and  misophonia  (24).  The reasons for the higher rates of dirtiness obsessions in patients  with  misophonia  in  our  study  are  currently unknown and require further investigation.

Furthermore, our findings indicated that patients with OCD and misophonia had a significantly higher rate of other compulsion subtypes compared to those without misophonia. These subtypes include mental rituals beyond checking and counting, excessive listmaking, the need to say, ask, or confess, and touching, hitting,  or  rubbing.  Among  these  items,  our  patient group  specifically  reported  a  need  for  touching/ hitting.  These conditions,  also known  as  sensory phenomena, were initially described in patients with Tourette's syndrome (TS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by atypical sensory responses, sudden-onset  vocal  and  motor  tics. They  were  later observed  in  patients  with  OCD  (47).  Studies  have reported  that  sensory  phenomena  may  serve  as  a valuable  dimensional  measure  in  subtyping  OCD (48).  It  has  also  been  noted  to  be  more  common  in early-onset  and  tic-related  OCD  (47).  Interestingly, increased  activation in the insular region, which plays  a  critical  role  in  interceptive  signal  perception and emotional processes, has been implicated in the etiology of sensory  phenomena  and  misophonia (24,49).  Both  sensory  phenomena  and  misophonia are  highly  correlated  with  perfectionism,  which  is  a phenotypic component of OCD (22,50). Additionally, a  report  published  by  the  International  College  of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders (ICOCS) suggested a transition between OCD, TS, and misophonia (51,52). Although the rates of comorbidity with tic disorders were lower in  our  study  compared  to  the  literature, patients  diagnosed  with  tic  disorders  were  found in  the  misophonia  group  (53).  Some  authors  have documented concurrent misophonia in pediatric OCD and tic disorders and proposed that misophonia may be  associated  with  neurodevelopmental  conditions, particularly in the context of sensory sensitivity syndrome (52). In our study, the earlier onset of OCD and  the  higher  frequency  of  sensory  phenomena in the  misophonia  patient  group  may  suggest  a relationship  between  the  presence  of  misophonia and a neurodevelopmental condition. However, there is insufficient data in the literature on this subject.

Studies  have  shown  that  OCD  is  often  comorbid with other mental disorders (54). It has been reported that OCD is commonly accompanied by depressive and anxiety disorders (55). In our study, the most frequent comorbidity was anxiety disorders, as moderate and severe major depressive disorder cases were excluded. Patients  with  OCD  and  misophonia  in  our  study were  found  to  have  a  higher  prevalence  of  anxiety disorders  compared  to  those  without  misophonia. Among  anxiety  disorders,  the  comorbidity  rates  of agoraphobia  were  particularly  high.  Although  there is  still  a  limited  number  of  studies  on  comorbidities in misophonia, a study with a small sample reported that 11% of patients with misophonia had comorbid agoraphobia (56). On the other hand, Erfanian et  al. (2019)  (19)  illustrated  that  misophonia  and agoraphobia shared environmental triggers, exhibited avoidance behavior towards these triggers, and were clinically similar due to the accompanying antecedent anxiety,  a  suggesting  a  likelihood  of  co-occurrence diagnostically.  Consistent  with  this,  the  incidence  of agoraphobia was high in patients with misophonia in our study. One study emphasized the mediating role of  anxiety  in  the  relationship  between  misophonia and various psychiatric disorders (57).

In general, the autonomic nervous system responses in misophonia, such as arousal symptoms (tightness in the chest and head, tachycardia, sweating, hyperthermia) and negative emotional reactivity (disgust, distress, anxiety, anger, and irritability), coincide with findings observed in anxiety disorders.  In  fact,  one  study  linked  misophonia  to anxiety  sensitivity  (20).  Anxiety  sensitivity  refers  to an  intense  fear  that  anxiety-related  sensations  and symptoms can have  negative  physical  and/or  social consequences,  and  it  is  considered  a  precursor  to anxiety disorders.

Individuals  with  high  anxiety  sensitivity  tend  to enter an alarm state when experiencing anxiety due to their fears, which can exacerbate their anxiety (58). The  same  study  found  that  misophonia  symptoms were more prevalent in individuals with high anxiety sensitivity and were associated with obsessions rather than compulsions (20). Similarly, in our study, participants with misophonia had significantly higher Y-BOCS obsession scores compared to those without misophonia. On the other hand, the avoidance behavior  associated  with  anxiety  towards  specific situations/animals in phobias  and  the avoidance

behavior observed in response to auditory stimuli in misophonia  are  similar.  This  suggests  a  potentially strong correlation between various phobic avoidance behaviors driven by anxiety within the patient group with misophonia.

In  our  study,  there  was  a  significantly  higher frequency of comorbidity with binge eating disorder in  the  group  with  misophonia  compared  to  those without misophonia. Another study examining 15 patients diagnosed  with an eating disorder found  misophonia  in  three  individuals  (two  with anorexia  nervosa  and  one  with  bulimia  nervosa). It was  demonstrated  that  there  was  a  temporal relationship between the occurrence of misophonia and  eating  disorders  in  these  patients  (59).  In  a study investigating the comorbidities of 52 patients with  misophonia,  it  was  reported  that  17.3%  had an  eating  disorder,  and  the  severity  of  misophonia and anorectic symptoms were associated with these patients  (19).  One  of  the  most  distressing  sounds for patients with misophonia is the sound of eating, leading them to often avoid eating with their family or friends (60). This behavior may cause patients to deviate from regular eating patterns, lose their sense of control, and consume large amounts of food alone within a certain period. However, further studies are needed to gain a better understanding of the issue.

Contrary to our belief, the groups with and without misophonia performed similarly in terms of attention, cognitive flexibility, problem-solving, response inhibition,  verbal  fluency,  and  abstraction.  Patients with  OCD  and  misophonia  had  significantly  lower scores in TMT-A, ToL administration time, and ToL time violations  compared  to  those  without  misophonia. However, in  the  analysis  where  the  variables  of  age and  educational  status  were  fixed,  this  significant difference in psychomotor speed did not persist.

There  is  no  previous  study  in  the  literature comparing executive functions in OCD and misophonia.  Meta-analysis  studies  have  reported medium to large effect size impairments in executive function areas, such as cognitive flexibility, problem-solving,  decision-making,  and  inhibition, in  OCD  (7,8).  On  the  other  hand,  there  are  only  a few studies on misophonia with small sample sizes. One  study  found  that  patients  with  misophonia had poorer selective attention than patients with  tinnitus  when  exposed  to  triggering  sounds (26).  Another  study  found  that  individuals  with misophonia  had  difficulty  maintaining  alertness during attention tasks compared to a control group but did not find a significant difference in executive function (17). However, one study reported that the ST results in patients with misophonia were similar to those of healthy controls (25). In other words, no impairments  related  to  motor  inhibition,  focused attention, and selective attention were found in the misophonia group.

The aforementioned clinical studies indicate that misophonia may have impairments, particularly in the attention systems rather than executive functions, but there are conflicting results in this regard. In our study, we evaluated simple attention with the digit span test, focused and selective attention with the ST, sustained attention  with  the  verbal  fluency  test,  and  complex attention  with  the  verbal  fluency  and  WCST  tests. According  to  our  findings,  the  attention  processes of  patients  with  OCD  with  and  without  misophonia showed similar performance.

It is known that patients with misophonia experience attention difficulties only in the presence of  specific  disturbing  auditory  stimuli.  There  is  no evidence  to  suggest  that  patients  with  misophonia have impaired cognitive functions such as attention without  these  stimuli.  In  our  study,  patients  with misophonia  were  able  to  maintain  their  attention similar to those  without  misophonia  because  no disturbing stimuli were presented to our sample during the neuropsychological tests. Another explanation for the lack of difference between the groups is that, unlike OCD, misophonia may not affect executive functions. In terms of underlying mechanisms, abnormalities in the fronto-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit are specific to  OCD,  while  abnormalities  in  the  limbic  areas  are mostly associated with misophonia.

Although  attention  has  been  a  focal  point  in studies  on  misophonia  in  the  literature,  theoretical assumptions  have  been  made  regarding  potential impairments  in  emotion,  learning, and  memory within  the  neuropsychological  systems  underlying the  formation  of  the  misophonic  response  (23). Neuroimaging  studies  have  shown  abnormalities in  micro  and  macro  structures  in  the  white  matter of  patients  with  misophonia,  suggesting  potential effects on attention, social-emotional processes, and  facial  emotion  recognition  (61).  In  our  study, we were limited in the cognitive areas that could be examined. To investigate the presence of cognitive impairment in misophonia, future studies can explore different domains (e.g., memory, learning, decisionmaking, social cognition) using more comprehensive cognitive tests.

Our study aimed to investigate the impact of misophonia on clinical features and neuropsychological functions  in  patients  with  a  primary  diagnosis  of  OCD. To date, there have been no previous studies examining the presence  of  misophonia  in  patients  with  OCD. Misophonia is a complex condition that can coexist with various psychiatric disorders, but there is no consensus on whether it should be classified as a separate psychiatric disease. Some studies have linked misophonia to a range of psychiatric disorders such as TS, tic disorders, autism, neurodevelopmental disorders such as AttentionDeficit/Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD),  OCD  spectrum, anxiety  disorders,  and  PTSD  (62).  However,  none  of these  disorders  fully  match  the  clinical  presentation of  misophonia.  Interestingly,  contrary  to  expectations, some studies have found that the majority of individuals diagnosed  with  misophonia  do  not  have  significant psychiatric  comorbidities,  leading  to  suggestions  that misophonia should be considered a distinct psychiatric condition (19,63).

A study that explored the neural basis of misophonia proposed that it could be classified as a separate disorder (24). However, it is worth noting that most of the studies on  misophonia  have  primarily  focused  on  audiology patients (e.g., tinnitus, hyperacusis), university students, and individuals seeking family medicine services (11,12,20,63-65). There are very few studies that have  specifically  investigated  psychiatric  populations (19).  Therefore,  due  to  potentially  lower  psychiatric comorbidity rates and different clinical features in nonpsychiatric  sample  groups,  it  is  challenging  for  these findings  to  provide  a  comprehensive  understanding of misophonia's psychopathology and generalizability. Additionally,  research  in  this  area  is  limited  because patients  with  misophonic  symptoms  are  less  likely to  seek  treatment  specifically  for  these  symptoms  in psychiatric outpatient clinics (13).

From these perspectives, we believe that our study contributes  to  the  literature  as  it  evaluates  a  clinical sample. More studies are needed  to understand the nature, epidemiology, etiology, underlying neuropsychological factors, and treatment of misophonia in order to determine its classification. It is generally considered that misophonia falls within the realm of psychiatric disorders, and having a diagnostic framework may be beneficial when considering clinical implications  (44).  Based  on  the  phenomenological similarities between OCD and misophonia, Schröder et al. (10) suggested that misophonia should be classified as a separate psychiatric disorder under the category of  OCD. Remarkably, some studies have explored the relationship  between  misophonia  and  OCD,  as  well as  obsessive-compulsive  symptoms.  This  raises  the question of whether misophonia adequately meets the criteria to be included within the spectrum of OCRDs.

Diseases  within  the  OCD  spectrum  exhibit  similar behavioral patterns, share common neuropsychological processes,  have  high  rates  of  comorbidity  with  OCD in individuals or their families, and respond to similar treatment  approaches  (66).  Impairments  in  response inhibition in neurocognitive areas, a decrease in cognitive  flexibility,  and  an  increase  in  perseverative errors are considered prototypical features, especially in disorders within the OCD category (67,68). In our study, patients with misophonia performed similarly to those without  misophonia  in  terms  of  response  inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and perseverative error rates. The presence of misophonia diagnosis can be interpreted as not causing  impairment  in  cognitive flexibility areas but rather affecting response inhibition. In other words,  based  on  our  study,  it  can  be  suggested  that misophonia may not fit within the OCRDs category in terms of neuropsychological profile. However, further comprehensive studies are needed to determine whether  misophonia  should  be  included  under  the spectrum of OCRDs.

Additionally, there is a diagnostic similarity between misophonia and phobic disorders in terms of environmental triggers, antecedent anxiety symptoms, and phobic avoidance behaviors in response to triggering factors. Interestingly, in our study, we found a  high  frequency of comorbidity with agoraphobia in patients with misophonia, which can also be considered as phobic behavior towards triggering sounds. However, it  is  important  to  note  that  the  dominant  emotions in  anxiety  disorders  are  anxiety  and  fear,  whereas  in misophonia, they are anger, restlessness, and disgust.

Unfortunately,  in  our  study,  it  may  be  premature to comment  on  the  relationship  between  anxiety disorders and misophonia due to the lack of information on the trigger factors and the emotional and behavioral responses to these triggers in the misophonia group. Another  point  that  contributes  to  the  controversy surrounding the diagnosis of misophonia is the difficulty  in  establishing  clear  diagnostic  boundaries between  conditions  such  as  PTSD,  phobic  disorder, OCD,  sensory  sensitivity  syndrome,  and  misophonia, which increases the risk of misdiagnosis (63).

Our study has several limitations. Firstly, the heterogeneity of the patient group, including variations in medication use, new diagnoses, and comorbidities, may  have  influenced  the  results.  Due  to  the  high comorbidity rates of depressive and anxiety disorders in

OCD, the presence of these comorbid conditions, as well as factors such as drug therapy, may have influenced the  results  of  the  neuropsychological  test.  Secondly, the exclusion of individuals with HDRS scores &gt;17 and those with alcohol and substance use disorders, aimed at minimizing the impact on neuropsychological tests, may  have  affected  the  comorbidity  rates.  Therefore, conducting a study that includes all comorbidities and compares the rates in both groups would provide more accurate results. Thirdly, patients with misophonia were not evaluated audiologically, and possible differential diagnoses such as hyperacusis and tinnitus were not excluded.  A  multidisciplinary  approach  may  be  more accurate when diagnosing patients with misophonia. Additionally, the diagnoses of misophonia were solely  based  on  the  referenced  diagnostic  criteria, without  the  use  of  a  scale  to  measure  the  clinical characteristics, triggers, emotional and behavioral responses to triggers, and the severity of misophonia. This constitutes the greatest deficiency and limitation of our study. Furthermore, the small sample size makes it  difficult  to  generalize  our  results,  highlighting  the need for studies with larger patient populations. Finally, evaluating  cognitive  functions  solely  through  tests, without simultaneous neuroimaging, may have limited the reliability of the results in our study.

## CONCLUSION

Our  study  revealed  that  patients  with  OCD  and misophonia  had  higher  obsession  scores,  increased dirtiness obsessions, and exhibited other compulsions such as touching/hitting more frequently compared to those without misophonia. The presence of misophonia  may  intersect  with  subsets  of  sensory phenomena  and  disgust  sensitivity  within  the  OCD spectrum. Furthermore, the high prevalence of agoraphobia  in  the  OCD  group  with  misophonia suggests  that  these  patients  may  have  heightened anxiety sensitivity and frequently engage in avoidance behaviors.  Contrary  to  expectations,  there  was  no significant deterioration in the attention and executive functions  of  patients  with  OCD  in  the  presence  of misophonia. The preservation of executive functions in  misophonia  implies  a  divergence  from  the  OCD category, but further comprehensive  studies are necessary  to  investigate  this  matter.  Detecting  the presence  of  misophonia  may  hold  significance  as patients  with  OCD  exhibit  a  heterogeneous  clinical presentation,  comorbidity  patterns,  and  cognitive functions. Therefore,  larger-scale  studies  are  needed to generalize and validate our findings.
