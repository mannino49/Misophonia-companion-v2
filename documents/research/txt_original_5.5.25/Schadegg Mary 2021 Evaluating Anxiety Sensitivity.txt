Anxiety sensitivity ABSTRACT  
Misophonia is characterized by increased physiological and emotional reactivity to particular sounds (e.g., 
chewing), which has been associated with impulsive and aggressive behaviors. To better understand the 
expression of misophonia, the current study investigated the moderating role of anxiety sensitivity (AS) in the 
relation between misophonia and facets of aggression (i.e., anger, hostility, verbal aggression, and physical 
aggression). Participants (N 470; Mage 18.68 years; 74.0% female) included college students who endorsed 
misophonia symptoms and completed online self-report questionnaires. Four regression analyses were conducted 
to examine the interaction between misophonia symptoms and AS on each aggression facet. Results revealed that 
significant variance was accounted for in each facet of aggression, with the association between misophonia and 
anger, hostility, and verbal aggression (respectively) strengthening as increased. This study provides additional 
support for the association between misophonia and aggressive behavioral tendencies, suggesting AS may 
operate as a pivotal factor in the expression of anger and aggressive responses in misophonia. These findings 
implicate AS a potential treatment target that could enhance outcomes for patients struggling with misophonia.   
1.Introduction 
Misophonia is characterized by the intolerance of certain organic (e. 
g., chewing, breathing) and non-organic (e.g., pen clicking, writing) 
noises (Schroder et al., 2013 ), wherein these triggers elicit intense 
negative emotions (Dozier, 2015 ; Dozier & Morrison, 2017 ; Schroder 
et al., 2013 ) and physiological arousal (Cavanna & Seri, 2015 ; Dozier & 
Morrison, 2017 ; Edelstein et al., 2013 ). Prevalence rates in undergrad -
uate samples suggest as many as 20% of individuals experience miso-
phonia symptoms (Wu et al., 2014 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ), ranging from 
mildly annoying to extremely debilitating symptoms (Edelstein et al., 
2013 ). Misophonia has been linked to a wide range of disorders such as 
obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders (Dozier et al., 2017 ; Schroder 
et al., 2013 ), impulse control disorders (Robinson et al., 2018 ), post-
traumatic stress disorder (Schroder et al., 2013 ), eating disorders 
(Kluckow et al., 2014 ), tinnitus, phonophobia, and hyperacusis (Jas-
treboff & Jastreboff, 2015 ). Although misophonia has not yet been 
classified as a specific type of disorder, the heightened auditory sensi-
tivity and emotional distress appear to represent a unique syndrome that 
is not subsumed or accounted for by the presence of another disorder 
(Schroder et al., 2013 ; Taylor, 2017 ). The underpinnings of misophonia are not well understood; however, current theoretical and empirical 
work indicates complex interplay of neurological, physiological, and 
psychological factors (Brout et al., 2018 ; Potgieter et al., 2019 ). 
Although disgust, panic, and anxiety are common misophonic re-
sponses (Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ), reactions to misophonia stimuli tend 
to emphasize the emotional, physiological, and behavioral signatures of 
anger (Potgieter et al., 2019 ). Several studies have shown that trigger 
stimuli commonly elicit annoyance, irritation, rage, and anger (Dozier & 
Morrison, 2017 ; Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ; Schroder 
et al., 2013 ). These emotional reactions are accompanied by tension, 
clenched muscles, breathlessness, and increases in body temperature, 
blood pressure or heart rate (Dozier, 2015 ; Dozier & Morrison, 2017 ; 
Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ). 
While most individuals attempt to escape or avoid misophonia triggers 
(Dozier & Morrison, 2017 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ), approach-oriented 
behaviors are frequently reported, such as urges to confront others, 
thoughts of wanting to hurt others, hostility, and impulsive reactions 
(Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ). Further, aggression has 
been identified as the most prominent dysfunctional response (Rouw & 
Erfanian, 2018 ; Wu et al., 2014 ). For instance, Schroder et al. (2013) 
found that of 42 patients with misophonia symptoms, 59.5% reported

2misophonia stimuli provoked some form of aggression. Specifically, 
28.6% reported verbal aggression, 16.7% engaged in physical aggres -
sion toward objects, and 11.9% hit an (ex-) partner. Unfortunately, there 
is scant research examining the subsequent consequences of anger and 
aggression in misophonia; yet, aggression is generally associated with 
poor response to treatment (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2015 ), workplace 
violence (Dillon, 2012 ), and interpersonal difficulties across life do-
mains (e.g., divorce; Cavanna & Seri, 2015 ; Pasha et al., 2009 ; Zhou 
et al., 2017 ), suggesting additional impairment for those with 
misophonia. 
Given the potential short- and long-term consequences, further 
research is needed to understand the connection between misophonia 
and aggression. Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a well-established trans -
diagnostic process that has been implicated in a broad range of clinical 
syndromes (Smits et al., 2019 ). Individuals with elevated AS are likely to 
misinterpret physiological symptoms as aversive and catastrophize 
consequences of these symptoms as harmful, dangerous, or embarrass -
ing (Reiss & McNally, 1985 ). In addition to its role in mood and anxiety 
disorders (Naragon-Gainey, 2010 ), AS predicts engagement in high risk 
behaviors, such as non-suicidal self-injury (Dixon et al., 2019 ), suicide 
(Stanley et al., 2018 ) and substance use (Keough et al., 2018 ; McCaul 
et al., 2017 ). Across conditions, AS is theorized to amplify physiological 
arousal and the experience of distress (Taylor et al., 2007 ); thus, in the 
context of misophonia, AS may similarly exacerbate reactions to aver-
sive sounds. To this end, preliminary research has demonstrated AS is 
significantly correlated with misophonia severity (Cusack et al., 2018 ; 
McKay et al., 2018 ); however, the impact of AS on outcomes relevant to 
misophonia have not been investigated. 
The purpose of the current study is to enhance our understanding of 
misophonia by examining the moderating role of AS in the relation 
between misophonia symptoms and facets of aggression, including 
anger, hostility, verbal aggression, and physical aggression (Buss & 
Perry, 1992 ). Moderation analyses evaluate how a third variable effects 
the relationship between two variables by determining under what cir-
cumstances a relationship exists and whether it is strengthened or 
weakened by the third variable (Hayes & Rockwood, 2017 ). Existing 
theoretical models and empirical studies support AS as a moderator 
across a range of emotional and behavioral outcomes (e.g., Dixon et al., 
2014 ; Stathopoulou et al., 2018 ); thus, examining the moderating role of 
AS in misophonia may shed light on the expression of this condition. 
First, misophonia symptoms were hypothesized to be positively associ -
ated with AS and aggression facets. In addition, we hypothesized AS 
would moderate the association between misophonia and each aggres -
sion facet in a sample of undergraduate students. Specifically, it was 
predicted that AS would strengthen the association between misophonia 
symptom severity and levels of aggression, after controlling for sex 
(Archer, 2004 , 2009 ). A college student sample is particularly relevant 
as high prevalence rates have been reported for both misophonia (Wu 
et al., 2014 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ) and violent behaviors (Schwartz et al., 
2015 ). 
2.Method 
2.1. Participants and procedure 
Participants included college students (N 655) enrolled at a public 
southern university. Students were invited to participate in an online 
questionnaire examining stress for course credit. Upon providing con-
sent, participants completed a battery of questionnaires. Participants 
who endorsed sensitivity to at least one sound on the Misophonia 
Questionnaire (Wu et al., 2014 ) were included in the current study (n 
470 of 655 unselected participants). The final sample (N 470; Mage 
18.68; SD 1.44) were primarily female (74.0%) and White (82.8%), 
with the remainder of the sample identifying as Black/African American 
(14.5%), Hispanic/Latinx (3.0%), and Asian/Pacific Islander (2.3%). All 
procedures were approved by this university ’s Institutional Review Board. 
2.2. Measures 
The Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (Buss & Perry, 1992 ) is a 
29-item questionnaire measuring anger, hostility, verbal aggression, and 
physical aggression. Statements are rated on a five-point scale ranging 
from 1 (“extremely uncharacteristic of me”) to 5 (“extremely charac -
teristic of me”). Emotional and physiological preparation to express 
aggression are assessed by the Anger subscale (“I sometimes feel like a 
powder keg ready to explode ”). The Hostility subscale emphasizes 
cognitive components of anger, such as thoughts of ill will towards 
another (“I wonder why sometimes I feel so bitter about things ”). The 
tendency to engage in aggressive behaviors is evaluated by the verbal 
aggression (“I can’t help getting into arguments when people disagree 
with me”) and physical aggression (“There are people who pushed me so 
far that we came to blows ”) subscales. The Aggression Questionnaire has 
been corroborated with behavioral tasks of aggression in experimental 
laboratory studies (e.g., Chester, 2019 ; Saleem et al., 2017 ), and modest 
to strong evidence for construct validity has been demonstrated for all 
four subscales (Buss & Perry, 1992 ). Acceptable internal consistency for 
the subscale and total scores has been established in undergraduate 
samples (Clements et al., 2018 ; Tremblay & Ewart, 2005 ). Internal 
consistency coefficients in the current study were acceptable (Anger α 
0.83, Hostility α 0.91, Verbal Aggression α 0.84, Physical Aggres -
sion α 0.79). 
The Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3; Taylor et al., 2007 ) is an 
18-item measure of anxiety about arousal-related sensations and their 
physical, social, and cognitive implications (e.g., “It scares me when my 
heart beats rapidly ”). Items are rated on a five-point scale, ranging from 
0 (“very little ”) to 4 (“very much ”). Items are summed to calculate a total 
score ranging from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating greater AS. The 
ASI-3 has demonstrated good internal consistency across subscales 
(Taylor et al., 2007 ; Wheaton et al., 2012 ). Cronbach ’s alpha in the 
current study was excellent (α 0.94). 
The Misophonia Questionnaire (Wu et al., 2014 ) is a three-part 
questionnaire that assesses sensitivity to certain sounds (e.g., people 
eating), emotional and behavioral reactions (e.g., anxious, distressed), 
and overall misophonia severity, respectively. This study used the total 
score, which is derived from the first two parts of the questionnaire. 
Items are rated on a scale from 0 ("not at all true") to 4 ("always true"), 
and summed to calculate the total score, which ranges from 0 to 68. The 
final section of the questionnaire evaluates the severity and impairment 
of misophonia symptoms on a scale from 1 ("minimal") to 15 ("very 
severe"), with a suggested clinical cutoff of 7 (Wu et al., 2014 ). In the 
current study, 0 was incidentally included as an option to indicate no 
sound sensitivity; thus, participants rated misophonia impairment on a 
0 to 15 scale. The Misophonia Questionnaire has demonstrated good 
internal consistency for the total score and subscales (Wu et al., 2014 ). 
Internal consistent in the current study was excellent (α 0.93). 
3.Results 
3.1. Preliminary analyses 
Data were initially screened and supported the testing of current 
models. Means, standard deviations, ranges, and bivariate correlations 
for the study variables are presented in Table 1. The results indicated 
that 24.1% of the sample was above the clinical cutoff for sensitivity to 
sound (M 5.26; SD 3.08) and 6.2% reported severe/very severe 
impact (≽10; Wu et al., 2014 ). As expected, the bivariate correlations 
revealed significant, positive associations between the variables (rs 
0.29 - 0.36). M.J. Schadegg et al.

33.2. Primary analyses 
PROCESS 3.2.01 (Hayes, 2018 ) model 1 for SPSS was used to test 
four moderation models to evaluate the interaction of misophonia 
severity (predictor variable) and AS level (moderator variable) in pre-
dicting facets of aggression (outcomes anger, hostility, verbal 
aggression, and physical aggression) while controlling for sex (0 Fe-
male, 1 Male). All variables were mean-centered for the analyses and 
then converted back to the original scale values for the plots. Significant 
interactions were probed using the Johnson-Neyman technique to 
identify points of significance and the pick-a-point technique was used 
to visualize the interaction at the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles 
(Hayes, 2018 ). 
Unstandardized conditional betas (B), standard error, F-test values, 
and p-values are reported in Table 2. The models evaluating anger, 
hostility, and verbal aggression revealed a similar pattern of results, 
whereas a different pattern of results emerged for physical aggression. 
The overall model was significant for anger (R2 0.19, p D.001), 
hostility (R2 0.14, p D.001), and verbal aggression (R2 0.23, p D
.001). In each of these models, male sex was a significant predictor and 
there were significant conditional effects of misophonia symptoms and 
AS on aggression propensity for these facets. The interaction term be-
tween misophonia and AS was a significant predictor of anger (ΔR2 
0.01, p .008), hostility (ΔR2 0.01, p .016), and verbal aggression 
(ΔR2 0.02, p D.001). That is, results supported the moderating role of 
AS in the relation between misophonia and each outcome (anger, hos-
tility, verbal aggression), wherein the effect strengthened as AS scores 
increased. The Johnson-Newman analysis indicated misophonia was a 
significant predictor of anger and verbal aggression at all levels of AS 
observed in this sample, indicating that AS consistently amplified the 
association between these variables. For hostility, misophonia was a 
significant predictor at scores of AS ≽0.77, indicating significance for approximately 92.1% of scores in this sample. The interaction estimates 
predicting aggression scores at the 16th (3.00), 50th (12.00), and 84th 
percentiles (32.00) of AS are depicted in Fig. 1. 
With regard to physical aggression, the overall model was significant 
(R2 0.19, p D.001). Significant conditional effects of male sex, 
misophonia, and AS on physical aggression were observed; however, the 
interaction term was not significant (ΔR2 0.00, p .102). 
4.Discussion 
The current study investigated AS and aggression to further under -
stand processes contributing to the experience and expression of miso-
phonia. As hypothesized, misophonia symptoms were found to be 
positively associated with AS and each of the four facets of aggression. 
These results are consistent with previous findings that have demon -
strated increased AS in misophonia samples (McKay et al., 2018 ) and 
positive associations of misophonia with aggressive behaviors (Wu et al., 
2014 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ) and AS (Cusack et al., 2018 ; McKay et al., 
2018 ). 
Consistent with hypothesis, AS moderated the association between 
misophonia and three of the dimensions of aggression – anger, hostility, 
and verbal aggression. In addition, significant conditional effects were 
observed, wherein male sex, greater misophonia symptoms, and higher 
levels of AS contributed to increases in aggressive tendencies. Specif -
ically, the association between misophonia and each of these aggression 
facets strengthened as levels of AS increased, and this interactive effect 
accounted for 1.2% unique variance in anger, 1.1% unique variance in 
hostility, and 2.0% unique variance in verbal aggression. For an indi-
vidual with misophonia, this suggests that AS may amplify the experi -
ence of and reaction to aversive sounds and increase the likelihood that 
they may engage in these forms of aggression. These results highlight AS 
a relevant cognitive-emotional process in misophonia, which extends 
the characterization of misophonia and informs future studies investi -
gating key psychological mechanisms in misophonia. Furthermore, as 
individuals with misophonia commonly describe anger and aggressive 
reactions as uncontrollable and impulsive (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Rouw 
& Erfanian, 2018 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ), results suggest that targeting 
AS may help ameliorate these and other adverse outcomes associated 
with misophonia. 
Unexpectedly, while physical aggression was predicted by the con-
ditional effects of male sex, misophonia, and AS, findings did not support 
AS as a factor contributing to physical aggression by magnifying miso-
phonia reactivity. Although anger and aggressive urges are frequently 
endorsed in misophonia, the incidence of physical aggression appears to 
be less common among adults with misophonia (Jager et al., 2020 ; 
Schroder et al., 2013 ). Consequently, the occurrence of these behaviors 
may be explained by other factors. To further understand these behav -
iors, future work is needed to explicate various forms of aggressive re-
sponses to misophonia cues (e.g., relational aggression; 
proactive/reactive aggression) and explore additional factors that may 
modulate physical aggression in response to misophonia triggers, such 
as gender, context, or irrational beliefs (Archer, 2004 ; Burton et al., 
2007 ; Eagly & Steffen, 1986 ; Fives et al., 2011 ). Table 1

4Given the few number of studies investigating rates and psycholog -
ical correlates of misophonia, the secondary findings contribute to 
knowledge on misophonia in a college sample. Of the initial sample of 
unselected undergraduate students (N 655), over 70% of individuals 
endorsed some degree of sound intolerance. Consistent with previous 
studies, approximately 24% of participants reported clinical levels of 
misophonia symptoms and 6% reported severe impact (Wu et al., 2014 ; 
Zhou et al., 2017 ). These results illustrate the prevalence and continuum 
of misophonia symptoms. In addition, levels of AS (Chowdhury et al., 
2016 ; Wheaton et al., 2012 ), as well as anger, hostility, verbal aggres -
sion, and physical aggression (Buss & Perry, 1992 ; D’Zurilla et al., 2003 ; 
Mathes et al., 2018 ) were comparable with previous studies investi -
gating these factors among undergraduate and community samples, 
which supports the generalizability of these results to other nonclinical 
populations. 
Several limitations should be noted and addressed in future research. 
First, the generalizability of the results is limited by the predominantly 
White, female sample of undergraduate students. Second, the cross- 
sectional study design precludes causal determinations. Third, aggres -
sive responses may have been underreported due to social desirability 
response biases (Tourangeau & Yan, 2007 ). Accordingly, a critical next 
step is the use of experimental designs to explicate the role of AS on 
aggressive responses to misophonia sounds. If supported, such findings 
have the potential to inform investigations aimed at improving out-
comes for individuals with misophonia. For instance, the potential 
utility of brief AS reduction interventions is supported by research 
demonstrating the positive impact of reducing AS on improving out-
comes for related conditions, such obsessive-compulsive spectrum 
symptoms (Timpano et al., 2016 ) and tinnitus (Andersson et al., 2005 ); 
however, it is unclear if similar effects would be expected for aggression. Accordingly, interventions focused on increasing distress tolerance 
warrant consideration (e.g., dialectical behavior therapy; Frazier & 
Vela, 2014 ). Controlled case studies and clinical feasibility trials are 
needed to evaluate the efficacy of such techniques among those with 
clinical misophonia.
