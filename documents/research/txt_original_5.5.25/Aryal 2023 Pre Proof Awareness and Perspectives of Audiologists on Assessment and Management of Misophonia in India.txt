- assessment and management of misophonia. 8

## Purpose 9

- The main aim of our study is to document the present level of awareness and knowledge about
- 10 misophonia assessment and management among audiologists in India. 11

## Methods 12

- A  descriptive  cross-sectional  study  was  carried  out  among  audiologists  from  all  over  India. 13
- Descriptive statistical procedures were measured based on the type of questions being addressed, 14
- and a non-parametric chi-square test was done to see the association among variables. 15

## Results 16

- The results show a lack of knowledge about misophonia even among audiologists, as only 15.3% 17

## INTRODUCTION 25

The recent consensus definition has explained misophonia as a disorder that is characterized by 26 decreased tolerance to specific sound stimuli (Swedo et al., 2022). These specific sound stimuli 27 are known as a trigger that causes various emotional and physiological responses, including an 28 accelerated  heart  rate,  sweating,  anxiety,  rage,  irritability,  and  disgust.  This  disorder  is  poorly 29 understood and less explored in the medical field. However, disorders can significantly impair an 30 individual's quality of life. In the field of psychology, it is regarded as a psychiatric disorder and 31 treated accordingly. Schröder et al. ( 2013) gave the diagnostic criteria stating misophonia as a 32 psychiatric disorder. However, misophonia is a disorder that borders audiology, psychiatry, and 33 the neurology field (Schröder et al., 2013). 34

Within the last two decades, there has been growing interest in the field of misophonia in 35 developing diagnostic criteria (Brout et al., 2018). Researchers have explained the disorder using 36 psychiatric criteria (Schröder et al., 2013). Misophonia can occur with neurological and psychiatric 37 disorders, but it is not limited to mood disorders, anxiety disorders, sensory processing disorders 38 (SPD), and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). In audiology, misophonia is categorized with other 39 sound disorders, including tinnitus, hyperacusis, and phonophobia. 40 Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of acoustic stimulation, which is mainly 41 associated with hearing loss. On the other hand, hyperacusis is the increased sensitivity to the 42 sounds, which results in pain or the sufferers feeling uncomfortable and related to the intensity. 43 Phonophobia has been defined as the fear of sounds used by patients expressing fear of certain 44 sounds due to abnormal limbic and autonomic nervous system activation. However, misophonia 45 is distinct from these disorders, although there is some overlap in symptoms, and an individual 46 may present with more than one condition ( Jastreboff., 2001; Swedo et al., 2022). Szczepek et al. 47 Journal Pre-proof

- (2022) have also reported that misophonia can occur with and without an average hearing threshold 48 and  alone  or  with  other  auditory  conditions  such  as  tinnitus  and  hyperacusis.  Misophonia  is 49 relatively less explored in the field of audiology. 50

The exact pathophysiology of misophonia is not known yet. Various neurophysiological 51 studies  have  shown  hyperactivation  of  the  auditory  pathway  in  individuals  with  misophonia 52 (Kumar et al., 2017). Audiologists are professionals trained to deal with sound and related auditory 53 disorders. The various treatment approaches trialed in the literature for managing misophonia, such 54 as  Tinnitus  retraining  therapy  (TRT)  and  Cognitive  Behavioral  Therapy  (CBT),  fall  in  the 55

audiology domain. Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff ( 2002) reported that tinnitus-retraining therapy should 56 work better with misophonia patients than with tinnitus patients because misophonia involves an 57 external  trigger,  which  can  be  manipulated  to  potentially  eliminate  the  conditioned  response. 58 Reclassifying the trigger sounds and extensive counseling are recommended for individuals with 59 misophonia.  Jastreboff  (  2015)  reported  the  effectiveness  of  tinnitus  retraining  therapy  in 60 misophonia patients with and without hyperacusis. 61

Besides  tinnitus  retraining  therapy,  Cognitive-Relaxation  Coping  Skills  Training  and 62 Multicomponent Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) have also been used to treat misophonia 63 (McGuire  et  al.,  2015)  successfully.  Few  case  reports  have  been  published  showing  CBT's 64 effectiveness  for  clients  with  misophonia.  In  the  study  by  Schröder  et  al.  (2017),  48%  of  the 65 participants improved after the eight sessions of CBT on the Clinical global improvement scale. 66 Similarly, Bernstein et al. (2013) reported improved social and occupational functioning after the 67 six sessions of CBT in patients with misophonia. 68

The  assessment  and  management  of  misophonia  need  a  team  approach,  including  a 69 Neurologist,  Audiologist,  Psychologist,  and  Occupational  therapists.  Audiologists  are  vital 70 members of the team. However, the role of an audiologist in this condition is not well understood, 71 and there is a lack of awareness even among professionals about their role in the assessment and 72 management of misophonia. The information regarding epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, 73 and co-morbid conditions of misophonia remains unknown, especially in developing countries like 74 India. 75 Journal Pre-proof

Misophonia is not studied from an audiological perspective, and most professionals are 76 unaware of this disorder. In developing countries like India, most audiologists do not consider 77 misophonia as an auditory disorder, and they should conduct separate assessment and management 78 protocols for individuals with misophonia. The assessment and management protocols that the 79 audiologist uses for tinnitus and hyperacusis may not work for misophonia as the 80 pathophysiological mechanism behind the disorder is different. Hence, there is an immense need 81 to create awareness about misophonia assessment and management  among  audiologists 82 worldwide, especially in developing countries like India. 83

The primary aim of our study is to study the status of misophonia assessment and 84 management in various hearing healthcare set up in India. In addition, our study also documents 85

- the present level of awareness about the assessment and management of misophonia among 86 audiologists in India which can further be used to spread awareness about misophonia among 87 professionals as well as among the general public. In India, no such investigation has been 88 conducted till now. This will be the first study of its kind. It will be instrumental in creating 89 awareness among professionals regarding the role of audiologists in misophonia and motivating 90 professionals to develop assessment and management protocols for helping individuals with 91 misophonia disorder. 92

## METHODS 93

## Ethical Guidelines 94

- Ethical guidelines formulated by the institutional review board were followed for the study. The 95 ethical  approval  number  was  SH/ERB/2022-22/36.  Informed  consent  was  taken  from  all  the 96 participants in the form of a question in the google form. 97

98

## Participants 99

- A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among audiologists all over India over three 100 months, from April 2022 to July 2022. A questionnaire designed for the study was distributed to 101 the 500 working audiologist in different hearing care set up via online survey modes such as Gmail, 102

103

whats' app, and LinkedIn. Among the 500 audiologists, 190 from different geographic areas of

- India responded to the survey. 104

## Inclusive and Exclusive Criteria 105

Journal Pre-proof

- All  the  audiologists  working  in  the  hearing  care  setup  having  the  minimum  qualification  of 106

107

Bachelor  in  Speech-language  pathology  and  Audiology  (BASLP)  with  RCI  registration  are

- included  in  the  survey.  Professionals  with  BASLP  degrees  but  working  as  speech-language 108
- pathologists, professionals working as hearing specialists with a diploma degree, and all speech109
- language pathologists have been excluded from the survey. There was no age limit for responding 110
- to the survey. The participants who were not Indian citizens were excluded from the study. All the 111
- participants were well educated with good English language competency to respond to the survey. 112

## Design of the Questionnaires 113

- A  survey  questionnaire  was  prepared  in  Google  regarding  the  awareness  of  assessment  and 114 management of misophonia. The authors formulated 23 closed-set and open-set questions in the 115 English  language  based  on  their  experience  regarding  the  assessment  and  management  of 116 misophonia  and  the  basis  of  a  literature  review.  Out  of  23  questions,  eight  were  related  to 117 demographic details, qualifications, and experience in audiology. Similarly, ten questions were 118 related to awareness and the audiologist's perspectives on the assessment of misophonia, and five 119 were related to perspectives regarding misophonia management. 120
- The questionnaires were given to five audiologists for validation. The construct validity was done 121

by using a five-point rating scale. For each question, five correspond to the most worthy questions, 122 and one corresponds to the least worthy questions. All the 23 questions included in the survey were 123 rated as 4 or 5 on the Likert scale and considered for the study. 124 Among 23 questions, 21 were closed set with the multiple choice option. In contrast, two were 125 open-set questions where audiologists had to answer their perspectives and ideas on the assessment 126 and management of misophonia (provided as supplementary material). 127 Procedure 128 The contact details, including the email address and phone numbers of all the working audiologists, 129 were taken from the concerned institute and the Indian speech and hearing association (ISHA) 130 dictionary. The questionnaires were mailed to the 500 working audiologists in different geographic 131 areas  of  India.  Among  500  emails,  we  got  a  response  from  118  audiologists.  The  telephonic 132 interview  was  done  for  the  audiologists  who  did  not  respond  to  the  emails.  Seventy-two 133 audiologists responded to our phone call and answered the questions. Overall, 190 audiologists 134 responded to our survey. All the data collection procedure was done after taking informed consent 135 from the professionals. 136 Journal Pre-proof

## Statistical Analysis 137

- The response to the questionnaires was tracked in the spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel 2010. The 138
- investigator  analyzed  the  response  to  the  questionnaire  and  converted  it  into  numerical  form. 139
- Obtained data  were  analyzed  using  a  statistical  package  of  social  science  (SPSS  Version  25.) 140
- software.  Descriptive  statistical  procedures  such  as  frequency  and  percentages  were  measured 141
- based on the type of questions being addressed. As the data were descriptive and did not follow 142
- neurological disorder. 16 (8.42%) of audiologists reported they were not sure about the domain of 170
- misophonia.  The  rest  of  the  audiologists  categorize  Misophonia  into  two  or  three  domains: 171
- auditory, psychiatry, and neurology. The details of the audiological perspectives on the misophonia 172
- complex are illustrated in Table 1 . 173
- Similarly, audiologists were asked about the etiology of the misophonia. Many of the audiologists, 174
- 47 (24.74%), answered that the etiology of misophonia could be neurophysiological, 39 (20.52%) 175
- reported it as psychological, and 5(2.63%) as anatomical. 14 (7.37%) of audiologists reported they 176
- were unaware of the misophonia's etiology. The rest of the audiologists reported multiple etiology 177

| 154   | included in the study worked in audiology with a minimum experience of 2 years and a maximum Pre-proof     |
| 155   | of 15 years (Mean= 7year, SD= 6 years). Most participants, 102 (53.68%), reported working as an            |

| 159   | Among 190 audiologists, who responded to the survey, 175 (92.10%) reported they are aware of               |
| 160   | the terminology, 7(3.68%) reported they are not clear about the term misophonia, and 8 (4.21%)             |
| 161   | reported they are not even aware of the terminology. Even though many audiologists reported that           |
| 162   | they are aware of the terminology, only a few audiologists, 29(15.3%), reported being confident            |
| 163   | in handling cases with misophonia using audiological approaches. The detailed awareness of                 |
| 164   | misophonia is illustrated in figure 1.                                                                     |

## 178 179 Insert table 1 here 180 Audiologist Perspectives on assessment of misophonia 181 Audiologists were asked about the number of cases of misophonia they get in their work facility. 182 Out of 190 audiologists, only 25 (13.15%) reported cases of misophonia in their workplace, with 183 an enrollment of 10-50 cases per year. The other 165 (86.84%) reported no cases of misophonia at 184 their  workplace.  The  questions  were  asked  regarding  their  perspectives  on  the  diagnosis  of 185 misophonia from tinnitus and hyperacusis. Most of the audiologist, 129(67.89%), reported that 186 diagnostic  protocols  for  misophonia  differs  from  other  sound  disorders  such  as  tinnitus  and 187 hyperacusis, 45 (23.7%) reported they are not sure about the diagnostic protocols of misophonia, 188 and  16(8.5%)  reported  that  diagnostic  protocols  of  misophonia  are  similar  as  tinnitus  and 189 hyperacusis. 190 Journal Pre-proof

misophonia  were  asked.  Most  of  the  audiologists,  56  (29.47%),  answered  that  a  combined audiological  and  psychological  protocol  would  best  assess  misophonia  rather  than  a  single

diagnostic protocol. The detailed response of all the audiologists regarding the best diagnostic

2. To learn about the audiologist's viewpoint on the

196

assessment of misophonia, an open-ended question was asked about the audiological test batteries

- that can be used to assess misophonia from the audiological perspective. Among 190 audiologists, 197

118  (62.1%)  audiologists  responded  to  that  open-ended  question.  Most  of  the  audiologists 198 suggested  test batteries approach  would  be  suitable  for  assessing  misophonia,  and  they 199 recommended  more  than  one  test  for  the  assessment  procedure.  Pure  tone  audiometry  and 200 Uncomfortable loudness level (UCL) tests are the two significant tests suggested by 70(59.32%) 201 of the audiologists. The response of all the audiologists regarding the use of test batteries for the 202 assessment of misophonia is illustrated in Table 2. 203

## Insert table 2 here

204

Questions were asked regarding the professionals managing misophonia at their work facility. 212 More than half of the audiologists, 96 (50.53%), mentioned that audiologists, psychologists, and 213 Neurologists are the primary team members in managing misophonia at their workplace. Besides 214 these  team  members,  a  few  audiologists  mentioned  that  ENT  specialists  and  occupational 215 therapists  are  also  involved  in  the  management  program.  The  detailed  response  from  all  the 216 audiologists is shown in Table 3. 217

## Audiologist Perspectives on the management of misophonia 205 The audiologist perspectives on the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach in managing 206 misophonia  were  assessed,  and  most  audiologists  182  (95.79%)  reported  the  need  for  a  team 207 approach to managing misophonia . Most participants, 103 (54.21%), reported that misophonia 208 management differs from tinnitus and hyperacusis. However, 63(33.16%) audiologists reported 209 they were not sure about the management of misophonia, and 24 (12.63%) audiologists reported 210 no differences in the management protocol of misophonia from tinnitus and hyperacusis. 211 Journal Pre-proof

Audiologists' perspectives on misophonia management were assessed by asking an open218 ended question about the approaches that can be used to manage misophonia from the audiological 219 domain.  Among  190  audiologists,  118  (62.1%)  audiologists  responded  to  that  open-ended 220 question.  Most  audiologists  suggested  trials  with  multiple  approaches  would  be  suitable  for 221 managing misophonia as the efficacy  of  approaches  varies  from  individual  to  individual.  The 222 majority of the audiologists suggested cognitive behavioral therapy (79.66%), tinnitus retraining 223 therapy (70.33%), desensitization therapy (60.16%), and counseling (60.16%) to be the effective 224

approaches  that  could  help  in  the  management  of  misophonia.  The  detail  of  the  management 225 approaches is illustrated in Table 3. 226

## Need for Research on misophonia 228

Audiologists' viewpoint on the need for Research on misophonia was assessed on a three229 point rating scale. The result showed that 162(85.26%) of the audiologist agreed on the fact that 230 there is a lack of Research on misophonia from the audiological perspective, and 13(6.8%) of the 231 audiologist rated neutral about the lack of Research, which would suggest they are not aware of 232 the Research done on the misophonia, and 15 (7.89%) of the audiologist disagree for the lack of 233 Research on the misophonia from the audiological perspectives. 234

Association between education qualification and misophonia case handling skills 235 The chi-square test assessed the association between the highest education qualification 236 and confidence in handling misophonia cases. Test results showed that education qualification 237 significantly impacts confidence in handling cases with misophonia. The audiologists with a higher 238 degree of qualification in audiology, i.e., Post-graduation and Ph.D., reported the ability to handle 239 cases with misophonia than the audiologists with undergraduate degree X 2 (4, N =190) = 0.002 ( p 240 &lt;0 .05). The result of the chi-square test is illustrated in table 4. 241 Insert table 4 here Journal Pre-proof

## DISCUSSION 243

Misophonia is the most commonly occurring disorder with a high prevalence rate (Zhou et 244 al., 2017). Although the accurate assessment and management of misophonia is still the topic of 245 debate, it is clear that audiologists are the team's key members, and it falls in the audiology domain. 246

247

Wu et al. (2014) conducted a study involving a sample of 483 US college students using an online

248

249

250

questionnaire, which revealed a prevalence of misophonia at 19.9%. Similarly, a recent study by

Naylor  et  al.  (2021)  reported  clinically  significant  misophonia  in  49.1%  of  the  study  sample population  among  the  U.K.  undergraduate  medical  student  population.  These  data  showed

Prevalence of misophonia is increasing with time. However, in our study, 86.84% of audiologists 251 reported no cases of misophonia at their workplace. This result showed that audiologists are not 252 considered team members in the assessment and management of misophonia in India, and there is 253 a lack of referrals to audiologists'. Hence, it is essential to create awareness about the roles of an 254 audiologist in the assessment and management of misophonia among professionals as well for the 255 better intervention of patients with misophonia from all possible perspectives. 256

Our study aimed to study the present level of awareness about misophonia among working 257 audiologists all over India. The study by Porcaro &amp; Danesh. (2019) reported a lack of awareness 258 about misophonia disorder among academics. Similar to their findings, our study also showed a 259 lack  of  awareness  and  confidence  in  the  assessment  and  management  of  misophonia  among 260 audiologists in India. Misophonia is a disorder that can occur in isolation or association with other 261 sound disorders, such as tinnitus and hyperacusis ( Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff., 2002). It is necessary 262 to differentiate misophonia from tinnitus and hyperacusis, as this is a separate entity with different 263 neurophysiological mechanisms behind them. With time, awareness about hyperacusis and tinnitus 264 is increasing among audiologists, and many cases are diagnosed and treated appropriately in the 265 audiology  clinic.  However,  misophonia  is  lagging,  and  audiologists  have  made  no  effort  to 266 understand this disorder and the inclusion of the disorder in the audiology domain. 267 Journal Pre-proof

One possible reason for this problem could be the lack of misophonia education in India's 268 undergraduate and post-graduation syllabus. Tinnitus and hyperacusis are included as separate 269 disorders in the syllabus of masters of audiology, but misophonia/phonophobia are not included. 270 Hence, it is essential to include misophonia education in the education syllabus of the universities 271 to  educate  the  students  about  misophonia  in  detail,  which  could  help  to  expand  the  field  of 272 audiology. 273

Misophonia is a challenging topic to study and a challenging disorder to diagnose and treat. 274 The exact etiology and neurophysiological mechanism behind it have not been proven yet. The 275 result of our study showed that 34.74% of audiologists included in the study believed that the 276 misophonia's etiology could be either neurophysiological or psychological. However, no studies 277 are reported in the literature from the audiological perspective to know about the physiological 278 mechanism of misophonia using audiological test batteries. The lack of Research on misophonia 279

from the audiological perspective could either be due to the lack of knowledge about misophonia among audiologists or the lack of misophonia cases getting referred to audiology clinics.

Patients  with  misophonia  are  unaware  of  the  professionals  involved  in  diagnosing  and managing their condition as there is a lack of awareness among the general public, especially in developing countries like India. Therefore, it is the professionals' role to make appropriate referrals to the concerned professionals. Hence, it is essential to spread knowledge about misophonia among the general public and professionals so that the patient with it would get appropriate treatment from the concerned professionals.

The  result  of  the  audiologist's  perspectives  regarding  the  management  of  misophonia 299 showed that most audiologists believed that audiological approaches such as cognitive behavioral 300 therapy, retraining therapy, desensitization therapy, and counseling could help manage 301 misophonia. However, very few experimental studies are done in the literature to know the efficacy 302 of these treatment approaches. Few case reports have been published showing CBT's effectiveness 303 for clients with misophonia. In the study by Eijsker et al. (2017), 48% of the participants improved 304 after the eight sessions of CBT on the Clinical global improvement scale. Similarly, Jastreboff &amp; 305 Jastreboff ( 2002) reported that retraining therapy should work better with misophonia patients 306 than  with  tinnitus  patients  because  misophonia  involves  an  external  trigger,  which  can  be 307 manipulated to potentially eliminate the conditioned response. Hence, it is the role of audiologists 308

The assessment and management of misophonia are not known yet. Especially from the 288 audiological domain, much less work has been done to assess and manage misophonia. The result 289 of our study showed that most audiologists believed the tests batteries approach, including pure 290 tone  audiometry,  UCL  testing,  and  electrophysiological  tests,  would  be  appropriate  for  the 291 assessment of misophonia. In the patients with misophonia, Jastreboff (2013)  reported. Loudness 292 discomfort level (LDL) may be average or at a reduced level. Similarly,  Jager et al.(2020) have 293 reported that misophonia can occur with and without an average hearing threshold through the 294 administration of pure tone audiometry (PTA) in a few subjects with misophonia. However, there 295 are no  studies  done  in  the  literature  using  test  batteries,  including  both  behavioral  and 296 electrophysiological measures. Hence, these data showed a need to conduct a study on misophonia 297 using the test batteries from the audiology domain to come to the effective conclusion. 298 Journal Pre-proof

|   313 | Our study concludes that many audiologists are unaware of their role in the assessment and                  |
|   314 | management of misophonia all over India. Audiologists need to be aware of their role in patients            |
|   315 | with misophonia, and they should be active members of the team to understand misophonia from                |
|   316 | different perspectives. Team-based diagnosis and management protocol, including an audiologist              |
|   317 | as the team member, is very much necessary for assessing and treating an individual with                    |
|   318 | misophonia. Hence, it is necessary to spread awareness among team members for the appropriate               |
|   319 | referral to the concerned professionals as per the need of the patients. Treatment should be                |
|   320 | individualized depending on the co-morbid condition and its severity. Depending on the severity,            |
|   321 | associated conditions, and the client's need, the team members' role needs should be highlighted. Pre-proof |
|   322 | Hence, we strongly highlight that audiologist needs to be an active team member to assess and               |
|   323 | manage misophonia, which is lacking in the current scenario. There is also a need to spread                 |
|   324 | awareness about the role of audiologists among the general public and the team members. Our                 |
|   325 | study could not assess team members' perspectives, such as psychologists and neurologists,                  |
|   326 | regarding the role of audiologists in the assessment and management of misophonia. This type of Journal     |
|   327 | study is necessary to conduct in the future to know about their viewpoint on the audiologist's              |
|   328 | role, which could help to create awareness among the professionals about the role of audiologists           |
|   329 | in misophonia.                                                                                              |
