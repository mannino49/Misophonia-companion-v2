Objective: To scope the literature describing misophonia
populations, management, and research opportunities.
Method: Literature searches for research studies describing
patients diagnosed with misophonia, defining a patientprofile, or outlining development or testing of an interven-
tion for misophonia. A data extraction form was developed
and piloted before data from each article were indepen-
dently charted by two researchers. Researchers then agreed
on a final data set for each article.Results: Thirty ‐one records were included. The misophonia
population was described in terms of onset age, triggers,
reaction, coping strategies, and comorbid conditions. We
identified nine outcome measure s. Case studies on treatments
included cognitive behavioral therapy, counterconditioning,mindfulness and acceptance, dialectical behavioral therapy,
and pharmaceuticals. Future research priorities identified
included clarifying the phenomenology and prevalence of
misophonia, and randomized controlled trials of treatments.
Conclusion: Misophonia is under ‐researched but there are
strong foundations for future research to finalize diagnostic
criteria, validate outcome measures, and trial treatments.

1|INTRODUCTION
Misophonia, literally meaning hatred of sound, was fir st referred to in research literature in 2002 to describe
a consistent set of symptoms and has since been increasingly encountered by clinicians (Bernstein, Angell, &Dehle, 2013; M. M. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2002, 2003; Kumar et al., 2017; McFerran, 2016). The initial
J. Clin. Psychol . 2019;75:1203 –1218. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/jclp © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. |1203

definition of misophonia was “an abnormally strong reaction occurr i n gt oas o u n dw i t has p e c i f i cp a t t e r n
and/or meaning to an individual ”(P. J. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014). Typically, patients suffer a strong
negative emotional and autonomic “fight or flight ”reaction triggered by specific sound stimuli termed
“trigger sounds ”(Edelstein, Brang, Rouw, & Ramachandran, 2013; P. J. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2013;
Schröder, Vulink & Denys 2013; Wu, Lewin, Murphy, & Storch, 2014). Although variations exist, most
commonly the patient experiences a disproportionate l evel of hate, anger, rage, an d disgust toward a person
producing sounds associated with eating (e.g., chewing and swallowing) or breathing (Edelstein et al., 2013).
The symptoms usually occur irrespective of sound spe ctrum and intensity and are exacerbated within a
familiar context (Edelstein et al., 2013). An important exception is self ‐produced similar sounds, which have
the same spectrum and intensity but do not usually evoke these abnormal reactions. Disturbed by theinappropriateness of his or her reaction, the patient engages in maladaptive coping mechanisms such as
avoiding social situations in which the trigger sounds might occur. Ultimately, this results in an interpersonal
and occupational impairment, anxiety, and obsessive c ompulsions. Patients with severe misophonia suffer
from the intrusive and unwanted preoccupation with trigger ‐stimuli, as well as compulsive stress ‐reducing
and avoidance behaviors (Cavanna & Seri, 2015; Webbe r & Storch, 2015), which are t ypically seen in patients
with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD; Bruxner, 2016). Moreover, th ese reactions are, in some cases,
equally evoked by repetitive visual person ‐related triggers (e.g., leg ‐rocking or watching somebody chew)
termed misokinesia, suggesting the disorder expands beyond merely audiological symptoms, and confirming
a strong likeness to OCD and Tourette syndrome. Oth er less frequent comorbid conditions include mood
disorder, panic disorder, attention deficit hyperactivi ty disorder, hypochondria, trichotillomania, and skin
picking (Ferreira, Harrison, & Fontenelle, 2013; Haze n et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2013; McGuire, Wu, &
Storch, 2015; Schröder, Vulink et al., 2013; Taylor, C onelea, McKay, Crowe, & Abramowitz, 2014; Taylor
et al., 2014; Webber, Johnson, & Storch, 2014).
Misophonia has no official diagnostic formulation with in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM ‐V) or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
Problems 10th revision (ICD ‐10; Kumar et al., 2017). Considering the parallels to OCD, it has been proposed
that misophonia can be categorized within the obse ssive compulsive spectrum of disorders in the DSM ‐V
(Schröder, Vulink, et al. 2013). In contrast, as it borde rs both psychiatry and audiology, misophonia is also
considered to be categorizable with disorders in audiolog y, including tinnitus (percep tion of constant internally
perceived abstract sounds), hyperac usis (discomfort/pain experience d due to everyday sounds of a normal or
louder intensity), phonophobia (extreme fear toward spec ific trigger sounds). Misophonia is distinct from these
disorders although there is some overlap in symptom s and an individual may present with more than one
condition (Fackrell et al., 2017; Jastreboff, 2000; Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2003; Schwartz, Leyendecker, &
Conlon, 2011).
Currently, little is known about the etiology of misophonia (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014). Propositions of the
psychiatric nature of misophonia (Ferreira et al., 2013) are found on the basis that it is not an auditory disorder
caused by neurological dysfunction. This is evidenced as misophonia patients typically have normal hearing
thresholds (Schröder, Vulink, et al., 2013). Instead, misophonia is associated with an increased number of
connections, or strength of connections, between the limbic and sympathetic nervous systems, which can cause
abnormal processing of sound stimuli (Møller, 2011; Jastreboff & Hazell, 2008; Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2013). Case
studies also suggest a hereditary component in misophonia (Cavanna, 2014).
Treatments for misophonia include tinnitus retraining therapy and sound therapy (Formby, Sherlock, & Gold,
2003, Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2013) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; Bernstein et al., 2013; McGuire et al.,
2015; Reid, Guzick, Gernand, & Olsen, 2016; Schröder, Vulink, van Loon, & Denys, 2017). Other less documented
cognitive treatments for misophonia include counterconditioning (Dozier, 2015a), applied relaxation (Martz, 2013),
and the intake of serotonergic or antidopaminergic agents, which have been shown to have some efficacy for
misophonia when it is within an OCD diagnosis (Neal & Cavanna, 2013; Eddy & Cavanna 2013).1204 |POTGIETER ET AL.

1.1 |Rationale for the review
The research literature has noted a steady increase in the number of misophonia cases over the last decade
(Hadjipavlou, Baer, Lau, & Howard, 2008; Schwartz et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2014). Consequently, there has also been
a rise in the number of relevant research studies (Duddy & Oeding, 2014), gradually compiling an evidence base for
this new and independent condition. A point has now been reached where the literature on misophonia needs to becataloged purposefully to provide an account of the current research position and guide future research priorities.
This review on misophonia is the first to apply a scoping review methodology to the subject.
1.2 |Aims
This scoping review aimed to collate the research evidence to date on the definition, patient profile, assessment,and treatment of misophonia, such that research gaps and opportunities could be identified. Specifically, our
objectives relate to (a) how misophonia and the populations it affects are described in research literature, (b) what
research has been conducted to date on the assessment and treatment of misophonia, and (c) in both cases, what
are priority research questions.
2|METHODS
This review is reported according to the PRISMA checklist extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA ‐ScR; Tricco
et al., 2018). No protocol for the review was published. A methodological framework for scoping reviews was
followed (Arksey & O ’Malley, 2005, Levac, Colquhoun, & O ’Brien, 2010; Khalil et al., 2016; Peters et al., 2015)
involving six stages, whereby (1) the purpose and research questions were defined, (2) relevant studies were
identified using a three ‐step literature search to balance the breadth and 0comprehensiveness, (3) studies were
selected using an iterative team approach to study selection and data extraction, (4) the data were charted
incorporating qualitative thematic analysis where necessary, (5) the results were collated, summarized, and
reported, including the implications for policy, practice or research, and (6) the findings were reviewed by clinical
experts in the field who did not take part in Stages 1 –5.
2.1 |Eligibility criteria
Records were included if they (a) reported research studies (including studies of etiology, symptomatology/patient
profiles, prevalence, incidence, cohort, and case ‐control studies) and focused on describing the population of
patients diagnosed with misophonia, or (b) reported case studies, case series, cohort, feasibility, or pilot studies
where the purpose was to define a patient profile or outline or develop an intervention for patients with a primary
complaint of misophonia, or (c) reported randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non ‐RCT, case or cohort studies or
case series where the effectiveness of an intervention for misophonia was tested and misophonia was the primary
complaint or part of a symptom set.
Records were excluded if they were not peer ‐reviewed, were reviews (our searches confirm there are no
previous related scoping or systematic reviews), that were personal/expert opinions and editorials, manuals or
guidelines, patents, not available in English, or were reporting animal studies.
2.2 |Information sources and search strategy
Initial searches were conducted in July 2016. Searches were conducted in Embase, PsychINFO, PubMed CENTRAL,Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, Cochrane Ear Nose, and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register,POTGIETER ET AL. |1205

Clinical Trials.gov, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number registry (ISRCTN), the
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature
(CINAHL PLUS) and Google Scholar. We applied a specific search term strategy in each search engine (Table 1),
searching in article topics, titles, abstracts, and keywords. Where possible, filters were applied to retrieve articles in
the English language and with human participants only. There was no restriction in the search period. Table of
contents of the most common journals (determined using the interquartile rule for outliers) and the reference lists
of any relevant review articles identified throughout the process, which had misophonia in the title were also
screened. Searches were last updated in June 2018.
2.3 |Study selection
Using an iterative approach, all abstracts were assessed independently by two researchers as meeting the reviewcriteria or not. Records were first screened by title and abstract and in the next stage by full text. There were nodisagreements between authors regarding the inclusion or exclusion of a record for this review.
2.4 |Data extraction
A data extraction form was created in Excel and was piloted by two reviewers on two records before finalizing.Data were then extracted independently by two reviewers (I. P. and D. J. H.) according to the following items: First
Author; Year of Publication; Title of study; Publication Type; Publication type: other; Country study aim;
Misophonia definition; Study design; Methods; If combination methods we specified; Sample size; percentage of
participants with misophonia; Study population; Setting; Age; Gender; Misophonia primary or secondary complaint;
Age at onset; Trigger sounds; Response to the trigger sounds; Aggressive reaction use menu; Coping mechanisms;
Other comorbidities; Assessment time points; Eligibility screening methods; Assessments/Outcome measures;
Treatment aimed primarily at misophonia; Nature of therapeutic intervention (components); Main outcomes of
study —empirical; Main outcomes of study —anecdotal; Study limitations; Further research; Notes. Disagreement on
the extracted data was minimal and generally related to omissions rather than errors. Where these occurred bothauthors revisited the record to agree on a final data set. The final datasets were then charted by topic according toTABLE 1 Search term strategies for misophonia outcome measures and interventions

the aims of the review, namely the definition, patient profile, assessment (diagnosis and measurement), and
treatment of misophonia. We, additionally, cataloged research priorities nominated in the literature.
3|RESULTS
Figure 1 displays the flow of records identified, screened, included, or excluded, with reasons for exclusion. Thirty ‐
one records were included in this review; 17 were case studies or case series, six were nonrandomized controlledtrials, two were online surveys, and six were cohort studies. The earliest study was published in 2008 and one ‐third
of them were published in 2017. Fourteen studies were conducted in the United States, eight in the Netherlands,
two in Australia, two in the UK, two in Brazil, one in China, one in Turkey, and one in Canada. Six studies included
children (aged under 18 years old) only, 17 studies included adults only, and six studies had a mixed population.
Two studies could not be classified according to age as only mean sample ages were reported. Further study details
are available in Supporting Information Materials 1 and 2.
3.1 |Definitions of misophonia
Common terminology was observed in most definitions of misophonia used in the literature. Most commonly it wasdescribed as a disproportionately extreme, aversive, and irrational emotional reaction (Bernstein et al., 2013;
Boyce, 2015; Colucci, 2015; Dozier 2015a, 2015b; Edelstein et al., 2013; Erfanian, Brout, & Keshavarz, 2017;
Kumar et al., 2014, 2017; McKay, Kim, Mancusi, Storch, & Spankovich, 2017; Rouw & Erfanian, 2017; Sanchez & da
Silva, 2017; Schneider & Arch, 2017; Tunç & Ba şbuğ, 2017; Vidal, Vidal, & Lage, 2017; Webber et al., 2014) to
specific (Boyce, 2015, Colucci, 2015, Edelstein et al., 2013, Giorgi, 2015; McKay et al., 2017; Reid et al., 2016; Rouw
& Erfanian, 2017; Sanchez & da Silva, 2017; Schneider & Arch, 2017; Schröder et al., 2017; Tunç & Ba şbuğ, 2017;
Vidal et al., 2017; Webber et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014), common human innocuous sounds (Dozier 2015b, 2015c;
Johnson et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2017; Schröder, Mahazeri, et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2017; Schröder, San
Giorgi, Van Wingen, Vulink, & Denys, 2015; Schneider & Arch, 2017), and sometimes animal sounds (Schneider &
Arch, 2017). Some authors described in detail the eliciting stimuli of this reaction. Two authors mentioned in their
FIGURE 1 Flow chart of record selectionPOTGIETER ET AL. |1207

definitions the term “trigger sounds ”(Dozier, 2015a; Webber et al., 2014) and some explained what these were
exactly: breathing, wheezing, chewing, eating, slurping, lip smacking, pen clicking/tapping, typing, or cracking
knuckles (Kumar et al., 2017; McKay et al., 2017; Sanchez & da Silva, 2017; Schneider & Arch, 2017;
Schröder, Mahazeri, et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2014, 2015, 2017). Two authors (Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Wu
et al., 2014) described misophonia as a condition of decreased sound tolerance, and six authors mentioned selective
sound sensitivity syndrome (4S) as a synonym of misophonia (Kluckow, Telfer, & Abraham, 2014; McGuire et al.,
2015; Sanchez & da Silva, 2017; Webber et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014; Zhou, Wu, & Storch, 2017). The literal
meaning of misophonia, hatred of sound, was used in the definition provided by some authors (Edelstein et al.,
2013; Giorgi, 2015; Kumar et al., 2014; Schröder, Vulink, et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014).
Most authors described emotional reactivity commonly experienced by patients, as part of their working
definition. It is reported that emotional reactions “range or escalate ”(Dozier, 2015a) from discomfort (Wu et al.,
2014), anxiety, distress (Johnson et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014) to irritation, disgust, hate, anger, and loss of self ‐
control (Boyce, 2015; Colucci, 2015; Dozier 2015a, 2015b, 2015c; Giorgi, 2015; Kumar et al., 2014, 2017; Reid
et al., 2016; Schröder, Mahazeri, et al., 2013, Schröder et al., 2015, 2017; Webber et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014).
Some authors also referred to aggressive outbursts as a central hallmark of the condition (Kluckow et al., 2014;
McGuire et al., 2015; Schröder, Mahazeri, et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2014; Tunç & Ba şbuğ, 2017; Webber et al.,
2014). In addition to an emotional reaction, some authors referred to physiological or autonomic arousal (in terms
of a trigger) in their definitions of misophonia (Bernstein et al., 2013; Edelstein et al., 2013; Vidal et al., 2017). Some
definitions also noted the presence of coping mechanisms, typically avoidance strategies (Kumar et al., 2014;
McGuire et al., 2015; McKay et al., 2017; Schröder et al., 2015; Webber et al., 2014).
3.2 |The misophonia population
3.2.1 |Onset
Almost all studies that reported onset age of misophonia found that symptoms emerged in childhood (Dozier
2015a, 2015b, 2015c; Johnson et al., 2013) or adolescence (i.e., up to 18 years of age; Bernstein et al., 2013;
Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2013; Kamody & Del Conte, 2017; Kluckow et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2014;
McGuire et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2016; Schneider & Arch, 2017; Schröder, Vulink, et al., 2013). Two studies
reported that the onset was in adulthood (i.e., 18 years and over; Boyce, 2015; Tunç & Ba şbuğ, 2017) and two
studies reported an onset age that can spread over the lifespan (Sanchez & da Silva, 2017; Zhou et al., 2017).
3.2.2 |Triggers and context
Person ‐related sounds reported to trigger misophonic responses included oral sounds, especially those made by
people eating, such as chewing, lip smacking, swallowing noises, and throat noises (Bernstein et al., 2013; Boyce,
2015; Colucci, 2015; Dozier, 2015a, 2015b, 2015c; Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2013; Kamody & Del
Conte, 2017; Kumar et al., 2014, 2017; Reid et al., 2016; Sanchez & da Silva, 2017; Schneider & Arch, 2017;
Schröder, Vulink, et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2014, 2015, 2017; Tunç & Ba şbuğ, 2017; Vidal et al., 2017; Wu et al.,
2014; Zhou et al., 2017), nasal sounds, such as breathing, blowing nose, sniffling, coughing (Dozier, 2015a, 2015c;
Johnson et al., 2013; Kamody & Del Conte, 2017; Kumar et al., 2017; Sanchez & da Silva, 2017; Schröder, Vulink,
et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2014; 2015; Wu et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017), and in single cases, nail picking
(Hadjipavlou et al., 2008), or sneezing (Dozier, 2015c). Specific spoken sounds, such as /s/, /t/, /ch/, /k/ (Colucci,
2015; Wu et al., 2014), or consonants and/or vowels (Zhou et al., 2017) and specific voices (Boyce, 2015;
Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Webber et al., 2014) were also reported as triggers. The context in which the triggers are
experienced also appears important. Authors observed that triggers experienced within a familiar context, that is, a
family, friends, and occupational, or educational setting were more likely to cause a stronger misophonia reaction1208 |POTGIETER ET AL.

(Bernstein et al., 2013; Boyce, 2015; Dozier, 2015a, 2015b, 2015c; Edelstein et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2013;
Kluckow et al., 2014; McGuire et al., 2015; Schneider & Arch, 2017).
Other common trigger sounds include repetitive clicking and tapping (Colucci, 2015; Johnson et al., 2013;
McGuire et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2016; Schröder et al., 2014; Vidal et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017),
or sounds produced by using utensils, keys, or ice in a glass (Dozier 2015b, 2015c; Johnson et al., 2013; Sanchez &
da Silva, 2017). Individual cases also describe bird chirps (Dozier, 2015b; Johnson et al., 2013), dog barking
(Kluckow et al., 2014; Sanchez & da Silva, 2017), rustling (Sanchez & da Silva, 2017; Schröder et al., 2014; Zhou
et al., 2017), and conversations in Spanish in a Hispanic individual who spoke both Spanish and English, as triggers
(McGuire et al., 2015).
In some cases (Dozier 2015a, 2015b; Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Schröder et al., 2014; Vidal et al., 2017), triggers
included person ‐related visual stimuli accompanying the auditory stimuli, such as swinging arms or legs, jiggling, or
rubbing hands together, which can fall under the term misokinesia.
3.2.3 |The misophonic reaction
All authors describe the misophonic reactions of their participants as various combinations of discomfort, distress,
anxiety, annoyance, disgust, panic, extreme irritation, anger, hate, or sometimes rage with aggressive outbursts or
involuntary violence (Bernstein et al., 2013; Colucci, 2015; Dozier, 2015a, 2015b, 2015c; Edelstein et al., 2013;
Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2013; Kamody & Del Conte, 2017; Kluckow et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2014,
2017; McGuire et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2016; Rouw & Erfanian, 2017; Sanchez & da Silva, 2017; Schneider & Arch,
2017; Schröder, Vulink, et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2017; Tunç & Ba şbuğ, 2017; Vidal et al., 2017; Webber et al.,
2014). A larger qualitative study based on 42 people with misophonia (Schröder, Vulink, et al., 2013) reported that
physical aggression was present as a reaction in five of them. A physical reaction to trigger sounds appeared
common and included contraction, tension, or sensation in specific muscles (Bernstein et al., 2013; Dozier, 2015a,2015b, 2015c; Kamody & Del Conte, 2017; Kluckow et al., 2014); and/or heavy breathing (Kluckow et al., 2014;
McGuire et al., 2015). Edelstein et al. (2013) stated that the most common reaction reported in their sample was
pressure experienced in the chest, arms or head, muscle tension, or a “fight or flight ”reaction (i.e., an autonomic
stress response). One single case was noted to experience intrusive images of mouths and urges to mimic this
(Hadjipavlou et al., 2008); another described feelings of shame and remorse (Bernstein et al., 2013).
3.2.4 |Coping strategies
Patients managed their symptoms through avoidance behavior, for example, leaving the situation, wearing
earphones, or avoiding situations where the trigger might occur, including quitting work (Boyce, 2015; Colucci,
2015; Dozier, 2015a, 2015b, 2015c; Edelstein et al., 2013; Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2013; Kamody &
Del Conte, 2017; Kluckow et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2014; McGuire et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2016; Schneider & Arch,
2017; Schröder, Vulink, et al., 2013; Webber et al., 2014). Other strategies included confrontation, that is,
demanding the offender (e.g., family member) to stop producing the trigger sound (Dozier 2015a, 2015b; Edelsteinet al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2013; Kluckow et al., 2014; Reid et al., 2016; Sanchez & da Silva, 2017; Webber et al.,
2014), also mimicking the offensive sound (Edelstein et al., 2013; Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Schröder, Vulink, et al.,
2013), engaging in a positive internal dialogue (Edelstein et al., 2013, Kluckow et al., 2014; Reid et al., 2016), or
distracting themselves from the sound (Kluckow et al., 2014) by producing antisounds (Schröder, Vulink, et al.,
2013) or diverting their thoughts (Schröder et al., 2017). Two single cases reportedly managed their symptoms
using muscle relaxation exercises (Dozier, 2015b). One case restrained herself from aggressive verbal outbursts by
keeping her mouth full of food at meal times (Kluckow et al., 2014).POTGIETER ET AL. |1209

3.2.5 |Comorbid conditions
Misophonia was noted to be comorbid with OCD (Erfani an et al., 2017; Johnson et al ., 2013; Kluckow et al.,
2014; Reid et al., 2016; Schröder, Vulink, et al., 2013, 2017; Webber et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014), depression
(Dozier, 2015a; Johnson et al ., 2013; Reid et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2014; Schröder et al ., 2017; Erfanian et al.,
2017), attention deficit hyperactiv ity disorder (ADHD; Reid et al., 2016 ; Schröder, Vulink, et al., 2013;
Schröder et al., 2014), asthma (Dozier 2015a, 2015b; Kluckow et al., 2014), Tourette Syndrome (Schröder,
Vulink, et al., 2013, Schröder et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2014 ), dysthymic disorder (Erfanian et al., 2017; Schröder
et al., 2017), eating disorders (Kluckow et al., 2014; Sc hröder et al., 2017), postt raumatic stress disorder
(PTSD; Dozier, 2015b; Erfanian et al., 2017), social phobia (Erfanian et al., 2017; Hadj ipavlou et al., 2008), body
dysmorphic disorder (Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Schröder et al., 2017), and panic disor der (Erfanian et al., 2017;
Hadjipavlou et al., 2008).
Individual cases were also reported that had borderline personality dis order (Boyce, 2015), tinnitus and
hearing loss (Colucci, 2015), specific phobia (Reid et al., 2016), agoraphobia (Erfanian et al., 2017), generalized
anxiety disorder (Dozier, 2015c), Kawasaki disease ( Johnson et al., 2013), hypoc hondria (Schröder, Vulink,
et al., 2013), skin picking (Schröder, Vulink, et al., 2013 , Schröder et al., 2017), and bipolar disorder (Schröder
et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2017). It is important to note that although these various conditions were present
alongside misophonia there is no evidence, as yet, to suggest any association. A future study should examine
the prevalence of these comorbid cond itions to evaluate which, if any, are in fact more prevalent in people with
misophonia.
3.2.6 |Neurobiological findings
Six records included neurobiological data from patients with misophonia. Edelstein et al. (2013) and Kumar et al.
(2017) measured skin conductance during exposure to a range of trigger sounds in people with misophonia and
healthy controls. They found that those with misophonia assign higher aversion, distress, and annoyance ratings,
and have higher skin conductance or galvanic skin responses to auditory but not visual stimuli.
Giorgi (2015) used fMRI to explore brain areas involved in the misophonia reaction. They found hyperactivation
in the bilateral auditory cortex and the left amygdala in patients with misophonia when exposed to misophoniatriggers but not when the stimuli were neutral. Another fMRI experiment by Schröder et al. (2015) also found
increased activity in the auditory cortex and the left amygdala. Schröder, Mahazeri, et al. (2013) measured the
mismatch negativity response —an objective test of automatic central auditory processing, finding it to be reduced
in patients with misophonia compared with controls outside of any audiological distortions. The most recent work
in this area (Kumar et al., 2017) suggests that misophonia is directly associated with an abnormal function of the
anterior insular cortex (AIC) and a network of regions responsible for processing and regulation of emotions,
including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posteromedial cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Kumar et al.
(2017) also found that triggers elicited heightened heart rate and galvanic skin response in misophonia subjects,
which were mediated by AIC activity. Questionnaire data indicated that patients with misophonia had higher
interoceptive sensibility than controls, consistent with abnormal functioning of anterior insular cortex. Brain
structural measurements implied greater myelination within ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in misophonicindividuals.
Schröder et al. (2014) used EEG and an oddball paradigm to measure differences in auditory event ‐related
potentials (ERPs) evoked by pure tones, between patients with misophonia and control participants. They found
that the mean amplitude of the auditory N1, a marker linked to early attention and detection of abrupt sensory
changes, was significantly diminished in patients with misophonia. Notably, their patient group exhibited a higher
total mood disturbance score than the controls, which the authors suggest may reflect a general state of
hyperarousal in patients ’emotional state.1210 |POTGIETER ET AL.

3.3 |Prevalence
Two studies provide some prevalence data on misophonia. Wu et al. (2014) reported that in their sample of 483
undergraduate students 20% were classed as having clinically significant misophonia symptoms that cause
interference in their lives. Another study with a sample size of 415 also suggested a prevalence rate of 20% of
“often ”or“always ”experiencing sound sensitivity to triggers. However, this rate dropped to 6% for significantly
interfering misophonia symptoms (Zhou et al., 2017). Kluckow et al. (2014) reported that in a sample of 15 patients
with eating disorders three also had misophonia, as determined from the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A ‐Miso ‐S;
Schröder, Vulink, et al., 2013) and the Misophonia Activation Scale (MAS ‐1; Fitzmaurice, 2010).
3.4 |Diagnosis and measurement
Most studies used an unstructured clinical interview to assess misophonia (Bernstein et al., 2013, Boyce, 2015,
Dozier, 2015b, Edelstein et al., 2013, Hadjipavlou et al., 2008, Reid et al., 2016; Kamody & Del Conte, 2017; Giorgi,
2015; Johnson et al., 2013; Kluckow et al., 2014; Sanchez & da Silva, 2017; Schneider & Arch, 2017; Schröder,
Vulink, et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2017; Vidal et al., 2017; Webber et al., 2014). Three studies specified use of the
structured clinical interview for DSM IV Axis I or Axis II to diagnose patients with misophonia (Bernstein et al.,
2013; Schröder, Vulink, et al., 2013; Tunç & Ba şbuğ, 2017), and one used the M.I.N.I. International Neuropsychiatric
Interview for the diagnosis of affective disorders (Erfanian et al., 2017).
Different questionnaire measures of misophonia sever ity were used across studies. The most commonly
used was the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale ( A‐Miso ‐S; Giorgi, 2015; Kamody & Del Conte, 2017; Kluckow et al.,
2014; Reid et al., 2016; Rouw & Erfanian, 2017; Schneider & Arch, 2017; Schröder, Vulink, et al., 2013;
Schröder et al., 2014, 2015, 2017; Tunç & Ba şbuğ, 2017), which is based on the Yale Brown Obsessive
Compulsive Scale (Y ‐BOCS). Dozier (2015a, 2015b) used the Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire ( MAQ )a n d
the Misophonia Coping Responses Survey ( MCR ), which, anecdotally, were both proposed by audiologist
Marsha Johnson, although no information is available to v erify this, or how the questionnaires were developed.
Dozier (2015b, 2015c) used the Mis ophonia Trigger Severity Scale ( MTS) by Natan Bauman (no reference
identified). Kluckow et al. (2014) and Dozier ( 2015b) used the Misophonia Activation Scale ( MAS ‐1;
Fitzmaurice, 2010). The Misophonia Physiological Scale ( MPS) was used by Dozier (2015c) and developed by
Natan Bauman (no reference identified).
The most recently published questionnaires are the Misophonia Emotional Response ( MER; Dozier et al., 2015b,
2015c) and the Misophonia Questionnaire ( MQ; Wu et al., 2014; also used in Dozier, 2015b; McGuire et al., 2015;
McKay et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017). The Misophonia Severity Scale ( MSS), a subscale of the MQ, was adapted
from the NIMH Global Obsessive ‐Compulsive Scale ( NIMH GOCS ; Murphy, Pickar, & Alterman, 1982). The MSS was
used in two other studies (Dozier, 2015b; McGuire et al., 2015). None of the available questionnaires have yet been
subjected to formal psychometric evaluation.
3.5 |Treatment approaches for misophonia
Twelve studies explored treatments for misophonia. Three studies investigated a CBT method (Bernstein et al.,2013; McGuire et al., 2015; Schröder et al., 2017). In one study, a CBT subtype called Exposure and Response
Prevention (ERP) was documented for a patient with a primary complaint of OCD (Reid et al., 2016). Three studies
investigated counterconditioning treatment (Dozier et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2015c). One study used mindfulness and
acceptance to treat misophonia (Schneider & Arch, 2017) and one used dialectical behavior therapy (DBT; Kamody
& Del Conte, 2017). One study (Hadjipavlou et al., 2008) documented two cases treated with a combination ofexposure therapy, relaxation, and medication. Three studies (McGuire et al., 2015; Tunç & Ba şbuğ, 2017; Vidal
et al., 2017) reported the results of using medication alone to treat misophonia.POTGIETER ET AL. |1211

Bernstein et al. (2013) described a case where CBT treatment comprised of challenging dysfunctional automatic
thoughts, and a behavioral component to interrupt and subst itute maladaptive and avoidant coping strategies with
helpful ones. These included redirecting attention and talking openly with people producing the triggers in a
nonoffensive manner. There was also a physiological component involving exercise before meals to recalibrate
autonomic reactivity. At the end of treatment, the case still found chewing noises unpleasant, but the triggers no longer
impaired her social or occupational functioning and this effect was maintained at a 4 ‐month follow ‐up assessment.
In McGuire et al. (2015), CBT included psychoeducation and achieving “habituation ”through a combination of
exposure and cognitive restructuring. More specifically, the two cases were exposed to triggers titrated upward in
frequency and intensity to habituate them to the distress caused by the triggers. The process was then switched
from the therapist to family members. To restructure dysfunctional beliefs about the triggers, the cognitiverestructuring was practiced during the exposures. Relapse prevention strategies were also introduced toward the
end of treatment. Both cases showed improvement in misophonia symptoms based on their scores on the MQ and
MSS and anecdotal patient reports.
Schröder et al. (2017) tested an adaptation of group CBT on 9 0 patients. Components included task concentration
exercises to train patients to shift their attention to neutral stimuli during exposures; counterconditioning was also used
to break the association patients had between trigger sounds an d experiencing negative emotions. Stimulus manipulation
was the third component of this therapy. Patients were taug ht how to assume a sense of control over their responses by
manipulating the trigger sounds they exposed themselves to on a computer at home as part of homework. Relaxation
exercises were also included to help patients manage fee ling of anger and rage, on the assumption that misophonia
patients ’irritability is related to increased general arousal. Thi s version of therapy significantly reduced misophonia
symptoms in nearly half of the patients and was found use ful, especially for more severe cases of misophonia.
Reid et al. (2016) investigated a single patient who had misophonia and comorbid OCD, depression, and specific
phobia. In this case, only two of the 14 sessions of CBT exposure relapse prevention (CBT ERP) treatment were
aimed at managing the misophonia problem. CBT ERP involved working with the patient through imaginal and in ‐
vivo exposures to the stimulus. The structure of the two sessions for misophonia was not specified in the record so
it is unclear whether these two sessions used ERP to treat the misophonia symptoms, or whether it was standard
CBT. The two misophonia sessions occurred in the middle of treatment for OCD. The patient also completed two
related homework sessions. At the end of treatment, this patient ’s misophonia reduced from severe to mild/
subclinical based on her A ‐Miso ‐S score, and this improvement was maintained at 3 ‐month follow ‐up.
Schneider and Arch (2017) applied mindfulness and a cceptance methods to treat misophonia in one case.
Components were derived from acceptance and commitment t herapy; ACT (acceptance, mindfulness, diffusion, and
values) and DBT (acceptance, mindfulness, “nonjudgmentalness, ”and opposite action) perspectives, although several
techniques could also be conceptualized from a classic CBT pe rspective (e.g., identifying the link between thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors). Treatment consisted of 10 × 50 ‐min sessions. Specific techniques included diffusion exercises
(being aware of one ’s thoughts to create distance between the patient and the thoughts rendering them less
overwhelming); DBT ‐style chain analyses to compare situations eliciting stronger and weaker reactions. A component of
removing judgment was also included where the patient practi ced noticing his judgmental thoughts and redescribing the
situation objectively (just the facts). This method was effective 2 months later, and 6 months posttreatment, whereby
the patient ’s scores across all measures, including the A ‐Miso ‐Sa n dY ‐BOCS, continued to decrease. The patient was
better able to accept and tolerate the discomfort triggered by his misophonia.
DBT was used in one case (Kamody & Del Conte, 2017) suffering comorbid anxiety and misophonia. DBT
sessions were weekly for 7 weeks. The essence of the treatment was to acquire DBT skills of mindfulness and
distress tolerance; to understand one ’s ability to transact differently with the environment despite his/her
predisposition to anger, find alternative strategies to dealing with anger and guilt, and reduce behavioral
engagement in behavioral urges. During treatment, the patient was also given paroxetine hydrochloride (an SSRI) of
25 mg (no frequency given) to simultaneously manage misophonic and anxiety symptoms. The authors reported a
symptom reduction from severe to mild based on the A
‐Miso ‐S.1212 |POTGIETER ET AL.

“Exposure therapy ”was investigated in two cases (Hadjipavlou et al., 2008). The authors did not give
information as to what the “exposure therapy ”constituted, or whether it was part of CBT. This kind of therapy had
limited effects in both cases due to noncompliance and perceived lack of benefit. The authors reported that
alongside “exposure therapy ”the two cases also received medication and relaxation treatment —although it is
unclear if it was simultaneous. In the first case, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine; dose not
specified) combined with relaxation techniques provided symptomatic relief. In the other case (a 25 ‐year ‐old
woman with multiple morbidities), antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, stimulants, and mood stabilizers
were all ineffective, as were sound generators. McGuire et al. (2015) reported that a regimen of venlafaxine
(150 mg/day; a serotonin ‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) and lisdexamfetamine (70 mg/day; a central nervous
system stimulant) led to moderate improvement in misophonia symptoms. However, the case had still sufferedsignificant functional impairment and subsequently received CBT treatment.
Counterconditioning is a treatment, which involves the pairing of a powerful positive stimulus with a
conditioned trigger stimulus causing the conditioned reflex to cease or die out. This method was specifically
adapted to treat misophonia and was tested in three studies (Dozier 2015a, 2015b, 2015c). It involves multiple
treatment sessions in which a low intensity, short duration trigger stimulus was intermittently provided during a
continuous positive stimulus such as music. Patients were encouraged to practice muscle relaxation during the
treatments and to complete homework sessions using appropriate devises. Two studies testing this methodology
were case studies, and one was a case series. Anecdotal patient reports suggest some improvement in patient
symptoms; no empirical data were provided.
Two studies used medication alone to treat misophonia. Vidal et al. (2017) report on a single case of misophonia
and obsessional symptoms treated with escitalopram (SSRI; no dose detail was given). Evaluation after 30 daysshowed partial relief from misophonia symptoms. In Tunç and Ba şbuğ(2017) a case was treated with alprazolam
(a benzodiazepine; 0.5 mg/day) for 3 days to which the patient had responded well although misophonia persisted.
3.6 |Research priorities nominated in the literature
Suggestions for future research on misophonia in the literature included the need to confirm the phenomenology
and prevalence of misophonia (Hadjipavlou et al., 2008), and its genetic and neurological mechanisms (Dozier,
2015a; Edelstein et al., 2013; Giorgi, 2015; Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; McKay et al., 2017; Schröder et al., 2014; Tunç
&B a şbuğ, 2017; Webber et al., 2014). Edelstein et al. (2013) also suggests investigating the natural history of
misophonia and the evolution of triggers over time. There are also suggestions for further research into hereditary
factors in misophonia (Rouw & Erfanian, 2017; Sanchez & da Silva, 2017) and its comorbidities (Erfanian et al.,
2017). There appears to be a consensus that conducting RCTs of the available treatments for misophonia is urgent
(Dozier 2015b, 2015c; Edelstein et al., 2013; Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Kamody & Del Conte, 2017; Reid et al., 2016;
Schneider & Arch, 2017; Schröder et al., 2017). Dozier (2015b) proposed that a set of validated assessment
instruments for misophonia should be established. The effectiveness of CBT and how it links with brain responseswere specifically suggested (Giorgi, 2015; McGuire et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2016). Finally, investigating misophonia
within certain populations (i.e., pediatric, autism spectrum disorder, eating disorders, and tinnitus) to garner a
better clinical picture of misophonia, and to clarify its association with tinnitus, was mentioned by a number of
authors (Kluckow et al., 2014; McGuire et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017).
4|DISCUSSION
This scoping review catalogs the research describing misophonia, its population, methods of assessment,treatments, and future research priorities. Inherent to scoping review methodology, we included all the relevant
and available research studies on misophonia treatments. We found that most studies used methodologies thatPOTGIETER ET AL. |1213

provide low ‐level evidence, with over half of the current research on misophonia taking the form of case studies.
This finding highlights the need for controlled studies and clinical trials on misophonia.
Misophonia is a condition only described as such in the last two decades and no official diagnostic criteria have
yet been formulated. Although Schröder, Vulink, et al. (2013) proposed a set of diagnostic criteria, this has not been
formalized. We scoped the available definitions of misophonia used by researchers and found a high level of
common terms and statements. Still, some definitions were broad and did not seem to differentiate misophonia
from hyperacusis. The collation of definitions presented here can be used in finding consensus on a single definition
and description of misophonia. It also serves as a starting point to consider the validity of existing or new
misophonia measurement questionnaires. These measures will, in turn, allow more rigorous diagnostic profiling and
evaluation of available treatments for misophonia.
Descriptions of the misophonia population consistently identified that its onset is in childhood or early
adolescence at 12 or 13 years. There can also be individual cases where misophonia begins in childhood or middle ‐
age. As reported in a previous review (Bruxner, 2016), the triggers of the misophonia symptoms are almost always
produced by humans and most commonly involve oral and nasal sounds, with the level of familiarity of the context
within which the triggers are experienced playing a significant role. Over the course of their condition, some
patients can develop intolerance to certain visual stimuli that accompany the audible ones, such as movement of
mouths, and these can become triggers on their own. A few studies also report that repetitive noises, such as
clicking and tapping can also trigger misophonia symptoms. This suggests a possible continuum between
misophonia and misokinesia (hatred of movement; Schröder, Vulink, et al., 2013). Misokinesia is not currently
known to exist as a discrete condition but is rather a less common misophonia symptom.
Evidence on the prevalence of misophonia is only available from two student populations. Authors report a rate
of 20% of people “often ”or“always ”experiencing sensitivity to triggers with 6% experiencing impairment. This
could mean that while many may experience sound sensitivity to some triggers, a relatively low percentage suffer.
Few studies have been dedicated, so far, to studying the neurological correlates of misophonia. Of those
conducted, most used MRI or EEG and skin conductance. The findings are all considered preliminary but
consistently suggest that misophonia involves abnormal functioning of the amygdala, an area of the brain
commonly associated with negative emotions, aversive learning, and processes of attention and vigilance (Davidson
& Irwin, 1999; Davis & Whalen, 2001; Holland & Gallagher, 1999). The most recent study reported here (Kumar
et al., 2017) provides further evidence that it is the AIC and its connection to the amygdala, and other regions
involved in emotion that are malfunctioning in patients with misophonia. Currently, it is still unclear whether theAIC malfunction is a cause or consequence of misophonia. The study found that patients also displayed a generally
heightened baseline emotional state or hyperarousal, though there was evidence too that they had a lowered
automatic central auditory processing mechanism. Further research is required to confirm these findings and how
they link to the etiology, progress, and maintenance of misophonia.
Some of the cases we reviewed could potentially be classed as being “extreme ”and not representative of the
typical misophonia population. However, the current evidence base on the symptomatology of misophonia cannot
differentiate these for certain. On the whole, we found that the misophonic reaction frequently reported in
research involves intense negative feelings, which can vary from anxiety, disgust, panic, discomfort, annoyance,
frustration, and rage, with the latter reported as a key characteristic (Dozier 2015a, 2015b, 2015c; Kumar et al.,
2014; Schröder et al., 2013b; Schröder et al., 2014). Patients may experience anxiety in anticipation of hearing the
trigger sounds, and then anger and disgust when they actually hear them. The literature we reviewed suggests thatthe dominant misophonia reaction involved intense negative feelings (Dozier 2015a, 2015b, 2015c; Kumar et al.,
2014; Schröder, Vulink, et al., 2013), but also anxiety or fear of being unable to control the intolerance (Edelstein
et al., 2013; Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Kumar et al., 2014). Research also showed that the misophonic reaction is
commonly associated with muscle tension in various body regions, symptoms related to anxiety (Ginsburg, Riddle, &
Davies, 2005; Sainsbury & Gibson, 1954), as well as abnormal physical stress (Rouw & Erfanian, 2017). In line with
this, Wu et al. (2014) and Zhou et al. (2017) found that it is indeed anxiety, which mediates the link between sound1214 |POTGIETER ET AL.

intolerance and anger outbursts. This idea is also supported by the model proposed by Webber and Storch (2015)
highlighting the central role of anxiety, which is negatively reinforced by behavioral responses and sheds light on
the treatment of misophonia. Therefore, it appears that although anger is the dominant misophonic reaction,
anxiety caused by the anger, affects the consequent behavioral responses, such as intrusive compulsions or safety
behaviors. These behavioral consequences may lead to interpersonal and occupational dysfunction (Cavanna, 2014;
Schwartz et al., 2011) causing decreased quality of life which, in turn, causes more anxiety. Further highlighting the
role of anxiety in misophonia, we found that the condition most commonly reported to be comorbid with
misophonia was the anxiety disorder OCD. Schröder, Vulink, et al. (2013) highlighted that both disorders share the
intrusive and unwanted preoccupation and compulsive stress ‐reducing and avoidance behaviors. For this reason, he
proposed that misophonia could be classified within the obsessive compulsive spectrum of disorders of the DSM IV.The parallels between misophonia and OCD also informed the development of the A ‐MISO ‐S and the MSS.
However, the psychometric properties of these two measures as well as other less commonly used outcome
measures for misophonia are yet to be established.
Evidence on effective treatments for misophonia is scarce. Less than half of the available studies on misophonia
focused on treatment, and all but one were case studies. Hence, in reviewing, one must be conscious of the
potential “file drawer effect, ”whereby only cases of effective treatment get published. The most researched type of
treatment for misophonia was CBT in various adaptations, whereby achieving habituation to the triggers through
in‐vivo exposures, was the common component among them. These proved effective in all studies, as did
counterconditioning (a type of behavioral treatment where controlled exposure to triggers to achieve habituation is
also central but lacks the cognitive counseling element of CBT). Although these positive findings are based on
anecdotal reports, there is a good foundation to conduct RCTs to ascertain the most effective format of CBTtreatment. Other cognitive treatments, such as mindfulness and acceptance and DBT also showed promising results
and warrant further research. Certain medication, such as fluoxetine, venlafaxine, lisdexamfetamine, paroxetine
hydrochloride, escitalopram, and alprazolam were used either in combination with cognitive therapy or alone.
Future research should compare and assess the exact effect of these drugs on misophonia. It is crucial to highlight
that although such medication has been tested with misophonia patients this does not amount to evidence of
effectiveness. RCTs are required to assess the safety dosages and whether or not they are effective. Currently, only
one clinical trial on the neural and self ‐reported effect of CBT has been identified as ongoing (ISRCTN:12571777).
4.1 |Limitations
First, although this is a review of misophonia research, the definitions of misophonia used in the included records
are varied and so the participants and patients described may not represent a homogenous population. Second,
although we undertook the optional Stage 6 (consultation) of scoping reviews (Levac, Colquhoun, & O ’Brien, 2010),
there is currently a lack of guidance on how this is best conducted. We chose to incorporate the clinicians ’
interpretations of the results from their experience within the discussion section. A more systematic process ofconducting and reporting the consultation stage could enhance the value of this stage of the scoping review
process.
5|CONCLUSION
Although no formal nosology of misophonia has yet been finalized, research to date shows consistency in terms of thecharacteristics of misophonia that are described. To date, there are no studies that provide a reliable estimate of the
prevalence of misophonia in the general population, nor in spe cific patient populations. Demographic data would inform
t h et r u es c a l eo ft h ed i s o r d e ra n db e t t e rd e f i n et h es c a l eo f need for health care. Nevertheless, research in misophonia
has progressed in the last decade, in that outcome measures of misophonia have been developed and some possiblePOTGIETER ET AL. |1215

treatments have been shown effective, in providing relie f in case studies. Authors in the field agree on the need for
studies that validate existing outcome measures, RCTs of tre atments, and studies to determine the etiology and natural
history of misophonia. The current evidence base on misophonia is not yet substantial enough to consider a systematic
review. However, we suggest that RCTs testing possible tre atments for misophonia is a vital next step for patients.
Epidemiological research and consensus ‐based research is necessary for demographic estimations and to ascertain
diagnostic criteria.
