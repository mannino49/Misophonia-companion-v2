Misophonia is a newly described disorder of sound tolerance characterized
by strong negative emotional reactions to speciﬁc "trigger" sounds, resulting
in signiﬁcant distress, pathological avoidance, and impairment in daily life.
Research on misophonia is still in its infancy, and most existing psychometric
tools for assessing misophonia symptoms have not been extensively validated.
The purpose of the current study was to introduce and psychometrically
validate the duke-vanderbilt Misophonia Screening Questionnaire (DVMSQ),
a novel self-report measure of misophonia symptoms that can be used
to determine misophonia "caseness" in clinical and research settings.
Employing large online samples of general population adults ( n= 1403)
and adults on the autism spectrum ( n= 936), we rigorously evaluated
the internal structure, reliability, validity, and measurement invariance of
the DVMSQ. Results indicated that 17 of the 20 original DVMSQ items
ﬁt well to a bifactor structure with one "general misophonia" factor and
four speciﬁc factors (anger/aggression, distress/avoidance, impairment, and
global impact). DVMSQ total and subscale scores were highly reliable
in both general population and autistic adult samples, and the measure
was found to be approximately invariant across age, sex, education level,
and autism status. DVMSQ total scores also correlated strongly with
another measure of misophonia symptoms (Duke Misophonia Questionnaire–
Symptom Scale), with correlations between these two measures being
signiﬁcantly stronger than correlations between the DVMSQ and scales
measuring other types of sound intolerance (Inventory of Hyperacusis
Symptoms [General Loudness subscale] and DSM-5 Severity Measure for

Speciﬁc Phobia [modiﬁed for phonophobia]). Additionally, DVMSQ items were
used to operationalize diagnostic criteria for misophonia derived from the
Revised Amsterdam Criteria, which were further updated to reﬂect a recent
consensus deﬁnition of misophonia (published after the development of the
DVMSQ). Using the new DVMSQ algorithm, 7.3% of general population adults
and 35.5% of autistic adults met criteria for clinically signiﬁcant misophonia.
Although additional work is needed to further investigate the psychometric
properties of the DVMSQ and validate its theory-based screening algorithm
using best-estimate clinical diagnoses, this novel measure represents a
potentially useful tool to screen for misophonia and quantify symptom
severity and impairment in both autistic adults and the general population.

Introduction
Misophonia is a newly described disorder of sound
tolerance in which individuals have strong negative emotional
responses to speciﬁc “trigger” sounds (e.g., chewing, tapping,
and sniﬄing), resulting in signiﬁcant distress, pathological
avoidance behavior, and impairment in daily life (Schröder
et al., 2013; Potgieter et al., 2019; Swedo et al., 2022). When
encountering a trigger sound or other non-auditory stimuli
associated with such sounds (e.g., the sight of an individual
eating), individuals with misophonia frequently experience
emotions such as anger, extreme irritation, disgust, or anxiety,
potentially combined with a “ﬁght or ﬂight” response and non-
speciﬁc physical symptoms such as muscle tension, increased
heart rate, or sweating (Edelstein et al., 2013; Rouw and
Erfanian, 2018; Jager et al., 2020; Swedo et al., 2022). Other
stimuli, such as purely visual triggers (e.g., a leg bouncing up
and down; Schröder et al., 2013; Jaswal et al., 2021) or simply
imagining a trigger sound (Ferrer-Torres and Giménez-Llort,
2021) may also be suﬃcient to trigger full-blown misophonic
reactions in some cases. Misophonia is distinct from other
forms of decreased sound tolerance such as hyperacusis (a
disorder in which sounds of moderate intensity are perceived
as excessively loud or physically painful) and phonophobia (a
speciﬁc phobia of certain sounds or sound sources), although
these diﬀerent conditions may co-occur in some individuals
(Fagelson and Baguley, 2018; Fackrell et al., 2019; Adams
et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2021c,d; Siepsiak et al., 2022).
A recent epidemiologic study using semi-structured clinical
interviews estimated the prevalence of clinically signiﬁcant
misophonia to be 12.8% among older adolescents and adults
in one urban area (Kılıç et al., 2021), additionally ﬁnding
misophonia status to be associated with female sex, younger
age, and multiple co-occurring psychiatric conditions. Notably,research on misophonia is in its infancy, and there is much still
to be learned about the phenomenology of this condition, its
underlying pathophysiology, and the most appropriate ways to
screen for, diagnose, and treat misophonia in clinical practice.
As misophonia has not been formally adopted as a
clinical diagnosis within existing frameworks such as the
International Statistical Classiﬁcation of Diseases and Related
Health Problems (ICD; World Health Organization, 2019) or
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM; American Psychiatric Association, 2022), there remains
a lack of consensus among stakeholders regarding the speciﬁc
criteria used to determine misophonia “caseness” (i.e., the status
of an individual having clinically signiﬁcant misophonia) within
research and clinical practice. Operational diagnostic criteria
have been proposed by multiple research groups (Schröder et al.,
2013; Dozier et al., 2017; Jager et al., 2020; Kılıç et al., 2021;
Guetta et al., 2022), but none of these criteria were endorsed
in a recent expert consensus deﬁnition of misophonia (Swedo
et al., 2021, 2022). Moreover, while the published consensus
deﬁnition of misophonia did deviate from existing sets of
diagnostic criteria such as the Revised Amsterdam Criteria
(Jager et al., 2020), the authors of the consensus statement
did not publish speciﬁc diagnostic criteria in line with their
deﬁnition. Therefore, in order for this foundational deﬁnition
to be applied in research and practice, additional work is
necessary to both (a) distil the consensus deﬁnition down to
a set of diagnostic criteria and (b) operationalize these new
misophonia criteria using standardized instruments such as
structured interviews or questionnaires.
The present study sought to build on the newly proposed
consensus deﬁnition of misophonia by providing an initial
draft of updated diagnostic criteria and speciﬁc ways in
which those criteria can be assessed using a published but
not yet validated assessment, the duke-vanderbilt Misophonia

Screening Questionnaire (DVMSQ; Williams et al., 2021a).
Additionally, this study provides the ﬁrst psychometric evidence
supporting the reliability, latent structure, and validity of the
DVMSQ as a measure of misophonia symptom severity and
impairment in both general-population adults and adults on
the autism spectrum, a population in which misophonia and
other forms of clinically signiﬁcant decreased sound tolerance
are prevalent (Williams et al., 2021c,e). Although a large
number of novel self-report questionnaires have recently been
proposed to measure misophonia severity (Schröder et al.,
2013; Wu et al., 2014; Jager et al., 2020; Siepsiak et al., 2020;
Dibb et al., 2021; Remmert et al., 2021; Rinaldi et al., 2021;
Rosenthal et al., 2021; Vitoratou et al., 2021), the DVMSQ
diﬀers from the majority of these measures in that it was
speciﬁcally designed to operationalize the diagnostic criteria for
misophonia as proposed by diﬀerent authors (Schröder et al.,
2013; Dozier et al., 2017; Jager et al., 2020). Further, unlike
other measures, which typically assign misophonia caseness on
the basis of theoretically or empirically based cutoﬀ scores,
the DVMSQ provides a criterion-based algorithm to determine
whether an individual reports all symptoms and suﬃcient
functional impairment to warrant being classiﬁed as having
clinically signiﬁcant misophonia. In the context of our proposed
operational diagnostic criteria, derived in accord with both the
Revised Amsterdam Criteria (Jager et al., 2020) and the recent
consensus deﬁnition of misophonia (Swedo et al., 2022), the
DVMSQ diagnostic algorithm represents the ﬁrst systematic
attempt to apply the misophonia consensus deﬁnition in
the context of a psychometric instrument. This measure’s
relative brevity, focus on theoretically “core” symptoms of
the misophonia construct, and broad characterization of
misophonia-related impairment suggest that the DVMSQ has
potential utility as a dimensional measure of misophonia
severity in both research and clinical practice.
Methods
Rationale and item pool development
The DVMSQ (Williams et al., 2021a) was created by the
ﬁrst author (ZJW) in collaboration with colleagues at the
Duke Center for Misophonia and Emotion Regulation (M.
Z. Rosenthal, C. Cassiello-Robbins, and D. Anand) during
the development of the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire
(DMQ; Rosenthal et al., 2021). While the 86-item DMQ was
designed to comprehensively assess many diﬀerent aspects of
the misophonia construct (e.g., triggers, symptoms, cognitions,
coping behaviors, beliefs, and impairment) in granular detail,
the measure was not designed to assess all proposed diagnostic
criteria or to discriminate between individuals with and without
misophonia. Thus, the DVMSQ was created as a relatively brief
complementary measure that (a) assessed diagnostic featuresproposed to be “core” to the misophonia construct and (b)
quantiﬁed impairment due to misophonia, both in terms of
interference with speciﬁc life domains and perceived global
impact on one’s life.
Items on the original DVMSQ ( Table 1 ) were adapted
from the Revised Amsterdam Criteria (Jager et al., 2020),
assessing the diagnostic features of (a) presence of speciﬁc
“trigger” sounds, (b) intense emotional reactions (extreme
irritation, anger, disgust), (c) acknowledgment that emotional
reactions are excessive, (d) loss of self-control, (e) avoidance
of triggers and/or endurance of triggers with distress, and (f)
associated impairment due to symptoms (social, occupational,
domestic, and community domains). An item about physical
symptoms in reaction to triggers was additionally included
to capture criterion B (i.e., the trigger stimulus elicits an
immediate physical reﬂex response) as proposed by Dozier
et al. (2017). Based on content areas represented in the
broader DMQ item pool (see Rosenthal et al., 2021 for more
details), items were also added to assess (a) fear or panic in
response to triggers, (b) attentional capture by trigger sounds,
and (c) perceived global impact (including negative eﬀects on
mental health). Notably, while speciﬁc eﬀorts were made during
the development of the DMQ to separate “double-barreled”
items, items of the DVMSQ were written to be more general,
often combining multiple related emotions or sensations into
single items for the sake of brevity and to reduce local item
dependence. All items were initially drafted by ZJW, and
wording was iteratively reﬁned until consensus was achieved.
As an important caveat, the development and ﬁnalization
of the DVMSQ occurred before the initial publication of
the misophonia consensus deﬁnition (Swedo et al., 2021),
and thus, not all aspects of the condition mentioned in
the consensus deﬁnition and proposed diagnostic criteria are
included in the DVMSQ. Nevertheless, as existing DVMSQ
items operationalize all but one of the proposed diagnostic
criteria (symptom duration 6 months), the measure represents
a reasonable approximation of the misophonia construct as
recently deﬁned.
Operational diagnostic criteria for
misophonia
In order to create operational diagnostic criteria that could
be assessed using the DVMSQ, we began with the Revised
Amsterdam Criteria (Jager et al., 2020), modifying each criterion
to align more closely with the recent misophonia consensus
deﬁnition (Swedo et al., 2021, 2022). The misophonia diagnostic
criteria used in the current study (see also Williams, 2022)
are presented in Table 2 , along with the operationalization
of each criterion by the DVMSQ items. Notable changes
from the Revised Amsterdam criteria include (a) the removal
of the requirement that an individual be triggered by oral
Frontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org

fpsyg-13-897901 July 16, 2022 Time: 21:21 # 4
Williams et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.897901
or nasal sounds, (b) the removal of the requirement that
individuals must acknowledge their emotional reactions to
triggers as excessive, unreasonable, or out of proportion to
the circumstances, (c) additional description of anxiety and/or
physical symptoms accompanying the emotional reactions
(though neither is required for diagnosis nor suﬃcient to fulﬁll
that criterion), (d) the use of speciﬁc coping strategies (e.g.,
ear protection, masking trigger sounds with white noise) is
described within the “avoidance” criterion, (e) the outbursts
resulting from a loss of control are described in more detail and
include manifestations other than aggression, and (f) emotional
reactions occurring in the context of other neuropsychiatric
conditions (e.g., autism, ADHD) can still count toward a
diagnosis of misophonia if the remaining criteria are met.
Additionally, to clarify the chronic nature of misophoniasymptoms, the newly proposed diagnostic criteria include a
duration criterion of 6 months or longer, on par with the
criteria used to diagnose most anxiety disorders (American
Psychiatric Association, 2022). Although these operational
criteria are designed to reﬂect the consensus deﬁnition of
misophonia more closely than the Revised Amsterdam criteria,
it is important to note that they were not themselves derived
from expert consensus or a similarly rigorous Delphi process
(Niederberger and Spranger, 2020). Thus, while our study does
represent the ﬁrst attempt to derive a diagnostic algorithm
that incorporates the misophonia consensus deﬁnition, the
speciﬁc criteria proposed should be treated as provisional and
superseded by more rigorously developed “consensus diagnostic
criteria” for misophonia as soon as such criteria are made
available.

Participants
The current study comprises a secondary data analysis
of two large survey studies that included the DVMSQ as
a part of longer survey batteries assessing multiple types
of decreased sound tolerance (i.e., hyperacusis, misophonia,
and phonophobia) as well as their clinical and demographic
correlates in adults. The primary sample analyzed in this
investigation is a large online general-population sample of
adults in the United States ( n= 1403) recruited from the
Proliﬁc crowdsourcing platform (Palan and Schitter, 2018;
Stanton et al., 2022). Additionally, in order to assess the
psychometric properties of the DVMSQ in autistic adults, we
examined data from a sample of independent autistic adults
(n= 936) from the Simons Foundation Powering Autism
Research for Knowledge (SPARK) cohort (Feliciano et al., 2018).
Notably, data from the SPARK sample were predominantly
included to assess the latent structure of the DVMSQ in the
autistic population and to examine diﬀerential item functioning
across diagnostic groups; thus, the majority of analyses inthe current study focus exclusively on the general population
(Proliﬁc) sample.
General population (Proliﬁc) sample
A sample of general population adults was recruited from
the Proliﬁc crowdsourcing platform (Palan and Schitter, 2018;
Stanton et al., 2022) in the fall of 2021. Eligibility criteria
included age 18 or older, living in the United States, speaking
English ﬂuently, having answered Proliﬁc demographic
questions about autism status and current mental health
conditions (any non-missing response to both questions was
suﬃcient for inclusion), not endorsing a diagnosis of dementia
or mild cognitive impairment, having completed at least 50
previous Proliﬁc tasks, and a 95% or higher approval rate on
Proliﬁc. Individuals endorsing severe/profound hearing loss
or the use of cochlear implants were also excluded from the
current study post hoc . Participants were recruited in two
single-sex batches of 750 (i.e., 750 males and 750 females,
recruited concurrently) to ensure approximate sex parity. The

Criterion DVMSQ operationalization
A. Presence of one or more commonplace “trigger” soundsathat reliably elicit
intense and inappropriate emotional responses, irrespective of sound intensity or
perceived loudness.Item S1 [Screening] = Yes
B. Trigger sounds reliablybevoke feelings of extreme irritation, anger, rage and/or
disgustcthat are clearly excessive, unreasonable, or out of proportion to the
circumstances (whether or not the individual recognizes them as such).One or more of the following:
Item 1 [Irritation]Often
Item 2 [Anger/Rage] Often
Item 4 [Disgust]Often
C. The individual actively avoidsdsituations or activities that include trigger sounds,
endures these situations with intense discomfort, or needs to block out potential
trigger sounds (e.g., using earplugs, music, or white noise) to cope with these
situations.One or more of the following:
Item 12 [Avoidance] Sometimes
Item 5 [Urge to run away] Often
Item 6 [Urge to cover ears] Often
D. If unable to avoid trigger sounds or stop them from occurring, the individual
experiences a signiﬁcant loss of self-control, potentially resulting in emotional
outbursts or other extreme reactions (e.g., yelling/screaming, running out of the
room, panic attacks, and rarely physical aggression).One or more of the following:
Item 8 [Lack of Control] Sometimes
Item 7 [Urge to be violent] Sometimes
E. The emotional reactions to trigger sounds are persistent, typically lasting for
6 months or more. Speciﬁc triggers do not need to remain constant over this period,
but at least one trigger sound must meet both criteria A and B at all times over the
preceding 6-month period.Not assessed by DVMSQ Assumed to be true if all other criteria
are satisﬁed.
F. Emotional reactions to trigger sounds and/or avoidance of these sounds cause
clinically signiﬁcant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning.Two or more of the following:
Item 13 [Social]Moderate
Item 14 [Occupational] Moderate
Item 15 [Household] Moderate
Item 16 [Community] Moderate
Item 18 [Mental Health] Moderate
Item 19 [Global Problems] Moderate
Item 20 [Life Aﬀected] Moderate
To meet the duke-vanderbilt Misophonia Screening Questionnaire (DVMSQ) criteria for “clinically signiﬁcant misophonia, ” an individual must meet all criteria A–F (criteria E is not
assessed by the DVMSQ and is assumed to be true if all others are satisﬁed). Individuals who meet criteria A–D but not criterion F are classiﬁed as having “sub-clinical misophonia.” Note
that the item numbers in this algorithm refer to the original DVMSQ and not the revised version provided in the supplemental information.
aIn accordance with the recent consensus deﬁnition of misophonia, these criteria do not require that the individual be triggered by chewing or other oro-nasal sounds.
bThese emotional reactions may be dependent on the context in which the trigger is encountered (e.g., only occurring when the trigger is produced by a speciﬁc person), but the reaction
should be easily reproducible within that speciﬁc context.
cEmotional responses to trigger sounds may be accompanied by fear, anxiety, or physical symptoms of sympathetic arousal (e.g., heart pounding, muscle tension, sweating, and
paresthesia), but in the absence of anger, irritation or disgust, these reactions are insuﬃcient to meet criterion B.
dIncludes both direct avoidance of the trigger stimulus and indirect avoidance (i.e., actions taken to stop the stimulus from occurring, such as telling another person to stop making a
sound, removing triggering household items, etc.).

study survey was advertised as examining “sensory sensitivities, ”
although participant-facing materials did not specify that the
study investigated decreased sound tolerance or misophonia
speciﬁcally. The full study survey included questionnaires on
demographics, medical/psychiatric history, decreased sound
tolerance symptoms, other sensory experiences, personality
traits, psychopathology, somatic symptom burden, and overall
quality of life, and surveys were completed on the REDCap
platform (Harris et al., 2009). All participants gave their
informed consent for the study, and participants who completed
the Proliﬁc task were compensated $5.00 USD for their time.
All study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review
Board at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
In order to ensure that the results of the Proliﬁc survey
were of high quality, a rigorous data quality assessment was
undertaken to ﬂag and remove potentially invalid responses
(Chandler et al., 2020). Participants were excluded if they (a)
failed one or more directed-response attention check questions
embedded within the survey (e.g., “To show that you are paying
attention, please leave this question blank”), (b) endorsed a
diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia despite denying
that diagnosis on their Proliﬁc demographics, (c) endorsed one
or more “infrequency” items in the medical history (e.g., a
reported history of temporal lobectomy), (d) provided symptom
information that was inconsistent with their lifetime medical
diagnoses (e.g., endorsed migraines caused by sound but denied
experiencing migraines), (e) reported information about their
demographics or autism diagnostic status that was inconsistent
with the information provided on their Proliﬁc demographics
form, (f) completed the survey in an exceptionally short amount
of time (i.e., more than three median absolute deviations below
the median completion time), or (g) endorsed random or
dishonest responding when queried at the end of the survey
with “no penalty honesty check” questions (e.g., “ Did you answer
any survey questions in this survey randomly? Your answer will
not aﬀect your compensation for this survey. ”). Participants were
also excluded if they completed the survey from a virtual private
network, an IP address located outside of the United States, or an
IP address associated with multiple survey respondents. Of the
1610 individuals who consented for the study, 1516 individuals
completed the full Proliﬁc survey and had their submissions
approved. Of these participants, 113 individuals (7.5%) were
excluded for failing one or more data quality check, leaving
a ﬁnal sample of 1403 individuals whose data were analyzed
for the current study (note that not all 1403 individuals were
included in all analyses).
Autistic (SPARK) sample
A sample of legally independent autistic adults was
recruited from the SPARK Research Match service (Project
No. RM0111Woynaroski_DST). A largely overlapping sample
has previously been described elsewhere (Williams et al.,
2022). Eligibility criteria included age 18 or older, self-
reported professional diagnoses of autism spectrum disorderor equivalent conditions (e.g., Asperger syndrome, Pervasive
Developmental Disorder–Not Otherwise Speciﬁed), and legal
independence (i.e., ability to consent for oneself). Although
autism diagnoses were not independently conﬁrmed, prior
research has generally supported the validity of self-reported
autism diagnoses within the SPARK cohort (Fombonne
et al., 2021). These participants completed a series of
online surveys assessing demographics, medical/psychiatric
history, core features of autism, co-occurring psychopathology,
somatic symptom burden, and quality of life, and the
instruments administered partially overlapped with those
in the Proliﬁc study. Surveys were completed within the
SPARK web platform using custom software designed by
Tempus Dynamics (Baltimore, MD, United States), and
participants were compensated with $10 USD in Amazon
gift cards upon completion of all surveys. All participants
gave informed consent, and all study procedures were
approved by the institutional review board at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center.
Individuals in the SPARK sample additionally underwent
a series of similar quality checks to the Proliﬁc sample.
Speciﬁcally, survey participants from the SPARK RM sample
were excluded if they (a) met the SPARK deﬁnition of a possibly
invalid autism diagnosis (e.g., age of diagnosis is under 1 year
of age; diagnosis rescinded by a professional), (b) did not
self-report a professional diagnosis of autism on the study-
speciﬁc demographics form, (c) reported demographic variables
(e.g., age, sex at birth, receipt of special education services
in childhood) that were inconsistent with those originally
reported to SPARK, (d) reported the use of a cochlear
implant, or (e) endorsed a professional diagnosis of either
Alzheimer’s disease or dissociative identity disorder (indicating
either careless/random responding or a true diagnosis that
could compromise the validity of self-report). Additionally,
individuals who dropped out of the study before completing
the DVMSQ and other sound tolerance measures were not
included in the current analyses. Of the 1271 individuals who
initially consented for the study, 1121 completed the measures
of interest. Of these individuals, an additional 185 (16.5%) were
excluded after failing one or more data quality checks, leaving a
ﬁnal sample of 936 autistic adults from SPARK whose data were
analyzed in the current study.
Measures
Duke-vanderbilt misophonia screening
questionnaire
The duke-vanderbilt misophonia Screening Questionnaire
(DVMSQ; Williams et al., 2021a) is a brief self-report measure
designed to assess the symptoms of misophonia proposed in
the Revised Amsterdam Criteria (Jager et al., 2020), as well
as functional impairment due to misophonia. The measure
also includes additional associated symptoms found to be

potentially relevant during the item-generation process for the
DMQ, including trigger-evoked fear/panic, physical symptoms,
and attention capture by the trigger stimulus. The version of
the DVMSQ administered to the Proliﬁc and SPARK cohorts
contained 21 items (one Yes/No “screening” item and 20 Likert
items), as well as two free-text ﬁelds to allow participants to
expand upon their trigger sounds and trigger-evoked physical
symptoms, respectively (see Table 1 for full item content).
Respondents are ﬁrst asked a single screening question (“ Are
there speciﬁc sounds that you are extremely bothered by, even
if they are not loud? Examples include: chewing, slurping,
crunching, throat clearing, ﬁnger tapping, foot shuﬄing, keyboard
tapping, rustling, nasal sounds, pen clicking, appliance humming,
clock ticking, and animal sounds. ”), and if they respond “No” to
this question, no further DVMSQ items are administered. For
participants who answer the screening question aﬃrmatively,
they are presented with a free-text ﬁeld in which they are
asked to list their speciﬁc trigger sounds. The remaining
questions include 12 “symptom frequency” items (rated on a
5-point Likert scale from 0 = “ Never ” to 4 = “ Very often ”),
as well as 8 “impairment” items (rated on a 5-point Likert
scale from 0 = “ Not at all ” to 4 = “ An extreme amount ”).
A subset of these items is additionally used to operationalize
the misophonia diagnostic criteria presented in this study (see
Table 2 for speciﬁcs). Scores on the 20 DVMSQ symptom and
impairment items were examined in the psychometric analysis
of the current study.
Duke misophonia questionnaire
The Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ; Rosenthal
et al., 2021) is an 86-item modular self-report questionnaire
that assesses a wide range of misophonia-related constructs,
including speciﬁc triggers, trigger frequency, responses to
misophonic triggers (aﬀective, physiological, and cognitive),
speciﬁc coping strategies (before, during and after being
triggered), misophonia-related impairment, and dysfunctional
beliefs related to misophonia. This measure was rigorously
developed using an iterative item generation process with
suggestions and feedback directly from individuals with
misophonia and their families, and a preliminary psychometric
study has established the latent structure, reliability, and
convergent validity of the DMQ subscales in a sample of
general-population adults (Rosenthal et al., 2021). In order to
reduce participant burden in the Proliﬁc and SPARK surveys,
participants completed an abbreviated version of the DMQ that
included only (a) the trigger list (16 Yes/No items), (b) the
“frequency of being triggered” item (6-point Likert scale from
1 = “ Once per month or less ” to 6 = “ 6 or more times per day ”),
(c) the 23 DMQ symptom scale (DMQ-SS) items (5 aﬀective, 8
physiological, 10 cognitive; rated on a 5-point Likert scale from
0 = “ Not at all ” to 4 = “ Always/Almost always ”), and a novel
“global impairment” item (“ Please rate the overall impact of ALL
bothersome sounds on your life over the past month. ”) that was
rated on a visual analog scale (V AS) ranging from 0 = “ No Eﬀect”to 100 = “ Extreme Eﬀect. ” SPARK participants also completed
the DMQ Impairment Scale (12 items), but, given the focus of
the current investigation of this study on the Proliﬁc sample, this
scale was not examined in our analyses. Participants who did
not endorse any triggers on the trigger list did not complete the
remaining DMQ questions. Measures derived from the DMQ
included (a) number of trigger categories endorsed (range 0–
15), trigger frequency (range 1–6), DMQ-SS mean symptom
score (range 0–4), and global impairment V AS (range 0–100).
The reliability of the DMQ-SS in the Proliﬁc sample was
excellent ( a= 0.946), and the DMQ-SS correlated strongly with
all other DMQ-derived variables (number of trigger categories:
r= 0.545, CI 95%[0.501, 0.587]; trigger frequency: rpoly= 0.635,
CI95% [0.597, 0.670]; global impairment V AS: r= 0.625, CI 95%
[0.586, 0.661]).
Inventory of hyperacusis symptoms
The Inventory of Hyperacusis Symptoms (IHS; Greenberg
and Carlos, 2018) is a 25-item self-report questionnaire designed
to assess the symptoms of hyperacusis, as well as emotional
responses to sounds, quality of life, mental health impact, and
functional impairment due to decreased sound tolerance. Items
are organized into ﬁve empirically derived subscales, including
general loudness (3 items), emotional arousal (6 items),
psychosocial impact (9 items), functional impact (5 items),
and communication (2 items). This measure has demonstrated
strong reliability, as well as some degree of convergent/divergent
validity in both an online sample of individuals with tinnitus
and/or hyperacusis (Greenberg and Carlos, 2018) and a care-
seeking sample of individuals attending a specialist tinnitus and
hyperacusis clinic in the United Kingdom (Aazh et al., 2021).
Although designed to speciﬁcally assess hyperacusis, the IHS
has not been formally tested in individuals with misophonia or
other sound tolerance disorders; thus, it is unclear the degree
to which the IHS subscales measuring emotional arousal and
psychosocial/functional impact are confounded by misophonia
severity. Thus, while the IHS total score (range 25–100) was
reported descriptively as a measure of “hyperacusis severity” in
the current study, the “general loudness” subscale (IHS-LOUD;
range 3–12) was examined in analyses of discriminant validity
due to its lack of content overlap with misophonia measures
such as the DVMSQ and the DMQ. In the Proliﬁc sample,
reliability was good for both the IHS total score ( a= 0.963) and
the IHS-LOUD score ( a= 0.803).
DSM-5 severity measure for speciﬁc
phobia–modiﬁed for phonophobia
The DSM-5 Severity Measure for Speciﬁc Phobia (DSM-
SP; Lebeau et al., 2012) is a 10-item scale published by
the American Psychiatric Association to dimensionally assess
symptoms of speciﬁc phobias in adults. Participants are ﬁrst
asked to determine which of ﬁve common phobia topics (e.g.,
“Animals or insects ”; “Blood, needles, or injections ”) is most
anxiety provoking for them, proceeding to rate their symptoms
Frontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org

fpsyg-13-897901 July 16, 2022 Time: 21:21 # 8
Williams et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.897901
over the past week when encountering situations related to the
topic chosen. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale with
responses ranging from 0 = “ Never ” to 4 = “ All of the time , ”
and the mean score (range 0–4) is calculated as a dimensional
index of phobia severity. The reliability and validity of the DSM-
SP has been established in both clinical and non-clinical adult
samples (Lebeau et al., 2012; Knappe et al., 2013, 2014). In
the current study, this measure was modiﬁed to speciﬁcally
assess phonophobia rather than other speciﬁc phobias. Thus,
in the current study, we omitted the choice of phobic topics
from the DSM-SP and instead administered the items with
the following instructions: “ The following questions ask about
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that you may have had in a
variety of situations. Over the PAST SEVEN DAYS, how often
have you experienced the following regarding situations when you
are exposed to loud or unpleasant sounds? ” The wording of the
DSM-SP questions themselves was unchanged from the original
version. In the Proliﬁc sample, the reliability of the DSM-
SP (with directions modiﬁed as detailed above) was excellent
(a= 0.925).
Additional measures of psychopathology,
somatic symptoms, and quality of life
Several additional self-report questionnaires (administered
to the Proliﬁc sample only) were collected in order to assess
the nomological validity of the DVMSQ. Symptoms of general
anxiety and depression were measured using the Overall Anxiety
Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS; Norman et al., 2006)
and Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS;
Bentley et al., 2014; Ito et al., 2015), respectively. Possible scores
on these measures range from 0 to 20, and reliabilities in the
Proliﬁc sample were good (OASIS: a= 0.862; ODSIS: a= 0.871).
Clinically relevant manifestations of anger (including subjective
feelings of anger, overt verbal aggression, and destructive urges)
in the past week were assessed using the Clinically Useful Anger
Outcome Scale (CUANGOS; Levin-Aspenson et al., 2021).
CUANGOS scores range from 0 to 20, and reliability in the
Proliﬁc sample was good ( a= 0.857). Multi-system somatic
symptom burden was measured using the Somatic Symptom
Scale–8 (SSS-8; Gierk et al., 2014). SSS-8 total scores range from
0 to 32, and this score exhibited good reliability in the Proliﬁc
sample ( a= 0.814). Lastly, overall quality of life (i.e., general
life satisfaction) was measured using the 6-item Riverside Life
Satisfaction Scale (RLSS; Margolis et al., 2019). RLSS total scores
range from 6 to 42, and reliability in the Proliﬁc sample was
excellent ( a= 0.900).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.1.0 (R
Core Team, 2021). Relevant demographic and clinical variables
were summarized descriptively. Diﬀerences between the Proliﬁc
and SPARK samples on demographic and clinical variables werequantiﬁed using Cohen’s dfor continuous variables and odds
ratios (ORs) for categorical variables.
Duke-vanderbilt misophonia screening
questionnaire item analysis
Item-level statistics, including category endorsement
frequencies, percent endorsement of each item (at a level
fulﬁlling the operational diagnostic criteria), and corrected
item-total (polyserial) correlations, were examined for
all DVMSQ participants within the Proliﬁc sample who
aﬃrmatively answered the DVMSQ screening question
(n= 833). We additionally calculated the polyserial correlation
between each DVMSQ item and scores on (a) the DMQ-SS
(misophonia symptoms), (b) the DSM-SP (phonophobia
symptoms), and (c) the IHS-LOUD (hyperacusis symptoms),
with the hypothesis that items measuring misophonia symptoms
(though not necessarily items measuring misophonia-related
impairment) would correlate more strongly with the DMQ-SS
than with either the DSM-SP or IHS-LOUD.
Structural analyses of the duke-vanderbilt
misophonia screening questionnaire
In order to assess the overall dimensionality of the DVMSQ,
we ﬁrst performed an exploratory graph analysis (EGA; Golino
and Epskamp, 2017; Golino et al., 2020) using the EGAnet
R package (Golino and Christensen, 2020). The EGA was
performed using a regularized partial correlation network
based on polychoric correlations (“EBICglasso” estimation with
g= 0.5 and l= 0.1), and communities were determined
using the Walktrap algorithm with four steps (Christensen
et al., 2020). In order to better approximate the normal latent
trait distributions assumed by the polychoric correlations, the
analysis was performed on only data from individuals who
completed all DVMSQ items (i.e., the zeros in the zero-
inﬂated distribution were discarded). Although the number of
dimensions was the primary variable of interest derived from
this analysis, we also investigated the community assignment of
the various DVMSQ items, determining whether this process
identiﬁed communities that conformed to the theoretical
dimensions of symptoms and impairment. In cases where
speciﬁc items (particularly those not reﬂecting the operational
diagnostic criteria for misophonia) were not clustering as
expected with other items (i.e., an impairment item being
assigned to a symptom dimension or vice versa), those items
were removed from the analysis, and the EGA process was
repeated. To further assess the dimensionality of the DVMSQ,
we additionally employed the Factor Forest method (Goretzko
and Bühner, 2020, 2022), a novel machine-learning based factor
retention criterion that has shown excellent performance in
recent simulation studies.
After assessing the dimensionality of the full DVMSQ,
we investigated the latent structure of the symptom and
impairment dimensions separately using full-information
bifactor item response theory (IRT) modeling with iterative

model reﬁnement and replication in a holdout sample.
Individuals who did not aﬃrm the DVMSQ screening question
(and therefore did not ﬁll out all subsequent items referring
to one’s experience of triggering sounds) were excluded from
IRT analysis. To perform our IRT analyses, the 833 individuals
in the Proliﬁc sample who answered all DVMSQ questions
were divided into exploratory ( n= 417) and conﬁrmatory
[holdout] ( n= 416) subsamples. A bifactor graded response
model (Gibbons et al., 2007; Cai et al., 2011; Toland et al., 2017)
was ﬁt to item response data for symptoms and impairment
items separately in the exploratory subsample, with results
from the EGA community assignment used to preliminarily
assign items to speciﬁc factors. Models were ﬁt using the mirt
R package (Chalmers, 2012), with the Bock and Aitkin (1981)
Expectation-Maximization algorithm employed for models
without cross-loadings on speciﬁc factors and the Quasi-Monte
Carlo Expectation-Maximization algorithm (Hori et al., 2020)
employed for all other models.
Global IRT model ﬁt was assessed using the limited-
information C2ﬁt index (Cai and Monroe, 2014; Monroe and
Cai, 2015) accompanied by C2-based approximate ﬁt indices,
including the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI C2; Cai et al., 2021),
root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA C2; Maydeu-
Olivares and Joe, 2014), and standardized root-mean-square
residual (SRMR; Maydeu-Olivares and Joe, 2014). Local model
misﬁt was assessed based on examination of standardized
residuals, with | rres|>0.1 judged to indicate signiﬁcant
model misspeciﬁcation. Additionally, local item dependence
was evaluated using the Q 3residual correlation (Yen, 1984),
with model-speciﬁc critical values based on the 99th percentile
of a simulated distribution (1,000 simulated datasets) based
on parametric bootstrapping (Christensen et al., 2017). Within
the exploratory subsample, items that demonstrated either |
rres|>0.1 or Q 3values above the empirical cutoﬀ value
were either deleted from the model or speciﬁed to load onto
another speciﬁc factor. Additionally, when an item loaded
poorly onto a speciﬁc factor (i.e., standardized | l|<0.1),
that factor loading was set to zero in future model iterations.
This process was repeated until the ﬁnal exploratory models
for symptoms and impairment demonstrated no signiﬁcant
local misspeciﬁcation and all speciﬁc factor loadings were
greater than 0.1. The exploratory model was then re-ﬁt in
the holdout sample, and global/local misﬁt were evaluated
using the same criteria. Final models for symptoms and
impairment were then re-ﬁt in the combined Proliﬁc sample
(n= 833), and ﬁnal model parameters were examined.
Bifactor indices (Rodriguez et al., 2016) were also examined
to evaluate each dimension’s model-based reliability (omega
total [ &T]), general factor saturation (omega hierarchical
[&H]), and essential unidimensionality (explained common
variance [ECV]).
Once psychometrically adequate models were chosen for
both symptoms and impairments, the two scale subsections wereﬁt within a single bifactor IRT model. This model was evaluated
in the exploratory sample for potential misspeciﬁcation, with a
slightly more relaxed misspeciﬁcation criterion of | rres|>0.15
used to accommodate the larger model size and substantially
increased number of residual correlations. Misspeciﬁcations
were addressed iteratively, and the ﬁnal model ﬁt was tested
in the hold-out sample for conﬁrmation. Once an adequate
model was generated for the full DVMSQ, this model was ﬁt
in the combined Proliﬁc sample ( n= 833), and ﬁnal model
parameters (including model-based total score reliability [ &T],
general factor saturation [ &H], and essential unidimensionality
[ECV]) were examined. This ﬁnal model generated in the
Proliﬁc sample was then re-ﬁt in the SPARK sample (again using
only the individuals who completed all DVMSQ items; n= 645)
and evaluated for global and local misspeciﬁcation to determine
whether the structure of the DVMSQ was conﬁgurally invariant
across the two populations. Model parameters and bifactor
indices in the autistic sample were also examined.
Once a structural model was found to adequately ﬁt both the
Proliﬁc and SPARK samples, we ﬁt multiple-group IRT models
to the full dataset, which were then used to test diﬀerential
item functioning (DIF) of the DVMSQ items between diagnostic
groups. For the purpose of DIF analyses, individuals in the
Proliﬁc sample who self-reported an autism diagnosis were
considered as belonging to the autism group. DIF testing was
performed using a version of the iterative Wald test procedure
proposed by Cao et al. (2017), in which all items are tested for
DIF using a “Wald-2” procedure (Woods et al., 2013), all items
not demonstrating DIF are selected as anchors, and the Wald
test is performed again on the remaining items iteratively until
all tested items show DIF at the p<0.05 level (uncorrected).
Given the likelihood of this method to detect trivially small yet
non-zero DIF at the sample sizes tested in the current study
(Williams et al., 2021b; Williams and Gotham, 2021a,b), items
with a standardized DIF eﬀect size (expected score standardized
diﬀerence [ESSD]; Meade, 2010) less than 0.2 (i.e., smaller
than Cohen’s (1988) deﬁnition of a “small” eﬀect) were also
included as anchor items for the iterative Wald procedure.
In order to reduce computational burden and address model
convergence issues, means and variances of all speciﬁc factors
(i.e., all factors except the general factor) were ﬁxed to the
values used in the “Wald-2” procedure. This version of the
iterative Wald method was implemented using a custom R
function written by the ﬁrst author (Williams, 2021). An item
was ﬂagged as exhibiting practically signiﬁcant DIF if both
(a) the omnibus Wald test demonstrated a p-value <0.05
after Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction (i.e.,
pFDR<0.05) and (b) the ESSD eﬀect size was greater than
0.5, indicating a “medium” or larger amount of DIF (Meade,
2010). Moreover, the combined biasing eﬀect of all DIF on
sum score diﬀerences between groups (i.e., diﬀerential test
functioning [DTF]) was evaluated in total score units (UETSDS)
and Cohen dunits (ETSSD), with values of ETSSD >0.1 judged

Williams et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.897901
to be a practically meaningful amount of DTF. Signiﬁcant
omnibus Wald tests demonstrating DIF in individual items
were followed up with separate tests of slopes vs. intercept
diﬀerences in order to determine whether DIF was uniform
(aﬀecting intercepts only) or non-uniform (aﬀecting slopes with
or without interceptions) (Stover et al., 2019). In addition
to assessing DIF by diagnostic group, we also examined DIF
within the Proliﬁc sample according to age ( <30 vs.30),
sex (Female vs. Male), and level of education (any college
degree vs. “some college” or less). Notably, the cutpoints used
to dichotomize age and education were chosen to allow for
suﬃciently large numbers of participants (i.e., >300) in each
subgroup, increasing the measurement precision in the focal
group and power to detect signiﬁcant DIF.
Validity testing
After evaluating the latent structure and DIF of the DVMSQ,
we calculated summary scores for the measure, including a
total score (17 items; range 0–68), symptom score (10 items;
range 0–40), and impairment score (7 items; range 0–28).
To assess the nomological validity of the DVMSQ-derived
scores, we examined zero-order Pearson correlations between
DVMSQ scores and correlates of interest (i.e., scores from the
DMQ, IHS, DSM-SP , OASIS, ODSIS, CUANGOS, SSS-8, and
RLSS) in both the whole Proliﬁc sample ( n= 1403) and the
subsample that completed all DVMSQ items ( n= 833). We
hypothesized that the DVMSQ scores would exhibit strong
positive correlations ( r>0.5) with all DMQ-derived scores
(based on the minimal accepted criteria for convergent validity;
Carlson and Herdman, 2012), as well as moderate positive
correlations with all remaining variables ( r>0.3) except
for the RLSS score, which was expected to demonstrate a
moderate negative correlation with the DVMSQ ( r< 0.3).
To further demonstrate the construct validity of the DVMSQ
scores, we used the Zou (2007) conﬁdence interval procedure
to test whether the three DVMSQ-derived scores correlated
more highly with the DMQ-SS than with measures of other
types of decreased sound tolerance (IHS-LOUD, DSM-SP),
anxiety (OASIS), depression (ODSIS), or somatic symptoms
(SSS-8). Moreover, given the central role that anger plays in
the construct of misophonia, we further hypothesized that the
DVMSQ would correlate more highly with the CUANGOS
score than with either the OASIS or ODSIS. All comparisons
between dependent correlations were conducted using the cocor
R package (Diedenhofen and Musch, 2015).
Results
Participant characteristics
In total, the combined sample included DVMSQ data from
2339 individuals across the two data sources, 1478 of whom(Proliﬁc: n= 833; SPARK: n= 645) aﬃrmatively answered
DVMSQ screening question S1 and went on to complete the full
measure. Demographics and clinical characterization of each
sample (as well as the portions of the sample who (a) had
screen-positive responses to DVMSQ item S1 [“S1 Positive”
group] and (b) met the DVMSQ deﬁnition of misophonia
[“Clinical Misophonia” group]) are presented in Table 3 . Adults
in the current study ranged from 18 to 83 years old, with
participants in the SPARK sample (mean [ SD] age = 37.49
[13.28] years) being slightly older on average than those in
the Proliﬁc sample (mean [ SD] age = 32.27 [12.55] years),
d= 0.41, CI 95% [0.32, 0.49]. Though the Proliﬁc sample had a
balanced sex ratio by design (51.1% female sex among retained
participants), this was not the case for the SPARK sample (63.0%
female sex), which contained a signiﬁcantly higher proportion
of participants assigned female at birth, OR = 1.63, CI 95%
[1.38, 1.93]. Non-Hispanic White participants made up the
majority of individuals in both samples (Proliﬁc: 70.4%; SPARK:
80.1%), and approximately half of participants in each sample
had completed a 4-year college degree (Proliﬁc: 50.4%, SPARK:
48.2%). The median age of autism diagnosis in the SPARK
sample was 23.21 years (IQR [11.77, 36.79]), with 38.7% of
the sample being diagnosed with autism before the age of 18.
Notably, an additional 32 individuals from the Proliﬁc sample
(2.3% of total sample, 43.8% female, mean [ SD] age = 32.22
[12.14] years) reported receiving professional diagnoses of
autism at a median age of 22.50 years (IQR [15.75, 32.50],
range 3–50 years).
Based on the DVMSQ algorithm, a total of 102 individuals
in the Proliﬁc sample (7.3%, including 7 autistic adults) and
332 individuals in the SPARK sample (35.5%) met criteria
for clinically signiﬁcant misophonia. Subclinical misophonia,
deﬁned as meeting all DVMSQ criteria except for the
“impairment” criterion, was present in an additional 144 adults
in the Proliﬁc sample (10.2%) and 97 adults in the SPARK
sample (10.4%). Notably only 10 individuals in the Proliﬁc
sample (0.7%) and 21 individuals in the SPARK sample (2.2%)
reported being previously diagnosed with misophonia by a
professional, with almost all of these individuals meeting
DVMSQ criteria for misophonia (Proliﬁc: 7 Clinical, 2
Subclinical, 1 No misophonia; SPARK: 19 Clinical, 1 Subclinical,
1 No misophonia). Furthermore, over 85% of individuals with
clinically signiﬁcant misophonia in both samples (Proliﬁc:
90.2%; SPARK: 85.5%) reported oronasal or throat sounds as
among their misophonic triggers (deﬁned as endorsing “ Mouth
sounds while eating , ” “Nasal/throat sounds , ” and/or “ Mouth
sounds while not eating ” on the DMQ trigger list).
Within the Proliﬁc sample, individuals meeting criteria
for clinically signiﬁcant misophonia were slightly younger
(Misophonia: 29.69 years, Other: 32.48 years; d= 0.22,
CI95% [ 0.42, 0.02]), more likely to be female (Misophonia:
72.5%, Other: 49.4%; OR = 2.70, CI 95% [1.73, 4.23]), and less
likely to have completed a 4-year college degree (Misophonia:

individuals with no clinically signiﬁcant misophonia. Although
the association between misophonia and female sex wassimilarly robust in the SPARK sample (OR = 3.07, CI 95%
[2.26, 4.18]), associations with younger age ( d= 0.04, CI 95%
[ 0.17, 0.10]) and lower college completion (OR = 0.83,

CI95% [0.63, 1.09]) were much smaller and not statistically
signiﬁcant. Additionally, as expected, individuals meeting
DVMSQ misophonia criteria demonstrated much higher scores
on the DMQ-SS (Proliﬁc: d= 2.71, CI 95% [2.49, 2.94]; SPARK:
d= 1.65, CI 95%[1.50, 1.80]), more reported misophonia triggers
(Proliﬁc: d= 1.80, CI 95% [1.59, 2.01]; SPARK: d= 1.31, CI 95%
[1.17, 1.46]), and higher V AS scores for misophonia-related
impairment (Proliﬁc: d= 1.52, CI 95% [1.30, 1.73]; SPARK:
d= 1.20, CI 95%[1.05, 1.34]) than individuals without DVMSQ-
deﬁned misophonia. For individuals in the Proliﬁc sample,
misophonia status was also strongly associated with higher levels
of anxiety (OASIS; d= 1.22, CI 95% [1.01, 1.42]), depression
(ODSIS; d= 1.08, CI 95% [0.87, 1.28]), anger (CUANGOS;

of life (RLSS; d= 0.62, CI 95%[ 0.82, 0.42]).
Item analysis
Duke-vanderbilt misophonia Screening Questionnaire
item category frequencies, percentages of each item fulﬁlling
its associated operational diagnostic criterion, item-total
correlations, and correlations with other sound tolerance
measures (DMQ-SS, IHS-LOUD, and DSM-SP) are presented
for the Proliﬁc sample in Table 4 . Item endorsement at levels
corresponding to the diagnostic criteria was highly variable
and ranged from 7.4% ( Impairment – Community ) to 55.2%
(Intense irritation or annoyance ). Corrected item-total polyserial
correlations were high (median rit= 0.677, IQR [0.636, 0.765]),
with all correlations greater than 0.5 with the exception of item
4 (Disgust ). Polyserial correlations between DVMSQ items
and the DMQ-SS (median rpoly = 0.601, IQR [0.565, 0.639])
were somewhat higher on average than correlations with either
the IHS-LOUD subscale (median rpoly = 0.479, IQR [0.405,
0.634]) or the DSM-SP score (median rpoly= 0.479, IQR [0.417,
0.619]). Notably, the DVMSQ items assessing misophonia
symptoms tended to correlate more strongly with the DMQ-SS
than the IHS-LOUD or DSM-SP , but this was not typically
the case for the DVMSQ impairment items, several of which
correlated more strongly with the IHS-LOUD and/or DSM-SP
than the DMQ-SS.
Dimensionality assessment
Exploratory graph analysis of the original 20 DVMSQ
items was conducted in the subset of Proliﬁc participants
who screened positive on DVMSQ item S1 ( n= 833),
revealing a partial correlation network with four communities.
These communities were interpreted as Symptoms: Anger and
Aggression (items 1, 2, 4, and 7). Symptoms: Distress and
Avoidance (items 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12); Impairment: Speciﬁc(items 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17); and Impairment: Global Impact
(items 3, 18, 19, and 20). Notably, item 3 ( Fear or panic )
was assigned to the “Impairment: Global Impact ”community
rather than either of the symptom communities, suggesting
that it likely represented a separate latent variable than the
other items tapping distress and avoidance. Thus, item 3 was
dropped from the model, and the EGA was repeated with the
remaining items. After removing item 3, the dimensionality and
community structure of the 19 remaining items did not change,
and this structure was then used to inform the structure of IRT
models for both symptoms (11 items) and impairment (8 items).
Further converging with the results of the EGA, the Factor
Forest method also found a four-dimensional structure to be
most likely, both before ( PkD4= 0.865) and after ( PkD4= 0.801)
removing item 3.
Item response theory analyses
Misophonia symptoms
In the exploratory subsample of Proliﬁc participants, we ﬁrst
ﬁt the 11 symptom items with a bifactor model, in which all
items loaded on one general factor, and each item additionally
loaded on a speciﬁc factor based on its community assignment
within the EGA (i.e., items 1, 2, 4, and 7 on speciﬁc factor
1 and items 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 on speciﬁc factor 2).
This initial model demonstrated global ﬁt indices that were
adequate overall ( C2(33) = 92.55, p<0.001, TLI C2= 0.976,
RMSEA C2= 0.066, CI 90% [0.050, 0.082], SRMR = 0.041), and
no local dependence, but two standardized residuals (items 4
[Disgust ] and 5 [ Urge to run away ]:rres= 0.156; items 4 [ Disgust ]
and 11 [ Excessive/unreasonable reactions ]:rres= 0.115) were
greater than 0.1, suggesting additional local misspeciﬁcation.
Furthermore, while examination of factor loadings in this model
demonstrated large positive loadings on the general factor for
all items (median lG= 0.714, range [0.464, 0.815]), loadings
on the “Distress and Avoidance” factor were negligible for
items 8 ( Loss of control ;lS2= 0.065) and 9 ( Attention
capture by trigger ;lS2= 0.008). Item 11 also demonstrated
an unexpected loading pattern, with a strong general factor
loading ( lG= 0.743) and a moderate negative loading on
the “Distress and Avoidance” factor ( lS2= 0.309). Thus,
to correct the model misspeciﬁcation, we allowed item 4 to
load onto both speciﬁc factors, ﬁxed the loadings of items
8 and 9 on speciﬁc factor 2 to 0, and removed item 11
(Excessive/unreasonable reactions ) from the model entirely. The
resulting model demonstrated signiﬁcantly improved ﬁt in the
exploratory subsample ( C2(26) = 33.53, p= 0.147, TLI C2= 0.996,
RMSEA C2= 0.026, CI 90% [0.000, 0.050], SRMR = 0.028),
no local dependence, no large residuals, and factor loadings
all greater than 0.1. This same model was then re-ﬁt in
the conﬁrmatory subsample, again demonstrating adequate ﬁt
(C2(26) = 67.19, p<0.001, TLI C2= 0.979, RMSEA C2= 0.062,

CI90%[0.044, 0.080], SRMR = 0.037) and no local dependence.
One residual correlation between items 7 ( Violent urges ) and 8
(Loss of control ) was above the cutoﬀ value in the conﬁrmatory
sample ( rres= 0.112); however, allowing item 8 to load onto the
“Anger and Aggression” factor produced a standardized loading
of<0.1; thus, the model without this loading was retained as our
ﬁnal symptom model. IRT model parameters, factor loadings
and bifactor coeﬃcients for the ﬁnal symptom model (ﬁt to the
combined exploratory and conﬁrmatory Proliﬁc samples) are
presented in Supplementary Tables 1 ,2. Bifactor coeﬃcients
indicated high reliability ( &T= 0.927), with the majority
of variance accounted for by a single general “misophonia
symptoms” factor ( &H= 0.825, ECV = 0.747).
Misophonia-related impairment
In the exploratory subsample of Proliﬁc participants, we
ﬁt the eight impairment items with a bifactor S–1 model (Eid
et al., 2018), in which all items loaded onto a single general
factor and the three “Global Impact” items loaded onto a
single speciﬁc factor in accordance with their EGA community
assignment. This initial model demonstrated adequate global ﬁt
(C2(17) = 55.19, p<0.001, TLI C2= 0.985, RMSEA C2= 0.073,
CI90% [0.052, 0.095], SRMR = 0.041), no local dependence,and no large residuals. Additionally, loadings on the general
factor were strong for all items (median lG= 0.846, range
[0.817, 0.886]), and all speciﬁc factor loadings were greater than
0.1. However, when this model was re-ﬁt in the conﬁrmatory
subsample, the global ﬁt was substantially worse ( C2(17) = 75.01,
p<0.001, TLI C2= 0.978, RMSEA C2= 0.091, CI 90% [0.070,
0.112], SRMR = 0.053). This decrement in ﬁt was accompanied
by two large residual pairs (item 14 [ Impairment – Occupational ]
and item 17 [ Impairment – Concentration ]:rres= 0.122; item
14 and item 20 [ Global impact – Life worse ]:rres= 0.120),
as well as signiﬁcant local dependence between items 14
and 17 (Q 3= 0.276 [99th percentile: 0.233]). In response
to this local misﬁt, we removed item 17 from the model,
resulting in adequate global ﬁt ( C2(11) = 19.95, p= 0.046,
TLI C2= 0.995, RMSEA C2= 0.044, CI 90% [0.006, 0.075],
SRMR = 0.035), no large residuals, and no locally dependent
item pairs within the conﬁrmatory sample. This model also ﬁt
well within the exploratory sample C2(11) = 18.89, p= 0.063,
TLI C2= 0.995, RMSEA C2= 0.042, CI 90% [0.000, 0.072],
SRMR = 0.033, again demonstrating no local misﬁt or local
item dependence. Thus, it was retained as the ﬁnal model. IRT

conﬁrmatory Proliﬁc samples) are presented in Supplementary
Tables 3 ,4. Bifactor coeﬃcients indicated high reliability
(&T= 0.958), with almost all reliable variance accounted for
by a single general “misophonia-related impairment” factor
(&H= 0.905, ECV = 0.902).
All duke-vanderbilt misophonia screening
questionnaire items (symptoms and
impairment)
Within the exploratory Proliﬁc subsample, we ﬁt a bifactor
model to all 17 remaining DVMSQ items, including one
general factor and four speciﬁc factors ( Anger and Aggression :
items 1, 2, 4, and 7; Distress and Avoidance : items 4, 5,
6, 10, and 12; Overall Impairment : items 13, 14, 15, 16,
18, 19, and 20; and Global Impact : items 18, 19, and 20).
This model ﬁt the data in the exploratory subsample well
(C2(100) = 144.33, p= 0.002, TLI C2= 0.994, RMSEA C2= 0.033,
CI90%[0.020, 0.044], SRMR = 0.044) and demonstrated no local
dependence. However, two residual correlations exceeded 0.15
(item 12 [ Avoidance of triggers ] and item 13 [ Impairment –
Social ]:rres= 0.163; item 12 and item 16 [ Impairment –
Community ]:rres= 0.152), prompting us to allow item 12 to
cross-load onto the “Overall Impairment” factor. The revised
model demonstrated slightly improved ﬁt ( C2(99) = 129.62,
p= 0.021, TLI C2= 0.996, RMSEA C2= 0.027, CI 90% [0.011,
0.039], SRMR = 0.035), no residual correlations greater than
0.15, and no locally dependent item pairs. This revised model
was then re-ﬁt in the conﬁrmatory sample, again exhibiting
adequate global ﬁt ( C2(99) = 188.05, p<0.001, TLI C2= 0.988,
RMSEA C2= 0.047, CI 90% [0.036, 0.057], SRMR = 0.046), no
large residuals, and no local dependence. The same model
ﬁt in the SPARK sample also demonstrated adequate ﬁt in
the population of autistic adults ( C2(99) = 196.06, p<0.001,
TLI C2= 0.991, RMSEA C2= 0.039, CI 90% [0.031, 0.047],
SRMR = 0.042), as well as no local misﬁt or locally dependent
item pairs. Parameters for the combined model in both the
Proliﬁc and SPARK samples are presented in Table 5 . Notably,
while reliability of the DVMSQ total score was very high
in both samples (Proliﬁc: &T= 0.977; SPARK: &T= 0.957;
Supplementary Tables 5 ,6), the “general misophonia” factor
explained a smaller relative proportion of total score variance
(Proliﬁc: &H= 0.756, ECV = 0.586; SPARK: &H= 0.740,
ECV = 0.567), seemingly due to the sizable minority of
variance in DVMSQ impairment items attributed to the “Overall
Impairment” factor (Proliﬁc: &HS= 0.457; SPARK: &HS= 0.474).
Moreover, the DVMSQ symptom and impairment scales
demonstrated signiﬁcant convergence (Proliﬁc: r= 0.560, CI 95%
[0.512, 0.605]; SPARK: r= 0.617, CI 95%[0.567, 0.662]), although
the magnitude of their intercorrelation was low enough to
suggest that the two scores may diﬀerentially correlate with
external variables in some cases (Carlson and Herdman, 2012).
For the 17 DVMSQ items included in the ﬁnal model, DIF
was evaluated using the iterative Wald test procedure. Based onthese tests, statistically signiﬁcant DIF (i.e., pFDR<0.05 and |
ESSD| >0.2) was detected in four DVMSQ items (4, 10, 12,
and 16; Table 6 ), although only the DIF in item 12 ( Avoidance of
triggers ; ESSD = 0.587) was large enough to meet our threshold
of practical signiﬁcance. Moreover, the total impact of DIF on
between-group score diﬀerences was relatively low, on average
summing to a less-than-one point diﬀerence on a 68-point scale
(UETSDS = 0.722, ETSSD = 0.053). As this was within the
amount of DTF that we deemed ignorable in practice (i.e., |
ETSSD| <0.1), we concluded that the DVMSQ is approximately
invariant according to autism status. DIF was also evaluated
within the Proliﬁc sample with respect to age group ( <30 years
old vs.30 years old), sex (female vs. male), and education level
(any college degree vs. “some college” or less). No statistically
signiﬁcant DIF was found according to age (all pFDR>0.169; all
| ESSD| <0.387) or education level (all pFDR>0.607; all | ESSD|
<0.192), although practically signiﬁcant DIF between males
and females was observed for item 12 (ESSD = 0.650). However,
as in the case of DIF by diagnostic group, the degree of DTF by
sex was less than one DVMSQ scale point (UETSDS = 0.420,
ETSSD = 0.040) and was deemed small enough to not result in
a practically signiﬁcant amount of bias. Thus, based on these
results, the DVMSQ was judged to be approximately invariant
across age, sex, education level, and diagnostic status.
Validity testing
Zero-order correlations between the DVMSQ scales and
external variables of interest are presented in Table 7 . Notably,
the DVMSQ total score correlated very highly with the
DMQ-SS score in both the full sample ( r= 0.802, CI 95%
[0.783, 0.820]) and the S1 Positive sample ( r= 0.855, CI 95%
[0.835, 0.872]), strongly supporting the convergent validity
of these two measures. Although most observed correlations
were similar in magnitude to our predictions, correlations
between all DVMSQ scores and non-misophonia forms of
decreased sound tolerance (i.e., the IHS-LOUD and DSM-
SP) were substantially larger than expected, and correlations
between the DVMSQ scores and the RLSS were somewhat
smaller than expected. When statistically comparing correlation
coeﬃcients, the DVMSQ total score was more strongly
correlated with the DMQ-SS than either the IHS-LOUD score
(Whole Sample: 1r= 0.192, CI 95% [0.165, 0.222]; DVMSQ-
complete Sample: 1r= 0.175, CI 95% [0.143, 0.210]) or the
DSM-SP score (Whole Sample: 1r= 0.204, CI 95% [0.177,
0.233]; DVMSQ-complete Sample: 1r= 0.153, CI 95% [0.124,
0.185]), providing modest evidence of divergent validity despite
the relatively high correlations with measures of hyperacusis
and misophonia. This same pattern of correlation diﬀerences
was present for the DVMSQ symptom score but not the
DVMSQ impairment score ( Table 7 ), suggesting that the
latter score does not necessarily diﬀerentiate impairment

due to misophonia from impairment due to other forms of
decreased sound tolerance. Lastly, contrary to our hypotheses,
correlations between the DVMSQ and the CUANGOS were not
uniformly larger than correlations between the DVMSQ and
the OASIS, ODSIS, or SSS-8 (Whole Sample: 1rs = 0.048–
0.038; DVMSQ-complete Sample: 1rs = 0.021–0.063), with
similar patterns observed for both the DVMSQ symptom and
impairment subscales as well. In fact, in all but one case
(symptom score in the DVMSQ-complete Sample), somatic
symptom burden was a stronger correlate of the DVMSQ than
depression, anxiety, or anger, although absolute diﬀerences
between correlations were generally small in magnitude (all
1rs<0.1).Discussion
Though a number of novel self-report questionnaires
have been published in the past several years to assess the
symptoms of misophonia, there is still limited consensus
regarding the most suitable measures for diﬀerent purposes
within misophonia research and clinical care (e.g., diagnosis,
screening, clinical phenotyping, longitudinal symptom tracking,
quantifying response to intervention). In the current study,
we introduced and examined the psychometric properties of
the DVMSQ, a brief measure of misophonia symptoms and
associated impairment designed speciﬁcally to assess a set
of operational diagnostic criteria and determine “misophonia

Both models assume that all latent variables are orthogonal and have a standard normal distribution (i.e., M= 0, SD= 1) in the population. Diﬀerences in intercept terms between the

caseness” in the context of research studies. Examining DVMSQ
responses from over 2,000 autistic and non-autistic adults, we
iteratively tested and subsequently replicated the latent structure
of the questionnaire, which was found to be approximately
invariant according to autism status, age group, sex, and
level of education. Model-based reliability of the DVMSQ
total score was high, and the pattern of correlations between
the DVMSQ and other related variables strongly supported
its construct validity as a measure of misophonia severity
and impairment. Although further studies are needed to
establish the diagnostic eﬃciency (e.g., sensitivity, speciﬁcity,
and positive/negative predictive values), temporal stability, and
sensitivity-to-change of this measure, initial psychometric data
on the DVMSQ support its use as a measure of misophonia
symptoms and impairment in both general population adults
and adults on the autism spectrum. The revised DVMSQ
form is freely available for use and can be found in
Supplementary Material .
By incorporating the recent consensus deﬁnition of
misophonia (Swedo et al., 2022) into our DVMSQ-based
diagnostic algorithm, this study represents the ﬁrst attempt
to operationalize the misophonia consensus deﬁnition intoa formal set of diagnostic criteria to be applied in research
or clinical practice (Williams, 2022). Using the DVMSQ
algorithm to deﬁne misophonia caseness, the prevalence of
clinically signiﬁcant misophonia was 7.3% (102/1403) in a
sex-balanced crowdsourced sample from Proliﬁc and 35.5%
(332/936) in a female-predominant sample of independent
autistic adults recruited from the SPARK cohort. An additional
10% of each sample (i.e., 144 adults in the Proliﬁc sample
and 97 adults in the SPARK sample) met DVMSQ criteria
for “subclinical misophonia” (i.e., misophonia symptoms
above the clinical threshold but without signiﬁcant functional
impairment). Notably, these prevalence ﬁgures may be modestly
overestimated due to the selection bias of individuals with
misophonia preferentially participating in our studies, which
were advertised as being about “sensory sensitivities, ” broadly
deﬁned. Misophonia status in both general population and
autistic samples was linked to female sex, and in the
general population only, younger age and lower college
completion rates. Though the DVMSQ-derived categories
of clinical and subclinical misophonia have yet to be
validated using independent criteria (e.g., best-estimate clinical
diagnosis of misophonia based on a structured interview),

Williams et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.897901
the general-population estimates observed here are similar
to those derived in the only interview-based epidemiological
study of misophonia prevalence conducted to date (Kılıç
et al., 2021). Moreover, 29 of 31 individuals in the current
study who had previously received clinical diagnoses of
misophonia (93.5%) were ﬂagged by the DVMSQ as meeting
all misophonia symptom criteria necessary for a diagnosis,
providing further evidence to support the validity of the
screening algorithm.
This study was also the ﬁrst to examine the prevalence
and features of misophonia in a sample of autistic adults,
a clinical population that anecdotally reports high rates of
misophonia-like symptoms (Landon et al., 2016; Scheerer et al.,
2021; Williams et al., 2021c) but that has not previously been
systematically studied using validated misophonia symptom
measures. Based on the DVMSQ criteria, clinically signiﬁcant
misophonia was present in slightly over one-third of our
SPARK sample (44.2% of autistic females and 20.5% of
autistic males), a rate substantially higher than that found
in the general population Proliﬁc sample. Notably, autistic
individuals have been largely excluded from misophonia
research to date (though see Haq et al., 2021; Tonarely-
Busto et al., 2022), potentially due to prior iterations of
misophonia diagnostic criteria attempting to diﬀerentiate
misophonia from other forms of decreased sound tolerance
often observed in autism (Schröder et al., 2013; Jager et al.,
2020). Though a substantial majority of individuals with
clinically signiﬁcant misophonia are likely non-autistic (e.g.,
only 7 of 102 in our Proliﬁc sample [6.9%] reported a
formal autism diagnosis), our data demonstrate that many
autistic individuals meet full criteria for misophonia, and
that most of these individuals (around 85%) report “classic”
oronasal sounds as among their speciﬁc triggers. Furthermore,
empirical analyses of the DVMSQ found that the structure of
misophonia symptoms does not diﬀer meaningfully between
autistic and non-autistic adults, with practically ignorable
amounts of DTF between groups. These data suggest that
misophonia associated with autism is not a qualitatively
diﬀerent entity from misophonia in non-autistic individuals,
providing empirical support for the idea that misophonia
should be considered a separate diagnostic entity in autistic
individuals rather than being attributed to autism-associated
sensory reactivity (Swedo et al., 2022). Though misophonia
is likely less prevalent than hyperacusis in autistic individuals
(Williams et al., 2021e; Carson et al., 2022), both disorders
appear to contribute substantially to the overall burden of
decreased sound tolerance in the autistic population, arguably
warranting additional attention within autism research and
specialist autism clinics. As the DVMSQ is the ﬁrst measure
of misophonia symptoms and impairment validated for use
in the autistic population, autism researchers and clinicians
treating autistic adults may ﬁnd this measure particularly
useful for understanding the misophonia phenotype in autismand monitoring the success of treatments aimed at reducing
misophonia symptoms.
When examining the latent structure of the DVMSQ,
we found that the scale’s items conformed to a bifactor
structure with speciﬁc dimensions of anger/aggression,
distress/avoidance, impairment, and global impact. Notably,
the ﬁnal measurement model excluded three of the original
20 DVMSQ items, namely (a) panic or fear in response to
trigger stimuli, (b) perceptions of one’s misophonic reactions
as being excessive or unreasonable, and (c) impairment in
one’s ability to concentrate. With regard to the fear/panic
item, it is notable that this item was endorsed at substantially
lower rates than other emotional responses thought to be
more typical of misophonia (i.e., irritation/annoyance, anger,
and disgust). Furthermore, the fear/panic item was not
assigned to either symptom-related community in the EGA,
suggesting that it represented a latent construct separate from
anger/aggression and distress/avoidance. This ﬁnding is in
concordance with the large study of Jager et al. (2020), which
found that despite individuals with misophonia reporting
anticipatory anxiety surrounding triggers, none reported that
the triggers themselves evoked feelings of fear or anxiety
in the same manner that they evoked anger and/or disgust.
Although the item assessing fear/panic was removed from
the DVMSQ total score, we chose to retain it in the revised
DVMSQ questionnaire in order to capture information about
these emotions that may be relevant in deciding whether an
individual has misophonia, phonophobia, or a combination
thereof. The other two items excluded from the measurement
model were both removed from the questionnaire, as neither
was judged to contribute meaningful diagnostic information
on its own in the way that the fear/panic item does. Since
the collection of the data in the current study, the text of the
initial DVMSQ “screening” item has also been modiﬁed to
contain the following clarifying text: “ These sounds should cause
signiﬁcant emotional distress (e.g., extreme irritation, anger,
disgust, rage, anxiety, or panic). Do NOT count sounds that
bother you only because you ﬁnd them too loud or physically
painful. ” Though this version of the DVMSQ screening
question has not been empirically tested, we believe that
this clarifying text will be helpful in increasing the measure’s
speciﬁcity for misophonia (i.e., eliminating false-positive “Yes”
responses due to hyperacusis) without lowering its sensitivity
for persons with misophonia who would have otherwise
responded aﬃrmatively to that initial question. Full text of the
updated DVMSQ and scoring guidelines can be found in the
Supplementary Material .
The present study also investigated the construct validity
of the DVMSQ and its component scores by examining
correlations between these measures and (a) another
psychometrically validated misophonia questionnaire
(the DMQ), (b) measures of other forms of decreased
sound tolerance (the IHS-LOUD and DSM-SP , measuring

hyperacusis and phonophobia, respectively), (c) measures of
psychopathology and somatic symptom burden (the OASIS,
ODSIS, CUANGOS, and SSS-8), and a measure of general life
satisfaction (the RLSS). Correlations between the DMVSQ and
the DMQ-SS were exceptionally high ( rs>0.8 for the DVMSQ
total score and rs>0.7 for the symptom/impairment scores),
supporting the convergent validity of these two misophonia
severity measures in the general population (Carlson and
Herdman, 2012). Correlations with other DMQ-derived
measures, including the number of trigger categories, the
frequency of trigger exposure, and the impact on one’s life,
were lower but still in the moderate-to-large (0.4–0.65) range,
suggesting that these aspects of misophonia are separable but
related constructs. The DVMSQ also correlated with measures
of anxiety, depression, anger, and somatic symptom burden
in a way similar to our hypotheses. However, contrary to our
predictions, misophonia symptoms did not correlate more
strongly with anger than with other forms of emotional distress
or somatic symptoms. Correlations between the DVMSQ scores
and quality of life were also slightly smaller than predicted,
although all were non-zero and in the anticipated direction.
Notably, discriminant correlations between the
DVMSQ and other measures of non-misophonia decreased
sound tolerance (i.e., the IHS-LOUD and the DSM-SP)
were unexpectedly high, particularly for the DVMSQ
impairment score. Though the DVMSQ total and symptom
scores demonstrated signiﬁcantly stronger correlations
with measures of misophonia symptoms as opposed to
hyperacusis/phonophobia symptoms, this was not the case for
the DVMSQ impairment score, which shared similar amounts
of variance with the measures of misophonia, hyperacusis,
and phonophobia symptoms. This ﬁnding suggests that the
“misophonia-related impairment” domain of the DVMSQ
likely measures more general impairment due to all types
of decreased sound tolerance. Although the diﬀerential
correlations between measures of decreased sound tolerance
do provide some evidence of discriminant validity for the
DVMSQ total and symptom scores, measures of “misophonia
symptoms” in the general population may potentially be
substantially confounded by other forms of decreased sound
tolerance such as hyperacusis or phonophobia. Given these
results, we strongly recommend that all putative measures
of misophonia or other sound tolerance disorder symptoms
be demonstrated to correlate more strongly with other
measures of the same symptom domain than with measures
of phenomenologically diﬀerent symptoms. Otherwise,
research on misophonia risks conﬂating misophonia with
more broadly deﬁned decreased sound tolerance, potentially
leading to incorrect conclusions about the most eﬀective
diagnostic/screening methods for misophonia or the overlap
of misophonia with other sound tolerance disorders such as
hyperacusis and phonophobia. Future research is, therefore,
much needed to determine the most appropriate ways topsychometrically distinguish diﬀerent forms of decreased
sound tolerance from one another, particularly when using
self-report questionnaires.
This investigation has a number of strengths, including a
large and diverse sample of autistic and non-autistic adults;
rigorous data-quality checks to ensure valid survey responses;
clinical characterization that included additional measures
of misophonia, hyperacusis, phonophobia, psychopathology,
and somatic symptoms; conﬁrmation of dimensionality with
established and novel methods; sophisticated bifactor latent
variable models with out-of-sample model ﬁt assessment;
and robust tests of diﬀerential item and test functioning
across multiple subpopulations. However, it is not without
limitations. Most notably, there was no interview-based “gold-
standard” used to determine misophonia status, and we
were therefore unable to report on the criterion-related
validity or diagnostic eﬃciency (e.g., sensitivity, speciﬁcity,
positive/negative predictive values) of the DVMSQ diagnostic
algorithm in either sample. Future work is, thus, necessary
to determine whether the DVMSQ algorithm is calibrated
appropriately to screen for misophonia that rises to the level of
clinical signiﬁcance as judged by a trained clinician interviewer.
In addition, the consensus deﬁnition-based diagnostic criteria
used by our team were created after DVMSQ data were
collected; consequently, the DVMSQ did not encompass all
aspects of the condition mentioned in the consensus deﬁnition
(e.g., “indirect” forms of avoidance such as altering others’
“triggering” behavior; Cowan et al., 2022). Future versions of the
DVMSQ and other criterion-based misophonia screening tools
should, therefore, be developed to fully capture the features of
misophonia as reﬂected in the current diagnostic criteria or any
more rigorously developed consensus criteria that are proposed
in the literature. Another limitation of the current study was
its cross-sectional design, as this precluded any analyses of the
test-retest reliability of the DVMSQ total or subscale scores,
the temporal stability of DVMSQ misophonia classiﬁcation,
or assessment of DIF across multiple administrations. As
such, additional studies are needed to assess these properties
of the measure, particularly if researchers are interested
in using the DVMSQ to quantify change in misophonia
symptoms due to treatments such as cognitive-behavioral
therapy (Jager et al., 2021) or pharmacological interventions
(Webb, 2022). Additional IRT-based psychometric analyses,
such as determining the level of latent misophonia severity
that can be measured precisely by the DVMSQ and validating
scoring algorithms that diﬀerentially weight each item from the
measure represent worthwhile future directions. Finally, despite
promising data in the general population and independent
autistic adults, the DVMSQ has not yet been validated for use in
adolescents, autistic adults with intellectual disabilities, or other
clinical populations of interest, and further research is warranted
to determine whether this measure is appropriate to assess
misophonia in these groups. In particular, given the frequent

onset of misophonia symptoms in childhood or adolescence
(Potgieter et al., 2019), there is a great need for screening tools
in this age range, and we believe the readability of the DVMSQ
makes it a strong candidate measure for potential further testing
in younger age groups. Independent replication of the latent
structure of the revised DVMSQ in general-population datasets
would also be informative regarding the structure of the items
in the context of the new screening item clariﬁcation text and
the removal of two additional Likert items from the original
scale.
Conclusion
The DVMSQ is a novel self-report measure of misophonia
symptoms and associated functional impairment designed
to capture the core aspects of this disorder and to assign
misophonia caseness according to a theory-based diagnostic
algorithm. Based on initial psychometric testing of the DVMSQ
in over 2,000 adult participants, the measure demonstrates
a robust and replicable latent structure, adequate reliability
and construct validity, and practically ignorable diﬀerential
item and test functioning between autistic and non-autistic
adults. The DVMSQ total score can be used as a global
summary measure of misophonia symptoms and impairment,
and separate symptom and impairment subscale scores are also
available to investigate these two aspects of the misophonia
construct. Despite encouraging preliminary psychometric data,
further research is needed to independently validate these
ﬁndings and extend them to other measurement properties (e.g.,
test-retest reliability and diagnostic eﬃciency) and respondent
populations (e.g., adolescents, individuals with intellectual
disability). However, in light of these initial data, we believe
that the DVMSQ represents a promising measure of misophonia
for use in research and clinical practice, particularly when
assessing the features of misophonia seen in adults on the
autism spectrum. As the ﬁeld of misophonia research is
rapidly growing and changing, additional revisions of this
scale will undoubtedly be necessary as the very deﬁnition of
misophonia is revised and updated to more accurately capture
the lived experiences of individuals with this poorly understood
disorder.
