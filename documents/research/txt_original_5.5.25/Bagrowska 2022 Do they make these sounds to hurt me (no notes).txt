Misophonia is a complex syndrome in which selective auditory stimuli, such as sounds of breathing, sniffing or 
eating, trigger an intense, negative emotional response. Previous studies have shown that the symptoms of 
misophonia coexist with a number of mental disorders, such as OCD, depression and anxiety. However, still little 
is known about other mental states that may be present in this context. A total of 312 people from the non- 
clinical sample participated in an online correlational study, which aimed at investigating whether there is a 
significant association between misophonia symptoms and paranoia-like thoughts, as well as to examine what 
factors might underlie this potential relationship. The results revealed that misophonia positively correlates with 
paranoia-like thoughts. A serial mediation analysis showed that difficulties in regulating emotions, anxiety and 
hostile attributions are significant mediators in the relationship between misophonia and paranoia-like thoughts. 
Importantly, these mediators, above all, form a potential coherent explanatory mechanism underlying this as-
sociation. Hence, our results highlight the important role of socio-cognitive factors in the conceptualization of 
misophonia and its relation to paranoia-like thoughts.   
1.Introduction 
Misophonia (“hatred of sounds ”), first described by Jastreboff and 
Jastreboff (2001) , is a fairly new, complex neurophysiological and 
behavioral syndrome (Ferrer-Torres and Gim˘enez-Llort, 2022 ), where a 
range of selective auditory stimuli (mainly sounds made by other peo-
ple) cause an intense, negative and unbearable emotional reaction in the 
individual. In response to specific stimuli (called “triggering ” or 
“misophonic ” sounds), such as nasal (e.g., breathing, sniffing) or eating 
sounds (e.g., chewing) (Vitoratou et al., 2021 ), a person manifests a 
strong physical (e.g., increased heart rate) (Ferrer-Torres and Gim˘enez- 
Llort, 2021 ) and/or unpleasant emotional reaction (e.g., anger, anxiety, 
disgust, avoidance or hatred) (Brout et al., 2018 ). Although misophonia 
is not formally classified as a psychiatric disorder as there are still 
insufficient diagnostic criteria to formulate such a diagnosis (Ferrer- 
Torres and Gim˘enez-Llort, 2022 ), a recent review suggests that “miso-
phonia, or some syndrome in which misophonia is a key feature, may 
represent a new mental disorder ” (Taylor, 2017 ). Recent studies have 
shown that misophonia is associated with reduced life quality, comor -
bidity, high intensity of negative emotions, as well as behaviors that may affect interpersonal relationships in the long term (Claiborn et al., 
2020 ). 
It has been hypothesized that misophonic responses are both bio-
logical and shaped by environmental influences (Brout et al., 2018 ). The 
existing literature emphasizes that misophonia is activated in response 
to a specific context rather than to a given sound itself (Edelstein et al., 
2013 ). For instance, it has been shown that misophonia symptoms evoke 
a more negative emotional reaction when a particular sound is made by 
a family member or a close friend (Edelstein et al., 2013 ). Avoiding 
triggering situations (i.e., safety behaviors; as proven common in 
misophonia), while initially preventing exposure and cue-related 
distress, can often result in social withdrawal, and thus significantly 
impact daily and interpersonal functioning (Jager et al., 2020 ). 
Although avoidance and escape strategies are most commonly reported 
in misophonia, approach-oriented behaviors, such as confronting others 
or adopting a hostile attitude, are also being noted (Schadegg et al., 
2021 ). A recent qualitative study found that individuals suffering from 
misophonia perceived that other people purposely emit these triggering 
sounds “to underline their maladaptive interpersonal schemas ” (Natalini 
et al., 2020 ). Moreover, it has been shown that when a person thinks

138other people are intentionally making the triggering sounds, an even 
more intense negative emotional response takes place (Reid et al., 2016 ; 
Natalini et al., 2020 ). Therefore, assigning hostile intentions to other 
people seems not only to occur, but also to exacerbate the symptoms of 
misophonia. 
One of the most extreme states associated with high levels of dis-
turbing thoughts that someone has hostile intentions and is deliberately 
trying to hurt the person is called paranoia (Freeman et al., 2005 ). Ac-
cording to the hierarchy of paranoia (Freeman et al., 2005 ) and the 
existing theoretical models of delusions (Freeman et al., 2002 ), 
paranoia-like thoughts can be (among others) built on or triggered by a 
constant stress, continual anxiety or social concerns, including feelings 
of vulnerability and worrisome thoughts that the world (or other people) 
could be potentially dangerous. Recent studies have shown that the 
presence of a hostile attribution bias (the tendency to interpret the ac-
tions of others as intentional and hostile rather than accidental or 
benevolent intention) is related to paranoia and may also act as a sig-
nificant predictor of paranoid thoughts (Buck et al., 2020 ; Combs et al., 
2007 ). While the symptoms of misophonia have been found to be 
associated or coexisting with a number of other psychiatric disorders 
such as anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or 
eating disorders (Ferrer-Torres and Gim˘enez-Llort, 2022 ), they have 
never been, to the best of our knowledge, investigated in the context of 
paranoia-like thoughts, which are fairly common in the general popu -
lation (Freeman et al., 2011 ). 
Since negative emotional states (including anxiety), difficulties in 
regulating emotions and assigning hostile intentions to other people turn 
out to be significant correlates of misophonia (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 
2020 ; Reid et al., 2016 ), and are also significant predictors of paranoia- 
like thoughts (Buck et al., 2020 ; Westermann et al., 2013 ), they share a 
common theoretical background. As the suffering associated with the 
symptoms of misophonia concerns the presence of selective sounds 
(often, these are everyday sounds that cannot be easily avoided without 
being completely isolated from other people, i.e. breathing or eating 
sounds, especially made by people in the closest environment), people 
suffering from misophonia live in a state of constant, extreme stress 
which can make them feel vulnerable to harm in the long term. 
Vulnerability, on the other hand, is thought to be the foundation upon 
which paranoia-like thoughts are built (Freeman et al., 2005 ). There -
fore, it is crucial to examine whether these two distressing mental states 
are interrelated and to understand the potential mechanisms underlying 
this association. 
Safety behaviors (such as avoidance or escape) undertaken to avoid 
triggering stimuli associated with misophonia can maintain its symp -
toms and lead to difficulties in coping or regulating emotions over time 
(Guetta et al., 2022 ). Emotion regulation is defined by strategies and the 
ability to monitor, evaluate and modify one's emotional reaction, mainly 
in terms of its intense and temporal characteristics (Thompson, 1994 ). 
Difficulties in regulating (i.e. identifying, understanding, or modulating) 
emotions, can lead, however, to many negative outcomes (Bjureberg 
et al., 2016 ). Recent studies have shown that difficulties in regulating 
emotions are associated with increased symptoms of misophonia (Cas-
siello-Robbins et al., 2020 ; Guetta et al., 2022 ). Escape or avoidance 
behaviors, as emotion regulation or prevention strategies, in response to 
triggering stimuli can amplify the negative emotional response and, in 
turn, lead to increased anxiety and distress. This is also in line with 
another theoretical model in which emotion regulation plays an 
important role in the etiology of anxiety disorders (Cisler et al., 2010 ). 
An elevated anxiety, on the other hand, has been found to be associated 
with increased hostility (Hertsgaard and Light, 1984 ; Tellawi et al., 
2016 ). 
Hence, the purpose of this study was to investigate, for the very first 
time, whether there is an association between misophonia symptoms 
and paranoia-like thoughts in a non-clinical sample. In the next step, we 
intended to propose a theoretical model that could explain this potential 
relationship and open the door to further experimental research on this phenomenon in the future. Therefore, we created and tested an 
exploratory, serial mediation model in which the relationship between 
misophonia and paranoia-like thoughts is mediated by emotion regu-
lation, anxiety and hostile attributions. People experiencing misophonia 
symptoms have difficulty regulating their own negative emotions caused 
by, e.g. misophonic sounds. This, in turn, can further elevate their 
anxiety levels, leading to the attribution of hostile intentions to those 
making the triggering sounds (i.e. assuming they are making the sounds 
on purpose). This, if left untreated and not employing adaptive coping 
strategies, can further turn into increased levels of paranoia-like 
thoughts and a generalization of these hostile attributions by assuming 
that other people may want to intentionally hurt them (making sounds 
that are triggering or in another way). In this article, we will attempt to 
verify this exploratory, theoretical hypothesis. 
2.Methods 
2.1. Participants 
The sampling method used in this study was a convenience sample. 
As this study was part of another, larger project, it was addressed to 
adults aged 18 to 40 years, which was the main inclusion criterion 
employed. Participants were recruited online through social media 
advertising and the “snowball method ”. The online advertisement con-
tained a link redirecting to the target survey, which was placed on the 
Qualtrics platform. The participant's task was to answer all the survey 
questions. A total of 312 subjects (64.7 % female) signed an online 
consent form and took part in the online study which was approved by 
the local ethics committee and was conducted in accordance with the 
latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
2.2. Measures 
Green Paranoid Thoughts Scale - Revised (R-GPTS) (Freeman et al., 
2021 ) is a self-report 18 item-scale that measures the level of paranoia- 
like thoughts (based on last month's experiences) on two subscales – 
ideas of reference and ideas of persecution. The total score can range 
from 0 to 72, where higher scores indicate higher levels of paranoia-like 
thoughts. Cronbach's alpha for this scale in our study was 0.93. 
MisoQuest – A questionnaire for assessing decreased sound tolerance 
(Siepsiak et al., 2020a, 2020b ) is a newly developed self-report ques-
tionnaire for measuring the severity of misophonia symptoms based on 
the last month's experiences. It contains 14 items loaded into one factor. 
The total score can range from 14 to 70, with higher scores indicating 
higher levels of misophonia symptoms. A clinical cut-off point was 
proposed for 61 of 70 points. Cronbach's alpha in our study was 0.95. 
Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) (Gratz and Roemer, 
2004 ) measures the level of emotion regulation problems on a 36-item 
self-report scale. The total score ranges from 36 to 180, where the 
higher scores indicate greater difficulties with emotion regulation. 
Cronbach's alpha for this scale in our study was 0.96. 
The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ) (Combs et al., 
2007 ) measures hostile social-cognitive biases. In this scale, participants 
are presented with five written vignettes that describe ambiguous social 
situations. After each scenario, the participant is asked to complete a 
self-report scale regarding intention, blameworthiness and own anger 
towards the person(s) in response to the given situation. Participants are 
also asked to answer two open-ended questions about their interpreta -
tion of the person's motives and how they would react to the situation. 
The self-report items, when added together, form a “blame score. ” Open- 
ended questions are scored by an independent scorer and form two other 
subscales: “hostility bias” and “aggression bias”. We only use a “blame 
score ” in our study, which has been shown to have a good internal 
consistency among both schizophrenia patients and controls, as well as 
to be related to clinically-rated hostility and suspiciousness (Buck et al., 
2017 ). The total score can range from 5 to 80, with higher scores P. Bagrowska et al.

Schizophrenia Research 250 (2022) 137–142
139indicating an increased tendency to perceive the intentions of others as 
hostile. Polish version of the scale was used (Zajenkowska et al., 2020 ). 
Cronbach's alpha for this scale in our study was 0.89. 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) (Spitzer et al., 2006 ) is a 7- 
item self-report scale measuring the severity of generalized anxiety 
symptoms. The total score ranges from 0 to 21, where higher scores 
indicate higher levels of generalized anxiety. Cronbach's alpha for this 
scale in our study was 0.91. 
2.3. Statistical analyses 
Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS 27. Two tailed Pearson's 
correlation analyses were conducted to explore the relationships be-
tween paranoia-like thoughts, misophonia symptoms, emotion regula -
tion, hostile attributions and anxiety. Student's t-test was used to test 
group differences (participants with and without diagnosis of mental 
disorders) in misophonia symptoms and paranoia-like thoughts. The 
one-way ANOVA was used to explore the differences in misophonia 
symptoms and paranoia-like thoughts between genders. Serial media -
tion analysis carried out using the model 6 in the PROCESS macro 
(Preacher and Hayes, 2004 ), following the bootstrapping procedure 
with 5000 resample, was performed to investigate the mediating effect 
of emotion regulation, anxiety and hostile attributions in the relation -
ship between misophonia symptoms and paranoia-like thoughts. Due to 
the relatively high percentage of people who declared having a diagnosis 
of mental disorders in their lifetime (30.4 %), and also due to a signif -
icantly higher proportion of women (64.7 %) than men (33.3 %) in the 
sample, both the diagnosis and gender were added as covariates to the 
mediation model. 
3.Results 
Sample characteristics can be found in Table 1. A post-hoc power 
analysis, with a sample size of 312 and alpha level set to p D0.05, was 
performed using G*Power3 (Faul et al., 2007 ). The post hoc analysis 
revealed a power of 0.82, indicating adequate sample power for this 
study. The mean value of misophonia in our sample was 30.81 (SD 
13.65), which indicates slightly lower (yet comparable) results than in 
case of healthy subjects (M 35.32, SD 12.67) in another study using 
the same scale (Siepsiak et al., 2022 ). 
The results of the correlation analyses are presented in Table 2. 
Significant correlations were found between all studied variables. 
Misophonia was positively correlated with paranoia-like thoughts (r 
0.497, p D0.001), which means that the higher the intensity of miso-
phonia symptoms the higher the level of paranoia-like thoughts. 
3.1. Serial mediation analysis 
Fig. 1 presents the results of the serial mediation analysis. The pur-
pose of this analysis was to investigate the role of difficulties in emotion 
regulation, anxiety and hostile attributions in the relationship between 
misophonia and paranoia-like thoughts. 
The results revealed that the standardized total effect of misophonia 
on paranoia-like thoughts significantly differed from zero (β 0.504, 95 
% CI 0.352 to 0.521, p D0.001). The direct effect of misophonia on 
paranoia-like thoughts also was significant (β 0.309, 95 % CI 0.185 
to 0.349, p D0.001), which means that the mediation is complementary. 
The total standardized indirect effect was significant (β 0.196, 95 % 
CI 0.135 to 0.261), with a significant serial mediation effect being 
observed from misophonia via emotion regulation, anxiety and hostile 
attributions to paranoia-like thoughts (β 0.01, 95 % CI 0.001 to 
0.016). All the other indirect pathways from misophonia to paranoia- 
like thoughts were also significant: via emotion regulation only (β 
0.053, 95 % CI 0.012 to 0.1), via anxiety only (β 0.041, 95 % CI 
0.01 to 0.079), via hostile attributions only (β 0.031, 95 % CI 0.01 to 
0.06), via emotion regulation and anxiety (β 0.042, 95 % CI 0.01 to Table 1

CI 0.004 to 0.033) as well as via anxiety and hostile attributions (β 
0.01, 95 % CI 0.001 to 0.016). The total effect explained 26.81 % of 
the variance in paranoia-like thoughts, and the mediated model 
explained 44.27 % of the variance. Gender (p D0.05) and lifetime 
diagnosis of psychiatric disorders (p F0.05) were included as covariates 
in the model. 
The independent samples t-tests revealed no significant difference in 
both the level of misophonia symptoms (p 0.312) and in the level of 
paranoia-like thoughts (p 0.127) between people who declared having 
a diagnosis of mental disorders at some point in their lifetime and people 
without a diagnosis. The one-way ANOVA showed no significant dif-
ference in the level of paranoia-like thoughts between the genders (p 
0.112), but did show a significant difference in the level of misophonia 
symptoms (p 0.04). Post-hoc analysis revealed a greater (at the trend 
level, p 0.06) severity of misophonia in women (M 31.99, SD 
13.81) than in men (M 28.18, SD 12.8). The differences between 
women/men and people who stated their gender as “other ” were not 
significant. 
4.Discussion 
Misophonia has appeared in the psychological and psychiatric 
literature only recently. Nevertheless, it has already gained enormous 
interest from researchers in various fields. While the subject is still being 
extensively studied, much has already been established. For instance, we 
already know that the symptoms of misophonia coexist with a number of 
other mental disorders, such as OCD, ADHD, depression or anxiety 
(Potgieter et al., 2019 ; Ferrer-Torres and Gim˘enez-Llort, 2022 ; Siepsiak 
and Dragan, 2019 ). However, still little is known about different mental 
conditions that may be related to misophonia severity. In this study, we 
aimed to investigate whether there is an association between misopho -
nia symptoms and paranoia-like thoughts in a non-clinical sample, and if 
so, what are the possible factors underlying this relationship. 
First of all, in line with the results of previous studies, we show that 
the symptoms of misophonia positively correlate with difficulties in 
emotion regulation (e.g., Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ; Guetta et al., 
2022 ) and increased levels of anxiety (e.g., Siepsiak et al., 2020a, 
2020b ). Moreover, a significant positive correlation was found with hostile attributions measured with a validated scale (Combs et al., 
2007 ), which is in congruence with the existing qualitative case study 
data (Reid et al., 2016 ; Natalini et al., 2020 ) on attributing hostile in-
tentions to people making triggering sounds by the misophonia suf-
ferers. Hence, these results highlight the important role of the cognitive- 
emotional aspects in the conceptualization of misophonia. 
What is particularly important and what was the main research 
question of our study, the results revealed that misophonia is positively 
correlated with paranoia-like thoughts. Moreover, we found that diffi-
culties in regulating emotions, anxiety, and hostile attributions are not 
only significant mediators of the relationship between misophonia and 
paranoia-like thoughts, but, most of all, form a coherent explanatory 
mechanism underlying this association. Namely, based on our findings 
we may hypothesize that people experiencing misophonia symptoms 
have difficulties in regulating their negative emotions caused by the 
presence of intolerable misophonic sounds. Further, due to the lack of 
effective emotion regulation strategies, these negative emotional states 
associated with hatred sounds may be exaggerated. Indeed, the inability 
to deal with unpleasant emotions can contribute to an increase in overall 
anxiety (Cisler et al., 2010 ). The consequence of this may be adopting 
defensive strategies in the form of hostile attitude towards people who 
may intentionally emit the triggering sounds. Attributing hostile in-
tentions to other people in this particular situation, which is presumably 
associated with an elevated level of anxiety, can further develop into 
more intense and generalized thoughts that other people may inten -
tionally want to hurt them, e.g. emitting the triggering sounds or in 
another threatening way. The negative emotional states associated with 
the presence of misophonic sounds makes the person more vulnerable to 
harm, as triggers, frequently being an inseparable part of everyday so-
cial functioning, are often inevitable. Vulnerability, in turn, is the basis 
upon which paranoia-like thoughts are built (Freeman et al., 2005 ), 
hence supporting our inference. 
Nevertheless, although the directional model was tested, the data on 
which we built this theoretical hypothesis and our line of reasoning, is 
correlational, which means that no cause-and-effect conclusions can be 
drawn. Although this model turned out to be significant, it can be 
assumed that the relationships between these variables are bidirec -
tional, and their order in the mediation model may change and take the 
form of a feedback loop mechanism. Moreover, the results of our study

141showed that the mediation was complementary, which may indicate 
that misophonia symptoms directly (apart from the mediating role of 
emotion regulation, anxiety and hostile attributions) affect paranoia- 
like thoughts or that there are other mediators of this relationship, 
that were not included in our model. Our study was the very first step 
towards better understanding the relation between misophonia and 
paranoia-like thoughts and its mechanisms. The correlational nature of 
the study, however, can be considered as a limitation. Hence, further 
research, especially using experimental or longitudinal methods, which 
would allow establishing the causality of this association, as well as 
applying structured clinical interviews, is warranted. 
Our findings also revealed significant (at the trend level) differences 
between the genders in the misophonia symptoms severity. In line with 
previous studies (Erfanian et al., 2019 ; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ), 
misophonia seemed to affect women more than men. However, the 
existing research regarding the role of gender in misophonia is incon -
sistent. A very recent study (Savard et al., 2022 ) revealed that miso-
phonia did not differ between men and women, but additional analysis 
showed that one item on the misophonia questionnaire appeared to 
differentiate between the sexes and referred to the physiological 
component of emotions. However, it has not been proven to be specific 
to misophonia, as men and women typically differ in their self-reported 
responses to negative emotional stimuli, which is not necessarily re-
flected in their physiological responses (Pol˘a¯ckov ˘a ¯Solcov ˘a and La¯cev, 
2017 ). Future research aimed directly at gender differences in the 
context of misophonia is then needed. 
We intended to conduct the study on a non-clinical sample, as it was 
found that both paranoia-like thoughts (Freeman et al., 2011 ) and 
misophonia symptoms (Wu et al., 2014 ; Kılıç et al., 2021 ) are, to some 
extent, prevalent in the general non-clinical population. However, a 
relatively large percentage (30.4 %) of the respondents participating in 
the study declared that they had some kind of psychiatric diagnosis in 
their lifetime, mainly depression (21.8 %) and anxiety (14.7 %). These 
numbers are also in line with a very recent meta-analysis (Chekole and 
Abate, 2021 ) which showed that the prevalence of anxiety and depres -
sion (mostly reported diagnoses in our study) is estimated at 33.59 % 
and 29.98 %, respectively. Nevertheless, the presence of the declared 
diagnosis was added as a covariate to the mediation analysis to limit the 
potential impact of the diagnosis on the results. However, the effects 
remained significant, suggesting that both paranoia-like thoughts and 
misophonia symptoms may appear and coexist in a healthy population, 
contributing to elevated stress levels and becoming a risk factor for more 
severe psychological symptoms if left untreated. 
Even though our study was conducted primarily on a non-clinical 
sample, we can cautiously assume that our results may have potential 
clinical implications. If replicated in clinical samples, moderate re-
lationships between paranoia-like thoughts and misophonia may sug-
gest that hatred sounds emitted by other people are a source of 
significant distress and exaggerated safety behaviors (e.g., social with-
drawal) complicating both symptoms of paranoia as well as misophonia. 
Furthermore, misophonia, as associated with interpersonal context, may 
be additional factor increasing emotional dysregulation associated with 
paranoia. To our best knowledge, the relationship between misophonia 
and paranoia or psychosis in general, was not considered in the existing 
therapy protocols. Although there are no proven psychological therapy 
protocols for treating misophonia symptoms as yet, cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) is considered to be a promising and effective treatment 
for misophonia (Ferrer-Torres and Gim˘enez-Llort, 2022 ). Further 
research on clinical samples is warranted to explore the potential role of 
misophonia in clinical paranoia or psychosis in general, as well as in 
relation to other psychotic-like experiences, e.g. auditory hallucinations. 
Another direction for future research may be to investigate sensory 
gating (brain processes engaged to selectively filter irrelevant sensory 
stimuli) as a potential common ground factor in the link between 
misophonia and psychosis, as it has been shown that sensory gating can 
be impaired in both syndromes (Brout et al., 2018 ; Shen et al., 2020 ). To conclude, the results of our study enriched the existing literature 
with an additional factor playing a role in the conceptualization of 
misophonia, i.e. paranoia-like thoughts. Moreover, we proposed an 
exploratory model that describes a potential coherent mechanism un-
derlying the relationship between misophonia symptoms and paranoia- 
like thoughts. Namely, we highlighted the role of difficulties in emotion 
regulation, anxiety, and hostile attributions as significant mediators, 
which collectively emphasize the key role of socio-cognitive factors in 
misophonia. Hence, our findings suggest that misophonia is significantly 
related to interpersonal trust and at least partially cognitive and 
emotional processes play a role in shaping this relation.
