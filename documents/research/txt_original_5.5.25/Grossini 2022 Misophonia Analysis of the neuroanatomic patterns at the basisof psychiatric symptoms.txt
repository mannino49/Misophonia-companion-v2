Background/Aim: Misophonia is a disorder characterized by reduced
tolerance to speciﬁc sounds or stimuli known as “triggers,” which tend to
evoke negative emotional, physiological, and behavioral responses. In this
study, we aimed to better characterize participants with misophonia through
the evaluation of the response of the autonomic nervous system to “trigger
sounds,” a psychometric assessment, and the analysis of the neurological
pathways.
Materials and methods: Participants included 11 adults presenting with
misophonic disturbance and 44 sex-matched healthy controls (HCs).
Following recently proposed diagnostic criteria, the participants listened to six
“trigger sounds” and a “general annoyance” sound (baby crying) during a series
of physiological tests. The effects were examined through functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI), the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV), and of
galvanic skin conductance (GSC). The fMRI was performed on a 3T Scanner.
The HRV was obtained through the analysis of electrocardiogram, whereas the
GSC was examined through the positioning of silver-chloride electrodes on
ﬁngers. Furthermore, the psychometric assessment included questionnaires
focused on misophonia, psychopathology, resilience, anger, and motivation.
Results: Participants with misophonia showed patterns of increased
sympathetic activation in response to trigger sounds and a general annoyance
sound, the low frequency (LF) component of HRV, the sympathetic index, and

the number of signiﬁcant GSC over the threshold, where the amplitude/phasic
response of GSC was higher. The fMRI analysis provided evidence for
the activation of the temporal cortex, the limbic area, the ventromedial
prefrontal/premotor/cingulate cortex, and the cerebellum in participants with
misophonia. In addition, the psychometric assessment seemed to differentiate
misophonia as a construct independent from general psychopathology.
Conclusion: These results suggest the activation of a speciﬁc auditory-
insula-limbic pathway at the basis of the sympathetic activation observed in
participants with misophonia in response to “trigger and general annoyance
sounds.” Further studies should disentangle the complex issue of whether
misophonia represents a new clinical disorder or a non-pathological
condition. These results could help to build diagnostic tests to recognize
and better classify this disorder. The relevance of this question goes beyond
purely theoretical issues, as in the ﬁrst case, participants with misophonia
should receive a diagnosis and a targeted treatment, while in the second case,
they should not.

Introduction
The recent consensus work of experts has led to the
deﬁnition of misophonia as a reduced tolerance to speciﬁc
sounds or stimuli related to them (Ferrer-Torres and Giménez-
Llort, 2022). These “trigger” stimuli can generate strong
negative emotional, physiological, and behavioral reactions
that are not commonly observed by the majority of people
(Sweedo et al., 2022). For individuals with misophonia, it is
diﬃcult to distract themselves from trigger sounds, and they
may experience a range of unpleasant consequences, such as
suﬀering, distress, overall functioning impairment, and mental
health problems. In individuals suﬀering from misophonia,
symptoms should not be better explained by any co-occurring
disorder, including psychiatric conditions or disorders, such
as anxiety disorders, mood disorders, personality disorders,
obsessive, compulsive related disorders, post-traumatic stress
disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deﬁcit
hyperactivity disorder.
Past studies showed that subjects with misophonia can
exhibit a wide range of “triggers” (Daniels et al., 2020; Jager
et al., 2020a), which can be diﬀerent from one subject to another.
Although each person can have his/her own “trigger” stimuli,
there are some that, more than others, can better serve as
“misophonic triggers.” In particular, sounds associated with oral
functions like chewing, eating, and swallowing are the most
often reported as misophonic triggers. Also, sounds producedby other people, such as pen clicking, keyboard typing, ﬁnger or
foot tapping, and shuﬄing footsteps often serve as “triggers.”
In response to those “trigger” stimuli, individuals with
misophonia may experience anger, irritation, anxiety, and
aggressive impulses, as well as symptoms related to autonomic
nervous system activation, such as motor tics and increased
heart rate (Edelstein et al., 2013; Webber et al., 2014; Palumbo
et al., 2018). In addition, patients often develop coping
mechanisms, such as avoiding social situations in which the
trigger stimuli might occur (Schröder et al., 2013; Taylor et al.,
2014; Potgieter et al., 2019). To date, it has been clariﬁed
that misophonia is an aﬀective auditory processing disorder
(Edelstein et al., 2013; Erfanian et al., 2017; Kumar et al.,
2017) associated with an increased number of connections, or
strength of connections, between the limbic and sympathetic
nervous systems, which can cause abnormal processing of sound
stimuli. In participants with misophonia, increased functional
connectivity within brain regions like the anterior insular
cortex (AIC), the anterior cingulate cortex, the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex, the posteromedial cortex (posterior cingulate
and retrosplenial cortex), the hippocampus, and the amygdala
(Kumar et al., 2017) could reﬂect abnormal salience attribution
to misophonic stimuli (Schröder et al., 2019; Seeley, 2019). In
particular, it is noteworthy that the ventromedial prefrontal
cortex and posteromedial cortex are core parts of the default
mode network (DMN) (Raichle et al., 2001), which are
connected to AIC and are activated when subjects are engaged

in internally directed thoughts and retrieval of memories
(Huijbers et al., 2011).
Repeated exposure to the same cues will amplify the salience
network activity. The causal mechanism of this phenomenon
reﬂects a conditioned response in which the initially neutral
stimulus is increasingly associated with intensiﬁed aversive
emotions and augmented by increased vigilance (Schröder et al.,
2019). Among those areas, the anterior cingulate cortex and
insular activity have been linked to increased cardiovascular
arousal (Critchley, 2005). This statement was conﬁrmed by
the study of Kumar et al. (2017), which showed that the
augmented heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response by
“trigger sounds” were mediated by the activity of AIC in
participants with misophonia.
Therefore, the nervous structures mentioned above could
represent the anatomical basis of the symptoms related to the
activation of the autonomic nervous system that characterizes
misophonia and could explain the visceral responses associated
with emotions (Schwartz et al., 1981).
Recently, increased connectivity between both the auditory
and the visual cortex, and between those brain regions and
the ventral premotor cortex, has been reported in response to
trigger sounds in subjects with misophonia (Kumar et al., 2021).
This is of interest as the ventral premotor cortex is responsible
for orofacial movement (Grabski et al., 2012). These ﬁndings
support a model of misophonia based on “hyper-mirroring”
according to which sounds would be the “medium” through
which actions of other people are excessively mirrored.
Although knowledge about misophonia has increased, a
complete analysis of the neuropsychiatric features, of the
autonomic nervous system activation and of the neuronal
pathways in participants with misophonia (Sweedo et al., 2022)
in response to “trigger” sounds, is still lacking. In particular,
previous studies have focused either on only one of the
aspects mentioned above or have only partially investigated the
activation of the autonomic nervous system by recording a few
parameters related to the orthosympathetic/parasympathetic
nervous system. Furthermore, the sample size calculation
was not performed.
In the present study, we aimed to better characterize
misophonia through the integrated evaluation of the
physiologic, psychiatric, and neurological correlates in response
to a trigger sound protocol in participants with misophonia.
In particular, our primary endpoint was the analysis of
the orthosympathetic/parasympathetic balance during the
application of six “trigger sounds” and one “general annoyance”
sound. To reach our primary endpoint, the sample size was
calculated on the basis of previously reported tests related
to the activation of the orthosympathetic nervous system in
participants with misophonia. The data obtained in the present
study were correlated with the psychometric assessment and
the anatomic pathways activated during the trigger sounds
protocol, which was investigated through functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI).Materials and methods
We performed a double-blind case-control study by
comparing subjects complaining of misophonic disturbances
(participants with misophonia, N= 11) to gender-matched
healthy controls (HCs) (N = 44) on the following variables:
the fMRI, the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV), galvanic
skin conductance (GSC), and psychiatric assessment. The
study was approved by the local Ethical Committee, Azienda
Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carità, Novara (CE
81/18). Participant recruitment took place from April 2018 to
January 2020; subjects (or their legal representatives) were asked
to sign a written informed consent and were treated according to
Good Clinical Practice principles (Declaration of Helsinki: 2013).
The participants with misophonia were recruited from the
community through the online misophonia support group
(Misofonia Italia in Facebook). The HCs were recruited through
local advertisements. The recruitment of the participants was
carried out through an interview conducted according to the
model proposed by Sanchez and da Silva (Schröder et al., 2013;
Sanchez and da Silva, 2018). The selection was executed by an
experienced psychiatrist.
Other potentially comorbid medical conditions were
investigated as well.
Inclusion criteria were as follows: age 14 years, presence of
at least one misophonic symptom, and written informed consent
by each subject or parents.
Exclusion criteria were as follows: diagnosis
of cardiac or neurologic disease, diabetes,
intellectual disability/dementia/cognitive impairment,
autoimmune/inﬂammatory diseases, pregnancy, use of
medications, such as aorbblockers, diuretics, calcium
channels blockers, smoking habits (>1 cigarette day),
use of alcohol/psychoactive substances, unwillingness to
participate and/or to sign the written informed consent.
Participants were recruited based on the evidence of near-
normal hearing as documented from previous visits relating to
occupational medicine.
The participants with misophonia and HCs were
instructed to abstain from caﬀeinated beverages for 24 h
and from moderate or strenuous physical activity for 48 h
before the analyses.
Trigger sounds protocol
Before beginning the study, the subjects were given a
detailed explanation of the experimental procedures. They were
instructed to fast for at least 3 h before the beginning of the
experiment and all the evaluations were conducted from 9
a.m. to 1.30 p.m. All the participants underwent a rest period
lasting 15 min before the start of the procedures (psychometric
assessment, HRV , GSC, and fMRI analysis), in a quiet room
with a controlled temperature between 26 and 27C. We have

Grossini et al. 10.3389/fnins.2022.827998
chosen this temperature because it is the one that is reported
to be the most comfortable for patients subjected to HRV
analysis (Liu et al., 2008). In addition, the results of the GSC
measurement are not aﬀected by the selected temperature range
(Doberenz et al., 2011). All evaluations were performed in a
blinded condition.
In each subject, six diﬀerent stimulations with sounds that
have been widely reported as “triggers” (Edelstein et al., 2013;
Kumar et al., 2017; Sweedo et al., 2022) were administered in
the following sequence to avoid any bias when interpreting
the statistical results: crunchy sound, nails tapping, chewing
sound, fast breathing, typing, and click pen sound. Baby crying
was used as the “general annoyance” sound, too. The audio
clips were selected from YouTube and were composed by
means of Audacity software (free and open-source digital audio
editor and recording application software licensed under GPL-
2.0) which allowed us to remove the background noise and
adjust the volume to 70 dB HL. In particular, the sounds were
adjusted by selecting the individual parts to get a normalization,
in order to have a uniform amplitude. This was done by
normalizing the peak width between 0.1 and 0.5 dB HL. As for
the measurement of the output volume in headphones, Audacity
has its own dB measurement system. The soundtracks were
administered to the participants with misophonia and HCs by
Beats Solo2 Headphones, with a sensitivity of 115 dB/mW, and
an impedance of 45 ohms.
Moreover, each sound did not exceed the 70 dB HL limit, so
as to make the experimental conditions as similar as possible to
the real context.
The pattern of stimulation for each sound was as follows: 5 s
silence, 30 s sound, 10 s silence, 30 s sound, 10 s silence, 30 s
sound, 10 s silence, 30 s sound, and 5 s silence (total period of
stimulation for each sound: 2 min and 40 s; ﬁve periods of silence
and four sound applications; Figure 1).
This pattern of stimulation was preceded and followed by
2 min and 20 s, to allow the return to the baseline before the
following stimulation, respectively.
The trigger sounds protocol was similar, in terms of duration
and repetition of each sound/silence period, for the psychiatric
assessment and the analysis of HRV and GSC. The only
diﬀerence was during fMRI, where the silence period was 30 s
instead of 10 s; this was due to the technical speciﬁcations
of the fMRI equipment. Thus, the overall time of stimulation
was about 42 min.
Psychometric assessment
Each participant was assessed with a protocol of
psychometric tests, including both clinician-rated and self-
rated tools, as detailed below. The psychometric assessment was
performed by an experienced psychiatrist, trained in the use of
the assessment tools described below.We chose to include several of the available measures for
misophonia, as most of them are not fully validated and show
intrinsic limitations (for instance, they do not measure the actual
magnitude of response to triggers), which is the reason why
there have been recent attempts to develop new tools in this ﬁeld
of research (Dibb et al., 2021).
As possible associations have been suggested between
misophonia and psychiatric disorders and/or symptoms,
including anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive
tendencies, in our psychometric assessment, we included an
overall measure of psychopathology (Symptom Checklist 90-R)
and speciﬁc measures for the symptoms detailed above. Some
of these measures are clinician-rated to avoid the possible biases
of self-rated questionnaires. Last, we included a measure of
resilience, which can be deﬁned as the process of adapting well
in the face of adversity and stress (American Psychological
Association, 2014).
While we clearly expected to ﬁnd higher scores on the
misophonia scales in participants with misophonia when
compared with controls, two scenarios could be hypothesized
for the psychopathological measures: no diﬀerence between
participants with misophonia and controls, or higher scores
in participants with misophonia compared to controls, which
would suggest a possible overlap of the misophonia construct
with psychopathological symptoms. Regarding resilience, we
were interested in assessing possible diﬀerences between the two
groups, groups with possibly lower resilience ratings suggesting
poorer resources in participants with misophonia in adapting to
perceived stressors.
Amsterdam Misophonia Scale
This scale is an adaptation of the Y ale-Brown Obsessive
Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) to address misophonic symptoms.
It has six items, scored from 0 (no symptom) to 4 (extreme).
Scores 0–4 suggest subclinical misophonic symptoms, 5–9 mild,
10–14 moderate, 15–19 severe, and 20–24 extreme (Schröder
et al., 2013).
Misophonia Questionnaire
The Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ) is a three-part self-
rated questionnaire that evaluates the presence of misophonic
symptoms, the resulting emotions and behaviors, and the
overall severity of sound sensibility. Misophonia symptoms and
resulting emotions and behaviors are assessed with 19 items
which can be scored from 0 (not at all true) to 4 (always true).
Ratings from the ﬁrst two parts are summed together to produce
a total score ranging from 0 to 72. Misophonia sound sensitivity
severity is rated on a scale from 1 (minimal) to 15 (very
severe) with a score greater than or equal to seven indicating
clinical misophonia (McKay et al., 2018). Initial validation of the
MQ indicates good internal consistency for the symptom scale
(a= 0.86), the emotions and behaviors scale (a = 0.86), and total
score (a = 0.89) (Wu et al., 2014).

FIGURE 1
Flowchart about the trigger sounds protocol. The entire sounds stimulation protocol was made of seven patterns of stimulation (six “trigger
sounds” and one “annoyance sound”). All patterns were included in a single track. We measured the baseline GSC and HRV variables during
each period of stimulation for comparison with the same values at baseline. GSC, galvanic skin conductance; HRV, heart rate variability.
Misophonia Activation Scale
This is a clinician-rated scale focusing on physical and
emotional reactions to the trigger sounds in misophonic
subjects. Participants are presented with 11 levels of responses to
the known and personal misophonic triggers, with higher levels
of response reﬂecting the severity of the disorder. The score
ranges from 0 (no reaction to speciﬁc sound) to 10 (physical
aggression, both self and others-directed) (Fitzmaurice, 2010).
Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire
The Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ)
includes 21 questions about the time spent on thoughts and
feelings related to misophonic cues, evaluated on a four-points
Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (always true).
Scores ranging from 0 to 11 indicate subclinical misophonic
symptoms, 12–24: mild, 25–37 moderate, 38–50 severe,
and 51–63 extreme (Johnson, 2014).
Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale
Clinician-rated, 10-item scale, which assesses the severity of
obsessions and compulsions in the week prior to the test. Total
scores range from 0 to 40 (Goodman et al., 1989).
Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale
This clinician-rated scale consists of 14 items, measuring
both the mental anxiety (psychological distress) and somatic
anxiety (physical symptoms related to anxiety). The total score
ranges from 0 to 56, where <17 indicates mild severity,
18–24 mild to moderate severity, and 25–30 moderate to
severe symptoms (Hamilton, 1959).Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) is a
clinician-rated 24-items test. The evaluation for most items is
the result of the integration between the objective observation
of signs and subjective exposure of symptoms, although
the severity criterion mainly refers to the former. Scores
0–9 indicate subclinical depression, 10–13 mild depression,
14–17 moderate depression, and greater than17 indicate
severe depression (Hamilton, 1960).
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory 1 and 2
It is a 40-item self-administered test for the assessment of
state and trait anxiety. Each item is rated from 1 to 4 (1 = not
at all, 4 = severe), and no speciﬁc cut-oﬀs exist. The higher the
score, the higher is the anxiety. Internal consistency coeﬃcients
for the scale ranged from 0.86 to 0.95; test–retest reliability
coeﬃcients ranged from 0.65 to 0.75 over a 2-month interval.
Test–retest coeﬃcients for this measure in the present study
ranged from 0.69 to 0.89 (Spielberger, 1989).
Resilience Scale for Adults
It is a 33-item self-administered scale evaluating intra-
or inter-relational stress-preventing factors (positive self-
perception, positive future perception, social competence,
structured style, family cohesion, and social resources). The
higher the total score, the greater is the subject’s resilience. The
Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA) is reliable, with good internal
consistency demonstrated by Cronbach alpha values ranging
from 0.79 to 0.88 in various studies, while among the six factors,
it ranges from 0.67, for the structured style, to 0.81, for the
perception of Self (Friborg et al., 2005).

Symptom Checklist 90 Revised
The Symptom Checklist 90 Revised (SCL-90-R) is a
multidimensional self-report measure that assesses the severity
of current psychological symptoms and distress. It assesses nine
symptom dimensions: somatization, obsessive–compulsive,
interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic
anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. It also includes
three global indices of psychological distress: global severity
index (number of symptoms endorsed and intensity of
distress), positive symptom distress index (average level of
distress for those items that were endorsed; exaggerating
or attenuating response style), and positive symptoms total
(total symptoms endorsed/breadth of distress). All the Italian
version subscales show a good internal coherence, with a-values
between 0.70 and 0.96 (Derogatis, 1992).
Analysis of heart rate variability and
galvanic skin conductance
In order to achieve our primary endpoint, which was related
to the evaluation of the orthosympathetic/parasympathetic
balance, we performed analyses of HRV and GSC, which are
widely adopted methods for the assessment of the autonomic
nervous system (Mackersie and Calderon-Moultrie, 2016). In
particular, we expected to ﬁnd increased parameters of HRV and
GSC related to orthosympathetic activation in the participants
with misophonia and increased parameters of HRV and GSC
related to parasympathetic activation in the HCs.
Heart rate variability and GSC were monitored before
(baseline) and during the trigger sounds protocol at the
Laboratory of Physiology. In particular, we have extrapolated
the numerical values of the entire registrations through special
programs, as reported below. Thereafter, values were taken from
the baseline and from the end of the trigger sounds protocol
and were used to calculate an average value (Figures 2–4) and
to make the graphs. All this was done for each sound and for
each participant. The HRV was obtained through automatized
analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) by Kubios.
The data from ECG and GSC were recorded together on
sitting subjects; furthermore, the subjects were seated in front
of a white wall without any possible distraction and were asked
to ﬁxate on a point on the wall.
Heart rate variability analysis
Heart rate variability parameters were obtained by the
computerized analysis of 6-lead ECG performed through Easy
ECG pocket and Software Easy View Plus Stress, Ates Medical
Device, Colognola Ai Colli, Verona, Italy. Kubios HRV program
version 3.1.0 was used to analyze the collected data in both the
time domain and frequency domain, as previously described
(Tarvainen et al., 2014).In particular, in the time domain, the following variables
have been measured: mean RR (means of RR intervals, at
RR intervals, or the elapsed time between ECG R waves),
standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN, for vagal activity)
(Gernot, 2017; Forte et al., 2019), and the root mean square
of successive diﬀerences between normal heart beats (RMSSD,
for vagal activity). In the frequency domain, the following
variables have been measured: high frequency (HF, for vagal
activity), low frequency (LF) (LF, sympathetic activity, or a mix
between sympathetic and vagal inﬂuences), LF/HF (sympathetic
activity), very low frequency (VLF, for sympatho-vagal balance)
and the HRV triangular index (for vagal activity).
In addition, sympathetic (SNS), parasympathetic (PNS)
index, and the stress index have been examined through Kubios
analysis of the registrations.
Galvanic skin conductance analysis
In order to collect GSC, a pair of Ag-AgCl electrodes was
attached to the palmar surface of the middle and ring ﬁngers
of the participant’s non-dominant hand. Prior to attachment,
participants’ hands were cleaned with an alcohol wipe and a skin
conductance gel was applied to each electrode.
Galvanic skin conductance was recorded with a Shimmer3
GSRC unit wireless device (Shimmer Research Ltd., Dublin,
Ireland), with two 8 mm Ag chloride electrodes (GSR electrodes
shimmer sensins), closed by velcro. Between electrodes, a
constant potential of 0.5 V was maintained.
The recorder was connected viaBluetooth to a portable PC
and the recorded data were shown on Consensys Pro (oﬃcial
Shimmer acquisition software) interface PC window, over a
range 0–100 micro S (mS). The gain parameter was set at 5 ms/V
and A/D resolution was set at 16 bits in order to acquire
data over this time range. The sample acquisition rate was 30
samples/s (Gatti et al., 2018).
Analysis of skin conductance data was performed with
Matlab version R2015a (The Mathworks, Natick, MA,
United States) using Ledalab v3.4.7 and custom analysis
programs. The raw skin conductance data were downsampled
to 8 Hz and visually examined for the presence of motion
artifacts, as indicated by HF ﬂuctuations in the signal amplitude.
The relatively few artifacts that were identiﬁed were replaced
using linear interpolation. The GSC analysis was performed
by using a continuous decomposition analysis (CDA) method
in order to capture only the variations of the activity, under
stimulation, that reﬂected an eﬀective diﬀerence from baseline
in each subject (Benedek and Kaernbach, 2010). In this case,
period analysis was done only at every 10 s stimulation peak,
and the results consisted of the average of GSC during the entire
stimulation period.
The CDA was performed to separate the tonic component
[skin conductance level (SCL)] and the phasic component [skin
conductance response (SCR)] of the signal, using an amplitude
criterion of 0.04 mS for deﬁning SCRs, which reveals the

Effects of the trigger sounds protocol on HRV variables in participants with misophonia and participants without misophonia [healthy controls

increased parasympathetic variables (HRV triangular index, RMSSD) in participants without misophonia in comparison with values registered at

activation of the sympathetic nervous system (Benedek and
Kaernbach, 2010; Staib et al., 2015; Clark et al., 2018; Posada-
Quintero et al., 2020).
Measured variables were as follows: the number of
signiﬁcant (above-threshold) SCRs within the response window
(CDA.nSCR), the sum of SCR amplitudes of signiﬁcant
SCRs within the response window (reconvolved from the
corresponding phasic driver-peaks) (CDA.AmpSum in mS), the
mean tonic activity within the response window (of decomposed
tonic component) (CDA.Tonic in mS), the maximum value of
phasic activity within the response window (CDA.PhasicMax in
mS), and the integral of SCR over the 10-s non-overlapping time
(CDA.iSCR in mSs), which was calculated to represent the
overall SCR in a certain time period. The CDA.iSCR is thought
to capture the cumulative eﬀect of the signals while avoiding
any inﬂuences by the usually arbitrary decision of the thresholds
for peak detection and event deﬁnition (Zhang et al., 2018; Kim
et al., 2019).
Functional magnetic resonance
imaging analysis
The objective of the fMRI analysis was to describe the neural
correlates of activation in participants with misophonia and
to identify any abnormally activated cortical areas compared
to healthy subjects. We expected to observe an activation of
areas within the central nervous system involved in the control
of the orthosympathetic/parasympathetic balance and in the
processing of emotions in participants with misophonia during
the trigger sounds protocol. Brodmann’s classiﬁcation system
was used for the deﬁnition of cortical areas.
Resonance magnetic imaging speciﬁcity and
protocol
A 3-Tesla Magnetic Resonance scanner was used (Ingenia,
Philips, Bergen, Norway) with a multichannel head coil (16
channels) and a NordicAktiva (NordicNeuroLab) fMRI system
for stimulus administration.
The fMRI protocol was a continuous scanning protocol
with two conditions, sound and silence. BOLD sequences,
T1-weighted, and T2-weighted sequences were acquired for
functional and anatomical reconstructions.
The parameters of T1-weighted sequence were as follows:
FOV 130130120, voxel size = 2 24 mm,
slice thickness = 4 mm, MPRAGE sequence, TR = 3000 ms,
TE = 35 ms, ﬂip angle = 90, and acquisition matrix = 96 94.
The parameters of BOLD sequences were as follows: FOV
182240256, voxel size = 111, slice thickness = 4 mm,
TR = shortest, TE = shortest, ﬂip angle = 8, and acquisition
matrix = 320300.
The sounds were administered according to the trigger
sounds protocol; during the fMRI continuous scanningprotocol, for each sound, a sequence was repeated, which
included four periods of sound presentation (30 s duration
each) and 5 periods of silence (30 s duration each) where no
sound was emitted, as described above. The total duration of
this protocol was 41 min and 18 s (including centering and
morphological T1 sequences).
Patient preparation
Each participant, before being positioned inside the MRI
scanner, was instructed by the radiologist about the execution
of the examination, the background sounds, the timing, and
the protocol in use. No information was provided on the
nature of the sound.
Before starting the acquisition, head coils and
soundprooﬁng headphones were used for the subjects (external
noise reduction of about 30 dB). The chosen volume amounted
to about 70 dB HL, which was set up before the starting fMRI
through the machine software. This sound intensity reﬂects
the average intensity value found in everyday life. Therefore, it
represents a sound intensity that participants with misophonia
may commonly encounter.
At the end of the fMRI scan, oral feedback on the perception
of sounds was requested. All participants conﬁrmed that they
heard and recognized the sounds.
Post-processing analysis
Once the data were acquired, data were converted into
DICOM format with the MRIcroGL software and then
reconstructed with the SPM12 Software (2020) (SPM12,
updated at October 2014). Within- and between-group
comparisons were made in results obtained through the fMRI.
The statistical performed parameter mapping (SPM) analysis
was the same for all subjects and veriﬁed by an experienced
operator external to the study.
Functional images were realigned to correct for motion,
spatially transformed to standard stereotaxic space (based on
the Montreal Neurological Institute coordinate system) and
smoothed with an 8-mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian
kernel to decrease spatial noise prior to statistical analysis.
Rotational motion in degrees (pitch, roll, and yaw), and
translational movement in millimeters (x,y,z), were calculated
based on the SPM12 parameters for motion correction of
the functional images in each subject. No participants had
movement greater than 2.5-mm translation or 3 degrees of
rotation; therefore, none were excluded from further analysis.
One-sample t-tests were performed to reveal statistically
signiﬁcant signal diﬀerences generated by trigger sounds and the
general annoyance sound in participants with misophonia and
HCs. The family-wise error rate corrected to p<0.05 was used
for all analysis methods (Nandy and Cordes, 2004).
During the fMRI model estimation process, reconstruction
was performed for p-values = 0.1 (that were not statistically
signiﬁcant) without the family-wise error rate correction, as a

control for an actual BOLD signal recording. All participants
showed the presence of a signal; therefore, none were excluded
from further analysis.
All reported areas having a statistically signiﬁcant p-value
and a cluster size greater than 2 were considered as “activated
areas” or “activation.” No masks were applied during the post-
processing analysis.
Statistical analyses
The calculation of the sample size was performed based
on the primary endpoint, which in our study was deﬁned
as an activation of the autonomic nervous system. To do
this, we considered a quantitative parameter related to the
activity of the orthosympathetic system, that is GSC. Literature
data reported a diﬀerence in the GSC between HCs and
participants with misophonia amounting to 0.15 0.4mS
(Edelstein et al., 2013). Using a statistical power of 80% and
an alpha error of 0.05, we obtained a total of 55 subjects
divided between 11 participants with misophonia and 44 HCs
(controls). Misophonic and control groups were compared
through descriptive statistics. Categorical data are reported as
a percentage and absolute frequencies. Continuous data are
summarized as mean standard deviation (SD) or standard
error (SE). Wilcoxon-type and Mann–Whitney tests were
performed for continuous variables and the Pearson chi-square
test or Fisher-exact test, for categorical variables.
A generalized linear mixed eﬀect (GLME) model was used
to examine and compare response trends over time (during
the trigger sounds protocol vs. baseline), compare group
averages (HCs vs. participants with misophonia), and compare
the measurement time within each group (interaction term).
A random eﬀect (intercept) on the subject’s identiﬁcation code
term has been considered to account for correlations within
repeated measurements across time. The time eﬀect with group
membership interaction was also considered as a ﬁxed-eﬀect
factor to adjust the estimates, together for sex and age. Separate
univariable models were estimated. The p-values were adjusted
for multiple endpoints by considering the Benjamini–Hochberg
correction. The model estimates together with the SE and
p-values are reported. The HRV and GSC results are presented
inFigures 2–4 created using GraphPad Prism 6.
P-values <0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Statistical analyses were conducted using R 3.5.2 with rms
packages (Core and Team, 2019) and lme4 (Bates et al., 2015).

Psychometric assessment
Table 2 shows signiﬁcant group diﬀerences for the
psychometric assessment between misophonic subjects and
HCs. The most striking result emerging from the psychometric
assessment is that, as expected according to the study sampling

procedure, subjects in the misophonia group scored signiﬁcantly
higher on all the questionnaires speciﬁcally assessing the
misophonia construct [Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-
MISO-S), Misophonia Activation Scale (MAS-1), MQ, and
MAQ]. In contrast, we failed to ﬁnd group diﬀerences in the
questionnaires assessing the overall psychopathology (Symptom
Checklist-90-R), obsessive-compulsive, depressive, and anxiety
symptoms [Y-BOCS, HAM-D, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale
(HAM-A), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory].
Speciﬁcally, according to the mean scores on the A-MISO-
S and MAQ, participants in the misophonia group had mild
levels of misophonia, while those in the HCs scored within
normal limits. The mean MQ severity score in the misophonia
group, nonetheless, was 5.20, lower than the cutoﬀ (score >7)
indicating possible misophonia.
Another interesting result is the ﬁnding of lower resilience
scores in misophonic subjects, suggesting that compared to HCs,
they possess less resilience when facing stressors.
Effects of the trigger sounds protocol
on heart rate variability and galvanic
skin conductance
As reported in section “Materials and methods, ”
we performed this analysis in order to address our
primary endpoint, which was to determine changes in the
orthosympathetic/parasympathetic balance in the participants
with misophonia vs. participants without misophonia.
First, we measured HRV and GSC variables in both
participants with and without misophonia before the start
of the trigger sounds protocol in order to collect baseline
values of all participants. These data were used for comparison
with the results obtained within each group of participants
after the trigger sounds protocol. The changes between
measurements of HRV and GSC variables obtained during
the trigger sounds protocol vs. baseline values (set as 1) were
calculated as a percentage. As shown in Table 3, the baseline
analysis of HRV and GSC parameters evidenced signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between the participants with misophonia and HCs.
Hence, all examined variables except the maximum value of
phasic activity within the response window, LF, and LF/high
frequency were higher in the participants with misophonia
than HCs. In addition, high frequency, parasympathetic index,
and VLF were lower in the formers. These ﬁndings were in
agreement with our test hypothesis that the orthosympathetic
tone (basal orthosympathetic activity) would be dominant in
participants with misophonia, and a parasympathetic tone
(basal parasympathetic activity) would be dominant in HCs in
the baseline condition.
These baseline values were then used to compare the eﬀects
of the trigger sounds protocol in the two groups of subjects.
It is noteworthy that in comparison with the baseline, in HCs,TABLE 3 Baseline HRV and GSC variables.

of all other HRV parameters was observed in participants with
misophonia vs. HCs (Figures 2, 3).
An example of GSC analysis taken from one participant with
misophonia is shown in Figure 5.
A signiﬁcant interaction emerged for all parameters
indicating that the change in values between the baselineand the trigger sounds protocol showed diﬀerent patterns
for participants with misophonia and HCs. In particular, the
values for sympathetic index, stress index, VLF, LF, and LF/HF
increased over time among participants with misophonia,
whereas, in the same subjects, the values for parasympathetic
index, HF, and HRV decreased. When treated as a covariate for
modeling group diﬀerences, “age” was only a signiﬁcant factor
in two of the N models tested: LF and HF. The GSC values
showed increasing trends over time among participants with
misophonia (Tables 4, 5).
On the whole, the results obtained provide evidence for
a higher orthosympathetic and lower parasympathetic tone at
baseline registrations in participants with misophonia than HCs.
The state of these tones was then strengthened by the trigger
sounds protocol.

particular, it was hypothesized that greater activation in brain
regions involving the limbic system, the temporal cortex, and the
cerebellum would be observed due to the relationship between
these areas and the orthosympathetic/parasympathetic balance.
The principal ﬁndings are summarized in Table 6.
The fMRI analysis conﬁrmed our test hypotheses about the
involvement of the above neuronal areas in the participants with
misophonia during the trigger sounds protocol. Hence, in all
cases, a strong activation of the temporal superior gyrus (BA
22; 100%), the temporal cortex (BA 21; 100%), and the auditory
cortex (BA 41 and 42; 100%) was found. In about 70% of cases,the premotor cortex (BA 6) and the cerebellum were found to be
activated, as well.
Furthermore, 8/11 (73%) participants with misophonia
showed activation signals in at least one of the following: the
hippocampus, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the insula,
and the cingulate cortex.
Figure 6A shows the atypical activation of multiple brain
regions in a participant with misophonia after hearing the
“eating crunching” sounds. In particular, the auditory cortex
(BA 41 and 42), the cerebellum, the insula, the premotor
cortex (BA 6), and the frontal cortex (BA 4) were activated
during the trigger sounds protocol. Another example of an
fMRI image taken in one participant with misophonia is shown
inFigure 6B. In that subject, the presentation of “breathing”
caused the stimulation of the auditory cortex (BA 41 and 42),
the cerebellum, and the premotor areas (BA 6). It is to note
that those ﬁndings were evidenced after the application of the
correction factor “family-wise error rate” in SPM analysis.
Concerning the HCs, 36/44 (82%) subjects demonstrated the
activation of the auditory cortex (BA 41 and 42), while in 8 (18%)
subjects, we could not ﬁnd any activated area. In these eight
subjects, further post-processing analysis was performed on the
images, showing the presence of stimulus response for SPM with
p= 0.1.

Coordinates are expressed according to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) system; brain areas are expressed according to Brodmann’s classiﬁcation.
InFigure 7, examples of fMRI in two HCs are shown;
in those subjects, “eating crunching” and “breathing” caused
the activation of the primary auditory cortex (BA 42 and 41),
only. Also, in this case, as speciﬁed above, the correction factor
“family-wise error rate” in SPM analysis had been applied.
Thus, the fMRI analysis highlighted the activation of
brain regions involved both in the orthosympathetic response
and in the processing of trigger stimuli only in participants
with misophonia.
Discussion
The results of this study obtained by combining the
fMRI analysis with physiological and psychiatric evaluations
showed speciﬁc auditory-insula-limbic patterns of activation
associated with increased sympathetic tone in participants
with misophonia. Those ﬁndings are unlikely due to speciﬁc
psychopathologic features, as shown by the absence ofdiﬀerences between the two groups of participants (those with
misophonia and HCs) in the questionnaires assessing obsessive-
compulsive, depressive, and anxiety symptoms.
As previously described, misophonia is a disorder
characterized by reduced tolerance to speciﬁc sounds or
stimuli known as “triggers, ” which tend to evoke negative
emotional, physiological, and behavioral responses (Kumar
et al., 2017; Sweedo et al., 2022).
Recently collected data showed a prevalence of participants
with misophonia that reaches up to 49% in the general
population (Naylor et al., 2021) and about 52% in subjects
with obsessive- compulsive disorder (Siepsiak et al., 2020). In
addition to feelings of anxiety, distress, and anger, physical
manifestations including tightness or pain in the entire
body, increased muscular tone, dyspnea, tachycardia, and
hypertension have been described (Cavanna and Seri, 2015).
Moreover, those experiences may lead, in some subjects, to
a severe decline in daily functioning and the development of
behavioral health problems.

Although misophonia now has a consensus deﬁnition
(Sweedo et al., 2022), and some information is available on
the utility of psychometric assessment and involvement of
the autonomic nervous system, more in-depth investigationsrelating to the activation of the orthosympathetic and
parasympathetic systems and to the concomitant activation of
brain regions involved in emotional responses could be useful
for a better understanding of this disorder.

Heart rate variability and galvanic skin
conductance effects induced by the
trigger sounds protocol in participants
with misophonia
We utilized both HRV and GSC to analyze the autonomic
nervous system balance in misophonic participants and HCs
(Benedek and Kaernbach, 2010; Tarvainen et al., 2014; Seri,
2015; Staib et al., 2015; Gernot, 2017; Clark et al., 2018; Zhang
et al., 2018; Forte et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Posada-
Quintero et al., 2020). In particular, we analyzed both the
orthosympathetic and parasympathetic drive using HRV and
analyzed the orthosympathetic proﬁle using GSC, which is
related to the cholinergic-dependent sympathetic stimulation of
the cutaneous sweat glands.
The baseline registration of HRV and GSC variables
showed interesting results in participants with misophonia.
In these participants, HRV variables were more distinctly
related to an increased orthosympathetic tone, such as
LF and LF/HF and almost all GSC variables. Meanwhile,
markers of parasympathetic tone given by HRV , including
HF, parasympathetic index, and LF, were higher in HCs
than in participants with misophonia. These ﬁndings add
important information regarding the state of the autonomic
nervous system in resting conditions in participants with
misophonia vs. HCs and are useful for outlining their
orthosympathetic/parasympathetic background.
Participants with misophonia showed increased levels for
almost all orthosympathetic HRV measures and decreased
levels for almost all parasympathetic measures. The activation
of the orthosympathetic system was also conﬁrmed by the
GSC analysis. In HCs, it is noteworthy that trigger sounds
resulted in a reduction of the sympathetic index, the sum
of SCR-amplitudes of signiﬁcant SCRs, and the maximum
value of phasic activity. These results suggest that the trigger
sounds protocol caused an inhibition of the orthosympathetic
system in HCs unlike what was observed in the participants
with misophonia.
Since the main bias of this study was the diﬀerence in age
between participants with misophonia and HCs, we added a
correction for age to the statistical analysis of HRV and GSC
data. While we could not conﬁrm our previous observations,
since for LF and HF, the statistical signiﬁcance in results
was lost after the correction for age, the general patterns
appeared to be similar to those observed without performing the
correction for age.
While our ﬁndings were similar to those obtained by
Kumar et al. (2017), there are several key diﬀerences in
our experimental protocol that must be considered. For
example, Kumar et al. (2017), used two trigger sounds and
one neutral sound, whereas we concentrated on six trigger
sounds and a general annoyance sound. Furthermore, changesin the autonomic nervous system balance were examined by
analyzing many GSC and HRV variables, which evaluated the
orthosympathetic/parasympathetic activity both at the baseline
and during auditory stimulation. Finally, it should be noted
that the sample size in this study was calculated through
appropriate statistical tests based on the variation of a parameter
related to the activation of the autonomic nervous system
(Edelstein et al., 2013). In this way, we could answer the
primary hypothesis of the study, which referred to the presence
of an altered orthosympathetic/parasympathetic balance in
participants with misophonia. In the study by Kumar et al.
(2017), instead, participants with misophonia were matched
without any power size calculation with participants without
misophonia. In addition, in that study, results focused on fMRI
analyses. Only one GSC measurement was performed (galvanic
skin response), and one HRV measurement (heart rate); no
psychometric assessment was provided.
In the study by Edelstein et al. (2013), participants with
misophonia were recruited after an interview and the emotional
responses to diﬀerent “trigger sounds” were evaluated. In the
second part of that study, a comparison was executed between
six participants with misophonia and ﬁve HCs in terms of
GSC response to auditory–visual stimulations. A similar kind of
experimental protocol was executed by Schröder et al. (2019),
who conducted psychometric assessments and fMRI analysis in
21 participants with misophonia and 23 HCs. However, a change
in the HR was the only measure used to evaluate the autonomic
nervous system activation.
As reported above, our ﬁndings about the activation of
the orthosympathetic nervous system in participants with
misophonia are in agreement with previous observations.
However, here we conducted a more in-depth evaluation
of autonomic nervous system involvement in response to a
trigger sounds protocol, by combining it with psychometric and
imaging evaluation.
Neuroanatomical pathways activated
by the trigger sounds protocol in
participants with misophonia
In participants with misophonia, we observed activations
of Brodmann areas 21, 22, 41, and 42, which could be
attributed to listening, detection, and understanding of a
perceived sound (Pickles, 2015). In addition, in participants
with misophonia, the trigger sounds protocol caused activation
in the hippocampus, the cingulate cortex, the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex, and the insula. Overall, those ﬁndings are
in agreement with the data by Kumar et al. (2017), who
showed that, in participants with misophonia, the trigger
sounds were associated with abnormal functional connectivity
between the anterior insula cortex, the ventromedial prefrontal

Grossini et al. 10.3389/fnins.2022.827998
cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala. It is to note that
all of those brain regions are involved with the perception
of interoceptive signals and emotion processing (McLachlan,
2009). Moreover, they play a role in the modulation of
the autonomic nervous system and in the integration of
physiological signals and the dynamic representation of
emotional states. In particular, the ﬁndings of the involvement
of the superior temporal cortex (BA 22), the area with
the largest change in the activation in participants with
misophonia, could be argued to be related to an increased
sensitivity to the trigger sounds in those subjects. In this
way, the trigger sounds protocol could have induced auditory
attention and caused a greater response to the stimuli,
resulting in signals being labeled as emotionally relevant. The
absence of activation of the amygdala in participants with
misophonia could be attributable to the possible inhibition
exerted by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which would
be involved in the regulation of emotions by the inhibition of
neuronal areas involved in this process, such as the amygdala
(Motzkin et al., 2015).
Alternatively, it is possible that we did not ﬁnd any
involvement of amygdala because this region is more associated
with fear than representing a primary emotional site, as
reported by Schröder et al. (2019).
The HCs group showed the activation of Brodmann areas
41 and 42, only, with a mean cluster size of 130 voxel. This
could be explained by the trigger sounds protocol that, when
compared to the background noise of the fMRI continuous
protocol, was of low intensity. Moreover, in eight HCs, there
was no activation. Those eight HCs stated during the brief
interview following the fMRI that they perceived and recognized
the sounds during the examination. These were subjects whose
fMRI images were acquired on diﬀerent days and did not belong
to a single session. In order to exclude mistakes in subject
sampling, reconstruction analyses were followed for SPM values
with p-values above the signiﬁcant threshold (p = 0.1). It is to
note that this post-processing reconstruction showed activations
of Brodmann areas 41 and 42. This activation, in eight HCs, also
persisted for values of p= 0.05. However, the application of the
family-wise error rate resulted in its elimination.
Psychiatric assessment: Comparison of
participants with misophonia and
healthy controls
The results of the psychiatric evaluation indicate that
misophonia could be a construct independent of the general
psychopathology (as assessed with the Symptom Checklist-90
R), anxiety (HAM-A, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), depression
(HAM-D), and obsessive-compulsive features (Y-BOCS).
The currently available literature has described possible
associations of misophonia with a variety of psychiatricsymptoms, such as traits of obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder, mood disorders, attention-deﬁcit (hyperactivity)
disorder, autism spectrum conditions (Jager et al., 2020a), post-
traumatic stress disorder, and anorexia (Erfanian et al., 2019).
Nonetheless, data about the frequency of misophonia in patients
suﬀering from psychiatric disorders are lacking (Siepsiak et al.,
2020). Recent research supported the possible relationship
of misophonia symptoms with clinician-rated symptoms of
personality disorders, but not other psychiatric disorders, even
though anxiety was found to partially mediate this relationship
(Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2021).
There are also suggestions that misophonia could be a
discrete psychiatric disorder, with corresponding implications
for treatment (Schröder et al., 2013). Features, such as
neuroticism, impulsivity, and diﬃculties with emotion
regulation have been suggested as important risk factors and
treatment targets for adults with misophonia (Cassiello-Robbins
et al., 2020). Recently, both short-term and long-term eﬃcacy
of CBT for misophonia have been reported (Jager et al., 2020b).
In support of our baseline hypothesis, we found higher
scores on the misophonia scales in participants with misophonia
when compared to HCs. Nonetheless, it has to be underscored
that participants in the misophonia group did not score above
the cutoﬀ established for misophonia in all scales; actually,
they had mild misophonia according to the mean scores on
the A-MISO-S and MAQ, but scored lower than the cutoﬀ
on the MQ. While this might lead one to argue whether
the diﬀerences we found between the two groups could be
clearly attributed to misophonia (Schröder et al., 2017), we
also have to underscore that, as described in the “Materials
and methods” section, our assessment included more than one
questionnaire, the involvement of a psychiatrist, and proper
screening in a face-to-face interview where information about
co-morbidity was gathered.
As far as psychopathology is concerned, our ﬁrst
hypothesis is supported, as our results did not evidence
the presence of psychopathologic symptoms in participants
with misophonia (as assessed with the Symptom Checklist-90
R, HAM-A, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, HAM-D, and
Y-BOCS). Thus, the higher scores found in the misophonia
measures seem independent of the overall psychopathology,
leading to the possibility that misophonia may be either
a discrete pathological condition or a non-pathological
variant of human nature linked to a particular way of
processing trigger sounds.
Also, misophonia could be involved in the creation of the
so-called “global emotional moment.” This is meant as the set
of homeostatic, environmental, hedonic, motivational, social,
and cognitive activities (Bud, 2009), which contribute to one’s
feelings and represent the sentient self at one moment in time.
Finally, the ﬁnding of lower resilience scores in participants
with misophonia may suggest poorer resources in this group of
subjects when facing stressors.

Connections between neuroanatomic
pathways, autonomic nervous system
response, and psychiatric assessment
in participants with misophonia
The primary auditory cortex lies in the transverse temporal
gyri of Heschl that are juxtaposed to the insula, which is
considered a key brain area in the homeostasis of visceral
information processing and interoception. In particular, the
insula is involved in the control of the autonomic nervous
system and in the integration of physiological signals, as
well as the dynamic representation of emotional states
to create the “global emotional moment” (McGeoch and
Rouw, 2020). Negative emotional experiences have been
reported to induce anterior insular activation, including
disgusting, frightening, happy, sad, or sexual images
(Uddin et al., 2017).
The cingulate cortex, which is connected to the amygdala,
is responsible for the processing of emotions and for the
regulation of associated endocrine and autonomic responses.
This region is also involved in reward-related processing of
endocrine and autonomic responses to them due to the fact
that this area is involved in reward-related processing. The
cingulate cortex can be considered a connecting center of
emotions, sensations, and action. Due to its links with the
hippocampus and amygdala, the cingulate cortex could also
have a role in the consolidation of long-term memories and
the processing of emotionally relevant stimuli. The integration
of signals originating from all the above areas would, thus,
result in the modulation of the autonomic nervous system drive
and in processing emotional states. In predisposed subjects,
an auditory-insular synesthesia model could account for the
onset of psychiatric symptoms and clinical manifestation of
changes in the orthosympathetic/parasympathetic balance. In
this way, a dynamic process of altered neurological activation
could turn the speciﬁc auditory stimuli into trigger sounds
to induce strong emotional responses (Nagai et al., 2007;
Rolls, 2019). In this context, our data would also support
the concept of wellbeing that has been linked to the balance
between the two sides of the autonomic nervous system. In
particular, it has been hypothesized that conditions of chronic
sympathetic hyperactivity and parasympathetic hypoactivity
would be associated with reduced emotional wellbeing and
a variety of mental disorders and vice versa (Thayer and
Brosschot, 2005; Strigo and Craig, 2016).
The ﬁndings of increased baseline sympathetic variables in
participants with misophonia and parasympathetic variables in
HCs measured with HRV and GSC would conﬁrm the above
issues regarding the reduced “emotional wellbeing reserve” and
increased predisposition to undergo changes in wellbeing in
response to stressful auditory conditions.With regard to resilience, which was found to be reduced in
participants with misophonia, and in general emotional states,
numerous studies have associated this trait with the activation
of the mesocorticolimbic area, such as the hippocampus and
the prefrontal cortex (Richter et al., 2019). Similarly, Tan et al.
(2018) correlated heartbeat interoception and anxious state
and found the activation of the insula to be related to this
emotional state. Cholinergic signaling in the hippocampus has
also been described to regulate the social stress resilience and
anxiety- and depression-like behavior. Finally, this study found
the activation of the cingulate cortex activation in misophonia,
which would be involved with homeostatic motivations that
guide an adaptive behavior. Taken together, the insula and
limbic areas could represent the neuroanatomical basis linking
orthosympathetic system activation, emotion, and feelings
(Strigo and Craig, 2016).
A novel ﬁnding from this study involved motor control,
such as Brodmann area 6 and the cerebellum. The premotor
cortex (BA 6), in particular, would be activated “during motor
imagery, ” that is, when the subject visually imagines a movement
or imagines the sensations, he would experience during that
movement. Thus, it could be hypothesized that in participants
with misophonia, the trigger sounds protocol would activate
the neural pathways implicated in the preparation/execution of
escape (Kumar et al., 2021).
Conclusion
In conclusion, the results obtained from our study underline
the existence of a speciﬁc response pattern within the
auditory cortex-insula-limbic areas which, in the presence of
“trigger sounds, ” would be activated in predisposed subjects,
such as participants with misophonia. The recruitment of
those neuronal patterns would, in turn, alter the autonomic
nervous system balance in favor of the orthosympathetic drive,
inﬂuencing the emotional wellbeing.
Considering the limitations of the study, future work should
investigate diﬀerent activation patterns resulting from various
trigger sounds and the general annoyance sound. Multimodal
stimulation using video clips and sounds that simulate everyday
life may also reveal patterns similar to those described in this
study. Moreover, future comparisons should include a “no
annoyance control condition.” The selection of participants
should also be based on the recent consensus deﬁnition of
misophonia (Sweedo et al., 2022), which was not available at the
time of this study, and the enlarged sample size to determine
speciﬁc eﬀects of gender. Finally, any bias related to diﬀerences
in age could be avoided by speciﬁc selection of participants,
which would allow for an age correction (this was not performed
in the current study).
