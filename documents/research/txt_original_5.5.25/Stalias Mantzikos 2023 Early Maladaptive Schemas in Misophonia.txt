ABSTRACT
Objective: The study aimed to identify early maladaptive schemas that may be characteristic of 
individuals with misophonia.
Method: A sample of 289 individuals were recruited from social media websites. Participants 
responded to the Young Schema Questionnaire-Short Form, which assesses early maladaptive 
schemas (EMS), and the New York Misophonia Scale, a two-part self-report instrument rating 
the severity of emotional distress to misophonic triggers and the nature of behavioural 
reactions to misophonic triggers. Gender differences in the study variables were first examined 
using a series of univariate analysis of variance. To test the relationship between features of 
misophonia and EMS, correlation coefficients were calculated. Multiple regression analyses 
were then conducted by including age, gender and YSQ-SF scores as predictors and misopho -
nic distress, aggressive reactions, and non-aggressive reactions as outcomes.
Results: Results revealed that higher insufficient self-control EMS was a common predictor of 
all aspects of misophonia, while higher age, female gender and higher social isolation/aliena -
tion EMS were predictive of the aversive emotional reactions in misophonia. Higher depen -
dence and unrelenting standards EMS were specific predictors of non-aggressive reactions 
while dependence and vulnerability to harm or illness EMS were specific predictors of aggres -
sive reactions to misophonic triggers.
Conclusions: Findings imply that schema therapy may be an effective intervention to alleviate 
misophonic distress.
KEY POINTS
What is already known about this topic:
(1) Previous research has associated misophonia with psychopathological conditions such as 
obsessive-, anxiety, and depressive disorders.
(2) Childhood adversities and early maladaptive schemas have been implicated as risk factors 
in obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, and depressive disorders.
(3) Research on early maladaptive schemas that may be a common link shared by misophonia 
and obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, or depressive disorders is lacking.
What this topic adds:
(1) The current study revealed that schemas within the disconnection/rejection and over -
vigilance/inhibition domains are common to both misophonia and anxiety disorders while 
those within the other-directedness domain may serve to distinguish misophonia.
from anxiety disorders.
(2) Similarly, schemas associated with disconnection/rejection and impaired autonomy/per -
formance domains that have been reported as significant predictors and maintaining 
factors of depressive symptoms are also found to be associated with misophonia.
(3) Furthermore, the insufficient self-control schema within the impaired limits domain 
appears to be the only one common across both misophonia and OCD.ARTICLE HISTORY

Misophonia was first formulated by Jastreboff and 
Jastreboff (2001 ) and is a disorder in which specific 
sounds or stimuli related to those sounds decreases 
one’s tolerance to the stimuli (Swedo et al., 2022 ). 
These specific sounds have been identified as trigger 
sounds and they include human-driven actions such as 
chewing, pen clicking, tapping, and lip-smacking (Edelstein et al., 2013 ). The misophonia criterion has 
been expanded to include visual stimuli such as crack -
ing knuckles, jiggling, and swinging legs (Swedo et al.,  
2022 ) as well as olfactory and tactile stimuli (Dozier,  
2015 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ). In response to the trigger 
stimuli, individuals with misophonia may experience 
distress as reflected by increased autonomic arousal

and negative affect such as anger, irritation, disgust, or 
anxiety. The trigger stimuli may also evoke behavioural 
reactions such as escape or avoidance from the situa -
tions in which the trigger stimuli may be encountered, 
aggression directed towards the source of the trigger 
stimuli (Swedo et al., 2022 ) or mimicking of trigger 
sounds (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Hadjipavlou et al., 2008 ).
Concerning auditory misophonia experiences, miso -
phonia has been linked to an increased sensitivity 
between the functional connections of the auditory, lim-
bic, and nervous systems (Schwartz et al., 2011 ). Research 
by Edelstein et al. (2013 ) demonstrated that misophonic 
patients show autonomic reactivity to sound but not to 
other sensory stimuli. Currently, misophonia is not recog -
nized as a distinct psychiatric disorder, literature is limited 
and research on misophonia is still in its early stages. 
Swedo et al. (2022 ), who are responsible for formulating 
the consensus definition of misophonia, report that by 
January 2021, misophonia research had been conducted 
for less than 0 years with fewer than 100 peer-reviewed 
papers. Thus, a consensus definition was considered an 
important step for cohesion in research within an area 
where researchers and clinicians are still trying to under -
stand causes and correlates in order to better serve and 
support those experiencing misophonia.
Although the research is limited and misophonia is 
not formally recognized as a psychiatric disorder, 
research and clinical practice in misophonia have asso -
ciated misophonia with various psychopathological dis-
orders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), 
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depres -
sion, eating disorder, obsessive-compulsive personality 
disorder (OCPD), social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety (Rouw & Erfanian,  
2018 ; Wu et al., 2014 ), in addition to audiological dis-
orders such as tinnitus and hyperacusis (Greenberg,  
2017 ; Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001 ).
Several studies have implicated childhood adversities 
(Bey et al., 2017 ; Castellini et al., 2018 ; Hayward et al.,  
2020 ; Tao et al., 2021 ), attachment insecurity 
(Cortés-García et al., 2020 ; Tasca, 2019 ; Van Assche et al.,  
2020 ; van Leeuwen et al., 2020 ), and distorted thinking 
patterns (Kube et al., 2019 ; Maric et al., 2010 ; Rowlands 
et al., 2021 ; Tibi et al., 2018 ) as risk factors or causal 
mechanisms in depression, anxiety, OCD, and eating dis-
orders. Given the association between misophonia and 
such disorders there may be justification to assume that 
such risk factors are central to misophonia as well. 
A theoretical framework that refers to cognitive vulner -
ability for psychopathology is Young’s schema theory. 
This theory builds on attachment theory and considers 
early maladaptive schemas (EMS) as central to the devel -
opment and maintenance of psychopathology. As based on Young’s theory, children have five core emotional 
needs which are: 1. Secure attachment with others, 2. 
Autonomy, 3. Freedom to express valid needs and emo -
tions, 4. Spontaneity and play, and 5. Realistic limits and 
self-control. If these 5 core needs are not met 
a maladaptive representation of the environment is cre-
ated leading to the creation of EMS. According to Young 
et al. (2003 ), an EMS is a dysfunctional thinking pattern 
about the self and others. In childhood, EMS are 
a representation of the child's reality, while in adulthood 
they may lead to dysfunctional clinical states because 
they selectively filter experiences. Young (1994 ), originally 
identified 18 early maladaptive schemas separated into 5 
domains which mirror the 5 core emotional needs: (1) 
disconnection and rejection domain, (2) impaired auton -
omy and performance domain, (3) impaired limits 
domain, (4) other-directedness domain, and (5) over vig-
ilance and inhibition domain. The Young Schema 
Questionnaire (YSQ) was created for EMS identification 
and assessment purposes and the Young Schema 
Questionnaire-Short Form (YSQ-SF) is a 75-item question -
naire which assesses 5 domains and 15 out of the original 
18 EMS was further created for both compliance and 
accuracy since both may be compromised in clinical 
samples due to length (Oei & Baranoff, 2007 ). The five 
domains and their associated schemas are listed and 
explained in Table 1. The 3 EMS not assessed by the YSQ- 
SF are Approval Seeking/Recognition Seeking from the 
Other-Directedness Domain and from the Overvigilance/ 
Inhibition Domain the Negativity/Pessimissm and the 
Punitiveness EMS.
Kizilagac (2019 ) claims that most early maladaptive 
schemas can be associated with several psychological 
disorders. Empirical attempts have been made to iden -
tify early maladaptive schemas characteristic of specific 
forms of psychopathology (see Table 2).
Given that misophonia also is characterized by heigh -
tened autonomic arousal and negative affect to specific 
trigger stimui along with avoidance tendencies 
(Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ) and perfectionism (Jager 
et al., 2020 ), we anticipate schemas of social isolation/ 
alienation, vulnerability to harm or illness, insufficient 
self-control and unrelenting standards to be more 
strongly associated with misophonia than the other sche -
mas. The identification of distinct schema profiles in the 
various psychopathologies may not only provide insight 
on risk factors but also provide viable treatment options.
Young et al. (2003 ) suggested a form of therapy 
known as schema therapy which would aid individuals 
with psychological disorders. Schema therapy (ST), ori-
ginally conceived as an option for treating non- 
responders to cognitive behavioural therapy such as 
those with personality disorders (Young et al., 2003 ), 2

has gained increased attention in recent years. Schema 
therapy has demonstrated efficacy across various dis-
orders including cluster C personality disorders 
(Bamelis et al., 2014 ), mood and anxiety disorders 
(Malogiannis et al., 2014 ; Renner et al., 2015 ), eating 
disorders (McIntosh et al., 2016 ), posttraumatic stress 
disorder (Cockram et al., 2010 ) and when treating transdiagnostic factors such as emotional dysregula -
tion (Dadomo et al., 2016 ). The multiphasic nature of 
ST incorporates a variety of psychotherapeutic theories 
and techniques including psychodynamic and attach -
ment theory as well as experiential therapeutic 
approaches (e.g., two-chair technique) (Bachrach & 
Arntz, 2021 ). The activation of early maladaptive Table 1. The five schema domains and the associated ems as assessed by the YSQ-SF.
Domain/Schema Concise Description
Domain 1: Disconnection and 
RejectionDetached, cold and rejecting family of origin. Core unmet need of secure attachment with others.
(1) Abandonment/Instability There is an expectation that important people in one’s life will not be there.
(2) Mistrust/Abuse Expectation that important people in one’s life will abuse, humiliate, lie, or manipulate.
(3) Emotional Deprivation The expectation that the desired emotional connection will not be fulfilled and its broken down into 
a. deprivation of nurturance, b. deprivation of empathy, and c. deprivation of protection.
(4) Defectiveness/Shame The perception that one is flawed, bad, inferior, worthless and unlovable.
(5) Social Isolation/Alienation The individual feels different from the larger social unit outside the family.
Domain 2: Impaired Autonomy and 
PerformanceThe family of origin is undermining of the child’s confidence and as an outcome the individual may manifest an 
inability to separate, survive, and function independently. Core unmet need of autonomy.
(6) Dependence/Incompetence The individual experiences an inability to handle everyday responsibilities without the help from others.
(7) Vulnerability to Harm or Illness There is the experience of exaggerated fear regarding catastrophe in one or more of these domains: a medical 
(disease), emotional (breakdown) and/or external (natural disaster) disaster could strike at any moment
(8) Enmeshment/Undeveloped Self There is a lack of a real sense of identity due to overinvolvement with a parent or significant other.
(9) Failure to Achieve There is an expectation that there will be failure in any attempt of achievement
Domain 3: Impaired Limits Permissive parenting style resulting in a lack of direction, sense of superiority, and overindulgence. Core unmet 
need of realistic limits and self-control.
(10) Entitlement/Grandiosity The individual develops feelings of superiority and entitlement to special rights
(11) Insufficient Self-Control There is no regulation of emotion or impulse so as to achieve personal goals. Individual may avoid conflict or 
responsibility through discomfort avoidance.
Domain 4: Other-Directedness The family structure was one where children felt conditional acceptance. Core unmet need of freedom to 
express valid needs and emotions.
(12) Subjugation The individual will surrender to others either through 1. subjugation of needs, where one suppresses own 
preferences and 2. subjugation of emotions, where one suppresses emotional responses of happiness, anger 
etc. Individual becomes compliant and may present as passive-aggressive, experience uncontrolled 
outbursts or psychosomatic complaints.
(13) Self-Sacrifice There is voluntary suppression of own needs of another’s satisfaction.
Domain 5: Overvigilance and 
InhibitionAs children these individuals were required to exhibit self-control in regards to spontaneity and pleasure and 
usually express pessimism and worry as if everything could fall apart. Core unmet need of spontaneity and 
play.
(14) Emotional Inhibition The individual expresses an 1. inhibition of anger, 2. inhibition of positive impulse, 3. difficulty expressing 
vulnerability, and 4. rationality at the expense of emotion.
(15) Unrelenting Standards The belief that one must attain an internalized standard of achievement and failing to do so will bring criticism. 
When maladaptive, the belief may manifest as 1. perfectionism, 2. Rigid rules and 3. preoccupation with time 
and efficiency.

schemas is assumed to initiate and perpetuate psycho -
logical distress and upon the triggering of early mala -
daptive schemas, the individual may employ one of 
three following categories of coping strategies: surren -
der, avoidance, and overcompensation. The combina -
tion of the maladaptive schema and the coping 
strategy utilized to help mitigate the distress from 
the activated schema describes the individual’s emo -
tional-cognitive-behavioural state or the individual’s 
schema mode (Bachrach & Arntz, 2021 ). Therefore, 
the weakening of the maladaptive schema modes 
and strengthening of a functional schema mode is 
frequently a therapeutic goal (Wibbelink et al., 2022 ). 
Accordingly, in ST experiential techniques address 
maladaptive schema modes, providing patients with 
the opportunity to emotionally process aversive child -
hood memories which results in a change in their 
symptoms and their EMSs (Yakın et al., 2020 ). Change 
is achieved through an increase in awareness, under -
standing of childhood origin as well as environmental 
triggers, and in turn replacement of maladaptive with 
adaptive schema (Young et al, 2003 ). Furthermore, 
gender-specific EMS patterns have been reported for 
some psychological problems (Cudo et al., 2022 ; 
Marengo et al., 2019 ; Pozza et al., 2020 ), implying that 
gender-specific EMSs could impact on the delivery of 
therapy
Given its efficacious treatment of various disorders, 
ST may show promising results for misophonia too. 
The current exploratory study attempted to further 
our understanding of misophonia by examining early 
maladaptive schemas relevant to misophonic distress 
and subsequent behavioural reactions and any poten -
tial gender-specific patterns. Since EMS have been 
implicated with other forms of psychopathology 
exploring such influences in misophonia can give 
meaningful insight. Additionally, just as with any psy-
chopathology, prevention and treatment initiatives 
can be advanced by the understanding of the asso -
ciated factors. The schemas identified therefore, may 
not only be amenable to modification through schema 
therapy as treatment, but core needs in childhood may 
be targeted as a prevention strategy in vulnerable 
populations.
Method
Participants
G*Power software (free download: www.gpower. 
hhu.de ) generated a sample size estimate based on 
the use of a fixed model multiple linear regression 
with 18 predictors. Cohen’s ƒ2 is a measure of effect size used for a multiple regression. Effect size mea -
sures for ƒ2are 0.02, 0.15, and 0.35, indicating small, 
medium, and large, respectively. In previous 
research, for most EMSs in various forms of psycho -
pathology, small to medium-sized effects have been 
reported (Bishop et al., 2022 ; Khosravani et al., 2017 ; 
Kim et al., 2013 ). Similarly, studies on gender differ -
ences in EMSs have revealed small to medium-sized 
effects (Janson et al., 2019 ; Shorey, Anderson, et al.,  
2012 ). Therefore, based on effect size confidence 
intervals in the small to medium range a minimum 
sample size of 217 was needed to detect an effect 
size of .10 at 80% power with an error rate probabil -
ity of p = 0.05. Also, as per Cohen’s suggestion, for an 
omnibus ANOVA of fixed effects of 15 variables 
across three groups (male, female and nonbinary), 
with a small to medium-sized effect, f2 of .20, a total 
sample size of 246 (82 individuals in each group) 
would be necessary. Assuming that up to 5% to 
10% of data might not be usable following data 
collection, we sought to recruit at least 280 partici -
pants for the study. Ethical approval (No. 2020-0779; 
10/29/2020) was granted by the Ethics Committee of 
the City University of New York and all procedures 
were conducted following the Declaration of 
Helsinki. Participant recruitment occurred between 
July 2021 and September 2021. Informed written 
consent was obtained from all participants. Any par-
ticipants either missing questionnaires or demo -
graphic data were excluded, leaving a sample of 
289. Next, Mahalanobis distance, Cook’s distance 
and leverage were used for multivariate outliers 
detection. Observations classified as outliers by at 
least two of the methods were removed leaving 
a final sample of 286 individuals. Ages ranged 
between 18 and 62 years (mean = 28.9 years, SD =  
8.69), and 186 were female (65%), 85 were males 
(29.7%) and 15 were non-binary (5.2%). The demo -
graphic characteristics of the sample are presented 
in Table 3.
Measures
Young schema questionnaire-short form (YSQ-SF) 
(Young, 1994 )
The YSQ-SF is a seventy-five-item self-report measure 
designed to assess early maladaptive schemas (EMS). 
Early maladaptive schemas can develop during child -
hood and onward through an individual’s lifetime. EMS 
are deeply rooted processes or themes that can give an 
individual set beliefs or perceptions about themselves 
and the world around them. Each item is rated on 
a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1=completely untrue 4

cients of the YSQ-SF subscales are provided in Table 4.
New york misophonia scale (NYMS; Barahmand 
et al., 2023 )
To measure symptoms of misophonia, a newly developed 
scale called the NYMS was used. This scale was chosen as 
the authors designed the scale as an instrument for 
screening for misophonia in non-clinical situations. 
Furthermore, the measure provides separate scores for 
the emotional distress, aggressive behavioural reactions 
and non-aggressive behavioural responses of individuals 
experiencing misophonia (Barahmand et al., 2023 ). The 
NYMS is a two-part self-report instrument assessing 
(1) the severity of emotional distress to misophonic trig-
gers and (2) the nature of behavioural reactions to 
misophonic triggers. Part 1 includes 25 triggers (e.g., 
someone chewing loudly) that are likely to elicit negative

a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0=never to 4=always , 
participants report how often they engage in each of 
those behaviours. A summation of the responses to 
items in each part yields a subscale score of emotional 
distress that can range from 0 to 100 and a subscale score 
of behavioural reactions ranging from 0 to 52. The beha -
vioural reactions component is further divided into two 
subscales, one measuring aggressive or confrontational 
coping responses and the other assessing non-aggressive 
avoidant coping. The scores of the two parts can be 
added to yield a total misophonia score which can 
range from 0 to 152. In this study, the scores on the first 
part (emotional distress), and the two subscale scores of 
the second part, aggressive behavioural reactions and 
non-aggressive behavioural reactions were used in the 
analysis of data. The NYMS is reported to have a well- 
established factor structure and sound psychometric 
properties (Barahmand et al., 2023 ). The NYMS has been 
reported to possess good internal consistency 
(Cronbach’s α for the full scale =.94, for the misophonic 
distress subscale =.94, and for the behavioural reactions 
subscale =.85; Barahmand et al., 2021 ). In the present 
study, the reliability for the emotional distress and beha -
viour reactions subscales and the total scale were found 
to be .91, .86, and .93, respectively.
Procedure
Participants were recruited from social media plat -
forms such as Reddit, LinkedIn, and Facebook as well 
as Survey Exchange sites such as “Survey Swap” and 
“Survey Tandem”. The questionnaires were made avail -
able using Microsoft Forms and the link was generated 
and distributed. Participants who accessed the link 
were prompted with a description of the study, infor -
mation about the researchers, and study directions. 
Contingent on providing informed consent to partici -
pate, access to the study questionnaires was granted. 
The next section that followed was general demo -
graphic questions followed by the Young Schema 
Questionnaire (YSQ; Young, 1994 ) and the New York 
Misophonia Scale (NYMS; Barahmand et al., 2023 ). At 
the end of the survey, participants were presented 
with a thank you message. Completion of the survey 
took, on average, 15–0 minutes to complete. No com -
pensation was offered. All procedures and recruitment materials were approved by the CUNY Queens 
College IRB.
Data analyses
Taking unequal sample sizes into account along with 
the small number of non-binary individuals (n = 15) in 
the study, gender differences in the study variables 
were first examined using a series of univariate 
ANOVAs with robust Welch F test. Since the assump -
tion of homogeneity of variance was not met for some 
variables, the Games-Howell post hoc test was used. To 
test the relationship between features of misophonia 
and EMS, Pearson’s bivariate correlation coefficients 
were calculated between NYMS and YSQ-SF scores. 
Coefficient values were interpreted as: 0 < r < ±|0.30|  
= weak, |0.30| <r < ±|0.50| = moderate, |0.50| < r < ±| 
0.70| = strong, > ±|0.70| = very strong. Steiger’s 
Z coefficients were computed to compare the strength 
of the correlation coefficients between the scores on 
each one of the NYMS scales and the scores on each 
one of the YSQ-SF scales. Multiple regression analyses 
were conducted by including age, gender, and YSQ-SF 
scale scores as predictors and NYMS scores (misopho -
nic distress, non-aggressive reactions, aggressive reac -
tions scores) as outcomes. Statistical analyses were 
conducted through SPSS version 25.0 with 
a significance level set at p < 0.05.
Results
Gender differences
Levene’s test indicated that homogeneity of variance 
was not met for the EMSs of emotional deprivation, 
abandonment, mistrust/abuse, entitlement and insuffi -
cient self-control. Therefore for these EMSs, the 
Welch’s F was used. All post hoc comparisons were 
made using the Games-Howell test because it provides 
high power while maintaining control over Type I error 
(Sauder & DeMars, 2019 ). Pairwise comparisons 
revealed gender differences on all the subscales of 
the NYMS as well as on abandonment, self-sacrifice, 
entitlement and failure schemas, with females scoring 
significantly higher scores than males on misophonic 
distress (Hedges’ g = .41), aggressive reactions 
(Hedges’ g = .39), non-aggressive reactions (Hedges’ 
g = .32), and on abandonment (Hedges’ g = .36), and 
self-sacrifice schemas (Hedges’ g = .47), and both males 
(Hedges’ g = .76), and females (Hedges’ g = .66), scor -
ing higher than non-binary individuals on the entitle -
ment schema. Males (Hedges’ g = .66) and females 6

(Hedges’ g = .31) also scored lower than non-binary 
individuals on the failure schema (See Table 4).
Correlations between age, EMS, and NYMS 
subscales
Pearson’s coefficients between age, NYMS, and YSQ-SF 
scores are presented in Table 5. Age correlated posi -
tively and weakly with the Distress subscale of the 
NYMS, and negatively and weakly with abandonment, 
defectiveness, failure, dependence, vulnerability to 
harm or illness, enmeshment, subjugation, and insuffi -
cient self-control schemas. All three subscales of the 
NYMS, distress, aggressive reactions, and non- 
aggressive reactions correlated positively with emo -
tional deprivation, social isolation, defectiveness, failure, 
vulnerability to harm or illness, and insufficient self- 
control. In addition, the unrelenting standards schema 
scale correlated positively with both the aggressive and 
non-aggressive reactions subscales of the NYMS. 
Furthermore, while the self-sacrifice schema showed 
a significant positive association only with the distress 
subscale of the NYMS, the entitlement schema showed 
a significant negative association only with the non- 
aggressive reactions subscale of the NYMS (sample 
item: I leave the place ), and the mistrust/abuse and 
subjugation schemas correlated positively only with 
the aggressive reactions subscale of the NYMS (sample 
item: I become verbally aggressive ). Steiger’s Z was used 
for testing the statistical significance of the difference 
between the correlations of each of the misophonia 
subscales with each of the schema scores. The results 
of Steiger’s Z tests showed no significant differences in 
the strength of the correlations.Predictive effect of EMS on misophonia subscales
Scatterplots showed that the relationships between 
each of the predictor variables and the criterion vari-
ables was linear. Analysis of collinearity statistics 
showed that the assumption was met as VIF scores 
were well below 10 (ranging from 1.3 to 3.1) and 
tolerance scores were above 0.2 (ranging from .31 to 
.72). The Durbin-Watson values were greater than 1.93 
indicating that the values of the residuals are indepen -
dent. Plots of standardized residuals versus standar -
dized predicted values suggest that the assumption 
of homoscedasticity has been met. Furthermore, the 
P-P plots for the models suggested that the assump -
tion of normality of the residuals have not been vio-
lated and Cook’s Distance values were all under 1, 
indicating that individual cases were not unduly influ -
encing the model. These findings indicate that the 
assumptions of multiple regression analyses have 
been met. The results of the multiple regression ana-
lysis are displayed in Table 6. Age, gender (dummy 
coded), and YSQ-SF scores were included as predictors 
and NYMS scores as outcomes. To get robust confi -
dence intervals and significance tests of the model 
parameters, the model was re-estimated using boot -
strapping. Bootstrap confidence intervals for each pre-
dictors and their significance values are displayed in

vulnerability to harm or illness, and insufficient self-

misophonic triggers were significantly predicted by 
lower scores on dependence and entitlement schemas 
and higher scores on unrelenting standards and insuf -
ficient self-control schemas (R2 = .155, F(18, 267) = 2.72, 
p < .001). Finally, total misophonia scores (R2 = .192, 
F(18, 267) = 3.54, p < .001) were predicted by age, female 
gender, higher scores on social isolation, vulnerability 
to harm and illness, and insufficient self-control sche -
mas. Scores on the other scales of the YSQ-SF did not 
significantly predict NYMS scores.
In conclusion, higher age and female gender were 
predictors of misophonic distress and aggressive reac -
tions. Among the EMSs, higher insufficient self-control 
EMS was a common predictor of misophonic distress 
as well as aggressive and non-aggressive reactions to 
misophonic triggers. Also, while higher social isolation/ 
alienation EMS was specifically predictive of misopho -
nic distress, vulnerability to harm or illness EMS which 
was a specific predictor of aggressive reactions to mis-
ophonic triggers and lower entitlement and higher 
dependence and unrelenting standards EMS were spe-
cific predictors of non-aggressive reactions to miso -
phonic triggers.
Discussion
This study was conducted to examine the early mala -
daptive schemas in misophonia and to determine simi -
larities and differences in schemas relevant to 
misophonic distress and subsequent behavioural reactions. Gender differences were observed with 
females endorsing higher abandonment and self- 
sacrifice EMS while males endorsed more entitlement 
EMS and nonbinary individuals reported significantly 
more failure EMS. While little research has focused on 
differences in the presentation of EMS between men 
and women, current findings are consistent with pre-
vious studies in which self-sacrifice EMS was found to 
be higher in women (Janson et al., 2019 ; Pauwels et al.,  
2018 ) and entitlement EMS was higher in men 
(Pauwels et al., 2018 ; Tremblay & Dozois, 2009 ). 
A study examining EMS and gender in an Indian sam -
ple (Jain & Singh, 2019 ) found no differences between 
men and women on the self-sacrifice and entitlement 
EMS and found men endorsing higher rates of several 
other EMSs. These studies did not include non-binary 
individuals. Some studies on clinical populations using 
the long version of the YSQ have reported that women 
score higher on most EMSs including abandonment 
and self-sacrifice (Janson et al., 2019 ; Shorey, 
Anderson, et al., 2012 ; Shorey, Stuart, et al., 2012 ). 
Other studies report either no gender difference 
(Janson et al., 2019 ; Shorey, Anderson, et al., 2012 ) or 
higher scores in women (Shorey, Stuart, et al., 2012 ) on 
these EMSs. As it pertains to gender and misophonia 
our findings reveal that female gender is significant to 
the experience of misophonic distress and to the 
expression of aggressive reactions to misophonic trig-
gers. These findings may reflect the finding of greater 
severity of misophonia in women (Siepsiak et al., 2020 ).Table 6. Bootstrap coefficients for significant effects of multiple linear regression of misophonic distress, aggressive

In this present study, social isolation emerged as 
a dominant schema predicting distress provoked by 
misophonic triggers, while insufficient self-control was 
found to be the dominant schema associated with 
both the aggressive and non-aggressive behavioural 
reactions to misophonic triggers. In addition, vulner -
ability to harm was associated with aggressive reac -
tions while unrelenting standards, high dependence/ 
incompetence and low entitlement were predictive of 
non-aggressive reactions.
The social isolation schema belongs to the discon -
nection and rejection domain and is the belief that one 
is different and alienated from the rest of the world. 
Individuals with this schema may avoid social contacts 
and social situations. Rouw and Erfanian (2018 ) found 
many sufferers of misophonia recollecting misophonia 
episodes that occurred in childhood. It is likely that the 
experience of distress and annoyance from exposure 
to misophonic triggers gradually strengthens the 
belief that these individuals are different from others, 
resulting in their withdrawal from others, or they may 
withdraw from social circles in an attempt to avoid the 
experience of distress and annoyance from misopho -
nic triggers. Previous research by Schröder et al. (2019 ) 
identified avoidance as one of the coping strategies 
that individuals diagnosed with misophonia adopt, 
and this also suggests the connection between social 
isolation and misophonia. Individuals with misophonia 
may be submitting or surrendering (Young et al., 2003 ) 
to their social isolation EMS when it is activated.
The insufficient self-control schema falls within the 
impaired limits domain and is reflected by a deficit in 
emotion regulation and impulse control (Young et al.,  
2003 ). The strong and significant association of the 
insufficient self-control schema with the emotional 
and behavioural aspects of misophonia implies that 
individuals with misophonia may have deficits in exer -
cising self-discipline, tolerating negative emotions, and 
controlling their impulses (Thimm, 2010 ), potentially 
resulting in a disregard for the rights of others. Dozier 
(2015 ) reported that when exposed to trigger stimuli, 
individuals with misophonia react with anger and with 
tension in the skeletal muscles which increases with 
the progressive worsening of symptoms. These find -
ings suggest that the insufficient-self control schema 
may be activated by such physical reactivity. Since the 
present study did not record the length of symptoms 
or physical tension, future studies are required to 
address the veracity of this implication. It is also plau -
sible that the two early maladaptive schemas of insuf -
ficient self-control and social isolation interact, with 
the difficulty of tolerating discomfort leading to 
increased social withdrawal.Differences were observed concerning the schemas 
associated with nonaggressive and aggressive beha -
vioural reactions to distressing misophonic triggers, 
with high dependence/incompetence, unrelenting 
standards and low entitlement characteristic of non -
aggressive reactions while high vulnerability to harm 
or illness was associated with aggressive reactions.
The dependence/incompetence EMS belongs to the 
impaired autonomy and performance domain and 
manifests as feelings of incompetence, insecurity and 
hypervigilance (Saritas-Atalar & Altan-Atalay, 2018 ). 
The association of the dependence/incompetence 
EMS with non-aggressive reactions may be indicative 
of deficiencies in emotion regulation as this EMS has 
been reported to be associated with both anxiety and 
depression (Saritas-Atalar & Altan-Atalay, 2018 ) and 
emotion regulation difficulties have been reported in 
misophonia too (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ; Guetta 
et al., 2022 ; Barahmand et al., 2023 ).
The unrelenting standards EMS is part of the over -
vigilance and inhibition domain and is characterized 
by perfectionism and rigidity (Young et al., 2003 ). 
Consistent with our findings, a recent study, Natalini 
et al. (2019 ) also found that the unrelenting schema 
was enhanced in patients with misophonia and comor -
bid personality disorders. Many studies have high -
lighted the relationship between perfectionism and 
misophonia and OCPD (Cowan et al., 2022 ; Edelstein 
et al., 2013 ; Jager et al., 2020 ; Schröder et al., 2013 ). The 
classification of unrelenting standards within the over 
vigilance and inhibition domain together with the cur-
rent finding that unrelenting standards EMS were pre-
dictive of nonaggressive reactions implies the 
compliance of these individuals with social norms to 
refrain from acting aggressively when exposed to mis-
ophonia triggers.
The entitlement schema was negatively associated 
with nonaggressive reactions. The entitlement schema 
is part of the impaired limits domain, suggesting 
a deficit in self-discipline, a tendency to be selfish 
and narcissistic and the belief that normal rules and 
conventions do not apply to them. Specifically the 
entitlement schema refers to the belief that one is 
superior to other individuals and includes the assertion 
of power to control the behaviour of others. Our find -
ings indicate a negative association between non- 
aggressive reactions and the entitlement schema 
implying that individuals with misophonia may con-
sider the behaviour of others to be “incorrect” when it 
is not in line with their desires, however they do not 
feel superior or of special privilege and, therefore, react 
non-aggressively to misophonic triggers so as to not 
violate social rules. Taken together, the emotional CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST

impulsivity of the insufficient self-control EMS and the 
deficiency in emotion regulation of the depencence/ 
incompetence EMS in conjunction with the rigid per-
fectionism of the unrelenting standards EMS and con-
formity of the low entitlement schema could explain 
the experience of emotional distress when exposed to 
misophonia triggers as well the nonaggressive reac -
tions to them.
The current study found that vulnerability to harm 
or illness, a schema within the impaired autonomy and 
performance domain, was related to aggressive reac -
tions. The vulnerability to harm or illness schema is 
seen in individuals hypersensitive to potential dangers 
and preoccupied with concerns about their inability to 
cope with them (Young et al., 2003 ). Misophonic trig-
gers activate the early maladaptive schemas which, in 
turn, activate cognitions, and the subsequent beha -
vioural reactions are mechanisms to cope with the 
cognitions and may or may not be adaptive. The mala -
daptive coping responses to a schema are surrender, 
avoidance or overcompensation (Young et al., 2003 ). 
Overcompensation for the vulnerability to harm 
schema is to act without regard towards danger 
which can include aggressive reactions. A bivariate 
analysis conducted by Shorey et al. (2015 ) revealed 
that the impaired autonomy and performance domain 
was positively associated with overall aggression, 
aggressive attitude, physical aggression, and verbal 
aggression; however, their regression model sug-
gested that the impaired autonomy and performance 
domain may not be a reliable predictor of aggression. 
In contrast, Şenkal Ertürk et al., (2020 ) found that the 
impaired autonomy schema domain was associated 
with low levels of aggression in adults. While our find -
ings seem consistent with the theoretical frameworks 
of Young’s theory, the contradictory findings regarding 
the associations of the impaired autonomy schema 
domain and aggression may mean that vulnerability 
to harm or illness alone is not enough to predict an 
aggressive reaction in individuals. Rather, other sche -
mas may act along with vulnerability to harm or illness 
to produce such aggressive behaviour. Our findings 
imply that the schemas leading to the behavioural 
reactions to misophonic triggers may be different. 
This is similar to the proposal of Dozier (2015 ) that 
emotional reaction to misophonia may be summoned 
by several factors that may not always result in an overt 
aggressive reaction. And this may be why some mis-
ophonics report attempts to resist aggressive impulses.
Based on previous research (Koerner et al., 2015 ; 
Mairet et al., 2014 ; Popa et al., 2017 ; Shorey et al.,  
2015 ), it appears that schemas within the disconnec -
tion/rejection and overvigilance/inhibition domains are common to both misophonia and anxiety disorders 
while those within the other-directedness domain may 
serve to distinguish misophonia from anxiety disor -
ders. Similarly, schemas associated with disconnec -
tion/rejection and impaired autonomy/performance 
domains that have been reported as significant pre-
dictors and maintaining factors of depressive symp -
toms (Tariq et al., 2021 ; Wegener et al., 2013 ) are also 
found to be associated with misophonia. Therefore, we 
see that misophonia, anxiety, and depression share the 
schemas associated with the disconnection/rejection 
domain, suggesting that an individual with any of 
these disorders tends to engage in avoidance coping 
strategies to avoid distress from unmet needs in social 
relationships which, in the long run, promotes further 
social withdrawal.
The insufficient self-control schema within the 
impaired limits domain appears to be the only one 
common across both misophonia and OCD, indicating 
that issues regarding setting personal and interperso -
nal limits are relevant to both these disorders. Overall, 
the finding that schemas from the disconnection and 
rejection domain are common to misophonia, anxiety 
and depression disorders, while schemas from the 
impaired limits domain are common to misophonia 
and OCD, suggests that misophonia is essentially 
a condition characterized by problems in emotion 
and impulse regulation
The early maladaptive schema model is the theore -
tical model in support of schema therapy that focuses 
on the identification and modification of EMS. Schema 
therapy has been documented to be effective for 
depression (Carter et al., 2010 ), anxiety and obsessive- 
compulsive disorders (Peeters, Passel, et al., 2021 ; 
Peeters, Stappenbelt, et al., 2021 ), and eating disorders 
(Calvert et al., 2018 ). Now that relevant early maladap -
tive schemas associated with misophonia have been 
identified, insight can be gained into early developmen -
tal correlates of misophonia and therapeutic interven -
tion through schema therapy may be implemented.
Limitations and future directions
The study has several limitations. Results and conclu -
sions are based on self-reported, retrospective 
responses collected largely from non-clinical English 
speaking participants who were primarily female. Also, 
the scale used to assess misophonia is a newly- 
developed instrument. Although the authors of the 
scale have reported sound psychometric properties, 
the scale has not yet been widely used, warranting 
replication of the current findings using other measures 
of misophonia. The low base rate of non-binary 10

individuals in the present study may have compromised 
the power. Power may also have been compromised 
due to multiple testing. Replication of the study with 
larger samples of non-binary individuals and replication 
focused on specific EMSs is recommended. Future stu-
dies comparing healthy controls with individuals scor -
ing high on misophonia is warranted. Yet, considering 
that our sample consisted of participants from a variety 
of countries with a range of scores on misophonia 
indicates that our results may be replicated. The finding 
of a positive association between insufficient self- 
control EMS and aggressive reactions to misophonic 
triggers indicates that it might be worthwhile to exam -
ine if there is an association with length of symptoms. 
Similarly, as the social isolation EMS associated with 
misophonic distress, future research into the relation -
ship between social withdrawal and misophonic distress 
may be of interest. Considering that intolerance of 
uncertainty and perfectionism have been found to be 
transdiagnostic factors, the role of these variables in 
misophonia needs to be empirically determined. 
Finally, given that misophonia overlaps with tempera -
mental factors as well (Daniels et al., 2020 ), the obtained 
associations between features of misophonia and EMS 
might be due to the shared influence of a third variable, 
such as neuroticism (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ). 
Future research may delineate the contributions of neu-
roticism and EMS to symptoms of misophonia. Since 
there was a connection between some early maladap -
tive schemas and misophonia, it can be stated that 
some individuals with misophonia could benefit from 
schema therapy. There has been no research that high -
lights the effect of schema therapy on misophonia, thus, 
further research should be implored to investigate these 
claims.
