Background and objectives: Misophonia is a recently identified condition characterized by negative emotional 
responsivity to certain types of sounds. Although progress has been made in understanding of neuronal, psy-
chophysiological, and psychopathological mechanisms, important gaps in research remain, particularly insight 
into cognitive function. Accordingly, we conducted the first neuropsychological examination of misophonia, 
including clinical, diagnostic, and functional correlates. 
Methods: A misophonia group (n 32) and a control group (n 64) were screened for comorbidities using a 
formal semi-structured interview and completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and self-report 
measures of depression, anxiety, stress, impulsivity, and functional impairment. 
Results: The misophonia group significantly underperformed the control group on only 2 neuropsychological 
outcomes involving verbal memory retrieval. Subscales of the Misophonia Questionaaire (MQ) were inversely 
correlated only with measures of attention. The misophonia group reported significantly higher anxiety symp -
toms, behavioral impulsivity, and functional impairments, and had numerically higher rates of ADHD and OCD. 
Limitations: To facilitate comparability, in lieu of a formal diagnostic algorithm for misophonia, we used a 
commonly used empirical definition for group allocation that has been utilized in numerous previous studies. 
Conclusions: Misophonia was associated with a reduction in performance on a minority of cognitive tasks and a 
modest increase in some psychological symptoms and comorbid conditions. Correlational data suggest that 
difficulties with attention regulation and impulsivity may play a role in misophonia, albeit attention functions 
were intact. Results should be interpreted with caution given the variability in diagnostic definitions, and more 
research is needed to understand cognitive functioning under ‘cold ’ conditions in misophonia.   
Misophonia is characterized by strong aversion to a range of pri-
marily human-produced sounds, including those related to eating (e.g., 
chewing, swallowing, slurping), nasal sounds (e.g., sniffing and 
inhaling), rustling sounds (e.g., paper, plastic), and repetitive tapping (e. 
g., pen clicking, foot tapping; Swedo et al., 2022 ; Swedo et al., 1989 ), 
although misophonia triggers may also include sounds produced by 
animals as well as some forms of visual movement, often termed miso-
kinesia (Hansen, Leber, & Saygin, 2021 ). Despite the variability in the 
type of trigger stimuli, misophonic responses to triggers involve a 
similar pattern of aversive physiological reactions and intense negative 
emotions including irritability, anxiety, and extreme anger (Edelstein, 
Brang, Rouw, & Ramachandran, 2013 ; Ferrer-Torres & Gim˘enez-Llort, 
2022 ). These may be accompanied by an impulsive behavioral response 
(Potgieter et al., 2019 ) such as verbal aggression (Schroder, Vulink, & 
Denys, 2013 ; Swedo et al., 2022 ); or by avoidance of the misophonic 
trigger (Potgieter et al., 2019 ). Notably, the misophonic response may include physical aggression, although research indicates that these re-
sponses are rather rare and more common in youth (Swedo et al., 2022 ). 
In the two decades since the term misophonia was first coined by 
Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2001) , researchers have reported that miso-
phonia is likely associated with rigidity and with deficient emotion 
regulation and impulse control (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ; Guetta, 
Cassiello-Robbins, Trumbull, Anand, & Rosenthal, 2022 ), and that fea-
tures of the stimuli such as volume are less important than the person ’s 
attribution of meaning to the action and sound, particularly the 
perception that the action and the sound produced are contextually 
inappropriate (Cowan, Marks, & Pinto, 2022 ). However, research on 
misophonia suffers from inconsistency across studies regarding core 
features, mechanisms, comorbidity, and prevalence; in part because 
formal diagnostic criteria for misophonia have not yet been established. 
For example, published estimates of the prevalence of misophonia range 
as widely as 5%–18% (Jakubovski, Müller, Kley, de Zwaan, &

2Müller-Vahl, 2022 ; Kılıç, Oz, Avano ˚glu, & Aksoy, 2021 ; Vitoratou et al., 
2023 ). As such, more research is needed to understand multiple aspects 
of misophonia (Cowan et al., 2022 ; Frank, Roszyk, Hurley, & McKay, 
2020 ). 
Evidence suggests that the misophonic reaction involves fight-or- 
flight sympathetic nervous system activation, and hyperactivity in the 
limbic system, particularly the amygdala (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Kumar 
et al., 2017 ). Indeed, the intense aversiveness of the misophonic sounds 
and associated emotional response often leads to broad avoidance of 
situations in which the triggering sounds are likely to be encountered, 
such as dinner with family and going out to restaurants or movie the-
aters, or excessively using headphones to avoid trigger sounds. Such 
behaviors may significantly impair family and social functioning (Pot-
gieter et al., 2019 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ). 
Initially, Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2014) suggested that misophonia 
is not associated with psychopathology. However, in light of accumu -
lating research, it is becoming increasingly clear that the condition is 
associated with elevated anxiety and stress symptoms and increased 
comorbidity with DSM disorders including anxiety disorders, mood 
disorders, personality disorders, obsessive compulsive-related disorders, 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), autism spectrum disorder, and 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Erfanian, Kartsonaki, & 
Keshavarz, 2019 ; Potgieter et al., 2019 ; Swedo et al., 2022 ). Although 
the lack of formal diagnostic criteria for misophonia precludes reliably 
characterizing comorbidity, it is clear from studies that use a range of 
criteria that misophonia frequently co-occurs with other clinically sig-
nificant psychological symptoms and disorders. For example, some 
studies report that more than half of their misophonia sample met 
criteria for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD, 54.4%; 
Schroder et al., 2013 ) which was considered by the authors as a risk 
factor for misophonia. They also speculated that ADHD (4.8%) may be 
related to misophonia due to distractibility and attentional shifts be-
tween visual and auditory cues (Schroder et al., 2013 ). Other studies 
found elevated comorbidity with OCD (15%), PTSD (15%) MDD (10%; 
Erfanian et al., 2019 ), and anxiety disorders (33%; Cassiello-Robbins 
et al., 2021 ). 
1.Cognitive function in misophonia 
Very little is known about cognitive functioning in misophonia, as 
few studies have been published to date (Daniels, Rodriguez, & Zabe-
lina, 2020 ; Eijsker, Schroder, Smit, van Wingen, & Denys, 2019 ; Frank 
et al., 2020 ). However, in examining cognitive functioning in miso-
phonia, it is important to recognize that the misophonic reactions and 
responses that may affect cognitive functioning occur in specific con-
texts. To that end it is useful to distinguish between ‘cold ’ cognitive 
functioning, which occurs under emotionally neutral conditions; and 
‘hot’ cognitive functioning, which occurs in response to emotionally 
charged conditions or stimuli. In a study of ‘hot’ cognitive functioning in 
misophonia using the Stroop paradigm, Daniels et al. (2020) found a 
larger Stroop effect among misophonia participants when continuous 
misophonic trigger sounds were played. Similarly, attention-related task 
performance was worse during misophonic provocation (Daniels et al., 
2020 ; Eijsker et al., 2019 ; Frank et al., 2020 ; Simner, Koursarou, Rinaldi, 
& Ward, 2021 ). Another study that used a dichotic listening task re-
ported that individuals with misophonia were significantly less accurate 
in identifying sentences while listening to misophonia trigger sounds (da 
Silva & Sanchez, 2019 ). 
To our knowledge only two studies have examined ‘cold ’ cognitive 
functioning in misophonia (i.e., cognitive functioning in the absence of 
misophonic provocation), neither of which found any performance dif-
ference between misophonia and control samples. Simner et al. (2021) 
found no differences in visual attention performance on an embedded 
figures attention task. Similarly, no misophonia-related deficits were 
observed on the Stop Signal Task, a measure of inhibitory functioning, 
when administered without misophonic provocation (Eijsker et al., 2019 ). Given the limited research to date in this area, the aim of the 
present study was to conduct a neuropsychological examination of 
misophonia, focusing on cold cognitive functioning. However, the 
absence of information about cold cognitive functioning in misophonia 
makes it difficult to draw clear directional hypotheses, particularly 
given that misophonia may not disrupt cognition outside the context of 
responding to provocation, and so any cognitive deficits may be 
observed primarily during exposure to misophonic trigger sounds. The 
aim of the present study is to provide comprehensive information 
regarding cognitive functioning without misophonic symptom provo -
cation, clinical and diagnostic status, and their association in misopho -
nia compared to a control group. 
2.Methods 
2.1. Participants 
The final sample of ninety-six participants was drawn from a larger 
sample (N 275) that was part of a large neuropsychological study at a 
university in the southwestern United States. Participants were recruited 
via flyers and recruitment emails distributed to students. Inclusion 
criteria included minimum age of 18, normal or corrected vision, and 
fluency in English. Exclusion criteria included age F65 or any history of 
major neurological conditions (e.g., epilepsy, brain injury). Participants 
were asked to avoid recreational drugs, prescription benzodiazepines, 
stimulant medications, or more than two alcoholic drinks in the 24 h 
prior to the experiment. The overall study sample consisted of 67 fe-
males (69.8%) and 29 males (30.2%) with an average age of 20.91 (SD 
2.87). The sample was ethnically diverse (See Table 1.). Because there 
are no formal diagnostic criteria for misophonia, we used the Miso-
phonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu, Lewin, Murphy, & Storch, 2014 ) to 
establish the misophonia and control groups. The MQ is among the most 
frequently used measures of misophonia (Rosenthal et al., 2021 ). The 
MQ guidelines suggest that a score of 7 or higher on the single item 
sound sensitivity severity scale is the optimal cutoff for identifying 
misophonia; this recommended cutoff has been used in numerous pre-
vious misophonia studies (e.g., Frank et al., 2020 ; Grossini et al., 2022 ; 
Guetta, Cassiello-Robbins, Trumbull, et al., 2022 ; McKay, Kim, Mancusi, 
Storch, & Spankovich, 2018 ; Schadegg, Clark, & Dixon, 2021 ; Zhou, Wu, 
& Storch, 2017 ). Following this recommendation, the misophonia group 
(n 32) consisted of participants that scored ≽7 on the MQ sound 
sensitivity item, and the control sample (n 64) included participants 
whose score was in the sample ’s lowest quartile on this item. Notably, as 
presented in the results section, the mean MQ subscale and total scores 
found in the present study were remarkably similar to scores found in 
previous studies, which facilitates comparability with the results of the 
present work. See Table 1 for demographic information. 
2.2. Materials 
2.2.1. Clinical measures 
Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview 7.0 (MINI; Sheehan 
et al., 1998 ). The MINI is a valid and reliable semi-structured screening 
interview for primary DSM-5 disorders. The MINI 7.0 has demonstrated 
good psychometric properties (Sheehan et al., 1998 ). 
Depression, Stress, Anxiety Scale-21 (DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovi-
bond, 1995 ). The DASS-21 is a self-report questionnaire that assesses the 
severity of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in the past week. 
Each item is scored from 0 – “did not apply to me at all” to 3 – “applied to 
me very much or most of the time”. The DASS-21 demonstrates very good 
psychometric properties (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995 ), including in 
clinical (Clara, Cox, & Enns, 2001 ) and non-clinical samples (Sinclair 
et al., 2012 ). In the present study, good to excellent reliability was found 
(Cronbach ’s α 0.92, 0.74, and 0.83, for the depression, anxiety, and 
stress subscales respectively). 
Six Item-State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6; Marteau & Bekker, A. Abramovitch et al.

Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry 82 (2024) 101897
31992 ). The STAI-6 is a 6-item short-form self-report questionnaire 
adapted from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The STAI-6 demon -
strates good internal consistency in clinical and non-clinical samples (α 
0.82; Marteau & Bekker, 1992 ), as well as in the present study (α 
0.86). 
The Eysenck Impulsiveness-Venturesomeness-Empathy Question -
naire (I-7; Eysenck, Pearson, Easting, & Allsopp, 1985 ) The I-7 is a 
54-item self-report questionnaire that utilizes a “yes or no” format and 
that includes three subscales: Impulsiveness, Venturesomeness (i.e., risk 
taking), and Empathy. The measure demonstrates good psychometric 
properties in non-clinical samples including good internal consistency 
(α 0.83; Eysenck et al., 1985 ). The outcome of interest in the present 
study was the I-7 Impulsiveness subscale score for which good internal 
consistency was found (α 0.83). 
Barkley Functional Impairment Scale (BFIS; Barkley, 2011 ). The 
15-item BFIS assesses functional impairment in multiple domains of 
everyday life (e.g., school/work, social). The BFIS demonstrates good 
psychometric properties (Barkley, 2011 ). Due to a technical error only 
the first 10 BFIS items were administered. However, the BFIS manual 
indicates that the measure was developed to allow utilizing each indi-
vidual item as a standalone functional construct and provides itemized 
norms. Thus, each item was used as a domain indicator and no summary 
score was computed. 
Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014 ). The MQ consists of 17 items and comprises three subscales: MQ-1, assessing types and 
degree of sensitivity to trigger sounds; MQ-2, assessing the misophonic 
behavioral response; and MQ-3, assessing severity of sound sensitivity. A 
score of 7 or higher on the sound sensitivity subscale (MQ-3) indicates 
clinically significant misophonia. This cutoff has been used in several 
previous misophonia studies (e.g., Guetta, Cassiello-Robbins, Trumbull, 
et al., 2022 ; Schadegg et al., 2021 ). The MQ demonstrates good psy-
chometric properties in non-clinical samples (Wu et al., 2014 ), as well as 
in the present study (α 0.83). 
2.2.2. Neuropsychological measures 
2.2.2.1. Executive functions. The Trail Making Test, Part B (TMB; Delis, 
Kaplan, & Kramer, 2001 ). The TMB is a subtest of the Trail Making Test 
that assesses attentional set shifting in the graphomotor modality. Par-
ticipants are instructed to draw a line connecting circled numbers and 
letters while alternating between numbers and letters in ascending 
order. The TMB ’s primary outcome measure is time to completion. 
The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST; Loong, 1990 ) is a well-known 
executive function test that assesses set shifting, concept formation, and 
utilization of feedback. A computerized version of the WCST was used in 
the present study. Outcomes of interest were percent perseverative er-
rors and the number of categories completed. 
The Tower of London (TOL; Shallice, 1982 ) assesses planning ability 
and problem-solving skills. This task requires participants to move beads 
to match model goal arrangements while following specific rules. A 
computerized version of the TOL was used. The total number of excess 
moves beyond the minimum required to complete all models was used as 
the outcome measure. 
Verbal Fluency (VF; Delis et al., 2001 ) includes two subtests, one of 
which involves phonemic/letter fluency and another involving cat-
egory/semantic fluency. The total number of words in each subtest was 
the outcome measure of interest. 
The Symbol Span Test (Wechsler, 2009 ) is a subtest of the Wechsler 
Memory Scale – IV (WMS-IV; Wechsler, 2009 ) that assesses visual 
working memory. Visual figures of various shapes are presented on a 
page, after which participants are presented with a recognition page that 
includes both target and distractor shapes. Examinees are to select the 
items that were previously viewed in the same sequence in which they 
had been presented. The outcome measure was total points earned. 
The Digit Span task (DS) is a subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelli -
gence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV; Wechsler, 2008 ) that assesses verbal working 
memory. The DS test includes 3 subtests, all of which involve hearing 
and recalling digit sequences of increasing length. DS Forward requires 
repeating digits in the same order they were presented, DS backward 
involves repeating digits in reverse order from their presentation, and 
DS sequencing requires that digits be recalled in ascending order. In the 
present study the DS subtests and the overall DS total score were used as 
outcome measures of working memory. 
The Conners ’ Continuous Performance Test – 3rd Edition (CPT-III; 
Conners, 2014 ) is a continuous performance test that evaluates atten -
tion, as well as processing speed and response inhibition. The number of 
commission errors serves as an indicator of response inhibition, with 
more commission errors reflecting worse response inhibition. 
2.2.2.2. Memory. The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT; Oster -
rieth, 1944 ) assesses visuospatial memory. In the present study, short 
delay (3 min), and long delay recall (30 min) were used as outcome 
measures. 
The California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT; Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, & 
Ober, 2000 ) is a word list-based auditory-verbal memory task that as-
sesses immediate and delayed verbal memory. The outcome measures 
used in the present study were the total number of words recalled 
correctly in both the short and long delay, and the cumulative number of 
words correctly recalled on trials 1–5. Table 1

42.2.2.3. Attention. The CPT-III (Conners, 2014 ) hit reaction time stan-
dard deviation (HRTSD) and omission errors were used as outcome 
measures to assess attention function. The number of omission errors 
reflects vigilance-related attention, with fewer omission errors indi-
cating better attention. 
2.2.2.4. Processing speed. The CPT-III (Conners, 2014 ) average hit re-
action time (HRT) in milliseconds for ‘go’ stimuli was used to assess 
processing speed. 
The Trail Making Test, part A (TMA; Delis et al., 2001 ) is a graph -
omotor task that involves drawing lines between numbered circles in 
ascending order. The TMA was used to assess processing speed as a 
function of completion time in seconds. 
2.2.2.5. Visuospatial function. The RCFT (Osterrieth, 1944 ) copy trial 
score was used as a measure of visuospatial function. 
2.3. Procedure 
Graduate student research assistants (RAs) underwent rigorous 
training conducted by the first and last authors, both experienced neu-
ropsychologists. Training included hands-on instructional training, 
multiple mock administrations of the neuropsychological battery and 
the MINI, examination of video recordings, as well as one-on-one in- 
person evaluations. At the end of each study session, RAs would score all 
measures and tests. Subsequently, to minimize errors, a dedicated data 
manager carefully reviewed all scoring for all participants prior to data 
entry. All participants were requested to avoid taking any stimulant 
medications, sedatives, or to consume more than two alcoholic drinks 
24 h prior to the time of assessment. Participants were seen individually 
in a quiet lab room, and after signing an informed consent, completed 
the MINI clinical interview, followed by the neuropsychological battery 
and the self-report questionnaires, the order of which was counter -
balanced. Self-report questionnaires were completed in the lab online 
via the Qualtrics secured online platform. Each session took ~3.5 h on 
average, including a 10-min break. All computerized tests and ques-
tionnaires were administered on identical laptops designated for the 
study. This study was approved by the Texas State University Institu -
tional Review Board according to the declaration of Helsinki. 
2.4. Analytic plan 
Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS v.27.0 (2020 ). 
Nominal demographic variables were analyzed using Pearson ’s Х2 tests 
(Fishers Exact Test correction was applied as needed), whereas group 
differences in continuous variables were assessed using analysis of 
variance (ANOVA). In cases of violations of homogeneity of variance, 
the Welch ’s statistic of robust test for equality of means was employed if 
needed (Welch, 1938 ) to maintain power while maintaining alpha at the 
desired level (Glantz & Slinker, 2001 ). Pearson zero-order correlations 
were used to assess associations between symptoms and neuropsycho -
logical outcomes. A clinical neuropsychological study was never con-
ducted before in misophonia and thus this report meets formal 
definitions of a pilot study (Everitt, 2021 ). Furthermore, since there are 
no previous published neuropsychological data on misophonia, and thus 
effect size estimation is not obtainable, power calculation was not per-
formed for the present investigation. However, our sample size (n 96) 
is much larger than the average sample size in non-pilot neuropsycho -
logical studies (Mean n 53; Bezeau & Graves, 2001 ). Furthermore, 
even though this is a pilot study, with a relatively large sample, we took 
a conservative approach to avoid familywise inflation of type I error and 
employed correction for multiple comparisons using the 
Holm-Bonferroni method (Holm, 1979 ). Effect size magnitude was 
interpreted based on Cohen ’s d (2013 ) where small, medium, and large 
effect sizes correspond to 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8, respectively. Additionally, all comparative analyses of neuropsychological outcomes were conducted 
on raw test scores. However, to facilitate interpretation of the test re-
sults, mean and standard deviations are also presented in standardized Z 
scores produced via test norms (see supplementary materials Table S1). 
3.Results 
3.1. Demographic and clinical variables 
No significant group differences were found in age, education, 
gender, race, or ethnicity (Table 1.). The total study sample was char-
acterized by a plurality of females (69.8%) which was more pronounced 
in the control group (75%) but with no significant group difference. The 
samples were ethnically and racially diverse with a numerical minority 
of participants identifying as White American (42.70%). As expected, 
the misophonia group scored significantly higher on all the MQ sub-
scores with very large effect sizes including on the intensity of range of 
trigger sounds (MQ-1, d 1.25), types and frequency of misophonic 
reaction (MQ-2, d 1.42), and overall severity of sound sensitivity (MQ- 
3, d 3.92) . Notably, the MQ mean sub-scores for both the misophonia 
and controls groups were found to be remarkably similar to those found 
in a number of previous studies (Frank et al., 2020 ; Grossini et al., 2022 ; 
McKay et al., 2018 ; Wu et al., 2014 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ). The misophonia 
group also presented with significantly higher levels of general anxiety 
as measured by the DASS-21 Anxiety (d 0.5), state-anxiety as 
measured by the STAI-6 (d 0.62), and impulsivity (d 0.71) as 
measured by the I-7. No significant group differences were found for 
depression and stress symptoms as measured by the DASS-21 although 
numerically the misophonia group scored higher than controls on the 
DASS-21 Depression (d 0.22) and Stress (d 0.41) scales (see Table 1). 
3.2. Neuropsychological test performance 
Group comparisons on all neuropsychological outcomes are pre-
sented in Table 2 by neuropsychological domains and subdomains. See 
standard Z scores computed using test norms in supplementary materials 
(Table S1.). For a graphic depiction see Fig. 1. 
3.2.1. Executive function 
No significant group differences were found on tests assessing set 
shifting (d range 0.27 –0.36), planning (d 0.16), working memory (d 
range 0.02 –0.33), or response inhibition (d 0.02). On tests of verbal 
fluency, although there was no significant difference on the letter 
fluency score (d 0.02), a significant difference that survived multi -
plicity correction was found for category/semantic fluency (d 0.47). 
Overall, a significant difference was found only on 1 out 12 executive 
function outcome measures. 
3.2.2. Memory 
No significant group differences were found on non-verbal memory 
performance as measured by the RCFT including the immediate (d 
0.20) and delayed memory (d 0.30) trials, both of which showed small 
effect sizes (see Table 2). In contrast, a significant group difference was 
found on the CVLT short delay recall on which the misophonia sample 
underperformed (d 0.63). This comparison survived correction for 
multiple comparisons . No significant differences were found for the 
CVLT sum of trials 1–5 or long delay recall. However, although not 
significant, small effect sizes favoring performance in the control group 
were found (d’s 0.37 and 0.44 respectively). 
3.2.3. Processing speed 
No significant group differences were found on the TMA (d 0.31), 
or the CPT-III task HRT (d 0.23). 
3.2.4. Attention 
No significant group differences were found in the number of CPT-III A. Abramovitch et al.

5omission errors (d 0.01) or HRTSD (d 0.21). 
3.2.5. Visuospatial function 
Finally, there was no significant difference on the RCFT copy trial 
between the misophonia and control groups (d 0.38). 
3.3. Comorbidity 
A series of Pearson ’s Х2 tests were conducted to compare the groups 
on DSM disorders as established via the MINI interview (see Table 3). 
The groups did not differ significantly on the overall percent of partic -
ipants meeting criteria for any DSM-5 disorder. However, although not 
statistically significant, the prevalence of OCD in the misophonia group 
(9.4%), was threefold higher than in the control group (3.1%). Similarly, 
within the misophonia group, the prevalence of ADHD (15.6%), any 
eating disorders (6.30%) and panic disorder (6.3%), was higher than the 
prevalence in the general population, and nearly twice that of the con-
trol group (ADHD, 9.4%; eating disorders, 3.1%, panic disorder 3.1%). 
3.4. Functional indices 
A series of ANOVAs was conducted to assess group differences in the 
BFIS functional indices (see Table 4). Self-reported functional impair -
ment scores were significantly higher for the misophonia group on 
functional domains including home-chores (d 0.47), money manage -
ment (d 0.61), and driving, (d 0.58) with small to medium effect 
sizes. In addition, the misophonia group scored significantly higher than 
controls on the BFIS total mean score (Total Mean Impairment; d 
0.53). Group comparisons on the mean percent impaired domains (i.e., 
the average percent of domains scores that met the test’s cutoff scores 
for impairment in each domain, across participants) indicated a signif -
icantly larger percent of impaired domains (d 0.64) in the misophonia 
group (27%) compared to the control group (11%). No significant dif-
ferences were found in any other BFIS domains. Nevertheless, numeri -
cally across domains, all BFIS functional domain outcomes exemplified 
worse functioning in the misophonia group. Notably, all mean domain 
scores within the two groups did not cross the BFIS normative cutoff 
scores to indicate a meaningful functional impairment (Barkley, 2011 ). 
3.5. Correlations between neuropsychological and misophonia outcomes 
Pearson ’s zero-order correlations were computed between neuro -
psychological outcomes and the MQ subscale scores within the miso-
phonia group, most of which were not significant (see Table 5). 
However, four of the correlations were significant. CPT-III number of 
omission errors (sustained attention) was significantly correlated with 
the MQ-1 (types and severity of misophonia triggers; r 0.41, p 
0.019), with the MQ-2 (types and severity of the misophonic reaction; r 
0.42, p 0.022), and with the total MQ score (r 0.42, p 0.022). 
Digit Span forward (working memory) was significantly negatively 
correlated only with the MQ-3 score (sound sensitivity; r -0.42, p 
0.018). These correlations survived multiplicity corrections. No other 
significant correlations were identified. 
3.6. Correlations between clinical symptoms and misophonia severity 
Correlations between general clinical symptoms and misophonia 
symptoms were examined separately for the misophonia and control 
groups. Correlations were computed between measures of anxiety, Table 2

6depression, stress, and impulsivity, and the three subscale scores of the 
MQ (see Table 6). Neither DASS-21 Depression nor DASS-21 Anxiety 
were significantly correlated with any MQ variables for either group. No 
significant correlations were observed between the STAI-6 (state anxi-
ety) and any of the MQ subtests for either group. 
Within the misophonia group, however, impulsivity (I-7) was found 
to be significantly and positively correlated with the MQ-2 subscale 
score (misophonic response; r 0.45, p 0.01), and MQ-3 (single item 
sound sensitivity/severity score; r 0.45, p 0.01), as well as MQ Total 
(r 0.48, p 0.009). No significant correlation was found between I-7 
Impulsivity and MQ-1 (types and severity of misophonic trigger sounds). 
Within the control group, significant positive correlations were found 
between the DASS-21 Stress subscale and the MQ-1 (r 0.36, p 
0.004), and MQ Total (r 0.33, p 0.01). No significant associations 
were found between the DASS-21 Stress and MQ subscales for the 
misophonia sample. 
4.Discussion 
The present study is the first examination of neuropsychological functions in misophonia, as well as potential clinical and functional 
correlates. 
4.1. Neuropsychological test performance 
The misophonia group performed similarly to the control group on 
nearly all neuropsychological tests (albeit numerically demonstrated 
generally lower performance), with only two outcome variables that 
differed significantly, both of which substantially involve verbal mem-
ory retrieval: Semantic (category) fluency, and CVLT short-delay free 
recall. Specifically, the misophonia group significantly underperformed 
on the CVLT short delay recall trial, with medium effect size (d 0.63) 
which substantially involves verbal memory retrieval processes. In 
addition, albeit not statistically significant, we found further indications 
of poorer verbal memory functioning in the misophonia group [CVLT 
number of words on trials 1–5 (d 0.37, p 0.08); CVLT long delay 
recall (d 0.44, p 0.06)]. Although verbal fluency tasks are often 
considered tests of executive functions, research suggests that phonemic 
(letter) fluency is a true executive function whereas semantic (category) 
fluency reflects verbal memory retrieval processes more than executive

7processes (Bieling, Israeli, & Antony, 2004 ). Indeed, imaging studies 
reveal that semantic verbal fluency is associated with the activation of 
left temporal regions, which are associated with verbal memory 
retrieval, whereas prefrontal cortex activation, which has been more 
closely linked with executive functions, is associated in phonemic 
fluency tasks (Ghanavati, Salehinejad, Nejati, & Nitsche, 2019 ). As such, 
the poorer performance on semantic fluency likely reflects reduced 
verbal memory retrieval and not reduced executive function perfor -
mance. Indeed, none of the several measures of executive function indicated significant underperformance by the misophonia group rela-
tive to the control group. It is unclear at present why verbal memory 
retrieval specifically would be affected more than other cognitive do-
mains in misophonia. However, functional, and structural imaging 
studies of misophonia suggests alterations in brain structures and 
functions associated with verbal memory retrieval, including the pre-
cuneus, and temporal lobe structures, including the hippocampus 
(Eijsker et al., 2021 ; Kumar et al., 2021 ; Neacsiu et al., 2022 ). 
Notwithstanding, it is notable that the magnitude of effect sizes 
(small-to-medium in magnitude) pertaining to verbal memory retrieval 
underperformance found in the present study did not reach a level of 
cognitive impairment on these tasks (for a discussion see Abramovitch, 
Short, & Schweiger, 2021 ). 
4.2. Correlations between misophonia symptoms and neuropsychological 
outcomes 
The majority of correlations examined between misophonia symp -
toms and neuropsychological performance were not significant. The 
only significant correlations were CPT Omission Errors (a computerized 
measure of sustained attention), which correlated with MQ-1 (number 
of types and severity of trigger sounds), MQ-2 (number of types and 
severity of misophonic response), and MQ-Total, but not with MQ-3 
(severity of sound sensitivity and associated impairment). In addition 
the DS Forward (working memory), was negatively correlated with MQ- 
3 only. No significant correlations were found on these indices in the 
control group. Notably, these results reflect cognitive functioning under 
‘cold ’ conditions, and not during symptom provocation. Thus, these 
correlations between misophonia severity and inattention found only in 
the misophonia group correspond to recent brain imaging findings 
indicating that misophonia is associated with functional alteration of 
neural connectivity at rest (i.e., not only during misophonic provoca -
tion). It has been argued that such alterations in functional connectivity 
may be a consequence of repeated misophonic experience (for a review 
see Neacsiu et al., 2022 ), and thus may explain why these associations 
are found under ‘cold ’ conditions. However, more research is needed to 
elucidate such alterations and their association with attentional func-
tioning in misophonia, particularly under ‘cold ’ versus ‘hot cognition ’ 
conditions. 
It is important to note, however, that these association were found 
only between two neuropsychological outcomes and misophonia 
severity. Given that psychopathology has generally been associated with 
reduced cognitive performance (Abramovitch et al., 2021 ), the general 
absence of correlations between self-reported misophonia severity and 
cognitive performance may seem surprising. However, research directly 
assessing associations between disorder-specific self-report severity 
measures and neuropsychological test performance usually yields 
modest associations at best (David, Zammit, Lewis, Dalman, & Allebeck, 
2008 ; McGrath et al., 2016 ; Woon, Farrer, Braman, Mabey, & Hedges, 
2017 ) and neuropsychological tests generally are considered poor pre-
dictors of the presence of any psychopathology (e.g., Abramovitch, 
McCormack, Brunner, Johnson, & Wofford, 2019 ). The modest nature of 
the associations may stem from the suboptimal psychometric properties 
of the measures involved, particularly given the known problem with 
ecological validity in neuropsychological tests (Zivin & Katon, 2015 ). 
The results of this study further indicate an absence of group dif-
ferences in the prevalence of comorbid DSM disorders. This is somewhat 
surprising given previous reports suggesting that misophonia is associ -
ated with psychopathology (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ; Potgieter 
et al., 2019 ), particularly OCD/OCPD and ADHD (Rouw & Erfanian, 
2018 ; Taylor, 2017 ) although some studies have not found substantially 
higher prevalence rates in misphonia samples (Jager, de Koning, Bost, 
Denys, & Vulink, 2020 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ). The lack of statistically 
significantly higher prevalence rates in the misophonia group may be 
attributable in part to the relatively small sample size (n 32), as the 
numerical prevalence rates in the present study were indeed higher in Table 5

8the misophonia sample in a pattern that echoes previous studies. These 
include a high prevalence of ADHD in the misophonia group (16%), 
which is more than three times higher than the prevalence of ADHD in 
US adults (4.6%; Song et al., 2021 ), and higher than the prevalence of 
ADHD found in the control group (9%). Similarly, albeit not statistically 
significant, the prevalence of OCD was also elevated in the misophonia 
group (9%) compared to the control group (3%). This prevalence rate of 
OCD within the misophonia group is nearly 8-fold higher than the 
prevalence in the general population (1.3%; Fawcett, Power, & Fawcett, 
2020 ). The same pattern was found for panic disorder in the misophonia 
sample (6%), which was twice as high as the control group (3%). 
Overall, despite a lack of statistically significant differences in preva -
lence rates between the misophonia and control groups, the misophonia 
group demonstrated numerically higher prevalence for conditions pre-
viously reported as more common in misophonia. 
In terms of clinical symptoms, there were no significant group dif-
ferences in depression and stress symptoms (albeit numerically, the ef-
fect size for stress was d 0.41 favoring controls, p 0.06). However, 
there were significantly elevated symptoms of general anxiety and state 
anxiety in the misophonia group compared to the control group, 
consistent with previous studies (Guetta, Cassiello-Robbins, Anand, & 
Rosenthal, 2022 ; Jager et al., 2020 ; Wu et al., 2014 ). Importantly, the 
present study revealed higher levels of self-reported behavioral impul -
sivity in the misophonia group compared to the control group. In 
addition, impulsivity was found to be significantly and positively 
correlated with the severity of misophonic behavioral response (MQ-2) 
and sound sensitivity (MQ-3), as well as with the MQ total score, but not 
with the number of types or intensity of trigger sounds (MQ-1). This 
finding supports research that suggests misophonia is related to 
emotional regulation and impulse control problems (Cassiello-Robbins 
et al., 2020 ). This is particularly important as emerging research is now 
considering how emotional dysregulation may play an important part in 
misophonia. Indeed, the role of ‘emotional impulsivity ’ (i.e., impulsive 
responsivity to emotions) has been subject to recent interest in psy-
chopathology research. Specifically, it has been suggested that 
emotional impulsivity may be important in our understanding of psy-
chopathology and may be transdiagnostic (for a review, see Carver, 
Johnson, & Timpano, 2017 ). 
4.3. Functional impairments 
Greater self-reported impairments were observed in the misophonia 
group in the domains home-chores (household chores and mainte -
nance), money-management (managing bills and debt), and driving 
(citations and accidents). In addition, the misophonia sample was found 
to have a significantly higher total mean impairment score as well a 
significantly higher percent of ‘impaired domains ’, defined as the 
number of items that received a score falling at or above the 93rd 
percentile divided by the total number of items scored. The results of this 
comparison indicated that the proportion of impaired domains in the 
misophonia sample was twice as high as controls. Interestingly, im-
pairments related to money-management and driving have been asso-
ciated with ADHD (Bangma et al., 2019 ; Vaa, 2014 ), which was a highly 
prevalent comorbidity in our misophonia sample. These results corre -
spond to other studies that found that misophonia is associated with 
functional impairments across multiple domains (Guzick et al., 2023 ; 
Jager et al., 2020 ; Remmert, Jebens, Gruzman, Gregory, & Vitoratou, 
2022 ; Rosenthal et al., 2022 ). Interestingly, a common domain of 
functional impairment in misophonia is associated with family life that 
has been found both in adults (Rosenthal et al., 2022 ) and youth (Guzick 
et al., 2023 ). The results of this study – although pointing to numerically 
elevated functional impairments in misophonia across domains – indi-
cate that there was no significant difference between the misophonia 
and control samples on the ‘home-family ’ domains. However, a signifi -
cant difference was found in the domains of ‘home-chores ’, and ‘money 
management ’, which was found to have the largest effect size. This discrepancy with the results of previous studies may be related to the 
fact that the present study examined active college students with 
misophonia, most of which do not live at home with their nuclear family 
and are required to function more independently. However, it is 
important to note that in the current study, review of BFIS test norms 
indicated that although the misophonia sample reported higher func-
tional impairment scores on these domains, these scores did not reach 
thresholds for impaired functioning on any of the domains. Notably, our 
review of the literature clearly indicates that there is a need for further 
research examining domain-specific functional impairment associated 
with misophonia. 
The present study has several strengths including being the first 
study to compare misophonia and control samples on a comprehensive 
neuropsychological battery, administration of a psychometrically valid 
semi-structured diagnostic interview, assessment of everyday func-
tioning, and employment of correction for multiplicity. However, this 
study is not without limitations. First, the misophonia group sample size 
was relatively small, with a control/misophonia participant ratio being 
2:1. Second, caseness was determined using the MQ3 impairment scale 
cutoff which does not directly assess misophonia symptoms but rather 
impairments resulting from sound sensitivity. However, in lieu of a 
formal categorical diagnostic algorithm, and given that used for this 
cutoff results in significant overall group differences on the MQ1 and 
MQ2, and to facilitate comparisons with previous research, we opted to 
use the MQ3 cutoff. Another limitation of this study is that we did not 
assess or rule out hyperacusis which may be important for future studies. 
In addition, there were two technical issues in this study. First, due to a 
technical error, only ten out of the fifteen BFIS items were administered. 
However, as per the BFIS manual (Barkley, 2011 ), each item is a 
standalone domain with its own norms, and thus the present study was 
able to examine 10 functional domains – which, to our knowledge, is the 
first examination of real-life functional indices in misophonia. Addi-
tionally, due to a technical error, raw data from the CPT-III test was 
available only for a small subsample, however standard t scores pro-
duced by the program were available for all participants and were used 
in the final analyses. Furthermore, this study sample comprised college 
students which may limit generalizability. Indeed, prior studies have 
demonstrated that enrolled college students with or without psychopa -
thology may exhibit somewhat better cognitive functioning (e.g., 
Guerra-Carrillo, Katovich, & Bunge, 2017 ; Twamley, Hami, & Stein, 
2004 ). This effect may reflect the influence of selection bias (e.g., stu-
dents with psychopathology who are able to remain in college may have 
characteristics making them more cognitively “resilient ”), cognitively 
beneficial effects of college (e.g., daily engagement in cognitively 
challenging tasks; engaging with novel and abstract topics; engaging in 
planning related to time management and meeting deadlines), or a 
combination of the two. To the extent that active enrollment in college 
reduces the association between psychopathology and cognitive 
dysfunction, the current study may underestimate the degree of 
misophonia-related cognitive underperformance in non-college student 
populations. Nevertheless, it is important to note that control sample 
participants were not excluded if they met criteria for DSM disorders, 
and in fact, the rates of non-misophonia psychopathology did not differ 
significantly between the samples. Given that most neuropsychological 
studies utilize control samples screened for psychopathology and 
neurological conditions, differences discovered in the present study may 
lend more credibility compared to a study with a highly screened control 
sample. However, this study is the first of its kind in misophonia, and 
much more neuropsychological research is needed in misophonia across 
different samples, particularly in community and clinical samples. 
5.Conclusions 
The goal of the present study was to conduct the first neuropsycho -
logical study of misophonia in the context of ‘cold ’ cognitive function. 
We identified poorer verbal memory retrieval in misophonia but there A. Abramovitch et al.

9was no indication of a meaningful impairment. In addition, although 
there was no difference in sustained attention measures between the 
groups, there was a negative association between attention functions 
and misophonia symptoms only in the misophonia group. Furthermore, 
the results of the present study support the role of behavioral/emotional 
impulsivity in misophonia, which was related to the misophonic 
response and sound sensitivity but not with the extent and severity of the 
emotional reaction to trigger sounds. These findings are in line with 
recent research. We also found elevated rates of OCD and ADHD in the 
misophonia sample. However, since this is the first study of its kind, and 
given the dearth of research on ‘cold ’ cognitive function research in 
misophonia, the results of this study should be viewed as preliminary 
and should be replicated in the various relevant samples (e.g., psychi -
atric samples, audiology samples). Indeed, there is an urgent need for 
further research into misophonia, particularly neuropsychological in-
vestigations that incorporate psychopathological indices.
