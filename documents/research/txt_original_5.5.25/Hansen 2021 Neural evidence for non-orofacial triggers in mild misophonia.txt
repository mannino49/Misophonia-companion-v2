Misophonia, an extreme aversion to certain environmental sounds, is a
highly prevalent yet understudied condition plaguing roughly 20% of the
general population. Although neuroimaging research on misophonia is scant,
recent work showing higher resting-state functional connectivity (rs-fMRI)
between auditory cortex and orofacial motor cortex in misophonia vs.
controls has led researchers to speculate that misophonia is caused by
orofacial mirror neurons. Since orofacial motor cortex was deﬁned using rs-
fMRI, we attempted to theoretically replicate these ﬁndings using orofacial
cortex deﬁned by task-based fMRI instead. Further, given our recent work
showing that a wide variety of sounds can be triggering (i.e., not just
oral/nasal sounds), we investigated whether there is any neural evidence
for misophonic aversion to non-orofacial stimuli. Sampling 19 adults with
varying misophonia from the community, we collected resting state data
and an fMRI task involving phoneme articulation and ﬁnger-tapping. We
ﬁrst deﬁned “orofacial” cortex in each participant using rs-fMRI as done
previously, producing what we call resting-state regions of interest (rsROIs).
Additionally, we functionally deﬁned regions (fROIs) representing “orofacial” or
“ﬁnger” cortex using phoneme or ﬁnger-tapping activation from the fMRI task,
respectively. To investigate the motor speciﬁcity of connectivity differences,
we subdivided the rsROIs and fROIs into separate sensorimotor areas based on
their overlap with two common atlases. We then calculated rs-fMRI between
each rsROI/fROI and a priori non-sensorimotor ROIs. We found increased
connectivity in mild misophonia between rsROIs and both auditory cortex and
insula, theoretically replicating previous results, with differences extending
across multiple sensorimotor regions. However, the orofacial task-based
fROIs did not show this pattern, suggesting the “orofacial” cortex described
previously was not capturing true orofacial cortex; in fact, using task-based
fMRI evidence, we ﬁnd no selectivity to orofacial action in these previously
described “orofacial” regions. Instead, we observed higher connectivity
between ﬁnger fROIs and insula in mild misophonia, demonstrating neural

evidence for non-orofacial triggers. These results provide support for a
neural representation of misophonia beyond merely an orofacial/motor origin,
leading to important implications for the conceptualization and treatment
of misophonia.

Introduction
Imagine experiencing the same sense of anxiety, panic, or
rage you feel toward the sound of nails scraping chalkboard
to innocuous soft sounds in the environment, like chewing,
breathing, or tapping. This is the reality for individuals with
misophonia, a highly prevalent yet understudied disorder of
sound processing. A consensus deﬁnition describes misophonia
as a decreased sound tolerance to speciﬁc sounds or stimuli
associated with the sounds, resulting in strong negative
emotional, physiological, and behavioral responses not seen
in other people (Swedo et al., 2021). Anecdotal reports
from suﬀerers reveal serious daily impairments attributable to
misophonia–job instability, deteriorating relationships, suicidal
thoughts (Edelstein et al., 2013; Rouw and Erfanian, 2017; Swedo
et al., 2021)–yet the condition is severely understudied with
mechanisms vastly unknown.
At the time of this writing, 105 peer-reviewed misophonia
articles exist on PubMed. Only seven of these articles,
however, investigate this disorder using magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). MRI research enables a non-invasive and
in vivo assessment of pathophysiology, neural mechanisms,
and treatment strategies that have been instrumental to
understanding other disorders (Dijkhuizen and Nicolay, 2003).
In fact, neural markers based on functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) during rest have been identiﬁed and proposed
for various psychopathologies, such as obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) (e.g., Takagi et al., 2017), schizophrenia (e.g.,
Chahine et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020), and bipolar disorder
(e.g., Magioncalda et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2020). Are there
neural markers for misophonia?
One of the ﬁrst fMRI studies of misophonia found that
individuals with misophonia showed signiﬁcant diﬀerences
as compared to healthy controls in the anterior insular
cortex, speciﬁcally when presented with triggering auditory
stimuli (Kumar et al., 2017). The anterior insular cortex has
been implicated in a wide variety of functions, including
subjective evaluation of pain (Brooks et al., 2002), goal-
directed attentional control (Eckert et al., 2009; Nelson et al.,
2010), interoception (Wang et al., 2019), and processingof disgust (Krolak-Salmon et al., 2003). Other fMRI work
showed increased activation in the insula, anterior cingulate
cortex, and superior temporal cortex (i.e., auditory cortex)
in misophonia participants when presented with video clips
depicting triggering actions, as compared to generally aversive
actions or neutral actions (Schröder et al., 2019).
Previous work has also explored connectivity diﬀerences
in misophonia. A recent study used diﬀusion weighted
imaging (DWI) (a measure of structural connectivity and
white matter tracts) and found that, as compared to healthy
controls, individuals with misophonia had greater white
matter volumes in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus,
anterior thalamic radiation, and corpus callosum (Eijsker et al.,
2021a). Additionally, several misophonia studies have explored
functional connectivity, measured by correlating the fMRI
activation of various regions of interest (ROIs) across time
either during a task or while the brain is at rest, eﬀectively
measuring to what extent the ROIs spontaneously activate
together. One study noted signiﬁcant functional connectivity
associated with misophonia between the anterior insular cortex
and (a) posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus; (b) ventromedial
prefrontal cortex; (c) hippocampus; and (d) amygdala (Kumar
et al., 2017), a subcortical structure often implicated in emotion
processing and regulation (Phillips et al., 2003; Ochsner et al.,
2012). Another found increased functional connectivity in
misophonia (a) between the amygdala and cerebellum and (b)
within the lateral occipital/fusiform area of the ventral attention
network (Eijsker et al., 2021b).
Most recently, Kumar et al. (2021) introduced a new
hypothesis about the neural origins of misophonia using resting-
state functional connectivity (rs-fMRI) within motor cortex,
motivated by the use of mimicking movements as a common
coping mechanism for suﬀerers (Edelstein et al., 2013). Mirror
neurons in motor cortex would presumably be activated simply
by seeing or hearing sensory input (e.g., the sound of chewing
would evoke activity within the part of motor cortex responsible
for chewing motions, even when performed by others) (see
“audiovisual mirror neurons, ” Kohler et al., 2002). (Kumar et al.,
2021) therefore investigated the connectivity between auditory
cortex (where sound is processed) and orofacial motor and

premotor cortex (where chewing motions originate). Their data
show that the orofacial region within the ventral premotor
cortex is more strongly connected to the planum temporale
and to the anterior insula in individuals with misophonia
compared to healthy controls. The planum temporale functions
as higher-level auditory cortex, often associated with speech
comprehension (Shapleske et al., 1999) and the analysis of
many types of complex sounds more broadly (Griﬃths and
Warren, 2002). Since the ventral premotor cortex is thought
to be a key hub of the mirror neuron system (Rizzolatti and
Craighero, 2004; Iacoboni and Dapretto, 2006; Kumar et al.,
2021), conclude that misophonia is the result of hyperactivity of
the mirror neurons in orofacial motor cortex, suggesting that the
action of the trigger person is more important than the sound
that is produced and providing what they call the “motor basis
of misophonia.”
While these previous studies provide a foundation for
future neuroimaging research on misophonia, there remain
numerous gaps in this literature. First, the two task-based
fMRI experiments on misophonia so far have assumed that
misophonia is mainly an aversion to oral/nasal sounds. This is
reﬂected both in the types of participants eligible for their studies
and in the sound stimuli used in their tasks. For instance, Kumar
et al. (2017, 2021) speciﬁcally recruited misophonic individuals
who had oral/nasal sounds as triggers, then exclusively used
human-produced oral/nasal sounds to comprise their “trigger”
category. Schröder et al. (2019), Eijsker et al. (2021a,b) used
in-house diagnostic criteria to assess their participants, which
requires that human-produced oral/nasal sounds be a trigger
to be diagnosed (Schröder et al., 2013; Jager et al., 2020).
However, it is clear from both anecdotal self-reports and clinical
interviews (e.g., Hadjipavlou et al., 2008; Edelstein et al., 2013;
Ferreira et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2013; Neal and Cavanna,
2013; Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2014; Webber et al., 2014) as
well as large-scale sound bank experiments employing machine
learning (Hansen et al., 2021) and a consensus based on meta-
analysis (Swedo et al., 2021) that individuals with misophonia
are bothered by more than just oral/nasal sounds; restricting
the condition to study just those triggers is likely to miss
important ﬁndings.
Further, previous work may be biased by the construction
and discussion of ROIs. For instance, Schröder et al. (2019)
deﬁned and analyzed activation in the entire insula but spoke
of their signiﬁcant results as “conﬁrming” the Kumar et al.
(2017) anterior insula ﬁnding. Kumar et al. (2021) used only
the anterior insula as a seed region based on their prior results,
sidestepping any role the posterior insula might play, despite
the posterior insula’s known involvement in sensorimotor and
auditory processing (see Uddin et al., 2017). Interestingly,
Kumar et al. (2021) built their claims around an orofacial
motor region, deﬁned by “the part of vPMC [PMv] which
showed stronger connectivity to planum temporale in resting-
state.” Given the planum temporale is known for processinghigher level auditory information, it is not clear why the part
of motor cortex most strongly connected to auditory cortex
would be selectively related to the mouth and face. Moreover,
previous research may have encountered common issues with
ROI-based connectivity analyses. For example, deﬁning an ROI
using functional connectivity and then analyzing functional
connectivity of that same ROI to depict diﬀerences between
misophonia and control groups, while orthogonal, is a circular
analysis that may distort results when performed in the same
sample (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009); when deﬁned in one sample
and overlaid onto a separate sample, circularity is avoided but
individual variability in connectivity patterns is washed out (e.g.,
seeSupplementary Figure 2 for example individual variability
in ROI deﬁnition). Using task-based fMRI instead to localize an
orofacial motor area and then exploring its connectivity with an
rs-fMRI analysis on independent data within the same subject
would remove these potential biases.
Lastly, the previous fMRI studies draw deﬁnitive
conclusions from data that would beneﬁt from stronger control
conditions and tests of speciﬁcity. For example, Schröder
et al. (2019) contrasted activation while watching trigger
videos–which included both audio and visual stimulation–with
a neutral condition in which videos depicted soundless activities
(which would not elicit auditory activation like the trigger videos
would). One cannot therefore conclude that “misophonia is
associated with altered brain activity in the auditory cortex”
because it may simply be a result of experimental design.
Similarly, Kumar et al. (2021) focused on orofacial cortex within
PMv, without exploring either (a) orofacial cortex in other
motor/sensory regions (e.g., orofacial cortex deﬁned in PMd),
or (b) cortex representing non-orofacial body parts. This lack of
dissociation begs for further research to make a more deﬁnitive
claim that misophonia has a “motor basis.”
The present study seeks to ﬁll in these important gaps
and help clarify some of the seemingly conﬂicting claims
about which particular brain regions and/or connections
are responsible for misophonia. Our ﬁrst objective was to
theoretically replicate the results of Kumar et al. (2021), using
an orofacial region that is functionally deﬁned from task-based
fMRI instead of estimated from resting-state connectivity. We
know that functionally deﬁning ROIs is more ecologically valid
and better captures individual variability in cortical locations
(Swallow et al., 2003; Saxe et al., 2006). If this functionally
deﬁned orofacial region likewise shows higher connectivity to
planum temporale and insula in individuals with misophonia
compared to controls, we can be more conﬁdent in the motor-
basis ﬁnding. Second, we sought to investigate the selectivity of
sensorimotor orofacial involvement in misophonia. Kumar et al.
(2021) restricted their claims to orofacial motor and premotor
regions, but given the high variation in experienced misophonia
triggers, we expand the present analyses to include (a) a broader
portion of sensorimotor cortex, and (b) cortex functionally
linked to ﬁnger tapping.

Materials and methods
Participants
Twenty adults participated in this study. One adult was
excluded for excessive motion (see Section “Resting state”
below), resulting in nineteen adults (14 females, 5 males, mean
age = 25.6) included in the present analyses. Of the nineteen
adults, ﬁve identiﬁed as Asian, two as Middle Eastern, one as
Latino, and the rest as Caucasian. All participants were recruited
via advertisements on social media, ﬂyers, and study websites.
Participants were part of a larger ongoing longitudinal study of
brain development and were paid a total of $30 for participating
in the neuroimaging protocol.
All experimental methods were approved by The Ohio State
University Institutional Review Board, and all participants gave
informed consent to participate.
Misophonia questionnaires
Each participant’s level of misophonia was determined using
three misophonia assessment surveys available at the time of
data collection. All participants completed the Misophonia
Activation Scale (MAS-1) (Fitzmaurice, 2010), the Misophonia
Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ-2) (Johnson, 2014), and the
Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S) (Schröder et al.,
2013). Using a composite score that equally weighted the three
misophonic assessment surveys (see Supplementary Table 1),
with higher scores denoting more severe misophonia, the
19 participants had misophonia scores ranging from 0 to
37.3 out of 100.
For analyses comparing group means, we recreated
the binary group division of Kumar et al. (2021) by
splitting our sample post hoc using a score of 20 as cutoﬀ,
resulting in seven individuals with higher misophonia scores
(mean = 28.7, range = 20.5–37.3; four females, three males;
mean age = 24.2) and twelve individuals with lower misophonia
scores (mean = 9.6, range = 0–17.7; nine females, three males;
mean age = 26.4). This subdivision was further supported by
individual scores on the A-MISO-S (Supplementary Table 1)
and the suggested subdivisions provided by the authors
(Schröder et al., 2013): individuals in the “higher misophonia”
group all scored above 4 on the A-MISO-S (Mean = 7.7,
SD = 1.1, Range = 6–9), corresponding with “mild” misophonia,
whereas individuals in the “lower misophonia” group all scored
below 4 (Mean = 2.2, SD = 1.5, Range = 0–4), corresponding
with “subclinical” misophonia. For comparison, the misophonia
group in Kumar et al. (2021) scored an average of 15.5 (SD = 3.4)
on the A-MISO-S, corresponding with “severe” misophonia;
scores are not reported for the control group.
Additionally, to probe any comorbid eﬀects with
other psychopathologies, all participants completed theObsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) (Foa et al.,
2002) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21)
(Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995).
Neuroimaging procedure
Acquisition
Scan parameters
All neuroimaging data were acquired at the Center for
Cognitive and Behavioral Brain Imaging at The Ohio State
University on a Siemens 3T Prisma scanner using a 32-channel
head coil. A 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with
gradient echo (MPRAGE) structural scan was acquired on all
participants with high-resolution (1 mm3). Resting-state MRI
data were acquired with a scan lasting approximately 10 min
(TE = 28 ms, TR = 1000 ms, voxel size = 2 mm 2 mm3 mm,
ﬂip angle = 61, 56 slices, 580 volumes). Task fMRI data were
also acquired on all participants (TE = 28 ms, TR = 1000 ms,
voxel size = 2 mm 2 mm3 mm, 56 slices, 186 volumes).
Functional magnetic resonance imaging task
As part of a larger neuroimaging protocol studying
speech and language development, all participants completed
an articulatory localizer consisting of alternating blocks of
phoneme speech production, ﬁnger-tapping, and rest. At the
beginning of each block, an image of a mouth or a hand
was shown on the monitor. When shown the image of the
mouth, participants were instructed to physically vocalize the
syllables “BA GA RA DA ” continuously until the image of
the mouth was removed from the screen. When shown the
image of the hand, participants were instructed to tap their
ﬁngers one at a time, from foreﬁnger to pinky and back again,
continuously until the hand was removed from the screen.
The instruction image was presented at the start of each block
for 2 s. Each of the two conditions was presented for 16 s
blocks, and each condition block was presented four times per
run. All participants included in the present study completed
at least one run of this articulatory localizer; 11 participants
completed two runs.
Pre-processing
Resting state
Resting-state pre-processing was performed using
Freesurfer’s FS-Fast pre-processing pipeline.1Framewise
displacement was calculated for use as a motion regressor.
Masks of white matter, cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), and
subcortical structures were then generated in each participant’s
native space. Next, spatial smoothing was performed using
the subcortical mask, and functional data were interpolated
over motion spikes. Bandpass ﬁltering was then applied

to the functional data, using a low threshold of 0.009 Hz
and a high threshold of 0.08 Hz; temporal ﬁltering reduces
physiological noise given the short TR (Birn, 2012). Last,
data were denoised using CSF and white matter masks and
timepoints with framewise displacement greater than 0.5 mm
were censored from the data.
Pre-processed resting state data and censored timepoints
were visually inspected to remove potential outliers. One
participant of the original 20 had 237 censored timepoints
(40.9%) and was thus removed from further analyses. The
remaining 19 participants had low motion (mean censored
timepoints = 3.1, range = 0–13). Quantity of censored time
points was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between participants with
higher vs. lower misophonia scores (t (17) = 1.196, p= 0.248).
Functional magnetic resonance imaging task
All task data were also pre-processed using Freesurfer’s FS-
Fast pre-processing pipeline. Each run was motion corrected to
the ﬁrst timepoint of the run, and timepoints with movement
over 1 mm were removed from the analysis. Motion corrected
volumes were registered to each participant’s native space. Data
were then smoothed using a 4 mm full-width/half-maximum
Gaussian kernel and convolved with a canonical hemodynamic
response function.
Contrasts were calculated using FS-Fast, speciﬁcally for
phoneme articulation (P) minus ﬁnger-tapping (T), or P >T.
The reverse contrast, T >P , was calculated by taking the negative
activation of the P >T contrast. Masks of signiﬁcant data were
resampled to 1 mm isotropic voxels and then registered to each
participant’s anatomical scan and resting-state native space. All
analyses presented here use contrasts deﬁned in the ﬁrst task run
unless otherwise noted.
Deﬁning regions of interest
Non-sensorimotor regions of interest
A priori ROIs from previous literature were deﬁned
anatomically in each participant’s native space (Figure 1),
using both the Destrieux atlas (Destrieux et al., 2010) and
the Glasser atlas (Glasser et al., 2016). The Destrieux atlas,
deﬁned in each participant’s native anatomical space through
Freesurfer,2was registered to each participant’s native resting-
space. The Destrieux atlas was used to deﬁne primary auditory
cortex (Heschl’s Gyrus, A1), secondary auditory cortex (Planum
Temporale), and the amygdala. The Glasser atlas, originally
obtained on the fsaverage surface, was transferred to each
participant’s native resting-state space using Freesurfer. The
Glasser atlas was used to deﬁne posterior, middle, and anterior
subdivisions of the insula.
2 https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/recon-allDeﬁning motor masks
To attempt to theoretically replicate the motor ﬁnding from
Kumar et al. (2021), we used their same method of overlaying
a motor mask from the Human Motor Area Template (HMAT)
(Mayka et al., 2006). The HMAT atlas was ﬁrst registered from
Talairach space to each participant’s native anatomical space,
then registered to the participant’s resting-state native space. The
HMAT atlas subdivided each participant’s sensorimotor area
into four regions: primary somatosensory cortex (S1), primary
motor cortex (M1), dorsal premotor area (PMd), and ventral
premotor area (PMv) (Figure 2A).
Additionally, to expand the sensorimotor analysis and
ensure that the use of a speciﬁc atlas did not inﬂuence the results,
we used the Desikan Freesurfer parcellation in native anatomical
space (Desikan et al., 2006) to identify the precentral and
postcentral gyri (Figure 2B). These regions were chosen because
of their canonical association with primary motor and primary
somatosensory cortices, respectively. Since the precentral and
postcentral gyri are deﬁned using each individual’s anatomy as
opposed to overlaying an atlas, it is possible this method will
better capture individual nuances in cortical location.
Deﬁning orofacial cortex
Method 1: Resting-state region of interest
First, we applied the method used by Kumar et al. (2021)
to identify an orofacial resting-state region of interest (rsROI)
in each individual. Speciﬁcally, we located the part of PMv that
showed the strongest resting-state connectivity to the planum
temporale. To do so, we averaged together the time courses of
each voxel comprising the planum temporale, resulting in one
vector representing the overall time course from the region.
We then correlated that vector with the time course of each
voxel within the PMv mask separately (for more detail, see
“calculating functional connectivity” below), and sorted the
connectivity values from largest to smallest. To maintain ROIs
of similar sizes across analyses, we kept the top 10% of voxels
from within PMv that had the highest connectivity to the
planum temporale. This calculation was done in all nineteen
participants individually, and the resulting voxels comprised
that participant’s orofacial rsROI.
To explore the selectivity of connectivity diﬀerences to PMv
speciﬁcally, we employed the same method to deﬁne an orofacial
rsROI in each of S1, M1, and PMd as well. Additionally, for
comparison, we used the Freesurfer anatomical atlas to deﬁne
rsROIs in both the precentral and postcentral gyri.
Method 2: Functional region of interest
Next, we used the articulatory localizer fMRI task to
subdivide sensorimotor cortex based on activation, from a scan
independent of the resting-state data. We used the P >T
contrast to identify regions representing physical orofacial
movement (e.g., lips, jaw, tongue, throat, face) speciﬁcally.

for orofacial movement generally (e.g., Takai et al., 2010; Kern
et al., 2019) and speech sounds are a trigger reported in many
studies speciﬁcally (e.g., Edelstein et al., 2013; Colucci, 2015;
Claiborn et al., 2020; Cecilione et al., 2021), this localizer
eﬀectively accomplishes our goal of functionally deﬁning
an orofacial region relevant to misophonia. To maintain
consistency with the rsROIs, we deﬁned orofacial functionalregions of interest (fROIs) within each mask (S1, M1, PMd, PMv,
precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus) as the top 10% of voxels
within each region comprising the t-statistic’s positive tail (see
Blank et al., 2014).
To explore whether the connectivity diﬀerences in
misophonia were speciﬁc to orofacial cortex, we additionally
deﬁned ﬁnger cortex since ﬁnger-tapping has been described

in previous literature as a common misophonic trigger (e.g.,
Cavanna and Seri, 2015). For instance, 58.7% of participants
in a large-scale study of misophonia endorsed ﬁnger actions
(i.e., snapping, tapping, or rubbing) as triggering (Claiborn
et al., 2020), and “ﬁnger tapping” was ranked as the 15th most
triggering item (out of 48 total) in a separate sample of 143
individuals with misophonia (Rinaldi et al., 2021).
Finger fROIs were deﬁned in each participant using the
negative tail of the P >T contrast to isolate cortical regions
associated with ﬁnger movement. As with the orofacial fROIs,
ﬁnger fROIs were deﬁned as the top 10% of voxels active
within each region. For a depiction of fROI locations, see
Supplementary Figure 1.
For an overview schematic of the ROI methods and
sensorimotor templates being used in these analyses, see
Figure 3.
Analyses
Calculating percent signal change
Percent signal change (PSC) was calculated to assess ROI
selectivity to either phoneme articulation or ﬁnger-tapping. PSC
analyses were done in each participant’s anatomical brain.
For fROI selectivity, fROIs were deﬁned using one run of
the articulatory localizer fMRI task as described above. To avoid
double-dipping within the same data (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009),
PSCs were determined for each fROI using an independent task
run; as such, only participants with two runs of the articulatory
task (n = 11) were included in these analyses. To calculate PSC,
the beta weights of phoneme articulation or ﬁnger tapping were
divided by baseline and multiplied by 100. PSCs were calculated
in each run separately (e.g., deﬁne fROI in run 1, calculate PSC
in run 2; deﬁne fROI in run 2, calculate PSC in run 1) and
averaged across both runs.
For rsROI selectivity, rsROIs were deﬁned using resting-
state connectivity as described above. PSCs were calculated in
each rsROI using each run, then averaged across both runs.
Calculating functional connectivity
The mean time course of each non-sensorimotor ROI,
rsROI, and fROI was computed from the pre-processed resting-
state images. All ROIs were masked prior to calculations to only
include voxels located in gray matter. Functional connectivity
was calculated using Pearson’s correlations between the time
courses of the non-sensorimotor ROIs and each orofacial/ﬁnger
target region within each participant. To generate normally
distributed values, each functional connectivity value was Fisher
z-transformed.
Connectivity diﬀerences were analyzed using 3- and
4-way mixed ANOV As, with group (two levels: higher
vs. lower misophonia score) as a between-subject variable
and non-sensorimotor ROI seed (six levels: A1, planumtemporale, and amygdala; posterior, middle, and anterior insula)
and orofacial/ﬁnger sensorimotor target (levels depending
on method) as within-subject variables. Since signiﬁcant
hemispheric diﬀerences in connectivity patterns were not
observed, ROIs were collapsed across hemispheres for the
statistics and graphs reported here. Paired t-tests were
conducted for within-group comparisons and independent
t-tests for between-group comparisons. To correct for multiple
comparisons, we used the Holm–Bonferroni method (Holm,
1979) to control the familywise Type I error rate (corrected
p-values are denoted by pHB, uncorrected p-values are
additionally provided to aid in interpretation).
Results
Analysis 1: Resting-state region of
interest method
First, we sought to theoretically replicate the ﬁnding
ofKumar et al. (2021) by deﬁning orofacial cortex using
resting state connectivity (i.e., rsROIs). Based on their results,
we expected to see increased resting-state connectivity in
individuals with higher misophonia scores between the PMv
rsROI and both the planum temporale and insula.
Human Motor Area Template atlas
A 2 (group: higher vs. lower misophonia score) 6
(non-sensorimotor ROI: A1, planum temporale, and amygdala;
posterior, middle, and anterior insula) 4 (rsROI: S1, M1, PMd,
PMv) mixed ANOV A was conducted to assess sensorimotor
connectivity diﬀerences associated with misophonia ( Figure 4).
There was a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of group (F (1,408) = 53.345,
p= 1.481 10 12), such that individuals with higher
misophonia scores had increased connectivity overall
between these pre-selected regions than individuals with
lower misophonia scores. Additionally, there was a signiﬁcant
anatomical ROI rsROI interaction (F (15,408) = 2.145,
p= 0.008). Pre-planned independent samples t-tests for each
non-sensorimotor ROI–rsROI pairing revealed marginally
signiﬁcant group diﬀerences in connectivity between the PMv
rsROI and the planum temporale (t (17) = 2.556, p= 0.020,
pHB= 0.082) and between the PMv rsROI and posterior insula
(t(17) = 2.934, p= 0.009, pHB= 0.037), as predicted. The
posterior insula also showed signiﬁcant group diﬀerences
in connectivity with the S1 rsROI ( t(17) = 2.876, p= 0.011,
pHB= 0.037), M1 rsROI (t (17) = 2.542, p= 0.021, pHB= 0.028),
and PMd rsROI (t (17) = 2.740, p= 0.014, pHB= 0.032). No other
connectivity pairings showed signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
groups (see Supplementary Table 2).
To explore whether the planum temporale–rsROI or
posterior insula–rsROI connectivity varied by misophonia
severity, misophonia scores from all 19 participants were

orange outline = precentral gyrus, green = postcentral gyrus). Resting state data from all four sets of ROIs were correlated with data from the
a priori non-sensorimotor ROIs (see Figure 1), creating functional connectivity matrices for each participant.

correlated with the connectivity values from each pairing
(Figure 5). Whereas the four planum temporale pairings did not
signiﬁcantly correlate with misophonia scores after correction
for multiple comparisons, misophonia level did signiﬁcantly
correlate with each of the four posterior insula pairings (S1:
r= 0.62, p= 0.005, pHB= 0.014; M1: r= 0.54, p= 0.018,
pHB= 0.036; PMd: r= 0.51, p= 0.026, pHB= 0.026; PMv: r= 0.70,
p= 9.147 10 4,pHB= 3.659 10 3). To ensure this result
was not better explained by demographic or psychopathological
diﬀerences outside of misophonia, seven measures (OCD,
depression, anxiety, stress, age, gender, race) were additionallyused as nuisance regressors in a linear model, creating a “pure”
metric of misophonia that excluded variance explained by these
other variables. Connectivity was then correlated with this
“pure” misophonia level as above. Misophonia still uniquely
correlates with posterior insula–rsROI connectivity in all four
pairings (S1: r= 0.52, p= 0.023, pHB= 0.084; M1: r= 0.53,

metric of misophonia will be used hereafter for simplicity.

any issues with smaller samples sizes, we constructed null

distributions of possible t-statistics/correlations. We did
so by randomly shuﬄing either group membership or
misophonia scores, respectively, 5,000 times, and recalculating
the t-statistics/correlation with functional connectivity that
would have resulted each time. Each of the signiﬁcant
results mentioned here passed permutation testing (5,000
permutations, p<0.05).
In sum, an rsROI deﬁned within the PMv region of
the HMAT atlas showed increased connectivity to planum
temporale and insula in individuals with higher misophonia
scores, matching what was found in Kumar et al. (2021).
Additionally, rsROIs deﬁned within S1, M1, and PMd also
showed increased connectivity to the posterior insula, reﬂected
in both signiﬁcant diﬀerences in connectivity group means and
signiﬁcant correlations with misophonia scores.
Freesurfer atlas
A 2 (group: higher vs. lower misophonia score) 6
(non-sensorimotor ROI: A1, planum temporale, and amygdala;
posterior, middle, and anterior insula) 2 (rsROI: precentral
vs. postcentral gyrus) mixed ANOV A was conducted to
assess sensorimotor connectivity diﬀerences associated with
misophonia (Figure 6A). There was a signiﬁcant main eﬀect
of group (F (1,204) = 21.107, p= 7.600 10 6), such that
individuals with higher misophonia scores had increased
connectivity overall between these pre-selected regions
than individuals with lower misophonia scores. Although
interactions were not signiﬁcant, pre-planned independent
samples t-tests for each non-sensorimotor ROI–rsROI
pairing revealed a marginal uncorrected group diﬀerence in
connectivity between the precentral rsROI and the planum
temporale (t (17) = 1.907, p= 0.074, pHB= 0.147). As with theHMAT atlas, posterior insula connectivity was signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent between groups for both sensorimotor rsROIs
(precentral: t(17) = 2.733, p= 0.014, pHB= 0.028; postcentral:
t(17) = 2.249, p= 0.038, pHB= 0.038). Additionally, misophonia
scores were positively correlated with connectivity from these
areas, marginally so for planum temporale (precentral: r= 0.42,
p= 0.076, pHB= 0.076; postcentral: r= 0.46, p= 0.047,
pHB= 0.094) and signiﬁcantly so for the posterior insula
(precentral: r= 0.59, p= 0.008, pHB= 0.015; postcentral: r= 0.52,
p= 0.021, pHB= 0.021) (Figure 6B). See Supplementary Table 3
for a complete list of results.
In sum, rsROIs deﬁned within the precentral and postcentral
gyri showed a similar pattern of connectivity to planum
temporale as what would be expected from results of Kumar
et al. (2021). Additionally, as with our HMAT analysis, both
rsROIs showed increased connectivity to the posterior insula,
reﬂected in both signiﬁcant diﬀerences in connectivity group
means and signiﬁcant correlations with misophonia scores.
Analysis 2: Functional region of interest
method
We were able to show, using our sample of 19 participants
from the general population, that individuals with higher
misophonia scores do in fact show greater resting-state
connectivity between the PMv rsROI and both the planum
temporale and insula. However, a critical question remains: is
the “orofacial” region deﬁned using resting-state connectivity
really an orofacial area? Or, in other words, how do the
functionally deﬁned orofacial and ﬁnger fROIs connect to the
planum temporale and insula?

(non-sensorimotor ROI: A1, planum temporale, and amygdala;
posterior, middle, and anterior insula) 4 (HMAT region:
S1, M1, PMd, PMv) 2 (fROI: orofacial vs. ﬁnger) mixed
ANOV A was conducted to assess sensorimotor connectivity
diﬀerences associated with misophonia with either orofacial or
ﬁnger cortex (Figure 7). There was a signiﬁcant main eﬀect
of group (F (1,816) = 20.905, p= 5.575 10 6), such that
individuals with higher misophonia had increased connectivity
overall between these pre-selected regions than individuals with
lower misophonia scores. Additionally, there was a signiﬁcant
groupfROI interaction (F (1,816) = 8.201, p= 0.004). Probing
further, there was a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of fROI within the
higher misophonia group (F (1,288) = 7.818, p= 0.006) but
not within the lower misophonia group (F (1,528) = 0.929,
p= 0.336). This result revealed that individuals with higher
misophonia scores had greater connectivity with ﬁnger
fROIs than with orofacial fROIs, but individuals with lower
misophonia scores showed no diﬀerence between orofacial and
ﬁnger connectivity.
Further, pre-planned independent samples t-tests for each
non-sensorimotor ROI–fROI pairing revealed only uncorrected
group diﬀerences in connectivity between the posterior insula
and ﬁnger fROIs (M1-Finger: t(17) = 2.260, p= 0.037,
pHB= 0.224; PMd-Finger: t(17) = 2.439, p= 0.026, pHB= 0.182;
PMv-Finger: t(17) = 2.615, p= 0.018, pHB= 0.145); no
connections with orofacial fROIs nor with planum temporale
were statistically signiﬁcant, with or without corrections for
multiple comparisons (see Supplementary Table 4).
In sum, individuals with higher misophonia scores showed
more connectivity between the non-sensorimotor ROIs and
ﬁnger fROIs than with orofacial fROIs, a result unique to
higher misophonia scores only. Additionally, neither orofacial
fROIs nor ﬁnger fROIs showed signiﬁcant connectivity with
planum temporale in misophonia, and only ﬁnger fROIs showed
trending connectivity with posterior insula.
Freesurfer atlas
A 2 (group: higher vs. lower misophonia score) 6
(non-sensorimotor ROI: A1, planum temporale, and amygdala;
posterior, middle, and anterior insula) 2 (Freesurfer region:
precentral vs. postcentral gyrus) 2 (fROI: orofacial vs.
ﬁnger) mixed ANOV A was conducted to assess sensorimotor
connectivity diﬀerences associated with misophonia with either
orofacial or ﬁnger cortex (Figure 8). There was a signiﬁcant
main eﬀect of group (F (1,408) = 6.971, p= 0.009), such
that individuals with higher misophonia scores had increased
connectivity overall between these pre-selected regions than
individuals with lower misophonia scores. Additionally, there
was a signiﬁcant group fROI interaction ( F(1,408) = 5.389,
p= 0.021), although both groups showed only a marginal maineﬀect of fROI (higher misophonia group: F(1,144) = 2.856,
p= 0.093; lower misophonia group: F(1,264) = 2.357, p= 0.126).
Pre-planned independent samples t-tests for each non-
sensorimotor ROI–fROI pairing revealed only a signiﬁcant
group diﬀerence for connectivity between the posterior
insula and the precentral-ﬁnger fROI (t (17) = 2.882,
p= 0.010, pHB = 0.041); no connections with orofacial
fROIs nor with planum temporale were statistically signiﬁcant,
with or without corrections for multiple comparisons (see
Supplementary Table 5).
In sum, as with the HMAT atlas, neither orofacial fROIs
nor ﬁnger fROIs deﬁned within the Freesurfer atlas showed
signiﬁcant connectivity with planum temporale in misophonia.
However, individuals with higher misophonia scores did
show signiﬁcantly more connectivity between the precentral-
ﬁnger fROI and posterior insula than individuals with lower
misophonia scores.
Region of interest selectivity
As evidenced by the fROI method, the true orofacial
motor regions do not show the same pattern of connectivity
results that the rsROI method did. Are these previously
used rsROIs selective for orofacial movement? To investigate
the diﬀerences between these ROI methods further, we ﬁrst
compared the degree of overlap between each participant’s
rsROI and corresponding fROIs. For each HMAT region, the
proportion of fROI overlap was calculated for each participant
by dividing the number of voxels in common to both the rsROI
and the fROI by the number of voxels of the entire fROI.
Overall, the proportion of overlap was low across all regions
(M= 0.106, SD= 0.021, range = 0.000–0.455) and did not vary
systematically with misophonia level, nor was it signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent between fROIs. Sparse overlap demonstrates that the
rsROIs are not capturing the most selective voxels for either
orofacial or ﬁnger regions.
Do the rsROIs show any preference for orofacial (or ﬁnger)
movement at all? For each HMAT rsROI, PSC was calculated
using the articulatory localizer fMRI task to determine whether
the voxels comprising the rsROI showed an increase in
activation to either phoneme articulation or ﬁnger-tapping. For
a comparison, PSC was also calculated within each fROI, using
independent runs from what was used to deﬁne the fROI.
First, a 2 (localizer activation: phoneme production
vs. ﬁnger-tapping) 4 (HMAT region: S1, M1, PMd,
PMv)2 (hemisphere: left vs. right) within-group ANOV A
was conducted to assess diﬀerences in functional selectivity
within each HMAT fROI (Figure 9A). There was a signiﬁcant
main eﬀect of hemisphere (F (1,351) = 10.095, p= 0.002),
such that left hemisphere fROIs showed greater PSC
regardless of task or HMAT region. Additionally, there was a
signiﬁcant activation region interaction (F (7,351) = 55.918,

p= 6.927 10 52). To explore further, paired t-tests were
calculated between phoneme vs. ﬁnger activation within each
HMAT fROI. When corrected for multiple comparisons, all
sixteen fROIs showed signiﬁcant selectivity for their respective
localizer task. Thus, the fROIs are reliably capturing the
function they were intended to represent.
Are the rsROIs, which were previously attributed to
orofacial function by Kumar et al. (2021), actually selective
for orofacial actions (i.e., phoneme production)? As above,
a 2 (localizer activation: phoneme production vs. ﬁnger-
tapping) 4 (HMAT region: S1, M1, PMd, PMv) 2
(hemisphere: left vs. right) within-group ANOV A was
conducted to assess diﬀerences in functional selectivity
within each HMAT rsROI (Figure 9B). The main eﬀect of
hemisphere was marginal, with higher activation in the left
hemisphere rsROIs overall (F (1,175) = 3.333, p= 0.070), and the
activation region interaction was signiﬁcant (F (3,17) = 7.855,
p= 6.364 10 5). However, paired t-tests between phoneme vs.
ﬁnger activation within each HMAT rsROI revealed little task
selectivity; only one of the eight rsROIs showed any preference
for phoneme production, and it was marginal after correcting
for multiple comparisons (t (10) = 3.230, p= 0.009, pHB= 0.072).
Discussion
What is the underlying neural basis of misophonia? In the
present analyses, we show that an ROI within PMv created
using resting-state connectivity to planum temporale (as wellas the entire PMv region as an ROI, see Supplementary
Figure 3) conceptually replicates prior ﬁndings (Kumar et al.,
2021). This rsROI showed increased connectivity to planum
temporale and insula in individuals with higher misophonia
scores, corroborating previous neuroimaging ﬁndings that
auditory cortex and insula are key regions whose connectivity
diﬀerentiates misophonia from controls (Kumar et al., 2017,
2021; Schröder et al., 2019). Of note, although previous literature
has described group diﬀerences in the anterior insula, the
corresponding coordinates of maxima activation/connectivity
fall closer to the posterior insula ROI used in this study;
we do not see this as an incompatible ﬁnding, but rather
an artifact of using diﬀerent anatomical atlases across the
misophonia literature (e.g., Kumar et al., 2017, 2021 used the
Neuromorphometrics SPM toolbox; Schröder et al., 2019 used
the Anatomical Automatic Labeling toolbox). Additionally, the
present results lend credence to the potential involvement of the
posterior insula in misophonia, supported by previous ﬁndings
linking the posterior insula to sensorimotor and auditory
processes (Uddin et al., 2017).
Moreover, although we observed a main eﬀect of group,
it is not the case that individuals with higher misophonia
had higher connectivity with all of our pre-selected non-
sensorimotor ROIs: the high vs. low misophonia groups showed
no diﬀerence in connectivity of A1, supporting previous ﬁndings
that misophonia is not merely a disorder of lower-level sound
properties (Edelstein et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2021). Our
ﬁnding was speciﬁc to the planum temporale and insula,
supporting theories that the abnormalities associated with

misophonia concern more higher-level perceptions/context
of the sound (Swedo et al., 2021) and personally assigned
salience (Schröder et al., 2019). However, using rsROIs
created in additional sensorimotor areas and fROIs created
from independent task fMRI, we provide evidence that this
ﬁnding is neither exclusive to (a) motor function, nor (b)
orofacial content.
Constraining “orofacial” cortex by using only the voxels
within PMv misses out on important non-motor function that
may be equally informative to deciphering the mechanism
underlying misophonia. For instance, a study investigating the
existence of a mirror system in PMv during the observation of
mouth actions (e.g., biting an apple, chewing) vs. hand actions
(e.g., grasping a cup) notes that, in addition to premotor cortex
activation, observation of both mouth and hand actions elicitedactivation in the inferior parietal lobule (Buccino et al., 2013),
a region thought to integrate higher-order sensory and motor
information (Fogassi and Luppino, 2005). Moreover, other
studies have shown that activation during orofacial/ﬁnger tasks
can be found both dorsally (Meister et al., 2009) and ventrally
(orofacial: Grabski et al., 2012; ﬁnger: Ruspantini et al., 2011)
in the premotor cortex. By similarly deﬁning an rsROI within
each of the four HMAT parcels, we were able to investigate
the speciﬁcity of the Kumar et al. (2021) ﬁnding to ascertain
whether diﬀerences were unique to PMv. Contrary to the Kumar
et al. (2021) conclusion, our analyses showed signiﬁcantly higher
connectivity in misophonia between the insula and rsROIs
deﬁned within all four HMAT regions (S1, M1, PMd, PMv).
This is noteworthy for a few reasons: First, diﬀerences outside
of just PMv limit the viability of mirror neurons as being

the causal instigator of misophonia, given that mirror neurons
are thought to be mainly located in PMv/area F5 (Fabbri-
Destro and Rizzolatti, 2008). Second, our current ﬁndings of
diﬀerential insular connectivity to rsROIs created within S1 and
the postcentral gyrus, combined with the parietal lobe activation
found in previous work, suggest potential sensory (not just
motor) mechanisms that may underlie misophonia.
Further, for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge, the present
experiment provides a possible neural substrate for the non-
orofacial triggers in misophonia. Using fROIs constructed from
participants tapping their ﬁngers in the scanner, we ﬁnd that
these ﬁnger regions–both in motor and somatosensory areas–
show signiﬁcant diﬀerences in connectivity to the insula in
individuals with higher misophonia scores. If misophonia was
a condition of aversion to solely (or primarily) oral/nasal
triggering stimuli, there would not have been any reason to
see systematic diﬀerences in connectivity between insula and
ﬁnger regions. However, neural diﬀerences to ﬁnger regions
seem plausible, given the plethora of non-oral/nasal misophonia
triggers that are made using the ﬁngers, either alone (e.g.,
ﬁnger-tapping; Cavanna and Seri, 2015; Claiborn et al., 2020)
or with an object (e.g., typing on a keyboard, clicking a pen,
clicking a mouse, etc.; Edelstein et al., 2013; Hansen et al.,
2021). Moreover, prior work using magnetoencephalography
(MEG) has shown similar neural representations in humanprimary motor cortex when participants tap a drum with their
ﬁnger as when they observe or hear the drum being tapped
(Caetano et al., 2007), demonstrating an involvement of ﬁnger
motor cortex in ﬁnger-related sounds. To brieﬂy address the
existence of non-orofacial triggers, Kumar et al. (2021) posited
that other triggers are acquired through associative learning
after the orofacial trigger is acquired, without allowing for the
possibility that non-orofacial triggers (like ﬁnger-tapping) might
also be neurally represented. As a whole, our ﬁnding casts doubt
on this explanation and supports direct neural representation
for non-orofacial triggers.
Additionally, given the low overlap between the rsROIs
and the fROIs used in this experiment (see Supplementary
Figure 2 for a depiction of PMv ROIs) and the low selectivity
of the rsROIs in general, there is doubt as to what the
function(s) of the voxels comprising the rsROIs actually are.
It would appear that the voxels most strongly connected to
the planum temporale in resting state are neither entirely
orofacial nor entirely ﬁnger voxels; if they were, we would
expect to ﬁnd some task-based selectivity of these voxels to
either phoneme production or ﬁnger-tapping. This ﬁnding
opens the door to discovery of what those rsROIs are
actually responsive or selective to, perhaps illuminating a more
nuanced mechanism to misophonia than just “mirroring” the
production of triggers.

It is worth noting that the participants we studied were
members of the general population, not speciﬁcally misophonia-
suﬀerers. They were not recruited (or excluded) for having
particular misophonic triggers. The participants varied in their
identiﬁcation with misophonic experiences, demonstrating the
commonality of mild misophonia in the general population
(Wu et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017). However, the sample of
individuals with higher misophonia scores was comparatively
small and experienced less severe misophonia than the
misophonia sample in Kumar et al. (2021) similarly, the
individuals with lower misophonia scores were not a true
control group. Despite these weaknesses, our analyses still
showed signiﬁcant between-group connectivity diﬀerences even
with groups more similar in misophonia severity. A replication
of the rsROI method within this sample lends credence
to the power of the data to reveal group diﬀerences, if
they existed. Further, correlating misophonia severity with
connection strength between the insula and sensorimotor
regions revealed that these connections are systematically
stronger with worse misophonia severity. Nevertheless, future
studies should seek to incorporate individuals with more
extreme misophonic discomfort in larger sample sizes to
ascertain stronger group diﬀerences.
Regardless, the present results have important implications
for the study of misophonia moving forward. As we have
previously argued, misophonia ought to be conceptualized as
more than just an aversion to oral/nasal sounds (Hansen et al.,
2021). Neural evidence provided here of abnormal connectivity
to functionally deﬁned ﬁnger regions underlines this point.
Further, these results urge an expanded view of the underlying
mechanisms of misophonia. (Kumar et al., 2021) discovered
that connectivity within motor cortex diﬀered in misophonia,
and the data presented here expands this mechanism by
showing diﬀerences in sensory cortex, too; thus, both motor and
sensory routes should be studied further as possible misophonia
explanations. Taken together, these results take us one step
closer to understanding the multitude of presentations of which
misophonia likely exists, which is crucial for inclusive diagnosis
and treatment.
