Objective:Misophonia is a complex disorder characterized by a heightened reaction to certain sounds and
associated stimuli. While there is no uniormly accepted treatment to date, dierent intervention approaches are
being investigated. Individual's perceptions odierent misophonia treatment methods may aect compliance
and satisaction with treatment options. We sought to gather data on patient perceptions ocurrently available
misophonia treatments.
Methods:Using an online survey, we collected data about treatment preerences, treatment usage, and diagnosis
historyrom parents ochildren with misophonia (N=141) and adults with misophonia (N=252).
Results:Most respondents were not satised with misophonia treatments that they or their children had previ-
ously received. Audiologic interventions including active and passive noise cancelling and liestyle modications
were rated as most appropriateor treatment omisophonia by both parent and adult respondents.
Limitations:Because othe descriptive nature othis study, we chose to use a completer-only approach to ensure
the data refect the true responses oparticipants, though this did result in a meaningul proportion omissing
data. Participants were selected through convenience sampling and responses were sel-reported. Individuals
with more severe misophonia symptoms may be more likely to participate and complete a research survey.
Conclusions:Most interventions are considered inappropriate by parents oyouth with misophonia and by adults
with misophonia. This should be interpreted in the light oa general lack omisophonia-specic interventions.
Findings suggest dissatisaction with currently available treatments and an opportunityor development o
eective treatment strategies corresponding to participants' preerences. Deeper understanding otreatment
preerences has the potential to guideuture treatment development.
1. Introduction
Misophonia is characterized by decreased tolerance to specic
sounds and associated stimuli, coupled with the presence ovariable
levels odistress and impairment ( Lewin et al., 2021 ;Potgieter et al.,
2019 ;Rosenthal et al., 2021 ). Although understanding omisophonia is
increasing, there is a great deal that is unknown about the condition, and
even less about its treatment. The limited treatment literature has pri-
marilyocused on variousormats ocognitive-behavioral therapy(CBT). Case studies/series ( Bernstein et al., 2013 ;Jager et al., 2021 ;
Lewin et al., 2021 ;McGuire et al., 2015 ), an open-label trial ( Schr ¨oder
et al., 2017 ), and one randomized controlled trail ( Jager et al., 2020 )
haveound treatment to be modestly eective in reducing misophonia
symptoms. Few studies haveocused on pharmacologic or neuro-
modulation treatments although a clinical trial is being conducted
(ClinicalTrials.gov identier: NCT04348591). As theeld advances in
terms oavailable treatment options, it is currently unknown which
therapies are preerred by individuals with misophonia, or which☆Funding: Research reported in this publication was supported by the Ream Foundation/Misophonia Research Fund, and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National

misophonia.
Understanding patient preerences has important clinical implica-
tions. Patient preerences contribute to treatment initiation and leads to
better treatment adherence and improved patient outcomes ( Patel et al.,
2016 ). Numerousactors can aect patient preerencesor a given
treatment including belies about treatment and its accessibility ( Proctor
et al., 2011 ). Among youth, understanding both parental and child
treatment preerences is particularly important given that treatment
decision making is likely to be shared between practitioner, parent, and
child ( Lewin et al., 2014a, 2014b ).
The present study examines attitudes towards various treatment
options among individuals with misophonia or parents ochildren with
misophonia. Participants rated the“appropriateness” oa treatment
strategyor addressing the symptoms omisophonia on ave-point scale
rom extremely inappropriate to extremely appropriate. We had two
specic aims. First, we aimed to understand which treatments are most
utilized by adults and children with misophonia as well as which
treatments participants view as most appropriateor treating misopho-
nia. We also evaluated diagnosis historyor each participant, including
whether they had been diagnosed with misophonia by a healthcare
proessional, and iso, that individual's specic proession (e.g., audi-
ologist, psychiatrist, psychologist, etc.). Second, we evaluated whether
severity omisophonia symptoms, age, or gender was associated with
perceptions odierent treatments. Given the exploratory nature othis
study, no hypotheses were generated.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Two online surveys were distributed and completedrom July 2021
to September 2021 using the Qualtrics survey platorm. Each contained
the same items with language adjusted to be completed by either adults
with misophonia or parents oyouth with misophonia. Participants were
not compensatedor their study participation. A description othe
surveys and survey links were posted in onlineorums and social media
pages as well as emailed to participantsrom a prior misophonia study.
To be included in the study, participants had to be adults 18 years or
older and either have misophonia or parent a child with misophonia.
A total o184 parents ochildren with misophonia and 301 adults
with misophonia started the survey. A total o141 parents ochildren
with misophonia and 252 adults with misophonia completed the survey.
The average age oindividuals with misophonia was 14.8 yearsor the
Child survey (SD=4.3) and 47.4 yearsor the Adult survey (SD=15.9).
Over halothe sample wasemale (Adult 78 %, Child 72 %) and most
were Caucasian (Child=89 %, Adult=91 %). Most responses to the
child survey and to the adult survey endorsed that misophonia had
aected the patient's day-to-dayunctioning every dayor the past 7
days (59 % and 45 %). Adult survey respondents were more likely to
have not sought any treatment than Child survey respondents (25 % and
11 %). Most respondents to both surveys had a bachelor's degree or a
graduate degree (Child=78 % and Adult=64 %). For a complete
sample description, see Table 1 .
2.2. Procedure
The Institutional Review Board at Baylor College oMedicine
approved the study protocol and inormed consent procedures beore
the survey's distribution. In therst page oeach survey, the study
purpose was explained, and participants were inormed that their
participation was completely voluntary and that their responses would
be kept condential. Ater reviewing therst page, participants con-
sented by proceeding to the second page to begin the survey.2.3. Measures
2.3.1. Demographics
Following the cover page, demographic inormation was collected
rom adults with misophonia and parents ochildren with misophonia
including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and level oeducation. In addi-
tion, the parent survey included demographic inormation on age,
gender, race, and ethnicity oparents' children.
2.3.2. Misophonia
In the Misophonia sections, participants were asked ithey (or their
child) had been diagnosed with misophonia by a health proessional
and, iso, by which type ohealth proessional. Items to assess severityTable 1

78omisophonia symptoms included a question about age oonset o
misophonia symptoms and one on dailyunctional impairment,
modeled ater the Clinical Global Impression– Severity (CGI –S) (Guy
and Bonato, 1970 ). This item prompted participants to rate whether
their (or their child's) misophonia aected dailyunctioning (1) never,
(2) rarely, (3) some days, (4) most days, or (5) every day out othe last
week.
2.3.3. Treatment approaches
Assessment ovarious treatment options was created using an iter-
ative process including review oscientic literature, online misophonia
orums, and online articles discussing misophonia treatments. First, a list
o42 potential treatments and treatment descriptions was created by the
rst and last two authors, and reviewed by other clinicians with
expertise in misophonia. Treatments were then sorted into one onine
categories: Medications, Supplements, Liestyle Modications, Relaxa-
tion Strategies, Psychological Treatment, Audiologic Treatment, and
Neuromodulation. Within each category, participants rated the appro-
priateness ospecic misophonia treatment options on ave-point scale
rom extremely inappropriate to extremely appropriate.“Appropriate-
ness” was not specically dened. Survey items evaluating interventions
like liestyle modications or supplements were phrased as“How
appropriate is [__ strategy]or treating or managing your misophonia?” 
Each othe nine categories also included an item to determine which, i
any, othe potential treatments in that category participants had pre-
viously used. Participants were instructed to rate all strategies, regard-
less owhether they had tried a given intervention.
Modes oDelivery section was included to gauge opinions on the
appropriateness o amily counseling, group therapy, and teletherapy as
modes otreatment delivery. Participants assessed each mode ode-
livery on the sameve-point appropriateness scale used in other sections
othe survey.
2.3.4. Barriers to treatment
The Barriers to Treatment section included an item assessing overall
satisaction with the quality omisophonia treatment participants have
previously received. Overall satisaction was rated on ave-point scale
rom very dissatised to very satised.
2.4. Data analysis
Descriptive inormation regarding treatment experiences, diagnosis
history, satisaction with treatment, and misophonia impairment were
analyzed. Next, treatments in each category were grouped together to
create a mean“appropriateness” rating in order to compare perceptions
oeach treatmentamily. Appropriateness ratings across categories were
ound to have adequate internal consistencyor both parents and adult
sel-report raters ( α >0.73) exceptor audiology treatment ratings ( α =
0.65or parent and 0.64or adult sel-report). Their distributions were
not signicantly skewed and did not have excessive kurtosis (all less
than±2 SD othe mean) ( George and Mallery, 2010 ). Across treatment
categories, there were several signicant dierences between parent-
proxy and adult sel-report mean treatment appropriateness ratings,
and thus analyses were conducted separatelyor each subsample rather
than on data pooled across the two surveys. A repeated-measures
ANOVA was conducted with the average treatment appropriateness
variable to compare perceived appropriateness ratings across categories.
Deviation contrasts were used (i.e., the mean oeach treatment category
was compared with the grand mean across treatment categories apart
rom a reerence category, here being neuromodulation), with p<.01
being considered signicant to accountor multiple comparisons.t-tests
were used to compare mean appropriateness ratings among those who
had and had not tried a given treatmentamily, interpreting p<.01 as
signicant to minimizeamily-wise error with the high number o
comparisons conducted.
Correlations between treatment appropriateness ratings, misophoniaimpairment, and age were conducted.t-tests were used to compare
gender dierences in appropriateness ratings.
As is typical in online surveys, considerable attrition across the sur-
vey was noted. Across the two surveys, 83 % (n=393) oparticipants
who opened the survey completed demographics andlled out therst
misophonia-specic questions (those assessing diagnosis history and
overall misophonia impairment). Sixty-one percent (n=289) completed
the survey to thenal item assessed in this analysis (overall satisaction
with treatment). Because othe descriptive nature othis study, we
chose to use a completer-only approach to ensure the data refect the
true responses oparticipants.
For the parent sample, assuming alpha=0.05, power=0.90, and the
nal completer only sample size o110, this study was powered to detect
an eect of=0.20or the primary repeated-measures ANOVA analysis,
refecting a small-to-medium eect. For the adult sample, given the
same assumptions but a completer sample size o187, the study was
powered to detect an eect o0.12, a small eect.
3. Results
3.1. Diagnosis and treatment history
Over halothe parent sample endorsed a diagnosisor their child
rom a proessional (n=84, 60 %), with the most common diagnosing
proessionals being audiologists, psychologists, and primary care phy-
sicians. Sel-diagnosis was more common in the adult sample, with only
21 % (n=53) reporting they had been diagnosed by a healthcare pro-
essional. Among those who were diagnosed, therequency odiagnoses
rom dierent proessionals was similar, though adults endorsed a
diagnosisrom a psychiatrist relatively more oten (15 % oadults who
had been diagnosed vs. 6 % oyouth). Please see Table 2 or aull
summary.
The treatments/management strategies that had been most
requently tried were liestyle modications (96 % oparents endorsed
having tried this strategy, 89 % oadults),ollowed by audiologic
treatments (93 % and 87 %) and psychological therapies (89 % and 69
%). The next most popular treatment categories included relaxation (69
% and 70 %), supplements (58 % and 49 %), and psychotropic media-
tions (44 % and 50 %). Neuromodulation was used lessrequently (9 %
and 11 %). Active and passive noise cancelling were the most common
audiologic treatments; home rearrangement and modied event plan-
ning were the most common liestyle modications. Supportive therapy,
mindulness/acceptance-based therapy, and cognitive-behavioral ther-
apy were the most used psychological treatments. As shown in Table 1 ,

For adult sel-report ratings, Mauchly's W was signicant (W=0.34,

cant dierences across groups,F(6)=66.71, p<.001, ηp2=0.27.

and liestyle modications were rated as signicantly more appropriate,
d=0.42, p<.001, andd=0.32, p<.001, respectively.
Signicant variability in appropriateness ratings were noted in the
psychological treatment group, and thus another repeated-measures
ANOVA with deviation contrasts was conducted among treatments in
thisamily. Signicant dierences in ratings wereound among parents,
F(12)=39.55, p<.001. Psychological treatments that were rated as
signicantly more appropriate than the mean oall other ratings
included: cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindulness- and acceptance-
based therapy, supportive psychotherapy,amily counseling, and
group therapy (allps<0.001). Treatments that were rated as signi-
cantly less appropriate included: equine-assisted therapy, exposure
therapy, eye movement desensitization reprocessing, hypnosis, play
therapy, and support groups (allps<0.001). Dierences were also
ound in adult sel-report,F(11)=55.61, p<.001. Contrasts revealed
the same pattern, with the exception that hypnosis was not signicantly
dierent than the mean treatment appropriateness rating ( Table 3 ).
3.2. Associations with perceived treatment appropriateness
Because othe restricted range omisophonia impairment ratings
and the skewed nature othese data, Spearman rank-order correlations
were conducted to evaluate associations between misophonia severity
and treatment acceptability.
With regard to demographicactors, age was not associated with any
othe treatment appropriateness ratings in both parent and adult sam-
ples (r<0.18, p>.05), apartrom neuromodulation, which was rated as
signicantly less appropriate among younger adult participants (r=
0.26, p<.001). Regarding gender dierences,emale adult partici-
pants rated medications as signicantly more appropriate than non-
emales,t(212)=2.33, p=.024,d=0.48, and showed a similar
pattern with supplement ratings,t(208)=2.09, p=.038,d=0.38.
Parents o emale children also rated supplements as signicantly more
appropriate,t(117)=2.23, p=.027,d=0.48. Other gender dierences
were not signicant (please contact authorsor statistical details).
See Table 4 or a summary omean comparisons otreatment
appropriateness ratings among those who hadversus had not tried a
given treatmentamily, separated by parent-report and adult sel-report.
Parent- and adult sel-report responses showed a similar pattern osig-
nicance and eect size in this analysis: appropriateness ratings were
signicantly higher among those who had tried psychotropic medica-
tions, supplements, and audiologic treatments, but there were not sig-
nicant dierences in appropriateness ratingsor relaxation or
psychological treatment. Liestyle modications were rated as more
appropriate by adults who had tried these strategies. Insucient
numbers oparents reported not having tried liestyle modications (n
=6), audiologic treatments (n=8), or having tried neuromodulation (n
=10), to conduct comparisons.4. Discussion
This study investigated the treatment experiences and preerences o
a large online sample oparents ochildren with misophonia and adults
with sel-reported misophonia. Most adults and a large portion ochil-
dren were not proessionally diagnosed with misophonia. The majority
oboth parent and adult participants were not satised with misophonia
treatments they or their children had previously received. Liestyle
modications and audiological treatments involving noise cancellation
were perceived as the most appropriate treatments. Medications were
perceived as less appropriate and exposure therapy as least appropriate
among both groups.
Among participants who sought proessional helpor their miso-
phonia oror their child's misophonia, most utilized psychologists or
audiologists. These proessionals may be more likely to encounter in-
dividuals with misophonia in their practice. However, most participants
were sel-diagnosed.
Withew exceptions (relaxation strategies, psychological treatment,
and neuromodulation), participants who had tried a given treatment
generally rated it as more appropriateness, though the direction othis
association cannot be determined with this study, as it is likely that
people who perceive certain treatments as more appropriate are more
likely to try them, though it is also possible that their perceptions o
appropriateness increased ater trying a given treatment approach. It is
interesting that individuals who had tried psychotherapy did not rate it
as more appropriate than individuals who had not tried psychotherapy
(parents and adults); when compared with signicant dierences in
other treatment categories, thisurther highlights the inadequate ex-
periences individuals have had in therapyor misophonia.
Findings suggest strong desire by participants to engage in treatment,
though almost haldescribed dissatisaction with the treatment options
they have previously pursued. Notably, when those who responded
“neither satised nor dissatised” are included, over haloparticipants
were not satised with available treatmentsor misophonia. It is
apparent that there is a discrepancy between what patients' desire and
what is available to them in theorm otreatments. This could be related
to a lack otreatment response. The survey results also indicate that
there is still a signicant needor development oeective therapiesor
misophonia.
Overall, audiologic treatments and liestyle modications were both
the most popular and perceived to be the most appropriate treatments.
Among audiologic interventions, active noise cancelling (addition o
sound stimuli) and passive noise cancelling (sound protection such as
ear plugs or headphones) were rated as most appropriate. The high
appropriateness ratings onoise cancelling interventions and liestyle
modications suggest that individuals with misophonia prioritize
symptom management. The community seems to view misophonia as a
chronic disorder to be managed rather than a condition that can be
treated, but this view is likely aected by a general lack omisophonia-
specic treatments. These views and perceptions may be investigated
urther in theuture.
Medications were rated as less appropriate than other treatments
among both parents and adults, which may refect the lack origorous
pharmacotherapy trials with misophonia as the primary target. The least
appropriate treatmentor both adults and children with misophonia was
exposure therapy. Onote, exposure therapy was listed and described
separatelyrom CBT, which oten includes this therapeutic approach.
Thus, participants may have responded to CBT thinking that exposure
therapy was a component othis treatment. On balance, CBT includes a
number ocomponents (e.g., cognitive restructuring, coping skills;
Lewin et al., 2014a, 2014b ) and real-world CBT oten does not include
exposure ( Whiteside et al., 2020 ).
For youth, psychological treatment was almost asrequently used
compared with others listed on the survey, although it was not perceived
to be a signicantly more appropriate treatment approach. This diers
rom the limited available literature, which suggests therapy may be anE.E.A. Smith et al.

81eective and appropriate treatmentor misophonia in children
(McGuire et al., 2015 ). This highlights the need to engage individuals
living with misophonia in the development opsychological therapies
or this condition to ensure that they match the values and perspective o
this community. Indeed, there are two ongoing trials testing various
orms ocognitive-behavioral therapyor misophonia ( Cecilione et al.,
2021 ;Lewin et al., 2021 ), which build on prior results ( Jager et al.,
2020 ). Understanding the core treatment components oa cognitive-
behaviorally oriented treatment protocol is highlighted as an area in
need o urther study and stakeholder engagement. For example, expo-
sure therapy in its currentorm is generally considered dissatisying and
overemphasis othis treatment methodology could alienate some
members othe community. Thesendings also underscore the needor
interdisciplinary treatment eorts that emphasize audiologic, psycho-
logical, neurological and psychiatric perspectives to provide a range o
treatment options that match patient preerences, as well as comparative
eectiveness studies to determine the most ecacious approaches.
Adults reported lessavorable views towards psychological treat-
ment. Although 69 % reported trying someorm opsychotherapy, it
was rated as signicantly less appropriate than other treatment ap-
proaches listed on the survey. It is worth noting, however, that the
overall psychological treatment appropriateness mean rating may have
been an underestimate othe perceived appropriateness omore specictypes opsychotherapy as this category included a number otreatments
rated as highly appropriate (e.g., CBT, mindulness and acceptance-
based therapy) that were averaged with therapies with signicantly
lower appropriateness ratings (e.g., exposure therapy and equine-
assisted therapy).
4.1. Limitations
There are several study limitations. First, most participants were sel-
diagnosed with misophonia and misophonia symptom severity was sel-
reported; it would have been preerable to use a validated scale such as
the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale. Results may also be biased ipartic-
ipants with higher levels oeducation and ocertain ethnicities were
over-represented due to levels oawareness omisophonia. Because the
survey did not ask detailed questions about participants' symptoms,
there may be diversity in symptoms leading to variation in appropri-
ateness odierent treatments. Second, individuals with more severe
misophonia symptoms may be more likely to participate in treatment
research and may have been more likely to take and complete this study
survey (as evidenced by the misophonia severity ratings that skewed
towards the more severe). Third, participants were included based on
sel-reported misophonia symptoms. It is likely that some also presented
with comorbid medical or psychiatric diagnosis which could impact sel-
reports. Fourth, there were no checks on participant comprehension o
survey items. Finally, because othe descriptive nature othis study, we
chose to use a completer-only approach to ensure the data refect the
true responses oparticipants, though this did result in a considerable
proportion omissing data. In summary, clinicians and researchers are at
the early stages oestablishing evidence-based treatmentsor in-
dividuals with misophonia. Although there are some data to suggest CBT
is eective in reducing misophonia symptoms, our survey indicates in-
dividuals may preer liestyle changes or audiologic interventions most.
Participants seemed most consistently wary opsychotropic medications
and supplements. Also signicant is thending that over haloboth
adult and parent respondents were not satised with the misophonia
treatments they tried. These views should be interpreted in the light oa
general lack omisophonia-specic intervention options. In that regard,
interventionsor misophonia dierrom the availability omore specic
or holistic treatmentsor other disorders. Clinicians and researchers may
consider thesendings when approaching conversations with patients
or when planninguture research into treatmentsor misophonia.
Regardless, more research is needed to determine which treatment
strategies are most eectiveor misophonia symptoms as well as which
treatments are preerred and utilized. Future research should consider
the eect ocomorbid psychiatric conditions on individuals' perceptions
odierent treatment strategiesor misophonia.
