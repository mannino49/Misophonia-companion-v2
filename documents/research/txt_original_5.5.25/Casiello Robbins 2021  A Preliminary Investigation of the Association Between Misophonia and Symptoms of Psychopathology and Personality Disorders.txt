Misophonia is a condition characterized by defensive motivational system emotional
responding to repetitive and personally relevant sounds (e.g., eating, snifﬁng).
Preliminary research suggests misophonia may be associated with a range of psychiatric
disorders, including personality disorders. However, very little research has used
clinician-rated psychometrically validated diagnostic interviews when assessing the
relationship between misophonia and psychopathology. The purpose of this study
was to extend the early research in this area by examining the relationship between
symptoms of misophonia and psychiatric diagnoses in a sample of community
adults, using semi-structured diagnostic interviews. Results indicated higher misophonia
symptoms were associated with more clinician-rated symptoms of personality disorders,
but not other disorders. Anxiety partially mediated the relationship between personality
disorder symptoms and misophonia. These results suggest misophonia may be
associated with a range of psychiatric symptoms and highlight the role of anxiety in
this poorly understood condition.

Misophonia (denoted as “hatred of sound”) recently has been recognized as a “complex
neurobehavioral syndrome phenotypically characterized by heightened autonomic nervous system
arousal and negative emotional reactivity : : :” (Brout et al., 2018) in response to certain repetitive
and pattern based sounds. Individuals with misophonia report heightened sympathetic nervous
system arousal and emotional distress in response to personally relevant sounds (e.g., sniﬃng,
eating, tapping; Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2001; Edelstein et al., 2013). Psychophysiological data
indicate individuals with misophonia show heightened defensive motivational system responses
to misophonic (e.g., eating, breathing) vs. aversive (e.g., baby cry, person screaming) sounds,
suggesting greater emotional reactivity in response to misophonic sounds (Kumar et al., 2017).
Research primarily using self-report and interview data indicate a wide range of emotions can
be experienced in response to misophonic sounds including anger, disgust, and anxiety (Edelstein
et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2017).
Beyond discrete emotional responses, preliminary research suggests misophonia may co-occur
with a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Much of this early research relied on convenience
samples and/or self-report methods. For example, studies exploring the relationship between

Cassiello-Robbins et al. Misophonia and Symptoms of Psychopathology
misophonia and psychiatric diagnoses using online surveys
and other self-report methods point to the possibility that
higher misophonia symptom severity may be associated with
symptoms or a diagnosis of attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),
eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
(OCPD), anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression
(Wu et al., 2014; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018). While self-
report data are valuable, clinician-rated interviews are
typically preferred as part of the assessment when diagnosing
psychiatric disorders (Klonsky and Oltmanns, 2002). Two
studies investigating misophonia have used the Structured
Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders—4th edition (DSM-IV) personality
disorders (SCID-II). Natalini et al. (2019) described three
cases in which all patients met criteria for OCPD, two met
criteria for co-occurring borderline personality disorder (BPD),
and one met criteria for co-occurring avoidant personality
disorder (APD). Schröder et al. (2013) reported 52.4% of
participants with misophonia ( N= 42) met criteria for
OCPD. In addition to the SCID-II, Schröder et al. (2013)
used an unspeciﬁed psychiatric interview and reported 7.1%
of their sample met criteria for mood disorders, 4.8% for
ADHD, 2.4% for panic disorder, and 2.4% for OCD. Using
the SCID for DSM, 5th edition (DSM-5), Frank and McKay
(2019) reported diagnoses in their sample ( N= 18) including
depressive (22%), alcohol use (11%), panic (6%), generalized
anxiety (17%), and social anxiety (11%) disorders as well
as speciﬁc phobia (11%), agoraphobia (11%), excoriation
(6%), hypersomnolence (11%), and ADHD (6%). Jager
et al. (2020) used the MINI-International Neuropsychiatric
Interview and SCID-II to assess adults reporting misophonia.
These researchers indicated 72% of their sample did not
have a comorbid psychiatric disorder. Participants with
comorbid disorders met criteria for mood disorders (10.1%),
anxiety disorders (9%), autism spectrum disorder (2.4%),
somatoform disorder (1/4%), substance use disorder (1.6%),
impulse control disorder (2.1%), tic disorder (1.6%), ADHD
(5.4%), “other” (eating, psychotic, neurocognitive disorders;
1.4%), and personality disorders (5%). Taken together,
these preliminary data suggest some, but not all, adults
with misophonia report symptoms that co-occur with a wide
range of psychopathology.
In addition to identifying the diagnoses that co-occur
with misophonia, understanding the emotional patterns linking
misophonia with other disorders would allow clinicians to choose
interventions designed to speciﬁcally target these presentations.
Previous research provides preliminary evidence for speciﬁc
emotional responses associated with misophonia. For example,
anger may lead to notable impairments and daily functioning
(Schröder et al., 2013). Wu et al. (2014) reported anxiety mediated
the relationship between misophonia and anger outbursts,
raising the question as to whether other emotions underlie the
relationship between misophonia and anger. Thus, it is possible
the anger reported in misophonia may be secondary to anxiety
experienced in response to trigger cues. However, this study was
preliminary and the mediating role of other emotions, such asdepression, has not been explored. Thus, there is a need for
continued examining of the emotional patterns associated with
misophonia and psychiatric disorders.
Currently there is limited work examining the relationship of
misophonia with extant psychiatric diagnoses and exploring the
emotions mediating these relationships. In order to characterize
the relationship between misophonia and psychiatric disorders,
it is essential to use psychometrically validated semi-structured
diagnostic interviews. To the best of our knowledge, few studies
have used a validated instrument to assess both personality and
non-personality related psychopathology in the same sample.
The purpose of this paper is to continue examining these
relationships using clinician-rated interviews (i.e., SCID) in order
to provide preliminary data characterizing the relationships
between misophonia and psychopathology in a community
sample of adults. Speciﬁcally, we investigated the association
of misophonia symptoms with symptoms of psychopathology
(e.g., depression, anxiety) and explored whether high vs. low
misophonia symptoms were associated with psychiatric disorders
including anxiety, mood, eating, and personality disorders. We
hypothesized (1) high levels of misophonia symptoms would
be associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety,
(2) high misophonia would be associated with anxiety, mood,
eating, and personality disorders compared to low misophonia,
and (3) consistent with Wu et al. (2014), anxiety would
mediate the relationship between misophonia and symptoms of
psychopathology.
METHODS
Participants
Forty-nine participants were drawn from a larger
study examining the relationship between symptoms of
psychopathology and sensory processing dysfunction in adults.
Participants were included in the current analyses if they
completed the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al.,
2014), which was an addition to the larger study (see section
“Procedures”). Participants were excluded from the study if
they were under age 18 or met criteria for current mania or
psychotic disorder. Apart from these criteria, participants were
not required to meet speciﬁc diagnostic or demographic criteria
because the purpose of the larger study from which these data
were derived was to gather information about emotion regulation
and sensory processing from a general community sample.
Participants primarily identiﬁed as female ( n= 42), non-
Hispanic ( n= 46), and White ( n= 32). The average age
of participants included in these analyses was 27.02 years
(SD= 8.75). The majority of participants indicated they were
single, never married ( n= 35), had completed some college
(n= 18), and had a salary range of $0–$10,000 ( n= 27).
Measures
Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014)
The MQ is a 17-item, three-part, questionnaire that evaluates
the presence of misophonia symptoms, emotions, and behaviors
associated with misophonic reactions, and the overall severity

of an individual’s sound sensitivity. The ﬁrst two subscales are
rated on a scale of 0 (not at all true) to 4 (always true). These
two parts are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to
68. The severity subscale is a single item that asks an individual
to provide a rating of their sound sensitivity on a scale from 0
(no sound sensitivities) to 15 (very severe sound sensitivities). In
its initial validation the MQ showed good internal consistency
(a= 0.86–0.89). Reliability in this study was also good ( a= 0.93).
Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI; Beck et al., 1996)
This 21-item self-report measure assesses depressive symptoms
experienced over the past week. Items consist of clusters of a
range of severity for a given symptom and participants select
the option that applies best to them over the past 2 weeks.
Each item is score from 0 to 3 and items are summed to
produce a total score. Higher total scores indicate greater severity
of depression symptoms. This measure had sound internal
consistency ( a= 0.82) in its initial validation study and in the
current study ( a= 0.88).
Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; Beck and Steer, 1990)
The BAI is a 21-item self-report measure of anxiety symptoms.
Participants are asked to indicate how much a given symptom
(e.g., nervous) has bothered them during the past week on a
scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (severely—it bothered me a lot). Items
are summed to produce a total score (range 0–63) with higher
scores indicating greater symptom severity. This measure has
demonstrated good reliability in clinical and non-clinical samples
(0.92 and 0.93, respectively, Beck et al., 1996). It also showed good
reliability in this study ( a= 0.93).
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-I (SCID-I;
First et al., 1995)
The SCID-I is a semi-structured clinical interview designed
to assess the presence of DSM-IV Axis I disorders. In
this study, current anxiety disorder was deﬁned as currently
meeting criteria for at least one of the follow diagnoses: panic
disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, speciﬁc phobia, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized
anxiety disorder, anxiety due to general medical condition,
substance-induced anxiety disorder, or anxiety disorder not
otherwise speciﬁed (NOS). Current mood disorder consisted
of meeting criteria for bipolar disorder I, bipolar disorder II,
other bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, dysthymic
disorder, mood disorder due to general medical condition,
or substance-induced mood disorder. Finally, current eating
disorder was deﬁned as meeting diagnostic criteria for anorexia
nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and/or eating
disorder NOS. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by a blind
rater randomly rating 20% of SCID-I interviews from the parent
study. Kappas ranged from 0.63 to 1.0, reﬂecting acceptable
inter-rater reliability.
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders-II
(SCID-II; First et al., 1995)
The SCID-II is a semi-structured clinical interview that assesses
the presence of DSM-IV Axis-II (personality) disorders. Inter-
rater reliability was assessed by a blind rater randomly rating15% of SCID-II interviews from the parent study. Intraclass
correlation coeﬃcients ranged from 0.66 (Schizotypal) to 1.0
(Histrionic) indicating acceptable inter-rater reliability.
Procedures
The Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board
approved all procedures and all participants provided informed
consent before beginning study procedures. All participants who
provided consent completed study procedures. Recruitment for
the larger study consisted of local list serve notices and clinic
ﬂyers in an academic medical center outpatient clinic. Interested
participants contacted the clinic, completed a phone screen to
ensure they did not meet exclusion criteria, and were scheduled
for an in-person study visit. All procedures took place at the
outpatient clinic. Participants completed interviews consisting
of SCID-I and II (see section “Measures”), treatment history,
and sensory processing dysfunction. Assessors were ﬁve study
staﬀ, comprised of three clinicians with a masters in social work,
one doctoral student, and one research program leader; four
assessors were female. All assessors were trained by observing the
lead clinical assessor (a licensed clinical social worker) conduct
three SCID interviews and then conducting a minimum of three
interviews under observation.
Participants also completed a battery of self-report
questionnaires regarding emotional functioning, sensory
processing, and psychiatric symptoms. Finally, participants
were debriefed, completed a relaxation exercise to reduce any
unpleasant emotions associated with participation, and received
a list of community treatment resources. See McMahon et al.
(2019) for a detailed description of procedures.
Data Analytic Plan
Data analyses were conducted in SPSS version 26. Correlational
analyses examining the relationship between misophonia
symptoms and self-reported anxiety and depression, as well as
number of personality disorder (PD) symptoms on the SCID-II,
were conducted using the MQ total score as a continuous
measure. Analyses also examined diﬀerences in both self-report
and clinician rated symptoms of psychopathology between
individuals who reported high vs. low misophonia symptoms. To
conduct these between-group analyses participants were divided
into two groups (high and low misophonia symptoms) on the
basis of their MQ total score. Participants with scores below 34
were considered to have low misophonia symptoms and those
with scores above 34 were in the high misophonia group. The
score of 34 was chosen because (a) there is no empirically derived
or consensus standard for misophonia symptom severity on
the MQ and (b) individuals with this score, or higher, would
have an average score of 2 or higher across all the items on the
MQ symptom and emotion subscales. Hedges g eﬀect sizes,
which include a correction for small samples, were used to
examine the magnitude of the diﬀerence between high and low
misophonia groups on continuous outcomes (BAI, BDI, MQ,
number of PD symptoms). Categorical analyses were conducted
using the high vs. low misophonia groups and the presence or
absence of meeting criteria for anxiety, depressive, eating, and
personality disorders.

Next, we explored the mediating role of depression and
anxiety in the relationship between clinician-rated psychiatric
symptoms and misophonia. These models were explored
only for diagnoses that were diﬀerentially associated with
high vs. low misophonia. The models were examined using
Model 4 in PROCESS, an SPSS macro for path-analysis
based modeling (Hayes, 2018). We ﬁrst explored single and
then double (parallel) mediational models (Hayes, 2017). The
single mediator models examined were, Model 1 ( Figure 1 ):
Psychiatric Symptoms (IV) ! Anxiety Symptoms (BAI;
Mediator)!Misophonia Symptoms (MQ; DV) and Model
2 (Figure 2 ): Psychiatric Symptoms (IV) ! Depression
Symptoms (BDI; Mediator) !Misophonia Symptoms (MQ;
DV). A double (parallel) mediation model including both
depression and anxiety symptoms as mediators was also
explored. All possible indirect paths were tested in all models.
Additionally, non-parametric bootstrapping was used to test
the signiﬁcance of indirect eﬀects, in which the eﬀect is
interpreted as signiﬁcant if 95% bias-corrected conﬁdence
intervals (CIs) for the eﬀect do not include zero (Preacher and
Hayes, 2004, 2008). Mediation analyses were based on 5,000bootstrapped samples (as recommended by Hayes, 2009) using
bias-corrected 95% CIs.
RESULTS
Shapiro-Wilk tests indicated all data were normally distributed
(ps>0.05). Overall, the study sample met full criteria for a
number of psychiatric disorders, including generalized anxiety
disorder (32.7%), major depressive disorder (18.4%), post-
traumatic stress disorder (18.4%), BPD (12.2%), OCPD (10.2%),
social anxiety disorder (10.2%), APD (8.2%), and OCD (6.1%).

anxiety, and misophonia symptoms, as well as number of

groups are reported in Table 1 .

positively correlated with symptoms of depression and anxiety
(see Table 2 ). Independent samples t-tests indicated a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in BDI and BAI scores between the high ( n= 19) and
low misophonia groups ( n= 30), such that individuals with high
misophonia symptoms reported greater depression and anxiety
symptom severity than those low in misophonia symptoms and
these eﬀects were large in magnitude ( Table 1 ).
Clinician Rated
With regard to number of PD symptoms, Pearson correlations
indicated misophonia severity was signiﬁcantly correlated with
the number of PD symptoms a participant presented with for
APD ( r= 0.32, p= 0.03), OCPD ( r= 0.37, p= 0.01), paranoid
PD ( r= 0.35, p= 0.02), schizoid PD ( r= 0.30, p= 0.04), and BPD
(r= 0.46, p= 0.001). Additionally, individuals high in misophonia
symptoms reported a greater number of PD symptoms than those
low in misophonia ( Table 1 ).
When examining the presence or absence of psychiatric
diagnoses, chi-square tests indicated no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between the high vs. low misophonia symptom groups with
regard to the presence of a current mood disorder [ X2(1) = 1.04,
p= 0.31], current anxiety disorder [ X2(1) = 1.50, p= 0.22],
or current eating disorder [ X2(1) = 0.11, p= 0.74]. However,
individuals high in misophonia were signiﬁcantly more likely to
meet criteria for a PD compared to those low in misophonia
[X2(1) = 15.12, p<0.001]. With regard to speciﬁc PDs,
individuals high in misophonia were signiﬁcantly more likely
to meet criteria for APD [ X2(1) = 6.66, p= 0.01] and BPD
[X2(1) = 5.49, p= 0.02] than those low in misophonia. There
were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between groups with regard to
OCPD [ X2(1) = 0.97, p= 0.32], paranoid PD [ X2(1) = 1.56,
p= 0.21], and schizoid PD [ X2(1) = 1.56, p= 0.21]. Diﬀerences
between groups in narcissistic PD, histrionic PD, schizotypal PD,antisocial PD, and dependent PD could not be examined because
these diagnoses were not present in the current sample.
Mediational Analyses
Next, analyses examined whether anxiety and depression
symptoms mediated the relationship between symptoms of PDs
and misophonia. First, we examined the relationship between
misophonia and a set of potential covariates (i.e., age, sex, and
race). This set of predictors was not signiﬁcant [ F(3,45) = 1.041,
p= 0.384]. Individual eﬀects showed that age [ B= 0.132,
t(45) = 0.512, p= 0.611], sex [ B= 2.038, t(45) = 0.281,
p= 0.780] and race [ B= 1.467, t(45) = 1.601, p= 0.116] did
not signiﬁcantly predict misophonia. Therefore, we chose not to
include these variables in subsequent analyses.
Next, Model 1 ( Figure 1 ) was examined with anxiety disorder
symptoms (BAI) as the mediator. As seen in the ﬁgure,
PD symptoms were signiﬁcantly associated with high anxiety,
which in turn signiﬁcantly predicted misophonia symptoms.
Additionally, both the direct path and the indirect path (Index of
Mediation = 0.23, SE= 0.11, Bias Corrected 95% CI: LL = 0.03,
UL = 0.45) from PD symptoms to misophonia symptoms was
signiﬁcant; i.e., because 0 is not included in the CI, we can
conclude that the indirect eﬀect of PD symptoms on misophonia
symptoms through the mediating eﬀect of anxiety is signiﬁcant.
This result suggests anxiety symptoms partially mediated the
relationship between PD symptoms and misophonia symptoms.
Model 2 was examined with depression symptoms (BDI) as
a mediator. As seen in Figure 2 , PD symptoms signiﬁcantly
predicted high levels of depression and the direct path from
PD symptoms to misophonia was also signiﬁcant. However,
depression symptoms did not signiﬁcantly predict misophonia.
Furthermore, the indirect path between PD symptoms and
misophonia through depression symptoms, was not signiﬁcant
(Index of Mediation = 0.02, SE= 0.13, Bias Corrected 95%
CI: LL = 0.28, UL = 0.25), suggesting, unlike anxiety,
depression did not signiﬁcantly mediate the relationship between
PD and misophonia.
Finally, a parallel mediation model was examined, including
both anxiety and depression symptoms as mediators. Similar to
the previous models, personality disorder symptoms signiﬁcantly
predicted high anxiety symptoms ( B= 1.03, SE = 0.18,
p<0.01) and depression symptoms ( B= 1.10, SE= 0.24,
p<0.01). Additionally, high anxiety symptoms predicted
increased misophonia ( B= 0.69, SE= 0.29, p<0.05). However,
unlike the simple mediation model, depression symptoms

Cassiello-Robbins et al. Misophonia and Symptoms of Psychopathology
signiﬁcantly predicted misophonia symptoms in the opposite
direction ( B= 0.016, SE= 0.22, p<0.05) (i.e., high
depression predicted low misophonia, when including anxiety
as a mediator). The indirect eﬀects of both anxiety (Index of
Mediation = 0.26, SE= 0.12, Bias Corrected 95% CI: LL =  0.03,
UL = 0.46) and depression (Index of Mediation = 0.02, SE= 0.13,
Bias Corrected 95% CI: LL =  0.33, UL = 0.24) were no
longer signiﬁcant.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to examine associations of
misophonia with psychopathology and explore whether anxiety
or depression mediated the relationship of misophonia and
personality disorders (PDs) using validated semi-structured
diagnostic interviews. To our knowledge, this is one of the ﬁrst
studies to use the SCID-I and SCID-II to begin investigating the
presence of psychiatric disorders in individuals with misophonia.
As predicted, results indicated more severe misophonia
symptoms were associated with higher self-reported symptoms
of anxiety and depression, as well as a greater number of
PD symptoms. However, counter to predictions, clinician rated
measures of psychopathology indicated no diﬀerence between
individuals with high vs. low misophonia symptoms with regards
to a current diagnosis of a mood, anxiety, or eating disorder.
One reason for the discrepancy between the dimensional and
categorical results may be the small sample size, which limited
the ability to detect diﬀerences in diagnoses between high and
low misophonia groups. On the other hand, individuals high in
misophonia were more likely to meet criteria for a PD, speciﬁcally
avoidant or borderline PD, compared to those low in misophonia.
Overall, these results are consistent with extant literature
noting relationships between misophonia and symptoms
of psychopathology (e.g., Wu et al., 2014; Schröder et al.,
2017; Frank and McKay, 2019; Natalini et al., 2019). The
results indicating a relationship between high misophonia
symptoms and number of PD symptoms are of particular
interest. The use of a dimensional measure of PDs is
a strength of this study given the signiﬁcant overlap in
diagnostic criteria among PDs (Krueger, 2005; Zimmermann
et al., 2019). The association of misophonia with more PD
symptoms may indicate symptom overlap between these
conditions or shared vulnerabilities in the development
of symptoms. For example, recent research indicates
misophonia is positively associated with neuroticism as
well as diﬃculties regulating emotions; these two factors
are also implicated in the development and maintenance of
personality disorders such as BPD (Sauer-Zavala and Barlow,
2014; Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020).
To identify whether common symptoms of psychopathology
(e.g., anxiety, depression) might underlie the relationship
between misophonia and PD symptoms, we conducted three
mediational analyses exploring anxiety, depression, and the
combination of both as mediators.
The combined analyses did not yield signiﬁcant eﬀects
for both emotions. However, consistent with our hypothesis,when looking at individual emotions, anxiety emerged as a
signiﬁcant mediator between misophonia and PD symptoms.
These results are consistent with those noted by Wu et al.
(2014) in that anxiety partially mediated the relationship
between PD and misophonia symptoms. Taken together,
these preliminary ﬁndings along with those of Wu et al.
(2014) raise the possibility that anxiety may be a primary
emotion that needs to be better understood in the assessment
and treatment of misophonia. This result begins to raise
the question of whether “hatred of sound” is the most
appropriate way to characterize misophonia and suggests more
research is needed to understand the role of anxiety in the
experience of misophonia.
Notably, the PDs that were signiﬁcantly related to misophonia
in this sample (borderline and avoidant) as well as dysregulated
anxiety are all characterized by avoidance of stimuli perceived as
aversive (e.g., anxiety-provoking stimuli, rejection; Sauer-Zavala
and Barlow, 2014). This observation may inform treatment.
For example, cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) are well-
established for the treatment of anxiety and some personality
disorders (e.g., BPD; Hofmann and Smits, 2008), and target
reductions in avoidance and the acquisition and generalization
of skills to respond eﬀectively to emotionally evocative cues.
Treatments such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy (Linehan, 2014)
speciﬁcally target personality disorders symptoms by teaching
patients skills for managing strong emotions, including anger,
and anxiety, which are also prominent in misophonia. As
such, this study contributes to a small but growing literature
suggesting CBT-based approaches may be eﬀective for treating
individuals with misophonia (Schröder et al., 2017; Frank
and McKay, 2019; Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020). However,
existing studies remain preliminary and no randomized trials
have been reported for misophonia to date. Thus there is
a need for future research to examine the acceptability,
feasibility, and eﬃcacy of these approaches for treating
symptoms of misophonia.
The results of this study should be considered in light of
its limitations. First, similar to other preliminary studies on
misophonia, the sample size is relatively small, predominantly
female, non-Hispanic, and White. Thus, results should be
considered preliminary. Larger studies with more diverse
samples examining the association of misophonic symptoms
with the full range of psychopathology are needed in order
to draw more generalizable conclusions. Second, participants
were recruited from a facility specializing in treatment of
PDs. Therefore, it is possible the presence of PDs in the
current sample is an artifact of the center from which the
data were collected. Despite this possibility, our results are
in line with other studies indicating a relationship between
misophonia and PDs. Third, a limitation of misophonia
research in general is the lack of gold-standard assessments.
The MQ, which was used in this study, has demonstrated
acceptable psychometrics with an undergraduate sample, but
has not been validated in clinical or community samples.
Therefore, its validity in participants with psychiatric disorders
is unknown. Fourth, only a subsample of the clinician-
rated interviews were assessed for inter-rater reliability. Thus

it is possible rater drift still occurred in this study. Fifth,
the mediational analyses conducted used cross-sectional data.
Therefore, we were not able to examine how misophonic
triggers, anxiety, and PD symptoms interact over time. Future
research would beneﬁt from longitudinal data to provide a
clearer understanding of how these constructs interact over
time and to establish directionality (or lack of) between
these variables.
Despite these limitations, the results of this study add
important information to the nascent ﬁeld of misophonia
research. Though preliminary, these results highlight the
co-occurrence of misophonia with symptoms of personality
disorders as well as the potential importance of anxiety
in understanding this condition. Future work will beneﬁt
from continuing to examine these relationships in order
to improve our understanding of misophonia and develop
eﬃcacious treatments.
