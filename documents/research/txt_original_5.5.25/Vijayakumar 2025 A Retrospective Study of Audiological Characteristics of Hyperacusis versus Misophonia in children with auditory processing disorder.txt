## Abstract

## Objectives 2

- This study aimed to evaluate in children with developmental auditory processing disorder (APD): 3

4

- 1. The value of routine audiological evaluations in distinguishing hyperacusis and misophonia

5

6

- 2. The prevalence and association of tinnitus with the audiological characteristics of hyperacusis, misophonia and no decreased sound tolerance (DST).

7

- 3. The association between past history of otitis media with effusion (OME) and DST.

## Study Design 8

- Retrospective study comparing outcomes of pure-tone thresholds from .25 to 12.5 kHz, ipsilateral 9 stapedial reflex thresholds (SRTs), uncomfortable loudness levels (ULLs), past history of OME and 10 tinnitus between those with and without DST. 11

Tinnitus prevalences were 30.47%, 45.7%, and 18.18% in the 'Hyperacusis only', 'Misophonia with 28 hyperacusis', and 'No DST' groups respectively. The 'Misophonia with hyperacusis' group was older 29 than the other two groups irrespective of tinnitus. Tinnitus was more prevalent in older children in 30 the 'Hyperacusis only' and the 'no DST' groups. The presence or absence of tinnitus did not influence 31 any of the audiological characteristics in the 'Hyperacusis only' and the 'Misophonia with 32 hyperacusis' groups. Participants with tinnitus in the 'No DST' group had significantly lower ULL at 4 33 kHz, with a significant difference between 4 and 1 kHz in their right ear compared to those without 34 tinnitus. 35

Study Sample 12 The study included 278 children with a diagnosis of APD, aged 6-16 years (mean age: 11.68 years, 13 SD: 2.21) with nonverbal IQ ranging from 80 to 128 (mean: 98.74, SD: 9.92). Three groups of 14 participants included i). Hyperacusis only (n = 107), ii). Misophonia with hyperacusis (n = 35) and iii). 15 No DST (n = 136). 16 Results 17 The pure-tone average for 8, 10 and 12.5 kHz (High PTAvg) was lower than the .25, .5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz 18 pure-tone average (Low PTAvg) in all the three groups in both the ears, with significantly larger High19 Low PTAvg difference in the 'Misophonia with hyperacusis' group compared to the 'No DST group in 20 the right ear. SRTs elicited by 1 and 4 kHz tones were similar in all the groups. ULLs were significantly 21 lower for both 1 and 4 kHz tones in both 'Misophonia with hyperacusis' and 'Hyperacusis only' 22 groups compared to the 'No DST' group, with higher level of significance for 4 kHz (p&lt;.001) 23 compared to 1 kHz (p &lt;.01). ULLs did not reflect the severity of impact of DST on daily life. Despite 24 higher prevalence of misophonia in females, the frequency of significant impact was similar in both 25 males and females. Males had higher prevalence of hyperacusis but the frequency of significant 26 impact on life was more in females. 27 Journal Pre-proof

- The prevalences of past OME history were similar in the three groups. 36

## Conclusion 37

- Routine audiological evaluations cannot differentiate between misophonia and hyperacusis. Normal 38
- SRTs and low ULLs in DST and in those with tinnitus without DST indicate that higher order brain 39
- networks influence ULL, suggesting a need of evaluation for DST in children presenting with tinnitus. 40
- The higher high frequency sensitivity in the right ear needs further exploration. The study indicates 41
- that DST is unrelated to previous OME history. The study suggests that DST and tinnitus need to be 42
- considered as auditory disabilities in addition to different types of listening difficulties in APD. 43

## Introduction 4

Decreased sound tolerance (DST) is a common symptom seen in children referred to paediatric 5 audiology clinics, where children show heightened sensitivity to everyday sounds. These sensitivities 6 can manifest in various forms, including hyperacusis, misophonia, and phonophobia, each presenting 7 unique challenges for diagnosis and treatment. However, the lack of clarity surrounding these 8 conditions, particularly in terms of their definitions, characteristics, and evaluation, often 9 complicates the clinical approach (1-4). The overlap in symptoms between these conditions, 10 combined with inconsistent terminology in the literature, underscores the need for a more nuanced 11 understanding, particularly in children, where such disorders can significantly impact quality of life 12 (5). 13

agenda in audiology (4,6,7) and for this effort it is important to establish consensus based on clinical evidence. There are differing views on misophonia, if it is a psychiatric disorder related to 'hatred' to

specific sounds of any origin, or to sounds associated with chewing or eating (mastication rage), or to different human generated sounds in addition to chewing and eating (3,4,8-10). The distinction

between hyperacusis and misophonia has been limited to the trigger sounds and emotional responses (3,8,9,11). Ahmmed and Vijayakumar (2024) suggested that one approach to clarify the

characteristic features is to start from a very simple definition and then add additional qualifications as new evidence are established; misophonia considered as oversensitivity to sounds of eating and

chewing, while hyperacusis viewed as DST to sounds other than chewing and eating (3). The above simple definition of misophonia was based on existing studies (8,9). The findings by Ahmmed and

Vijayakumar (2024) in children diagnosed with developmental auditory processing disorder (APD)

were generally consistent with the literature on misophonia and hyperacusis (3). The above study highlighted, firstly, misophonia co-exists with hyperacusis in about 97% of cases; secondly,

misophonia (with or without hyperacusis) was more common in females and in older children;

thirdly, oversensitivity to other body-generated sounds such as coughing, sneezing/sniffing, and repetitive sounds like clicking and tapping were common in misophonia; fourthly, predominant

emotional responses in misophonia included disgust and verbal aggression, in contrast to fear and being upset in hyperacusis.

Journal Pre-proof

In addition to defining hyperacusis based on types of sounds and emotional responses, some authors proposed various cut-off values of uncomfortable loudness level (ULL) (12). This is likely based on the understanding that hyperacusis is related to the physical characteristics of sounds, such as sound intensity (4,11). ULL cut-offs for diagnosing hyperacusis range from 60 dB HL to less than 100 dB HL. Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2014) indicated that in adults ULLs range between 60-85 dB HL in hyperacusis, and 30-120 dB HL in misophonia (11). It is unclear if participants with misophonia in the above study also had hyperacusis. This distinction matters because misophonia can exist with or without hyperacusis, and these groups may have different audiological characteristics, which this study addresses.

The reliability of ULL as an indicator for DST is debatable (1,13,14). In contrast to the subjective nature of ULL, stapedial reflex measurement has been suggested as an objective measure. The

stapedial reflex assesses the integrity of certain parts of the auditory pathway, and dysfunction in this auditory reflex has been associated with DST, although it is not widely utilized in its clinical evaluation

(15-17). Notably, this acoustic reflex was not even mentioned in a recent systematic review that examined various clinical assessment for hyperacusis (18). Among the one hundred patients with

- hyperacusis reported by Anari and colleagues (1999), only fifty-one had their stapedial reflex 1
- thresholds (SRTs) measured (19). 2
- Other audiological measures, in addition to ULL and SRT, have been employed to evaluate DST, given 3
- that auditory sensitivity is often better for high compared to low frequency tones (12,20). Aazh et al. 4
- (2022) identified significant differences in the slope between 8 and 1 kHz pure-tone thresholds and 5
- ULLs in patients with misophonia compared to controls, without interaural differences (12). However, 6
- there is no such information available for children with DST and normal hearing thresholds. It 7
- remains unclear how high-low frequency slopes for pure-tone thresholds and ULLs relate to those for 8
- SRT. While SRTs typically cover .5-4 kHz tones, ULLs have been measured and reported for a larger 9 number of frequencies. The measurement of SRT and ULL should be limited to a minimal number of 10
- frequencies based on clinical necessity to avoid any distress in individuals with DST (20,21). In the 11

12

APD clinic conducted by one of the authors, SRT and ULLs are measured for 1 and 4 kHz tones. This

13

study aims to differentiate hyperacusis and misophonia based on audiometric thresholds, SRT, ULL,

- and their slopes (difference in the absolute values between high and low frequency tones) in children 14 with APD. 15
- Tinnitus is frequently observed in individuals with DST (11,12,22) including children diagnosed with 16 APD (3). However, there is limited information on how different audiological measures related to DST 17 vary with the presence or absence of tinnitus in children with APD. This is another issue that is 18 explored in this study. 19

causing fluctuating conductive hearing loss. This condition typically resolves on its own without causing long-term effects on speech and language development (23). Some studies suggested a link

between DST and history of OME (24-26), but there is limited research to confirm this association.

Another objective of this study was to investigate DST in children who had experienced temporary conductive hearing loss due to OME in early childhood but had normal hearing thresholds before

26

diagnosis of APD.

## Method 27

## Study Design 28

- This retrospective study was conducted as part of a quality improvement project, registered with the 29 clinical audit department at a regional teaching hospital in the Northwest of the United Kingdom. 30 Data were gathered retrospectively from the medical records of children diagnosed with APD within 31 an established clinical service in the tertiary paediatric audio-vestibular medicine department 32 between January 2021 and December 2022. Ethical approval was not required for this study. 33

## Participants 34

The data used in this study were from 278 out of 279 children with APD that was reported earlier (3). 35 Of the participants in the 'misophonia with or without hyperacusis' group in the above study, only 36 one child had misophonia without hyperacusis.  The data of this single child was excluded from the 37 current study. The current study included 159 males and 119 females, diagnosed with APD, aged 38 between 6 and 16 years (Mean = 11.68 years, SD = 2.21) with nonverbal intelligence quotient (NVIQ) 39 ranging from 80 to 128 (Mean = 98.74, SD = 9.92), as measured by the fourth edition of 'Test of 40 Nonverbal Intelligence' (TONI-4) (27). All the participants were healthy English-speaking children 41 attending mainstream schools. 42

- Three groups of participants included in the study were: 43

- Group I. 'Hyperacusis only', N=107, comprised of 66 males and 41 females, aged between 7 and 1
- 16.33 years (mean = 11.28, SD = 2.17) with NVIQ ranging from 80 to 127 (mean=99.44, SD 10.1). 2
- Group II. 'Misophonia with hyperacusis', N= 35, included 11 males and 24 females, aged between 3
- 7.91 and 16.75 years (mean = 12.67, SD 2.42) and NVIQ varied from 84 to 128 (mean = 97, SD = 4 10.58). 5
- Group III. 'No decreased sound tolerance' (No DST), N= 136, had 82 males and 54 females, age 6 ranging from 6.91 to 16.5 years (mean = 11.73, SD = 2.11) with NVIQ between 81 to 125 (mean = 7
- 98.65, SD = 9.61). 8

## Structured history questionnaire in evaluating APD and DST 9

- A structured clinical history questionnaire is routinely employed for the assessment of APD. It 10 includes detailed queries about sensitivity to sounds, other sensory symptoms, auditory symptoms, 11 perinatal history, behaviour, developmental milestones, educational progress, family history, and 12 medical conditions (3,28,29). The caregiver fills out the questionnaire, which is subsequently 13 assessed by the clinician with contributions from both the caregiver and the child during the clinical 14 consultation. The information is subsequently stored in the clinic record. The response choices about 15 the question about the presence or absence of oversensitivity to sounds included 'Never', 16 'Occasional', 'Most times' and 'Always'. Participants who report oversensitivity to sounds have the 17 option to select from thirty-seven common sounds that may serve as triggers. These include sounds 18 related to chewing and eating, which form the basis for diagnosing misophonia (3,8,9). An option for 19 specifying any other sounds not listed in the questionnaire is also included. In this study, children 20 with responses of 'Always' or 'Most times' were classified as having Decreased Sound Tolerance 21 (DST). Children with responses of 'Never' or 'Occasional' oversensitivity to sounds were considered 22 not to have DST (No DST). Additionally, the questionnaire explored how DST impacted daily activities, 23 with response choices that included 'Not sure', 'No restriction', 'Little impact', 'Moderately', and 24 'Severely'.  For the purpose of the current study, the responses of 'Not sure', 'No restriction' and 25 'Little impact' were considered as 'non-significant impact', and the responses of 'Moderately' and 26 'Severely' were considered as 'significant impact'. Such an approach is similar to that seen in some 27 publications (30-33). Different emotional and behavioural responses to sound triggers, important in 28 distinguishing between hyperacusis and misophonia, are also recorded within the questionnaire 29 which have been published previously (3). 30 Journal Pre-proof
- The history questionnaire also enquired about the presence or absence of tinnitus and past history 31 of OME. 32

## Hearing Thresholds 33

- Consistent with the routine practice in the department, the participants had their pure-tone 34 35

audiometric thresholds measured using a PC-controlled AURICLE Aud audiometer (GN Otometrics), operated via the OTOsuite Audiometry Module software. Sound stimuli were delivered using 36

- Sennheiser HDA 300 headphones at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, and 12.5 kHz. 37

## Tympanometry and Stapedial Reflex Threshold 38

- GSI Grason Stadler TympStar Pro is used in the department for tympanometry and SRT 39
- measurements. All participants in this study had middle ear pressures between +50 and -200 daPa. 40
- Ipsilateral stapedial reflexes were assessed using a 226 Hz probe tone, starting at 60 dB HL, and 41
- increasing in 5 dB steps until a minimal reflectance change of 0.02 ml was observed, which marked 42
- the threshold (21). The upper level of stimuli used to elicit the reflexes varied between 100- and 10543

- dB HL. This is further explored in the data analysis section. Stapedial reflexes at frequencies of 1 kHz 1 and 4 kHz were measured for both ears. 2

## Uncomfortable Loudness Level (ULL) 3

- Audiometer used for pure tone thresholds was also used to measure ULLs for both ears. Pure-tones 4
- were presented for one second, with at least a one-second interval between each stimulus, starting 5 at 60 dB HL and increasing in 5 dB steps until the ULL was reached (20). The children were instructed 6 to give a 'thumbs up' if they were comfortable with the stimuli and give a 'thumbs down' if a 7 stimulus was uncomfortable. If ULL was not reached by 100 dB HL the measurement stopped for that 8 frequency and the ULL was recorded as 105 dB HL. Such an approach is similar to Aazh and 9 colleagues (2022) (12). The British Society of Audiology suggests limiting ULL measurement to 10 minimum number of frequencies required for clinical purpose (20). The departmental protocol 11 measured ULL for 1 and 4 kHz frequencies, to match up with the frequencies used for SRT, which 12 helped the clinicians to explain the nature of DST to establish the patients understanding of the 13 condition which in turn assisted in the counselling process involved in the management (further 14 explained in discussion section). 15

Data Analysis 16 Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 29. The data were explored and were not 17 normally distributed. Non-parametric tests were carried out. Bonferroni correction for multiple 18 comparisons were applied for independent samples test to compare variables across the three 19 group, if applicable. Categorical data were analysed using cross-tabulations and Chi-square tests. p20 values &lt; .05 were considered to be statistically significant. If p values are &lt;.05 the actual significance 21 levels are provided for appreciating the level of significance. 22 There are studies that replaced missing values with one audiometric step above the highest 23 presentation level if no stapedial reflex was observed (34) or ULL not reached (12). Stapedial reflex is 24 absent in a small proportion of healthy individuals (34,35), and the above approach may not be 25 appropriate (34). Normally, SRT varies between 70 -100 dB HL in 95%, and between 65-105 dB HL in 26 99% of the population (35). It was therefore felt that the use of either 100 dB HL or 105 dB HL as the 27 maximum levels of stimuli to record stapedial reflex would not significantly influence the outcome of 28 the study. If stapedial reflexes were not recordable at 100- or 105-dB HL, they were recorded as 'no 29 response' at 100- or 105-dB HL as appropriate.  Unlike stapedial reflex that may be absent in about 30 5% of the population, ULL values were expected in all participants. In the study ULL measurements 31 did not exceed 100 dB HL as such a level was clinically adequate for audiological evaluation and 32 counselling. 105 dB HL was taken as ULL if ULL was not reached at 100 dB HL, consistent with some 33 studies (12). 34 Journal Pre-proof

## Results 35

## Age, Gender, and NVIQ 36

Chi-square test demonstrated that 'Misophonia with hyperacusis' group had a significantly higher 37 number of females compared to both the 'Hyperacusis only' group (p=.001) and the 'No DST' group 38 (p=.002). Gender difference between the 'Hyperacusis only' and 'No DST' groups was not significant 39 (p&gt;.05). 40

- Kruskal Wallis test suggested significant age differences between the three groups (p =.008). Pairwise 1
- comparisons with Bonferroni correction showed that the participants in the 'Misophonia with 2
- hyperacusis' group were significantly older than those in the 'Hyperacusis only' group (p=.007) 3
- without any age differences between the 'Misophonia with hyperacusis' versus the 'No DST' groups 4
- (p&gt;.05) or the 'Hyperacusis only' versus the 'No DST' groups (p&gt;.05). There were no significant 5
- differences in NVIQ among the three groups (p &gt; .05). 6

## Impact of DST on daily activities 7

10

11

## 29

There were two missing data from the 'Hyperacusis only' group. DST had 'significant impact' on daily 8 activities in 25 out of 35 participants (71.4%) and in 62 out of 105 participants (59%) in the 9 'Misophonia with hyperacusis' and the Hyperacusis only' groups respectively, which was not statistically significant (Chi-square test, p&gt;.05).  In the 'Misophonia with hyperacusis' group, DST had 'significant impact' in 17 females and eight males, and 'non-significant impact' in seven females and 12 three males, and this gender difference was not statistically significant (Chi-square test, p&gt;.05). In the 13 'Hyperacusis only' group DST had 'significant impact' in 28 out of 39 females (71.8%) and in 34 out of 14 66 males (51.5%), which was statistically significant (Chi-square test, p &lt;.05). 15 Hearing Thresholds 16 The mean (SD) pure-tone thresholds for the right and left ears at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10 and 12.5 kHz 17 along with the means (SD) of .25 to 4 kHz (Low PTAvg) and 8 to 12.5 kHz (High PTAvg) pure-tone 18 averages and the differences between the high and low frequency pure tone averages (High-Low 19 PTAvg slope) are provided in Table 1. The hearing thresholds at each of the individual frequencies, 20 High PTAvg and Low PTAvg were not significantly different across the three groups in either the right 21 or the left ear (Kruskal Wallis test, p&gt;.05). Wilcoxon signed-rank test suggested that High PTAvg were 22 significantly lower than Low PTAvg within each of the three groups, for both the ears (p &lt;.001). When 23 compared across the groups, the High-Low PTAvg slope was found to be significantly different in the 24 right ear (Kruskal Wallis test, p = .034). Pair-wise comparison with Bonferroni correction for multiple 25 comparisons found that the High PTAvg in the right ear was significantly lower than the Low PTAvg in 26 the 'misophonia with hyperacusis' group compared to the no 'DST' groups (p=.029). 27 Table 1. Here Please 28 Journal Pre-proof

## Stapedial Reflex Threshold (SRT)

Different outcomes of ipsilateral stapedial reflex measurements are shown in Table 2. For 1 kHz tone, 30 stapedial reflex was present in 178 out of 189 ears tested (94.17%) in the 'hyperacusis only' group, in 31 251 out of 261 ears tested (96.16%) in the 'no DST' group and in 61 out of 65 ears tested (93.84%) in 32 the 'misophonia with hyperacusis' group. For 4 kHz tone, stapedial reflex was present in 140 out of 33 175 ears tested (80%) in the 'hyperacusis only' group, in 192 out of 255 ears tested (75.29%) in the 34 'no DST' group and in 49 out of 64 ears tested (76.56%) in the 'misophonia with hyperacusis' group. 35 The mean and standard deviation of stapedial reflex thresholds at 1 and 4 kHz and the mean of the 36 difference in thresholds between 4 kHz and 1 kHz (SRT 4-1 kHz slope) are shown in Table 3. There 37 were no statistically significant differences in these measures of stapedial reflexes across the three 38 groups, for neither the right nor the left ear (Kruskal Wallis test, p&gt;.05). 39

## Uncomfortable Loudness Level (ULL) 1

- The number and percentage of participants with different ULLs varying from 60 to greater than 100 2 dB HL in the right and left ears for 1 and 4 kHz tones are provided in Table 4. High proportion of 3
- participants in all the groups had ULLs of 90 dB HL or greater. The mean and standard deviation of 4
- ULLs in response to 1 and 4 kHz tones and the difference in ULLs between 4 and 1 kHz (ULL 4-1 kHz 5
- slope) are shown in Table 3. Kruskal Wallis test suggested significant differences in ULLs across the 6
- three groups in both the right and left ears for both 1kHz and 4 kHz tones. Pairwise comparisons with 7
- Bonferroni correction showed no statistically significant differences in the above measures between 8
- the 'Hyperacusis only' and the 'Misophonia with hyperacusis' groups (p&gt;.05). ULL was significantly 9 higher in the 'No DST' group than the 'Hyperacusis only' group (Right 1 kHz, p=.003; Right 4 kHz, 10
- p&lt;.001; Left 1 kHz, p=.008; Left 4 kHz, p =.001) as well as the 'Misophonia with hyperacusis' group 11 (Right 1 kHz, p=.003; Right 4 kHz, p&lt;.001; Left 1 kHz, p&lt;.024; Left 4 kHz, p =.001). The ULL 4-1 kHz 12

slope in the 'Misophonia with hyperacusis' group was lower compared to the 'No DST' group which 13 reached statistical significance in the left ear (p=.035) but narrowly failed to reach statistical 14 significance in the right ear (p=.052). 15 The ULLs in response to the 1 and 4 kHz tones in either the right or the left ears were not significantly 16 different whether DST (Hyperacusis only or Misophonia with hyperacusis) were associated with 17 either 'significant impact' or 'non-significant impact' on daily life (Mann-Whitney U tests, p&gt;.05). 18 Table 4 Here please 19 Tinnitus 20 There were two and four missing data about the presence or absence of tinnitus in 'Hyperacusis 21 only' and the 'No DST' groups respectively. Tinnitus was present in 32 (30.48%), 16 (45.71%) and 24 22 (18.18%) participants in the 'Hyperacusis only', 'Misophonia with hyperacusis' and the 'No DST' 23 groups respectively. From the available data on the 'No DST' group, 50 participants never had DST 24 and 82 participants had occasional DST. Of the 50 participants who never had DST, six (12%) 25 complained of tinnitus, compared to tinnitus in 18 (21.9%) out of 82 participants who had very 26 occasional DST. The number of participants with and without tinnitus in those who never complained 27 of DST and those who had occasional DST was not statistically significant (Chi-square test, p&gt;.05). The 28 means (SD) of the age in years, NVIQ, and different audiological measures in participants with and 29 without tinnitus in the three groups are provided in Table 5. Mann-Whitney U test compared the 30 above variables between participants with and without tinnitus, in all the three groups separately. 31 Participants with tinnitus were older in the 'Hyperacusis only' (p=.007) and the 'No DST' (p =.003) 32 groups compared to those without tinnitus. No age difference was noted in the 'Misophonia with 33 hyperacusis' group in terms of the presence or absence of tinnitus (p &gt;.05). The presence or absence 34 of tinnitus did not influence any of the audiological characteristics in the 'Hyperacusis only' and the 35 'Misophonia with hyperacusis' groups (p&gt;.05). The right ear of participants with tinnitus in the 'No 36 DST' group had highly significant lower ULL at 4 kHz (p=.003) with larger ULL slope between 4 and 1 37 kHz (p=.001) compared to those without tinnitus. 38 Journal Pre-proof

## History of otitis media with effusion (Glue ear) 39

- Data were missing in three and one participants about past history of otitis media with effusion from 40 the 'Hyperacusis only' and the 'no DST' groups respectively. Twelve (11.54%), five (14.29%), and 16 41
- (11.85%) participants in the 'Hyperacusis only', 'Misophonia with hyperacusis' and 'No DST' groups 42
- respectively had past history of otitis media with effusion. The proportion of participants with past 43
- history of glue ear were not statistically significantly different between the three groups (p &gt; .05). 44

## Discussion 1

- Distinguishing between hyperacusis and misophonia is an increasingly significant topic in audiology 2
- (2,4,6,7). An association between increased sensitivity to high frequency sounds has been suggested 3
- in DST (12) but it is not clear how children with hyperacusis, misophonia and those without DST 4
- differ in respect of the pure-tone thresholds for low and high frequency tones. The use of stapedial 5

6

reflex threshold and uncomfortable loudness levels in these groups of children are also not widely

- reported (25), especially in children with normal hearing thresholds. Most studies on DST 7
- concentrated on adults with different levels of hearing and tinnitus (11,12,36) and it is not clear how 8

9

hearing loss and tinnitus influenced the findings. Some studies have looked into tinnitus and DST in

10

11

children, but their relationship is not clear (25,37), especially in children with normal hearing thresholds. This current study investigated if hyperacusis and misophonia could be differentiated by

12

characteristic audiological feature(s), by the presence and absence of tinnitus, and by past history of

- glue ear in children diagnosed with APD who have satisfactory hearing thresholds. 13 Prevalence of DST in children with APD 14 The reported prevalence of DST in children vary from 5.4 to 46% of the general paediatric population 15 to 95% of children with Williams syndrome, dependent on how DST has been defined, the 16 population being studied (25), and cultural environment (38).  Ahmmed and Mukherjee (2021) 17 reported that approximately 70% children with APD have DST, a study where children with occasional 18 symptoms of oversensitivity to sounds were also considered to have DST (28)  In the current study . 19 approximately 51% of children with APD had DST, where oversensitivity to sounds were present most 20 times or always. Such prevalence of DST in APD is consistent with the reported prevalence of sensory 21 oversensitivity in neurodevelopmental disorders (39). DST and APD can be seen in the context of a 22 sensory processing disorder (28). APD coexists with different neurodevelopmental conditions that 23 are associated with DST (12,40). The coexistence of different mental and neurodevelopmental 24 conditions is clarified by the way different neural systems in the brain interacts as laid down in the 25 Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework (41), which influenced not only APD to be evaluated 26 within the RDoC framework (29) but also led to the proposal of application of RDoC framework in 27 evaluating DST (6). The strong link between sensory processing and different neurodevelopmental 28 condition has also influenced a proposal to include sensory processing as a separate system within 29 RDoC (42). 30 Journal Pre-proof

Thirty-five out of the 278 participants (12.6%) in the current study had misophonia, consistent with 31 the reported prevalence of misophonia that vary from 6-19% (12). The findings in this study of 24.6% 32 participants with DST to have misophonia (35 misophonia out of 142 participants with DST) is also 33 consistent with the 23% prevalence of misophonia reported by Aazh and colleagues (2022) in 34 patients presenting with tinnitus and/or hyperacusis (12). In view of the high prevalence of DST in 35 children with APD noted in this study and their associated co-morbidities it is important that DST and 36 other neurodevelopmental conditions are considered in the APD diagnostic process, aligning with 37 the RDoC framework (6,29,41). The current study highlights that the auditory disability in APD is not 38 only limited to poor listening but also include DST and tinnitus. 39

The existing literature on hyperacusis and misophonia are mainly limited to the different triggers, 40 different emotional responses, influence of DST on daily life, and some associated mental health 41 conditions like anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorders (30). Limited amount of 42 literature exists on the association between DST and general health and cross-cultural variation 43 (32,38). However, a number of symptoms and conditions that may arise from the different systems 44

- represented within the RDoC framework have not been explored in a holistic way in evaluating DST. 45

- The presence of too many different diagnostic approaches in DST can be confusing and there is a 1
- need of prospective studies to develop a validated approach in evaluating DST in a holistic way, 2
- exploring all the different RDoC systems (6). 3

## Gender and DST 4

- The relationship between gender and DST found in this study is consistent with the literature, for 5 example the higher prevalence of misophonia in females (5,9,43,44) and that the impact of 6 misophonia on life being similar in both females and males (45). The literature emphasizes that the 7 diagnosis of DST and its impact on life are separate issues (30). Further studies are required to 8 establish if the higher prevalence of misophonia in females is related to the higher prevalence of 9 certain mental health conditions in females (46).  In contrast to misophonia, the higher prevalence of 10 hyperacusis alone in males in our study (61.7%) is also consistent with the 60.2% prevalence of 11 hyperacusis in males reported by Hall and colleagues (24). Our study adds by suggesting that despite 12 higher prevalence of hyperacusis in males the frequency of significant impact of hyperacusis were 13 lower in males compared to females. 14

The prevalence of tinnitus in children reported in this study (18.18 % in those without decreased sound tolerance, 30.48% in hyperacusis only, and 45.71% in misophonia with hyperacusis) is within

the range mentioned in a systematic review of the literature of tinnitus and hyperacusis in children

(37). Hall and colleagues (2016) reported a 42% prevalence of tinnitus in hyperacusis in 260 children aged 11 years (24). The high prevalence of tinnitus in misophonia in children as shown in the current

study is also consistent with the adult literature (4,12). Additionally, our study in children supports the notion that prevalence of tinnitus increases with age, and in an adult population with

## Prevalence of tinnitus in children with APD 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 hyperacusis prevalence of tinnitus has been reported to increase to around 86% (19). 23 DST and pure-tone audiometric measures 24 DST has been suggested to be related to increased sensitivity to high frequency tones.  Aazh and 25 colleagues reported that hearing thresholds at 8kHz were lower than that at 1 kHz, in predominantly 26 adults with more severe misophonia symptoms compared to those with lesser symptoms (12,22). 27 The current study could not be directly compared with the above study but demonstrated that the 28 High PTAvg was lower than the Low PTAvg irrespective of the presence or absence of DST.  The 29 present study adds to the literature by demonstrating that misophonia is associated with lower High 30 PTAvg compared to Low PTAvg in the right ear compared to those without DST. The ear asymmetry is 31 further discussed later in the ULL and tinnitus sections. 32 Journal Pre-proof

## Stapedial Reflex 33

The higher proportion of no response or absent stapedial reflexes in response to 4 kHz tones (20%, 34 24.7% and 23.4% in the 'Hyperacusis only', 'no DST' and 'Misophonia with hyperacusis' groups 35 respectively) compared to 1 kHz tone (5.8%, 3.8% and 6.1% in the 'Hyperacusis only', 'no DST' and 36 'Misophonia with hyperacusis' groups respectively) in the current study (table 2) is consistent with 37 the literature (34,35).  The mean SRTs reported in the current study (Table 3) are very similar to the 38 85 dB HL reported by Anari and colleagues (1999) in their study of 44 females (age range 22-76 39 years) and 56 males (age range 9-67 years) with hyperacusis (19). The above study also corroborates 40 the results of the current study, indicating that SRTs in response to different frequency tones do not 41 vary significantly. Saxena et al. (2020) reported that SRT could be elicited by broadband stimuli using 42

- intensity about 20 dB HL lower than that of pure-tone stimuli (17). Future research studies would be 43

- useful to explore if broadband stimuli would be more appropriate for stapedial reflex measurement 1
- in individuals with DST. 2

## ULL (Uncomfortable Loudness Level) 3

- Siepsiak and colleagues (2022) measured ULLs at 0.125, .5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 kHz tones in adults and 4
- reported mean ULLs of 84.4, 85.4, and 89.96 dB HL for misophonia, hyperacusis and a control group 5
- respectively for the right ear, and 86.5, 85, and 89.99 dB HL respectively for the left ear (44). The 6

7

above study reported no significant differences between the three groups in contrast to the current

15

study of lower ULLs in hyperacusis with or without misophonia compared to no DST. The present study is consistent with Aazh and colleagues reporting lower ULLs for high frequency tones

compared to low frequency tones in misophonia (12) and hyperacusis (22). However, unlike the current study, Aazh and colleagues (12,22) measured ULLs for a large number of tones including 8

kHz in evaluating patients with tinnitus and/or hyperacusis. The study by Aazh and colleagues compared one group with high misophonia scores with another group with low misophonia score

(12), but unlike the current study did not include a true control group without DST.  The above study did not find any ear asymmetry for ULL. In the current study ULLs for 4 kHz in the right ear were

16

lower at a highly significant levels (p&lt;.001) in both the groups with DST ('Misophonia with

- hyperacusis' and 'Hyperacusis only') compared to the 'No DST' group after adjusting for multiple 17 comparisons. In contrast 1 kHz ULLs in the left ear were significant at a lesser degree (p=.003) in both 18

19

the DST groups compared to the 'No DST' group. The above findings along with significant lower

20

21

22

23

24

pure-tone average for high frequency sounds in the right ear in the misophonia group suggest some asymmetry between the ears, and the right ear dominance may play a role. At this point it needs to

be noted that although the ULL 4-1kHz slope was weakly significant between misophonia and no DST

groups in the left ear (p=.035) and it almost reached significant level (p=.052) in the right ear. The number of participants with misophonia in the current study was small and future studies with larger

25

misophonia participants would be helpful to clarify the ear asymmetry.

- The wide variation in ULL values reported in the literature and the findings in this study support the 26 view that ULL have poor sensitivity and specificity (14) and is questionable as a diagnostic marker of 27 DST (1,13). The current study adds to the literature by suggesting that ULLs did not correlate with the 28 impact DST on daily life. 29

## Discrepancy between SRT and ULL and their clinical value 30

Journal Pre-proof

In contrast to ULL, stapedial reflex is seen as an objective measure of the integrity of the auditory 31 pathway and its sensitivity to sound (15,17,47). The findings of similar values of SRTs in those with 32 and without DST in the current study despite low ULLs in those with DST (table 3) is consistent with 33 the literature that there are no correlations between ULL and SRT (15). This raises the question if SRT 34 measurement can complement ULL in the clinical evaluation of DST. In the absence of any solid link 35 between auditory tests and DST, the value of subjecting individuals with DST to loud sounds to obtain 36 SRT and ULL may be questioned. 37

38

The absence of any difference in the SRTs in the three groups and low ULL in DST in the current study

39

40

would suggest that ULL is mediated by higher order brain networks compared to the brain stem involved in stapedial reflex. Both hyperacusis and misophonia are linked to activation of the limbic

41

system (11) and associated with anxiety, mental health issues and neurodevelopmental disorder

- (3,10,28). Different forms of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy such as positive affect labelling, 42
- emotional reappraisal, acceptance amongst others helps in the management of DST (48,49). For such 43
- approach to work it is important to convince individuals about the normal integrity of the ears and 44

- the auditory pathway, and that DST arise from negative interpretation of the sounds by the brain and 1
- influenced by different factors (4,17,18,20). In the APD clinics run by the corresponding author 2
- children are preconditioned by explaining the nature of DST prior to SRT and ULL measurements. In 3
- individuals with normal pure-tone audiogram, the presence of stapedial reflex helps in reassuring 4
- that the auditory pathway is intact, and the protective auditory reflex is responding normally to loud 5
- sounds. This in turn helps in the acceptance of ULL measurement with less variable results. In the 6
- longer term the audiological assessments help with the counselling, management, and monitoring 7 progress. 8

## Tinnitus and other audiological findings in DST 9

Tinnitus in 48 (32 plus 16) out of 140 participants with DST (hyperacusis only, 105 plus misophonia 10 with hyperacusis, 35) in the current study, suggests a prevalence of tinnitus in children with DST in 11 APD of 34%. This is lower than the 86% prevalence of tinnitus reported in adults with hyperacusis 12 (19) but is similar to the 27.7% prevalence of tinnitus in a collegiate population with likelihood of 13 hyperacusis and/or misophonia (50). The latter study is consistent with our current study 14 demonstrating a significant association between tinnitus and misophonia (50).  The current study 15 adds to the literature by demonstrating that low ULLs are not only associated with DST but also with 16 tinnitus in children without DST (Table 5).  Further research is needed to establish if these children 17 with tinnitus without DST develops DST later on life, or in other words if the tinnitus is a precursor of 18 DST. The significantly lower ULL for 4 kHz compared 1 kHz tone in the right ear in the 'No DST' group 19 with tinnitus and the relatively lower High PTAvg compared to Low PTAvg in the right ear in 20 misophonia may be linked to right ear dominance (51). In view of the findings, it would be important 21 to enquire about DST in children presenting with tinnitus. 22 OME and DST 23 Journal Pre-proof

Some of the participants of this study had a past history of otitis media with effusion (OME, glue 24 ear), years before their APD was diagnosed after resolution of OME with restoration of the hearing 25 thresholds to normal. Some studies suggest an association between OME and DST in young children 26 (26). Eight out of 10 children in the general population will develop OME at some point that resolves 27 spontaneously (23), therefore it is not surprising that many young children presenting with DST will 28 naturally have glue-ear. However, to establish an association between glue ear and DST there is a 29 need of a control group. The current study demonstrates that the prevalence of past history of OME 30 was similar in children with or without DST. The lack of any difference in the prevalence of past 31 history of OME in those with and without DST supports the view that temporary conductive loss may 32 increase the auditory gain for a short time, and it settles once the conductive hearing loss is restored 33 (52). The present study rules out past history of OME or glue-ear as a cause of DST. 34

## Limitations 35

- A number of issues limit the generalizability of the findings in this study that was carried out in 36 children diagnosed with APD. Consistent with the literature misophonia mostly co-existed with 37
- hyperacusis that makes it difficult to conclude if the lack of difference in the audiological 38
- characteristics found in this study was due to this overlap. Future research is needed to compare 39
- between 'misophonia without hyperacusis' and 'hyperacusis without misophonia'. This would involve 40
- a long-term study as the prevalence of 'misophonia without hyperacusis' is very small (3,4,11). The 41
- relatively smaller number of children in the 'misophonia with hyperacusis' group compared to the 42
- 'hyperacusis only' group is also an issue. There are ambiguities in the definitions of misophonia and 43
- hyperacusis in the current literature and future research is required to establish a clearer and 44

standardized definitions based on clinical presentation and neurophysiological basis (4). The 1 incorporation of all the systems within the RDoC framework may be a way to standardize the 2 evaluation of DST in a holistic way and reaching a consensus (6). In the current paper misophonia 3 referred to DST to sounds of chewing and eating as this is the predominant trigger (9)  and the term 4 'mastication rage' has been used (8) to refer to misophonia. Future research is needed to establish if 5 audiological, behavioural and emotional responses of children with DST to other body sounds such 6 as breathing, coughing, sneezing and others differ from those with hyperacusis and DST to chewing 7 and eating. 8

## Conclusion 9

The current study primarily aimed to explore if 'hyperacusis' and 'misophonia' could be 10 distinguished using routine audiological assessment.  Thresholds of individual pure-tones used in 11 pure-tone audiometry were not different between those with or without DST in children with APD 12 with thresholds considered to be within normal limits of 20 dB HL. However, 'misophonia with 13 hyperacusis' group had lower pure-tone average of high frequency (8, 10, 12.5 kHz) tones compared 14 to pure-tone average of low frequency (.25, .5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz) tones in the right ear compared to the 15 'No DST' group. Ipsilateral SRTs were similar irrespective of DST. ULLs were lower in both 'misophonia 16 with hyperacusis' and 'hyperacusis only' groups compared to those without DST. However, ULLs did 17 not vary significantly weather the DST had significant or non-significant impact on daily life. In the 18 'No DST' group those with tinnitus had lower ULL for 4 kHz compared to 1 kHz tone in the right ear 19 compared to those without tinnitus. There were some inconsistencies regarding the ear asymmetry 20 for ULL and future studies are required with larger sample of misophonia. The study findings are 21 consistent with the literature that stapedial reflex involves the inner ears and the brain stem (17) , 22 while hyperacusis, misophonia and tinnitus involves higher order brain networks mediating 23 emotional responses and anxiety (11). The study is consistent with the literature that there is no 24 direct link between audiological findings and DST (18). However, audiological assessment in DST is 25 considered useful for clinical evaluation, counselling and management. 26 Journal Pre-proof

- Tinnitus was more common in 'misophonia with hyperacusis' group compared to 'hyperacusis only' 27 and 'No DST' groups, and in the 'hyperacusis only' group compared to the 'No DST' group. Children 28 with misophonia with or without tinnitus and children with tinnitus in the 'hyperacusis only' and the 29 'No DST' groups were older.  The study findings are consistent with the literature that stapedial reflex 30 involves the inner ears and the brain stem (17) , while hyperacusis, misophonia and tinnitus involves 31 higher order brain networks mediating emotional responses and anxiety (11). We suggest that DST 32 and tinnitus are considered as auditory disabilities in addition to different types of listening 33 difficulties in evaluating APD, and DST needs to be explored in children presenting with tinnitus. 34
- Misophonia was more prevalent in females but the frequency of significant impact of misophonia on 35 daily life were similar in both females and males. In contrast to misophonia, hyperacusis was more 36 prevalent in males but significant impact of hyperacusis on daily living was more frequent in females. 37
- The association between DST and past history of OME was also explored in this study. Similar 38 prevalence of past history of glue-ear in APD children with or without DST suggests that OME is 39 unlikely to be a factor leading to DST in older children and adolescents. 40

** Participants with tinnitus were significantly older than those without tinnitus in the 'Hyperacusis only' (p=.007) and the 'No DST' (p=.003) groups. In the 'No DST' group children with tinnitus had highly significant low ULL for 4 kHz tone (p=.003) with highly significant larger difference between the 4 and 1 kHz tones (p=.001) in the right ear.

*Participants in the 'No DST' group children with tinnitus had mildly significant low ULL values for 1kHz (p=.013) and 4 kHz (p=.015) tones in the left ear compared to those without tinnitus.

Title: A Retrospective Study of Audiological Characteristics of Hyperacusis versus Misophonia in Children with Auditory Processing Disorder

## Highlights:

- Â· Hyperacusis, misophonia and tinnitus are auditory disabilities in addition to the main symptom of listening difficulty in developmental auditory processing disorder.
- Â· Routine audiological measures can not distinguish between hyperacusis and misophonia.
- Â· Misiphonia is more common in females but the severity of impact on life are similar in both males and females.
- Â· Hyperacusis more common in males but the frequency of significant impact of hyperacusis on life is higher in females.
- Â· Stapedial reflex thresholds are similar in those with and without decreased sound tolerance (DST).
- Â· Uncomfortable loudness levels (ULLs) are low in DST but ULLs do not reflect the frequency of significant impact of DST on life.
- Â· In children without DST, ULLs are lower in those with tinnitus compared to those without tinnitus.
- Â· DST is not related to history of otitis media with effusion in early childhood.
