Misophonia was recently defined as a disorder charac-
terized by intolerance of specific auditory stimuli and
associated cues causing significant psychologicaldistress and interference in social, occupational, or aca-demic functioning [1]. Aversive stimuli in this context
may be labeled as “triggers ”that are commonly repeti-
tive sounds produced by others. Primary triggeringstimuli in misophonia most often (but not always)
originate from facial (eg, nose noises, throat-clearing)
or oral (eg, lip-smacking, chewing, drinking) sources.However, there are individual differences in the types
of cues and contexts (eg, the same sound may have
different effects when produced by specific people)associated with misophonia symptoms [2,3].
Individuals with impairing levels of misophonia
symptoms may have strong multi-modal emotional re-sponses to contexts in which triggering cues are antici-pated or encountered. For example, common responses
include central (eg, insula) [4] and peripheral nervous
system activation (eg, increased heart rate and skinconductance) [5], negative affect (eg, irritation, anger,
anxiety, disgust) [6,7], and behavioral patterns that canbe conceptualized as consistent with freeze (eg, hypervig-
ilance), flight (eg, escape or avoidance behavior), and
fight behaviors (eg, interpersonally aggressive verbalbehavior) [8]. These responses are highly distressingand different than how most others might react [1].
Jastreboff and Jastreboff are credited for coining the
term misophonia over 20 years ago [9]. The term trans-lates to hatred or dislike (miso) of sound (phonia).
However, this literal translation is misleading, as the
condition is neither uniquely associated with the affec-tive experience of hate or dislike, nor are auditory cues
the only stimuli that can function as triggers. The first
pilot studies directly examining misophonia were pub-lished only 9 years ago [5,10]. Since then, over 60 pub-
lished empirical studies have investigated misophonia,
with roughly 25% of these published over the lastyear in the first special section in a peer-reviewed scien-tific journal dedicated to misophonia ( Frontiers in
Neuroscience ).
Recent reviews suggest that misophonia may be
associated with a wide variety of mental health problems
[1–3]. The majority of studies have used self-report

methodologies and have found that misophonia symp-
tom severity is positively correlated transdiagnostically
with, for example, neuroticism, anxiety symptoms,depressive symptoms, difficulties with emotion regula-
tion, affective instability, anxiety sensitivity, some
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms,perfectionism, and somatic pain [11 –19]. Additionally,
adults with misophonia may be significantly more likely
than those without misophonia to self-report a lifetime
history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder(ADHD), OCD, bipolar disorder, substance use disor-
der, post-traumatic stress disorder, and conversion disor-
der [17,20].
Two recent studies have used structured psychiatric
diagnostic interviews as a more rigorous approach to
the assessment of misophonia and associated mentalhealth problems. In one study, 575 adults presenting
for treatment at a clinic in Amsterdam were interviewed
using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview[21], a structured interview assessing 15 current psychi-atric problems (Jager and colleagues, 2020a) [14]. Re-
sults indicated that most (72%) participants did not
meet the full criteria for a current psychiatric disorder.The most common current disorders were mood disor-
ders (10.1%), anxiety disorders (9%), ADHD (5.4%),
and personality disorders (5%).
Rosenthal and colleagues [8] conducted the first study
to characterize diagnsotic and statistical manual of mental
disorders (DSM-5) disorders using structured diagnosticinterviews in a nationally recruited community sampleof 207 adults with high misophonia symptoms. Results
indicated that anxiety disorders were the most common
type of current mental health problem (56.9%). Addi-tionally, high rates of lifetime history of psychiatric dis-
orders were observed, including diagnoses of any
anxiety (73%), mood (61%), obsessive-compulsive(27%), substance use (26%), trauma-related (24%),
eating (18%), or personality disorders (13%).
The findings from Jager and colleagues [14] suggest
that most adults seeking outpatient treatment of miso-
phonia in Amsterdam may not have a current psychiat-
ric disorder. In contrast, Rosenthal and colleagues [8]indicate that adults across the United States with highmisophonia symptoms may be most likely to meet
the full criteria for a current anxiety disorder or lifetime
history of any anxiety or mood disorders. A consistentinterpretation of findings across all studies is that higher
misophonia symptoms do not appear to be uniquely
related to any specific psychiatric disorder. Accordingly,it is premature to conclude that any specific treatment
protocol for any specific psychiatric disorder is best
for the treatment of misophonia.TREATMENT OF MISOPHONIA
Multi-Disciplinary Model: Audiology
There is no gold standard evidence-based treatment ofmisophonia, and it is not a disorder within the purview
of any specific clinical discipline. Because it appears to
be a problem at the intersection of various clinicalfields, a multi-disciplinary treatment model may bevaluable. For example, audiologists may be important
in the assessment and treatment of misophonia as it
is defined as a sound intolerance condition. Becausemisophonia may need to be differentiated from hyper-
acusis, audiologists may be helpful in assessment and
treatment planning. For example, audiologists use eval-uative measures to assess sensitivity thresholds and can
discern if one is hypersensitive to auditory stimuli.
With regard to treatment, audiologists can work with
patients to determine the pros and cons of using sound-
based therapies. These approaches use patient-
controlled devices unobtrusively placed in the ear canalto diminish (eg, noise cancellation), mask (eg, staticbrown or white noise), and change responses to audi-
tory input. Although these interventions have not
been tested empirically using randomized trials forthe treatment of misophonia, promising support has
come from clinical observations reported by Jastreboff
and Jastreboff, who pioneered the adaptation ofTinnitus Retraining Therapy for patients with misopho-
nia and report high rates of success in uncontrolled tri-
als [22]. This approach uses sound therapy andbehavioral training to change response patterns to trig-gering contexts and cues, and was reported by the devel-
opers to be highly effective in a clinical setting.
Multi-Disciplinary Model: Occupational
Therapy
Because misophonia may occur in the context of multi-
sensory over-responsivity, it may be valuable to include
occupational therapists in a multi-disciplinary assess-ment and treatment approach. Occupational therapistsemphasize improvement of functioning across key do-
mains of life. Because occupational therapists are the ex-
perts in sensory processing within health care, they mayoffer helpful coping strategies to manage misophonia
effectively. Occupational therapy includes treatments
designed to help improve central sensory processingthrough interventions designed to enhance sensory
integration functioning. Treatments may identify and
intervene upon environmental barriers to adaptive sen-sory processing or train new adaptive reactions to
emotionally evocative sensory cues. Like approaches
used by audiologists, there are no randomized2 Rosenthal, Shan, Trumbull

controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of occupational
therapy interventions with misophonia. However, these
interventions have a long history of being used toimprove sensory processing, and, as such, may be worth
considering for those with misophonia.
Multi-Disciplinary Model: Mental Health
Some early clinical observations [22] and the large
study by Jager and colleagues [14] indicate that adultswith misophonia may present for treatment without
co-occurring psychiatric disorders. On the other hand,
there is a growing body of research and clinical observa-tions pointing to misophonia occurring in the context
of varied and debilitating psychiatric disorders [8] and
an associated need for mental health professionals tobe involved in the treatment of this disorder. Accord-
ingly, evaluation and treatment recommendations
from mental health providers are indicated in a multi-disciplinary model of care for misophonia.
Treatment Studies
Most publications describing possible psychotherapies
for misophonia have been small case studies (Table 1)
[23–35]. These treatments were mostly conducted using
branded (eg, acceptance and commitment therapy;
ACT) and non-branded interventions from the family
of cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs), and the au-thors reported descriptions of successful treatment inone or several individuals.
Examples of non-branded interventions include
cognitive restructuring [23,24,26,30 –32,35], relaxa-
tion exercises [26,28,32,35], counter-conditioning
[27,28], acceptance and distress tolerance strategies
[25,26,29,30,33,35], exposure and response preven-tion [23 –26,30 –32,34], interpersonal communication
skills [24,32,33], attentional control skills [24,30,34],
and parent management training [26,32]. Case studiesare useful beginning points for treatment development
and provide a direction for clinicians in the absence of
a clear gold standard of care. However, these casestudies do not provide compelling evidence of efficacyfor any particular intervention.
OPEN TRIALS
Three open trials have been conducted to treat miso-phonia [36 –38]. Schröder and colleagues [38] conduct-
ed an uncontrolled trial involving 90 adults with
misophonia, showing promise for a cognitive behav-ioral approach using brief group therapy. In this trial,
48% of participants improved on a clinician rating of
outcome, and 30% reported a significant reduction insymptoms on a self-report measure of misophonia.
The treatment included four main components: (1)
attentional shifting away from trigger stimuli, (2)counter-conditioning to disrupt classically conditioned
associations between neutral/positive stimuli that have
become paired with negative emotional experiences,(3) stimulus manipulation exercises (allowing theparticipant to manipulate trigger sounds), and (4) relax-
ation exercises. Because this intervention occurs in a
group, validation and support from other sufferersmay also be an important component of this treatment.
Frank and McKay reported that 18 participants
received 12 sessions of exposure therapy before or afterstress management training [36]. The exposure proced-
ure used an inhibitory learning model, emphasizing
altered expectations for the target sounds along withthe deliberate practice of hearing sounds on an individ-
ual hierarchy. Rather than targeting habituation of psy-
chological distress when exposed to triggers, theinhibitory learning approach to exposure enhances pa-tient motivation to approach triggering cues and con-
texts by changing the features of these cues or their
responses to them in an effort to change expectations,increase psychological flexibility, enhance valued ac-
tions, and increase the perception of control over reac-
tions to misophonic cues. This study demonstratesthat without habituation to certain sounds, inhibitory
learning-based exposure procedures may be a prom-
ising way to enhance perceived control over emotionalreactions to misophonia triggers.
Finally, Jager and colleagues [37] used an open trial
to evaluate the efficacy of eye movement desensitiza-
tion and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy in treating miso-phonia in eight participants. Misophonia-related
emotionally disturbing memories were addressed with
EMDR in an average of 2.6 sessions lasting 60 to 90 mi-nutes. Participants reported a statistically significant
20% average reduction (with a large effect size estimate
ofd51.14) in symptoms of misophonia on a self-
report measure of misophonia. No statistically signifi-
cant changes were observed in psychological distress
or impairment in functioning on secondary outcomemeasures. Due to the uncontrolled experimental designof these open trials, no definitive conclusions can be
drawn from these studies about treatment efficacy,
though these are valuable studies pointing to possibletreatments to further evaluate.

a cross-over design, adults with misophonia ( N554)
were randomly assigned to 3 months of weekly CBT
in a group therapy format or to a waitlist. Participantswere assessed at baseline, 3 months (following CBT or
waitlist), 6 months (after cross-over), and between
months 15 and 18 (1-year follow-up). CBT groupsincluded task concentration, arousal reduction, positiveaffect labeling, and stimulus manipulation. Across all
participants, symptoms of misophonia reduced by
32% after 3 months of CBT (a large effect size estimateofd51.97). Clinical improvement was observed in
37% of the CBT group compared to 0% in the waiting
list group. Those who responded to CBT at post-treatment demonstrated no significant changes in
symptoms of misophonia 1 year later, suggesting the ef-
fects of CBT maintained over time.
This randomized trial is the clearest evidence sup-
porting the use of any specific treatment of misophonia.
However, it should be noted that the comparison con-dition was an unblinded wait list control without anyactive intervention components. Additional studies are
needed comparing this protocol to credible control con-
ditions featuring non-specific factors such as psycho-education, therapist time and attention, validation,
and/or support. Nonetheless, the findings of this trial
and, collectively, the combined findings across the pre-liminary case studies and open trials largely indicate
that components from CBTs (eg, cognitive restructuring,
exposure and counter-conditioning, relaxation exer-cises, interpersonal communication, and acceptance-based skills) may be reasonable for clinicians to
consider and in need of future study as treatments of
misophonia in both youth and adults.
TRANSDIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES TO
PSYCHOTHERAPY
Unified Protocol
As outlined, early studies suggest misophonia (a) is not
best accounted for by any psychiatric disorder, (b) is asso-
ciated with various transdiagnostic psychological prob-
lems, and (c) pilot studies developing promisingtreatments have used various interventions from the fam-
ily of CBTs. Accordingly, when considering which treat-
ment approaches to scientifically evaluate, it is unclearwhether it is appropriate to use a specific branded psy-
chotherapy protocol designed for a specific diagnosis.
Although untested, transdiagnostic psychotherapiesmay be a flexible and pragmatic alternative. The Unified
Protocol (UP) is a reasonable candidate for transdiagnos-
tic psychotherapy to consider, as it has been developedand evaluated for use with a wide range of “emotional
disorders, ”including anxiety and mood disorders [40].
The UP is a 16-week skills-based treatment that con-
sists of five core modules: mindful emotional awareness,
cognitive flexibility, identifying and changing emotional
avoidance, increasing tolerance of emotion-relatedphysical sensations, and emotional exposures [41]. Pa-tients with misophonia may be characterized by prob-
lems with emotional reactivity, limited access to
emotion regulation strategies, and intolerance ofelevated physical sensations when exposed to trigger
sounds [13,42]. The core modules in the UP target these
processes. The transdiagnostic approach of the UP hasdemonstrated efficacy against single-disorder treatments
in multiple studies [41,43]. This success may be due to
the high rates of co-occurrence between emotional dis-orders, with anxiety and depressive disorders having life-
time rates of co-occurrence as high as 75% [43]. As
examples of efficacy, the UP has demonstrated improve-ments in anxiety [41], OCDs [44], and dysregulatedanger across a range of clinical presentations [45]. Pa-
tients with misophonia may have high rates of co-
occurring mental health problems [8,14], suggestingthat the UP may be a helpful approach to consider.
Although a recent case study examined UP as a
possible treatment of adolescents with misophonia[46], controlled clinical trials are needed before conclu-
sions can be made about the efficacy of UP for miso-
phonia. Our own research team is currentlyconducting preliminary open trials and developing amanual using the UP to treat adults with misophonia.
Of eight participants treated with the UP, none dropped
out of the treatment, and all reported that they foundthe treatment helpful. Patients also reported that
learning about their own unhelpful coping mechanisms
was important, as was enhanced skill use for emotionalresponses to trigger sounds [47].
Process-Based Therapy (PBT)
Although manualized models of psychotherapy such asthe UP may be helpful, another candidate approach
that is transdiagnostic and highly flexible is the PBT
framework [48]. In PBT, therapists leverage evidence-based therapeutic processes that are common across
therapies (eg, strong therapeutic alliance, empathy, sup-
port, motivational enhancement) and specific proced-ures used across protocols for various diagnoses and
problems (eg, the list of interventions in Table 1). PBT
assessment features functional analyses to identify mal-adaptive and adaptive patterns and measurement-based
care using both qualitative and psychometrically vali-
dated quantitative measures of functioning and change6 Rosenthal, Shan, Trumbull

processes. Additionally, targets for treatment are collab-
oratively selected in a sequence that is acceptable to pa-
tients and intended to impact other targets in a networkof related change processes. This enables an emphasis
on patient strengths and empowerment, with assump-
tions of non-linear change leading to iterative and flex-ible changes in targets and therapeutic proceduresthroughout treatment.
When using PBT for misophonia, a therapist and pa-
tient determine through functional analyses that thereare problematic patterns before, during, or after being
triggered across attentional (eg, hypervigilance), cogni-
tive (eg, internal, stable, and global attributions), physi-ological (eg, sympathetic arousal), social (eg, verbal
confrontations), or other behavioral (eg, avoidance or
escape behavior) levels of functioning. After discerningspecific personally-relevant patterns, problematic pat-
terns are collaboratively prioritized for targeted change.
Next, therapeutic procedures known empirically toimpact targeted patterns are offered by the therapist,and the patient chooses the one they are most willing
and able to do (eg, to reduce physiological arousal
when triggered, the patient could choose any protocolknown to reduce sympathetic arousal). The intervention
is administered, the patient applies the intervention in
their daily life, and measures are taken to determine theeffects of the intervention. When progress is made on a
prioritized target, the patient selects the next most prior-
itized target to address, and the process repeats itself untilpatients are satisfied that they have met treatment goals.PBT is an approach that our group is currently testing
for misophonia, with a manual under development iter-
atively based on patient feedback. As such, it is unknownif this approach is efficacious for misophonia.
RESEARCH AGENDA FOR TREATMENT
DEVELOPMENT
Mechanistic Translational Studies
Studies identifying underlying neurobehavioral mecha-
nisms of misophonia are needed to develop optimal in-
terventions that target precise biological, social, orbehavioral change processes. Candidate targets include
difficulties with attention (eg, hypervigilance toward
possible misophonic cues), cognition (eg, attributionalstyles, hopelessness), behavior (eg, avoidance, escape),
social (eg, indirect aggression), and emotional (eg, sensi-
tivity, reactivity) processes. As researchers seek todiscover underlying biopsychosocial change processes
in misophonia, it will be important to do so using
multi-method studies with objective laboratory-basedmeasures. Processes that are unique to misophonia
and those shared with other sound intolerance or mental
health conditions need to be elucidated empirically us-ing thoughtful experimental and statistical approaches.
Global Research with Diverse Participants
To date, most studies investigating misophonia have
included disproportionately White, educated women
as participants. It may be that these demographic factorsalign with access to knowledge about misophonia or
motivation to participate in research. However, some
studies using sampling methodologies with more repre-sentative approaches have not reported gender differ-
ences in misophonia symptoms [49]. Similarly, no
studies have explored ethnicity, race, or multiculturalconsiderations related to misophonia. To understandthe nature and features of misophonia for all people,
it is essential for researchers to use sampling methods
that include diverse participants.
Multi-Disciplinary Treatment Models
Although a multi-disciplinary model of evaluations and
treatment is recommended as a general strategy, there
are no studies empirically testing this approach. Todetermine for whom, how, and why this model maybe helpful, multi-disciplinary research is needed. This
could include direct testing of such an approach
compared to usual treatment or discipline-specific inter-ventions. This also could include using adaptive designs
that begin with fewer resources and, for those who are
non-responsive, randomizing participants to higherresource treatment approaches.
Psychoeducation and Support
It is uncommon for clinical providers or the lay public to
have extensive knowledge about misophonia. This
overall lack of public awareness about misophoniafrequently translates into patients and loved ones
needing foundational psychoeducation and support in
how to make sense of and manage misophonia. Partic-ularly for caregivers and those with somewhat less
impairing misophonia presentations, it may be that psy-
choeducation and support can serve as an important,low-cost, and scalable component of an overall treat-ment approach. Studies are needed to examine whether,
for whom, and how such approaches can be helpful.
Digital Health
Another recommended approach for treatment develop-
ment is the use of digital health-based models of care.
This could include, for example, interventions using mo-
bile phones with misophonia support apps to screen,Treatment of Misophonia 7

educate, support, and provide specific real-time interven-
tions targeting underlying mechanistic change processes
(eg, attentional hypervigilance, emotional reactivity, in-direct interpersonal aggression, approach or avoidance
behavior, cognitive reframing, or defusion). In addition,
digital health approaches that train novel coping skills invirtual environments or with augmented reality coulddirectly target underlying mechanistic targets of change
and, in some instances, provide real-time feedback and
tailored interventions based on user input and machinelearning. These platforms can provide immersive and
engaging experiences that may be more desirable for
some than conventional treatment approaches such aspsychotropic medication or psychotherapy.

psychiatric disorders or other health problems. Start
treatment with a multi-disciplinary strategy of evalu-ations and treatment recommendations across audi-ology, occupational therapy, and mental health
providers.
/C15There are no cures, evidence-based medications, or
proven treatments for misophonia. Aim to enhancefunctioning using interventions known to impact pri-
mary processes underlying problematic patterns
(physiological arousal, attention, cognition, behavior,communication).
/C15Given the absence of a proven mental health treat-
ment of misophonia, transdiagnostic evidence-based
therapies (eg, UP) and flexible patient-centered
frameworks leveraging evidence-based change pro-cess may be useful to tailor interventions to the indi-
vidual (eg, PBT), although require further evaluation.
/C15Habituation-based exposure therapy is not indicated,
but inhibitory learning models of exposure therapymay be helpful as part of a broader treatmentapproach.8 Rosenthal, Shan, Trumbull
