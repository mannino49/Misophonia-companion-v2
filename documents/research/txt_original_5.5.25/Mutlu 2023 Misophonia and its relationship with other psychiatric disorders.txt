## Abstract

Aim: Research  show  that  misophonia  accompanies  many  psychiatric  disorders  and  should  be  considered  a  mental  disorder. Although there are suggested diagnostic criteria, no clear ones have been defined yet. This study aims to investigate the relationship of misophonia with other mental disorders and to determine its possible category in diagnostic classification systems.

Material and Methods: We included the patients who applied to the outpatient clinics of the XX University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry for the first time and healthy volunteers without a history of psychiatric disorder. A sociodemographic data form, Misophonia Interview Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS), and Yale-Brown Obsession Compulsion Rating Scale (YBOCS) were administered to the participants.

Results: 60.1% of the participants (n=158) did not have misophonia, 21.3% (n=56) had disorder-level misophonia, and 18.6% (n=49) had symptom-level misophonia. Except for the YBOCS-total and obsession/compulsion scale scores of the group with misophonia, all  other  mean  scale  scores  were  significantly  higher  than  those  without  misophonia  (p&lt;0.05  for  each).  The  participants  with misophonia were mostly in the group diagnosed with anxiety disorders. There was a moderately positive correlation between the Misophonia Symptom List total score and the BAI score in participants with an anxiety disorder (p=0.001).

Conclusion: The higher scale scores of individuals with misophonia support that it may be a mental disorder. The results that misophonia most frequently accompanies anxiety disorders and is associated with the severity of anxiety suggest that it can be classified  as  an  anxiety  disorder  in  the  diagnostic  classification.  Recognition  of  misophonia  by  clinicians  and  the  development treatment algorithms will increase patients' quality of life.

## INTRODUCTION

Misophonia is a term derived from the Latin words 'misos,' meaning 'dislike,' and 'phonia,' meaning 'sound,' meaning dislike, aversion to sound (1). It is a pronounced discomfort from  various  sounds,  leading  to  negative  feelings  such as  irritability,  overwhelm,  and  disgust,  and  significantly affecting the person's occupational functions, social life, and  relationships,  leading  to  impaired  functioning.  The most  commonly  disturbing  sounds  are  gum  chewing, mouth smacking, breathing, and foot rubbing (2).

Although there is no dysfunction in the pathways related to  hearing,  it  is  postulated  that  misophonia  occurs  due to  heightened  or  strong  connections  in  the  limbic  and sympathetic  nervous  systems,  which  cause  abnormal processes triggered by sound (3-5). In misophonia, there is inappropriate and severe stimulation of the limbic and autonomic nervous systems due to the association of a harmless sound with a negative or unpleasant situation (6). Although there is still insufficient data on the prevalence of misophonia, studies suggest that it is not uncommon (7). In a study researching the prevalence of misophonia in the healthy population, approximately 80% of the sample had  misophonia  symptoms,  and  10%  of  the  group  with misophonia symptoms were diagnosed with misophonia (8). There is no clear information in the literature about the age of onset of misophonia. In most studies, symptoms of  misophonic  individuals  were  reported  to  start  before adolescence (9).

Misophonia  is  not  included  in  the  current  diagnostic classification systems  (10). For this reason, several diagnostic  criteria  have  been  proposed  for  diagnosing misophonia, and studies have been conducted accordingly. Schröder  et  al.  (11)  proposed  diagnostic  criteria  for misophonia  and  developed  the  Amsterdam  Misophonia Scale using the Yale-Brown Obsession Compulsion Scale (12). Similarly, Öz et al. (8) and Dozier et al. (7,13) developed diagnostic criteria for misophonia.

Various  sources  have  proposed  that  misophonia  may be  comorbid  with  other  psychiatric  disorders  such  as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety Disorders, Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) and should be included in the spectrum of Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders (8,11,14). In previous  studies,  Post  Traumatic  Stress Disorder (PTSD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders diagnosed in patients with misophonia (15). In addition, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (14),  tic  disorders  (16),  and  eating  disorders  (17)  are among the psychiatric disorders that have been presented to be associated with misophonia.

Studies  related  to  misophonia,  which  has  a  history  of about twenty years, have become widespread today. These studies will help determine the place and importance of misophonia  among  mental  disorders  soon.  Our  study aims to explore the relationship between misophonia and other mental disorders and to contribute to determining its possible place in diagnostic classification systems.

## MATERIAL AND METHOD

## Sample

Power analysis of the study was performed with G Power 3.1 program. With a medium effect size (Cohen's d=0.50), a power of 0.95, and a margin of error of 0.05 (p=0.05), the minimum sample size required to be in a single group was calculated as 105, totaling 210 people. We concluded that the sample of 263 people had sufficient power.

The  study  included  213  literate  patients  between  the ages of 18 and 65 years, who were admitted to Çukurova University  Faculty  of  Medicine,  Department  of  Mental Health and Disorders for the first time between 15.10.2020 and 15.04.2021, and 50 healthy volunteers from hospital staff and their relatives who agreed to participate in the study,  had  no  history  of  psychiatric  disorders  and  were not receiving treatment. We did not include the patients with an anatomical defect in the external auditory canal as a finding of physical examination, who reported hearing defects, and who used hearing aids. To prevent possible confounding  effects  of  auditory  hallucinations,  patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder,  major  depressive  disorder  with  psychotic  features, and schizotypal personality disorder were excluded from the study. In addition, we did not include individuals with neurocognitive disorders and mental retardation, as they could not complete the self-report scales.

## Procedure and measures

The Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics Committee  of  Çukurova  University  Faculty  of  Medicine approved  the  study  on  02.10.2020  (meeting  number 104). The study was conducted by the Principles of the Declaration  of  Helsinki,  and  all  participants  signed  an informed consent form.

The mental disorders were diagnosed with the Structured Clinical  Interview  for  DSM-5  Disorders-Clinician  version (SCID-5/CV), and the diagnosis of misophonia  was determined  with  the  Misophonia  Interview  Scale.  We administered to the participants the sociodemographic/ clinical data form developed by us, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Yale-Brown Obsession Compulsion Rating Scale (YBOCS) and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS). The first author accompanied the participants who had difficulty completing the forms and  scales  and  explained  the  points  where  they  had difficulty.

Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Disorders -Clinician version (SCID-5/CV): First et al. developed the  Structured  Clinical  Interview  for  DSM-5  Disorders (SCID-5)  (18).  The  Turkish  validity  and  reliability  study of the SCID-5 was conducted. There are ten modules in the  SCID-5:  1)  psychotic  symptoms,  2)  disorders  with psychosis, 3) mood disorder, 4) substance use disorder, 5) anxiety disorder, 6) OCD and related disorders, 7) PTSD, 8) ADHD 9) questions about screening for other disorders 10) adjustment disorder (18,19).

Sociodemographic/Clinical  Data  Form: With  this  form, data such as age, gender, duration of education, marital status, occupation, place of residence, history of physical illness, and  family  history  of  mental  disorders  were questioned.  The  patient's  or  relatives'  statements  and hospital or national health system records were utilized when questioning additional physical illnesses. This form was completed jointly by the participant and the clinician.

Misophonia  Interview  Scale: Öz  et  al. developed  the misophonia  interview  scale  (8,20).  In  our  study,  the diagnostic criteria recommended by Öz et al. were used, and the form of "Sound Disturbance Problems" was added to the misophonia interview scale.

The Sound Disturbance Problems Form was used to differentiate between hyperacusis, misophonia, phonophobia,  and  tinnitus.  This  form,  which  includes explanations and examples, was applied to the participants with  sound  sensitivity.  The  participants  who  answered hyperacusis, phonophobia, or tinnitus were included in the non-misophonia group.

The  Misophonia  Symptom  List  (MSL), another  step  of the misophonia interview scale, was administered to the participants who gave appropriate answers to the Sound Disturbance Problems Form. The MSL is a form that allows 50  different  voices  to  be  questioned  and  a  four-point Likert-type  (1=none,  2=somewhat,  3=moderately,  4=very

much)  indicating  the  severity  of  misophonia.  The  total score for the severity of the misophonia varies between 50-200. With this form, it is determined how severely the participants  are  disturbed  by  which  sound.  In  order  to make the distinction between "disorder-level misophonia" and "symptom-level misophonia," participants who answered 'moderate or very' on the MSL were asked to fill out a form that included questions about their physical/ emotional reactions and functionality.

Participants who responded "moderate or very" to at least one of the emotional/physical responses to sound (fear, disgust, anger, overwhelm/depression, blurred vision, blood pressure, sweating, shortness of breath, dry mouth), in addition to marking "moderate or very" in the question: "How  much  does  your  discomfort  (or  avoidance)  with sound affect your life?", answering " yes" to one of these questions:  "Are  there  things  you  cannot  do  because  of sound?'', "Are there any places you cannot enter because of the voices?", "Have these voices caused any deterioration in your  relationships?"  or  answering  "more  than  one hour" to the question: "How much of your day is affected by  problems  related  to  this  condition?"  were  defined  as having "disorder-level  misophonia." Participants  who  did not meet this condition at any level (physical/emotional response or functionality  questions)  and  who  answered "moderate or very" to at least one sound in the MSL were defined as having "symptom-level misophonia." (8,20).

Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI): It is a scale consisting of 21 questions to measure the frequency of anxiety symptoms. BAI  consists  of  four  Likert-type  questions  scored  from 0 to 3. The total score ranges from 0 to 63. An increase in the total score indicates an increase in the frequency of  anxiety.  In  the  Turkish  validity  and  reliability  study, Cronbach's alpha value was 0.93 (21,22).

Beck  Depression  Inventory  (BDI): BDI  is  a  self-report scale comprising 21 questions developed to measure the emotion,  cognition,  behavior,  and  somatic  components of  depression.  The  scale  consists  of  four  Likert-type questions scored from 0 to 3, and the scale's total score varies  between  0  and  63.  In  the  Turkish  validity  and reliability study, Cronbach's alpha value was 0.80 (23,24).

Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS): It is a self-report scale consisting of 30 items designed to assess impulsivity, and each item provides a four-point Likert-type measurement (1=never/rarely, 2=sometimes, 3=often, 4=almost always). BIS  includes  three  components:  attentional  impulsivity, motor impulsivity,  and  non-planning.  An  increase  in  the scale's total score means a higher level of impulsivity. In the Turkish reliability and validity study, Cronbach's alpha value was 0.81 (25,26).

Yale-Brown Obsession Compulsion Rating Scale (YBOCS): YBOCS is developed to measure the severity of obsessions and  compulsions  and  is  evaluated  by  the  interviewer according to the patient's symptoms. Although there are 19 items on the scale, the obsessions and compulsions scores  (5  items  each)  are  used  to  calculate  the  total score. Each item is scored between 0 and 4 points, and the scale's total score varies between 0 and 40 points. In the Turkish validity and reliability study, Cronbach's alpha value was 0.81 (12,27).

## Statistical Analysis

IBM SPSS 25 program was used for data analysis. When the  skewness and kurtosis values of the variables were between  -1.5  and  +1.5,  they  were  considered  normally distributed,  and  histogram  graphs  were  analyzed  (28). Whether  the  variables  with  normal  distribution  differed between groups in terms of their means was examined by  independent  groups  t-test  and  shown  as  mean  and standard  deviation  (mean±SD).  The  Mann-Whitney  U test was used to examine whether the variables that did not  show  normal  distribution  differed  between  groups regarding  their  medians  and  were  shown  as  medians and  quartiles.  Pearson  Correlation  analysis  was  used to  examine  the  correlation  between  numerical  variables since  they  were  normally  distributed.  In  the  analysis  of categorical  variables,  the  Fisher  Exact  test  was  used  if the  expected  number  of  observations  was  less  than  5, the  Yates  statistic  was  used  if  the  expected  number  of observations was between 5 and 25, and the Chi-square test was used in other possibilities. A value of p&lt;0.05 was accepted as significant in the analyses.

## RESULTS

According to the Sound Disturbance Problems form, 48.7% of the participants (n=128) stated that they had no sound sensitivity. 39.9% (n=105) stated that they were disturbed by sound in line with misophonia. 5.3% (n=14) stated that they had hyperacusis, 4.6% (n=12) had tinnitus, and 1.5% (n=4) had phonophobia.

According to the Sound Disturbance Problems form, no significant difference was found between the groups with (n=105) and without (n=158) misophonia in terms of mean age,  duration  of  education,  gender  distribution,  marital status, employment status, and place of residence (p=0.78, p=0.17, p=0.14, p=0.67, p=0.15, p=0.22, respectively). 39% (n=41)  of  the  participants  reported  that  their  relatives also had misophonia symptoms. The sociodemographic characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1.

In the group with misophonia, 53.3% (n=56) had an anxiety disorder,  16.2%  (n=17)  had  major  depressive  disorder, 11.4% (n=12) had OCD, 5.7% (n=6) had ADHD, 1.9% (n=2) were  diagnosed  with  somatic  symptom  disorder,  1.9% (n=2) with tic disorder, 1% (n=1) with PTSD and 8.6% (n=9) had no diagnosis of mental disorder (healthy individuals). In  the  group  without  misophonia,  41.1%  (n=65)  had  an anxiety  disorder,  15.2%  (n=24)  had  major  depressive disorder,  10.8%  (n=17)  had  OCD,  2.5%  (n=4)  had  ADHD, 1.3%  (n=2)  had  PTSD,  1.3%  (n=2)  were  diagnosed  with eating  disorders,  1.3%  (n=2)  with  sleep  disorders,  0.6% (n=1) with somatic symptom disorder and 25.9% (n=41) had no diagnosis of mental disorder (Table 2).

Compared to the participants' illness duration, excluding healthy individuals, the median duration of illness of the group with misophonia was significantly higher than that of  the  group  without  misophonia  (p=0.004).  Compared to the presence of comorbid physical illness, the rate of physical illness diagnosis was significantly higher in the group with misophonia than in the group without (42.9% &amp; 30.4%, respectively, p=0.04). The frequency of a family history of mental disorder was significantly higher in the group with misophonia than in the group without (51.4% &amp; 31.8%, respectively, p=0.002). There was no significant difference  in  the  rates  of  suicide  attempts  between  the groups with and without misophonia.

When  the  diagnosis  of  comorbid  personality  disorder (PD) was evaluated, 85.7% of the group with misophonia had  no  PD  diagnosis.  4.8%(n=5)  had  OCPD,  3.8%  (n=4) had  borderline  PD,  3.8%  (n=4)  had  antisocial  PD,  1.9% (n=2)  had  narcissistic  BP .  Whereas  94.9%  of  the  group without misophonia had no PD diagnosis, 2.5% (n=4) had antisocial  PD,  1.3%  (n=2)  had  borderline  PD,  0.6%  (n=1) had  OCPD,  and  0.6%  (n=1)  had  narcissistic  PD.  Table  2 presents the comparison of the participants according to clinical variables.

When the participants with and without misophonia were compared in terms of BDI, BAI, BIS, and YBOCS scores, all mean scale scores of the group with misophonia were significantly  higher  than  the  group  without  misophonia except  for  the  YBOCS-total  and  obsession/compulsion scale scores (p&lt;0.05, for each). There was no significant difference between the groups regarding YBOCScompulsion/obsession and total scores. Scale scores of the  groups  with  and  without  misophonia  are  shown  in Table 3.

When  the  diagnostic  criteria  by  the  Sound  Disturbance Problems Form and MSL were evaluated, 60.1% (n=158) of  the  participants  did  not  have  any  misophonia.  21.3% (n=56) of the participants had disorder-level misophonia, and 18.6% (n=49) had symptom-level misophonia.

Among  the  participants  with  anxiety  disorder,  25.6% (n=31) had disorder-level misophonia, and 20.7% (n=25) had symptom-level misophonia. 9.8% (n=4) of the individuals  diagnosed  with  major  depressive  disorder had  disorder-level  misophonia,  and  31.7%  (n=13)  had symptom-level  misophonia.  27.6%  (n=8)  of  individuals diagnosed with OCD had disorder-level misophonia, and 13.8%  (n=4)  had  symptom-level  misophonia.  16%  (n=8) of healthy individuals were diagnosed with disorder-level misophonia, and 2% (n=1) with symptom-level misophonia. Due to insufficient sample size, significant data for ADHD, PTSD, eating disorders, sleep disorders, somatic symptom disorder, and tic disorder could not be obtained. According to the data, disorder, and symptom-level misophonia were mainly accompanied by the diagnosis of anxiety disorder. When  examined  separately,  symptom-level  misophonia is mainly seen in participants diagnosed with depressive disorder, while disorder-level misophonia is primarily seen in participants diagnosed with OCD.

According to the Yates statistic, there was a significant difference between the misophonia and diagnosis groups (p&lt;0.001). In individuals not diagnosed with misophonia, the difference was  between  healthy  individuals and individuals diagnosed  with  anxiety  disorder.  Also, in individuals with symptom-level misophonia, the difference was between healthy individuals and individuals diagnosed with anxiety disorder and between healthy individuals and individuals diagnosed with depressive disorder (Table 4).

When the correlations between the MSL total score and the BDI, BAI, BIS, and subscale scores were evaluated in participants  diagnosed  with  anxiety  disorder,  there  was a  moderate  positive  relationship  between  the  MSL  total score and BAI (p=0.001). In participants diagnosed with depressive  disorder,  there  was  no  correlation  between MSL total score and BDI, BAI, BIS, and subscale scores. In participants diagnosed with OCD, there was no correlation between  MSL  total  score  and  BDI,  BAI,  BIS,  subscale scores, and YBOCS and subscale scores. Table 5 presents the correlations between MSL total score and other scale scores  in  participants  diagnosed  with  anxiety  disorder, depressive disorder, and OCD.

## DISCUSSION

Misophonia is a condition of being disturbed by certain sounds  that  have  become  increasingly  important  in the  last  20  years.  One  of  the  reasons  for  its  becoming increasingly  important  is  that  it  is  not  rare  in  society, contrary to popular belief. For this reason, the number of studies on misophonia is increasing rapidly. Although it was initially considered a physical disorder, recent studies have increased evidence that it may be a mental disorder. Although  many  diagnostic  criteria  have  been  proposed for  misophonia, no clear decision has yet been reached on its classification and diagnostic criteria. In our study, most of the participants who had misophonia symptoms were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and as the total score  of  the  BAI  increased,  the  total  score  of  the  MSL also increased. Anxiety disorders and anxiety severity are related to misophonia, suggesting that misophonia could be classified as an anxiety disorder.

These  studies  have  shown  that  50-85%  of  the  family members also have misophonia symptoms (9,31-33). In our study, 39% of the individuals with misophonia reported that their families also had misophonia. The presence of misophonia in the  family  suggests  that  there  may  be  a genetic origin of misophonia or that this condition can be learned from the family by modeling this condition.

In  Schröder  et  al.'s  study  (11),  48%  of  42  misophonic participants  and  73.9%  of  69  misophonic  participants in Öz et al.'s (20) were women. In Erfanian et al.'s study (17),  57.7%  of  52  misophonic  participants,  whereas  in Vitoratou  et  al.'s  study  (29),  78.2%  of  613  misophonic participants  were  women.  Studies  also  have  revealed that  misophonia  is  more  common  in  women  and  that the gender distribution is equal (30). Our result that there was no relationship between misophonia and gender may be related to the fact that different disorder groups were evaluated together and the prevalence of mental disorders varies according to gender.

The  fact  that  the  current  psychiatric  disorder  duration was  longer in individuals with misophonia than in individuals  without  may  indicate  that  the  predisposition to misophonia  increases  as  the  psychiatric  disorder becomes chronic. There is no enough data in the literature on this issue. In contrast, more than half of the individuals without misophonia stated that they did not have a mental disorder  history  in  their  family.  More  than  half  of  the individuals with misophonia stated that they had a mental disorder history in their family. These data may indicate that those with a family history of mental disorders may be more prone to misophonia and that there is a relationship in terms of genetic predisposition. In the literature, studies suggest that misophonia may also have a genetic origin.

We  found  that  21.3%  of  the  participants  had  disorderlevel misophonia, and 18.6% had symptom-level misophonia. Jastreboff et al.  (34)  stated  that  3%  of  the general  population  might  have  misophonia.  Wu  et  al. (2) reported that 19.9% of the participants had clinically significant misophonia, and Zhou et al. (35) reported this rate as 6% in their study. This difference may be since the majority of the participants in our study had a psychiatric disorder,  and  this  psychiatric  disorder  might  lead  to  a predisposition to misophonia. Norris et al. identified two potential  subgroups  in  misophonia:  one  with  a  more "pure form" of misophonia, defined by severe misophonia symptoms but with few concurrent conditions, and one with  an  increasing  number  of  concurrent  conditions, which may represent misophonia as an epiphenomenon of  increased  risk  for  neuropsychiatric  conditions.  These data  suggest  that  misophonia  has  an  etiology  that  is multidimensionally complicated and related to a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders (36).

In our study, the levels of depression, anxiety, and impulsivity  were  higher  in  individuals  with  misophonia than  in  those  without  misophonia.  Similarly,  previous studies revealed that the severity of anxiety, depression, and impulsivity increased as the misophonia score increased (15,37). Our study is consistent with the data in  the  literature,  and  the  data  suggest  that  misophonia is  associated with psychiatric symptoms and should be considered a psychiatric disorder.

We found that individuals diagnosed with anxiety disorders and OCD had a higher prevalence of misophonia than healthy individuals. Individuals diagnosed with anxiety disorders and depressive disorder were diagnosed  with  more  symptom-level  misophonia  than healthy individuals. In individuals with anxiety disorders, the  symptom  level  and  the  disorder  level-misophonia were  higher  than  in  healthy  individuals.  These  results suggest that anxiety disorders and misophonia are more

closely  related  than  other  mental  disorders  and  should be  considered  in  diagnostic  classification.  In  a  study  in which  18  misophonic  patients  were  evaluated,  the  fact that  a  diagnosis  of  anxiety  disorder  accompanied  ten individuals  with  misophonia  supports  the  relationship between  anxiety  disorders  and  misophonia,  as  seen  in our  study  (38).  Especially  the  fact  that  anxiety  leads  to anger reaction in misophonia suggests the prominence of anxiety in misophonia (2,35,39).

We  found  a  significant  relationship  between  MSL  total score and anxiety severity in participants diagnosed with anxiety disorder. No significant relationship was between other  diagnoses  and  symptom  severity.  Studies  have shown  a  correlation  between  increased  anxiety  levels, misophonia  severity,  and  emotional  response  (40),  and there  has  been  a  strong  relationship  between  anxiety sensitivity  and  anxiety  disorders  (41).  Increased  anxiety sensitivity  also  increases  the  severity  of  misophonia symptoms (42).  It  can  be  interpreted  that  an  increased anxiety level causes the person to become more sensitive to  the  sounds  in  the  environment,  and  intolerance  to sounds increases.

In our study, 2.4% (n=6) of all participants and 4.8% (n=5) of the individuals with misophonia were diagnosed with OCPD. In other words, 83.3% of the individuals with OCPD have been diagnosed with misophonia. In a study by Jager et  al.  (14)  with  575  participants  diagnosed  with  misophonia, 26% had traits of OCPD. In Schröder et al.'s (11) study, 22 of  the  42  misophonic  participants  were  diagnosed  with OCPD. In a study investigating the relationship between misophonia and personality disorders, three misophonic individuals  were  also  diagnosed  with  OCPD  (43).  Jager et  al.  determined the rate of OCPD diagnosis to be only 2.4% but demonstrated that individuals with misophonia have  clinical  perfectionism  (14).  The  underlying  cause of  the  discomfort  or  intolerance  to  noise  may  be  that the  individual  with  OCPD  creates  one's  truths  due  to  a perfectionist  personality.  Perfectionism  is  a  personality trait  that  was  found  to  be  associated  with  misophonia (44). In line with the study by Jager et al. (14), our result of  low  rates  of  OCPD  diagnosis  compared  to  previous studies  suggests  that  perfectionism  in  individuals  with misophonia should not be evaluated only based on OCPD. According  to  our  results,  although  misophonia  is  not associated with the severity of obsessions-compulsions, it  is  associated  with  obsessive-compulsive  personality traits and  impulsivity.  Future  studies  in  which  more personality dimensions, especially perfectionism, are evaluated are needed to confirm the relationship between misophonia and personality traits.

Our  findings  support  the  notion  that  misophonia  is  not uncommon in psychiatric outpatient clinics, implying that clinicians should be more aware of misophonia. Previous research has revealed that misophonia reduces a patient's quality  of  life,  and  some  researchers  have  emphasized the importance of standardizing misophonia  criteria using  validated  scales  and  the  DSM-5  (45).  Assume that misophonia research expands; the information gathered  will  lead  to  misophonia  classification  and  the development  of  diagnostic  criteria.  Setting  diagnostic criteria  and  identifying  comorbid  mental  disorders  may aid  in  identifying,  treating,  and  improving  life  quality  in people suffering from misophonia.

The  strength of our study is that misophonia  was investigated  in  both  psychiatric  disorders  and  healthy individuals in a relatively large sample. Our research has some limitations. We used the diagnostic criteria proposed by  Oz  et  al.  (8,20)  as  misophonia  diagnostic  criteria. Although  many  diagnostic  criteria  have  been  proposed in  the  literature,  the  lack  of  a  standardized  diagnostic method  may  have  resulted  in  some  participants  being misdiagnosed or missed. The absence of a hearing test is the second limitation. Misophonia has been associated with diseases such as hyperacusis and tinnitus (1). In our study, we considered the statements of the participants and  relatives,  and  we  directly  included  the  participants with  these  diagnoses  in  the  group  without  misophonia. This may  have resulted in overlooking participants with  hyperacusis  or  tinnitus  who  also  had  misophonia. Although our study's sample was large, the low number of participants  with  diagnoses  such  as  tic  disorder, ADHD, PTSD, and eating disorders may have affected the results.  Researchers  have  suggested  that  misophoniarelated  symptoms  occur  in  populations  such  as  autism spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  (46).  Therefore,  not  evaluating ASD and similar neurodevelopmental disorders is the last limitation  of  our  study.  Future  studies  to  be  conducted with a large sample in which the types of anxiety disorders are  evaluated  separately  and  the  diagnoses  of  mental disorders are distributed balanced  would  clarify the relationship between misophonia and mental disorders.
