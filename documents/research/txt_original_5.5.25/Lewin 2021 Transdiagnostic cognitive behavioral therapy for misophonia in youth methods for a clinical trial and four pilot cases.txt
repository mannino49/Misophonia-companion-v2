Cognitive behavior therapy ABSTRACT  
Background: Misophonia is a condition marked by dysregulated emotions and behaviors in response to trigger 
sounds, often chewing, breathing, or coughing. Evidence suggests that misophonia develops in adolescence and 
the emotions and behaviors are a conditioned response to distress, resulting in social avoidance, stress, and 
family conflict. In addition, co-occurrence with other psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety, OCD, and Tourette 
syndrome is common. A transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapeutic (CBT) approach appears appropriate. 
There are currently no controlled studies of youth with misophonia. The current paper describes the approach to 
a pilot randomized, blinded family-based treatment study for youth ages 8-16 years. Preliminary results from a 
pilot open trial also are described. 
Methods: A 2-phase dual site telehealth treatment study using a transdiagnostic CBT approach, the Unified 
Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children and Adolescents (UP-C/A; 
Ehrenreich-May et al., 2018), is proposed. Phase 1 consisted of a 4-case pilot of UP-C/A. Phase 2 includes a 
randomized trial comparing the UP-C/A to a standard relaxation and education protocol. 
Results: Preliminary results from the pilot show modest improvements in evaluator-rated misophonia symptoms 
on the Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement scales . 
Limitations: There is little research to inform evidence-based practice for youth with misophonia. Study limita -
tions include lack of standardized misophonia assessment instruments and an absence of formal diagnostic 
criteria. 
Conclusions: The current paper describes proposed methods for the first randomized controlled trial for youth 
with misophonia and their families along with results from a 4-case pilot.   
1.Introduction 
Misophonia, from the Latin miso ‘hatred ’ and phonia ‘sound, ’ was 
first described by audiologists, Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2001) , to be a 
condition marked by a strong aversion to specific sounds and noises. 
Over the past decade, there have been increasing clinical reports and 
study of misophonia, but notably, there has been a lack of diagnostic 
classification in either DSM-5 or ICD-10. Merriam-Webster (n.d.) defines 
misophonia as: 
A condition in which one or more common sounds (such as the ticking of a clock, the hum of a fluorescent light, or the chewing or 
breathing of another person) cause an atypical emotional response (such 
as disgust, distress, panic, or anger) in the affected person hearing the 
sound. 
The scientific and clinical communities ’ descriptions of misophonia 
generally converge, characterizing the central nature of misophonia to 
be an emotional experience to sound triggers as opposed to abnormal 
sensory perception/pain. Abnormal hearing thresholds have not been 
reported in misophonia (Schroder et al., 2013 ). The sound ’s source is 
often highly specific and/or context dependent. For example, the

401expectation of a sound and/or observation of someone chewing through 
a sound-proof window can elicit similar levels of emotional reaction. 
Misophonia likely has less to do with the physical properties of partic -
ular trigger sounds (e.g., frequency, intensity) than with the context and 
historical emotional experiences associated with the sound (Jastreboff 
and Jastreboff, 2001 ). Therefore, misophonia is best defined as selective 
sensitivity to sound triggers accompanied by emotional distress, physi -
ological arousal, and possibly behavioral reactions (e.g., avoidance). 
1.1. Phenomenology 
Unfortunately, the literature lacks comprehensive characterizations 
of misophonia, and there is very little replication from the case studies 
and convenience samples that provide most of the extant descriptions, 
especially with regard to pediatric populations (Johnson et al., 2013 ). 
There are no validated biological models, and the etiology of misopho -
nia is unknown. From the first known clinical description, misophonia 
has been described as emotional reactivity and autonomic arousal in the 
context of trigger sounds (Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2001 ). Anger, irri-
tation, distress or disgust, and intense behavioral reactions (e.g., 
avoidance, tantrums, aggression), which are markedly disproportional 
to the intensity or duration of the stimuli, are commonly reported. 
Anxiety, stress, and panic also are not uncommon, but people typically 
do not report being fearful of the sound (Edelstein et al., 2013 ). Physi -
ological hyperarousal is also common (Schwartz et al., 2011 ). It is 
posited that misophonia develops via conditioning: sounds become 
associated with aversive emotions and physiological discomfort 
(Dozier, 2015 ; Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2014 ; Lewin et al., 2015 ). The 
social context, attribution, or interpretation (e.g., presumed intent) 
appear to influence the subjective response to the sensory trigger 
(Bruxner, 2016 ; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ). For 
example, individuals with misophonia may be able to replicate a sound 
(e.g., chewing) without experiencing the arousal or discomfort that 
occurs when hearing a sibling chew. While classical conditioning may 
explain development, operant learning mechanisms may serve to 
maintain misophonia-related distress and impairment. As individuals 
avoid contact with trigger sounds and experience immediate relief, they 
fail to learn to regulate negative emotions and come to rely upon escape 
or avoidance to manage distress (Hall et al., 2016 ; Jastreboff and Jas-
treboff, 2014 ). 
Notably, studies suggest hearing (sensitivity) threshold for in-
dividuals with misophonia is within normal limits, possibly indicating 
that the condition is not simply a result of a heightened acuity to sound. 
Impairment is commonly reported in misophonia, with symptoms 
affecting functioning in work, school, and family/social relationships. 
Initial studies suggest onset of symptoms in childhood to early teenage 
years (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ; Schroder et al., 2017 ), although more 
systematic study is needed to characterize onset and course. Similarly, 
there are few data regarding the incidence of misophonia. Assessing 
incidence is further complicated by lack of formal ICD/DSM-5 diag-
nostic criteria. It is generally agreed that the condition is not uncommon 
but underreported and often not assessed, even in the context of psy-
chiatric evaluation. A self-report survey of college students showed that 
20% of the sample indicated abnormal sensitivity to sound (Wu et al., 
2014 ). Notably, most of the sample identified symptom onset prior to 
adolescence (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ; Wu et al., 2014 ). Findings vary 
with regard to the presence of psychopathology in conjunction with 
misophonia. Approximately 50% of an internet sample of adults with 
misophonia reported at least one psychiatric disorder (N 301; Rouw 
and Erfanian, 2018 ). In the largest clinical sample to date, Jager et al. 
(2020) found that 22% of the sample met criteria for at least one psy-
chiatric disorder (major depression 6.8%; obsessive-compulsive disorder 
[OCD] 2.8%). Erfanian et al. (2019) found that posttraumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD; 15.4%), OCD (11.5%), major depression (9.6%) and 
anorexia nervosa (9.6%) were the most common co-occurring condi -
tions. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that this relationship may be bi-directional, especially in children and adolescents with OCD 
and tic spectrum disorders (Hazen et al., 2008 ; Lewin et al., 2015 ). 
Unfortunately, most phenomenological data on misophonia have been 
collected from adults in convenience samples. The paucity of studies 
investigating misophonia among children and adolescents limits our 
understanding of its prevalence and course. 
1.2. Treatment research 
Not surprisingly, there are no formal practice parameters for the 
treatment of misophonia. In fact, the misophonia treatment literature is 
devoid of clinical trials or any controlled studies. Thus, there is no 
formative guidance for treating individuals with misophonia aside from 
case studies and an open trial. Given the central nature of distress and 
emotional arousal combined with high associations with anxiety and 
depressive disorders, investigating psychological treatment options ap-
pears warranted. Notably, Spankovich and Hall (2014) discussed six 
potential directions for misophonia treatment. Two approaches were 
psychological (counseling and psychological/psychiatric therapy). Two 
other options for intervention (“misophonia retraining therapy ” and 
“positive association and desensitization ”) also fall within the scope of 
behavioral health and are centered around principles of operant and 
classical conditioning as well as selective attention and accept -
ance/mindfulness (e.g., pairing pleasant stimuli with unpleasant, 
selectively focusing attention on other stimuli). The fifth approach to 
treatment was a combination of autonomic calming tools such as 
relaxation and meditation in addition to healthy diet and exercise. 
Finally, the authors discussed the use of hearing protective devices (e.g., 
earmuffs, noise cancelling devices) to attenuate sounds. The use of 
hearing protective devices is not recommended because individuals with 
misophonia do not experience pain, but rather a strong emotional 
response to trigger sounds. Therefore, protective devices limit tolerance 
and emotional adjustment to the distress by reinforcing the belief that 
the sounds must be avoided. In sum, despite initial description in 
audiology circles, misophonia has many characteristics of a psychiatric 
disorder (Lewin et al., 2015 ; Lewin et al., 2015 ; Taylor, 2017 ) with key 
behavioral and emotional treatment targets. Intense negative affect in 
the context of sensory triggers, marked avoidance, deficit emotional 
regulation, poor flexibility, and potential cognitive processing biases are 
possible targets for intervention. 
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) appears to be the appropriate 
starting approach for developing and testing a psychotherapeutic 
intervention for misophonia. To date, the only relatively large trial (N 
90) found that 48% of adult subjects showed a significant reduction in 
misophonia across two measures (Much or Very Much Improved on the 
CGI-I and a 30% reduction in symptoms on the AMISO-S; Schroder et al., 
2017 ). Nine percent reached symptom remission and 58% showed 
improvement on the CGI-I only (Much or Very Much Improved on the 
CGI-I). The treatment focused on four domains: (1) attentional shifting 
away from certain stimuli (e.g., redirect focus of attention from a trigger 
sound); (2) counterconditioning to disrupt classically conditioned as-
sociations between neutral/positive stimuli that have become paired 
with negative emotional experiences; (3) stimulus manipulation exer-
cises (allowing the participant to manipulate the sounds to engender a 
sense of control); and (4) relaxation exercises to improve emotional 
control. The intervention was administered in groups for 7-8 sessions. 
Unfortunately, there is little information about the treatment of 
children and adolescents with misophonia despite the likely onset dur-
ing childhood (Mean age of misophonia onset 12.5 years; Schroder 
et al., 2017 ). Similarly, in a large online sample of 301 adults with 
misophonia (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ), 45% reported onset in child -
hood, 30% during adolescence, and 15% “as long as I can remember. ” 
Only 9% of those sampled reported that their symptoms began during 
adulthood. The overwhelming majority reported that their symptoms 
progressively worsened with age. Given (1) the majority of misophonia 
cases are reported to begin in childhood, (2) there is some evidence for A.B. Lewin et al.

Journal of Affective Disorders 291 (2021) 400–408
402worsening /continuation of symptoms if untreated, (3) the limited 
treatment research in children and adolescents with misophonia, and (4) 
a better probability of remission in younger patients (Ginsburg et al., 
2011 ), empirical examination of a CBT approach for misophonia in 
children and adolescents appears indicated. 
1.3. Current treatment approach 
For children and adolescents with misophonia, their emotional 
response to trigger sounds, and resulting behavioral problems and 
functional impairment, appear to be the primary targets for psychosocial 
intervention. Notably, many childhood cases occur in the context of 
other psychiatric disorders including OCD, Tourette, anxiety, mood, 
externalizing, and eating disorders. Accordingly, we needed to select a 
psychotherapeutic approach to be specific enough to target misophonia 
(distress, avoidance, tolerance, externalizing responses, etc.) but broad 
enough to address co-occurring internalizing and externalizing symp -
toms and related functional impairment. Rather than developing a “CBT 
for misophonia, ” which may have a complex and heterogeneous pre-
sentation, established transdiagnostic approaches targeting mechanisms 
associated with putative processes of misophonia and associated con-
ditions may provide a feasible solution. Transdiagnostic approaches are 
based on the assumption that emotional dysfunction is shaped by 
overlapping emotional and behavioral processes and shared risk factors. 
These transdiagnostic factors include poor emotional regulation ability 
and decreased ability to tolerate emotional (or physical) discomfort, 
often in the context of negative affective states. As a result of this poor 
tolerance of negative affective states, individuals engage in behaviors to 
suppress, escape, or avoid the situations eliciting such distress (e.g., 
avoidance, aggression, blame), which are negatively reinforced over 
time (Barlow et al., 2014 ). A number of transdiagnostic factors appear 
consistent with the emergence and maintenance of misophonia, 
including information processing biases (e.g., selective attention), 
increased negative arousal, poor emotional control, low tolerance of 
distress, heightened anxiety sensitivity, behavioral avoidance, and 
parenting behaviors that maintain maladaptive emotion regulation in 
children. The transdiagnostic targeting of distress intolerance, anxiety 
sensitivity, poor emotional regulation, and other factors may disrupt the 
maintenance of misophonia. 
Pilot CBT studies have investigated some of these transdiagnostic 
factors in adults. Schroder and colleagues (2017) used a CBT approach, 
which included elements of conditioning and extinction, relaxation, 
attentional control, and procedures to increase one’s locus of control 
over emotions/sensations. In a similar approach, Frank and McKay 
(2019) suggested that inhibitory learning within the context of exposure 
therapy might improve perceived control over emotional reactions, even 
in the absence of habituation to certain sounds. Mindfulness and 
acceptance-based strategies also have been suggested for inclusion in the 
treatment of misophonia (Schneider and Arch, 2017 ). Unlike models of 
exposure therapy with response prevention to fears/anxiety, it is not 
expected that individuals with misophonia would habituate to sounds. 
Rather, the target for therapy can better be conceptualized as the 
tolerance of distress in the context of sound triggers; exposure therapy 
may be useful for facilitating use of mindfulness, inhibitory learning, 
and similar approaches for emotional regulation. 
1.4. Unified protocol 
The Unified Protocols for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional 
Disorders in Children and Adolescents (UP-C/A) are manualized treat-
ments for emotional disorders among youth (Ehrenreich-May et al., 
2018). The UP-C/A utilize a transdiagnostic family-based approach to 
address underlying mechanisms implicated in the development and 
maintenance of anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and ado-
lescents via evidence-based cognitive-behavioral and “third wave ” 
behavioral treatment techniques, such as cognitive reappraisal, problem-solving, mindfulness, and opposite action strategies. The hy-
pothesized mechanisms of change in the UP-C/A are increased tolerance 
of distress when experiencing strong or intense emotional states. A 
secondary target is the reduction of (1) frequent negative affect re-
sponses to inert triggers, and (2) excessive avoidance behavior. The UP- 
C/A have been shown to help adolescents and children with emotional 
disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression) in multiple baseline, open trial, and 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) across intervention and prevention 
contexts (Ehrenreich et al., 2009 ; Ehrenreich-May et al., 2017 ; Kennedy 
et al., 2019 ; Kennedy et al., 2018 , Hawks et al., 2020 ). The UP-C/A 
appear ideally suited for patients with misophonia because of the 
strong evidence suggesting the protocols can improve the characterized 
emotional and autonomic arousal targets (Sherman and Ehrenreich- -
May, 2020 ). The UP-C/A were developed to address core dysfunctions 
(e.g., heightened negative affect, poor tolerance of emotions, and 
experiential avoidance) associated with a range of emotional or inter-
nalizing disorders, including anxiety, depression, and related condi -
tions. The UP-C/A include modules on motivation, mindful awareness, 
flexible thinking, problem-solving, and opposite actions, including a 
range of exposure and activation techniques. The protocols have a 
companion caregiver-focused component to enhance adaptive parenting 
behaviors that may be engaged when a caregiver encounters child 
distress. The UP-C/A do not impose a rigid course of treatment, but 
rather, allow the clinician to personalize treatment components to the 
highest priority challenges using a core set of evidence-based strategies 
and assessment tools (e.g., Top Problems; Weisz et al., 2011 ). In 
particular, tools to improve emotional awareness, increase flexibility of 
cognitive appraisals, improve tolerance of physical/sensory sensations, 
and decrease emotional and situational avoidance are strongly consis -
tent with models for treating misophonia-related distress and impair -
ment (Frank and McKay, 2019 ; Hall et al., 2016 ). 
1.5. Aims and hypotheses 
In order to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 
transdiagnostic approach to the behavioral treatment of misophonia 
among children and adolescents, a 2-phase study was designed using the 
UP-C/A. In Phase 1 (completed), our aim was to conduct a pilot open 
trial (N 4) for procedural refinement followed by a small-scale ran-
domized controlled trial (RCT; N 44) in Phase 2 (ongoing). The RCT 
will compare the transdiagnostic approach using the UP-C/A to psy-
chotherapy focused on misophonia education and emotional/physio -
logical relaxation (RE). We hypothesize that, relative to the relaxation- 
focused approach, reduction in misophonia and overall psychiatric 
severity (at post-treatment) will be greater for children and adolescents 
receiving the UP-C/A. We also expect higher rates of treatment re-
sponders in the UP-C/A condition. The current paper outlines proced -
ures for the RCT (Phase 2) and preliminary results from the pilot (Phase 
1). 
2.Methods 
2.1. Procedures 
All study participants will receive 10 treatment sessions and partic -
ipate in 3 assessments. The assessments will occur at baseline (prior to 
session 1), mid-treatment (after session 5), and post-treatment (after 
session 10). Assessments will be conducted by independent evaluators 
(IE) who will be blinded to treatment condition (see Fig. 1 for a list of 
assessments). Participants who meet initial phone screen requirements 
will attend a screening visit that includes informed parent consent, child 
assent, and a comprehensive diagnostic assessment of inclusion/exclu -
sion criteria. A.B. Lewin et al.

Journal of Affective Disorders 291 (2021) 400–408
4032.2. Telehealth/electronic data capture 
All study procedures will be conducted via telehealth. Although this 
change was implemented mid-way through Phase 1 due to the 2019 
SARS-CoV-2, the adjustment during the pilot phase allowed for full 
conversion prior to the Phase 2 RCT and increased our catchment area, 
allowing for recruitment state-wide. Encrypted HIPAA-compliant tele-
health platforms will be used and will allow for the recording of visits for 
integrity purposes. All assessments will be completed by participants 
using a HIPAA-compliant web-based interface. 
2.3. Treatment sites 
Recruitment for this study will occur across two sites: the University 
of South Florida Rothman Center for Pediatric Neuropsychiatry (USF) 
and the University of Miami (UM). The purpose of two sites is to both (1) 
increase recruitment for children and adolescents with misophonia and 
(2) use the combined expertise of the respective teams. The last author 
(co-PI) from UM and first author (overall PI) at the USF have led pilot 
research studies in assessment/treatment of misophonia. Participants 
will be recruited through normal clinic flow as well as through advertisements with local audiologists, pediatricians, mental health 
professionals, and misophonia-specific patient/support organizations. 
All study procedures have been approved by the IRB at both study sites. 
The study is registered as a clinical trial (NCT04365543). 
2.4. Inclusion/exclusion 
Children and adolescents (ages 8-17 years) and their families who 
meet the following inclusion criteria will be able to participate in the 
study: (1) baseline misophonia symptom severity score ≽3 (mildly ill) 
on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale (CGI-S, see below) and/ 
or baseline misophonia clinician severity rating (CSR) ≽4 (moderate) 
on the Misophonia Assessment Interview (MAI, see below), (2) miso-
phonia identified as a primary problem for treatment relative to other 
top problems, (3) live with their family/guardian(s), (4) have not 
received previous UP-C/A or misophonia treatment at either site, (5) if 
on psychotropic medication, have been on a stable dose for the prior four 
weeks (two weeks for stimulant), (6) have the ability to complete as-
sessments and participate in treatment using English without a trans -
lator for both parent and child participants, and (7) have no current 
diagnosis of psychosis, bipolar disorder, intellectual disability, acute

404suicidality, alcohol/substance dependence, or eating disorder due to 
risk/safety. Children and adolescents with comorbidities will be 
included, but misophonia must be identified as one of the primary 
problems. Inclusion is purposefully broad given (1) this is among the 
first controlled studies of misophonia among children and adolescents, 
(2) we expect diagnostic heterogeneity, and (3) the UP-C/A are trans -
diagnostic and equipped to treat broadly presenting symptoms. Family 
participation is required. 
3.Assessment 
3.1. Assessment of misophonia and other disorders 
The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5: Parent and 
Child Versions (ADIS-5-C/P) is a semi-structured interview that will be 
used to assess for various disorders in children and adolescents (Silver -
man & Albano, in preparation). IEs will assign a clinician severity rating 
(CSR) on a scale from 0 (absent) to 8 (very severe) for each disorder. By 
convention, a CSR ≽4 is considered to represent diagnostic threshold. 
Since the ADIS-5 does not include a misophonia module, the Misophonia 
Assessment Interview (MAI) was developed by the principal investigator 
for this study and was designed to emulate an ADIS-5 module. Infor-
mation about specific misophonia triggers, emotional responses to 
sound, behavioral responses, avoidance, insight/awareness, functional 
impairment domains, and timeframe will be collected using the inter-
view. The IE will assign a CSR rating for misophonia, which is consistent 
with ADIS-5 procedures. 
Primary Outcome Measures. The Clinical Global Impression 
Severity and Improvement Scales (CGI-S/I; Guy, 1976 ) and the Child ’s 
Global Assessment Scale (CGAS; (Shaffer, 1983 ) will be the primary 
outcome measures. The CGI-I is a 7-point rating that establishes treat-
ment response from “very much improved ” to “very much worse. ” 
Responder status will be defined as a CGI-I rating of “much improved ” or 
“very much improved. ” The CGI-S is a 7-point rating that establishes 
severity of illness from “not at all ill” to “extremely ill.” Misophonia 
remission status will be provisionally defined as (1) “borderline ” or “no 
illness ” on the CGI-I and (2) sub-diagnostic threshold on the CSR at 
post-treatment (Kelly and Mezuk, 2017). The CGI-S/I will be collected 
for both misophonia and overall presentation. The CGAS will be used to 
rate general functioning and impairment independent of diagnoses. 
Secondary Outcome Measures. See Fig. 1 and Table 1 for all 
measure descriptions and assessment timeline. Therapists in both con-
ditions will establish top problems during the first session and obtain 
ratings with parent and child at each session thereafter. Top problems 
will be rated subjectively on a scale from 0 (not at all a problem) to 8 
(very much a problem). Therapists will monitor participants ’ response 
to treatment using the top problem ratings according to the procedures 
outlined by Weisz et al., (2011) . Notably, assessment of misophonia is 
not well-established. As such, many of the proposed outcome measures 
have significant psychometric limitations. Therefore, secondary 
outcome measures will include broadband and narrowband scales 
completed by the parent and youth. Ratings of misophonia are supple -
mented by well-established measures of comorbid conditions and 
broad-based assessments. Given both the transdiagnostic nature of the 
UP-C/A and the typically heterogenous clinical presentation of miso-
phonia, we decided to examine outcomes in multiple ways. We will 
determine the clinical severity and improvement using the CGI-S/I. We 
will use the ADIS-5/MAI to examine diagnostic improvements. Broad 
and narrow symptom measures (e.g., BASC-3, RCADS, MAQ, AMISO-S) 
and measures of putative transdiagnostic processes (e.g., distress toler-
ance) will be used to determine global improvements in emotion regu-
lation. Finally, parent and child top problems will be collected weekly to 
examine functional changes. This comprehensive approach is aimed at 
(1) examining group differences in misophonia treatment and (2) better 
understanding characterization of symptom and functional changes in 
youth with a complex, under-researched condition. Table 1

405Pilot (Phase 1) Outcome Measures. The current paper describes 
preliminary outcomes from the Phase 1 pilot trial. Specific measures of 
interest in Phase 1 reported here included CGI-S/I Overall and Miso-
phonia (primary outcome measure), CSR Misophonia, Misophonia 
Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ; Johnson, 2013 ), Amsterdam Miso-
phonia Scale (AMISO-S; Schroder et. al, 2013 ), Revised Children ’s 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS; Chorpita et al., 2000 ), Distress 
Tolerance Questionnaire (DTS; Simons and Gaher, 2005), and a 
semi-structured feasibility and acceptability exit interview. MAQ scores 
were interpreted as raw scores and were categorized as subclinical 
(0-11), mild (12-24), moderate (25-37), severe (38-50), and extreme 
(51-63). AMISO-S scores were interpreted as raw scores and were 
categorized as subclinical (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), severe 
(15-19), and extreme (20-24). The RCADS was interpreted using 
T-scores with a clinical cutoff of 65 or greater. Finally, DTS was inter-
preted using the total raw score where higher scores indicated greater 
tolerance to distress. 
3.2. Planned analysis 
Phase 1 analyses included descriptive statistics focused primarily on 
the feasibility and acceptability of the treatment approach (see below for 
results and discussion). In Phase 2, comparisons between groups in terms of primary and 
secondary outcomes (see Table 1) will be evaluated with mixed-effects 
repeated measures models. Models will include a random intercept 
and slope, and fixed effects for site (if significant), treatment group, visit, 
and treatment group-by-visit interaction. Effect sizes estimates (i.e., 
Cohen ’s d) will be derived from covariate-adjusted estimated marginal 
means and standard errors. The proposed sample size of provides 
adequate power to detect an effect size of f .20 for the interaction 
between group and time, which Cohen (1988) characterizes as a small to 
medium effect. 
3.3. Rater and therapist training and supervision 
Study therapists will be supervised postdoctoral fellows or advanced 
doctoral students with significant experience in misophonia and/or the 
care of children/adolescents with emotional disorders. Therapists for 
the UP-C/A will complete a 2-day training with the last author; a parallel 
training will be conducted with RE therapists. Both conditions will have 
weekly calls for supervision (by separate supervisors) and treatment 
fidelity following treatment initiation. Sessions will be recorded in Phase 
2, and 10% of recordings will be reviewed for fidelity to the intervention 
using adapted versions of established UP-C/A fidelity and competence 
coding procedures. Therapists trained in the UP-C/A will not administer 
the RE intervention in order to prevent overlap between the two con-
ditions. IEs will (1) undergo comparable training, weekly monitoring, 
and fidelity checks, (2) score sample cases to demonstrate reliability, 
and (3) attend weekly cross-site calls to ensure accurate ratings under 
supervision of the first author. All assessments will be video recorded, 
and 20% of interviews per year will be blindly reviewed to assess 
interrater reliability. 
3.4. Treatment conditions 
The UP-C/A and RE treatment protocols will include 10, 1-hour 
sessions. All participants in Phase 1 received the UP-C/A. Participants 
in Phase 2 (N 48) will be randomized to the UP-C/A (two-thirds) or the 
RE (one-third) condition (see Figure 1). The treatment protocols will 
vary in approach to treatment of misophonia, and there will be few 
shared features across protocols. Some common elements will include 
weekly parent/child top problem ratings to monitor change over time, 
misophonia psychoeducation, and mindfulness skills. However, the 
introduction of mindfulness will occur at significantly different time 
points in treatment (session 3 for UP-C/A compared to session 8 for RE). 
Both protocols are family-based and will include parent participation in 
every session. These common elements are consistent with a basic CBT 
session structure for treatment of emotional disorders. Importantly, 
these similarities in structure will ensure RE is a rigorous control to the 
UP-C/A. 
3.5. The unified protocols for transdiagnostic treatment of emotional 
disorders in children and adolescents (UP-C/A) 
Progression through treatment will include (1) learning about the 
emotional and behavioral underpinnings of emotions and misophonia; 
identifying top problems and common triggers for the child/adolescent; 
(2) learning the relationship between sound triggers and automatic 
thoughts, feelings, and adaptive or maladaptive behaviors while also 
practicing “opposite action ” to the emotional behavior that occurs 
following a sound trigger; (3) learning appropriate opposite action 
strategies such as present moment awareness, non-judgmental aware -
ness, and awareness of physical sensations using interoceptive exposure 
with body scans; (4) identifying thinking traps and employing detective 
thinking and problem-solving in response to automatic negative 
thoughts and difficult problems; (5) developing an emotion ladder for 
trigger sounds; (6) exposure to trigger sounds while practicing response 
prevention; and (7) reviewing the treatment and planning for the future. Table 1 (continued )

406A significant goal for treatment of misophonia with the UP-C/A will be 
to improve distress tolerance. Children and adolescents with misophonia 
present with heightened sensitivity to sound triggers and low tolerance 
to discomfort, especially emotional distress. Thus, exposure will be used 
as a mechanism to practice distress tolerance within an inhibitory 
learning framework. Among the goals will be for the child to better 
tolerate emotional distress (to misophonic and other triggers) through 
practice with the therapist and at home through home learning assign -
ments. More detail about the UP-C/A can be found in published manuals 
(Ehrenreich et al., 2009) and the procedural adaptation for misophonia 
is provided in the context of a case paper from one of our pilot partici -
pants (Tonarely et al., 2021). 
3.6. Relaxation and education (RE) 
We are using an active comparison condition in the randomized 
phase of the study. A relaxation-based treatment was chosen because (1) 
high rates of distress and anxiety are reported among youth with 
misophonia, (2) there is skepticism about the appropriateness of 
exposure-based treatments within the misophonia patient community, 
(3) the chosen protocol was feasible in previous clinical trials, and (4) 
relaxation-based treatments are often the cornerstone of anxiety treat-
ments outside of specialty exposure/response prevention practice. The 
specific relaxation protocol chosen for this study was modified for a 10- 
week format from the manual used by Piacentini et al. (2011). This 
protocol has demonstrated a 35% response rate in comparison 
family-based exposure therapy (Piacentini et al., 2011). Progression 
through treatment will include (1) learning about misophonia and how 
to monitor it using a subjective units of distress scale; (2) rewarding the 
child/adolescent’s use of relaxation strategies taught during treatment; 
(3) practicing a variety of relaxation strategies, including diaphragmatic 
breathing, progressive muscle relaxation with combined muscle groups, 
guided imagery, combined progressive muscle relaxation with guided 
imagery, and mindfulness (body scanning, mindful eating, using the five 
senses); and (4) reviewing the treatment and planning for the future. 
This condition will not include exposure with response prevention 
strategies. 
3.7. Results from a pilot implementation 
Phase 1 (completed) consisted of four pilot cases for the modified UP- 
C/A in order to test the feasibility of the 10-week protocol, assessment/ 
measurement, and supervision procedures. Families also provided their 
input about the acceptability of the intervention. Mean age of pilot 
participants was 15.5 years and 75% of participants were female. 
Table 2 reflects the CGI-S/I scores at baseline and post-treatment for 
each participant’s misophonia symptoms and overall distress. All four 
youth and their families completed the treatment with improved CGI-S/I 
scores (75% of participants were rated as “much improved” on the CGI-I 
Misophonia, which is considered a treatment responder). Table 3 re-
flects the CSR misophonia ratings at baseline and post-treatment. Three 
out of four participants were rated as improved by 1-2 points at post- 
treatment. Notably, the second participant ended treatment after ses-
sion seven. Consequently, 2-3 fewer sessions of exposure were included, which might explain the less robust response (Misophonia CGI: mini-
mally improved; Overall CGI: much improved; CSR: no change). 
All participants completed the Misophonia Assessment Question -
naire (MAQ) and the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (AMISO-S) at base-
line and post-intervention. Table 4 shows the MAQ and AMISO-S raw 
scores from baseline to post-intervention for each participant. Three out 
of four participants rated improvement at post-intervention on the MAQ. 
Baseline scores ranged from 12 (mild) to 54 (extreme), while post- 
treatment scores ranged from 3 (subclinical) to 25 (moderate). One 
participant (UM 2) reported worsening symptoms on the MAQ, but not 
on the AMISO-S. All participants rated improvement at post-treatment 
on the AMISO-S. Baseline scores ranged from 9 (mild) to 17 (severe), 
while post-treatment scores ranged from 6 (mild) to 12 (moderate). 
The Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) Total 
Anxiety and Depression subscale and Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS) 
Total score were collected for most participants at baseline and post- 
treatment in addition to the above noted misophonia-specific ques-
tionnaires. Table 4 shows the RCADS T-scores and DTS raw scores from 
baseline to post-treatment for each participant. These were collected to 
measure global improvements in distress tolerance, anxiety, and 
depression given the comorbidities associated with misophonia. All 
participants’ total DTS scores increased somewhat at post-treatment, 
indicating improved tolerance to distress. DTS scores ranged from 31 
to 73 at baseline and 38 to 75 at post-treatment. In addition, all par-
ticipants’ Total Anxiety and Depression T-scores on the RCADS 
improved from baseline to post-treatment. T-scores ranged from 39 to 54 
at baseline and 26 to 44 at post-treatment. Notably, no participants rated 
themselves in the clinically significant range on the RCADS Total Anx-
iety and Depression subscale at baseline. USF 1 did not complete enough 
items on the RCADS at baseline to generate a T-score. 
Families provided universally positive feedback in a brief follow-up 
call with the study coordinator. More specifically, all participants pro-
vided the highest acceptability ratings (i.e., 4/4) when asked to report 
about the quality of the UP-C/A, whether they received the kind of 
service they wanted, whether the UP-C/A helped them deal with their 
problems more effectively, and whether the UP-C/A met their needs. In 
addition, all participants indicated they would definitely recommend 
the study to a friend with a similar condition. All participants rated their 
quality of service as excellent. Minor modifications such as greater 
homework specificity were noted by participants. Although not sur-
prising, participants reported they disliked exposure, but they under -
stood its utility and purpose.

4074.Discussion 
Misophonia is a condition that typically develops in adolescence and 
is marked by autonomic arousal, emotion dysregulation (e.g., anxiety, 
anger, irritability, rage), and distress intolerance in response to trigger 
sounds. Misophonia is thought to develop through a process of classical 
and operant conditioning wherein sounds are associated with distress 
and maladaptive behaviors are reinforced with escape. Further, miso-
phonia often develops alongside other psychiatric disorders such as 
OCD, anxiety, and Tourette syndrome. Thus, transdiagnostic, family- 
based CBT treatments that emphasize exposure and distress tolerance 
are a logical approach to treatment, particularly given that habituation 
to sounds per se is not an appropriate goal. 
4.1. Contributions 
The current study is among the first studies of treatment of miso-
phonia in youth and is the first proposed RCT to compare treatment 
approaches. The UP-C/A is an established transdiagnostic family-based 
treatment for emotional disorders that emphasizes distress tolerance 
through opposite action using mindful approaches and exposure tech-
niques. Some argue that exposure therapy is inappropriate for miso-
phonia because habituation to sounds is unlikely. However, exposure 
may in fact be a powerful agent of change for individuals with miso-
phonia who have underdeveloped distress tolerance. Exposure is a 
process by which individuals learn how to withstand distress and 
disconfirm prior beliefs about their ability to approach strong emotions. 
Exposure therapy in this study is used as a tool to enhance distress 
tolerance, not as a mechanism to decrease arousal via repetitive en-
counters with a trigger stimulus. By contrast, relaxation also may be an 
effective treatment component for individuals with misophonia. Dif-
ferences in these potential active ingredients will be explored further 
through this RCT. Preliminary results suggest that individuals can 
tolerate distress associated with trigger sounds. 
4.2. Limitations 
There are some notable limitations with regard to the current RCT. 
Extant literature does not provide direction for screening and diagnosis 
of misophonia. As such, the inclusion criteria for the study are broad, 
and the presentation and severity of misophonia among participants is 
variable. Our diagnostic and assessment procedure had to be developed 
for this study. Further, improvement in symptoms is difficult to oper-
ationalize given the lack of formal assessment procedures. We provi -
sionally defined remission in symptoms in a manner consistent with 
trials for childhood OCD, anxiety, and mood disorders. However, it is 
unclear if we can expect symptom remission for misophonia in a manner 
similar to internalizing neuropsychiatric conditions.
