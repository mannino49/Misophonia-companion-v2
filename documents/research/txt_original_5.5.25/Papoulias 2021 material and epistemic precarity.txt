The conditions under which people labour in mental health research affect how and what knowledge is produced -and who benefits or doesn t from involvement in health research systems. There has been, however, little ' sustained investigation of the uneven modalities of labour exploitation across what are increasingly financialised systems of mental health research. This theoretical paper advances conceptual and empirical investigations of labour in health research -outlining how material precarity and epistemic precarity often go hand in hand, and largely drawing on examples from the UK. The intertwining of labour relations and epistemic cultures can be understood by bringing together insights from two bodies of knowledge not commonly in contact with one another -survivor/service user research and critical research on universities and academic labour. The article addresses how mental health research makes significant use of the labour of (i) contract researchers (many of whom  work  on  precarious  and  exploitative  contracts);  (ii)  lay  contributors  (through  'patient  and  public involvement ); and (iii) research participants (where the conditions underpinning participation in various kinds ' of research increasingly blur the distinction between volunteering, and 'gig ' work). Labour relations affect, and are affected by, efforts to change epistemic cultures and reduce epistemic inequalities, and epistemic and material precarity make efforts to improve research culture much more difficult. Those experiencing both material and epistemic precarity in health research systems need to be at the heart of efforts to combat both.

## 1. Introduction

Research culture -the 'behaviours, values, expectations, attitudes and norms of our research communities ' (Royal Society, n.d.) -needs improving. A multitude of research institutions, professional societies, funders (e.g. Wellcome Trust and Shift Learning, 2020) and researchers agree. The current focus on research culture betokens a broad concern with a range of problems, inequities, and exclusions in how research is being done, who is doing it, and how it is rewarded. There are ongoing efforts to shift scientific incentives in publishing and promotion practices, to extend 'open science ' and data-sharing, to improve equality and diversity initiatives, to better address research misconduct, bullying and harassment, to improve job security, and to be more inclusive of lay and community-produced  expertise  (Metcalfe  et  al.,  2020;  Tembo  et  al., 2021). In this paper we consider mental health research specifically in order to trace a different pathway through debates commonly conducted under the aegis of research culture. Rather than focusing on the full scope  of  issues  addressed  under  this  umbrella  term,  we  turn  to  two bodies of counter-knowledge that, we argue, provide frameworks for understanding  how  epistemic  and  material  precarity  make  efforts  to improve  research  culture  much  more  difficult.  One  body -survivor research,  where  researchers produce  knowledge about mental health and mental health services by drawing epistemologically from their own experience  of  psychiatric  services,  mental  distress  and  associated activism (e.g. Russo and Sweeney, 2016; Sweeney et al., 2009) -originated out of engagements with mental health research and services. The other -critical research on the university that foregrounds labour relations  (e.g.  Carpenter  et  al.,  2021) -addresses  the  university  in  its entirety not only as a site of knowledge production but as a workplace.

Both  bodies  of  literature  identify  much  that  is  problematic  and harmful concerning the production of research. They are joined here by disciplines such as feminist science and technology studies and Black studies which have also opened up new imaginaries to envisage more just means  of  producing  knowledge  and  to  rethink  scientificity

(McKittrick, 2021). Survivor research and critical research on the university tend to analyse the landscape of research differently from one another, and offer distinct routes through which to effect change. We investigate what is at stake in these differing analyses and argue that their insights be brought more closely together. There is an urgent need to better document and address how labour relations affect epistemic cultures, and vice versa (Simbürger, 2014). The conditions under which people labour in health research, and the subjectivities they enact while doing  so,  shape  the  styles  of  thought  governing  disciplines  (undercommoning, 2016); are entangled with the methods and infrastructures that  make  up  research  ecologies;  produce  barriers  to  certain  actors ' participation in the production of knowledge (Crook, 2020); determine who is able to contribute knowledge deemed to be scientific (Pereira, 2019); and bear on how data are collected and analysed, papers published,  and  determinations  made  about  authorship  (Lariviere  et  al., ` 2016). Our interest lies specifically in understanding how conditions of precarity -of vulnerability, insecurity and contingency -operate both materially and epistemically, with one tending to reinforce the other. Addressing the conjoint production of material and epistemic precarity must, we argue, be central to any initiative to improve research culture.

We focus largely on mental health research in the UK -where we have both worked and in which we publish, one of us as a user/survivor and contract researcher. UK mental health research comprises a complex infrastructural ecology devoted to research on the causes of mental ill health, the promotion of mental health, and interventions to address mental health. In recent years, governments have encouraged mental health researchers to develop shared, large databases and international research networks; to include people with mental health problems in the conduct of research; and to intensify academic-industrial collaboration (Department of Health, 2017). There is still much to investigate on how recent transformations in UK mental health research are reshaping scientific knowledge production (Atkinson et al., 2019). While some work on the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), founded in England in 2006, suggests that its funding allocations have contributed to the flexibilisation of the research nurse workforce (Caffrey et al., 2019; Shaw and Greenhalgh, 2008; Walshe and Davies, 2013), there are few systematic explorations of how policy initiatives and major funders in UK health research (such as UK Research and Innovation and The Wellcome Trust) have helped institutionalise particular forms of labour relations in research-active institutions (Faulkner-Gurstein et al., 2019). We hope this paper encourages further empirical and conceptual investigations of labour in mental health research -and health research more broadly -in the UK and elsewhere.

Mental health research is an exemplary site in which to explore the entwinement of material and epistemic precarity. First, while survivor research is a key site of epistemological and methodological innovation in mental health research, survivor researchers are, as we go on to detail, repeatedly subject to both epistemic marginalization and material precarity.  Second,  mental  health  research  (particularly  as  regards  translational  research  that  attempts  to  bridge  the  gap  between  so-called 'bench and bedside ) is increasingly reliant on collaborations with in-' dustry (pharmaceutical, biotechnological, bioinformatic) and with other actors (including voluntary organisations and charities), which opens further  routes  for  the  transformation  of  labour  relations  in  research. Given the diverse and often incommensurable ontologies of mental ill health and psychopathology held by research psychiatrists, psychologists and survivors, amongst others (Moncrieff et al., 2005), such collaborations  can  also  pose  profound  epistemological  challenges.  Such challenges are compounded in global mental health, a field predominantly  institutionalised  in  the  Global  North  but  effecting  changes  in mental health practices in the Global South, with many arguing that it is a  'neo-colonial  project ' (Davar,  2014).  Mental  health  research,  then, contains profound contractual, epistemological, and political heterogeneities, where epistemological authority, as well as epistemic delegitimization, are entangled in racialised and gendered labour relations.

In the next two sections, we explore how, firstly, survivor research and, secondly, critical research on the university have addressed power, labour, and knowledge production. We then consider how these two bodies of literature might productively be brought together.

## 2. Survivor analyses of mental health research

Mental  health  survivor  research  is  a  distinctly  political  form  of service-user-led  (patient-led)  research,  with  a  history  stretching  back across several decades (Campbell, 2005; Kalathil and Jones, 2017). It is a form of emancipatory research, rooted in the activism of mental health service users and prioritising experiential knowledge as an instrument of research. The term survivor itself signals the connection to activism, invoking both mental distress and a potentially traumatising or harmful encounter  with  psychiatric  services  (for  example  electro-convulsive therapy or involuntary detention). In the UK, survivor research, while initially  stemming  from  unpaid  activist  work  and  small-scale  funded projects in the third sector, now also takes place in universities, where a small number of survivor researchers are integrated within the mental health research workforce. This partial integration relates to the broader policy emphasis towards patient and public involvement (PPI) in health research, initiated by the New Labour governments in the UK, and based on the professed inclusion of service users as well as underserved communities in the design and execution of health research. It has been argued  that  PPI  may  improve  the  quality  relevance  and  implementability  of  research,  contribute  to  the  democratisation  of  science  and benefit  the  patients  and  public  involved  (Brett  et  al.,  2014).  Consequently, many UK funders currently expect evidence of active PPI in funding  applications.  However,  both  survivor  researchers  and  others have suggested that the current operationalisation of PPI represents a technocratic  and  managerialist  intervention  with  little  connection  to emancipatory or democratising imperatives (Madden and Speed, 2017) and have argued that PPI as typically practiced allocates at best a peripheral role to service users and may serve to legitimise rather than challenge  existing  research  agendas  (Papoulias  and  Callard,  2021). Furthermore, PPI initiatives have little power to redefine the parameters of what remains in effect an exclusionary research apparatus (Rose and Kalathil, 2019): while funding applicants need to include detailed plans for involvement, disabled people s and user-led organisations continue ' to be marginalised from criteria defining funding calls and in the distribution of grant funding (Sweeney, 2016). Furthermore, even when employed  as  salaried  researchers,  survivor  researchers  frequently experience poor career progression and difficulties acquiring long-term contractual employment (Callard and Rose, 2012). Some survivor researchers have argued that only a recognition of survivor-led research as a distinct discipline would untether survivors from working within the confines of biomedical psychiatry (Faulkner, 2017). Such recognition would entail forging or renewing situated solidarities between salaried survivor  researchers  and  grassroots  activists  (Russo  and  von  Peter, 2022); setting up proactive recruitment, support and mentoring systems and adapting working practices in order to counter academic ableism (Jones et al., 2021); and establishing funding calls specifically tailored to survivor research (Sweeney, 2016).

That survivor research maintains a keen focus on epistemic (in)justice  (Fricker,  2011;  Soklaridis  et  al.,  2020)  cannot  be  understood without acknowledging the dynamic between clinician and patient in mental  health  services  and  treatments.  The  psychiatric  patient  is perpetually caught in the crosshairs of coercive or involuntary treatment. While the potential delegitimization of knowledge from experience is present in any patient role -in that patients are frequently not regarded as necessarily capable of accurately understanding or translating 'experience ' in ways legible to 'mainstream ' research epistemologies (Hutchison et al., 2017) -it  is  baked into the definition of the psychiatric  patient,  in  so  far  as  the  latter  is  in  part  defined  through 'distortions ' of experience (such as fluctuating capacity, or phenomena that sit under the umbrella term psychosis). Survivor researchers (Costa et al., 2012) argue that this clinician/patient dynamic is reproduced in

S.(C. Papoulias and F. Callard the relationship between researchers and research participants (where participants ' data may be extracted, and their experience appropriated without recognition, or misrepresented), as well as in how survivor researchers are positioned in the university (where they struggle to be legitimised  within  the  research  machine;  where  their  practices  are repeatedly  positioned  as  less  epistemologically  and  methodologically robust; and where they are often marginalised within a heavily hierarchical  research  landscape  (Jones  and  Brown,  2012)).  This  epistemic precarity affects knowledge production in mental health research -for example through the many survivor research bids that end up not being funded,  or  through  the  difficulties  of  ensuring  that  survivors  are involved in the interpretation and data analysis stages of research (since their  inclusion can generate different ways of explaining phenomena (Sweeney et al., 2013)).

increasingly  precarious  contractual  conditions  and  intensification  of workplace  productivity  expectations  (Dados,  2020)  run  alongside intensifying regimes of audit, performance management, and ranking (Strathern, 2000).

The  clarity  with  which  survivor  analyses  have  demonstrated  the unequal dynamic between clinical and survivor researcher comes, we argue, at a price: that of deprioritizing attention to the complex labour relations which constitute health services and health research systems (for  some  notable  exceptions  see  MacKinnon  et  al.,  2021;  Voronka, 2017). Survivor accounts often conjure the terrain of university-based research  as  a  relatively  homogeneous  'body .  There  are  frequent  in-' vocations of the 'conventional , 'traditional ' ' or 'mainstream ' research roles  (e.g.  Russo,  2012;  Sweeney  and  Morgan,  2009) -generic  roles counterposed  to  the  survivor  researcher  by  virtue  of  their professionalisation within a broadly positivist health research paradigm. The university, meanwhile, is frequently described as an ivory tower (e. g.  Sweeney, 2016). Such accounts end up carving a bifurcated landscape: survivor researchers and activists (who work with experiential knowledge) are marked off from, and assumed to have less power than, mainstream academic researchers. What is often not foregrounded is how broader political-economic processes underpinning health research have produced uneven contours of labour exploitation and appropriation (Welsh, 2020). This means significant heterogeneity in material and symbolic power amongst mental health research workers, which invocation of the generic 'conventional researcher ' masks. In other words, many  so-called  conventional  researchers  are  also  precariously  positioned, both materially and epistemically.

## 2.1. Critical research on the university

Researchers across many disciplines have addressed academic labour relations, as well as the broader political economy of marketised and financialised universities (Ahmed,  2007;  Bates,  2021;  Boggs  and Mitchell, 2018; Brienza, 2016; Gill, 2014; Ivancheva et al., 2019; Kelley, 1996; Meyerhoff, 2019; Moten and Harney, 2004; O Keefe and Courtois, ' 2019; Thorkelson, 2016). This body of research has jettisoned the fantasy  of  an  erstwhile  virtuous  public  institution,  now  beset  from  the outside  by  malignant  capitalist  forces  that  have  eroded  academic freedom  and  scholarly  independence.  Instead,  researchers  have  analysed the university as an heterogeneous assemblage comprising varied institutional (including corporate) actors and infrastructures (Bacevic, 2018). While the university has often been imagined as the guardian of a public good, functioning at a patrician distance from the social world (a lofty  independence  invoked  through  the  ivory  tower  (see  Shapin, 2012)), these literatures demonstrate instead that the university cannot be sheared off from longer histories of racist dispossession, exploitation, and capital accumulation (Gonzalez and Meyerhoff, 2021). The gradual ´ withdrawal of state funding in many countries since the 1980s, accelerating competition for student markets and the push to develop new revenue streams, reconfigures exploitative, extractive, and appropriative  processes  through  a  cast  of  new  actors  (Rhoades  and  Slaughter, 1997; Welsh, 2020). New managerial roles have been developed whose explicit function is to deliver strategic planning to ensure competitive advantage, while research and teaching alike are subject to continuous innovation, with staff retention tied to their ability to identify and orient themselves  towards  revenue-generating  activities.  In  this  context,

In UK mental health research, increased emphasis on translational research  has  built  intimate  relations  between  universities,  biotechnology,  information  technology  and  the  pharmaceutical  industry. Faulkner-Gurstein  and  Wyatt  have  demonstrated  how  the  platform research  model  found  today  in  the  UK s  NHS  builds  research  in-' frastructures using the strategies of private firms -with an increased focus on facilitating commercial research (Faulkner-Gurstein and Wyatt, 2021). In the USA, the development of translational neuroscience has pulled universities, healthcare organisations and hospitals into alliances with  emergent  biotechnology  markets  fuelled  by  the  chaos  of  the 2007 8 economic crisis. Indeed, Robinson has argued that translational -science  and  medicine  is  primarily  a financial rather  than  a  scientific intervention: it has created a complex 'set of commercial architectures ' that  are  intended  to  embed  'academic  science  with  private  capital ' (Robinson,  2020,  p.  3).  High-level  roadmaps  for  UK  mental  health research do not specifically address questions of labour outside broad gestures  towards  building  capacity  for  mental  health  research  and including  a  wide  range  of  disciplinary  expertise.  'A  Framework  for Mental  Health  Research ,  for  example,  calls  for  a  'more  diverse  and ' representative ' workforce,  for  the  recruitment  of  wider  multidisciplinary  research  expertise,  and  for  'build[ing]  the  careers  of  service users as researchers ' (Department of Health, 2017). But there are no further details on how these changes might be effected.

As corporate actors continue to find ways to outsource risk to universities, and platformisation and commercialisation intensifies, labour relations continue to be transformed. Mental health research requires multiple kinds of labour -for which it has embedded multiple kinds of contractual and voluntary arrangements. Reliance on highly competitive, fixed-term  external  funding  and  'projectification ' entrenches stratification  among  university  workers  (Sigl,  2016),  consolidating  a distinction between, on the one hand, often relatively secure staff who have  accumulated  the  reputational  capital  necessary  for  competing effectively for grant income and, on the other, casualised junior workers charged with both the carrying out of research and its administration (Paylor and McKevitt, 2019). The unpredictability of external funding also produces potential precarity for senior staff whose contracts are in effect open rather than permanent, as they are often required to cover a proportion of their salary through grant income (Bourne, 2018). This reliance brings further fragmentation and intensification of work tasks, generating  byzantine  grant  application  regimes,  which  necessitate considerable administrative labour to navigate (Fowler et al., 2015). The research workforce spreads well beyond those on academic or research contracts. Data-intensive scientific projects are increasingly reliant on the (relatively) invisible labour of technicians, administrators and students  (e.g.  for  archiving  and  cleaning  data,  building  collaborations, ensuring access to different data across national borders, etc.) (Scroggins and Pasquetto, 2020). Crucial too -though often invisible -are the security  guards,  cleaners  and  others  who  maintain  spaces  of  research. Research participants may also be seen as sources of research labour, ranging from those receiving substantial payments for participation in clinical trials to those receiving no reimbursement at all. Satellite roles such as those of clinical research delivery staff working in the interface between universities and research active NHS Trusts (recruitment administrators,  research-active  healthcare  professionals,  research  and development managers) have considerable implications for labour in health research, since many of these roles are of short duration or programme specific (Caffrey et al., 2019; Faulkner-Gurstein et al., 2019). Further  cadres  of  staff  manage  and  facilitate  lay  involvement  and engagement in research projects, and navigate 'impact , frequently on ' precarious contracts (Watermeyer and Lewis, 2018).

Who is paid, and how, matters a great deal in mental health research materially and epistemically. Soklarides and colleagues have opened up

S.(C. Papoulias and F. Callard the  complex  personal,  organisational  and  epistemic  implications  of paying -and  not  paying -service  user  educators  involved  in  coproduced projects (Soklaridis et al., 2020). Outside of health research, Warnock and colleagues have emphasised that 'at PhD and early-career level, we are often precarious researchers researching precarious lives , ' and have insisted, as social scientists, that 'failing to pay respondents will  result  in  data  that  are  skewed  towards  the  experiences  of  the resourced ' (Warnock et al., 2022, pp. 196, 200). Pfoser and de Jong demonstrate how the structural inequalities in artist -academic collaborations in increasingly projectified, neoliberal institutions (where only certain kinds of labour tend to be remunerated) shape the kinds of work that is done and methods that are pursued (Pfoser and de Jong, 2020). But if research on the university and academic labour has done much to bring uneven contours of exploitation to visibility, we still know relatively little about how labour relations affect epistemic frameworks and knowledge production in mental health research specifically.

## 2.2. Reading material and epistemic precarities together

including major parts of ethics board submissions, data collection and analysis  and  preparing  articles  for  peer  review  (Spina  et  al.,  2020). Workers on six month fixed-term contracts can be brought in to undertake a single project task such as compiling a systematic review. This means that contract researchers (including survivor researchers) may have little  connection  to  the  overall  project,  little  agency  within  the overall research trajectory, and little chance of working to transform dominant paradigms -while also remaining invisible members of academic departments and research groups (Mason and Megoran, 2021). Bringing a broader analysis of precarity to bear on survivor researchers ' work on epistemic injustice would yield greater understanding of how working conditions attendant upon casualisation may contribute to the consolidation and exclusion of particular paradigms, methods and relationships, beyond those characterising survivor research. For example, researchers on short contracts can lack the autonomy to take methodological and epistemological risks, and staff turnover can preclude the embedding of learning across projects and disrupt the sustainability of partnerships  with  public  members  and  other  partners  (Heney  and Poleykett, 2021).

Mental health research hinges, we argue, on the entwined production of material and epistemic precarity. Analyses of knowledge production in mental health research would benefit from forging together survivor-led  analyses  of  epistemic  precarity  with  political-economic analyses of the labour relations underpinning research. Indeed such an analytics is already emerging in some recent studies from Canada and the UK, which have explored how hiring 'peer ' and survivor researchers to undertake engaged research within research ecologies characterised by  casualisation  and  project-based  funding  logics  may  end  up  compounding inequalities, in some cases by blurring the distinction between volunteering and paid work (Heney and Poleykett, 2021; MacKinnon et al., 2021). Such analyses can also help illuminate how the installation of particular labour relations can embed both behavioural and epistemic norms. For example, problems of research culture -such as bullying, poor research conduct, or the epistemic disparagement of researchers from marginalised groups -need to be addressed not as straightforward instances of power inequalities between conventional and survivor researchers, nor as problems to be solved through improving 'cultures , ' but through combatting systems producing structural and affective dependencies via contractual and other labour relations that help cement hierarchical models of intellectual leadership and patronage (Kalinga, 2019; Mason and Megoran, 2021; Peacock, 2016).

To  flesh  out  how  epistemic  inequalities  come  to  be  intimately enmeshed with configurations of labour, we consider below three kinds of actors in the research ecology of mental health research: (i) contract researchers; (ii) lay (PPI) contributors; and (iii) research participants. We  choose  these  three  categories  of  actor  for  two  reasons.  Firstly, because, in addition to being core actors involved in much mental health research  today,  they  also  represent  the  three  main  locations  where survivors  may  find  themselves:  invited  to  be  study  participants,  to collaborate as lay contributors/expert patients, and hired as contract researchers to undertake data collection and analysis. Indeed, the enterprise of survivor research is concerned with highlighting and undoing the kinds of epistemic injustice that such locations engender. Secondly, while these three locations demand precarious research labour, they are, as we show below, routinely addressed in ways that render this labour invisible and which marginalise questions of remuneration and exploitation. We want, in contrast, to make visible how these roles can aid the extraction  of  surplus  value  within  increasingly  financialised  health research systems.

## (i)  Contract researchers

In the UK, a growing proportion of academic staff subsist on fixedterm  or  so-called  atypical  and  zero  hours  contracts  (University  and College  Union,  2019).  This  'reserve  army ' of  low-wage  workers  and student  researchers  undertake  much  of  the  actual  doing  of  research,

The  exploitative  effects  of  such  contracts  are  compounded  when contract  staff  are  encouraged  to  see  themselves  as  Early  Career  Researchers (ECRs), and to interpret their invisibility and lack of agency as both necessary and temporary: the term ECR refers to a stage in a linear process of career development, a period of apprenticeship for workers on the pathway to professionalisation and recognition (Johnston and Sidaway,  2015).  However,  such  recognition  is  increasingly  elusive  and unobtainable -not only for survivor researchers, but for contract researchers more broadly. Instead contract research becomes, for most, a long apprenticeship for a future that is increasingly out of reach. As this horizon  lengthens,  contract  researchers,  precarious  workers  in  the knowledge  economy,  are  encouraged  to  develop  strategies  to  make themselves marketable, including developing grant proposals that map onto  funder  requirements  and  their  preferred  research  questions, methods and rationales, while developing their own brand through social  media  presentation,  building  networks,  impact,  and  engagement activities (Loveday, 2018). Carpenter and colleagues have argued that the promise of professionalisation is no longer about workers securing autonomy  and  reputational  capital  but  rather  about  shoring  up  the reputation of the institution. This process effectively displaces the risks of building new revenue streams (including new grants), and engaging new partners, onto those contracted researchers through the ongoing proliferation of performance management techniques (Carpenter et al., 2021).  This  long  apprenticeship  masks  the  gendered,  racialised  and ableist dimensions of precarity through the installation of yet additional forms of unpaid and exploited labour, which Kuehn and Corrigan have termed 'hope labour : 'un- or under-compensated work carried out in the ' present,  often  for  experience  or  exposure,  in  the  hope  that  future employment opportunities may follow ' (2013, p. 10).

## (ii)  Lay ('PPI ) contributors '

The inclusion of lay (including service user/survivor) contributors in health  research  further  complicates  how  labour  and  epistemic  issues intersect. As already mentioned, survivor researchers have underlined the  de-legitimation  of  user/patient  epistemic  contribution  vis-a-vis ` clinical or academic expertise, and the tokenistic and exclusionary nature of much PPI (Russo and Beresford, 2015). However, for the most part, arguments around PPI engage an understanding of 'value ' related to recognition and legitimation of patient knowledge, but divorced from the materiality of labour relations and surplus value extraction.

Typically, PPI in research in the UK does not constitute employment, as there is no contract, no line management and no obligation on the part of lay contributors to deliver on a set of predefined duties. Indeed, the continuing salience of models that profile patient altruism (Adams and  McKevitt,  2015)  and  volunteering  (Grotz  et  al.,  2021)  make  it difficult  to  represent  value  in  terms  other  than  those  of  recognition.

S.(C. Papoulias and F. Callard

However,  this  distinction  between  formal  employment  and  PPI  is becoming increasingly unstable. This is particularly notable in the current emphasis on co-production in health research, which demands long term collaborative relationships between different stakeholders, including patient groups and salaried researchers, requiring a sustainable  and  ongoing  commitment  to  the  'doing ' of  a  research  project. Indeed, in the UK, when and how to pay lay contributors is a fraught issue: current NIHR guidelines (National Institute for Health Research, 2021) leave open the question of whether PPI roles constitute employment, stating  that  depending  on  context,  service  user  or  public  contributors might  be  classified  as  employees,  self-employed,  casual workers, or volunteers -noting that such classification has considerable implications for lay contributors ' taxation, their workers ' rights,  and their ability to access welfare benefits. We see here a fraught terrain where control over the use, value, and compensation of people s labour ' raises complex questions over how health research systems draw actors into  different  kinds  of  (potentially  exploitative)  relations,  and  where there are still many unanswered questions concerning the appropriate distribution of epistemic and material value across actors and research institutions.

take on tasks -so that researchers ' rejection of individual MTurkers ' work resulted in low ratings which can negatively impact their earning capacity  (Pittman  and  Sheehan,  2016).  MTurkers  increasingly  report that they rely on the platform for income, a development which questions the extent to which their right to withdraw from a study may be exercised. Furthermore, the low rates of pay and the absence of protective legislation render this form of research participation more akin to sweatshop labour (Gleibs, 2017).

## (iii)  Research participants

To consider research participants as potentially part of a research workforce  may  appear  counter-intuitive.  After  all,  bioethics,  as  the discipline that has most visibly shaped the models for research participation, has sought to protect research participants from exploitation, and has accustomed us to ensuring that no undue incentivisation takes place  which  might  induce  people  to  participate  in  research  (Resnik, 2015). Participants, on such a model, should be compensated for their time and potential discomfort rather than paid for their labour. However, as Cooper and Waldby have argued, while bioethics has sought to keep  research  subjects  safe  from  market  forces,  by  'enshrining  the principles  of  donation,  voluntarism,  informed  consent,  and  freedom from coercion ' (Cooper and Waldby, 2014, p. 8), the growth of extensive new labour markets around research, as well as the increasing reliance of researchers on novel forms of research participation, has made such ringfencing  much  more  difficult  to  sustain.  Current  conditions  of competitive research funding, the demand for large and complex trials, and the strong incentivisation towards collaboration with industry, force a  recalibration  of  what  research  participation  might  mean.  In  this context, Monahan and Fisher have investigated what they identify as 'sacrificial labour ' of 'healthy volunteers ' for pharmaceutical Phase 1 clinical trials in the US (Monahan and Fisher, 2020). They argue that research participants in these trials are effectively workers, bound by short-term  contracts,  which  embed  exploitative  work  practices  and exacerbate racialised dispossession (Fisher et al., 2020). Monahan and Fisher conceptualise  sacrificial labour  as employer-oriented  self-sacrifice (of one s health, social relations, etc.), which ends up using the ' worker up in the service of health research, while also compromising their very sense of self and stalling their future aspirations. Relatedly, recent studies have considered how the increasing use of crowdsourcing marketplaces  for  data  collection,  for  example  Amazon s  Mechanical ' Turk platform (MTurk), effectively challenges the distinction between research participation and (under)paid labour. Thousands of scientific studies make use of MTurkers to harvest research participants: while it is difficult to discern how many of these would fall under the umbrella of 'mental  health  research ,  it  is  increasingly  the  case  that  psychology ' research  has  seized  upon  the  internet  and  commercial  platforms  in particular for easy access to larger samples and a more diverse pool of participants.  MTurkers  are  registered  users  whom  researchers  may contract individually to complete specific tasks (for example questionnaires or experimental stimuli) at very low rates of pay. In 2016, Pittman and  Sheehan  calculated  that  approximately  half  a  million  registered MTurkers were paid as little as 5 cents per task and incentivised to take on work via algorithmic rating of their performance and readiness to

The contracted clinical research participant and the MTurker blur the line between research volunteering and the zero-hours unprotected worker. Such blurring adds a particular dimension to current drives to maximise participation in health research and to extend such participation  to  those  construed  as  'hard  to  reach ' or  'underserved ' social groups.  These  drives  are  routinely  framed  as  benevolent:  widening research participation contributes to combatting health inequalities and developing inclusive treatments (National Institute for Health Research, 2020). However, if we reframe some health research participation as underpaid, unpaid, or indeed sacrificial labour in increasingly financialised  health  research  systems,  then  we  need  also  to  ask  who  is benefitting from such labour, and at what cost to those who undertake it. Much  remains  unclear -for  example  the  extent  to  which  insecure working conditions and speculative strategies (see Fisher et al., 2020) are produced through the demands that health research makes on the bodies and minds of research participants; the extent to which research participation, under conditions of austerity, becomes a crucial source of income, and for whom; or whether mental health service users, who are frequently disproportionately dispossessed through discriminatory structural  logics  including  racism,  are  particularly  disadvantaged  in relation to the changing labour relations governing research participation.

## 2.3. On not feeding the beast

We  wish  to  end  by  looking  at  two  articles  that  contribute  to combatting epistemic precarity by proposing ways to integrate survivor researchers into the research workforce. We do so to make clear some of the challenges of addressing epistemic and material precarity together. Each  article  puts  forward  different  solutions,  and  each  relies  on  a different  form  of  professionalisation.  In  'Management  of  a  HighPerforming Mental Health Recovery Research Group , Mike Slade out-' lines a leadership model which embraces the commodification of academic productivity and trains survivor researchers to ' ' [feed] the beast ' by  meeting  key  performance  indicators ' (Slade,  2021,  p.  1).  Slade s ' approach consists in tightly managing a highly efficient production line to maximise publications and other 'deliverables ' so that each post-graduate researcher employed for five-years on a grant 'can expect to emerge with 25 new grant-related papers in their CV . This produc-' tion line logic is enabled and sustained through what the author describes  as  a  tight  support  structure:  regular  and  highly  structured supervisions as well as group activities which consolidate a shared group identity. Noting that all researchers in his group have fixed-term contracts funded through grants, Slade recognises that many face financial insecurity, housing pressures and 'ongoing mental health difficulties . In ' this  recognition  however,  the  effects  of  material  precarity  become visible only as individual anxieties that may be kept at bay by balancing appropriate accommodations without compromising high job expectations. Researchers are to understand that their continuing employment relies on their ability to deliver: 'we are a professional research group and not a charity ' (Slade, 2021, p. 4). Here professionalisation is presented as a balm only to a select few capable of shearing off the effects of material  precarity  by  becoming  more  competitive  in  a  brutal  labour market.

By  contrast,  in  'Lived  Experience,  Research  Leadership,  and  the Transformation of Mental Health Services: Building a Researcher Pipeline , Nev Jones and colleagues argue that the integration of user/sur-' vivor researchers would require a capacious transformation of, rather

S.(C. Papoulias and F. Callard than adherence to, the current terrain of mental health research and services, through a targeted investment of resources that generates a 'research pipeline ' for survivor researchers. They advocate for proactive recruitment of those with psychiatric disabilities and recognise the need for a 'flexible approach to work and academic accommodations , along ' the lines of mentoring and training afforded to other under-represented groups in the academy. Furthermore, they argue for a challenging of ableism ('the assumption that psychiatric disability, particularly when involving psychosis or cognitive challenges … is the antithesis of academic excellence ' (Jones et al., 2021, p. 2)), and a recognition that a survivor workforce challenges the normative equation of professionalism with scientific neutrality (Jones et al., 2021).

The political commitments and social imaginaries of these two articles are very different: indeed, Jones and colleagues ' article unpacks and critiques the ableism that underpins rationalised production lines upon which Slade s model appears to rely. While Slade imagines that sus-' tained  and  disciplined  adherence  to  the  demands  of  the  marketised university is the pathway for survival, Jones and colleagues conjure an alternative professionalisation of inclusion which can enable and support survivor researchers to survive within a hostile system. Notably this second article relates to the U.S. mental health research ecosystem, in which some tenure-track positions still exist; even so, it is hard to imagine  how  such  a  pipeline  and  the  radical  inclusion  practices  which would  underpin  it  might  subsist  in  the  current  research  landscape. Providing resources and accommodations for marginalised groups can only have a limited effect in research environments which, in striving for ever higher standards of competitiveness, aim to potentially intensify the extraction of value from future researchers. Epistemic precarities, we argue, cannot be meaningfully addressed without also challenging the broader processes of precaritisation research ecosystems rely on.

see Callard, 2022). While survivor analyses of health research as a site of epistemic injustice have consistently opened the terrain of power relations  to  further  scrutiny,  survivor  research,  in  its  concentration  on epistemic precarity, may unwittingly flatten out the heterogeneity of material precarities and exploitative labour relations which inflect and shape  epistemic  cultures  and  the  doing  of  health  research.  Through indicating  how  labour  relations  are  intertwined  with  epistemic  inequalities, and calling for additional, empirical and conceptual research that would help us understand their relation, we want to open other paths towards both understanding uneven terrains of knowledge production and envisaging means of effecting change. Survivor research is only one of a number of interdisciplinary research sites that address epistemic  precarity  and  it  is  our  hope  that  our  analysis  here  can  be complemented by other efforts to document how epistemic and material precarity coalesce in health research.

The desire to open up pathways to professionalisation for marginalised figures cannot escape certain contradictions: professionalisation as a process, even when aiming to be more inclusive, necessarily runs into the difficulty of distinguishing between forms of labour as worthy or not  worthy  of  the  'protections ' of  the  professional  (Carpenter  et  al., 2021).  While  histories  of  professionalisation  have  made  clear  how bottom-up pushes towards professionalisation have allowed precarious workers to gain rights and better conditions (Vaidyanathan, 2012), we want to raise caution concerning the extent to which professionalisation, or  indeed  a  push  for  recognition  and  inclusivity  in  mental  health research,  can  adequately  address  the  problems  of  both  material  and epistemic precarity that we have raised here.

By proposing that we cease 'feeding  the  beast ,  we  hope  to  bring ' greater attention to the frames and discourses that commonly surround discussions  of  research  culture -those  of  productivity,  reputation, excellence, and economic value. In making their assumptions, and their limitations, more visible, we hope to encourage the use and generation of other vocabularies and other imaginaries through which to envisage the creation of sustainable research communities that combat material and  epistemic  precarity  together.  What  kinds  of  social  relations  and infrastructures can we build and nourish, and what kinds of labour relations ought we collectively demand and fight for, so as to support not only survivor researchers, but also other epistemically and materially precarious actors, in the ecology of mental health research?

## 3. Conclusion

Current initiatives to improve research cultures in health research will founder if they do not address the profoundly uneven labour relations  and  dependencies  that  underpin  health  research  systems  and further consolidate the joint production of material and epistemic precarity. While some initiatives around research culture do acknowledge the need to improve job security if one is to improve research integrity (Metcalfe et al., 2020), it remains uncommon for labour relations to be the site of sustained and explicit analysis -let alone a focus for urgent amelioration -in accounts of scientific knowledge production (though

If universities are sites of capital accumulation, we need to deepen our understanding of how particular organisational actors (including funders, para-sectoral bodies, and implementers of government policies) have experimented with new kinds of labour relations in health research (see  Mitchell,  2015).  Addressing  material  and  epistemic  precarities together is, we argue, a powerful way to promote such understanding. For example, it allows us to explore how the blurring between research participant and gig economy worker alters the social relations underpinning research and affects the data elicited through it. It also enables us to consider how imperatives to maximise patient recruitment and increase 'inclusivity ' in research might have unanticipated effects on the bodies  and  minds  of  those  targeted  by  them.  In  this  paper  we  have focused on mental health research, and on the figure of the survivor in particular, insofar as this figure can shuttle between various roles in an ever-expanding workforce: contract researcher, lay contributor, study participant. If patients and service users are now being positioned as workers within a broader mental health research landscape, then we can make use of this positioning as a vantage point from which to analyse how such new forms of precarity and labour exploitation underpin the broader business models structuring mental health research.

Bringing survivor research insights and critical analyses of university labour  together  should  point  to  other  ways  of  developing  sites  and modes  of  relation  through  which  the  survivor  researcher,  amongst others, might generate knowledge. For, as Voronka has described it, we need to find ways of disturbing and rerouting processes that otherwise end up commodifying survivors ' experiences of madness within systems that, through their very commitment to smooth, psychiatric recovery, 'sustain our subjugation ' (Voronka, 2017, p. 337). As incoming generations  of  researchers  and  other  workers  involved  in  mental  health research struggle against insecure and exploitative working conditions, they will  face  the  challenge  of  attempting  to  build  'security  through reciprocity and solidarity ' (Facer, 2020, p. 39). We want to push for forms of relation that subsist outside or beyond the contractual, and frequently exploitative, relations so common in health research today. If professionalisation is underpinned by geographies of exclusion, where 'unprofessional ' others are shed, then we need to work towards other horizons. Learning from the epistemic and material vantage point of the survivor researcher in mental health research is one place to start in creating new solidarities in precarity.
