## Perception and Production of Prosody by Speakers with Autism Spectrum Disorders

Rhea Paul, 1,2,3 Amy Augustyn, 2 Ami Klin, 2 and Fred R. Volkmar 2

Speakers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show difficulties in suprasegmental aspects of speech production, or prosody , those aspects of speech that accompany words and sentences and create what is commonly called ''tone of voice.'' However, little is known about the perception of prosody, or about the specific aspects of prosodic production that result in the perception of ''oddness.'' The present study examined the perception and production of a range of specific prosodic elements in an experimental protocol involving natural speech among speakers with ASD between 14 and 21 years of age, in comparison with a typical control group. Results revealed ceiling effects limiting interpretation of findings for some aspects of prosody. However, there were significant between-group differences in aspects of stress perception and production. The implications of these findings for understanding prosodic deficits is speakers with autism spectrum disorders, and for future research in this area, are discussed.

## INTRODUCTION

Since the first delineation of the autistic syndrome (Kanner, 1943), abnormal prosody has been frequently identified as a core feature of the syndrome for individuals with autism who speak (Pronovost, Wakstein &amp; Wakstein, 1966; Rutter &amp; Lockyer, 1967; Ornitz &amp; Ritvo, 1976; Fay &amp; Schuler, 1980; Tager-Flusberg, 1981; Baltaxe &amp; Simmons, 1985, 1992; Paul, 1987). Differences noted in early, observational reports included monotonic or machine-like intonation, deficits in the use of pitch and control of volume, deficiencies in vocal quality, and use of aberrant stress patterns. Speakers with both high functioning autism (HFA) and Asperger

syndrome (AS) have been reported to demonstrate these difficulties (Ghaziuddin &amp; Gerstein, 1996; Shriberg et al ., 2001). Prosodic deficits have not been universally reported, however. Simmons and Baltaxe (1975), for example, found that only four out of the seven adolescents with autism they studied had notable suprasegmental differences in their speech. Paul et al ., (2004) reported abnormal prosody in 47 % of the 30 speakers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) studied. When such behaviors are present, however, the prosody characteristics of a person with autism constitute one of the most significant obstacles to his or her social integration and vocational acceptance. Prosodic differences are persistent and show little change over time, even when other aspects of language improve (Rutter &amp; Lockyer, 1967; Kanner, 1971; DeMyer et al ., 1973; Simmons &amp; Baltaxe, 1975). Paul et al ., (2004) report that prosodic differences are significantly related to ratings of ASD speakers' social and communicative competence. Moreover, Mesibov (1992) and

VanBourgondien and Woods (1992) reported that it is the vocal presentation of individuals with autism that most immediately creates an impression of oddness.

Recent reviews of prosodic findings in speakers with ASDs (Shriberg et al ., 2001; McCann &amp; Peppe, 2003) emphasize the numerous deficiencies in the current literature on this topic. There has been little research on the ability of speakers with ASD to perceive and understand prosodic cues, except as these cues are used in relation to affect; specifically, the ability to match emotional tone in speech to a facial expression. The focus of research on prosody has typically been on one aspect at a time, without regard to creating a fuller description of the prosodic features of speech in these individuals. There have, for example, been studies of stress (Fay, 1969; Baltaxe, 1984; Baltaxe &amp; Guthrie, 1987; Baltaxe &amp; Simmons, 1985; McCaleb &amp; Prizant, 1985; Fine, Bartolucci, Ginsberg &amp; Szatmari, 1991; Fosnot &amp; Jun, 1999), phrasing (Fine, et al ., 1991; Thurber &amp; Tager-Flusberg, 1993), and intonation (Baltaxe, Simmons, &amp; Zee, 1984; Fay &amp; Schuler, 1980; Fine et al ., 1991; Paccia &amp; Curcio, 1982); but only one (Fine et al ., 1991) that looked across all three areas. Both reviews highlight the fact that methodological difficulties abound, including small sample sizes, absence of normative data and contrast groups, poorly defined prosodic categories, and the use of subjective ratings, rather than objective measures.

Shriberg et al ., (2001), in an attempt to address some of these problems, reported on a range of suprasegmental characteristics of continuous speech in speakers with HFA and AS, using a standard assessment method, the Prosody-Voice Screening Profile (Shriberg, Kwiatkowski &amp; Rasmussen, 1990). This study found few differences in prosodic production between speakers with HFA and AS. There were significant differences between these two diagnostic groups and typical speakers; however, these were not widespread, but focused in a few areas, most notably the use of stress and the presence of hypernasal voice quality.

## Functions of Prosody

Prosody is defined as the suprasegmental properties of the speech signal that modulate and enhance its meaning. Prosody functions at several levels to enable speakers to construct discourse through expressive language. Crystal (1986), Kent and Read (1992), Merewether and Alpert (1990), McCann and

Peppe (2003) and Panagos and Prelock (1997) provide various accounts of these levels, which can be categorized in three subdomains.

Grammatical prosody includes suprasegmental cues that are used to signal syntactic information within sentences (Warren, 1996). Stress can be used grammatically within words to signal, for example, whether a token is being used as a noun ( con vict ) or a verb ( con vict ). Pitch contours signal the ends of utterances and denote whether they are questions (rising pitch) or statements (falling pitch). Grammatical uses of prosody are generally obligatory aspects of the production of the surface structure that are an inherent part of the transformation from deep structure meanings (Gerken, 1996; Gerken &amp; McGregor, 1998).

Pragmatic prosody is used to carry social information beyond that conveyed by the syntax of the sentence. It conveys the speaker's intentions or the hierarchy of information within the utterance, and results in optional changes in the way an utterance is expressed (Van Lancker, Canter &amp; Terbeek, 1981; Winner, 1988). Stress, as one example, can be used to highlight an element of information within a sentence as the focus of attention. This pragmatic use of stress, usually referred to as emphatic or contrastive stress, calls the listener's attention to information that is new to the conversation, unfamiliar, or unexpected within the sentence. Emphatic stress is used to highlight the comment or predicate of an utterance, the portion that elaborates on the topic established within the discourse (Haviland &amp; Clark, 1974; Bates &amp; McWhinney, 1979).

Finally, affective prosody serves more global functions than those subserved by the prior two forms. Affective prosody includes changes in register used for varying social functions (e.g., differences among the ways an individual talks to peers, to young children, and to people of higher social status). Affective prosody is also involved in conveying a speaker's general feeling state (Bolinger, 1989; Hargrove, 1997). For example, a wife would produce the utterance ''My husband's plane hasn't landed yet'' with different suprasegmental characteristics, depending on whether she were feeling relaxed about having a little time remaining before she had to leave for the airport, or anxious because the time at which the plane should have landed was long past.

It can be hypothesized that the prosodic deficits so frequently attributed to people with autistic syndromes reside primarily in its pragmatic and affective aspects, with grammatical aspects relatively spared.

This hypothesis stems from two sources. First, there is a literature of well-documented grammatical and morphological strengths in individuals with HFA and AS, compared to their reduced abilities in the meaningful use of language for social communication (Tager-Flusberg, 1981, 1995; Landa, 2000). Secondly, the current body of research on prosody in autism can be interpreted to suggest that a majority of the identified deficits reside in pragmatic and affective functions. For example, Ricks (1975) and Lord, Rutter and DeLavore (1996) demonstrated that parents have more difficulty identifying the emotional content of prespeech vocalization in their children with autism than do parents of children with mental retardation or normal language. Several studies (Boucher, Lewis, &amp; Collis 1998; Hobson, Ouston &amp; Lee, 1988, 1989; Van Lancker, Cornelius &amp; Krieman 1989) have shown that children with autism have difficulty matching vocally expressed affect to facial expressions or to emotion words (e.g., happy , sad , scared ). A few studies have suggested greater problems with pragmatic/affective function than with grammatical use of stress (Fine et al ., 1991) and pauses (Thurber &amp; Tager-Flusberg, 1993).

## Rationale and Study Goals

The present study attempts to build on the results of Shriberg et al ., (2001). It provides an experimental paradigm in which more controlled contexts for prosodic production were created, in order to examine a larger number of instances of these prosodic elements than may occur in natural speech. Moreover, the study aims to examine the same prosodic elements in perception in order to contrast performance in the two modalities, and attempt to understand more deeply the roots of prosodic production deficits. Finally, we contrast the prosodic elements in grammatical vs. pragmatic/ affective contexts. In this way, we attempt to discover whether the same elements are dealt with more effectively by speakers with ASD, as we would predict, when serving a grammatical function. Thus we examine responses to experimental tasks designed to tap both perception and production of three aspects of prosody: stress (emphasis on syllables and words), intonation (pitch changes over the course of phrases and sentences), and phrasing (the pattern of rate and pausing within utterances). We have devised tasks for each element in the service of both a grammatical and a pragmatic/affective function in both an expressive and receptive modality.

## METHOD

## Participants

Subjects with ASD

Twenty-seven participants with ASD participated in this study. They consisted of all the individuals with any form of ASD who participated in a study of high functioning autism at the Yale Child Study Center's Developmental Disabilities Section within a 1-year time period. To qualify for the highfunctioning study, subjects were required to have a diagnosis within the ASD spectrum, a verbal IQ greater than 70 and to have fluent use of spoken language. These individuals had completed an extensive protocol as part of two projects on the neurobiology of autism. The protocol included data from standardized assessments of cognitive, language, and social-adaptive functioning, and a videocassette recording of a conversational speech sample obtained during a semistructured diagnostic interview. Diagnostic characterization included the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R; Lord, Rutter &amp; LeCouteur, 1994) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G; Lord et al ., 2000). Diagnostic assignment followed DSM-IV criteria for autism, AS, and Pervasive Developmental Disorders-Not Otherwise Specified (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Clinical diagnoses were confirmed independently by two experienced clinicians (AK and FV) with demonstrated interrater reliability (Klin, Lang, Cicchetti &amp; Volkmar, 2000). Fifty-two percent (14) of the subjects were diagnosed as HFA by these methods; 37 % (10) as AS, and 11 % (3) as Pervasive Developmental Disorders-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). As can be seen in Table I, subjects' average age-equivalent scores for written communication were over 10 years, or fifth grade level. The subject with the lowest written communication score had a written communication ageequivalent of 8 years, or second to third grade level. Participants' average age was 16.8 (SD 6.6).

Table I provides additional information on the 27 participants with ASD. As can be seen, the subjects, on average scored well within the normal range of verbal IQ, and tested within the normal range on standard measures of both expressive and receptive language. However, their adaptive use of communication, as evidenced by their Vineland Adaptive Behavior scores, were significantly low, as were their scores on the Socialization scale of this measure. This profile of normal performance on standard tests, but

Typically Developing Controls

Thirteen typically developing subjects were recruited through local schools and personal connections. Their average age was 16.7 (SD 3.7). All were enrolled in appropriate age for grade in school, were considered by parents to be achieving normally in school, and had no history of speech, language or learning problems or of special education.

## Procedures

Subjects were seen individually for administration of the prosody protocol by the second author (AA). Each administration took 45-60 minutes. There were 12 sections in the protocol, which appear in Table II. Each section contained a set of two training items. In the first, the examiner provided a typical item and the correct response. In the second, the examiner provided an item, asked the subject for a response, corrected and explained the response if it was incorrect, and praised the subject for a correct answer, whether it was on the first or second try. All subjects were able to perform correctly on the training items for each section.

All spoken stimuli for the perception tasks were prerecorded in live voice so that all subjects heard the same stimuli. All of the subjects' spoken responses for the production tasks were audiorecorded for later

analysis by a rater blind to subject diagnosis. All written responses were recorded on score sheets prepared for the study. Readability of the sentences used in the study was assessed using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level procedure that is included in the MicroSoft Word software package. Readability of the written stimuli was rated by this procedure at grade 1.3. Since the lowest functioning subject in the study had a written language grade equivalent of 2-3, and the average grade equivalent for written language was grade 5, the written stimuli used here are appropriate for the reading level of all subjects tested.

## Scoring

For all six Perception sections (grammatical stress, intonation, and phrasing; pragmatic/affective stress, intonation, and phrasing), subjects indicated responses by either marking one of two choices following a written, unpunctuated version of what they heard on the prerecorded stimuli (grammatical stress, intonation, phrasing, pragmatic stress), or pointing to a picture (pragmatic intonation and phrasing). When the subject recorded his own response on the score sheet, these were scored directly later by a rater blind to the subject's diagnostic classification. When the subject indicated a picture, the examiner marked the description of the picture (adult, child; calm, excited) on a score sheet following the subject's choice. (See Appendix for sample score sheets.)

For all six production sections, subjects' spoken responses were prerecorded and scored at a later time by an examiner blind to the subject's diagnostic classification.

## Task Description

The tasks listed in Table II are described below. Sentences within each set were presented in randomized order. There were 24 items in each task, consisting of 12 pairs of contrasting stimuli (e.g., con vict; con vict ).

Grammatical Perception of Stress (words chosen from Quirk, Greenbawn, Leech &amp; Svartivik 1990)

## Instructions

Mark the sentence on your paper that contains the correct way of saying word you hear on the tape. For example, if you heard the word recall (re call ) you would mark the first sentence in this pair:

I can't recall his name.

They had a recall on this model car.

But if you heard the word recall ( re call), you would mark the second sentence.

[Each word is heard twice, once with the first syllable stressed (as a noun) and once with the second (as a verb). The same pair of sentence choices was presented for each of the two pronunciations.]

Grammatical Production of Stress (words chosen from Quirk et al ., 1990)

## Instructions

Read each sentence on your paper to yourself. Then read the underlined word aloud. For example, if you see the sentence

I can't recall his name.

You will read the underlined word as re call .

But if you see the sentence

They had a recall on this model car.

You will read the underlined word as re call.

Grammatical Perception of Intonation (procedure based on Patel, Peretz, Tramo &amp; Lebreave 1998)

Instructions

Listen to each sentence on the tape, and mark on your paper whether the speaker is asking or telling. For example, if you hear ''She has a dog,'' you would mark ''telling.'' But if you hear, ''She has a dog?'' you would mark ''asking.''

Grammatical Production of Intonation (procedure based on Patel, Perez, Tramo &amp; Lebreque, 1998)

Instructions

Listen to me tell you how to say each sentence written on your paper. Then read the sentence aloud the way I told you. For example, if I say, ''For sentence #1, tell what he likes.'' You would read the sentence this way: ''He likes ice cream.'' But if I say, ''For sentence # 2, ask what he likes.'' You would read the sentence this way: ''He likes ice cream?''

Grammatical Perception of Phrasing (procedure based on Patel et al ., 1998)

## Instructions

Listen to each sentence on the tape, then circle the correct answer to the question that follows it on

your paper. For example, if you hear ''Ellen, the dentist, is here,'' and the question reads ''Is she talking to Ellen?'' you would circle ''no.'' But if you hear ''Ellen, the dentist is here,'' and the question reads ''Is she talking to Ellen?'' you would circle ''yes.''

Grammatical Production of Phrasing (procedure based on Patel et al., 1998)

## Instructions

Listen as I read the first sentence in each pair. Then read the second sentence so that the one I read is true. For example, if I read this sentence:

Ellen is a dentist,

you could make that true by reading the second sentence like this:

''Ellen, the dentist, is here.''

But if I read

You are talking to Ellen,

you could make that true by reading the second sentence like this:

''Ellen, the dentist is here.''

Pragmatic Perception of Stress (procedure based on Patel et al., 1998)

## Instructions

Read the two sentences on your paper to yourself. Then listen to the one on the tape. Check off the sentence that should come before the one you hear. For example, if you hear, ''I want chocolate ice cream,'' a sentence like ''Do you want vanilla?'' would have come before it. But if you hear, ''I want chocolate ice cream ,'' the sentence before it is, ''Do you want chocolate cake?''

Pragmatic Production of Stress (procedure based on Patel et al., 1998)

## Instructions

Listen to me read the first sentence in each pair. Then read the second one aloud the way it would be spoken if you were answering me. For example, if I read, ''Do you want vanilla?'' the next sentence would sound like ''I want chocolate ice cream.'' But if I read, ''Do you want chocolate cake?'' the next sentence would sound like, ''I want chocolate ice cream .''

Pragmatic Perception of Intonation

## Instructions

Here is a picture of a baby, and here is a picture of an adult. Listen to each sentence on the tape, then point to the picture of the person the sentence is spoken to. For example, if I say, ''You look nice {normal intonation}'' you would think I was talking to this one {adult picture}. But if I say, ''You look nice {motherese intonation},'' you would think I was talking to this one {baby picture}.

## Pragmatic Production of Intonation

## Instructions

Read each sentence as if you were talking to the person in the picture by the sentence. For example, if you were talking to the adult, you would say, ''You look nice {normal intonation}'' But if you were talking to the baby, you would say, ''You look nice motherese intonation.

Pragmatic Perception of Phrasing

## Instructions

Here is a picture of a lady feeling calm, and here is a picture of a lady who is excited. Listen to each sentence on the tape, then point to the picture of the one who would be saying that sentence. For example, you hear

''You're going to be late for school.''

you would think it was the calm-looking lady talking, so you would point to this picture. But your hear,

''You're going to be late for school!!''

you would think it was the excited lady talking, so you would point to that picture.

Pragmatic Production of Phrasing

## Instructions

Read each sentence as if it were said by someone who feels the way the person in the picture next to the sentence does. If you see a calm person, like this, you will read the sentence calmly, like this:

You're going to be late for school.

But if you see the excited person, like this, you will read the sentence as if you were hurried and excited, like this:

You're going to be late for school!!

## Reliability

As stated earlier, responses to prosodic perception tasks were written by subjects on score sheets. These responses were entered into the study database directly from the subject's response sheets. All responses to the prosodic production tasks produced by subjects with ASD were double scored by a second rater, as were the responses of 25 % of the subjects with typical development (TD). Agreement was computed by dividing the score given by the first rater on each item for each subject oneachproductiontaskbythescoregiven by the second rater. Average agreement on the six production tasks computedinthiswayrangedfrom82.3to99.6 % . Overall agreement averaged across the six tasks was 90.0 % .

## RESULTS

Figures 1 and 2 display the mean percentage correct scores on the six perception (Fig. 1) and six production (Fig. 2) tasks in the study.

To analyze results, a Mixed Model Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance was used, with diagnostic group as the between-subjects factor with two levels (ASD, TD). Within-subject factors were:

- /C15 Prosodic function, with two levels (grammatical, pragmatic/affective),
- /C15 Prosodic element, with three levels (stress, intonation, phrasing), and
- /C15 Prosodic mode, with two levels (perception, production).

Table III presents the outcome of this analysis. There were significant main effects for function and element, suggesting that all subjects responded differently to the grammatical vs. pragmatic/affective items, and to the three prosodic elements: stress, intonation and phrasing. There was also a non-significant trend toward an overall difference between the diagnostic groups. As seen in Figs 1 and 2, the subjects with TD, as agroup,performedbetterthanthosewithASDonnine

- 2. Element · function: suggesting there were differences among the three prosodic elements depending on prosodic function (grammatical vs. pragmatic/affective).
- 3. Function · mode: suggesting there were differences between the two functions (grammatical vs. pragmatic/affective), depending on the modality.
- 4. Element · Dx: The two diagnostic groups showed different patterns of response to the three prosodic elements.

There was not, however, the predicted interaction between diagnostic group and prosodic function,

suggesting the subjects with ASD did not show different response patterns from peers with TD to grammatical vs. pragmatic/affective prosody tasks. It should be noted, however, that there were ceiling effects in these data. As can be seen in Figs 1 and 2, five of the twelve tasks showed performance in both groups near 100 % :

- /C15 Grammatical perception of intonation
- /C15 Grammatical production of intonation
- /C15 Pragmatic/affective perception of phrasing
- /C15 Pragmatic/affective production of phrasing
- /C15 Pragmatic perception of intonation

These tasks would appear to be too easy for these subjects to tap their underlying competence in the constructs of interest, and may be obscuring differences that would be present in more difficult prosodic activities.

In order to look more closely at betweendiagnostic group differences, post-hoc tests were carried out for each of the 12 diagnostic group comparisons. The results of this analysis appear in Table IV. It can be seen there that there were significant differences between the two groups in the grammatical production of stress, as well as in the pragmatic/affective perception and production of stress. Moreover, there was a trend toward significance in the difference between groups on the grammatical perception of stress, and this difference was larger than any other non-significant finding. No other between-group differences reached significance.

## DISCUSSION

This study suggests that speakers with ASD show differences from typical age-mates in select areas of prosodic performance. It provides support, first, for the finding reported by Shriberg et al ., (2001) that stress is an area of particular difficulty for these speakers. Tasks involving stress that were most affected included both production and perception of pragmatic/affective, or emphatic stress. Production of grammatical, or lexical stress was also affected, and perception of lexical stress showed a difference that approached significance. Thus both understanding and producing appropriate stress patterns appear to be difficult for these speakers with ASD, regardless of whether stress is used in the service of grammatical or pragmatic/affective functions.

Stress appeared to be the only area of prosodic function in which significant differences were found. However, in examining the data in Figs 1 and 2, it is clear that for five of the 12 tasks, both groups scored above 90 % correct. This finding suggests that these tasks were simply too easy for the present subjects. Examining the tasks that fell in this group, it appears that both grammatical understanding and use of the intonation pattern that distinguishes statements from questions (grammatical perception and production of Intonation) are well established in both diagnostic groups. Both groups also appeared able to distinguish child-directed from adult-directed speech (pragmatic/ affective perception of intonation) consistently.

There were no differences between the groups on pragmatic/affective production of intonation, or the ability to use child-directed and adult-directed speech styles appropriately. Performance for neither group reached a ceiling; both groups scored in the 80-90 % correct range. However, it was our impression that the teenagers with TD were frequently embarrassed to produce a child-directed speech style in the presence of the relatively unknown and only slightly older examiner (AA). The speakers with ASD, on the other hand, gave us the impression that they were trying their best to comply with the task and did not show any noticeable signs of embarrassment at this task. It is possible, then, that in a different testing circumstance, such as in the presence of a more compelling child-addressee than the pictures provided here, and without the presence of another person to make the TD speakers feel foolish, a greater difference on this task might have been seen. Only further experimentation will allow for the verification of this speculation.

For pragmatic/affective perception and production of phrasing, we again saw near-ceiling performance in both groups. Clinical impressions lead us again, however, to raise questions about the validity of these findings. Here we observed that the speakers with ASD appeared to adopt a ''strategy'' for approaching this task. That is, in the recordings of the ''excited'' versions of the sentences in the task, the rate of speech was very rapid and pause time within sentences was reduced. In the ''calm'' versions, speech was at a slightly slower-than-normal rate with normal pauses. It was our observation that subjects with ASD ''cued in'' to the rate difference and used it exclusively to solve the problem posed in these tasks. We were led to this impression by the fact that, unlike the TD subjects, ASD subjects frequently did not listen to the whole sentence before choosing the ''calm'' or ''excited'' picture in response to the perception items. As soon as they were able to discern the rate in the stimulus, often after only the first or second word in the prerecorded sentence, they made their choice. The TD teenagers, on the other hand, listened to the entire sentence and make their judgment based on a more wholistic assessment of the emotion conveyed. In the production of pragmatic phrasing task, we observed a similar phenomenon. The speakers with ASD often produced sentences in a somewhat rote, speeded up production when an ''excited'' version was indicated. Although these versions were considered correct by the blind rater, they often lacked, subjectively, some portion of the affective quality of excitement, beyond the rapid rate.

The other tasks in which there were neither differences nor ceiling effects involved grammatical perception and production of phrasing, examined here by the ability to use pauses to signal referential vs. non-referential phrases within sentences [ Ellen , the dentist , (appositive phrase) is here vs. Ellen , (addressee) the dentist is here ]. Here it appeared that the task was a bit difficult for both groups, with accuracy again between 80 and 90 % correct. We did not observe any noticeable difference in the way the two groups approached this task, however.

To summarize the findings of this study, then, it could be said that all aspects of stress examined appeared to pose some difficulty for speakers with ASD. In grammatical areas of areas of intonation and phrasing, we did not observe differences either quantitatively or qualitatively, but there were ceiling effects on both perception and production of grammatical intonation that may have affected results. Ceiling effects may also have limited the ability to find differ- ences in the pragmatic perception of intonation. For pragmatic production of Intonation, contextual factors, i.e., the TD teenagers' reluctance to talk ''baby talk'' with an unfamiliar young examiner may have limited their performance in this task. For pragmatic phrasing, qualitative observations suggest that speakers with ASD may have achieved a ceiling level on these tasks by the adoption of a ''talk fast/talk slow'' strategy for solving the problem of identifying and producing agitated affect, rather than using a more wholistic approach to understanding and expressing prosodic cues to the feeling of excitement.

Thus, it would be possible to suggest that even though we failed to find the predicted interaction effect between diagnostic group and prosodic function in these data, further research with more refined tasks may yet show that speakers with ASD do have more difficulty with some aspects of pragmatic/affective prosody than they do with these same elements in grammatical contexts. Only additional experimental work in this area can determine whether or not this suggestion is borne out. The finding that although there were differences in both grammatical and pragmatic/affective stress tasks, the differences between speakers with ASD and TD were consistently larger on the pragmatic/affective than the grammatical tasks tends to lend some support to this speculation.

## Clinical Implications

Suggestions for addressing the prosodic deficits of speakers with ASDs can be drawn from both the quantitative and qualitative results of this study. Quantitatively, it appears that learning to understand and use stress to express a variety of meanings is a reasonable goal for speakers with ASD who evidence prosodic oddities. For these speakers, focus on the communicative value of stress, to highlight important elements in the message, by making them louder and longer than other words would seem a reasonable approach. Metalinguistic activities in which students with ASD identify important words in sentences, then experiment with ways to vocally highlight those words, using both clinician feedback and self-monitoring through review of recordings of the various methods of emphasis tried, might be helpful.

The qualitative observations regarding the ways in which speakers with ASD approached the tasks in this study are also revealing. Just as these subjects can score quite high on standard language measures, at the same time as they perform remarkably lower on measures of adaptive communication, they appear to

be able to focus on a limited number of cues in order to solve the problems posed by these items, without necessarily possessing the full panoply of prosodic tools that result in natural-sounding expression. This finding suggests a danger in focusing too narrowly on one aspect of prosody when attempting to change prosodic performance. A metalinguistic approach, which features talking about what prosody is, what it is used for, using examples that serve a range of functions with a range of prosodic elements may be a better approach than treating one element in one context before moving on to another.

## Future Research

Although this study attempted to address some of the shortcomings of the earlier literature on prosody in ASD,it has by no means solved them all. In addition to the limitations reflected in the ceiling effects and qualitative observations discussed here, it must be remembered that the present study continued to use simple perceptual judgments for deciding when a prosodic production was correct or not. In addition, natural, uncontrolled speech was used as the stimuli for perception tasks. Research that involves more controlled stimuli, perhaps using advanced synthesized speech, and more objective measures of prosodic output, incorporating acoustic analyses would clearly be an improvement on the present methods. Similarly, using non-ASD contrast groups would extend our understanding of the role of prosody in this and other disorders. Several studies have shown, for example, that children with specific language disorders (Baltaxe, Simmons &amp; Zee, 1984; Hargrove, 1997; Gerken &amp; McGregor, 1998) and mental retardation (Shriberg &amp; Widder, 1990) also exhibit prosodic deficits. Learning more about the similarities and differences in prosody across these diagnostic groups would clearly enhance understanding of its role in communication in these populations.
