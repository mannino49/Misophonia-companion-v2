Introduction: Misophonia  is  a  recently  described,  poorly  understood  and  neglected  condition.
It is  characterized  by  strong  negative  reactions  of  hatred,  anger  or  fear  when  subjects  have  to
face some  selective  and  low  level  repetitive  sounds.  The  most  common  ones  that  trigger  such
aversive reactions  are  those  elicited  by  the  mouth  (chewing  gum  or  food,  popping  lips)  or  the
nose (breathing,  snifﬁng,  and  blowing)  or  by  the  ﬁngers  (typing,  kneading  paper ,  clicking  pen,
drumming on  the  table).  Previous  articles  have  cited  that  such  individuals  usually  know  at  least
one close  relative  with  similar  symptoms,  suggesting  a  possible  hereditary  component.
Objective: We  found  and  described  a  family  with  15  members  having  misophonia,  detailing
their common  characteristics  and  the  pattern  of  sounds  that  trigger  such  strong  discomfort.
Methods: All  15  members  agreed  to  give  us  their  epidemiological  data,  and  12  agreed  to  answer
a speciﬁc  questionnaire  which  investigated  the  symptoms,  speciﬁc  trigger  sounds,  main  feelings
evoked and  attitudes  adopted  by  each  participant.
Results: The  15  members  belong  to  three  generations  of  the  family.  Their  age  ranged  from  9
to 73  years  (mean  38.3  years;  median  41  years)  and  10  were  females.  Analysis  of  the  12  ques-
tionnaires showed  that  10  subjects  (83.3%)  developed  the  ﬁrst  symptoms  during  childhood  or
adolescence. The  mean  annoyance  score  on  the  Visual  Analog  Scale  from  0  to  10  was  7.3  (median
7.5). Individuals  reported  hatred/anger ,  irritability  and  anxiety  in  response  to  sounds,  and
faced the situation  asking  to  stop  the  sound,  leaving/avoiding  the  place  and  even  ﬁghting.  The
self-reported associated symptoms  were  anxiety  (91.3%),  tinnitus  (50%),  obsessive-compulsive
disorder (41.6%), depression (33.3%),  and  hypersensitivity  to  sounds  (25%).

Resumo
Introduc ¸ão: A misofonia é  uma  condic ¸ão  recentemente  descrita,  mal  compreendida  e  ne-
gligenciada. É  caracterizada por fortes  reac¸ões  negativas  de  ódio,  raiva  ou  medo  quando  os
indivíduos precisam  enfrentar  alguns  sons  repetitivos  seletivos  e  de  baixa  intensidade.  Os  mais
comuns que  desencadeiam  tais  reac¸ões  aversivas  são  aqueles  provocados  pela  boca  (mascar
goma ou  mastigar  comida,  estalar  os  lábios)  ou  nariz  (respirando,  cheirando  e  soprando)  ou
pelos dedos  (digitando,  amassando  papel,  clicando  a  caneta,  tamborilando  na  mesa).  Artigos
anteriores citam que esses  indivíduos  geralmente  conhecem  pelo  menos  um  parente  próximo
com sintomas semelhantes, sugerindo  um  possível  componente  hereditário.
Objetivo: Encontramos e descrevemos uma  família  com  15  membros  com  misofonia,  detalhando
suas características comuns e o  padrão  de  sons  que  desencadeiam  um  desconforto  tão  forte.
Método: Todos os 15  membros  concordaram  em  nos  fornecer  seus  dados  epidemiológicos  e  12
concordaram em responder a um  questionário  especíﬁco  que  investigou  os  sintomas,  sons  de
gatilho especíﬁcos, principais sentimentos evocados e atitudes  adotadas  por  cada  participante.
Resultados:  Os 15 membros pertencem a  três  gerac¸ões  da  família.  A  idade  variou  de  9  a  73  anos
(média de 38,3 anos, mediana de 41  anos)  e  10  eram  mulheres.  A  análise  dos  12  questionários
mostrou  que 10 indivíduos (83,3%) desenvolveram os  primeiros  sintomas  durante  a  infância  ou
a adolescência.  A  média  do  escore  de  irritac ¸ão  na  Escala  Visual  Analógica  de  0  a  10  foi  de  7,3
(mediana 7,5).  Os  indivíduos  relataram  sentimentos  de  ódio/raiva,  irritabilidade  e  ansiedade  em
resposta a  sons,  e  enfrentaram  a  situac ¸ão  pedindo  para  interromper  o  som,  deixando/evitando  o
lugar e  até  mesmo  discutindo.  Os  sintomas  associados  auto-relatados  foram  ansiedade  (91,3%),
zumbido (50%),  transtorno  obsessivo-compulsivo  (41,6%),  depressão  (33,3%)  e  hipersensibilidade
aos sons  (25%).
Conclusão: A  alta  incidência  de  misofonia  nessa  distribuic ¸ão  familiar  em  particular  sugere  que
possa ser  mais  comum  do  que  o  esperado  e  suscita  a  possibilidade  de  haver  uma  etiologia

Introduction
Misophonia (miso  =  dislike;  phone  =  sounds)  is  unknown
among most  professionals  who  study  hearing.  Also  known
as Selective  Sound  Sensitivity  Syndrome  (4S),  it  applies  to
patients who  have  aversion  to  very  speciﬁc  sounds,  such
as chewing, breathing,  click  pen,  snapping  lips,  wheezing
etc.1 --- 6These are  usually  low  level,  but  repetitive  sounds,
causing the  individuals  a  strong,  sudden,  uncontrolled  and
disproportionate emotional reaction.
The causes  and  prevalence  of  misophonia  remain
unknown.3However ,  there  are  online  groups  with  thousands
of members  in  English,  Spanish  and  Portuguese,  suggesting
that it  may  be  bigger  than  established  by  research.
Misophonia sufferers  are  fully  aware  of  their  abnor-
mal reactions  to  sounds.3They  avoid  situations  wheresuch  particular  sounds  can  be  produced  and  consequently
have the  familial,  social  and  professional  interactions
severely limited.3Some  subjects  even  feel  themselves  as
‘‘ridiculous’’, but  they  cannot  overcome  the  problem  by
themselves. Patients  often  recognize  that  present  symptoms
started during childhood/adolescence.7
Misophonia  has  some  similarities  with  tinnitus,3which  is
an internal  sound  that  10- - -22%  individuals  perceive  in  the
ears or head.8- - -12Tinnitus  has  been  a  growing  phenomenon
worldwide, also reaching high prevalence  among  children
and adolescents,13,14which  is  the  age  range  that  misopho-
nia is  reported  to  start.  It  is  accepted  that,  if  tinnitus  is
associated with  a  negative  connotation,  the  connections
between auditory,  limbic  and  autonomic  systems  increase15
and cause  further  nuisance,  with  consequent  failure  of  the
spontaneous habituation  to  sounds.16This  mechanism  can

also  occur  with  the  external  sounds  that  characterize  miso-
phonia, suggesting  that  both  conditions  can  evoke  strong
reactions to  their  sound  triggers,  either  internal  (tinnitus)
or external  (misophonia).
Some patients  report  at  least  one  close  relative  with
similar symptoms  of  misophonia,  suggesting  a  possible
hereditary component.3The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  describe
a family  with  15  members  affected  by  misophonia,  their
behavioral characteristics  and  the  pattern  of  sounds  that
evoke such  unusual  and  strong  discomfort.
Methods
During the  routine  medical  consultation  of  a  patient  with
misophonia, she  reported  that  at  least  seven  other  family
members had  similar  symptoms.  She  and  her  family  were
invited to  participate  in  a  research  to  describe  their  cases.
Upon signing  the  written  consent  approved  by  the  Ethical
Committee (1458/15),  the  survey  was  conducted  through
a questionnaire  (Fig.  1),  and  the  interviews  were  taken  by
phone, email  or  skype  due  to  the  long  distance  of  their  cities.
Such individuals  indicated  other  family  members  with
similar symptoms, who  were  also  contacted  and  invited  to
participate under the same  conditions.  The  family  was  even-
tually characterized as presenting 15  members  affected  by
misophonia, who were  distributed  in  three  generations  in
the family  tree.  Among  them,  12  agreed  to  answer  the  whole
questionnaire.
We performed  descriptive  statistical  analysis  in  different
samples, according  to  the  speciﬁc  focus:  the  epidemiologicaldata  and  the  family  tree  included  all  the  15  subjects,  and
the data  about  the  questionnaire  included  the  12  subjects.
Results
Epidemiological data
Fig.  2  shows  the  genealogy  of  the  family  members.  The  age
ranged from  9  to  73  years  (mean  38.3  and  median  of  41
years), 10  (66.6%)  were  women  and  100%  were  Caucasians.
They live  in  3  different  Brazilian  cities:  Natal  (RN),  For-
taleza (CE)  and  São  Paulo  (SP).  Regarding  the  education
level, six  are  students,  one  is  trading,  and  eight  had  com-
plete superior  education  (two  administrators,  two  lawyers,
one engineer ,  one  psychologist,  one  businesswoman  and  one
university professor).
Questionnaire  data:  onset  of  symptoms  and
evolution
The  ﬁrst  symptoms  of  misophonia  started  at  the  age  2- - -33
years. By  adding  such  information  to  the  current  age  of  each
participant, the  duration  of  misophonia  corresponded  to  the
interval from  7  to  60  years  (mean  =  30  years;  median  =  30.5
years) (Fig.  3).
None of  them  had  previously  searched  for  treatment.  So,
the natural  evolution  over  time  showed  that  7  (58.3%)  sub-
jects feel  that  they  are  worsening,  3  (25%)  are  stable  and  2
(16.7%) had  spontaneous  improvement.

Selectivity  of  trigger  sounds,  feelings  and  attitudes
Fig.  4  shows  the  main  sounds  that  trigger  misophonia  in
our sample.  Fig.  5  shows  the  number  of  speciﬁc  sounds  per
person that  trigger  hatred,  anger  or  fear.
The main  feelings  involved  in  the  immediate  and  strong
emotional reactions  were  hatred  or  anger  (n  =  10;  83.3%),
irritability (n  =  3;  25%),  moodiness  (n  =  1;  8.3%),  discomfort
(n =  1;  8.3%),  and  anxiety  (n  =  1;  8.3%).
The strategies  used  to  face  the  hassle  include:  asking  to
stop the sound (n  =  9;  75%),  leaving  the  place  (n  =  8;  66.7%),
ﬁghting with the  persons  that  make  the  sound  (n  =  7;  58.3%).
Just one person tries  to  bear  silent  (n  =  1;  8.3%).
Impact on quality  of  life
When asked  about  whether  misophonia  hinder  their  social
or professional  life,  10  (83.3%)  answered  ‘‘sometimes’’,  and
2 (16.7%)  answered  ‘‘no’’.  Searching  speciﬁcally  whether
misophonia limits  their  freedom  to  go  to  places  where
the trigger  sounds  are  present  ---  which  seems  like  a  lim-
itation on  quality  of  life  ---  two  patients  answered  ‘‘always’’,

ﬁve answered ‘‘sometimes’’, and another ﬁve  answered
‘‘no’’.
We attempted  to  understand  why  such  speciﬁc  set  of
sounds is powerful enough  to  trigger  such  a  strong  emotional
reaction while most sounds are  not.  More  than  one  reason
was applied for some participants: for 4  (33.3%)  of  them,
the  possible explanation relies on  the  fact  that  such  sounds
distract  them  in  a  way  that  blow  their  concentration  away;
3 (25%)  subjects  attribute  the  annoyance  to  the  fact  that
such sounds  seem  impolite,  while  7  (58.3%)  think  that  such
sounds simply  irritate  them,  without  deﬁning  exactly  why.
According to  the  Visual  Analog  Scale,  the  discomfort  with
misophonia varied  from  5  to  10  (mean  =  7.3;  median  =  7.5)
(Fig.  6).

Discussion
As far  as  we  know,  there  is  no  report  about  familial
misophonia, although  the  issue  has  been  brieﬂy  discussed
previously.3,7The  predominance  of  women  with  misophonia
in this  family  is  in  agreement  with  other  studies.3,17Among
the 5  affected  women  who  have  had  children  (numbers  9,11,  13,  20,  22),  4  had  100%  of  their  children  with  misophonia
(numbers 11,  13,  20,  22).
Regarding the  age,  both  the  mean  (12.5  years)  and  the
median (12 years)  age  of  our  sample  correspond  to  the  tran-
sition between childhood  and  adolescence.  Other  studies
pointed to  the  beginning  of  misophonia  in  such  time.3,18This
was such  a  dominant  ﬁnding  in  our  sample  that  the  single
exception involves  the  female  number  9  (Fig.  2).
Of special  interest  is  the  nine  year-old  boy  (number
32), the  youngest  member  of  the  family,  who  started  his
symptoms at  the  age  of  2,  according  to  the  mother.  When
analyzing the  younger  generation  IV  (Fig.  2),  the  doubt  about
heredity versus environmental inﬂuence  is  easily  evoked:  in
this particular  case,  among four people  living  in  the  same
house when  he  was  born,  all  presented  misophonia  (his
mother and  two  sisters),  except  the  father.
The long  duration  of  symptoms  conﬁrms  that  misopho-
nia is  a  chronic  condition  with  no  tendency  to  spontaneous
improvement.
One of the  most  intriguing  factors  of  misophonia  is  the
great selectivity involving the  problem,  both  for  sounds
that trigger the hassle  as  for  the  people  who  make  the
sounds. Different from  patients  with  pure  hyperacusis,  usu-
ally pure misophonic subjects  do  not  feel  annoyed  by  loud
sounds, unless both disorders  coexist  in  the  same  sub-
ject. Misophonic patients have their  strong  and  sudden
emotional reaction triggered by low level,  but  repetitive
sounds.
Based on this, the main  trigger  sounds  were  those  related
to mouth movements (chewing  gum,  chew  food,  brushing
teeth, whistling, popping lips), nose (blowing  nose,  snor-
ing, other  people’s  breathing)  or  ﬁngers  (touching  paper
of candies/popcorn,  typing,  touching  cutlery,  clicking  pen).
Interesting to  say,  barking  was  commonly  included  in  the  list,
challenging the  deﬁnition  of  misophonia  for  those  who  claim
that only  human  sounds  evoke  the  disorder.18All  patients
mentioned at  least  ﬁve  common  sounds  that  evoke  strong
emotional reactions.
We also  investigated  whether  speciﬁc  people  caused
greater discomfort  than  other  people  producing  the  same
sounds. Half  the  participants  indicated  that  their  annoy-
ance with  sounds  is  greater  when  they  are  emitted  by  closely
related people  than  by  unknown.  This  particular  aspect  may
be related  to  the  type  of  relationship  that  each  member
of the  family  adopt  with  people  around  and  with  the  free-
dom that  participants  may  have  to  express  their  reactions
of hatred/anger/fear  in  front  of  known/unknown  persons.
For the  remaining  six,  the  trouble  does  not  depend  on  those
who produce  the  sounds.
Regarding associated  symptoms,  it  was  clear  that  miso-
phonia was  either  associated  to  otological/audiological
symptoms (tinnitus  and  hyperacusis)  and/or  psychiatric  ones
(anxiety, depression,  obsessive-compulsive  disorder).  This
led us to consider  that  such  affected  members  would  bene-
ﬁt to have an  extended  evaluation  composed  of:  (1)  hearing
exams,  such  as  pure  tone  audiometry,  Loudness  Discomfort
Levels (LDL),  otoacoustic  emissions  and,  whenever  tinnitus
is present,  the  tinnitus  pitch  and  loudness  matching;  (2)  psy-
chiatric and/or  psychological  interventions.  However ,  due  to
the long  distance  between  the  three  cities  where  all  the  par-
ticipants live,  it  was  not  possible  to  obtain  such  data.  Due  to
the same  reason,  the  presence  of  each  associated  symptom

was  assigned  by  each  patient  after  a  brief  explanation,  and
not diagnosed  by  a  professional.
None of the  participants  had  ever  sought  treatment  for
misophonia. This could represent the idea  that  misophonia
is  an  unknown  problem,  so  people  get  used  to  be  consid-
ered strange,  weird  or  cranky.  A  similar  result  was  previously
described,3in  which  just  2  out  of  11  patients  have  sought
treatment.
Such information  could  be  relevant  to  motivate  multi-
disciplinary effort  in  order  to  better  manage  this  disorder ,
including otolaryngologists,  audiologists,  pediatricians,  psy-
chiatrists and psychotherapists.
If 15  consanguineous  individuals report annoyance  to
quite similar sounds, we  wonder  whether misophonia would
be  hereditary  or  inﬂuenced  by  the  environment,  or  both.
Such numbers  would  favor  the  hypothesis  of  strong  heredi-
tary component.  Worth  to  know  is  the  spontaneous  written
comment on the  questionnaire  of  one  affected  women:  ‘‘this
has already become a characteristic  trace  of  the  Andrade
part of the family.  It  is  interesting  that  it  manifests  even
in the children who do  not  have  much  contact  with  the
rest of the family’’. On  the  other  hand,  most  participants
started to strongly react  to  sounds  when  they  were  children
or teenagers, and this could  have  been  learned  by  living  with
other affected members of the  family.
A certain trait which is statistically  linked  to  a  fam-
ily can be non-genetic, that is, transmitted  from  relatives
to  children through non-genetic pathways, but important
enough  to create a heredity pattern  quite  almost  infalli-
ble. This  is  particularly  important  for  the  characteristics
of human  behavior ,  which  can  misrepresent  the  ideas  on
the etiology  of  psychopathology,  making  us  believe  that
there are  genetic  causes  (and  therefore  organic  determi-
nants, biochemical  problems,  histological  changes)  where
there are  only  problems  in  the  psychological  domain.  Cul-
tural behavior  is  therefore  inherited  without  being  genetic,
and misophonia  could  be  a  learned  behavior  in  some
cases.
However , it  seems  reasonable  that  one  should  consider
that the  etiology  of  misophonia  may  include  the  concept  of
a continuum  of  possibilities  between  environmental  causes
and heredity.  If  we  admit  that  misophonia  in  this  family
is due  to  genetic  factors,  the  presence  of  the  phenotype
in three  generations  and  its  transmission  through  affected
males and  females  are  strongly  suggestive  of  autosomal
dominant inheritance.  However ,  the  description  of  similar
families and  a  systematic  investigation  of  family  history  in
a larger series  of  affected  individuals  would  be  necessary
to conﬁrm  the  role  of  genetic  factors  in  the  etiology  of
misophonia.
The incidence and  distribution  of  misophonia  among
these family members  led  the  researchers  to  suppose  that
the disorder  may  be  more  common  than  expected  and  likely
to have  autosomal  dominant  inheritance.  Further  research
on familial  misophonia,  including  twins,  are  welcome  to  con-
ﬁrm our  ﬁndings.
Conclusions
The  distribution  of  15  family  members  suffering  from  miso-
phonia and  its  transmission  through  affected  males  andfemales  strongly  suggests  that  this  disorder  may  have  an
autosomal dominant  inheritance.  Commonly  initiated  during
childhood and  adolescence,  the  strong  emotional  reac-
tions involve hatred  or  anger  to  sounds  and  most  patients
avoid going or  staying  in  places  where  such  sounds  are
present.
