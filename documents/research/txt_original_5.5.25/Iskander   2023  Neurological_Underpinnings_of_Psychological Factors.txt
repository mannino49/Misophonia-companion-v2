Peer Review: ORIGINAL RESEARCHABSTRACT
Several studies have suggested that 
misophonia should be categorized 
as an obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD) due to similar neural mani -
festations, such as impairments in 
limbic structures, and psychological 
features, such as perfectionism and 
disgust sensitivity. However, the two 
disorders may differ in the domains of 
disgust sensitivity. In OCD, the domain 
of pathogen disgust has been studied 
extensively as per the contamination 
subtype. In misophonia, pathogen 
disgust has not been reported. We hy -
pothesized that moral disgust may bet -
ter characterize individuals with miso -
phonia, as studies indicate that people 
with misophonia view their triggers as morally unacceptable. Furthermore, 
neuroimaging has shown anterior cin -
gulate cortex (ACC) activation particu -
larly during exposure to misophonic 
triggers, which is an area associated 
with moral assessment of stimuli. An -
other psychological factor that may 
point to the two disorders being dis -
crete is intolerance of uncertainty (IU), 
an aversion to undetermined events. 
IU has been well documented in OCD: 
It has been found to be positively as -
sociated with striatal volume and dys -
function in the ACC—both of which are 
common findings in OCD. We expected 
people with misophonia not to exhibit 
IU since they experience distress in re -
sponse to specific triggers and, unlike 
individuals with OCD, do not experi -ence preemptive anxiety. Multivari -
ate logistic regression analysis run on 
survey-gathered data revealed IU as a 
significant predictor of OCD symptoms 
and moral disgust as a significant pre -
dictor of misophonia. Consistent with 
our hypotheses, our findings suggest 
that IU and moral disgust and the asso -
ciated neural underpinnings differenti -
ate misophonia from OCD. [Psychiatr

Obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD) is a psychiatric disor -
der marked by disturbing, in -
trusive patterns of thought (obsessions) 
and repetitive actions or behaviors done 
in response to obsessions to decrease 
anxiety (compulsions such as checking, 
counting, touching, and arranging).1 
Functional and structural abnormalities 
have been investigated, with the literature 
widely implicating the cortico-striato-
thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit,2 which 
is associated with behavioral self-regu -
lation, habit learning, and reward-based 
learning,3,4 in OCD pathophysiol -
ogy. The CSTC circuit can be viewed 
in two pathways: 1) the direct pathway 
(ie, projections from the orbitofrontal 
cortex-striatum-internal globus pallidus-
thalamus-cortical), which is thought to 
be excitatory (positive-feedback loop, From City University of New York, Macaulay Honors College and Queens Col -

pathway (ie, projections from the dorso -
lateral prefrontal cortex-striatum-exter -
nal globus pallidus-subthalamic nucleus-
thalamus-cortical), which is inhibitory 
(negative feedback loop, inhibition of ac -
tions).4 The imbalance of both pathways 
is thought to result in a hyperactivated 
CSTC circuit, where the inhibitory path 
is unable to properly execute proper in -
hibitory control.5 The following have also 
been reported as key players in OCD 
pathophysiology: 
 ■The insula, which is involved in 
self-awareness, autonomic func -
tions, and emotional processing;6
 ■Amygdala, which is also involved in 
emotional processing; 
 ■The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), 
a region of the cingulate cortex re -
sponsible for emotional and conflict 
processing as well as error recogni -
tion;7
 ■Ventromedial prefrontal cortex 
(vmPFC) and dorsolateral pre -
frontal cortex (DLPFC), which are 
involved in flexible behavior and 
safety signaling;8,9
 ■Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which 
has been implicated in reward-
guided learning and symptom se -
verity;10,11
 ■Striatum activation and volume.12 
Gathered from neuroimaging data, 
individuals with OCD tend to exhibit 
impairments in executive functioning, 
emotional processing, and flexibility.13,14
Misophonia is a neurophysiologi -
cal disorder characterized by a dispro -
portionate negative emotional response 
to common sounds such as chewing, 
slurping, tapping, and pen clicking.15,16 
Autonomic response tends to accom -
pany emotional reactions, as exposure 
to triggering stimuli promotes increased 
sympathetic nervous system arousal.16,17 
Initially conceptualized by Jastreboff  
and Jastreboff, the term misophonia 
stemmed from early studies surrounding 
tinnitus and hyperacusis.18-20 Tinnitus describes one’s perception of auditory 
stimuli despite the absence of actual au -
ditory stimuli, where one may experi -
ence ringing in one or both ears, usually 
as the result of hearing loss.21 Hyperacu -
sis is used to refer to a heightened sensi -
tivity to noise, leading one to believe that 
noises are much louder than they are.22 
Yet, increasing neuroscientific studies 
point to the idea that misophonia is not 
guided by auditory track abnormalities, 
but rather by emotional neural networks, 
as indicated by the involvement of the 
insula, ACC, amygdala, and prefrontal 
cortical regions in the presentation of 
the disorder.23
Due to the resemblance in symp -
tomatology and neural manifestations 
between misophonia and OCD, some 
studies argue that misophonia should 
not be classed separately from OCD. The 
findings of Cusack et al. support the link 
between misophonia and OCD,24 with 
the authors suggesting misophonia car -
ries more of the obsessive than compul -
sive traits of OCD. When assessing three 
individuals with misophonia, Natalini et 
al.25 found that levels of perfectionism 
were elevated, consistent with an ob -
sessive-compulsive personality disorder. 
In the same vein, Jager et al.26 reported 
that 26% of the a misophonic sample 
presented with obsessive-compulsive 
personality traits, speculating that there 
is some connection between misophonia 
and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. 
Neurologically speaking, some research -
ers believe misophonia and OCD may 
share related neurocircuitry, that is, im -
pairments in limbic structures such as 
the amygdala and basal ganglia,10 where -
as others believe the overlap between the 
two disorders is due to dysfunction of 
the serotonergic and dopaminergic neu -
ral systems.27 Specifically, both OCD 
and misophonia exhibit hyperactivity in 
the insula and amygdala when exposed 
to triggers.23 Hyperactivity in the ACC 
has also been implicated in both OCD 
and misophonia, specifically in an error-processing task and trigger sound expo -
sure, respectively.23
Although the findings of these stud -
ies point out overlapping features, hall -
mark traits of OCD, such as compul -
sions and transdiagnostic factors, such 
as disgust sensitivity and intolerance 
of uncertainty (IU), have not been ob -
served to be significantly associated with 
misophonia. Further, recent neuroimag -
ing studies confirm the unique profile of 
misophonia, further supporting the dis -
tinction between OCD and misophonia. 
Activation of the midcingulate cortex 
(MCC) and the supplementary motor 
area (SMA) differs between the disor -
ders. More specifically, the MCC, in -
volved in motor and cognitive control,28 
has been found to be hyperactive in the 
presence of triggers in misophonia, as 
misophonic response to triggers is au -
tonomically driven, which may translate 
to reactionary behaviors.29 Conversely, 
in OCD, hypoactivity in the MCC was 
observed during symptom provocation, 
which some researchers speculate oc -
curs as a way to decrease anxiety.12 Dif-
ferences have also been observed in the 
SMA, which is associated with motor 
initiation/planning and inhibitory con -
trol.30 While hyperactivation has been 
reported in misophonia upon subjection 
to triggers,29 hypoactivation has been 
found in OCD during error-processing 
tasks.23 Therefore, while misophonia 
shares common psychological and neu -
rological traits with OCD, there are 
substantial differences that warrant the 
distinction between the two.
Disgust sensitivity has been reported 
in both OCD31,32 and misophonia.33,34 
Defined as a negative emotion that leads 
to repulsion and/or behavior avoidance,35 
disgust has come to be understood in the 
context of three domains: (1) pathogen-
based disgust (aversion toward patho -
gens/contaminants), (2) moral disgust 
(aversion toward moral offenses), and 
(3) sexual disgust (aversion toward in -
appropriate sexual behaviors).36 While,

572  Copyright © SLACK Incorporated
Peer Review: ORIGINAL RESEARCHgenerally, disgust has been implicated 
in both disorders, the domain of disgust 
may differ. Pathogen-based disgust has 
long been studied in OPD;37,38 however, 
moral disgust and sexual disgust have 
been understudied. In terms of miso -
phonia, although disgust sensitivity was 
found to be associated with emotional 
reactivity, no relation was found with 
pathogen-based disgust.33 The domains 
of moral or sexual disgust may be asso -
ciated with misophonia due to the po -
tential association with mental contami -
nation. As such, the domains of disgust 
may serve as a way to differentiate the 
two disorders.
Intolerance of uncertainty may also 
serve as a way to distinguish misophonia 
from OCD. IU refers to the aversion to 
uncertain situations that are character -
ized by negative emotional, cognitive, 
and behavioral reactions.39 IU has been 
implicated in various anxiety disorders 
such as social and general anxiety,40 as 
well as mood disorders such as depres -
sion.41 In the context of OCD, IU is 
considered the predictor of OC symp -
toms42 and influences symptom sever -
ity,43 making it an important factor to 
consider when discussing OCD traits. 
IU has yet to be explored in misopho -
nia, but we do not anticipate those with 
misophonia to exhibit IU as strongly as 
do individuals with OCD because, al -
though people with misophonia may ex -perience immediate distress in response 
to specific triggers, this distress would 
not be marked by preemptive anxiety or 
worry, as experienced by individuals with 
OCD. Thus, aversion would occur upon 
realizing the trigger, rather than antici -
pating one.
STUDY OBJECTIVE AND 
HYPOTHESES
With consideration of the findings 
mentioned, we aimed to determine 
which factors could help differentiate 
misophonia from OCD. We hypoth -
esized that IU and disgust sensitivity 
(pathogen, sexual, moral) would be dif -
ferentially associated with and predict 
OCD and misophonia symptoms. We 
also hypothesized that pathogen-based 
disgust and IU would be predictive of 
symptoms of OCD and that sexual and 
moral disgust would be predictive of 
symptoms of misophonia. Our model of 
the hypothesized relationships is shown 
in Figure 1.
METHOD
Participants
We recruited our sample from social 
media and crowdsourcing platforms. 
Inclusion criteria required participants 
to be at least 18 years of age and flu -
ent in English. Those over the age of 
65 and those not fluent in English were 
excluded.
Measures
Three-Domains of Disgust Scale. 
The Three-Domains of Disgust Scale 
(TDDS) is a 21-item self-report mea -
sure used to assess disgust sensitivity over 
three dimensions: pathogen, sexual, and 
moral.44 Sensitivity to each of the three 
dimensions is gauged by seven state -
ments. Pathogen-based disgust is char -
acterized by statements such as “Stand -
ing close to a person who has body odor.” 
Sexual disgust is characterized by state -
ments such as “Bringing someone you 
just met back to your room to have sex.” Moral disgust is characterized by state -
ments such as “Forging someone’s signa -
ture on a legal document.” Participants 
were asked to respond on a seven-point 
Likert scale ranging from 0 = not at all 
disgusting to 6 = extremely disgusting. 
The TDDS was found to have accept -
able reliability.44 In the current study, 
the Cronbach’s a for pathogen-based 
disgust, sexual disgust, and moral disgust 
were found to be 0.77, 0.80, and 0.86, 
respectively.
Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale. The 
Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS) 
is a 27-item self-report measure used 
to measure behavioral, emotional, and 
cognitive responses to undetermined 
situations.45 Participants were asked 
to indicate how they aligned with each 
statement (eg, “Uncertainty makes me 
uneasy, anxious, or stressed”), and their 
responses were based on a five-point 
Likert scale ranging from 0 = not at 
all characteristic of me to 4 = entirely 
characteristic of me. Ratings of items 
are summed, with higher scores corre -
sponding to greater IU. The English ad -
aptation of the IUS demonstrated high 
internal consistency, with a Cronbach’s 
a of 0.94.46 In the current study, the 
Cronbach’s a was 0.95, which also dem -
onstrates excellent internal consistency.
Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-
Revised. The Obsessive-Compulsive 
Inventory-Revised (OCI-R)47 is a revi -
sion of the 42-item Obsessive-Com -
pulsive Inventory,48 which consists of 
18 items assessing symptoms of OCD. 
OCI-R items are divided into six fac -
tors: (1) washing (eg, “I find it difficult to 
touch an object when I know it has been 
touched by strangers or certain people”); 
(2) obsessing (eg, “I find it difficult to 
control my own thoughts”); (3) hoarding 
(eg, “I have saved up so many things that 
they get in the way”); (4) ordering (eg, 
“I get upset if objects are not arranged 
properly”); (5) checking (eg, “I check 
things more often than necessary”); and 
(6) neutralizing (eg, “I feel compelled to

three items in each factor. Participants 
are asked to respond on a five-point Lik -
ert scale ranging from 0 = not at all to 4 = 
extremely. Rating of items are summed, 
with scores of 21 or higher indicating 
presence of OCD. The subscales along -
side the full scale have shown acceptable 
internal consistency, ranging from 0.81 
to 0.90 in a sample of patients seeking 
treatment for OCD symptoms. In the 
current study, Cronbach’s a was 0.95, in -
dicating excellent reliability.
New York Misophonia Scale. The 
New York Misophonia Scale (NYMS) 
is composed of two parts—the first as -
sessing emotional distress to misophonic 
triggers, and the second assessing aggres -
sive and nonaggressive responses to trig -
gers.33 The first part consists of 25 miso -
phonic triggers (eg, chewing loudly), and 
participants are asked to indicate how 
aversive each trigger is using a five-point 
Likert scale ranging from 0 = doesn’t 
bother me to 4 = disgusting. The second 
part consists of 13 behavior-based reac -
tions (eg, I cover my ears). Using a five-
point Likert scale, ranging from 0 = nev -
er to 4 = always, participants are asked 
to record how often they would respond 
with the behavior indicated to the trig -
gers in the first part of the NYMS. Par -
ticipants with scores two SDs above the 
mean were considered as having “high” 
misophonia, those with scores two SDs 
below the mean were categorized as 
“low,” and those falling between ±1 SD 
were considered “average.” In the current 
study, only those with high scores were 
considered. Cronbach’s a of the NYMS 
ranged from 0.85 to 0.94 for the total 
scale and its subscales, indicating good 
internal consistency. In the current study, 
the full scale reliability was found to be 
0.94.

The current study received approval 
from the Institutional Review Board of 
the City University of New York. The scales assessing the study variables, a

completed form consisted of 162 state -
ments divided into 5 sections and took 
approximately 15 minutes to complete. 
Data collection began in November 2021 
and concluded in February 2022.
Data Analysis
SPSS version 27.0 for Windows was 
used to conduct the data analysis on the 
collected responses. Beginning with the 
analysis, the means and SDs for all scales 
were calculated. The data were then as -
sessed for multivariate outliers using 
Mahalanobis distance, Cook’s distance, 
and Leverage, with one outlier emerg -
ing, which was discarded. Assumptions 
of additivity, normality, linearity, and ho -
mogeneity/homoscedasticity were also 
examined without violations emerging. 
All predictor variables were significantly correlated, and correlations were all un -
der 0.5. The 95% CI was calculated for 
all regression coefficients, and bootstrap -
ping with 5,000 bootstrapped samples 
within 95% of the CI was performed to 
assess the relevance of the indirect ef -
fects. The results were verified using bi -
nomial regression analysis.
RESULTS
Participants
A sample of 264 (59.5% female, 
33.0% male, 7.6% nonbinary) indi -
viduals between 18 and 65 years of 
age (mean = 28.6, SD = 9.5 years) was 
recruited. Most participants reported 
their race as white (73.5%), followed by 
Asian (9.5%), black or African Ameri -
can (3.4%), Hispanic or Latino (4.2%), 
and multiple races (6.4%). The majority 
(60.1%) of participants had obtained an 
associate’s degree, a bachelor’s degree, 
or a graduate degree. Most participants 
were either single and never married 
(49.2%) or married or in a relationship 
(47.0%), with the rest of the participants 
divorced or separated (3.4%). All demo -

Logistic Regression
Using cut-off scores for the OCI-R 
and NYMS, 59 participants were used 
in the logistic regression analysis. Re -

symptoms and average or below aver -
age misophonia symptoms ( n = 31) and 
those with high levels of misophonia and 
average or below average OCD symp -
toms ( n = 28) were placed in separate

with a multivariate analysis of variance 
revealing that the two groups differed 
significantly on IU ( P < 0.01) and moral 
disgust ( P < 0.01) (Table 3) . 
A bivariate logistic regression was 
performed to determine the contribu -
tions of IU, pathogen-based disgust, 
sexual disgust, and moral disgust to the 
likelihood of identifying the individual 
as having OCD. Each predictor vari -

ated with reduced likelihood of having

DISCUSSION
Consistent with our hypotheses, IU 
and moral disgust scores were able to pre -
dict OCD and misophonia, respectively. 
Our findings support the distinction 
between these disorders while lending 
credence to existing neuroscientific lit -
erature underpinning the processes that 
characterize IU and moral disgust. IU, 
initially thought to be a defining feature 
of generalized anxiety disorder,49 has 
since been found to play a role in various 
anxiety disorders, including OCD40,50,51 
and posttraumatic stress disorder.52,53 Of 
the studies examining the neural corre -
lates of IU, there seems to be a pattern 
in brain area involvement, with literature 
implicating the insula, amygdala, OFC, 
ACC, vmPFC, and DLPFC in IU. In -
terestingly, significant overlap exists 
between the areas implicated in IU and 
in OCD, providing a neurological back -
ing to the existing body of psychologi -
cal literature supporting the relationship 
between IU and OCD. Further, IU has 
been found to positively correlate with striatal volume, particularly in the puta -
men,54 as found in OCD,55 suggesting 
there is a link on not only a functional 
level but a structural level as well. IU has 
been especially noted in compulsions or 
ritualistic behavior,50,51,56 as heightened 
connectivity of the vmPFC and DLPFC 
results in impaired safety signaling, thus 
exacerbating compensatory behaviors. If 
a person fears they forgot to lock their 
front door before going to sleep, they 
may repeatedly check to make sure the 
door is locked. Thus, they respond to their fear of the uncertain (ie, whether 
the door is locked) by carrying out a 
compulsion, in this case the repeated 
checking of the lock, in an attempt to 
mitigate the anxiety and promote feel -
ings of safety. Through this logic, IU has 
been found to predict OCD symptom 
severity.57
As for misophonia, our belief that 
IU would not predict misophonia was 
supported by our results. This may be 
accounted for by recognizing just when 
anxiety is experienced by those with

tive resting state, as found in OCD.60
Disgust sensitivity is another fac -
tor that emerged as significant when 
attempting to distinguish the two dis -
orders. The three domains of disgust 
are extremely understudied in neuro -
scientific literature, and thus, literature 
surrounding the distinct neural regions 
each domain activates is scarce. How -
ever, the research that does exist sug -
gests that pathogen disgust and moral 
disgust have distinct neural activation. 
In a study conducted by Schaich Borg 
et al., when processing pathogen-based 
disgust stimuli, the main areas of activa -
tion included the left amygdala and the 
ventral orbito-frontal cortex.61 Because 
both areas have been thought of as cen -
tral players in OCD pathophysiology, 
the neural correlates of disgust line up 
with those found in OCD. Additionally, 
as contamination OCD is one of the 
more prevalent OCD subtypes, it is rea -
sonable that pathogen disgust emerged 
as significant, since the fear/avoidance of 
pathogens defines the subtype.62,63 An-
other explanation for OCD response to 
pathogen disgust may be derived from 
the concept of overestimation of threat, 
which is a key cognitive process in OCD 
in which individuals with OCD overes -
timate the potential for danger.64,65 As a 
result, when these individuals are faced 
with situations such as stepping in dog 
feces, they may believe they have some -
how exposed themselves to contamina -
tion, thus cycling into compulsions to offset the anxiety associated with the 
contamination-based obsession. People 
with misophonia do not exhibit the same 
overestimation of threat tendencies or 
worry-oriented mindsets that individu -
als with OCD do, perhaps explaining 
why pathogen disgust did not emerge 
as a significant predictor of misophonia. 
That is, misophonic triggers do not cen -
ter around the potential danger posed to 
the individual but rather around the an -
ger felt toward the perpetrator of the ac -
tion, as anger is a defining characteristic 
of misophonia.66
When disgust stimuli of moral con -
tent were processed, significant areas of 
activation included the medial prefrontal 
cortex and the areas around the tempo -
ro-partial junction, which are regions 
involved in the processing of moral 
stimuli61,67,68 and in the pathophysiology 
of misophonia.69 While there has not 
been a proposed neurological link be -
tween moral disgust and misophonia, we 
speculate that the feeling of disgust in 
those with misophonia may stem from 
anger, rather than worry, as observed in 
OCD. Participants in Edelstein et al.’s 
study reported that their triggers did not 
make them feel anxious; however, they 
did report they felt offended by trigger -
ing sounds, which would give rise to sen -
timents such as “I hate this person.”16 In 
this way, it is probable that moral disgust 
emerged as significant since misophonic 
responses to triggers include negative 
feelings toward the source of the trigger, 
rather than toward the trigger itself.
Although moral disgust has been ob -
served to play a role in OCD (mental 
contamination),70 we speculate it is not 
as significant a predictor as pathogen 
disgust since morality in OCD generally 
relates to the experience of the individ -
ual, rather than the judgment of others, 
where the individual often casts doubt 
on their own morality instead of passing 
judgment on the actions of others—an 
important defining characteristic be -
tween OCD and misophonia. It may also be that morality underscores the 
pathogen-based and sexual domains in 
misophonia as well, since the nature of 
the triggers may fall under a pathogenic 
or sexual label; however, the overall reac -
tion has less to do with the stimuli and 
more to do with the perceived morality 
of the source of the trigger.
CONCLUSION AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS
The findings of the current study call 
attention to several issues. First, the data 
collected from participants was self-re -
ported. Although screening was imple -
mented to reach the target demographic, 
self-report measures are not sufficient to 
conclude the distinction between these 
disorders. The sample of this study was 
small, meaning more participants are 
needed to confirm the relationship be -
tween IU, disgust sensitivity, OCD, and 
misophonia. Additionally, studies of the 
three domains of disgust and misopho -
nia are few, especially in the field of neu -
roscience, suggesting a need for more 
research on the subjects.
Future research may attempt to fur -
ther describe the relationship between 
OCD and misophonia, so the classifi -
cation of misophonia may be solidified. 
It is also worth noting that use of the 
TDDS limited our scope of pathogen, 
moral, and sexual disgust. Specifically, 
the statements describing moral disgust 
were limited to the immorality of others, 
leaving us unable to explore the possi -
bility of mental contamination in OCD. 
As such, a different direction to explore 
may examining OCD in the context 
of self-morality and misophonia in the 
context of the morality of others.
The neuroscience themes described 
in this article inform treatment planning 
for patients with OCD. The study results 
support recent literature71,72 detailing 
treatment possibilities for OCD that 
stray away from the conventional drug 
and behavioral treatment routes and 
move in the direction of translating ad -

Peer Review: ORIGINAL RESEARCHPSYCHIATRIC ANNALS  • Vol. 53, No. 12, 2023 577vances in neuroscience research to effec -
tive OCD neurotherapeutics that target 
the neurobiological alterations involved 
in psychiatric symptoms. Evidence of 
this can be found in studies where re -
searchers report positive results when ad -
ministering high-frequency brain stimu -
lation (reduced OFC, PFC, and ACC 
activation)73 and transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (reduced PFC and ACC ac -
tivation.)74 Such findings indicate that 
addressing the hyperactive CSTC circuit, 
as well as the neural correlates of IU, may 
mitigate OCD symptom severity.
As for misophonia, existing treat -
ment methods are especially limited due 
to the narrow scope of research on the 
topic. Treatment of misophonia predom -
inately involves psychotherapy.75 Find -
ings of this study suggest there are key 
brain regions that influence the presence 
and severity of misophonia symptoms; 
these must be further studied to develop 
new treatment options. Viewing disgust 
through the lens of anger in those with 
misophonia, rather than worry as typi -
cally expressed in individuals with OCD, 
may also be beneficial in psychothera -
peutic and pharmacological spheres.
