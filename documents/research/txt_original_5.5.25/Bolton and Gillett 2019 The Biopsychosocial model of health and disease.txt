## Preface

The problem area of this essay is set within a broad trend of increasing recognition  that  crossdisciplinary  approaches  are  needed  for  addressing the aetiology, prevention and management of diseases. The recognition of this need goes by the name of the 'biopsychosocial model', originally proposed  by  the  physician  and  psychoanalyst  George  Engel  in  a  paper published in 1977. By now, some 40 years on, the model has a reasonable  claim  to  be  the  overarching  framework  for  medicine  and  healthcare, invoked in clinical and health educational settings the world over. Notwithstanding  its  popularity,  however,  the  biopsychosocial  model has come to be seen as intellectually deficient. Recent commentary sees the  biopsychosocial  model  as  being  handwaving,  vague,  lacking  scientific  validity and philosophical coherence. That the aspiring overarching framework of medicine is apparently at the same time so radically flawed signals a substantial problem in the conceptual foundations of contemporary medicine and healthcare. This is the problem we address in this book.  We  aim  to  articulate  a  clear  biopsychosocial  model,  drawing  on Engel's original, but updating it in the light of substantial developments in  the  sciences  and  philosophy  in  the  past  few  decades.  While  the  task is  focussed  on  the  health  sciences,  it  is  set  within  the  wider  context  of crossdisciplinary  theory,  research  and  problem-solving  in  contemporary life and human sciences.

Much evidence has emerged in the health sciences over the past few decades of psychosocial as well as biological factors being implicated in the  aetiology,  prognosis  and  clinical  management  of  health  conditions.

Typically the relative involvement of the various kinds of factor depends on the specific condition, and on stage of condition. The biopsychosocial  model  has  stood  ready  to  accommodate  this  emerging  evidence,  a convenient  depositary,  but  the  conceptual  task  of  clarifying  the  model appropriate  for  this  new  evidence  is  challenging.  The  conceptual  challenge, recognised by Engel and contemporary commentary, is that there are  historically deeply  entrenched  assumptions-physicalism,  dualism and reductionism-to the effect that only material, physical and chemical causes are real, while distinctive psychological causes and social causes are  impossible  or  incomprehensible.  Against  this  background,  the  task of theorising biopsychosocial causal interactions in health and disease is non-trivial. The result we intend however is a model that can recognise psychological and social factors as being as real and as causal as muscle strength, biochemical reactions, molecular genes or brain circuitry.

Our methodology is to work with concepts and principles worked out in the sciences, but those of a fundamental theoretical status that borders into  the  'philosophical'  or  even  'metaphysical'.  These  latter  terms  capture the idea that core scientific theory is not just accumulated data, but rather guides empirical research and interprets its findings. Core theory has  an a  priori quality,  though  in  the  context  of  shifting  patterns  and paradigms of knowledge, not absolute. What we customarily think of as philosophy on the other hand, and science on the other, merge together in  the  philosophical  core  of  scientific  theory.  This  was  so  in  the  mechanisation  of  the  world-picture,  which  combined  revolutionary  science with ontological statements as to the primary causal qualities of nature, assigning cognition to an immaterial status with no or inexplicable causal power. In the radical  changes  that  have  been  occurring  in  the  life  and human sciences over the past few decades we find new concepts, ontology and principles  of  change  that  do  not  so  much  solve  old  problems as disregard the terms in which they were constructed. for example the new models in cognitive neuroscience of embodied and embedded cognition replace the old mind/body dualism and its associated problems. New biological  research  programmes  on  genetic  regulatory  control  of cellular  metabolic  processes  complement  but  exceed  the  physical  laws governing  energy  exchanges  in  making  and  breaking  chemical  bonds, hence  effortlessly,  as  it  were,  circumventing  the  old  idea  that  physics and chemistry say all there is to be said about causation. In short, the conceptual apparatus needed to theorise biology as involving a distinctive  form  of  causation,  and  cognitive  processes  as  biological,  as  well  as

in interaction with the environment, natural and social-is already in the science,  as  work  in  progress,  and  our  purpose  here  is  only  to  organise some key concepts and principles into a short core theory suitable for the biopsychosocial model of health, disease and healthcare. This core theory involves new concepts and models in the health sciences, such as those implicating chronic stress as a key mechanism linking adverse psychosocial factors to poor health outcomes.

The  authors  have  mixed  disciplinary  backgrounds-DB  in  philosophy  and  clinical  psychology;  GG  in  medicine,  neurosurgery,  philosophy and bioethics. We have written this following many years of clinical experience,  research  and  theorising.  Biopsychosocial  problem-solving  is trans-disciplinary-the theory breaks down traditional boundaries.

## CHAPTER 1

## The Biopsychosocial Model 40 Years On

Abstract The  first  chapter  outlines  George  Engel's  proposal  of  a  new biopsychosocial  model  for  medicine  and  healthcare  in  papers  40 years ago  and  reviews  its  current  status.  The  model  is  popular  and  much invoked  in  clinical  and  health  education  settings  and  has  claim  to  be the  overarching  framework  for  contemporary  healthcare.  On  the  other hand,  the  model  has  been  increasingly  criticised  for  being  vague,  useless,  and  even  incoherent-clinically,  scientifically  and  philosophically. The combination of  these  two  points  signifies  something  of  a  crisis  in the conceptual foundations of medicine and healthcare. We outline some of  the  emerging  evidence  implicating  psychosocial  as  well  as  biological factors in health and disease, and propose the following solution to the vagueness problem: that the scientific and clinical content of the model relates  to  specific  conditions  and  stages  of  conditions,  so  that  there  is, for example, a biopsychosocial model of cardiovascular disease, diabetes or depression. Much the same point applies to the narrower biomedical model. However this raises the question: what is the point of having a general model? Our response is that it is needed to theorise biopsychosocial interactions in health and disease. In the light of historical prejudices against  psychosocial  causation  deriving  from  physicalist  reductionism and  dualism,  recognised  by  Engel  and  current  commentators  on  the biopsychosocial model, this is a non-trivial task that occupies subsequent chapters.

## Engel's Proposed Improvement on the Biomedical Model

In  his  classic  paper  published  in  1977  George  Engel  proposed  a  new model  for  medicine,  the  biopsychosocial  model,  contrasted  with  the existing biomedical model [1]. While recognising the great advances in biomedicine, Engel argued that nevertheless the biomedical model was limited, and insufficient for many aspects of medical science and healthcare. These limitations were extensive, comprising failure to take account of the following: the person who has the illness, the person's experience of,  account  of  and  attitude  towards  the  illness;  whether  the  person  or others  in  fact  regard  the  condition  as  an  illness;  care  of  the  patient  as a  person;  for  some  conditions  such  as  schizophrenia  and  diabetes,  the effect  of  conditions  of  living  on  onset,  presentation  and  course;  and finally,  the  healthcare  system  itself  also  cannot  be  conceptualised  solely in  biomedical  terms  but  rather  involves  social  factors  such  as  professionalisation ([1], pp. 131-135). Engel argued that a broadening of the biomedical approach, a new biopsychosocial model, was needed to take account of all these factors 'contributing to both illness and patienthood' ([1], p. 133).

## The Presumed 'Overarching Framework'

In his review of a recent book on the biopsychosocial model by Nassir Ghaemi  [2],  in The  American  Journal  of  Psychiatry ,  Kenneth  Kendler starts  with  the  sentence:  'This  book  is  about  a  very  important  topicthe  overarching  conceptual  framework  of  our  field  of  psychiatry'  ([3], p. 999).

Whether the biopsychosocial model has this status for the rest of medicine is less clear, given the prominence of biomedicine and its biomedical model. Nevertheless, 'the rest of medicine' is not one thing, and the various  medical  specialities  differ  in  their  relative  involvement  with  the biological, the psychological and the social. Primary care, also known as general practice or family medicine, is well-known to be much involved

in  psychological  and  social  factors,  and  another  clear  example  is  public health. The relevant contrast here is with biomedicine, but biomedicine is  not  itself  a  medical  speciality,  but  a  particular  kind  of  biological  science-based  medicine  that  can  be  applied  across  medical  specialities,  in some more than in others. Although Engel starts his paper referring to the 'medical model', he soon switches to 'biomedical model' and this is the term he uses for the contrast with his new proposed 'biopsychosocial model'. In short it is not only psychiatry but also all the other non-biomedical aspects of medicine and its specialities that apparently require the broader biopsychosocial model.

We will review some of the health science suggesting the need for a biopsychosocial model in the next section, but first let us consider some current major trends in health, disease and healthcare that point to the same conclusion.

Engel was primarily concerned with psychosocial aspects of managing illness within hospitals, complementing the biomedical approach in hospital care. The example he discussed in detail in his 1980 'clinical applications' paper was of myocardial infarction [4]. However, it has become clear  in  the  intervening  decades  that  managing illnesses in hospital is a particular  and  expensive  way  of  providing  healthcare.  Illness  severe enough to require hospital admission has high burden of suffering and disability,  and  high  costs  of  hospital  care,  including  biomedical  investigations  and  treatments.  It  would  be  better  all  round  to  prevent  illness altogether, or to detect and manage it earlier to prevent worsening, and also better to provide community and social care where possible to avoid or shorten hospital admissions. Implementing this last strategy involves practical psychological and social factors, such as availability of social supports or social care. The first two strategies, primary and secondary prevention, interact with psychosocial factors such as lifestyle, social capital and health literacy.

At the same time the importance of many of the areas of neglect that Engel  conveniently  listed  under  one  heading-as  shortcomings  of  the biomedical model-have been ratcheted up by diverse trends including socio-cultural  changes,  economics  and  globalisation.  The  voice  of  the service user has gained strength from civil rights and general emancipatory social changes; rising costs of healthcare in economically developed countries have focussed minds on containing costs by service reorganisations of diverse kinds; health has become globalised in many ways, such as  improving  health  services  in  economically  developing  countries,  or

in  the  need  for  international  policy  to  manage  epidemics that can now spread more rapidly worldwide.

Other trends since Engel wrote that have also broadened the focus to include more than the biomedical model have to do with changing patterns of population health. Among the greatest achievements of biomedicine  have  been  the  identification,  treatment  and  control  of  infectious diseases. However, and connected, the current burden of ill health in the population now includes many conditions that are not infectious diseases and which have no available complete cure-the so-called non-infectious diseases (NCDs), sometimes also called long-term conditions (LTCs)such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, recurrent depression and schizophrenia. In addition, as people live longer, for many reasons including biomedical advances, the proportion of the elderly increases, especially in the absence of immigration, and care of the elderly in hospital accounts for a high proportion of healthcare costs. In short, what biomedicine is good at no longer solves a large  part  of  the  population  health  burden and costs, and can contribute to rising costs by keeping us alive longer (thank you at a personal level) but at great expense-to someone, especially the younger generations. What is needed to theorise all these developments is much more complicated than biomedicine or the biomedical model were ever designed for. As well as biomedicine, what is needed is a complex mix of social science, politics, economics, environmental and social epidemiology and psychology-and no doubt more scientific specialities under development.

A  further  development  in  the  decades  since  Engel's  papers  that  has added overwhelming weight to the case for a model that can encompass biological, psychological and social factors has been accelerating research on  the  causes  of  illness,  the  basis  for  primary  prevention.  The  recent research,  to  be  reviewed  briefly  in  the  next  section,  makes  two  things clear: first,  that for many diseases, causes or risks are present from very early  on,  and  second,  that  for  many  these  causes  or  risks  are  combinations of biological, psychological and social. Prospective epidemiological studies suggest that risks for many major illnesses, physical and mental, start  early  in  development,  many  in  childhood,  and  that  risks  include social  factors such  as  poverty  and  other  forms of social exclusion, some specific family level factors such as neglect and abuse, and life -style factors such as exercise and diet. findings on what have come to be called 'social determinants of health' were summarised and publicised for example by Michael Marmot in his 2010 Strategic Review of Health Inequalities in

England [5]. At the same time, but proceeding largely separately, there have been rapid advances in genetics. Over the past few decades many physical and mental health conditions have been found to have a genetic risk-and genetic risk starts from conception, and interacts with non-genetic factors including but not limited to psychosocial factors of the sort identified in the social epidemiological literature. In short, these sciences combined  have  produced  a  whole  new  dimension  of  the  claim  of  the biopsychosocial model that conditions of living-as well as biological factors-may affect the onset, presentation and course of an illness.

for  all  these  various  kinds  of  reasons,  since  Engel  wrote  his  papers some 40 years ago, the biopsychosocial model has become the orthodox overarching  model  for  health,  disease  and  healthcare.  It  is  much  cited and taught in healthcare trainings of all sorts and in workshops and ward rounds the world over. In simple terms it recommends to healthcare to take into account all three aspects, the biological, the psychological and the social. It is particularly useful in psychology and social work healthcare  professions,  and  in  medical  practice  that  has  to  deal  with  the  psychological and the social as much as the biomedical, primary care (family medicine) being the clearest example [6], and in-hospital medical training  that  emphasises  the  importance  of  a  comprehensive  management plan. In all these contexts the biopsychosocial model easily wins, facilitating identification and integration of different aspects of care aimed at different aspects of the patient's life, disease and management. To illustrate further good fit with much current practice, the biopsychosocial model obviously aligns with the rationale of multidisciplinary teams, and with the increasing recognition of the value of the service user's views in providing good and effective healthcare.

Given the prominent status and use of the biopsychosocial model, it is clearly of great importance that the model is clear and robust. At this point, however, there is a very large problem, because there have been increasing charges in the medical literature that in fact the biopsychosocial model-popular and accommodating as it may be-is far from being clear and robust, but is in fact deeply flawed.

## But Lacks Content, Validity and Coherence

Engel's  biopsychosocial  model  has  long  been  criticised  for  having  various kinds  of limitation, along  with  suggestions  for  improvements (e.g. [7-9]). Increasingly, however,  there have been  more  radical

criticisms.  Such  radical  criticisms  are  of  two  main  types:  first,  that  the model lacks specific content , is too general and vague ; and second, that it lacks scientific validity and philosophical coherence. Given the popularity of the biopsychosocial model and its presumed status as overarching framework for  medicine  and  healthcare,  such  radical  criticisms  signal  significant underlying theory problems.

The first broad heading of criticism is well argued by Nassir Ghaemi, a psychiatrist at Tufts, in his 2010 book with the telling title: ' The Rise and Fall of the Biopsychosocial Model ' [2]. Ghaemi argues that the model is  vague,  too  general,  tells  us  nothing  specific  of  value,  hence  is  inefficient and sometimes distracting; it 'gives mental health professionals permission to do everything but no specific guidance to do anything' ([2], p. 82). The way Ghaemi tells the story, the biopsychosocial model arose in the context of competing general views about illness, favouring one or other of the social, the psychological/psychoanalytic and the biological. These general views-one might call them ideologies without criticismwere  views  of  the  whole  domain  of  illness,  offering  general  accounts, discriminating  not  much  between  kinds  of  case  to  which  they  applied and kinds of case to which they did not. Ghaemi interprets the biopsychosocial model as an elegant-if problematic and ultimately unviablesolution to these ideological conflicts: the unseemly turf wars could be ended, a truce could be declared, if all the participants won, if they were not really in opposition at all, but were in fact all true general accounts of illness and healthcare in all their aspects. The problem whether the cause of illness, and hence in theory its prevention and treatment, is biological, psychological or social is solved, because the answer is 'all three' ([10], p. 3; [2], ch. 6).

It  has  to  be  said  that  this  line  of  thought  is  not  apparent in Engel's main  papers  [1,  4].  Ghaemi  does  however  quote  a  characterisation  of the  biopsychosocial  model  from  another  of  Engel's  papers  consistent with  presumed  generality:  'all  three  levels,  biological,  psychological, and social, must be taken into account in every health care task' ([11], p. 164; [10], p. 3). This claim Ghaemi understands as meaning that the three levels 'are all, more or less equally, relevant, in all cases, at all times' ([10], p. 3). In these quotes one can see the point of the allegations that the biopsychosocial model is a slogan, too vague to be of any use. And moreover, when pinned down, more than likely just wrong, counter-evidenced exactly by the successes of biomedicine, in which biological factors  alone  adequately  explain  diseases  and  treatments,  such  as  bacterial

infections and anti-biotics cures. Effective biomedicine is an anomaly for any  general  claim  to  the  effect  that  'everything  is  biopsychosocial',  an obvious point that warrants repetition (e.g. [2, 12]).

So, the charge is that the biopsychosocial model is vague without specific content. If, on the other hand, the model is firmed up to a very general proposition about the general relevance of all three kinds of factors, it is likely to be just false, exactly because of biomedicine. faced with this obvious enough fact, a possible move is retreat to vagueness, but at the cost of content, as highlighted increasingly by critical commentary.

As  mentioned  above  when  illustrating  the  current  important  status or  aspirations  of  the  biopsychosocial  model,  Kenneth  Kendler  opens his  review of Nassir Ghaemi's book with the statement that its topic is very  important,  the  overarching  conceptual  framework  of  psychiatry ([3], p. 999). In his review Kendler goes on to quote Ghaemi's negative conclusion, 'The BPS model has never been a scientific model or even a philosophically coherent model. It was a slogan…' ([2], p. 213), and comments: 'While the reader may think this a little harsh…, I think he is  substantially  correct  in  this  assessment'  ([3],  p.  999).  On  the  other hand, Kendler ends his review with a reminder of the importance of the biopsychosocial model as a teaching tool in family medicine, concluding: 'While I agree with Ghaemi that the Biopsychosocial model has been a failure  as  a  scientific  paradigm,  it  probably  continues  to  serve  a  useful clinical and teaching function in psychiatry and medicine' ([3], p. 999). Kendler correctly identifies the major tension here: the biopsychosocial model is a useful tool for clinical and teaching functions, but apparently lacks scientific validity and philosophical coherence.

But then probably all cannot be problem free on the teaching front either.  Here  is  Chris  McManus,  Professor  of  Psychology  and  Medical Education  at  University  College  London,  reviewing  an  earlier  edited book on biopsychosocial medicine in The Lancet ([13], p. 2169):

Biopsychosocial  medicine's  challenge  is  to  transcend  the  vague,  aspirational inclusivity of its name, and to create a model that truly merits being called a model, and is properly explanatory and predictive … Arm-waving and the inclusion of everything ultimately says and does little of practical consequence.

Ghaemi,  Kendler  and  McManus  all  basically  agree  in  their  negative assessments of the biopsychosocial model.

Given the popularity of the biopsychosocial model, its use in teaching and the clinic, its presumed status as the overarching framework for psychiatry  and  perhaps  for  medicine  generally,  such  authoritative  negative assessment signals significant problems at the conceptual foundations.

We  believe  that  these  two  kinds  of  charge  put  to  the  biopsychosocial model, querying its content, validity and coherence, are cogent, but can be met. What they signal is not the end of the model-witness the fact that it persists, for good reasons already indicated-but the need to rethink and reinvigorate it. The answer to the content problem, we suggest, is that the content lies in scientific and clinical specifics , not generalities. This is proposed in the next section, beginning with a brief review of  the  emerging  basic  and  clinical  science  supporting  the  biopsychosocial model. This response to the content problem, however, immediately raises  the  question:  if  the  content  of  the  biopsychosocial  model  lies  in specifics,  what  is  the  point  of  the  general  model?  We  suggest  that  this question  relates  to  core  scientific  theory,  at  the  place  where  it  merges into philosophy, and is therefore here that the problem of scientific validity and philosophical coherence is to be addressed. We define this problem in Sect. 1.3, and address it in detail through subsequent chapters.

## 1.2 locating the content of the bioPsychosocial model

## Emerging Evidence of Psychosocial Causation

Just as the biomedical model is of interest because of the substantial and well-established  evidence  base  of  biomedicine,  so  the  biopsychosocial model warrants attention insofar as there is evidence of psychological and social as well as biological factors in health and disease. There has been an accumulation of such evidence in recent decades, and before moving the main theoretical argument forwards, we pause to review some of it.

This  review  carries  a  health  warning!  It  is  uncritical  and  unsystematic; we have usually not distinguished strength of evidence of the studies cited below (uncontrolled to randomised controlled and replicated), nor  commented  on  other  aspects  of  methodological  strengths  (such as  sampling  strategies  and  sample  size),  nor  on  conflicting  and  uncertain  results,  nor  have  we  employed  a  systematic  literature  search  strategy. Many of the papers cited are reviews, more or less systematic. The purpose here is only to orientate the unfamiliar reader to wide range of

research that has supported on-going interest in the interplay of biological, psychological and social factors in health and disease and hence the biopsychosocial model.

Over  the  past  few  decades  the  picture  that  has  emerged  for  causes of  disease  onset,  especially  for  the  non-communicable  diseases,  also known as the LTCs, is one of complex, multifactorial causation, involving  many  risk  factors  of  relatively  small  effect,  affecting  multiple  outcomes. The recent research on social factors as causes or risks for poor health-the  so-called  'social  determinants  of  health'-is  probably  the most well-known,  new  face  validation  of  the  need  for  a  broad  biopsychosocial  model.  Among  the  most  influential  social  epidemiological research programmes are the Whitehall Studies of British civil servants, led  by  Michael  Marmot  [14-16].  These  longitudinal  cohort  studies found robust correlations between variance in incidence for a wide range of health conditions-coronary heart disease, premature mortality, some cancers, lung disease, gastrointestinal  disease,  depression,  suicide, sickness  absence,  back  pain  and  general  feelings  of  ill-health-and  civil service  grade.  The  social  gradient  in  health-the  correlation  between indices  of  social  status  and  health  outcomes-is  now  well-established; much is now known about the social determinants of health [17, 18], and something like the biopsychosocial model has to be invoked in order to  comprehend  it.  As  typically  for  epidemiology,  most  findings  on  the social  gradient  in  health  come  from  association  studies  only,  retrospective or prospective. Establishing causation is more complex, using such as controlled cohort studies, natural experiments or animal models.

Other large research programmes have investigated associations  between  adverse  psychosocial  exposure  in  childhood  and  later health  outcomes.  A  landmark  programme  is  the  Adverse  Childhood Experiences  Study  (ACE  Study)  in  the  United  States,  carried  out  by Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The  ACE  study  has  demonstrated  associations  between  adverse  childhood experiences, such as physical and emotional neglect and abuse, and a large range of physical as well as mental health outcomes (e.g. [19]).

Lifestyle  factors,  comprising  behaviours  and  associated  beliefs,  attitudes and values, have been increasingly implicated as risks, or conversely as  protective  factors,  for  a  wide  range  of  physical  health  conditions [14,  18].  for  example  risk  factors  for  some  cancers  and  cardiovascular disease include such as smoking, alcohol use, diet, exercise and chronic stress. Lifestyle factors can be covered under the same heading as social

factors,  or  separately.  Either  way,  lifestyle  factors  interact  strongly  with social  context,  reflecting  Engel's  insight  that  the  person  is  essentially within  a  social  context:  diet  for  example,  depends  to  some  extent  on choice, but also on what is available and affordable; stress-to be considered in Chapter 4-depends on individual characteristics but also on task demands and available resources.

Lifestyle and psychological factors can be distinguished: the   former are  behavioural,  while  the  latter,  such  as  beliefs,  attitudes  and    values, are  mental.  At  the  same  time  they  are  closely  linked.  One  reason  is that  psychological  factors  motivate  lifestyle,  but  there  is  also  a  general  linkage  between  our  psychology  and  our  behaviour,  namely,  that we respond to reality at it appears to us, at any given time, to be. We pick  this  up  as  a  theoretical  point  in  more  detail  later,  in  Chapter  3 (Sect. 3.1,  heading  'Mind  Is  Embodied').  In  the  present  context  it appears in evidence suggesting that it is not objectively measured social status  but social  status  as  perceived ,  so-called  'subjective  social  status' that  accounts  for  more  of  the  variance  in  health  outcomes  (see  e.g. [20, 21]). This interesting finding becomes part of the complex jigsaw uzzle of biopsychosocial aetiology. p

Over  the  same  past  few  decades  that  evidence  for  psychosocial  factors in health and disease has been accumulating, so also has evidence of genetic effects. for some health conditions such as Huntington's chorea, and some cancers, there are massive genetic effects, but for the majority of health conditions, the proportion of population variance attributable to genetic influence is much less than 100%, the picture being rather of relatively small effects of multiple genes, with the remaining variance attributable  to  non-genetic,  environmental  factors.  Combining  these broad  kinds  of  research  programmes  presents  a  biological-psychological-social and-environmental picture, and new epigenetics is likely to help explain how the various kinds of factor interact. These issues are taken up in Chapter 3, Sect. 3.4.

Post-onset  course  of  disease  raises  different  causal  questions:  what are  the  processes  determining  course,  for  example,  progression,  stability, fluctuation or recovery? Treatment effects are a special case, assessed using  a  range  of  designs  including  randomised  controlled  trials.  There has been accumulating evidence from randomised controlled treatment trials  since  the  late  1970s of treatment effects of psychosocial interventions  on  some  mental  health  conditions.  Among  the  first  was  a  randomised  controlled  trial  of  cognitive  behaviour  therapy  for  depression

published  by  Beck  et al.  [22]  showing  effectiveness,  but  further,  the same effectiveness  as  for  anti-depressant  medication.  In  effect  this  trial showed that a psychological intervention could achieve the same result as a biomedical intervention, and it paved the way for accelerating developments of tested psychological treatments for a wide range of mental health  conditions  and  the  translation  of  these  into  national  health  service provisions. There are complications, as always, for example, as to the extent to which psychological therapy outperforms pill placebo control, but  the  principle  that  some  psychotherapies  help  some  mental  health conditions has been established (e.g. [23]).

The position is different with physical illnesses. Put strongly, there is a glaring gap in the evidence for the biopsychosocial picture as a whole, namely, absence of persuasive evidence of psychosocial treatment effects on the  course  of  major  physical  illnesses.  There  is  no  clinical  trial  that finds  effects  of  psychological  therapy  on  physical  illnesses  such  as,  say, diabetes,  cancers,  cholera  or  advanced  cardiovascular  disease.  We  just wish to make the point that no psychotherapy or any other kind of psychosocial  intervention  turns  around  such  disease  processes  once  established,  and  this  is  a  major  apparent  fact  that  needs  to  be  taken  into account  in  discussing  the  relative  merits  of  the  biomedical  model  and the broader biopsychosocial model. This is linked to the fact that for the many conditions that are managed biomedically in acute hospitals, successfully in some cases, there need be no special interest in the broader biopsychosocial  model,  and  any  advocate  of  the  broader  model  has  to accommodate  the  fact  that  whatever  other  significant  roles  they  may have, psychosocial factors apparently make no difference to the course or treatment of major physical illnesses.

That said-and we intend it to be a big that -there is emerging evidence  that  psychosocial  factors  may  be  implicated  in  the  prognosis  of some among the very large range of medical conditions.  for  example: breast  cancer  (e.g.  [24]),  atopic  disease,  generally  [25],  including  for asthma  [26];  HIV  [27-29]  and  musculoskeletal  disorders  (e.g.  [30]). In  addition,  psychosocial  factors  have  been  implicated  in  outcomes  of surgical  procedures,  for  example,  chronic  pain  [31];  lumbar  and  spinal  surgery  [32-38];  liver  transplant  (e.g.  [39])  and  coronary  artery bypass  (e.g.  [40-42]).  In  addition,  there  is  evidence  for  psychosocial factors in wound healing [43, 44], and extent of fatigue after traumatic brain  injury  [45].  Psychosocial  factors  have  also  been  implicated  in responses to other interventions for medical conditions, such as inpatient

rehabilitation for stroke patients (e.g. [46]), and effects of hospitalisation on older patients (e.g. [47]).

Reference  to  psychosocial  factors  affecting  course  of  medical  and post-surgical conditions is not intended to be read as either conclusive or general. Many studies on this general topic are of associations only, and there are many mixed results. Hence the subtitle of this section, 'emerging  evidence',  and  the  explicit  qualification  of  specificity  to  particular conditions and stages. further, absence of reports of psychosocial effects on medical conditions, while it may suggest simply that the research has not yet been done, may also indicate that results have been negative and unpublished, and further back in the clinical research sequence, that clinicians  have  not  seen  evidence  warranting  case  study  research  reports, progressing to cohort studies, and so on. This takes us back to the point made first, that some major medical conditions, such as the primary dysfunction  in  diabetes,  or  advanced  cancers,  or  advanced  cardiovascular disease, appear to be influenced exclusively by biological factors, impenetrable to psychosocial processes and interventions, and in some cases also unresponsive to biological interventions.

An old-fashioned way of making this point is to say that the mind cannot control biological processes such as abnormal cell growth. In the old dualist  framework,  however,  the  mind  couldn't  really  control  anything material, not cell growth, but not arms and legs either, so the discriminating point got lost in the metaphysics. In the new post-dualist scientific framework, to be outlined  in  Chapter  3,  the  'mind'  is  not  immaterial, not causally impotent, but more a matter of the central nervous system regulating some internal systems as well as the behaviour of the whole in the environment, and in these terms there are researchable differences between what the central nervous system can control and what it cannot.  Extent  of  control  may  be  modifiable,  subject  to  individual  differences, training and practice, but we know now that even at its best the central nervous system is not an omnipotent controller: there are places and  processes  that  CNS  signalling  pathways  do  not  reach,  for  example,  cell  growth,  linked  to  the  fact  that  the  cells  are  very  basic,  similar in humans as in yeast; nor does the brain control the journey and final resting place of an embolus, and a long list of other biological processes and  outcomes,  benign  or  catastrophic.  And  this  list  can  be  contrasted with a list of biological processes and pathways that can or might have CNS  involvement,  as  suggested  by  studies  cited  above.  These  issues and options only open up, however, in a new post-dualist metaphysics

and biopsychological scientific  paradigm,  which  are  large  themes  to  be addressed through the book. for now, we return to review the findings on biopsychosocial factors.

The next point to note is that, even for those physical health conditions that are unaffected by psychosocial factors, generally or at specific stages, still such factors may be relevant to clinically significant aspects of disease progression and management. These are factors such as access to treatment, participation  in  the  recommended  treatment  regime,  associated pain, psychological/mental health complications and health-related quality of life. Some details and literature as follows:

Access  to  healthcare is  an  obvious  heading,  covering  diverse  factors such as public health screening to ensure timely detection, health literacy, availability, accessibility and affordability of care, and quality of care-all factors heavily dependent on personal, class and state economics, associated therefore with the social gradient in health [5, 48, 49 and e.g. 50].

Acceptability  of/participation  in  the  recommended  treatment  regime. Psychosocial  factors  are  associated  with  medication  non-adherence,  for example,  following  acute  coronary  syndrome  [51],  in  haemodialysis patients [52], in youth with newly diagnosed epilepsy [53]. One systematic review of study of psychosocial factors predicting non-adherence to preventative maintenance medication therapy produced a negative result and call for more research [54].

Psychosocial  factors  in  pain. Pain  as  an  important  phenomenon  and concept spanning the biopsychosocial and will be considered further in Chapter  4.  Clinical  studies  implicating  psychosocial  factors  include:  in chronic  pain  [55,  56]  and  in  pain  associated  with  specific  conditions/ sites, such as multiple sclerosis [57]; musculoskeletal pain [58, 59]; low back pain [60, 61]; spinal  pain  [62];  chronic  prostatitis/chronic  pelvic pain syndrome in men [63]; osteoarthritis [64]; cancer-related pain [65] and pain after breast cancer surgery [66].

Psychological/mental health complications of medical conditions . This is an increasingly recognised issue, with implications for quality of life (on which more below), social impairments and costs, in primary care [67], in  LTCs  [68]  and  in  oncology  [69,  70].  Accumulating  clinical  experience and research has led to a new UK NHS policy directive requiring psychological  therapy  services  to  be  integrated  into  physical  healthcare pathways [71].

Quality of life . There is a substantial literature on psychosocial factors and health-related quality of life in medical conditions, for example, in

patients  with  haematological  cancer  [72];  children  with  myelomeningocele [73]; colorectal cancer survivors [74, 75]; myocardial infarction [76];  after  hip  fracture  in  the  elderly  [77];  newly  diagnosed  coronary artery disease patients [78]; adults with epilepsy [79], and after surgery [80]; and youth-onset diabetes myelitis [81].

Accumulating health data of the sort indicated above implicating psychosocial as well as biomedical factors, taken together, cover a large proportion of population health and health service provision in clinics and hospital beds. In other words, they are massively important, looked at in terms of population health, individual suffering, or economic costs; they are  not  a  side-issue  compared  with  conditions  or  stages  of  conditions that involve biological factors alone.

The  psychosocial  data  have  accumulated  over  the  past  few  decades and have vindicated Engel's proposal of a new model for medicine and healthcare. Engel was ahead of the game, and the popularity of his model is  explained  at  least  partly  by  the  fact  that  it  appeared  as  a  ready-made framework for  accommodating the emerging evidence of psychological and social causal factors in determining health and disease.

In  these  terms  its  clear  that  we  need  a  biopsychosocial  model  of the  sort  that  Engel  anticipated,  but  one  that  can  meet  the  criticisms reviewed previously that the model, at least as we currently invoke it, has  serious  problems  including  lack  of  content  and  incoherence.  We propose in the next section a solution to the content problem, based, as  would  be  expected,  on  emerging  findings  implicating  psychosocial  as  well  as  biological  factors  of  the  sort  outlined  above.  As  to  the coherence problem, this will involve theorising the categories of 'biological', 'psychological' and 'social' in such a way that they can interact in health and disease. This theorising will occupy the rest of the book. One strand was already mentioned earlier in this section: the old dualism between mind and body is replaced by a partial and to some extent negotiable  interaction  between  the  central  nervous  system  and  other biological  systems.  This  theory-shift  will  be  taken  up  in  Chapter  3, along with the proposal that the primary concept of the psychological is embodied agency, with implications for health, drawn out further in Chapter 4: a person's psychological health depends on the development of  a  viable  enough  sense  of  agency,  while  conversely,  if  agency  is  seriously compromised, such as in conditions of chronic stress, their mental health is liable to suffer, and so also, via complex biopsychosocial pathways, is their physical health.

## The Scientific and Clinical Content Is in the Specifics

Let  us  pick  up  the  line  of  argument  in  this  chapter.  The  biopsychosocial model is much invoked, with claim to be the overarching framework for psychiatry and other branches of medicine such as primary care, perhaps for medicine generally. It has however been severely criticised, for being vague, without scientific or clinical content. Here is our suggested remedy: the scientific content and clinical utility of the biopsychosocial model is not to be found in general statements, but rather is specific to particular  health  conditions,  and,  further,  specific  to  particular  stages  of particular health conditions .  We provided above a brief, non-systematic, non-critical  review  of  some  of  the  emerging  evidence  of  involvement of psychological and social as well as biological factors. All the evidence refers  to  particular  health  conditions  or  classes  of  conditions,  and  particular  stages:  risks  for  onset,  post-onset  course,  including  under  treatment, adjustment and quality of life.

At  the  time  Engel  wrote  there  was  not  much  evidence  of  causes  of diseases and treatment effects, with important exceptions in the case of some major infectious diseases. But especially, compared with now, relatively little was known, though much was speculated, about the role of psychosocial factors in health and disease. Since then, in the intervening decades, there have been massive new research programmes, not only in biomedicine, but in clinical psychology, neuroscience, social epidemiology and genetics, and in treatment trials, pharmacological and psychological. Much more is now known about the causes of diseases and about possible disease mechanisms, with associated technologies for prevention, early detection and treatment. This broad evidence base has led in turn to treatment guidelines for specific conditions, to the whole apparatus of evidence-based clinical care, to be used alongside a thorough assessment of  the  individual  case.  Much  of  the  science  and  clinical  management  is now psychological and social as well as biological. Given this situation as it is now, the scientific and clinical content of the biopsychosocial model is in the specifics, not in a 'general model'. Much the same, by the way, can be said of biomedicine and its associated biomedical model: medicine, whether biomedical or biopsychosocial, deals with complex, specific systems.

The  proposal  that  the  content  problem  is  resolved  by  focussing  on specifics  not  generality  also  helps  explain  how  the  problem  arises.  In brief, it is because the specifics are too many and too complex, that some

shorthand,  vague  gesturing,  is  sometimes  useful.  The  basic  and  clinical  sciences  of  the  past  few  decades  invoke  very  many  kinds  of  factors in  their  models:  biological  factors-biological  systems,  including  neural systems and genetic mechanisms-but also psychological factors-such as temperament, personality, lifestyle, adjustment, quality of life-and also social  determinants  of  health  and  disease-variants  on  social  inclusion or exclusion-together with the implication that all these things interact over time, in the course of life and the illness, in complicated and barely understood ways. So, on occasions when the question arises, for example  in  clinical  consultation  or  healthcare  education  systems:  'and  what are  the  factors  involved  in  this  or  that  disease,  or  individual  presentation?'-the quick answer would be: 'it's all  biopsychosocial',  or  'it's  as the biopsychosocial model says'. The full answer is much longer, in the systemic  reviews  of  the  epidemiological  and  clinical  sciences,  treatment trials  and  clinical  guidelines-but  this  full  story  does  not  fit  in  a  ward round or clinical  consultation;  it  more  makes  up  years  long  healthcare educational  training  programmes.  As  workable  compromise,  the  brief throwaway-'it's all biopsychosocial' could be expanded into something more  informative  along  these  lines:  'In  this  condition  there  are  possibly  (or  probably)  biological,  psychological  and  social  factors  involved, in  some  stages,  some  of  which  have  been  identified,  with  more  or  less confidence, combining together in such-and-such ways, though interactive causal pathways are bound to be complex and (typically) not yet well understood-the details  of  what  is  known  and  hypothesised  about  the condition to date is in the literature/is among the topics in one of your teaching modules'.

Such  an  answer,  and  the  science  it  refers  to,  is  about  a  particular health condition, such as diabetes, or depression. In this sense there are multiple  specific  biopsychosocial  models:  a  model  for  diabetes,  depression, cardiovascular disease, schizophrenia; and so forth. further, much depends on what stage or what aspect of a particular condition we have in  mind,  whether  pre-onset  aetiological  risks  for  onset,  or  post-onset course,  involving  many  issues  including  maintaining  factors,  treatment responses, complications, psychological adjustment and factors affecting quality  of  life.  The  factors  involved  in  these  various  stages  and  aspects typically differ within any particular condition, and especially they differ in  the  relative  involvement  of  biological,  psychological  and  social.  for example, social epidemiological studies suggest that social factors as well as  biological  are  implicated  in  the  aetiology  of  a  wide  range  of  health

conditions,  such  as  cardiovascular  disease  and  depression,  while  treatment might not be so, as in surgical intervention for advanced cardiovascular  disease,  or  pharmacological  therapy  for  depression.  This  latter is  typically best combined with psychological therapy, which might also be indicated to aid adjustment and recovery of quality of life following cardiovascular  surgery.  In  short,  there  is  need  for  much  discrimination between what conditions we are talking about, what stages of conditions and questions of interest in each. This is the specificity and complexity of diseases and therefore of the science and its models.

We stress here that we mean no implication that particular diagnostic categories are valid once and for all, or optimal in terms of explanation or prediction. Rather, they simply represent the current consensus state of clinical practice and clinical science and are liable to revision, to subtyping or supra-typing, or to replacement altogether. The proposal is that biopsychosocial medicine, like biomedicine, is applied to specific health conditions, in terms of which the science at any one time is conducted; but  identification  and  classification  of  these  conditions  are  subject  to change.

In  brief,  our  proposal  is  that,  while  the  biopsychosocial  model  can sometimes appear as vague hand-waving, absent any scientific or clinical content, this is because we are looking for content in the wrong place, in the general model, rather than in the epidemiological and clinical science literatures about particular conditions. This proposal, if accepted, solves the content problem.

On the other hand, that said, such a solution immediately raises a still more radical problem for the biopsychosocial model: if it's all about specifics, what is the point of having a 'general model'?!

## So What's the Point of a 'General Model'?

Engel wrote about the biopsychosocial model in a way that suggested it had scientific content and clinical utility. His 1980 paper [4] was on clinical  applications  of  the  biopsychosocial  model, the main example being myocardial infarction, consistent with the reasonable expectation that the model specified biopsychosocial causal pathways in particular conditions and hence could guide clinical  practice.  However,  the  position  regarding what is known in the science has radically changed in the intervening  decades,  and  now,  as  argued  in  the  preceding  section,  the  'general model' is probably now not the place to look for causal pathways, clinical

applications and treatment guidance, which are rather to be found in the health science literatures.

One possibility in the circumstances, as the evidence accumulates, is that the general model might summarise the evidence for all the health conditions, along something like the following lines: 'Psychological and social  factors  as  well  as  biological  factors  (each  of  these  being  of  many different  kinds)  are  relevant  to  all  health  conditions  and  all  healthcare, though they vary in their relative contributions, depending on the condition and the stage of the condition, between 0-100%, or mostly between, say, 20-80% - summing to something like 100%'.

However,  while  such  a  general  proposition  might  be  true,  give  or take some percentage points, it clearly has no or not much content, or use, in for example shaping guidance about prevention or clinical management. It is certainly less informative and useful than the full picture for a specific health condition. It is true that a general statement of the model  such  as  the  above  can  serve  to  remind  us  and  our  students  to keep one's mind open to the range of biopsychosocial factors, but the treatment guidelines and the science behind them already now say this, if applicable, and there is limited gain from repeating the fact-vaguely. Used in this way, the model runs the risk of being, minimally, a bucket to  throw research findings into, convenient for hand-waving purposes. As  for  basic  scientists  and  clinical  trialists,  they  investigate  the  causes, mechanisms and treatment of cardiovascular disease, depression, and so forth; with definitely or probably not much need or time for a 'general model'.

So what is the point of a general model? Perhaps as a theory of health and disease. But the line of thought we are pursuing is exactly that health and  disease  are  not  one  thing,  or  two  things,  but  each  many  things, depending which system within us is functioning well or poorly. Even so, the general picture still matters when the whole of health is in question, for  example  in  estimating  and  projecting  population  health,  planning and prioritising health services and research funding, on treatment, primary or secondary prevention, planning syllabuses for health education, or modelling linkages between health outcomes and outcomes in other sectors such as education, productivity or national happiness. Clinicians, patients and researchers may well be concerned with specific conditions, but for many other purposes views of the whole are required. The concept of biomedicine arose in the recognition that many effective health technologies had in common that they relied on biological factors only,

notwithstanding  complex  biopsychosocial  presentations.  Such  a  concept then drives further lines of enquiry, investigating biological factors in  other  conditions.  An  analogous  point  applies  to  the  biopsychosocial model. A related point is a need for a framework to organise accumulating research findings, to recognise emerging patterns, to identify what is known, with more or less certainty, and what is not known. This applies to specific conditions such as cardiovascular disease, or addictions, but it also applies across health conditions as a whole.

There  are  many  purposes  for  a  general  model  and  accordingly many  ways  of  constructing  such  a  thing.  We  focus  here  on the  general  biopsychosocial model as a core philosophical and scientific theory of health,  disease  and  healthcare,  which  defines  the  foundational  theoretical onstructs-the ontology of the biological, the psychological and the socialc and especially the causal relations within and between these domains .

While the details of the relative roles of biological, psychological and social factors in specific health conditions, at particular stages, are matters for the health sciences, the general, or core, biopsychosocial model is more of an exercise in the philosophy of science-in this case, philosophy of biology, philosophy of mind and social theory, but especially as applied to health and disease. These philosophies are especially relevant in the  present  case,  because  there  is  massive  historical  baggage,  carried in the long history of physicalism, dualism and reductionism, that makes biopsychosocial ontology and causation deeply problematic. This whole problem area needs rethinking and reconceptualising in the light of current scientific paradigms and philosophical theory.

## 1.3 the general model: bioPsychosocial ontology and interactions

## Defining the Problem

Engel was well aware of the philosophical problems involved in the shift from the biomedical model to the biopsychosocial. This is how he characterises the biomedical model ([1], p. 130):

The biomedical model embraces both reductionism, the philosophic view that  complex  phenomena  are  ultimately  derived  from  a  single  primary principle, and mind-body dualism, the doctrine that separates the mental from the somatic. Hence the reductionist primary principle is physicalistic;

that  is,  it  assumes  that  the  language  of  chemistry  and  physics  will  ultimately suffice to explain biological phenomena.

The  biomedical  model  so  understood,  as  based  on  these  philosophical views,  is  antithetical  to  any  extension  to  a  biopsychosocial  model,  and conversely, if the biopsychosocial model is to be viable, it has to overcome the challenges they pose. This is well recognised by thoughtful commentators on the biopsychosocial model, including those, quoted previously, who  criticise  the  model  for  its  hand-waving  tendencies.  Here  is  Chris McManus in his review for The Lancet cited previously ([13], p. 2169):

The challenges for the Biopsychosocial Model involve reductionism, dualism,  mechanism,  methodology,  and  causality.  The  psychological  and  the sociological are ineluctably phenomena of the mind, and the reductionist challenge is how to integrate the mental with the cellular, molecular, and genetic levels at which biomedicine now works.

Ken Kendler in his review quoted earlier, goes on to identify the philosophical issues relevant to the biopsychosocial model and the work that needs to be done ([3], p. 999):

[These are] the issues that the Biopsychosocial model at least seemed to be addressing-how to integrate the diverse etiologic factors that contribute to psychiatric illness and how to conceptualize rigorously multidimensional approaches  to  treatment.  [There  is]  a  range  of  exciting  recent  developments in the philosophy of science  on  approaches  to  complex  biological systems, which are quite relevant to these issues… [which] examine scientific  approaches  to  complex,  nonlinear  living  systems  and  explore  various models of explanatory pluralism, from DNA to mind and culture….

The  importance  of  understanding  causal  interactions  between  kinds  of factors is also highlighted by Dan Blazer in his review of Nassir Ghaemi's book [82] (p. 362):

[There are] emerging efforts across all of medicine to integrate biological, psychological, and social factors in the exploration of the causes and outcomes  of  both  physical  and  psychiatric  illnesses….  These  efforts  are  not eclectic  but  transdisciplinary,  efforts  which  are  leading  to  a  much  better understanding of how biological, psychological, and social factors interact through time.

Both Kendler and Blazer identify the current challenge of constructing a coherent view of causation in health and disease that can encompass biological,  psychological  and  social  factors.  Kendler  refers  to  recent  philosophical developments and Blazer to emerging efforts in health sciences, both implying a historical dimension and that something new needs to happen and is happening, at a conceptual level as well as a scientific level.

Engel's characterisation of the biomedical model, a reasonable one in the  1970s,  had  it  supposing  that  only  the  biological  exists,  or  is  alone causal in health and disease, and it exists as physics and chemistry, with the same principles or laws of causation. The ontology was flat and reductionist: nothing new grew out of the basic physics and chemistry, and any other domain with aspirations to be causal had to be ultimately reduced back to the basics. To construct an alternative to this set of assumptions it is necessary to envisage ontology and causal relations other than, and in some metaphorical sense 'above', those in physics and chemistry. Engel proposed systems theory for this purpose, and as we shall consider in later chapters, we think this is fundamentally the right way to go.

A  systems  theory  approach  in  fact  already  underlies  the  solution to  the  content  problem  we  proposed  in  the  previous  section.  We  proposed  in  Sect. 1.2,  heading 'The  Scientific  and  Clinical  Content  Is  in the Specifics', that the content is to be found in the science and clinical  guidelines  on  specific  health  conditions.  This  is  the  indicated  move because specific systems are distinctive, with their own distinctive functions, operating  principles  and  vulnerabilities  to  dysfunction,  which therefore have to be modelled separately. Healthcare science along with other  systems  sciences,  essentially  deals  in  specifics.  This  has  always applied to biomedicine, which deals with particular biological systems. It also applies in psychology, which deals with particular psychological systems, such as motivation and fear, and in clinical psychological theoryfor example, cognitive behaviour therapy has specific models for such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder.

The  question  arises  then:  what  is  the  core  theory  linking  together the various applications to specific systems? for biomedicine, in the way that Engel characterised it in the 1970s, the core theory was that biology is physics and chemistry, and biological causation is physico-chemical causation. This has changed; it is no longer true of current biomedicine; this is the topic of the next chapter. The core theory underpinning cognitive behavioural therapy, as stated by its founders Aaron Beck and colleagues  [22]  (p.  3)  is  startlingly  brief,  that  cognitions  cause  affect  and

behaviour.  However,  even  this  brief  statement  of  the  core  model  does crucial work: it highlights the working assumption that intervening with cognition is the way to modify troubling emotions and behaviour, and it links together the various types of cognitive behaviour models for diverse conditions. Even in the absence of explicit theory of causation, there can be evidence of causal connection from well-designed treatment trials, but also, in this particular case there is a long and respectable history of the cognitive theory of the emotions and the philosophy of practical reason that provides conceptual familiarity for working purposes.

The contrast here is with the biopsychosocial core model: there is no long and respectable history of philosophy and science theorising causal interactions between the biological, the psychological and the social. To the contrary, the history since the beginnings of modern science in the seventeenth century consists of assumptions and arguments that psychological and social causation are impossible or even incomprehensible, that there is no distinctive biological causation either, over and above physics and chemistry. The historical background is entirely hostile to the whole idea of biopsychosocial causal pathways, and there is therefore a need for an explicit theory as to what the new idea is. It is this, we propose, that is the purpose of the general biopsychosocial model; in short, to theorise biopsychosocial causal interactions.

We  review  some  main  relevant  historical  background  below,  under the  heading 'Prejudicial  Theory:  Physicalism,  Reductionism,  Dualism'. first,  in  the  next  section, we consider how the search for biopsychosocial theory is not only of interest to reworking a model proposed some 40 years ago, but has arisen in the health sciences themselves.

## Biopsychosocial Data in Search of Theory

The emerging evidence of psychosocial causation in health and disease of the sort briefly outlined in Sect. 1.2, comes from studies using empirical methodologies that have been developed and applied substantially since Engel wrote his papers on the biopsychosocial model. Prior to these new research  methods,  there  was  little  or  no  demonstrated  evidence  of  psychological  and  social  causes  of  physical  health  conditions.  Their  effects were not as plain-as massive-as those identified by biomedicine, as for example effects on incidence of cholera of drinking contaminated water from a particular  pump, or recovery following treatment by antibiotics.

In  the  absence  of  a  significant  body  of  evidence  of  a  causative  or  curative  role  of  psychological  and  social  factors  in  particular  diseases,  claims as to their importance were bound to have an uncertain status: were such claims meant to be general, to apply to all conditions, meant to be obvious, or based on prejudice or expert consensus-or specific to particular conditions? In the absence of much evidence, the appearance of ideology was inevitable-and this is one of the key points behind Ghaemi's critique of Engel's biopsychosocial model [2], considered previously (Sect. 1.1). However, the amount of evidence and most importantly the type of evidence bearing on these issues has changed radically in the 40 years since Engel proposed the model. We refer to use of novel statistical methodologies and associated study designs that are sensitive to multiple factors, relatively  small,  partial  causal  influences,  usually  called  risk  factors,  contributing in some way to a complex nexus of causation associated with a particular outcome of interest. The development of these new methodologies was based on nineteenth-century conceptual work on the scientific demonstration of causation, and early twentieth-century work in the theory of statistical inference.

Much  of  the  intellectual  work  clarifying  the  scientific  methodology required for the determination of causes was done by J. S. Mill in his A System of Logic [83]. Hume [84] had seen that causality is linked to generality, that the statement 'A causes B' implies that events of type A are always followed by events of type B. This implies also that knowledge of causes enables prediction, that the next A will be B. Mill saw, however, that in practice what is observed on any one occasion is not simply an event of type A being followed by an event of type B, but this conjunction in a complex of circumstances, C. To establish a causal link between A and B the possible confounding effects of C have to be determined. This  involves  observing  the  effects  of  C  without  A,  on  the  one  hand, and A without C on the other. These principles, elucidated by Mill as the 'methods of agreement and difference', underlie our modern idea of controlled experimentation.

Robert Koch's pioneering work in microbiology in the closing decades  of  the  nineteenth  century  made  four  postulates  as  methodology to  determine  the  causal  relationship  between  a  microbe  and  a  disease, applied  to  the  aetiology  of  cholera  and  tuberculosis  [85,  86].  Koch's postulates  tapped  similar  principles  to  Mill's,  including  assumptions of  generality  and  isolation  of  the  suspected  active  causal  ingredient'isolation' here requiring cutting edge technology of the time.

Interestingly Koch himself recognised that there was a problem with the generality requirement, which takes us on to the next main point.

Hume, Mill and Koch supposed that causality is general-applies to 'all'.  However, in practice in the lifesciences, medicine, psychology and the  social  sciences  we  rarely  find  universal  generalisations,  but  rather partial ones, of the form: A is followed by B in a certain proportion of observed  cases.  One  function  of  a  universal  generalisation  is  to  license the simple inductive inference: the next observed A will be followed by B. In the absence of a universal generalisation, the problem is to determine the probability of the next A being followed by B, given that the proportion  in  the  sample  so  far  observed.  This  is  the  problem  for  the theory of statistical inference, developed in the first decades of the twentieth century.

The  theory  of  statistical  inference  is  a  necessary  condition  of  being able  to  detect  reliable  small  correlations  between  two  factors,  between say  amount of daily  exercise  and  cardiovascular  function  at  a  later  time. The implications of correlations being small-much less than 1 and not much above 0-is that other factors are at work, signalling the need for investigation  of  multiple  factors  associated  with  the  particular  outcome of  interest.  Investigation  requires  a  group  study  in  which  each  factor  is each  measured  and  their  association  or  correlation  with  the  outcome computed. Analysis of variance, ANOVA, is one class of statistics that can be used for such purposes: there is an outcome of interest, the so-called dependent  variable,  and  several  independent  variables,  hypothesised  to effect it. for example, the dependent variable may be onset of cardiovascular  disease  by  40 years,  the  independent  variables  are  individual  characteristics  such  as  weight,  diet,  smoking,  exercise,  multiple  deprivation index,  family  history  as  assumed  proxy  for  genetic  vulnerability,  and  the results of the ANOVA will quantify the amounts of variance in outcome and hence risk attributable to these several factors, alone or in combination. Other classes of statistical analyses can be used, more or less closely related, depending for example on the nature of the variables (e.g. categorical  or  continuous)  and  on  study  design  (e.g.  cross-sectional  or  longitudinal).  Use  of  such  methods  has  become  pervasive  in  the  human sciences in the past few decades, reflecting the fact that the phenomena are complex with multiple causes; instances when a single variable completely explains a phenomenon (accounts for all or most of the variance) are rare.

Naturalistic  studies  of  populations  in  the  first  instance  establish  correlations only, and further investigation is needed to establish causation,

using or approximating to experimental methods of the sort elaborated by Mill and Koch. Experimental designs for establishing causation typically  involve  at  least  two  groups,  assumed  to  be  identical  in  relevant respects-either  known  or  suspected  to  affect  the  outcome  of  interest-except for one factor, the factor of interest. Differences of outcome between  the  two  groups  are  then  attributable  to  the  factor  of  interest in accordance with Mill's method of difference. The factor of interest is often a treatment-an 'intervention'. Confidence in the assumption that the two groups are otherwise identical in relevant respects is critical in these methodologies, and there are many methods of 'matching' groups to  achieve  this.  The  philosophical  justification  for  regarding  controlled designs as the appropriate methodology for establishing causation such as treatment effects has been argued elsewhere [87]. The gold standard for maximising this confidence-the true experimental design-is taken to be randomisation, with sufficiently large numbers, such that possible confounding causal factors can be reasonably assumed to be distributed equally between the groups. Quasi-experimental designs, such as matching cohorts, can also be used, though the confidence that unknown confounders are equally matched is less. There are also 'natural experiments' (see  e.g.  [88]),  and  sometimes  the  background  base  rates  absent  the putative cause are safely assumed.

If  we  establish  that  a  universal  correlation  is  causal,  the  finding  can be  expressed  as  A  causes  B.  Typically  in  the  life  and  human  sciences, correlation  between  factors  is  partial-variation  in  A  accounts  for  only part of the variance in outcome B-in which case the correlation can be expressed as: A raises probability of B, in some specified degree depending on the size of the correlation. If B is a harmful outcome, such as a poor health outcome, this is often expressed: A raises risk of B, in some specified degree.

Population  studies  of  risk  factors  for  the  onset  of  disease  cannot use  randomisation  designs,  plainly  for  ethical  reasons,  and  are  generally  limited  to  more  or  less  refined  quasi-experimental  methodology. Experimentation is left to animal studies. Treatment studies of the effect of an intervention on the course of a disease once onset can use randomisation designs-again subject to ethical constraints.

The new study designs and analytical methodologies showed effectstypically  small-of  psychological  and  social  factors.  The  same  methodology of course can show the importance of biological factors of small effect, such as genetic and epigenetic effects.

Relevant  to  our  main  theme,  however,  we  can  note  that  while  these new study designs and statistical methodologies are well theorised, as is the determination  of  causes  by  experimental  and  related  methods,  they  provide in themselves no theory of the factors indexed by the variables and no theory  of  causal  mechanisms  linking  them.  They  can  provide  evidence  of biopsychosocial causal connections, but no theory about them. This absence of theory is important because of the historical background of dualism and physicalist reductionism, noted at the beginning of this section (under the heading 'Defining the Problem'), that would exclude any distinctive forms of  biological  (as  opposed  to  physico-chemical),  psychological  and  social causation. We review some main points of this historical background next.

## Prejudicial Theory: Physicalism, Reductionism, Dualism

Engel's characterisation of the biomedical model-quoted at the beginning of this section, uses a few key technical terms: reductionism, physicalism  and  physicalist  reductionism  (Engel  uses  'physicalistic').  These terms  refer  to  complex  and  controversial  concepts  with  long  histories, and we will use working characterisations as follows:

Physicalism is the view that everything that exists is physical. This is an ontological statement-about what there is. It has often been combined with the corresponding statement about causation: that all causation is physical, covered by physical laws. On the assumption that chemistry is basically physics, physicalism can be expressed in terms of physics  +  chemistry.  The  contemporary  philosophical  literature  on  physicalism  is  substantial (for recent review see e.g. [89]). Working around physicalism is necessary to establish a biopsychosocial model and is addressed in more detail in the next chapter.

Reductionism has various meanings. In one of the senses used by Engel in his characterisation of the biomedical model, quoted at the beginning of this  section,  it  is  a  scientific  claim  that  complex  phenomena  have  a main cause of a particular type. In the medical context, reductionism in this  sense  would  claim  that  there  is  a  main  cause  of  one  or  other  kind: biological (e.g. an infection or lesion), or psychological (e.g. unconscious conflicts,  or  maladaptive  cognitive  style),  or  social  (e.g.  social  exclusion; labelling). There is also a philosophical or metaphysical doctrine of reductionism, deriving from physicalism, as follows:

Physicalist  reductionism  follows  from  the  strong  version  of  physicalism which has ontology and causation as all a matter of physics. It is a

strict  consequence  for  other  sciences,  such  as  chemistry,  biology,  psychology and social science: either they are true causal sciences, in which case they must ultimately reducible to the concepts and laws of physics; or, otherwise, they are pseudo-sciences, or at least, 'sciences' that do not deal  with  causation.  Physicalist  reductionism  so  understood  is  a  philosophical or metaphysical doctrine in the sense that it is known or alleged a priori; it is not based on scientific research, but rather prejudges what there is to be discovered. Physicalist reductionism along with its roots in physicalism is taken up in the next chapter.

Physicalism has a long history, its roots lying in what historians of science refer  to  as  the  'mechanisation  of  the  world  picture'  in  the  seventeenth century [90-92]. This involved defining the primary qualities of nature  in  mathematical  terms,  as  mass,  extension  and  motion,  covered by  the  few  universal  laws  of  Newtonian  mechanics.  The  mechanisation of nature created mind-body dualism, because the thing that never did seem to be physical was immediate experience: sense-perceptions, thinking, pain and the like. Physical objects including the human body have the primary qualities, while the mind was something else, immaterial and unlocated.  Physicalism  and  dualism  are  twins,  one  born  straight  after the  other,  combative  from  the  start,  each  refuting  the  other,  the  one supported by the great edifice of modern mechanics, the other known immediately by experience, battling ever since.

It is impossible to overstate the massive influence of modern physics and its accompanying philosophy of nature on the subsequent development of western science through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As sciences developed, studying apparently distinctive domains and processes,  the  dominant  physicalism  applied  its  stringent  reductionist test: either the new aspiring science was valid as causal science, in which case it should be reducible to physics, or, it was not reducible to physics, in which case it was pseudo-science, or at best, a 'science' studying noncauses. The chemistry that emerged in the nineteenth century passed the test and joined physics. As to biology, psychology and social science, on the other hand, physicalist reductionism aided by dualism caused disunity and more or less havoc-some key points in brief as follows, to be picked up in later chapters:

Biology as we now understand it developed in the nineteenth century, drawing from previous roots in medicine, natural history and botany (see e.g.  Ernst  Mayr's  seminal  work  on  the  history  and  philosophy  of  biology,  [93]).  This  large,  complex  field,  comprising  many  subfields,  with

distinctive domains, questions and methods, had an ambiguous relation with physicalism and reductionism. In some areas of biology, especially in medicine, physiology and new subspecialities such as microbiologythere was the possibility of reduction of biological phenomena as chemistry.  A  key  development  was  Lavoisier's  work  on  the  relation  between combustion and respiration, initiating the scientific research programme that  became  biochemistry.  However,  for  other  parts  of  the  broad  and diverse  field  of  biology,  reducing  the  phenomena  of  life  to  chemistry was  not  such  a  clear  option.  This  applied  especially  to  developmental embryology  and  evolutionary  biology,  which  aimed  to  understand  the formation  of  individual  organisms  and  whole  species,  and  which  used explanatory  concepts  more  akin  to  older,  Aristotelian  concepts  such  as form  and  function.  Such  alternative  concepts,  contrasted  with  physics and chemistry, will appear in later chapters as we develop biopsychosocial theory. Biology could embrace physicalist reductionism, or ignore it, or argue against it head on. This third option was the doctrine of 'vitalism', which posited a biological life force in addition to mechanical, or more broadly physico-chemical, forces. Vitalism is in this sense a direct response to the mechanisation of the world picture in modern science, a point made by Bechtel and Richardson [94] (p. 1051):

Vitalism  is  best  understood…  in  the  context  of  the  emergence  of  modern  science  during  the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth  centuries.  Mechanistic explanations of natural phenomena were extended to biological systems by Descartes and his successors. Descartes maintained that animals, and the human  body,  are  'automata',  mechanical  devices  differing  from  artificial devices only in their degree of complexity. Vitalism developed as a contrast to this mechanistic view.

As  to  psychology,  this  new  science  inherited  the  Cartesian  dualist assumptions: immaterial mind evident immediately in consciousness, and the mechanical body. Psychology struggled with the oddness of mind as its  subject  matter  for  several  decades,  then  shifted  to  the  other  option, compatible with physicalism and reductionism, aligning psychology with physics and chemistry. This was behaviourism, and here is Watson [95] (p. 158) summarising the new approach:

Psychology,  as  the  behaviorist  views  it,  is  a  purely  objective,  experimental  branch of natural science which needs introspection as little as do the

sciences of chemistry and physics. It is granted that the behaviour of animals can be investigated without appeal to consciousness… This suggested elimination of states of consciousness as proper objects of investigation in themselves will remove the barrier from psychology which exists between it  and  the  other  sciences.  The  findings  of  psychology  become  the  functional correlates of structure and lend themselves to explanation in physico-chemical terms.

The  social  sciences,  on  the  other  hand,  as  they  emerged  through  the nineteenth century never were going to lend themselves to comprehension in physico-chemical terms. This would be desperate business. Their subject-matter was, briefly stated, forms and processes of social organisation, which looked a very long way from physics and chemistry, further away than even psychology. As to principles of social causation, perhaps there were universal laws governing change, but equally, social systems and events appeared as specific, even unique. In short, the ontology of the natural sciences was no use to the emerging social sciences, and their methodology was of limited or questionable use. Accordingly alternative approaches developed, drawing from philosophical traditions other than physicalism,  emphasising  understanding  and  meaning,  'hermeneutics', rather  than  causal  explanation  of  nature.  Here  is  Anthony  Giddens  on this point [96] (pp. viii-ix):

The tradition of the Geisteswissenschaften, or the 'hermeneutic' tradition,  stretches  back  well  before  Dilthey,  and  from  the  middle  of  the eighteenth  century  onwards  was  intertwined  with,  but  also  partly  set off  from,  the  broader  stream  of  Idealistic  philosophy.  Those  associated with the hermeneutic viewpoint insisted upon the differentiation of the sciences of nature from the study of man. While we can 'explain' natural occurrences in terms of the application of causal laws, human conduct is intrinsically meaningful, and has to be 'interpreted' or 'understood' in a way which has no counterpart in nature. Such an emphasis linked closely with a stress upon the centrality of history in the study of human conduct,  in  economic  action  as  in  other  areas,  because  the  cultural  values that lend meanings to human life, it was held, are created by specific processes of social development.

To sum up, physicalist  reductionism  had  a  massive  influence  on  the development of the biological, psychological and social sciences. It prioritised  physics,  subsequently  physics  and  chemistry,  as  the  benchmark of  empirical  science  and  causal  explanation.  Parts  of  biology  measured

up, as biochemistry, evolutionary biology didn't; psychology struggled; and the social sciences were so far off the mark that new views of science including alternatives to causal explanation were needed.

Against  this  background,  deeply  entrenched  theory,  antithetical  to any distinctive forms of biological (as opposed to physico-chemical), psychological and social causation, Engel's proposal of the biopsychosocial model was audacious. It was, however, prescient, because in the intervening decades the empirical evidence has built up, as outlined in Sect. 1.2, under  the  heading 'Emerging  Evidence  of  Psychosocial  Causation'. A  main  virtue  of  the  empirical,  empiricist  methodology  of  Hume  and Mill, outlined in Sect. 1.3, under the heading 'Biopsychosocial Data in Search of Theory', is that it can accumulate evidence of causal connections, driving the science forwards, unhindered by theoretical prejudice. The scientific methodology for determining associations and causal connections between one or more factors and a health outcome in indifferent to the nature of the factor variables involved, in particular it has no interest in whether they are called 'biological', 'psychological' or 'social'; the  methodology  has  no  interest  in  ontological  matters  at  all-it  cares only that the variables are measurable. Equally the empirical and statistical methodology has not much or nothing to say about causal mechanisms. free of the historical theoretical baggage, it has been able to study relations between biological, psychological and social factors and health outcomes of interest, the upshot of which has been accumulation of evidence  that  psychological  and  social  factors  are  at  least  associated  with some health outcomes, physical and mental, and with some evidence of causal impact. Such free creativity is typical of empirical science. On the other hand, the downside is that we have apparently established biopsychosocial ontology and causal interactions, but so far untheorised, andstill feeling the effects of physicalist reductionism in the last few centuries of science-with perplexity and incredulity that such a thing is possible.

## Theorising Biopsychosocial Interactions-Not Parallel Worlds

The  proposal  of  biopsychosocial  ontology  and  causal  relations-under the  weight  of  philosophical  and  scientific  prejudice  according  to  which psychological  and  social  causation  are  impossible,  even  incomprehensible, and there is no distinctive biological causation either, over and above physics and chemistry-is audacious and the task of making theoretical sense of it is non-trivial.

Engel's  biopsychosocial  model  is  a  very  suitable  heading  for  examining these issues. His papers certainly identified many of them, probably all that were apparent at the time he wrote them. However, Engel's model is only a heading for the major task of elucidating theory that can comprehend the paradigms and findings of the health sciences of the past few decades that invoke the full range of and interactions between biological, psychological and social factors in health and disease.

We propose to start with biology and especially its relation to physics and chemistry. It is the assumption that biology is no more than physics and  chemistry  that  locks  in  the  physicalist  philosophy  that  the  laws  of physics and chemistry are the only causal laws. While that philosophical position remains in play, without viable alternative, it is difficult to make out any distinctive psychological or social causation and especially difficult  to  theorise  biopsychosocial  interactions.  There  is  simply  too  much historical  conceptual  baggage in the way, variations of dualism and the disunity of the sciences.

We  will  be  considering  theory  changes  that  have  accelerated  in  the decades  since  Engel  wrote.  Up  to  the  1970s,  just  about  everybody supposed that biology (as least  as  physiology)  was  reducible  to  physics and chemistry, but psychology and social sciences hardly, and so much the worse for them. In the 1970s, however, the reducibility of biology to  physics  became  questionable,  with  recognition  that  all  the  'special sciences',  apart  from  physics/chemistry,  had  distinctive  concepts  and apparently causal explanations. However, exactly what the other sciences are sciences of, and what becomes of physicalism, dualism and reductionism, and especially how the various sciences are meant to relate to one another- all remained unclear and contested. Jerry fodor's 1974 paper [97] had the full title 'Special Sciences (Or: The Disunity of Science as a Working Hypothesis)'. fodor's 1997 [98] update was equally informatively  titled,  as  'Special  Sciences:  Still  Autonomous  After  All  These Years', concluding 'The world, it seems, runs in parallel, at many levels of description. You may find that perplexing…'

This parallel world view-or perhaps it should be parallel worlds plural-in which it is supposed that as well as the physico-chemical world, there  is  also  a  biological  world  (unless  that  is  the  same  as  the  physico-chemical  world),  and  a  psychological  world,  and  the  social  worldis  certainly  perplexing.  It  does  not  get  much  less  perplexing  if  'parallel world(s)'  is  replaced  by  'many  (parallel)  levels  of  description'.  Such  a view however is exactly what is intellectually arrived at when forced to

acknowledge, when no longer able to deny, that the biological, psychological and social sciences are now established as valid sciences including causal determinations, in some reasonable sense of 'causal', such as: can predict; when no longer able to deny this, while at the same time continuing to assume that the physico-chemical world is closed to anything other than physico-chemical causation.

This  parallel  worlds/levels  of  description  approach  can  be  applied in  the  health  sciences,  leading  to  the  idea  that  psychological  and  social models  of  health  and  disease,  as  well  as  the  biomedical,  can  somehow all be valid, but at different levels of description. As indicated previously in  Sect. 1.1,  Nassir  Ghaemi  argued  that  the  biopsychosocial  model  has been used exactly to resolve turf wars between these various disciplines, by allowing them all to claim validity at the same time, the upshot being irredeemable  vagueness  and  incoherence.  We  noted  however  that  this thought is not prominent in Engel's papers, which philosophically relies rather on systems theory in which there is interaction between domains.

Philosophically,  the  parallel  world(s)  move,  historically  inevitable  as it  probably was, is not really coherent; what is needed rather is a more liberal  view  of  worldly  ontology  and  causation  that  can  encompass  not only physics and chemistry but also biological, psychological and social processes  and  principles  of  change.  In  any  case,  so  far  as  the  current sciences are concerned, and especially the health sciences, the idea of parallel causal explanations is unhelpful; rather, what is needed is theory of multifactorial interactive causation. Specifically, data of the sort reviewed in  Sect. 1.2  under  the  heading 'Emerging  Evidence  of  Psychosocial Causation',  suggesting  biopsychosocial  involvement  in  health  and  disease, need to be theorised in terms of biopsychosocial interactions. The quotes from Chris McManus, Ken Kendler and Dan Blazer considered at the  beginning  of  this  section,  when  setting  up  the  task  of  the  general biopsychosocial model, all refer to the need to integrate biological, psychological and social factors. Another aspect of the same point is that the various kinds of factors are found in the science to account for different proportions of the variance in health outcomes, with relative proportions of  the  three  varying  between  health  conditions  and  stages  of  condition. from the point of view of the science, a sentence along such lines as:  'biological,  psychological  and  social  factors  (always)  each  severally account for 100% of the variance - at different levels of description'-is completely incomprehensible.

## Finding the Right Metaphor: Evolution and Development

It  is  not  straightforward  to  find  the  right  metaphor  for  the  relation between the biological, the psychological and the social. The most common  is  in  terms  of  hierarchical  levels,  but  it  suffers  from  reductionist connotations that lower levels are more basic, more causal, than higher ones.  Alternatively,  as  a  transitionary  move  away  from  reductionism, appraised in the previous section, it can be interpreted as different levels of ontology and/or description running in parallel, but this makes interactions  mysterious.  Systemic  approaches  that  envisage  interactions  are the key, major improvement, but still the metaphors struggle. One, used by Engel in his 1980 paper [4], is 'nested squares' of systemic inter-activity, from the within-body biological, outwards to self-organised activity  in  the  external  environment,  including  interactions  with  immediate conspecifics, through to complex patterns of social organisation and regulation. This 'nested' domains metaphor is not up to much either, however, insofar as it lends itself to the implicit though odd presumption that the inner domain is sorted out first, then the next grows around it, then the next around that; in effect to the idea, absurd once spelt out, that our internal biology comes first, then activity in the outside world, then activity  with  conspecifics.  This  sequencing  beginning  with  'first'  makes no sense temporally or systemically. Internal biology, functioning in the environment, including with other biological beings, cannot be separated from one another, conceptually or temporally.

What is missing from and obscured by these two-dimensional picture metaphors of levels and nested domains is the temporal, evolutionary and developmental, parameter . Everything is present in the original, primitive, prototypic  forms.  A  cell  is  an  individual  unit,  separate  from  but  essentially interacting with the environment, extracting and expending energy, including interaction with other biological entities such as viruses. Parent sea birds catch fish and put it in the mouths of developmentally immature  offspring,  promoting  the  biologically  necessary  energetic  reactions by bringing the chemicals into close enough proximity, acting like a catalyst-unless the fish is taken away first by a bigger bird of the same or different species. All these biological-environmental-individual-within-and-between-species-interactive processes are involved from the start in  the  simple  forms,  which  become  ever  more  complex.  In  short,  no static metaphor, whether in terms of levels or nested systems, capable of being drawn on a page, does justice to the new systems sciences, which

essentially invoke dynamical interaction in present time, on the basis of co-evolution through deep time.

## Developing the General Model

Evolution  and  development  involve  increasing  complexity  of  forms, and our argument will be that these forms bring with them new causal properties. Another way of expressing this is to say that what comes into being are increasingly complex systems, and that these systems have new and distinctive  causal  properties.  There  is  in  particular  a  quantum  leap at  the  boundary  between  inanimate  and  biological  material  in  which new forms or systems appear that manage the physics and chemistry of the  matter,  specifically  energy  exchanges  governed  by  physico-chemical equations. This is the argument of Chapter 2, Sect. 2.1. The biological/ biomedical  sciences  in  the  last  half-century  have  done  all  the  work  to undo the restrictive assumption that biology is only physics and chemistry and to construct instead new deep theory involving another kind of ontology, turning on dynamical forms, and causation as regulation and control. The way out of physicalist reductionism starts here-exactly at the place where physics and chemistry become biology. This is the argument of Chapter 2, Sect. 2.2.

The  evolution  of  life  forms  ends  up  with  human  psychological  and social  phenomena.  This  'ends  up  with',  as  currently  understood  in  the science, is not a matter of logic or scientific law, but is entirely contingent-accidental. In this sense, biopsychosocial systems theory is unlike some  traditional  philosophical  systems,  which  start  with  axioms  and deduce the rest,  or  which  elucidate  natural  law  that  covers  everything. So when we move from defining key features of biology, in Chapter 2, to defining key features of psychological and hence social phenomena in Chapter  3,  there  is  a  gap,  evident  at  the  start  in  Sect. 3.1,  one  which cannot be filled in by logic or natural law, but only by contingent facts of evolution, development and change.

Human psychological and social phenomena have lives of their ownmultiple  distinctive  modes  of  operation,  turning  on  systemic  concepts and principles already evident in biology, such as form , organisation , ends , communication , rules and regulations .  In  the  evolution  and  development of new forms or systems, it can be said that they all share-from the start, and remaining in-the same 'ontological space/time'. This is a good way of capturing the fact that they can bump into one another and affect one

another, that they causally interact, as opposed to being in parallel universes. This is to say, the ontological point is at the same time essentially a point about causal interaction. We propose defining key features of psychosocial phenomena and causation in the first sections of Chapter 3, Sects. 3.1-3.4, consistent with the key features of biology proposed in Chapter 2. With the whole biopsychosocial system in view, we return in Sect. 3.4, to the general theory of biopsychological systems, interwoven ontology and causal theory. We address the vexed issues of top-down causes, vexed from the point of view  of  physicalist  reductionism:  psychological  effects  on  biological  processes, and social effects on our biology and psychology. However, by this stage in the argument-and in the current science we intend to be tracking-the prejudicial  concepts  and  assumptions  of  physicalist  reductionism are nowhere to be seen. Rather, in the new approach, there are coherent core concepts and principles of causation by regulatory control, which are found already in biology, and which can elucidate in a relatively straightforward way the logic of what is traditionally regarded as top-down processing in  biological,  psychological  and  social  domains.  In  brief,  control  mechanisms employ agents at the lower level, compliant with any laws that may apply at that level, but also acting as messengers from higher levels, defined by networks of relations at those higher levels.

The detailed arguments elucidating the general theory of biopsychosocial  interactions  are  developed  through  the  next  two  chapters.  The fourth chapter expands on relevance to health and disease. In fact, however,  the  whole theory is at its core, from the start, a theory of health and  disease.  This  is  because  the  theory  is  fundamentally  normative,  in terms of concepts such as functioning well or badly, being well or unwell. The contrast here with physicalist reductionism is striking: the old theory makes a point of excluding any hint of normativity, with no interest in any difference between life and death or anything else related.

## CHAPTER 2

## Biology Involves Regulatory Control of Physical-Chemical Energetic Processes

Abstract As  Engel  saw,  we  will  never  make  sense  of  psychosocial factors and their influence on health and disease while there is an underlying assumption that only physical causes are real. We believe the place to unpick this assumption is in biology and biomedicine itself, especially in  the  relation  between  biological  processes  and  physics  and  chemistry. Ernst  Schrödinger's  insight  that  biological  processes  run  locally  counter to the general direction of the second law of thermodynamics is now mainstream biophysics, as is his proposal that this is originally achieved by  genes  exercising  information-based  regulatory  control  of  energetic processes.  Information-based  regulatory  control  mechanisms  are  a  new and  distinctive  form  of  causation  compared  with  conformity  to  the energy  equations  of  physics  and  chemistry,  most  clearly  evident  in  the fact that they can break down. This serves to argue against physicalism and is consistent with recent innovations in the philosophy of causation. The new concepts and principles of regulatory control apply in biology, but  they  also  run  through  the  psychological  and  social  domains.  This enables a more unified science, and one that has foundational differences between life and death, health and illness.

## Life vs. The Second Law of Thermodynamics

In  the  mid-twentieth  century  Erwin  Schrödinger  saw  that  from  the point  of  view  of  physics  living  systems  can  be  conceptualised  as  local areas in which, contrary to the general direction in the universe, entropy decreases, order increases [1]. Living systems make  energy  differences,  extracting  energy  from  the  environment,  using  this  to  maintain their  difference  and  to  function,  for  example  to  obtain  more  energy. Schrödinger's idea was taken up by von Bertalanffy in his General System Theory [2],  and  is  now  mainstream  life  science,  at  the  cutting  edge  of understanding how biology relates to physics and chemistry, conceptually and in the appearance of life on Earth. Here is the biophysicist Nick Lane in his recent popular book The Vital Question [3] (pp. 21-22):

Ironically, the modern era of molecular biology, and all the extraordinary DNA technology that it  entails,  arguably  began  with  a  physicist,  specifically  with  the  publication  of  Erwin  Schrödinger's  book  What  is  Life?  in 1944. Schrödinger made two key points: first, that life somehow resists the universal tendency to decay, the increasing entropy (disorder) that is stipulated by the second law of thermodynamics;…

The  second  point  is  that  the  key  to  how  life  does  this  is: genes and genetic information. We pick this up later, but first, more on the physics.

## Energy Production and Control in Cells

Rolling  entropy  back-locally  and  definitely  temporarily-is  bound  to involve a great deal of physics. Lane vividly explains energy production processes deep inside the cell; here are some selections [3] (pp. 69-71):

You are at the thermodynamic epicentre of the cell, the site of cellular respiration, deep within the mitochondria. Hydrogen is being stripped from the molecular remains of your food, and passed into the fast and largest of [the] giant respiratory complexes… Electrons are separated from protons and fed into this vast complex, sucked in at one end and spat out of the other, all the way over there, deep in the membrane itself… The electrical current  animates  everything  here…  Your  40  trillion  cells  contain  at  least

a  quadrillion  mitochondria,  with  a  combined  convoluted  surface  area  of about 14,000 square metres; about 4 football fields. Their job is to pump protons, and together they pump more than 10 21  of them… every second .

The key points for our present purpose are first, that biological organisms exploit physics to extract energy for functioning, and second, picked up in the next section, that their doing this depends not only and essentially  on  the  physics  but  also  on massive  organisational  and  regulatory mechanisms .

## Regulatory Control by Genetic Information

Questions  about  how  living  processes  accomplish  the  feat  or  resisting entropy,  at  least  temporarily  until  they  return  to  dust,  and  how  they persist  nevertheless  by  making  replicas  of  themselves-all  turn  out  to involve regulation and control, information and coding .  Here  is  Nick Lane  on  Schrödinger's  second  key  point,  continuing  from  the  quote above [3] (p. 22):

And  second,  that  the  trick  to  life's  local  evasion  of  entropy  lies  in  the genes. He proposed that the genetic material is an aperiodic crystal, which does  not  have  a  strictly  repeating  structure,  hence  could  act  as  a  codescript  -  reputedly  the  first  use  of  the  term  in  the  biological  literature… Within a frenzied decade, Crick and Watson had inferred the crystal structure of DNA itself. In their second Nature paper of 1953, they wrote: 'it therefore  seems  likely  that  the  precise  sequence  of  the  bases  is  the  code which carries the genetical information'. That sentence is the basis of modern biology. Today biology is information, genomic sequences are laid out in silico, and life is defined in terms of information transfer.

Biological  organisms  use  information  transfer  to  control  energy  transfer.  Physical and chemical processes involve energy transfers covered by mathematical  energy  equations,  but  in  biological  organisms  the  physical  and  chemical  processes  not  only  happen,  but  can  only  happen  in the right place at the right time in the right degree, if there are mechanisms  that  control  and  regulate  them  in  a  way  appropriate  to  bringing about a particular function. These mechanisms also conform to the physico-chemical  energy  equations,  they  never  violate  them,  but  they are  not  fully  explained  by  them,  rather  their  full  explanation  has  to

invoke  concepts  of  information-based  regulatory  control,  and  typically involve form ,  or structure .  Control systems assemble, organise, up- and down-regulate  physico-chemical  energetic  processes.  A  control  system has  to  be  sensitive  to  physico-chemical  processes  and  to  other  control systems, depending on their state, if they are to tend towards end states of  the  whole.  This  reactive  and  interactive  sensitivity  to  external  states implies  the  flow  and  exchange  of  information.  Information  is  however not like energy, which is covered by the energy equations of physics and the corresponding enthalpy equations of chemistry. Rather, information is  more  like  a switch ,  turning  processes  off  and  on,  hence  being  representable typically by 0s and 1s; or like a gate that has continuous positions between open and shut.

The new concept of information was constructed inside and outside biology.  Critical  advances  were  made  by  logicians,  mathematicians  and electrical  engineers  in  the  1940s  as  part  of  war  efforts  to  break  codes and to secure codes. Here is Andrew Hodges on this point, referring to Turing's work in Bletchley and Shannon's in Bell Labs in the early 1940s [4] (p. 317):

Rapidly developing, and not only in Bletchley and Washington, was a new kind of machinery, a new kind of science, in which it was not the physics and chemistry that mattered, but the logical structure of information, communication, and control.

This sentence summarises the way that current science has taken leave of the old reductionist assumption that only the physics and chemistry of matter. Appropriately, it works across all the sciences, forging links and creating  a  unity  among  previously  unconnected  problem  areas.  That  is to say, the new kind of science works across all the sciences except physics and chemistry, which deal with energy transfer, but even then, it has comprehensible, theorised and technological connections with the physics and chemistry of the processes involved.

The logical rules of information flow-such as 'if A then B'-can take, as  first  approximation,  energy  values  as  initial  state  variables,  for  example,  electrical  potential  difference  across  the  mitochondrial  membrane, but the consequents are regulatory variables-such as open or close, or open or close more or less. This points to the need to correct the first approximation  of  the  initial  state  variables:  they  are  not  energy  values, but information about them. It is the information that triggers the

regulatory response. In interacting control mechanisms, the initial states are also regulatory variables-another gate being open or closed, and so on.  Implementation  of  such  rules  requires  suitable  materials  in  a  suitable  state-it  might  be  difficult  to  make  a  switch  out  of  a  cup  of  water for  example-but  apart  from  this  entirely  crucial  qualification,  material composition is unimportant. Another way of making this point is that the energy transfer involved in information transfer is irrelevant to the information  transfer.  The  flow  of  information  depends  on  regularities,  but these regularities are not determined by the energy equations of physics and  chemistry,  rather  they  must  rely  on  other  properties  of  materiality. The concept required at this point is expressed by such terms as structure, form , shape or syntax (to borrow from logic)-that codes information . The concept of code, reliant on form or shape, signifies how biology breaks away from physics. Code is fallible, liable to error, and it has an arbitrary quality: the same information can be carried by different forms. Code is a kind of mechanism: it makes things happen in the receiving system, and what it makes happen depends on the state of the emitting system.

In  short,  for  life  to  arise  and  persist  requires  much  organising  and control  of  the  physics  and  chemistry,  and  this  organising  and  control relies  on  information.  Here  is  the  oncologist  Siddhartha  Mukherjee  in his  book The Gene: An Intimate History referring  to  similar  points  [5] (p. 409):

The  universe  seeks  equilibriums;  it  prefers  to  disperse  energy,  disrupt organisation, and maximise chaos. Life is designed to combat these forces. We slow down reactions, concentrate matter, and organise chemicals into compartments…

Mukherjee  goes  on  to  emphasise  the  importance  of  the circular  flow of biological information : Genes encode RNAs, to build Proteins, to form/ regulate Organisms, that  sense Environments, that  influence Proteins, RNA (and DNA), that regulate Genes…. -commenting that it is 'perhaps  one  of  the  few  organising  principles  in  biology,  the  closest  thing that we might have to biological law' [5] (p. 410).

To  sum  up,  current  biological  models  include  both  biochemistry, subject  to  physico-chemical  energy  equations, plus models  of  information-based regulatory control mechanisms. Here is an illustration of such mechanisms, from a paper titled  'Signaling  in  Control  of  Cell  Growth and Metabolism' [6].

In  multicellular  organisms,  cell  growth  and  proliferation  are  normally not cell autonomous. Receptor-mediated signal transduction, initiated by extracellular growth factors, promotes entry into the cell cycle and reprograms  cellular  metabolism  to  fulfil  the  biosynthetic  needs  of  cell  growth and  division  […]  However,  despite  having  become  highly  dependent on  instruction  from  extracellular  growth  factors,  mammalian  cells  have retained  the  ability  to  sense  their  internal  metabolic  reserves  and  adjust their  growth  and  biosynthetic  activities  accordingly.  Much  of  this  feedback control occurs at the level of posttranslational modifications of signal transduction  proteins  by  key  cellular  metabolites.  Moreover,  intracellular  metabolites  can  also  regulate  chromatin  accessibility  to  control  gene expression…

This quotation illustrates, as would so many others, the fundamental and dominant importance of regulatory control processes in current biological/biomedical science.

As  already  implied,  the  appearance  of  regulatory  control  processes  in biology, in addition to the energy-related equations of physics and chemistry,  has  major  implications  for  the  unity  of  science,  paving  the  way  for interacting  linkages  between  the  biological,  the  psychological  and  the social. This is because elaborations of these processes are found throughout these domains. As illustration, consider this passage from Lane, proposing a reason why mitochondria retain their own local genes [3] (p. 187):

The mitochondrial genes must be right there on site, next to the bioenergetic membranes they serve. I'm told that the political term is 'bronze control'… In a war, gold control is the central government, which shapes long-term  strategy;  silver  control  is  the  army  command,  who  planned the distribution of manpower or weaponry used; but a war is won or lost on  the  ground,  under  the  command  of  bronze  control,  the  brave  men or  women  who  actually  engage  enemy,  take  the  tactical  decisions,  who inspire their troops, and who are remembered in history as great soldiers. Mitochondrial genes are bronze control, decision-makers on the ground…

This illustrates how new explanatory concepts now fundamental to biology,  apply  also  to  psychological  and  social  processes.  Or  it  can  be  put the other way round: when biophysicists want to explain their theoretical models, they help themselves to processes and principles familiar in psychosocial phenomena. The idea of theory reduction to basic science has disappeared.

## Error Is Fundamental to Biology

Control  of  energetic,  metabolic  processes  is  what  holds  back  entropy increase, keeping biological organisms alive and functioning, as opposed to back to dust. The next point to emphasise is that control processes, dependent on information transfer, can go wrong, unlike energy transfers,  which  can't.  Here  is  Lane  explaining  further  the  need  for  local genetic  control,  'decision-making',  in  energy  production  in  the  mitochondria [3] (p. 187):

Why are such decisions necessary? […] We discussed the sheer power of the  proton-motive  force.  The  mitochondrial  membrane  has  an  electrical potential  of  about  150-200  millivolts.  As  the  membrane  is  just  5  nanometres thick, […] this translates into a field strength of 30 million volts per metre, equal to a bolt of lightning. Woe betide you if you lose control over such an electrical charge!

## Loss of control leads to poor outcomes [3] (pp. 187-188):

The penalty is not simply a loss of ATP synthesis, although that alone may well  be  serious.  failure  to  transfer  electrons  properly  down  the  respiratory chains to oxygen (or other electron receptors) can result in a kind of electrical short-circuiting, in which electrons escape to react directly with oxygen or nitrogen, to form reactive 'free radicals'. The combination of falling ATP levels, depolarisation of the bioenergetic membranes and release of free radicals is the classic trigger for 'programmed cell death'… In essence, mitochondrial genes can respond to local changes in conditions, modulating the membrane potential within modest bounds before changes become catastrophic.

The general conceptual point at issue here is that regulation and control mechanisms keep things going right rather than wrong . Such normativity is  not  present  in  the  energy  equations  of  physics  and  chemistry,  which always apply and never fail. It arises in biology for the first time, marking a fundamental departure of biology from physical and chemical processes alone. The normativity is implied in all of the key systems theoretic concepts such as regulation , control and information . It derives from the point  that  biological  systems  function  towards  ends,  and  function  well and badly accordingly as they do or do not attain them. In the present illustration  the  point  is  that  if  electrical  charge  in  the  cell  membrane  is not properly regulated, the cell dies.

Normativity  applies  at  the  basic  level  of  genetic  replication,  as  for example  in  'transcription  error'  in  molecular  genetics-or  'mutation' as used in evolutionary biology. The concept of mutation is critical in evolutionary  biology,  crucial  to  explaining  how  diversity  arises-the condition for natural selection processes to operate. Genes are the vehicles of information passed from one generation to the next, including the  required  building  instructions;  they  normally  run  true,  creating like for like, but to explain diversity they have to be able to mutate, to make a mistake in the replication. It was a hard question what shape of thing  could  have  these  and  this  combination  of  functional  qualitiesthe answer turning out to be the double helix. Watson and Crick's [7] double-helix structure could replicate itself (by a several stage process), securing continuity, and it could also mutate, delivering a copy with a changed order of bases. This variation leads to production of different proteins  that  could  (might  or  might  not)  affect  the  phenotype  interacting with the environment, which difference could (might or might not)  differentially  affect  survival  and  propagation.  But  this  variation at  the  phenotypic  level  is  possible  because  variation  is  possible  at  the molecular  level,  because  various  nucleotide  sequences  are  possible,  all consistent  with  complex  molecular  thermodynamic  equilibrium.  The emergence  of  biological  diversity  depends  on  the  kind  of  error  that genes are capable of.

As  implicit  above,  normativity  also  applies  at  the  level  of  the  whole organism  in  interaction  with  the  environment:  interaction  is adaptive insofar as it promotes continuity and functioning and is otherwise maladaptive . Evolution depends on these two kinds of normativity-genetic mutation  and  adaptation.  These  kinds  of  normativity  are  biologically fundamental,  based  on  scope  for  error.  Cell  respiration  is  disrupted  if sufficient oxygen fails to be delivered; defence mechanisms in a cell can mistake a virus for a metabolite or other signalling molecule; or elements detected  in  viral  particles  cause  the  human  immune  system  to  attack  a tissue  or  cell  which  would  normally  be  treated  as  self  and  not  subject to  immune  attack,  with  resultant  inflammatory  response  and  immune inflicted  damage,  up  to  and  including  cell  death.  Error  arises  in  many ways, one of which, just referred to, is that the competition can deceive by  mimicking,  from  viruses  on  upwards.  Life  and  diversity  are  closely linked, one upshot being that the same or diverse life forms typically end up in competition for finite energy resources. The competition exploits the possibility of error in information transfer that is fundamental to life

forms. All these goings on do not matter at all to the energy equations of physics and chemistry-everything conforms to them-but some do matter  to  the  biology,  hence  there  is  pervasive  use  for  normative  contrasts: 'functions well/badly' 'right'/'wrong', 'same'/'error', life/death, health/disease.

## Life Forms: Diversity Amidst the Physics

Living systems exploit slack-they find options within-physical laws. At the basic level of genes there are diverse complex molecules, all thermodynamically stable, consistent with physical, quantum-mechanical energy equations, but which are interestingly different, because they may have very different consequences for the organism, positive or negative. This much  transforms  the  explanatory  framework,  but  also  the  ontology, which includes not only physical material, but shapes or forms such as double helixes, with their novel causal properties of regulatory control, programming and replication.

The possibility  of  proliferation  of  forms  and  causal  potentials  within the constraints of physical, quantum-mechanical energy equations is well illustrated  in  the  genetic  code  and  genetic  replication,  but  it  has  wide application.  It  can  be  seen  already  in  chemistry,  in  the  diversity  of  the elements, in their diverse structures, resulting in variety in physical properties  (such  as  melting  and  boiling  points),  and  in  chemical  combinatorial  properties,  all  of  which  are  consistent  with  energy  equations.  All of the chemical elements, and the great diversity of their combinations, including  the  complex  molecules  in  biological  systems,  all  conform  to the equations-but the critical point is that the equations permit chemical diversity and complexity including those in biological processes.

Diversity  arises  from  increasing  complexity,  successions  of  combinations  of  parts  into  greater  wholes.  The  parts  essentially  interact  with one another-otherwise they would not make a whole thing, but would remain  isolated  separate  things.  The  wholes  become  parts  of  other wholes-and so on. This can be seen in physics, where subatomic particles interactively form into atoms, and in chemistry, where atoms compound into molecules. In biology, all the physics and chemistry continue to  apply,  but  new  phenomena  appear:  regulation  of  physico-chemical processes  by  coded  information-and  with  that,  especially  the  possibility of error. Concepts of error gain traction in relation to wider systems and functional ends of those systems-ultimately responsible for natural

biological systems being able-in local areas, temporarily-to avoid the general increase of entropy, to increase energy differences, to make more order out of less order.

The increasingly larger and more complex shapes, structures or forms , have distinctive new causal properties. Form here is dynamical, a matter of what the molecule, cell or membrane can do and does. for example, the fusion effects of intense gravity in collapsing stars make new things from hydrogen, metals such as iron, a new structure with new physical and  chemical  properties-and  among  the  elements  necessary  for  life. Once life gets going, diversity takes on a whole new meaning: countless new  structures,  forms,  complexity,  capacities  and  operating  principles. Biological processes exploit the physics and chemistry from the start, for example the physics of proton gradient across a cell membrane, or energy released  according  to  chemical  enthalpy  equations  in  Krebs'  cycle.  At the complex molecular level, shape (structure) is critical to distinguishing  them  and  determining  their  interactive  properties.  As  one  moves to  complex  organic  and  biochemical  molecules,  shape  is  increasingly exploited.  In  cellular  biology  for  example,  the  function  of  enzyme  catalysts turns on their shape and fit to relevant biochemical agents-as in 'lock and key' models. Biological forms not only conform to physics and chemical  energy  equations,  they  manage  the  energetic  processes,  with new principles of regulation and information flow. These biological principles operate in the very large spaces permitted by those energy equations, producing new forms on top of the physical elements and chemical combinations that those laws permit. And with the new forms come new operating principles, though what remains at their core are the original components:  the  need  for  energy,  for  preservation,  the  critical  importance of regulation and information flow.

The above issues are linked to the concept of 'emergence' which has a long history in the philosophy of biology and psychology, and systems theory generally. for review of the topic, see e.g. [8]. There are detailed treatments in recent philosophy of biology (e.g. [9, 10]).

The new biology, employing causal principles that turn on shape or form in relation to systemic ends, marks a radical departure from physicalism that has its roots in the seventeenth-century mechanisation of the world  picture.  These  developments  also,  as  is  well  known,  point  backwards  to  the  science  and  philosophy  that  preceded  the  development of  seventeenth-century  science,  specifically  to  Aristotle.  Aristotle  had  a broad vision of causation, comprising 4 kinds: material , efficient , formal

and final , arguing that formal and final causes were likely to be especially relevant to biological processes (see, e.g., Andrea falcon's critical review [11]).  The  new  seventeenth  mechanics,  however,  required-in  these terms-only the first two, while the second two dropped out of the science as redundant. When biological sciences developed in the nineteenth century,  research  programmes  emulated  the  natural  sciences,  discovering  the  chemistry  within  biological  processes.  However,  reducing  the phenomena to chemistry was not such a clear option for other parts of biology, especially study of the formation of whole organisms and whole species: embryology and evolutionary biology . These have always seemed to require concepts different from those in the natural sciences, more akin to Aristotle's formal and final causes.

It was always final or teleological explanation that was the most problematic for natural science. It seems to imply that the ends must in some way be already present at the start ,  and  it  has  been  assumed-notwithstanding Aristotle's original disavowal [11]-that this could only be so if the ends are in some way 'preconceived' by some purposive intelligence/ designer.  It  is  probably  true  that  teleological  explanation  of  a  change supposes that the end-conditions must somehow be present at the beginning, and it is also true that genes do not in any way 'have in mind' the proteins they produce. It is however exactly at this point that the information-processing paradigm does its conceptual work, because the genes encode (code for) the  proteins they produce. In this sense-the sense of encoding -the ends are already present at the start-and in this sense the information-processing  model  envisages-something  like-teleological explanation.  A  typical  explanation  in  the  information-processing  paradigm is that particular genes code for particular proteins. Needless to say much hangs  on  what  'code  for'  means.  But  what  it  does  not  mean  is that  some  protein-like  shape  already  exists  in  the  genes,  obviously  still less  that  the  genetic  material  has  a  mental  image  of  the  proteins  to  be produced.  Rather,  'code  for'  means:  in  normal  circumstances,  in  the normal  cellular  environment,  in  a  complex  series  of  interlocking  steps, such-and-such  DNA  sequence  produces  such-and-such  protein.  The coding concept secures the idea that the 'ends' are already present-in some sense-and are instrumental in production (under normal circumstances) of the end result. This dynamic, production sense of 'encoded information'  is  more  explicitly  captured  by  terms  like  'programme'  or 'instructions', with clearer implication of direction to an end, and connotes more clearly that the production process follows rules (if… then…)

that  are  not  inviolable  physico-chemical  laws  but  violable  metabolic regularities.

In summary, the information-processing paradigm in biology secures the fundamental point that the functional end of a system-the result it tends in normal circumstances to produce-is in a defined sense already present in the system prior to production, as instructions and a mechanism for the production. These kinds of principles of causal explanation involving forms and ends were anticipated by Aristotle, as was the insight that they are likely to apply particularly in biology.

The concept of genetic coding recreates a refined, scientific version of the idea that the ends are-as programming instructions-present at the start. No such idea, however, is implied by Darwin's theory: on the contrary,  evolution  as  envisaged  by  Darwin  does  not  admit  of  a  teleological type of explanation in any sense, but rather provides a quite different alternative  in  terms  of  random  genetic  mutation,  adaptation  and  natural  selection. Once natural (as opposed to human made) functional systems come into being, they admit of teleological explanation, expressed in  the  idea  that  states  of  biological  systems  encode-instructions  forproduction  processes.  Genes  coding  for  embryonic  development  is  a fundamental  example.  But  no  analogue  of  the  information-processing paradigm applies to evolution as a whole; the teleologic applies only to systems with design-forms suited to securing particular ends-that result from the evolutionary process, not to the evolutionary process itself.

## 2.2 the limitations of Physicalism

## Preamble and the Argument in Brief Lay Terms

This is  the  most  explicitly  philosophical  section  of  the  book  because  it addresses  positions  in  the  contemporary  analytic  philosophy  literature where  physicalism  holds  an  important  place.  The  whole  section  may be less accessible and of less interest to the reader without background knowledge  of  philosophy,  but  we  include  it  here  because  physicalism is  of  fundamental  importance  to  the  conceptualisation  of  the  sciences and  how  they  relate  to  one  another,  in  turn  therefore  of  fundamental importance to understanding the conceptual foundations of the biopsychosocial  model.  The  importance  of  physicalism  in  Engel's  original formulation  of  the  biomedical  model,  some  historical  expressions  of

physicalism,  and  the  recognition  by  current  commentators  of  the  need for distinctive biopsychosocial causal interactions-were reviewed as context for the general biopsychosocial model at the beginning of Sect. 1.3.

Physicalism in its clearest, strong version holds that everything that  there  is  and  all  causation  is  physical,  or,  alternatively  expressed: everything is physical, covered by physical laws. This doctrine exerts massive  downwards reductionist pressure on all other sciences: their ontology  and  their  causal  principles  ultimately  have  to  be  physical,  or  else illusionary.  Chemistry  passes  under  the  bar,  much  of  biology  is  physics  and  chemistry,  psychology  is  problematic,  and  social  science  even more so. All are  basically  bad  news  for  any  biopsychosocial  model.  Or the  other  way  round,  a  viable  biopsychosocial  model  is  bad  news  for physicalism.

The key step in the shift away from physicalism and physicalist reductionism occurs in current biology and has been examined in the previous  section.  In  brief,  current  biology  since  the  mid-twentieth  century envisages not only physical and chemical energetic processes but also regulatory  control  of  those  processes.  Crucially:  regulatory  control  mechanisms never contravene the energy equations of physics and chemistry (because  nothing  ever  does),  but  it  is  a  type  of  causation.  Regulatory control mechanisms are typically dynamical forms, the causal properties of which turn on shape as opposed to material constituent parts. This is clear  in  the  cosmic  prize-winning  case  of  the  complex  molecular  DNA double helix, and evident in the supporting cast of, for example, enzymes working  like  keys  in  locks.  from  here,  once  dynamical  life  forms  with regulatory control functions take off from the physics and chemistry of the matter, from compliance with energy equations alone, they become ever more complex and diverse in evolution, to include eventually psychological and social phenomena. There are certainly reasons to distinguish regulatory control by genes and enzymes from regulatory control by nervous systems, from regulatory control by social rules and regulations, but the key thing from a philosophical point of view is that they can all be conceptualised under this very general heading, they can causally  interact,  and  especially,  they  are  not  tied  down  by,  though  always compliant with, the energy equations of physics and chemistry. In short, the ontology and causal theory of current biology can envisage psychological and social processes, making the biopsychosocial model viable.

This,  in  brief,  is  the  argument  we  propose  to  work  around  physicalism.  The  rest  of  the  section  is  more  philosophically  technical  and detailed.

## Physicalism

Physicalism  and  related  reductionism  have  been  extensively  discussed in  contemporary  analytic  philosophy  during  the  past  few  decades.  It would be fair to say that they are mainstream views, but also challenged, defended  and  modified.  While  the  challenges  are  substantial,  it  would be fair to say, nevertheless, that physicalism has no serious competitors, no  viable,  large  scale  alternatives.  Such  alternatives  as  are  envisaged  in this mainstream  literature,  the  philosophies  to  which  physicalism  is opposed-dualism  and  vitalism-are  historical  and  long  discredited  in the science. We suggest that contemporary alternatives are to be found in current biological theory, key features of which, it will be argued in subsequent chapters, carry into psychology and behavioural science.

In broad terms, physicalism is the view that everything is physical and there is nothing else besides. This ontology most obviously would comprise  a  view  as  to  causation  and  causal  laws,  namely,  that  all  causation and  all  causal  laws  are  physical,  or  another  way  of  putting  this:  'physics  explains  everything'.  This  would  seem  to  follow  clearly  enough: since  there  are  only  physical  events,  there  are  only  physical  events  to explain, so the only explanations are physical. Or again: physical things have  physical  causal  powers,  and  therefore,  since  there  are  only  physical  things,  there are only physical causal powers. The matters of ontology and causation should probably be tied together in a tight knot. If there  seemed  to  be  only  physical  things,  and if we  had  only  physical causal explanations, then the physicalist metaphysics would stay as simple as this. The broad problem for physicalism is just that these two conditions have never held. It has never seemed like there were only physical things,  and  never  that  we  explained  everything  by  physics.  The  ontological problem was and remains easily enough disposed of by saying: it may seem that there are many kinds of non-physical things-animation, perceptions-but these are only appearances, and they are really physical things, or just appearances, and not real after all. Similar moves can be made about apparent causes and effects, especially mind over body: the causation is illusory, or really physical.

The  one  place  at  which  this  imperious  dogmatising  falters  is  where apparently  non-physical  entities  and  causal  processes  are  invoked  by empirical sciences, finding associations and following methods for determination of causes  articulated  by  Mill.  Just  as  the  real  backing  for  the mechanisation  of  the  world  picture  and  the  beginnings  of  physicalism was  success  of  the  science,  mechanics,  it  can  only  be  undermined  by more else of the same, i.e. more but different successful science. These new sciences  were  established  in  the  nineteenth  century  with  advances through the twentieth: chemistry, biology, psychology, social scienceswith all their large and small sub-fields.

As these new sciences developed, physicalism becomes entangled with reductionism : the assumption that, and the project of trying to show that, these new sciences can be reduced to physics; meaning, that their ontology and causal principles can or could ultimately be eliminated in favour of  the  physical.  Such  strong  reduction-in  an  ideal  physicalist  world, elimination-known  as,  for  example,  semantic-  or  theory-  reduction, has not however fared well. It does well in chemistry, in parts of physiology, struggles seriously in psychology, and is hopeless in social science. As  noted  in  Sect. 1.3,  under  the  heading 'Theorising  Biopsychosocial Interactions-Not  Parallel  Worlds',  by  around  the  1970s,  something of a halt was called, with acknowledgement that the sciences apart from physics-chemistry, over and above them, what fodor called the 'Special Sciences',  could  not  be  reduced/eliminated,  and  there  were,  after  all, causal concepts and principles, over and above those of physics [12-14]

That might have spelt the end of physicalism, except for the option, unattractive but needs must, of disconnecting ontology from causation and causal explanation. Physicalism could be retained as a view of what stuff  there  is-only  physical-while  acknowledging  that,  where  theory or semantic reductionism fails, there are constructs of non-physical entities,  processes  and  causes  in  the  sciences  above  physics-chemistry. This  depleted  version  of  physicalism  as  an  ontological  doctrine  onlynot  about  causes-has  a  corresponding  weaker  reductionist  doctrine, called ontological ,  or metaphysical ,  without  commitment to epistemological or explanatory reduction ,  and  the  combination  is  sometimes  called 'non-reductive physicalism' [see, e.g., 15]. Insofar as this weaker form of Physicalism is an ontological claim only, involving no claims about causal explanations, it probably has given up on being much or anything to do with the sciences, and becomes a purely 'metaphysical' doctrine.

As  suggested  above,  however,  the  move  of  separating  off  ontology from  causation  is  very  awkward,  requiring  as  it  does  a  conception  of things (entities, properties or processes) somehow independent of what they do, independent of their causal powers and interactions. The awkwardness shows up in various related ways. Consider mental states, the traditional  anomaly  for  physicalism:  if-in  the  ontological  version  of physicalism-they are allowed to be causal, connected by psychological principles not physical laws, what account can be given of their ontological status-given that the assumption that the only ontology is physical?

The basic problem is not ontological however-we can say what we like  about  what  there  is,  if  this  makes  no  commitment  to  causal  properties-rather,  the  basic  problem  involves  theorising  causation.  While non-reductive  physicalism  seeks  to  acknowledge  non-physical  causes,  it still  retains physical causal laws, implicitly including a massive theory of causation, but since these physical laws cover all physical processes, and since these are the only events that there are, then the difficult question arises: where is there any room for causation by anything else, by mental events  for  example  (whatever  may  be  their  curious  ontological  status)? The ontological issues in contemporary physicalism are often theorised in terms of 'supervenience' and the conundrum in the theory of causation as to how there can be mental causes as well as physical causes is sometimes called the 'dual causation' or 'causal overdetermination' problem (see, e.g., [16, 17]).

The  many  types  of  physicalist  'reductionism'  that  have  had  to  be invoked in this philosophical literature, outlined above, indicate just how much it  has  struggled  to  survive  in  the  current  scientific  climate.  The depleted version left at the end is ontological only, seeking to subtract commitments  on  causality,  although  actually  retaining  the  assumption that physical causation covered by physical laws is the only kind. It is this assumed  'completeness  of  physics'  that  actually  delivers  the  core,  best argument for physicalism, and we consider it next.

## Regulatory Mechanisms Do Not Affect Energy Equations

There is a core argument for physicalism based on the so-called causal completeness of physical. This argument is for a strong form of physicalism in that sense that it would prohibit the idea of any non-physical cause  making  a  difference  to  energy  and  energy  exchanges  of  physical  material.  Here  is  the  philosopher  David  Papineau  presenting  the

argument, in several stages corresponding to historical developments in the science [18] (p. 9):

In the middle of the nineteenth century the conservation of kinetic plus potential energy came to be accepted as a basic principle of physics… In itself this does not did rule out fundamental mental or vital forces… but … does imply that any such special forces must be governed by strict deterministic laws to ensure they never led to energy increases.

During  the  course  of  the  twentieth  century  received  scientific  opinion became even more restrictive about possible causes of physical effects, and came to reject sui generis mental or vital causes, even of a law governed and predictable kind. Detailed physiological research, especially into nerve cells, gave no indication of any physical effects that cannot be explained in terms of basic physical forces that also occur outside living bodies. By the middle of the twentieth century, belief in sui generis mental or vital forces had become a minority view. This led to the widespread acceptance of the doctrine now known as the 'causal closure' or the 'causal completeness of the physical', according to which all physical effects have fully physical causes.

This is a powerful argument in favour of physicalism. Tracking the science,  it  successfully  excludes  non-physical  forces  capable  of  making energy  differences.  Physicalism  wins  if  the  opposing  team  is  'spooky' energy-exchanging forces, as in dualism and vitalism.

Current biology and biomedicine, however, go off at a tangent to this problematic. As outlined in the preceding section, the new life sciences envisage  distinctive  forms,  structures  and  information-based  regulatory control  mechanisms-in  addition  to  energy  exchanges  and  conservation covered by the equations of physics. However, and of course, this departure from physics respects the physical energy equations. In short, there are distinctive biological structures and causes-regulatory mechanisms-but they don't interfere with the physics; they exploit the physics, rely on it, manage it-but they don't change it.

Consider the analogy of a chemical industrial plant running, for example,  the  Haber process for production of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen. The model of the process certainly includes the core chemical reactions and the associated enthalpy (energy) equations. However, for the chemical reaction to run at all, to run forwards and not too much backwards, the hydrogen and nitrogen have to be present in quantities in an appropriate range, at temperature and pressure high enough, though

not too high for the containers, aided by the presence of catalysts. The model  of  all  this  includes  regulatory  control  mechanisms  for  delivery and removal of materials, temperature and pressure control, etc. Several points can be noted:

first, the regulatory control mechanisms never affect energy exchange equations and never flout the principle of conservation of energy. They obviously don't because nothing does-but in any case they don't.

Second, the chemical reactions can occur outside the factory. Equally the basic energy exchange physico-chemical reactions in, for example, biological cells could occur outside of cells.

Third,  as  a  qualification,  in  both  cases,  they  only  occur-inside  or outside  the  factory-if  the  necessary  reactants  come  together  in  a particular  sequence,  particular  amounts,  at  particular  temperatures, etc.  Bringing  this  about-in  the  chemical  industrial  factory,  as  in the  biological  cell-requires  substantial  organisational  and  control mechanisms.

The physical/chemical energy equations cover some aspects of the Haber process: how much energy is absorbed or produced, etc. The principles of regulatory control model other aspects, answering questions such as: 'how is the rate of reaction kept within a range, so as not to run too fast or too hot?', 'Why does this gate shut at this time, cutting off the supply  of  hydrogen?'  There  will  be  a  physical  process  that  shuts  the  gate, but, if the gate shutting is part of a regulatory mechanism (is indeed a 'gate  shutting'),  it  will  involve  a  physical  process  that  can  'go  wrong'. for example, the gate has a particular shape, and the process that shuts it may be the arrival of an object which fits it like a key; the key turning in the lock is a physical process, and it does not violate any physical equations,  because  nothing  does,  but  the  process  is  also  a  regulatory  one, signified by the fact that it can go wrong, because for example the key has a fault in it, or because there are competitor saboteurs at work with fake  keys.  Models  of  regulatory  control  mechanisms  are  distinct  from physico-chemical equations covering energy exchanges; they are a different kind of causal-explanatory framework, suited to different processes, answering different sorts of question.

As a corollary, there is no problem of 'dual causation' or 'causal overdetermination'.  In  the  present  context  the  problem  would  be:  how  can

a  regulatory  mechanism  cause  anything  when  all  the  causing  is  already accomplished by physical events covered by physical laws? But the problem doesn't arise because regulatory mechanisms do not concern energy exchanges covered by physical laws. Nowhere in these models (in chemical engineering or biology) is the same process being causally explained twice.

The benefits  of  models  of  causation  by  regulatory  control  extend  to promoting research questions, supporting predictions, enabling control, diagnosis of dysfunctions and fixing things. for example, if the model of regulatory  control  of  a  chemical  factory  includes  that  a  particular  gate opens or closes depending on the rate of reaction relative to parameters of temperature and pressure, the model can be used to predict when the gate will open or close. The model also prompts a research programme to investigate the mechanisms by which the gate is sensitive within certain ranges to the rate of reaction, temperature and pressure. If the plant blows up, we want to know why. Generally, the model guides understanding of dysfunction or breakdown. If, for example, the reaction is running too hot, becoming inefficient or raising risk of meltdown-the model tells us  that  one  cause  might  be  malfunctioning  of  a  gate,  for  example,  the hinges are rusted, or the thermostatic devices regulating its function are malfunctioning. We can also use the model to intervene, for example, in the case of dysfunction one might fix the rust or the regulatory feedback mechanism. Use of such models is obvious enough in chemical engineering and the analogues pervade physiology and biomedicine.

It  may  be  objected:  'but  factories  have  designs  that  promote  functional  ends,  but  they  are  human  built-not  natural  systems'.  But  this is  a  pre-Darwinian thought. Natural systems, biological ones, have this kind of design-regulatory control mechanisms-resulting from random mutation and natural selection.

Causation by regulatory control has distinctive properties, among the most  curious  of  which  is  causation  by  events  that  don't  happen!  This phenomenon has been theorised in current philosophy of causation and is taken up below. first we give reasons why the weakest form of physicalism, really limited to an ontological claim only, without any presumption about causation, is unattractive.

## Weaker-Ontological Only-Physicalism Is Problematic

In their Stanford Encyclopedia entry on Supervenience, Brian McLaughlin and Karen Bennett, in the section titled 'Coincident Entities

and the 'Grounding Problem'', consider the classic example of a lump of clay (Lumpl) later fashioned into a statue (Goliath), which have different modal properties-such as that the one survives being squashed into a ball while the other does not-which seems to entail they are different things [19] (p. 51), continuing:

The main objection to the view that Goliath and Lumpl are distinct is what can be called 'the grounding problem'. How can Lumpl and Goliath differ in their modal properties, given that they are alike in every other way? What grounds their difference in persistence conditions? In virtue of what do they have the persistence conditions they do?

The obvious way in which the lump of clay and the statue are the same is that they are made of the same material. The obvious way they differ is  in  shape  or  form.  According  to  the  view  we  have  argued  for  in  this chapter,  shape  or  form,  over  and  above  material  composition,  can  be of  critical  importance  in  determining  causal  properties.  This  is  less  evident in the classic lump of clay/statue example, because statues do not have standout causal powers over and above those due to their material composition. However, if we shift the example to the DNA double-helix dynamical form, which, in its normal operating environment, has amazing causal properties such as replication and coding for protein production. These properties could be reasonably called 'emergent' in the sense that  they  are  not  evident  in  the  formless,  unorganised  higher  entropic sum of its elements.

This line of thought implies that the very weak form of physicalism as an ontological claim only, about 'metaphysical grounding', is bound to be deficient. Shamik Dasgupta writes [20] (p. 557):

It has been suggested that many philosophical theses-physicalism, nominalism, normative naturalism, and so on-should be understood in terms of ground… What is physicalism? Not just physicalism about the mind, but physicalism period. What kind of a thesis is it? We know what the rough picture is: at some basic level the world is constituted wholly out of physical stuff, and everything else-football matches, string quartets, consciousness, values, numbers-somehow 'arises out of' that physical stuff. Or, to use other locutions, everything else is 'fixed by' or 'determined by' or 'is nothing over and above' that physical stuff. Or, as the metaphor goes, all God had to do when making the world was make the physical stuff, and then her job was done.

The  last  sentence  seems  to  imply  that  nothing  interesting,  or  nothing at  all,  has  happened  since  the  fraction  of  second  after  the  Big  Bangor,  staying  with  its  metaphor,  the  sentence  neglects  what  God  made on all the other days. The formations and phases of stars, formation of elements, metals, complex molecules, conditions for life on at least one planet,  the  whole  evolutionary  process  of  organisms  and  of  mammals and primates-have what status according to this metaphysical grounding  thesis?  Presumably  the  grounding  thesis  allows  that  such  things exist,  now  or  past,  but  limits  itself  to  a  claim  about  what  these  things are constituted out of, and this in a highly reductive sense, which recognises only what is common between hydrogen and iron for example, and not  their  differences  including  their  different  combinatorial  and  causal properties; or again which admits only what is common between metallic iron and biological tissue, not their differences, including their different  causal  properties,  such  as  that  metallic  iron  contains  no  regulatory mechanisms,  but  biological  tissue  does.  However,  Dasgupta  supposes that  this  minimalist  ontology  can  have  explanatory  value,  indeedcuriously-'full' explanatory value [20] (p. 558):

To say that some facts ground another is just to say that the former explain the  latter,  in  a  particular  sense  of  'explain'.  When  I  say  that  some  facts ground another, I mean that the former fully explain the latter.

'fully  explain'  is  too  strong  however,  if  we  wish  to  explain  not  only the  material  similarity  between  hydrogen,  iron  and  biological  cells  but also the differences in their causal properties. It can be said that specifying  what  material  something  is  made  of  explains  it  to  some  extentthough probably  only  because  its  causal  properties  are  being  assumed, for  example  mechanical  properties  of  physical  matter;  but  there  are  so many  other  things  and  causal  properties  to  explain,  such  as  chemical combinatorial possibilities and properties that turn on structure, or systemic functioning that turns on achieving or maintaining end states. In short,  there  is  need  for  a  principled  variety  of  kinds  of  explanation,  of which Aristotle's typology of causes, briefly reviewed at the end of the preceding section,  is  the  original.  In  those  terms,  physicalism  can  be regarded as a weak ontological claim only, specifying the material cause of  everything as physical. In these terms there are however in addition efficient causes, an approximate example being the operation of mechanical forces, and formal and final causes (dynamical forms that tend to an

end-state)  that  have  a  particular  explanatory  role  to  play  in  modelling biological systems.

## Causation by Events That Don't Happen

Recent  novel  philosophical  analyses  of  causation  have  drawn  attention to  the  curious  fact  that  some  causal  pathways  involve  events  that  do not happen! This is a very clear sign of causation that does not involve energy transfer.

Jonathan Schaffer begins his paper titled 'Causation by Disconnection' like this [21] (p. 285):

It  is  widely  believed  that  causation  requires  a connection from  cause  to effect,  such  as  an  energy  flow.  But  there  are  many  ways  to  wire  a  causal mechanism.  One  way  is  to  have  the  cause  connect  to  the  effect,  but another is to have the cause disconnect what was blocking the effect.

Using  the  example  of  a  bomb  detonation  mechanism,  Schaffer  points out that it can be wired in various ways, including: pressing the button generates an electrical current which connects to the bomb and makes it explode, or pressing the button disconnects an electrical current that was  inhibiting  an  independent  source  from  triggering  the  explosion. Schaffer  notes  the  similarities  between  this  latter  case  of  causation  by disconnection  and  other  recent  approaches  to  causation,  such  as  Ned Hall's on causation by 'double prevention', involving absence of events or 'negative' causation [22, 23]. In short, this recent philosophical work identifies  a  kind  of  causal  connection-variously  identified  as  'disconnection', 'negative', 'double prevention'-that is not a matter of energy flow.

The important point for our present purpose is that the examples of this  other  kind  of  causal  connection  all  involve functional  mechanisms , whether artefacts, or natural, biological systems. Schaffer uses detonator wiring  diagrams,  but  the  footnote  explaining  the  diagram  conventions refer  to  neuronal  firing  or  not-firing,  stimulatory  and  inhibitory  connections [21] (p. 286n). In other words, we are dealing here with biological causation .  James Woodward in his Making Things Happen notes that  there  are  many  scientific  examples  of  causation  by  double  prevention, particularly in biology, giving as illustration Jacob and Monod's lac operon model for Escherichia coli , noting that biologists describe this as a

case of 'negative control' [24] (pp. 225-226). This clearly illustrates that causation by double prevention is situated within the explanatory paradigm of regulatory control so far outlined.

The idea of causal pathways that involve absences of events is probably  tied  inextricably  to  the  systems  theoretic  concepts  of  functioning towards ends and contributions of part functioning to whole functioning. In this context whole functioning will depend on whether inputs are or are not received from another part, and both cases are of interest. So, for example, closing of a gate and the consequent cessation of delivery of a chemical into a chemical reaction container, is as interesting as the gate being open-otherwise there would be no point in using the term 'gate'. Distinctions like open/closed, happens/doesn't happen are integral to the normativity of regulatory control, and they have no analogue in physico-chemical laws/equations covering energy exchanges.

The critical point is that all these curious kinds of explanations posited in  recent  philosophical  work  on  causation-'disconnection',  'negative', 'double  prevention'-are  to  be  distinguished  from  causal  connections that rely on energy transformation and conservation. The standard philosophical  view  about  causation  has  been  to  emphasise  this  latter  kind of  causal  connection.  Schaffer  [21]  (p.  286)  attributes  this  standard view  widely,  to  Wesley  Salmon,  Phil  Dowe,  Peter  Menzies  and  David Armstrong. In a strong form, the proposal is to limit causal processes as those that transmit conserved quantities-the clearest example of which is energy in physics. The new work in philosophy of causation is consistent with the approach we have taken in this chapter, which distinguishes regulatory  control  from  energy  transformations  and  conservation  covered by physical equations.

## Philosophy of Biology Notes

Recent philosophy of biology has focussed on systems theoretic concepts and principles, such as ( dynamical ) systems/mechanisms , part/whole relationships  and complexity .  Books  include  William  Bechtel  and  Robert  C. Richardson's Discovering  Complexity:  Decomposition  and  Localization as  Strategies  in  Scientific  Research [10];  Sandra  D.  Mitchell's Biological Complexity  and  Integrative  Pluralism [25];  and  William  C.  Wimsatt's Re engineering Philosophy for Limited Beings -[9]. This is a very rich literature dealing with many topics in philosophy of biology, including those few covered here, in much more detail, and with many examples.

The different focus here is the philosophy of biology as it defines key conceptual features of the first component of the biopsychosocial, especially  to  bring  out  that  the  key  conceptual  features  of  current  biology open  up  the  way  to  a  coherent  view  of  biopsychosocial  ontology  and causation  appropriate  for  the  biopsychosocial  model  of  health  and  disease.  for  this  purpose  we  have  emphasised  the  relation  of  biology  to physics-chemistry  and  especially  the  fundamental  role  of  information as  well  as  energy,  the  theory  started  by  Erwin  Schrödinger,  picked  up by  Ludwig  von  Bertalanffy,  and  used  in  contemporary  biophysics  and genetics by for example Nick Lane and Siddhartha Mukherjee. Generally this  line  of  thought  has  not  been  the  focus  in  philosophy  of  biology. Moreover, there are some signs of antipathy towards it in the mainstream philosophical literature, directed against the core notion of information , as considered next.

## Biological Information Is Semantic (Capable of Error)

We  noted at some  length in Sect. 2.1, under the heading 'Error Is fundamental to Biology', that normativity, including the possibility of error, is  fundamental  to  biological  regulatory  control  mechanisms.  Normativity  is however  entirely  anomalous  for  physicalism.  Physicalism  envisages  only  the few physical qualities, related to mass, momentum, energy-and it especially doesn't  envisage  any  of  the  family  that  includes  ( semantic ) information or intentionality , characterises by aboutness or directness , and the possibility of error . Here for example is Jerry fodor [26] (p. 97):

The deepest motivation for intentional irrealism derives… from a certain ontological intuition: that there is no place for intentional categories in a physicalist view of the world; that the intentional can't be naturalised.

This  ontological  intuition  is  correct:  biological  information,  bound  up with regulation and the possibility of error, has no place in the physicalist view  of  the  world,  assuming  this  envisages  only  energy  exchanges  and the physical laws/equations that govern them. Hence there is enormous pressure  from  physicalism  to  disqualify  or  down-grade  the  information-processing  paradigm  in  biology,  specifically  to  deny  the  possibility of error. This is actually quite difficult to do since subtract informationprocessing  concepts,  always  involving  normativity,  from  contemporary biology textbooks and there is practically nothing left.

The  disqualification  move  is  especially  unattractive  in  the  case  of genes and genetic information. This suggests a compromise of limiting error-prone  information  to  genes.  Here  for  example  is  Paul  Griffiths [27] (p. 295):

There is a genetic code by which the sequence of DNA bases in the coding regions of a gene corresponds to the sequence of amino acids in the primary structure of one or more proteins… The rest of 'information talk' in biology is no more than a picturesque way to talk about correlation and causation.

Such  a  concession  is  philosophically  pointless  however;  it  only  takes  a single exception-though in this case by the way a massive one (genetics/life)-to disprove the metaphysical claim that there is no error-prone information in nature.

Another  possibility is to envisage semantic  information  processing  in  the  mind-brain  but  not  elsewhere  in  biology,  except  perhaps, again,  in  genes.  William  Bechtel  [28]  for  example  highlights  the  concept  of  information  in  the  stronger  semantic  sense  in  modelling  the mind/brain. In a section entitled Mental Mechanisms: Mechanisms That Process Information ,  Bechtel  argues  that  biological  phenomena  such  as cellular  respiration  'can  be  adequately  characterised  as  involving  physical  transformations  of  material  substances'  [28]  (p.  22),  while  'mental mechanisms  are  ones  that  can  be  investigated  taking  a  physical  stance (examining neural structures and their operations) but also, distinctively and  crucially,  taking  an  information  processing  stance'  [28]  (p.  23). In  this  discussion,  Bechtel  qualifies  the  proposal  that  sub-mental/neuronal biology has no information processing, making an exception, like Griffiths as quoted above, of genetics [28] (p. 22n).

However,  the  information-processing  and  with  it  the  possibility  of error in genes, and also in the brain, are not biological exceptional cases, but are rather the rule. The same applies all over the body-for example, to the endocrine system's management of many internal functions, described for example here [29]:

The endocrine system is a network of glands that secrete chemicals called hormones  to  help  your  body  function  properly.  Hormones  are  chemical signals  that  coordinate  a  range  of  bodily  functions.  The  endocrine  system works to regulate certain internal processes… and systems [such as]

growth and development, homeostasis (the internal balance of body systems), metabolism (body energy levels), reproduction, response to stimuli (stress and/or injury).

And-evident in the endocrine disorders-it can all go wrong.

## 2.3 current biomedicine is conducive to the bioPsychosocial model

Consider  again  Engel's  characterisation  of  the  Biomedical  Model  [30] (p. 130):

The biomedical model embraces both reductionism, the philosophic view that  complex  phenomena  are  ultimately  derived  from  a  single  primary principle, and mind-body dualism, the doctrine that separates the mental from the  somatic.  Hence  the  reductionist  primary  principle  is  physicalistic; that is, it assumes that the language of chemistry and physics will ultimately suffice to explain biological phenomena.

Engel  uses  the  term  'reductionism'  in  this  passage  in  two  senses:  the first is commitment to there being a single primary principle explaining complex phenomena, specifically a biological principle; the second has to do with the reduction of biology to physics and chemistry. The line of thought in this chapter counts against the complete reduction of biology to  physics  and  chemistry,  though  retains  partial  reduction.  Much  biology relies on the energy exchanges determined by quantum mechanical and chemical combinatorial enthalpy equations. However, these energy exchanges have to be controlled, as do all other biological processes, by regulatory mechanisms involving information transfer. Biology and biomedicine in the last half-century have developed as an exquisite combination of these two kinds of science.

Interestingly,  Engel  recognised  the  fundamental  role  of  the  new information science in medicine in his 'foreword' [31] to the book on the subject by foss and Rothenberg [32]; he acknowledged the shortcomings  of  the  term  'biopsychosocial',  which  emphasises  structural boundaries  rather  than  integration,  and  welcomed  the  authors'  term 'infomedical'.  However  while  the  thinking  behind  these  considerations was sound, this terminology has not caught on, at least not as a replacement for 'biopsychosocial'.

from the systems theory point of view there is no reason at all to quarrel  with  the  partial  reduction  of  biology  to  physics  and  chemistry,  evidenced in scientific research programmes to determine the biophysics and biochemistry of, for example, cell metabolism or blood oxygen transport. A connected point, nor is there any reason to regard biomedicine as anything other than a scientific medical research programme with a remarkably successful track record. The general direction of biomedical research programmes from the mid-nineteenth century was towards study of internal organs and systems, penetrating beneath, literally inside, the complex presentations of signs and symptoms of disease, and beyond that, deeper inside  the  bodily  organs  and  systems,  to  the  structure  and  functioning of  cells  and  the  underlying  chemistry  of  molecular  processes.  Research strategies  shifted  away  from  traditional  naturalistic  observational  methods  towards  laboratory  based  experimentation,  requiring  elucidation  of experimental methods to determine causation, famously developed in the mid-nineteenth century by Robert Koch in his postulates for use in the new microbiology. Resounding successes in control of infectious diseases and the development of penicillin were followed by many further developments from the mid-twentieth century, in new sciences such as clinical genetics and neuroscience, and new treatment technologies (e.g. [33]).

Biomedical  research  from  the  middle  of  the  nineteenth  century  led the  way  in  understanding  the  basic  physics  and  chemistry  of  biological  processes,  but  to  this  it  can  be  added  that  since  the  mid-twentieth century  it  has  also  been  at  the  cutting  edge  of  that  whole  new  aspect of  biology  involving  information-based  regulatory  control  mechanisms, the fallibility of which is fundamental to the understanding of disease. In short, and of course, nothing does 'the biological' better than biomedicine. So if the biopsychosocial model wants to include the best concerning the first in its triumvirate, it had better aim to include biomedicine.

On the other  hand,  in  addition,  there  are  also  all  the  other  aspects of  health,  disease  and  health  care  that  have  come  to  light  or  prominence  over  the  same  period  of  the  last  few  decades,  outlined  in  Sect. 1.1, which require more than biomedical science. Such as, the epidemiology of social determinants of health, the increasing relative prevalence of non-communicable diseases compared with infectious diseases, raising issues  of  adjustment  and  quality  of  life  with  chronic  health  conditions, and broader social changes which have put patient rights and autonomy at the forefront of practice.

This  raises  the  issue  of  the  second  type  of  reductionism  that  Engel attributed  to  the  biomedical  model  in  the  above  quotation:  reducing complex phenomena to the biological alone. While biology was supposed to reduce to physics and chemistry, and while this supposition had a priori support from physicalism, it would follow fast without much thought that the explanation of diseases, like everything else, would ultimately be in terms of biology = physics and chemistry. Within the confines of physicalism,  the  possibility  of  distinctive  psychological  or  social  explanatory principles can hardly arise. Conversely, it does arise in a post-physicalist thought space that can envisage psychological and social factors as candidate explanations, as well as biological. In this context, the biomedical assumption that there is  a  primary  biological  cause  becomes  an  empirical  bet,  without  a  priori,  metaphysical/ideological  support.  The  bet  is that illnesses have a biological cause-explaining 'most' of the outcome variance. Whether this is true in any given type of illness is a matter for research,  and  we  already  know  enough  to  say  that  it  is  not  true  of  all illnesses-and  not  at  every  stage.  This  refers  to  the  emerging  evidence implicating psychosocial factors reviewed briefly at the beginning of Sect. 1.2.

What  is  required  to  comprehend  psychosocial  reality  and  causation is  a  post-physicalist  framework  that  can  accommodate more than physics  and  chemistry.  But  this  is  exactly  what  is  opened  up  by  the  recent paradigm shift in biology and biomedicine that we have been considering.  The  main  point  is  that  fundamental  biological  phenomena-form or  structure,  functioning  towards  ends,  regulatory  control  and  intersystemic information-transfer-complexify and diversify into what we call the psychological and the social. As noted at the end of the first chapter, under  the  heading 'Developing  the  General  Model',  the  evolution  of life forms ends up with human psychological and social phenomena, but 'ends up with', as currently understood in the science, is not a matter of logic or scientific law, but is entirely contingent-accidental. The original biological function is to maintain biological life, and this preoccupation carries  through  to  the  psychological  and  the  social.  However,  psychological  life  has  conditions  in  addition  to  biological  life-agency  and recognition-and all these matters are managed in forms of social organisation  and  control.  further,  all  kinds  of  biopsychosocial  functioning, once we leave the physics and chemistry, are liable to error, vulnerable, illness  prone.  This  expansion  into  the  biopsychosocial  conditions  of health and disease is the business of the remaining chapters.

A caveat before closing this section: it is clear that there is in the mix a  fourth  ingredient  as  well  as  the  biological,  psychological  and  social, namely,  'the  environment'.  Having  our  environment  identified  solely  as 'social'  is  no  use  at  all,  not  in  general,  not  in  any  of  the  life  and  health sciences.  Conceptually  from  basic  genetics  and  cell  biology  upwards,  it makes  no  sense  to  model  living  processes  except  in  relation  to  interactions with the environment. This is also the clear context of Schrödinger's linkage  between  life  and  the  second  law  of  thermodynamics.  Certainly it has been clear to the public health physicians that for good health we need  food,  water,  accommodation.  The  'biological'  and  biomedicine imply  conditions  and  interactions  with  the  non-social,  physico-chemical environment. However, at the current time 'the environment' demands explicit  acknowledgement in any proposed general model of health and disease  because  of  the  many  urgent  environmental  challenges  we  face: threats  to  global  temperature  stability,  to  energy,  water  and  food  security, with their impacts on health, and their interactions with social policy. This reflects the increasing importance of geography and environmental sciences, filling the gap historically created in the historical three-way division between biological/physiological, psychological and social sciences.

## CHAPTER 3

## Psychology Regulates Activity in the Social World

Abstract Moving on from biology to psychology, we propose that the core  function  of  the  psychological  is agency .  This  conception  of  the psychological in the new reworked biopsychosocial theory is consistent with  current  psychology  and  neuroscience,  for  example  the  so-called  4 Es  model  of  cognition  as embodied , embedded , enactive and extended . Agency has conditions in the social and political domains-signified by concepts of autonomy and recognition-the failure of which can jeopardise  the  perception  and  exercise  of  agency  and  hence  psychological  health.  The  third  component  of  the  biopsychosocial-the  social-is defined within this framework as essentially to do with control and distribution  of  the  resources  necessary  for  biological  and  psychological life.  The  main  theme  of  biopsychosocial  interactions  threads  through the chapter, including theorising the notorious (for reductionism) 'topdown'  causal  pathways.  This  chapter  aims  to  provide  a  framework  to understand how factors involved in health and disease, particularly in the contexts of public health, and managing with long-term conditions, are increasingly seen to extend beyond the internal biological environment into the psychological, social, economic and political conditions of living.

## 3.1 the Psychological as embodied agency

## Mind Is Embodied

The decisive break from dualism in psychological science came with the development  of  the  information-processing  paradigm  from  around  the 1960s  onwards,  in  parallel  with  its  development  in  biology.  The  paradigm ties together the biological and the psychological. Biology as physiology and anatomy deals with the body inside the skin, while psychology as  behavioural science models functioning of the whole organism in its external  environment,  regulated  and  controlled  by  the  central  nervous system. The complexity of living beings increases massively in phylogenesis and ontogenesis and for human beings in maturity, behavioural science  becomes  psychology,  and  the  information-processing  paradigm is  alternatively  called  the  'cognitive  paradigm'.  The  paradigm  shift  was gradual: the early cognitive models were not primarily biological, relying on concepts like computation (operations on symbols), and representations, as if of some independent reality already there fixed. Subsequently, the  models  have  become  more  biological,  using  models  of  embodied cognition involved with action [1-3].

Recent  developments  include  4E  cognition  [4],  which  characterises cognition in these four interconnected terms:

- 1.    'Embodied' (in the body)
- 2.    'Embedded' (in the environment; in causal loops with it)
- 3.    'Enactive'  (Acting  in  and  manipulating the environment, directly, not  via  a  representation  or  model;  the  environment  offers  affordances, or opportunities, for action and manipulation)
- 4.    'Extended'  (Extended  to  the  body  and  environment,  including devices used for cognitive functioning).

Embodied cognition  involves  the  whole  body,  is  action-based,  dynamical, involving  feedback  loops,  comprising  sensory  inputs,  cognition as  prediction,  affect,  decision,  motor  planning,  modification  by  experience, and so on, all fundamentally in the service of action in the environment. The new approach is biopsychological but the psychological soon merges-along with the biological-into the social, because the environment is for us substantially social. The fundamental connection between cognitive and social processes, involving such as attention, memory and

thought, was identified in the 1920s by the psychologist Lev Vygotsky [5]. Social, interpersonal processes pervade the aspects of cognition identified by the new 4E model (e.g. [6]).

This new view of the psychological can be called 'embodied agency' for short. The term captures two ideas that are fundamental themes in the biopsychosocial model being developed here: first, that the 'I' that knows, the psychological, is also (in) an object among others, a biological  body;  and,  second,  that  the  biopsychosocial  individual,  the  person, is  an  active,  causal  power.  The  broad  paradigm  of  embodied agency in the  current  science  constitutes  a  new  view  of  human  nature,  replacing the dualism that, while formulated in the seventeenth century, remained with great influence as psychological science emerged in the nineteenth century  into  the  twentieth  century.  The  new  approach  appeared,  as  is sometimes  the  case,  earlier  in  philosophy  than  in  the  science.  Critical concepts  relating  cognition  to  embodiment  and  action  appeared  in nineteenth-century  post-Kantian  philosophy,  especially  in  the  so-called phenomenological tradition, with clear, explicit expression by the mid-twentieth century in Maurice Merleau-Ponty's work [7].

The  concept  of  embodied  agency  is  fundamental  in  the  biopsychosocial  theory  of  health  and  disease.  It  links  physical  with  psychological health  and  implicates  pathways  between  them.  We  will  argue  that  psychological  health  depends  on  the  development  of  a  viable  enoughfor the person-sense of agency, such that, if this condition is not met, mental health is jeopardised, and so also, via complex biopsychological pathways,  is  physical  health.  The  conditions  of  embodied  agency  are biopsychosocial; they are drawn out through this chapter and their relevance to health through Chapter 4.

In  the  new  theoretical  approach  based  on  the  concept  of  embodied agency, the whole acting body is involved, but the nervous systems have a specific role in processing information, organisation, regulation and control. We quote below descriptions of the several nervous systems, in lay terms for the public, on the website of the Science Museum in London. The quotations,  which  are  under  the  main  heading  ' Who am I? ',  illustrate  the  current science moving into culture, and several key interconnected points relevant to the line of thought we are pursuing here: first, that  mind  and  body  are  thoroughly  involved  with  one  another,  replacing  mind-body  dualism;  second,  that  in  this  context  the  body  is  characterised  not  in  mechanical  terms,  but  in  terms  of  functional  processes involving  information  transfer  and  control;  third,  that  these  processes

are  not  limited  to  the  brain,  but  pervade  the  several  nervous  systems and their functional relationships that extend throughout the body and into  processes  that  we  do  not  think  of  as  mental  at  all  (such  as  digestion and temperature control). In short, mental functioning is entangled with biological functioning. The quotations from the Science Museum as follows [8]:

What does the central nervous system do? Your spinal cord receives information from the skin, joints and muscles of your body. It also carries the nerves  that  control  all  your  movements.  Your  brain  is  the  most  complicated  part  of  your  nervous  system.  It  receives  information  directly  from your ears, eyes, nose and mouth, as well as from the rest of your body via the spinal cord. It uses this information to help you react, remember, think and plan, and then sends out the appropriate instructions to your body.

What  does  the  peripheral  nervous  system  do?  Some  of  your  peripheral nervous  system  (PNS)  is  under  your  voluntary  control  -  the  nerves  that carry instructions from your brain to your limbs, for example. As well as controlling your muscles and joints, it sends all the information from your senses back to your brain. Other parts of your PNS are controlled by the brain  automatically.  This  is  the  autonomic  nervous  system.  It  manages some things your body does 'without thinking' like digestion and temperature control.

What  does  the  autonomic  nervous  system  do?  There  are  three  parts  to your autonomic nervous system: 1. The sympathetic system is responsible for  your  body's  'fight  or  flight'  reaction. 2.  The  parasympathetic  system looks after the workings of your body during rest and recuperation. It also controls your heart rate and body temperature under normal conditions. 3. The enteric system controls the workings of your gut.

The  radical  shift  in  thought  in  this  early  twenty-first  century  account of  'Who  am  I?'  compared  with  Descartes'  seventeenth-century  answer to  the  same  question  in  the Second Meditation can  be  readily  seen  [9] (pp. 75 and 112):

But what then am I? A thing that thinks. What is a thing which thinks? It is a thing which doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, which also imagines and senses.…

Because, on the one side I have a clear and distinct idea of myself, insofar  as  I  am  only  a  thinking  and  unextended  thing,  and  as,  on  the  other,

I  possess  a  distinct  idea  of  body,  inasmuch  it  is  only  an  extended  and unthinking thing, it is certain that this I… is entirely and absolutely distinct from my body, and can exist without it.

The  twenty-first-century  version,  by  contrast,  has  me  and  my  body entangled  together.  And,  connected,  my  body  is  far  from  'simply  an extended thing'; it is something more able to be a thing that thinks.

One implication of the radical shift from Cartesian dualism to the current science is that neural structures and activities become a new source of information for models of mental functioning .  Neuroscience is  a  new third epistemology of mind, adding to the two we already have: recognition  of  mentality  in  (the  regulation  of)  behaviour,  and  introspective reports  or  declarations.  Neuropsychological  findings  can  help  shape, for  example,  the  theory  of  colour  vision  [10],  and  models  of  memory [11]  (p.  71).  This  new  epistemology  has  major  application  in  the  theory of the extent to which psychological processes can affect   biological processes, interpreting this question as the extent to which central nervous  system  pathways,  especially  those  associated  with  modification  by voluntary  control  or  practice,  affect  biological  processes.  This  in  turn has  application  to  health-related  processes.  for  example,  pain  has  been shown  to  be  sensitive  to  central  as  well  as  peripheral  pathways  (to  be considered in Chapter 4, Sect. 4.2), while biologically original and fundamental  processes  such  as  cell  respiration  and  replication,  and  their dysfunctions, are probably not, nor the formation and travel of venous thromboembolisms.

The new model of embodied cognition include cognitive psychology and its well-known maxim, used to mark the contrast with behaviourism and  unreconstructed  conditioning  theory,  that  we  respond  to  the  environment as perceived by us, not to stimuli given absolutely. This is a point about human psychology, but there is a broader point that belongs to the information  processing  paradigm  generally,  namely,  that  biological  systemic functioning uses information detectors sensitive to specific kinds of signals  within  a  certain  range  that  is  relevant  to  functioning.  Biological systems  are  attuned  to  particular  salient  environmental  signals,  either genetically,  or,  as  a  result  of  learning,  as  modelled  in  behavioural  learning theory. This is a core working assumption of the new epistemology in  the  current  life  and  human  sciences  and  accordingly  it  has  multiple linkages.  In  biology,  genetic  functioning  and  environmental  interaction are entangled in evolution by natural selection, and ontogenetically

in  gene  environment  interactions,  to  be  considered  later  (Sect.  3.4). Moving to mature human psychology, the topic of the current chapter, the  person's  perception  of  reality-whether  of  themselves,  their  body and mind, or the world around them including friends and the wider culture-and their responses to it, depend on their interests, needs and values. This epistemology puts the person and their psychology at the centre of  the  biopsychosocial  complex,  as  the  knowing  agent,  though  muddled up with biology and culture. The person is therefore also the centre  of  attention  in  biopsychosocial healthcare-a point to be made later in  Chapter  4,  Sect.  4.2.  A  specific  illustration  of  the  critical  role  of  the person's interpretation of reality came up in Chapter 1, Sect. 1.2, as the epidemiological finding that perception of one's own social status is a better predictor of health outcomes than objectively measured social status. On the other hand, cognitive psychology and the new epistemology of which it is part is not 'idealist'.  This  is  to  say:  it  does  not  suppose  that reality is only appearance. The new epistemology does not have reality as something  'behind'  appearance,  however,  likely  to  be  unknowable,  but rather  as  appearance  that  is  independent  of  our  control.  Reality  makes itself  well-known  to  us  as  events  beyond  our  control  which  seriously impinge  on  our  perceptions,  needs  and  values;  such  as,  serious  losses, accidents, war, illness and impending death. Another aspect of the same point  links  with  misperception  and  epistemological  disorder.  While  we have  latitude  on  how  we  represent  reality  we  do  not  have  a  free  hand, and if  we  go  too  far  adrift  in  tracking  it,  we  are  potentially  exposed  to harm, and if and when we persist we are cognitively incompetent or in denial,  and  as  more  harm  accrues,  in  a  mental  health  condition.  In  the new philosophical framework, the ontology and epistemology of ppearance and reality can be run in terms that overlap with health and a disease.

## Agency Is Causal

Nervous systems regulate internal and external behaviour. Central nervous  systems  have  a  super-status,  though  un-omnipotent,  controlling other regulatory systems and behaviour as a whole, and all this reaches its peak in the human central nervous system, the largest and most complex, with  highly  developed  specialised  cortical  areas  and  connections  with so-called  'executive'  functions.  This  from  The  University  of  California website [12]:

The term 'Executive functions' refers to the higher-level cognitive skills you use to control and coordinate your other cognitive abilities and behaviors. The term is a business metaphor, where the chief executive monitors all of the different departments so that the company can move forward as efficiently  and  effectively  as  possible.  Who  we  are,  how  we  organize  our lives, how we plan and how we then execute those plans is largely guided by our executive system.

Executive functions can be divided into organizational and regulatory abilities.  Organization  includes  gathering  information  and  structuring  it  for evaluation.  Regulation  involves  evaluating  the  available  information  and modulating  your  responses  to  the  environment….  The  executive  system involves  the  prefrontal  cortex,  basal  ganglia  and  thalamus…  The  frontal  lobes  are  the  last  areas  of  the  brain  to  fully  develop.  This  area  of  the brain was evolutionarily late to appear and is much larger in human beings than in our closest non-human primate relatives. The frontal lobes typically account for about 40% of the human brain.

Self-regulation is one aspect of the causal power of agency among several,  all  entangled.  Most  plainly,  embodied  agency  interacts  with  other physical things; it cannot act at all without supporting ground; the body as  a  physical  thing,  using  the  skeletal  muscular system, can move other physical things, and is moved by other physical things. All these interactions involve energy transfer according to Newton's laws. The behaviour of the skeletal muscular system towards goals in relation to the environment and the  effects  of  on-going  behaviour  is self -regulated ,  involving the  nervous  systems  and  executive  functioning  specifically,  as  above. further, our activity in the social environment involves inter regulation -, this interspersed with physical interactions between us, benign or harmful. These themes of agency, inter-agency and causation run through the biopsychosocial  in  health,  disease,  security  and  injury,  and  hence  they appear explicitly or implicitly throughout this book.

A  recently  proposed  and  influential  philosophical  theory  of  causation,  the  so-called  'interventionist'  theory-see,  for  example,  James Woodward  [13]-emphasises  linkage  between causation and agency , consistent  with  what  is  suggested  here.  The  interventionist  approach emphasises that our interests in causal connections and explanations are linked  to  our  practical  concerns  of  being  able  reliably  to  bring  about changes.  At  the  same  time  the  interventionist  approach  is  aligned with  experimental  methodology,  especially  its  technological  implications:  if  A  causes  B,  we  can  manipulate  B  by  manipulating  A.  Thus  it

has application across the sciences. The practical, technological emphasis of the interventionist approach to causation is particularly well suited to  identifying  specific,  localised  causal  connections  in  complex  systems, as opposed to causal connections covered by general laws, and has been developed more in connection with biology and neuroscience than physics. Particularly relevant to a core theme in this book, the interventionist approach  can  accommodate  causation  by  regulatory  mechanisms, ncluding  explanations  involving  non-events,  of  the  sort  considered  in i Chapter 2, Sect. 2.2.

## Embodiment Involves Intersubjectivity

The  Cartesian  philosophy  and  its  legacy  was  fundamentally  solipsistic in the sense of envisaging only a single, unique subjectivity. It was not, at  its  foundations,  social.  The  Cartesian  ego,  divorced  from  the  body, never  could  know  another  subjectivity  like  itself:  all  the  Cartesian  ego could ever come across were objects of one sort or another; mechanical things in nature, including the body, or else perceptions in the mindbut it never could encounter as an object of knowledge another knowing subject like itself. for another subject to be an object of knowledge, subjectivity  has  to  be  something  in  the  world  that  is  known-that  is, embodied. The dismantling of the seventeenth-century materialist-dualist thought framework involves not only embodiment of subjectivity, but intersubjectivity:  the  social  assumes  a  foundational  role.  Embodiment and intersubjectivity  make  an  appearance  in  philosophy  following  Kant in fichte and Hegel: the knowing 'subject' becomes the human being, down to earth, as opposed to being disembodied, transcendental (outside  of  material,  space  and  time)-and  as  such  it  is  able  to  recognise another like itself (see, e.g., [14]). The foundational linkage in post-dualism between the biological body, knowing subjectivity and the social, becoming then moral and political, all with implications for the theory of health and disease, threads through these middle sections of this essay.

Inter-subjectivity opens  up  whole  new  aspects  of  regulatory  control and  communication.  It  involves  interaction,  between  bodies  and  minds, involving  both  energy-exchanges  and  information-exchanges.  We  do  not exchange information with the  natural,  inanimate  environment:  the  flow of  information  is  one-way,  from  it  inwards  to  us;  we  do  not  send  information to it to influence it; it has no information receptors or processing

mechanisms; no systems functioning towards ends. In the social environment, however, all this changes, another aspect of the interpenetration of the psychological and the social.

## 3.2 bioPsychosocial conditions of agency

## The Concept of Agency Has Broad Scope

Agency as the fundamental post-dualist concept spins off in many directions,  with  many  alternative  or  related  names;  it  threads  through  and criss-crosses the sciences and humanities: biology and neuroscience, psychology  and  its  many  subdivisions,  especially  social  and  developmental psychology, the philosophy of language and moral theory, social science and politics. The title of this section 'conditions of agency' refers in all these  directions.  We  do  not  aim  to  review  the  science  or  the  philosophy, but, consistent with the method so far, to clarify the conceptual and scientific  foundations of the theory which replaces physicalism, dualism and reductionism, and which is required to underpin the biopsychosocial model of health and disease. As indicated, these foundations turn out to involve much more than biology.

## Biopsychological Preconditions and Implications

Agency requires brain maturation and skill acquisition through infancy and childhood to adolescence, addressed in the increasingly intertwined developmental  psychology  and  developmental  neuroscience  literatures  (e.g. [15]).  Subjectively,  alongside  and  interacting  with  practical  competence, with complex neuropsychological underpinnings, we develop the experience of agency. Here, for example, the beginning of a paper by Synofzik and colleagues presenting a general model of the experience of agency as based in an interplay between prediction and postdiction [16] (p. 1):

The experience of agency, i.e., the registration that I am the initiator of my actions,  is  a  basic  and  constant  underpinning  of  our  interaction  with  the world: whenever we grasp, type, or walk, we register the resulting sensory consequences as caused by ourselves.

Here can be seen from another perspective the tight link between agency and  self-causation.  And  as  always  in  regulatory  and  control  processes, there  is  the  possibility  of  error;  one  of  the  applications  of  the  research

programme on the sense of agency is to some of the signs and symptoms associated with the diagnosis of schizophrenia.

A  new  field  in  neuroscience  is  the  development  of  the  social  brain  in adolescence,  interwoven  with  increasing  executive  functioning.  This abstract from  a  review  article  by  Sarah-Jayne  Blakemore  and  Suparna Choudhury [17] (p. 296):

Adolescence is a time of considerable development at the level of behaviour,  cognition  and  the  brain.  This  article  reviews  histological  and  brain imaging  studies  that  have  demonstrated  specific  changes  in  neural  architecture during puberty and adolescence, outlining trajectories of grey and white  matter  development.  The  implications  of  brain  development  for executive  functions  and  social  cognition  during  puberty  and  adolescence are  discussed.  Changes  at  the  level  of  the  brain  and  cognition  may  map onto  behaviours  commonly  associated  with  adolescence.  finally,  possible applications for education and social policy are briefly considered.

The concept of 'agency' also appears as 'self-determination' in the theory of  that  name  proposed  by  Edward  Deci  and  Richard  Ryan,  social  and clinical psychologists. Here, for example, [18] (pp. 227):

Self-determination theory (SDT) maintains that an understanding of human motivation requires a consideration of innate psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness… Social contexts and individual differences  that  support  satisfaction  of  the  basic  needs  facilitate  natural  growth processes including intrinsically motivated behavior and integration of extrinsic motivations, whereas those that forestall autonomy, competence, or relatedness are associated with poorer motivation, performance, and well-being.

The  linkage  of  self-determination  to  psychological  needs  and  to  wellbeing is the direction we are pursuing here. What we are proposing for the biopsychosocial model also has many points in common with Albert Bandura's social cognitive theory of agency [19, 20].

## Language an Instrument of Agency

Information  transfer  is  essentially  involved  with  regulation;  it  pervades biological functioning, and equally pervades behavioural relations within

species.  Language  is  one  of  our  human  within-species  signalling  systems; we use it to let each know the current state of dynamical play, for reporting,  and  to  influence  one  another,  as  command.  It  is  an  expression and an instrument of agency. At the same time as being inherently social, language is also the means of much of our thinking, our psychology,  another  aspect  of  the  interpenetration  of  the  psychological  and the  social.  Much  twentieth-century  theory  of  language  has  worked  its way  around  such  points.  Here,  for  example,  one  of  the  pioneers,  Lev Vygotsky,  the  developmental  psychologist,  writing  in  the  early  1930s [21] (pp. 69-70):

Children master the social forms of behaviour and transfer these forms to themselves… The validity of this law is nowhere more obvious than in the use of the sign. A sign is always originally a means used for social purposes, a means of influencing others, and only later becomes a means of influencing oneself. … If we want to clarify genetically the origins of the voluntary  function  of  the  word  and  why  the  word  overrides  motor  responses, we  must  inevitably  arrive  at  the  real  function  of  commanding  in  both ontogenesis and phylogenesis.

The  philosopher  Ludwig  Wittgenstein  developed  a  new  philosophy  of language from around the 1930s based on action and communication. His Philosophical Investigations starts with examples of people cooperating  and  communicating when shopping and building [22] (paras. 1, 2 and 8), and comments in paragraphs 18-19:

Do not be troubled  by  the  fact  that  languages  (2)  and  (8)  consist  only of orders… It is easy to imagine a language consisting only of orders and reports in battle.-Or a language consisting only of questions and expressions  for  answering  yes  and  no.  And  innumerable  others.--And  to imagine a language means to imagine a form of life.

In  this  context,  the  key  question  in  Wittgenstein's  philosophy  of  language  becomes: what  does  it  mean  to  follow  a  rule ?-a  topic  closely linked  to  the  concept  of regulation that  permeates  current  biological and behavioural sciences. The conclusion to Wittgenstein's analysis has rule-following in language closely linked with agreement in practice [22] (paras. 240-242). In biological inter-regulatory systems, the concord is set up by selective pressure over evolutionary timescales.

## Agency as Moral Responsibility

A strand in moral theory examines the logic and purpose of attributing moral responsibility (see, e.g., [23]). There are debates as to whether this presupposes free will, genuine self-determination, and in what sense, and debates as to whether praise and blame are made on merits, a matter of what is deserved, or as a means to influence the other. The first consideration links with further moral concepts, bringing in notions of justice, for example, while the second-attributing moral responsibility as means of  influencing  each  other-highlights  processes  with  direct  connection to our current themes. Instructions or exhortations from one to another are backed up, if the necessary power asymmetries are in place, by moral sanctions, praise or blame, and these social-moral mechanisms of control, more or less benign, are internalised as we acquire prosocial behaviour.

In short, as agency interpenetrates the social it becomes involved with morality. The moral emotions such as shame and guilt, conversely feelings of self-worth, are fundamental to our psychological life, and when the  negative  emotions  of  self-blame  become  barely  controllable,  they figure  prominently  in  health  conditions.  Attribution  of  illness  involves excuse from blame, but also carries risk of suspicion and exclusion, issues taken up in the next chapter (Sect. 4.2). All these things involve much more than our biology and in the new biopsychosocial theory they are all relevant to health and disease.

## Agency as Autonomy Is a High Political Value

Psychological agency merges into political autonomy . 'Autonomy' in the Greek refers to self-legislation. The term was applied originally in politics  to  self-governing states as opposed to colonies, was later employed in moral theory by Immanuel Kant in the high Enlightenment, becoming  fundamental  to  liberal  political  philosophy  [24].  Discussion  of  the various uses and meanings of autonomy which criss-cross the psychological and the political, and their relevance to the concept of mental disorder can be found in [25]. The concept of autonomy is also prominent in  bioethics,,  affirming  the  right  of  the  person  in  medical  contexts  to exercise control over what is done to his or her body, linking moral and legal rights with our biology [26]. The concept is also used in theorising the social gradient in health, referred to in Sect. 2.1. for example, Michael Marmot argues that 'it is not simply position in the hierarchy

that accounts for worse health among individuals of lower status … but what position in the hierarchy means for what one can do in a given society: the degree of autonomy and social participation' [27] (p. 1306).

Brain development of adolescents related to executive and social functioning  was  referred  to  above, and  reappears  here  as  the  development  of psychological  and  political  autonomy.  The  adolescent  becoming  adult  is recognised as an independent citizen, capable of work and contracts and childcare, for example, with assumption of moral and legal responsibility. These  processes  run  across  sectors  and  scientific  disciplines-illustrating how split-up sciences and policies have to work together to grasp the development of the biopsychosocial being-and they all impinge on aspects of adolescent health problems-on risks, management and recovery.

## Agency/Autonomy Depend on Recognition

Agency in interpersonal and political activity depends on the person as agent being recognised as such. There is a close linkage between embodied,  active  cognition  and  intersubjectivity  in  post-Kantian  philosophy, noted above Sect. 3.1, and intersubjectivity is interwoven with the recognition problem. Hegel has a famous passage in the Phenomenology of Spirit on the meeting of two people and processes of mutual recognition [28] (pp. 86ff.). He develops a complex argument to the effect that recognition of the other is essential to the development of self and self-consciousness, and it may well be that something of that sort is correct. The context in Hegel is the philosophical project of absolute knowledge that for  present  purposes  was  transitional  and  is  irrelevant.  The  application here is that the philosophical foundations of biopsychology include social recognition as  necessary  for  the  development  and  exercise  of  agency. Recognition involves social power balances. In Hegel, the appearance of the concept is immediately politicised, with argument to the effect that recognition  is  impossible  in  the  'lordship-bondage'  or  'master-slave' relationship. Subsequently, the concept has been used in political philosophy to theorise the dynamics between more and less powerful groups (e.g. [29-31]).

In  benign,  caring  social  groups,  with  participating  members  well enough  disposed  towards  one  another-functional  families,  kinship structures, cohesive communities-people recognise one another: they  know  how  to  respect  each  other's  agency,  albeit  within  socially

proscribed  rules  and  regulations,  how  to  care  for,  educate,  provide opportunities  and  cultivate  voice  and  practice  in  children.  In  short, inclusive communities  provide  conditions  for  agency,  albeit  subject to  its  rules.  If  however  such  communities  are  excluded  from  access  to resources  by  more  powerful  forces,  community  and  individual  autonomy is threatened, raising risk of ill health at both levels. These issues are taken up in the next section.

## 3.3 the socio-Political: who gets to control what?

## Regulatory Control of Biopsychosocial Resources

The  'social'  is  the  third  component  of  the  triumvirate  invoked  by  the Biopsychosocial  Model  as  relevant  to  health  and  disease,  and  we  turn now to consider  it.  However,  we  have  already  had  to  start  this  in  the preceding  section on  the  psychological as agency. Because  agency involves  exercise  of  power,  it  is  highly  sensitive  to  uses  and  abuses  of power,  to  the  political.  Social  processes  are  approached  in  the  social sciences directly however, not via the psychological as agency, but similar themes appear either way round.

The  subject  matter  of  the  social  sciences  can  be  described  in  terms of social structures, functions, organisation and regulation. This is consistent with the view proposed here that these and related concepts and principles are found throughout the biopsychosocial. Two main themes in  the  social  domain  are group  cohesion and allocation  of  resources ,  and both are implicated in models of health and disease. As considered at the end of the last section, cohesive communities such as kinship structures can provide conditions for agency, subject to their rules and regulations. We  turn  here  to  consider  the  theme  of  distribution  and  allocation  of resources.

The  distribution  of  resources,  prioritising  among  needs,  prioritising  between recipients, is  a  fundamental  feature  of  social  groups,  from families  to  the  state.  It  is  a  vast  elaboration  of  the  sort  of  distributive, prioritising  processes  already  apparent  in  basic  biological  control  systems, the delivery of chemicals necessary for Krebs' cycle, for example, and the control of metabolic processes by the nervous system. Control mechanisms  that  up-  or  down-regulate  resource  allocation  are  causal:

they make a difference to what happens. In the social world, a general word for  this  kind  of  causal  control  is  'power'.  Distributive  and  prioritising  functions  are  defined  by  socio-economic  rules  and  regulations, backed  up by  state  or  non-state  power,  with  sanctions  involving  the use of force and the deprivation of autonomy and liberty. The exercise of power is one defining characteristic of politics ,  and in this sense 'the social'  in  biopsychosocial  theory  applied  to  health,  to  do  with  the  distribution of resources, is essentially 'the political'. The highly influential political  scientist  Harold  Lasswell  clearly  identified  this  point  decades ago, and one of his major works has the title: Politics:  Who Gets What, When, How [32].

Resources needed for biological health include-no surprises hereaccess  to  energy-related  provisions,  such  as  food,  clean  water,  shelter to  help  maintain  body  temperature,  at  minimum, extending to healthy diet and exercise opportunities. As the biomedical sciences have understood  progressively  more  detail  of  our  internal  biology,  so  our  biological  requirements  have  become  more  understood.  These  requirements are basically met by the environment, and as the environmental sciences have  understood  progressively  more  about  environmental  conditions, local and global, so our environmental requirements have become more understood,  along  with  threats.  All  these  well-worked  areas  are  signalled  here  as  part  of  the  biological-environmental-social-psychological whole  picture,  and  to  make  the  uncontroversial  point  that  socio-political  processes  regulate  and  control  distribution  of  physical,  chemical and biological resources, according to wealth and wealth differences or alternatively according to principles of social justice. The more access to resources, at the individual or population level, the lower the risk of disease. The same point reappears post-onset. The more wealthy a person or state, the sooner healthcare can be accessed, the better the detection and treatment, and the better chance of favourable outcome. All this is well-known and well-understood. We focus more on the more recently recognised and less well theorised causal interplay between socio-political control of processes affecting psychological health-and hence, via that pathway, biological health.

As  argued  so  far,  social  structures  can  cultivate  agency  or  they  can inhibit it. If a person or group controls the action of another person or group, they so far fail to recognise the agency of the other, and tend to control the interaction in such a way as to disqualify it. Agency can be denied by various processes of psychosocial exclusion: if a person is not

noticed, not consulted, not listened to, has no place at the table when important  decisions  affecting  them  are  being  made-then,  so  far,  they have no opportunity for agency in the social group. Options collapse: to withdrawal from free action, to doing only what is prescribed by more powerful others-typically under threat of sanctions for disobedience and disruption, sanctions typically involving brute, physical-biological force. Conversely, when agency is recognised, insofar as the person is allowed and  encouraged  to  have  their  voice  and  to  influence  affairs,  agency  is realised.  This  intersubjective  relationality  can  be  expressed  by  saying, somewhat paradoxically, that one cannot be an autonomous agent all by oneself, a point emphasised in feminist theory [33].

Social  exclusion  has  been  explored  more  in  political  philosophy  and related  social  theory  than  in  psychology.  We  referred  previously  to Hegel's theory of recognition and just above to feminist theory. Other relevant active literatures are critical race theory (e.g. [34]), and postcolonial studies (e.g. [35]). Related philosophical theory includes Miranda fricker's  important  new  concept  of  'epistemic  injustice'  [36]  and  the related notion of 'epistemic violence' (e.g. [37]). The core idea is that a  person's  epistemic  status-their  status  as  a  knowing  agent-can  be undermined  and  disqualified  by  prejudicial  use  of  power.  The  role  of epistemic disqualification in theorising health risks has still to be worked out.

Social  exclusion  mechanisms  involve  micro-interpersonal  and  macrosocial interactions that can operate at any or all points in the lifespan. Others relate specifically to access to resources and opportunities necessary  for  development  of  agency  in  children.  Agency  requires  the development of knowledge and skills and therefore depends on access to  and  quality  of  education  and  training,  in  turn  typically  linked  to privileged  group  membership.  Socio-economic-political  power  structures  keep  a  tight  hold  on  distribution  of  education  and  training resources, and this is another factor-along with and interwoven with distribution  of  biological  resources-that  maintains  linkage  between wealth  and  health.  Greater  access  to  education  and  training  tends towards greater employment prospects and hence greater social status and wealth, creating a benign circle; and conversely. This is part of the biopsychosocial background of the so-called 'social gradient of health', reviewed below in Sect. 2.1, a linking mechanism being chronic stress, to be considered in Chapter 4, Sect. 4.3.

## Socio-Political Causes Really Are Causes

The arguments so far  are  relevant  to  disputes  in  epidemiology  regarding  the  causal  status  of  the  social  determinant  of  health.  In  the  reductionist  world  picture,  only  physical-chemical  biological  causes  are  real, while psychological and social causes are chimerical. In this picture, associations  between  poverty  and  poor  health  could  be  explained  in  terms of  biological  processes  such  as  poor  diet,  hygiene  or  smoke  inhalation, while  social  factors  are  something  else,  kind  of  causal,  but  not  really, because  not  biological.  The  social  factors  appear  less  like  causes,  more like delivery or exposure processes, as opposed to the really causal biochemical or microbiological mechanisms-all these thoughts summed up in the idea that social factors are not real causes but something else, perhaps 'distal risks'. The counter-argument developed here is that delivery and differential exposure processes are equally causal, apparent already at the  basic  biological  level.  The  problem  and  counter-argument  in  more detail as follows.

Here is William Cockerham in his book Social Causes of Health and Disease [38] (p. 1; citations omitted):

Stress, poverty, low socio-economic status, unhealthy lifestyles, and unpleasant  living  and  work  conditions  are  among  the  many  inherently social  variables  typically  regarded  by  laypersons  as  causes  of  ill  health. However, with the exception of stress, this view is not expressed in much of  the  research  literature…  Usually  social  variables  are  characterised  as distant or secondary influences on health and illness, not as direct causes. Being poor, for example, is held to produce greater exposure to something that will make a person sick, rather than bring on sickness itself…

Other epidemiological theorists have echoed this complaint, for example, Kelly and colleagues [39] (p. 310):

The  importance  of  behavioural  and  social  factors  notwithstanding,  they seldom find their way into etiological discussions of mechanisms of causation, instead being merely defined as risks or risk factors.

This  is  a  major  issue  in  the  epidemiological  literature.  In  her  important  paper  on  epidemiology  and  causation,  Nancy  Krieger  [40]  argued that while the epidemiological literature since the 1960s has recognised complex multifactorial  causation,  it  became  preoccupied  with  statistical

modelling,  without  developing  an  adequate  theory  of  causation.  In  a later paper Krieger argues, consistent with the views proposed here, that power-power over and power to do-structures people's engagement with the world and their exposures to material and psychosocial health hazards, driving health inequities, and that power does not readily map onto a metric of proximal or distal [41].

A related issue is whether apparent social causes are really confounded by biological causes. Here is Michael Marmot, discussing this issue, arguing that social factors, and a biopsychosocial model, have to be invoked to explain the social gradient in biological health risks [42] (p. 43):

Coming back to the Whitehall study, people had the idea that if we could explain  the  gradient  in  CHD  [coronary  heart  disease]  mortality  by  cholesterol, then social class would not be causal. I think this is too simplistic, because social class can determine the cholesterol level… In fact, mean plasma cholesterol in the first Whitehall study was marginally higher in the top grades and in the Whitehall II study there was essentially no difference by grade of employment. In both studies there was a very clear social gradient in smoking.

This comes back to asking the question of why we need a Biopsychosocial Model if we have smoking? An important psychosocial question is why is there a social gradient in smoking? It is not enough to know that smoking causes disease. We need to know why it is in the UK as a whole, close to  100%  of  women  and  80%  of  men  in  the  most  deprived  category  are smokers…

In the terms of the view proposed here, the causal status of social determinants  of  health  has  seemed  problematic  because  of  a  mistaken  conception of causation, limited to biology, but biology presumed to be a matter of physics and chemistry, and therefore quite unlike social mechanisms  that  deliver  health  resources  or  toxins  to  exposed  populations. Once understanding of biological  causal  explanation  is  updated  in  line with the biological and biomedical science of the past few decades, it can be seen to comprise not only physics and chemistry, but also and in very large part specification of mechanisms that organise and deliver resources all  around internal biological systems, and which remove toxins, or fail to; and further, those internal distribution processes are entirely dependent  on  what  can  be  taken  in  from  the  external  environment,  clean  air and healthy diet, for example, or the opposites, in which case any social mechanisms such as social inclusion and exclusion that affect availability

of health-promoting resources or exposure to toxins are very much part of the causal chain, whether distal or otherwise.

As  Marmot  implies  in  the  above  quote,  we  need  a  broader  biopsychosocial  model  to  comprehend  social  causal  processes  as  well  as  and interacting  with  biological  causal  pathways.  Such  a  model  also  brings into view the psychological and its relation to the social, including distribution of resources that promote development and exercise of agency, such  as  education,  employment,  and  social  cohesion  that  can  cultivate agency. Insofar as societies are organised so that these are not available to particular groups, the individuals in those groups are at raised risk of psychological health difficulties as well as physical health difficulties, and either way this social risk raising is causal.

The statistical modelling of multifactorial causal interactions, especially in  non-linear  systems  involving  feedback/feedforward  effects  over  time, presents challenges in epidemiology. Galea and colleagues [43] examine the issues in the case of 'the cause of obesity', listing seven broad headings of types of relevant factor, each with many specifics, from genes and gene expression  through  to  national  food  and  agriculture  policy,  with  many individual, neighbourhood and social levels in-between. The authors note, consistent  with  the  view  proposed  here,  that  higher  level  social  factors are  indeed  causal,  and  go  onto  to  consider  the  counterfactual  approach to identifying a single modifiable causal factor, and the use of multilevel regression modelling of multiple risks. They note, however, the limitation of regression to capture non-linear effects of the outcome dependent variable(s) on the independent variables, and propose use of complex systems dynamic computational models which can take into account not only risks at multiple levels but also interrelations between them.

The  topic  of  this  section,  social  causation,  is  a  long-standing  major topic  in  the  social  sciences.  The  hermeneutic  tradition,  which  defined social  processes,  meaning  and  understanding,  as  separate  from  causal explanation  of  nature  by  physics  and  chemistry,  as  outside  nature  and causation altogether,  was  briefly  discussed  in  Chapter  1,  Sect. 1.3.  The hermeneutic  approach  is  also  consistent  with  emphasising  that  individual psychology  and  action  underpins  social  phenomena,  a  view associated  with  Max  Weber  and  known  as  'methodological  individualism'  in  the  social  sciences  (for  review  see,  e.g.,  [44]).  Another  tradition,  from  Émile Durkheim,  proposes  that  the  subject  matter  of  the social sciences are distinctive social facts and causal processes. This kind of approach,  sometimes  called  'methodological  holism'  (for  review

see,  e.g.,  [45]),  can  be  seen  as  opposed  to  methodological  holism, requiring    reconciliation  between  the  two  views.  for  example,  List  and Spiekermann  [46]  propose  reconciliation  using  concepts  from  current analytical philosophy of mind, such as 'supervenience'. Our approach to the relation between individual level and social level causal explanation is part of the general theory of biopsychosocial systems outlined in the next section.

## 3.4 general theory of bioPsychosocial systems

## The Thread so Far

We  pick  up  here  the  line  of  thought  developing  a  general  model  of biopsychosocial ontology and interactions that was set up at the end of Chapter 1, Sect. 1.3. Throughout the chapters so far, the ontology and the  theory  of  causation  have  been  of  a  piece.  The  key  principle  in  the ontology starts with the relation of biology to the physics and chemistry of  matter.  Within  the  constraints  of  energy  equations,  complex  molecular  structures  form,  capable  of  regulating  energetic  processes,  especially  increasing  energy  differences,  running  counter  to  the  second  law of  thermodynamics,  temporarily,  though  replicating  in  the  meantime. Thus the ontology blurs into causal theory: different complex dynamical forms have different  causal  properties.  This  was  the  line  of  thought  in the first  part  of  Chapter 2.  In  the  second  part,  the  contrast  was  drawn with the limited, uniform, flat ontology of physicalism, which, in its most coherent form, would envisage only physical causation, but, faced with apparently valid causal principles in the psychological and social sciences, principles  able  to  predict,  retreats  to  the  physicalist  ontological  claim only, admitting psychological and social causation, though inevitably has trouble  theorising  these  additional  causes  without  additional  ontology. Now that we have in this third chapter so far proposed an account of the psychological and social, we can now generalise the points made in connection with biology to the psychological and the social.

## Life Forms: Diversity Amidst the Physics

The  idea  proposed  in  Chapter  2  that  biological  forms  and  ends  proliferate  within  'free  spaces'  permitted  by  physics  energy  equations  carries  through  to  the  biopsychosocial.  As  a  rule,  nothing  in  psychology

or social science textbooks is ever going to contradict textbooks about human biological systems, and insofar as psychology has any invariants, they will be preserved in the social sciences. There are constraints, but they leave scope for variety. In this sense, psychology exploits biological  indeterminacy,  for  example,  in  the  individual  differences  that  arise partly by genetic constitution and partly by individual learning experiences,  expressed  as  individual  choice  and  agency.  following  the  same line  of  thought,  social  processes  elaborate  diversity  in  the  biological and the psychological, giving rise to many forms of practice around our biological nature and around agency, intersubjectivity and recognition. The transition  from  the  biological  to  the  psychological  and  the  social is characterised by the appearance of new free spaces in which can arise the  twin  phenomena  of new forms of  organisation and diversity  and with them new causal processes . Once we move above physics and chemistry  into  biology,  hence  into  psychological  and  social  processes,  the ausation  involves  information-exchange,  communication,  regulation c and control.

## The Logic of Top-Down Causation

There  are  many  kinds  of  causal  pathways  in  biopsychosocial  systems. They can be top-down, bottom-up, and within-levels; they can involve regulatory  mechanisms,  disruptions  to  regulatory  mechanisms,  or  have nothing to do with regulation, involving energy exchanges only. Already the abstract picture is  complex, even before the specifics, and the contrast is with the single sort of causation envisaged by physicalism, energy transformations covered by a handful of equations.

Traditionally  top-down  causation  has  appeared  as  the  most  conceptually  problematic,  disallowed  by  physicalist  reductionism,  and  behind that, by energy conservation constraints. The problem is relieved when causal processes involving regulation are acknowledged. In this kind of causation, the regulating mechanism and the processes regulated are in the same ontological space-signified exactly by the fact that they interact. In this sense, while we can say that the regulating mechanism is at a  'higher'  level  than  the  processes  being  regulated,  this  no  longer  has the connotation that belonged to the concept of level in reductionism, namely that lower levels are ontologically more basic than higher levels. A core principle is that control mechanisms can up -and down regulate -processes at a 'lower' level, but cannot change their conformity to the lower

level  laws. We  considered  this  point  in  relation  to  biology,  physics  and chemistry in the second chapter, but it has some application throughout. In the case of the psychological, our biology gives us both capacity and choice-we have control over our limbs all being well, and some choice between courses of action-but we cannot alter our basic physics, biochemistry or biology: if the rope breaks we fall, if the biological mechanisms  controlling  cell  replication  breakdown  we  cannot  by  act  of  will put them right; we survive practically no time without oxygen. Equally, forms  of  social  organisation  can  vary,  but  they  cannot  alter  our  biology; for example, there are many ways in which social groups organise themselves around death, but they cannot alter the fact, even if we freely imagine  life  after,  or  postpone  it  as  long  as  possible  by  medical  treatments. Or again, forms of social organisation can promote education and training of individuals, but there are limits to achievements deriving from common and individual biopsychology; and forms of social organisation deal with agency and recognition of the individual in the social group in diverse ways, but cannot alter our need for it.

The point that higher level processes can up- or down-regulate lower-level processes, but cannot change the causal laws or principles at the lower level, is clearest at the lowest level, physics and chemistry, where the  energy  equations  never  change.  As  we  move  away  from  the  physical/chemical  laws,  however,  we  never  encounter  inviolability  again.  As we move into biology, psychology, and social processes, there is increasing scope for higher level processes not only to up- and down-regulate, but  also  to  affect  the  lower-level  processes  themselves,  because  these lower-level processes are themselves regulatory, not fixed laws of nature. There are some hard and fast rules, but blurred boundaries. for example, there is a boundary, but a blurred one, between biological processes that we can psychologically control-or can learn to control-and those we can't, and a blurred boundary between psychological processes that can be socially controlled, and those that can't. Once we move up from the inviolable laws of physics and chemistry-up from their mathematical  equations-the new forms of organisation and principles governing change have themselves a changeable quality.

Biopsychosocial  top-down  causation  is  possible  because  the  various systems are all in the same ontological space. Systemic top-down causation  always  involves  agents  at  the  lower  level,  where  the  difference  is being made, but those agents at the lower level function in ways deriving from their communication- or information-based relationships with

wider  organizational/regulatory  systems.  Hormones  are  biochemicals like  the  processes  they  regulate,  but  their  messenger  function  derives from the state of the brain or other organ that regulates their secretion, and that in turn on states of distant parts of the body. Social authority is imposed on individuals by other individuals, by virtue of their office, a complex idea that includes acceptance of the rules by all parties involved, and the power of the office to force compliance. Causation by regulatory control  is  not  ethereal  and  mysterious:  it  involves  interaction  with  the regulated processes by things of the same type, in the same ontological space, but those linked to wider contexts and dynamic relationships.

Psychological  regulation  of  biological  processes  appears  as  the  alternative to the irredeemably problematic Cartesian problem how immaterial mind could affect the material body. In post-dualist science, mental functioning  is  embodied,  and  the  central  nervous  system  regulates  not only  some  internal  functioning  but  also  goal-directed  behaviour  in  the environment. All of the processes occur in the same ontological space: stimuli are material forms, as are nervous system responses, as are behavioural  responses.  These  forms  exercise  regulatory  control  over  one another  using  information-exchange.  Specification  of  a  mechanism  is specification of the intervening links, in terms of information exchange, up-/down-regulation  of  subsystemic  responses,  or  whole  behaviour responses, and/or in terms of the materials, such as neurons, neuronal assemblies,  genes  and  hormones.  Within  this  paradigm,  with  the  concepts  so  constructed  and  ordered,  specification  of  mind-body  mechanisms is a scientific task-not a conceptually insoluble problem.

Social  regulation  of  individual,  psychological/behavioural  processes has  the  same  logic  as  psychological  regulation  of  biological  processes. Social and psychological/behavioural processes occur in the same ontological  space;  a  military  officer  is  a  person  like  the  private  soldier.  The question  arises  what  are  the  causal  properties  of  the  individual  person-as opposed  to  those  of  the  office.  Some  causal  properties  of  the individual  are  the  same  whatever  social  system  they  are  in,  biopsychological properties, let's call them, but others are by virtue of their office within a socially defined and regulated institution, realised in patterns of relationships and causal power within the wider social institution. Only by reference to the wider social institution is it possible to explain why the military officer can control the behaviour of the private soldier. All this  is  obvious  enough;  it  is  not  ontologically  mysterious.  The  appearance of mystery is only in the context of reductionism. Away from the

reductionist  picture,  there  is  nothing  ontologically  mysterious  about social  institutions  or  their  causal  powers.  An  adequate  explanation  of why, for example, a military officer can do what he or she does, involves reference to the long-standing institution of the military, with its accumulated rules  and  regulations,  to  the  training  of  the  individual  person within and by those institutions, and to their appointment as an officer, bringing with it access to power that far exceeds biopsychological nature understood  as  without  institutionally  defined  office.  Apart  from  causal power, membership of particular social groupings may affect individual psychological/behavioural dispositions. for example, members of disadvantaged groups lacking education are more likely to have lower health literacy  and  less  timely  access  to  healthcare.  There  can  also  be  associations  and  possibly  causal  connections  between  social  phenomena,  for example, between state or non-state actors, or between socio-economic class and health outcomes, as evidenced in the social gradient in health. All such relations involve individuals, but some of their causal properties, both what they affect and what they are affected by, depends as much or more on socially defined position than on individual characteristics and differences. This general approach defuses the tension between individual level and social level explanations considered at the end of the previous section.

Biopsychosocial systems work by complex regulatory control mechanisms that are vulnerable to break down. At the same time, biopsychosocial systems tend to self-preservation for as long as possible, which, since the threat of breakdown is ever present, requires a special dedicated class of  regulatory  mechanisms  that  protect,  disrupt,  repair  and  restore-all more or less successfully. Study of such defensive and maintenance mechanisms  take  up  substantial  parts  of  biomedical  and  psychological  textbooks, and there are social science analogues regarding mechanisms for maintaining social order.

## Cross-Disciplinarity and New Human Sciences

The  biopsychosocial/environmental  whole  can  be  divided  up  three  or four ways, four to include the natural as well as the social environment, using distinctive methodologies to answer distinctive kinds of questions, and then much subdivided in the division of scientific labour. However, the signal from the changes in the life and human sciences reviewed here is  increasing  need  for  cross-disciplinarity.  The  biopsychosocial  systems

theory  approach  makes  interdependency  of  the  four  kinds  of  phenomena  fundamental,  especially  in  modelling  real-life  problem  areas.  There is  simply  too  much  going  on  for  one  disciplinary  approach  alone.  for example,  biomedicine  restricted  to  inner  organs  and  systems  will  not attend much to the psychological attitude of the patient or their social and broad environmental context. The multifactorial and cross-disciplinary nature of the causes of variance in health outcomes also appears in the broad cross-sectoral range of interlinked outcomes, for example, links between health inequalities and educational inequalities (e.g. [27]).

In recognition of the need for cross-disciplinary approaches to problem-solving, they are increasingly encouraged by research funding bodies.  for  example,  there  is  a  new  UK  cross-research  council  strategy  for mental health, which announces itself like this [47] (p. 1):

The  Research  Councils…  collectively  have  an  interest  in  mental  health research from a medical, biological, environmental, cultural, societal, technical  and  historical  perspective.  We  have  worked  together  to  develop  a cross-disciplinary research agenda, to articulate opportunities for cross-disciplinary working.

The  stronger  signal  from  these  developments  however  is  that  the  old headings of sciences which gives the Biopsychosocial Model its name are themselves  problematic,  especially  insofar  as  they  still  contain  lingering presumptions  and  prejudices  from  the  old  divided  spaces,  and  what  is in progress is a biopsychosocial/environmental transdisciplinary revamp across the life and human sciences. It is as if we shouldn't really be starting where we are now, with biology, psychology and social science as separate from one another. These old sciences need reconceptualising so as to manage biopsychosocial and natural environment interactions. A further implication is that new, large scale scientific paradigms will involve these interactions as foundational.

This point applies to the two new, progressive sciences, mostly applied to health and disease: genetics and neuroscience. These two new sciences effectively  break  down  previous  categories  of  biological,  psychological, environmental  and  social-they  do  not  start  with  these  four  'levels'  of reality  or  causal  explanation,  but  rather  with  an  assumption  more  like bio-environmental-psycho-social  integrity.  Neuroscience  works  with  a systemic  view  of  the  brain,  essentially  engaged  in  regulation  and  control  of  within-body  processes  and  behaviour  in  the  outer  environment,

implementing psychological processes, including substantial resources for social processing, while at the same time being biological, neurochemical, genetically influenced; and so on. The new genetics is plainly biopsychosocial, envisaging biological genetic influences, individual differences and  social  factors,  among  other  environmental  factors,  as  all  involved in  determination  of  phenotypes,  including  health  outcomes.  The  most recently  developing  field  of  epigenetics  illustrates  these  features  most explicitly and some points are detailed below.

Epigenetic  processes  are  potentially heritable changes  in  genetic effects  on  a  phenotype  that  do  not  involve  changes  to  the  underlying DNA sequence. The genome itself is not altered, but specific genes can be expressed, i.e. can be active in the production of proteins, or they can be  switched  off  and  inactive-this  altering  downstream  functioning  in the internal or external environment. Proximate epigenetic mechanisms include  DNA methylation and stable chromatin modifications, and the wider systemic picture has many factors capable of altering these epigenetic mechanisms, including other genes, biological clocks, and exposure to  specific  external  environments.  The  concept  of  gene-environment interaction is grounded somewhat differently in molecular genetics and behavioural genetics, corresponding to their distinctive objects of study, concepts and  methodologies.  In  molecular  genetics, gene-environment interactions can be understood as effects of specific environmental exposures  on  gene  expression,  as  above.  Measuring  gene-environment interactions  is  methodologically  complex,  requiring  assessment  of  each component  and  causal  role  separately  (e.g.  [48,  49]).  In  behavioural genetics, the concept refers to differential phenotypic effects of the same environmental  exposure  on  different  genotypes,  indexed  by  statistical interaction in the model.

Epigenetic  mechanisms  are  biologically  deep,  found  already  in,  for example, plants regulating responses to stress [50]. They appear in animals, the environment for mammals typically including maternal behaviour  or  other  complex  social  interactions  with  con-specifics  (e.g.  [51]; [52]). Epigenetic factors have also been implicated in humans and human diseases,  for  example,  in  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  function  [53] coronary heart disease [54], and in the social gradient of health [55].

A  striking  illustration  of  the  interpenetration  of  biological,  environmental  and  psychological  processes  is  the  possibility  that  individual agency qualifies the gene/environment dichotomy. It has been a startling

finding  in  human  behavioural  genetics  that  environmental  exposures, specifically  adverse  life  events  or  risks,  far  from  being  all  independent accidents, are sometimes themselves 'heritable'. Such gene-environment correlations seem to cast doubt on purely environmental causal effects. However,  there  is  a  more  radical  implication  here.  In  their  review  of gene-environment (G × E) interaction Manuck and McCaffery have this [56] (pp. 62-63):

An interaction confounded by rGe [gene-environment correlation] might well seem to lack the implications of a true G × E finding. Yet what is the implication, if not confirming a proposition predicated on a frayed dichotomy?… In view of the extent of demonstrated rGE, it seems reasonable to assume that most dimensions of measured experience will have both environmental and genetic determinants, and most G × E  studies  will  not  be able  to  partition  genetic  and  environmental  influences  on  their  environmental moderators… Relinquishing pure G × E  interaction as the grail of G × E  research  may  encourage  interest  in  a  broader  expanse  of  potential gene-exposure  interactions  affecting  behaviour,  such  as  those  moderated by complexly determined experiences, dispositions, abilities, attitudes, and affective states.

A simple way of formulating the conceptual shift here is that while plants are sessile-fixed or in motion only because of some outside force such as ocean currents-animals use their own energy resources to move, and individual  animals  can  move  to  varying  environments,  up  to  the  point of human beings who have multiple possibilities as to what kind of place to be in and what kind of thing to do-although this within the options available to us-this in turn altering environmental exposure. Insofar as individual differences play in selecting among possibilities, the outcomes will be attributable to the person's individual nature, though this in turn dependent on genes and prior exposures and learning. Life and lifestyle choices, within the options available to us, are themselves influenced by all  the  factors  that  make  us  what  we  are:  genes,  upbringing,  learning, values.

This  has  the  radical  implication  that  genes  can  play  a  role  in  determining the environment as environmental exposures, in addition to the point  above  that  environmental  exposures  can  determine  gene  expression. In combination, the implication is that dynamic interplay is fundamental, not separate categories.

## CHAPTER 4

## Biopsychosocial Conditions of Health and Disease

Abstract This chapter continues from the previous chapter on themes in biopsychosocial conditions of health and disease, picking up some core questions familiar in the theory and philosophy of medicine. We argue that  the  concepts  and  boundaries  of  health  and  disease  are  themselves biopsychosocial.  Controversies  about  whether  such-and-such  a  condition  is  or  is  not  a  medical  matter,  as  opposed  to  difference  or  lifestyle choice, the consequences of being which involve benefits such as access to healthcare and/or harms such as stigma, and the terms in which such debates are conducted-are  all  thoroughly  biopsychosocial-political. Core defining features of illness-activity limitations, pain and distresslikewise involve our psychology and social life as well as our biology. On the  theme  of  causation,  we  endorse  scientific  method  as  the  route  to identifying  causal  mechanisms,  note  the  major  role  of  chronic  stress  in models of causal  mechanisms  linking  psychosocial  factors  with  biological  damage, and spell out that chronic stress is a quintessential biopsychosocial  concept.  We  consider  the  Research  Domain  Criteria  (RDoC) proposed recently by the N.I.M.H. as a framework for research in mental health as an illustration of a biopsychosocial research framework, potentially extendable to cover physical health and biomedicine. Physical and mental health conditions are brought together in the new biopsychosocial model rather than being axiomatically separate-as they were in the old context of reductionism and dualism.

## 4.1 conditions of bioPsychosocial life

So far, we have reviewed the rationale as well as the challenges for the biopsychosocial  model,  in  Chapter  1,  and,  drawing  on  contemporary life  and  human  sciences,  presented  conceptualisations  of  the  biological,  in  Chapter  2,  and  the  psychological  and  social,  in  Chapter  3.  In the later parts of Chapter 3, we drew out features of the biopsychosocial  whole,  especially  that  causal  interactions  run  within  and  between these three, or rather four, since the natural environment is thoroughly involved  with  all,  a  point  made  explicit  in  Sect. 2.3.  Critical  for  the biopsychosocial  model  as  a  model  of  health  and  disease,  foundational biopsychosocial concepts already have the relevant normative distinction  built  into  them.  Chapter  2  characterised  biological  processes as  local  areas  running  contrary  to  the  general  direction  of  the  second  law  of  thermodynamics,  temporarily;  this  feat  achieved  by  metabolic  regulatory  mechanisms,  which,  as  and  when  they  fail,  jeopardise the  viability  of  the  organism,  which  in  any  case  eventually  inevitably ends  up  back  as  dust,  more  or  less  prematurely.  Some  familiar  conditions of biological life were listed in Sect. 3.3, such as food, water, oxygen, suitable ambient temperature, accommodation, on the way to the less  obvious  conditions  of  psychological  life  as  agency,  which  include opportunity, access to resources such as education and training, which involves,  picking  up  themes  in  Sect. 3.2,  recognition  by  a  supportive,  encouraging  and  resourced  social  group,  which  is  also  necessary, along with peace and an uncompromised natural environment, for basic biological security.

In short, the conditions of biological, psychological and social liferisks  and  protective  factors  for  developing  and  recovering  from  health conditions-are pervasive.  As  this  has  become  clear  in  science  and  our thinking,  health  policy  has  recognised  that  it  should  be  cross-sectoral, involving much more than the healthcare sector. As a general rule, the healthcare sector is trained and funded to treat people who have fallen below  the  or  their  normal  level  of  functioning,  in  important  domains, with the aim of restoration of function, or optimising lowered function,

or reducing avoidable further loss. The healthcare sector also has a limited  role  in  primary  prevention,  but  this  has  turned  out  to  be  a  multifaceted,  cross-sectoral  task,  in  which  the  illness-related  language  of healthcare gives way to more general concepts such as promoting resilience, or well-being, thriving, or further away still, happy enough family life, access to and use of educational opportunity, satisfying and well enough paid work, friendships and meaningful civic engagement.

The biopsychosocial model is a model of health and disease, but this roughly  divides  up,  for  reasons  understandable  in  terms  of  the  model, into,  on  the  one  hand,  the  business  of  the  healthcare  sector-illness, with the negative conception of health as avoidance of or recovery from illness-and, on the other hand, prevention of illness, which merges into resilience and thriving, which are protections against ill health from the point of view of healthcare, but which from all other, non-illness preoccupied sectors, are another thing altogether: education, work, economics, politics, environmental policy and security. In this fourth chapter, we pursue further implications of biopsychosocial theory as a model of disease and health as absence of disease, leaving aside the broader questions of health and well-being.

## 4.2 bioPsychosocial concePtualisation of health conditions

## Concepts and Boundary Disputes

Some  questions  about  illness  are  causal  and  some  conceptual,  though there is no hard and fast line between them. Causal questions are about identifying risks, pathways and mechanisms of disease, developing clinical therapeutics and treatment technologies. They are questions for the basic and clinical sciences, and they take for granted what is disease and what is not. Or rather, to make clearer the conceptual point, the sciences are independent of whether the conditions of interest are called 'disease', and who by, as opposed to, for example, just phenotypic 'difference' or 'life-style  choice',  or  'sin'.  These  alternatives  show  up  not  much in science,  but  more  in  social,  political,  legal,  moral  and  theological debate. They  raise  more  or  less  far-reaching  conceptual  issues,  to  do  with  the meaning of 'illness',  the  logic  of  illness  attribution  and  human  nature. While scientific findings may be brought to bear on them, typically they cannot be settled by the science, or at least not to everyone's satisfaction,

indicating that there are other relevant considerations. The main point of this section is that these conceptual questions are biopsychosocial. Here is  Karl  Jaspers on this point, in 1913 around the beginning of modern medicine and psychiatry, also noting that such questions do not normally merit medical attention [1] (p. 652):

What  health  and  illness  mean  in  general  are  matters  which  concern  the physician least of all. He deals scientifically with life processes and with particular illnesses. What is 'ill' in general depends less on the judgement of the doctor than on the judgment of the patient and on the dominant views in any given cultural circle.

In  conditions  of  certainty,  there  is  no  need  to  spell  out  what illness means; all concerned, at home and in the hospital, know only too well, and they have other serious tasks to be getting on with. And if and when the need for a definition of illness or disease arises, in a textbook or classroom or the clinic, it is easy enough to give one simply by using some other  term  with  similar  meaning,  such  as abnormal structure  or  function, or disruption , disturbance , dysregulation , etc. The medical textbook descriptions of signs, syndromes and diseases are full of such terms, and they can all be used to define each other well enough for most purposes. This  family  of  disease/illness  related  terms  are  all  typically  systemic, referring to abnormalities or disturbances of structural forms, regulation and functional ends.

The meaning of illness-and all the cognates to do with abnormality-becomes  an  issue  in  conditions  of  uncertainty  and  dispute  as  to whether such and such a condition is an illness or not, in circumstances when it seems that no further observation or laboratory test would settle the matter clearly one way or the other. This uncertainty arises when criteria that normally go together, in the paradigm or prototypical kind of  case,  fall  apart.  Three  key  features  of  illness  typically  go  together: the person complains of distress or pain; second, they are unable to do things they need to do, there is incapacity or activity limitation, loss of agency; and third, there is the assumption that these things are because something is not well with the person's body or mind. This last assumption implies that medical/psychological expertise is required, hopefully, to  reduce  the  harm  (the  distress/pain  and  incapacity)  and  not  create more. When these features and assumptions are all present and correct, there are conditions for certainty-but insofar as they cleave apart, some

present,  some  absent,  or  dubious,  the  position  becomes  ambiguous; attribution of illness and the closely linked perceived need for healthcare professional attention, become uncertain. With uncertainty comes controversy. Examples of general kinds of case where attribution of illness and/or  need  for  medical  attention  is  commonly  contested  include: some  mental  health  diagnoses,  especially  those  associated  with  nonvoluntary admissions; 'medically unexplained' conditions; alleged overmedicalising and overtreating of conditions that are regarded rather as 'normal', self-limiting, or less harmful compared with harms from treating;  pathologising/stigmatising  difference  and  diversity,  and  lifestyle choices-even if they carry raised risk of illness.

The reference to 'pathologizing/stigmatising'refers to a downside of the illness attribution-a harmful side effect, linked to the main effect. The main effect of illness is to decrease our agency, up to and including the  ultimate  ending  of  it  all.  The  adverse  effects  of  illness  on  agency, and the experience of illness as pain and distress, cue interpersonal and institutionalised responses to help, to provide resources including care and treatment. At the same time, social expectations are reduced: the ill  person  is  excused  from  normal  social  role  obligations,  from  moral responsibility,  and  hence  from  blame;  the  attribution  of  causation  of behaviour, or of inactivity, is to the illness, not to the person as agent. In short, illness attribution implies excuse for and not being blamed for the downturn in functioning, and the right to access available healthcare.  However,  at  the  same  time,  and  for  the  same  reasons,  pathologising  carries  the  risk  of  disqualification  of  the  person  from  their  full recognition  as  a  self-determining  agent  in  the  social  world-with knock-on risks  of  being  stigmatised  and  subjected  to  the  many  varieties of social exclusion. The relative benefits and losses of being seen as ill  depend  on  many  general  and  individual  factors.  for  sudden  onset, treatable  conditions,  the  benefits  are  typically  high  and  the  costs  (of the  above  psychosocial  sort)  relatively  low.  for  long-term  conditions, with no treatment, or with treatments that-from the person's point of view-may do as much harm as good, the balance shifts, costs may outweigh benefits, leading to a rejection of the 'illness' label, in favour of 'difference' and 'diversity'.

Conditions  of  so-called  'disability'  are  a  special  case,  distinguished from 'illness', for complex reasons including absence of treatment, and, commonly,  the  absence  of  complaints  of  distress.  However,  the  'disability'  label  functions  like  the  'illness'  label  in  that  it  imputes  deficit  in

ability, hence excuse from 'normal' social role obligations, and hence at the same time carries risk of demotion from full recognition as an equal agent. furthermore, for lifelong conditions, 'disability' is not relative to the person's own previous functioning, and for acquired chronic conditions, the downturn in personal functioning does not come with implied upturn,  and  becomes  'difference'.  The  implication  is  that  the  critical notion of 'deficit in relation to normal' is benchmarked not against the person's  own  normality  but  against  normality  of  the  majority.  further, since  ability  to  act  is  a  function  not  only  of  personal  abilities  but  that always in the context of task demands and available resources and opportunities,  the  cause  of  'disability'  can  be  legitimately  attributed  to  these external  factors;  for  example,  people  who  have  to  use  wheelchairs  are handicapped in mobility by the way the majority build transport systems, not by their condition in itself. These kinds of points are well theorised in the 'social model of disability' (e.g. [2, 3]).

In short, conceptual issues around illness-and disability-related concepts and practices involve a complex range of and interaction between biological,  psychological,  social,  moral  and  policy  factors.  They  cannot be so much as articulated without a full biopsychosocial framework.

## The Logic of Disease Attribution Is Top-Down

The fundamental feature of disease in a system is that it causes-or significantly  raises  risk  of-disruption  of  the  function  of  the  system,  thus leading  to  adverse  outcomes  for  a  dependent  system.  'Adverse  outcomes for a dependent system' implies disruption of functionality of that dependent system, and that dysfunctionality in turn means that it causes or  raises  of  adverse  outcomes  on  a  further  dependent  system…  and  so on. This cascade continues until we reach dysfunctionality/adverse outcomes for the organism as a whole in its activity in the environment. It is  poor  outcomes  at  the  level  of  the  whole  that  ultimately  drives  attribution of dysfunctionality downwards to the parts that serve the whole. In short, the difference between function and dysfunction (or between good  enough  function  and  not  good  enough  function)  of  parts,  ultimately  turns  on  the  difference  between  function  and  dysfunction  (or between good enough function and not good enough function) of the organism as a whole.

In short, the logic of disease attribution is top-down, not bottom-up. The  causal  pathways,  by  contrast,  can  be  bottom-up,  as  for  example

atherosclerosis  causing  an  embolus  causing  cardiac  arrest  causing  the person's death. Causal pathways can also be top-down as previously considered;  for  example,  chronic  unhealthy  diet  and  lack  of  exercise  raising risk for atherosclerosis. But the point made here is a different one, namely,  that  the  logic  of  dysfunction,  as  opposed  to  function,  is  topdown, in the sense that it flows from whole to part.

## The Centrality of the Person

The implication of the line of argument in the preceding section is that, in  biopsychosocial  systems  theory,  health  conditions  have  to  be  understood in terms of the person as a whole, specifically how it affects their agency, values and achievement of personal goals. The centrality of the person was identified by Engel as a feature of the biopsychosocial model in his original papers [4, 5]. In this respect, there are some connections between  the  biopsychosocial  model  and  the  Patient-  or  Client-centred Care Model, and many papers have examined the relation between the two approaches (e.g. [6-9]).

There  are  also  connections  with  the  Recovery  model,  a  relatively recent, important and radical influence on mental health services [10-12]. The model focuses on chronic health conditions, on the centrality of the person's life and values, on achieving a good quality-of-life, on the need for good medical and nursing care, especially in acute phases, and on issues of access to social resources and opportunities. Many if not all aspects of the  Recovery  model  can  be  applied  as  much  to  chronic  physical  health conditions as to mental health conditions, though so far this extension is in its infancy (see e.g. [13]).

The  focus  on  chronic  conditions  has  implications  for  a  distinction often drawn in the literature between illness and disease , illness being the condition of the person, and hence involved in the personal and social world, and disease being a dysfunctional condition of a bodily organ or system, and not so involved (e.g. [14, 15]). Although this is an important distinction, it applies most clearly in cases where there is an identifiable somatic disease process, in an otherwise unaffected person, which subsequently  remits,  spontaneously  or  with  treatment.  The  distinction becomes blurred, however, in chronic conditions that have to be accommodated in the person's life and hence involved with the development of the whole personality. William Osler's famous remark: It is much more important to know what sort of a patient has a disease than what sort

of  a  disease  a  patient  has  [16]-applies  especially  well  to  chronic  conditions.  This  blurring  of  the  difference  between  disease  and  illness  is another  aspect  of  the  shift  from  the  (infectious)  disease  paradigm  to focus on non-communicable conditions, which require a biopsychosocial approach.

This shift affects the definitions of health and disease. A recent BMJ article  by  an  international  group  [17] critiques the 1948 WHO definition of health as 'complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity'. The authors acknowledge the definition's groundbreaking breath and ambition at the time, going on to criticisms, mainly unintentional contribution to the medicalisation of society,  continuing  to  the  second  problem,  arising  from  the  increasing relative prevalence of long-term conditions [17] (p. 1):

The number of people living with chronic diseases for decades is increasing  worldwide…  In  this  context,  the  WHO  definition  becomes  counterproductive  as  it  declares  people  with  chronic  diseases  and  disabilities definitively ill. It minimises the role of the human capacity to cope autonomously with life's ever changing physical, emotional, and social challenges and to function with fulfilment and a feeling of wellbeing with a chronic disease or disability.

Consistent with this last sentence, the authors go on to propose a conceptualisation of health as the ability to adapt and to self-manage , discussing this in relation to physical health, mental health and social health.

A concept of health along these lines makes personal agency fundamental,  though  in  its  broad  biopsychosocial  context,  interacting  with resources  and  opportunities.  A  person's  sense  of  agency,  whether  they can do enough to have a viable life, and with it whether they wish for life, as it is, or better, with treatment or with none, are all matters that depend on the person. The condition of the biological body matters, but insofar as it affects the person. It is of fundamental importance in healthcare that it is the person who feels ill and wants treatment, any or more, or feels well enough without it. We attend to the person, not the body part-and not to psychological signs and symptoms in isolation either. The centrality of the person also shows up in the next section. We will quote from Wittgenstein: the pain may be in the hand, but we comfort the person, not the hand.

## Pain and Distress Have Personal Biopsychosocial Meaning

Activity limitation is the core behavioural feature of illness or injury, pain and distress are their subjectively experienced aspects. But even these subjective experiences turn out to be thoroughly biopsychosocial, whichever way one approaches them: by philosophical analysis of 'subjective experience', or in terms of neuropsychological models of causal pathways, or behavioural models of interpersonal pain signalling functions.

Cartesian dualism has had a massive impact on our folk way of thinking  about  subjective  experience,  especially  inclination  to  suppose  that it  is  essentially separated  from  the  body and private  to  the  person .  One of  the  key  philosophical  critiques  of  what  could  be  called  'folk  dualism'  (as  opposed  to  the  full-blown  complex,  original  Cartesian  metaphysics linked to the mechanisation of the world-picture) is by Ludwig Wittgenstein  in  his Philosophical  Investigations ,  much  of  which  anticipates the kind of philosophical framework we are proposing in this book. Here  is  a  conclusion  of  Wittgenstein's  discussion  of  the  meaning  of 'pain' [18] (para. 281):

'But doesn't what you say come to this: that there is no pain, for example, without pain-behaviour? '  It  comes  to  this:  only  of  a  living  human  being and what resembles (behaves like) a living human being can one say: it has sensations; it sees; is blind; hears; is deaf; is conscious or unconscious.

Expressed  in  the terms  of  'dynamical  forms',  which  we  have  used throughout in explicating biopsychosocial theory, it is the human living form that has psychology. This is a fundamental aspect of the   non-dualist idea  of  'embodiment',  considered  previously  in  Sect. 3.1.  In  the  same movement of thought, Wittgenstein finds a simple way of making clear that the human being has a special 'centre'-the 'I', the person's speech and face-involved in recognition [18] (para. 286):

But isn't it absurd to say of a body that it has pain?--And why does one feel  an  absurdity in that? In what sense is it true that my hand does not feel pain, but I in my hand? What sort of issue is: Is it the body that feels pain?-How is it to be decided? What makes it plausible to say that it is not the body?- Well, something like this: if someone has a pain in his hand, then the hand does not say so (unless it writes it) and one does not comfort the hand, but the sufferer: one looks into his face.

Reconstructions of pain that involve moving away from preconceptions of mind/body dualism, appear increasingly in the humanities literatures (e.g. [19, 20]).

Turning to the science of pain, this is an expanding, large and complex  area  of  research  and  we  give  a  very  brief  and  simplified  survey  of some relevant key points. Until about the mid-1960s, it was supposed that pain was caused by signalling of tissue damage to the central nervous  system  by  specific  pathways.  In  the  1960s,  Ronald  Melzack  and Patrick  Wall  [21]  proposed  their  innovative  'gate  theory'  to  supersede specificity  models,  explaining  how  pain  perception  involved  multiple neural pathways, creating a model more able to capture individual and cultural  contextual  factors  in  pain  perception.  Melzack  and  Wall's  theory created the foundations for increasingly sophisticated models of pain perception,  involving  both  bottom-up  and  central,  context-sensitive pathways. In a chapter on the subject the neuroscientist Howard fields describes  current  models  of  neurological  pathways  of  pain  perception and then considers its signalling functions-its meaning for the person, using the example of inadvertently touching a hot iron [22] (pp. 44-45):

Turning to the subjective experience: there are three distinct components […] first,  there  is  the  purely  discriminative  part  that  includes  recognizing the quality of the sensation as a burn and localizing it to your hand. Second, there is the motivational aspect associated with the desire to pull your hand away or to terminate the sensation. Third, there is an evaluative component the thought of the damage that has been done to your hand and how that will affect your life in the hours and days ahead. (italics added)

It is this third component-italicised in the quotation above-that is of special  interest  here,  because  we  take  it  to  involve:  the  thought  of  the impact of the damage to oneself, one's agency and way of life, including its  always  important  social  aspects.  In  short,  this  evaluative  component that  is  central  to  the  experience  of  pain  is  thoroughly  biopsychosocial. The 'biopsychosocial'  appears  here  in  the intentionality of  pain,  i.e.  in what  it  is  'about',  its  meaning  or  representational  content,  which  is, briefly: threat of loss of significant biopsychosocial function.

These considerations also provide a way of comparing 'physical pain' with  'psychological  pain',  or  'distress'.  As  a  simplification,  psychological pain or distress is high on negative thoughts and feelings about one's prospects. fields has this [22] (p. 46):

In addition to its role in pain perception, the limbic system mediates emotional responses to a variety of factors including personal loss, anticipation of  harm,  and  so  on.  The  dysphoric  states  such  as  depression  and  anxiety  share  limbic  system  circuits  with  somatic  pain.  It  is  thus  no  accident that the word 'pain' is often used to denote emotional pain that has no somatic component.

The evaluative component in pain perception figures prominently in psychological models of pain and distress, with clinical applications. Highly negative (fearful) appraisals about the effect of damage, or other negative events, and indeed of the pain or distress itself, on one's future life are sometimes referred  to  as catastrophizing ,  and  they  typically  risk  having the effect of amplifying the experience. These models have the implication  that  psychological  management  of  pain  and  distress  should  target among other things reduction of catastrophising [23].

A  further  psychosocial  aspect  of  pain  and  distress  is  their  function in  interpersonal  signalling  and  regulation  of  behaviour.  This  aspect  is already  implied  in  Wittgenstein's  account  of  pain  expression:  expressions of pain, behavioural, facial and verbal, induce caring responses from others. It has been theorised in various ways, for example in the Social Communication Model of Pain [24] and in evolutionary theoretic terms [25].

## 4.3 locating causes in bioPsychosocial systems

## Identifying Dysfunctions and Modifiable Causes

While  disease  is  contextualised  in  the  person  as  a  whole,  the  immediate question is where the dysfunctional process is located: which system within the whole is dysfunctional, causing problems for the whole? The methodological assumption of healthcare is that the person as a whole is  in  trouble  because  of  some  dysfunctional  part,  a  dysfunctional  subsystem  within  the  body/mind.  It  underlies  the  traditional  individual focussed medical model of identification of clinical syndromes and diagnoses, and models of psychological processes in the individual that give rise  to  distress  and  activity  limitations.  The  scientific  details  are  in  the medical and clinical  psychological  textbooks  and  will  not  be  taken  further here. We focus more on the broader implications of systems theory and the biopsychosocial approach. The main issue is that systems theory

envisages (causal) interactions everywhere, including within and between the organism and the environment, in which context the question arises: what  is  the  logic  of  attributing  causes  of  dysfunction  to  the  organism rather than the environment?

In systems theory, one cannot begin to talk about the function of systems  without  reference  to  their  operating  environments.  All  biological systems function in interaction with others and ultimately in relation to fitness  of  the  whole  organism  in  a  range  of  environmental  conditions. One broad kind of pathway to dysfunction of the whole is poorness of fit between the expected environment, to which behaviour is adapted, and the  actual  environment,  to  which  it  isn't.  This  general  point  applies  in the evolutionary context, for example in the so-called 'thrifty phenotype' hypothesis applied to obesity. Hales and Barker [26] hypothesise that in poor dietary conditions in utero metabolic mechanisms are set to maximise  fat  storage  in  expectation  of  subsequent,  poor  post-natal  dietary intake; this mechanism would be highly adaptive in environments where poor dietary conditions in utero were reliably followed by poor dietary conditions postnatal, as may be reasonably assumed to be the case in our original evolutionary environments; but if this association breaks down, as  in  postnatal  dietary  environments that are actually high in accessible sugar/fats,  the  consequence  would  be  a  hard  to  modify  tendency  to excessive  fat  storage.  The  general  idea  of  poorness  of  fit  of  previously adaptive  mechanisms  to  later  environments  has  an  ontogenetic  version in  the  learning  theories  in  psychological  science:  behaviour  shaped  up by one set of environmental contingencies may be maladaptive in a subsequent  environment.  for  example,  if  toddlers  are  reared  in  parenting styles involving multiple and conflicting commands, the child is likely to learn to ignore them and to seek to satisfy their own goals regardless, but this behaviour pattern will likely lead to poor outcomes in the classroom [27, 28].

Notwithstanding  these  considerations,  we  still  locate  the  problemthe  dysfunction-in  the  person.  An  obvious  reason  for  doing  so  is the  centrality  of  the  person:  it  is  the  person  to  whom  harm  accrueswho  suffers  pain,  distress,  significant  impairment  of  agency  and  loss. However,  this  consideration  alone  is  superficial  in  a  systemic  context, because the cause may still lie outside the person, being done to, and this is the force behind the social model of disability which we have already had occasion to cite in this section. A more promising key to this issue is  the  one  increasingly  found  in  the  health  literature:  the  concept  of

identifying modifiable causes. The idea is that, among all the criss-crossing  causal  pathways,  what  needs  to  be  identified  are  promising  targets for  intervention.  This  approach  is  consistent  with  the  interventionist  approach to causality referred to in Chapter 3, Sect. 3.1, and is well suited to healthcare as applied science, seeking to change things, for the better.  from this point of view, dysfunction attribution is in part-and somewhat  paradoxically-shorthand  for  belief  about  promising  possibilities for change. While 'dysfunction' and its cognates connote deficit, promising possibilities for change are opportunities.

In  complex  systems  where  there  is  a  poor  fit  between  the  person's behaviours and the environment, the question arises: where is potential for change? In conditions of the person that are lifelong, not amenable to change, the potential for change lies elsewhere, not in the person, but in  social  attitudes  and  resources-and this is a compelling argument of the social model of disability. for acquired long-term health conditions, it is likely that optimal outcomes from the person's point of view come from a combination of-in no order-available high-quality healthcare, self-management,  social  support,  plus  non-discrimination  by  broader society.

Effective  treatment  or  prevention  technologies  rely  on  targeting  a cause of large enough effect, i.e. a causal factor identified in group studies  that  accounts  for  a  large  proportion  of  the  outcome  variance.  The main point for the present purpose is that there are few causes of currently  common health conditions with so large an effect that targeting them leads to complete prevention or complete cure, and for the majority, a multimodal approach to multiple factors is required.

These issues  relate  to  the  problem  of reduction  of  disease  to  a  single primary cause . If a normal function of a biological system is carried out by only that one system, then the failure of that function will be reducible  to  processes  within  that  one  system.  for  example,  insofar  as  it  is only  the  cardiovascular  system  that  delivers  oxygen  to  cells,  failure  to achieve that functional end, depleted oxygen delivery to cells, is attributable only to-and in this sense is reducible to-cardiovascular dysfunction, to a cardiovascular disease process such as atherosclerosis. In many cases however, and this may be the general rule, biological functions are affected  by  multiple  subsystems,  with  the  effect  that  achievement  of  a particular  function  is  not  a  matter  of  processes  in  any  one  system,  but may be affected by many interacting systems. However, such factors may not be relevant to the disease process once onset: for example, advanced

arteriosclerosis is not likely to be reversed by social policy affecting dietary  changes, and quite different interventions may be needed, such as bypass surgery. On the other hand, for acquired, chronic health conditions, there is typically ongoing interaction with environmental, psychological  and  social  factors.  There  is,  in  brief,  no  reduction  to  a  primary cause, biological, psychological or social, but rather multiple systems of all kinds are involved at varying stages, some contributing risk for poor outcomes,  others  contributing  to  protection,  including  restorative  and compensatory mechanisms.

## Identifying Causal Mechanisms

In  setting  the  scene  for  developing  biopsychosocial  theory  in  the  first chapter,  we  noted  that  evidence  of  biological,  psychological  and  social causal  factors  in  many  health  conditions  comes  from  group  statistical data in controlled study designs. The inference to causation relies on the empiricist  approach  to  causation,  after  Hume  and  Mill,  as  association or  correlation  determined  in  experimental  or  quasi-experimental  study designs. We noted however that such data in themselves provide no theoretical  account  of  what  kind  of  thing  the  variables  stand  for,  or  what kind  of  causal  properties  they  have,  separately  or  in  combination.  This absence of ontological-causal theory is particularly noticeable given the long-standing  assumptions  that  physical(-chemical)  processes  alone  are causal, covered by inviolable physical laws, that therefore biological factors  can  be  causal  only  because  biology  is  physics  and  chemistry,  while mental events are scientifically odd epiphenomena, and social processes can hardly be conceptualised at all within this particular world view. The task of Chapter 3 and this chapter is to elucidate a general biopsychosocial theory capable of comprehending biopsychosocial data.

Issues  raised  by  untheorised  statistical  data  appear  in  the  philosophy of  medicine  literature  in  discussion  of  whether  the  empiricist  approach to determining causes, using controlled study designs and associated statistical  methods,  is  sufficient,  or  whether  it  is  also  necessary  to  identify causal  mechanisms .  federica  Russo  and  Jon  Williamson  have  proposed [29] (p. 158):

The health sciences infer causal relations from mixed evidence: on the one hand, mechanisms and theoretical knowledge, and, on the other, statistics

and probabilities. Statistics are used to show that the cause makes a difference to the effect, and mechanisms allow causal relationships to explain the occurrence of an effect.

This  proposal  turns  on  what  a  'causal  mechanism'  is,  and  specifically on  whether  identifying  a  causal  mechanism  is  distinct  from  determining probabilities in controlled study designs. In their paper cited above Russo  and  Williamson  give  examples  of  causal  mechanisms,  and  in  a related paper, Illari and Williamson [30] (p. 1) cite a definition of 'causal mechanism' from Machamer et al. [31]: 'entities and activities organized in such a way that they are responsible for the phenomenon'-which is somewhat vague with more than a hint of circularity. A more informative definition is provided by Glennan [32] (S 344):

A  mechanism  for  a  behaviour  is  a  complex  system  that  produces  that behaviour by the interaction of a number of parts, where the interactions between  parts  can  be  characterised  by  direct,  invariant,  change  relating generalisations.

This  is  more  informative,  but  is  so  exactly  because  it  reintroduces  the importance  of  invariant  generalisations  consistent  with  the  empiricist approach to causation.

So what is a causal mechanism over and over what is established by controlled experimentation? The life sciences deal with complex systems changing  over  time,  with  probabilistic  associations  between  inputs  and outputs that are separated spatially by the inner workings of the system and by time. Confidence in having identified a causal mechanism is raised when the events are proximate, with fewer or no intervening processes and closer in time. So one idea behind 'causal mechanism' is just that we fill  in  the  intervening steps ,  spatial  and  temporal, finding causal connections  of  ever  closer  proximity  between  inputs  and  effects,  between,  for example, environmental exposures at one time and poor health at a later time.  This  approach  to  'causal  mechanism'-filling  in  the  intermediate steps-is suggested by Illari and Williamson [30], and supported by considerations in, for example, Kincaid [33]. It is, however, readily accommodated  in  the  empiricist  approach  to  causation,  a  point  well-argued by  Kendler  and  Campbell  [34].  A  corollary  of  filling  in  the  intervening steps, with ever closer proximity of links in the causal chain, taking into  account  other  proximate  factors  at  each  step,  in  effect  increases

probabilities from lower to higher. further, as probabilities of association and correlations approach 1, the sample size required for confidence in generalisability reduces: a few well-designed, replicated experiments with relatively  small  samples  will  do.  All  this  can  be  understood  in  terms  of the empiricist approach.

There  is  however  the  famous  limitation  of  empiricist  epistemology, whether in the knowledge of causes or knowledge generally, namely, that it  omits theory ,  envisaging knowledge by observation only. In the statement of their thesis quoted above Russo and Williamson bring together '(causal) mechanisms and theoretical knowledge' contrasted with statistics and probabilities, but it is worth distinguishing them. It is true that experimental method or approximations to it only ever establish correlations  and  associations,  albeit  generalisable  and  counter-factual  that can support intervention to make a difference. The theory goes further, however, explaining why the correlations exist and why the intervention works, 'explaining' in the sense of fitting into a more or less well-established body of knowledge. On the other hand, it should be said that the additional  need  for  theory  is  not  a  totally  different  requirement  compared  with  establishing  causal  connections;  rather,  theory  is  typically a  broader  class  of  causal  connections,  themselves  established  or  confirmed  using  experimental  methodologies  or  approximations.  So,  if  we elucidate  the  concept  of  'causal  mechanism'  in  terms  of  'theory',  just as  if  we  elucidate  it  in  terms  of  intervening  steps,  the  process  of  identifying  a  causal  mechanism  and  identifying  a  cause  are  similar-and specifically, identifying causal mechanisms is not a separate epistemological route to establishing causes. This conclusion is consistent with Alex Broadbent's  discussion  of  these  issues  in  epidemiology  [35],  and  with Bert Leuridan's and Erik Weber's discussion of mechanistic evidence and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [36].

As  to  what  theorised  biopsychosocial  causal  mechanisms  are,  the general  concepts  and  principles  have  been  the  main  topic  in  preceding chapters, including systems , structures or forms , functioning towards ends , information and communication , coding , regulation and control . And for causal  mechanisms responsible for breakdown, their relevant negations, such as such as error , abnormal , dysfunction and dysregulation . These are the general concepts and principles; the specifics are diverse, depending on which system, vulnerable structures, ends and control mechanisms are being modelled.

## Stress as a Biopsychosocial Causal Mechanism

One of the most theorised and researched general causal mechanism for explaining  biopsychosocial  impacts  on  health  is stress .  Chronic  stress, specifically,  is  hypothesised  to  be  a  key  mechanism  leading  to  stress-related biological reactivity such as inflammatory responses that adversely affect the immune system and other organs, raising the risk for a range of health conditions [37-40]. As an example of recent work in this area, here are summary statements from a recent major longitudinal study in The Lancet on the relation between resting amygdalar activity and cardiovascular events [41] (p. 2):

Chronic stress carries an attributable risk for cardiovascular disease that is on par with other recognised risk factors, such as smoking, increased lipid concentrations,  hypertension,  and  diabetes.  Despite  the  prevalence  and potency of this risk factor, little is known about the mechanisms that translate  stress  into  cardiovascular disease events… Our study provides several observations that together define a mechanism linking stress to cardiovascular  events…,  specifically  that  the  amygdala  could  be  a  key  structure  in the mechanism… and that upregulation of haemopoietic tissue activity and increased atherosclerotic inflammation are additionally implicated in a neural-haemopoietic-arterial axis.

In  the  experimental  psychology  literature  spanning  animal  and  human research,  the  concept  of  stress  is  closely  linked  to  fear,  anxiety  and depression.  Stress  ors  are  various  kinds  of  (perceived)  threat,  but  with the specific feature of (perceived) uncontrollability . This idea has a long history in learning and personality psychology, for example, in Rotter's locus of control theory [42] and Seligman's learned helplessness model of  depression  [43].  Here  is  a  formulation  by  Richard  Lazarus  [44] (p. 58):

A good way of thinking about stressful person-environment relationships is to examine the relative balance of forces between environmental demands and  the  person's  psychological  resources  for  dealing  with  them.  If  the environmental  load  substantially  exceeds  the  person's  resources,  a  stressful relationship exists… In psychological stress, the comparison is between the power of the environmental demands to harm, threaten, or challenge, and the psychological resources of the person to manage these demands… from the standpoint of this way of thinking, stress is particularly powerful

when  the  individual  must  struggle  with  demands  that  cannot  easily  be met… If the ratio of demands to resources becomes too great, we are no longer talking about high stress but trauma… The person feels helpless to deal with the demands to which he or she is exposed, and this can result in feelings of panic, hopelessness, and depression.

Psychologically,  stress  arises  from  exposure  to  salient  negative,  uncontrollable  events,  jeopardising  the  sense  of  agency.  Salience  covers  what is  essential  to  our  biological  and  psychological life. further, psychological  stress  essentially  involves  social  factors  such  as  task  demands  and access to resources. At the same time psychological stress is also biological, physiological: it is the activation of the arousal system, preparing for action to achieve important goals-but if the goals cannot be achieved, ever,  or  never  enough,  or  never  reliably,  the  arousal  system  is  chronically active, and it is this chronic (hyper-) activity of the arousal system that is hypothesised to be the source of long-term biological damage. In short, chronic stress as the key hypothesised mechanism linking psychosocial  factors  with  poor  physical  and  mental  health  outcomes  is-as  to be  expected-a  mechanism  that  explicitly  addresses  criss-crossing  biological, psychological and social processes. Key features of the hypothesised chronic stress mechanism are aspects of the core features we have proposed for biopsychosocial theory: the psychological sense of agency and action  itself  are  compromised,  raising  risk  for  mental  health  problems, because social task demands are excessive and social resources inadequate,  and  the  consequences  of  this  chronic  psychosocial  misfortune is  top-down  dysregulation  of  critical  biological  processes  raising  risk  of physical health problems.

## Biopsychosocial Research Framework

The biopsychosocial model, like the narrower biomedical model, is not a scientific theory or summary of scientific findings, but could be applied as  a  framework  for  organising  and  planning  research.  The  N.I.M.H. Research  Domains  Criteria  RDoC  framework  for  mental  health  is  a rigorously worked out example of a framework in this sense [45]. The RDoC framework is a 2-dimensional grid: the columns are for biological, psychological  and  social  factors-in  this  sense,  the  RDoC  framework is explicitly biopsychosocial-and the rows refer to specific neural-psychological-behavioural systems (such as fear and reward systems). The cells

can accommodate what is assumed known with more or less confidence, or could indicate what remains unknown, either not yet investigated or with  mixed  or  inconclusive  findings.  We  consider  the  RDoC  research framework here  because  it  is  the  best  current  and  because  it  could  be elaborated  in  various  ways  to  have  broader  scope  appropriate  for  the biopsychosocial model, for example application to physical health as well as  mental  health,  incorporating  biomedicine,  and  inclusion  of  a  wider range and number of factors known to effect health and disease at various stages. Here are some main points that would be involved in such an elaboration:

- -Extension to physical health : A research framework of this sort could be to apply to biological systems below as well as above the neck, to  include  such  as  the  cardiovascular  system  as  well  as  the  central nervous system, in effect incorporating biomedicine, and potentially then able to have relevance to physical as well as to mental health conditions.  Importantly,  it  would  be  able  to  accommodate  the many kinds of pathways and conditions that do not fit neatly into either of these two categories, such as risks involving chronic stress, or the so-called psychosomatic conditions or medically unexplained symptoms.  The  expanded  framework  would  in  effect  have  the advantage of recognising interactions between the brain and other biological systems, and hence be able to accommodate the emerging  evidence  outlined  in  Chapter  1,  Sect.  1.2, implicating  psychosocial  factors  in  the  aetiology  and  course  of  medical  conditions. Assuming the grid has explicit relevance to both systemic function and dysfunction in the rows, on which more below, some aspects of research findings relevant on mental health on the one hand and physical health on the other would diverge significantly, for example,  confirmation  of  primary  biological  progressive  disease  mechanisms and treatments in some physical diseases. But in other areas of the grid, particularly relating to aetiological risk factors accumulating through the lifespan, or in areas of the grid-to be proposed for addition below-on management of chronic conditions and factors affecting quality-of-life, similarities among mental and physical health conditions would be more apparent.
- -More  discrimination  among  kinds  of  psychological  and  social  factors  relevant  to  health  and  disease .  for  example,  to  accommodate aspects of agency: agency as perceived, and agency related to social

factors including task demands (e.g. work; dependents) and access to  resources  and  opportunities  (these  of  many  kinds,  including access to treatment). This would require more columns. The RDoC framework is  work  in  progress,  adaptable  as  the  science  develops; current  versions  have  around  5  columns  for  biological  factors, around 1 for psychological, and around 0-1 for social factors (e.g. [45, 46]).

- -Acknowledgment of non-social  environmental  health  risks ,  especially important if physical health is included, again requiring more columns, to  include  factors  such  as  ambient  air  quality  and  available diet.
- -Explicit  specification  of  health  conditions  or  'diseases' ,  not  only  the biological systems. The RDoC framework at present has no explicit conceptualisation  or  characterisation  of  mental  health  conditions, connected with the aim of replacing current psychosocial diagnostic criteria with biological criteria [47-49]. To accommodate specification  of  health  conditions,  probably  a  third  dimension  of  the grid would be needed. This is easier to see if we imagine the grid incorporating  biomedicine  in  which  the  issues  are  better  worked out: the rows would be specific systems such as the immune system, with  implicit  reference  to  its  components  and  functions,  and  the columns would specify  factors  affecting  functioning,  but  probably a  third  dimension of the grid, distinct though theoretically closely connected to the rows and the columns, would be needed to specify the dysfunctions and disorders of the immune system. The cells in  this  now  3-dimensional  grid  could  then  accommodate  findings of the specific subsystems responsible for harmful health conditions warranting healthcare attention.
- -Need to  discriminate  among  stages  of  health  conditions would  arise once a dimension specifically for health conditions was explicitly in place. It would also be necessary, as we have emphasised previously, to  distinguish  between  research  questions  referring  to,  first,  aetiology  of  disease  incidence,  in  population  samples;  second,  disease progression  or  maintenance,  in  patient  samples;  and  third,  factors affecting quality-of-life in chronic conditions. These discriminations are necessary because they are distinct research questions, requiring distinctive  methodologies  and  sampling,  and  also-especially  relevant  to  our  main  theme-because  the  balance  of  biological,  psychological and social involvement can vary substantially depending

on the stage of a condition. for example, for cardiovascular disease biological processes dominate as maintaining factors and targets for intervention such as surgery in the advanced stages of the disease; whereas,  if  the  question  is  the  aetiology  of  cardiovascular  disease, accumulation of risk factors in the population, to be applied as basis for  prevention  technologies,  or  application  to  advising  an  at-risk individual patient, then lifestyle social and factors, such as exercise and time of access to treatment, figure large. And for chronic diseases, in fact for all diseases where the person is alive and managing, not in coma, there are always issues of agency and the quality of life. A framework for organising or planning research into management of chronic diseases would, therefore, need to accommodate the full range of biological, psychological, environmental and social factors.

- -Population level as opposed to individual level questions , for example, incidence  vs.  susceptibility,  might  require  different  grids,  the  one to do with differences between individuals (types), the other differences between populations. The UK NICE conceptual framework for public health [50], for example, distinguishes between individual and population patterns of disease and their causal mechanisms; both  include  biological,  social  and  related  factors,  but  the  latter has additional  interactions  with  a  range  of  other  factors  including political and economic.
- -  finally,  a  further  dimension  of  variation  is developmental .  All  biological and psychological systems in health and disease have developmental trajectories, within which there is variation in the relative influence  of  biopsychosocial  and  environmental  factors,  including in  factors  affecting  vulnerability  and  resilience  to  adversities  and illness. Hence all the research questions would have to allow for age variation.

The  points  above  indicate  what,  based  on  considerations  so  far  in  this essay,  would  constitute  an  adequate  framework  for  organising  health research  and  identifying  areas  of  relatively certainty and  important unknowns. Possibly further dimensions could be added, for example on 'impact',  estimating  the  relative  importance  of  knowing  more  about  a specific health condition at a specific stage, for treatment or prevention, depending  on,  for  example,  prevalence,  projected  prevalence,  among what  age-group,  healthcare  costs,  associated  cross-sectoral  costs,  etc. But, in any case, the elaborated framework as sketched above is already

multidimensional,  needs  far  more  than  a  two-dimensional  grid,  can hardly  be  represented  diagrammatically,  though  could  be  split  up  into different diagrams, but it is bound to be complicated if able to accommodate and organise the entire basic and clinical science health researchthis  can  hardly  be  expected  to  be  simple.  In  practice  of  course  such  a multidimensional  monster  grid  to  organise  biopsychosocial  research across the whole of healthcare will never be constructed because too big, too complicated and of no practical use. Small segments of the hypothetical  framework are written up in reviews for circumscribed specifics: for some conditions, some treatments, some stages, some health economic analyses, some policies, other angles. Otherwise, it exists in the scientific literature as a whole, broadly construed, across the range of biopsychosocial and environmental sciences applied to health.

In the next section, we consider the tension-intrinsic to healthcare as it has developed over the past few decades-between research data of the kinds considered above, on groups, and clinical care of the individual.

## Clinical Epistemology

It  is  something  of  an  irony  that  while  health  research  has  made  such strides  over  the  past  few  decades,  while  knowledge  has  increased,  certainty in the clinic is just as likely to have gone down as up! This is connected  with  the  fact  that  much  of  what  has  been  discovered  is  about complex,  multifactorial  causation.  We  know  more  about  the  body  and mind,  their  functions  and  dysfunctions,  and  their  interaction  with  the environment, and more about the treatment of biological and psychological health problems, but this has come along with increasing appreciation  of  the  complexity  of  the  problems,  beyond  physically  damaged tissue  or  biological  infection,  involving  multiple  interacting  biological systems, along with increased understanding of regulating systems with wide  interactive  reach,  including  the  central  nervous  system  and  psychological  functioning.  Linked  with  multifactorial  complexity,  this  new complicated knowledge is statistical, based on group studies, delivering associations  such  as  relative  risk  and  odds  ratios,  and  quantifications  of treatment  effects such  as effect size and  number-needed-to-treatand  how  all  these  statistics  relate  to  a  particular  patient  is  unsettled. Notwithstanding the benefits of evidence-based practice, the challenges of  inference  from  population-based  aetiological  risk  studies  and  clinical  treatment  trials  to  preventative  management  and  treatment  of  the

individual  patient  are  significant  [51,  52].  The  challenges  here  do  not disqualify  the  application  of  the  experimental  method,  following  Mill's methods  of  agreement  and  difference,  or  approximations  to  them,  to determine causes and effects (as outlined in Chapter 1, Sect. 1.3, under the heading 'Biopsychosocial Data in Search of Theory'). There are in fact no other serious players on this particular pitch. Application includes reliance on randomised controlled treatment trials (or better, meta-analyses of multiple such trials) as being the most logically valid way of identifying treatment effects (see e.g. [53]). Experimental method can result in  reliable  positive  findings,  but  also,  and  of  high  importance,  reliable negative findings, likelihoods of no or no clinically significant effect of a treatment, compared with no treatment, or with a harmless placebo. The epistemological problem is not how to establish that a treatment technology has some effect or no effect in group samples, but rather that, because of many kinds of complexity (in the condition, in the sampling, in  individual  differences),  treatments  are  rarely  effective  for  all  individuals, and application of the data to care of the individual patient is not straightforward. for this, as is often said, thorough assessment and clinical judgement are needed to combine with knowledge of the basic and clinical science.

Complexity and uncertainty are most marked where there is evidence of  causation  by  multiple  factors  of  small  effect.  Conversely,  simplicity and  certainty  are  most  marked  where  single,  primary  causative  factors are  presumed. The single, primary factor approach works well in some specialist  areas  of  biomedicine  and  psychological  therapy,  and  less  well in  clinical  settings  with  caseload  is  not  restricted  to  a  narrow  range  of conditions,  in  settings  such  as  primary  care,  palliative  care,  care  of  the elderly,  and  community  mental  health.  Other  limitations  of  the  single factor approach are apparent in medical wards and outpatient clinics in which  some  patients  present  with  pain,  distress  and  activity  limitations in the absence of biomedically determined conditions. All these contexts require  a  broader  causal  theory,  more  complex,  about  which  much  is unknown at present, to do with biological/psychological/social interactions of the sort being explored for example in the chronic pain, health psychology and public health literatures.

This new complexity creates much uncertainty, in clinicians, patients and  students.  It  can  be  resolved  by  a  dogmatic  certainty  that  the  real cause  must  be  one  or  another  sort-something  biological,  psychological or social-though at the cost of selective inattention to other factors,

the  risk  of  over-reliance  on  one  treatment  approach,  and  detachment from  anomalies.  More  adaptively,  the  uncertainty  has  to  be  tolerated. The more responsibility  a  clinician  has,  the  more  obligation  they  have to know the science as well as the patient and to keep a mind open to complexity and alternatives, at the same time as needing to make definite decisions and recommendations one way or the other.

There are occasions, in response to questions from patients or from students as to causes, in complex cases, where single aetiology of large effect has been excluded, and the picture looks more like multiple aetiology of small effect, it is as correct as anything else to say:'it is a complex biopsychosocial picture'. This move is by all means somewhat vague and hand-waving,  connected  to  the  criticism  of  the  biopsychosocial  model reviewed  in  the  first  chapter,  that  it  is  vague  and  too  often  used  for unhelpful hand-waving. Engel's model has stood ready to accommodate emerging  findings  of  biopsychosocial  complexity,  and  being  so  accommodating  has  made  it  hard  to  capture  in  a  few  words  except  vaguely. However, complexity and uncertainty have come from the science; they are  not  peculiar  features  of  a  model-no point blaming the messenger. And,  in  fairness  to  the  biopsychosocial  model,  the  generalised  single primary  cause  models  are  the  same-vague  hand-waving  to  everything being  biological/biomedical,  or  else  all  psychological,  or  social.  The science  of  the  past  few  decades  has  all  but  ruled  out  these  single  primary  cause  general  models,  and  endorsed  the  broader  biopsychosocial approach. The broader approach is also able to be more discriminating, more empirically based than the previous generalised single factor models. Biological, psychological and social factors may be involved in specific health conditions, at specific stages, but whether they are or not, and in what degree, is not known in advance, but only by doing the science.

## 4.4 comPare and contrast Physical and mental health conditions

## Psychiatry and 'The Rest of Medicine'

Psychiatry is  obviously  psychological,  at  first  glance,  but  also  obviously social,  at  second  glance,  while  biological  to  a  degree,  while  the  rest  of medicine-according  to  the  biomedical  model-manages  well  enough with the biological only. In this sense, the question of psychiatry's relation to 'the rest of medicine' stands proxy for the rationale and validity

of the biopsychosocial model-and vice versa. In fact, Engel chose just this issue as the starting place for his 1977 paper; he turned on its head the  aspiration  for  psychiatry  to  emulate  the  rest  of  medicine,  recommending the opposite: make the rest of medicine more like psychiatrymore psychosocial, not biological only [4] (p. 129).

On the other hand, as we noted at the beginning of the  first  chapter  (under  the  heading 'The  Presumed  'Overarching  framework''), the  'rest  of  medicine'  is  not  one  thing,  and  the  various  medical  specialities  differ  in  their  relative  involvement  with  biological,  psychological and social factors. Primary care (also known as general medical practice, or family medicine) is much involved with the psychosocial, as is public health, and palliative care, as well as many aspects of care on acute medical wards. In this sense, the contrast is not so much between psychiatry with the rest of medicine, but between psychiatry along with many other areas  of  medicine,  contrasted  with  biomedicine.  Taking  these  considerations  things  into  account  much  qualifies  the  idea  that  psychiatry  is  so different because of its involvement with the psychosocial. Nevertheless, psychiatry can still be regarded as the odd one out compared with 'the rest of medicine', for reasons that go much deeper than detailed and discriminating  considerations  of  the  above  sort  about  varying  degrees  of involvement with the psychosocial.

## The Difference Is Deeply Theorised and Institutionalised

The  perceived  difference  between  mental  and  physical  health  conditions and healthcare is underpinned by the great historical dichotomies outlined  in  the  first  chapter,  Sect.  1.3  (under  the  heading 'Prejudicial Theory: Physicalism, Reductionism, Dualism'): mind/body dualism,  and  the  separation  of  the  social  and  moral  sciences  from  the  natural sciences. Thomas  Szasz's highly influential 1960s  critique of psychiatry  [54]  relied  on  these  dichotomies.  But  worse,  the  two  sides of  the  dichotomies  were  not  equally  balanced  in  respect  of  scientific validity,  especially  in  connection  with  determining  causes  and  interventions-matters fundamental to medicine. Rather, against the background of  physicalist  reductionism,  which  underpinned  the  dichotomies,  as reviewed  in  Sect. 2.2,  while  physical  health  conditions  involved  recognised causes and effects, researchable and manageable by proper biological/biomedical science, mental disorders were something else altogether, barely recognisable let alone theorised, and psychiatry along with them.

Built on top of the historical dichotomies in deep theory are the reinforcing, maintaining effects of having organised the whole of healthcare training  and  delivery  around  physical  health  problems  on  one  side  of the  road  and  mental  health  problems  on  the  other.  On  one  side,  biomedicine performs best with biological mechanisms in physical diseases, and psychosocial involvement, if any, is out of scope. On the other side, theoretical  or  practical  preoccupation  with  'mental  abnormalities'  such as  delusions and other hard to understand mental states and behaviour tends to neglect somatic signs and symptoms, and does not bring into focus people as a whole and their social circumstances. The dichotomy between  mental  and  physical  health  conditions  is  historically  theorised and currently institutionalised and practised.

## The Biopsychosocial Model Highlights Similarities

There are several reasons why the picture is changing however. Mental health  conditions  are  more  evident,  linked  to  increasing  public  awareness and efforts to decrease stigma, and the extent of associated activity impairments such as days lost to work is better understood and increasingly recognised as comparable with those in physical health conditions. It  is  increasingly  recognised  that  physical  and  mental  health  problems often co-occur, complicating each other, and therefore also complicating our  healthcare  system,  given  that  it  is  currently  organised  on  the  basis of  separating  them  out,  along  with  the  clinical  expertise  for  managing them. And as regards aetiology, public health and prevention, recent epidemiology suggests that the two kinds of health problem can share aetiological risk factors, possibly implicating shared mechanisms. These social and  scientific  developments  change  policy,  as  for  example  in  the  UK NHS policy paper 'No health without mental health' [55]. In this section, we review these issues in more detail, with reference to the biopsychosocial theory and science set out in previous chapters.

Considering  aetiology,  we  noted  in the  first  chapter,  Sect.  1.2,  the emerging  epidemiological  evidence  that  implicates  psychosocial  as  well as biological risk factors including genetic for many physical health conditions.  It  also  suggests  that  some  risks  of  all  sorts  are  shared  between some physical  health  conditions  and  some  mental  health  conditions;  it is not the case that risk factors divide neatly into those to physical health on the one hand and those to mental health on the other. Drilling into hypothesised mechanisms, we saw in section Stress as a Biopsychosocial

Causal  Mechanism  that  chronic  stress  and  its  biological  effects  are ommonly  implicated  in  the  aetiology  of  many  physical  and  mental c health conditions. Again, it is not the case that pathogenic mechanisms neatly divide between those for physical health conditions and those for mental health conditions. As corollary, preventative strategies and technologies, for many physical and mental health conditions, overlap. Public health does not have two unconnected tasks, one for physical health promotion and another for mental health promotion.

Post  onset,  especially  for  the  long-term  conditions,  also  considered in Sect.  1.2  under  the  heading 'Emerging  Evidence  of  Psychosocial Causation', psychosocial factors affect biomedical management, in matters such as access and collaboration over management plan, for   example ongoing  medication;  as  well  as  affecting  psychological  adjustment  and quality  of  social  life.  These  diverse  psychosocial  issues  coincide  or  at least overlap for both physical health and mental health long term conditions. We went on to note the connected finding that physical health problems raise risk for mental health problems and vice versa. The causal pathways  are  diverse,  but  include  such  as  chronic  physical  ill-health imposes activity  restrictions  and  loss  of  amenity,  and  pain,  all  of  which raise  risk  of  high  anxiety  and  low  mood;  mental  health  chronic  conditions  can  be  associated  with  risk  factors  for  physical  health  problems, such as social  exclusion,  poor  diet,  smoking,  and  higher  thresholds  for medical attention to physical health problems. The picture that emerges, therefore, is not that of patients with physical health problems, and an entirely different set of patients with mental health problems. All these considerations-regarding aetiology, adjustment, quality of life, and bidirectional  complications-serve  to  break  down  the  dichotomy  between mental health conditions and physical health conditions. They highlight the  importance  of  psychological  and  social  as  well  as  biological  factors in  health  and  disease,  and  they  need  broad  biopsychosocial  theory  to accommodate them.

The general drift of the biopsychosocial systemic approach-as can be expected from its name-is to view physical and mental health conditions under a unified 'health problem' heading. The core common feature is a substantial negative effect on the person's agency, associated with distress:  with  worry  and  fear  about  their  safety  and  their  future  and  their dependents.

In the broader biopsychosocial picture, the key secondary difference between physical health problems and health problems is that some but

not  all  physical  health  problems  have  a  biomedically  identifiable  maintaining  cause-a  disease  process  or  lesion-while  this  is  probably  not the  case  for  mental  health  problems.  This  is  a  critical  difference  and  it stands out most clearly for physical health problems that are biomedically well  understood  and  treatable,  in  a  relatively  short  timeframe,  without therefore impacting on what is presupposed as an otherwise normal life. Cure of infectious  disease  by  antibiotics,  surgical  interventions  that  are now routine such as hip replacements and even cardiac surgery, especially where all the psychological and social conditions for access, detection and intervention are in place, and which therefore can be ignored, stand out as triumphs of biomedicine. If we start with the underlying presumption that physical health problems are purely physical-and entirely different from mental health problems-these are the cases we will attend to, and we would tend to neglect the kinds and aspects of physical health problems  that  don't  fit  the  picture:  regarding  aetiology,  chronic  conditions and comorbidities as reviewed briefly above. And, coming from the other direction, the assumption that mental health problems are quite different from physical health problems because exclusively to do with the mind, or the person, is also problematic. for example, some mental health conditions have some response to pharmacotherapy. It is true that psychological therapy is often indicated along with medication for mental health conditions, but equally, as is now being recognised, it is often indicated alongside medical management of physical health conditions [56]. As to mental health conditions, as opposed to physical health conditions, being integral to the personality, the contrast is less marked for long-term conditions  of  either  type,  as  previously  remarked  in Sect. 4.2.  Also,  some mental health conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder are typically seen by the person as externally imposed, rather than as integral to themselves. This is probably the rule for mental health conditions rather than the exception. This is a complicated clinical area but the point, in short, is that only for a particular sub-class of mental health conditions is there a strong presumed link with personality, that is, the so-called 'personality disorders'.

Another way of viewing the similarities and differences between mental  health conditions and physical health conditions is through the lens of the hypothetical virtual biopsychosocial research framework sketched above (Sect. 4.3). In addition to the specification of biological and neurological systemic functioning, this framework was imagined to include specification  of  health  problems,  physical  and  mental,  and  to  have

complete  coverage  of  stages,  from  risks  of  onset  through  to  post-onset  maintaining  causal  mechanisms,  interventions,  and  factors  affecting adjustment and quality-of-life in long-term conditions. The columns of the grid would include biological, psychological and social factors, and the cells research findings. The upshot of this is that the relative importance  of  biological  compared  with  psychosocial  factors  would  be  most marked between mental and some physical health problems at just onealbeit very important-point,  namely  post-onset  maintaining  causal mechanisms and interventions. for some physical health problems, these would  be  mainly  biological  with  little  psychosocial.  But  for  all  other stages:  aetiological  pathways  to  onset,  and  post-onset  adjustment  and quality-of-life, the pattern of relative weights of biological, psychological and social would be evened out and would certainly not be all biological for all physical health problems, and all psychological and social for mental health problems.

## 4.5 locating the bioPsychosocial model

We noted in  the  first  chapter  that  the  biopsychosocial  model  has  been charged with vagueness in  the  clinic,  as  well  as  vagueness  as  a  scientific theory and as a 'model'. It is true that Engel wrote his 1980 paper [5] on clinical  application of the model, giving rise to the reasonable inference that the biopsychosocial model was a guide to clinical practice. However, as we went on to note in Sect. 1.2, there have been many developments in  the  intervening  decades  with  more direct relevance to scientific content  and  guiding  clinical  practice.  There  have  been  new  research  programmes  to  investigate  the  causes  of  diseases  and  disease  mechanisms, and technologies for prevention, early detection and treatment. These, in turn,  have  led  to  treatment  guidelines  for  specific  conditions  at  specific stages, to the whole apparatus of evidence-based clinical care, to be used alongside a thorough assessment of the individual case. The point is simply that, given all this basic and clinical science of the last few decades, the biopsychosocial model cannot usefully be regarded as some additional statement  of  the  science  or  as  a  tool  to  guide  clinical  decision-making. It is true the model advises us to keep one's mind open to the range of biopsychosocial  factors,  but  the  treatment  guidelines  and  the  science behind them already now say this, if applicable, and we don't need a general model to repeat the fact-especially not to repeat it vaguely instead of paying close attention to the science of specific conditions and stages.

While  this  may  be  a  solution  for  the  biopsychosocial  model  of  the vagueness problem, it works only, as we noted in section 'So What's the Point  of  a  'General  Model'?',  by  raising  the  more  fundamental  question: what is the point of having a general model at all? We then located the task of the general model as defining biopsychosocial ontology and causation,  in  Sect. 1.3,  noting  the  special  need  for  this  because  of  the deeply entrenched assumptions of physicalism, dualism and reductionism that have been so influential in the development of the life and human sciences. With these assumptions, only physical properties and causation appear  real,  while  the  mind  is  a  non-causal  epiphenomena,  and  social organisation and processes can hardly be comprehended at all. In short, the  scientific  and  philosophical  back  story  is  more  or  less  entirely  antithetical  to  theorising  biopsychosocial  ontology  and  interactions.  Hence the  need  for  a  new  general  theory  for  this  purpose.  We  pursued  this, tracking the science, in Chapters 2 and 3.

In  Chapter  2  on  biology  we  used  the  approach  especially  suited  for the  present  purpose  that  relates  biological  processes  to  physics.  Life forms do extraordinary things with energy, holding up the general direction  of  the  second  law  of  thermodynamics,  for  a  while,  the  key  being control by genetic code, essentially prone to error, to doing it differently, making space for evolutionary diversification.  The  key  ontological  shift compared with physicalism  is  away  from  few  primary  physical  qualities and  laws,  variations  on  the  theme  of  energy  and  energy  conservation, towards multiplicity and diversity of dynamical forms with their own distinctive principles of change and causal interaction, all however retaining consistency with the physics of the matter. The corresponding key epistemological shifts are from generality to specificity, simplicity to complexity, and from knowledge of inviolable facts to active knowing, something more like  'trial  and  error'.  Moving  on  from  biology,  the  psychological and the social were considered in Chapter 3. The primary concept of the psychological is identified as agency. This connotes altogether: causation, in the sense of regulatory control, authorship, individual differences, and self-determination. Agency is thoroughly biological: it is embodied, and accordingly has to secure the conditions necessary for biological life, specifically those related to maintaining appropriate energy differentials. At the same time, agency for us social beings needs recognition in the social group,  and  generally  assumes  a  socio-political  dimension,  connoted  by the related concept of autonomy. The primary function of the social is

identified  in  the  model  as  the  regulatory  control  of  the  distribution  of resources necessary for biological life, but also of resources and opportunities for psychological development and cultivation of agency.

In this biopsychosocial theory, concepts of health and disease appear in  prototypical  form  at  the  beginning,  in  the  differences  between  survival and non-survival of biological organisms, between a biological system's  working  or  breaking  down.  The  basic  facts  of  biological  health and disease carry through into the biopsychosocial whole, being joined by concepts of psychological health and ill-health, related to agency, and concepts of psychosocial health and disadvantage, marked by exclusion from social  relationships,  resources  and  opportunities.  Causal  pathways run within and between all these systems and the many subsystems that serve them, in health and ill-health. The exact pathways and the size of effects vary with the health condition, its stage, and the challenges it presents to the person as agent.

As well as major developments in the basic and clinical sciences since Engel's  original  papers,  there  have  been  other  major  developments  in dedicated models of health and disease and clinical practice. Three such have been mentioned so far in this chapter, Sect. 4.2: the social model of disability, which contests attribution of cause of activity limitations to the person rather than to the ill-resourced, socially excluding environment; the  model of patient-centred care, which locates the person as patient, their  aims  and  values,  at  the  centre  of  healthcare,  and  the  Recovery model,  which  theorises  the  need  of  the  person  with  a  chronic  health condition to recover their life notwithstanding. These dedicated models emphasise specific important aspects of healthcare that broadly relate to individual  differences,  the  person,  the  broader  social  and  political  context, and managing with chronic conditions-typically with explicit contrast  with  a  perceived  simple  and  over-simple  'medical  model',  with  its focus on biological disease processes in the individual. In this sense, these models have taken up challenges and tasks of the sort that Engel identified, but with more elaboration, depth and detail than the biopsychosocial model itself.

As  proposed  here,  biopsychosocial  theory  and  the  biopsychosocial model define the conceptual foundations of a new approach to health, disease and healthcare, one that responds to the accumulating evidence implicating many and diverse processes of kinds indicated by the name, and more besides, particularly the physics and chemistry of our bodies

and  the  environment,  at  one  end,  and  social  and  economic  policy  at the other. It is more general than the science of specifics, or single disciplines,  or  dedicated  models  of  clinical  care.  It  is  more  like  a  view  of human nature, based in the current science, one that includes propensity to health and disease. As a view of human nature and its vulnerabilities, the biopsychosocial model is comparable to the biomedical model. The biomedical model has two versions however: the old version, running to approximately mid-twentieth century, assuming, as Engel saw, physicalist reductionism and dualism, the other brand new and going from strength to strength since, at the cutting edge of reconstructing the relationship between  biology,  physics  and  chemistry,  and  articulating  new  models involving  not  only  the  inviolable  physics  and  chemistry  of  energy,  but also vulnerable forms regulated to ends. The new research programmes have  advanced  biomedicine,  but  at  a  conceptual  level  they  open  up worlds beyond the biological to include the psychological and the social. This conceptual opening up is of huge importance given that the conceptual foundations of health science and healthcare need to be able to comprehend and respond to all the new findings on psychosocial factors that  have  been  accumulating  over  the  past  few  decades,  on  the  social determinants of health, the effectiveness of psychological and social treatments, and the increasing prevalence of long-term health conditions.

Biopsychosocial theory, incorporating the psychosocial and the political, also involves morality. The biopsychosocial model of health and disease  has  conceptual  connections  with  bioethics.  This  is  a  contrast  with the biomedical model, in either its old or new forms. To the extent that the biomedical model embraced physicalist reductionism, it was not entitled to any normative concepts, not even the difference between health and disease, and definitely not morals. Normativity has no place in physics  and  chemistry.  The  new  biomedical  model  that  invokes  regulatory control  mechanisms  has  normativity,  but  so  far  restricted  to  internal somatic systems and does not yet comprehend the whole human being as an agent in the interpersonal, socio-political world. To have this reach, the  biopsychosocial  model  is  required,  and  the  term  'bioethics'  could be  expanded  to  'biopsychosocial  ethics'.  At  the  foundational  level,  all normativity is interconnected. The 4 principles of bioethics laid out by Beauchamp and Childress [57] employ terms and relations that are foundational  in  biopsychosocial  theory:  autonomy  of  the  person,  harm  and benefits  to  the  person,  social  distribution  of  resources.  The  biopsychosocial  theory  does  not  resolve  ethical  disputes  but  indicates  their  terms

and  the  friction  points  where  they  arise.  Biological  health,  psychological  health,  autonomous  exercise  of  agency  and  values,  social  provision of resources necessary for these things-are all goods from our point of view as biopsychosocial beings, but they can be hard to achieve together since they can come into conflict one with one another. The individual may  come  into  conflict  with  family,  clinicians  or  the  law,  over  what  is good for them; what is in the interests of the individual may conflict with what is in the interests of the community; attribution of 'illness' or 'disability' may have benefits in terms of access to healthcare and support, but it downgrades recognition of autonomy, with potential for harm; provision of resources can conflict with promoting agency; equal distribution of resources competes with individual and group interests. And there are boundary issues, for example as to when biological life becomes psychological life with moral value protected by law, or as to when psychological life  has  come to an end in severe brain damage while the biology continues. Biopsychosocial theory cannot resolve these many kinds of moral dilemmas, but their terms and the potential for conflicts over priorities and boundaries appear at its foundations.
