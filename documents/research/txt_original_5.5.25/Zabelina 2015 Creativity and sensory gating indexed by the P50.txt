Attentionabstract
Creativity has previously been linked with atypical attention, but it is not clear what aspects of attention,
or what types of creativity are associated. Here we investigated speci ﬁc neural markers of a very early
form of attention, namely sensory gating, indexed by the P50 ERP, and how it relates to two measures of
creativity: divergent thinking and real-world creative achievement. Data from 84 participants revealedthat divergent thinking (assessed with the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking) was associated with se-
lective sensory gating, whereas real-world creative achievement was associated with “leaky ”sensory
gating, both in zero-order correlations and when controlling for academic test scores in a regression.Thus both creativity measures related to sensory gating, but in opposite directions. Additionally, di-
vergent thinking and real-world creative achievement did not interact in predicting P50 sensory gating,
suggesting that these two creativity measures orthogonally relate to P50 sensory gating. Finally, the ERPeffect was speci ﬁc to the P50 –neither divergent thinking nor creative achievement were related to later
components, such as the N100 and P200. Overall results suggest that leaky sensory gating may help
people integrate ideas that are outside of focus of attention, leading to creativity in the real world;
whereas divergent thinking, measured by divergent thinking tests which emphasize numerous re-sponses within a limited time, may require selective sensory processing more than previously thought.

1. Introduction
Although numerous papers have claimed that creative
thinking is linked with atypical attention, it remains unresolved
which types of creativity and which aspects of attention are as-
sociated. There are at least two seemingly contradictory proposals,
but it is possible that both operate, each on different aspects of
creativity.
Theﬁrst proposal suggests that creative people may have par-
ticularly broad or “leaky ”attention, or a propensity to deploy at-
tention over a wider focus or a larger range of stimuli at once.
Anecdotes indicate that numerous eminent creators, including
Richard Wagner, Marcel Proust, and Charles Darwin strongly la-
mented the distracting nature of noise ( Kasof, 1997 ). More im-
portantly, some empirical evidence supports this putative asso-
ciation between creativity and leaky attention, particularly in dual
task situations. For instance, when asked to repeat information
presented to one ear, while attempting to remember information
presented to the other ear, creative people (creativity assessedwith the Pattern Meaning and Similarities subtests from Wallach
and Kogan's (1965) battery of creativity tests) make more errors of
intrusion from the non-shadowed ear ( Rawlings, 1985 ). Moreover,
creative people are more likely to incorporate seemingly irrelevant
cues when solving anagrams (creativity assessed with Mednick ’s
(1962) Remote Associate's Test (RAT; Mendelsohn and Griswold,
1964 ), recalling words and phrases (creativity assessed via RAT;
Russell, 1976 ), and performing auditory discrimination tasks
(creativity assessed with a Creative Achievement Questionnaire
(CAQ; Carson et al., 2005 );Carson et al., 2003 ).
Leaky attention is akin to reduced latent inhibition, or a re-
duced ability to screen or inhibit from conscious awareness stimuli
previously experienced as irrelevant ( Lubow, 1973 ). Reduced latent
inhibition may enhance creativity by enlarging the range of un-
ﬁltered stimuli available in conscious awareness, thereby increas-
ing the possibility that novel and useful combinations of stimuli
will be synthesized ( Carson et al., 2003 ). Therefore leaky attention
may underlie both costs and bene ﬁts of creative cognition; noise
and other environmental stimuli can serve as distractors for
creative people, and lead them to make errors on some tasks. At
the same time, leaky attention may help people integrate ideas
that are outside the focus of attention into their current in-
formation processing, leading to creative thinking.Contents lists available at ScienceDirect

An alternative proposal of how attention relates to creativity
suggests that creativity depends on the ability to focus and shift
attention, supporting cognitive ﬂexibility. More generally, crea-
tivity may rely heavily on executive functions ( De Dreu et al., 2012 ;
Gilhooly et al., 2007 ;Nusbaum and Silvia, 2011 ;Wiley and Jarosz,
2012 ), i.e., general-purpose control mechanisms such as the ability
of the cognitive system to con ﬁgure itself for the performance of
speci ﬁc task goals ( Botvinick et al., 2001 ;Miyake and Friedman,
2012 ). Indeed, in order to create a highly original thought or
product, people have to focus and persist on the task at hand. For
instance, the preparation stage of creativity involves information
gathering, mastering a knowledge base, and identifying the pro-
blem ( Wallas, 1926 ). These behaviors surely bene ﬁt from focus and
persistence. Leonardo da Vinci, for example, one of the most re-
cognized creative polymaths, was said to have “obsessive attention
to detail ”(Lester, 2012 , p. 191). Marie Currie described her focus
during schoolwork as “allowing no lapses of attention (p. 72), ”as
well as concentrating her attention “without even hearing the
mounting roar of chatter ”(p. 97; Curie and Sheean, 2001 ).
Emerging neuroscienti ﬁc literature provides support for cog-
nitive inhibition involved in creative thinking. Inferior frontal
gyrus (IFG), a region associated with interference resolution in the
left hemisphere ( Thomspon-Schill et al., 1999 ), and cognitive in-
hibition in the right hemisphere ( Aron, 2007 ), has been implicated
in divergent thinking tasks ( Abraham et al., 2012 ;Chrysikou and
Thompson-Schill, 2011 ;Kleibeuker et al., 2013 ;Vartanian et al.,
2013 ; for review, see Gonen-Yaacovi et al., 2013 ), which measure
the ability to generate many original responses to a given problem
within a limited time ( Guilford, 1950 ;Torrance, 1974 ), and are
often used as measures of creative cognition.
The assertion that creative cognition requires focused and
persistent attention seems to directly contradict the ﬁrst hypoth-
esis, that creative thinking is associated with leaky attention.These ideas, however, may not be mutually exclusive. It may be
that different measures of creativity are associated with different
forms of attention. Our recent series of experiments, using a model
task in which people attend to either local or global aspects of
attention (e.g., a large S constructed of small Es), suggest that there
are distinct attentional components that independently relate to
two different measures of creativity: divergent thinking versus
real-world creative achievement. We ﬁnd that divergent thinkers
show selective focus and rapid inhibition of attention, thus ex-
hibiting ﬂexible attention: they easily switch their attention from
an incorrect attentional focus to a correct one ( Zabelina et al.,
2015 ).
Whereas divergent thinking tests are timed laboratory mea-
sures of creative cognition, real-world creative achievement is a
survey of people's creative achievements over their lifetime. Un-
like the ﬂexible attention observed in divergent thinking, we ﬁnd
that real-world creative achievers show leaky attention; when
asked to identify a target that competes or is facilitated by other
information presented concurrently with the target, real-world
creative achievers are more likely to be affected by the competing
information ( Zabelina et al., 2015 ).
Here we examine how early in the processing stream these
attentional differences between divergent thinkers and real-world
creative achievement occur. Speci ﬁcally, we examine whether
different measures of creativity relate to sensory gating (sensory
inhibition) of meaningless stimuli, in the absence of task goals.
Thus we examine speci ﬁc neural markers of sensory gating,
namely the P50 event-related potential (ERP), a neurophysiologi-
cal response that occurs 50 ms after stimulus onset (for review,
Patterson et al., 2008 ). In this paradigm two auditory clicks are
presented to a participant, and the extent to which the second
click is inhibited compared to the ﬁrst click (P50 of the second
click/P50 of the ﬁrst click) is seen as a marker of sensory gating(Patterson et al., 2008 ). P50 is a very early, automatic, form of
sensory gating, in ﬂuencing which stimuli capture attention ( Ba-
nich, 2004 ;Gjini et al., 2011 ). Some view the P50 marker of sen-
sory gating as a marker to some psychopathology, particularly
schizophrenia ( Olincy et al., 2010 ).
With respect to P50 and cognitive functioning, studies have
reported inconsistent outcomes. Associations between increased
P50 sensory gating and better attention, motor speed, and learn-
ing, have been observed, mostly in small samples of patients with
schizophrenia ( Cullum et al., 1993 ;Erwin et al., 1998 ;Hsieh et al.,
2004 ), and in Alzheimer's patients or healthy elderly controls
(Thomas et al., 2010 ). These studies are consistent with reports of
the associations between better P50 sensory gating and better
orienting of attention, better inhibition of con ﬂicting information
(Wan et al., 2008 ), and fewer commission errors on the Delayed
Memory Task ( Lijfﬁjt et al., 2009 ) in healthy participants. However,
some studies have failed to ﬁnd such associations ( Cullum et al.,
1993 ;Thoma et al., 2006 ).
Sensory gating, as measured by the P50, varies in the general
population ( Patterson et al., 2008 ). We predicted different rela-
tions between sensory gating and the two distinct measures of
creativity.
First, given that divergent thinking is associated with the ability
for selective focus and rapid inhibition of attention, supportingattenional ﬂexibility ( Zabelina et al., 2015 ;Nusbaum and Silvia,
2011 ), as well as with neural regions implicated in cognitive in-
hibition ( Gonen-Yaacovi et al., 2013 ), we predict that divergent
thinking will relate to more selective sensory gating.
Second, given that real-world creative achievement is asso-
ciated with reduced latent inhibition ( Carson et al., 2003 ), and
with leaky attention on behavioral tasks ( Zabelina et al., 2015 ), we
predict that real-world creative achievement will be related to
reduced, or leaky sensory gating.
Thirdly, hypothetically the two measures of creativity com-
bined could better predict sensory gating. However, based on prior
research suggesting that divergent thinking and creative achieve-
ment are only modestly related ( Runco and Acar, 2012 ;Zabelina
et al., 2015 ), and that only creative achievement related to our
behavioral measure of leaky attention ( Zabelina et al., 2015 ), we
did not expect divergent thinking and creative achievement to
interact in predicting sensory gating.
We also considered academic achievement scores as a proxy for
general intelligence and as a control variable, given that academic
achievement may relate to divergent thinking through the com-
mon component of performance on a cognitive measure, and may
relate to creative achievement through the common component of
achievement. Additionally, we assessed the speci ﬁcity of the as-
sociation between the P50 sensory gating and divergent thinking
and creative achievement by examining later attentional ERP
components, namely N100 and P200.
2. Method
2.1. Participants
One hundred participants were recruited to participate in the
present study. Because data collection failed for 3 participants, we
were left with 97 participants ages 18 –30 (mean age ¼20.55,
SD¼2.51, male/female ¼32/65). Participants were pre-screened to
ensure they had no hearing or head injuries. None of the partici-
pants abused alcohol or drugs, and none smoked. None of the
participants had been hospitalized for psychiatric or neurologic
reasons. Four participants had history of depression or mild an-
xiety (three in the past, but in remission at the time of the study
and not taking medication; one current, treated with Zoloft). AllD.L. Zabelina et al. / Neuropsychologia 69 (2015) 77 –84 78

subjects were Caucasian, and right-handed, as assessed by the
Chapman Handedness Questionnaire ( Chapman and Chapman,
1987 ). Participants completed an informed consent prior to par-
ticipating in the study, and received $20 for their participation. Thestudy was approved by the Institutional Review Board of North-western University.
2.2. Procedure
Participants were tested individually, with each session lasting
up to two hours. Participants completed a timed laboratory test ofdivergent thinking, and completed a questionnaire surveying theircreative achievements in the real world, before undergoing thesensory gating paradigm.
2.3. Measures
2.3.1. Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults (ATTA; Goff and Torrance,
2002 )
To assess divergent thinking, participants completed the ATTA
–a shortened form of the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking
(Torrance, 1974 ). The ATTA consists of three activities (3 min each),
one involving verbal (written) responses (e.g., generating pro-blems that may arise from being able to walk on air or ﬂy without
being in an airplane or a similar vehicle), and two involving ﬁgural
responses (e.g., using incomplete ﬁgures to make pictures). Re-
sponses are scored for ﬂuency (i.e., a count of the number of
pertinent responses), and originality (i.e., the number of responsesthat are not typically produced, according to normative data), withscores summed across the three activities ( Goff and Torrance,
2002 ). The total divergent thinking score re ﬂects a weighted score
ofﬂuency plus two times originality, to equally weight the two
scores, since the average ﬂuency score (14.1) was approximately
double the average originality score (7.2) (see Runco and Acar,
2012 for suggestions on scoring divergent thinking tests). Two
participants did not follow task instructions, thus we were notable to score their tests. The average divergent thinking score was29.00 ( SD¼7.98, range 15 –50). Given that recent approaches often
focus on ideational creativity ( Fink and Benedek, 2014 ;Runco and
Mraz, 1992 ), we also separately considered only the ATTA origin-
ality score in our analyses.
2.3.2. Creative Achievement Questionnaire (CAQ: Carson et al., 2005 )
We assessed real-world creative behavior with the Creative
Achievement Questionnaire, a survey on which participants cata-loged any prior creative achievements across ten creative domains(visual art, music, dance, architectural design, creative writing,humor, inventions, scienti ﬁc discovery, theater and ﬁlm, and cu-
linary arts). In the music domain, for example, questions rangefrom “I have no training or recognized talent in this area ”(score of
0) to “my compositions have been critiqued in a national pub-
lication ”(score of 7). In the Scienti ﬁc Discovery subset, scores vary
from “I have no training or recognized ability in this ﬁeld”(score of
0) to “my work has been cited by other scientists in national
publications ”(score of 7). Separate domain scores were then
combined to form a single index of creative achievement. Oneparticipant's total creative achievement score was more than 6 SDs
above the mean (possibly due to an error), and was therefore re-moved from further analyses. The mean creative achievementscore was 12.95 ( SD
¼9.77, range 0 –48). CAQ scores were posi-
tively skewed, therefore we used the signed log transformation tonormalize the CAQ distribution.
2.3.3. Academic achievement scores
As a proxy for general intelligence, participants provided their
academic achievement test scores (Scholastic Assessment Test(SAT) or American College Testing (ACT); College Board, 2012 ;ACT
Inc., 2014 ), which we converted into percentile scores based on the
national statistics for all test-takers in 2012 ( M¼98.01, SD¼2.20,
range 87 –100). In prior studies in our lab, self-reported scores
were con ﬁrmed with actual scores through the admissions of ﬁce,
and the two correlated r¼.97 ( Wegbreit et al., 2012 ). Fourteen
people did not provide their academic test scores (therefore de-
grees of freedom will be different when academic test scores are
included in the analyses). The range of scores was very narrow, so
this measure should be interpreted cautiously.
2.3.4. Sensory gating paradigm
Consistent with literature on P50, auditory modality was used
to measure sensory gating (e.g., Cadenhead et al., 2000 ;Chang
et al., 2012 ;Olincy et al., 2010 ). The sensory gating measure oc-
curred within a sound-attenuated, electrically-insulated booth,
and was presented through the headphones using Presentation
16.1 software (Neurobehavioral Systems). The task consisted of
passively listening to two auditory clicks per trial, each a ﬂat
broadband square wave of 1 ms duration, with an average in-
tensity of 89 dB. The two clicks were presented with an intra-pair
interval of 500 ms, and a pseudo-randomized inter-pair interval of
6, 8, or 10 s.
Participants were instructed to sit in an upright but relaxed
position, with eyes open and focused on a ﬁxation cross located on
a computer screen approximately 1 m away. Participants were
asked to remain relaxed and to refrain from blinking during pre-
sentation of the clicks, but to otherwise blink naturally in between
trials. These parameters were set to minimize muscle tension and
movement artifact. The EEG activity of each participant was re-
corded continuously during 5 blocks of 20 trials each, for a total of
100 click pairs. Participants were offered self-timed breaks be-
tween each block (breaks generally lasted less than 30 s). Thetesters, in an adjacent room, observed the participant via camera,
and interacted with the participant during the inter-block intervals
to ensure that all participants remained comfortable and alert.
2.3.5. Electrophysiological recordings
EEG data were recorded from 14 tin electrodes attached inside
an Electro-Cap with Electrogel (Electro-Cap Intl., Eaton, Ohio) as
the conductance agent. Using the 10/20 system, electrodes were
positioned at FP1, FZ, FP2, F3, F4, F7, F8, C3, CZ, C4, P3, PZ, P4, and
mastoid locations M1 and M2 (see Bak et al., 2011 ;Lijfﬁjt et al.,
2009 ). Impedance for all electrodes was less than 5 k
Ω. Data were
collected using the Acquire module of Scan 4.5 (NeuroScan Labs, El
Paso, Texas). Signals were continuously sampled at 1000 Hz, and
ﬁltered online between .05 and 100 Hz (AC mode). The ground
electrode was ﬁxed inside the cap between the FPz and Fz elec-
trodes. The left mastoid electrode (M1) was used as an online
reference electrode.
2.3.6. ERP waveform and component analysis
The Edit module of Scan 4.5 and Curry 7 software (NeuroScan
Labs, El Paso, Texas) were used to conduct of ﬂine EEG analyses.
Following methodology reported in prior P50 ERP investigations
(Cadenhead et al., 2000 ;Chang et al., 2012 ;Olincy et al., 2010 ), the
continuous EEG data for each participant were ﬁrst re-referenced
off-line from the left mastoid (M1) to the linked mastoids (mean of
M1 and M2), which was appropriate given our focus on the mid-
line ( Luck, 2014 ). Data were digitally high-pass ﬁltered at 1 Hz
(12 dB). Trials contaminated with artifacts (amplitude values ex-
ceeding /C075 to 75 mV, blinks during clicks –rejected based on FP1
and FP2 electrodes, excessive muscle related activity) were all vi-
sually inspected and excluded from further analysis. Trials con-
taining artifacts were not included in ﬁnal waveform averaging,
leaving an average of 71 trials per participant ( SD¼22, range 23 –D.L. Zabelina et al. / Neuropsychologia 69 (2015) 77 –84 79

100; all results were maintained when controlling for the number
of epochs in a multiple regression, see Section 3 ). Following arti-
fact rejection, we segmented the EEG data into event-locked
epochs for both the ﬁrst and second click, with epoch durations
spanning 100 ms pre-stimulus to 499 ms post-stimulus. Non-re-
jected segments were baseline corrected using the pre-stimulus
interval ( /C0100 to 0 ms), as is typical in the literature (see Gume-
nyuk et al., 2013 ;Lijfﬁjt et al., 2009 ), low-pass ﬁltered at 70 Hz
(dB), and averaged to create ERP waveforms for both clicks. P50
amplitudes and latencies were scored at Cz using the trough-to-
peak method, following prior P50 methodology ( Cadenhead et al.,
2000 ;Chang et al., 2012 ;Olincy et al., 2010 ). This technique ﬁrst
identi ﬁes the actual P50 response as the most positive peak, in mV,
on the ERP waveform within the 35 –75 ms time window im-
mediately following the ﬁrst click onset. The value of the most
negative trough, immediately preceding the P50 peak of this
component within the 35 –75 ms time window, was then located
and subtracted from the previously designated peak to generate
the P50 amplitude value for each click (amplitude of P50 peak
minus amplitude of preceding trough). The P50 peak response to
the second click was always within 10 ms of the peak response to
theﬁrst click, and the P50 amplitude for the second click was
calculated using the same technique as described above. All wave-
forms were visually inspected to verify the integrity of the data.
After averaging across all trials, no P50 peak could be detected
for either Click 1 or Click 2 for ten of the 97 participants. These
participants ’data were excluded. Together with the 3 participants
for whom data collection failed, the sample resulted in the total of
84 participants (27 males) who were included in the ﬁnal analysis
(mean age ¼20.54, SD¼2.45).
For each participant, we computed the ﬁnal P50 ratio by di-
viding the trough-to-peak amplitude value for the averaged sec-
ond click by the corresponding trough-to-peak amplitude valuefor the averaged ﬁrst click ( Cadenhead et al., 2000 ;Chang et al.,
2012 ;Olincy et al., 2010 ). A participant who demonstrates selec-
tive sensory gating would manifest a smaller P50 response to the
second click, and thus a smaller Click 2/Click 1 ratio, typically less
than 1.0. A participant with leaky sensory gating would manifest a
P50 response to the second click that is approximately as large as,
or larger than that to the ﬁrst click, and thus a Click 2/Click 1 ratio
approaching, or lager than, 1.0.
Data from trials contaminated either with sound artifacts from
the headphones or with electrocardiography (EKG) signal were
corrected using event-locked and template-matching principal
component analysis (PCA) in Curry 7. For participants whose data
required PCA correction, the mean P50 sensory gating ratios did
not change following the artifact reduction procedure: before PCA
mean¼.84, SD¼.68, after PCA mean ¼.73, SD¼.63, t(17)¼/C01.69,
and p¼.11. Moreover, no signi ﬁcant differences existed between
the mean ratios of the participants whose data did versus thosewhose data did not undergo PCA artifact correction (no PCA
mean¼.71,SD¼.64, with PCA mean ¼.73, SD¼.63, t(82)¼.50, and
p¼.49. Overall results were also not altered when non-corrected
PCA data were used (see Supplementary materials ).
2.3.7. Analytical strategy
Weﬁrst computed zero-order correlations between P50 sen-
sory gating and divergent thinking, and P50 sensory gating and
creative achievement, and tested whether these correlations dif-
fered from each other. Next we performed two multiple linear
regressions: The ﬁrst regression used three scores –divergent
thinking, creative achievement, and academic achievement scores,
to predict P50 sensory gating. The second regression speci ﬁcally
tested the interactive effects of divergent thinking and creative
achievement in predicting P50 sensory gating. Finally we tested
the speci ﬁcity of the associations by examining how divergent
thinking and creative achievement related to later attentional ERP
components, the N100 and P200.
3. Results
The grand average of the ERPs at Cz is presented in Fig. 1 . There
was no reliable correlation between the Creative Achievement
Questionnaire (CAQ) and either the Abbreviated Torrance Test for
Adults (ATTA) total divergent thinking ( ﬂuencyþoriginality)
scores, nor with ATTA originality only, (both ps4.16), indicating
no association between divergent thinking and real-world creative
achievement in our sample. This is consistent with our previous
investigations ( Zabelina et al., 2014 ), although other studies have
observed modest correlations between divergent thinking and
creative achievement (see Plucker and Renzulli, 1999 ). Scoring
methods could alter the extent of such associations.
Divergent thinking was reliably correlated with academic
achievement scores, r(68)¼.27, p¼.03, suggesting an overlap in
the performance on the divergent thinking and academic
achievement tests (no association if ATTA originality is considered,
p4.15). Creative achievement and academic achievement were
unrelated, p4.78. We additionally examined the associations be-
tween age and divergent thinking, creative achievement, and
sensory gating, given that age can be associated with creative
achievement, in particular. We found no reliable associations in
our sample, all ps4.12.
3.1. Divergent thinking and sensory gating
Divergent thinking was negatively associated with the sensory
gating P50 ratio, r(80)¼/C0.30, p¼.006 ( r(80)¼/C0.29, p¼.01 if only
the ATTA originality score is considered). Thus, as predicted, in-
creased divergent thinking was associated with more selective
Fig. 1. Grand averages of the ERPs at Cz. Vertical dashed lines at 0 ms mark onset of Click 1, and at 500 ms mark the onset of Click 2. The P50 ratio is calculated as th e P50
peak to trough difference of Click 2 over the P50 peak to trough difference of Click 1. Thus larger difference in the wave-forms would result in a smaller ratio. Smaller ratios
represent more selective sensory gating, while larger ratios represent leakier sensory gating.D.L. Zabelina et al. / Neuropsychologia 69 (2015) 77 –84 80

sensory gating, i.e., a reduced response to Click 2 compared to
Click 1. This result suggests that divergent thinkers show more
selective sensory gating very early (50 ms after stimulus onset) inthe processing stream, with no task goals and meaningless stimuli.
3.2. Creative achievement and sensory gating
Real-world creative achievement was marginally positively
associated with the P50 ratio, r(81)¼.20, p¼.07. Thus, the more
creative achievements people reported, the leakier was their sen-
sory gating, early in the processing stream with meaningless sti-muli and no task goals.
3.3. Does P50 relate differently to divergent thinking and creative
achievement?
Although the correlation between the P50 sensory gating and
each creativity measure was only modest, the two creativity
measures related to sensory gating in opposite directions, and the
two correlations strongly differed from each other, Fisher'sz¼/C03.23, po.001.
3.4. Controlling for academic achievement scores
To test for independent associations between divergent think-
ing, creative achievement, and P50 sensory gating we performed a
multiple linear regression, with divergent thinking, real-world
creative achievement, and academic test scores as predictors ofP50 sensory gating. All variable were normally distributed, meet-ing the linearity assumptions underlying multiple linear regres-
sion, Shapiro –Wilk, ps4.05. As can be seen from Table 1 , di-
vergent thinking remained a signi ﬁcant predictor of the P50 sen-
sory gating, such that higher divergent thinking scores were linkedwith more selective sensory gating. Creative achievement, on the
other hand, was a signi ﬁcant predictor of P50 sensory gating in the
opposite direction, such that higher creative achievement scoreswere linked with leakier sensory gating. Interestingly, controlling
for the creativity variables, academic achievement scores reliably
predicted P50 sensory gating, such that higher academic
achievement was associated with more selective sensory gating.This effect was in the same direction as divergent thinking, in-dicating that selective sensory processing may be common to
successful performance on both tests of divergent thinking and
academic achievement tests.
Partial regression plots, depicting partial correlations between
divergent thinking and P50 sensory gating, and creative achieve-
ment and P50 sensory gating, are presented in Figs. 2 and 3, re-
spectively. All results were maintained when the number of EEGepochs was entered into the regression model as a control vari-
able. The number of epochs was not associated with P50 sensory
gating, r(82)¼/C0.11,p4.32.3.5. Do divergent thinking and creative achievement interact in
predicting P50 sensory gating?
With the P50 sensory gating ratios as the dependent variable,
we performed a multiple regression examining a potential inter-
active effect of divergent thinking and creative achievement. In a
multiple regression, divergent thinking and creative achievement
were z-scored, and an interaction term was calculated by multi-
plying the two predictors ( Aiken and West, 1991 ). All three pre-
dictors –both main effects and the interaction variable –were
then entered as simultaneous predictors of P50 sensory gating. As
expected, the interactive predictor (divergent thinking /C2creative
achievement) was not associated with P50 sensory gating,
β¼/C0.05,t(80)¼/C0.42,p¼.68. The main effects, on the other hand,
were both reliable, but in opposite directions, such that divergent
thinking was a signi ﬁcant negative predictor of leaky sensory
gating (i.e., predicted more selective sensory gating), β¼/C0.36, t
(80)¼/C03.29, p¼.002, while creative achievement was a sig-
niﬁcant positive predictor of leaky sensory gating, β¼.27,t(80)¼
2.43, p¼.02. These results suggest that divergent thinking andTable 1

creative achievement are additive rather than interactive pre-
dictors of sensory gating.
3.6. Is the effect speci ﬁc to P50?
To test the speci ﬁcity of the association of the P50 components
with divergent thinking and creative achievement, we performed
additional analyses with the N100 and P200 ERP components (as
computed in Lijfﬁjt et al., 2009 ). N100 ratio (Click 2/Click 1) did not
reliably relate to divergent thinking ( r(80)¼/C0.10,p¼.40), nor to
creative achievement ( r(81)¼.13, p¼.28). Similarly, P200 ratio
(Click 2/Click 1) was not associated with divergent thinking ( r
(80)¼/C0.05, p¼.71), nor with creative achievement ( r(81)¼/C0.01,
p¼.97). These results suggest that exclusively very early sensory
gating, as indexed by the P50 ERP, is differentially associated with
divergent thinking and creative achievement.
3.7. Analyses excluding family history of psychiatric disorder
Although not a focus of this paper, we collected information on
participants ’personal history and relatives ’history of psychiatric
disorders, because some view the P50 marker of sensory gating as
a marker to some psychopathology ( Cadenhead et al., 2000 ;Olincy
et al., 2010 ), and putative associations between psychopathology
and creativity have been reported in the literature ( Folley and
Park, 2005 ;Kinney et al., 2001 ;Kyaga et al., 2012 ). Seven partici-
pants had ﬁrst-degree relatives with diagnosed psychiatric ill-
nesses, and four participants had personal history of psychiatric
disorders (see Section 2 ). The association between divergent
thinking and P50 sensory gating was maintained when excluding
participants with history of psychiatric disorders ( r(75)¼/C0.30,
p¼.008), and when excluding participants who had relatives di-
agnosed with psychiatric illness ( r(71)¼/C0.31,p¼.007). Likewise,
the association between creative achievement and P50 sensory
gating was maintained when participants with psychiatric dis-
orders ( r(75)¼.23, p¼.04) or those who had relatives diagnosed
with psychiatric illness ( r(71)¼.22, p¼.05) were excluded. More-
over, after excluding people with personal and family history of
psychiatric disorders, and controlling for academic achievement
scores within a multiple regression, divergent thinking remained a
signiﬁcant predictor of P50 sensory gating, β¼/C0.24,t(61)¼/C02.04,
p¼.04, while creative achievement also remained a signi ﬁcant
predictor of P50 sensory gating, in the opposite direction, β¼/C0.37,
t(61)¼3.19, p¼.002.
4. Discussion
We examined whether sensory gating –an early, automatic
form of attention, is associated with individual differences in
creativity as measured by divergent thinking tests or by an index
of real-world creative achievements. As predicted, given prior re-
sults on selective attention, increased divergent thinking, as as-
sessed by the standard time-limited divergent thinking test, was
associated with selective sensory gating. This ﬁnding indicates that
divergent thinking is associated with selective sensory processing
very early in the processing stream. Given that the stimuli were
meaningless and there were no task requirements, increased
sensory gating may indicate that selective sensory gating is a
general neural processing characteristic related to divergent
thinking.
The divergent thinking measure we used emphasizes produ-
cing many responses in a short period of time (3 min). Doing so
may bene ﬁt from the ability to selectively focus on relevant in-
formation while inhibiting irrelevant information, then rapidly
switching to a new response. This may rely heavily on executivefunctions in a similar manner to standard academic achievement
tests ( St Clair-Thompson and Gathercole, 2006 ). Indeed, in our
study divergent thinking correlated with academic test scores, as
well as both academic achievement and divergent thinking test
scores reliably predicted selective sensory gating. The association
between divergent thinking and selective sensory gating is in line
with previous studies showing a positive association between in-
dividual differences in divergent thinking and cognitive inhibition
(Benedek et al., 2014 ;Zabelina et al., 2012 ). In other studies, short
initial time limits on a divergent thinking test lead to faster rates of
performance, but also to lower creativity, than did longer time
limits ( Kelly and Karau, 1993 ), indicating that fast responses may
not necessarily be the most creative responses.
In direct contrast to divergent thinking, creative achievement
in our study was associated with leaky sensory gating. This phy-
siological effect concords with our prior behavioral evidence that
creative achievement is associated with leaky attention ( Zabelina
et al., 2015 ), and demonstrates that it happens early in the pro-
cessing stream. Given that there were no task requirements and
stimuli were meaningless, this reduced sensory gating may in-
dicate that a leaky sensory ﬁlter is a general neural processing
characteristic related to real-world creative achievement.
Thus, real-world creative achievers appear to have reduced
ﬁltering of information, which may be the mechanism for their
wider focus on a larger range of stimuli ( Mendelsohn and Gris-
wold, 1964 ;Russell, 1976 ), and their ability to make connections
between distantly related concepts or ideas ( Ansburg and Hill,
2003 ). In conjunction with other protective factors, such as
cognitive control, reduced sensory gating may be what is
needed for real-world creative achievements. In the absence of
strong cognitive control (or other protective factors), leaky sensory
gating may be a risk factor for attention disorders and/or
psychopathology.
Highlighting the fact that divergent thinking and creative
achievement address different aspects of creativity, the relations
for the two creativity measures and the P50 sensory gating were in
opposite directions, strongly differed from each other, and did not
interact. The results suggest that these two creativity measures are
orthogonally associated with sensory processing, and, in fact, in-
volve different neural mechanisms. Finally, the ERP effect was
speci ﬁc to the P50 –a very early attentional component unaffected
by attentional demands ( Gjini et al., 2011 ). Neither divergent
thinking nor creative achievement were related to later compo-
nents, such as the N100 and P200, which are sensitive to manip-
ulations of attention ( Gjini et al., 2011 ). Additionally, the experi-
mental paradigm involved no task demands –if task demands
were introduced, perhaps we would ﬁnd different associations
between creativity measures and later ERP components.
It is not clear whether reduced sensory gating is a stable trait,
or whether creative achievers can modulate their sensory pro-
cessing depending on task demands. In other words, they may be
particularly good at narrowing and widening their sensory ﬁlters
depending on task demands. Indeed, ﬂexible cognitive control
(Zabelina and Robinson, 2010 ), and variable attention ( Vartanian
et al., 2007 ) have been suggested to facilitate creativity. Because
our sensory gating paradigm lacked goals or meaningful stimuli,
participants may not focus on the ﬁrst click nor ﬁlter the second. If
we changed instructions to require participants to attend, or in-
cluded task goals or meaningful stimuli, sensory gating could re-
late differently to divergent thinking, to creative achievement, or
to both.
The link between reduced sensory gating and creative
achievement is particularly intriguing given that the P50 is viewed
as a marker of vulnerability to some psychopathology, particularly
schizophrenia ( Cadenhead et al., 2000 ;Olincy et al., 2010 ), and a
rather debated view that creativity and psychopathology may beD.L. Zabelina et al. / Neuropsychologia 69 (2015) 77 –84 82

related ( Folley and Park, 2005 ;Kinney et al., 2001 ;Kyaga et al.,
2012 ). Indeed, our recent investigations report that real-world
creative achievement is associated with several dimentional psy-
chopathology measures, namely psychoticism and hypomania,
while divergent thinking is not associated with any psycho-
pathology measures ( Zabelina et al., 2014 ). Thus it is possible that
some risk factors that are associated with elevated psycho-
pathology, such as leaky sensory gating, might also, in combina-
tion with other factors, be a “risk ”factor for increased creative
achievement, as previously suggested ( Carson, 2011 ;Richards
et al., 1988 ). Therefore for some prominent creative achievers who
complained about noise as a source of distraction, the same leaky
ﬁlters may have facilitated their creativity.
Additionally, it is important to examine whether people with
creative achievements are particularly those who have increased
cognitive control paired with leaky sensory gating. Investigations
of how creative people modulate their attention will also provide
further insight into how different components of attention are
associated with different aspects of creativity.
5. Conclusion
We report a novel association between creativity and sensory
gating. We provide clear evidence that divergent thinking and
real-world creative achievement have reliably different neural
mechanisms of sensory gating. Speci ﬁcally, divergent thinking is
associated with selective sensory gating, whereas creative
achievement is associated with leaky sensory gating, both in terms
of zero-order correlations, or within a linear regression controlling
for academic achievement scores. The relations between the two
creativity measures and P50 sensory gating strongly differ from
each other, and do not interact in predicting P50 sensory gating.Finally, the association is speci ﬁc to P50, as there are no associa-
tions between creativity measures and N100 or P200. The results
suggest that these two creativity measures involve different neural
mechanisms of sensory processing.

Creativity and sensory gating indexed by the P50: Selective versus leaky sensory processing 
in divergent thinkers and creative achievers.  
 
Darya L. Zabelina*, Daniel O’Leary, Narun Pornpattananangkul, Robin Nusslock,  
and Mark Beeman  
 
The following  analyses were performed using data without PCA correction.  
Divergent thinking and sensory gating  
Divergent thinking was negatively ass ociated with the sensory gating P50 ratio, r(80) = -
.27, p = .02, indicating more selective sensory filter for people with higher divergent thinking 
scores.  
Creative achievement and sensory gating  
Real-world creative achievement was marginally positively associated with the P50 ERP 
ratios,  r(81) = .20, p = .07, indicating  leakier sensory filter  for higher creative achievers.  
Does P50 relate differently to Divergent Thinking and Creative Achievement?  
Although the correlation s between the P50 sensory gating  and each creativity measure 
was only modest, the two creativity measures related to sensory gating in opposite directions, 
and the two correlations strongly differed from each other, Fisher's z = -3.01, p < .01.  
Controlling for academic achievement score s 
To test for independent associations between divergent thinking, creative achievement, 
and P50 sensory gating we performed a multiple linear regression, with divergent thinking, real -

world creative achievement, and academic test scores as predictors of P 50 sensory gating. As can 
be seen from Table 1a, divergent thinking remained a marginally significant predictor of the P50 
sensory gating, such that higher divergent thinking scores predicted more selective  sensory 
gating. Creative achievement, on the othe r hand, was a significant predictor of P50 sensory 
gating in the opposite direction, such that higher creative achievement scores predicted leakier  
sensory gating. Controlling for the creativity variables, academic achievement scores reliably 
predicted P50  sensory gating, such that higher academic achievement predicted more selective 
sensory gating.

Do divergent thinking and creative achievement interact in predicting P5 0 sensory gating ? 
With the P50 sensory gating ratios as the dependent variable, we performed a multiple 
regression examining a potential interactive effect of divergent thinking and creative 
achievement. In a multiple regression, divergent thinking and cre ative achievement were z 
scored, and an interaction term was calculated by multiplying the two predictors (Aiken & West,

1991). All three predictors – both main effects and the interaction variable – were then entered as 
simultaneous predictors of P50 sens ory gating. The interactive predictor (divergent thinking x 
creative achievement) did not predict P50 sensory gating,  ß = -.08, t(80) = -.68, p = .50 . The 
main effect were both reliable, but in opposite directions, such that divergent thinking was a 
signif icant negative predictor of leaky sensory gating , ß = -.31, t(80) = -2.84, p = .006, while 
creative achievement was a significant positive predictor of leaky sensory gating , ß = .25, t(80) =
