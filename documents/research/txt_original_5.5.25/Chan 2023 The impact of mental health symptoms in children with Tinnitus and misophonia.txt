## Abstract

Tinnitus and misophonia are important 'sound annoyance' disorders in pediatric otolaryngology and audiology practices.  There  is  scant  published  literature  to  suggest  increased  anxiety  and  depression  symptoms  in  these disorders. This study aimed at assessing the clinical characteristics of these 2 disorders and their prevalence in mental  health-related  symptoms  in  a  2-year  retrospective  chart  review  of  a  multi-disciplinary  (otolaryngology, audiology, and psychology) clinic cohort. Analyses were based on 54 (tinnitus = 33 and misophonia = 21) children consisting of 19 males and 35 females with a mean age (standard deviation) of 14.3 (3.0) years. The entire cohort was  negatively  affected  by  diagnosis-based  symptom  severity  instruments  as  assessed  by  Tinnitus  Functional Index and Amsterdam Misophonia Scale. Both subgroups exhibited elevated anxiety and depression symptoms in psychometric instruments as assessed by Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders and Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire. Evidence-based management of these disorders is lacking, and clinical trials are needed.

## Objectives

Among the most common disorders that can be coined as 'sound annoyance' disorders frequently encountered by pediatric otolaryngologists and audiologists are hyperacusis, tinnitus, and misophonia. This grouping is problematic because each has its own presentation, etiology, natural history, and proposed treatment modality. Pediatric perspective of each of these disorders is difficult to fully understand due to a paucity of publications in  these  fields.  Further  complicating  the  field  is  that hyperacusis can coexist with phonophobia, tinnitus, and misophonia in their presentations.

Hyperacusis is a chronic condition defined as a lowered tolerance or increased sensitivity to everyday environmental sounds. Research in hyperacusis in children is limited and the most recent synopsis of this field was a scoping  review  by  Potgieter  et  al   published  in  2020. 1 Interestingly,  only  21  publications  could  be  gleaned between 1994 and 2020 suggesting the paucity of clinical understanding  and  research  in  this  topic.  The  authors profiled this disorder to have the commonest presentation age at 3 to 4 years with a male dominance. Autism spectrum disorder and tinnitus are the most common cooccurring conditions. The most troublesome noises for individuals  with  hyperacusis  are  household  electrical appliances according to the authors. The most common

reaction  is  to  cover  their  ears,  cry,  and  present  with aggressive  behavior.  The  most  common  impact  is  on family  functioning,  including  getting  out  of  the  house attending  social  events  and  on  school  performance. Several modes of therapy including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have been tried with theoretical improvement. Notably, because misophonia involves decreased sound tolerance and can coexist with hyperacusis, publications  concerning  misophonia  were  excluded  in  this scoping review.

Tinnitus is defined as the perception of a sound without  an  external  source.  In  a  recent  meta-analysis  of childhood tinnitus and hyperacusis published by Rosing et al, 2 25 studies were included (only the tinnitus portion of the publication is discussed here). Generalizations of the patient characteristics are difficult due to the heterogeneity of the studies. The population characteristics of childhood  tinnitus  have  a  wide  range  of  prevalence based on age, but prevalence increased with age during the teenage years. There appeared to be minimal differences  between  prevalence  in  gender.  Cogent  to  this study is the prevalence of 'bothersome' tinnitus and it ranged from 0.6% to 49.2%. Hearing loss (HL) prevalence was difficult to estimate due to age ranges of the studies analyzed. The only comorbidity identified by the authors was on mental health symptoms in 1 publication by  Holgers  and  Juul 3 in  2006.  Using  the  Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale in a cohort of 55 children, the authors found the percentage above the cutoff for clinical  anxiety  and  depressive  disorders  to  be  32%  and 14.5%, respectively.

Misophonia  is  a  relatively  new  term  coined  by Jastreboff  in 2002. It is a disorder of decreased toler4 ance to specific sound triggers by oral sounds (eg, chewing and swallowing), and clicking sounds (eg, keyboard tapping  and  finger  tapping)  and  results  in  a  range  of responses from anger to fight-or-flight responses. Potgieter et al  in 2019 performed a scoping review of 5 research  on  misophonia  wherein  31  publications  were included.  This  disorder  borders  both  psychiatry  and audiology and currently there are those who have proposed that it be categorized within the obsessive-compulsive spectrum of disorders. The onset of misophonia has been found to emerge in childhood or adolescence with  only  2  publications  reporting  an  adult  onset. Specifically, Wu et al  reported prevalence in a college 6 student cohort with a 20% rate of experiencing sensitivity to some triggers and strong associations with general sensory, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, and depressive symptom impairments. Most studies based the diagnosis on unstructured clinical interviews. Guzick et al 7 reported on 102 subjects (8-17 years old) with misophonia, noting the most common triggers included eating, breathing,  throat  sounds,  and  tapping.  High  rates  of comorbidity with internalizing and neurodevelopmental disorders were also found.

There is  literature  support  concerning  the  interplay between mental health symptoms and 2 of these entities, tinnitus and misophonia. Tinnitus and misophonia symptom  severity  assessment  is  challenging  for  the pediatric population due to a lack of pediatric-specific validated instruments. The most widely used adult-validated tinnitus instruments include the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire, the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, and the Tinnitus  Functional  Index  (TFI);  only  the TFI  is  validated  for  both  initial  assessment  and  clinical  surveillance. As such, Nemholt et al 8 have found the pediatric tinnitus literature to contain arbitrary descriptive terms such as troublesome, bothersome, uncomfortable, worried, and concerned. In the misophonia  field, the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S) instrument appears  to  be  the  dominant  instrument  in  assessing misophonia  symptom  severity  in  adult  and  pediatric publications. In a misophonia study 9 comprised of adolescents and adults that utilized A-MISO-S, severity was rated as severe (mean/range = 15.1/9-22) in the pediatric cohort.

Elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression have been  reported  as  comorbidities  in  both  tinnitus  and misophonia in adults but are not well publicized in pediatric studies. In a clinical practice guideline on tinnitus sponsored by the American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, 48% to 60% of adults reported depression and anxiety. 10 In Nemholt's pediatric tinnitus systematic review, only 1 of 25 articles even considered anxiety and depression as an outcome. Holgers and Juul 3 in  95  children  (9-16  years)  showed  that  32%  of  the cohort scored above the cutoff level for possible/probable clinical emotional/anxiety disorder and 14.5% scored  above  the  cutoff  for  possible/probable  clinical depression based on the Tinnitus Severity Questionnaire, visual analog scales, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression  Scale  instruments.  The  methodology  of Guzick's  et  al   study  on  102  youths  with  misophonia 7 included a clinical interview in addition to completing questionnaires including A-MISO-S. This allowed them to  report  45%  of  the  subjects  experiencing  a  current anxiety  or obsessive-compulsive  disorder  and  47% experiencing a major depressive disorder.

At  Children's  Hospital  Colorado,  Aurora,  CO,  a multi-disciplinary (otolaryngology, audiology, and psychology) clinic was formed to evaluate and manage children with sound annoyance disorders (tinnitus, misophonia, and hyperacusis but hyperacusis ultimately was excluded from the analyses due to its rarity) since September 2020. The basis of the clinic formation lied

in requests for evaluation and management of these populations  to  the  Departments  of  Otolaryngology  and Audiology  coupled  with  our  sense  of  mental  health comorbidities in these children. The objectives of this study are to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as to estimate the prevalence of mental health-related (anxiety and depression) symptoms of this cohort.

## Study Design

Following approval by our hospital's institutional review board, a retrospective chart review was performed using our  institutional  electronic  health  records,  and  demographic and clinical data were obtained from the multidisciplinary clinic during the span of September 2020 to August 2022. It should be noted that clinic subjects were screened  for  'bothersome'  tinnitus.  To  qualify  for  an evaluation  in  the  multi-disciplinary  clinic,  the  patient must have experienced 'bothersome' tinnitus as defined as  always  present  in  quiet  and  noisy  environments,  at least  6  months  in  duration,  unilateral  or  bilateral,  and negative  impact  on  quality  of  life  including  mental health. No restriction was placed on subjects with a possible  diagnosis  for  misophonia.  This  study  only  analyzed subjects with 'bothersome' tinnitus and misophonia; only 1 hyperacusis subject was identified in the patient cohort and was excluded.

All caregivers seen by this clinic were requested to complete either tinnitus or misophonia symptom severity  instruments  based  on  predominant  symptom  and caretakers of ambiguous symptom subjects were requested  to  complete  both  instruments.  Diagnosisbased  symptom  instrument  analyses  were  performed specific to the final diagnoses. Two psychometric instruments  were  used  to  measure  anxiety  and  depression symptoms. All caregivers and patients were requested to complete these instruments and data were analyzed for the entire clinic population. A brief description of each of the 4 instruments is described below.

## Tinnitus Functional Index

Tinnitus Functional Index 11 is a 25-question self-report questionnaire that is used for both clinical and research purposes.  The  TFI  measures  the  severity  of  tinnitus symptoms  across  8  different  domains  including  (1) intrusiveness, (2) sense of control, (3) cognitive interference, (4) sleep disturbance, (5) auditory difficulties, (6) interference  with  relaxation,  (7)  impact  on  quality  of life, and (8) emotional distress. The TFI monitors treatment-related changes in tinnitus severity across the different  domains.  Scoring  ranges  are  classified  as:  mild impact  ( &lt; 25),  significant  impact  (25-50),  and  severe impact ( &gt; 50). This instrument is only validated in adults and its Cronbach's alpha was reported to be 0.97. Since no  pediatric  instruments  exist,  the  authors  were  compelled to use this as a proxy instrument for children.

## Amsterdam Misophonia Scale

The A-MISO-S 9  is a 6-item self-reported questionnaire (ranging  0-4  with  4  being  the  most  adverse  response) that measures the severity of misophonia symptoms. It is an adapted version of the Yale-Brown  ObsessiveCompulsive  Scale  that  quantifies  (1)  time  spent  on thoughts about misophonia, (2) impact on social functioning,  (3)  amount  of  distress  from  misophonia,  (4) resistance of the misophonia triggers, (5) lack of control of misophonia, and (6) avoidance of events due to misophonia. Scoring for each of the 6 categories is summated as: subclinical impact (0-4), mild impact (5-9), moderate impact  (10-14),  severe  impact  (15-19),  and  extreme impact (20-24). This tool has consistently shown high internal consistency. 12 Similar to the TFI, this is also a validated instrument for adults with a reported Cronbach's alpha of 0.81, and it was used as a proxy for pediatric cohort in this study.

## Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders

The Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders  (SCARED),  a  validated  instrument,  is  a 41-item self-report and parent-report measure for children aged 8 to 18. 13 It consists of statements which are meant  to  assess  symptoms  of  anxiety,  for  example, 'When I feel frightened, it is hard to breathe.' The measure  includes  5  subscales  aimed  at  assessing  panic/ somatic symptoms,  generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, social phobia, and school phobia. The respondent is asked to indicate whether they (or their child) have experienced symptoms over the past 3 months on a 3-point Likert scale (0 = 'Not True or Hardly Ever True,' 1 = 'Somewhat True or Sometimes True,' and 2 = 'Very True or Often True'). The measure has solid psychometric properties. In a review of 8 anxiety measures,  the  psychometric  properties  including  norms, test-retest reliability, internal consistency, content validity, treatment sensitivity, among others, were rated as  'adequate,'  'good,'  or  'excellent.' 14 The  psychometric properties of the SCARED ranged from good to excellent on both the self-report and parent-report versions,  with  more  'excellent'  ratings  on  the  parentreport version. A total score of 25 or more may indicate the presence of an anxiety disorder and was used as the

## Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire

The Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ), a validated  instrument  for  children,  is  a  13-item  selfreport  questionnaire  for  children  aged  6  and  up. 15 It measures the presence of depressive symptoms over the previous  2  weeks.  The  scale  consists  of  descriptive phrases regarding how the child had been feeling or acting. Examples include 'I cried a lot' and 'I didn't enjoy anything at  all.' The  respondent  is  asked  to  rate  each statement on a 3-point Likert scale (0 = 'Not True,' 1 = 'Sometimes,'  and  2 = 'True').  The  scale  has  been found to reliably predict depression in children and adolescents. A total score on the child version of the SMFQ of 8 or more is considered significant with a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 85% for major depression. The reported Cronbach's alpha was 0.85 for the child-report version, and 0.87 for the parent-report version.

Study data were collected and managed  using REDCap  (Research  Electronic  Data  Capture)  tools. 16 REDCap  is  a  secure,  web-based  software  platform designed  to  support  data  capture  for  research  studies, providing  (1)  an  intuitive  interface  for  validated  data capture; (2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; (3) automated export procedures for  seamless  data  downloads  to  common  statistical packages;  and  (4)  procedures  for  data  integration  and interoperability with external sources. A total of 60 subjects were seen in the multi-disciplinary clinic. Subjects were excluded for age &gt; 18 years ( n = 2) and non-tinnitus and misophonia diagnoses which consisted of auditory processing disorder ( n = 3) and hyperacusis ( n = 1). The 2 remaining diagnostic groups were tinnitus ( n = 33) and misophonia ( n = 21). It should be noted that if  misophonia  was  diagnosed  as  the  overriding  complaint,  those  with  a  secondary  complaint  of  tinnitus were grouped under misophonia. The reverse (ie, primary complaint of tinnitus and secondary complaint of misophonia) did not occur. Demographics and clinical characteristics were summarized in Table 1 by descriptive statistics. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check for normality of data distribution, and as such, two-sample t -test  was  used  to  compare the means. Fisher's exact test was performed to compare the proportions between 2 groups. General linear regression and logistic models were applied to explore the associations between mental  health  (SCARED  and  SMFQ)  and  symptom severity  (TFI  and  A-MISO-S)  instruments  for  subjects  exceeding  cutoff  thresholds  for  SCARED  and SMFQ.  Parent  and  child  anxiety  and  depression assessments  were  compared  using  paired t -test.  All tests were conducted as 2-sided with P value &lt; .05 to determine  statistical  significance.  SAS  Version  9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina was used for all data analyses.

## Results

A total of 54 subjects were included in the analysis with 33 subjects with the diagnosis of tinnitus and 21 subjects with misophonia. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort are detailed in Table 1. The cohort's mean age (standard deviation [SD]) of 14.3 (3.0) years suggests an adolescent population with a preponderance of  female/male  ratio  of  35/19.  No  differences  were found in age between the tinnitus and misophonia subgroups. No gender difference was noted in the tinnitus subgroup,  but  females  dominated  in  the  misophonia subgroup. Hearing loss was only diagnosed in the tinnitus group, present in 6 individuals with a distribution of unilateral  sensorineural  hearing  loss  (SNHL; n = 1), bilateral conductive hearing loss (CHL; n = 3), bilateral SNHL ( n = 1),  and  bilateral  mixed  HL  ( n = 1).  The distribution  of  HL  subjects  between  the  2  diagnostic groups showed no statistical difference.

Nine of 25 (36.0%) tinnitus subjects and 8 of 11 (72.3%) misophonia subjects reached depression symptom cutoff  ( P = .3137  from  Fisher's  exact  test). The  tinnitus subgroup's  SMFQ  mean  score  (6.5)  was  below  the threshold for elevated depression symptoms; however, the  misophonia  subgroup's  SMFQ  mean  score  (11.9) was above the threshold and had a statistically higher mean than the tinnitus subgroup ( P = .02).

Tinnitus symptom severity as measured by TFI was available in 22 of 33 tinnitus subjects. Tinnitus Functional  Index's  mean  (SD)  score  was  41.0  (21.3) indicating  significant  tinnitus.  Misophonia  symptom severity as measured by A-MISO-S was available in 17 of  21  misophonia  subjects.  Amsterdam  Misophonia Scale's mean (SD) score was 15.8 (3.4) indicating severe misophonia symptoms.

Mental health symptom scores were more complete when the patients were the respondents than when the caretakers were the respondents. Thus, analyses of mental  health  instrument  scores  solely  relied  on  children being  the  respondents.  Mean  SCARED  scores  (SD) between the  tinnitus  27.9  (18.2)  and  misophonia  28.6 (13.6) groups failed to reach statistical significance ( P = .92) for anxiety symptoms. Seven of 15 (46.7%) tinnitus subjects  and  7  of  11  (63.4%)  misophonia  subjects reached  anxiety  symptom  cutoff  ( P = .4527  from Fisher's exact test. Depression symptom score as measured by the SMFQ was available in 39 of 54 subjects.

The  subgroups  that  exceeded  clinical  cutoffs  for SCARED  and  SMFQ  were  further  examined.  Their associated  number  of  subjects  from  the  tinnitus  and misophonia  groups  are  represented  in  Table  2  which illustrates how elevated these mean scores were in these subgroups.  Logistic  regression  model  showed  that  for each  unit  increase  of A-MISO-S  score,  a  subject  was 13%  (-21%,  62%, P = .54)  more  likely  to  have SCARED scored above the threshold, and 22% (-13%, 71%, P = .67)  more  likely  to  have  the  SMFQ scored above the threshold. Tinnitus Functional Index did not show a strong association with SCARED. Using a linear regression model to test the association between TFI and A-MISO-S scores with subjects above the clinical cutoffs in SCARED and SMFQ, only TFI was found to be significantly associated with SMFQ ( P = .04).

Sub-analyses were performed to determine if differences  could  be  found  between  the  parent-  and child-completed mental health instruments. The incompleteness  of  the  SMFQ  parent  scores  became  obvious when only 5 of 33 in the tinnitus group and 2 of 21 in the misophonia group were found to have completed their questionnaires.  However,  23  paired  parent  and  child scores were available (14 in tinnitus and 9 in misophonia  groups)  for  the  SCARED. The  mean (SD) for the child- and parent-completed SCARED scores was 28.2 (16.2)  and  18.3  (13.5),  respectively, P = .0009.  This suggests a significantly higher perceived anxiety symptom elevation  by  the  patients  than  by  their  respective caretakers.

a Have mental health instrument assessments.

Prior mental health counseling broadly defined as all types of counseling ranging from clinical psychologists in private practice to school counselors was noted among 10 in 33 (30.3%) subjects in the tinnitus group versus 10 in 21 (52.4%) subjects in the misophonia group and this distribution was found to be statically insignificant.

An analysis was performed between the responders and  the  non-responders  of  the  mental  health  instruments and it is summarized in Table 3. There were statistical demographic differences between the groups in that  the  non-responders  were  younger  and  predominantly male. There were no differences noted in terms of  TFI  and  A-MISO-S  scores  between  the  groups  to suggest similar symptom scores. In addition, there were no differences between the groups in terms of diagnostic classifications.

## Conclusions

This represents the first report of children with bothersome tinnitus and misophonia who were evaluated in a multi-disciplinary  clinic  setting  at  Children's  Hospital Colorado, with an emphasis to evaluate the severity of symptoms  and  elevation  of  anxiety  and  depression symptom scores. Both cohorts shared similar age of presentation and had elevated symptoms based on each of the  symptom  severity  instruments.  The  tinnitus  group had elevated mean anxiety symptom scores above the clinically significant cutoff but not for depression symptoms. The misophonia group had elevated mean anxiety and depression symptom scores above the clinical cutoffs based on both mental health screening instruments. Both populations had some proportion of prior mental health counseling prior to being seen in the clinic.

The data  suggest  an  overall  disproportional  female adolescent  representation  in  both  diagnostic  subpopulations and  a statistical female  dominance  in  the misophonia  group.  Whereas  pediatric  epidemiologic data  on  misophonia  are  lacking,  it  has  been  noted  by Baguley et al 17 that epidemiologic data within the tinnitus  research  field  are  conflicting  and  it  had  been  suggested that caution should be exercised in its interpretation.  Nemholt  et  al  have  stated  that  these 'inconsistencies'  are  seemingly  due  to  differences  in study designs, definitions, and inclusion criteria in published studies. Juxtaposed to this study is a 2017 pediatric  tinnitus  publication  from  our  institution 18 utilizing general  pediatric  otolaryngology  clinic  subjects  rather than screening subjects with bothersome tinnitus. Beyond the obvious mean age of 11.5 years as compared to the 14.2 years in the current study, 40 of 180 (22.2%) subjects had HL consisting of a mixture of SNHL, CHL, and mixed HL that was unilateral and bilateral in nature. The current study showed 18.2% of the tinnitus cohort had HL and none in the misophonia cohort had HL. To our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  pediatric  misophonia cohort  that  underwent  audiologic  evaluation.  Despite the limited sample size, the authors would conclude that HL is likely not highly associated with misophonia.

Elevation of SCARED anxiety scores was noted in both tinnitus and misophonia groups in our study. Only the misophonia group had a higher SMFQ mean score, statistically different as compared to the tinnitus group. These findings are in contrast to findings in a 2017 tinnitus study, where only 2 subjects (7.1%) showed severe changes in quality of life and 1 subject (3.6%) with anxiety.  A  convenience  clinic  sampling  clearly  underestimated  its  effects  on  mental  health  symptoms.  The dichotomy  seen  in  the  elevated  symptom  score  noted between  the  child-reported  SCARED  as  compared  to parent-reported  SCARED,  highlighting  the  perceptual differences in anxiety between parent and child in this study, is worth noting and this finding is corroborated with published findings of Wren et al. 19

It is not the intent of this study to address treatment for tinnitus and misophonia, and yet 30% of our tinnitus group and 52% of our misophonia group had already received some form of counseling at entry. Treatment of pediatric tinnitus has included CBT,  medications (risperidone and  topiramate),  tinnitus  retraining  therapy,  and  sound therapy.  Published treatment of pediatric misophonia has 1 only included CBT. 20 Recently, Smith et al 21 published an online survey on various treatment approaches reported by patients  (adults  and  children)  which  allows  readers  to understand the patients' and parents' mindsets in seeking treatment options as well as the diverse treatment alternatives  provided  by  practitioners/clinicians.  The  pediatric treatment modalities included medications (unnamed anxiolytics  and  antidepressants  being  the  majority),  dietary supplements, lifestyle modifications, relaxation, psychological  treatment  (CBT  and  supportive  psychotherapy being most common), audiologic treatment (active noise canceling), and neuromodulation. The epidemiologic research  of  tinnitus  and  misophonia  is  already  complex based on what has been published. To move the management of  these  clinical  entities  along  the  evidence-based path, randomized clinical trials with a rigorous methodology must be conducted.

The strength of this study lies in the multi-disciplinary approach to the evaluation of tinnitus and misophonia. Each specialty contributed to the overall execution of the multi-disciplinary clinic and the collaboration led to the production of the data set. The first weakness lies in the referral patterns of these 2 clinical disorders which might have created selection bias. The screening of subjects with bothersome tinnitus might be viewed as arbitrary.  The  other  weakness  of  the  study  lies  in  the incomplete return of the 4 instruments by the caretakers and  the  mental  health  instruments  by  the  patients. However, no symptom severity score differences were noted between the responders and non-responders. This was unavoidable because the study was carried out in a clinical setting and not part of a research protocol.

The relationships between 2 sound annoyance disorders, tinnitus and misophonia, and mental health symptoms as measured by SCARED and SMFQ have been found in this study. Analyses to explore the relationship between the symptom severity and mental health symptoms failed to yield meaningful associations likely due to small subgroup sizes. To advance this field, a treatment randomized clinical trial is needed. Pragmatically, if a future treatment trial is designed to measure treatment effects on anxiety and depression symptoms, the need for TFI and A-MISO-S measurements is limited. Therefore, it would be more cogent to only include subjects that have exceeded the clinical cutoffs for SCARED and/or SMFQ in such a study.
