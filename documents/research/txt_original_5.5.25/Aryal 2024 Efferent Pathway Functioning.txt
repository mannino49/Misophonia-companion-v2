## Highlights:

-  Misophonia is a little-understood disorder from an audiological perspective
-  The study shed light on the underlying auditory mechanisms involved in misophonia
-  The outcomes provide crucial insights for the investigation of misophonia

## ABSTRACT

Background and Aim: Misophonia, characterized by a decreased tolerance for specific auditory stimuli, has been  insufficiently  explored  within  audiology.  Limited  research  has  been  conducted,  and  the  auditory mechanisms involved in this disorder remain to be explored. Hence, our study aimed to investigate the auditory efferent systems in individuals with misophonia. By focusing on this specific aspect, we aim to contribute to a better  understanding  of  misophonia  and  shed  light  on  the  underlying  auditory  mechanisms  involved  in  the condition.

Methods: A  cross-sectional  research  was  performed  with  students  from  Mysore  University  to  investigate misophonia. The severity of misophonia was evaluated using the  revised Amsterdam misophonia scale. The participants were divided into two groups based on their misophonia severity: mild (n=15) and moderate-severe (n=15).  All  participants  underwent  transient  evoked  otoacoustic  emissions  with  contralateral  suppression  to assess  the  auditory  function.  The  overall  amplitude  and  frequency-specific  amplitudes  were  analyzed  and compared across the various groups.

Results: The  analysis  of  variance  results  revealed  no  significant  differences  between  the  groups  in  global amplitude suppression and suppression of all frequencies. These findings imply that the medial-olivocochlear bundle efferent pathway is intact among individuals with misophonia.

Conclusion: Our findings have concluded that the medial olivocochlear bundle appears intact among individuals with misophonia (p&gt;0.05). However, it is essential to note that the generalizability of these findings may be limited due to the relatively small sample size used in our study. Therefore, further research involving a more extensive and diverse population is needed to validate and generalize these conclusions.

## Introduction

Misophonia is a disorder characterized by a decreased tolerance for particular auditory stimuli [1]. These stimuli, referred  to  as  triggers,  elicit  diverse  emotional  and  physiological  responses  in  affected  individuals,  such  as anxiety, rage, irritability, and disgust. Misophonia is a little-known disorder with a high prevalence rate. Literature has  shown  that  the  prevalence  rate  of  misophonia  ranges  from  3.5%  [2]  to  23.28%  [3]  to  49.1%  [4].  The significant disparity in prevalence rates could be attributed to the diverse methodology and samples used in the research.

Misophonia can occur as an isolated disorder or associated with other auditory and psychiatric disorders [5]. The comorbidity  with  auditory  disorders  includes  hyperacusis  and  phonophobia.  Hyperacusis  is  the  physical experience of discomfort or pain in response to sounds. The sounds are perceived as too loud, even though they would typically be considered tolerable by most individuals [6]. Phonophobia, conversely, is characterized by fear of specific sounds known as triggers [7].

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the scientific literature to comprehend the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology  underlying  misophonia.  Researchers  are  actively  exploring  the  neural  mechanisms  and processes associated with this disorder [8-11]. There has been debate in the literature to categorize misophonia as  an  auditory,  psychiatric,  or  neurological  disorder  [12].  In  individuals  suffering  from  misophonia,  the neuroanatomical pattern analyzed using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) revealed activation of auditory-insula-limbic regions [11]. Several researchers have also reported similar findings in the literature [13, 14].

Currently, the assessment and management of misophonia are not known clearly. In addition, there is no medical treatment for it, even though different drugs have been trialed across the literature [15]. From the audiological perspective, very little research has been done [16]. Neurophysiological findings have shown hyperactivation of the ascending central auditory pathway structures, with no changes in the efferent pathway [16]. However, there is a lack of studies done from an audiological perspective to understand the functioning of the efferent pathway. Hence, we aim to evaluate the functioning of the efferent pathway in individuals suffering from misophonia disorder through the electroacoustic test.

The efferent pathway is part of the central auditory pathway, starting from the auditory cortex and ending in the inner ear [17]. The part of the efferent auditory pathway, the Olivocochlear Bundle (OCB), located within the brainstem  has  two  parts:  the  medial  olivocochlear  bundle  and  the  lateral  olivocochlear  bundle.  The  medial olivocochlear bundle has thick and myelinated nerve fibers that terminate at the base of the Outer Hair Cells (OHCs), predominantly on the contralateral side [17]. The Medial Olivocochlear bundle (MOC) fibers establish synaptic connections with the outer hair cells, and their activation leads to the inhibition of the basilar membrane response to low-frequency sound [18]. Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) reflect the modulation in the gain of the cochlear amplifier, which is facilitated by the efferent pathway.

Eliciting MOC activity with the elicitor sound ipsilateral or contralateral to the OAE test ear is one way to monitor the MOC effect. Contralateral suppression, on the other hand, has been frequently adopted due to additional issues created by ipsilateral  suppression,  such  as  cochlear  masking  [17].  Contralateral  suppression  of  the  Transient Evoked Otoacousic Emissions (TEOAEs) refers to the reduction in amplitude observed when simultaneous noise is presented to the ear opposite to the one being tested. This phenomenon manifests as a decrease in the amplitude of TEOAEs during the presence of contralateral noise.

Our study evaluates the MOC activity by administering contralateral suppression of the TEOAEs. TEOAEs have been chosen as a reliable test as their sensitivity is high for the presence of hearing loss [17, 19]. Misophonia can manifest as an independent disorder or coexist with other auditory conditions, including tinnitus, hyperacusis, and phonophobia. Several studies have demonstrated abnormal activation patterns within the efferent auditory pathway in individuals with tinnitus and hyperacusis [6, 20]. However, few studies have shown no problem with the efferent pathway in these populations [21]. Hence, to understand the association of misophonia with tinnitus and hyperacusis, we aim to evaluate efferent pathway functioning in individuals with misophonia disorder using contralateral suppression of TEOAE.

## Methods

Before their participation, all individuals received comprehensive information regarding the study procedures. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant, ensuring their voluntary agreement to participate in  the  study.  The  Revised  Amsterdam  Misophonia  Scale  (Revised  A-MISO-S)  was  utilized  to  survey  the prevalence  of  misophonia  among  students  from  Mysore  University  [22],  which  was  initially  developed  by Schroder et al. [23].

An  experimental  study  was  conducted  to  investigate  individuals  who  experienced  clinically  significant misophonia with a healthy control group for comparison. Based on the survey results, 40 individuals exhibiting misophonia symptoms were invited to participate in the study. The average age of the participants was 25 years (±7.8 years). Among the individuals in the misophonia group, 36 (90%) out of the 40 were female, while 4 (10%) were male. All participants were literate and came from diverse educational backgrounds, including audiology, business,  medicine,  and  speech-language  pathology.  All  subjects  had  been  experiencing  misophonia  for  a minimum of three years and had no hearing loss. For the control group, fifteen individuals with no misophonia or other ear/health-related symptoms were recruited (x̄=24±6years). To enable effective comparison, the gender distribution in the control group was carefully matched with that of the misophonia group. This matching process ensured a balanced representation of genders in both groups, minimizing potential gender-related confounding factors during the analysis and interpretation of the results. Overall, the study included a total of 55 participants.

## Misophonia severity evaluation

The participants were invited to the study after confirming that the patient had misophonia symptoms through the analysis  of  the  responses  to  the  Amersdam  misophonia  questionnaires  and  the  misophonia  assessment questionnaires received via the survey. As the second step of the study, the revised version of the Amsterdam Misophonia  Scale  was  readministered  to  the  participants.  This  step  involved  assessing  and  quantifying  the severity of misophonia symptoms using the updated scale [22]. Revised A-MISO-S was chosen as this is the most widely used questionnaire developed to assess misophonia.

The questionnaire used in the study consisted of ten questions, with scores ranging from 0 to 40. The scale aimed to assess various aspects related to misophonia, including the amount of time an individual spends preoccupied with  misophonic  sounds,  the  interference  of  misophonic  sounds  with  social  functioning,  the  level  of  anger triggered by sounds, resistance to impulsive reactions, control over thoughts and anger, and the amount of time spent avoiding misophonic situations. For scoring purposes, the categorization of misophonia symptoms was as follows: a score ranging from 0 to 10 indicated subclinical misophonia symptoms, a score between 11 and 20 indicated mild misophonia, a score between 21 and 30 indicated moderate to severe misophonia, and a score between 31 and 40 indicated severe to extreme misophonia. This scoring system was used to classify the severity of misophonia symptoms based on the participant's responses to the revised version of the Amsterdam misophonia scale.

Out of the initial 40 participants invited to the study, ten individuals who exhibited subclinical symptoms with a score  lower  than  ten  on  the  Revised  Amsterdam  misophonia  scale  were  excluded  from  further  analysis. Consequently, a total of 30 participants were selected for the misophonia group (mild misophonia group=15, moderate-severe group=15) with comparison to control group (n=15).

## Tinnitus and hyperacusis evaluation

Misophonia can occur as a co-morbid disorder with other auditory disorders, such as tinnitus and hyperacusis. The  questions  were  asked  regarding  the  presence  of  tinnitus  subjectively  for  all  the  participants.  A  tinnitus handicap inventory (Kannada version) was administered among all the participants to rule out the severity of tinnitus [24]. A score of less than 10 on tinnitus handicap inventory is considered no tinnitus handicap. Similarly, a Loudness Discomfort Level (LDL) test was done starting from 70 dB HL and increasing on the ascending run until  the  subject  felt  uncomfortable  with  the  sound  to  evaluate  the  presence  of  hyperacusis  among  all  the participants included in the study [25]. A loudness discomfort level greater than 90 dB HL is a normal loudness tolerance ability.

## Audiological evaluation

In the audiological evaluation sequence, several tests were conducted by an experienced audiologist with at least six years of work experience. The evaluation began with obtaining a detailed case history of the participants, focusing  on  the  ear  and  health-related  information.  Afterward,  an  otoscopic  examination  was  conducted  to evaluate  the  state  of  the  outer  and  middle  ear.  To  ensure  accurate  results  in  the  subsequent  tests,  pure  tone audiometry, tympanometry, and reflexometry were performed on all participants before administering TEOAEs. Pure tone audiometry was conducted using the Grason-Stadler (GSI) Audio Star Pro in a sound-treated room, adhering to the guidelines set by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) [26]. Before conducting the tests, the  audiometer  was  calibrated  subjectively  to  ensure  accurate  measurements.  Supraural  TDH-50 headphones were employed to assess the Air Conduction (AC) thresholds spanning from 0.25 kHz to 8 kHz, while the B-71 bone vibrator was utilized to measure the bone conduction thresholds ranging from 0.25 kHz to 4 kHz. The hearing thresholds were determined by averaging the results obtained at four frequencies: 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz. Normal hearing was defined as an average AC value of 15 dB HL or lower with no airbone gap [27].

## Transient evoked otoacousic emissions and contralateral suppression paradigm

TEOAEs with contralateral suppression were done in the sound-treated room using the otodynamics Echo port ILOV6 equipment following the ANSI guidelines (Frank., 1997). The continuous contralateral noise paradigm was employed to measure TEOAEs and evaluate the contralateral suppression effect of TEOAEs. This method involves presenting a click stimulus to the ear being tested using probe one while simultaneously introducing broadband  noise  as  the  suppressor  to  the  contralateral  ear  through  probe  2.  Continuous  contralateral  noise suppression is a widely utilized technique for studying the impact of contralateral noise on TEOAE responses, allowing researchers to assess the level of suppression in the efferent auditory pathway.

TEOAEs were measured  using  the  two  conditions.  In  the  first  condition,  TEOAEs  were  recorded  with  the MASKER OFF condition, in which the suppressor was not presented to the contralateral ear.  In  the second condition, TEOAEs were recorded with MASKER ON condition in which a suppressor was delivered to the contralateral ear. The recording was done three times in all conditions to obtain reliable TEOAEs with better stimulus stability and response reproducibility [28]. Minimum stimulus stability of 70% and reproducibility of 80% were set as the criteria for accepting the TEOAEs response [29]. The intensity of the click stimulus used was 80 dB SPL in the nonlinear mode. During the test, participants were asked to relax and sit comfortably on the reclining chair.

Similarly,  the  broadband  white  noise  was  used  as  the  suppressing  stimulus  in  the  contralateral  ear,  and  the suppressor level was 50 dB SPL. The suppressor level was not set too high to prevent the activation of the middle ear reflex and prevent cross-hearing to the contralateral ear [29]. Few participants reported annoyance with the suppressor  and click stimulus during the recording. They were  given a  gap between the tests to make them comfortable during the testing.

All the participants were asked to sit on a comfortable chair inside the sound booth for the TEOAE measurements. Participants were given careful instructions about the test procedure and asked to remain silent during the process. Before recording each participant, calibration was done using the ILO probe-fit paradigm. The recording was done by inserting probe 1 in the right ear canal to deliver stimulus and probe 2 in the left ear canal to provide broadband white noise suppressor stimulus and vice versa. The proper ear tip was chosen depending on the ear canal  size  of  each  participant.  The  recording  was  done  in  all  the  participants  with  and  without  suppressing stimulus.

The global amplitude was calculated for each participant. Frequency-specific amplitude value was obtained for the 1000 Hz, 1414 Hz, 2000 Hz, 2828 Hz, and 4000 Hz frequencies. The total suppression value of the global amplitude and the amplitude of each frequency were calculated by subtracting TEOAE responses with the masker on condition from the masker off condition. All parameters' suppression values were analyzed among the control, mild, and moderate-severe groups.

## Statistical analyses

The data collected for the study were analyzed using the IBM SPSS program, version 25.0. Firstly, the ShapiroWilk test assessed whether the data followed a normal distribution. Since the data exhibited a normal distribution, a parametric one-way analysis of variance test was utilized to investigate significant differences between the misophonia and control groups. The dependent variables in the study consisted of the global amplitude and the amplitude at each frequency, while the severity of misophonia was treated as the independent variable. The criterion  for  determining  statistical  significance  was  set  at  a  p-value  less  than  0.05,  with  a  95%  confidence interval. The study aimed to identify significant group differences by employing these statistical procedures.

## Results

## Misophonia severity

According to the study findings, ten individuals were categorized as having moderate to severe misophonia, as evidenced by scores ranging from 21 to 30 on the RAMISO-S. Furthermore, 5 participants were identified as having  severe  to  extreme  misophonia,  scoring  between  31  and  40  on  the  scale.  Conversely,  15  participants exhibited mild misophonia, scoring between 11 and 20. In the control group, all 15 participants scored zero on the updated RAMISO-S scale, indicating the absence of misophonia symptoms. All the participants included in the misophonia and control group did not have comorbidity with other auditory and psychiatric disorders. All the participants had loudness discomfort levels (&gt;90 dB HL), indicating the absence of hyperacusis. Likewise, all the participants included in both the control and experimental groups had a tinnitus handicap score of less than 10 (mean score=4.5), indicating no tinnitus handicap.

Due to insufficient sample size to create three distinct groups, the misophonia participants were categorized into two groups. The first group, comprising 15 participants, included individuals with mild misophonia. The mean score for this group was 15.93, with a standard deviation of 2.89. The second group consisted of individuals with moderate to severe misophonia, also comprising 15 participants. The mean score for this group was 25.86, with a standard deviation of 4.98.

Furthermore, it was observed that all participants had experienced misophonia for a minimum duration of 3 years. The range of experience varied from 3 to 8 years, with a mean duration of 4.93 years and a standard deviation of 1.52 years. Most participants (86.67%) reported a gradual onset of their misophonia symptoms. Various sounds were identified as triggers by a significant number of participants, with scratching being the most commonly reported trigger (66.67%), followed by loud sounds (50%) and chewing (46.67%). Table 1 provides further details on the misophonia characteristics of all participants included in the study

## Audiological evaluation

Upon examination, it was found that all subjects' external and middle ear appearances were normal, and they reported normal hearing. All the participants included in the study had the presence of an 'A' type tympanogram and the presence of acoustic reflexes within the normal range. The statistical analysis indicated that there were no  significant  differences  in  AC  thresholds  between  the  study  group  and  the  control  group  for  the  right  ear (F(2.42)=0.587, p=0.561) and the left ear (F(2.42)=2.540, p=0.091). These findings suggest no significant differences in the AC thresholds between the groups being compared.

In terms of bone conduction testing also, statistical analysis did not reveal any significant differences between the study and control groups for bone conduction thresholds in both the right ear (F(2.42)=0.678, p=0.66) and the left ear (F(2.42)=1.540, p=0.08). These results suggest no significant differences in bone conduction thresholds between  the  groups  being  compared.  For  more  detailed  information  about  the  audiological  findings  of  each participant, refer to Table 2.

## Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions with contralateral suppression findings

The result of the TEOAE's with contralateral suppression was analyzed to determine the functioning of the MOC bundle efferent pathway in individuals with misophonia. The mean value of stimulus stability was 98%, and reproducibility  was  96%.  The suppression value was analyzed in terms of global amplitude suppression and amplitude suppression of each frequency for the right and left ear in each groups.

## Global amplitude suppression

Upon analyzing the results, it was observed that both the control and experimental groups exhibited contralateral signal suppression. When exposed to noise, there was a decrease in the overall amplitude of the response for both groups. For the control group, the mean value of global amplitude suppression was 0.87 dB (SD=0.29) for the right and 1.25 dB (SD=0.49) for the left ear. The mild group was 1.36 dB (SD=0.41) for the right and 0.88dB (SD=0.30) for the left  ear.  The  moderate to  severe  group  had  1.25  dB  (SD=1.23)  for  the  right  and  1.43  dB (SD=1.32) for the left ear.

The  one-way  ANOVA  results  revealed  no  significant  differences  in  global  amplitude  suppression  between groups. For the right ear, the ANOVA result was F(2,42)=1.12, with a p-value of 0.39. Similarly, for the left ear, the ANOVA result was F(2,42)=1.69, with a p-value of 0.28. These findings are summarized in Table 3.

## Amplitude suppression of each frequency

Amplitude suppression of each frequency, including 1000 Hz, 1414 Hz, 2000 Hz, 2828 Hz, and 4000 Hz, was analyzed separately for both ears. The result analysis showed the presence of contralateral suppression for all the frequencies analyzed for all the groups.

Table  3  illustrates  the  standard  deviation  and  mean  of  each  frequency  amplitude  suppression.  The  one-way ANOVA revealed no significant differences in amplitude suppression across groups at all frequencies, including 1000 Hz, 1414 Hz, 2000 Hz, 2828 Hz, and 4000 Hz, with a p-value larger than 0.05. Table 3 provides the detailed mean and standard deviation values of the amplitude suppression for each frequency and the ANOVA findings for the left and right ear.

## Discussion

Misophonia, a disorder that has received limited attention in audiology, was the focus of our study. We employed TEOAEs with contralateral suppression to investigate the functioning of the efferent pathway in individuals with misophonia. An absence of the suppression effect or an increase in TEOAE response amplitude, when suppressors were present, indicates abnormal efferent pathway  functioning. Our findings demonstrated that persons with misophonia, like the control group, have a suppressing effect. There was no significant difference in suppression value  between  all  test  frequencies  between  groups.  This  finding  implies  that  misophonia  patients'  medial olivocochlear bundle efferent path functions normally. Our study replicates findings reported by Suraj et al. [30] reported normal efferent pathway functioning among individuals with misophonia. However, they assessed the linear and non-linear processes of the cochlea using both TEOAEs and DPOAEs.

Misophonia  can  manifest  independently  or  in  conjunction  with  other  auditory  disorders,  including  tinnitus, hyperacusis, and phonophobia. Several studies have evaluated the functioning of the medial olivocochlear bundle efferent pathway in tinnitus. Most of the studies done across the literature have reported abnormal functioning of the efferent pathway in individuals with tinnitus [31-33]. Similarly, studies on hyperacusis have also reported abnormal functioning of the auditory efferent pathway in individuals with misophonia [32]. The differences in the findings of misophonia compared to tinnitus and hyperacusis suggest that the pathophysiological mechanism behind these auditory disorders is different, and we need to diagnose these disorders differently.

Several studies in the existing literature  have  extensively  employed  fMRI to  examine the functioning of the auditory nervous and limbic systems concerning misophonia. These investigations have consistently revealed abnormal activation patterns in ascending auditory cortical regions. Specifically, fMRI studies have demonstrated atypical activity in the central auditory nervous system and limbic system, suggesting their involvement in the processing and perception of misophonic triggers. However, as per our  knowledge none of the fMRI studies has shown  abnormal  processing  of  the  efferent  pathway.These  findings  provide  valuable  insights  into  the neurobiological basis of misophonia and shed light on the underlying mechanisms associated with the condition [34-36]. According to our findings, individuals with misophonia exhibit normal processing of descending medial olivocochlear bundle pathways. The efferent auditory pathways are responsible for modulating and regulating the transmission of information from the brain to the auditory periphery. In misophonia, our research suggests that medial olivocochlear bundle pathways function within the expected range and do not show any significant abnormalities or disruptions. The findings of our study using electroacoustic measures align with the findings using neurophysiological measures.

There werte some limitations of the study, the sample size in our study was limited, which may have introduced bias and affected the generalizability of the findings. Therefore, future studies should aim to include larger sample sizes in each group to ensure more reliable and representative results.

## Conclusion

Misophonia has received limited attention in audiological research. In our study, we sought to assess the function of the efferent pathways by administering Transient Evoked Otoacousic Emissions (TEOAEs) with contralateral suppression to individuals with misophonia. Our findings suggest that the medial olivocochlear bundle efferent pathway,  which  regulates  auditory  responses,  functions  normally  in  misophonia  patients.  However,  further research is necessary to validate these results with a larger sample size and diverse population.

The outcomes of our study serve as a foundational step for audiologists and researchers working in the field of misophonia, providing a starting point to investigate the neurophysiology of the disorder from an audiological perspective. Furthermore, the rostral part of the auditory efferent pathway could not be evaluated using TEOAEs. Additional  research  to  evaluate  rostral  parts  of  efferent  systems  using  electrophysiological  measures  will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of misophonia and its underlying mechanisms.
