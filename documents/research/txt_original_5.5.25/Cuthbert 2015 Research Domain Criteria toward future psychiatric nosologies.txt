## Research Domain Criteria: toward future psychiatric nosologies

Bruce N. Cuthbert, PhD

The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project was initiated by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in early 2009 as the implementation of Goal 1.4 of its just-issued strategic plan. In keeping with the NIMH mission, to 'transform the understanding and treatment of mental  illnesses  through  basic  and  clinical  research,' RDoC was explicitly conceived as a research-related initiative. The statement of the relevant goal in the strategic plan reads: 'Develop, for research purposes, new ways  of  classifying  mental  disorders  based  on  dimensions of observable behavior and neurobiological measures.' Due to the novel approach that RDoC takes to conceptualizing  and  studying  mental  disorders,  it  has received  widespread  attention,  well  beyond  the  borders of the immediate research community. This review discusses the rationale for the experimental framework that RDoC has adopted, and its implications for the nosology of mental disorders in the future.

## Introduction

T he genomics revolution of the past decade has necessitated a renewed interest in diagnosis across all areas of medicine. For example, cancer is increasingly diagnosed  in  terms  of  the  tumor's  genetic  signature, 1 and both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are recognized as many different diseases at the molecular level. 2,3  Deeper  understanding  of  disease  mechanisms  has  led  to companion diagnostics that are tightly linked to specific new treatments, as exemplified by the new cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco, which is highly effective in managing symptoms for the 4% of patients with a particular polymorphism. 4

These  findings-collectively  referred  to  as  'precision medicine'-have transformed ideas about diagnosis and treatment throughout all areas of the biomedical research community. The US Institute of Medicine released a report in 2011 discussing the opportunities and challenges of precision medicine, calling for an 'information commons' that could facilitate identification of particular groups of patients and the potential for treatment on the basis of data mining. 5  Statistical designs for clinical trials have changed markedly, with such innovations as adaptive designs to reveal optimal matching of various therapeutics to disease subtypes. 6  In addition,

regulatory agencies have scrambled to update the regulatory pathway in a fast-changing environment in which the  clinical  target  is  often  much  more  specific  than  a traditional disease, conventional clinical trials can seem out of date by the time they are completed, and treatment guidelines change quickly as outcomes from large clinical databases are updated. 7

As in most other areas of medicine, psychiatric diagnoses have historically been based upon presenting symptoms.  However,  while  work  in  disorders  such  as cancer and diabetes has moved ahead rapidly to field a  variety  of  genomic  and  other  biological  tests,  psychiatric nosology remains based almost exclusively on presenting  signs  and  symptoms. There  are,  of  course, good reasons for this lag. The brain is the most difficult organ in the body to reach, and also the most complicated.  Further,  mental  disorders  (in  contrast  to  most neurological disorders) affect the most complex human functions-such  as  motivation,  cognition,  and  social processes-that are extremely difficult to conceptualize and measure. Nevertheless, the science of brain and behavior has advanced to the point where it is possible (and indeed, necessary) to forge new approaches that can translate advances in brain and behavioral science to assessment and treatment.

the various dimensions that represent the primary objects  of  study. These dimensions, termed constructs to represent their status as empirically derived functional concepts whose precise meaning is subject to change on the basis of ongoing research, are grouped into five superordinate domains (thus, the Research Domain Criteria): Negative Valence (ie, those systems that coordinate response to aversive situations), Positive Valence, Cognitive Processes, Systems for Social Processes, and Arousal/Regulatory  Systems  (ie,  those  processes  that activate and regulate brain activity and behavior). Finally, the fourth axis consists of measures that might be used to  assess  the  constructs,  as  grouped  into  several Units of Analysis ranging from genes to circuits to behavioral measures.

RDoC represents  an  attempt  by  NIMH  to  create an experimental classification system that can provide a first step toward precision medicine for mental disorders. In keeping with an issue devoted to nosology, this article is intended to outline the rationale for the RDoC program and its stance as an experimental classification approach that cuts across current disorder boundaries. First,  however,  a  brief  summary  will  be  provided  for readers unfamiliar with the project; more thorough descriptions of the RDoC framework are available elsewhere. 8-11

## RDoC: just the facts

An internal workgroup of NIMH staff began deliberations for the new project in early 2009, deciding upon its  overall  configuration  as  well  as  the  process  to  be followed. Four major axes comprise the overall RDoC framework. Neurodevelopment and environmental effects  provide  an  important  context  for  research  conducted under the RDoC aegis, and studying these factors in a manner not constrained to any particular DSM diagnosis  is  of  high  priority. The  third  axis  comprises

A series of workshops (one for each domain, plus an initial 'test run' meeting on working memory) was held  between  2010  and  2012,  with  approximately  40 experts  with  relevant  basic  and  clinical  expertise  at each  workshop.  The  participants  were  tasked  with determining a list  of  circuit-based  constructs  for  the domain, creating a definition for each construct, and nominating measures at the various Units of Analysis that had been used in prior studies to measure the construct. (In many instances, there was a paucity of measures for one or more Units of Analysis, and measurement  development  is  accordingly  a  high  priority for the RDoC research program.) Proceedings of each workshop were posted to the RDoC page on the NIMH Web site. 12

In  keeping  with  RDoC's  status  as  a  classification system  intended  for  use  in  research,  a  series  of  announcements with funding set-asides  (a 'Request  for Applications,'  or  RFA)  was  issued  beginning  in  2011 in  order  to  generate  a  corpus  of  funded  research  using the RDoC criteria and to gain experience with the system in grant application reviews. As of the current writing, over 130 grants with relevance to RDoC have been funded (as determined by a search of the public NIH RePORTER Web site 13 ); the portfolio totals over $60 million, representing nearly 15% of the Institute's translational research portfolio. Given that only about 20% of the applications have been funded through setasides, it is apparent that RDoC grant applications have been  competitive  in  general  peer  review  committees, and the growth of the project is on track with NIMH's goal  to  increase  gradually  the  proportion  of  RDoC grants in the translational portfolio.

## The rationale for RDoC

The NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project marks the second time in 40 years that an experimental nosology has been developed for mental disorders. The Research Diagnostic Criteria  (RDC)  were  created  in the 1970s in response to the problems in diagnosis that psychiatry experienced as it emerged from the long era of psychodynamic domination. 14  The particular concern that prompted the RDC was diagnostic reliability: due largely to varying theoretical orientations among psychiatrists, agreement between diagnosticians was lamentably low, severely hampering both clinical treatment and research. The RDC represented the first wide-scale adoption of the polythetic criteria sets that had been piloted with the earlier Feighner criteria, 15 and provided the primary foundation for the revolutionary third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  (DSM-III) in  1980. 16 By  providing  theoryfree  criteria  written  in  straightforward  language  and explicit rules for assigning diagnoses, DSM-III achieved its intended goal of providing generally satisfactory diagnostic agreement. The result ushered in the modern era of psychiatric research, leading to extensive literatures in psychopathology, epidemiology, and clinical trials, and also fostering extensions of psychiatric diagnoses into the legal system, insurance reimbursement, and disability evaluations.

RDoC marks the second iteration of an experimental classification system. This time around, the spotlight has fallen on the validity of the diagnostic system. The decades of research since DSM-III was published have increasingly shown that the diagnostic categories do not represent coherent disease entities, but rather are broad syndromes. 17-19 While  diagnoses  can  be  reliably  established in most cases, they suffer from such problems as excessive  heterogeneity,  comorbidity,  and  overspecification. 20 These  conceptual  and  operational  difficulties hamper attempts to understand the pathophysiology of mental disorders and to develop novel new treatments, and are likely to be a significant part of the reason that pharmaceutical companies have turned away from psychiatric drug development. 21

For contemporary clinical use, these problems might not make so much difference. Most treatments appear to be effective across broad ranges of clinical populations, eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, cognitive-behavioral therapy, benzodiazepines, and ex- tinction protocols for anxiety disorders. Diagnostic uncertainties are sometimes resolved simply by trying out therapies: a psychotic patient with mixed features who responds to lithium must have bipolar disorder, and if not, the diagnosis becomes schizophrenia. Even within the clinical realm, however, problems persist. While effective treatments for mental disorders exist, they result in  significant  symptom  remission  only  about  half  the time,  and the choice of optimal treatments cannot be predicted on an empirical basis for individual patients; this results in frustrating (and sometimes fatal) delays in reaching effective relief.

The difficulties are more problematic, and increasingly  pervasive,  for  research  on  the  nature  of  mental disorders-notwithstanding  the  fact  that  historically, the authors of the DSM have signaled their intent that the DSM should  be  the  definitive  resource  for  both clinical  and  research  needs.  The  preface  to DSM-IV states, eg, 'The purpose of DSM-IV is to provide clear descriptions of diagnostic categories in order to enable clinicians  and  investigators  to  diagnose,  communicate about, study, and treat people with various mental disorders' (p xxvii). 22 Further,  the  role  of  the  categories per  se  as  the  sine  qua  non  for  diagnosis  seems  open, as in the following comment in the introduction to the DSM-III :  A 'misconception is that all  individuals  described  as  having  the  same  mental  disorder  are  alike in all important ways. Although all the individuals described  as  having  the  same  mental  disorder  show  at least the defining features of the disorder, they may well differ in other important ways that may affect clinical management and outcome' (p 6). 16

One  may  puzzle  somewhat  at  the  phrase  'defining features of the disorder,' given that the polythetic algorithms  permit  patients  in  a  number  of  categories (eg, Major Depressive Episode or Borderline Personality  Disorder)  to  be  assigned  a  diagnosis  with  only one symptom in common. Overall, however, it seems a safe inference that the framers of the modern DSM were willing to accommodate subgroups or other individual differences within the categories that they had created.  Fast-forwarding  to  the  contemporary  scene, the introduction to the DSM-5 is also quite explicit in acknowledging problems regarding heterogeneity, fluid boundaries between disorders, and other problems of diagnostic validity. 23 It is evident that the leaders of the DSM-5 were aware of such issues from the beginning of the revision process, and hoped to address the issues

## C l i n i c a l   r e s e a r c h

in the new edition. 24 As an initial response, DSM-5 contains an extensive section of assessment measures designed to account for cross-cutting symptoms; however, these remain at a relatively coarse level of symptom severity and are not likely to drive research applications that could relate such symptoms systematically to psychological or brain mechanisms.

Given  this  accommodation  of  heterogeneity  and flexibility, why has the DSM increasingly been cited as a major constraint for research? The answer seems to be that its architecture, in providing such an exemplary degree of structure and precision (or, as some critics have alleged, pseudo-precision)-particularly compared with  the  diagnostic  vacuum  that  existed  before  the DSM-III -resulted in a rapid reification of the disorder categories. 25 The diagnoses quickly shed their designation  as  provisional  constructs  and  were  implicitly  accorded the status of genuine disease entities. As a result, the DSM nosology  became  the  de  facto  standard  for reviewing  grant  applications  for  clinical  research  and for publishing journal articles on psychopathology. This led to clinical trials targeting DSM entities, and it was inevitable that the FDA would recognize this approbation from the field as the set of indications in registration trials for new pharmaceutical treatments. In short, the entire biomedical machinery for mental disorders became organized around DSM categories.

cal practice-along with consequent demands such as insurance reimbursements, legal determinations, etc-is simply too restrictive to permit the flexibility required for  rapidly  evolving research grant evaluations. These considerations, bolstered by comments from investigators throughout the field, finally prompted the NIMH to include the goal for a new, experimental classification system in its 2008 Strategic Plan.

The 'disease entity' model discouraged grant applications proposing exploration of any heterogeneity or subtyping within disorders, such that the standard research design became one of Disorder versus Healthy Controls. While a few studies compared symptoms between two categories (such as schizophrenia and bipolar  disorder),  investigators  complained  that  efforts  to examine  overlap  or  comorbidities  were  typically  rejected by study sections on the grounds that 'we have to understand each separate illness before we can explore the intersections.' This inertia in review persisted even in the face of the increasingly noted problems with the validity of the overall structure and its consequent problems for diagnosis and treatment. 21,26

This situation has created the paradox that innovations  in  research  are  needed  to  revise  conceptions  of mental  disorders  that  can  lead  to  precision  medicine applications,  but  paradigm-shifting  studies  are  largely precluded by the current constraints of grant review. It is apparent that at the current juncture, that, the hidebound structure necessitated by the DSM 's role in clini-

Given  this  decision,  the  form  that  such  an  effort might take was not necessarily clear. It was apparent from  the  genetic  overlaps  among  disorders  and  the transdiagnostic mechanisms observed in functional and structural pathophysiology studies (reflected in extensive comorbidity) that an experimental system could not simply follow the lines of the current manual. Further, the diagnostic entities are so ingrained throughout the field that major alterations could not be broached in the context of the current scheme. This can be seen, for instance, in the composition of the various committees for the DSM-5 . Had extensive changes been contemplated, the  workgroups  for  mood/anxiety  and  schizophrenia/ bipolar  spectrum  (as  just  two  examples)  might  have been merged in order to facilitate potentially major revisions. Instead, an informed observer could see from the  outset  of  the DSM-5 process  that  the  workgroup structure militated against any significant changes, and such was the outcome. Since the DSM-III ,  some  new disorders have been added and a few removed (notably, the folding of Asperger's disorder into the autism spectrum in DSM-5 ),  but successive editions largely made adjustments to the criteria without attempting fundamental modifications.

These observations affected the organizing principles of the RDoC project, which differs from the DSM-III in comprising a classification system intended purely for research purposes. Three decades of experience with the DSM criteria  in  peer  review  provided  several  insights into how such an experimental nosology might proceed. First, well-defined review standards are essential to provide  consistency  in  peer  review,  allowing  reviewers  to evaluate research grants by a common set of metrics and 'calibrate'  their  scores  against  each  other.  One  of  the clear strengths of the DSM in review (no doubt helping to account for its rapid reification) was the explicit list of criteria for defining disorders that provided reviewers with  a ready yardstick for evaluating diagnostic procedures. Simply leaving applicants and reviewers to their own  (nonDSM )  devices  in  proposing  and  evaluating

selection criteria for patients in clinical research would lead  to  a  chaotic  situation  in  review,  with  no  common agreement about how to evaluate the options.

On the other hand, it was equally evident that an experimental classification needed to avoid the opposite problem, of a system that became overly rigid and so difficult to change that it failed to keep up with the rapidly  advancing  pace  of  scientific  discoveries-thus frustrating researchers' ability to submit grant applications informed by cutting-edge developments. This pair of 'Scylla and Charybdis' hazards demanded a flexible set  of  guidelines  that  could  provide  consistent review standards while still accommodating fast-breaking new data.

This consideration led to the third conclusion, which involved  the  somewhat  counterintuitive  notion  that the  best  way  to  create  an  experimental  classification for disorders was to eschew any a priori definitions of disease states. Quantum gains in knowledge have been achieved  over  the  past  three  decades  regarding  complex  behaviors  and  the  brain  systems  that  implement them, an advance supported heavily by NIMH, other NIH institutes, and many other governmental and private  funders.  As  just  two  examples,  primordial  ideas about a brain reward system 27  have given way to an increasingly  differentiated  understanding  of  the  brain's systems for experiencing, learning about, and working toward reward 28,29 ; and seminal studies of the role of the amygdala in fear have led to a much richer understanding of the systems that respond to different threat contexts and dynamically regulate emotional reactions in real time. 30-32

Such work suggested the possibility of an alternative approach to psychopathology. Rather than starting with  clinically  derived  definitions  of  mental  disorders (necessarily  based  upon  presenting  signs  and  symptoms)  and  seeking  biological  or  psychological  correlates, RDoC reverses the process: the effort begins by creating  a  compendium  of  basic  behavioral/cognitive functions and pertinent brain circuits, and then considers disorders in terms of dysregulation or dysfunction in  these  basic  systems.  The  downside  to  such  an  approach consists of the fact that the classical symptoms of  mental  disorders-low  mood,  hallucinations,  low self-esteem, the abnormal social behavior of autismoften do not equate in any obvious way to the brain/ behavior systems so defined. The upside, however, lies in the potential for analyzing psychopathology in terms of the explosion of knowledge about the components of brain circuits and their relationships to complex behavior. Such a genuinely translational approach can be directly informed by ground-breaking initiatives such as the Human Connectome Project 33  and the US BRAIN initiative. 34

This  translational  research  direction  provides  the framework for RDoC's approach to providing clear, yet flexible guidelines for peer review. As noted above, expert participants at the five RDoC domain workshops were asked to devise a list of constructs to be included in that domain (starting with a draft list provided by the NIMH workgroup), based upon prior evidence in the literature. Each construct had to meet three empirical criteria to be included in the system. First, there had to be evidence for the validity of the construct as a functional unit of behavior or cognitive processes; second, there had to be evidence for a neural circuit or system that  played  a  primary  role  in  implementing  the  construct's function; and third, the construct had to evince relevance for understanding some aspects of psychopathology.

These  three  criteria  are  critical  for  understanding the  flexibility  of  the  RDoC  approach  to  peer  review. By definition, constructs are subject to refinement on the  basis  of  ongoing  research.  Further,  the  constructs defined in the workshop process serve as exemplars of how the approach operates, and also are 'pre-vetted' for use in grant applications. Finally, and critically, the framework encourages grant applications targeting new constructs in accord with its status as an experimental classification.  The  three  criteria  listed  above  provide the standard by which reviewers in study sections can evaluate the merits of proposed circuit-based functions. New constructs for which sufficient data become available can then be added to the matrix to provide dynamic, ongoing changes to the research framework.

Three other aspects of the RDoC framework also stem  from  the  need  to  change  the  way  that  mental disorders  are  conceptualized  and  studied. While  they are  equally  critical,  they  can  be  described  here  more briefly. First (as mentioned above), mental illnesses are increasingly understood to be disorders of neurodevelopment. 35   Just  as  the  RDoC  constructs  are  based  on normal-range functioning, the study of normal development provides a basis for understanding aberrant trajectories at different points along developmental pathways. Establishing the equivalent of the classic height

## C l i n i c a l   r e s e a r c h

and  weight  growth  charts  for  children  could  provide valuable guidelines to promote earlier identification of behavioral problems and also provide helpful information about psychopathology that may not manifest until later in development.

Second,  environmental  events  exert  profound  influences,  not  only  in  neurodevelopment-where  their precise  effects  may  depend  critically  upon  the  developmental stages at which they occur-but throughout the  life  course.  Examination  of  environmental  effects is hampered by the current dominance of the DSM in review, since environmental events such as stressors or trauma are known to affect many different disorders; studying the influences one disorder at a time (and typically  excluding  comorbidity)  obfuscates  the  ability  to uncover significant relationships that cut across disorders. While  some critics  have  complained  that  RDoC ignores environmental events, in fact the framework is intended to promote a more systematic study of these critical factors. It is for these reasons that neurodevelopment  and  environmental  effects  are  considered  as major axes of the RDoC framework.

That is, the intention is not to 'explain' such traditional categories  as  depression  or  schizophrenia  in  terms  of RDoC constructs, as this would obviously involve the same questions about the validity of the DSM categories  (and  the  same  problems  of  comorbidity,  etc)  as currently exist. However, this does not mean that various  symptoms  of DSM disorders  are  not  of  interest. The symptoms represent aspects of significant clinical impairment that deserve to be the focus of treatment efforts, and often these symptoms are observed in multiple disorders. It is the grouping of symptoms into what have turned out to be overly heterogeneous syndromes that  poses  the  problems  for  research.  In  virtually  all cases,  individual  symptoms  are  themselves  complex clinical  phenomena that require attention to multiple constituent mechanisms.

Finally, given a structure conceived in terms of basic functioning, the RDoC constructs are by definition dimensional-an approach that is obviously consistent with increasingly propounded dimensional views of psychopathology. 36,37 All basic functions display a range of performance, often normally distributed, and one goal of RDoC is to characterize this range quantitatively for each construct. Pathology can then be defined in terms of the degree of departure from the normal range, with the obvious capability of more readily establishing cutoff  points  to  define  (for  example)  mild,  moderate,  or severe  levels  of  disorder.  In  addition,  achieving  such quantitative dimensional  measures  would  facilitate prevention studies, which are frequently hobbled by a lack of consistent ways to connect risk states to overt psychopathology.

## Implications of RDoC for research

The RDoC framework differs from standard diagnostic approaches to such an extent that it can be difficult to discern exactly how the system is intended to function in research. It may be useful to start by indicating what RDoC does not incorporate. First, it is important to note that the RDoC matrix was not designed to provide a multifaceted account of DSM disorders as such.

Second,  there  is  a  salient  distinction  between  the first (RDC) and second (RDoC) versions of an experimental  classification  system,  the  former  having  given way relatively seamlessly to the current DSM architecture. The RDC were obviously intended to define disease entities, and the diagnoses in the list-determined by  clinical  consensus-were  largely  accepted  as 'givens' even if their definitions were altered somewhat on the basis of outcome data. This trend accelerated after the  release  of  the DSM-III and  the  reification  of  the disorder  categories.  It  is  natural  to  make  the  implicit assumption that RDoC follows this tradition, such that the constructs are inferred to be the 'real' disease entities in the system; to assume further that the function of  research  is  to  describe  the  pathophysiology  of  the constructs and seek biomarkers much as prior research using the DSM has operated; and finally, to assume that any changes will involve relatively minor tweaks to how the constructs are defined and measured.

However,  these  assumptions  are  not  correct,  for multiple reasons. For one thing, the RDoC dimensions have been instantiated as experimental constructs that are expected to change rapidly over time on the basis of new data. While some concerns have been expressed that the constructs may be subject to the same reification as DSM disorders, they are intended to be subject to  continual,  empirically  based  modifications  in  the natural  course  of  grant  submissions,  peer  review,  and publications-a process that the RDoC workgroup at NIMH is committed to maintaining.

In addition, there is no definitive or consistent relationship  between  RDoC  constructs  per  se  and  pu-

tative  definitions  of  disorders  for  which  treatment  is indicated.  For  a  few  constructs,  it  is  possible  that  the primary  aspect  of  a  clinical  presentation  may  be  assignable to a particular construct. An example might be excessive fear, as in anxiety disorders such as specific or social phobia; even here, however, there are findings of heterogeneity in threat reactivity that belie a simple 'excessive fear circuit activity' for all patients. 38 More typically, complex clinical symptoms are likely to reflect the confluence of abnormalities in a number of different  neural  systems;  auditory  verbal  hallucinations,  eg, are themselves heterogeneous and, across different patients, may involve a number of different neural systems that are represented in the RDoC matrix. 39

Finally,  as  mentioned  above,  the  RDoC  constructs represent basic functions with a translational extension to psychopathology, which is operationally considered as increasing dysregulation in functionality that can be construed as falling at one extreme or the other of the normal distribution. This view is consistent with prior perspectives about the dimensional nature of psychopathology  and  its  relationship  to  normal-range  functioning. 40 Thus, there is no simple mapping of disease/ no-disease states onto the constructs.

Given  these  caveats,  what  would  typical  RDoC studies comprise? Investigators new to the framework sometimes suppose that a sufficient research design involves simply recruiting a transdiagnostic sample and gathering a multisystem set of measurements about one or another construct to see what falls out of an exploratory  analysis. This,  however,  is  seldom  likely  to  be  a productive approach. The intent rather is to use the matrix to pursue specific, hypothesis-driven research questions that are related to clinically significant symptoms or  impairments.  Generally  speaking,  there  are  four broad  classes  of  phenomena  that  investigators  might choose  to  investigate.  First,  relatively  circumscribed clinical problems offer an opportunity to study a single construct  with  a  focused  research  question;  examples might include fear, working memory, or facial expression  identification.  Second,  more  complex  problems such as hallucinations (as noted above), anhedonia, or complex social function deficits are likely to be heterogeneous in their own right, and require thoughtful attention both to specific aspects of the symptoms under study and also to the potential intersection of two or more constructs from multiple domains. Third, a similar but yet more complicated class might include symp- tom clusters that  are  observed  to  co-occur  in  current DSM disorders  or  disorder  spectra,  such  as  positive symptoms in psychotic disorders or vegetative signs in depression. While  it  seems  reasonable  to  hypothesize that such clusters will have some common genetic and pathophysiological elements, a precision medicine approach will persist toward the ultimate goal of accounting for the significant heterogeneity of these clusters as well. Finally, broad temperament-related traits that are continuously distributed in the population and possess clear  relevance  for  multiple  disorders  present  opportune RDoC targets. Externalizing behaviors represent a promising example of this class of studies. While community and epidemiological studies have clearly shown that externalizing cuts across multiple disorders, 41 effective integration in this broad area has been constrained by the usual tendency of clinical research to focus upon only one disorder in any given study.

The  kinds  of  samples  and  research  designs  that might be used in RDoC studies are quite diverse, again reflecting the desideratum to leave the system as open as possible for researchers to craft studies that optimally address their research questions. The minimal requirements for an RDoC research design would include a focused hypothesis about particular clinical impairments or risk factors (as above), measurements from multiple Units  of Analysis,  and  the  inclusion  of  at  least  some subjects exhibiting (or at risk for) clinically significant symptoms. Elements that contribute to stronger RDoC designs  would  typically  include  studies  with  samples from multiple  diagnostic  categories  as  appropriate  to the research question; control groups that contribute to an analysis of the dimensional nature of the problem under  study;  and  consideration  of  the  developmental aspects (at all stages of the life course) of the research question, although this can be addressed in various ways and does not necessitate a longitudinal design in each case. While RDoC emphasizes transdiagnostic designs, it is acceptable for studies to focus upon deconstructing a single DSM disorder in terms of a dimensional and RDoC-informed  approach,  particularly  if  the  investigator indicates the potential future expansion to other relevant disorders. The most critical factor is to consider the kind of sampling strategy that will power the study for analysis of the experimental hypotheses, which (as in  all  applications)  is  an  essential  component  of  peer review. While it is admittedly difficult for investigators steeped in traditional  clinical  research  to  reorient  to-

ward such different study designs, the growing number of  funded  grants  in  the  NIMH  translational  portfolio and the accelerating literature in this area demonstrate the importance of new perspectives about the relationships of brain and behavior with respect to mental illness.

## Conclusion

This review has attempted to outline the major aspects of RDoC as an experimental classification for mental disorders, and to differentiate the approach from prior versions of research and clinical nosologies. The overall goal of the RDoC framework for research is to liberate investigators to pursue research questions in psychopathology that take advantage of burgeoning knowledge about complex behaviors and how these relate to specified  aspects  of  brain  activity. The  tactic  by  which  this strategy is pursued is to create standards for the review of research grant applications that provide not a fixed

set of items for diagnosis, but rather a set of guidelines for evaluating the strength of hypotheses relating clinical symptoms or impairments to dimensions of behavioral functioning and neural systems. As these systems are  largely  orthogonal  to  current  disorder  classifications, the hope is that the research literature developed via the RDoC framework will lead to future revisions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and DSM that  can  foster  precision  medicine  approaches to more effective diagnosis, treatment, and, ultimately, prevention  and  cures  for  mental  disorders. The  exact shape  that  future  RDoC-informed  nosologies  might take is not yet possible to discern, but just as with the current systems, the ultimate clinical utility will depend upon how well the diagnostic system can direct clinicians  to  rapid  and  effective  treatment  or  prevention strategies for each individual patient. ❏

## Criterios del ámbito de la investigación: hacia futuras nosologías psiquiátricas

A  comienzos  de  2009  el  Instituto  Nacional  de  Salud Mental (NIMH) lanzó el proyecto Criterios del Ámbito de la Investigación (RDoC) como parte de la implementación del Objetivo 1.4 de su recién publicado plan estratégico. En conformidad con la misión del NIMH, para 'transformar la comprensión y el tratamiento de las enfermedades mentales a través de la investigación básica y clínica' el RDoC fue concebido explícitamente como una iniciativa  relacionada  con  la  investigación.  La  declaración del objetivo pertinente en el plan estratégico señala:  'Desarrollar,  para  propósitos  de  investigación nuevas vías de clasificación de los trastornos mentales en base a dimensiones observables de la conducta y mediciones neurobiológicas'. Debido al novedoso enfoque que  tiene  el  RDoC  para  conceptualizar  y  estudiar  los trastornos mentales, ha recibido gran atención, mucho más allá de las fronteras de la comunidad de investigación  inmediata.  Esta  revisión  discute  los  fundamentos del marco experimental que ha adoptado el RDoC y sus repercusiones futuras para la nosología de los trastornos mentales.

## Critères de domaines de recherche : vers une future nosologie psychiatrique

Le NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) a lancé le projet de « Critères de domaines de recherche » (CDoR) début 2009, en tant qu'application de l'objectif 1.4 de son  plan  stratégique  venant  d'être  publié.  Les  CDoR ont été conçus explicitement comme une initiative liée à la recherche, en phase avec la mission du NIMH pour «  transformer  la  compréhension  et  le  traitement  des maladies mentales par la recherche fondamentale et clinique ». L'objectif exposé dans le plan stratégique est le suivant : « Développer, aux fins de recherche, de nouvelles  façons  de  classifier  des  troubles  mentaux  selon des critères de comportements observables et des mesures neurobiologiques ». Cette nouvelle approche des CDoR pour concevoir et étudier les troubles mentaux a reçu une grande attention, bien au-delà des frontières des communautés de chercheurs. Cet article analyse le fondement du cadre expérimental adopté par les CDoR et ses implications dans l'avenir pour la nosologie des troubles mentaux.
