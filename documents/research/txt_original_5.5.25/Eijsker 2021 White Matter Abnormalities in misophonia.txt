Attention ABSTRACT  
Misophonia is a condition in which specific ordinary sounds provoke disproportionately strong negative affect 
and physiological arousal. Evidence for neurobiological abnormalities underlying misophonia is scarce. Since 
many psychiatric disorders show white matter (WM) abnormalities, we tested for both macro and micro- 
structural WM differences between misophonia patients and healthy controls. 
We collected T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images from 24 patients and 25 
matched controls. We tested for group differences in WM volume using whole-brain voxel-based morphometry 
and used the significant voxels from this analysis as seeds for probabilistic tractography. After calculation of 
diffusion tensors, we compared group means for fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and directional diffu-
sivities, and applied tract-based spatial statistics for voxel-wise comparison. 
Compared to controls, patients had greater left-hemispheric WM volumes in the inferior fronto-occipital 
fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, and body of the corpus callosum connecting bilateral superior frontal 
gyri. Patients also had lower averaged radial and mean diffusivities and voxel-wise comparison indicated large 
and widespread clusters of lower mean diffusivity. 
We found both macro and microstructural WM abnormalities in our misophonia sample, suggesting miso-
phonia symptomatology is associated with WM alterations. These biological alterations may be related to dif-
ferences in social-emotional processing, particularly recognition of facial affect, and to attention for affective 
information.   
1.Introduction 
Misophonia is a newly described condition in which specific ordinary 
sounds, such as breathing or lip-smacking, provoke disproportionately 
strong involuntary feelings of anger, anxiety, and/or disgust, with 
accompanying physiological arousal, such as sweating and increased 
heart rate, and skeletal muscle responses (see Edelstein et al., 2013; 
Jager et al., 2020; Jastreboff and Jastreboff 2014; Dozier et al., 2017 for 
review; Dozier and Morrison 2017; Potgieter et al., 2019; Rouw and 
Erfanian 2018; Schroder et al., 2013; Schroder et al., 2019 ). It has been 
proposed that low-intensity stimuli become conditioned triggers over 
time, resulting in experience and context-dependent misophonic re-
actions (Schroder et al., 2013; Jastreboff and Jastreboff 2014; Dozier 
2015 ). Prevalence rate estimates vary between 3.2% (Jastreboff and Jastreboff 2014 ) and 6% (Zhou et al., 2017 ). Population studies with 
undergraduate students indicate nearly 20–50% of students reported 
some misophonia-like sound sensitivity (Naylor et al., 2021; Wu et al., 
2014 ), yet such studies are often subject to response bias (Groves et al., 
2004 ). In only 6% this was associated with clinical impairment (Zhou 
et al., 2017 ) and when setting the threshold for clinical significance 
based on symptom severity generally reported by help-seeking miso-
phonia samples (Jager et al., 2020; Schroder et al., 2019 ), approximately 
12% of undergraduates would report clinically significant symptoms 
(Naylor et al., 2021 ). Misophonia symptoms are strongly associated with 
impairments in work/study, social, and family life (Wu et al., 2014; 
Zhou et al., 2017 ). The consistent and distinct pattern of symptoms 
suggests it might be a discrete mental disorder (Jager et al., 2020; Pot-
gieter et al., 2019; Schroder et al., 2013; Taylor 2017 ), yet

2neurobiological evidence remains scarce. 
Neuroimaging studies have used audiovisual and auditory stimuli to 
provoke symptoms and implicated areas involved in salience attribution 
and emotional processing, including the anterior insula, the cingulate 
cortex, ventromedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices, amygdala, 
and hippocampus (Cerliani and Rouw, 2020; Kumar et al., 2017; 
Schroder et al., 2019 ). Also areas responsible for sensory processing and 
behavioral responses have been implicated (Cerliani and Rouw, 2020 ). 
Furthermore, evidence points to a symptom provocation-related wors-
ening of cognitive control on the Stroop task (Daniels et al., 2020 ), 
generally abnormal alerting attention (Frank et al., 2020 ), and a 
response bias – yet intact response inhibition – on the visual stop signal 
task (Eijsker et al., 2019 ). We previously found higher resting-state 
functional connectivity between the amygdala and cerebellum, as well 
as within the visual cortex as part of the ventral attention network 
(Eijsker et al., 2021 ). This evidence points to patients additionally 
exhibiting attentional and behavioral abnormalities outside of 
symptom-provoking contexts. Sensory function as early as pre-attentive 
auditory processing seems affected, as suggested by aberrant event- 
related electrophysiological potentials in response to (non-trigger) 
oddball sounds (Schroder et al., 2014 ). 
Only two studies have considered structural abnormalities in miso-
phonia. In patients compared to controls, we previously found greater 
gray matter (GM) volume in the right amygdala (Eijsker et al., 2021 ), 
whereas Kumar et al. (2017) found greater myelination of ventromedial 
prefrontal GM. White matter (WM) integrity is associated with global 
cognition and a range of executive and motor functions (Peters et al., 
2012; Vernooij et al., 2009 ). Therefore, it is not surprising that many 
psychiatric disorders show WM abnormalities. Functional aberrations 
like those found in misophonia have been linked to WM structure ab-
normalities in other disorders. For instance, emotional disorders often 
show reduced WM volumes, on the macrostructural scale, and integrity, 
on a microstructural scale (Daniels et al., 2013; Jenkins et al., 2016 ). 
Additionally, the poor attentional control found in adolescents with 
attentional, affective, and behavioral disorders has been linked to 
decreased WM integrity in WM tracts that differed from those showing 
such a link in healthy participants (Shafer et al., 2020 ). Moreover, 
decreased WM integrity has been linked to abnormal auditory and 
multisensory processing and inattention in children with autism spec-
trum disorder and/or sensory processing disorders (Chang et al., 2014; 
Owen et al., 2013 ). Therefore, we tested whether misophonia patients 
show differences in WM structure from healthy subjects. 
To test for both macro and micro-structural WM differences between 
patients and controls, we used T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), respectively. Volumetric WM 
changes can be assessed by applying voxel-based morphometry (VBM) 
to T1-weighted data, which is sensitive to local differences independent 
of large-scale brain volume (Ashburner and Friston 2001 ), whereas DTI 
detects microstructural WM differences, including proxies for integrity 
(see Assaf and Pasternak 2008 for review). We also tested whether WM 
structure correlated differently with age between the groups. Since re-
ports on WM structure in misophonia are close-to-none and there is 
considerable heterogeneity between more well-researched psychopa -
thologies, such as trauma-related, autism-spectrum, and obsessive- 
compulsive disorders (Daniels et al., 2013; Deramus and Kana 2015; 
van den Heuvel et al., 2009 ), we opted for an exploratory whole-brain 
voxel-wise approach. 
2.Materials & methods 
2.1. Participants 
Twenty-four misophonia patients were recruited from the Amster -
dam University Medical Centers (Amsterdam UMC, location Academic 
Medical Center) outpatient clinic. Patients underwent a standard psy-
chiatric interview in which they were diagnosed on the basis of the criteria postulated by Schroder et al. (2013) by three AMC psychiatrists 
experienced in diagnosing misophonia. The interview additionally 
assessed general medical and psychiatric histories. Twenty-five controls, 
matched on age, sex, and education level, were recruited via adver -
tisements at the Amsterdam UMC and University of Amsterdam. 
Potential participants, females and males aged between 18 and 65 
years, were assessed with a telephone interview by a psychiatrist (A.S.) 
not involved in the initial misophonia diagnosis, in which they were 
asked about possible (additional) misophonia symptoms, psychiatric 
diagnoses, current and previous health issues, medication use, alcohol or 
substance use, and handedness. We screened for personality disorders 
using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis II Disorders 
(SCID-II; First et al., 1997 ). Exclusion criteria for all participants 
included presence of major depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disor -
der, psychotic disorder, autism spectrum disorder, substance related 
disorder, hearing loss, epilepsy, structural central nervous system dis-
order, stroke within the last year, and MRI contraindications. No hearing 
tests were applied, because previous extensive testing, including pure 
tone, speech audiometry, and loudness discomfort levels, of misophonia 
patients prior to receiving treatment, did not result in any notable 
hearing problems. An inclusion criterion only for patients was that they 
experienced anger – a subset also experienced disgust – in reaction to 
eating sounds and at least three of the following sounds: heavy breath -
ing/sniffling, keyboard typing, chewing, and slurping. One patient re-
ported symptoms with only two out of four sounds, but was still included 
because of severe symptoms. Patients additionally were required to not 
have had treatment for their misophonia. Another exception was made 
for one patient who had received unsuccessful treatment. Two patients 
had comorbid attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder, of whom one 
used methylphenidate (30 mg daily), and another had a borderline 
personality disorder. 
The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the 
Amsterdam UMC. All participants were informed about the nature of the 
experimental procedures and subsequently provided written informed 
consent prior to inclusion in the study. Current data were obtained in a 
larger study in which we also collected functional MRI during symptom- 
provocation (Schroder et al., 2019 ), performance of a stop signal task 
(Eijsker et al., 2019 ) and rest (Eijsker et al., 2021 ), with a total scanning 
time of approximately 43 min. 
2.2. Demographic and clinical characteristics 
Using SPSS software version 25 (IBM), we tested for group differ -
ences in sex, age, and education level to ensure demographically similar 
groups. We also tested for group differences in score on the Symptom 
Checklist (SCL-90; Derogatis et al., 1973 ), Hamilton Anxiety and 
Depression Rating Scales (HAM-A; HAM-D; Hamilton 1959; Hamilton 
1960 ), and Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire subscales and total 
score (BPAQ; Buss and Perry 1992 ) to assess differences in clinical 
characteristics. We used the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S; 
Schroder et al., 2013 ), which is an adaptation of the Yale-Brown 
Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Goodman et al., 1989 ), to assess miso-
phonia symptom severity. Factor analysis of A-MISO-S data has indi-
cated it to be a unidimensional tool with good internal consistency 
(Naylor et al., 2021 ), yet further validation is needed. We compared 
groups using Chi-squared tests for categorical variables and Welch ’s t- 
tests for continuous variables, respectively. Effect sizes for these tests are 
expressed in Phi coefficient and Cohen ’s d, respectively. We corrected 
for testing 8 clinical scores using the Tukey-Ciminera-Heyse (TCH) 
method with the modification suggested by Sankoh et al. (1997) , which 
takes the covariance of the tested measures into account and is suited 
when the scores are highly correlated (r F0.5). 
2.3. MRI data acquisition 
Images were acquired on a Philips Ingenia 3.0 T MRI system (Philips N. Eijsker et al.

3Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands) with a 32-channel head coil. To 
minimize movement artifacts, participants ’ heads were fixed using foam 
padding and participants were asked to lay as still as possible. We ac-
quired whole-brain anatomical T1-weighted images (3D MP-RAGE, 
SENSE factor 2.5, voxel size 1 mm3, TR/TE 7000/3.2 ms, ma-
trix 256×256, field of view 256×240 mm, 180 transverse slices, 
scanning time 4 min and 14 s, automatic T1 stabilization) and diffusion- 
weighted images (2D spin-echo using a single shell without multiband 
acceleration and cardiac gating, SENSE factor 2, slice thickness 2 
mm, TR/TE 8015/92 ms, matrix 112×112, field of view 224 mm, 
60 transverse slices, whole brain coverage) with diffusion gradients 
applied along 64 (n 46, scanning time 9 min and 31 s) or 48 (n 3; 1 
control and 2 patients, scanning time 6 min and 59 s) directions (b 
1000 s/mm2), and 4 (n 36) or 1 (n 13; 7 controls and 6 patients) 
reference b 0 image(s). No reverse-phase encoded scans were ac-
quired. All DICOM files were converted to NifTI format using dcm2niix 
(https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix ). See Supplementary Table 1 
for additional acquisition information. 
2.3.1. VBM analysis 
T1-weighted images were preprocessed and analyzed in Statistical 
Parametric Mapping (SPM) version 12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for 
Neuroimaging, 2014), implemented in Matlab version R2016a (The 
MathWorks, Inc.). The T1-weighted images were visually inspected and 
their origin was manually set to the anterior commissure to ensure 
correct segmentation. Then, they were segmented into GM, WM, and 
corticospinal fluid (CSF) using rigid-body alignment and SPM ’s tissue 
priors, saving both native and Dartel imported images. Hereafter, WM 
templates were created using Dartel (Ashburner 2007; Ashburner and 
Friston 2009 ), which iteratively aligns the data to generate increasingly 
crisp templates to which the native space images were subsequently 
spatially normalized. This resulted in WM maps in Montreal Neurolog -
ical Institute (MNI) space with voxels of 1.5 mm3, which were then 
smoothed with an 8 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian 
kernel and Jacobian scaled. Total intracranial volume was calculated by 
summation of GM, WM, and CSF volumes outputted by segmentation. 
We added the groups to a general linear model, also adding age, sex, 
and total intracranial volume as covariates not-of-interest. All voxels 
with intensities below 20% of the mean voxel intensity were excluded 
from analysis (absolute threshold masking at 0.2). We separately tested 
whether the groups had a different relationship of age with a WM vol-
ume group ×age interaction, independent of overall group effects, and 
with age demeaned within groups. No global normalization or overall 
grand mean scaling were applied. Statistical tests were family-wise error 
(FWE) rate corrected for multiple comparisons at the peak level (p D
0.05, two-tailed). 
2.3.2. DTI analysis 
Diffusion-weighted images were visually inspected and eddy qc was 
used for quality control (Bastiani et al., 2019 ). No movements exceeded 
3 mm of translation or 3 degrees of rotation and the groups did not differ 
in average (t(47) 0.1, p .93) or maximum (t(47) 0.3, p .77) 
movement. Using MRtrix 3.0 functions, we denoised the data (dwi-
denoise ; Veraart et al., 2016 ), corrected for Gibbs ringing artefacts 
(mrdegibbs ; Kellner et al., 2016 ), extracted references images (dwiex -
tract) and, if multiple were available, averaged them. Then, using 
functions from the FDT toolbox of FMRIB Software Library version 6.0 
(FSL; http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl ; Jenkinson et al., 2012 ), we 
created a binary brain mask by applying a 10% threshold (bet) to the 
reference images, which we then used to correct for eddy currents and 
subject motion (eddy; Andersson and Sotiropoulos 2016 ). Weighted least 
squares diffusion tensor models were subsequently fit at each voxel 
(dtifit), resulting in maps for each subject for diffusivity along the main 
axis – axial diffusivity (AD), the combined perpendicular axes – radial 
diffusivity (RD), mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA), 
which describes how strongly oriented diffusivity is. Using the Tract- based Spatial Statistics (TBSS; Smith et al., 2006 ) toolbox, these maps 
were aligned to the 1 mm3 FMRIB58_FA target provided by FSL, which is 
in MNI standard space. This was done by the nonlinear registration tool 
FNIRT (Andersson et al., 2007 ), which uses a b-spline representation of 
the registration warp field (Rueckert et al., 1999 ). A threshold of 0.2 was 
applied to the average FA map to obtain a binary FA skeleton for use in 
group comparison. Lastly, subjects ’ aligned FA, MD, RD, and AD images 
were projected onto this skeleton. 
First, we used Welch ’s t-tests to assess whether the means of these 
DTI measures differed between the groups and we calculated Cohen ’s d. 
We corrected for testing 4 DTI measures using the modified TCH method 
described above. Then, we applied voxel-wise statistical analysis to the 
FA, MD, RD, and AD maps using permutation testing (FSL ’s PALM ; 
10.000 permutations) with sex and age as covariates and Threshold-Free 
Cluster Enhancement (TFCE), resulting in FWE-corrected p-values. 
Using FSL’s cluster , we extracted cluster and peak information from the t- 
map masked to show only significant voxels. Affected tracts were 
identified using the JHU White-Matter Tractography Atlas and JHU 
ICBM-DTI-81 White-Matter Labels (Mori et al., 2005; Wakana et al., 
2007; Hua et al., 2008 ). For visualization of the results, we fattened the 
results to increase visibility using tbss_fill . We also tested whether the 
groups had a different relationship of age with any DTI measure (group 
×age interaction, independent of overall group effects, and with age 
demeaned within groups) again using permutation testing with TFCE. 
Scans of 3 participants, 1 control and 2 patients, were acquired with 
diffusion gradients in 48 instead of 64 directions, so we also tested 
whether excluded these participants affected the results. 
Lastly, we performed probabilistic tractography using the FDT 
toolbox (BEDPOSTX; PROBTRACKX ), which uses Bayesian techniques 
and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the most probable 
location of a pathway (Behrens et al., 2007 ). Due to a lack of evidence on 
misophonia WM structure to inform tractography, we did fiber tracking 
using the peak voxels of the VBM results as seeds. We did not perform 
tracking on the TBSS results, because these were considerably profuse 
and diffuse. After transforming the peak voxel MNI coordinates to sub-
ject space using SPM ’s coregister with nearest neighbor interpolation, 
5000 streamlines were initiated per seed using a step length of 0.5 mm 
and a curvature threshold of 0.2. We thresholded these maps to only 
contain voxels with at least 20 (out of 5000) streamlines and binarized 
them before transforming them back to MNI space using trilinear 
interpolation. We inventoried the resulting tracts by identification using 
the JHU WM Tractography and JHU ICBM-DTI-81 WM labels atlases. 
For visualization, we then summed and thresholded these maps to only 
show tracts shared by at least 50% of subjects. For two subjects, trac-
tography using the seed depicted in Fig. 1A did not generate any plau-
sible tracts. 
2.3.3. Correlational analysis 
To see whether structural abnormalities had a linear relationship 
with clinical characteristics in patients, we used SPSS to compute 
Pearson correlations, for patients only, between WM volume at the peak 
coordinates (based on p-value) and mean MD within the FA skeleton and 
scores on the A-MISOS-S, HAM-A, and anger subscale of the BPAQ. We 
corrected for testing 3 clinical measures using the Dubey/Armitage- 
Parmar (D/AP) method with the modification suggested by Sankoh 
et al. (1997) , which is suited when the scores have low correlations (r D
0.5). Lastly, we computed partial correlations to see whether correcting 
for age and sex substantially influenced the correlations. 
3.Results 
3.1. Demographic and clinical characteristics 
Table 1 shows group characteristics. The groups did not significantly 
differ in age, proportion of females/males, or education level. In pa-
tients, symptoms emerged on average around the age of twelve and the N. Eijsker et al.

NeuroImage: Clinical 32 (2021) 102787
4average symptom severity (A-MISO-S) scored as 14.9 out of a maximum 
of 40. Patients scored significantly higher than controls on general 
psychopathy (SCL-90; Derogatis et al., 1973 ), anxiety (HAM-A), 
depression (HAM-D), anger (BPAQ total score and subscale), and hate 
(BPAQ subscale). 
3.2. White matter volume and probabilistic tractography 
Patients had greater WM volumes in frontal white matter (Fig. 1A 
and B) and we used the two significant peak voxels as seeds for proba -
bilistic tractography. Tractography from the most anterior peak voxel (t 
(44) 5.17, p-FWE 0.044, MNI [–22, 54,  6]) showed streamlines 
along the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and anterior 
thalamic radiation (ATR), whereas tractography from the peak voxel in 
the body of the corpus callosum (BCC; t(44) 5.12, p-FWE 0.050, MNI 
[-15, 22, 27]) showed streamlines that extended bilaterally towards the 
superior frontal gyri (Fig. 1C). Additionally, this seed also showed 
streamlines along the ATR, yet more along the dorsolateral aspect of the 
ATR, whereas streamlines from the anterior peak voxel ran more along 
the ventromedial aspect. We found no group ×age interactions for WM 
volume. See Supplementary Table 2 for an overview of non-significant 
VBM results. 3.3. Diffusivity measures 
T-testing of FA, MD, RD, and AD averages indicated lower mean MD 
and RD within the FA skeleton of patients compared to controls, with 
Cohen ’s d values around 0.8 (Table 2). Voxel-wise analysis indicated 
bilateral and widespread lower MD in patients compared to controls, 
covering the forceps minor/genu of corpus callosum, superior and 
inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and the inferior fronto-occipital fascic -
ulus (Table 3; Fig. 2). We found no group ×age interactions for diffu-
sivity measures. Excluding the 3 scans acquired with different 
parameters did not render any significant findings non-significant. 
3.4. Correlational analysis 
Neither WM volume at peak voxels (IFOF/ATR nor BCC/ATR) nor 
peak voxel MD had a linear relationship with the A-MISOS-S, HAM-A, or 
the anger subscale of the BPAQ (Table 4). Correction for age and sex did 
not substantially changes these results (Supplementary Table 3). 
4.Discussion 
Compared to controls, patients with misophonia had greater white

controls at (A) the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus/ 
anterior thalamic radiation and (B) the left body of the corpus 
callosum/anterior thalamic radiation. Voxels with p-uncorrec -

5matter (WM) volumes at two locations in the left frontal cortex. Prob-
abilistic tractography using these locations as seeds implicated the 
inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), anterior thalamic radiation 
(ATR), and the body of the corpus callosum (BCC). Patients also had 
lower averaged radial and mean diffusivities (RD and MD, respectively) 
within the fractional anisotropy (FA) skeleton and voxel-wise compari -
son indicated large and widespread clusters of lower MD in patients 
compared to controls. 
Macrostructural WM differences were found in tracts connecting 
fronto-polar and basal orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to occipital and su-
perior parietal cortex (IFOF; Sarubbo et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2016 ) and 
the medial portion of the superior frontal gyri bilaterally (BCC). Both 
seeds also generated streamlines along the ATR, which connects the OFC 
and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) with the dorsomedial thalamus and anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN; Coenen et al., 2012 ). On the 
microstructural level, patients had lower average MD and RD, which 
scale negatively with myelination and axonal density and positively 
with presence of other cells, such as astrocytes, and axonal spacing and 
extracellular volume, respectively (Gulani et al., 2001; Mottershead 
et al., 2003; Schwartz et al., 2004; Schmierer et al., 2008; Heckel et al., 
2015 ). Logically, an increase in axonal density is accompanied by 
increased myelin volume and decreased extracellular space/axonal 
spacing. Since RD does not to correlate with myelin sheath thickness 
(Schwartz et al., 2004 ), these results likely reflect high myelin volume as 
a result of high axonal density in patients (Gulani et al., 2001; Schmierer 
et al., 2008 ). The findings also point to high WM integrity, because MD 
and RD scale negatively with FA and (sensory) nerve conduction ve-
locity, respectively (Gulani et al., 2001; Heckel et al., 2015 ). We found a 
medium to large effect size (Cohen ’s d 0.6), though statistically 
insignificant effect, for higher mean FA in patients. FA depends on the 
ratio of the directional diffusivities, increasing when AD increases and/ 
or RD decreases. Both directional diffusivities were lower rather than 
higher in patients, explaining why the group difference in MD, and not 
FA, reached statistical significance. Voxel-wise analysis indicated lower 
MD for patients compared to controls in various WM tracts, including 
bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi (IFOF), uncinate fasciculi 
(UF), anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), inferior and superior longitu -
dinal fasciculi (ILF and SLF), and forceps minor and major (FMi and 
FMa). 
The tracts affected in our misophonia patients are involved in two 
cooperative brain functions that are of particular relevance to miso-
phonia: social-emotional processing and attention towards emotionally Table 1

6salient information. The ILF and UF connect the amygdala to the oc-
cipital cortex, including the fusiform gyrus, and the OFC and frontal 
pole, respectively. Damage to the right UF impairs emotional empathy 
(Oishi et al., 2015 ), whereas high MD and RD in ILF and damage to the 
right IFOF have been associated with difficulty recognizing facial 
emotion (Genova et al., 2015; Philippi et al., 2009 ). Another tract connecting subcortical and cortical regions is the ATR, which connects 
the OFC and ATN. Interaction of these regions regulates automatic 
attentional capture by emotional stimuli and voluntary orienting to-
wards task-relevant stimuli (Hartikainen et al., 2012 ). The anterior IFOF 
and SLF have likewise been linked to attention regulation and connect 
the frontal cortex to parietal and sensory (occipital and temporal,

7respectively) cortices (Sarubbo et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2016 ). Emotional 
disorders were found to share alterations in the SLF, which the authors 
specifically related to impaired perception of and attention to emotional 
information (Jenkins et al., 2016 ). The forceps minor and major connect 
the bilateral frontal and occipital cortices, respectively. Higher MD and 
RD in the FMi of ADHD patients correlated positively with inattention 
and negatively with executive function (Lawrence et al., 2013 ), whereas 
the FMa subserves visual processing. Lastly, the BCC connects bilateral 
superior frontal gyri. More specifically, the streamlines connected to a 
region also called the Premotor Ear-Eye Field (PEEF) that is specifically 
sensitive to complex auditory information and involved in gaze-shifting 
towards peripheral space based on information on sound spatial locali -
zation from auditory cortex (see Lanzilotto et al., 2013 for review). 
The functional role of both tracts and connected brain areas impli -
cated in our imaging study fits well with the neuropsychological profile 
of misophonia. Aberrant social-emotional processing, particularly 
recognition of facial emotion, is in line with the social nature of trigger 
sounds, which are generally produced by other humans, and previous 
studies finding greater right amygdala volume and abnormal activation 
and heightened resting-state connectivity of the fusiform cortex (Eijsker 
et al., 2021; Schroder et al., 2019 ), which processes stimuli of visual 
expertise such as human faces (Burns et al., 2019; Fox et al., 2009 ). 
Specifically, the latter was found with an independent component 
analysis in both fusiform and superior occipital cortex as part of the 
ventral attention network (Eijsker et al., 2021 ), which is involved in 
stimulus-driven attention. We interpreted this as sensory enhancement 
of trigger-related visual input, which we speculate could also be linked 
to the low MD in the FMi. WM abnormalities in attention-related net-
works is concordant with patients reporting heightened orientation to-
wards aversive triggers, which activate the salience network, and their 
experiencing difficulties to shift their attention to other aspects of the 
environment (Kumar et al., 2017; Schroder et al., 2019 ). Indeed, a se-
lective attention impairment has been found in the presence of symptom 
provoking sounds (da Silva and Sanchez 2018 ) and isin line with the 
aberrant N1 potential reflecting early automatic attentional processes 
(Schroder et al., 2014 ). Frank et al. (2020) likewise found impaired 
alerting attention in misophonia patients, which was irrespective of 
exposure to trigger sounds, suggesting a general attention deficit rather 
than a specific attentional bias. 
Our modest sample size limits the generalizability of the results and 
power of the analyses, explaining why group effects with considerable 
effect sizes did not reach statistical significance. Also, Kumar et al. 
(2017) found WM alterations within vmPFC, which we did not find. This 
is likely due to the authors limiting their structural analysis to the areas 
that showed altered functional connectivity with the left anterior insula 
during symptom provocation. We, on the other hand, performed whole- 
brain exploratory analyses, which requires rigorous multiple compari -
son correction and therefore detects only strong and/or widespread ef-
fects. Still, replication of current results is warranted. Future studies 
might relate WM alterations in misophonia to differences in emotional 
reactivity, attentional functioning, and cognitive control and the effect 
of symptom-provocation hereon. Specifically, considering the amount of 
evidence implicating alterations in amygdala, fronto-parietal, and oc-
cipital areas, especially the fusiform cortices, we propose direct inves -
tigation of processing of trigger-related visual scenes in misophonia. 
This would primarily focus on human faces, considering the prevalence 
of nasal and oral misophonia triggers (Edelstein et al., 2013; Schroder 
et al., 2013 ). 
In conclusion, we have found both macro and microstructural WM 
alterations in misophonia patients, implicating systems involved in 
social-emotional and attentional processing. These results provide 
further evidence for a neurobiological basis of misophonia. Yet addi-
tional research remains required to establish its biological basis that may 
provide the foundation for its classification as a discrete disorder. CRediT authorship contribution statement
