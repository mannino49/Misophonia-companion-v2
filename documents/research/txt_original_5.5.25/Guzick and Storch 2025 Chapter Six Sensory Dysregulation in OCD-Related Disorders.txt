6 Sensory Dysregulation in Obsessive­
Compulsive-Related Disorders 
David C. Houghton 
Introduction 
Obsessive-compulsive related disorders (OCRDs) are generally con­
ceptualized as fear-based and impulse-control disorders, in which the 
pathology is attributed to maladaptive cognitions, diﬃculty regulating 
emotions, and impaired self-control. These “top-down ” conceptualizations 
dominate most theoretical models of OCD. However, potentially impor­
tant “bottom-up ” processes have been identiﬁed, which may help inform 
neurodevelopmental models of OCD. From as far back as 1903, Pierre 
Janet ’s early account of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) described 
the foundation of the illness as a psychasthenic state characterized by 
feelings of ‘incompleteness ’ (Pitman, 1987). Janet depicted incompleteness 
as a chronic sense of perceptual unease in which the imperfections of the 
world feel intolerable and states of uniformity and order are constantly 
sought. While Janet ’s model fell out of favor among theorists for nearly a 
century, ﬁndings from recent research warrant reconsideration. A growing 
body of research has indeed documented abnormal sensory phenomena in 
OCRDs including OCD as well as chronic tic disorder (CTD), body-
focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs) (e.g., trichotillomania, excoriation 
disorder), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), and health anxiety disorder 
(HAD). Evidence suggests these experiences are not epi-phenomenal, but 
rather that dysregulation of sensory and perceptual processes may precede 
the clinical onset of OCRDs, have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on symptom 
expression, and therefore may represent a key neurodevelopmental com­
ponent of OCRD etiology. 
Premonitory urges 
Although many compulsive behavior symptoms of OCRDs are preceded 
by cognitive or aﬀective events, some are completed without any explicit 
reason or justiﬁcation. This is especially the case in children and adoles­
cents, who are still developing insight and meta-cognition (Lewin et al., 
2010), or the ability to identify and describe their own thoughts. Instead,

aﬀected persons describe a vague somatic “urge”, “craving ”,o r “desire ” to 
engage in the compulsion, which is often diﬃcult to tolerate or resist. This 
is most clearly seen in CTD, as tics are purposeless behaviors that lack 
obsessional precursors. Persons with CTDs frequently describe “pre­
monitory urges ” that precede tics and are temporarily alleviated upon tic 
execution (Banaschewski et al., 2003; Leckman et al., 1993). Accordingly, 
theorists posited that premonitory urges may act as negative reinforcers 
and represent a key factor maintaining tic symptoms. Since the identiﬁca­
tion of premonitory urges as potentially important aspects of CTDs, 
research has likewise identiﬁed similar premonitory urge phenomena in 
other OCRDs. These will be discussed in the following sections. 
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) 
Many individuals with OCD report experiencing abnormal sensory phe­
nomena and premonitory urges that instigate symptoms. In fact, even 
“cognitive ” obsessions in OCD are known to often contain rich sensory 
features (Porth & Geller, 2018), such as in cases where contamination 
fears and washing compulsions are brought on, owing to physical sensa­
tions that one’s hands are “dirty” or “greasy ” (Lapidus et al., 2014; Ola­
tunji et al., 2007; Shapira et al., 2003; Stein et al., 2001). Explicit sensory 
experiences and urges that occur outside of cognitive obsessions are 
described in a variety of ways, including “not just right” experiences 
(Coles et al., 2003; Diniz et al., 2006; Ecker & Gönner, 2008; Ghisi et al., 
2010; Leckman et al., 1994; Lee et al., 2009; Moretz & McKay, 2009; 
Summers et al., 2014), feelings of “incompleteness ” (Ecker & Gönner, 
2008; Ghisi et al., 2010; Pietrefesa & Coles, 2009; Pitman, 1987; Sum­
merfeldt, 2004), and somatic urges for action (da Silva Prado et al., 2008; 
Ferrao et al., 2012; Miguel et al., 2000). “Not just right” experiences 
(NJREs) reﬂect an inner feeling that something is wrong, uncertain, or not 
under control, which must be corrected. “Incompleteness ” experiences are 
similar to NJREs, often reﬂecting an inner feeling that something is wrong 
and that one must perform a compulsion or ritual until achieving a sense 
of completion (Pietrefesa & Coles, 2009; Pitman, 1987). Premonitory 
urges in OCD come in many forms and resemble those from CTDs, 
having been described as aversive bodily sensations (e.g., tension) or 
energy surges (da Silva Prado et al., 2008; Ferrao et al., 2012; Miguel et 
al., 2000; Rosario et al., 2009). These diﬀerent types of sensory and/or 
urge phenomena are often referred to interchangeably. Although NJREs 
are common among non-clinical, healthy individuals (Coles et al., 2003; 
Ghisi et al., 2010) and are found in non-OCRD pathologies such as 
anxiety disorders (Fergus, 2014), most evidence suggests a strong rela­
tionship between NJREs and OCD (Cervin et al., 2020; Coles et al., 2003; 
Sica et al., 2015; Summers et al., 2014). Indeed, one study found that 
NJREs were the strongest feature diﬀerentiating youth with OCD from

Sensory Dysregulation in Obsessive-Compulsive-Related Disorders 81 
youth with anxiety disorders (Cervin et al., 2021). There is mixed data 
regarding the prevalence of NJREs and similar sensory phenomena in 
adult OCD patients (Ghisi et al., 2010; Leckman et al., 1994; Shavitt et 
al., 2014; Sibrava et al., 2016). However, some evidence suggests NJREs 
are more common in childhood OCD than adult-onset OCD (Ferrao et 
al., 2012). It is important to note that OCD patients are signiﬁcantly 
bothered by sensory-related obsessions and premonitory urges, as many 
report greater distress and impairment from these experiences as com­
pared to cognitive obsessions and compulsive behaviors (da Silva Prado et 
al., 2008; Ferrao et al., 2012). 
Chronic Tic Disorders (CTD) 
As previously mentioned, premonitory urges are widely recognized as impor­
tant contributors to CTDs. Evidence shows that most CTD patients (~90 
percent) report some type of premonitory urge experience, however children 
report urges less frequently (Leckman et al., 1993) and the prevalence of urges 
increases with age (Sambrani et al., 2016) (discussed later in Chapter). The 
urge often occurs in the same body area as the tic it precedes, but they can be 
felt as generalized across the whole body (Miguel et al., 1995). A signiﬁcant 
portion of persons with CTDs also report NJREs and feelings of incomple­
teness, with estimates ranging between 30–90 percent (Leckman et al., 1994; 
Miguel et al., 2000; Neal & Cavanna, 2013). 
Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors (BFRBs) 
Tracing back to early behavior analytic studies in youth, BFRBs have 
long been understood to be trigge red by sensory experiences and 
maintained by sensory feedback (Miltenberger et al., 1998; Rapp et 
al., 1999; Williams et al., 2007). Sensory cues for hair pulling and 
skin picking include visual and tactile sensations, such as undesired 
colors (e.g., coarse hairs, blemishes) or other aesthetic qualities (e.g., 
rough skin imperfections or “out of place ” hair) (Grant et al., 2007; 
Mansueto et al., 1997; Snorrason et al., 2015; Snorrason et al., 2019; 
Snorrason et al., 2010; Wilhelm & Margraf, 1993). Additionally, a 
recent study documented heightene d incompleteness experiences in 
persons with skin picking disorder (Ricketts et al., 2021). Upon 
symptom completion, most individuals report experiencing a sense of 
pleasure, gratiﬁcation, or relief (Bohne et al., 2005; Christenson et al., 
1991; Keuthen et al., 2000; Meunier et al., 2009; Tucker et al., 2011; 
Woods et al., 2006). Our understanding of premonitory urge phe­
nomena in BFRBs is limited, particularly in children. However, case 
reports show that aﬀected youth experience urge phenomena (Pinto et 
al., 2017; Swedo & Rapoport, 1991), and the incidence of aﬀected 
youth reporting urge phenomena appears to increase with age (Panza

82 Houghton 
et al., 2013; Schumer et al., 2015) until the experience is nearly uni­
versal (~80 percent) in aﬀected adults (Dieringer et al., 2019). 
Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) 
BDD is a characterized by a disruption of healthy body image wherein 
aﬀected individuals obsess over a perceived ﬂaw in their physical 
appearance and engage in compulsive rituals designed to disguise or 
eliminate the perceived ﬂaw (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, 
make-up application, reassurance seeking). BDD typically onsets during 
early adolescence (Phillips et al., 2005), coinciding with devel­
opmentally appropriate increases in interest toward sexual attraction 
and body aesthetics. Urges to engage in appearance checking or mod­
iﬁcation have not been identiﬁed in BDD, but persons with BDD do 
exhibit visual abnormalities related to distortions of self-perception (Li 
et al., 2013). BDD has also been associated with NJREs and feelings 
of incompleteness. A study by Summers and colleagues found that (a) 
persons with BDD experience more severe NJREs than healthy indivi­
duals; (b) there is a positive correlation between severity of incomple­
teness/NJREs and BDD symptoms; and (c) physiological reactivity in 
response to a task designed to elicit body concerns was positively cor­
related with incompleteness severity (Summers et al., 2017). Further­
more, that research group found that individuals with BDD exhibit 
greater discomfort than healthy controls when exposed to appearance-
related (i.e., drawing of a man with crooked facial features) and non­
appearance-related visual NJRE stimuli (i.e., a cluttered table). 
Health Anxiety Disorder 
Health anxiety disorder (HAD) is characterized by persistent preoccupa­
tion with bodily sensations, which are deemed abnormal or pathogenic, 
and a resulting conviction that one has or might have a serious medical 
problem. Very little research has been conducted on HAD in youth, but 
the disorder certainly aﬀects persons across the lifespan (Wright & 
Asmundson, 2003). Urge phenomena have not been documented in HAD. 
However, studies have consistently linked HAD to excessive focus on and 
misinterpretation of bodily sensations, with aﬀected persons experiencing 
normal body sensations as more intense or more aversive than healthy 
individuals (Barsky & Klerman, 1983). Theorists have speculated that the 
somatic ampliﬁcation of body signals in BDD is due to misattribution (i. 
e., stomach tension being misinterpreted as pain), or cognitive biases 
toward illness. However, there may also be some perceptual abnormality 
that supports ampliﬁcation of body signals in HAD.

Sensory Dysregulation in Obsessive-Compulsive-Related Disorders 83 
Altered Sensation and Perception in OCRDs 
Interoception 
Interoception refers to the process by which one detects, integrates, and 
interprets internal body sensations (Craig, 2002; Khalsa et al., 2018; Tsakiris 
& Critchley, 2016). Appropriate awareness of body sensations is critical for 
maintaining homeostasis as well as selecting and executing adaptive beha­
viors. Indeed, interoceptive dysfunction is thought to exert widespread nega­
tive eﬀects on a variety of psychological processes such as attention, decision-
making, and emotion (Craig, 2002). In children, abnormally increased car­
diac sensitivity has been linked to anxiety symptoms (Eley et al., 2004), while 
decreased cardiac sensitivity has been linked to obesity and picky eating 
(Koch & Pollatos, 2014; Mata et al., 2015). Research has furthermore docu­
mented a range of abnormal interoceptive processes across psychiatric 
populations that overlap and co-occur with OCRDs, including autism spec­
trum disorder, attention-de ﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder, feeding and eating 
disorders, and oppositional deﬁant disorder (Brewer et al., 2021; Gourley et 
al., 2013; Pollatos et al., 2008). 
In OCRDs, a vast majority of research has been conducted in adults, but 
interoceptive abnormalities have been reported consistently. Objective 
investigations using heartbeat detection tasks and similar methods have 
consistently found reduced interoceptive accuracy across OCRDs (Barsky et 
al., 1995; Demartini et al., 2021; Ganos et al., 2015; Krautwurst et al., 2014; 
Krautwurst et al., 2016; Kunstman et al., 2016; Lazarov et al., 2014; Pile et 
al., 2018; Pratt, 2014; Rae et al., 2019; Schultchen et al., 2019; Tyrer et al., 
1980). Obsessive-compulsive traits in non-clinical populations have also 
been linked to reduced propensity to utilize interoceptive signals to gauge 
arousal (Lazarov et al., 2010), suggesting OCRDs may be associated with 
deﬁcient interoceptive accuracy and increased reliance on external proxies. 
In contrast, research generally indicates that persons with OCRDs appraise 
bodily sensations as overly intense or threatening (Deacon & Abramowitz, 
2006; Eng et al., 2020), with self-report studies documenting perceived 
increases in interoceptive sensitivity in OCD (Eng et al., 2020; Jokic´ & Puric´, 
2021), CTD (Eddy et al., 2014; Rae et al., 2019), BFRBs (Teng et al., 2002; 
Woods et al., 1996), BDD (Grunewald et al., 2023), and HAD (Krautwurst 
et al., 2016). These ﬁndings suggest that certain, danger-related interoceptive 
signals may be exaggerated in OCRDs, owing possibly to hyperarousal and/ 
or fear-related attentional bias. 
Exteroception 
The perception of environmental stimuli, or exteroception, has received 
less attention than interoception for its role in OCRDs and other child 
psychopathologies. Still, extant data generally indicate that some children

84 Houghton 
exhibit markedly elevated reactivity to and avoidance of benign environ­
mental stimuli (e.g., sock seams, perfumes) (Dunn & Westman, 1997). 
Children who exhibit sensory hypersensitivity appear to have elevated risk 
for psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety disorders, attentional dis­
orders, and disruptive behavior disorders (Andersson et al., 2008; Bar-
Shalita et al., 2008; Conelea et al., 2014; Gourley et al., 2013; Gouze et 
al., 2009; Keuler et al., 2011; Perez-Robles et al., 2013). However, there is 
at least one conﬂicting report showing no association between childhood 
sensory abnormalities and psychopathology (Van Hulle et al., 2012). 
Similar to ﬁndings related to self-reported interoception, research has 
consistently revealed self-reported increases in sensitivity to external sti­
muli in OCRDs including OCD (Ben-Sasson & Podoly, 2017; Cervin, 
2023; Dar et al., 2012; Lewin et al., 2015; Rieke & Anderson, 2009), 
CTDs (Cohen & Leckman, 1992; Isaacs et al., 2020; Ludlow & Wilkins, 
2016; Soler et al., 2019), BFRBs (Falkenstein et al., 2018; Houghton et 
al., 2018), and HAD (Barsky & Wyshak, 1990; Barsky et al., 1990). To 
my knowledge, no study has examined external sensory sensitivity in 
BDD, but there is evidence of enhanced aesthetic sensitivity and atten­
tion to detail (Kaplan et al., 2013; Madsen et al., 2013). There also 
appears to be a high degree of overlap between emergent conditions 
characterized by sensory intolerance (e.g., Misophonia, “Sensory Proces­
sing Disorder ”) and OCRDs, as studies have documented elevated rates 
of OCRDs among samples of patients with sensory intolerance (Smith et 
al., 2022; Taylor et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014), including among child­
hood samples (Van Hulle et al., 2019). Yet, investigations of external 
sensory sensitivity utilizing objective measurement tools largely mirror 
those from investigations of interoceptive sensitivity. Several studies 
found no evidence of abnormal sensory thresholds in OCRDs (Barsky et 
al., 1995; Belluscio et al., 2011; Güçlü et al., 2015; Haenen et al., 2010; 
Puts et al., 2015) or altered pain thresholds/tolerance (Blum et al., 2017; 
Grant et al., 2017; Lautenbacher et al., 1998). However, a minority of 
studies have reported anomalous ﬁndings such as decreased tactile 
detection thresholds in BFRBs (Houghton et al., 2019) and HAD (Rodic 
et al., 2016), poor olfaction in OCD (Segalas et al., 2011) and CTD 
(Kronenbuerger et al., 2018), as well as increased physiologic reactivity 
and slow habituation to aversive external stimulation in OCD (Janik et 
al., 2018; Podoly et al., 2022). 
Models of sensory dysregulation in OCRDs 
Currently available evidence shows that symptoms of OCRDs are fre­
quently maintained by sensory phenomena such as premonitory urges, 
that persons with OCRDs perceive themselves to be abnormally sensitive 
to interoceptive and exteroceptive signals, but that there is little evidence 
for objective physiological sensory abnormalities. Given these mixed

Sensory Dysregulation in Obsessive-Compulsive-Related Disorders 85 
ﬁndings, it is presently unclear whether abnormal sensory experiences in 
OCRDs are functionally signiﬁcant and related to a causal etiologic 
mechanism. However, there are several promising explanations for various 
sensory phenomena in OCRDs, which collectively point to disruptions in 
sensory processing and integration between top-down cognitive inﬂuences 
and bottom-up sensory aﬀerents. 
Sensory Gating 
Although few studies have identiﬁ ed objective sensory abnormalities in 
OCRDs such as reduced detection thresholds or heightened interoceptive 
awareness, research has consistently identiﬁ ed one objective sensory deﬁcit 
among OCRDs. Sensory gating is an adaptive process in which some 
sensory information is selectively inhibited before reaching conscious 
awareness, which is believed to sharpen perception, conserve attentional 
resources, and enhance focus on relevant sensory information while miti­
gating background noise. Indeed, the peripheral nervous system has an 
immense sum of sensory receptors that are rarely, if ever, at complete rest, 
meaning they are constantly conveying aﬀerent sensory messages to the 
brain. The brain then must decipher information from torrents of aﬀerent 
sensory inputs that occur in complex temporal patterns. If some ﬁltering 
of sensory inputs did not occur, one would be overwhelmed with cascades 
of mostly irrelevant information, which would likely impede perception, 
attention, cognitive operations, and adaptive behavior. Furthermore, 
adaptive sensory gating appears to mature as children age (Davies et al., 
2009), suggesting that developmental adversities may hinder gating eﬃ­
ciency and increase risk for psychopathology. 
Faulty sensory gating has been closely tied to psychotic-spectrum dis­
orders (McGhie & Chapman, 1961; Patterson et al., 2008), attentional 
disorders (Micoulaud-Franchi et al., 2019; Micoulaud-Franchi et al., 
2015), as well as “sensory processing disorders” (SPDs) (Davies et al., 
2009). SPDs are a purported childhood-onset disorder characterized by 
excessive (or reduced) exteroceptive sensitivity (Houghton et al., 2020) 
(discussed below). Reduced gating has also been documented in OCRDs, 
including OCD (Hashimoto et al., 2008; Rossi et al., 2005; Xiao et al., 
2010), CTDs (Castellanos et al., 1996; Swerdlow et al., 2001; Zebardast 
et al., 2013), BFRBs (Houghton et al., 2019), and BDD (Giannopoulos 
et al., 2021; Kapsali et al., 2020). No research has yet linked sensory 
gating to HAD, but experts have posited a role for deﬁcient gating 
among persons with HAD and similar somatoform disorders (Boutros & 
Peters, 2012). Impaired sensory gating may contribute to symptoms of 
OCRDs by allowing excessive irrelevant sensory aﬀerent information to 
reach conscious awareness, which results in feelings of over-inundation (i. 
e., hypersensitivity) and diﬃculty habituating to stimulation. Over-
stimulation does tend to elicit compensatory behaviors designed to

86 Houghton 
distract from aversive inputs and replace such discomforts with more 
pleasurable stimuli (Dunn, 2001), and others have suggested that faulty 
sensory gating could disrupt action selection and suppression of unwan­
ted behaviors (Koziol et al., 2011). 
Models of premonitory urges 
Substantial evidence indicates that premonitory urges are governed by 
activity in limbic sensory and motor areas, speciﬁcally the insular and 
cingulate cortices (Jackson et al., 2011). Indeed, Jackson and colleagues 
demonstrated that neural substrates of premonitory urges in CTDs align 
closely with those of normal urges for action from our everyday lives (e.g., 
urge to yawn). The role of the insula in generating urges for action, as well 
as pathological urges to engage in compulsive behavior, was most clearly 
demonstrated in a study that found insula lesions among nicotine addicts 
were associated with a complete elimination of the urge to smoke (Naqvi 
& Bechara, 2009; Naqvi et al., 2007). Unfortunately, this neurobiological 
account for premonitory urges fails to explain the development of pre­
monitory urges in OCRDs. 
Behavioral models of the development of premonitory urges are gen­
erally based on the notion that tension reduction, or negative reinforce­
ment, maintains the urge-tic relationship. This is generally supported by 
reinforced tic suppression studies in which tic rate increases when urges 
are strong, urge strength increases during tic suppression, and urge 
strength attenuates during free-to-tic conditions (Brandt et al., 2016; 
Houghton et al., 2014; Langelage et al., 2022). However, the negative 
reinforcement hypothesis does not account for the fact that premonitory 
urges are not always present when tics ﬁrst emerge in childhood (Sam­
brani et al., 2016; Woods et al., 2005). Tic typically onset around ages 6– 
7, whereas awareness of premonitory urges can emerge up to three years 
after tic onset (Banaschewski et al., 2003; Leckman et al., 1993). Woods 
and colleagues proposed that urges may be present in young children with 
CTDs, but that younger children cannot reliably notice and describe the 
urge experience (Woods et al., 2005). This is supported by research 
showing that interoceptive abilities typically do not fully develop until the 
ages of 5.8–7.8 years (Sigmundsson et al., 2000). Indeed, recent ﬁndings 
suggest that 80–95 percent of children with CTDs experience some degree 
of a premonitory urge experience (Openneer et al., 2020). Because sensory 
experiences can be made conscious or more salient through learning 
(Cameron, 2001), perhaps the sequelae of tics (e.g., change in proprio­
ception, distraction, pain, teasing) provide the feedback necessary to 
increase awareness toward private sensations that precede tics. Upon 
becoming aware that some internal sensation exists prior to the tic, the 
urge then transitions from a benign experience with no functional sig­
niﬁcance to one that is functionally linked to the tic and tic-related

Sensory Dysregulation in Obsessive-Compulsive-Related Disorders 87 
consequences (e.g., discomfort, distraction, teasing). Finally, just as other 
benign stimuli can acquire aversive valence when such stimuli predict a 
negative outcome (Kamin et al., 1963; Rescorla & Solomon, 1967), the 
urge then acquires an aversive valence, and escape from the urge becomes 
reinforcing. This conceptualization is supported by studies showing that 
premonitory urges are associated with neural activation of regions 
involved in negative aﬀect and punishment-based learning (Wang et al., 
2011), as well as data showing that urge severity is associated with indices 
of functional and social impairment (Woods et al., 2005) and peer victi­
mization (Zinner et al., 2012). 
Taken together, premonitory urges for compulsive behaviors may be 
universally present as signals of impending action, but as compulsive 
behavior symptoms become intrusive and individuals attempt to predict 
and suppress such actions, urges acquire aversive valence and become 
functionally tied to symptoms. Premonitory urges can thus be considered 
“normal ”, in that they mirror common urges for action, but only because 
they signal the emergence of undesired symptoms do they acquire aversive 
valence. In the next section, the process through which benign inter­
oceptive signals can intensify and become aversive is discussed. 
The “alliesthesia” and somatosensory ampliﬁcation models 
Some have suggested that abnormal sensory experiences in OCRDs could 
be caused by a pathogenic integration between higher-order cognitive 
processes and lower-order perceptual aﬀerents (Paulus & Stein, 2010). 
Speciﬁcally, Paulus and Stein argued that fear-based disorders (e.g., anxi­
ety, OCD, BDD, HAD) are characterized by negatively biased internal 
cognitive models that facilitate hypervigilance to potential threats (Stein & 
Nesse, 2011), translating to hyper-attention toward sensory stimuli that 
may signal danger. Similarly, persistent hypervigilance to threat appears 
to be tied to evolutionary processes related to early threat detection and 
precautionary responses. By means of a process known as alliesthesia 
(Cabanac, 1971), the internal condition of an individual is intertwined 
with external stimuli that impact the internal environment, causing stimuli 
to acquire an emotional signiﬁcance based on their perceived pleasantness 
or unpleasantness. The central and peripheral nervous systems of the 
body continuously transmit a stream of noisy and unclear sensory inputs 
that require integration and interpretation. Individuals who are vigilant 
for threats tend to perceive stimuli with negative emotional impact as 
more intense, as these stimuli could potentially indicate danger. Coupled 
with faulty sensory gating and an increase in the amount of irrelevant 
information reaching conscious awareness, aﬀected persons may con­
stantly struggle to interpret the threat relevance of various ambiguous 
suprathreshold stimuli. Consequently, ambiguous stimuli have the poten­
tial to trigger anxious catastrophizing, whereby a seemingly harmless

88 Houghton 
sensory encounter (e.g., a buzzing noise) is perceived as unusually intense 
or even catastrophic (e.g., “There might be a swarm of bees in this 
room! ”). 
Perhaps this model could be extended beyond the mischaracterization 
of threat-related stimuli in anxiety/OCD/HAD/BDD and into other 
OCRDs such as BFRBs and CTDs. Indeed, arguments have been made 
for the role of alliesthesia, threat prediction, and reward anticipation in 
similar compulsive behavior disorders, drug addiction. Paulus and Stew­
art (Paulus & Stewart, 2014) argued that persons with substance use 
disorders encounter an “embodied ” experience, similar to craving, that is 
subserved by frequent errors between their predicted versus actual body 
state (e.g., “elated ” versus “tense”). Furthermore, an innovative study 
utilizing a bayesian computational model of neurophysiological data 
from individuals with various psychopathologies (i.e., anxiety, depression, 
substance use disorders, and eating disorders) found increased inter­
oceptive error rates across all pathologies as compared to controls during 
interoceptive challenge (a combined breath-holding and heartbeat-count­
ing task) (Smith et al., 2020). It could therefore be that compulsive tics 
and BFRBs are associated with a similar interoceptive reward-prediction 
error, speciﬁcally related to proprioceptive, visceral, and dermatological 
sensations. 
Unfortunately, the models proposed by Paulus and colleagues have been 
concerned with interoception and do not deliver an account of exter­
oceptive hypersensitivity. Yet, from the perspective of health anxiety and 
similar unexplained medical symptom disorders (i.e., conversion disorder, 
somatization disorders, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures), experts have 
explored how the intensity of both internal and external sensory experi­
ences can be ampliﬁed, even in the absence of objective diﬀerences in 
sensory thresholds (Barsky & Wyshak, 1990; Köteles & Witthöft, 2017). 
Somatosensory ampliﬁcation refers to the notion that a combination of 
body hypervigilance and strong emotional reactivity to sensation can 
result in the intensi ﬁcation of certain sensory experiences. This concept 
shares many similarities with other models of medically unexplained 
symptoms such as central sensitization in chronic pain. Because external 
stimuli can aﬀect the internal milieu, it stands to reason that certain 
environmental exposures (i.e., a strange smell) can trigger health worries 
and undergo ampliﬁcation. This has important theoretical implications for 
emerging conditions that overlap with OCRDs, namely SPDs and “idio­
pathic environmental intolerances ” (IEI). As has been discussed in other 
reviews (Houghton et al., 2020), children with sensory processing disorders 
almost universally express elevated symptoms of OCRDs and anxiety, 
thus suggesting that environmental hypersensitivity in sensory processing 
disorders could result from top-down ampliﬁcation of sensory inputs. 
Likewise, controversial conditions characterized by IEI such as mis­
ophonia (selective sound sensitivity), multiple chemical (olfactory)

Sensory Dysregulation in Obsessive-Compulsive-Related Disorders 89 
sensitivity, and electromagnetic sensitivity share many characteristics with 
OCRDs and could potentially be conceptualized under this model. Sup­
port for this notion comes from data indicating that top-down belief sys­
tems signiﬁcantly inﬂuence IEI symptom expression. For example, in 
persons with purported electromagnetic sensitivity, their actual exposure to 
electromagnetism does not inﬂuence symptom severity (Rubin et al., 
2010), but perceived electromagnetism exposure does inﬂuence symptoms 
(Szemerszky et al., 2015; Witthöft & Rubin, 2013) 
Issues for further investigation 
This chapter has provided evidence for premonitory urge phenomena as 
well as subjective increases in sensitivity to interoceptive and exteroceptive 
stimuli. I also discussed several preliminary models for sensory dysregula­
tion in OCRDs. Yet, this area of research is still early stages, with many 
unanswered questions and untested assumptions. The following sections 
will detail several important avenues for further research. 
Sensory processing disorders? 
As discussed previously and in other reports (Houghton et al., 2020), 
researchers and clinicians have increasingly argued for the existence of 
SPDs. These conditions are not recognized by DSM-5 and ICD-11, and it 
is presently unclear whether these conditions represent valid diagnoses or 
are best conceptualized as symptom clusters that often co-occur with 
anxiety-related pathologies and autistic traits. For instance, many children 
exhibit select hypersensitivities and strong responses to certain stimuli (e. 
g., food textures, smells, clothing material), which do not necessarily 
impair functioning and may vanish with age. However, there is some evi­
dence that children with SPDs have objective sensory abnormalities (Bar-
Shalita et al., 2009; McIntosh et al., 1999; Schaaf et al., 2003), potentially 
supporting the validity of SPD as a unique pathology. However, other 
research points to symptoms of SPDs in children as representing early risk 
factors for anxiety disorders and related pathologies (Carpenter et al., 
2019). For example, a longitudinal twin study in 1,613 children found that 
the number of tactile or auditory sensory over-responsivity symptoms was 
positively correlated with likelihood of OCD diagnoses (Van Hulle et al., 
2019). 
In order to signiﬁcantly advance research on SPDs and their relation­
ships with OCRDs, future studies ought to take certain steps to maximize 
impact and interpretability. First, it is crucial that scientists establish 
consensus in deﬁning the core constructs of sensory psychopathology. 
Once clear deﬁnitions of pathological sensory constructs (e.g., “sensory 
over-responsivity ”) and the diagnostic validity of sensory processing dis­
orders have been established, researchers can develop psychometrically

90 Houghton 
valid assessment strategies. Relatedly, future studies ought to utilize both 
subjective and objective assessment methods and clearly diﬀerentiate 
between the two processes. Objective measures of sensory function some­
times align with self-reported perception (Bar-Shalita et al., 2009), but 
this is not always the case (Kozak & Miller, 1982). Careful attention to 
both components of the large sensory processes apparatus should enable 
more precise conclusions regarding the interplay between conscious feel­
ing states, beliefs, physiological responses to stimulation, and behavior. 
Finally, the neurophysiological deﬁcits that purportedly underlie SPDs may 
interact signiﬁcantly with various environmental factors and comorbidities, 
such as physical health (e.g., nutrition), neuroendocrine/hormonal processes, 
motor development, and cognitive and social experiences (i.e., exposure to 
diverse, highly stimulating environments). 
Treatment 
While sensory dysregulation has garnered attention as a potential OCRD 
mechanism, there is little empirical guidance on eﬀective treatments, and 
the limited but existing evidence suggests the need for further reﬁnement 
of existing treatments. There are behavioral treatment strategies aimed at 
children with purported sensory processing disorders, such as “sensory 
integration therapy ”. Unfortunately, sensory integration therapy has not 
undergone rigorous clinical trials, and existing evidence points to ques­
tionable eﬃcacy (Complementary et al., 2012). Cognitive-behavioral 
therapies for OCRDs, which boast considerable empirical support, have 
been investigated regarding eﬀects on patients who exhibit sensory dysre­
gulation. A meta-analysis of CBT for incompleteness symptoms in OCD 
found that incompleteness was modestly improved over the course of 
treatment, with stronger eﬀect sizes noted for treatments that explicitly 
targeted incompleteness (Schwartz, 2018). In contrast, other studies have 
shown that NJREs and incompleteness symptoms are associated with 
poor OCD treatment outcomes (Cervin & Perrin, 2021; Nissen & Parner, 
2018). Given these data, there is a clear need to further investigate the 
eﬃcacy of CBT-based interventions for sensory components of OCRDs. 
There is perhaps room for innovative new treatment methodologies 
that are agnostic to diagnosis but instead aim directly at sensory dysre­
gulation. One example of such an approach is known as Flotation-REST 
(Reduced Environmental Stimulation Therapy), which involves using 
sensory deprivation in a saltwater ﬂoatation chamber to encourage 
mindfulness meditation and relaxation. Early data point to robust 
anxiolytic eﬀects of Flotation-REST (Feinstein et al., 2018), as well as 
improvements in interoceptive awareness (Feinstein et al., 2018) and 
decreased functional connectivity within somatomotor and default mode 
networks (Al Zoubi et al., 2021). Other potential treatment avenues 
include non-invasive neuromodulation, particularly targeting the insula

Sensory Dysregulation in Obsessive-Compulsive-Related Disorders 91 
(Ibrahim et al., 2019). However, preliminary investigation of insular 
neuromodulation via transcranial magnetic stimuli showed treatment-
related decreases in interoceptive accuracy but increases in perceptual 
conﬁdence (Pollatos et al., 2016). It is currently unclear how such treat­
ment eﬀects would translate into OCRD patients and whether approa­
ches that are suitable for adults would exhibit similar eﬃcacy in youth. 
Summary 
Research reviewed in the current chapter demonstrates that symptoms of 
many OCRDs are instigated by sensory phenomena, aﬀected individuals 
exhibit subjective sensory abnormalities, but that sensory abnormalities 
are not necessarily caused by objective sensory deﬁcits. However, there is 
evidence for more subtle sensory gating abnormalities and disrupted sen­
sory integration processes in OCRDs. Taken together, this evidence shows 
that sensory dysregulation is a potentially important component of OCRD 
psychopathology. It is therefore unsurprising that research in this area is 
growing at a rapid pace, and hopefully we will receive signiﬁcant new 
insights that will help develop a more comprehensive understanding of 
how sensory dysregulation interacts with other risk factors and etiological 
mechanisms. Within these eﬀorts, there is a clear need for additional 
research on targeted and innovative treatment approaches for sensory 
aspects of OCRDs. Such research would signiﬁcantly advance our ability 
to provide comprehensive care for individuals with OCRDs and may also 
have signiﬁcant implications for conditions similar to OCRDs that also 
exhibit similar sensory abnormalities (Khalsa et al., 2018).
