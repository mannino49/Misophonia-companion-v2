## Abstract

Misophonia was initially described in 2001 as a specific sensitivity to certain sounds (e.g., chewing, pen clicking). Despite greater recognition of misophonia over the last two decades, the extent of awareness of misophonia in the general public is  unknown. Extensive research emphasizes the importance of public awareness in recognition and treatment of mental disorders and medical conditions. Awareness of misophonia is important for the continued advancement of misophonia research and identification of individuals with misophonia. As an important first step, this study investigated the general public's  understanding  of  misophonia.  Data  were  collected  through  Ipsos  KnowledgePanel,  which  maintains  a  large, probability-based web panel designed to be representative of the United States. Panel members were invited to complete a brief survey, and the final sample was comprised of 4,005 participants (51.5% female). A small portion of individuals (11.3%, n = 451)  recognized  misophonia. A  multivariate  binary  logistic  regression  model  revealed  that  individuals  who were  female,  younger,  White/non-Hispanic,  had  a  Bachelor's  degree  or  higher,  or  reported  an  annual  income  between $75,000 - $99,000 were significantly more likely to endorse misophonia recognition. Most participants who were familiar with  misophonia  reported  an  accurate  understanding  about  misophonia;  yet,  low  level  of  knowledge. The  internet  was most commonly identified as the primary information source. Findings highlight the low level of misophonia awareness among laypersons and emphasize the need to increase public knowledge of misophonia.

## Introduction

significant misophonia symptoms, suggesting that misopho -nia is relatively common.

Misophonia is a disorder characterized by selective sensitiv -ity to certain sounds (e.g., chewing, pen clicking), which are experienced as unpleasant and accompanied by strong nega -tive emotional (e.g., irritation, anxiety), physical (e.g., ten -sion), and behavioral (e.g., avoidance of places) responses (Swedo  et  al.,  2022).  This  sensitivity  has  been  found  to occur  on  a  continuum  and  can  be  associated  with  severe distress and functional impairment. Studies have estimated between 6.0 and 19.9% of college students (Wu et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017) and 4.6-17.7% of the general population (Dixon et al., 2022; Kılıç et al., 2021) experience clinically

The  literature  on  misophonia  has  grown  considerably over the last two decades. The term misophonia was first coined in 2001 (Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff, 2001), and although formal  diagnostic  criteria  have  not  yet  been  established, misophonia has been increasingly identified in clinical set -tings (Jager et al., 2020). Further, research on misophonia has  spanned  the  fields  of  neuroscience,  psychology,  psy -chiatry, and audiology. Beyond recognition in clinical and scientific  communities,  misophonia  has  also  gained  the attention of laypersons through news outlets (e.g., Barrow 2015; Fulton, 2019) and social media (e.g., Newcastle Uni -versity, 2017). Despite this growing recognition, the level of  awareness  of  misophonia  in  the  general  population  is largely unknown, which has significant implications for the advancement of misophonia and patient care.

Extensive research has examined the role of public aware -ness in the recognition and treatment of mental health dis -orders and medical conditions, such as depression (Gabriel

&amp; Violato, 2010; Singh et al., 2019), diabetes (Jackson et al.,  1991),  irritable  bowel  syndrome  (Verne,  2004),  fibro -myalgia (Briones-Vozmediano, 2017), schizophrenia (Picco et al., 2018), dementia (Heger et al., 2019), obsessive-com -pulsive disorder (Picco et al., 2018; Stewart et al., 2019), and  autism  spectrum  disorder  (Dillenburger  et  al.,  2013). Although mental health literacy has improved in Western countries in recent years (Hansson et al., 2016; Robinson &amp; Henderson, 2019), symptoms are often not recognized by laypersons (Akinsulore et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2019; Wu et  al.,  2017)  and misconceptions continue to be pervasive (Angermeyer &amp; Dietrich, 2006; Furnham &amp; Hughes, 2014; Tonsing, 2018). Mental health knowledge and awareness in the general public have been associated with numerous pos -itive outcomes. For example, researchers have found greater awareness increases likelihood of  disclosure  to  friends  or family and employers (Henderson et al., 2017), facilitates help-seeking behaviors (Picco et al., 2018), improves sup -port (Picco et al., 2018), enhances treatment options (Jorm, 2012),  and  predicts  treatment  utilization  (Bonabi  et  al., 2016).  In  addition,  mental  health-related  knowledge  has been shown to enhance acceptance (Henderson et al., 2012) and increase willingness to be in social contact with those struggling from mental health problems (Evans-Lacko et al., 2013)  among laypersons.  In  contrast,  less  knowledge  has been linked to stigmatizing attitudes (Buizza et al., 2017), prejudice (Foster et al., 2018), and delays in assessment and treatment (Thornicroft, 2008).

To  date,  there  are  no  known  studies  on  public  aware -ness of misophonia; however, one relevant study examined university  instructors'  knowledge  of  misophonia.  In  this study,  undergraduate faculty ( N = 686)  responded  to  ques -tions that assessed awareness of misophonia (Porcaro et al., 2019). The results indicated that 18.4% of participants had knowledge  of  misophonia;  yet,  most  of  these  individuals were unable to provide a definition. These findings are the first  to  suggest  that  awareness of misophonia is relatively low - even among those with higher education levels and working in an environment where misophonia may be par -ticularly common and problematic (Wu et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017).

Given the rising interest in misophonia, the investigation of public knowledge of misophonia is critical for informing the next stages of education and advocacy. Increasing public knowledge is critical for facilitating help-seeking behaviors for individuals and within communities. Additionally, wide -spread awareness has the potential to lend to greater avail -ability of resources, changes in public policy, and support for publicly funded research (Entwistle et al., 1998). Conse -quently, the purpose of this study was to further understand the  level  of  misophonia  awareness  in  a  nationally  repre -sentative sample of U.S. adults. First, rates of recognition

of misophonia were examined. In particular, we evaluated the specific role of demographic characteristics in relation to  misophonia  recognition.  Previous  studies  have  demon -strated  certain  demographic  characteristics  are  associated with recognition of mental health disorders; therefore, we hypothesized that younger age (Stewart et al., 2019), White/ non-Hispanic background (Dillenburger et al., 2013; Stew -art  et  al.,  2019),  higher  level  of  education  (Buizza  et  al., 2017; Coles et al., 2013; Dillenburger et al., 2013; Stewart et al., 2019), higher income (Stewart et al., 2019), and living in an urban area (Huang et al., 2019) would be unique pre -dictors of recognition of misophonia. Second, we explored personal  experience  with  misophonia  (self  or  other)  and interest in learning more about misophonia. Lastly, features of misophonia knowledge, such as level of knowledge and information  source,  were  investigated  among  individuals who endorsed prior awareness of misophonia.

## Methods

## Study Design and Sampling

Data  collection  was  conducted  by  Ipsos  KnowledgePanel (KnowledgePanel), which maintains the largest, web-based panel  of  adults  in  the  United  States  (U.S.;  Ipsos  Public Affairs, n.d.). The panel is estimated to include 60,000 mem -bers.  Individuals  are  recruited  using  address-based  sam -pling methodology based on the latest Delivery Sequence File  from  the  U.S.  Postal  Service.  This  probability-based sampling includes all known households and facilitates the recruitment  of  a  nationally  representative  sample,  includ -ing hard-to-reach individuals. For instance, individuals who do not have access to the internet are provided with a webenabled device. Individuals agree to be a part of the panel and receive invitations to complete individual surveys. Par -ticipation  in  surveys  is  voluntary,  and  a  modest  incentive program  is  used  to  encourage  ongoing  participation  as  a panel  member.  Consent  is  implicit  in  the  completion  and return of the survey.

In addition to the aforementioned procedures that Knowl -edgePanel uses to secure and maintain a nationally repre -sentative sample, KnowledgePanel uses sample weighting to further ensure that samples are representative of the U.S. population.  Study-specific  post-stratification  weights  are applied  to  survey  data  based  on  geodemographic  bench -marks from the latest U.S. Census Bureau's Current Popu -lation Survey. This weight process included gender by age group, race/ethnicity, census region, education, and house -hold income. This weighting addresses any potential overor undersampling of certain subgroups and yields a reliable estimate that reflects the parameters of the U.S. population.

## Participants

A total of 6,688 individuals were invited to complete this survey,  and  the  final  sample  included  4,005  individu -als  (59.9% response rate). Approximately half the sample was  female  (51.5%)  and  the  mean  age  was  48.32  years ( SD = 17.76). Weighted  demographic  characteristics  are reported in Table 1.

## Procedure

The questions developed for the current study were included in a larger project investigating the prevalence of misophonia in the general population (Dixon et al., 2022). The survey was administered to randomly selected Knowl -edgePanel members aged 18 and older residing in the U.S.

A pretest of the survey items was conducted in January of 2022, and the survey was conducted between January 21, 2022 and February 6, 2022.

Demographic characteristics  were  recorded  by  Knowl -edgePanel,  and  participants  responded  to  up  to  seven questions that evaluated  awareness  and  knowledge  of misophonia. First, recognition of the term misophonia was assessed ('Prior to this survey, had you heard of the term misophonia?'). Next, participants received a brief definition of misophonia based on the consensus definition (Swedo et al., 2022 ):

Misophonia  is  a  disorder  of  decreased  tolerance  to specific  sounds  (e.g.,  chewing,  slurping,  breathing, pen  clicking,  typing)  or  stimuli  associated  with  the sounds (e.g., visual triggers). Sounds are experienced as unpleasant or distressing and tend to evoke strong negative  emotional  (e.g.,  anger,  anxiety),  physical (e.g.,  tension,  sweating),  and  behavioral  (e.g.,  agita -tion,  avoidance)  responses.  These  intense  negative reactions are not seen in most other people and may contribute  to  suffering,  distress,  and/or  life  impair -ment.  This  disorder  can  be  present  in  people  with or  without  normal  hearing,  and  symptoms  are  not explained by other disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

This definition was provided to ensure that participants had an accurate definition of misophonia and could respond to the subsequent questions. Following this information, per -sonal experience with misophonia was evaluated by assess -ing if they identified as having misophonia (yes/no) or knew someone who had misophonia (yes/no). In addition, partici -pants rated their interest in learning more about misophonia on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 'very uninterested' to 'very interested.'

Participants who initially endorsed that they had heard of misophonia received three additional questions to further assess misophonia knowledge. With regard to the provided definition of misophonia, participants were asked 'does this description match your understanding of misophonia?' and could respond 'yes', 'no', 'somewhat', or 'did not have an understanding of misophonia.' Next, level of familiar -ity  or  knowledge  of  misophonia  was  rated  on  a  5-point Likert-type  scale  from  'not  at  all  familiar'  to  'extremely familiar'.  Lastly,  participants  were  asked  to  identify  their primary source of information on misophonia, and several options were listed, including personal experience (e.g., self or someone I know), media (e.g., news article, television, TV, radio), social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok),  health  education  (e.g.,  school,  workshops),  doc -tor or healthcare provider (e.g., audiologist, mental health),

## Data analyses

All data analyses were conducted using SPSS version 27.0 and included the aforementioned KnowledgePanel sample weights  (Ipsos  Public  Affairs,  n.d.).  First,  demographic and survey response frequencies were examined. Second, responses to misophonia recognition were characterized in terms of demographic characteristics. Third, multiple binary logistic  regression  analyses  were  conducted  to  examine the separate and unique roles of demographic characteris -tics  in  predicting  recognition  of  misophonia.  To  examine the  effects  of  demographic  characteristics  on  recognition of  misophonia,  each  demographic  variable  (age,  gender, race/ethnicity,  education,  household  income,  metropolitan area) was entered separately into a binary logistic regres -sion model. Then, all demographic variables were simulta -neously entered into one binary logistic regression model. In these models, age was a continuous variable, gender and metropolitan status were binary variables, and race/ethnic -ity,  education, and income were categorical variables. For each categorical variable, simple contrasts were conducted with the first reference group. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported for the binary logistic regression models. Alpha was set to p &lt; .05  and all results were  2-tailed.  Finally,  descriptive  statistics  were  used  to explore frequencies of the following items: personal expe -rience with misophonia (self or other), interest in learning more about misophonia, understanding of misophonia, level of misophonia knowledge, and primary source of misopho -nia information.

## Results

## Misophonia Recognition

In this sample, 11.3% of individuals indicated that they had heard of misophonia (misophonia recognition). In Table 2, recognition of misophonia is characterized by demographic category. Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that several demographic factors were associated with recogni -tion of misophonia (see Table 3). Younger age and female gender  significantly  increased  the  likelihood  of  misopho -nia recognition. Consistent with prediction, the likelihood of misophonia recognition was significantly higher among White  individuals,  individuals  with  at  least  a  Bachelor's degree,  and  certain  higher  level  income  groups.  With regard to income, individuals with a household income of $75,000 - $99,000 or ≥ $150,000 were more likely to rec -ognize misophonia compared to individuals with a house -hold income less than $25,000. In the multivariate model, these factors continued to be significantly associated with

misophonia recognition, with the exception of the income level ≥ $150,000 group. Contrary to prediction, metropoli -tan status was not associated with misophonia recognition in either model.

See  Table  4  for  a  summary  of  responses.  Although  only 11.3% of the sample had heard of the term misophonia, a total of 16.6% reported personal contact with someone with misophonia  (13.2%)  or  identified  as  having  misophonia (7.5%). Further examination of these results indicated a dis -crepancy between the number of participants who reported recognition of misophonia and personal contact with miso -phonia. Of participants who initially denied recognition of the term misophonia ( n = 3,547), 5.6% reported they iden -tified  as  having  misophonia  and  10.3%  reported  knowing someone with  misophonia. Thus,  a  total  of  22.9%  of  the sample endorsed misophonia recognition  or  awareness  of misophonia in their personal life after receiving information about misophonia. Lastly, in terms of interest level, 22.1% of  the  sample indicated they had at least some interest in learning more about misophonia or were neutral (32.1%).

## Features of Misophonia Knowledge

Data  on  misophonia  knowledge  among  individuals  who recognized  misophonia  ( n = 451)  are  reported  in  Table  5. Of  these  individuals,  83.6%  indicated  that  the  consensus definition matched  their understanding  of misophonia.

Varying degrees of familiarity  or  knowledge  of  misopho -nia  were  reported,  with  most  participants  reporting  they were  'slightly'  familiar  (45.3%)  or  'somewhat'  familiar (28.3%).  Regarding  participants'  primary  source  of  infor -mation on misophonia, the most common source was the internet, such as Google or Wikipedia (32.3%), followed by personal experiences (19.9%), media outlets (13.2%; e.g., news article, radio), health education (11.4%; e.g., school), and social media (6.8%). Interestingly, a small portion of the sample identified misophonia-specific materials (6.3%; e.g., misophonia website) or health care professionals (4.7%) as the primary source of information.

## Discussion

This is the first study to evaluate misophonia awareness and knowledge in a representative sample of adults in the U.S. The results provide an initial foundation for understanding the  level  of  misophonia  awareness  and  knowledge  in  the general  population,  which  is  a  critical  step  for  advancing research and facilitating the identification and treatment of individuals with misophonia.

Overall,  a  small  portion  of  the  full  sample  reported recognition  of  misophonia.  Several  demographic  factors

1

were significantly associated with misophonia recognition, including  gender,  age,  race/ethnicity,  education  level,  and household income. In this study, there was a significantly higher likelihood of recognition of misophonia among indi -viduals  who  were  female,  younger,  White/non-Hispanic, or had a Bachelor's degree education or higher. Moreover, these factors continued to be significant predictors of miso -phonia  recognition  when  simultaneously  entered  into  the same  model.  Similar  findings  were  observed  by  Stewart and colleagues (2019) in a study investigating recognition of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Specifically, par -ticipants more frequently endorsed that they had heard of OCD,  if  they  were  younger,  White/Caucasian  (vs.  ethnic minority), had a college education, or had an income greater than $60,000. However, unlike this study, higher levels of income were not uniformly predictive of misophonia rec -ognition in the current study. In the full model, those in the middle household income category of $75,000 - $99,999, had a 57.3% greater likelihood of recognizing misophonia compared to the reference group ( &lt; $25,000).

Unexpectedly, metropolitan status was not a significant predictor,  which  is  inconsistent  with  research  showing significantly  lower  recognition  of  mental  health  disorders (Huang et al., 2019) and limited access to health information (Chen et al., 2019) in rural areas. One possible explanation is that research shows that the internet and social media are common sources for health and medical information (Hesse et al., 2005), which improves access of information. How -ever, quality of information warrants consideration as phy -sicians are rated as the most trusted sources of information among patients (Hesse et al., 2005), and low health literacy has been associated with high rates of using social media or  celebrity  blogs/webpages  for  health  information  (Chen et al., 2018). Given that individuals in rural areas have less access to specialists (Chen et al., 2019), additional research is recommended to identify potential disparities in misopho -nia (mis)information between rural and urban areas.

Altogether,  these  data  provide  further  support  for  the link between demographic characteristics and mental health awareness. In terms of implications, these findings suggest that awareness campaigns may need to deploy specific strat -egies to reach groups with lower recognition of misophonia, such as men, older adults, ethnic minority groups, high and low  household  incomes,  and  lower  education  levels.  Pre -vious research suggests these groups are often affected by health disparities, and factors such as public stigma and low mental health literacy are significant barriers to  treatment (Kantor et al., 2017) across these sociodemographic groups, including  minorities  (Pérez-Flores  &amp;  Cabassa,  2021)  and older adults (Lavingia et al., 2020). Consequently, the next steps of increasing awareness should consider specific strat -egies  for  engaging  these  groups.  For  instance,  partnering

with key community figures for the development of cultur -ally-sensitive  community-focused campaigns can increase knowledge  and  positive  beliefs  about  mental  health  dis -orders  and  treatment  options  (Abotsie  et  al.,  2020;  Jorm, 2012). Additional work is needed to apply the literature base on increasing mental health awareness to misophonia.

In terms of our exploratory analyses, 13.2% of the full sample  reported  knowing  someone  with  misophonia  and 7.5% identified as having misophonia based on the defini -tion of misophonia. These results are not diagnostic; how -ever, they illustrate that upon receiving information about misophonia, a small portion of individuals connected these symptoms  to  someone  in  their  life.  This  knowledge  may represent an important first step as awareness of symptoms is a critical first step for receiving treatment (Jorm, 2012). Interestingly, there was a discrepancy between recognition of the term 'misophonia' and personal contact with miso -phonia. Specifically, a small portion of individuals had not heard of the term misophonia, but identified as having miso -phonia or reported knowing someone with misophonia after receiving the definition of misophonia. One possible expla -nation for this result is that laypersons may be familiar with misophonia  symptoms,  but  may  not  be  familiar  with  the term misophonia or may not be able to distinguish symp -toms from other syndromes with similar features, such as tinnitus, autism spectrum disorder, phonophobia, and hyper -acusis. However, these results may suggest that merely pro -viding the clinical definition facilitated increased awareness of misophonia. Additional research is needed to further elu -cidate layperson recognition of terminology and knowledge of the symptoms of misophonia and closely connected dis -orders (e.g., Furnham &amp; Anthony, 2010; Jorm et al., 2006). For instance, in addition to assessing recognition, it may be beneficial to provide definitions and evaluate respondents' ability to identify and distinguish between disorders. With regard to interest in learning more about misophonia, a size -able portion of the sample indicated some level of interest, suggesting  that  public  awareness  campaigns  may  be  suc -cessful in outreach and increasing misophonia knowledge. Nevertheless, a portion of the sample indicated little or no interest in learning more about misophonia. Without addi -tional  information,  it  is  difficult  to  interpret  this  lack  of interest;  however, it would not be expected that everyone in  the  general  public  would  have  a  strong  level  of  inter -est in obtaining additional information on misophonia. For instance, it is possible that these individuals were apathetic due  to  competing  areas  of  interest  and/or  the  absence  of compelling information on the impact of misophonia at the societal and personal level (Von Wagner et al., 2009). Future research exploring determinants of interest in misophonia knowledge may be advantageous for understanding how to improve the dissemination of information.

The final aim of this study was the examination of features of misophonia among individuals who recognized misopho -nia. These results revealed that understanding of misopho -nia was largely consistent with current scientific and clinical conceptualization. Further, the majority  of participants reported  moderate  levels  of  misophonia  knowledge. As  a next step, questionnaires evaluating knowledge of misopho -nia symptoms, causes, and treatment options may be help -ful for shedding light on gaps in information and potential misconceptions  associated  with  misophonia  that  could  be clarified through  awareness  campaigns.  Regarding  pri -mary sources of misophonia information, individuals com -monly identified the internet,  personal  experience,  media, and health education. This is consistent with recent studies showing that many individuals receive medical information from online sources (Hesse et al., 2005). Although social media  can  provide  an  easily  accessible  and  cost-efficient platform  for  health  information  (Zhou  et  al.,  2018),  it  is also associated with greater propagation of health misinfor -mation  (Suarez-Lledo  &amp; Alvarez-Galvez,  2021)  and  may perpetuate stigmatizing attitudes (Devendorf et al., 2020). Efforts to improve misophonia awareness should carefully consider  how  information  is  disseminated  through  differ -ent sources. For instance, increasing healthcare providers' knowledge and communication of misophonia with patients may be a critical next step given that misophonia is a rel -atively  new  condition  and  greater  trust  is  associated  with health  information  provided  by  physicians  (Hesse  et  al., 2005). Consequently, it is important for stakeholders to take an active role in distributing accurate misophonia informa -tion (e.g., Devendorf et al., 2020), particularly in these early phases of dissemination.

Despite  the  novel  contributions  of  this  study,  several limitations warrant mention. First, the findings are thought to represent adults in the U.S.; however, different patterns of misophonia awareness would likely be observed in other countries (Yu et al., 2020). In addition, these data represent current awareness and knowledge of misophonia; however, replication  and  extension  of  this  study  in  the  next  5-10 years  would  be  helpful  for  understanding  the  continued expansion  of  misophonia  knowledge.  Second,  despite  the large, representative sample, certain group level inferences may have been limited by the small portion of individuals reporting  misophonia  recognition  and  knowledge.  Third, although  participants  received  a  definition  of  misophonia to inform responses to subsequent questions, it is possible that participants may have conflated misophonia with other sound sensitivities (e.g., hyperacusis). Lastly, this study was restricted by the small number of survey items, which limits the scope of the data. For instance, the item assessing inter -est  in  learning  more  about  misophonia  was  not  contextu -alized, nor was the importance or value of learning about

1

misophonia  provided  to  the  respondent.  Future  studies incorporating comprehensive surveys, vignettes, and inter -views  are  needed  to  more  thoroughly  understand  public perceptions of misophonia, particularly as information on misophonia continues to grow.

Through  past  research,  the  importance  and  value  of awareness, and its effect on positive societal outcomes for mental  health  issues,  have  become  readily  apparent  (e.g., Entwistle et al., 1998). The current study provides evidence that awareness of misophonia is currently low in the gen -eral  population;  yet,  knowledge  appeared  to  be  accurate among the small portion of individuals who have heard of misophonia.  Furthermore,  these  findings  identify  certain demographic groups that are less likely to be familiar with misophonia and may need to be targeted in healthcare set -tings  and  through  community-based  campaigns.  Studies have shown focusing on public health campaigns, outreach endeavors, and public policy increases awareness and acts as  a  viable  option  for  educating  both  the  general  popula -tion (Dumesnil &amp; Verger, 2009; Van Asbroeck et al., 2021) and at-risk populations (Matsubayashi et al., 2014; Shah et al., 2020). Consequently, such efforts may serve as poten -tial  next  steps  for  improving  knowledge  of  misophonia among  the  general  population,  at-risk  communities,  and potential  providers.  Cumulatively,  the  results  are  critical for  understanding  current  levels  of  public  awareness  and are important for informing the next stages of advocacy for misophonia.
