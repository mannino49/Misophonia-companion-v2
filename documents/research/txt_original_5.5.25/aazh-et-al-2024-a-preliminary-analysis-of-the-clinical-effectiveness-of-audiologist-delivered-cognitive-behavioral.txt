Purpose: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a key intervention for manage-
ment of misophonia, hyperacusis, and tinnitus. The aim of this study was to 
perform a preliminary analysis comparing the scores for self-report question-
naires before and after audiologist-delivered CBT via video calls for adults with 
misophonia, hyperacusis, or tinnitus or a combination of these. 
Method: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study. The data for 37 con-
secutive patients who received CBT for misophonia, hyperacusis, or tinnitus 
from a private institute in the United Kingdom were analyzed. Self-report ques-
tionnaires taken as part of routine care were as follows: 4C Questionnaires for 
tinnitus, hyperacusis, and misophonia (4C-T, 4C-H, and 4C-M, respectively), 
Tinnitus Impact Questionnaire (TIQ), Hyperacusis Impact Questionnaire (HIQ), 
Misophonia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ), Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Question-
naire (SSSQ), and Screening for Anxiety and Depression in Tinnitus (SAD-T). 
Responses were also obtained to other questionnaires related to tinnitus, hyper-
acusis, insomnia, and anxiety and mood disorders. A linear mixed-model 
method was used to assess the changes in response to the questionnaires 
pretreatment and posttreatment. 
Results: Pretreatment–posttreatment comparisons showed that scores for the 
4C-T, 4C-H, 4C-M, TIQ, HIQ, MIQ, SSSQ, and SAD-T improved, with effect sizes of 1.4, 1.2, 1.3, 2.6, 0.9, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.4, respectively (all p < .05). 
Conclusions: This preliminary analysis suggests that CBT via video calls may be effective in reducing the impact of misophonia, hyperacusis, and tinnitus. However, this study did not have a control group, so its results need to be 
interpreted with caution. 
Misophonia is characterized by reduced tolerance to 
one or more specific sound(s) or stimuli associated with 
such sounds (Swedo et al., 2022). Common triggers 
include but are not limited to sounds associated with oral 
functions, nasal sounds, nonoral/nasal sounds produced by people, and sounds produced by objects or sounds gen-erated by animals (Hansen et al., 2021; Swedo et al., 
2022). Misophonia can limit the individual’s social life 
and lead to functional impairment, worse general health 
status, and poorer quality of life compared to the general 
population (Dibb & Golding, 2022; Holohan et al., 2023; 
Jakubovski et al., 2022; Möllmann et al., 2023). About 
18% of the U.K. population are estimated to have symp-
toms of misophonia that can have a significant impact on 
their life (Vitoratou et al., 2023). Individuals with misopho-
nia often exhibit emotional problems, avoidance behaviors, 
perfectionism, cognitive distortions, anxiety disorders, and

•depression (Dibb & Golding, 2022; Guetta et al., 2022; 
Jakubovski et al., 2022; Paunovic & Milenković, 2022; 
Remmert et al., 2022; Rosenthal et al., 2022; Siepsiak 
et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Yektatalab et al., 2022). 
Several case reports suggest that cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT) can be effective in alleviating the effect of misophonia on the patient’s life (Bernstein et al., 2013; 
McGuire et al., 2015; Roushani & Mehrabizadeh 
Honarmand, 2021). Group CBT has a lso been shown to 
be effective in helping patients to manage their misopho-nia (Ghorbani et al., 2022; Jager et al., 2021). 
Hyperacusis is the perception of certain everyday 
sounds, such as domestic noise or noise in public places, 
as too loud or painful in such a way that it causes signifi-
cant distress and impairment in social, occupational, recre-
ational, and other day-to-day activities (Aazh et al., 2014, 
2016; Fagelson & Baguley, 2018). A systematic review 
reported that the prevalence of hyperacusis in the general 
population varies across studies from less than 1% to 17% (Ren et al., 2021). Individuals with hyperacusis often 
exhibit high levels of stress, poorer mental and physical 
health, and lower quality of life than the general popula-tion (Fackrell et al., 2022; Manohar et al., 2023; Sacchetto 
et al., 2022). CBT has been shown to be an acceptable 
treatment for hyperacusis from the perspective of patients 
(Aazh, Bryant, & Moore, 2019). Several studies reported 
that CBT delivered in face-to-face sessions reduces the 
impact of hyperacusis on the patient’s life and improves 
the associated symptoms of anxiety and depression (Aazh & Moore, 2018a; Juris et al., 2014; Nolan et al., 2020). 
Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of 
acoustic stimuli external to the body. Tinnitus can lead to 
emotional distress, cognitive dysfunction, autonomic arousal, 
behavioral changes, and functional disability, in which case it 
is called tinnitus disorder (De Ridder et al., 2021). The preva-
lence of tinnitus in the adult population is estimated to be 
about 14% (Jarach et al., 2022). Patients with tinnitus disorder 
often exhibit symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, sui-
cidal and self-harm ideations, and have poor quality of life 
(Aazh, Baguley, & Moore, 2019; Aazh & Moore, 2017a, 2018c; 
Asnis et al., 2018; Bhatt et al., 2017; Boecking et al., 2021; 
Salazar et al., 2019). Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and uncontrolled retrospective clinical studies reported 
that CBT is acceptable and effective for the management 
of tinnitus, whether delivered by psychologists or audiolo-
gists (Aazh, Bryant, & Moore, 2019; Aazh & Moore, 
2018a, 2018b; Barry & Marks, 2023; Beukes et al., 2018; 
Cima et al., 2012). 
To sum up, several studies support the efficacy of 
CBT for the rehabilitation of patients with misophonia, 
hyperacusis, and tinnitus (Aazh & Allott, 2016; Aazh, 
Bryant, & Moore, 2019; Aazh & Moore, 2018a, 2018b; Cima et al., 2012; Jager et al., 2021; Jüris et al., 2014; 
Martinez-Devesa et al., 2010; Schroder et al., 2017). How-ever, the method of delivering CBT in all these studies 
was largely via face-to-face sessions. The effectiveness of 
audiologist-delivered CBT for misophonia, hyperacusis, and tinnitus delivered via video calls has not, to our 
knowledge, been reported. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for 
telehealth increased considerably (Wosik et al., 2020). 
Audiologist-delivered CBT given via video calls seems to be 
acceptable to most patients with tinnitus (Aazh et al., 2021). 
However, it is important to assess whether CBT delivered by 
audiologists via video calls is effective for the management of 
misophonia, hyperacusis, and tinnitus. The aims of this study 
were (a) to compare responses to self-report questionnaires 
before and after CBT delivered by audiologists via video calls 
to adults with misophonia, hyperacusis, and tinnitus and (b) 
to assess factors related to the treatment outcome. 
Method 
Ethical Approval 
All participants agreed that their anonymized data 
could be used for service improvement and research pur-
poses. Informed consent was waived because routine clini-
cal data were analyzed retrospectively. The study was 
approved by the University of Surrey Ethics Committee 
(Project ID: FHMS 21–22 147 EGA). 
Study Design and Patients 
The study was conducted at Hashir International 
Specialist Clinics & Research Institute for Misophonia, 
Tinnitus and Hyperacusis (for brevity, from now on 
Hashir International Institute [HII]), Guildford and London, 
United Kingdom. The study population comprised 37 
consecutive patients who received a full course of CBT for 
misophonia, hyperacusis, tinnitus, or some combination of 
these, delivered by audiologists via video calls, during 
2021–2022 at HII. Demographic data for the patients and 
the outcomes of their self-report questionnaires were 
imported from records held at the clinic. 
As a part of history taking, each patient was asked: 
(a) if they had been prescribed any drugs for a psychiatric 
condition or if they were undergoing any form or therapy 
in addition to CBT; (b) if they had ever received a diagno-
sis of mental illness (denoted History of Mental Health 
Problems, HMH); and (c) if they had ever seen a mental 
health professional (denoted Seen Mental Health profes-sional, SMH). Parental mental health was assessed using a 
question adopted from the questionnaire for Adverse

Childhood Experiences (Anda et al., 2006; Felitti et al., 
1998). The question was, “While you were growing up 
during the first 18 years of life, did your parent(s) have depression or mental illness?” (Felitti et al., 1998). The 
response alternatives were “yes” or “no.” The test–retest 
reliability for this question is moderate (Cohen’s κ = .48, SE = 0.052, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.37, 0.58]; Dube et al., 2004). 
Diagnosis of Misophonia, Hyperacusis, 
and Tinnitus 
The diagnosis of clinically significant misophonia, 
hyperacusis, and/or tinnitus was based on a clinical inter-
view conducted by audiologists specialized in the manage-
ment of those disorders. The criteria described by Aazh, 
Hayes, et al. (2024) and Aazh, Moore, et al. (2023) were 
used for the diagnosis of misophonia and hyperacusis. In 
short, for a positive diagnosis of misophonia and/or hypera-
cusis, the person’s sound intolerance should adversely affect 
their day-to-day activities, or their mood, or their ability 
to rest and relax, or the person should use avoidance 
behaviors or rituals to cope with the sounds that bother 
them. A sensitivity to certain sounds without this having a 
significant impact on their day-to-day life was not suffi-
cient for a diagnosis of hyperacusis or misophonia. A pos-
itive diagnosis of hyperacusis required the person to per-ceive some sounds as too loud, uncomfortable, or painful, 
their main complaint not being related to decreased toler-
ance to typical misophonia trigger sounds (i.e., oral and nasal sounds or repetitive sounds made by humans or 
machines). In contrast, a positive diagnosis of misophonia required the person to perceive misophonia trigger sounds as disgusting, offensive, or annoying, their primary reaction 
to such sounds not being aural pain or physical discomfort 
due to excessive loudness. In addition, for a positive diag-
nosis of hyperacusis or misophonia, the person’ss o u n d 
intolerance should not be better explained by their general 
attitude toward noise and environmental noise pollution 
(e.g., noise from neighbors, nearby airports, traffic, work-
shops, internal plumbing, air conditioning). This was 
intended to differentiate hyperacusis and misophonia from 
noise sensitivity, which is known as a personality trait 
(Kishikawa et al., 2006). Finally, the person’s sound intol-
erance symptoms should not be better explained by other 
underlying medical or psychosocial conditions. 
Clinically significant tinnitus, also known as tinnitus 
disorder (De Ridder et al., 2021), was diagnosed if the 
person showed at least one of the first four characteristics 
listed next in addition to Characteristic 5: 
1. Tinnitus interrupts some day-to-day tasks or activities. 
2. Tinnitus adversely affects mood. 3. Tinnitus adversely affects resting, relaxing, or 
sleeping. 
4. The person uses avoidance behaviors or rituals to 
cope with their tinnitus. 
5. The effect on the person’s activities, mood, or 
behaviors is related to the experience of tinnitus and is not better explained by other underlying medical 
or psychosocial conditions. 
Self-Report Questionnaires 
Several self-report questionnaires were completed 
during the assessment session before the start of the treat-
ment and again at the end of the last session. The self-report measures used can be divided into two distinct 
groups: (a) disease-specific questionnaires for misophonia, 
hyperacusis, and tinnitus, and (b) mental health question-
naires. Table 1 lists the disease-specific questionnaires, 
which include the 4C Questionnaires for tinnitus, hypera-
cusis, and misophonia (4C-T, 4C-H, and 4C-M, respec-
tively; Aazh, Kartsonaki, & Moore, 2024); Tinnitus 
Impact Questionnaire (TIQ; Aazh, Hayes, et al., 2023); 
Hyperacusis Impact Questionnaire (HIQ; Aazh et al., 
2022); Misophonia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ; Aazh, Moore, et al., 2023); Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Ques-
tionnaire (SSSQ; Aazh et al., 2022); Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI; Newman et al., 1996); Hyperacusis Ques-tionnaire (HQ; Khalfa et al., 2002); Inventory of Hypera-
cusis Symptoms (IHS; Greenberg & Carlos, 2018); and Visual Analog Scale (VAS; Maxwell, 1978). 
Table 2 summarizes the questionnaires assessing 
constructs (mainly mental illness) that are related and/or 
coexist with misophonia, tinnitus, and hyperacusis. These 
include the Screening for Anxiety and Depression in Tin-
nitus (SAD-T; Aazh et al., 2022), Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7; Spitzer et al., 2006), 
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke et al., 2001), Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI; Abramo-
witz et al., 2007), The Mini-Social Phobia Inventory 
(Mini-SPIN; Connor et al., 2001), Obsessive Compulsive 
Inventory–Revised (OCI-R; Foa et al., 2002), Panic Disor-
der Severity Scale-Self Report (PDSS-SR; Houck et al., 
2002), Penn State Worry Questionnaire–Abbreviated 
(PSWQ-A; Hopko et al., 2003), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; Bastien et al., 2001). Table 2 also shows the 
cutoff scores for the psychological questionnaires, as rec-
ommended by the U.K. mental health system (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies, 2011). These cutoff 
scores were used in the present study. 
All of these questionnaires were completed as part 
of the routine care at HII. Patients completed these ques-
tionnaires online without involvement of their audiologist.

Audiologist-Delivered CBT 
Audiologist-delivered CBT sessions were performed 
online using video calls. The therapy program involved 14 
one-to-one sessions. The first 10 sessions were weekly. 
Then the gap between sessions increased to 2 weeks, 
1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Each session lasted between 45 and 60 min. The self-report questionnaires 
described earlier were administered prior to the first CBT 
session and at the final session (Session 14), which acted as a 6-month follow-up. 
The content of the intervention was consistent with 
the key CBT theories and methods (Beck, 2011; Greenberger 
& Padesky, 2015). However, unlike general CBT methods, the strategies used in these 14 sessions were fine-tuned to 
address the issues that were specific to the distress caused by 
the tinnitus, hyperacusis, and misophonia (Aazh, Landgrebe, 
et al., 2019; Aazh & Moore, 2022). Table 3 summarizes the actions taken during each CBT session. The actions 
needed to be adjusted based on the patient’s needs. 
Throughout, the principle of guided discovery (Todd & 
Freshwater, 1999) was employed, in that the patient made 
discoveries with the help of careful questioning from the 
audiologist rather than the audiologist giving information 
and advice. 
Training of Audiologists 
The CBT was delivered by three qualified audiolo-
gists who specialized in rehabilitation of misophonia, 
hyperacusis, and tinnitus. They attended a 1-year train-
ing course based on CBT. The course included (a) lec-
tures, practical training, and multiple-choice assessment 
(26 hr of Continuing Professional Development [CPD] or 
Continuing Education Units [CEU] points for lectures, 18 hr of CPD/CEU points for clinical supervision/case 
study sessions, 1 hr of CPD/CEU points for multiple-
choice tests); (b) directed self-study (85 hr of reading and working through the provided/recommended course materials to complete the case studies and written assign-
ments); and (c) self-directed study (20 hr of general 
reading around the subject and contributing to an online discussion forum). After attending the course, the audiol-
ogists received ongoing coaching and clinical supervision from the first author and another clinical supervisor, dur-
ing which they could discuss their difficult patients and 
receive feedback and additional informal training when 
indicated. 
Data Analysis 
The data were anonymized prior to conducting sta-
tistical analyses. The statistical analyses were performedTable 3. Illustration of the general structure of the cognitive behav-
ioral therapy (CBT) program and summary of the tasks performed 
in each of the CBT sessions. 
Session Actions taken in each session 
Session 1 Rapport building and getting to know the patient. 
Misophonia/hyperacusis/tinnitus education. 
Enhancing patient’s motivation for CBT. 
Session 2 Creating a CBT formulation, which is a model 
demonstrating how the patient’s thought 
process and their emotional and behavioral 
reactions to tinnitus or the trigger sounds (in the 
case of hyperacusis or misophonia) create a 
vicious cycle of distress. 
Discussing the formulation. 
Encouraging the patient to list their avoidance and 
ritualist behaviors and to plan to modify them. 
Session 3 CBT education: patients learning theoretical 
underpinnings of CBT and its relevance to the 
management of misophonia/hyperacusis/tinnitus. 
Introducing the Diary of Thoughts and Feelings 
(DTF): This helps the patient to learn how to 
identify and modify their tinnitus/sound-related 
erroneous thoughts and consequential emotions. 
SEL: This is an acronym for a CBT exercise (Stop– 
Expose–Learn) in which the patient is encouraged 
to Stop avoidance behaviors and rituals, Expose 
themselves to tinnitus and/or trigger sounds, and Learn from it. 
Session 4 Review DTF. Review and escalate SEL. 
Session 5 Explore thoughts on DTF. Identify the patient’s key troublesome negative 
thoughts, also known as “hot thoughts.” 
Review and escalate SEL. 
Session 6 Educate on thought distortions. 
Identify thought distortions in DTF. Review and escalate SEL. 
Session 7 Introduce counterstatements. Review and escalate SEL. 
Session 8 Review counterstatements. Review and escalate SEL. 
Session 9 Create list of negative thoughts and corresponding 
counterstatements. 
Review and escalate SEL. 
Session 10 Introduce KKIS: This is an acronym for a CBT 
exercise (Know, Keep on, Identify & Substitute) in which the patient learns to Know in what 
circumstances they need to do CBT, practice Keeping on and not to be afraid of experiencing 
the negative emotions, Identify and analyze their thoughts and if they are irrational, then 
Substitute them with alternative thoughts, which 
are known as counterstatements. 
Session 11 Review KKIS. Progress review. 
Session 12 Review KKIS and problem solving. 
Session 13 Review KKIS and problem solving. 
How to manage setbacks. 
Session 14 Final review. 
CBStyle: learn how to integrate CBT into lifestyle.

•using R software. To account for the non-independence of 
observations inherent in repeated-measures data, and to 
address the unbalanced design and missing data, a linear 
mixed-model (LMM) approach was adopted.
Diagnostic groups with a sample size of two or less, 
as noted in Table 4, were excluded from the LMM analyses. Fixed-effects factors in the analysis were time 
(pre-/posttreatment), diagnostic category for categories with a 
sample size of three or more (denoted diagnosis: tinnitus = T, 
misophonia = M, and tinnitus with hyperacusis = TH), Drug 
(psychiatric medication or psychological therapies in addition 
to CBT; yes/no), and gender (male/female). A random inter-
cept for patients was included to account for within-subject 
correlations in the random-effects design matrix. 
All continuous outcomes from each questionnaire 
were analyzed using LMMs with maximum-likelihood 
estimation, implemented in the lme4 package (Bates et al., 
2015). A Gamma generalized linear mixed model was used to meet the normality assumption for the PDSS-SR 
questionnaire. Statistical significance was defined as a p value < .05. Effect sizes (ESs) were reported using Hedges’ g to correct for small sample sizes, with small 
(g = 0.2), medium (g = 0.5), and large (g = 0.8) effects 
(Hedges & Olkin, 2014). The Satterthwaite adjustment was applied to compute the degrees of freedom (Keselman 
et al., 1999). Significant main effects of diagnosis led to 
post hoc pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni adjust-
ments for multiple comparisons. 
In the present study, only the main effects were ana-
lyzed due to the extensive number and type of question-
naires administered and the relatively small sample sizes 
for certain groups. Interaction effects like Time × Diagnosis 
or Time × Diagnosis × Drug, as well as random slopes, 
were not included due to these constraints. 
ESs are reported solely for pretreatment/posttreat-
ment comparisons. Some of the patients did not complete 
all of the self-report questionnaires due to time con-
straints. The number of patients included in each analysis (n) is reported wherever indicated. 
Results 
Characteristics of the Study Population 
The average age of the patients was 45.4 years 
(SD = 17 years, range: 17–78 years), and 46% were male. 
Among the patients, 38.5% were either taking psychiatric 
medication or undergoing psychological therapies in addi-
tion to CBT. A history of diagnosed mental illness was 
present for 73% of patients, and 78% had seen mental 
health professionals. While they were growing up during the first 18 years of life, 65% reported that one or both of 
their parents had depression or mental illness. Based on 
scores for the THI and TIQ, 93% and 95% of patients with 
tinnitus (with or without hyperacusis/misophonia) had some 
level of tinnitus handicap, respectively. Based on scores for the SAD-T screening questionnaire, 89% of patients had 
symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Using two more 
comprehensive questionnaires, namely, the PHQ-9 and 
GAD-7, 78% and 80.5% of patients had symptoms of 
depression and anxiety, respectively. Based on their 
responses to Question 9 of the PHQ-9, 62% of patients 
expressed suicidal ideations. Sleep disturbances as measured 
via the ISI were reported by 81% of patients. Based on the 
clinical interview, 33% had tinnitus only (T), 3% had hyper-
acusis only (H), 24% had misophonia only (M), 35% had 
tinnitus combined with hyperacusis (TH), and 5% had tin-
nitus combined with hyperacusis and misophonia (THM). 
Noncompletion Rate 
During 2021–2022, 41 patients enrolled in the treat-
ment but only 37 completed the course, giving a completion 
rate of 90%. Among the four patients who did not complete 
their treatment, two had tinnitus and hyperacusis, one had 
tinnitus, and one had misophonia. For 3/4, the reason for 
discontinuing the therapy was that they felt that they did not 
need any further help as they were managing their symptoms 
well or their tinnitus/hyperacusis was no longer a priority for 
them due to other health or social circumstances. One 
patient completed 12 sessions but was lost to follow-up at 
Sessions 13 and 14, for reasons unknown to us. 
Pre–Post Comparisons for Questionnaires 
Table 4 shows the mean scores for the questionnaires 
before and after treatment for each diagnostic group. When 
only one patient fell in a given diagnostic group, the score 
for the individual patient is reported. The T, M, and TH 
groups had more than two patients, so the pre–post com-
parisons and post hoc analyses were focused on them. 
Table 5 compares the proportion of patients with 
abnormal scores for the self-report measures for groups T, 
M, and TH. Compared to groups T and M, group TH 
had the highest proportion of patients with abnormal 
scores for measures of hyperacusis (HQ, HIQ, SSSQ), 
depression (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (GAD-7, PSWQ, 
SAD-T), and health anxiety (SHAI). Patients in group 
TH also had the highest incidence of suicidal ideations, history of mental illness, and parental mental illness in 
their childhood. Group M had the highest proportion of 
patients with abnormal scores for measure of misopho-
nia (MIQ), social anxiety (Mini-SPIN), and obsessive– 
compulsive disorder (OCD; OCI-R). Group M had the

highest proportion of patients who were receiving counsel-
ing and/or psychiatric medication in addition to CBT. The 
posttreatment columns for these three groups show that 
after CBT, the proportion of patients with abnormal 
scores was reduced for all measures except PDSS-SR for group T. Based on the key measures of the impact of mis-
ophonia and hyperacusis, MIQ and HIQ, about 22% in 
groups M and TH were classified as experiencing a signifi-
cant impact of their main compla ints post CBT. These 
percentages were lower than the pretreatment values of 
78% (group M) and 91% (group TH). Based on the mea-
sures of the impact of tinnitus, TIQ and THI, about 
37.5% (25% severe impact and 12.5% slight impact) and 55.5% (33% slight and 22% severe impact) were classified 
as experiencing an impact of their tinnitus post CBT, 
respectively. These percentages were lower than the pre-
treatment values of 100% with severe tinnitus impact as 
measured via the TIQ, a nd 92% with severe tinnitus 
impact and 8% with moderate tinnitus impact as measured 
via the THI. Pretreatment sleep difficulties as measured 
via the ISI were moderate for 42% and severe for 58% of patients in group T and slight for 15%, moderate for 
38.5%, and severe for 31% of patients in group TH. Based 
on posttreatment ISI scores, these changed to slight for 11%, moderate for 11%, and severe for 11% (group T) and 
slight for 12.5% and severe for 12.5% (group TH).Table 5. Percentage of abnormal scores for the main diagnosis groups.

•suggests that HIQ scores effectively discriminate between 
patients with and without a diagnosis of hyperacusis. 
MIQ scores were higher for patients in group M than for 
those in groups T or TH, suggesting that MIQ scores 
effectively differentiate between patients with and with-
out misophonia. For the SSSQ, pairwise comparisons 
showed higher SSSQ scores for group TH than for 
groups T and M. For the ISI, patients in group M had 
lower scores than those in groups T or TH. For the 
PHQ-9, patients in group TH had higher scores than 
those in group M. For the IHS, patients in group T had 
lower scores than group TH.
For the 4C-H, there was a significant effect of Drug. 
Patients who were receiving psychiatric medication or psy-chological therapies in addition to CBT for hyperacusis 
had significantly lower 4C-H scores (lower 4C scores indi-
cate having less confidence in managing their hyperacusis) 
than those who were not receiving additional treatments. For the PSWQ-A, there were significant effects of Drug 
and gender. Patients receiving psychiatric medication or 
psychological therapies in conjunction with CBT had signif-
icantly lower PSWQ-A scores than those who were not 
receiving additional treatments. Female patients had higher 
PSWQ-A scores than male patients. 
Discussion 
To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study 
that compares scores for a wide range of questionnaires 
related to misophonia, hyperacusis, and tinnitus and men-
tal illness before and after CBT delivered by audiologists via video calls. A wide range of questionnaires (mainly 
abbreviated versions) were used that have been shown to 
be useful in screening for psychological comorbidities 
among patients seeking help for misophonia, hyperacusis, and tinnitus (Aazh & Moore, 2017b). These were used to 
screen for anxiety and mood disorders, with the intention of referring a patient to appropriate mental health services 
if they had abnormal scores. These questionnaires have 
been shown to be relevant and acceptable to patients seek-
ing help for tinnitus and/or hyperacusis (Aazh & Moore, 
2017b). Several validated measures were used to assess the 
impact of tinnitus (TIQ, 4C-Tinnitus, THI, VAS), hypera-
cusis (HIQ, SSSQ, IHS, and HQ), and misophonia 
(MIQ). However, some of the measures used here were 
not validated (4C-misophonia and 4C-hyperacusis). 
Pre- and post-CBT comparisons showed that all 
measures related to misophonia, hyperacusis, and tinnitus 
improved, all with large ESs. Sleep disturbances and 
symptoms of anxiety and mood disorders improved signif-
icantly, with medium ESs for the SHAI, Mini-SPIN, OCI-R, 
PDSS-SR, and PSWQ-A and large ESs for the ISI, SAD-T, GAD-7, and PHQ-9. Among the psychological measures, the highest ESs were for the PHQ-9, GAD-7, and SAD-T, 
which assess general symptoms of anxiety and depression. 
The lowest ESs were for measures related to specific anxiety disorders, namely, OCI-R, Mini-SPIN, SHAI, PSWQ-A, 
and PDSS-SR. These outcomes suggest that CBT deliv-
ered by audiologists via video calls for the management of 
misophonia, hyperacusis, and tinnitus is: (a) effective in 
reducing the impact of these conditions on the patient’s 
life; (b) effective in reducing the impact of these conditions 
on psychological well-being or on possible general anxiety 
and depression symptoms; and (c) less effective in alleviat-ing specific anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder, health anxiety social phobia, and OCD. This highlights 
the need for additional support from mental health profes-
sionals when such psychological disorders are identified. 
In this study, the ESs for the measures of tinnitus, 
insomnia, anxiety, and depression were larger than for a previous study that used six sessions of face-to-face, 
audiologist-delivered CBT (Aazh, Bryant, & Moore, 2019). The ES values reported by Aazh, Bryant, and 
Moore (2019) were 1.7 for the THI, 0.51 for VAS of Tin-
nitus Loudness (VASL), 1.2 for VAS of Tinnitus Annoy-
ance (VASA), 1.3 for VAS of Effect of Tinnitus on Life (VASE), 0.92 for the ISI, 1.1 for the GAD-7, and 1.3 for 
the PHQ-9. In the current study, the ES values were 1.98 (95% CI [0.82, 3.15]) for the THI, 1 (95% CI [0.39, 1.7]) 
for the VASL, 1.7 (95% CI [0.76, 2.61]) for the VASA, 
1.5 (95% CI [0.67, 2.27]) for the VASE, 1.1 (95% CI [0.57, 
1.67]) for the ISI, 1 (95% CI [0.45, 1.58]) for the GAD-7, 
and 1.3 (95% CI [0.57, 1.99]) for the PHQ-9. Although 
these two studies were similar regarding the key princi-
ples of the CBT intervention, there were some methodo-
logical differences between them that could explain the 
larger ESs observed in the current study. For example, 
the current study differed from the study of Aazh, 
Bryant, and Moore (2019) with regard to the number of 
sessions CBT sessions (14 vs. 6), method of delivery 
(video vs. face to face), the time interval between the last 
two sessions (6 months vs. 1 week), the completion rate 
(91% vs. 77.5%), and the study populations (self-funded 
patients being treated by a private clinic vs. patients seen 
free of charge in the U.K. National Health Service). In 
addition, compared to the study of Aazh, Bryant, and 
Moore (2019), the patient population in the current study 
had more severe pretreatment scores for the THI (M = 
73, SD =1 7v s . M = 62, SD =1 6 ) ,V A S L (M =7 . 4 , 
SD =1 . 8 v s . M =6 . 3 , SD = 2.1), VASA (M =8 . 3 , 
SD =1 . 6 v s . M =7 . 5 , SD = 1.7), VASE (M =8 . 2 , SD = 
1.8 vs. M =7 , SD =2 ) , G A D - 7(M =1 4 , SD =6 . 1 v s . 
M =1 2 , SD = 6), and PHQ-9 (M = 14.9, SD =7 . 1 v s . 
M = 13, SD = 6). On the one hand, worse pretreatment 
scores provide more opportunity for improvement,

leading to larger ESs, but on the other hand, worse 
scores can indicate a more complex patient population, 
making the treatment more challenging and reducing the 
ESs. Because of these differences across studies, no con-
clusions can be drawn about the relative effectiveness of CBT delivered face-to-face and via video calls. 
Our results showed that 25% of patients with tinni-
tus and 22% of patients with misophonia were classified 
as having a significant impact of their main complaints 
after treatment. This suggests that for some patients, ongoing support may be needed, after they finish CBT. 
Future research should explore what kind of posttreat-
ment support or interventions might further reduce the 
impact of these conditions. 
Abnormal depression scores posttreatment occurred 
for 22% of patients in group T and 44% of patients in 
group TH. For anxiety, the highest proportions of patients 
with abnormal scores were 60% of group M for the 
GAD-7 and 62.5% of group TH for the SHAI. These out-
comes are consistent with previous research showing that 
about 50% of patients with depression and/or anxiety do 
not recover fully after taking psychiatric medication and/ 
or having psychotherapy, including CBT (Al-Harbi, 2012; 
González-Valero et al., 2019; Kennedy & Giacobbe, 
2007). More research is needed to better understand the 
underlying mechanism of comorbid depression and anxi-
ety that might exist among patients with misophonia, hyperacusis, and tinnitus and to provide clinicians with 
better guidance in their treatment. 
Study Limitations 
RCTs are needed to assess more accurately the effi-
cacy of audiologist-delivered CBT provided via video 
calls. As this study did not have a control group, it is dif-
ficult to determine if the improvements in scores were pro-
duced specifically by the CBT or were overestimated due 
to the placebo effect of receiving treatment from a special-
ist (Pocock, 1983). 
Another limitation is the retrospective design, which 
limited the study to the data collected in routine clinical 
practice. For example, misophonia was assessed with only 
one questionnaire, the MIQ. This is because other miso-
phonia questionnaires were not used in routine clinical practice at the start of the study period. 
There were only a few patients with a diagnosis of 
H and THM. Therefore, patients who fell in these diag-
nostic groups were excluded from most of the analyses. 
Overall, our sample size was small. Future studies with 
larger cohorts are required to assess change in scores fol-
lowing CBT for patients with a diagnosis of H or THM and also to address the interaction effects of taking psychiatric medication and/or other psychological thera-
pies in addition to undertaking CBT. 
Conclusions 
This preliminary study shows that audiologist-
delivered CBT provided via video calls gave promising 
results in helping patients to reduce the impact of miso-
phonia, hyperacusis, and tinnitus on their life. Mostly, the 
ESs were larger for measures related to the impact of mis-
ophonia, hyperacusis, and tinnitus and for symptoms of 
general anxiety and depression symptoms than for mea-
sures related to specific anxiety disorders, namely, social 
phobia and OCD. Although most patients showed 
improvement in their self-report measures, between 22% 
and 25% of patients were still classified as having a severe 
impact of their main complaint (misophonia, hyperacusis, and tinnitus) after treatment. For group T, about 20% of 
patients were classified as having significant psychological 
problems and 11% had severe insomnia after treatment. 
For groups TH and M, 55.5% and 60% of patients, 
respectively, were classified as having general anxiety and 
44% and 28.5%, respectively, had symptoms of depression after treatment. This suggests that for some patients, 
ongoing psychological support may be needed after they 
finish CBT. This study did not have a control group; 
therefore, its results need to be interpreted with caution.
