Objectives: Misophonia —an unusually strong intolerance of
certain sounds —can cause significant distress and disrup-
tion to those who have it but is an enigma in terms of ourscientific understanding. A key challenge for explaining
misophonia is that, as with other disorders, it is likely to
emerge from an interaction of traits that also occur in the
general population (e.g., sensory sensitivity and anxiety)
and that are transdiagnostic in nature (i.e., shared withother disorders).
Methods: In this preregistered study with a large sample of
participants ( N= 1430), we performed a cluster analysis
(based on responses to questions relating to misophonia)
and identified two misophonia subgroups differing in
severity, as well as a third group without misophonia. A
subset of this sample ( N= 419) then completed a battery of
measures designed to assess sensory sensitivity and clinical
comorbidities.
Results: Clinical symptoms were limited to the most severe
group of misophonics (including autistic traits, migraine
with visual aura, anxiety sensitivity, obsessive ‐compulsive
traits). Both the moderate and severe groups showed
elevated attention ‐to‐detail and hypersensitivity (across
multiple senses). A novel symptom network model of the

data shows the presence of a central hub linking
misophonia to sensory sensitivity which, in turn, connects
to other symptoms in the network (relating to autism,
anxiety, etc.).
Conclusion: The core features of misophonia are sensory ‐
attentional in nature with severity linked strongly to
comorbidities.

1|INTRODUCTION
Misophonia is a disorder of decreased tolerance to specific sounds, referred to as triggers (Jastreboff & Jastreboff,
2001 ,2002 ; Swedo et al., 2022 ). Trigger sounds can be idiosyncratic but are often human ‐made noises that
originate from the mouth (lip ‐smacking, crunching, chewing, breathing). Triggers can also include repetitive noises
(e.g., clicking and tapping) or sounds made by animals or inanimate objects (e.g., clocks, fans, bass from speakers
etc.). While most people perceive such triggers as moderately irritating or might even fail to notice them, theemotional reactions experienced by misophonics include anger, disgust, anxiety, and feelings of powerlessness, as
well as physiological responses such as increased heart rate, sweating and a strong wish to escape consistent with
the fight ‐or‐flight response (Dozier & Morrison, 2017 ; Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ; Schröder
et al., 2013 ,2019 ). Although little is known about its epidemiology, misophonia is thought to be relatively common.
Jakubovski et al. ( 2022 ) found that 5% of a German representative sample reported what they described as
clinically significant misophonia. Misophonia is often comorbid with other clinical disorders and symptoms such asgeneralized anxiety (Wu et al., 2014 ), autism (Cassiello ‐Robbins et al., 2021 ; Rinaldi, Simner, et al., 2022 ) and
obsessive ‐compulsive personality traits (Brout et al., 2018 ; Cavanna & Seri, 2015 ; Schröder et al., 2013 ). These
profiling studies represent important first steps in characteristing misophonia but what is lacking is a mechanistic
understanding of how and why these features co ‐occur.
Current approaches to understanding mental disorders typically regard them as emerging from multiple simpler
interacting elements that are, to some degree, prevalent within the general population and shared by other
disorders (i.e., transdiagnostic). For example, Insel et al. ( 2010 ) proposed a new framework for research on mental
disorders, which treats any contributing factor as interacting elements they term “domains, ”in an approach the
authors call Research Domain Criteria, RDoC. These domains consist of systems such as learning, arousal, and so on,
with the ultimate goal of having a diagnosis and treatment based on an understanding of these mechanisms (Inselet al., 2010 ). A related mathematical modeling approach regards mental disorders as a network of symptoms (Fried
et al., 2017 ), and symptoms themselves potentially explicable as a network of interacting simpler elements (like the
domains in the RDoC approach). When several symptoms interact with each other they would appear, in a networkmodel, as an inter ‐connected hub. These hubs may approximate traditional multi ‐symptom diagnostic categories.
But note that they emerge in a data ‐driven way from sets of partial correlations (e.g., worry symptoms correlating
with negative affect symptoms) independently of clinical judgments. Crucially, comorbidities arise because some
symptoms/domains are shared between hubs (Fried et al., 2017 ). In this scenario, comorbidities are a natural
product of how disorders arise, rather than a failure to develop sufficiently precise clinical classifications to avoid
this situation in the first place (Borsboom, 2017 ). Network approaches naturally lend themselves to “spectrum ”ANDERMANE ET AL. |2365

views where each disorder can vary in terms of both severity and symptom presentation. This creates complex
issues about how to diagnose and treat misophonia (Schröder et al., 2013 ) and, from a scientific perspective, how to
identify relevant elements and understand their interactions. Network models are informative in this regard
because it is possible to quantify whether symptoms are central (influence many other symptoms) or peripheral
(having little influence) by, for example, summing the partial correlations emanating from each. The networkapproach has been applied to disorders such as post ‐traumatic stress disorder (Armour et al., 2017 ), bipolar disorder
(Pfennig et al., 2016 ; Ritter et al., 2015 ) and psychosis (Isvoranu et al., 2016 ). Here we apply it to the first time to
misophonia.
In terms of the simpler domains relevant to misophonia, there are several candidates which we explain in turn
below: interoception (and/or physiological reactivity), sensory sensitivity (Wu et al., 2014 ), and social ‐emotional
cognition (e.g., Cusack et al., 2018 Eijsker et al., 2019 ; Jager et al., 2020 ). Interoception refers to our ability to detect
and interpret signals from the body (heart, viscera, etc.) and can itself be divided into further domains (e.g.,interoceptive accuracy v. interoceptive awareness, Garfinkel et al., 2015 ). These processes may be linked to
misophonia because auditory triggers elicit strong bodily reactions (Dozier, Lopez, et al., 2017 ; Edelstein et al.,
2013 ) and neural activity in regions linked to interoception (Kumar et al., 2017 ). Sensory sensitivity is our
responsiveness to the exteroceptive world (e.g., our responses to lights, sounds, tastes, odors etc.), and can be
classified as hyper ‐sensitivity (over responsiveness, e.g., finding lights too bright) or hypo ‐sensitivity (under
responsiveness, e.g., failing to notice smells, sounds etc.). Misophonia may be similar to a family of potentiallyrelated conditions that share this trait of sensitivity, including hyperacusis (Fackrell et al., 2017 ), autism (Ward et al.,
2017 ), and migraine (Hibbard & O'Hare, 2015 ). There is some evidence that people with misophonia experience
discomfort in response to a broad range of sounds not limited to their own triggers (Hansen et al., 2021 ) and this
sensitivity even extends into heightened responses in the nonauditory domain (e.g., sensitivity to smells, tastes etc.,:Rinaldi, Simner, et al., 2022 ; Wu et al., 2014 ). Finally, social skills may be implicated at the core of misophonia given
that misophonia is characterized by interpersonal difficulties (e.g., annoyance with others), and changes in social
behavior (e.g., avoiding family meals; Rinaldi et al., 2021 ) and since most misophonic triggers are human ‐made
sounds (Edelstein et al., 2013 ).
In this study we test the hypothesis that misophonia co ‐occurs with a number of symptoms and traits,
specifically: autistic traits (measured via the Autism Spectrum Quotient [AQ]; Baron ‐Cohen et al., 2006 ), anxiety
(measured by the Anxiety ‐Sensitivity Index [ASI ‐3]; Taylor et al., 2007 ), migraines (measured via the Penn Online
Evaluation of Migraines [POEM]; Kaiser et al., 2019 ), obsessive ‐compulsive traits (measured via the Obsessive ‐
Compulsive Inventory [OCI]; Foa et al., 1998 ), as well as other hearing ‐related conditions (e.g., tinnitus, hyperacusis;
Aazh et al., 2022 ). We also hypothesize that misophonia is directly related to heightened sensory sensitivity, as
measured by the self ‐report Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ) (Robertson & Simmons, 2013 ) which asks about
different sensory modalities, and a task ‐based measure of “visual stress ”termed the Pattern Glare test (Braithwaite
et al., 2013 ). Here, striped patterns of different spatial frequencies are presented on a screen and participants
experience mid ‐and high ‐spatial frequencies as particularly aversive, generating visual distortions (i.e., bending of
lines and jittering) and somatic discomfort (i.e., headache and dizziness). Interoceptive sensibility can be regarded as
a particular form of (embodied) sensory sensitivity and the multidimensional assessment of interoceptiveawareness (MAIA) (Mehling et al., 2012 ) asks how much people notice, rely on, trust (etc.) their body sensations.
In terms of measuring and diagnosing misophonia i tself, there are a variety of measures that have
recently been developed that have good convergent validity with each other. Here we use the Sussex
Misophonia Scale (SMS; Rinaldi et al., 2021 ;R i n a l d i ,S m e e s ,e ta l . , 2022 ) which asks about common
misophonia triggers and contains a set of Likert questions which, when responses are summed together,
offers excellent dis criminative validity (Rinaldi et al., 2021 ). It has been independently validated against the
m o s tw i d e l yu s e dm i s o p h o n i am e a s u r et od a t e( t h eM i s o p h o n i aQ u e s t i o n n a i r e[ M Q ] ;W ue ta l . , 2014 ) and has
both convergent validity and divergent validity (Rinaldi et al., 2021 ). Another reason for choosing this
measure is that it consists of five factors. This ena bled us to explore possible heterogeneity amongst2366 |ANDERMANE ET AL.

misophonics (see also Norris et al., 2022 ). For example, some misophonics may be misophonic via high scores

where we find that the misophonia subgroups are not d efined according to individual factors, they are
defined in terms of misophonia severity (i.e., high, medium, and low across all factors). We further
demonstrate that severity is a strong predictor of co ‐morbidity of clinical symptoms. Finally, having five
factors relating to misophonia enables these to b e modeled separately withi n a symptom network model
leading to a better understanding of how different facets of misophonia are linked to sensory sensitivities and
clinical symptoms.
2|METHOD
The method and analysis plan were fully preregistered ( https://osf.io/27fgv/ ) and any deviations to the plan are
explicitly noted. The anonoymised data (raw and processed) are available at the same OSF location, alongside
analysis scripts.
2.1 |Participants
Participants were recruited into a two ‐part online study from a variety of sources likely to favor either people with
misophonia or non –misophonics. In the former case, a very large group of self ‐reported misophonics joined our
participant pool following a BBC radio interview where we discussed misophonia and invited misophonics tocontact us (May 18, 2021); we received N= 1158 responses after exclusions. In addition, a group of people were
recruited via the student body, via acquaintances, and via an online participation panel (hosted by https://www.
prolific.co ); together these comprised N= 272 after exclusions. Assignment into groups was based on a cluster
analysis of the factors scores from a validated measure of misophonia (SMS; Rinaldi et al., 2021 ) rather than the
initial recruitment stream. Hence, the details of the extracted groups are reported in the Results (and their
demographic details summarized in Table 1). To anticipate these results, we found that participants fell into three
groups: non –misophonics, moderate misophonics, and severe misophonics (see Results and Table 1).
The inclusion criteria were being aged 18 −70 years with self ‐reported normal or corrected ‐to‐normal
vision and hearing. In Part 2, participants with epileps y were excluded (a normal criteria for the Pattern Glare
test; Braithwaite et al., 2013 ; Evans & Stevenson, 2008 ). Additionally, participants were excluded after data
collection if their responses were su bstantially incomplete (to be include d participants needed to complete all
of the questionnaires except the pattern glare task) or unfeasibly fast (<25 min across all measures, or <8 min
on the Phenomenological Responses to Sounds task). Duplicate attempts at completing the task battery from
the same participant were excluded (with the last full a ttempt retained). Details about excluded participants
from Part 2 can be found in the Supporting Information Material.
Our final participants repr esented a combined sample of N= 1430, all of whom completed Part 1 of the
study (misophonia screening and hearing profile), and a subgroup ( N= 419) completed Part 2 (clinical
comorbidities and sensory sensitivity). There w as a small amount of missing data from the included
participants ( N= 26 for the pattern glare, N= 1 for the auditory sensory sensiti vity task). For Part 2, an a priori
power analysis, conducted in G*Power, based on N= 201 in two groups showed that this sample size would
be sensitive to detect small effect sizes (Cohen's d=0 . 3o rP e a r s o n ' s r= 0.15 and above) at a power of 85%,
α= 0.05. Comparing sub ‐groups of N= 105 would be sufficient to detect medium effect sizes size (Cohen's
d= 0.5 or equivalent) with a power of 95%, α= 0.05.

2.2 |Materials and procedure
Part 1 comprised the Hearing Questionnaire and SMS. All other measures were taken in Part 2. All research was
conducted online with the tasks hosted on our own website ( https://www.misophonia-hub.org/ ). The median time
to complete Part 1 of the study was 7.77 min and for Part 2 it was 46.38 min. All questionnaire items required a
forced response, whereas responses for the Phenomenological Responses to Sounds (considered elsewhere) and
Pattern Glare task descriptors used a Visual Analog Scale (with an initial default of 0). Participants completing Part 2were required to use a computer screen (a necessity for the Pattern Glare task) and ideally headphones (for theTABLE 1 Demographic details of participants who completed the first and second parts of the study (the latter

Phenomenological Responses to Sounds task), or a computer speaker. A summary of the list of materials and
procedure is given below in the order in which they are completed by participants.
2.2.1 |Hearing questionnaire
The hearing questionnaire describes distinct experiences of sound intolerance and hearing problems. Participants
are asked “Do any of these apply to you? ”and given descriptions of migraine phonophobia, phonophobia,
misophonia, hyperacusis, tinnitus, and hearing difficulties. These were adapted from several sources (Dawes et al.,2020 ; Fackrell et al., 2017 ; Swedo et al., 2022 ) in consultation with a Clinical Audiologist. The descriptions are listed
below.
“Migraine phonophobia: A temporary increase in sound intolerance that is related to a migraine
attack and fades away after the event. ”
“Phonophobia: When some or all sounds consistently cause extreme fear or anxiety which does not
bother other people in the same way. ”
“Misophonia: When sounds (e.g., crunching) consistently cause extreme emotions like anger or
disgust which does not bother other people in the same way. ”
“Hyperacusis: When everyday sounds feel overwhelming, loud, intense, or painful that do not bother
other people in the same way. ”
“Tinnitus: Experiencing persistent or intermittent noises (such as ringing or buzzing) in your head or
in one or both ears that lasts for more than 5 min at a time (even if you haven't been exposed to loudnoises or music). ”
“Hearing difficulties: Do you find it very difficult to follow a conversation if there is background noise
(such as TV, radio, children playing)? ”
Participants answered these questions on a 4 ‐point scale ( “This definitely does NOT apply to me, ”“I don't think
this applies to me ”,“This may apply to me, ”“This definitely DOES apply to me ”). Additionally, we asked whether
participants had sought any help (e.g., from a doctor, audiologist, and psychiatrist) for one or more of theseproblems with options Yes/No.
2.2.2 |SMS
The SMS is a two ‐part questionnaire with Part 1 eliciting infor mation about specific triggers for misophonia
(e.g., chewing sounds) and Part 2 comprising 39 Likert ‐type questions about the associated experiences of
people with misophonia (e.g., feelings, behaviors and life consequences) (Rinaldi et al., 2021 ). Hence, Part 1
contains 48 potential triggers for misophonia (e.g. , crunching) grouped into eight categories (e.g., “Ih a t e …the
sound of people eating ”) followed by the specific related triggers (e.g., “crunchy foods [e.g., apples] ”,“crispy
snacks, ”“chewing ”etc.). The questionnaire items in Part 2 (e.g., “I avoid going to work because of difficulties
with sounds ”) are rated on a scale from 0 to 4 (Never, Hardly Ever, Sometimes, Often, Always), with the total
score ranging from 0 to 156. The items in part 2 fall into fiv e factors as follows: feelings/isolation (16 items),
life consequences (work/friends) (6 items), inter ‐social reactivity (5 items), avoidance/repulsion (8 items), and
pain (4 items). Rinaldi et al. ( 2021 ) show that a cut ‐off value of 50.5 on the SMS has “excellent ”discriminative
ability between misophonics and non ‐misophonics (AUC = 0.91). The Cronbach's alpha reliability of SMS in
our sample was 0.98.ANDERMANE ET AL. |2369

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License

2.2.3 |Phenomenological responses to sounds
This task is written up as a separate study (Andermane et al., 2023 ), with the detailed methodology including
stimulus creation described in the pre ‐registration ( https://osf.io/27fgv/ ). This task is an extension of prior research
in which misophonics are presented with a range of sounds and asked to rate them for discomfort (Edelstein et al.,2013 ; Hansen et al., 2021 ). The sound clips lasted 15 s each and belonged to four different categories, with 8
sounds per category (human oral ‐nasal, other human, nonhuman, and scrambled sounds). The key innovation in our
task was to obtain a multivariate profile of responses across 17 descriptors (e.g., pain, rage, disgust and soothing)
when listening to 32 sound clips.
2.2.4 |AQ
The AQ is 50 ‐item questionnaire comprising five subscales: attention switching, attention to detail, communication,
imagination, and social skill. The scores on each subscale can range from 1 to 10 (Baron ‐Cohen et al., 2001 ).
Example items include “I would rather go to a library than a party ”and “I enjoy doing things spontaneously ”(reverse
coded). Responses are given on a 4 ‐point scale (Definitely disagree, Slightly disagree, Slightly agree, and Definitely
agree) and recoded as 1 or 0 depending on whether the trait resembles an autistic behavior or not. The Cronbach'salpha reliability of the AQ in our sample was 0.85.
2.2.5 |The GSQ
The GSQ is a 42 ‐item questionnaire with the total score ranging from 0 to 168 (Robertson & Simmons, 2013 ). Items
covering seven sense domains ( visual ,auditory ,gustatory ,olfactory ,tactile ,vestibular, proprioception ) with half of all
items measuring Hyper ‐sensitivity (e.g., “Do you hate the feeling or texture of certain foods in your mouth? ”) and half
measuring hypo ‐sensitivity (e.g., “Do you enjoy wearing very strong perfumes/after ‐shaves? ”). Responses are given
on a 5 ‐point scale coded from 0 to 4 (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, and Always). The Cronbach's alpha reliability
of the GSQ in our sample was 0.90.
2.2.6 |The ASI ‐3
The ASI ‐3 includes 18 questions that are divided in three subscales: Cognitive, Physical, and Social (Taylor et al.,
2007 ). Example items include “I worry that other people will notice my anxiety ”(Social) and “When I have trouble
thinking clearly, I worry that there is something wrong with me. ”(Cognitive). Responses are given on a 5 ‐point scale
from 0 to 4 (Very little, A little, Some, Much, Very much). The scores on each subscale can range from 0 to 24 and
the total score from 0 to 72. The Cronbach's alpha reliability of the ASI ‐3 total in our sample was 0.93. The ASI was
chosen over alternative measures (e.g., STAI State ‐Trait Anxiety Index, Spielberger et al., 1983 ) because the division
into three factors fitted well with the symptom ‐level approach of this study but with the caveat that this may be
capturing anxiety ‐related processes rather than longer ‐term history of clinical anxiety.
2.2.7 |The MAIA
The MAIA is a 32 ‐item questionnaire that assesses interoceptive abilities or bodily awareness relating to distinct
aspects of embodied experience (Mehling et al., 2012 ). It consists of eight subscales: Noticing (4 items), Not2370 |ANDERMANE ET AL.
 10974679, 2023, 10, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jclp.23552, Wiley Online Library on [26/02/2024]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License

Distracting (3 items), Not Worrying (2 items), Attention Regulation (7 items), Emotional Awareness (5 items), Self ‐
Regulation (4 items), Body Listening (3 items), and Trusting (3 items). Examples include items such as “I listen to my
body to inform me about what to do ”(Body Listening) and “I notice when I am uncomfortable in my body ”
(Noticing). The items are rated on a scale from 0 to 5 (from Never to Always) and the subscale scores are calculated
by computing the average score in each. Five items were reverse ‐scored. The Cronbach's alpha reliability of the
total MAIA score in our sample was 0.92.
2.2.8 |OCI
The OCI (Foa et al., 1998 )i sa4 2 ‐item questionnaire assessing the experiences that characterize the obsessive ‐
compulsive disorder (e.g., “Unpleasant thoughts come into my mind against my will and I cannot get rid of them ”or
“I check things more often than necessary ”). The items are rated on a 5 ‐point scale rated from 0 to 4 (Not at all, A
little, Moderately, A lot, Extremely) and the total score ranges from 0 to 168. The 42 items form seven subscales,
which are based on symptom categories that are commonly found in obsessive –compulsive disorder: Checking (9
items), Washing (8 items), Obsessing (8 items), Mental Neutralizing (6 items), Ordering (5 items), Hoarding (3 items),
and Doubting (3 items). The Cronbach's αreliability of the OCI in our sample was 0.96.
2.2.9 |Migraine and headache (POEM)
The POEM covers the experience of migraines and headaches (Kaiser et al., 2019 ). The questionnaire has a
branching logic, such that some questions are conditional on particular responses to other questions. The questions
pertain to headache history, including headache duration, frequency and severity, as well as asking about particular
headache types, headache triggers, and whether the headaches are accompanied by other symptoms (e.g.,sensitivity to light and sound, visual experiences or aura). Based on their responses, participants are classified into
one of seven categories: headache ‐free (HA ‐free), mild non ‐migrainous headache (MNMH), headache not
otherwise specified (NOS), migraine without aura (MwoA), migraine with visual aura, and migraine with other aura,and migraine with both visual and other aura (the latter three belonging to the broader migraine with aura (MWA)category). The POEM is moderately sensitive (i.e., 42% −83% sensitivity) but is highly specific (i.e., 84% −100%) in
identifying subjects as HA ‐free (those that are headache free or with mild MNMH), as well as those with migraines
without aura, or migraines with aura.
2.2.10 |Visual sensitivity: Pattern glare task
This task of visual sensitivity was based on previous studies on visual stress (Evans & Stevenson, 2008 ; Fong et al.,
2019 ). Participants are asked to view black and white parallel lines of various spatial frequencies (low, middle, and
high) for 12 s, and then to rate the discomfort and reactions experienced when viewing these gratings (on 19
descriptors, see below). The stimuli were created by Braithwaite et al. ( 2013 ) and consisted of black and white
alternating horizontal stripes presented in an oval window around a small fixation point and against a mid ‐gray (RGB
128,128,128) background. The low ‐, mid ‐, and high ‐spatial frequency stimuli comprised of 4.5, 31.5, and 130 cycles
(i.e., stripes) and were always presented centrally at their actual resolution of 652 × 500 pixels. When viewed at an
appropriate distance this corresponds to around 0.4, 3.0, and 12.4 cycles per degree (1° being around 40 pixels).
Given that the blind spot has a known eccentricity of 12 −15°, one can use this to calibrate a viewing distance by
making two red dots located at 480 and 600 pixels (12 −15° ×40 pixels) “disappear ”—a form of “virtual chinrest ”(Li
et al., 2020 ). Participants were asked to close their left eye and stare at a central fixation cross. There were two redANDERMANE ET AL. |2371

dots, positioned to the right of fixation, and participants were instructed to move their head backwards and
forwards until both dots disappeared. At this point, participants were instructed to open both eyes and remain atthis approximate distance to the screen.
Our stimuli are known to trigger “glare ”at medium and high (but not low) spatial frequency. This glare takes a number
of different forms from person to person (e.g., lines appear to shimmer, or bend, or blur etc.; see below), and we provided
19 such descriptors which participants rated using a visua l analog scale with slider values ranging from 0 to 100. An
exploratory factor analysis (EFA) based on a separate no rmative sample (see the preregistered analyses on OSF: https://
osf.io/qpv7d ) revealed the presence of two factors that we refer to a s Visual Distortions (comprising the descriptors:
Illusory stripes, Bending of lines, Faint lines, Shadowy shapes, Shimmering, and Flickering) and Somatic Discomfort(comprising the descriptors: Headache, Unease, Nausea, Lighthe adedness, Dizziness, Visual pain , Physical eye strain, Jitter,
and Zooming). Factor scores were derived by averaging the res ponses across the relevant items for each spatial frequency
(noting that two descriptors were n ot retained after factor analyses: “Colors ”and “Blur”).
2.3 |Analysis plan
2.3.1 |Cluster analysis based on the SMS
A cluster analysis is a data ‐driven approach to identifying g r o u p so fp a r t i c i p a n t s( J a i n , 2010 ). This approach is considered
appropriate given that misophonia may well show sub ‐classes (e.g., differing by severity or symptom profile) even though
there is currently no commonly agreed taxonomy for identify ing them. We therefore ran an an alysis that would allow us to
stratify our sample into sub ‐groups, beyond a simple dichotomy of presence/ absence of misophonia. For this analysis, the
dependent variables were the scores of the five factors of the SM S (i.e., feelings/isolation, life consequences, intersocial
reactivity, avoidance/repulsion, and pain), here converted to z ‐scores to ensure they are on the same scale (given the
differing numbers of items within each factor). In theory, th is type of approach could identify a subgroup of misophonics
who are high on, for example, factors 1, 2 and 3 versus another subgroup high on 4 and 5. A two ‐step cluster analysis was
performed (Zhang et al., 1996 ). The first step involves hi erarchical clustering, using Ward's method (Ward, 1963 ), and
serves the purpose of identifying a plausi ble number of clusters and generating an in itial set of cluster centroids (i.e. group
means across the five factors). The seco nd step involves a nonhierarchical k ‐m e a n sa n a l y s i sw i t h5 0i t e r a t i o n s ,w h i c h
generates a final set of centroids and classifies each particip ant in one of the groups. Extracting three or more groups offers
a way of exploring stratification beyond a simple dichotomy o f presence/absence of misophonia and allows us to explore
how participants might differ in their expression of misophonia.
2.3.2 |Inferential statistics
The questionnaires with continuous dependent variables (AQ, GSQ, OCI, MAIA, and ASI ‐3) were analyzed as mixed
linear models ( ttests, analysis of variance [ANOVA]) with participant group as a between ‐subject independent
variable. Following the cluster analysis, the participants were grouped in three groups: nonmisophonic, moderate
misophonia, and severe misophonia. Subscale was an additional independent variable (e.g., the AQ comprises five
subscales). When appropriate, we applied post hoc one ‐way ANOVAs on each variable and Tukey HSD or
Dunnett's T3 comparisons to identify group differences depending, respectively, on whether equal variances areassumed or not (as indicated by the Levene's test). Categorical dependent variables (e.g., for headache data in the
POEM) are analyzed via chi ‐square against group membership. To account for multiple comparisons, we employed
false discovery rate (FDR, Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995 ) on the set of pvalues for the group differences.
Effect sizes (Cohen's d) and Bayes factors are calculated for each measure separately. Bayes factors are
computed using the Dienes ( 2014 ) calculator implemented in R. The observed data for calculating Bayes factors is2372 |ANDERMANE ET AL.

the difference in means between the groups and the standard error (SE) of the difference. The prior was modeled
using the room ‐to‐move heuristic (Dienes, 2019 ). This heuristic makes the assumption that small group differences
are more probable than larger differences and, moreover, that the ceiling of any such difference is the ceiling of the
scale itself. Specifically, the distance between the non ‐misophonic mean and the scale ceiling is operationalized as
two standard deviations of the half ‐normal.
2.3.3 |Symptom network modeling
We included 31 nodes in the model, one for each of the following symptoms (e.g., scale factors): SMS ( N=5 ) ,A Q( N=5 ) ,
GSQ ( N= 1, i.e., taking the overall score), OCI ( N=7 ) , M A I A ( N=8 ) , A S I ‐3(N= 3), and visual pattern glare responses to
medium spatial frequency stimuli ( N= 2). As these scales are continuous data, a Gaussian Graphical Model was used. This
was conducted in R using the qgraph package with the c ode and data made public. The model also contains “edges, ”which
are the connections between nodes (symptoms), and are partia l correlations estimated by pairwise random Markov fields
(Epskamp et al., 2012 ). For example, an edge between the symptoms of anx iety sensitivity and sensory sensitivity would
represent the connection between these symptoms in terms of t heir partial correlations in our data. Model selection was
based on EBIC (Extended Bayesian Inform ation Criteria) and the default gamma parameter of 0.5 (which controls how
sparse the model is so not all noes are fully connected). The graphical LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator) is applied for regularization, that is, to reduce over ‐fitting, using the R glasso packag e. This shrinks all coefficients
in a systematic way and sets small ones to zero (Friedman et al., 2008 ).
After the network has been estimated, the robustness and stability was explored following the guidelines of
Epskamp et al. ( 2018 ). This was conducted in R using the bootnet package with N= 1000 bootstrapped resamples
taken. This ultimately replaces a single weight estimate for each edge with a distribution of weights for each edge
from which other metrics can be derived: that is, each edge is a distribution of partial correlations and not a single
partial correlation. The extent to which a node is central and can be calculated by summing the edges (partialcorrelations) emanating out of each node, and it is possible to observe how stable these measures are to changes in
the sample. The CS ‐coefficient (Centrality Stability) was computed with the corStability function. This measures
whether the order of the node centrality (ranked from most to least central) is stable after observing only portionsof the bootstrapped data. If the network properties change substantially when dropping only a small number ofparticipants, then the model is unstable. This is based on a correlation between the original and reduced datasets of
at least r= 0.7 (the size of the reduced data set to achieve this correlation is estimated). Secondly, the function
bootInclude returns a probability (0 −1) that an edge will be present (i.e., weighted above zero) or absent in the
bootstrapped models. A stable network would have edges that are consistently present and consistently absent.
3|RESULTS
3.1 |Cluster analysis of SMS
Recall that participants were a ssigned into three groups (non –misophonic, moderate misophonia, and severe misophonia)
based on their factor scores on the SMS (rather than the recruitment stream) which were entered into a cluster analysis.Visual inspection of the dendrogram (see Supporting Informa tion Results) suggested the ext raction of a small number of
groups (2 or 3). However, if we limit our clustering to a two ‐group solution, this adds little more value than the original
diagnostic cut ‐offs established via ROC curves (Rinaldi et al., 2021 ). A three ‐group solution to the cluster analysis
generated groups who were low, medium, and high across al l five factors of the SMS. These became our three groups,
respectively, and the outcome of the cluster analysis can be seen in Table 1(where z‐scores are more informative because
they act as a common scale) with the full sample ( N= 1430). Specifically, the two group ss c o r i n gh i g h e s tt e n d e dt oc o m eANDERMANE ET AL. |2373

from the self ‐referred misophonic stream1, and generally met the diagnostic threshold for misophonia (a score > 50.5
established by using a ROC analysis of the total SMS score; Rinaldi et al., 2021 ). Indeed, 84% in the moderate misophonia
group and 100% of the severe misophonia group crossed this diagnostic threshold, while 0% of the non ‐misophonic group
crossed it. The top two groups (i.e., moderate/severe misophonia) also tended to self ‐report misophonia in the hearing
q u e s t i o n n a i r e( 9 1 %i nt h em o d e r a t eg r o u pa n d9 8 %i ns e v e r eg r o u p ,c o m p a r e dt o0 %i nt h en o n ‐misophonia group). The
SMS total scores have also previously contrasted with a c ommonly used measure of misophonia severity, the MQ (Wu
et al., 2014 ), where an SMS total score > 50.5 corresponds to a moderate score of ≥7 on the MQ (Rinaldi et al., 2021 ), with
severe scores on the MQ ( ≥10) linked to total SMS scores > 80 (see figure in Supporting Information: Results). As such, our
designation of “Moderate ”and “Severe ”is in line with the nomenclature of other misophonia studies. The three groups did
not differ significantly according to gender but the misophonic groups tended to be older (F(2, 418) = 16.309, p< 0.001),
which likely reflects the different recruitment sources (many non –misophonics were recruited from a University sample).
The Supporting Information Material shows a repe at of our analyses with closer demographically ‐matched samples (albeit
a smaller N) and demonstrates that the key findings are not confounded by this.
In summary, a cluster analysis of misophonia scores (from the SMS questionnaire) points toward three groups
that show a quantitative overall difference of misophonia in terms of symptom severity rather than a differentprofile across the five factors. Put differently, we do not see double dissociations among the z scores (e.g., one
group high on factors 1, 2, 3, and another group high on factors 4 and 5) or even simple dissociations (e.g., one
group high on four factors, and another high on all five factors). Further explorations show that the same trend (i.e.,grouping based on severity) is found when extracting four groups (see Supporting Information Materials). The sametrend is also found if factors that are highly correlated ( r> 0.7) are combined together before the analysis (as
specified in our preregistration). Ultimately, the utility of any stratification in misophonia can be judged by its ability
to predict other measures and real ‐life behavior. The results reported below show exactly this: the three ‐group
solution (i.e., two misophonic groups differing in symptom severity plus nonmisophonics) does indeed provide
important new information about clinical comorbidities.
3.2 |Hearing questionnaire
The three groups differed significantly in their ratings for all the hearing ‐related conditions ( p< 0.05), as shown in
Figure 1, with full details of the one ‐way ANOVAs and post hoc t‐tests reported in Supporting Information Materi-
als. Most group differences were between the non ‐misophonics and the other groups, but differences amongst
misophonics (moderate vs. severe) were found for hyperacusis ( p= 0.005) and phonophobia ( p< 0.001).
Professional help ‐seeking was generally low for all conditions, although the groups also differed significantly
here too across the board ( p< 0.05). The sizeable difference between help ‐seeking in severe and moderate
misophonia groups (22% vs. 6%) provides further external validity to the SMS and the notion of real ‐word
differences between misophonic groups beyond a single diagnostic cut ‐off.
3.3 |Clinical comorbidities
Part 2 of the study assessed comorbidities and sensory sensitivity. The comorbidities that we considered are
anxiety sensitivity (measured by the ASI ‐3), autism spectrum traits (measured by the AQ), obsessive ‐compulsive
tendencies (measured by the OCI), and migraines/headaches (measured by the POEM). The results are summarized
in Figure 2(overall scores) and Figure 3shows the effect sizes broken down by subscale (with means and SDs for
subscale scores in the Supporting Information Materials).
For the AQ, there were significant main effects of group ( F(2, 416) = 10.69, p< 0.001, η2= 0.05), subscale
(F(4, 1664) = 188.54, p< 0.001, η2= 0.31), and a significant group X subscale interaction ( F(8, 1664) = 2.569,2374 |ANDERMANE ET AL.

p< 0.001, η2= 0.01). Post ‐hoc analyses showed significant group effects for social skills ( F(2, 416) = 3.76, p= 0.024,
η2= 0.02), attention to detail ( F(2, 416) = 17.10, p< 0.001, η2= 0.08), and communication ( F(2, 416) = 7.46,
p< 0.001, η2= 0.04). Neither attention switching nor imagination were linked to significant group differences
(F(2, 416) = 2.91, p= 0.056, η2= 0.01, and F(2, 416) = 2.76, p= 0.065, η2= 0.01, respectively). Post hoc pairwise
comparisons showed that all three groups differed from each other on attention ‐to‐detail (severe vs. moderate:
p= 0.034; severe vs. non –misophonics: p< 0.001, moderate v. non ‐misophonics: p= 0.008) but the differences
on social and communication subscales were driven by severe misophonics (social: severe vs. non –misophonics
p= 0.025; communication: severe vs. non –misophonics p< 0.001, severe vs. moderate p= 0.016).

For the ASI ‐3, there were significant main effects of group ( F(2, 416) = 8.06, p< 0.001, η2= 0.04) and subscale
(F(2, 832) = 73.66, p< 0.001, η2= 0.15), but no significant group X subscale interaction ( F(4, 832) = 1.97, p= 0.10,
η2= 0.01). Post ‐hoc tests, combining subscale scores, showed that severe misophonics differed significantly from
moderates and non ‐misophonics (both p= 0.001), with the latter groups not differing significantly ( p= 0.867).
For the OCI, there were significant main effects of group ( F(2, 416) = 6.84, p= 0.001, η2= 0.03) and subscale ( F
(6, 2496) = 117.38, p< 0.001, η2= 0.22), and a significant group X subscale interaction ( F(12, 2496) = 2.09, p=
0.015, η2= 0.01). Post hoc analyses showed significant group differences in five subscales (washing, checking,
obsessing, ordering, doubting) which, in all cases, were due to significant differences between severe misophonicsand non ‐misophonics ( p= 0.004, 0.025, 0.045, <0.001, and 0.002 respectively), with no significant differences
between moderate misophonics and non ‐misophonics. The difference between severe and moderate groups was
significant for checking and ordering ( p= 0.026 and 0.031, respectively).
The POEM classifies individuals according to how they exper ience headaches in distinct classifications (see above).
One category, nonvisual aura, was rare in iso lation (generating expected counts < 5 in the χ
2) so these cases was excluded
from the analysis. Among the remaining categories, the associ ation between participant group and headache category was

significant, χ2(10, N= 403) = 21.54, p= 0.018. The severe misophonic grou p were more likely than the other two
participant groups to experience migraines with aura (and less likely to have mild MNMH). Pairwise, severe misophonicsdiffered from non ‐misophonics ( χ
2(5,N= 293) = 16.22, p= 0.006) but moderate misophonics did not differ significantly
from either the severe or non ‐misophonic groups ( χ2(5,N= 297) = 6.67, p=0 . 2 4 6 a n d χ2(5,N= 216) = 7.94, p=0 . 1 6 0 ) .
In summary, our research confirms findings of comorbidities b etween misophonia and autistic traits (Rinaldi, Simner,
et al., 2022 ), anxiety sensitivity (Cusack et al., 2018 ), and obsessive ‐compulsive tendencies (Norris et al., 2022 ). We show,
for the first time, a link between misophonia and MWA. The key n ovel contribution of our research is to show that clinical
comorbidities are linked to the severity of misophonia rathe r than to misophonia status per se. We find only one trait that
shows a significant difference linked to both groups of mis ophonia (moderate and severe) and this is unusual in that it
relates to a cognitive ability rather than a problem/deficit (attention ‐to‐detail from the AQ).
3.4 |Sensory sensitivity
Our measures of sensory sensitivity consisted of questionnaires examining hyper ‐and hypo ‐sensitivity in seven
different senses (the GSQ), as well as interoceptive awareness/sensibility (the MAIA), together with a test of visual
stress (the Pattern Glare task).
For the GSQ scores, a one ‐way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant difference between groups, F(2,
416) = 24.16, p<0 . 0 0 1 , η2= 0.10, driven by differences between severe mi sophonics. The other two groups did not differ.
For exploratory analyses (not preregistered), the GS Q can also be broken down by se nsory modality and hyper ‐versus
hypo ‐sensitivity (over and under ‐responsiveness to incoming sensory informa tion, respectively). This is summarized, as
Cohen's d effect sizes, in Figure 4.F o rG S Qh y p e r ‐sensitivities, there were signi ficant main effects of group, ( F(2,
416) = 49.97, p<0 . 0 0 1 , η2=0 . 0 7 ) , m o d a l i t y ( F(6, 2496) = 374, p< 0.001, η2= 0.30), and a significant group X modality
interaction ( F(12, 2496) = 16.40, p<0 . 0 0 1 , η2= 0.03). Post hoc analyses showed significant group differences in most
Hypersensitivity subscales (Visual, Audit ory, Gustatory, Olfactory, Tactile, and V estibular) which were due to significant
differences between participants with severe misophonia and non ‐misophonics across all modalities ( pvalues of <0.001,
<0.001, <0.001, 0.001, 0.019, and <0.001, respectively). Par ticipants with moderate misophonia were also significantly

different from non ‐misophonics in terms of Auditory and Olfactory hypersensitivity ( p<0.001 and 0.002 respectively;
individual auditory hyper ‐sensitivity questions are analyzed in the Suppo rting Information Results). Additionally,
participants with moderate misophonia were significantly d ifferent from the severe group across all modalities. The
groups also differed significantly on hyposensitivity ( F(2, 416) = 6.52, p=0 . 0 0 2 , η2= 0.03), with marginally higher scores for
severe misophonics relative to non –misophonics ( p= 0.073) and significantly higher scores for severe misophonics relative
to moderate misophonics ( p=0 . 0 0 1 ) .
For the MAIA, there was no significant main effect of group ( F(2, 416) = 2.21, p= 0.111, η2= 0.01) and no
significant group X subscale interaction ( F(14, 2912) = 1.536, p= 0.090, η2= 0.01). The effect of subscale was
significant ( F(7, 2912) = 67.48, p< 0.001, η2= 0.14). This lack of difference in the interoceptive domain stands in
contrast to the differences observed for exteroceptive senses. Post hoc group comparisons of groups are not
reported due to lack of significant group effects. The Supporting Information Material reports individual subscales
for completeness and alternative ways of grouping them.
Recall that the Pattern Glare task consists of three visual stim uli varying in spatial frequency (low, mid, and high), with a
series of 17 descriptions (e.g., shimmer) broken into two diffe rent factors (somatic discomfort, visual distortions). These
acted as repeated measures in a 3 x 2 x 3 mixed ANOVA, with participant group as a between ‐subjects factor with three
levels (non –misophonic, moderate misophonia, and severe misophonia), crossed with descriptor factor (somatic and visual),
and spatial frequency of the grating (low, middle, and high spatial frequency). In previous literature, low spatial frequencies
of visual gratings are not linked to visually induced stress and act here as a “sanity check ”(e.g., to ensure we do not have

both the mid ‐and high ‐spatial frequency conditions, which is confirmed by the analysis. There was a main effect of
participant group ( F(2, 388) = 7.07, p< 0.001, η2= 0.02), a main effect of spatial frequency ( F(2, 388) = 138.77, p<0 . 0 0 1 ,
η2= 0.07), and a main effect of descriptor factor ( F(1, 388) = 204.27, p< 0.001, η2= 0.07). There was also a group x spatial
frequency interaction ( F(4, 776) = 4.49, p=0 . 0 0 1 , η2= 0.004), such that the groups differed in terms of their ratings in the
different spatial frequencies; and a significant inter action between spatial frequ ency and descriptor factor ( F(4,
776) = 67.38, p<0 . 0 0 1 , η2= 0.02), such that the different spatial frequencies were rated differently depending on which
descriptor factor they belonged to. There was no significant three ‐way interaction. Post hoc analyses of the group x spatial
frequency interaction were performed (collapsing the visual and somatic factors by averaging the two scores). The three
participant groups differed significantly at high ( F(2, 389) = 8.90, p<0 . 0 0 1 , η2=0 . 0 4 ) a n d m i d d l e ( F(2, 389) = 4.83, p=

differences were driven by the severe misophonia group in these two spatial frequency conditions.
3.5 |Bayes factors and multiple comparisons
Considering the N= 7 main effects of group (AQ, ASI, OCI, POEM, GSQ, MAIA, and Pattern Glare) all except the
MAIA were significant, and these six significant results survive correction for multiple comparisons using FDR.
Bayes Factors were computed at the level of scale and subscale ( N= 36 variables) and reported in full in the
Supporting Information Material. Comparing the moderate misophonia group against non ‐misophonics there were
two sensitive (BF > 3) rejections of the null for AQ attention ‐to‐detail and GSQ hypersensitivity (with almost all
other results being sensitive null results of BF < 1/3). Comparing the severe misophonia group against non ‐
misophonics there were thirteen sensitive (BF > 3) rejections of the null for AQ total score, AQ attention ‐to‐detail,
AQ communication, GSQ total score, GSQ hyper ‐sensitivity, GSQ hypo ‐sensitivity, ASI total score, ASI physical

3.6 |Symptom network modeling
Figure 6shows the modeled symptom network based on partial correlations using the pre ‐registered dependent variables.
For this approach, we no longer make use of three different gr oups but instead directly model the SMS factor scores as
continuous variables (noting that our previous three gr oups are ranked by severity using the same factors, so is
conceptually similar). In interpreting the model, we advise the reader that any nonzero weighted association can beinterpreted as making a significant contribution to the mode l. The thickness of the lines indicates the strength of the
association measured as partial correlations (these numeri c values are provided in Supporting Information Results along
with exploratory, not preregistered, networks that yield si milar results). The spatial separation of the symptoms, for
visualization purposes, is also based on t he strength of association ignoring wheth er the partial correlation is positive or
negative (termed a spring layout; Kamada & Kawai, 1989 ). Symptoms known to belong to the same construct (e.g.,
different subscales of the AQ) tend to associate together and this is to be expected if the construct is meaningful (a ‘clique ’
in network terms occurs when a set of node s is fully interconnected as happens here for SMS with other constructs being
near ‐cliques). There are notable exceptions. The AQ Attention ‐to‐detail (but not other AQ subsca les) has significant partial
correlations to the Ordering and Hoarding subscales of the O CI which results in it being placed closer to the OCI than to
other AQ subscales in the diagram. A simila r mismatched pattern emerges for the Not ‐Distracting subscale of the MAIA
(e.g., “I try to ignore pain ”), which negatively connects with other constructs such as GSQ and OCI ‐Doubting and is perhaps
conceptually more related to a ttention than interoception.
There are several measures of centrality which give an indication of the relative importance of a symptom in
the network (see Figure 7). First, degree centrality sums all the connection strengths emanating from each symptom
(ignoring sign). This means that symptoms with a higher degree centrality either have more links than others, or a

Comorbidities can be understood, in this approach, throughmutual influence of associated symptoms (which spread throughout the network).2380 |ANDERMANE ET AL.

FIGURE 7 Different measure of centrality. Top: Betweenness centrality measures the extent to which a node

smaller number of very strong links. Second, bridge centrality is mathematically equivalent to degree centrality
except that it selects only those weights between (not within) different measures (Jones et al., 2021 ): in Figure 6we
can think of it in terms of summing only the connections between different colored circles. Third, betweenness
centrality is related to how many shortest paths between all pairs pass through a given symptom: an analogy is that
the shortest path between two cities in the United Kingdom, in terms of rail connections, is often via London (i.e.,London has very high betweenness centrality). To calculate betweenness centrality, every pair in the network isconsidered and one counts how many times a node can interrupt the shortest path between the two nodes of the
pair. The GSQ (sensory sensitivity) occupies a key position in the symptom network on all counts (see below), and
this is maintained even if sensory sensitivity it is split into separate hyper ‐and hypo ‐sensitivity variables (see
Supporting Information Results). Within the five SMS subscales, the one with the highest bridge and betweenness
centrality is Pain. Summing connections between the SMS and the different AQ subscales we find the strongest link
to attention ‐to‐detail. The overall results of the network simulation support the conclusion that comorbidities
linked to misophonia occur primarily via sensory ‐attentional symptoms that are themselves transdiagnostic (i.e.,
linked to constructs such as autism, OCD, and anxiety). This finding is not trivial insofar as there were other
plausible outcomes that could have emerged. For example, social ‐based symptoms (the social subscales of the AQ,
SMS, MAIA, etc.) could intuitively have formed a central clique but did not.
The network model was explored following a bootstrap analysis, in which participants are randomly sampled
with replacement. The bootstrapped CS ‐coefficient was 0.75 where a value greater than 0.5 is considered good and
a value less than 0.25 is poor. This means that up to 75% of cases could be dropped and one would still obtain acorrelation of 0.7 (the recommended value of Epskamp et al., 2018 ) between the original and reduced datasets (in
terms of degree centrality estimates). This is akin to a post ‐hoc power analysis because it determines whether the
actual sample size is adequate to achieve network stability.
Further, post hoc, explorations of the network were conducted and summarized here (see Supporting
Information Materials for full details). The GSQ continues to occupy a central position even after all auditory items
are removed. In this revised model, the strongest connections from the SMS are still to the GSQ with AQ attention ‐
to‐detail as a second bridge symptom (both emanating from the SMS Pain factor). We also reran an exploratory
network analysis dividing our sample into misophonics and non –misophonics (taking the groups derived from the
earlier cluster analysis) and show that the overall network structure is similar. One potentially important differenceis that the bridge symptom linking misophonia (the SMS subscales) to the remaining network shifts from theAvoidance subscale (considering non ‐misophonics alone) to Pain (misophonics alone, and in the combined sample).
This suggests a transition from aversion to sensitization along the misophonia spectrum.
4|DISCUSSION
In the present study we aimed to characterize the perceptual, affective, and cognitive profile of individuals who
experience misophonia, a type of aversive emotional and physiological reaction to classes of everyday sounds (e.g.,
human ‐made or repetitive). We also set out to explore whether misophonia can be categorized into distinct
subgroups, and if so, whether groups of misophonics tend to differ quantitatively or qualitatively in the severity of
their experience, as well as their sensory sensitivities and the tendency for clinical traits. The associations between
our variables were modeled using a symptom network approach to identify how these are related.
We used a validated measure, the SMS (Rinaldi et al., 2021 ), to identify symptoms and traits of misophonia. For
the present research this measure has the advantage of having five factors, which can capture heterogeneity in
symptoms. Importantly, its questions were written to be understandable to people without misophonia and can
therefore also be modeled as a continuous variable (spectrum). Our cluster analysis revealed that our sample ofparticipants can be categorized into three groups, based on their standardized scores on the five factors of the SMS.
The groups were distinguished by the severity of misophonia: the upper two groups largely self ‐identified as having2382 |ANDERMANE ET AL.

misophonia and would exceed the threshold value for diagnosing misophonia from the SMS (i.e., when a single
score is calculated across all factors). The third group would fall below the threshold of SMS and compriseparticipants who were recruited as controls and who do not self ‐identify as misophonic. Whereas other studies
have noted the continuous nature of misophonia symptoms using other measures (Edelstein et al., 2013 ;W u
et al., 2014 ), here we have shown that three distinct groupings fall out from a cluster analysis. Crucially, these three
groups also show differences in their sensory sensitivity profile and clinical traits.
The group we classed as moderate misophonia are similar to the non ‐misophonic group on most measures (i.e.,
anxiety, migraine, pattern glare, obsessive ‐compulsive traits, and most AQ subscales) but are nevertheless different
in some important ways (i.e., AQ attention to detail, GSQ hyper ‐sensitivity in auditory and olfactory modalities, and
hearing comorbidities such as hyperacusis). In effect, there are multiple transitions in symptom profile that coincide
with increasing misophonia severity. The moderate group, while still being “misophonic ”(i.e., experiencing its
negative impact in important ways), will not necessarily all have clinical needs , in the sense that they can likely
function in life without external intervention. The fact that the moderate group often lack comorbidities (sensitive
null results) suggests that these comorbidities are not a primary cause of misophonia, although they may play a role
in the transition to a more severe profile. Those in the severe group are likely to be at a higher clinical symptomlevel, both in terms of their misophonia itself but also from their wider clinical profile. A recent study also applied
clustering methods in misophonia and, like our study, identified three groups differing in severity (including one
without misophonia) but, unlike our study, found more clinical comorbidities in the moderate group (Norriset al., 2022 ). There are multiple differences between the studies that may have affected the results. In our study,
the clustering was based on the misophonia profile alone (with other measures acting as independent tests of the
clusters) whereas Norris et al. ( 2022 ) derived their clusters from a mix of misophonia and clinical measures. Our
study used purposive sampling (explicitly targeting misophonics of different severity levels) whereas Norris et al.(2022 ) used opportunity sampling (from the general population) such that people with clinically significant
misophonia were a minority in all of their clusters (0.8%, 18.6%, and 33.3%). Thus, it is hard to be certain of the
extent to which their cluster differences are directly attributable to misophonia.
Our symptom network model showed that some symptoms/t raits are closely connected to misophonia while others
are more distant. In terms of our groups, we can think of this in terms of severe misophonia having a wider reach within
the network, and moderate misophonia having a more local symptom profile. The key statistical innovation of the
symptom network is its use of partial correlations over regular correlations. Thus, in a three ‐symptom network A ↔B↔C,
the correlation between A and C would be close to 1 and the p artial correlation would be close to 0. Having a sparser
network model is also achieved through a process called regul arization (where weak connections are forced to zero) with
the degree of regularization itself based on the goodness of fi t of model to data (using EBIC, Extended Bayesian Inference
Criteria) (Epskamp et al., 2018 ). Sparser models, fit to a statistically optimal c riteria, help us to understand the relationship
between symptoms. But it is not a causal model. In parti cular, we cannot conclude that misophonia causes the
comorbidities or vice versa, but we can conclude that closer and stronger connections have greater mutual influence over
each other. Specifically, the main bridge between misophonia and other clinical symptoms appears to be via sensory
sensitivity. This includes auditory sensory sensitivity but is not limited to it, and it is important to note that the auditory
questions in the GSQ hypersensitivit y subscale are not necessarily asking about misophonia itself (e.g., “Do you react very
strongly when you hear an unexpected sound?, ”“Do you dislike loud noises? ”). As a limitation of our network model, it is
conceivable that sensory sensitivity ceases to be central when other important, but presently omitted, symptoms are
added (Neal et al., 2022 ). However, we made reasonable efforts to in clude a set of symptoms based on our current
knowledge of the field.
Increased sensory sensitivity may lead to the experience of pain and affective (emotional) dysregulation,
corresponding to anxiety and other clinical traits. However, the exact mechanism is yet to be fully explained. Other
researchers have proposed that in misophonia there is an increased sensory (auditory cortex) functionalconnectivity to anterior insula, which represents interoceptive maps and moment ‐to‐moment general emotional
wellbeing of the individual (Kumar et al., 2017 ; McGeoch & Rouw,
2020 ). This increased connectivity may be theANDERMANE ET AL. |2383

neural mechanism that is formed when associations between auditory input and negative valence emotions are
learned (McGeoch & Rouw, 2020 ). In our research individual differences linked to interoceptive awareness (as
measured by the self ‐report MAIA, Mehling et al., 2012 ) were not strongly related to misophonia. It is possible that
alternative measures of interoception (e.g., Garfinkel et al., 2015 ; Garfinkel et al., 2016 ; Miller et al., 1981 ) will be
more strongly related to misophonia. It is also possible that it is the production of autonomic responses to soundsthat is atypical in misophonia, rather than the ability to sense them (via interoception).
Previous observations in misophonia have noted the presence of visual triggers (e.g., repetitive actions) but it is
unclear whether this can be related to visual sensitivity per se or the fact that these actions imply a sound (Edelstein
et al., 2013 ). Our research provides the most compelling evidence, to date, that misophonia is linked to visual
sensitivity, at least in the more severe cases. This is manifested in terms of reports of migraine (specifically for
MWA) and in terms of both somatic reactions and visual distortions to aversive striped patterns. These two
observations —migraine and pattern glare —are known to be linked (see Marcus & Soso, 1989 ; Wilkins et al., 1984 )
and have a shared putative neural mechanism of increased (visual) cortical excitability (Hibbard & O'Hare, 2015 ;
Huang et al., 2003 ). That is, it need not be the case that misophonia causes migraine, or vice versa, but that both are
different clinical outcomes of a common mechanism (increased cortical excitability). A stronger influence of thismechanism may give rise to stronger symptom severity and increased chances of co ‐morbidity as multiple brain
systems become affected.
To summarize, severe misophonia differs from moderate misophonia not only in terms of quantitative
differences in symptom severity (i.e., SMS factor scores) but also qualitatively in the perceptual and clinical traits ofthese groups. Specifically, severe misophonics differ from moderates in the breadth of sounds that are reported as
triggers, in a broader profile of sensory sensitivities (i.e., visual, tactile), elevated clinical traits (autism spectrum,
anxiety sensitivity, and obsessive ‐compulsive traits), a greater tendency to have migraines and experience other
hearing related issues (e.g., hyperacusis). Notably, moderate misophonics did not differ from controls in terms of
clinical traits. From this comparison of misophonia subgroups, it appears that elevated sensory sensitivity and
associated pain ‐like experiences in response to sensory stimuli may be the primary cause for the aversive effects of
misophonia on mental health and life consequences of the severe group. This is in line with our network analyses,
showing that sensory sensitivity is the central trait, connecting to the misophonic experiences (especially the SMS
factor of pain in misophonia), and the other sensory and clinical traits.
