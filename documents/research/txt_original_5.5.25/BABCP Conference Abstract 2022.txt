Keynote addresses  
On the evolution of cognitive behaviour therapy: a four decade retrospective and a look to the 
future . David M Clark , University of Oxford, UK  
BABCP started as BABP (British Association of Behavioural Psychotherapy). This talk is a personal retrospective on how the 
field has changed over time, why the changes occurred, and a look to the future. We will cover diverse topics including:  
the cognitive revolution and its consequences; the rise a nd fall of anxiety management training; conditions that were 
considered the most difficult to treat and are now considered amongst the easiest, and vice versa; the art of lobbying for 
mental health; why delivery systems are as important as therapy types; t he beginnings of a possible digital revolution; and 
a look into a slightly hazy crystal ball.  
 
Reward sensitivity as a treatment target for depression and anxiety . Michelle Craske ,  University of 
California, Los Angeles, USA  
Threat and reward sensitivity a re fundamental processes that become dysregulated in the context of vulnerability to, or 
expression of, anxiety and depression. Treatments have traditionally targeted reductions in threat sensitivity with limited 
effects upon reward mechanisms. Investigati on of reward sensitivity is essential for our understanding of psychopathology 
and for targeted treatment approaches. I will present two related lines of my research on this topic.  First, I will present our 
latest findings regarding neural, behavioral and  subjective features of reward hyposensitivity (specifically in domains of 
reward anticipation -motivation, response to reward attainment, and reward learning) that correlate with and predict 
anxiety, depression and anhedonia. These findings led us to devel op a treatment that specifically targets reward 
hyposensitivity, termed Positive Affect Treatment, which we have shown to be more effective than standard cognitive 
behavioral therapy for anxious and depressed individuals. I will present our most recent rep lication study in anxious, 
depressed and extremely low positive affect individuals, where the symptomatic outcomes occur in parallel with changes 
in target measures of reward anticipation -motivation and attainment to a greater degree than occurs with stand ard 
cognitive behavioral therapy. I will also present findings from virtual reality technologies for delivering aspects of Positi ve 
Affect Treatment. Second, building upon the work of others who have demonstrated the role of dopaminergic signaling 
and rewa rd-related relief mechanisms in extinction learning, I will present our latest evidence regarding neural, behavioral 
and subjective correlates of anhedonia in the context of Pavlovian fear conditioning and related paradigms. Further, I will 
present evidenc e for interference with prediction error throughout exposure therapy (as a clinical proxy of extinction) as a 
function of anhedonia. I will conclude with a treatment model that incorporates reward targets to augment inhibitory 
retrieval models of exposure.

 Increasing access to CBT for child anxiety problems. Cathy Creswell , University of Oxford, UK  
"Anxiety problems are common and have a particularly early age of onset, with many people first experiencing difficulties 
as preadolescents. However, despite CBT being the only psychological therapy with a robust evidence base for child anxiety 
problems, very few children who experience problems with anxiety access CBT. Given the substantial impairments caused 
by child anxiety problems, in home, school and wider life, for both children and parents it is critical that we generate an 
ambitious approach to ensure that children and families can access effective treatment when they first need it, and, even 
better, for those who we know are at increased risk t o access prevention.  In this talk I will give an overview of recent 
studies that provide promising solutions for widescale access to prevention and treatment for preadolescent anxiety 
problems,  including through school -based support and novel online inter ventions that can overcome traditional barriers 
and fit around families’ busy lives. I will take a particular focus on how parents can efficiently be supported and 
empowered to help their children, and hope to dispel some of the prejudices that parents fac e when their children struggle 
with mental health problems along the way.  
 
The development of CBT in the UK: A personal perspective.  Kate Davidson ,  University of Glasgow, 
UK 
In this keynote, I will take a personal view of the development of CBT in the UK over the past 50 years. It is a privilege to be 
able to do this and to have heard from some others about how they became involved in CBT. We knew that this was 
something different – we could listen to our patients and believe what they said, without interp retation.  CBT was a 
gamechanger for those of us working in mental health all those years ago. The model allowed us to carry out research. The 
expansion of CBT has led to benefits and some challenges. BABCP has been instrumental in the development of CBT i n the 
UK and given its members focus and opportunities both national and international.  We need to document the past, the 
stories, before they are forgotten and lost.  
 
Action and Dialogue in Psychotherapy: A Dance of Equals . Christine Padesky,   Center for  Cognitive 
Therapy, California, USA  
The evolution of Cognitive Behavior Therapies (CBT) has often involved a tug -of-war between those who emphasize 
behavioral interventions, those who focus on cognitive inquiries and dialogues, and those who advocate for m indfulness 
and acceptance. Padesky shares her current integrative vision of CBT as a collaborative quest for discovery that can 
incorporate all these perspectives. In her approach, therapists emphasize action therapy methods to elicit emotion, full 
body ex periencing, beliefs, imagery, behaviors and values within interpersonal and cultural contexts in order to foster 
deeper learning and change. Padesky offers a collaborative, strengths -based model in which the full power of 
psychotherapy is revealed when act ion therapy methods and Socratic dialogue interact in a dance of equals.  
 
Learning how to feel good: Development of a novel therapy to target wellbeing and positive mood in 
depression . Barney Dunn , University of Exeter, UK  
The primary focus in CBT for depression has been on down -regulating negative thinking and feeling. However, it is 
increasingly realised that anhedonia, a reduction in the ability to experience pleasure, is also central to the onset and 
maintenance of depre ssion and should be paid more attention in treatment. Clients describe the repair of positive mood 
and broader wellbeing as a critical element of recovery from depression. This talk will review findings from secondary 
analyses of randomised controlled tria ls that show neither BA or CBT adequately repair positive mood and that low positive 
mood at the end of treatment predicts a greater likelihood of subsequent relapse. An overview of Augmented Depression 
Therapy (ADepT) will then be provided, a novel therap y that explicitly targets wellbeing and positive mood repair in 
depression. Findings from studies evaluating ADepT to date will be presented, including feasibility, clinical, and cost -
effectiveness outcomes from a pilot randomised controlled trial comparin g ADepT to high intensity CBT in the treatment of 
depression of 82 clients recruited predominantly from IAPT waiting lists. Results suggest ADepT is very unlikely to be 
inferior to, and may be superior to, CBT in repairing anhedonia, treating acute depress ion and preventing subsequent 
relapse. Health economic analyses also suggest ADepT has potential to be cost -effective relative to CBT. Next steps in 
evaluating ADepT, including conducting a definitive randomised controlled trial and adapting it for work wi th young adults 
and those with complex trauma will be explored.

 Compassion as an integrating process in psychotherapy.  Paul Gilbert , University of Derby, UK  
It is well recognised that psychotherapy involves helping people with a range of psychophysiologic al processes. These 
include their motivations, emotions, core beliefs and behavioural dispositions. In addition, most therapies have a range of 
interventions that include: the therapeutic relationship, specific forms of guided discovery, various exposure a nd 
behavioural experiments. Compassion focused therapy shares these basic dimensions of psychotherapy but highlights the 
importance of motivation orientation. The talk will explore how different motives influence these processes. It will also 
explore the e volution of caring behaviour and how and why caring behaviour creates a betweenperson and within person 
context for the ability to tolerate and integrate difficult or avoided processes.  
 
Promoting Well -Being In and Out of the Clinic . Andrew Gloster,  University of Basel, Switzerland  
Patients present for treatment longing for better lives, often without knowing what to expect. Psychotherapy is our  
profession’s answer to this call. Based on current knowledge, we can be proud of the efficacy of m any of our 
psychotherapies. But what do we do when our psychotherapies fail? And what do we really know about our patient’s life 
outside the therapy room? And how can the scientifically derived principles we use in therapy be harnessed to help beyond 
the c linic? These questions will be explored by examining empirical evidence across multi -levels of analysis and multiple 
contexts. For example, evidence from clinical trials will be examined that offers insight about how to intervene with 
treatment non -respond ers and simultaneously explore the conditions that promote well -being using event sampling. 
Epidemiological evidence will be presented that explores under which circumstances psychotherapy targets apply at the 
population level. Finally, evidence from a mic ro-intervention (15 minutes) based on empirical psychotherapeutic principals 
will be presented with the question of whether such a short intervention can exact change in pro -sociality and well -being 
in small groups.By examining these various sources, I wil l show some of the ways we can help our patients achieve better 
lives in and out of the clinic.  
 
Mindfulness ( -based cognitive therapy) is coming of age: The story so far and a vision for the future.  
Willem Kuyken,  University of Oxford,  UK  
This keynote wi ll briefly overview the story of mindfulness -based cognitive therapy (MBCT) to date. This will include the 
key milestones over >20 years of definition, theory, innovations in research methods, effectiveness, cost -effectiveness and 
implementation. Most impo rtantly, we have learned that MBCT provides a cost -effective approach to helping people to 
prevent depression and that it can be integrated into mainstream mental health services. But we have also seen a growing 
evidence base suggesting that MBCT can promo te mental health and unlock human flourishing in the wider population and 
potentially across the lifespan. How can this work best evolve to meet its full potential? How can we unlock all that we 
have learned to use MBCT as a vehicle for creating a world wi thout the devastating effects of depression. A world where 
mental health is a fundamental human right and psychological interventions play their part in promoting well -being and 
resourcing people to meet the challenges of the next 50 years?  
 
Low intensity interventions for anxiety and depression with and without Long term conditions.  
Karina Lovell,  The University of Manchester, UK  
Within the UKs stepped care model, initial interventions usually involve low -intensity cognitive behavioural therapy ( LICBT) 
for common mental health problems, often referred to as guided self -help (Gellatly et al. (Gellatly, Bower, Hennessy, 
Richards, Gilbody and Lovell, 2007). Low intensity interventions are defined as: The primary purpose of low intensity CBT 
intervent ions is to increase access to  evidence -based psychological therapies in order to enhance mental health and 
wellbeing on a community -wide basis, using the minimum level of intervention necessary to create the maximum gain. Low 
intensity CBT interventions ha ve been  mainly developed in the context of patients with mild to moderate psychological 
disorders, enabling high intensity CBT to be reserved for patients with more severe disorders Bennett -Levy et al (2010).  
More recently low intensity CBT interventions h ave been developed or adapted to be  delivered to work with long -term 
conditions such as chronic pain, Rheumatoid Arthritis, coronary heart disease with and without depression and anxiety.  
In this presentation I will look at the evidence, cost effectivenes s, and acceptability (from those receiving and those 
delivering low intensity interventions) focussing primarily on Long term conditions.  I will also look at future directions and 
methodological issues including longer follow up data, outcome measures and developing further interventions that are 
culturally sensitive and increasing access for seldom heard groups.

 Creating an evidence -based digital CBT program for depression and anxiety in long term conditions: 
Putting the cart before the horse. Rona Moss -Morris , King’s College London, UK  
Common mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety, are 2 -3 times more prevalent in people with long -term 
physical health conditions (LTCs) compared with the general population.  Mental health comorbidity in L TCs is associated 
with poorer health outcome and a 60% increase in health costs.  There is evidence that people with LTCs have significant 
poorer outcomes following evidenced -based CBT therapies for anxiety and depression than those without a LTC.  This ma y 
be because cognitive -behavioural mechanisms targeted in traditional CBT protocols are based on empirical models of 
mental health disorders.  This raises important theoretical and clinical issues, including the difference between primary 
mental health dis order and distress in the context of LTC.   
In this presentation I will argue that the assessment of people with anxiety and depression and a LTC should include 
screening for illness -related distress.  If illness related distress is one of the key presenti ng issues, then the challenges of 
living with the LTC should be at the heart of the treatment formulation.   Although there are some therapy protocols for 
specific LTCS, to date there has been no clear protocol for treating illness -related distress.  To ad dress this gap, we have 
developed a transdiagnostic model of adjustment to LTCS (TMA -LTC).  I will present the key features of this model and 
show how we used this to develop a transdiagnostic digital CBT program for distress in LTC called COMPASS: Navigat ing 
your Long -Term Condition.  One of the biggest challenges for applied researchers is addressing the evidence -
implementation gap as few of our effective interventions become part of standard care for patients.  So before moving 
onto an efficacy trail, we  spent time adapting the program to routine therapy workflows, and to patient and therapist 
feedback. This work was informed by normalization process theory.  We then went on to conduct a real -world 
implementation evaluation (n= 74) of this treatment withi n existing hospital services and made further improvements to 
COMPASS.   
The next step was a randomized controlled trial. 194 participants with a LTC and comorbid anxiety and/or depression were 
randomized to COMPASS or standard LTC charity support (SCS).   At 12 -weeks, PHQ -ADS (distress) was significantly lower in 
the COMPASS than the SCS arm (SMD=0.71, CI: 0.48 -0.95 p<.001). 89% of COMPASS participants reported a clinically 
significant change in PHQ -ADS (reduction ≥4 on PHQ -ADS) compared to 45% in SCS. Results on all secondary outcomes 
including daily functioning, quality of life, impact of symptoms, and illness self -management favoured the COMPASS arm. 
There were no serious adverse reactions to treatment.  COMPASS appears to be an efficacious, easy  to access and 
potentially cost -effective way of treating illness -related anxiety and depression across LTCs.  I will end by discussing next 
steps for future research and wider implementation and open to the audience for comment.  
 
Making CBT for OCD better  one experiment, one belief, one step at a time. Adam Radomsky,   
Concordia University Montréal, Canada  
One of the most impressive things about cognitive -behaviour therapy (CBT) is that it was designed to be influenced by 
advances in science.  Links between  the clinic and the laboratory are essential to fostering advances in CBT, and effective 
CBT interventions for obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD) are an impressive exemplar of the benefits of connecting 
science with practice.  Further, experimental method shave some unique properties that have lent themselves well to these 
improvements over time.  This talk  will highlight in two domains how reports of individuals struggling with OCD, advances 
in theory, and laboratory experiments have helped to shape improv ements in our understanding and ability to treat OCD, 
moving forward from older behavioural treatments to modern cognitive approaches.  Early research on memory deficits in 
OCD and reports of those with lived experience led to experiments which  shaped our understanding of the role of memory 
(and of memory confidence) in OCD.  These in turn led to detailed examinations of psychological mechanisms underlying 
memory -related beliefs, confidence, doubt and compulsive checking, which have now been shown to be hel pful in 
treatment.  Other belief domains will be highlighted as potentially fruitful, including recent experimental work on beliefs 
about losing control, and of their potential to improve our understanding and treatment not only of OCD, but also of a 
range  of other mental health problems.  
 
Current status of Cultural Adaptations to CBT – A Global Perspective. Shanaya Rathod ,  Southern 
Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK  
"Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is the most widely recommended psychological  intervention for mental health 
problems in the United Kingdom (e.g. NICE 2014) and  many other countries. However, explanations used in CBT have been 
criticised as  being based on Western concepts and illness models. We know that culture  significantly impact s on all aspects 
of mental illness - commencement,  psychopathology, course, treatment approaches and outcomes. Despite this, little  
attention is given to modifying the therapeutic framework and practice of therapy to  incorporate an understanding of 
diverse  ethnic, cultural and religious contexts  (Rathod et al, 2008).  Prof Rathod will present her pioneering work in 
developing and testing a culturally  adapted CBT framework in the UK (Rathod et al. 2010; 2013; 2015) that has led to a

8 
 
 
 programme of successful tr ials of culturally adapted CBT across the world. A body of  evidence is now developing and she 
will discuss the impact of cultural adaptation of  CBT from a global perspective.

What’s behaviour got to do with it? Keeping the B in CBT . Paul Salkovskis,  University of Oxford,  UK  
The roots of the wide range of approaches covered by the term “Cognitive -behavioural therapy” are firmly planted in 
Behaviour Therapy, which placed observable behaviour at the heart of its therapeutic approach. So where do we stand on 
the importance of beh aviour today, Sixty four years after the origins of Behaviour Therapy, Fifty years after the founding of 
the British Association for Behavioural Psychotherapy and Thirty years after it was renamed the British Association for 
Behavioural and Cognitive Psych otherapies? Unsurprisingly, it remains both crucial and central to the understanding and 
treatment of psychological problems. Our improved understanding of the complex ways in which cognitive and behavioural 
processes interact to cause distress and disabil ity has allowed us to refine and enhance treatments to a previously unheard 
of extent. Central to our understanding of the importance of behaviour is defining the mechanism of change in CBT (and 
indeed other psychological therapies). It is suggested that t his mechanism is surprisingly simple and has profound 
implications for the way we work with those we seek to help. It also explains the importance of (and links between) both 
behavioural and cognitive change, and how best to facilitate these. Examples will  be drawn from empirically grounded 
approaches to panic, OCD and health anxiety whilst illustrating key transdiagnostic factors. Fifty years on, CBT is a truly 
integrative transdiagnostic approach.  
 
Too good for your own good: Advances in the understanding  and treatment of clinical perfectionism . 
Roz Shafran,   UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London , UK  
Unlike most other areas related to mental health, perfectionism is often viewed positively. In fact, those attending the 
conference from overseas may well have stopped at Heathrow’s ‘Perfectionists’ café’ inspired by Heston Blumenthal’s ‘In 
Search of Perfection’ TV series. Or perhaps you have recently come across a ‘motivational’ message such as ‘harder, better, 
faster, stronger’. The posit ive value placed on striving and achievement can make it particularly challenging for people to 
engage in therapy. However, the strong associations between perfectionism and psychopathology such as suicidal ideation, 
depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and OCD indicate that addressing perfectionism can improve mental health and this 
is borne out in several meta -analyses that have confirmed the efficacy of the cognitive behavioural intervention for 
perfectionism.  
In this keynote, I will provide an overvi ew of the latest research findings on the prevalence, understanding and treatment 
of perfectionism. Perfectionist Strivings will be distinguished from Perfectionistic Concerns, and the role of each in the 
maintenance of psychopathology will be reviewed. Th e cognitive behavioural approach to clinical perfectionism will be 
considered in light of other approaches including ACT and those focused on social disconnection. The clinical question of 
when and how to tackle perfectionism in the face of multiple co -existing mental health disorders will be addressed. The 
keynote will end with a consideration of future innovations and challenges facing the treatment of perfectionism.

Many survivors of sexual abuse suffer from distressing feelings of being contaminated (FBC) which can persist for years 
after the last experience of sexual ab use.  Jung and Steil (2013) have developed a two -session protocol to reduce FBC using 
cognitive restructuring and imagery modification.  Their small, randomised control trial showed a significant and large 
reduction of distress related to the FBC and signi ficant and large effect on patients’ PTSD symptoms.  This presentation 
describes how the Jung and Steil (2013) protocol was used during the treatment of a female asylum seeker who presented 
with a 45 -year history of sexual abuse and trauma.  At the start o f treatment, the patient believed that she was still 
contaminated by her many abusers, even though the last abuse occurred over five years ago.  She believed that others 
could smell and see the contamination and she wouldn’t look at her own body as she bel ieved it was so contaminated and 
dirty.  The techniques used will be discussed in relation to her progress in therapy.  We hope that this presentation will 
encourage other therapists when working with patients who describe feelings of being contaminated.

Discussion of the details of successful therapy with woman with severe PTSD and dissociation, showing how 
adaptations were made to standard protocols  
Zoe Chessell , Woodfield Trauma Service, CNWL , UK; Kerry  Young , Woodfield Trauma Service, CNWL , UK  
There are well established protocols for the treatment of PTSD using trauma -focused CBT (tfCBT) (e.g. Ehlers et al., 2005). 
However, there are very few reports in the literature about how to adapt tfCBT when the client dissociates during  accounts 
of their trauma. Recently, there have been several encouraging papers suggesting how to work with dissociation in the 
context of tfCBT (Kennerley, 2009; Schauer & Elbert, 2010; Chessell et al., 2019; Ehlers & Murray, 2020). This presentation 
will describe how these suggestions were put into practice in the treatment of a female refugee presenting with extremely 
severe dissociation and PTSD following domestic abuse and rape over many years. The techniques used and her progress in 
therapy will be di scussed. A traditional tfCBT paradigm was adapted to minimise her dissociation (including the use of 
imagery re -scripting techniques). Following this, useful pointers and advice will be drawn out for other clinicians embarking 
on similar work in the future . We hope that this case study will provide encouragement to other therapists working with 
trauma.  
 
“The memories are horrible, but the guilt is with me every day”: Working with feelings of guilt and 
responsibility in trauma -focused therapy  
Fareeha  Khan , Freedom From Torture & Woodfield Trauma Service, CNWL , UK  
For many refugees and asylum seekers, experiences following trauma survi val can involve strong feelings of guilt (Lee, 
Scragg, & Turner, 2001). Survivors of trauma may hold themselves responsible for what occurred, both during and/or after 
the traumatic event(s). Guilt should always be considered within its cultural and social  context and does not always merit 
an intervention. It can be a helpful emotional experience, holding individuals responsible for actions incongruent with their  
personal values/beliefs. However, trauma -related guilt can be a source of distress and may perp etuate an ongoing sense of 
threat and avoidance of trauma memories, contributing to the maintenance of symptoms of PTSD (Pugh, Taylor, & Berry, 
2015).  This presentation will share how cognitive and imagery techniques were used in trauma therapy with a refugee with 
very high levels of dissociation and trauma -related guilt. It will also include excerpts of a film in which the service user talks 
about the t herapy from his own perspective. Finally, it will discuss the importance of reflecting on power and privilege 
when formulating and working with trauma -related guilt, and the importance of being led by survivors in this work.  
 
Addressing  guilt and shame in trauma -focused therapy with a survivor of sexual exploitation  
Francesca  Brady , Woodfield Trauma Service, CNWL   
Survivors of trafficking often present with complex mental health needs (Ottisova et al., 2016), particularly those who have 
been exposed to repeated traumatic experiences, such as those who are exploited for the purposes of sexual exploitation. 
There is v ery limited research as to which therapeutic models or techniques are most effective to support survivors of 
trafficking (Hemmings et al., 2016; Salami et al., 2018), but there is evidence to suggest that existing trauma -focused 
therapies can be adapted to  meet the needs of this vulnerable client group (e.g. Brady et al., 2021; Robjant, Roberts & 
Katona, 2017). This presentation will describe the details of an adapted trauma -focused cognitive therapy (Ehlers and 
Clark, 2000) intervention. We will focus on h ow the client’s persistent feelings of guilt and shame were identified and 
addressed, and how we explored the profound impact of her trafficking experiences on her sense of identity and self -
worth. We will also include the client’s perspective on the thera py. We hope that this presentation will give other clinicians 
the confidence to approach trauma -focused work with trafficking survivors in a range of different contexts.

Peer functioning and social anxiety in adolescents: understanding the association.  
Eleanor  Leigh , University of Oxford , UK; Kenny  Chiu , University of East Anglia , UK; David  Clark , University of 
Oxford , UK  
Background: Peer rel ationships are particularly important during adolescence, and we also see a normative increase in 
social anxiety at this time. Although prospective studies have suggested peer functioning and social anxiety can influence 
each other, findings have not been examined systematically. We performed a systematic review and meta -analysis of 
prospective studies to examine the bidirectional relationship between peer functioning and social anxiety in adolescence.  
Methods: EMBASE, PsycINFO, Medline, and PubMed were sea rched to identify relevant articles. Meta -analysis was 
conducted to examine the mean effect sizes of prospective associations between social anxiety and four dimensions of 
peer functioning. Moderator analysis was performed, with age, gender, time interval between baseline and follow -up 
assessment, and publication year as moderators.  
Results: Meta -analyses of 23 studies showed that friendship quality, peer rejection, and peer victimization were each 
associated with later social anxiety, but peer acceptance w as not. Social anxiety at baseline was associated with 
prospective levels of friendship quality, peer rejection, and peer victimization, but not peer acceptance. Age moderated 
the association between friendship quality and prospective social anxiety. Other  moderator effects were statistically non -
significant.  
Conclusions: A significant two -way association was found with social anxiety across three dimensions of peer functioning. 
Limitations include different classifications of peer functioning, the use of s elf-report measures, heterogeneity between 
studies, and underrepresentation of clinical samples. Psychological prevention and intervention targeting peer functioning 
and social anxiety are indicated.  
 
Vulnerability for bullying victimization – Examination of heritability and risk factors in a twin -family study  
Dana  Martinschledde , University of Bielefeld, Germany ; Rainer  Riemann , University of Bielefeld, Germany ; 
Frank  Neuner , University of Bielefeld, Germany ; Benjamin  Iffland , University of Bielefeld, Germany   
A substantial proportion of children and adolescents is confronted with experiences of peer victimization in their everyday 
lives. Victimized individuals have to deal with serious short - and long -term consequences, including mental health 
problems. The clo se link between victimization and psychopathology highlights the importance of examining potential risk 
factors that may increase the vulnerability for experiences of victimization. The aim of this study was to gain a better 
understanding of the mechanisms  underlying a transgenerational transmission of the risk for victimization by examining 
the interplay between genes and environment. Previous research was expanded through the use of a Nuclear Twin Family 
Design which did not only include data of monozygot ic and dizygotic twin pairs, but also considered reports of their 
parents and siblings. In a sample of 2546 twin pairs and their relatives, bullying victimization was measured using the the 
Bullying and Victimization Questionnaire for Children (BVF -K; von Marées & Petermann, 2009) and the Gatehouse Bullying 
Scale (GBS; Bond et al., 2007). Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the heritability of direct and indirect 
forms of bullying and to determine the variance accounted for by genetic, shared environmental and non -shared 
environmental influences. Additionally, the role of parental and child psychopathology, particularly internalizing disorders,  
as potential risk factors for victimization was analyzed in path analyses. Implications of the transm ission of vulnerability for 
victimization for maximization of the effectiveness of interventional approaches targeting both individual and 
environmental level factors will be discussed.  
 
Physiological responses to social -evaluative stress in peer victimization related major depressive disorder  
Klara  Blauth , Bielefeld University, Germany ; Frank  Neuner , Bielefeld University, Germany ; Benjamin  Iffland , 
Bielefeld University, Germany   
Relational peer victimization is associated with an increased risk for the development of a host of psychiatric disorders 
including major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly 
understood. It has been s uggested that psychophysiological changes associated with experiences of maltreatment may link 
victimization to the development of psychopathology. Different social stress tasks revealed that individuals who have 
experienced peer victimization differ in th eir stress response from individuals without such prior experiences. In adult 
patients with MDD, however, studies examining the effects of peer victimization on physiological stress responses are 
scarce. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine whethe r early experiences of peer victimization influence 
subsequent physiological and affective responses to socially negative evaluative and neutral stimuli in patients with MDD

11 
 
 
 and healthy controls. Using a social conditioning task, this study examined cardia c, ERP, and experiential responses to 
social evaluative stimuli in twenty -nine patients with MDD and twenty -nine healthy controls. In both groups, participants 
experienced various degrees of peer victimization. A history of peer victimization was associate d with more arousing, 
negative, and disapproving ratings of both negative and neutral social stimuli. Similarly, participants with higher levels of  
peer victimization showed more pronounced ERP amplitudes on the P100 component in reaction to both valences.  On the 
P200, however, attenuated amplitudes in peer victimized individuals were found in response to negative social evaluative 
stimuli. With respect to heart rate responses, depressive patients showed a more pronounced heart rate deceleration than 
health y controls. Similarly, higher levels of peer victimization were associated with more pronounced heart rate 
decelerations, irrespective of the valence. Interestingly, the effect of peer victimization was found to be stronger in 
patients with MDD than in hea lthy controls. The results suggest that the physiological and experiential reactivity towards 
both negative and neutral social stimuli in depressive patients is affected by experiences of peer victimization. Peer 
victimization causes generalized autonomic dysregulation during social learning impeding adequate response preparation 
to social stressors which may enhance the risk for the development of depressive disorders.  
 
Development and clinical utility of a new measure of cognitions rela ted to bullying  
Belinda  Graham , University of Oxford, UK ; Belinda  Graham , University of Oxford ; Anke  Ehlers , University of 
Oxford, UK   
Introduction: Bullying is associated with increased risk of social anxiety and can produce symptoms of posttra umatic stress 
disorder (PTSD). Cognitive models suggest that social anxiety and PTSD symptoms are maintained by unhelpful cognitions 
and coping strategies. Specific cognitions related to bullying may explain additional variance in symptoms and a new 
measur e may help guide assessment and interventions for people who have been bullied. Method: Young people (n = 
1279, mean age 19 years) who had been bullied completed an online survey about their experiences of bullying and mental 
health, including measures of social anxiety and PTSD symptoms related to their worst bullying experience. They also rated 
agreement with a series of items describing beliefs about self and others in relation to bullying that were developed from 
qualitative analysis of interviews with young people, expert review, and piloting. Item selection included exploratory and 
confirmatory factor analyses. The final solution was tested for reliability and validity. Predictive utility of the new measu re 
was tested using multinomial logistic regress ion with likely diagnosis (SAD, PTSD, SAD+PTSD, None) as the dependent 
variable. Results: A new Bullying Cognitions Inventory was developed comprising 15 items that represented four factors 
labelled as “shame”, “self -criticism”, “threat”, and “social defea t”. The factor structure was confirmed by confirmatory 
factor analysis. The final version of the measure had good fit for the data (CFI = 0.95, TLI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.07 (CI: 0.06 - 
0.08), χ2= 244.59 on df = 83, χ2:df = 2.95) and met reliability and validit y criteria. Factors loaded significantly onto a 
second -order factor. Sufficient data were available to categorise 938 participants according to likely diagnostic status (SAD, 
n = 329; PTSD, n = 38; SAD+PTSD, n = 309; None, n = 178). Total score significant ly predicted variance in the dependent 
variable group, χ2 (3, N = 854) = 394.23, Nagelkerke R2= .41, p &lt; .001, such that the non -clinical group scored lowest 
compared to all other groups, and those with social anxiety alone scored lower than those with both social anxiety and 
PTSD symptoms. Discussion: The Bullying Cognitions Inventory is a reliable and valid measure of cognitions related to 
bullying that may be a useful guide for research, assessment, and intervention among young people who have been 
bullied. Limitations, research directions, and clinical implications will be discussed.  
 
Leaving the Past Behind:  Updating Memories of Bullying in Cognitive Therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder 
with Imagery Rescripting  
Jennifer  Wild , University of Oxford < UK ; David M  Clark , University of Oxford , UK  
Patients with social anxiety disorder often experience an impression or image of their worst fears being realised when they 
feel nervous in social situations.  Such images play a role in maintaining the disorder and are often linked to earlier socia lly 
traumatic memories of being bullied.  Imagery rescripting is a technique used in cognitive therapy for social anxiety 
disorder (CT -SAD) which helps patients to unhook the present from the past. Patients revisit their past bullying in light of 
their current experiences and in so doing, re -evaluate the meaning of the past event and linked image. Several studies 
(e.g., Wild et al., 2007; Wild et al., 2008) demonstrate that imagery rescripting significantly reduces distress associated w ith 
the bullying memories as well as anxiety about feared social situations.  In this talk, we describe how to use imagery 
rescripting to target memories of being bullied in CT -SAD to crystalise recovery from the disorder.

Online ACT for Type I Diabetes: A Single Case Experimental Design to Examine Feasibility, 
Acceptability and Preliminary Effectiveness  
Greta  Somaini , Royal Holloway , UK; Jessica  Kingston , Royal Holloway , UK; Michelle  Taylor , Royal Holloway , UK 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has an established evidence -base for improving well -being and health 
outcomes for individuals with a range of chronic health conditions, with some ev idence supporting dissemination of the 
intervention through digital methods. Research examining ACT for diabetes, and in particular the digital delivery of ACT for 
diabetes, is currently very limited. This study developed and tested the effects of a web -based modular ACT intervention 
for adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D), examining effects on diabetes self -management, well -being, quality of life and ACT 
processes. Feasibility and acceptability were also explored given the novelty of the online intervention.  A randomized -
multiple baseline Single Case Experimental Design (SCED) was used, with n=9 adults with T1D recruited through UK -based 
diabetes support groups and social media. Participants were randomised to baseline length (1 -3 weeks) before accessing a 
6-week ACT intervention, followed by one -month follow -up. Visual analogue scales of self -management, well -being and 
self-reported readings of blood glucose levels were recorded daily throughout the study duration, while standardised and 
process measures at p re-, post -intervention and end of follow -up. Data are in the final stages of analyses and will be fully 
analysed in time for the conference.  
 
Brief Internet -Based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Intervention for Parents in the 
Postpartum

London , UK; Emma  O'Donoghue , South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust , UK  
The pe rinatal period is a time of increased risk for psychological difficulties. Postpartum depression is estimated to occur in 
10-20% for women (Shorey et al., 2018) and 8% for men (Rao, et al., 2020). However, several barriers including stigma and 
lack of time  reduce treatment uptake. Internet -based interventions overcome many of the identified barriers. This study 
aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a 4 -week internet -based ACT intervention for postpartum parents 
with elevated depressive sympt oms (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05173285). A self -selecting sample of parents were recruited 
between June 2020 and January 2022. A 2 (intervention versus wait -list control) by 3 (baseline, post -intervention, and 4 -
weeks follow -up) feasibility RCT was employed. The primary outcome measure was depression, measured by the 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS; Cox, Holden, & Sagovsky, 1987). The secondary outcome measure was well -
being, measured by the Flourishing scale (FS; Diener, et al., 2009). A total of 1 38 participants met the inclusion criteria and 
were randomised to intervention (n = 65) or control group (n =73). The data of this study is currently being analysed. For 
feasibility, recruitment and attrition rates will be presented in a CONSORT flow diagr am. Acceptability will be established 
by examining self -report data. The preliminary effectiveness of the intervention will also be reported, including estimated 
effect size and confidence intervals.  
 
Process -based analyses of the Acce ptance and Commitment Therapy model  
Ian Tyndall , Department of Psychology, University of Chichester , UK; Daniel  Assaz , University of Sao Paolo, 
Brazil ; Bryan  Roche , Maynooth University, Ireland   
The Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) model comprises six separate sub -component processes of psychological 
inflexibility (experiential avoidance, cognitive defusion, lack of present moment awareness, self -as-content, lack of values 
clarity, and non -com mitment to action) that purportedly influence psychological distress experienced. For clinicians, it may 
not be clear, however, how these components interact to produce behaviour change, decrease psychological inflexibility, 
and facilitate enhanced emotion al wellbeing. The present paper consists of two parts to provide the clinician with a deeper 
understanding of the broader spectrum of psychological inflexibility and to give insights as to how positive outcomes might 
be achieved with one particular core AC T process. First, we employed latent class analysis  (N = 567; non -clinical sample) 
that identified potential clusters (i.e., classes) of psychological inflexibility, and importantly, examined whether there wa s 
clinical utility to this approach insofar as such classes could reliably differentiate levels of self -reported psychological 
distress (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales -21; DASS -21) and positive and negative emotionality (Positive and Negative 
Emotion Scales; PANAS). The second part of this pape r focuses on one key psychological inflexibility process, cognitive 
defusion, which in many respects represents the signature or most unique process in ACT, as compared to other forms of

13 
 
 
 cognitive -behavioural therapies. In simple terms, cognitive fusion re fers to the idea that clients believe their negative 
thoughts to literally be true and act according to these negative thoughts in rigid and unhelpful ways. Cognitive defusion, 
then, is a process designed to counteract cognitive fusion by teaching clients to observe thoughts as verbal stimuli that 
come and go rather than verbal rules that the mind suggests must be adhered to. The aim here is to provide a more 
pragmatic and nuanced conceptual and behavioural process -based account of cognitive defusion for th e clinician. It is 
proposed that this analysis might help enhance therapeutic practice by more clearly linking underlying theory to more 
probable clinical outcome.  
 
Development of a novel, person -centred psychological intervention (ACT+) based on acceptance

Introduction: The SURECAN (SUrvivors’ Rehabilitation Evaluation after CANcer) study is developing and evaluating a 
psychological intervention based on Acceptance and Commitme nt Therapy (ACT) for people who have completed 
treatment for cancer but have low quality of life. ACT is integrated with options to support exercise and work when highly 
valued thus we called the intervention ACT+. Here we describe the process by which ACT + was developed and refined. 
Method: Normalisation process theory was used and a three -pronged approach was adopted. 1) Evidence was collated 
from qualitative interviews/focus groups with cancer patients (n=31) and key stakeholders (n=28); 2) Preliminary r esults 
from our qualitative meta -synthesis of cultural influences on psychological interventions were taken into account; 3) 
Insights from patient and public involvement consultations were also considered. Results: Qualitative work suggested 
several cross -cutting themes pertaining to the design and resources of the intervention, operational aspects of the trial 
conduct (e.g. ACT+ delivery; patient identification/recruitment) and to contextual factors (e.g. need for aftercare, ACT+ 
accessibility). Discussion : We have followed an iterative, evidence -based approach to intervention development. 
Qualitative work supported this process and potential barriers and facilitators to the delivery and uptake of ACT+ were 
uncovered.(Invited to submit as part of a symposiu m first convened for the EABCT 2021 congress)  
 
Integrating ACT components in CBT training: Trainee appetite and supervisor preparedness

Huthwaite , University of Otago, Wellington, New Zealand   
Can elements of CBT and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) be integrated? Perhaps, in line with ‘third wave’ 
CBT, it would be beneficial to bring ACT components into post -graduate CBT training so that students become aware how 
ACT relates to and compl ements traditional CBT. This paper describes a study of interest and skills in ACT in students 
undertaking a post -graduate CBT course and their supervisors. It was unclear to what extent ACT was used at the ‘coal 
face’ of mental health services in New Zeal and (NZ). We also assessed student and supervisors’ views on the cultural 
appropriateness of ACT for Māori (the indigenous people of NZ). This study used Qualtrics surveys to assess whether it 
would be appropriate to include an ACT component in the trainin g, in terms of interest by students and supervisor 
preparedness and cultural appropriateness. Survey results suggest that there is considerable interest in ACT amongst CBT 
students and their supervisors mostly consider themselves able to supervise if an AC T component was added to the 
training. Further, the majority of participants thought ACT was culturally appropriate for Māori (Watson, Mathieson & 
Huthwaite, 2021). We discuss how this could occur in a coherent, meaningful, formulation -driven way.

Being mindful in unmindful places; The challenge of psychiatric wards  
Pamela  Jacobsen , University of Bath , UK  
Inpatient psychiatric wards are one example of a restrictive setting, where people’s free movements are restricted, there 
are high levels of supervision, and a lack of choice over everyday activities such as when to eat, sleep, or exercise.  Given 
the great need to help reduce suffering and improve well -being for people receiving care in these settings, Mindfulness -

14 
 
 
 Based interventions have been an increasingly co mmon addition to inpatient therapy programmes over recent years, both 
as a group and individual therapy.  However, the characteristics which underlie a restrictive setting may also be considered 
to be in opposition to a ‘mindful’ environment in which diffi culties are turned towards without the attempt to control or 
suppress them.  This is because the successful operating of a restrictive environment relies partly on the control of the 
emotional ‘temperature’ of the ward; this is often maintained by the use of interventions such as use of as required (PRN) 
medication, or even control and restraint and seclusion in extreme circumstances.  
In this talk I will give examples of implementing and evaluating mindfulness -based interventions for both service users and  
staff across a range of inpatient settings, including a specialist psychosis ward and acute psychiatric wards.  I will outlin e 
adaptations to standard mindfulness programmes to better meet the needs of service users and staff in these settings, and 
presen t data on both the successes and challenges of being mindful in unmindful places.

Mindfulness - and Yoga -based Approaches for Inpatients with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders  
Kerem  Boge , Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charité – 
Universitätsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt -Universität zu Berlin, and 
Berlin Institute of Health , Germany  
In recent years, a growing body of literature demonstrates the effectiveness of mindfulness - and yoga -based interventions 
in the treatment of persons with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SDS). A minor number of randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs), primarily in English -speaking countries such as the UK, USA, and Australia, have shown the effectiveness of 
mindfulness concerning positive - and negative symptoms, depressive and anxiety symptom s as well as reduced 
rehospitalization rates and overall enhanced positive well -being. Nonetheless, until today, worldwide only a handful 
studies have been conducted in inpatient settings, and to the best of the authors’ knowledge, none in German -speaking 
countries. The current presentation aims at demonstrating the research processes of the past five years in which the first 
mindfulness -based group therapy (MBGT) and yoga -based group intervention (YOGI) for in - and outpatients with SSD was 
developed and im plemented for the inpatient care in Germany within various trials (SENSE, YING, OXACH).  
Overall, mixed -method approaches were employed using both qualitative and quantitative data analysis. Over 80 semi -
structured interviews were conducted in order to gai n an in -depth understanding of the therapeutic actions, processes and 
underlying mechanisms of mindfulness and yoga before and after the four -week treatment periods. Based on the results 
two psychological treatment manuals were developed within a participa tory (participant involvement) approach (MBGT 
and YOGI). Furthermore, multiple RCTs for inpatients with SDS were conducted to assess changes in mindfulness abilities, 
clinical - and process outcomes, as well as iPad -based cognitive measures (CANTAB).  
The pr esentation will illustrate the overall research process, results of the qualitative interviews and development of the 
therapeutic manuals as well as the clinical - and process outcomes of each intervention. Finally, the challenges, strengths, 
and limitation s of the research processes, especially in the light of inpatient settings, will be shared as well as elaboration 
on future directions.  
 
The Pentonville Prison Mindfulness Project:  Benefits for prisoners and staff  
Pamela Jacobsen, University of Bath  UK; Andy Phee, Oxford Mindfulness Centre , UK; Debbie Murphy, Oxford 
Mindfulness Centre , UK  
People in prison experience multiple stressors through the incarceration process including separation from loved ones, 
uncertainty regarding the future, and ad justment to the prison regime, with remand being a particularly difficult time. 
Almost half the UK prison population suffer from anxiety or depression, and there are high rates of people who have 
experienced some form of trauma.  Research has demonstrated the effectiveness of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy 
(MBCT) for people who suffer from depression, and in particular for people with a trauma history.  However there has 
been little MBCT implementation in UK prison mental health services so far.  
The Mi ndful Nation report, endorsed by an all -party parliamentary group made recommendations for the implementation 
of mindfulness -based approaches in four areas of British society, including the criminal justice sector.  The Pentonville 
Prison Mindfulness Proje ct was therefore established in 2016 in response to this report.  The project delivered Mindfulness 
Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) to incarcerated men, on remand, experiencing mental health problems and to prison 
staff.  The dual focus of the project on bo th prisoners and staff was in response to evidence that prison staff experience 
high levels of job -related stress and have high levels of burnout compared to other professions.

15 
 
 
 The Pentonville Prison Mindfulness Project developed over 3 years and delivered  4 MBCT based courses to men on remand 
who were experiencing mental health problems. The project also supported prison personnel in learning mindfulness skills 
and a selected group of mainly health and social care staff from several prisons who trained to teach MBCT.  
Data on outcomes suggested positive effects for wellbeing, perceived stress, and mindfulness for staff, and qualitative data 
from prisoners on remand showed they also reported subjective benefits in wellbeing.  The Pentonville project was led by 
Andy Phee (Community Mental Health Nurse and mindfulness teacher and trainer) and Debbie Murphy (Occupational 
Therapist and previous lead for the Wellbeing Centre, HMP Pentonville).

Can Psychological Flexibility predict Perinatal depression and Flourishing from pregnancy to the postpartum 
phase? A longitudinal study  
Zaynab  Al-Khoee , Royal Holloway University London , UK; Jessica  Kingston , Royal Holloway University London , 
UK;  Emma  O’Donoghue , South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK  
Postpartum Depression (PPD) is considered a debilitating disorder that affects 10 -15% of the perinatal population. 
‘Psychological Flexibility’ (PF) is a psychological process identified within Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and 
refers to the exten t an individual can pursue valued activities alongside difficult experiences. Research has suggested that 
PF is relevant to understanding depression and what helps perinatal women flourish and adjust to motherhood. However, 
so far, research has been cross -sectional and focused only on the pre or postpartum phase. This longitudinal study 
therefore aimed to examine the extent to which PF prospectively predicts PPD and flourishing in women from pregnancy 
to the postpartum phase, and whether PF provides a buffe ring effect, moderating the impact of known risk factors (e.g., 
social support, history of depression, etc) on later levels of PPD/flourishing. More than 220 pregnant women from the 
community completed measures online. PF was measured using The Multidimens ional Psychological Flexibility Inventory 
(MFPI; Rolfss et al., 2018) and Personalised Psychological Flexibility Inventory (PPFI; Kashdan et al., 2020). The follow -up 
collection is still active and will consist of at least 100 women in the postpartum phase . This presentation will present novel 
data on the role of PF in understanding vulnerability to PPD and its role in fostering flourishing in perinatal women. 
Treatment implications will be discussed.

Introduction : Loneliness is a significant problem for CYP and associated with physical and mental health difficulties. This 
has been further exacerbated by social isolation caused by COVID -19. In adults, CBT is effective for chronic loneliness but 
no comparable CBT inte rvention for CYP exists. The aim was to develop an intervention for chronic loneliness in CYP and 
conduct a preliminary evaluation of its efficacy.  
Method : We conducted a pilot and multiple baseline single -case experimental design (SCED) to assess the eff icacy and 
feasibility of the intervention. Nine 11 –18-year -olds were recruited. The design consisted of AB+ post -intervention. 
Loneliness was repeatedly assessed using the Three -item Loneliness Scale, which is the primary outcome. Secondary 
outcomes are re liable and clinically meaningful change on the UCLA Loneliness Scale, RCADS and SDQ. Feasibility and 
satisfaction were also examined. The methodology and intervention was developed in collaboration with CYP and parents.  
Results : We are currently in the fin al stage of data collection. We will present full results at the conference and initial 
results are promising. This will include data on primary and secondary outcomes and feasibility and participant satisfaction.  
Discussion : This study reports one of the first interventions evaluating CBT for loneliness in CYP. This study has significant 
implications for clinical practice, particularly for those experiencing chronic loneliness with anxiety and depression.

Introduction : Loneliness is common in youth, and may arise due to a tendency to select threatening over benign 
interpretations of social situations, and a preference for social withdrawal over social app roach. Cognitive bias modification 
(CBM) training to reduce these biases may therefore be a useful tool for alleviating youth loneliness, but this is yet to be 
explored. In this study, we aimed to (i) develop age -appropriate, ecologically valid materials t o be used in a CBM training 
task targeting youth loneliness, and (ii) evaluate whether a single session of CBM training can modify interpretation biases 
in social situations, and feelings of loneliness, compared with control training.  
Method : Working with young people with experience of loneliness, we generated items for the CBM training. Young 
people aged 18 -24 with high loneliness were subsequently recruited into an experimental study, and randomly allocated to 
either a single CBM (n=29) or control (n=26)  training. Loneliness and interpretation biases in social situations were 
measured pre and post training.  
Results : Preliminary analyses indicate training effects on both interpretation biases and loneliness levels.  
Discussion : These findings suggest that interpretation biases relevant to youth loneliness may be modifiable, and CBM 
training could reduce feelings of lon eliness. This could inform psychological models of loneliness, as well as the 
development of CBM interventions for targeting loneliness in young people.  
 
Development and Usability of the KibA app: An mHealth Application to Support Expo sure -Based Cognitive 
Behaviour Therapy in Children and Adolescents

Specific phobias in children are highly prevalent and have a great impact on their development. An effective treatment is 
exposure -based cognitive behavioral therapy. However, several studies showed that exposure could be used better during 
the treatment s essions and at home. A mobile app could enhance exposure in children thereby increasing treatment 
outcome. This paper includes the development and evaluation of the KibA app; An app especially developed for children 
between 7 and 14 years. The app includes  evidence -based techniques, has a reward system, a photo and video option, a 
child -friendly interface, includes personalised practice exercises on different levels, and is available for Android and Apple. 
The app is attached to a therapist environment wher e therapists can login to include the exposure exercises for a child and 
where they can follow the progress of the child. The development of the app consisted of 4 stages and included 32 children 
between the ages of 6 and 14 years and their parents, a grou p of scientists and therapists, and a group of 4 IT specialists 
who also programmed the app. The iterative process and the inclusion of all different parties led to the development of an 
evidence -based child -friendly app with a good usability as rated by c hildren and therapists. The iterative process was 
evaluated as very positive by all parties. The app has the potential to enhance exposure during CBT and to increase 
treatment outcome and is currently tested in a RCT.  
 
Social anxiety a nd likeability in adolescents: A longitudinal study

This study aimed to understand the connection between social anxiet y and social relations with peers. The research could 
help with indicating predictors for why children with a social anxiety disorder improve less after CBT than children with 
other anxiety disorders. Our previous studies found that children with social an xiety assumed they are less liked by their 
peers, but on average underestimated their peer -indicated likeability. However, when children avoid social situations, they 
are actually indicated as less liked by their peers. The current study aimed to further e xplore what comes first: anxiety, 
avoidance or lower peer acceptance. We used a longitudinal design with 282 participants in the first three years of 
secondary school. Participants completed questionnaires about social anxiety, their estimates of their own  likeability by 
peers, and they named their peers which they liked the most and least. This resulted in discrepancy scores between their 
estimated and actual likeability according to peers. The results of the crossed lagged panel model showed that the leve ls of 
anxiety symptoms and the likeability measures were relatively stable over time. Results also suggested that worrying about 
social functioning precedes the tendency to avoid social situations, which is followed by lower peer acceptance. We 
concluded t hat it is important to pay attention to subtypes in the group of children with social anxiety. Further results and 
implications will be discussed.

Only a minority of people with  eating disorders receive psychological treatments. The COVID -19 pandemic has increased 
this treatment gap. Therapist -led treatments, such as CBT for eating disorders, are inherently limited in their availability 
and difficult to scale up. An alternative i s programme -led treatment, where the intervention is delivered by the programme 
rather than the therapist (self -help). Digital CBTe is a novel self -help programme, available as a smartphone app and 
website, for people with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. It is closely derived from Enhanced Cognitive 
Behaviour Therapy (CBT -E) for eating disorders and its associated printed self -help programme (Overcoming Binge Eating). 
This digital programme has been adapted to the needs of individuals with these disorders through usability testing and has 
been through several iterative cycles of development. A recent proof -of-concept study of the latest version of Digital CBTe 
has shown that it is well accepted and appears to have a positive impact on binge eating  and other eating disorder 
psychopathology. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of this treatment.  
 
Brief Group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Non -Underweight Eating Disorders (CBT -T): feasibilit y and 
acceptability  
Elana  Moore , South Yorkshire Eating Disorder Association (SYEDA) , UK; Glenn  Waller , University of Sheffield , UK  
Brief Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT -T) has repeatedly shown to be effective across non -underweight eating disorder 
diagnoses, when delivered 1:1. The present res earch piloted a group adaptation of the CBT -T 1:1 protocol in community 
settings (N=8). Results show large effect sizes in improved eating attitudes, eating behaviours, anxiety and depression. 
Results are comparable to those from 1:1 studies. Patient exper iences of the intervention are reflected upon.  
 
Developing the Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Scale for Eating Disorders (CBTS -ED): A tool for rating clinician 
performance in delivering evidence -based CBT for eating disorders  
Jessica  Beard , University of Sheffield , UK  
Background: Evidence -based cognitive -behavioural therapy for eating disorders (CBT -ED) differs from other  forms of CBT 
due to its strong focus on behaviour change techniques aimed to reduce problematic eating behaviours and achieve 
cognitive change. A wealth of evidence shows that clinicians do not reliably deliver core behavioural components of CBT -
ED, or in deed substantially drift away from CBT -ED treatment manuals. The focus of existing measures, such as the 
Cognitive Therapy Scale -Revised, means they assess generic CBT skills but do not focus sufficiently on the specific skills 
necessary in CBT -ED to help bring about change. Clinicians and supervisors therefore need a suitable tool to accurately 
assess specific clinician skills to deliver CBT -ED. Objective: This pilot study aims to assess different aspects of the reliability 
of the Cognitive Behaviour Thera py Scale for Eating Disorders (CBTS -ED), a measure of session quality in CBT -ED, developed 
by a team of clinical researchers. Method: A group of CBT -ED experts and non -experts who are familiar with CBT -ED 
treatment content independently observed six mock C BT-ED therapy sessions. They rated the clinicians’ in session 
performance using the CBTS -ED. The inter -item consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) and interrater reliability (ICC) of the CBTS -
ED were assessed. Results: Initial data suggests that the CBTS -ED has ac ceptable to good internal consistency and 
moderate to good interrater reliability, demonstrating comparable or improved psychometric properties relative to 
existing CBT therapy quality scales. Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest the CBTS -ED can b e used effectively 
across both expert and non -expert raters, though further data are needed to add to this evidence. Potential research 
questions will be presented (e.g., the value of the measure in training CBT -ED therapists).  
 
Improving availability of CBT for eating disorders: Delivering therapy via the workplace

Introduction:  CBT-T is a 10 -week version of CBT -ED for non -underweight eating -disordered patients and those with 
subthreshold symptoms. Its effectiveness and remission rates are comparable with longer versions of CBT -ED when  
employed with adults and adolescents in routine health settings. However, not all people with eating disorders are able to 
access care that way, due to work commitments. This study explores the feasibility of recruiting to and delivering online

18 
 
 
 CBT-T ther apy in the workplace, as an alternative to health service settings (see Toro et al., 2022 for published protocol). 
Effectiveness will also be measured.  
Methods:  Recruitment to this single -centre, single -group study is based on self -reported eating and wei ght concerns rather 
than diagnosis, potentially enabling access to treatment for employees who have not previously sought help and those 
with sub -threshold eating disorder symptoms. The treatment was advertised to employers across the Midlands of the UK, 
as part of a wider research programme delivering mental health interventions to workers in the workplace (the Mental 
Health and Productivity Pilot; MHPP; mhpp.me).  
Results:  Recruitment has already reached its feasibility target. Online treatment is current ly being delivered over 10 weeks. 
Assessments take place at baseline, mid -treatment (week 4), post -treatment (week 10), and at follow -up (one month and 
three months post -treatment). Qualitative data on participant experiences will be collected at 1 -month f ollow -up and 
analysed using thematic analysis.  For the primary outcome, measures include recruitment, attrition and attendance levels. 
Clinical and work engagement outcomes will be assessed using standardised measures. Early findings are demonstrating 
feasibility and positive effects.  
Discussion:  The outcome to the first follow -up will be presented, to determine the viability of a future fully -powered 
clinical trial of CBT -T in the workplace.

‘Severe and Enduring Eating Disorders’: A Snark for our times?  
Glenn  Waller , The University of Sheffield , UK  
Introduction : In the past decade, the field of eating disorders has seen the emergence of the construct of ‘Severe and 
Enduring Eating Disorders’, particularly in relation to anorexia nervosa. However, the relevant literature has struggled to 
find a meaningful way to define such cases, in terms of either severity or duration. The risk of such a label is that clinici ans 
will use it to justify offering less effective treatment approaches, on the grounds of a fatalism about the chances of the 
patient improving. This presentation will address the origins of the construct, the issues of defining it, and test whether th e 
effects of well -applied CBT for eating disorders are influenced by severity and duration.  
Method : The study examines outcomes fo r a case series of 134 adult patients with anorexia nervosa receiving enhanced 
CBT. The sample were divided into ‘severe’ and ‘enduring’ groups and examined dimensionally, based on their 
characteristics at assessment. Different definitions of each construc t were used, to determine whether there is any way of 
predicting poorer outcome among some groups.  
Results : Overall outcomes were comparable to those found in other studies of this therapy for anorexia nervosa. There was 
no definition of severity or durati on that was linked to any impact on clinical outcomes. This finding is similar to that found 
among adolescents with anorexia nervosa, and in a recent meta -analysis of the relevance (or otherwise) of duration of the 
eating disorder.  
Discussion : The label ‘S evere and Enduring Eating Disorder’ has become widely used. However, there is no clear definition 
of duration or severity that results in clinically meaningful groups being identified, and now we have evidence that it does 
not have any clinical utility whe n predicting who can benefit from therapy. The danger inherent in using this label is that 
clinicians and patients alike assume that they cannot work towards recovery, so give up on trying. These findings stress the 
importance of not allowing ourselves to be persuaded by the existence of a label, when the reality is very different. As 
demonstrated in Lewis Carroll’s work, sometimes the thing that we hunt for with great enthusiasm (the Snark), making up 
characteristics as we go,  turns out to be what we alre ady knew about (a plain old Boojum)

MYRIAD team  
Background : Systematic reviews suggest school -based mindfulness training (SBMT) shows promise in promoting student 
mental health.  
Objective : The MYRIAD trial evaluated the effectiveness and cost -effectiveness of SBMT compared with teaching -as-usual 
(TAU).  
Methods : MYRIAD was a parallel group, cluster -randomised controlled trial. Eighty -five eligible schools consented and 
were randomised 1:1 to  TAU (43 schools, 4232 students) or SBMT (42 schools, 4144 students), stratified by school size, 
quality, type, deprivation, and region. Schools and students (mean (SD); range age=12.2, (0.6); 11 -14) were broadly UK 
population -representative. Forty -three s chools (n=3678 pupils; 86.9%) delivering SBMT, and 41 schools (n=3572; 86.2%) 
delivering TAU, provided primary end -point data. SBMT comprised ten lessons of psycho -education and mindfulness 
practices. TAU comprised standard social -emotional teaching. Parti cipant -level risk -for-depression, social -emotional -
behavioural functioning, and well -being at one -year follow -up were the co -primary outcomes. Secondary and economic 
outcomes were included.  
Findings: Analysis of 84 schools (N=8,376 participants) found no evidence that SBMT was superior to TAU at one -year. 
Standardised mean differences (intervention minus control) were: 0.005 (95%CI: -0.05 –0.06) for risk -for-depression; 0.02 ( -
0.02 –0.07) for social -emotional -behavioural functioning; and 0.02 ( -0.03 –0.07) fo r well -being. SBMT had a high probability 
of cost -effectiveness (83%) at a willingness -to-pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY. No intervention -related adverse events 
were observed.  
Conclusions: Findings do not support the superiority of SBMT over TAU in prom oting mental health in adolescence.  
Clinical implications: There is need to ask what works, for whom and how, as well as considering key contextual and 
implementation factors.

Trust, Sussex Education Centre, Mill View Hospital, UK ; Willem  Kuyken , Department of Psychiatry, University of 
Oxford, UK   
Introduction : Schoolteachers and healthcare workers play a critical role in the education and health of a nation, yet rates of 
teacher and healthcare workers’ stress are disproportionat ely high. We evaluated whether mindfulness -based cognitive 
therapy (MBCT), using ‘Finding Peace in a Frantic World’ [MBCT -FP] and mindfulness -based cognitive therapy for life 
[MBCT -L], could reduce stress and target a range of secondary outcomes.  
Method : The first study randomly assigned secondary schoolteachers to receive instructor -led and self -taught MBCT -FP. 
The second study randomly assigned NHS workers to receive either MBCT -L or wait -list. We measured psychological well -
being and a range of mental h ealth variables. Mixed regressions were used. Mindfulness and compassion were explored as 
potential mechanisms of effects.  
Results : In the first study, 206 teachers from 43 schools were randomized by school to an instructor -led or self -taught 
course. Both formats showed similar rates of participant expectancy and engagement, but the instructor -led arm was 
perceived as more credible. We found the self -taught arm showed significant pre -post improvements in well -being and 
self-compassion, while the instructor -led arm showed such improvements in well -being, mindfulness, self -compassion, 
perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout. Changes over time significantly differed between the groups in all these 
outcomes, favouring the instructor -led arm. The instr uctor -led arm, compared with the self -taught, indirectly improved 
teacher outcomes by enhancing mindfulness and self -compassion as mediating factors. In the second study, we assigned 
234 participants to MBCT -L or to wait -list. 168 (72%) participants comple ted the measures and of those who started the 
MBCT -L, 73.4% (n = 69) attended most of the sessions. MBCT -L improved well -being compared with controls. Effects were

20 
 
 
 also found for stress, depression, and anxiety, but not for work -related outcomes. Mindfulne ss and self -compassion were 
mediators of effects.  
Discussion : Our results suggest both instructor -led and self -taught formats of MBCT -FP are considered reasonable by 
secondary school teachers, but the instructor -led is more effective than the self -taught.  On the other hand, MBCT -L could 
be an effective and acceptable part of a wider healthcare workers well -being and mental health strategy. Both mindfulness 
and self -compassion appeared as potential mechanisms of MBCT.

Mindfulness -Based Cognitive Therapy  — ‘Taking it Further’ (MBCT —TiF) Compared to Wait -list Control in 
the Promotion of Well -being and Mental Health: A Randomised Controlled Trial with Graduates of MBCT 
and MBSR

Introduction : Mindfulness -based programmes (MBPs) have demonstrated effectiveness in promoting mental health and 
well-being in general population samples. However, there is limited evidence on how to sustain these effects post -
treatment and beyond the  duration of traditional MBPs, such as mindfulness -based cognitive therapy [MBCT] and 
mindfulness -based stress reduction [MBSR]. MBCT —‘Taking it Further’ [MBCT -TiF] is a novel twelve -week MBP that was 
developed to help reinforce and sustain learning in tho se that have already completed an MBCT/MBSR programme. The 
primary aim of the current study was to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of the MBCT -TiF programme in a self -
selected adult general population sample of MBCT/MBSR graduates using an onl ine format.  
Methods : A randomised controlled trial with waitlist -control and repeated measures design was used. Two cohorts of 
MBCT/MBSR graduates aged 18 and above were recruited and randomly assigned to either MBCT -TiF or wait -list control 
(WL). The pri mary outcome was self -reported well -being, measured with the 14 -item Warwick -Edinburgh Mental Well -
being Scale (WEMWBS). Participants completed the WEMWBS three times before the start of the intervention, twice 
during the intervention, and once post -interv ention. Secondary outcomes included: anxiety (GAD -7), depression (PHQ -9) 
and psychological quality of life (WHOQOL -BREF). Measures of acceptability included: attendance, self -reported home 
practice, perceived expectations and credibility, teacher quality, unpleasant experiences and harm. The primary analysis 
was intention to treat using complete cases. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT05154266).  
Results : Out of the 164 MBCT/MBSR graduates recruited and randomised across two c ohorts (between June and 
September 2021), 83 were randomised to MBCT -TiF and 81 to WL. 96.4% of the MBCT -TiF arm attended at least half of the 
sessions. MBCT -TiF was significantly more effective than WL at improving well -being, with large effects post -intervention (d 
= 0.78). In terms of secondary outcomes, MBCT -TiF was significantly more effective than WL at improving psychological 
quality of life (d = 0.74) and symptoms of anxiety and depression (d = -0.44 to -0.53), with moderate to large effects post -
intervention.  
Discussion : Our findings demonstrated acceptability and effectiveness of an online format of MBCT -TiF in a self -selected 
adult general population sample of MBCT/MBSR graduates.

Introductio n: Elite athletes face unique stressors that can place them at particular risk of experiencing men tal health 
symptoms and disorders. Sport -specific recognition and assessment tools are available, but whilst a wide range of

21 
 
 
 psychological treatments show positive effects in preventing and treating mental health symptoms and disorders, few have 
been rigor ously tested in elite athletes and the unique environments they operate in. Mindfulness -based programmes 
(MBPs) are becoming increasingly popular in elite sport for their potential to improve performance alongside mental 
health. Careful adaptation of these  programmes is required when targeting specific groups and new contexts, such as elite 
athletes, to maximise acceptability, effectiveness, ease of implementation, and scalability. The objective of this review was  
to systematically evaluate the best availab le evidence to determine the effect MBPs had on elite athletes’ mental health.  
Methods : For this systematic review and meta -analysis we searched eight online databases (Embase; PsycINFO; 
SPORTDiscus, MEDLINE; Scopus; Cochrane CENTRAL; ProQuest Dissertation s & Theses; Google Scholar), plus forwards and 
backwards searching from included studies and previous systematic reviews. Studies were included if they were 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a MBP against a control, in current or former eli te athletes. Between 
group differences were analysed for: (1) anxiety symptoms; (2) depression symptoms; (3) psychological well -being; (4) 
psychological distress; (5) stress; and (6) mindfulness.  
Results : Of 2,386 articles identified, 12 RCTs were included  in the systematic review and meta -analysis, comprising a total 
of 613 elite athletes (313 MBP; 300 controls). Overall, MBPs improved mental health, with large significant pooled effect 
sizes for reducing symptoms of anxiety (hedges g = -0.87, number of st udies (n) = 6, p = .02, I2 = 90), stress (g = -0.91, n = 5, 
p = .01, I2 = 74), and increased psychological well -being (g = 0.96, n = 5, p = .04, I2  = 89). Overall, the risk of bias and 
certainty of evidence was moderate and all findings were subject to hi gh estimated levels of heterogeneity.  
Discussion : MBPs demonstrated positive effects in improving elite athletes' mental health. Future research should 
concentrate on utilising high -quality MBPs that are adapted for elite sport settings and implemented wit h careful 
consideration of the requirements each unique environment has.

Background: Complex traumas are traumatic experiences that involve multiple interpersonal threats during childhood or 
adolescence, such as repeated abuse. These traumas are hypothesised to cause more severe psychopathology and poorer 
cognitive function than other non -complex traumas. However, empirical testing has been limited to clinical/convenience 
samples and cross -sectional designs.  
Aims: To investigate psychopathology an d cognitive function in young people exposed to complex, non -complex or no 
trauma, from a population -representative longitudinal cohort, and to consider the role of pre -existing vulnerabilities.  
Method: Participants were from the Environmental Risk Longitu dinal Twin Study, a population -representative birth cohort 
of 2232 British children. At age 18 years (93% participation), we assessed lifetime exposure to complex and non -complex 
trauma, past -year psychopathology and current cognitive function. We also pro spectively assessed early childhood 
vulnerabilities: internalising and externalising symptoms at 5 years of age, IQ at 5 years of age, family history of mental 
illness, family socioeconomic status and sex.

22 
 
 
 Results: Participants exposed to complex trauma had more severe psychopathology and poorer cognitive function at 18 
years of age, compared with both trauma -unexposed participants and those exposed to non -complex trauma. Early 
childhood vulnerabilities predicted risk of later complex trauma exposu re, and largely explained associations of complex 
trauma with cognitive deficits, but not with psychopathology.  
Conclusions: By conflating complex and non -complex traumas, current research and clinical practice underestimate the 
severity of psychopathology , cognitive deficits and pre -existing vulnerabilities linked with complex trauma. A better 
understanding of the mental health needs of people exposed to complex trauma could inform the development of new, 
more effective interventions.

Investigating comorbidity in children and young people with posttraumatic stress  disorder (PTSD) could have implications 
for the treatment of young people exposed to traumatic experiences. One comorbid symptom of note is hearing voices. 
Whilst research has explored psychotic -like experiences in young people (Laurens et al., 2007), res earch investigating the 
link between such experiences and PTSD has so far been limited to adult samples (e.g., Anketell et al., 2010). The present 
study explored the incidence of hearing voices in young people aged 8 -17 with a diagnosis of PTSD after multi ple trauma 
exposure using the baseline data from the DECRYPT trial (Allen et al., 2021). Youth who experienced voices in the last 2 
weeks (n = 50) were compared to youth who did not (n = 70). Specifically, analyses were conducted to assess whether 
voices w ere more prevalent in young people exposed to sexual trauma compared to non -sexual trauma, whether hearing 
voices is related to PTSD severity and whether hearing voices is related to negative trauma -related beliefs. Results are 
discussed with relation to c ognitive models of psychosis and the treatment of PTSD in children and young people using 
psychological therapies.

Post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common, but not universal, response to trauma in children and adolescents. 
Since the late 1980s the study of PTSD in youth have grown at a phenomenal rate, giving rise to the problem of how to how 
to summarise the  available evidence into clear messages for researchers and clinicians alike. In this presentation I will 
outline the results from six recent systematic reviews that explored correlates and predictors of PTSD in youth, and factors 
associated with the succe ssful treatment of PTSD in this age group. Four systematic reviews concern psychosocial and 
cognitive -behavioural factors associated with the presence of post -traumatic stress in trauma -exposed youth: social 
support (Allen et al. 2021); attachment (Cushing  et al., under review); peri -traumatic cognitive processing (Memarzia et al., 
2021); and negative trauma -related appraisals (Gomez de la Cuesta et al., 2019).  Two reviews concern elements of the 
treatment of PTSD in youth, in particular the acceptability of mainstream psychological therapies for PTSD in this age group 
(Simmons et al., 2021), and the influence of therapist qualifications and training on the efficacy of PTSD treatment 
(Grainger et al., 2022). The implications of these data for our theoretica l understanding of PTSD in youth and the wider 
delivery of effective treatment will be outlined.

 Exploring differences in the diagnosis and treatment deci sions for children in care compared to their peers: 
An experimental study on Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder

Objectives: Despite e vidence of high rates of diagnosable mental health difficulties in children in care, there remains 
ongoing debate around the appropriateness of traditional diagnoses and treatments. The aim of this study was to 
quantitatively explore whether mental health diagnosis and treatment decision -making differed when a young person was 
identified as being in care, specifically focused on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a trauma -specific mental 
health disorder with rates substantially higher in children  in care versus their peers.  
Methods: Participants were 270 UK mental health professionals who completed an online survey. Participants were 
randomised to receive one of two vignettes, which were identical in their description of a teenage boy experiencing  PTSD 
symptoms, except in one he was in foster care and in the other he lived with his mother. Participants were asked to select 
a primary diagnosis, treatment approach, and potential secondary diagnosis.  
Results: Professionals were twice as likely to choose a primary diagnosis of PTSD and a NICE -recommended PTSD treatment 
when randomised to the mother vignette versus the foster carer vignette. Selecting PTSD as the primary diagnosis made 
clinicians three t imes more likely to select a NICE -recommended treatment for PTSD. Developmental trauma was the most 
common “diagnosis” for both groups, although this led to different treatment decisions.  
Conclusions: In the context of PTSD, we found children in care face diagnosis and treatment decision -making biases. 
Practice implications are discussed.  
 
A meta -analytic review of group -based interventions for treating post -traumatic stress symptoms in children 
and adolescents

Background: Trauma exposure in childhood is common and can lead to a range of negative mental health outcomes, 
including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In many services and communities, resources to address th is distress are 
scarce. Compared to best -evidenced individual psychological intervention, group -based interventions often require 
minimal resources and training, can be delivered by non -mental health specialists, and target larger numbers of young 
people.  
Methods: Our meta -analysis sought to establish whether such an approach is an effective method for targeting PTSD 
symptoms, and to identify potential moderators of effectiveness. We searched PubMed, PsycNET and PTSDPubs for RCTs 
which used a group -based P TSD intervention, with children aged 6 -18 years. Data were extracted for PTSD symptoms and 
depression symptoms. We conducted a random effects meta -analysis to obtain between group pooled effect size 
estimates.  
Findings: The initial search identified 9,650  studies, of which 42 were eligible for inclusion (N=5,998). Children randomised 
to a group -based PTSD intervention had significantly lower PTSD symptoms post -treatment compared to control, with a 
medium pooled effect (g= -0.55, CI -0.76, -0.35). Significan t between group differences were maintained when compared to 
a passive versus active control (although effect sizes were stronger against passive control); at follow -up; and for 
depression symptoms. There was a large amount of heterogeneity, but no evidenc e that this was explained by whether the 
intervention was delivered in a low -to-middle income or high -income country, included caregivers, or was a universal or 
targeted intervention.  
Interpretation: Group delivered PTSD interventions, particularly those which are CBT -based, are effective at targeting 
children’s post -trauma distress. There was evidence of effectiveness when delivered in highly complex and resource -scarce 
settings and to a range of trauma -exposed groups, including those exposed to war/confl ict, natural disasters, and abuse.

Though there have been considerable developments in culturally responsive and sensitive CBT in recent decades, wide 
dissemination of learning in clinical practice is required. Statistics illustrating the harsh reality of the implications of 
inequities for racially minoritised communities are not debatable. We make no apologies for our continued commitment to 
advancing work in this area. This inspiring sympo sium takes us on a journey, mapping out ways to better engage and 
support different racially minoritised groups. The first speaker presents learning on the Gypsy Roma Community; a 
forgotten people, counting the cost and seeking to address the disparity. Re search findings on work with Gypsy, Roma, and 
Traveller communities exploring their experiences in mental health. Highlighting gaps in care and barriers in access to 
treatment, and implications for the IAPT programme. The second speaker will then consider evidence base and lessons 
learned on working with Refuge and Asylum -seeking populations at service and therapist level. Implementation of the 
‘BAME’ PPG audit tool reviewing race equity in access, engagement, and workforce within IAPT. Examples of working with 
voluntary sector services to identify and address barriers to access. Highlighting challenges, putting theory to practice, 
improving experiences and outcomes. The third speaker will review learning from application of a culturally responsive 
online gr oup; combining anti -oppressive practice with CBT interventions. Looking at mental health through the lens of race 
- a social construct exploring whiteness and implications of navigating stereotype and power. Supporting participants to 
reclaim and re -define  their identity - rewriting the narrative, exploring impact of micro aggression and generational trauma 
on wellbeing. Who has access to research routes for decimation of learning? We ask services what they are doing to target 
underrepresented populations. O ur fourth speaker considers empirical findings on addressing barriers within a Bangladeshi 
population who have the lowest rates of access to IAPT services. Clinical guidance is provided for commissioners, services 
and health professionals. We ask what we/y ou/us can do to address the systemic barriers to equitable access, experience 
and outcomes for racialised communities?

This review focuses on the theme of improving access to mental health services for people of Gypsy, Roma, and Travellers 
background. Gypsy, Roma, and Travellers (GRT) community are an underrepresented group within me ntal health research, 
despite high rates of mental illness and suicide. They are often the most disadvantages and presents with poorest health 
outcomes and difficult engagement with services. Thus, their needs are ought to be explored further to help us un derstand 
and reshape policies and services to better serve GRT population. We conducted a literature review and meta -synthesis of 
current qualitative research exploring the experiences of GRT population with healthcare system and mental health. Our 
finding s highlight the gaps in care and barriers in access to services and treatment, such as stigma, distrust and lack of 
understanding of mental health. We discuss the barriers in help seeking behaviours related specifically to services that are 
currently not s uitable to adequately support to GRT communities. We identified the key concepts which can help improve 
access to services and improve awareness of mental health for the community. We also discussed direct implications on 
the IAPT programme. IAPT programme  was developed in 2008 to help improve access to psychological therapies for people 
with common mental health problems by providing simple and quick access through self -referrals. However, after 14 active 
years, there are still many gaps in access, especia lly for GRT population. Many face barriers entering IAPT services, both 
cultural and structural. Roma community often faces language barrier with lack of interpreters available to services who 
can speak Roma language. Travellers and Gypsy communities are o ften turned away from IAPT and GP surgeries due to 
their culture and lifestyle. Our findings highlight these structural barriers and discuss adaptations to minimise them.  We 
also found that GRT as an ethnic category is currently not recorded as a minimum dataset for IAPT, which means that 
services are missing out important data to help provide necessary adjustments and adaptations for this population. Due to 
lack of data, we are unable to understand specific differences between services and learn from prac tice. Implications and 
recommendations to improve access and provide cultural adaptations for interventions are also discussed.

The importance of developing culturally sensitive and responsive services to better meet needs of under -represented 
racially minoritize d groups has been nationally recognised. The BAME Positive Practice Guide (2019) clearly outlines the 
need to improve IAPT services racial equity for access, engagement, adaptation, and the workforce. However, the 
application of the BAME PPG, including its  embedded audit tool is varied across services. We look at steps taken by an IAPT 
service to improve access for underrepresented and racially minoritized groups by implementing change in line with the 
guidance. We highlight work with Refugee and Asylum see ker populations both at a service and therapist level in the IAPT 
service. Compared to other patients seeking primary care psychological services, Refugees and those seeking asylum are 
likely to experience more complex levels of need, both psychologically and socially. Despite this they are underrepresented 
in IAPT services. We focus on examples of working with voluntary sector services and community engagement work. 
Change implementation and clinical application considerations around help -seeking across cu ltures, non -Western 
perceptions of mental health, rethinking service delivery and needs of non -English speakers are explored. The role of 
therapist beliefs, supervision and training are discussed in actively engaging with therapists around this important w ork.  
Through these examples we examine the challenges of putting theory into practice in an IAPT setting. This initial learning is  
then used to make suggestions to support development of IAPT services. It is essential that IAPT services are active in 
deve loping to meet the needs of underrepresented, disadvantaged, and vulnerable groups if it is to provide care that 
accessible, safe, culturally responsive and truly for us all.

Mental health services need to accept, understand and manage the effects of legacies of oppression and racism on our 
British shores. Repetitive statistics highlighting the prevalence of poorer outcomes in mental/physical health for  the 
African, Caribbean & Asian communities are not coincidental. Neither can they be accepted as the status quo or seen as 
intrinsic to minoritised ethnicity. In Global majority populations; minoritised in the UK context; the risks of common mental  
disord er are higher, access to culturally appropriate mental health provision lower.  In addition to less opportunities for 
progression within educational and employment systems. With more challenging socio -economic conditions, whether first, 
second, third or fo urth generations. Studies in the UK indicate that Racially minoritised populations experience repeated 
increased incidences of racialised trauma (Frissa et al, 2013, Majors,Carberry, & Ransaw, 2020).   We review learning from 
application of a culturally ad apted online group, combining anti -oppressive practice with CBT interventions. Exploring 
mental health through the lens of race - a social construct exploring whiteness and implications of navigating stereotype 
and power. Supporting participants to reclaim  and re -define their identity - rewriting the narrative, exploring impact of 
micro aggression and generational trauma on wellbeing. Transcultural CBT demonstrates how CBT requires adaptation for 
culture and context (Beck 2016). The 2019 IAPT BAME Positive P ractice Guide endorses cultural adaptations (Beck et al, 
2019). CBT idiosyncratic models can be adapted to centre difficulties within the context of social constructions of 
whiteness and race. The trauma of oppression; has varied aetiologies of stressors w hich threaten personal safety, violate 
autonomy and can be both overt and covert. Developed through ostracisation, discrimination, poor access to resources 
due to systemic structures and social positioning. Cultural Trauma may be linked to the impact of bi as in the treatment 
towards racially minoritised groups in comparison to the dominant culture. * This can create a crushing of identity and self -
worth, imposition of expression and assertion of power.  In preparing data for a consecutive single case series  we review 
qualitative and quantitative data; and consider who has access to research routes for decimation of learning? We ask 
services what they are doing to target underrepresented populations.

In the UK, men are reluctant to seek support & disclose mental health problems, with higher rates of suicide in racially 
minoritised eth nic groups. Despite the large South Asian Bangladeshi population in London, their use of mental health 
services is low comparative to White Britons. The Bangladeshi community is considerably the most disadvantaged of 
Britain’s ethnic minorities, occupying the worst & most overcrowded housing, high unemployment, with average earnings 
being lower than  any other ethnic group. Furthermore, Bangladeshi men are less represented in Primary Care NHS mental 
health services in England, such as Improving Access to Ps ychological Therapies (IAPT) services. Social and economic 
inequalities have a major impact on mental health & to tackle these inequalities, services must give more attention to 
people at greatest risk of poor health.The needs of the Bangladeshi community in Britain are not being fully met and this 
empirical study hoped to improve understanding and knowledge of the community and how better to support men, who 
are likely to be at risk of difficulties. The aim of this study was to qualitatively explore stigma  and help -seeking for mental 
health difficulties, within British -Bangladeshi Muslim men. What attitudes related to mental health, stigma and help -
seeking exist within this population? Twelve British -Bangladeshi Muslim men in London were recruited, aged bet ween 22 
and 59, experiencing symptoms of anxiety and/or depression but not accessing formal support. An initial online Qualtrics 
screening questionnaire was completed and men who met criteria were then interviewed. Individual semi -structured video 
intervie ws were completed between May and October 2020, during the COVID -19 pandemic, exploring men’s views 
around mental health, accessing support and stigma. Ethical approval was obtained from Royal Holloway, University of 
London and participants were debriefed.  Results from reflexive thematic analysis show 24 subthemes and six overarching 
themes such as ‘different understanding of mental health’, ‘traditional Eastern cultural expectations in the West’, ‘fear and  
loss from a permanent abnormal label’, ‘coping res ources’, ‘access barriers to Western support’ and ‘community outreach 
and collaboration’. There are various factors related to levels of stigma and barriers accessing mental health support. 
Participants suggested initiatives to reduce stigma, raise mental health awareness and help the community access support.

Effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy -based interventions for maternal perinatal depression: a 
systematic review and meta -analysis

Uppsala University, Sweden ; Agneta  Skoog Svanberg , Uppsala University, Sweden ; Louise  von Essen , Uppsala 
University, Swe den; Joanne  Woodford , Uppsala University, Sweden  
Background: Perinatal depression is prevalent condition which impact negatively upon mothers, infants, families and wider 
society. The evidence based suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) based interventions are effective for perinatal 
depression, however the effect upon important secondary outcomes, and a number of potential clinical and 
methodological moder ators has yet to be examined.  
Methods: A systematic review and meta -analysis was conducted to explore the effectiveness of CBT -based interventions 
for perinatal depression on symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, parenting, perceived social support, and  perceived 
parental competence. Clinical and methodological moderators potentially associated with effectiveness were explored. A 
systematic search was performed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CBT -based interventions for perinatal 
depression. S earches were performed up until November 2021.  
Results: The systematic review included 31 studies (5,291 participants) and the meta -analysis included 26 studies (4,658 
participants). The overall effect size was medium (hedges g = -0.53 [95% CI -0.65 to -0.40]); with high heterogeneity. 
Significant effects were found for anxiety, individual stress, and perceived social support, however few studies included 
these secondary outcomes. In the subgroup analysis; type of control, type of cognitive behavioral thera py, and type of 
health professional were significant moderators of the main effect (symptoms of depression). Some concerns of risk of bias 
were present in many studies and one study had a high risk of bias.

27 
 
 
 Conclusions: CBT -based interventions for perinata l depression appear effective, however results should be cautiously 
interpreted given high levels of heterogeneity and risk of bias presented in many studies. The moderating effect of the type 
professional delivering interventions warrants further study. A dditionally, the results indicate a need to improve 
consistency of reporting across trials with the development of a minimum core data set and to design and conduct trials 
with longer -term follow -up periods.

College London , UK; Potts  Laura , King's College London , UK; Rose  Tinch -Taylor , King's College London , UK; Katie  
Sabin , King's College London , UK; Louise  Howard , King's College London , UK 
Background: Antenatal anxiety and anxiety disorders are very common, impair the functioning of women and potentially 
impact child development and early  parenting.  Exposure -based therapies are effective for anxiety disorders but their 
effectiveness and acceptability for women in pregnancy is not known.  The ADEPT study (Challacombe e t al, 2021) aimed to 
assess the feasibility of running an RCT for women with moderate to severe antenatal anxiety -related disorders, testing 
intensively delivered CBT against standard weekly CBT.  
Methods: Women with PTSD, OCD, Panic Disorder or Social Pho bia were recruited by self -referral, midwife referral, IAPT or 
specialist mental health teams between 12 and 20 weeks of pregnancy and offered individual CBT in one of two formats. 
11 hours of treatment took place during pregnancy, with a postnatal follow -up.  Much of the treatment was delivered 
online.  Qualitative data on the use and acceptability of exposure -based therapy was collected.  
Results: Of 135 women screened, 59 women were randomised into the study with 57 starting and completing treatment in 
pregnancy.  83% of women provided follow up data at 3m postpartum.  Women found both forms of CBT acceptable and 
helpful for anxiety, reporting specific pros and cons for each modality.  They were willing to engage in exposure and 
perceived it as important t o therapy.   
Conclusions: Pregnant women consider exposure -based therapy an acceptable and useful treatment for anxiety problems.

Introduction : Depression and anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum can affect approximately 1 in 5 women and if left 
untreated, and can lead to long -term adverse outcomes for women and children. Access to effective treatments for 
women experiencing moderate -severe per inatal depressive and/or anxiety disorders is limited. To address this problem, 
we developed an on -line group -delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy intervention for perinatal mental health 
(ACT -PNMH).  
Method : An open -label pilot study was conducted o f an 8 -week, group -based ACT intervention delivered on -line for 
women with moderate -to-severe mood and/or anxiety disorders during pregnancy and/or postpartum. The women were 
accessing a specialist Perinatal Community Mental Health Service (PCMHS). Outcome s included session attendance rates, 
dropout rates, crisis/inpatient service use, and standardized symptom scales. Participant's responses to open -ended 
questions in an end of therapy questionnaire were analyzed using thematic analysis.  
Results : Fifty -seve n women were referred to the intervention with 41 (72%) completing treatment. The median number of 
sessions attended was 6. No women required input from crisis/inpatient services. All reported finding the intervention 
helpful. The benefits of the ACT skill s and techniques, the advantages and challenges of attending an on -line group -

28 
 
 
 delivered intervention, and the impact of the COVID -19 were salient themes in the data. At post -treatment, there was a 
significant reduction in symptoms of global distress, depre ssion, and anxiety, and an increase in psychological flexibility.  
Discussion : The group delivery of ACT on -line for women accessing a specialist PCMHS is feasible, safe, and effective. A 
randomized control trial (RCT) is needed to establish the efficacy an d cost -effectiveness of this group -delivered ACT 
intervention.

Introduction:  Dr Anja Wittkowski will use the example of the IMAgINE feasibility study findings to discuss the acceptabil ity 
and the potential benefits of offering a parenting intervention like Baby Triple P to mothers admitted to a Mother and Baby 
Unit (MBU) for severe mental health problems. Although MBUs offer a range of therapeutic interventions, they do not 
routinely of fer more structured parenting interventions. The Baby Triple P intervention consisted of eight sessions, with 
the final four being delivered over the telephone following MBU discharge.  
Method:  This multi -site, parallel -group, single -blind pilot randomised  controlled trial compared the intervention with usual 
care versus usual care in mothers recruited from two MBUs in England. Clinical outcomes including maternal parenting 
competence, bonding and mental health outcomes were assessed at baseline, post -basel ine/intervention (10 weeks) and 
six-month follow -up. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and linear regression models. An economic feasibility 
analysis was also conducted.   
Results:  Thirty -four mothers were randomised, with 21 being retained t o final follow up. Clinical outcomes indicated 
potential improvements in maternal parenting competence, mood and other mental health symptoms as well as bonding. 
Women and staff reported noting positive changes.  
Discussion: Despite this being a feasibilit y study, this was the first trial of a parenting intervention in this particular 
perinatal setting, despite recruitment proving challenging. As part of this presentation Anja Wittkowski will highlight what 
benefits a parenting intervention could offer to m others and their infants being supported by MBUs or perinatal CMHTs.

Introduction : Caring for children alongside coping with psychosis can be e xtremely difficult. Mental health symptoms and 
medication side effects can reduce parental responsiveness, and interfere with important family routines. A reciprocal 
cycle of effects may be created in which poor parental mental health reduces the use of ef fective parenting strategies, 
negatively impacting child behaviour and resulting in a stressful home environment which may serve to worsen parental 
mental health further. Parenting interventions have the potential to disrupt this cycle, improving outcomes for both 
parents and children, and possibly preventing the intergenerational transmission of mental illness, but they have not

29 
 
 
 properly evaluated in parents with psychosis. We report on the first study to evaluate an evidence -based parenting 
intervention f or parents with psychosis.  
Methods : A guided version of the Triple P Positive Parenting programme’s “Every Parent’s Self -Help Workbook” was 
evaluated with ten parents experiencing psychosis in a multiple baseline case series study. Sessions were weekly and  
home -based. Outcome measures examined aspects of parenting, including parenting self -efficacy, child behaviour and 
parental mental health, including psychosis symptoms. Semi -structured interviews were conducted as part of the follow up 
to allow in -depth e xploration of parents’ experiences of the intervention, and to elicit their reflections on its impact.  
Results : Five participants (50%) completed all ten sessions of Triple P and for these five, clinically significant change 
(&gt;25% improvement) was obse rved in in mental health, parenting and child behaviour measures post -intervention. 
Improvements were maintained at 3 and 6 month follow up. Interviews with those who completed the programme 
revealed it to have been transformative: parents reported positiv e changes in parenting style; they were empowered 
regarding their parenting and had a greater sense of control over their mental health.  
Discussion : This is the first evaluation of an evidence -based parenting intervention for parents with psychosis. It pr ovides 
preliminary evidence that self -directed Triple P might be able to improve family functioning and reduce the symptoms of 
psychosis in parents who engage with it. Findings have been used to inform an NIHR -funded feasibility trial of Triple P for 
paren ts with psychosis within adult mental health services.

What are the needs and experiences of parents with psychosis and what interventions exist to address these 
needs?

Oxford , UK  
Study 1: Qualitative interviews with parents with psychosis  
Intro:  The symptoms of psychosis and side -effects of antipsychotic medication can impact on parents’ awareness of the 
needs of their children and, at times, the parent may be emotionally and practically unavailable to the child. This study 
aims to investigate the needs and experience of parents with psychosis in order to identify how best to support this parent 
group.  
Methods:  Twelve parents with psychosis and with a child aged between 3 and 11 years took part in semi -structured 
interviews. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.  
Results and discussion:Two overarching themes were identified: 1) the  impact of psychosis on parenting and 2) the impact 
of parenting on psychosis. The first theme described how the experience of psychosis can impact on the parent’s ability to 
care for their child, their self -confidence, and their desire to protect their ch ild. The second theme explained how the stress 
from parenting was identified as a possible trigger for a psychotic episode for some parents. The interaction between the 
two themes highlights the cyclical relationship between parenting and psychosis, and th e need for research to examine this 
relationship further.  
Study 2: A scoping review of parenting interventions for parents with psychosis  
Intro:  There is limited evidence on parenting interventions for parents with psychosis. It is not yet known what, if a ny, 
interventions exist for this population, or what kinds of evaluations have been conducted.  
Methods:  We conducted a scoping review to determine 1) what parenting interventions have been developed for parents 
with psychosis, 2) what components these int erventions contain, and 3) what kinds of evaluations have been conducted.  
Results:  Thirty -four interventions were included. The findings show that most interventions have been broadly designed for 
parents with any mental illness, and only two intervention s were trialled with a group of parents with psychosis. Five types 
of interventions were identified: 1) talking about parental mental illness, 2) improving parenting skills, 3) long -term 
support, 4) groups for parents with mental illness, and 5) family the rapy. Only eight interventions have or are being 
evaluated using a randomised controlled trial (RCT).  
Conclusions:  More RCTs of these interventions are needed, in addition to further analysis of the components that are the 
most effective in changing outcomes for these families.

 Parents with serious mental illness: how do they conceptualise their support needs and what inpatient 
intervention is available?  
Abby  Dunn , University of Sussex , UK; Samantha  Cartwright -Hatton , University of Sussex , UK; Helen  Startup , 
Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust , UK; Alexia  Papamichail , Kings College, London , UK  
Introduction: Up to 50% of individuals with psychiatric disorders are parents. Parental mental health difficulties are 
associated with impaired outcomes for children and the stresses of parenting can be implicated in the onset and 
maintenan ce of psychiatric symptoms. For parents in receipt of inpatient psychiatric care, these effects are accompanied 
by the challenge of separation from their child during treatment. The provision of targeted support to parents is beneficial 
to the parent -child  dyad, including by limiting the incidence of child psychopathology. Given the nascency of this form of 
intervention, there is utility in generating understanding of the experience and support needs of parents with severe 
mental illness to inform the provi sion of care.  
Method: Systematic review of studies which explored the experience of parents who had received psychiatric inpatient 
care and identified interventions delivered to support them during hospitalisation. In a second study, interviews with 12 
parents with borderline personality disorder and 21 practitioners were carried out and subject to thematic analysis.  
Results: Parents with severe mental illness (SMI) want their parenting role to be identified during treatment and to be 
offered support before  the point of crisis. This support should facilitate connection with other parents and be delivered by 
individuals with an understanding of the intersection of mental health and parenting, Parents and practitioners identified 
an absence of appropriate supp ort within UK mental health services. A systematic review reflected these finding. From 
20,570 records identified, 24 papers were included of which 8 reported on interventions. The sole UK -based study 
described provision for parents which is no longer avai lable. The 16 qualitative papers highlighted the challenges parents 
experience in remaining connected to their child along with an absence of parenting -orientated support.  
Discussion: A growing evidence -base indicates that supporting parents with SMI offer s improved outcomes across a range 
of domains however parents report that their parenting identity and support needs are poorly engaged with. Within 
inpatient care this is exemplified by a failure to respond to the parenting identity of parents and a lack of appropriate 
facilities for child visits. Parents and practitioners highlight the need for improved provision for parents. Doing so would 
offer cascading benefits for parents, children, and wider society.

Introduction : Parenting can be stressful for all parents. Combining parenting responsibilities and coping with psychosis can 
make parents more vulnerable to stress. Research suggest that stressful interpersonal environments and social difficulties 
can exacerbate psychotic symptoms and trigger relapse. Parents with psychosis (PwP) often encounter multiple challenges, 
such as high levels of parental stress, attachment p roblems, low emotional support, poverty, ambivalent communication, 
increased stigmatisation, and risk of losing their children’s custody. These difficulties can have an impact on the 
management of parents psychosis, their children’s mental health and the p arental relationships.  
PwP can benefit from learning new skills such as mentalizing and reflective functioning (RF), which would help them better 
understand and respond to their own and their children's mental states. RF can be increased with psychoeducat ion and 
teaching enhanced communication and behavioural skills. There are currently no evidence -based programs in the UK that 
meet the needs of PwP.   
Methods PwP with children under the age of 18, were invited to take part in an eight -week manualised grou p-based online 
parenting intervention. The focus of the group was to support parents in managing parenting -related stress levels and 
enhance parent -child relationships.  
Results : Outcome data was collected via pre - and post -intervention questionnaires. Chan ges in scores were analysed 
descriptively by comparing individual differences on pre - and post -scores. Qualitative feedback on the group and individual 
experiences were also collected. Parents reported positively to the acceptability and feasibility of the  group and outcome 
measures indicated positive changes in overall wellbeing, parental stress levels and parent -child relationships.  
Discussion : This was a pilot study looking at the acceptability and feasibility of a community -based parenting intervention  
for PwP, who have children below the age of 18. The current findings offer a good understanding of the specific needs of 
PwP and provides further insight into the design and delivery of an accessible, acceptable, and effective intervention for 
parents who  are often marginalized by conventional parenting programs. We plan to re -run the group with a greater 
sample size over the next few months and hope to publish recommendations on how to embed the parenting intervention 
in existing adult psychology services .

Introduction: Mental and physical health treatment should be delivered together for children and young people with 
epilepsy. Training healthcare professionals (HCPs) in epilepsy services to deliver mental health interventions is an 
important way to facilit ate integrated care. The Mental Health in Children with Epilepsy study is a programme of research 
investigating such interventions. Methods: Thirty -four children and young people with epilepsy who had impairing 
symptoms of a common mental health difficulty  were allocated to receive 6 months of a modular cognitive behavioral 
intervention delivered by a healthcare professional (HCP) with limited formal psychological therapy experience. Thirteen 
HCPs were trained in delivery of the intervention. Parent -reporte d measures of mental health symptoms and quality of life 
were completed at baseline and following the intervention. Results: All HCPs who participated in the training were 
considered competent in therapeutic delivery by the end of the training period. Twen ty-three patients completed pre - and 
post -intervention measures and were included in the analysis. There were statistically significant improvements in: 
symptoms of mental health problems , total impact of mental health problems, anxiety and depression sym ptoms and 
quality of life. Discussion: The results suggest that it was possible to successfully train these HCPs to deliver the CBT 
intervention. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is currently underway (n=334).

Ormond Street Institute of Child Health , UK 
Background: Children and young people with long -term physical conditions have significantly elevated mental health 
needs. Brief psychological interventions have the potential to increase access to evidence -based psychological treatments 
for patients who at tend health services primarily for physical health needs. This paper reports on a non -randomised study 
conducted to assess the impact of brief psychological interventions in children and young people presenting at a drop -in 
mental health centre in the rece ption area of a paediatric hospital. Methods: 186 participants attending the drop -in centre 
were allocated to assessment and psychological intervention. Interventions included signposting, guided self -help based on 
a modular psychological treatment and ref erral to the hospital’s paediatric psychology service. Results: 186 participants 
were allocated to the intervention, of which 156 were analysed. Following initial assessment, 32% of participants were 
provided with a brief CBT, 45% were referred onwards, 1%  liaison work was carried out, 3% underwent a 
neurodevelopmental assessment and 19% were signposted to resources/services. There was a significant positive impact 
of attending the drop -in mental health centre on mental health symptoms and quality of Life S cale according to measures. 
Discussion: A mental health drop -in centre offering brief assessment and treatment may reduce emotional and behavioural 
symptoms and improve quality of life in children and young people.

Health , UK; Dougal  Hargr eaves , Imperial College London , UK; Benjamin  Ritchie , CORC Child Outcomes Research 
Consortium , UK 
Introduction: C hildren and young people (CYP) with a long -term health condition (LTC) are much more likely to develop 
mental health difficulties than the general population. There is a lack of understanding about the routine provision and 
efficacy of mental health interv entions for CYP with LTCs who are in contact with Children and Young People’s Mental 
Health Services (CYPMHS). Methods: This study analysed national service -reported data in England from two secondary 
datasets. Data on CYP periods of contact were submitted  by services between 2011 and 2019, although some admission 
dates were prior to this. CYP were included in the analysis if there were data on the presence or absence of a physical 
health issue, including neurological issues, and which interventions they we re offered. Results: A total of 789 CYP were 
flagged as having serious physical health issues and 635 as having neurological issues. The most common intervention for 
CYP with a serious physical health issue was Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and for t hose with a neurological 
condition the most common was Parent Training. However, a large percentage of interventions remained unclassified. The 
majority of young people showed improvements across all outcome measures in both groups. Discussion: The finding s 
suggest that CYP with LTCs improve across a range of mental health outcomes following interventions delivered by 
CYPMHS. Many interventions were unable to be categorised.

 Illness related cognitions and Mental Health in Teenage and Yo ung Adult Cancer Survivors  
Cara  Davis , University of Bath , UK; Mike  Horwood , University of Bath , UK; Maria  Loades , University of Bath , 
UK; Urska  Kosir , Uni versity of Oxford, UK  
Introduction: Despite the theoretical rationale from the Common Sense Model and existing evidence in adults of 
associations between illness specific cognitions (fear of cancer recurrence, FCR and illness perceptio ns) and mental health, 
there is limited empirical research examining these constructs within the developmentally distinct population of young 
adult survivors of teenage cancer. The current study aimed to bridge that gap to inform potential cognitive treatm ent 
targets in this population.  
Method: Cross -sectional, correlational design to examine the associations between variables of interest. A web -based 
survey was used to collect data. Participants were a convenience sample, recruited over 14 months, via sev eral charities 
(e.g., Shine), support groups (e.g., Trekstock) and social media (e.g., Instagram).  
Results: The final sample consisted of 90 TYA cancer survivors, aged 16 -30. Overall, more negative illness perceptions were 
associated with depression, anxi ety and fear of cancer recurrence (r > 0.6). Illness concern, identity, consequences and 
personal control were the specific illness perceptions that were particularly strongly associated with all outcome variables.  
Regression analysis was conducted to expl ore potential interactions.  
Conclusions: The associations suggest that identifying and therapeutically targeting negative illness perceptions in those 
young adults who have survived teenage cancer could be a means of reducing psychological distress. Furth er work is 
needed using longitudinal and experimental methods.

Neuroscience, King's College London , UK 
Introduction: Stigma can impair self -esteem. Low self -esteem is associated with various mental health conditions. This 
uncontrolled study evaluated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a CBT intervention targeting low self -
esteem in people with different stigmatised characteristics, aged 16 -24 years.  
Method: Participants w ith stigmatised characteristics, low self -esteem and impaired daily functioning, were recruited from 
the general population. The six -session intervention included compassion -focused therapy methods and was informed by 
stigma research. Feasibility outcomes involved recruitment, retention, and protocol -adherence. Questionnaires assessing 
self-esteem, functional impairment, depression, anxiety and other outcomes were administered at baseline, pre -, mid -, 
post -intervention, and two -month follow -up.  
Results: Sc reening was completed by 44 people and 73% were eligible. Of these, 78% consented to take part and 69% 
(N=22) began CBT. Eighteen (82%) participants completed. Treatment completers reported the intervention was useful, 
improved their self -esteem and coping , and would recommend it. Ratings of usefulness and frequency of use of 
intervention components were high.  
Discussion: This intervention was feasible and highly acceptable to treatment completers. A randomised controlled trial is 
now required.

Dehumanisation, stigma, and epistemic injustice in psychosis  
Chair: Pamela Jacobsen, University of Bath, UK  
 
Epistemic injustice:  An introduction to the concept  
David  Harper , University of East London , UK 
This conceptual paper begins with  Miranda Fricker’s (2007) elaboration of the concept of “epistemic injustice which 
encompassed two different forms of injustice: (a) testimonial injustice, whereby “prejudice causes a hearer to give a

33 
 
 
 deflated level of credibility to a speaker’s word” (p. 1), and (b) hermeneutical injustice, which “occurs at a prior stage, 
when a gap in collective interpretive resources puts someone at an unfair disadvantage when it comes to making sense of 
their social experience” (p. 1). Fricker was primarily concerned wi th injustice concerning a person’s status as a “knower.” 
These definitions will be illustrated with examples drawn from a range of different topics including scholarship and 
research on stigma (e.g. Harper & Vakili, 2021), delusions and medicalisation (Har per, 2021).   
Epistemic injustice will be put in a broader historical context of critiques of colonialism and related notions like “epistem ic 
violence”. A recent search on Scopus identified 768 publications between 1996 -2022.  Nearly two thirds of the 146 
publications in the subject areas of nursing, medicine and psychology were published between 2020 -2022. Topics include 
communicating across language divides, how children can experience epistemic injustice, applications to particular kinds of 
problem ( e.g. dementia, race, borderline personality diagnoses, self -injury etc).  Initially scholars and researchers focused 
on testimonial injustice but, increasingly, attention has been paid to hermeneutical injustice as well as the way in which 
healthcare pract itioners experience epistemic privilege.  
The paper will close by identifying some of the potential contributions the concept of epistemic injustice could make to 
addressing the dehumanisation, stigma and discrimination experienced by people with psychosis diagnoses as well as 
dilemmas it might pose.

Introduction: People with mental  health conditions, such as psychosis, are at high risk of epistemic injustice. This is a form 
of discrimination whereby someone is unfairly judged to be unreliable (testimonial injustice) or is unable to contribute to 
and therefore access concepts that ma ke sense of their experience within mainstream society (hermeneutical injustice). 
Experiences such as hearing voices occur both in people who are mental health service users with varied diagnoses (for 
example, psychosis) as well as in the general populatio n (clinical and non -clinical voice -hearers respectively).  The degree of 
distress and impairment associated with voices relates to how individuals make sense of their experiences and how others 
respond to their identity as a voice -hearer, both of which may  be impacted by epistemic injustice. Despite this, there is a 
lack of research exploring voice -hearers experiences of this form of discrimination. The aim of this study was to explore 
people’s experiences of epistemic injustice in relation to voice -hearing , and to understand how these may differ between 
clinical and non -clinical voice -hearers.  
Method: Eight clinical and nine non -clinical voice -hearers take part in qualitative semi -structured interviews. Interviews 
were transcribed verbatim and analysed usin g thematic analysis.  
Results: Eight themes were constructed overall. Three pairs of themes related to i) identity, ii) relationships and iii) powe r 
and position across the clinical and non -clinical groups, and two shared themes arose within both groups re lating to 
testimonial and hermeneutical injustice.  
Discussion: Both clinical and non -clinical voice -hearers described experiencing epistemic injustice in wider society, with 
voice -hearing being both misunderstood and heavily stigmatised. The presence of a ‘safe haven’ for non -clinical voice -
hearers ameliorated the impact of this to some degree, by allowing people to make connections with others with similar 
experiences within a non -judgemental and accepting community. Thus, this study shows both clinical an d non -clinical 
voice -hearers experience epistemic injustice, but that it differs in its form and severity between the groups. These findings 
could better inform strategies to reduce stigma and marginalisation in people who hear voices. In addition, it high lights the 
need for professionals and services to consider and target systemic processes of discrimination to effectively support this 
client group.

 Experiences of Dehumanisation in People with Psychosis: A Conceptualisation, Mea sure Development and 
Therapeutic Intervention  
Tom  Jenkins , University of Bath , UK; Paul  Chadwick , University of Bath , UK; Pamela  Jacobsen , University of 
Bath , UK  
Introduction: People with psychosis have expressed that a distressing element of their experience is the feeling of 
dehumanisation – feeling less than, or other than human. This may arise from interactions with other people, 
stigmatisation of psychosis in society, and the nature and content of auditory hallucinations. The aim of this project is to 
measure how dehumanisat ion is experienced by people with psychosis and understand whether therapeutic interventions, 
such as mindfulness, can help people reconnect with their sense of humanity. This presentation will include an 
introduction to dehumanisation theory, and how this  relates to people with psychosis. The plans for two empirical studies 
will then be presented:  
Study 1: Development and validation of a scale to measure feelings of dehumanisation in people with psychosis. First, we 
will generate an initial pool of items, using both deductive and inductive methods. We will conduct tests for face validity, 
gathering the perspectives of people with lived experience of psychosis, and content validity, gathering the perspectives of 
academic and clinical experts. Then, we will a dminister the measure to assess reliability and construct validity, allowing us 
to select the most relevant items for the final scale.  
Study 2: Pilot testing of dehumanisation measure in mindfulness for psychosis groups. Mindfulness cultivates attention, 
awareness and acceptance of experience, and has been suggested to have a humanising therapeutic benefit (Chadwick, 
2019). We will pilot test the dehumanisation measure in mindfulness for psychosis groups as part of routine clinical care, to  
see 1) whether m indfulness reduces feelings of dehumanisation and 2) how dehumanisation relates to other measures of 
mental health and wellbeing.  
Implications: The project will provide greater understanding of the experiences of people with psychosis, supporting the 
devel opment and implementation of therapeutic interventions, such as mindfulness, to reduce distress and help people to 
feel a greater sense of humanness.

Dehumanisation in Voice Hearers: The End of Continua  
Bethany  Venus , University of Bath  UK; Pamela  Jacobsen , University of Bath ; Tom  Jenkins , University of Bath  UK; 
Olivia  Harris , University of Bath , UK 
Introduction : Meta -dehumanization and self -dehumanization have been identified as relevant phenomena for developing 
a deeper understanding of distress related to psychosis. Chadwick (2019) has previously argued that people with psychosis 
typically feel “dehumanised and set apart by their experiences of psychosis and trauma” and frames mindfulness for 
psychosi s as a humanising therapeutic process. Exploring the experience of dehumanisation in voice -hearers was selected 
as a useful starting point in understanding dehumanisation in people with psychosis, due to the potential dehumanising 
effect of voices.  The pre sent study was aimed at understanding what constitutes the experience of feeling dehumanised in 
voice -hearers and what factors influence the development and mitigation of this experience, with a view to opening a 
pathway to further exploring the role of de humanisation in distressing psychosis.  
Method : Qualitative data were obtained through twenty semi -structured interviews with self -identifying voice hearers and 
analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. This followed the recursive and iterative six phase  process of Braun and Clarke 
(2022) and this was conducted from a critical realist, contextualist position.  
Results : Reflexive thematic analysis of participant’s experiences produced a core theme, Dehumanisation as the End of 
Experiential Continua, and six  subthemes: “It’s Like Burning Alive”: Extent of Distressing Sensory Fragmentation; “You 
Belong to the Wild and They Belong to the Earth”: Sense of Belonging with Other Humans; “They Destroy Your Sense of 
Self”: Integrity of Self as a Private, Coherent Ent ity; “I’m Part of the Scrap Heap”: Sense of Worth as a Human Being; “They 
Took a Part of Me”: Strength of Personal Agency; “It has a Psychosis Ring Around It”: Trust in Own Credibility and 
Reliability. Two further themes, The Push and Pull of Dehumanising Forces and Reclaiming Life through Humanising Forces, 
were identified.  
Conclusions : For the participants in the present study, distressing psychotic experience is not the end of the line - it is self -
dehumanization that lies at the end of continua. Reflex ive thematic analysis of voice -hearers’ accounts identified self -
dehumanisation as such, a point where six experiential continua coalesce. Movement along these continua was affected by 
a range of interpersonal, intrapersonal, and societal forces, including  dehumanising attitudes of others and voice 
malevolence and omnipotence.

Existing perpetrator interventions only addressed intoxicated IPA, whereas our research highlighted the complex interplay 
between IPA perpetration and the effects of intoxication, withdrawal and craving, gendered power relations and 
controlling behaviours. Our ADVANCE intervention targets these specific risks and needs of men in substance use 
treatment. We established the core elements required for a group therapy programme for men who disclose perpetrating 
IPA in a substance use sett ing. The theoretical development and content of the ADVANCE intervention for (remote) 
delivery in substance use services is described.  We employed the ‘COM -B’ ('capability', 'opportunity', 'motivation' and 
'behaviour') model for intervention design. The A DVANCE intervention was originally developed for face -to-face group 
delivery. As a result of the pandemic, ADVANCE was adapted for remote digital delivery, based on available evidence and 
think aloud interviews with service users.  The ADVANCE intervention focuses on developing participants’ strengths and 
developing healthy, non -abusive relationships. The main targets for change were personal goal planning, self -regulation 
and attitudes and beliefs supporting intimate partner abuse. ADVANCE originally consis ted of a face -to-face delivered 
group intervention comprising of up to 4 pre -group individual sessions, followed by 12 x 2 -hour group sessions. ADVANCE 
digital includes an individual goal -setting session; a welcome to group video session; 6 fortnightly gro up video sessions; 12 
online, interactive digital practice sessions; 12 x 1:1 telephone coaching sessions. ADVANCE was supported by integrated 
safety work for victim/survivors, and risk and safety support and integrity support for professionals.  
A demonstr ation of the ADVANCE digital intrevention will be given.  
 
Substance Use and Intimate Partner Abuse (IPA): A Descriptive Model of the Pathways Between Substance 
Use and IPA Perpetration for Men

Substance use is strongly correlated with IPA perpetration, this relationship is complex and the route leading to substance 
use and IPA is still not well understood. Pathway models have been applied to explore heterogeneous trajectories into 
other behaviou rs and to identify areas for intervention. This approach has not previously been applied in the area of 
substance use and IPA. A better understanding of these routes will inform targeted interventions to reduce IPA.  
A descriptive model of pathways into sub stance use -related IPA perpetration (i.e. IPA associated with intoxication, 
withdrawal, acquisition and substance use lifestyle) based on inductive thematic analysis of 37 narrative interviews with 
heterosexual men aged 28 -52 recruited from substance use s ervices in England who had reported previous IPA 
perpetration was conducted. Three groupings of pathways into substance use -related IPA were generated: 1) Rule 
Breaking Pathway (n=11); 2) Entrenched Substance Use Pathway (n=13); and 3) Relationship Insecur ity Pathway (n=13). 
Across the three groupings of pathways, the men’s childhood and early experiences led to different journeys into 
substance use -related IPA. Each pathway presented differently with varying core features, for example core features of 
gene ralised violence, mental health or jealousy, and different predisposing background factors, including types and timing 
of childhood abuse and trauma.  This presentation describes dominant traits of groupings but recognises the dynamic 
nature of risk and nee d. The benefit of identifying dominant themes is that it increases understanding of risk and need, 
provides points to promote protective factors and informs effective treatment and intervention targets.

 Findings of the feasibility and acceptability of the ADVANCE group intervention (completed) and the ADVANCE digital 
intervention (ongoing) will be presented and compared.  
Two studies were conducted among men in substance use treatment who had perpetrated IPA in the past year. Firstly, in a 
multicentre feasibility trial, 104 men were randomly allocated to receive the ADVANCE group intervention + substance use 
treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 54) or TAU only (n = 50) and assessed 16 -weeks post -randomisation. Secondly, we are 
undertaking a multicentre feasibility study of delivering the ADVANCE digital intervention to 45 men, who will be followed -
up post -intervention. Tablets and data  are provided, contingent on engagement with the ADVANCE digital intervention. 
Female (ex)partners were offered support and provided outcome data. Nested process evaluations were conducted for 
both studies, including qualitative interviews with participant s and staff.  
Qualitative research confirmed the acceptability of both interventions. Therapeutic alliance and session satisfaction were 
rated highly. At follow -up, neither substance use nor IPA perpetration had worsened for men in the intervention arm. The  
overall median rate of group intervention session attendance was 28.6% (range 14.3 –64.3% by the third cycle). The 
evaluation of the ADVANCE digital intervention is ongoing, however, the current median rate of intervention session 
attendance is 61.5% at vi deo groups and 36.7% for digital practice sessions.  
Trained substance use treatment staff can safely deliver the ADVANCE intervention in -person and digitally. Risk to female 
(ex)partners can be effectively managed and mitigated using case management and t he support of an integrated support 
service.

Trust , UK  
Background : Delivering the benefits of efficacious cognitive -behavioural therapies in routine care will be assisted by 
tackling barriers to access, engagement and effects. Technology has great potential to support this by reducing the 
demands of delivery and optimisin g the therapy experience. However, digital therapeutics for mental health often have 
low usage and may exclude marginalised groups, who experience a ‘digital divide’ in technology access and literacy. To 
address this, we adopted inclusive, human -centred de sign to develop a user -friendly and appealing therapy that targets an 
evidence -based mechanism, fast thinking, in paranoia. SlowMo combines a webapp to support sessions with a therapist, 
with a mobile app for use in daily life. It works by encouraging peop le to ‘slow down for a moment’ to find ways of feeling 
safer and living well. SlowMo visualises thoughts as spinning bubbles, with SlowMo tips used to shrink personalised grey, 
worry bubbles and grow colourful, slow -spinning helpful thoughts that support v alued goals. This study aimed to explore 
the user experience of the mobile app, and its relationship to demographics, in the SlowMo randomised -controlled trial.  
Method : Digital literacy was assessed at baseline and multidimensional assessment of engagemen t (i.e. adherence (via 
system analytics and self -report) and self -reported user experience) conducted at 12 weeks (post -therapy). Engagement 
was investigated in relation to demographics (i.e. gender, age, ethnicity, paranoia severity).  
Results : Digital literacy data demonstrated that technology use and confidence were lower in Black people and older 
people (n=168). The engagement findings indicated that 81% of therapy completers (n=140) met a priori analytics 
adherence criteria. However, analytic s adherence did not differ by demographics. High rates of user experience were 
reported overall (75%, SD = 17.06, n=82). No differences in user experience were found for ethnicity, age, or paranoia 
severity, although self -reported app use, enjoyment and us efulness were higher in women than men.   
Discussion : SlowMo may overcome barriers to access of digital therapeutics in routine care. Technology -related 
inequalities related to age and ethnicity did not influence engagement with SlowMo suggesting the thera py design 
supports digital inclusion. SlowMo in a next generation cognitive -behaviour therapy that could address barriers to the 
access of evidence -based therapies in routine care, and its implement

Background : SlowMo therapy is a pioneering blende d digital therapy for paranoia, augmenting face -to-face therapy with 
an interactive 'webapp' and a mobile app. A recent large -scale trial demonstrated positive effects on paranoia alongside 
improvements in self -esteem, worry, well -being and quality of life . This paper provides a comprehensive account of the 
service user experience of SlowMo, with a focus on therapy personalisation within a targeted cognitive -behavioural digital 
therapeutic.  
Method : Core aspects of SlowMo therapy are described with case exam ples to illustrate therapy delivery. Descriptive data 
is presented on personalised thought content extracted from the webapp (n = 140 participants) and coded using a novel 
system of categorisation, to illustrate use of the digital tools. Data on therapy fi delity is also presented.  
Results : The personalised content demonstrated a consistent focus on the a priori SlowMo treatment targets (i.e., 
persecutory thoughts and fear of negative evaluation) with the most common helpful bubbles reflecting paranoia -spec ific 
‘safer thoughts’ and ‘second -wave’ (general) coping. However, there was also clear evidence of use of the digital tools to 
target a broader range of worries (including general life stresses) and helpful bubbles focussing on ‘positive self -concept’ 
and ‘positive activities’. The blended digital approach delivered excellent therapy fidelity with a mean session adherence 
rating of 15.2 (out of 16) and delivery of out -of-clinic work for over 70% of people attending therapy.  
Discussion : SlowMo therapy deliv ers a targeted yet personalised approach. Potential mechanisms of action extend beyond 
reasoning. Slowing down appears to support ‘stepping back’ (decentring or defusion) from unhelpful thoughts and beliefs, 
a cornerstone of cognitive therapy, with potenti al for transdiagnostic application to support quality of life.

Background : SlowMo is the first blended digital therapy for paranoia, showing significant reductions in paranoia over 6 
months in a recent large -scale randomized controlled trial ( RCT). The current studies explore innovations arising from 
public and patient involvement (PPI) and in the subjective service -user experience of the SlowMo therapy content, design 
and triangle of therapeutic alliance.  
Method : The PPI was delivered by six w omen and three men from Sussex, Oxford and London with experience of using 
mental health services for psychosis. The impact was captured quantitatively and qualitatively through (i) a log of PPI 
recommendations and whether these were implemented; (ii) writ ten subjective experiences of the PPI members; (iii) 
meeting minutes; and (iv) outputs produced. One output was the qualitative sub -study. The PPI team co -produced the 
topic guide, interviewed the 22 adult service users who completed at least one SlowMo th erapy session, and contributed

38 
 
 
 to the thematic analysis, which involved multiple coding, triangulation and PPI validation to reach the final theme 
structure.  
Results : The PPI log revealed 107 PPI recommendations, of which 87 (81%) were implemented, to sup port recruitment, 
data collection, organization and dissemination of the study. The innovative PPI approach to this blended CBT therapy 
related to the emergent ‘peer innovator’ role, with novel and unexpected impacts at a societal level, including a peer -led 
film about psychosis that aired on BBC primetime television, novel webpages and journal articles, with a strong normalizing 
message. The qualitative study identified six core themes:(i)starting the SlowMo journey; (ii)the central role of the 
supportive therapist; (iii)slowing things down; (iv)value and learning from social connections; (v)approaches and challenges 
of technology; and (vi)improvements in paranoia and well -being.  
Conclusions : Slowing down for a moment was helpful, and integrated into think ing over time. The central role of the 
supportive therapist and the triangle of alliance between service user, therapist, and digital platform were effective in 
promoting positive therapeutic outcomes. A core innovative theme identified by service users, v alidating the SlowMo 
therapy design, was the potential through this blended CBT therapy approach to use digital media, television and video 
vignettes to promote normalizing messages, reduce feelings of isolation and enable learning from peers with the same  
lived experience.

Effects and Active Ingredients of SlowMo, a Blended Digital Therapy Targeting Reasoning, on 
Paranoia Among People with Psychosis: A Randomized Clinical Trial  
Philippa  Garety , King's College London , UK; Thomas  Ward , King's College London , UK; Kathryn  Greenwood , 
University of Sussex , UK; Amy  Hardy , King's College London , UK 
Introduction : Persistent paranoia is common in psychosis, and developing more effective interventions remains a priority. 
Reasoning, specifically jumping to conclusions and belief inflexibility, may play a causal role in paranoia. SlowMo, a new 
digitally  supported blended cognitive -behavioural therapy, targets these reasoning processes to improve effects. Adopting 
‘fast’ and ‘slow thinking’ as helpful terminology to support therapy, SlowMo encourages people to notice a tendency to 
fast thinking, and to sl ow down for a moment to identify safer thoughts and so to reduce paranoia.  
Method : In this trial, we examined SlowMo’s effectiveness in reducing paranoia and improving reasoning, quality of life 
and wellbeing and its mechanisms of action. This was a parall el-arm, assessor -blind, randomised controlled trial comparing 
SlowMo plus Treatment as Usual (TAU) with TAU alone. It took place in community mental health services in NHS Mental 
Health Trusts in England. We compared 8 face -to-face SlowMo sessions over 12 weeks, supported by a mobile app, plus 
TAU with TAU alone.  
Results : 362 participants with distressing and persistent paranoia were recruited, 181 in the SlowMo intervention group 
and 181 controls. SlowMo had high rates of treatment engagement and completio n. SlowMo was effective at reducing 
paranoia with consistent small -medium effect sizes across a range of self - and observer -rated measures, both at end of 
treatment and 6 month follow -up. It also improved quality of life and well -being, compared to those i n the control group. 
The active ingredients (or mechanisms) of improvements in paranoia were reasoning (slower thinking) and reduced levels 
of worry.  
Discussion : SlowMo is the first digitally supported cognitive -behavioural therapy for paranoia to demonst rate robust 
evidence of uptake, engagement, efficacy, mechanism and positive user experience across a diverse range of NHS patients. 
SlowMo is strongly positioned to translate its benefits to real world settings, and implementation should be investigated i n 
the psychological practitioner workforce.

 Disorder -specific Cognitive Therapy adapted for adolescents with Social Anxiety Disorder and Panic  
Disorder: Recent advances and evidence of effect iveness  
Chair: Polly Waite, University of Reading, UK  
 
Internet -delivered Cognitive Therapy for adolescent social anxiety disorder (OSCA): a randomised 
controlled trial in schools.  
Eleanor  Leigh , University of Oxford , UK; David  Clark , University of Oxford , UK  
Introduction: Cognitive therapy  for Social Anxiety Disorder (CT -SAD) is a first -line recommended treatment for adult social 
anxiety disorder (SAD) and shows considerable promise for youth. However, the high prevalence of adolescent SAD and 
limited number of therapists presents an implem entation challenge. Delivery of CT -SAD via the internet may offer part of 
the solution.  
Method: A two -arm randomised controlled trial of internet -delivered CT -SAD (called OSCA) compared to waitlist for 14 
weeks with 43 adolescents with SAD recruited throug h schools (ISRCTN15079139).  
Results: OSCA outperformed waitlist on all measures and was associated with large effects that were maintained at 6 -
month follow -up. 77% of adolescents lost their SAD diagnosis post (vs. 14% in waitlist), increasing to 91% at 6 -months. 
Beneficial effects of OSCA were mediated through changes in cognitions and safety behaviours as predicted by cognitive 
models of SAD. OSCA was associated with high credibility and therapeutic alliance.  
Discussion: This preliminary trial suggests OS CA holds promise as an effective, accessible treatment for adolescent SAD. 
Future definitive trials could compare OSCA to active comparators to examine specificity of effects.  
 
Brief treatment for adolescents with panic disorder: preliminary findings from the PANDA 
feasibility randomised controlled trial comparing brief cognitive therapy to a general form of CBT  
Polly  Waite , University of Reading , UK 
Introduction: Panic disorder occurs in between 1 -3% of adolescents and is associated with high levels of co -morbidity, and 
without treatment, appears to have a chronic course. To improve access to effective psychological interventions, b riefer 
versions of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) have been developed and evaluated for pre -adolescent children with anxiety 
disorders. However, there are currently no brief evidence -based CBT interventions for adolescents with anxiety disorders 
that ca n be delivered in less than eight sessions. Given that a brief version of cognitive therapy has been shown to be 
effective in adults with panic disorder (Clark et al., 1999), it is possible that an adapted version could be effective for 
adolescents with pa nic disorder. This study aimed to examine whether a definitive trial could be conducted, based on a 
single centre feasibility randomised controlled trial (The Treatment of Panic Disorder in Adolescents: ‘PANDA’ Study; 
https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN14884288 ; for protocol see Waite, 2021) using several well -defined criteria.  
Methods: Thirty -four young people (age 11 -17 years) who met diagnostic criteria for panic disorder, were randomly 
allocated to receive either (i) brief cognitive therapy, or (ii) a genera l form of CBT treatment that is more commonly used 
for adolescents with anxiety disorders. Both treatments were delivered 1:1 (face -to-face and remotely) by children’s 
wellbeing practitioners in a routine NHS -commissioned clinical service and involved five  treatment sessions and two 
booster sessions.  
Results: Young people’s outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment and at 3 month follow up, as well as any negative 
impacts of treatment. Preliminary results will be presented.  
Discussion: The outputs fro m the study will provide a clear indication of the feasibility of a future definitive trial and, if 
indicated, the critical resources that will be required and key information to inform the design and maximise the successful 
completion of the trial. This h as the potential to bring direct benefits to young people and their families, as well as services 
and society more broadly.

The acceptability of brief cognitive therapy and general CBT for panic disorder: adolescent and 
parent experiences of treatment

40 
 
 
 Laura Maratchi, Berkshire Healthcare Foundation NHS Trust, UK; Mark Jeavons, University of Reading, UK  
Introduction: Qualitative studies of cognitive beha viour therapy with young people with anxiety disorders have shown that 
treatments are generally seen as acceptable, e.g., ‘challenging but helpful’ (e.g., Taylor et al., 2021). To date, there is 
limited evidence of the acceptability of treatment specifical ly for panic disorder in adolescents or for CBT delivered in brief 
formats. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of young people underdoing either brief cognitive 
therapy or a general form of CBT for panic disorder. Parental exp eriences were also explored with a particular focus on the 
acceptability of the two treatment protocols.   
Methods: Semi -structured qualitative interviews were conducted post -treatment with participants from both treatment 
groups within the Treatment of Pa nic Disorder in Adolescents (PANDA) Study (https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN14884288; 
for protocol see Waite, 2021). Thirteen adolescents and 14 parents were purposively sampled for a diverse range of 
demographic and clinical characteristics. interviews follo w predetermined topic guides and were carried out one -to-one by 
interviewers who had no other involvement in the study. Thematic analysis was used to identify and describe emergent 
themes within the interviews and strategies were employed to enhance the cr edibility and methodological rigour of the 
analysis.  
Results: Themes and subthemes were developed to understand both the experiences of the young people and their 
parents of treatment within the study. Findings will be presented in the symposium.  
Discussio n: The findings from this qualitative study will enable us to have a better understanding of the experience of 
young people and their parents of brief cognitive therapy and a general form of CBT for the treatment of adolescent panic 
disorder. Going forward , it will be crucial to ensure that brief treatments are not only effective, but that they also have high 
levels of acceptability prior to implementation in routine clinical services.

of Oxford , UK  
Introduction: Promising results have been achieved in a trial of an internet version of cognitive therapy for social anxiety in 
adolescents. In the OSCA trial, therapy was delivered by a highly specialist clinical psychologist. However, as most 
adolescents  with SAD are not seen in specialist clinics, this small pilot study aimed to learn about the practicalities of 
training practitioners in a low -intensity school support service (non -NHS, 3rd sector) to deliver OSCA. Equally important 
was testing the accept ability of the treatment to young people and their parents, when delivered in this way.  
Method: Five practitioners in a school support service offering fully remote assessment and treatment for common 
adolescent mental health conditions were trained to de liver OSCA. Five young people (aged 14 -18) received a 10 week 
programme of treatment. Weekly self -report questionnaire measures of social anxiety and mood were completed. Semi -
structured interviews took place at the end of treatment with young people, thei r parents and practitioners.  
Results: Findings will be presented to illustrate the acceptability of this method of delivery, based on the experience and 
perceptions of young people and their parents. Initial learning points about the training and supervis ion needs of 
practitioners will be discussed.  
Discussion: Although this is a small pilot study, there has been rich learning about the use of this online treatment in real  
world clinical settings. Results will be used to inform next steps to improve acces s to effective psychological treatments for 
socially anxious adolescents.

Introduction : Long COVID has been described as a post -COVID condition in which individuals experience persistent 
symptoms for a prolonged period after contracting the virus. Currently, little is known ab out its prevalence, 
symptomatology, duration and treatment. Studies have focused on children and young people up to 18, or adults, but no 
study has specifically focused on 18 –20-year -olds despite the pandemic adversely and disproportionately affecting the 
mental health of older adolescents. This study is part of the Children and Young People with Long COVID (CLoCk) study, a 
national matched cohort study of 30,000 children and young people aged 11 -17 in England (Stephenson et al 2021). It aims 
to describe po st-COVID symptomatology in a national sample of non -hospitalised 18 -20-year -olds with a PCR -confirmed 
SARS -CoV-2 infection compared to test -negative controls.  
Method : Approximately 1000 participants aged 18 -20 took part in the study, half of whom had teste d PCR -positive for 
SARS -CoV-2. These participants were matched with PCR -negative young people based on month of test, age, sex and 
region. Participants completed questionnaires about mental and physical health symptoms 3 - 16 months after a PCR test. 
Standa rdised mental health measures included GAD -7, PHQ -9, EQ -5D, Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire, UCLA -Loneliness and 
Warwick -Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale.  
Results : The mean duration of completion of the questionnaire was 7 months after a PCR test. Approximat ely 60% 
positives and 50% negatives had physical symptoms at the time of completing the questionnaire with the most frequently 
reported symptoms being tiredness, shortness of breath and headaches. Only the test positives reported continued loss of 
smell; t he test negatives had increased dizziness compared to the positives. Scores on standardised measures of mental 
health indicated no significant differences between test positives and negatives. Over half of all participants reported 
feeling anxious or depre ssed to some extent as indicated by a single item of the EQ -5D but scores on standardised mental 
health measures were largely comparable with the general population.  
Discussion : Reported physical symptoms were similar in the PCR - positive and negative grou ps and were also consistent 
with those reported by participants in the CLoCk study (Stephenson et al. 2022). The proportion of young people who 
reported feeling anxious or depressed was high. Treatment implications of the findings will be discussed.

“I am only half left” – a qualitative exploration of Long COVID pati ents’  existential loss and its impact on 
their identity and wellbeing

Long COVID (LC) can challenge patients’ wellbeing in a multitude of ways (e.g., physical, cognitive, emotional, social and 
financial) and thus can significantly disrupt their everyday lives. A growing body of literature has captured how living with 
LC may ‘spoil’ patients’ identity, shattering people’s capability and motivation to resume commitments that are central to 
their core  identity. Based on a large dataset of 80 interviews with LC patients collected from across the UK between 2021 -
22, we argue that the impact of LC may run deeper than simply losing one’s identity. Rather, the ongoing experiences of 
learning to cope with LC  are inextricably connected to a sense of loss at a more existential level. Our data has revealed that 
the multifaceted constraints and uncertainties around LC can threaten the integrity of patients’ taken -for-granted self and 
also give rise to painful rea lisations of their frailty, finitude and even mortality. These deeper pains may further shape the 
way that they plan and anticipate their future (e.g., career, family, health, death or life in general), forcing/enabling 
patients to fundamentally and contin uously review their selfhood. Despite this, the resilience and agency of our 
participants were also highlighted by our data, demonstrating the possibility of experiencing existential growth in their

42 
 
 
 identity and wellbeing in the face of distressing losses.  These conflicting pictures have illustrated the importance of better 
understanding and further supporting LC patients’ deeper (and often abstract) loss of identity, providing grounds to further 
improve holistic support for LC patients alongside their illn ess trajectories.  
 
A transdiagnostic approach to Long Covid: case study

Long Covid is characterised by multiple somatic symptoms including fatigue, breathlessness, headache, hypersomnia, 
palpitations, headaches, concentration difficulties, muscle weakness, dizziness amongst others1. NICE operationalises Long 
COVID as the prese nce of multiple symptoms at 3 months post infection. Prevalence rates vary depending on country, 
setting and sampling procedures. The recent UK CLOCK study found that over 30% of sero -positive cases reported 3 or 
more symptoms2. However, the pattern of sym ptoms was similar in sero -negative participants.  In a similar study in 
Denmark, participants with positive tests had more long -lasting symptoms and sick leave, whereas participants in the 
control group (those with a negative test) had more short -lasting s ymptoms and worse quality of life3. It may be the 
interaction of environmental stressors and post viral sequelae that produces symptoms idiosyncratically in different 
individuals. Transdiagnostic theory proposes that heterogeneous symptoms share similar un derlying physiological, 
emotional, cognitive and behavioural aetiological processes. Accordingly, the same treatment can be used across different 
presentations if targeted individually. A transdiagnostic case formulation was used to identify mechanisms wit h an 
individual with Long COVID. These included, booming and busting activity patterns, a dysregulated sleep pattern, symptom 
focusing and perfectionism. Improvement in quality of life and symptoms was reported at the end of treatment. Although 
spontaneous  recovery is possible improvement may be accelerated by early intervention.  Feasibility studies are required.

Outcomes from a pilot randomized controlled trial of a targeted online intervention to reduce the impact of 
cannabis use on psychosis risk.  
Thomas  Richardson , University of Southampton , UK; Matt  Sopp , University of Southampton , UK; Katherine  
Newman -Taylor , University of Southampton , UK; Thomas  Richardson , University of Southampton , UK  
Background: There is strong evidence that cannabis use increases the risk of psychosis, however this is especially the case 
for those who are already high risk, for ex ample with a history of sexual abuse. Previous research has shown that cognitive 
fusion and external attribution are possible mechanisms in the relationship between cannabis use and paranoia.  
Method: We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a novel  online intervention targeting cognitive fusion and external 
attribution in people with cannabis -related paranoia. In total, 80 participants were recruited via the research platform 
Prolific, randomised to the intervention or a wait list control, and compl eted measures of cannabis dependence, cognitive 
fusion, external attribution, paranoid cognitions and psychotic symptoms,.  
Results: Feasibility outcomes were strong; 85% of the intervention group completed the intervention, and quantitative and 
qualitative  feedback indicated that the intervention was acceptable and useful. Preliminary outcome data signalled 
increases in ‘readiness to change’ and cannabis dependence in the intervention group. There was also a non -significant

43 
 
 
 trend for reduced distress, which  became significant when only those high on prodromal symptoms were included. There 
was no indication of impact of intervention on cognitive fusion, external attribution or paranoid cognitions.  
Discussion: An online intervention targeting the psychologica l mechanisms likely to be driving cannabis -related psychosis is 
feasible and acceptable. The intervention may improve readiness to change and reduce distress. The combination of 
increased dependence readiness to change scores is likely to indicate improved  insight about the problematic nature of 
cannabis use, resulting improved motivation to change. A fully powered trial is now warranted, and extended to people 
with psychosis and at risk mental states in clinical settings.

Therapists experiences of applying EMDR with people experiencing psychosis  
Tess  Maguire , University of Southampton , UK; Rebecca  Phillips , Southern Health NHS Trust , UK  
Little is known of the usability of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) as an intervention for those 
experiencing psychosis. We will be presenting findings from a study which aimed to explore therapists’ experience of using 
EMDR with this population. A qualitative design was employed using an inductive approach and a thematic analys is. 
Twenty therapists, who had used EMDR with this client group, took part in a semi -structured interview to explore their 
experiences of the intervention. Key themes were generated from the data: (a) Familiarity with psychosis and EMDR, (b) 
Acceptability of EMDR, (c) The importance of systemic factors, and (d) Keeping key therapy principles in mind. Findings 
highlighted the importance of supervision to build therapist confidence, the value of the multidisciplinary team and the 
need for a shift in beliefs s urrounding the usefulness of EMDR to the wider system. We will also discuss recommendations 
for individuals and services arising from these findings.

Pathways fr om insecure attachment to paranoia: the mediating role of emotion regulation

Pathways from ins ecure attachment to paranoia: the mediating role of emotion regulation  
Introduction:  Paranoia is common across the clinical and non -clinical spectrum. Cognitive behavioural therapy for 
psychosis currently yields modest results, warranting research into sy mptom -specific maintenance factors to improve 
outcomes. There is strong evidence of a relationship between insecure attachment and increased paranoia, but little is 
known about the mediating mechanisms. Emotion dysregulation is associated with both insecur e attachment and 
paranoia, and a candidate causal mechanism. This study aimed to determine if emotion dysregulation mediates the 
association between attachment and paranoia.  
Method:  Sixty -two individuals with elevated paranoia were recruited from NHS serv ices and community settings across 
the South of England. Mediation analyses were conducted on trait attachment, emotion regulation and paranoia variables, 
which were collected at one time point.  
Results:  As predicted, emotion dysregulation mediated the re lationship between attachment avoidance and paranoia, and 
between attachment anxiety and paranoia. Emotion suppression did not mediate the relationship between attachment 
avoidance and paranoia, possibly due to power. Attachment avoidance correlated with d eactivating emotion regulation 
strategies (e.g. lack of emotional awareness) and attachment anxiety correlated with hyperactivating emotion regulation 
strategies (e.g. impulse control difficulties). Both deactivating and hyperactivating strategies correlat ed with paranoia.  
Discussion:  Emotion dysregulation is not routinely targeted in cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis. This study 
suggests that incorporating emotion regulation strategies in therapy may improve clinical outcomes. Experimental studies 
are now required to support a causal argument, and pilot intervention studies should investigate if emotion regulation 
skills development (aligned with attachment style) is effective in reducing non -clinical and clinical paranoia.

Introduction : There is currently limited research examining self -structure in clinical groups, including the extent to which 
self-structure is amendable to change following psychological therapy.  We address this important gap by examining self -
structure in individuals with a schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses with current persecutory delusions.  
Method : We used an established paradigm to measure self -structure - the card sort task, which measures key self -
structure indices, including the degree to which self -structure is compartmentalised (characterised by primarily positive or 
negative attributes, as opposed to a m ix of both), and the proportion and importance of negative attributes.                                                                                                                                         
We used a pilot RCT design in which individuals w ith a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis with current persecutory 
delusions (n=27) completed the card sort task before and after randomisation to either a 12 -week group mindfulness -
based therapy or treatment as usual control.                                                                                                                       Results  
Large effect sizes were found for reductions in self -structure indices, including compartmentalisation and proportion of 
negative attributes across self -aspects f ollowing group mindfulness therapy compared to treatment as usual.    
Discussion : The findings suggest that it might be possible to change self -structure in poeple with persecutory delusions 
following group mindfulness therapy.  These data support the central role of the self in theoretical models of paranoid 
thinking.  Limitations and clinical implications will be discussed.

Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for Depersonalization Derealization Disorder (DDD): A Self -Controlled 
Cross -Over Study of Wait List versus Active Treatment

Introduction: Depersonalisation -Derealisation Disorder (DDD) is a dissociative disorder which is characterised by a sense of 
unreality and detachment from the self and world. Although epidemiological studies of DDD consistently report a 
prevalence of around 1%, it is under -recognized and research on treatment is limited. An early published small -scale open 
study of CBT for DDD sh owed promising results(Hunter et al, 2005).  
Method: We report on a clinical audit of 36 participants with a diagnosis of chronic DDD who were sequentially recruited 
from a specialist UK National Health Service clinic in London. Three outcomes were assessed  (Cambridge Depersonalisation 
Scale [CDS], Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] and the Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI]) at three time points in a naturalistic, 
self-controlled, cross -over design. Hierarchical longitudinal analyses for outcome response clustered b y patient were 
performed using scores from baseline, beginning and end of therapy. The co -variables of age, ethnicity and gender were 
pre-specified.  
Results: Participants did not show a statistically significant change in CDS or BAI between baseline and s tart of treatment, 
however there were statistically significant reductions during the treatment period. The reduction in CDS scores in the 
waiting period was -4.250 (95%CI: -16.592 to 8.092) and after treatment was -35.986 (95%CI: -48.456 to -23.517). BAI 
scores showed a reduction of 0.033 (95% CI: -3.197 to 3.263) during the waiting period and -5.895 (95% CI: -19.126 to -
2.664) after treatment. Participants showed a statistically significant decrease in BDI scores during the waiting period but a 
larger red uction after treatment. The reduction in BDI scores was -4.000 (95% CI:  -7.737 to -0.264) in the waiting period 
and –7.813 (95% CI: -11.584 to -4.041). There were no differences in outcome scores between sex and age categories for 
any of the outcomes.

45 
 
 
 Discussion: CBT may be an effective treatment for DDD. However, treatment was not randomly assigned and clinical staff 
assessing outcomes were not blinded so bias could account for some of the results. The sample is small. More research is 
needed, including t he use of blinding and randomisation to assess the efficacy of CBT for DDD. Based on these findings, a 
feasibility RCT has recently been funded by the National Institute of Health Research to investigate if these effects can be 
replicated in routine NHS cl inical practice with generic CBT therapists trained in CBT for DDD.

Tinnitus is the sensation of sound without any external source. Sound intolerance can be divided into hyperacusis, 
misophonia and noise sensitivity. Hyperacusis is perception of certain everyday sounds, such as kitchen noises, bangs, 
music as too loud or p ainful. Misophonia is perception of certain sounds produced by human beings or animals, such as 
eating and breathing noises, as disgusting, offensive or annoying. On the other hand, noise sensitivity is a personality trai t 
involving underlying attitudes to wards noise in general. A person with high noise sensitivity may perceive noise caused by 
neighbours, nearby factories, workshops, and air conditioning as disruptive and distressing. In this presentation, we discuss  
our experience of audiologist -delivered Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in the UK as a part of a specialised 
rehabilitation programme for tinnitus and sound intolerance management.

From therapy to research: In support of CBT for misophonia  
Jane  Gregory , University of Oxford , UK; Anonymous (by request of author)  , Expert by experience   
There is pre liminary evidence that CBT can help improve the symptoms of misophonia, a decreased tolerance to everyday 
sounds like eating, breathing and repetitive environmental noises. Group CBT for misophonia was superior to waitlist in a 
randomized trial (Jager et a l., 2020) and case studies of individual CBT have shown promise (see for review, Potgieter et al., 
2019). However, we do not yet know the key maintaining factors for misophonia, making it difficult to develop and refine 
interventions.  
Observations from cli nical practice can provide proof of concept for interventions, support the development of theoretical 
models and help generate hypotheses to be tested experimentally. This presentation aims to describe a theoretical model 
of misophonia, by reporting on the mes that emerged from clinical practice, hypotheses developed from those themes, 
preliminary results from the research that followed, and a plan for future hypothesis testing.  
An Expert by Experience (anonymous by request) will share lessons learned from C BT for misophonia. She will talk about 
key themes of humour, relating, de -shaming, understanding and communication. She will reflect on the therapeutic 
relationship, the significance of shared understanding, and using this to break the cycle of shame and s ocial consequences 
in misophonia.  
These experiences will be contextualised into a theoretical cognitive model of misophonia. Preliminary results will be 
presented from the “Feared consequences” and “Behaviours” subscales of the S -Five psychometric scale fo r misophonia, 
examining predictors of symptoms of misophonia, anxiety and depression. Future research questions and plans will be 
discussed.

Autism and Sensory beyond DSM -5: A shared understanding between Clinicians and Autistic young 
people  with lived experience of sensory processing difference  
Sarah  Wilcock , Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust , UK 
Atypical responses to sensory stimul i as manifestations of ‘restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, or 
activities’ are recognised in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM -5] (5th Ed. APA 2013) within 
criterion for the diagnosis of Autism.  However, t his representation does not reflect the broader picture of sensory 
processing difficulties and the impact upon the young person’s occupational engagement, performance and participation.  
Without developing this shared understanding we as professionals will not be able to appreciate the alternative sensory 
reality that many Autistic young people experience, often at odds with and inconceivable to those supporting them.  
Use of self -report sensory profiles can offer up starting point on which  to invite the young person to share their lived 
experience and for the clinician to begin to build a fuller picture of the individuals sensory differences. For many young 
people and for those supporting them, education about sensory processing patterns an d thresholds can be a pivotal 
intervention and lead to a better understanding of ways in which to adapt the environment and interventions.  
Given the increased emphasis on sensory features in Autism Diagnosis, This presentation will reflect on current 
unde rstanding of the manifestation of sensory features (difficulty processing and integrating sensory information) and 
their relationship to core features of Autism, drawing from the perspectives of young people who are known to the 
Neurodevelopmental Team and  wider CAMHS Service and from recent research in the fields of neuroscience, Sensory 
Integration and developmental conditions.

Making Affirmative CBT Groups Work for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth: The Role of Facilitator Training  
Shelley  Craig , University of Toronto , Canada ; Austin  Ashley , Barry University , USA ; Iacono  Gio, University of 
Connecticut , USA  
Introduction : Empiric ally-supported interventions (ESIs) for marginalized populations can contribute to equitable mental 
health services. Their effectiveness is dependent on implementation fidelity, which hinges on the facilitator being trained 
to deliver the intervention comp etently. Yet, despite the risks encountered by sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY), 
and the proliferation of groups to meet their needs, few ESI’s address the training needs of group clinicians. As the first E SI 
designed for SGMY, AFFIRM is an affirmat ive cognitive -behavioral therapeutic (CBT) group intervention that has been 
found to improve coping and reduce depression (Craig et. al, 2021). To promote fidelity, an AFFIRM Facilitator Training was 
designed. The training, informed by experiential learnin g theory, is a two -day (14 -hour) intensive training that integrates 
didactic and experiential learning (e.g., role play, problem -based learning). This study evaluated the training, which aims to 
ensure effective delivery of AFFIRM in a range of settings.  
Method : Training participants (n=58) represented diverse sexual (33% gay, 29% lesbian, 21% bisexual, 13% pansexual, 4% 
heterosexual); gender (52% female, 40% male, 8% transgender, 4% gender non -conforming); ethnoracial (42% Caucasian, 
29% Asian, 19% Black,  5% Indigenous, 5% Latinx) and professional identities (e.g., community workers, case managers, 
social workers, psychologists).  The Affirmative CBT Facilitator Competence Scale (ACCS) (
  = 0.922), is a 7 -item scale 
designed to measure confidence to implem ent Affirmative CBT. Qualitative feedback was also collected.  
Results : There was a significant difference between pre (M=14.92, SD = 4.84) and the post training competence scores 
(M=20.58, SD = 4.02); t(57) = -9.206, p &lt; .001. Participants also noted that “I learned how to incorporate affirming 
LGBTQ+ identities with CBT” and “I feel more confident to utilize the group to meet youth needs”. Our results suggest that 
the training components had a significant impact on clinician competence.  
Discussion : As finding practitioners with the expertise to facilitate group -based ESIs  can be challenging, the importance of 
providing effective training to ensure groups are being delivered to underserved populations is of critical importance. The 
presentation will explore training considerations for groups drawn from AFFIRM.

The initial design and programme theory for a new work -focused psychothe rapeutic intervention to treat 
moderate -severe recurrent depression and enhance job retention.  
Nicola  Walker , University of Sheffield , UK ; Sally  Hall, Leeds City Council , UK 
Introduction: Many employees with moderate -severe recurrent depression struggle to maintain their employment. There 
are few work -focused psychotherapeutic interventions which are effective in both treating depression and enhancing job 
retention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to design a new treatment programme to help employed service -users of 
Community Mental Health Teams who are at  risk of losing their jobs.  
Method: This case study shows how we (i) designed the intervention using component analysis of existing literature and 
focus groups of frontline practitioners and former service users and mind -mapping analysis to establish its o perational 
logic; and (ii) evaluated the theory underpinning the intervention using realist synthesis and evaluation to establish its 
conceptual logic.  
Findings: An iterative hybrid approach of literature review, component analysis, focus group discussion,  and realist 
methods established the initial design and programme theory for the new intervention. The intervention focused on three 
areas of therapy, three inter -dependent outcomes, in a group format, with opportunities created for peer interaction. The 
main theoretical principles most likely to promote efficacy were to accelerate and optimise activation of one or more of six 
hypothesised mechanisms: realise, reflect, regulate, resolve, relate, and retain/resume in the context of skilfully facilitat ed 
grou p psychotherapy. The new intervention is called a work -focused relational Group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy 
(GCBT) treatment programme.  
Discussion: This study outlines a methodological approach based on the layered ontology of critical realist philosophy , 
applied to a successful example, which will be useful during the early stages of design and development of new group -
based psychotherapeutic interventions.  
By adopting the critical realist approach, we identified underlying mechanisms of  
change in relati onal group CBT. Whilst it is unlikely that all biases were eliminated because the sample was small and self -
selected, a major strength of this study is the participatory approach with a high degree of user involvement. The 
theoretically integrated approach  involving service -users and practitioners from different professional backgrounds was 
unique and meant that the treatment programme was multi -modal rather than informed by a single therapeutic or 
theoretical approach. The new intervention is also fully sp ecified and manualised.

Introduction : Depression affects many adults in the U K, often resulting in referral to primary care mental health services 
(e.g. IAPT). CBT is the main modality for depression within IAPT, with other approaches offered in a limited capacity. Arts 
psychotherapies are rarely provided despite their attractivene ss to clients. Therefore, in order to expand clients’ choice 
and following MRC framework (2006) for developing complex interventions, we developed a new creative psychological 
therapy integrating evidence -based approaches with arts psychotherapies called A rts for the Blues.  
Methods : Following systematic review of mechanisms of change in evidence - based therapies and arts psychotherapies for 
depression and pilot workshops in IAPT we identified eight key ingredients underpinning Arts for the Blues model. The  
model was tested in 12 sessions intervention with clients from MIND.  
Results : During the conference key ingredients of Arts for the Blues will be presented alongside results from IAPT 
workshops (n= 13) and MIND intervention (n=7). Workshops and intervent ions were evaluated using PHQ9, GAD7, WHO5 
and PANAS measures. Qualitative data from focus groups and interviews was also collected.  
Discussion : The evidence -based foundation, creative content and pluralistic nature of this new approach aligned with eight  
client -identified key ingredients for positive therapy outcomes make it a promising therapy option. Arts for the Blues 
received substantial funding from Edge Hill University, University of Salford, CCG and AHRC to develop this intervention 
further. Implic ations include consideration for NICE approval as an additional therapy for depression.

Randomised controlled trials pose a number of challenges for group -based therapies. As ‘complex’ interventions (Craig et 
al., 2008) one particular challenge arises in terms of how we set up and describe practice. This becomes even more 
complex,  when looking at group provision in the arts therapies. The ERA study is an NIHR funded, multicentre randomised 
controlled trial of group arts therapies compared to group counselling in community mental health care. Group arts 
therapies in this study are a rt therapy, music therapy and dance movement therapy. The ERA study has several unique 
design features including use of video to help patients give a preference for the type of art therapy they want, focus on 
group provision to people with a range of menta l health diagnoses, and arts -based workshops with therapists to develop a 
working manual and practice principles of group arts therapies for the trial.  This presentation will explore issues in the 
design and running of group therapy trials, using ERA as a n example. We will share some of the decisions and approaches 
taken in designing a randomised controlled trial including our arts -based methods of sharing practice across professions. 
Learning will be discussed in relation to current practice and research into group -based CBT interventions.

Introduction: Studies and theories on g roup dynamics and change processes in groups are dispersed across disciplines, and 
rarely explicitly used to design, deliver or evaluate group -based interventions often used to promote individual change in 
healthcare settings. The aims of the MAGI study we re to 1) develop a framework of change processes in group 
interventions, 2) test the framework by identifying examples of these processes and strategies used to facilitate them in 
selected groups, and 3) illustrate methods for exploring links between group  mechanisms and outcomes. The study 
focussed on behaviour change interventions for weight loss, but this presentation aims to stimulate discussion about the 
wider applicability of findings to group therapies.  
Methods: The mixed -methods study involved 1) a review of literature, including theories of group dynamics and change 
processes, taxonomies of change techniques, measures of group processes and qualitative studies on people’s experiences 
of weight loss groups; 2) consultations with, and fe edback from, researchers, group participants and facilitators; and 3) 
coding of intervention manuals and 38 transcripts of audio -recorded sessions from 3 group -based weight loss 
interventions. We also explored ways to integrate available group -level qualit ative and quantitative data.  
Results: The MAGI framework defined group processes and categorised them into 1) group intervention design features, 2) 
facilitation techniques, 3) group dynamic and development processes, 4) inter -personal change processes, 5)  intra -personal

49 
 
 
 change processes, and 4) contextual factors. We identified practical strategies for facilitating and managing these 
processes, categorised into 1) group design elements, 2) group set -up tasks, 3) group facilitation strategies, and 4) group 
closure tasks. Examples illustrated the content validity of the framework for weight loss groups. We showed how it could 
be used to generate and test hypotheses about links between group mechanisms and outcomes.  
Discussion: The MAGI framework provides a fi rst step towards understanding how groups work to influence individual 
change. It is a potentially generalisable practical tool for researchers and practitioners working with group interventions 
that can inform design and delivery, support facilitator trai ning and guide evaluation. Ongoing research is exploring its 
applicability to online group interventions, further work could extend this to group therapies for mental health.

Seeing the Connections Between Behaviours: Developing Tools to Facilitate Policy, Research and Practice in 
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy  
Vyv Huddy , University of Sheffield , UK; The TURBBO Project Group , University of Sheffield and Keele University , 
UK 
Introduction : Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) tends to focus on problematic behaviours in isolation; for example, sleep 
hygiene or physical activity. However, changing one behaviour can spill over to others, either positively (e.g. exercise lead s 
to more socialisin g) or negatively (e.g. exercise leads to greater consumption of unhealthy food). The TURBBO project is 
developing an open access knowledge base to visualise and facilitate understanding of the relationship between 
behaviours. We first developed a behaviour al ontology to provide a means of describing the entities used in the 
behavioural domain and the relationships between them.  
Methods : A co -design approach used workshops featuring interactive tools to generate the behavioural ontology. 
Participants were b ehavioural scientists and practitioners from varied fields who discussed the core concepts of behaviour 
and key questions for the knowledge base.  
Results : The project has generated an initial ‘upper and middle ontology’ describing (i) cross -domain charact eristics of 
behaviours and their associated concepts (e.g., measurement, context, temporality, and co -occurrence), and (ii) a 
structural hierarchy of behaviours (e.g., walking is a form of physical activity).  
Discussion : The ontology provides a structured knowledge base for behavioural practitioners and scientists to input data 
on the relationship between behaviours. They can then query the resource to answer questions about how behaviours are 
related.  
 
Encouraging results from an initial evaluation of CBT Bytesize - a novel multimodal digital intervention for 
anxiety

Background : Following feedback from CYP that they wanted support between weekly Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) 
sessions, we designed a novel intervention ‘CBT Bytesize’ (Burbach, Galloghly & Snaith, EABCT 2021) delivering CBT via 
text, video -conferencing, and th e use of a CBT -based app (‘ThinkNinja’).  
Methods : BABCP accredited therapists and wellbeing coaches supported CYP (aged 11 -17) within a multi -modal CBT 
programme for anxiety and related problems. Therapists initiated contact three times per week, and CYP received daily 
responses from coaches. N=28 CYP opted for CBT Bytesize when referred to Healios (a digital mental health care provider). 
86% were clinical at baseline on at least one routine outcome measure (ROM).  
Results : CYP engaged for M=12 weeks. N=16  (57%) completed treatment, N=3 (11%) remain active, and N=9 (32%) 
completed 1 -9 weeks. Of those with paired scores (N=26): 27% clinically improved, 65% reliably improved and 27% 
clinically & reliably improved on at least one ROM. Of completers (N=16), 44%  clinically improved, 88% reliably improved 
and 44% clinically & reliably improved on at least one ROM. Completers from tier 2 had better outcomes than tier 3. CYP 
enjoyed texting their therapist and accessing help in the moment. Constructive feedback was provided.

50 
 
 
 Conclusions : Emerging results and feedback from CYP about the current pilot study are encouraging and indicate that CBT 
Bytesize is an effective treatment for CYP with anxiety and related problems.  
 
What are the factors that help or hinder CBT trainees developing skills in Guided Discovery?  
Jason  Roscoe , University of Cumbria , UKElizabeth  Bates , University of Cumbria , UK 
Training as a CBT Therapist involves attending a Masters level course which is a blend of teaching, sup ervision and 
placement within a mental health service. Whilst most trainees are existing mental health professionals, the style of 
working is often new, in particular, the approach that is called Guided Discovery. This is an integral part of formulation an d 
treatment requiring trainees to refrain from advice giving, instead emphasising collaboration and Socratic Dialogue. This 
can be in stark contrast to the more didactic style that trainees are familiar with prior to embarking on their training. Lit tle 
is known at present about the experiences of CBT trainees when learning this new skill, specifically, how they assimilate 
this with existing ways of working and the challenges this might involve. This research is a preliminary attempt to 
understand factors th at help and hinder skill acquisition. Eighteen trainee CBT practitioners undertaking the final modiule 
of IAPT high intensity training completed an online questionnaire answering eight open ended questions that sought to 
understand their experience of lear ning skills in GD. In particular, the questions looked to determine factors that assisted in 
understanding GD and potential obstacles. A grounded theory approach was applied to the data with four key themes 
emerging. These themes were used to develop a pre liminary model of factors that enable or inhibit skills in GD. 
Implications of the findings for CBT trainers.  
 
Digital self -management intervention for people living with Long COVID  
Faith  Martin , Coventry University , UK; Hayley  Wright , Coventry University , UK; Andy  Turner , Coventry 
University , UK 
Introduction : Long COVID affects 1.3 million people in the UK. People describe uncertainty about how to mana ge it, with 
high levels of anxiety and depression. There is an urgent need support self -management with low intensity, scalable 
interventions.  
Method : We co -developed an 8 -week digital intervention. It includes behavioural techniques of pacing and cognitiv e 
techniques for managing unhelpful thoughts and rumination. It is delivered asynchronously through online text and videos, 
with trained facilitators and optional online meetings. Outcomes were the Warwick -Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale 
(WEMWBS) and Self -Efficacy to Self -Manage, pre and post course. WEMWBS scores correlate highly with common 
depression and anxiety measures. Open ended questions asked participants to comment on their experiences.  
Results : Data were from 28 people who completed the interve ntion and measures. Mostly female (83%), White British 
(91%) and employed (78%). WEMWBS and self -efficacy scores significantly increased. Participants talked about the flexible 
nature of the intervention being easy to use around their symptoms and lives, a nd found the structured approach of 
different topics per session helpful.  
Discussion : The change in outcomes provides initial support for the intervention. Qualitative data describe the major 
advantage of our delivery mode for a population living with a fluctuating and fatiguing condition. We are now conducting 
evaluations against a control group and over 6 months.

Co-production of SCED - the tensions and the potential.  
Stephen  Kellett , University of Sheffield and Rotherham Doncaster and South Humber NHS Foundation Trust, UK  
and Lisa Alhadeff, Expert by experience  
Introduction: Whilst the individual patient and their outcomes are at the heart of SCED, the patient tends to be used as a 
'data collector' rather than a 'co -evaluator' of change.   The aim of the presentation is to explain and demonstrate the 
potential for co -production in SCED in the evaluation of outcome for a patient with bi -polar disorder.   
Methods: An A1/B/A2/C with extended follow -up S CED with a female patient meeting diagnostic criteria for bipolar 
disorder.  Following the 6 -week baseline period ‘A1’, treatment occurred in two phases (18 ‘B’ and 6 sessions ‘C’) 
sandwiching a 12 -week treatment withdrawal phase (‘A2’) and a 24 -week struc tured follow -up phase. Five idiographic daily 
measures were collected daily to create a 622 -day timeline. The PHQ -9 and the Mania Rating Scale were completed after 
each treatment session. The participant held two roles: as the patient and provider of the i diographic/nomothetic 
outcomes and also as part of the research team through providing a commentary on the outcomes identified.

51 
 
 
 Results: A partially effective intervention. There were improvements to idiographic measures of self -criticism, self -
acceptance,  body dissatisfaction and worry. Nomothetic outcomes showed little change. The intervention did not insulate 
from the occurrence of a hypermanic relapse during the follow -up phase. The change commentary mirrored the 
idiographic outcomes in noting that the ‘active change’ was harder to implement during the manic relapse.  
Discussion: Methodologically, it is possible to improve SCED methodology through widening the participant role further 
beyond that of data collection.  The talk will conclude with highlighti ng these co -production methods.

So far, most of the traditional literature has relied on the use of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to test the efficacy of 
psychological interventions. Even though RCTs  provide valuable information, they also show some disadvantages, such as 
the requirement of large samples or the presence of control or waiting list conditions. These issues can be particularly 
important when dealing with a novel intervention whose effica cy is still not known. In this sense, single case experimental 
designs (SCEDs) are an adequate methodological alternative to RCTs, allowing to explore the feasibility and preliminary 
efficacy of a new intervention with a small number of participants and wi thout the need for a control condition. In this 
presentation, we will provide examples of SCEDs applied to the specific field of virtual reality and, more specifically, to 
explore the effects of novel virtual -reality based interventions addressing autobiog raphical memory impairments and 
behavioural activation in depression. We will discuss the advantages of integrating SCEDs with virtual -reality treatments, as 
well as the methodological issues observed throughout the studies.

A novel me thod to manipulate penis length to measure female sexual satisfaction: a single -case

Objectives: To investigate a novel methodology and explore whether artificially reducing the depth of penetration during 
intercourse matters to women. In this presentation, we will highlight the methodology that was used in a Single Case 
Experiential Desig n.   
Methods:  A study with a single -case experimental design (‘n of 1’), in which a heterosexual couple act as their own control 
and the study is then replicated in subsequent couples, was conducted. Thirty -five couples were assessed for eligibility to 
participate. Twenty -nine couples without any sexual problems were randomized and 12 submitted sufficient data to 
analyse. As a proxy for reducing penis length, we artificially reduced the depth of penetration by using different sizes of 
silicone rings around  the base of the man’s erect penis. The main outcome measures were provided by the female partner 
on a scale of 0 –100 and comprised: degree of (i) overall sexual pleasure; (ii) sexual pleasure from intercourse alone; and 
(iii) emotional connection to the m ale partner. The female partner was also asked before the experiment began to rate the 
degree of positive or negative change that would be personally meaningful for her.  
Results: On average, reducing the depth of penetration led to a statistically signific ant 18% reduction of overall sexual 
pleasure with an average 15% reduction in length of the penis. The longer the erect penis, the less likely the rings were to 
have an impact on sexual pleasure. There was a range of individual responses, however, with a m inority of women 
reporting that reducing the depth of penetration was more pleasurable on some occasions.  
Discussion: Size may matter in women in a healthy stable relationship when there is penile shortening. Because of the 
small number of couples and the inclusion of men with an apparently long penis, our results are preliminary, and we 
welcome replication in a larger sample with a more diverse range of penile lengths. Our results should not be 
misinterpreted as meaning that increasing penile length will i ncrease sexual pleasure in women.

Where we might be able to go with single case experimental designs and how we might be able to get there.  
Gary  Brown , Royal Holloway University of London , UK  
Single case experimental designs were traditionally the lynchpin of the scientist practitioner approach. Following a period 
in which randomized controlled trials have held sway, SCEDs are enjoying a resurgence. Unlike RCTs, SCEDs are accessible 
to the clinician working in routine practice and so are a potential route to promoting practi ce based evidence. Aside from 
practitioners gaining the knowledge required to carry out SCEDs, various gate -keeping steps need to be negotiated, 
including ethics, confidentiality, and data protection. This presentation will provide an overview of these iss ues, offer 
potential solutions, and sketch out a future scenario in which the potential for routine clinical research is optimized.

The CODES pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial evaluating CBT for adults with dissociative 
seizures; planned evaluation of clinical outcomes and exploratory secondary analysis  
Laura  Goldstein , King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London, UK ; The 
CODES Study Team , UK 
Introduction: Dissociative seizures (DSs) are a common functional neurological disorder. We report a large multi -centre RCT 
testing the effectiveness of DS -specific CBT in adults with DSs.  
Method: 368 adults with  DSs were randomised to receive DS -specific CBT plus standardised medical care (CBT+SMC; 
n=186) vs SMC -alone (n=182). Our primary outcome was monthly DS frequency 12 -months post -randomisation; secondary 
outcomes were also evaluated at 12 months. Unplanned secondary analyses considered outcomes 6 months post -
randomisation, near the end of CBT.  
Results: At 12 months post -randomisation monthly DS frequency did not differ between arms but 9/16 secondary 
outcomes were better in the CBT+SMC arm (p&lt;0.05), of w hich 5 were better at p≤0.001 e.g., less impairment (Work & 
Social Adjustment Scale) and more DS -free days in the last 6 months (Goldstein et al, 2020 doi.org/10.1016/S2215 -
0366(20)30128 -0). Secondary analysis (Goldstein et al, 2022) found that 13/14 outco mes measured at 6 - and 12 -months 
post -randomisation were better in the CBT+SMC arm at 6 months (p&lt;0.05, including monthly DSs).  
Discussion: Our 12 -month evaluation showed no between -arms difference in DS frequency but benefits in psychosocial and 
DS-related outcomes. Secondary analysis indicated wider benefits including for DS frequency. Treatment evaluation close 
to treatment end is informative but longer -term evaluation better explains the pattern of treatment effects in DSs.

Dissociative Seizures (DS) or non epileptic attacks are otherwise known as functional neurological disorders, associated 
with a significant reduction in physical activity and impaired social functioning. We developed a cognitive behavioural 
model of DS which assumes that an initial physiological trigger begins a vicious cycle in which cognitive, attributional, 
physiological, affective and social factors fuel avoidant behaviour. Treatment techniques include a combination of DS 
specific techniques devised to interrupt the seizures and some transdiagnostic cognitive and behavioural s trategies are 
used to suit the needs of individual patients. In brief patients are encouraged to utilise techniques that help them to 
control seizures and engage in avoided activities over 12 sessions. We published a case report, pilot study and randomised  
controlled trial to evaluate the approach. Patients reported a significant reduction in DS frequency and an improvement in 
psycho -social functioning. This presentation will describe the approach and a case study will be used to illustrate the

 Chronic muscle disorders (MD) such as muscular dystrophy cannot be cured. We randomised pe ople with MD who were 
distressed to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) plus usual medical care (UMC) or UMC alone. This two -arm, 
randomised, multicentre, parallel design recruited 155 patients with MD. 138 people completed the 9 week study. 
Participan ts receiving ACT were supported by a therapist in using 4 skills to help them manage the challenges of daily life 
more flexibly. These were mindfulness, ways of stepping back from thoughts and taking an observer perspective, help in 
identifying what was im portant to them and encouragement in living life according to what was personally meaningful. At 
9 weeks post randomisation, the participants receiving ACT demonstrated a marked improvement in their quality of life, 
including their independence, social and  emotional functioning and body image. They also noted improvements in their 
overall mood, a secondary but nonetheless important measure of wellbeing.significant with moderate to large effect sizes. 
ACT in addition to usual care was effective in improving QoL and other psychological and social outcomes in patients with 
Muscle Disease. A six month follow up has shown that benefits persist.   
 
Moderators of cognitive behavioural therapy treatment effects and predictors of outcome in the CODES 
randomised controlled trial for adults with dissociative seizures  
Emily  Robinson , King's College London , UK; The CODES Study Team , UK 
Introduction : We explored moderators of CBT treatment effects and predictors of outcome in the CODES trial (n=368) 
comparing cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) plus standardised me dical care (SMC) vs SMC -alone for dissociative seizures 
(DS).  
Methods : Outcomes were at 12 months post randomisation: monthly DS frequency, psychosocial functioning (Work and 
Social Adjustment Scale, WSAS), and health -related quality of life (both the mental and physical component summary 
scores, SF -12v2 MCS/PCS). Moderation analyses of baseline characteristics determined who benefited from being offered 
CBT; and if effects were absent we tested whether baseline variables predicted change, irrespective of treatment 
allocation.  
Results : We found CBT reduced DS frequency for participants with more (≥22) symptoms or ≥1 current comorbid 
psychiatric diagnosis (p&lt;0.05); and the effect of CBT on PCS scores was moderated by gender, where women did better 
than  men in the CBT+SMC group. Predictors of improved outcome included: not receiving disability benefits, lower 
anxiety/depression scores (PCS, MCS, WSAS); shorter duration, younger age at DS onset, employment, fewer symptoms 
and higher educational qualificat ion (PCS, WSAS); stronger belief in the diagnosis and in CBT as a “logical” treatment (MCS).  
Discussion : Patient complexity interacted with treatment. CBT was more likely to reduce DS frequency in those with 
greater comorbidity. Other patient characterist ics predict outcome regardless of intervention.

Christabel  Owens , University of Exeter , UK 
Background: Augmented Depression Therapy (ADepT) aims to concurrently build wellbeing and reduce depression using a 
solution -focused, values -based, and cognitively augmented behavioural acti vation approach. A pilot RCT has recently 
compared ADepT to CBT in the treatment of depression, randomising 41 adult participants to each arm. This qualitative 
interview study explored experiences of undergoing ADepT treatment in a subset of those in the A DepT arm of the trial.   
Method: Eighteen participants who received ADepT attended semi -structured interviews after the end of treatment using 
purposive sampling. The qualitative data was analysed using the Framework method and implementing an integrative 
deductive and inductive approach.  
Results: Overall, participants were satisfied with ADepT and talked about undergoing a positive transformation through 
treatment. Participants reported learning to act opposite to deprossogenic patterns to help them maxim ise opportunities 
and minimise challenges in life, a process that continued beyond the end of treatment. Participants found the concurrent 
focusing on reducing depression and enhancing wellbeing acceptable. Key perceived helpful elements of change included  
enabling the positives, becoming more proactive, gaining confidence and motivation, discovering themselves beyond 
depression, cultivating self -compassion, and living a values consistent life. Although the therapy was perceived as 
challenging, most partici pants appreciated the need to work hard to experience benefits.

54 
 
 
 Conclusion: Addressing wellbeing and depression concurrently in ADepT is perceived by clients as a feasible, acceptable, 
and effective approach in recovering from depression.

Preliminary evaluation of a training pathway for Augm ented Depression Therapy for high intensity 
therapists in IAPT settings  
Laura  Warbrick , University of Exeter , UK; Kalliopi  Demetriou , University of Edinburgh , UK; Barney  Dunn , 
University of Exeter , UK  
Background: Augmented Depression Therapy (ADep T) has been provisionally shown to be an effective treatment for 
depression in a recent pilot randomised controlled trial. Before proceeding to definitive trial evaluation of ADepT, it is 
important to establish if a larger workforce in routine care setting s can be trained to competently deliver ADepT and to 
canvas their views on the approach.  
Method: A cohort of eleven IAPT experienced CBT high intensity therapists underwent a six -month training in ADepT, 
consisting of a one -day initial workshop, weekly tw o-hour skills practice sessions for a month, treating at least two cases 
while receiving weekly small group supervision for a six -month period, and tape feedback at the end of training.  
Results: The proportion of therapists completing the training and who  were judged to reach competence criteria will be 
reported, as will clinical outcomes in the cases they treated. Therapist’s views on training they received and the 
acceptability, feasibility and fit of the ADepT approach in IAPT (captured via a feedback s urvey at the end of the training) 
will also be discussed.  
Discussion: Implications for the feasibility of implementing ADepT in a larger scale trial will be discussed, as will learnin g 
about how to optimise the training of therapists in a new treatment mo dality.  
  
A case series evaluation of Augmented Depression Therapy (ADepT) for treatment of depression in young 
adults  
James  Carson , University of Exeter , UK; James  Carson , University of Exeter , UK; Kalliopi  Demetriou , University of 
Edinburgh , UK; Barney  Dunn , University of Exeter , UK  
Introduction: There is increasing recognition of the importance of targeting depression in young adults when it first 
presents, to try and minimise the chances o f a chronic, relapsing future course. Augmented Depression Therapy (ADepT) 
has previously been shown to be effective in treating depression across the adult life span. The current study preliminarily 
examines if ADepT may be beneficial for treating depress ion in the 18 -24 year age range specifically.  
Method: A mixed methods multiple randomised baseline case series designed was used, recruiting eleven clinically 
depressed young adults from a university wellbeing service. Many of the sample also presented wit h anxiety, features of 
emotional and interpersonal dysregulation linked to previous complex trauma, and neuroatypical features. Participants 
completed weekly measures of wellbeing and depression during the baseline and treatment phase and a longer battery of 
outcomes measures at intake, pre -treatment, post -treatment and two -month follow -up. Participants also underwent a 
qualitative interview to explore their experiences of ADepT.   
Results: Clinical outcomes will be examined at the within -participant and gr oup level. Acceptability and feasibility data will 
be presented, alongside a thematic analysis of qualitative interviews conducted with participants after completing 
treatment.  
Discussion: Implications of this work for further refinement evaluation of ADe pT in young adults will be discussed.  
 
“But doesn’t that lead to hypomania?”: A multiple baseline case series of Behavioural Activation for bipolar 
depression.  
Kim Wright , University of Exeter , UK; Barney  Dunn , University of Exeter , UK; Megan  Colletta , University of 
Exeter , UK; Heather  O'Mahen , University of Exeter , UK  
Background: Behavioural Activation (BA) is an established psychological interve ntion for unipolar depression, and has the 
advantage of being relatively simple to train and deliver. Despite this, few studies have evaluated BA as a treatment for 
acute bipolar depression. In this study we sought to establish the feasibility and acceptab ility of the therapy and research 
procedures, as well as the potential for an adapted BA protocol (BA -B) to represent a safe and effective treatment option 
for this patient group. A secondary aim was to explore relationships between depression and hypomani a symptoms, 
distress and engagement in valued activity within participants across the course of therapy.  
Method: Within a two -wave, randomised -multiple -baseline, ABA case -series design we offered BA -B to adults experiencing 
a current episode of depression within bipolar I or II disorder. Outcome and process measures were administered at the 
start and end of the baseline period and post treatment completion. Weekly symptom measures were completed across 
the baseline and therapy periods and for three weeks po st treatment. Quantitative and qualitative feedback from 
participants was gathered post treatment.

55 
 
 
 Results: Acceptability and feasibility data will be presented, as will analyses of reliable change within the sample. The 
findings from multilevel models exa mining relationships across time between depression, hypomania, distress and valued 
activity will be described.  
Discussion: The talk will consider the implications of this work for further evaluation of BA -B, as well as clinical learning.  
 
Expanding and  supporting choice in IAPT: Outcomes from a patient preference trial of guided self - 
help for  anxiety disorders  
Chair: Stephen Kellett, University of Sheffield, and Rotherham Doncaster and South Humber NHS Foundation 
Trust, UK  
 
What is a patient preference trial? How did we support choice of intervention, how did we support PWPs 
and how did we gather the outcomes?  
Charlotte  Bee, Pennine Care NHS , UK; Stephen  Kellett , University of Sheffield , UK; Jessica  Smithies , Pennine Care 
NHS , UK; Vikki  Aadahl , Pennine Care NHS , UK; Mel Simmonds -Buckley , University of Sheffield , UK  
Introduction : There is both a moral reason f or supporting patient choice and there is a convincing evidence base that 
shows that when patient preferences are supported, this improves indices of service engagement and clinical outcome.  
The IAPT manual advises therefore offering a choice of treatment  to patients accessing any step of the service.  Clinical 
trials however reduce choice by taking the treatment decision out of the participant’s hands and using technology to 
randomly assign people to the arms of a trial.  This risks people not engaging be cause of lack of choice and dropping out 
when they do not receive the treatment that they want.  Outcomes may therefore more strongly reflect preference than 
intervention.  The methodological solution to this issue is to complete patient preference randomi sed controlled trials.  All 
treatments at step 2 of IAPT are currently low intensity cognitive -behavioural guided self -help (CBT -GSH) and so a 
manualized guided self -help (GSH) version of cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) has been developed and piloted (CAT -GSH). 
We aim to describe the methods of a four -arm patient preference randomised clinical trial (arm 1 randomised to CAT -GSH, 
arm 2 preference for CAT -GSH, arm 3 randomised to CBT -GSH and arm 4 preference for CBT -GSH).  
Method : Participants meet diagnostic  criteria for any anxiety disorder (defined by the MINI and the Beck Anxiety Inventory 
(BAI)) and are deemed suitable for a step 2 intervention (i.e. GSH delivered by a psychological wellbeing practitioner; PWP).  
Participants are presented with standardise d treatment information and indicate a preference of CAT -GSH, CBT -GSH or 
randomization to either CBT -GSH or CAT -GSH.  One session per treatment has been sampled and PWP competency 
assessed. The primary outcome measure is the BAI and secondary outcomes incl ude uptake, attendance and dropout rates 
and contrasting sessional outcomes on the IAPT minimum dataset (PHQ -9 and GAD -7).  Follow -up occurs at 8 and 24 
weeks.  
Results : The presentation will report via a CONSORT diagram the recruitment, preference, retenti on and follow -up rates 
and will report on the manner past engagement with the service influences current treatment preferences when the 
patient returns to the service.  
Discussion  
That expanding patient choice is possible and that patients at step 2 clearly  want to exert a choice over their treatment 
options.  The pros and cons of conducting a pragmatic trial at step 2 of a busy IAPT service will be discussed  
 
Assessing how the therapies were delivered: the relationship between PWP competence and patient 
outcome  
Niall  Power , The University of Sheffield, UK  
Introduction: There is scarce research on the relationship between practitioner competence in low intensity psychological 
interventions and treatment outcome. Therefore, this study investigated the association between practitioner competence 
in delivering guided self -help (GSH) and clinical outcome, rate of clinical change, need for f urther intervention, attendance 
and drop out.  
Method: Data from a randomised controlled patient preference trial of GSH for anxiety disorders in an Improving Access to 
Psychological Therapies service were used. The trial compared GSH based on cognitive ana lytic therapy (CAT -GSH) with 
standard GSH based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT -GSH). Sessions were randomly sampled from the 6 -8 session 
manualised treatments (CAT -GSH, n=60 and CBT -GSH, n=20) and rated using a validated competence rating tool. A ‘ful ly 
crossed’ independent rating design was used with two independent rating groups. Competence ratings were then used to 
explore associations with anxiety, depression and functioning, treatment engagement (attendance and drop -out), and 
need for further inte rvention.  
Results: Competence ratings had very high inter -rater reliability across all competence levels and in both treatments 
(intraclass correlation coefficients between 0.85 and 0.99). No significant associations were found between competence 
and clini cal outcome, treatment engagement or need for further intervention. Competence did not predict rate of change 
in anxiety symptoms.

56 
 
 
 Discussion: Practitioners were competent in the delivery of either version of GSH, but competency did not predict clinical 
or service outcomes. Analyses were under -powered and exploratory and directions for future LI competency -outcome 
research are provided.  
 
The acceptability of cognitive analytic guided self -help in an Improving Access to Psychological Thera pies 
service

UK; Mel Simmo nds-Buckley , University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK ; Colleen  McElhatton , University of Sheffield, 
Sheffield, UK  
Background: An Improving Access t o Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service in England has implemented cognitive analytic 
therapy guided self -help (CAT -GSH) alongside cognitive behavioural guided self -help (CBT -GSH) in order to support 
enhanced patient choice. This study sought to explore t he acceptability to psychological wellbeing practitioners (PWPs) of 
delivering CAT -GSH.  
Method: This study used a qualitative design with semi -structured interviews and associated thematic analysis (TA). A 
sample of n=12 PWPs experienced in delivering CAT -GSH were interviewed.  
Results: Five over -arching themes (containing 12 subthemes) were identified and conceptually mapped: (a) the past -
present focus (made up of working with clients’ pasts and the different type of change work), (b) expanding the treatmen t 
offer (from the perspective of PWPs and clients), (c) the time and resources required to effectively deliver CAT -GSH (to 
enable safe and effective delivery for clients and personal/professional development for PWPs), (d) understanding CAT -
GSH (made up of  confidence, learning new therapeutic language/concepts and appreciating the difference with CBT -GSH) 
and (e) joint exploration (made up of therapeutic/supervisory relationships and enhanced collaboration).  
Conclusion: CAT -GSH appears an acceptable (but ch allenging) approach for PWPs to deliver in IAPT services. Services 
should prioritise training and supervision for PWPs to ensure good governance of delivery.

The UK Government’s implementation in 2008 of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) in England 
systematised the delivery of guided self -help for mild -to-moderate depression and anxiety in primary care. Whilst guided 
self-help for anxiety is the most common IAPT intervention, there have been limited evaluations of its efficacy within IAPT 
based on clinical trials. This study sought to compare the efficacy of two types of guided self -help in the treatment of mild -
to-moderate anxiety within an IAPT service. A pragmatic, partially randomised, patient preference trial (PRPPT) was 
completed in the Pennine Care IAPT service in England and recruited participants aged  18 years or older with mild -to-
moderate anxiety. Eligible participants that stated a treatment preference were allocated to or were randomly assigned 
(1:1) to receive either 6 -8 (35 minute) sessions of cognitive -behavioural guided self -help (CBT -GSH) or c ognitive -analytic 
guided self -help (CAT -GSH). Trial outcomes will be presented based on anxiety severity (measured by the Beck Anxiety 
Inventory (BAI)) at 8 and 24 -week post -treatment as the primary outcome, with the IAPT minimum dataset measures and 
servi ce utilisation being secondary outcomes.  
 
Comparing idiographic change in cognitive analytic and cognitive behavioural guided self -help  
Emma Headley , University of Sheffield, UK; Stephen Kellett, University of Sheffield, and Rotherham Doncaster 
and South Humber NHS Foundation Trust, UK  
Introduction : Understanding the context in which therapy is effective is crucial for effective clinical delivery. What makes 
therapy successful has been widely considered. Many b elieve different psychological therapies are equivalent in their 
effectiveness due to shared common factors such as therapeutic alliance. Others believe that specific scientific ingredients 
of different psychotherapies create change. Literature examining c hange processes in guided self -help (GSH) interventions 
emphasise the importance of client related factors in the process of change. This study sought to identify types of

57 
 
 
 idiographic change and explore possible mechanisms of change through two forms of GS H; cognitive behavioural therapy 
guided self -help (CBT -GSH) and cognitive analytic therapy guided self -help (CAT -GSH).  
Method : Seventeen individuals recruited from a wider clinical trial (Kellett et al., 2021) demonstrating reliable change after 
completin g two different types of GSH for anxiety, participated in semi -structured interviews. An adapted Client Change 
Interview (Elliott, 2011) schedule was used. Changes were categorised and non -parametric analysis examined differences 
between the two groups. In ductive thematic analysis (Boyatzis, 1999) was used to extract themes.  
Results : No differences were found between groups in types of reported change. Both experienced cognitive, behavioural, 
emotional and relational change. Five overarching themes were fo und; ‘Personal qualities of success’; ‘Enlightenment 
through understanding’; ‘Specific tools and techniques’; ‘Relationships’; ‘Tailoring support’. Four themes maximally 
differentiated between the two treatment groups.  
Discussion : A combination of model s pecific and common factors contributed to the process of change. Tailoring 
intervention structure to the needs of the client, connecting to the therapist and being committed to the change process 
were important for both groups. CAT -GSH completers uniquely reported the importance of understanding the origins of 
their anxiety. They noted new relational insight and relational change, and transformation of the self -self relationship. CBT -
GSH completers uniquely reported the importance of understanding what anxi ety was. They described the importance of 
learning new techniques to cope and having supportive relationships. The findings suggest that change mechanisms in 
these two forms of GSH are a collaborative integration of both model specific and common factors.

Introduction: There has been limited investiga tion of therapies targeting trauma -related psychological mechanisms 
hypothesised to play a role in post -traumatic and psychosis symptoms. Imagery rescripting (ImRs) is a therapeutic 
technique which involves transforming images, such as episodic memories, t o modify associated distressing beliefs. This 
study is the first ImRs study for psychosis to incorporate experimental controls. We used a novel ImRs protocol, targeting 
present -focused, self -referential distressing meanings associated with intrusive trauma  memories. A multiple baseline case 
series design investigated whether the protocol was feasible, safe, acceptable and effective.  
Methods: 12 participants with a psychosis diagnosis and intrusive trauma memories were assessed and randomised to a 
monitorin g period (one, two or three weeks), followed by three ImRs sessions (over three weeks), a further two -week 
monitoring period with a post -therapy assessment a week after completing therapy. Memory phenomenology was 
assessed daily during monitoring. Post -traumatic stress symptoms and wellbeing were assessed pre and post therapy.  
Results: ImRs was feasible, safe and rated as highly acceptable. No participants dropped -out of the brief, targeted 
intervention. There were moderate effects on the frequency, distres s, controllability and appraisals of trauma memories. 
Notably, ten participants showed reliable change, and seven clinically significant change, in post -traumatic stress 
symptoms.  
Conclusions: The study indicates that a brief, novel ImRs protocol targeting present -focused, self -referential meanings is a 
promising intervention for intrusive trauma memories. Future research should investigate its integration into trauma -
focused therapy for psychosis and impact on psychosis severity.

Introduction: Traumatic events are involved in the development and maintenance of psychotic symptoms. There are few 
trials exploring trauma -focused treatments as interventions f or psychotic symptoms, especially in individuals with early 
psychosis. This trial evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a definitive trial of Eye Movement 
Desensitization and Reprocessing for psychosis (EMDRp) in people with early psych osis.  
Methods: 60 service users with a history of a traumatic/ adverse life events were recruited from Early Intervention 
(EI)services in the North West of England and randomized to receive 16 sessions of EMDRp + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or 
TAU alone. Par ticipants were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months post -randomization using several measures of 
psychotic symptoms, trauma symptoms, anxiety, depression, functioning, service -user defined recovery. Two nested 
qualitative studies to assess participant fee dback of therapy and views of professional stakeholders on the implementation 
of EMDRp into services were also conducted.  
Results: We examined several feasibility outcomes, including ability to recruit and randomize participants, trial retention a t  
follo w-up assessments, treatment engagement and ability to deliver EMDRp with a high level of fidelity in EI settings . 
Despite the impact that the COVID -19 pandemic had on the trial, leading to several adaptations to our recruitment, 
assessment, and treatment delivery procedures, all quantitative data pertaining to these feasibility outcomes confirmed 
the overall viability of this line of research. Analysis of quantitative outcomes also suggested promise of efficacy of EMDRp  
against TAU on several clinically me aningful outcome. The qualitative data suggested that the experience of receiving 
EMDRp was overall positive and associated with personally -valued gains, but sometimes understandably challenging for 
participants with complex trauma histories.  Service user s and clinicians made several recommendations to better prepare 
clients for trauma -focused work in EI settings, with implications beyond EMDRp and applicable to the delivery of CBT 
trauma -focused protocols.   
Discussion: Our findings are promising and sugg est that further larger scale research is warranted to evaluate whether 
EMDRp represents a beneficial treatment to augment existing evidence -based care of individuals with early psychosis 
supported by EI services.  
 
The bumpy road of trauma -focused treatment: PTSD symptom exacerbation in people with psychosis

Introduction: Concern for symptom exacerbation and treatment drop -out is an important barrier to implementation o f 
trauma -focused treatment, especially in people with psychosis diagnoses.  
Objective: We investigated PTSD symptom exacerbation during eye movement desensitization reprocessing (EMDR) 
therapy and prolonged exposure (PE) in a sample of 99 participants with PTSD and psychosis. We also tested whether 
exacerbation predicted drop -out or poor treatment response.   
Method: This study was part of a multicenter randomized controlled trial. PTSD symptoms were monitored at each session. 
Exacerbation was defined in two ways: (1) symptom increase in comparison to the first rating anywhere in t he first four 
sessions (early exacerbation) and (2) in comparison to the previous rating throughout the entire therapy (between -session 
exacerbation).  
Results: Both early exacerbation and between -session exacerbation were relatively common (32.3% and 46.5 % 
respectively), but were not related to either drop -out or poor treatment response.  
Discussion: It is important for both clinicians and patients to know that symptom exacerbation during trauma -focused 
treatment is common and not related to poor outcome. S ymptom exacerbation can be part of the therapeutic process, 
should be acknowledged and guided, and should not be a barrier to the implementation of trauma -focused therapy in 
people with psychosis.

Introduction: Many people with first episode psychosis have experienced significan t trauma in their lives, and support with 
the consequences of trauma often forms part of their treatment plan under Early Intervention for Psychosis services. This 
talk will describe a qualitative study which explored the experience of therapists of implem enting trauma -focussed 
therapies in Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) teams.

59 
 
 
 Methods: 6 clinical psychologists working in NHS EIP services in London, UK, completed a semi -structured interview about 
their experiences of assessing trauma, how trauma -focu ssed therapy is offered and delivering trauma -focused therapy. The 
interviews were transcribed and a critical realist approach adopted for thematic analysis.  
Results: Three superordinate themes were identified during analysis. These were: 1) Breaking the s ilence, 2) Dilemmas in 
trauma -focussed therapy and 3) Need for support. The themes will be discussed to highlight barriers and facilitators of 
implementation.  
Discussion: The findings of this study support the need for therapists to implement trauma -focus ed therapy within EIP. 
Recommendations for addressing implementation barriers will be discussed.  
 
Awareness and interpretation of bodily states, intolerance of uncertainty, and anxiety

Fear of bodily sensations in health anxiety: The interplay between intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety 
sensitivity

Introduction: Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and Anxiety Sensitivity (AS) are transdiagnostic vulnerability factors involved  in 
anxiet y-based disorders and share a basis in the fear of the unknown. According to CBT models, difficulties tolerating 
uncertainty about the meaning of bodily sensations may foster selective attention toward body signals, which further 
amplifies the fear of cata strophic physical consequences, thus fueling health anxiety (HA). In the current study, we aimed 
to expand extant knowledge on the interplay between IU and AS in predicting HA in an Italian community -based sample 
recruited before the pandemic.  
Method: Four -hundred and thirteen Italian individuals (65.6% female; Mage=38.92±14) completed an online survey 
containing self -report measures including the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale -Revised, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index -3, the 
Health Anxiety Questionnaire, an d the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales -21. Among participants, 101 (24.5%) reported 
suffering from medical health problems. We first examined whether there was a specific indirect effect of IU on HA 
through the AS dimensions (i.e., Physical, Cognitive, and  Social Concerns) by running a parallel multiple mediation model 
(Model 1). An alternative model testing the indirect effect of the three AS dimensions on HA through IU was also evaluated 
(Model 2). Medical status (i.e., healthy/unhealthy) and general dist ress were included as covariates in both models.  
Results. With respect to Model 1, the total effect model was significant (adjusted R2=.35, F3,408=72.04, p&lt;.001). Only AS 
Physical Concerns significantly mediated the path from IU to HA (b=.1621, SE=.0375, 95% CIs=.0957, .2454). General 
distress was a significant covariate, whereas medical status was not. Model 2 was also significant (adjusted R2=.39, 
F5,406=52.04, p&lt;.001). Findings showed that IU totally mediated the paths from AS Cognitive Con cerns (b=.1995, 
SE=.0601, 95% CIs=.0965, .3361) and AS Social Concerns (b=.0824, SE=.0427, 95% CIs=.0069, .1745) to HA. AS Physical 
Concerns was directly related to HA, but the indirect effect through IU was not significant. General distress was the only 
significant covariate.  
Discussion: Current findings align with previous literature outlining that IU and AS interact in promoting HA. However, IU 
seems to play a prominent role in such a complex interplay, thus tentatively suggesting that AS may be the way through 
which IU operates in HA. Clinical implications will be discussed.  
 
Interoceptive awareness moderates the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and worry in the 
context of the COVID -19 pandemic: an international study in  English - and Spanish -speaking samples

Introduction : The COVID -19 pandemic provided a context for studying how we process uncertainty and the emotional 
reactions to uncertain situations. Cognitive models of anxiety disorders and, specifically, generalised anxiety disorders 
typically focus on the strong link between intolerance of uncertainty and worry. However, interoceptive awareness -the 
ability to perceive and sense bodily sensations - has been pointed out as another potentially crucial element that might lead 
to distress or worry.  
Methods : In this study, we evaluate the potential mediation role of interoceptive awareness between intolerance of 
uncertainty (measured by the IUS -5; Bottesi et al., 2020) and worry (measured by the PSWQ -3; Kertz et al., 2014) in an 
English -speaking and a Spanish -speaking commun ity sample collected from late 2020 to early 2021.  
Results : Our results supported the mediation role of interoceptive awareness in both the English -speaking (B = 0.061, p = 
.000, 95% CI [0.028, 0.110]) and the Spanish -speaking sample (B = 0.198, p = .000, 95% CI [0.099, 0.301]).  
Discussion : These results highlight  the importance of interoceptive awareness in managing uncertainty, specifically in those 
with high levels of intolerance of uncertainty. Finally, the significance of these results will be discussed in the context o f 
cognitive -behavioural models of anxiety  and interventions.

Does interoceptive awareness mediate the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and health and 
social anxiety?

University , UK; Mark  Freeston , Newcastle University , UK  
Background: The relationship between intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and social anxiety is well -established, but less so with 
health anxiet y. While traditional accounts of IU represent it as a set of beliefs about uncertainty, which are certainly 
present in generalized anxiety disorder, other accounts propose that IU represents a felt sense of unsafety that is aversive 
and may lead to cogniti ve representations of uncertainty and threat. This study investigates whether the relationship 
between IU and anxiety is mediated by interoceptive awareness. It further considers whether anxiety sensitivity (AS), a 
well-established vulnerability factor, mo derates this relationship in that physical AS would strengthen the relationship with 
health anxiety, whilst social AS would strengthen the relationship with social anxiety.  
Methods: A community sample (N = 197) was recruited from a variety of sources. As part of a larger survey, participants 
completed established measures of IU, health and social anxiety, and anxiety sensitivity, as well as a novel measure of 
interoceptive awareness. The Inventory of Differential Interoceptive Awareness consists of four su bscales, Listening, 
Noticing, and Trusting in relation to positive and negative internal states, as well as Unsafety, which is the perception of 
the body as not well known, alien, and unfamiliar.   
Results: Significant direct effects were detected between IU and health and social anxiety. The relationship between IU and 
health anxiety was mediated by Listening and Unsafety as well as a serial path through Trusting and Unsafety, but was not 
moderated by physical AS. The relationship between IU and social anx iety was mediated by Unsafety and a serial path 
through Trusting and Unsafety; both indirect effects were moderated by social AS. The indirect effects were significant at 
above median levels of social AS and increasing.  
Discussion: These findings replicat e the relationship between IU and two different types of anxiety and extend previous 
knowledge by identifying a potential role of people’s sense of their body state in understanding how IU leads to anxiety.  
The results also provide preliminary evidence fo r how IU and AS may both contribute to the severity of social anxiety 
symptoms. Replication is needed and future studies should test similar models for panic symptoms, worry, and other 
mental health problems with a significant anxiety component.  
 
The felt sense of the unknown: Interoceptive appraisals and emotional reactions in uncertain every -day life 
situations.

Introduction: Uncertainty is a felt sense of unsafety rather than a detection of threat. This felt sense may be experienced a s 
a bodily/bottom -up source of in formation. How internal signals are experienced and labelled will determine responses to 
uncertain situations. Applying the somatic error hypothesis to Intolerance of Uncertainty, the uncomfortable feelings 
generated by the unknown -ness of a situation may be attributed not to uncertainty but to an expectation of threat. The 
current study investigated the experience of uncertainty in everyday life situation with a novel methodology that links the 
felt sense of uncertainty in the situation to appraisals of th at sense and individual differences in interoceptive awareness.  
Methods:  Participants (N = 150) rated the salience of uncertain situations where the most obvious negative outcome had 
been excluded.  They chose the most salient situation and were asked to scan their body while imagining it. Participants 
then completed measures appraising the sensation and their emotional reaction to the situation. They then completed 
measures of physical sensations they experience in unknown situations and a measure of inte roceptive awareness.  
Results: The measure of emotional reactions resulted in factors named nervous, excited, hostile, proud, and attentive. The 
first three served as outcome variables in hierarchical regressions. Age, gender and scenario salience were ente red as 
covariates. Appraisals (factors labelled nagging, familiar, valence and overwhelming) were entered first, followed by 
physical sensations (factors labelled tense, stomach, twitchy, dissociated) and finally by a measure of interoceptive 
sensibility. Salience was not significant, and different appraisals and sensations predicted the different emotions, while 
interoceptive awareness made a significant contribution for nervousness.  
Discussion: Results show proof of concept for a methodology to investigat e the experience of uncertainty that does not 
equate uncertainty with threat. The emotional reactions reflect a differentiated response to uncertainty and there is 
preliminary evidence for appraisals and physical sensations that may be specifically associa ted with these emotional 
responses. Warranting replication and further validation, these preliminary results are promising to further an 
understanding of how somatic errors  qualify the relationship between IU and a number of anxiety -related mental health 
disorders.

 LGBTQ+ mental health: Focus on young people  
Chair: Katharine Rimes, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, UK  
 
LGBTQ+ mental health disparities: current considerations and future priorities  
Joanna  Semlyen , University of East Anglia , UK 
There is clear evidence of significant mental health disparities in sexual minorities in the UK (Semlye n et al 2016) and an 
emergent data corpus suggesting similar mental health disorders in gender minorities. The mental health disparities in the 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer plus other (LGBTQ+) community continue to persist despite evidence of  
increased societal support and legislative measures and are likely to have been magnified by the recent socio -behavioural 
isolation enforcement measures in the pandemic. However there is a dearth of data to demonstrate this, reflecting the lack 
of nationa l data collection within the UK. This lack of representative data leads to impoverished research quality, resulting 
in inferior research findings and subsequent minimal policy impact.  
We know this population widely report experiencing barriers to care, an d also seek psychological treatment at a higher 
rate than the cisgendered and heterosexual community (King et al 2007) which, along with demonstrable higher rate of 
common mental disorder (King et al 2008), indicates a significant need for effective treatm ents in this population.  
This presentation will provide contemporary data on LGBTQ+ health disparities focusing on the UK context, offering a 
critical consideration of LGBTQ+ research quality and design, and will present current and future priorities for research and 
practice, with a particular focus on interventions in this population.

Self-Esteem in Sexual Minority Children and Adolescents

Self-Esteem in Sexual Minority Children and Adolescents: A Retrospective Analysis of Birth -Cohort Data  
Bladen, H., Rimes, K. Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King’s College London.  
Introduction: Lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults and adolescents have lower self -esteem than heterosexuals (Bridge, Smith 
and Rimes, 2019; Argyriou, Goldsmith , Tsokos and Rimes, 2020). Little research has investigated whether this disparity 
exists in childhood or how changes in sexual identity relate to self -esteem.  
Method: Participants were 2373 adolescents (879 males and 1494 females) from the Avon Longitudi nal Study of Parents 
and Children (ALSPAC) project, an ongoing longitudinal study (Boyd et al., 2013). Multiple regression analyses investigated 
the relationships between sexual orientation at age 15 and 21 years and sexual orientation stability with self -esteem at age 
8 and 17 years while controlling for demographic variables, abuse, and bullying. To test for sex differences, the interaction  
effect between sex at birth and sexual orientation was included as a predictor.  
Results: Sexual minority status at a ge 15 years, but not at age 21 years, was associated with lower self -esteem at age 8 
years. Only a shift from sexual minority at age 15 years to heterosexual at age 21 years associated with lower self -esteem 
at age 8 relative to consistent heterosexuality.  Sexual minority status at 15 and 21 years was associated with low self -
esteem at age 17 years, regardless of reported change or stability in sexual orientation between ages 15 and 21 years.  
Controlling for bullying and abuse did not affect the strengths of these associations. The interaction term between sexual 
orientation and sex at birth was not significant.  
Discussion: The self -esteem discrepancy between sexual minority people and heterosexuals emerges as early as 8 years of 
age. Although adjusting fo r abuse and bullying did not affect the strengths of the associations, there were limitations with 
the assessment methods and it is recommended that these and other potential contributory factors should be investigated 
in future research.

Acceptability, feasibility,  and preliminary efficacy of a compassion -based cognitive behavioural intervention 
for low self -esteem in sexual minority young adults  
Livvy  Bridge , King's College London , UK; Lovedeep  Rai, King's College London , UK; Katrina  McMullan , King's 
College London , UK; Katie  Langford , King's College London , UK; Katharine  Rimes , King's College London , UK  
Background: Sexual minori ty young adults (those identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual for example) experience higher 
rates of mental health problems than heterosexual young adults. It has been suggested that minority stress explains this 
disparity, partly by elevating rates of general risk factors including low self -esteem. Low self -esteem can impair daily 
functioning and is also a risk or maintenance factor for several mental health problems.  Self -esteem therefore presents a 
potential target for intervention to reduce mental h ealth inequalities. This study assessed the acceptability, feasibility, and 
preliminary efficacy of a new compassion -based cognitive behavioural intervention for self -esteem tailored to sexual 
minority young adults.  
Method: Participants were a community s ample of 24 sexual minority young adults aged 16 -24 experiencing clinically 
significant low self -esteem. An uncontrolled pre/post design was used with qualitative feedback and quantitative 
outcomes. Self -report standardised measures were completed at basel ine, pre -intervention, intervention mid -point, post -
intervention and two -month follow up. Preliminary investigation of efficacy was examined through post -intervention 
changes in self -esteem, functioning, anxiety, and depression. Potential mechanisms of cha nge were examined through 
changes in self -compassion, self -criticism, and unhelpful coping responses to minority stress.  
Results: Results showed good acceptability and feasibility; 95% of participants said they found the intervention useful and 
would recom mend it to those experiencing similar difficulties.  There was preliminary evidence of intervention efficacy for 
improving self -esteem, functioning, depression, and anxiety. Notably, 85% of the young adults showed a reliable change in 
self-esteem to above the clinical cut -off at follow -up. There was also evidence for improvement in self -compassion, and 
reduction in self -criticism.  
Conclusion: This new intervention showed good acceptability and feasibility in a community sample. Randomised 
controlled studie s are needed to further examine efficacy of the intervention and suitability for use in different settings 
(e.g., primary care mental health or university counselling services). Self -compassion and reduced self -criticism could be 
investigated in future stu dies as treatment mediators.  
 
Enhancing the acceptability of an online cognitive behavioural therapy intervention for LGBTIQ+ youth: The 
case study of SPARX

of Auckland, New Zealand ; Theresa  Fleming , Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand ; Matthew  
Shepherd , Massey University, New Zealand ; Sally  Merry , University of Auckland, New Zealand   
Introduction: Many young people will experience depression and anxiety, but access to evidence -based psychological 
therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT),  is limited. Common barriers to therapy access include a range of 
factors, such as the stigma associated with mental ill -health and a lack of qualified therapists for those who do attempt to 
seek formal support. Computerised or online CBT in self -help form at provides an opportunity to deliver treatment to many 
young people, especially for those under -served by services at present, at a time and place of their choosing. We 
developed a gamified CBT intervention called SPARX (Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic , X-factors thoughts) for adolescents 
with depressive symptoms which has been made freely available to young people in New Zealand since 2014. Its initial 
development involved co -design work and consultation sessions including with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/trans, 
intersex and questioning (LGBTIQ+) young people. Over 10,000 adolescents have used SPARX since its launch in New 
Zealand, including 207 trans and 50 intersex users. LGBTIQ+ young people have previously indicated that SPARX should be 
enha nced, especially in relation to the intervention's 'look and feel' for LGBTIQ+ youth.  
Method: Three online focus groups and follow -up email consultations involved 12 LGBTIQ+ young people (16 to 25 years 
old) in New Zealand. Participants were recruited fro m two LGBTIQ+ youth organisations. We conducted a thematic analysis 
of the qualitative data generated.  
Results: Most participants had used SPARX prior to their involvement in this study. Participants described a number of 
challenges associated with online  environments. LGBTIQ+ youth suggested non -binary options for gender diverse users be 
developed for SPARX. They also further highlighted that representation and choice are important factors in terms of 
making SPARX more acceptable to LGBTIQ+ youth in New Z ealand (and elsewhere).  
Discussion: SPARX has now been modified based on participants’ feedback. Our intention is to evaluate the refined 
iteration of SPARX (i.e., SPARX Version 2.0) and explore its use with LGBTIQ+ young people outside of New Zealand.

Innovative group work in different settings - Lessons learned?  
Chair: Isabel Clar ke, Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK  
 
Open group cognitive behaviour therapy on acute in -patient units  
Victoria  Boynton , Humber NHS foundation Trust , UK; Christopher  Sanderson , RDaSH , UK 
Introduction: Adult mental health inpatient units primarily provide a service for people deemed to be at significant risk to 
themselves or others, where treatment cannot be provided safely in the community. Whilst psychological interventions are 
indicated during episodes of acute mental distress, those on offer generally tend to be more psychoeducational and/ or 
skills based in nature. Conventional methods of group CBT that rely on diagnostic specificity with set numbers of sessions 
are not particularly well suited to the acute ward with varying presentations and unpredictable length of stays. Evaluation 
from i npatient CBT psychoeducation groups has suggested limited effectiveness outside of the group setting with patients 
reporting an inability to generalise skills due to the acuity of their difficulties. A common complaint remains amongst those  
admitted that t here is a lack of psychological provision at a time of crisis when people most need to reflect and make sense 
of their experiences. Method: Open group therapy approaches provide a more flexible framework whereby members 
regardless of diagnosis are free to join and leave as they wish. Attendees define the therapeutic target at the start of each 
session, meaning there is no pre -set goal or psychoeducational structure. The group format follows a standard CBT session 
structure with a group agenda set and Socrat ic questioning techniques utilised to inform a basic group formulation. 
Psychoeducation and change techniques are introduced in response to a shared understanding of the defined target. 
Results: Those who have attended Open group CBT to date have reported feeling validated and understood and found it 
helpful to share and reflect on their experiences. Common psychological themes occurred throughout group discussion 
that otherwise would have been incorporated into a psychoeducational session. Discussion: Inpa tient units often utilise 
psychoeducation -based programs, however this presents significant challenges associated with the acuity and 
unpredictability of the acute environment. Open group approaches provide a transdiagnostic framework which focuses on 
comm on processes shared across disorders.  This open group format is rarely reported on in the literature and remains 
empirically untested. However preliminary evaluation of using open group therapy techniques within inpatient services has 
found it be feasible , acceptable and reflective of clinical need.

Focused Brief Group Therapy:  A Measurement Based Care Approach  
Martyn  Whittingham , Whittingham Psychological Services , UK 
Focused Brief Group Therapy (FBGT) is a transdiagnostic, integrative interpersonal process group approach that blends the 
art and science of therapy.  Developed over a 7 -year period at a university counseling center i n the USA, it is designed to 
reduce interpersonal distress in eight sessions or less.  FBGT incorporates measurement based care to personalize 
treatment, enhancing pre -group preparation, process and outcomes.  
Effectiveness research has shown statistically  significant reductions in depression, social anxiety, hostility and interpersonal 
distress. Research has also shown lower premature dropout rates for the approach - a central goal of the therapy.  
This presentation will outline the structure and core prin ciples of the approach, with particular attention paid to how the 
interpersonal circumplex is used to improve the working alliance and to generate successful outcomes.   
FBGT is currently being used widely across the USA, China and Singapore in university counseling centers and outpatient 
settings.

 Introduction : The challenge of individuals presenting diagnostic complexity; chronic service use; emotional avoidance and 
other contra -indicators to good progress has been tackl ed in an IAPT service through this programme.  
Method : The CCC programme links individual, trauma informed, emotion focused, formulation sessions with a group 
programme designed to teach the alternative emotion management and relational skills identified b y the formulation as 
needed to break maintaining cycles. The content of the group programme in particular will be explained. It starts from 
simple tools to manage arousal, such as mindfulness, behavioural activation and breathing and progresses to emotion and 
relationship management, self -compassion, positive use of anger. It then progresses to the intra psychic (different 
potentials of the self) relationship and rebuilding a new relationship with the traumatic past, without reliving.  
Results : Preliminary e valuation shows improved recovery for those who failed to progress with prior CBT. Paper in 
preparation.  
Discussion : The challenges and rewards of this approach will be covered. Though based on the skills teaching model first 
introduced by Dialectical Beha viour Therapy (DBT), group therapeutic factors play an important role in the success of the 
programme. It requires much of participants but despite not requiring (or encouraging) deep sharing about the past, which 
is covered in the individual formulation s essions, it has been shown to forge strong bonds within the group which greatly 
assist the therapeutic process.

Delivering groups in prisons can be powerful and bring a multitude of benefits to those attending, but require planning, 
preparation, and a high level of skill from the facilitator. Delivery of groups provides valuable skill develop ment for clinical 
staff and has allowed for innovation, pragmatism, and coproduction with service users to maximise the delivery and impact 
groups can have but training in this area remains relatively scarce. Within this session we will explore the differe nt types of 
groups delivered within our IAPT service across the Criminal Justice directorate and the learning around facilitator 
competence to inform a discussion around a developmental pathway to effective group management.   
Knowledge and research into g roup dynamics and group management will be reviewed and explored to assimilate 
knowledge and contextualise with service specific experiences. Anecdotal feedback from patient questionnaires will be 
incorporated.  
The session will conclude with a considerati on as to learning and development required for group facilitators, both in terms 
of competence, confidence and quality assurance.  
 
The role and influence of cognition and anxiety in pain: targets for treatment in co -morbidity  
Chair: Simon Blackwell, Ruhr-Universit ät Bochum, Germany  
 
Intrusive Mental Imagery in Chronic Pain: Prevalence and Associations with Common Comorbidities  
Jake  Maxwell Watts , University of Bath , UK; Simon  Blackwell , Ruhr -Universität Bochum , Germany , Germany ; Jo 
Daniels , University of Bath , UK 
Chronic pain is highly prevalent and distressing with limited treatment efficacy. Prior research finds associations between 
mental imagery and chronic pain, particularly with common co -morbidities such as anxiety, depression, and health anxiety. 
However, prevalence estimates vary with small sample sizes. A better understanding of imagery and pain could help 
improve cognitive -behavioural therapies. This study a imed to describe the prevalence of mental imagery in a chronic pain 
sample and examine the extent to which imagery - and negative interpretations of it - explained variation in pain intensity 
and disability when controlling for common co -morbidities. Parti cipants with chronic pain (n = 151) completed measures of 
anxiety, depression, health anxiety, general imagery use, and pain -related mental imagery. Anxiety, depression and health 
anxiety significantly explained 14.8% of the variance in pain intensity (p & lt; .001) and 15.2% in pain disability (p &lt; .001). 
General imagery use and pain -related imagery did not significantly explain any additional variance. Imagery was 
interpreted negatively, experienced as moderately distressing, and associated with higher rates of anxiety, depression and

65 
 
 
 health anxiety. Imagery is associated with the symptoms of anxiety and mood disorders that commonly co -occur with 
chronic pain, but its presence appears to have no direct relationship with pain intensity or disability. Futu re research 
should explore underlying mechanisms.   
 
Psychological Predictors of Health Anxiety and Pain in Ambulatory Presentations in a Hospital Emergency 
Department  
Sophie  Harris, University of Bath and Oxford Health NHS , UK; Hannah  Parker , Cardiff University , UK; Edward  
Carlton , North Bristol NHS Trust, UK ; Jo Daniels , University of Bath, UK  
Introduction: Health anxiety (HA) in attendees of outpatient medical clinics is well established, however there has been a 
lack of research into HA in emergency settings. This study explored the prevalence of HA in ambulatory present ations in a 
tertiary emergency department (ED) as well as factors associated with pain and HA.  
Method: A cross -sectional questionnaire design gathered data from adult ED ambulatory attendees across a four -day 
period to assess psychological and physical hea lth variables. Number of ED attendances over the previous 12 months was 
accessed through health records.  
Results: Of the final sample (n = 106), 77% were white British, 54% were male, and 14% presented with severe HA as 
measured by the Short Health Anxiet y Inventory (≥ 18). Participants with pre -existing health conditions had significantly 
higher levels of HA (M = 12.36, SE = 1.59) compared to those without (M = 7.79, SE = 0.66). Stepwise multiple regression 
analyses identified anxiety sensitivity and pain  catastrophizing as significant independent predictors of HA, explaining 51% 
of the variance in HA. Pain catastrophizing was also a significant independent predictor of pain, accounting for 20% of the 
variance.  
Discussion: This study provides insight into  HA prevalence in ED ambulatory presentations and key psychological predictors 
of HA and pain. This has implications for treatment in an ED setting whereby patients may benefit from referral to medical 
psychology or mental health services.   
 
The Role of Cognitive -Affective Factors in Symptom Severity and Quality of Life in Raynaud’s Phenomenon  
Dulcie  Irving , University of Bath, UK ; Jo Daniels , University of Bath, UK  
Despite anxiety/stress being a key trigger for Raynaud’s phenomenon episodes, related research is still in its infancy and no 
current interventions address first -line management lifestyle recommendations. We examined the role of cognitive -
affective factors in symptom severity and quality of life (QoL) and differences between Raynaud’s types 
(primary/secondary) to i nform intervention development; cognitive behavioural therapy is a potentially suitable treatment 
option, given NICE recommendations for use with anxiety and robust evidence base in other medical conditions. A cross -
sectional design was used. Adults with R aynaud’s (N=210) completed an online questionnaire measuring stress, anxiety, 
depression, anxiety sensitivity (AS), beliefs about emotions, symptom severity and QoL. Raynaud’s groups 
(primary/secondary) differed in anxiety, symptom severity and QoL (ps&lt; .004). Stepwise regressions indicated anxiety 
and Raynaud’s type explained 23% variance in hand symptom severity; anxiety, Raynaud’s type and AS explained 29% 
variance in symptom severity (global impact); depression, Raynaud’s type and AS explained 32% var iance in QoL 
(ps&lt;.001). These findings suggest that anxiety, AS and depression may be useful intervention targets. They provide a firm 
basis for the applicability of CBT in Raynaud's; it is imperative that we tailor interventions to the unique character istics of 
each presenting problem. We present initial findings that may underpin an adaption of CBT for Raynaud’s.

Childhood experiences associated with heightened responsibility for self vs others in obsessive -compulsive 
disorder  
Lucas  Shelemy , University of Oxford , UK; Paul  Salkovskis , University of Oxford , UK  
This research seeks to un derstand how different childhood experiences are related to the sense of responsibility for 
oneself and for others. These factors are compared with different OCD sub -types and between adults with and without 
OCD. Results will be shared and implications for  intervention will be explored.

 Is that really who I am? An experimental investigation of perceptions of violation of the self and mental 
contamination  
Sandra  Krause , Concordia University , Canada ; Adam  Radomsky , Concordia University , Canada   
Mental contamination refers to contamination concerns that arise in the a bsence of direct contact with a contaminant, and 
is a common symptom in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Cognitive models of mental contamination highlight the 
central role of perceptions of violation in the onset and maintenance of these feelings. Tha t said, little research has been 
done to operationally define the construct of violation and systematically examine its different components. Maladaptive 
appraisals of the self have been identified as maintaining factors in cognitive models of OCD. Thus, p erceptions of violation 
of one’s self -concept may represent an aspect of violation appraisal relevant to the experience of mental contamination.  
The present study experimentally examined the impact of violations of individuals’ sense of self on subsequent  feelings of 
mental contamination. For the study, 150 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions after 
receiving false feedback that they scored in the top 5th percentile on a morality subscale of a bogus personality measure. 
Those who were asked to write about their own past immoral behaviour reported significantly higher levels of mental 
contamination than those who were asked to write about their own past moral behaviour, or a non -self-referent negative 
event. That said, the re were no differences between conditions with regard to reported urges to wash. The findings 
suggest that perceptions of violation of the self may be a particularly relevant violation appraisal in the context of mental  
contamination. Further, these percep tions may therefore prove to be effective treatment targets for those experiencing 
symptoms of mental contamination.  
 
Responses to autobiographical imagery involving being perpetrator or victim of betrayal in OCD and control 
participants  
Paul  Salkovskis , University of Oxford , UK; Sam  French , University of Oxford , UK  
Menta l Contamination (MC) in those suffering from OCD has been linked to the experience of betrayal. More recently it 
has been suggested that this may be due to sensitivity to ideas of being responsible for betraying others. In this study 
participants with OCD and community controls were randomised to eliciting historical images where they had either been 
betrayed by someone they trusted, or had betrayed a person who trusted them. The primary variable was the state mental 
contamination measure. Both imagery cond itions elicited similar levels of mental contamination. OCD participants had a 
greater increase in state contamination that controls regardless of experimental condition. Results suggest that those with 
OCD experience increases in mental contamination when  recalling betrayal events in imagery at the same level when they 
are the perpetrator or victim.  Implications for the treatment of MC are considered  
 
Appraisals of intrusions: The role of threat and intolerance of uncertainty across OCD -like, Worry -like and 
Psychosis -like personally salient intrusive experiences  
Mark  Freeston , Newcastle University, U K; Lauren  Mawn , Newcastle -upon -Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 
and Newcastle University , UK; Anna  Luce , Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust , UK; 
Nicola  Barclay , Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust , UK; Guy Dodgson , Cumbria, 
Northumberland, Tyne & W ear NHS Foundation Trust , UK 
Background: While there is now consistent evidence that dispositional intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a transdiagnostic 
risk factor, the role of situational IU versus threat appraisal s in situational distress remains largely unknown.  This study 
used a semi -idiographic design where participants appraise their most salient target intrusive experience in terms of both 
threat and situational IU.  
Methods:  A community sample (N = 595) was  recruited from a variety of sources.  From lists of frequently rated scenarios, 
participants chose their most worry -like, OCD -like, and psychosis -like (i.e., unusual) intrusive experiences and appraised 
each on both threat (likelihood, severity and immine nce) and IU (uncertainty and bothered by the uncertainty). 
Participants were assigned to a group based on cut -offs/algorithmic decisions from screening measures.  An additional 
group was recruited from Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) service.  The sa lience of the target scenario salience was high 
and balanced across groups, apart from the EIP group who scored significantly higher. An ANOVA/ANCOVA design was 
used where the severity of the target experience (sum of Frequency, Duration, Distress, Interfe rence) was the DV, Group 
was the IV, and situational threat and IU were the covariates/mediators.   
Results: There was a significant effect of group. Both covariates made significant contributions showing that differences in 
severity were partially account ed for/mediated by both threat and IU.  Further, the Group X Covariate interactions were 
significant for both threat and IU, indicating that the relationship between threat and IU with severity varied by group.  
However, effect sizes for the Covariate/Medi ator X Group interactions were small -medium, while those for the 
covariate/mediator in the model were medium -large.

67 
 
 
 Discussion: Results are consistent with the notion that both situational threat and IU appraisals predict severity of 
personally salient int rusive experiences across groups, with the contribution of IU at least as large as that of threat.  
Further, these relationships varied across groups to some degree, with the Possible OCD + Psychosis group probably 
accounting for the significant interactio n with non -significant relationships between appraisals and severity.  Overall, these 
proof -of-concept findings contribute to the notion that IU is transdiagnostic and that its situational contribution is at least 
as large as that of threat appraisals.

The benefits of open research for clinical science  
Katherine  Button , University of Bath , UK  
Psychology has received much criticism of late, with classic findings failing to replicate, and an appreciation that many 
published findings may be unreliable. Small sample sizes and questionab le research practices such as p -hacking, 
hypothesising after the results are known, and selectively publishing positive results have all been implicated as 
contributing factors.  In response there is a move toward rigorous and transparent scientific practic es, such as pre -
registering study protocols or publishing using Registered Reports, making materials and data open access, publishing pre -
prints, designing studies with sufficient statistical power, and team science approaches to pool resources and experti se.  
Here I discuss the pros and cons of adopting these open research practices, for the individual researcher and the 
advancement of clinical research, drawing on lessons learnt from the COVID pandemic.  
 
Research skills; What should be  on the curriculum for trainee clinicians?  
Pamela  Jacobsen , University of Bath , UK  
Training people to be evidence -based practitioners requires the inclusion of research skills on the curriculum, in 
recognition of the fact that they will be consumers, if not also, producers of research over the course of their career.  
Research skills training should therefore cover both these training needs; in being able to unde rstand, interpret, and apply 
research findings, as well as being able to design, conduct, analyse, and disseminate original research.  This talk will use UK-
based Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy) training as an example of how research skills can be successfu lly incorporated into the 
curriculum, whilst acknowledging transferable factors to the training of other kinds of clinical practitioners, both in the U K 
and internationally.  
This talk will use the framework of Constructive Alignment to outline an effective  curriculum in which learning activities 
and assessments are aligned to the desired learning outcomes.  It is important that research skills training, like clinical s kills 
training, is continually updated to keep up with advances in the field.  Key topics which are increasingly being given greater 
prominence on research curricula include Equality & Diversity, involvement of people with Lived Experience, and Open 
Science.  Practical examples will be given of how these topics have been incorporated into the r esearch curriculum at one 
DClinPsy training programme in the UK (University of Bath).

How best to establish 'proof of concept' for novel psychological therapies: Opportunities and challenges  
Barney  Dunn , University of Exeter , UK 
A significant challenge in improving CBT practice is accelerating the speed at which enhanced therapies can be developed, 
evaluated, and implemented. A critical rate limiting step can be generating sufficient early ‘proof of concept’ data to 
determine if a treatment is worth developing and evaluating further. There remains a lack of clarity in the field about how 
best to establish this early ‘proof of concept’ data. This talk will review various potential methods to establish proof of 
concept for novel therapies, including use of intensive time series case series designs, bench marking pre -post effect sizes 
from rou tine practice to the existing trials literature, and examination of the confidence intervals of exploratory between -
group analyses in pilot trials to judge the probability a novel treatment might be inferior, equivalent to, or superior to 
existing treatmen ts. 
 
Making the leap: from experimental psychopathology to clinical trials  
Simon  Blackwell , Ruhr -Universität Bochum, Bochum, Germany ; Marcella  Woud , Ruhr -Universität Bochum, 
Bochum, Germany   
A substantial amount of experimental psychopathology research is carried out with the aim of developing new 
psycho logical treatments informed by basic science. However, moving from experimental studies to the clinical trials 
required to test effectiveness of new interventions often poses many problems. These problems include not only those 
common to any form of treatm ent development research, but further difficulties that relate to differences in the 
developmental route often taken by treatments arising from experimental psychopathology research and those originating 
from direct clinical experience. This talk explores some of the complexities of the translational process in trying to develop, 
or inform development of, novel interventions using an experimental psychopathology approach. It further considers some 
of the ins and outs of clinical trials methodology, from pla nning through to reporting, with a particular focus on those 
aspects that often seem to trip up experimental psychopathology researchers. The overall aim is to provide some guidance 
that may help improve the quality of this translational research and incre ase the chance of successful clinical translation 
and novel treatment development from basic science.

The clinically significant psychological features of delusions in the early course of psychosis: Systematic 
narrative review and pilot clinical template.

London, UK ; Jennifer  Bond , University College London, UK ; Jonathan  Souray , Central and Nort h West London

Introduction: Delusions are hig hly prevalent in patients presenting to Early Intervention in Psychosis services (Rajapakse et 
al., 2011), but national/international guidelines (NICE, 2014; Addington et al., 2018) do not specify which features are 
clinically important enough to be assess ed. The present review therefore summarises the evidence base, dividing delusion 
features into the domains of structure, content and meta -cognitive beliefs; and domains of clinical significance into course, 
cause, co -morbidity, consequence and CBT -response . Method: We searched PsycINFO/MEDLINE and conducted a manual 
search to identify quantitative papers examining the association between delusion psychological features and clinically 
important variables in early course psychosis patients. Results: Twenty -seven studies were included, with 35 types of 
clinical significance identified. Five structural features of delusions predicted worse course (long term psychiatric 
morbidity) and one other structural feature predicted favourable response to group CBT. Severa l content features of 
delusions predicted co -morbidity (anxiety, depression, substance abuse), consequences (suicide, violence, distress) and 
cause/prior childhood/adult traumas. Several meta -cognitive beliefs about delusion content predicted PTSD and dist ress. 
Discussion: This review offers clinicians a pilot psychological template for influencing evidence -based clinical decisions 
about patients who present with early course delusions.

 STOP - Successful Treatment of Paranoia: Replacing harmful paranoid thoughts with better alternatives  
Carolina  Fialho , King's College London, UK ; Jenny  Yiend , King's College London, UK  
Introduction: Persecutory delusions, characterised by paranoid thinking, are the most frequent and clinically significant 
symptoms of psychosis. These delusions are believed to be sustained by biased cognitive and emotional processes. 
Cognitive Bias Modifi cation for paranoia (CBM -pa) is an intervention targeting the biased interpretation of emotional 
ambiguity associated with paranoia. This study aims to build on the methodology to test the efficacy of a mobile app 
version (STOP) of CBM -pa.  
Method: The STO P study is a double -blind, randomised controlled trial (RCT) for 273 stabilised outpatients with persistent, 
distressing paranoid symptoms. Patients will be randomised to either STOP (6 or 12 weeks) or text -reading control (12 
weeks), receiving a weekly 40 -min session. STOP involves reading text inviting paranoid interpretations, but then 
generating responses reflecting an alternative, non -paranoid interpretation. Treatment as Usual will continue for all 
patients. Patients will be assessed at baseline, foll owing sessions, and at 6 -, 12-, 18- and 24 -weeks post -randomisation. The 
primary outcome is the severity of paranoid symptoms at 24 -weeks. The secondary outcomes are clinical symptoms and 
measurement of interpretation bias at baseline and follow -ups.  
Discussion: This study will assess whether STOP is effective and has the potential to be a low -cost and accessible 
intervention to complement other psychological treatments for paranoia.

People with psychosis are at increased risk of suicide death. Talking thera pies can alleviate suicidal experiences. Therapies 
need to be effective and acceptable to recipients. The CARMS project investigates the efficacy and mechanisms of a talking 
therapy (CBSPp) for people experiencing suicidality and psychosis. The aim of this  study was to assess CBSPp’s acceptability 
using data from attendance and engagement, and analyses of interviews using Theoretical Framework of Acceptability 
(TFA). CARMS was a two -armed randomised controlled trial comparing CBSPp plus Treatment As Usual ( TAU) with TAU 
alone. Participants were recruited from NHS services in North -West England and were over 18 years, had non -affective 
psychosis, and experienced recent suicidal thoughts, plans, and/or attempts. To assess acceptability of CBSPp, data on 
attend ance were collated and semi -structured interviews were conducted. Data were deductively analysed using the TFA. 
149 people received CBSPp plus TAU. A median of 16 sessions were attended. 20 participants took part in the qualitative 
study. Seven themes were  identified: Affective attitude, Burden, Ethicality, Intervention coherence, Opportunities, 
Perceived effectiveness, Self -efficacy. There was no evidence of loss of opportunities as a result of receiving CBSPp. CBSPp 
was perceived as being acceptable. Talk ing about suicide was difficult but important for understanding experiences. 
Offering flexible modes of delivery is paramount to acceptability.

London, UK  
Introduction: Depersonalisation -Derealisation Disorder (DDD) has a prevalence of around 1%. We report on a clinical audit 
of 36 par ticipants who were sequentially recruited from a specialist CBT clinic in London with a diagnosis of chronic DDD 
(mean duration of 14 years) and who attended at least 8 sessions.  
Methods: Three outcomes were assessed (Cambridge Depersonalisation Scale [CD S], Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] and 
the Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI]) at three time points in a naturalistic, self -controlled, cross -over design. Hierarchical 
longitudinal analyses for outcome response clustered by patient were performed using scores f rom baseline, beginning of 
therapy and end of therapy.  
Results: Participants did not show a statistically significant change in any of the outcome measures between baseline and 
start of treatment, however there were statistically significant reductions du ring the treatment period. The reduction in 
CDS scores in the waiting period was -4.32 (95%CI: -20.023 to 11.39) and after the treatment period was -36.35 (95%CI: -
52.33 to -20.28). The reduction in BDI scores was -4.64 (95% CI: -9.40 to 0.13) in the waiti ng period and -12.86 (95% CI: -
17.70 to -8.02) after the treatment period. BAI scores showed a reduction of -3.02 (95% CI: -7.01 to 0.97) during the 
waiting period and -6.76 (95% CI: -10.82 to -2.69) after the treatment period.  
Conclusions: CBT may be an effective treatment for DDD.

University of Bremen, Germany   
Introduction: Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) experience dissatisfaction or concerns abo ut certain aspects 
of their appearance. Appearance concerns are one example for a distorted body representation. Components of body 
representations (especially body image and body schema) have been defined and operationalized in a heterogenous way in 
clinical psychology and related fields. This has made it difficult to integrate findings on the role of body representations for 
the development, maintenance, and treatment of different disorders. As part of a systematic review (PROSPERO 
registration: CRD420202 20303), we developed a conceptual framework and used it to integrate previous research on body 
representations across different disorders (BDD, muscle dysmorphia - MD, body integrity dysphoria - BID). In the current 
talk, this framework and the results of studies on body representation in BDD will be presented.  
Method: We screened 2552 publications on body representations in BDD, MD and BID, out of which 212 studies with 
approx. 35.000 participants were included for further analyses.  
Results: BDD was the f ocus in 145 studies (68%), and approx. 50% of these studies were based on clinical populations. Non -
experimental, correlational (vs. experimental) study designs were used in 55% of the BDD studies.  
Discussion: The results on the research activity in the f ield of body representation and BDD as well as further results on 
BDD specific distortions in body representations will be discussed with regard to their implications for future research and 
treatment approaches.  
 
Exploring the relations hip between social media use and body dysmorphic symptoms in young people  
Monica  Gupta , King's College London , UK; Amita  Jassi , South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust , UK; 
Georgina  Krebs , University College London , UK  
Background: Social media us e (SMU) is now rife amongst young people and has been associated with negative mental 
health outcomes, including depression and poor body image. The relationship between social media and body dysmorphic 
disorder is yet to be explored.  Method: 209 16 -18 ye ar olds from London completed an online survey measuring body 
dysmorphic symptoms, frequency of SMU, type of SMU (active or passive), motivations for SMU (appearance -based, 
popularity, connection or values and interests), perfectionism, and anxiety and dep ression symptoms. Results: higher 
frequency of SMU was significantly associated with higher BDD symptoms but only with image -based and mixed -media 
social media platforms. Appearance -based motivation for SMU was the only motivation uniquely associated with BDD 
symptoms. Active SMU was significantly associated with increased BDD symptoms only when controlling for age, gender, 
ethnicity and anxiety and depression symptoms. Passive SMU was only significantly associated with BDD symptoms when 
no other variables were controlled for. Neither self -oriented, nor socially -prescribed perfectionism moderated the 
relationship between type of SMU and BDD. Exploratory analysis did not find a longitudinal association between frequency 
of SMU and BDD. Conclusions: Image -related SMU is associated with increased BDD symptoms. The direction of effect 
remains unknown. Implications for future research are discussed.

 Existent adult literature supports a li nk between Adverse Childhood Events (ACE) (including abuse, neglect, teasing and 
bullying) and the development of BDD and its symptomatology. Yet, little data is available on ACE among children and 
adolescents and whether these early experiences are more c ommon in pediatric BDD than in related disorders, such as 
obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD). Little is also known about the clinical profile of youth with BDD with vs without a 
history of ACE, though there is some evidence to suggest that childhood traum a may be associated with more severe and 
complex presentations among adult BDD sufferers. The aim of this study is to examine the type and rates of ACE in a 
pediatric BDD sample compared to OCD, as well as the clinical correlates of young people with BDD w ith a history of ACE.   
 Participants will include youths (aged 12 to 17 years) with a primary diagnosis of BDD (n=50) and OCD (n=50) who were 
consecutively referred to the National and Specialist OCD, BDD & Related Disorders Clinic at the Maudsley Hospita l in 
London. Data on child - and parent -reported ACE,  socio -demographic (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity) and clinical 
characteristics (e.g. symptom severity) will be systematically extracted from electronic clinical records.  
The preliminary results of this s tudy will be presented and discussed in terms of clinical implications and future research.   
 
Internet -delivered cognitive -behaviour therapy for adolescents with body dysmorphic disorder: a feasibility 
trial

Institutet , Sweden  
Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a prevalent and impairing condition that can be effectively treated with cognitive -
behaviour therapy (CBT). How ever, CBT for BDD is a highly specialised treatment and most adolescents do not have access 
to it. Internet -delivered CBT (ICBT) can be a way to increase the availability of effective psychological treatments. No study 
to date has evaluated the feasibility  of ICBT for adolescent BDD, but the experience in adults with BDD treated with ICBT is 
encouraging. The primary aim of this open trial is to measure feasibility and safety of the intervention. The secondary aim 
is to measure its preliminary efficacy.   
A total of 20 participants aged 12 -17 years and meeting DSM -5 criteria for a diagnosis of BDD will be recruited nationally. 
Treatment will be delivered from the OCD and Related Disorders Clinic for Children and Adolescents at the Stockholm 
region (Sweden). P articipants will be offered 12 modules of therapist guided ICBT for BDD over a period of 14 weeks. This 
treatment is based on a previously evaluated face -to-face CBT protocol which mainly includes psychoeducation, exposure 
with response prevention, and rel apse prevention strategies. Feasibility will be measured based on rates of participant 
retention, treatment completion and adherence to treatment content, treatment acceptability, treatment credibility, 
treatment satisfaction, and adverse events during the  treatment at post -treatment. Preliminary efficacy will be measured 
by using the Yale -Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, modified for BDD, adolescent version (BDD -YBOCS -A) and the rate of 
treatment responders at post -treatment and at the 3 -month follow -up. Secondary outcome measures will include self -
reported BDD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and functional impairment.   
In this talk, the feasibility and preliminary efficacy results of the pilot study will be presented up to the 3 -month follow -up. 
Future pl ans to perform a fully powered randomized controlled trial of the ICBT intervention for adolescent BDD will be 
described.  
 
Phenomenology and treatment outcomes in pediatric Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) and Autism

Institutet, Sweden ; David  Mataix -Cols, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden ; Georgina  Krebs , University College 
London, UK   
Treatment for pediatric Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is starting to gain focus in research. Outcomes  for Cognitive 
Behavior Therapy (CBT) have previously been found to be modest (Mataix -Cols et al., 2015) and are improving as CBT 
packages develop (Rautio et al., 2022).  As with OCD, enhanced packages of treatment may be warranted for those with 
comorbid Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) given the high rates of comorbidity and potential compromised outcomes to 
standard packages of CBT. In order to understand the need for augmented packages of CBT, comparing the 
phenomenology and treatment outcomes between t hose with and without ASD is a helpful endeavor. Young people 
consecutively referred to one of two national specialist services for BDD in London and Stockholm with a primary diagnosis 
of BDD were included in the study. 145 young people without ASD and 27 with ASD aged 10 -19 years old were compared 
on clinician measures of BDD symptom severity, insight, and functional impairment and self -report measures of depression 
and BDD at baseline. Mixed -effect regression models for repeated measures were used to exam ine differences in

72 
 
 
 treatment outcomes between the groups at end of treatment and three -month follow -up points on primary measures of 
BDD severity and secondary measures e.g. depression. The clinical implications of the findings are discussed considering 
the strengths and limitations of this study.  
 
Implementation of Mindfulness and Acceptance -based Therapies for psychosis: Lessons learned and 
future  directions  
Chair: Lyn Ellett, University of Southampton, UK  
 
Sussex Voices Clinic: bridging the gap between mindfulness research and clinical practice  
Mark  Hayward , Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust , UK 
Introduction : There can be a cavernous gap between the generation of research evidence and the implementation of this 
evidence in routine clinical practice. The Sussex Voices Clinic (SVC) was developed to bridge this gap! After conducting a 
trial of Person Based Cognitive Therapy groups for distressing voices in the context of psychosis (the ‘M4V’ trial), we 
created SVC as a clinical service to offer these groups to patients within the NHS.  
Method : Data were collected from 95 patients with varying dia gnoses who attended one of thirteen PBCT groups offered 
by SVC within routine clinical practice. Analyses were conducted to explore levels of engagement and clinical outcomes, 
together with associated predictors. Findings were compared with those generated  from the M4V trial.  
Results : Fifty -nine per cent of patients completed group PBCT within SVC, compared with 72% within M4V. There were 
significant improvements in voice -related distress (Cohen’s d = –0.47; p = 0.001), subjective recovery (Cohen’s d = 0.35 ; p = 
0.001) and depression (Cohen’s d = –0.20; p = 0.044); these outcomes were comparable to M4V. Higher baseline subjective 
recovery and lower depression both predicted improvement in voice -related distress. Therapy within SVC cost an average 
of £214 per  patient.  
Discussion : This study demonstrates that PBCT groups can be delivered trans -diagnostically in routine clinical practice to 
patients distressed by hearing voices, with the amount of benefit comparable to that generated in a research environment. 
In order to optimize the use of resources, attention should be paid to baseline levels of depression and subjective recovery, 
as they have the potential to influence engagement and outcomes,  
respectively. The costs for PBCT groups are relatively low and so this therapy offers a potentially cost -effective intervention 
for a group of patients who may otherwise make extensive use of high -cost clinical services.

Introduction : There is growing evidence for the benefit of mindfulness -based interventions (MBI) for people with 
psychosis.  However, research is yet to evaluate the clinical benefit of delivering MBI groups online.  We examine 
engag ement, clinical outcomes, participant experience and therapeutic process of delivering therapy groups online in 
routine clinical practice.  
Methods : The study used an uncontrolled pre -post design to examine engagement, therapeutic benefits (depression, 
anxiety, beliefs about voices) and group process in a 12 -session online mindfulness group for individuals with a 
schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis with current distressing voices.  Qualitative data on participant experience of online 
group therapy were analysed  using Thematic Analysis.  
Results : 17/21 participants completed one of three consecutively run therapy groups.  The majority of the sample (88%) 
attended between nine and 12 therapy sessions.  For completers there were significant reductions pre -post in d epression, 
anxiety, beliefs about voices and voice -related negative affect, with medium to large effect sizes.  Qualitative analysis of 
participant feedback identified three themes: ‘experience of online delivery’, ‘therapeutic benefits’ and ‘feeling conne cted 
to people in the group’.   
Discussion : Findings in relation to engagement, clinical benefits, participant experience and group process offer 
encouragement that online delivery of mindfulness for psychosis groups may be a useful addition to mental heal th services 
for people with distressing voices.  Limitations of the study and clinical implications will be discussed.

Lessons learned when implementing ACT for psychosis in a routine inpatient hospital setting: Find ings from 
a pilot RCT  
Brandon  Gaudiano , Brown University , USA ; Stacy  Ellenberg , Brown University , USA   
Acceptance and commitment therapy for psychosis (ACTp) has been shown in previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
to be efficacious for reducing rehospitalizations when delivered to psychiatric inpatients. However, uptake of ACTp has 
been limited in routine practice due to lack of staff time and training and the traditionally medical -focused nature of these 
environments.  We will review lessons learned from conducting a pilot RCT that assessed the effectiveness of ACTp when 
implemented o n an acute care psychiatric inpatient unit using routine hospital staff.  ACTp was found to be feasible to 
implement in this setting and acceptable to both staff and patients, with results showing reduced patient rehospitalizations 
following discharge. Suc cesses, challenges, and lingering questions regarding ACTp implementation will be discussed.

“Look at the Person not the Illness”: Consumers’ Experiences of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy 
Groups Supporting Psychosis Recovery  
Lauren  Kirkwood , La Trobe University, Australia ; Eric Morris , La Trobe University, Australia ; John  Farhall , La 
Trobe University, Australia   
Introduction : Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been demonstrated as an effective intervention for 
psychosis (Jansen et al., 2020), yet the re is little research examining the lived experience and perspectives of consumers 
engaged in ACT. This study explored participants’ experiences of ACT groups promoting recovery from psychosis offered in 
Australian public mental health services (Recovery A CT: based on the manual by O’Donoghue et al., 2018), including helpful 
and unhelpful aspects and reflections related to personal recovery. Recovery ACT engages 6 -12 service users with 
psychosis in seven weekly group sessions, plus a booster session one mo nth later. The intervention aims to increase 
psychological flexibility through brief mindfulness exercises, experiential exercises, key metaphors and values work (Johns 
et al., 2016; Jolley et al., 2020).  
Method : Participants were engaged in an interview a bout their experiences of Recovery ACT groups. A qualitative research 
methodology, thematic analysis, was used to explore themes across nine participants who attended groups in community 
mental health settings. These interviews were conducted as part of an  evaluation of Recovery ACT across mental health 
services in Melbourne, Australia.  
Results : Analysis of semi -structured interview transcripts identified four themes: interpersonal vulnerability, living beyond 
the illness, personal growth and recovering fr om psychosis. Participants shared that Recovery ACT could be interpersonally 
taxing, in drawing upon their own experiences along with the challenges of observing others’ discomfort. This could be 
particularly the case when engaged in experiential exercises  such as the “Passengers on the Bus”. All participants described 
the intervention as beneficial, particularly valuing the person -centred, inclusive nature of the group that contrasted to 
some individual’s past experiences of coercion, alienation, and stigm atisation.  
Discussion : Participants’ accounts appeared consistent with the ACT model and further understanding of consumers’ 
experience of group ACT for psychosis. Participants described aspects related to common factors of groups (connection, 
common huma nity), and that participating in Recovery ACT was socially demanding, associated with transformative 
experiences, and a sense of safety and respect. This study found and extended on themes identified in studies of individual 
(Bacon et al., 2014) and group ACT for psychosis (Bloy et al., 2021)

Tackling mood across depressive disorders

An exploratory analysis of the relationship of posting in peer online support forums and trait mood in 
bipolar disorder

Mental health (MH) peer online forums offer robust support where internet access is common, but healthcare is not, e.g., 
in low - and middle -income countries, rural areas, during pandemics. Despite their widespread use, little is known about 
when people post in such forums . The discussi on platform Reddit hosts forums (subreddits) for MH and non -MH topics. 
This exploratory study investigated how trait mood of Reddit users with a BD diagnosis who posted in MH subreddits 
differs from those who only posted in non -MH subreddits.  A logistic re gression distinguished Reddit users with a self -
reported BD diagnosis who did (n=10,662) vs. did not (n=3,790) post in MH subreddits. Predictors were anxiety, sadness, 
anger, and 1st person singular pronoun use, measured from all of users’ non -MH subreddit  posts via the LIWC text analysis 
tool, controlling for age, gender, active days, mean #posts/day.  The model was significant with 6.7% explained variance 
and 77.1% accuracy. MH subreddit posters were twice as likely female and exhibited 1.5 times more anxi ety and sadness. 
No other variables were associated with MH subreddit posters.  Our findings indicate that MH forums may reflect the views 
of people who experience more negative mood (outside of MH subreddits) compared to people who do not post in MH 
subred dits. This warrants to caution potential MH forum users that these spaces may overemphasise the difficulties of 
living with a MH condition and underrepresent those living relatively well.   
 
Talking about personal recovery in bipolar disorder: Integrating natural language processing, corpus

Personal  recovery (PR), ‘living a satisfying, hopeful life even with the limitations caused by the illness’ (Anthony, 1993) is of 
particular value in bipolar disorder (BD) where symptoms often persist despite treatment. Jagfeld et al. (2021) defined the 
first fram ework for PR in BD, POETIC (Purpose & meaning, Optimism & hope, Empowerment, Tensions, Identity, 
Connectedness), based on CHIME (Leamy et al., 2011). So far, PR has only been studied in researcher -constructed 
environments (interviews, focus groups). Suppor t forum posts can serve as complementary non -reactive data source.  
By integrating corpus and computational linguistics and health research methods, this study analysed public BD support 
forum posts in relation to the lived experience of PR. Comparing 4.4K PR-relevant posts by 2K users to 25K non -PR-relevant 
posts resulted in 130 significantly overused keywords. Keywords were coded according to the POETIC framework.  
Three domains featured most in PR -related discussions: Purpose & meaning (particularly parent ing, work), Connectedness 
(particularly romantic relationships, social support), Purpose & meaning (parenting, work), Empowerment (self -
management, personal responsibility).  This study is the first to analyse non -reactive data on PR in BD. Indicating the k ey 
areas that people focus on in PR when posting freely and the language they use, provides helpful starting points for 
therapists to collaboratively consider these issues with service users in clinical settings, such as recovery -oriented CBT.

 Introduction: App -based Behavioural Activation ( BA) may be effective at reducing depression in adults. However, lack of 
acceptability and engagement may reduce its effects. We used the person -based approach (PBA) to collect feedback from 
adults with depression to improve the acceptability and engagement  of an app -based BA intervention.  
Method: We recruited 16 adults with elevated depressive symptoms from the community. In study 1, nine participants 
took part in a think -aloud interview, providing feedback on the app. We tabulated findings and modified the  app using 
criteria for prioritising changes. In study 2, we interviewed seven participants about their experiences of using the modifie d 
app for two weeks. We also held two patient and public involvement meetings.  
Results: In study 1, participants identif ied two ‘must have’ changes, which we addressed. Specifically, participants were 
having problems planning and breaking down activities. In study 2, participants identified the following barriers: lacking 
visual engagement, tone and framing of the difficult y rating. Positives from both studies included: interface usability, 
having a clear rationale, examples of activities and progress and self -reflection features.  
Discussion: The PBA provided in -depth insight allowing us to make key modifications concerning  the acceptability and 
engagement of the app. We now plan to conduct a feasibility study to explore feasibility, acceptability, recruitment, 
retention and fidelity.   
 
Taming emotions with DBT -Skills – what really works for people with B ipolar -Disorder?

People with Bipolar disorder frequently experience mood swings between mood episodes, which affects their quality of 
life. Psychological interventions fr equently rely on large interval measurements that do not capture change and variance of 
emotions across time. We aimed to provide a detailed analysis of the variability in mood, variance and range of emotions 
across a 12 -weeks skills based DBT programme de signed for bipolar disorder (Bi -REAL –Respond Effectively&Live mindfully). 
We also to explore if emotional variance is associated with the use of more DBT skills, and which were more used to 
regulate.  
Method: 33 Participants diagnosed with bipolar disorder  were included in this study having been assessed at pre -
programme (T0) and then filled in a weekly mood and diary card, filled in weekly across 12 -weeks, while receiving a DBT 
skills intervention (4 groups ≈ 8). They were asked to rate their mood and inte nsity of each emotion felt every week, along 
with sleep hours and medication compliance, while registering skills used across the 12 weeks. There is still a group of 
participants undergoing treatment.  
 We hope to see a decrease in emotions rated intensity and mood variance across the 12 -weeks, expecting a more 
effective regulation of people reporting the use of more skills while complying with medication. We also hope to report the 
most used skills within Bipolar Patients, while describing the adapted skill s considering the challenges associated with the 
disorder.   
 
The role of action -contingent expectancy biases in depression -linked behavioural inactivity  
Julie  Ji, University of Western Australia , Australia ; Colin  MacLeod , University of Western Australia , Australia  
Objective: Behavioural inactivity contributes to the development and maintenance of depression but remains poorly 
understood. Whether people choose to engage in an activity or not is influenced by what they expect might happen as a 
result of doing so (obje ctive outcome expectancies) as well as how they might feel as a result of such outcomes (subjective 
emotional impact expectancies). This study tested hypothesis concerning the presence of depression -linked negative 
biases in both types of expectancies.  
Method: Using a novel laboratory paradigm, N = 176 undergraduate students were provided with the opportunity to 
decide whether or not to play a coin -tossing game, where playing could result in wining or losing money for a charity of 
their choice. Following  activity engagement decision -making, participants reported on their expected objective outcome 
(win/lose) of gameplay, as well as expected subjective emotional impact of such outcomes.  
Result: Mediation analysis results provide support for the hypothesis  that individuals with higher depression vulnerability 
are more likely to exhibit behavioural inactivity due to higher negative action -contingent expectancy biases, reflecting 
negative biases in both expected objective outcome and subjective emotional impa ct.  
Discussion: Negative biases in two conceptually independent variants of action -contingent expectancies may be 
contributing to depression -linked behavioural inactivity.

How does parental psychosis impact children and families, and what interventions have been designed to 
help?  
Jessica  Radley , University of Oxford , UK; Jane  Barlow , University of Oxford , UK; Louise  Johns , University of 
Oxford , UK 
Introduction : Experiencing psychotic symptoms while managing parenting tasks can have a negative impact on these 
parents and on their children. The symptoms of psychosis, and any hospitalisations following a psychotic episode, can 
render a parent both emotionally and ph ysically unavailable to their child. There has been little research to date examining 
the consequences of parental psychosis from a whole family perspective. This study investigates families where a parent 
has experienced an episode of psychosis and compar es and contrasts the family members’ perspectives using qualitative 
methods.  
Methods : Parents with psychosis who had a child aged between three and eleven in a UK NHS Trust were invited to take 
part in the study. Semi -structured interviews were conducted with these parents, with their child (if older than 8 years old), 
and with their family members. Data were analysed using multi -perspectival interpretive phenomenological analysis (m -
IPA).  
Results : Five families took part comprising of five parents, four children, and three family members (two partners, and one 
grandmother). Two families described themselves as White British, two as Black British, and in one family the father was 
Black British and the mother was White British. Four themes were identified u sing m -IPA: 1) parental psychosis impacts the 
whole family, 2) psychosis and parental identity, 3) parental psychosis as a source of secrecy, and 4) psychosis impacts 
some families more: the role of fractured families and mental health knowledge.  
Discussi on: Psychosis had a negative impact on all family members, which led to a loss of identity for the parent and 
secrecy between family members. As a consequence, more work is needed to support these families to explain psychosis 
to the children. These result s will be contextualised alongside findings from a scoping review which highlighted that many 
interventions for parents with mental illness aim to improve family communication, for example ‘Family Talk’ or ‘Let’s Talk 
about Children’. Although these interv entions were originally designed for parents with affective symptoms, more recently 
they have been trialled with parents with any kind of mental health difficulty, including parental psychosis.  
 
Anxiety disorders in offspring of parents with mood disorders - Risks of disorders and parenting experiences

Introduction: Offspring of parents with mood disorders are at higher risk for anxiety disorders (ADs) - potential risk factors 
of mood disorders in their later life. Proper interventions on ADs may improve well -being a nd prevent mental illness 
progression in this at -risk population. With the increase in treatment options for different ADs, a meta -analysis aims to 
differentiate the risks of AD subtypes in the offspring of parents with mood disorders compared with control  offspring. 
Furthermore, to better understand the parents’ needs, another meta -analysis investigates parenting experiences in the 
context of parental bipolar disorder. Method: The first meta -analysis searched for original articles published in peer -
reviewe d journals with offspring exposed to parental mood disorders and control offspring, and rates of ADs in offspring 
using validated diagnostic interview tools. A random -effects meta -analysis was used to pool the risk ratios (RRs) of 
different offspring ADs. Moreover, sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses and meta -regression examined factors that 
explain the between -study heterogeneity. The second meta -analysis focused on qualitative views of any reporters on 
parenting experiences related to offspring up to 18 years. The findings were collected with the meta -aggregation approach.  
Result: The first meta -analysis included 36 papers from 62,094 records. Offspring of parents with mood disorders had 
higher risks for all subtypes of ADs, especially for panic disord er (PD). Parental BD puts offspring at increased risk for 
separation anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder. In contrast, the psychopathology of control parents decreases their 
RRs. The second meta -analysis yielded themes that emerged from the analytic process, which described different 
reporters’ views on subjective feelings, subjective feelings, challenges, and resources of parenting experiences.  
Discussion: The first study indicates the AD subtypes and participant characteristics that should be emphas ised when 
treating offspring of parents with mood disorders. The second study provides guidance to address unique parental 
challenges and resources for parents with BD. The meta -analytic outcomes provide us insights to find new ways to help 
parents in help ing their children with anxiety.

Introduction. Children o f anxious parents are at high risk of anxiety disorders themselves – approximately twice the risk of 
typical children, according to a recent systematic review. The evidence suggests that this transmission is accounted for 
largely by environmental rather th an genetic factors, which opens up opportunities to intervene to prevent such 
transmission. In particular, there is evidence that supporting parenting in those with mental health difficulties can 
ameliorate the risk of their children developing mental heal th difficulties. Therefore, the objective of this study was to test 
the feasibility of a new one -session, group -based, preventive parenting intervention for parents with anxiety disorders.  
Methods. One hundred parents with anxiety disorders, recruited from  adult mental health services in England (and their 
children aged 3 -9 years) were randomised to receive the new intervention (a one -day, group workshop), or to receive 
treatment as usual. Children’s anxiety disorders and anxiety symptoms were followed up t o 12 -months by outcome 
assessors who were blind to group allocation. Analyses were conducted on an intention to treat basis, as far as possible.  
Results. 51 participants were randomized to the intervention condition and 49 to the control condition and 82% and 80% 
of these were followed to 12 -months, respectively. The intervention was reported as highly acceptable to parents who 
received it. The results show that the intervention and RCT were feasible and 12 -month follow -up attrition rates were low. 
Children  whose parents were in the intervention condition were 16% less likely to have an anxiety disorder at 12 -month 
follow -up than those in the control group. No adverse events were reported.  
Conclusions. An inexpensive, light -touch, psycho -educational intervention may be useful in breaking the intergenerational 
cycle of transmission of anxiety disorders. A substantive trial is warranted.  
 
Therapist guided, parent -led, CBT for preadolescent children with OCD

Introduction: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) often begins during preadolescent years (Geller et al., 1997) and can 
continue into adulthood if treatment i s not provided (Micali et al., 2010). Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) including 
Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is the gold standard psychological treatment for children with OCD, however, 
limited numbers of mental health professionals are train ed to deliver this approach (Stallard et al., 2007) and services often 
have substantial waitlists for treatment (O’Neill & Feusner, 2015). Delivering treatment via parents may help to increase 
access to CBT for preadolescent children with OCD, as parent -led treatments have been shown to be effective and cost -
effective for children with anxiety disorders (Creswell et al., 2020). This presentation will present the results of a 
preliminary evaluation of a parent -led CBT treatment for preadolescent children (ag ed 5 - to 12 -year -old) with OCD.  
Method: A non -concurrent multiple baseline approach was used and consisted of a no -treatment baseline phase and a 
treatment phase. Ten families of preadolescent children with OCD were randomised to a 3 -, 4-, or 5 -week basel ine phase 
before receiving 6 - to 8- individual treatment sessions. Parents (and children) completed semi -structured diagnostic 
interviews prior to the baseline phase, within one -week of completing treatment, and one -month after completing the 
treatment. We ekly parent -reported questionnaires measuring children’s OCD, family accommodation, and parents’ 
knowledge/confidence to help their child were collected. Parents’ acceptability of the treatment was assessed 
quantitatively and qualitatively.   
Results: Visu al analyses of parent -reported questionnaires will be presented, alongside clinically significant and reliable 
change indices for diagnostic and questionnaire measures. The percentage of children who met criteria for “clinical 
response” and “clinical remis sion” on diagnostic measures will be reported, alongside data on treatment acceptability.  
Discussion: This study provides preliminary evidence that parent -led CBT may be an effective way to help increase access 
to psychological treatments for preadolescen t children with OCD. Our outcomes were in line with the UK’s Improving

78 
 
 
 Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) initiative (Clark, 2018) and the treatment was acceptable to participating parents. 
Further, more rigorous, evaluation of this treatment is need ed.

The experience of OCD goes hand in hand with social isolation &loneliness (SI/L).However, the nature of this experience in 
recovery from OCD & its potential role in relapse is under researched. Method Participants (N=23)were &gt;18 years, met 
OCD diagnostic criteria, identified experiencing improvement/recovery in their OCD followed by a relapse. Participants 
provided demographic information, com pleted symptom questionnaires took part in a telephone interview, which was 
analysed using Reflexive Thematic Analysis. Results As individual’s OCD symptoms increased, their lives became more 
insular,& experiences of SI/L increased. Undertaking CBT was rep orted as useful for treating OCD symptoms. However, 
rarely addressed associated systemic difficulties, including a lack of social connection, how this was linked to low mood & 
how to begin to tackle this. As recovery increased, the dearth in social connect ion became more apparent, &experiences of 
SI/L, more salient. An inability to build social connections with others who “understand OCD” was identified as a 
contributing factor to relapse. Participants reported that when they had been able to build social c onnections this had 
supported their recovery. Conclusions It is important to address(re)learning how to build social connection, both during the 
course of therapy & post therapy. A post therapy intervention focused on relapse prevention is more likely to b e beneficial 
if provided in small group format with others recovering from OCD.  
 
The Mediating Role of Cognitive Processes in Explaining the Relationship Between Disgust Propensity and 
OCD Symptom Domains

A body of research underlines the role of disgust in obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD) as it pertains to contamination 
fear (Olatunji & al., 2017). Yet, less attention has been devoted to disgust across other OCD symptoms. Further, little is 
known about the cognitive processes accounting for the relationship between disgust and OCD symptoms. This study 
aimed to systematically examine potential cognitive mechanisms mediating the association between disgust and various 
OCD symptom domains using parallel mediation analyses. A total of 149 undergraduate participants completed the Disgust 
Scale, the Vancouver Obsessional Compulsive Inventory (VOCI), the VOCI –Mental Contamination, the Obsessive Be liefs 
Questionnaire, the Contamination Sensitivity Scale and the Contamination Thought -Action Fusion Scale. While 
contamination -related beliefs were significant mediators of the association between disgust and contamination fear 
(indirect effect β coeffici ents = .06 -.17), further cognitive mediators emerged for other OCD symptom domains. Notably, 
importance of/need to control thoughts mediated the relationship between disgust and repugnant obsessions (indirect 
effect β coefficient = .14). These findings sug gest that the experience of disgust in OCD also translates to symptoms other 
than contamination fear, and that both emotional and cognitive aspects are relevant. These results shed light on potential 
cognitive interventions to use in the treatment of disgu st across OCD symptom domains.

Introduction: Comprehensive cognitive -behavioural treatments for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have been 
developed over the past three decades. These treatments have produced encouraging results; however, t hey appear to be 
less efficacious than treatments for other anxiety disorders. The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to test a new 
highly focused treatment for adults with GAD: Behavioral Experiments for Intolerance of Uncertainty. Method: A tota l of 60 
participants (51 women, 9 men) with a primary diagnosis of GAD were randomized to either treatment or wait -list control. 
In the 12 -week treatment condition, participants learned to use behavioral experiments to test their catastrophic beliefs 
about  uncertainty. We conducted assessments at pre -, mid - and post -condition, and at 6 - and 12 -month follow -up. The 
primary outcome was the severity of GAD, and secondary outcomes were worry, depression, somatic anxiety, and

79 
 
 
 intolerance of uncertainty. Results:  (1) The treatment group was superior to the wait -list group in terms of change from 
pre- to post -test on all outcomes. (2) The combined sample (once wait -listed participants received treatment) showed 
large and significant decreases on all outcomes. (3) T reatment gains were either maintained or increased over the 12 -
month follow -up. Discussion: The new treatment appears to be a promising treatment option for adults with GAD 
considering that it may be as efficacious as more complex treatments for GAD.   
 
Beliefs about losing control and other OCD -related cognitions: An experimental investigation  
Andrea  Sandstrom , Concordia University, Canada ; Adam  Radomsky , Concordia University, Canada  
Cognitive theories of Obsessive -Compulsive Disorder (OCD) suggest that dysfunctional beliefs lead to the de velopment of 
symptoms. One novel belief domain which may influence OCD is beliefs about losing control. Indeed, these beliefs are 
associated with OCD symptoms; however, the relationship between these beliefs and other OCD phenomena, including 
other relevan t dysfunctional beliefs, is unclear. This study (pre -registration: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/MT738) 
aimed to examine the relationships between beliefs about losing control and OCD -relevant appraisals (responsibility, 
threat, and control). Currently, 67 (out of a projected 158) participants have completed the experimental protocol, in 
which they received false (positive or negative) feedback regarding the likelihood they may lose control and read a series of  
vignettes describing hypothetical scenarios relevant to OCD concerns (checking, harm) which were used to measure 
appraisals. The experimental manipulation was effective at influencing beliefs about losing control, t(65)=3.03, p=0.002. 
Those who received negative (vs. positive) feedback had significa ntly higher ratings of threat, t(65)=1.72, p=0.045, and 
responsibility, t(65)=1.70, p=0.047, but not control, t(65)=0.03, p=0.488, in checking scenarios. No differences were 
observed between conditions in harm scenarios. The full set of findings will be re ported on the completed sample. 
Theoretical and clinical implications and future directions will be discussed.   
 
Perspectives on the causes, consequences and experience of losing control  
Kenneth  Kelly -Turner , Concordia University, Canada ; Adam S.  Radomsky , Concordia U niversity, Canada  
Clinical accounts, cognitive theory and experimental research have indicated that beliefs about losing control are not only 
common, but a potential causal and/or maintaining factor in disorders such as panic disord er, social anxiety disorder and 
obsessive -compulsive disorder. However, beliefs about the causes, consequences and importance of control are not 
limited to clinical populations. Understanding sub - and non -clinical beliefs about losing control can help to i nform our 
clinical definition of the phenomenon, delineate what aspects of beliefs about control are normative and identify how 
these beliefs might become problematic. The present study employs thematic analysis to identify common beliefs about 
losing cont rol from n = 7 out of a projected 21 undergraduate students. Preliminary themes include that the process of 
losing control is emotionally laden, successful and productive people maintain control and that losing control is linked to 
powerlessness and aggres sion. These themes are preliminary and may be revised in light of additional data collection and 
analysis. These results offer important insight into what is common among clinical and non -clinical beliefs about losing 
control and inform how these beliefs m ight be worth targeting in cognitive and behavioural interventions.

Introduction: Globally, the COVID -19 pandemic has created an interpersonally threatening context within which other 
people have become a possible source of threat.  The term 'pandemic paranoia' has been coined to refer to paranoid 
cognitions that focus specifically on the threat posed by others to oneself because of the pandemic.  In this stud y, we 
report on the development of a new measure of pandemic paranoia and examine international prevalence in a general 
population sample.  
Method: A cross -sectional online survey design was employed, with 2,510 participants from five international sites.  
Participants completed a range of measures online, including general paranoid thinking (Revised Green Paranoid Thoughts 
Scale), depression and anxiety (DASS -21), and the Pandemic Paranoia Scale (PPS), a questionnaire designed to measure 
pandemic -specific p aranoid thinking.     
Results: Psychometric properties of the PPS supports the factorial stability, construct validity, and internal reliability of  the 
scale.  The overall prevalence rate of pandemic paranoia was 19% and data across the five international sites will be 
presented.

80 
 
 
 Conclusions: The PPS is a reliable and valid measure of pandemic paranoia, and was found to be relatively common in a 
representative sample of the general population across five international sites.  Implications of the findings an d future 
directions will be discussed.

Pandemic paranoia, general paranoia, and their relationships with worry and beliefs about self/others – a 
multi -site latent class analysis

Introduction : During the COVID -19 pandemic, an increase in paranoid thinking has been reported internationally. The 
development of the Pandemic Paranoia Scale (PPS) has provided  a reliable assessment of various facets of pandemic 
paranoia. This study aimed to (i) identify classes of individuals with varying levels of general paranoia and pandemic 
paranoia, and (ii) examine associations between classification and worry, core belie fs, and pro -health behaviours.  
Method : An international sample of adults (N = 2510) across five sites completed the Revised -Green Paranoid Thoughts 
Scale and the PPS. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted using these two paranoia variables. Classes were compared on 
trait worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire), beliefs about self/others (Brief Core Schema Scales), and pro -health 
behaviour.  
Results : Three latent classes emerged: Class 1 with low R -GPTS and PPS scores, Class 2 with a high R -GPTS  score and a 
moderate PPS score, and Class 3 with high R -GPTS and PPS scores. Compared to Class 1, Classes 2 -3 were associated with 
more worry and negative self - and other -beliefs. Class 3 was further characterised by greater positive -self beliefs and less  
engagement in pro -health behaviours. Engagement in pro -health behaviours was positively correlated with interpersonal 
mistrust and negatively correlated with paranoid conspiracy and persecutory threat.  
Discussion : Individuals with a general paranoia tende ncy were more likely to respond to the global health threats in a 
suspicious and distrusting way. Our findings suggested that worry and negative self/other beliefs may contribute to not just 
general paranoia but also pandemic paranoia. The preliminary find ing of a link between pro -health behaviours and 
interpersonal mistrust warrants further examination.

Background: Minority group status is associated with increased risk of experiencing symptoms of psychosis, with some 
studies highlighting paranoia in particular. The factors that help to explain this association in the general population are not 
well understood. We report on the cross -sectional association between minority group status and paranoia and the 
potential role of views about the self and others (positive and negative), social rank and/or social support.  
Methods: A cross -sectional on line survey design was employed (Feb – March 2021). The sample consisted of 2,510 
participants from five international sites: United Kingdom (n=512), United States (n=535), Germany (n=516), Hong Kong 
(n=445) and Australia (n=502), stratified based on sex, age and educational attainment. Participants provided demographic 
information, and completed a range of measures online, including minority group status (across multiple categories – 
ethnicity, physical disability, sexual orientation, religious beliefs and  visible physical feature), paranoid thinking, core beliefs 
about the self and others, perceived social support and perceived social rank.   
Results: Consistent with previous research, minority group status was associated with higher levels of paranoia, an d overall 
associations held across sites. Examining the impact of intersecting aspects of difference, paranoia systematically increased  
with the increasing number of minority groups that an individual identified as belonging to. The ways in which views abo ut 
the self and others (positive and negative), social rank and/or perceived social support influenced this association will be 
explored.

81 
 
 
 Conclusions: Paranoia is more prevalent in individuals who identify as belonging to a minority group. It is imperati ve that 
we seek to understand this better. Views about the self and others (positive and negative), social rank and/or perceived 
social support help to understand some of this association, but more longitudinal research is required.    
 
Paranoia, conspiracy and trust processes in the context of COVID19: a multinational study  
Anton  Martinez , University of Sheffield , UK; Richard  Bentall , University of Sheffield , UK  
Paranoia and conspiracy are terms typically used interchangeably when referring to suspiciousness of other people’s 
intentions or the veracity of sociohistorical events (e.g. , moon landing). However, although the underlying content of these 
types of beliefs might be similar (e.g., seeing others as powerful and threatening), recent research suggests that these 
constructs differ in important ways. One important feature shared by  both constructs is excessive mistrust but this aspect 
might play different roles in each belief system. In this study, we explored the strength of associations of different trust 
predictors (i.e., trust in institutions, trust in sources of information, pe rceptual trust, and interpersonal trust) between 
conspiracy mentality and paranoid beliefs measured during the first wave of the COVID19 pandemic. We tested this 
association in a large representative multinational sample (UK n=2025; Spain n= 1951; and Irel and n= 1041). Confirmatory 
factor analysis supported a two -factor model of conspiracy and paranoid beliefs in each nation sample. Path and equality 
of constraints analysis revealed that paranoia was more strongly associated with perceptual mistrust (bias t owards 
mistrusting unfamiliar faces) whereas conspiracy was more strongly associated with mistrust in political institutions. 
Although interpersonal mistrust and trust in informal sources of information were associated significantly with conspiracy 
their a ssociation with paranoid beliefs was stronger. These findings provide consistent evidence across different countries 
supporting the view that during threatening times (i.e., a global pandemic) mistrust processes play different roles for each 
belief system.  Furthermore, in the U.K. sample, we will further present ongoing analyses of paranoia trajectories over the 
lifetime of the pandemic (early 2020 to early 2022). Study limitations and implications will be discussed.

Feasibility, acceptability, and clinical benefit of a trauma -focused stabilisation group for post -traumatic 
stress disorder patient s with complex presentations on primary care wait lists  
Michelle  Wells , Plymouth Options and College of Life and Environmental Sciences (CLES), Psychology, University 
of Exeter , UK; Rachel  Handley , College of Life and Environmental Sciences (CLES), Psychology, University of 
Exeter , UK; Anke  Karl, College of Life and Environmental Sciences (CLES), Psychology, University of Exeter , UK  
Routinely large numbers of people presenting with complex presentations of PTSD  in IAPT services require multi -faceted 
and extended NICE recommended treatment approaches. This can lead to longer waits for therapy potentially prolonging 
patient suffering. In an effort to minimise this suffering, we evaluated whether a newly developed trauma -focused 
stabilisation group, can offer an acceptable, feasible and clinically beneficial intervention to service users waiting for on e-
to-one trauma therapy.  Fifty -eight patients with PTSD, waiting for trauma -focussed individual treatment were inclu ded in 
the study. Six groups, lasting five sessions, were run by 2 therapists. Thirty -eight patients completed the study. To ascertain 
the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, both quantitative and qualitative data were extracted from a Patie nt 
Experience Questionnaire. The stabilisation group was found to be feasible and acceptable. Clinical benefit was assessed by 
determining the reliable change index for measures of PTSD, depression and anxiety from pre -to-post -treatment for each 
patient. O verall PTSD symptom reduction was medium -to-large with Cohen’s d of .77 for intent -to-treat and 1.05 for per 
protocol analyses. Additionally, for depression and anxiety there was no symptom deterioration.  The study provided 
preliminary evidence for the acc eptability and clinical benefit of attending psychoeducational group therapy to service 
users whilst waiting for one -to-one trauma therapy.

 Objectives: Identify research priorities relevant to health and social care needs of adults with lived experience of recent 
and/or historical sexual violence/abuse (i.e., ‘survivors’).  
Participants: Adult survivors were consulted, alon gside health and social care professionals who support survivors across 
public, voluntary, and social enterprise sectors.  
Methods: Participants completed a survey to propose research questions relevant to the needs of survivors. Questions 
unanswered by cu rrent evidence were identified, and a second survey was shared to identify respondents’ priorities from 
these. Uncertainties prioritised through the second survey were presented at a consensus meeting to agree the top 10.  
Results: 223 participants provide d 484 suggested uncertainties. 75 questions unanswered by existing research were 
identified, and later ranked by 343 participants. A consensus meeting with 31 stakeholders examined the top -ranking 
priorities from the second survey and agreed the top 10. Th ese included support valued by survivors, how to best support 
BAME and LGBTQ+ survivors, improving access to high -quality psychological therapies such as trauma -focused CBT, and 
how physical and mental health services can become ‘trauma informed’.  
Conclus ions: The research priorities identify gaps in existing evidence to better support adult survivors of sexual 
violence/abuse. Further work in these areas, including access to high -quality psychological therapies, should be prioritised.   
 
Augmenting treatment for post -traumatic stress disorder with a computerised cognitive bias modification 
procedure targeting appraisals (CBM -App): Results of a randomised controlled trial  
Marcella  Woud , Mental Health Research and Treatment Center, Faculty of Psychology, Ruhr -Universität 
Bochum, Bochum, Germany  
Introduction: Dysfunctional appraisals about traumatic event s are a key mechanism in post -traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD). Experimental studies have shown that computerised cognitive trainings, cognitive bias modification for appraisals 
(CBM -APP), can modify dysfunctional appraisals and reduce analogue trauma symp toms. The present study tested whether 
CBM -APP could reduce dysfunctional appraisals in PTSD patients, and whether this would lead to improvements in PTSD 
symptoms.  
Methods: We compared CBM -APP to sham -training in a parallel -arm proof -of-principle double -blind RCT amongst 80 PTSD 
patients admitted to an inpatient clinic. Both arms comprised 8 training sessions over a 2 -week period and were completed 
as add -on to treatment as usual.  
Results: In intention -to-treat analyses, participants receiving CBM -APP sho wed a greater reduction in dysfunctional 
appraisals from pre to post -training (primary outcome), compared to those receiving sham training, with between -group 
differences also found on the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI) and the PTSD Checklist fo r DSM -5 (PCL -5). 
Reductions in dysfunctional appraisals correlated with reductions on the PTCI, PCL -5, and hair cortisol concentration from 
pre- to post -training.  
Discussion: Results support dysfunctional appraisals as a modifiable cognitive mechanism, an d that their proximal 
modification reduces PTSD symptoms. These results could open new avenues for improving present therapies.

List 25 psychologists whose work you intend to ignore, and justify your choice': A tribute to Stanley 
'Jack' Rachman  
Chair: Roz Shafran , Univeristy College London, Great Ormond Street  Institute of Child Health , UK 
Speakers: Bill Yule , Kings College London, UK;  Adam ; Radomsky , Concordia University , Canada ; Paul  Salkovskis , 
Oxford University , UK; David  Clark , Oxford University , UK 
The title of this tribute is taken from a humorous exam paper that Professor Stanley 'Jack' Rachman set his students one 
year. Jack sadly passed away in September 2021. His contribution to the development of behaviour therapy and, lat er, 
cognitive behaviour therapy has been enormous and across multiple areas. He is truly a foundational father of CBT. His 
expertise included obsessive compulsive disorder, fear and courage, behavioural medicine, anxiety and emotional 
processing. As editor  of 'Behaviour Research and Therapy', he shaped our field by publishing new ideas that ran counter to 
thinking at the time. He was committed to sharing his expertise with early career researchers and greatly admired the IAPT 
initiative to which he contribu ted in its early days. Jack's humour, originality, creativity, depth and breadth were legendary 
and his influence has been profound. This discussion will begin with some specific recollections of Jack and his influence on  
the field by individual panel memb ers. It will then open the floor for the audience to share their recollections and to pay a 
personal tribute .

 What do we mean by CBT these days and do we really have any sensible working definitions of the 
boundaries of this therapy?  
Chair:  Andrew  Beck , Bradford Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust , UK 
Speakers: Liz Ruth  University of Bradford , UK, Jess; Kingston , Royal Holloway University , UK; Peter  Phiri , 
Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust , UK; Shirley  Reynolds , University of Readin g, UK  
The term CBT has expanded to include a wide range of therapeutic approaches and traditions, from the Behavioural 
Approaches that laid the foundation of the therapy, to the Cognitive innovations that combined with these approaches 
make up the foundation of 2nd wave CBT as taught on IAPT courses, to Low Intensity short term treatments and long term 
treatments for complex and multiple traumas. Third wave approaches have led to a wider understanding of what change 
processes might take place in therapy, CBT with chi ldren has incorporated systemic and parenting based approaches and 
techniques as disparate as Motivational Interviewing and Mindfulness have all come under the broad umbrella terms of 
cognitive and behavioural therapies.  In addition cognitive and behaviour al approaches have now been adapted to provide 
effective and culturally informed treatments across most continents and language groups including areas as disparate as 
improving anti -retro viral adherence in HIV patients in Uganda, depressed rural women in Pakistan, obese patients in North 
America and treating Tics and Tourette’s Syndrome and has been delivered by Artificial Intelligence systems without any 
input from a human therapist. Given the breadth and depth of what CBT is and can do are we able to arr ive at a consensus 
regarding what exactly CBT is these days and what the boundaries are of this flexible and adaptive therapy?  This panel 
discussion with enable experts in disparate fields to make a 10 minute pitch as to their definition of CBT, to take qu estions 
from fellow panellists and audience members and through a process of elimination and votes managed through an online 
platform arrive at a definition that will almost certainly please no one.  Once a date for the panel has been set we will 
additional ly invite keynotes at the conference on that day to contribute to the panel.  
Questions to prompt panel members may include:  
How much linguistic and culturally specific adaption can happen and something still be CBT?  
What 3rd wave approaches are a good fit with CBT and which may not be?  
Can you do good CBT and score badly on the CTS -R? 
What is the boundary between Low Intensity therapy and CBT?  
What would you say was definitely not CBT that therapists seem to do anyway?  
How useful is it to worry about this? And who should do the worrying?  
When we say 'fidelity to the model' which model do we mean?  
 
When CBT meets CDI: How do we meaningfully address issues of culture, diversity, and inclusion in 
the training and supervision of psychological therapists?  
Chair: Majella  Byrne , King's College, London  
Speakers:  Juliana  Onwumere , King's College, UK; Susanna  Payne  King's College London , Anthony ; Taylor , Expert 
by Experience ; Margo  Ononaiye , University of Southampton , UK; Leila  Lawton , South London & Maudsley NHS 
Foundation , UK 
The importance of culture, diversity, and inclusion (CDI) is increasingly acknowledged in conversations about access to 
training programmes for psychological therapists. These discussions form part of a much broader drive to int roduce 
greater diversity in the socio -demography of psychological therapists, particularly in terms of racial and ethnic minoritized 
backgrounds, and to ensure the workforce reflects local communities and improves access to underserved groups. Thus, 
initia tives designed to identify and reduce inequities and structural barriers to successfully securing a place on a training 
course in under -represented groups continues to receive much of our attention. These developments are taking place 
against a backdrop of  events including global social movements (e.g., ‘Black Lives Matters’); and government scandals (e.g., 
Windrush), enquiries (e.g., Grenfell]) and commissioned reports on racial inequality (e.g., Commission on Race and Ethnic 
Disparities), and ongoing deba tes about inclusion, terminology, and rights (e.g., sexual and gender minorities). However, to 
what extent U.K. training programmes for psychological therapists meaningfully address CDI as part of their CBT training, 
practice placements, supervision struct ures, and assessed competences remains less clear. Yet the importance of these 
areas for the service user experience and their outcomes cannot be overestimated and, moreover, is typically overlooked 
as part of the discourse on these issues.  Our panel, comp rising those with lived experience and course leads from IAPT, 
clinical psychology doctoral training, and placement supervisors will debate how far the ideal and vision for promoting and 
integrating CDI and CDI competences development into CBT therapist tr aining experiences are translatable, 
implementable, and observable. A consideration of the key issues and challenges of addressing CDI in all aspects of the 
training experience, and ideas about helpful pathways forward will be discussed.

 Is this as good a s it’s going to get —have we reached the “efficacy ceiling” in CBT for depression?  
Chair: Jon Wheatley, Homerton Healthcare NHS Trust, UK  
Speakers: Barney; Dunn, University of Exeter, UK; Stephen Barton, Newcastle University, UK; Shirley Reynolds, 
CBT Reach , UK; Willem Kuyken, University of Oxford, UK  
This panel discussion brings together leading experts in depression research and treatment to discuss the current status of 
CBT for depression. After 40 -50 years developing theory and practice, are we getting b etter outcomes or have we reached 
an efficacy ceiling? Experts will include perspectives on Beckian CBT, complex depression, anhedonia, mindfulness as well 
as child and adolescent depression.  
 
 What role should CBT and BABCP play in responding to the climate and biodiversity crises?  
Chair: Amanda  Cole , Private Practice, UK  
Speakers: Elizabeth  Marks , University of Bath , UK; Marc  Williams , University of Cardiff , UK 
Climate change is arguably the biggest threat that society and the world faces. And as  m embers of BABCP we are all 
concerned with wellbeing. Should we, as evidence based practitioners, be addressing the emotional impacts of climate 
change in our clients in the face of real world threat? Is there more that as psychotherapists we can do to faci litate  
behaviour change in individuals, organisations and society to mitigate the effects of climate  change? Is there more that 
BABCP can do to help us in this endeavour, in line with our mission and strategic aims.  Please come along to this debate if 
you are curious, concerned or sceptical. We are aiming, like our partner health professionals, to put climate change on our 
agenda, to raise questions like those above, and consider ways in which we can use our existing knowledge,  and emerging 
research to greater benefit for all.  Marc Williams will place the panel in context and review the evidence for the impact of  
climate change and related factors on mental health and wellbeing. He will consider how mental health pra ctitioners could 
and should be responding, and describe actions being taken by other professional bodies. Liz Marks will elaborate on the 
direct and indirect therapeutic work that CBT practitioners, supervisors and researchers could play in working with th e 
mental health impacts of climate change, from the individual level to considerations of public health. She will discuss the 
moral implications of action versus inaction in the face of catastrophic climate change. Amanda Cole will explore the 
possibilitie s for the role of professional bodies in leading on, and supporting their members in responding to the climate 
crisis. This will include issues such as declaring a climate emergency to supporting members who engage in protest and 
non-violent direct action.   
 
CBT in Action: Responding to the war in Ukraine

Trust, UK  
The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and ensuing war has created a hu manitarian crisis and led to a large number of 
Ukrainians fleeing the country as refugees. Such forced migration has numerous and complex effects on individuals and 
their families, added to by possible experience of traumatic events resulting from the war and during flight from the 
country itself. CBT and the broader research and clinical community within which CBT is situated has great potential to 
provide benefits for people affected by the war in Ukraine, not only via provision of psychological therapy t o refugees who 
have fled the country, but also via training of psychologists across Europe to be able to offer adequate and tailored 
psychological interventions and support, and more broadly by informing local and national responses and the relevant 
policy . This panel therefore brings together experts with a wealth of experience across different areas of responding to the 
needs of refugees, psychological trauma, and the downstream effects of humanitarian crises such as that presented by the 
current war. Tog ether they will address the question of what CBT can offer in the context of the war in Ukraine.

Low intensity CBT interventions for children, young people and families have formed a central component of recent mental 
health investment and service transformation in England. The launch of the Wellbeing Practitioner for Children and Young 
People (CWP) i n 2017 and Education Mental Health Practitioners (EMHP) in 2019 have contributed to a significant 
expansion inon low intensity practice within CYP, community and education settings.  These specialist LI CBT roles are 
aimed to significantly expand workforce  capacity and improve access to high quality evidenced based early intervention for 
young people and their families.  Specifically targeting the needs of those who do not currently receive a service, the CWP 
roles are integrated into community mental healt h provision and the EMHPs in education settings (via Mental Health 
Support Teams), providing interventions for the most common low -level mental health difficulties of anxiety, depression 
and behavioural difficulties. In the, relatively, short time that the se programmes have been running they have shown to be 
highly effective and, as such, have expanded into new MH conditions with the workforce structure expanding to meet the 
needs of this valuable workforce.  This clinical round table discussion will explain  and ‘set the scene’ for the ethos/remit of 
LI CBT and new workforce developments. Using current clinical service dilemmas and real case challenges, the panel will 
discuss the pros and cons of expanding a workforce at such a ‘blistering’ pace, looking at h ow services and LI CBT 
interventions are implemented, and service structures developed.  The panel will explore themes around the treatment 
gap; complexity of cases and therefore demands on the service while maintaining the early intervention ethos. The pan el 
will also reflect on findings of widening access survey, with current students, to represent CYP populations discussing 
potentially problematic trends in the demographics of those joining the psychological professionals network and how these 
trends can be addressed. Finally, the panel will reflect on career progression and development needs, including 
accreditation and registration and new roles, to support the sustainability of these new low intensity roles.

While we have had a strong evidence base for  the treatment for anxiety for almost 50 years, there is room for 
improvement in outcomes and in increasing the accessibility and availability of treatment. There are an increasing number 
of treatments that differ in their understanding of “how therapy wor ks”, especially at the process level. While there are 
common features at structural levels, the specific interventions may differ in the rationale, shared understanding, specific 
focus, and treatment strategies.  This clinical round table brings together pr actitioners with training/research experience in 
specific approaches to reflect on how the therapist’s approach and their behaviour in therapy leads to the co -construction 
of a space where clients can explore, experience, and “try out” different ways of re sponding and behaving.

 Perspectives on CBT training: What can we learn from the past as we head into the future?  
Chair: Sarah Corrie, BABCP, UK  
Speakers: Stirling Moorey, London, UK ; Karina Lovell, University of Manchester , UK;  Isaac Marks, London, UK ; 
Helen Macdonald, BABCP, UK  
Training in CBT has evolved considerably since its early days and much has been achieved. For some years now the BABCP 
has set standards and accredited courses throughout the UK and Ireland and offers a range of levels and types of 
accreditation as practice has evolved to meet the needs of diverse client groups. Yet, significant chall enges lie ahead. The 
consequences of a global pandemic, climate change, economic crisis, inequality and now the war in the Ukraine all have 
implications for the nation’s mental health and therefore, the knowledge and skills needed of the CBT workforce. How  do 
we train people optimally to respond to the challenges of such a rapidly changing world? What have we learned from how 
we have delivered training in the past that might equip us for the future? This Clinical Roundtable explores where we have 
come from,  where we are headed and how best we can deliver CBT training for the workforces of the future . 
 
Clinical skills classes  
Working with interpreters - a skills workshop  
Matthew  Wilcockson , Coventry University and Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust , UK 
 
Scientific background:  In the UK, 138,000 people speak no English (or Welsh) at all, with a further 726,000 speaking “some 
English” (ONS 2011) probably at a level inadequate for therapy, particularly in communicating subtleties and asserting 
one’s rights (Boyles and Talbot 2017). According to government guidance, they should be offered an interpreter. Therapy 
seeking rates are low in non English speaking communities, with lack of cultural understanding, lack of service flexibility, 
and practical iss ues (e.g. negotiating public transport) cited as examples. The lack of effectiveness of translingual therapy 
(Griner and smith 2007), may be due to therapist inexperience in using interpreters, and interpreter inexperience.  
Interpreter’s training is limite d and their employment is often based on availability rather than any assessed skill, and there 
are limited standards for assessing the interpreting quality, although this is starting to change in the public sector. 
Interpreters receive no formal training in mental health and they both hear and speak distressing information with no 
training in self -care skills, with 83% reporting vicarious trauma. In a session, the CBT therapist has to manage cultural 
perspectives and expectations in a client s/he is unable  to directly understand, and manage and support a professional 
typically with limited understanding of mental health, and manage their reactions to complex dynamics without cultural or 
linguistic understanding (e.g. Resera, Tribe and Lane 2015).  
 
Learning Objectives: By the end of the workshop, students will be able to:  
 1. Know how to brief and debrief interpreters.  
 2. Be able to describe good interpreting practice.  
 3. Be able to recognise examples of dilemmas in the therapeuic interpreting milieau and  describe ways for the therapist to 
manage them  
 4. Observe part of an interpreted session and reflect on good and bad practice.

Cue exposure for binge -eating in eating disorders: What to do when our conventional approaches to 
bingeing are just not working?  
Glenn  Waller , University of Sheffield , UK 
 
Scientific background:  In treating eating disorders, it is essential to ensure that the patient has overcome their binge -
eating behaviour by the end of therapy, as residual binge -eating is a risk factor for relapse. The most powerful trigger of 
such binges is starvation -based craving, while most remaining binges are emotionally triggered. Each of these mechanisms 
is well -managed by existing evidence -based CBT -ED protocols, if they are applied appropriately. However, even when using 
those protocols, it is not uncommon for the patient to have occasional binges that do not seem to be related to either 
starvation or emotional triggers. Patients often describe these as ‘habit’, where they cannot identify any reason for eating 
in that way. These binges are usually the result of cue learning (Pavlovian conditioning), and require an approach that is 
based on exposure, but that is very different other forms of exposure in eating disorders. That approach is ‘cue exposure’,

87 
 
 
 which is w idely used in the field of the addictions, but which has been largely forgotten since it was first reported in the 
field of eating disorders over 20 years ago. This Skills Class will address the specific skills needed to use cue exposure wh en 
working with residual binges in CBT for eating disorders.  
 
Learning Objectives:  
1. Explain the rationale behind cue learning and reactivity,  
2. Explain how to implement cue exposure  
3. Demonstrate the techniques involved in cue exposure, using video demonstration and  experiential exercises.

How to combine empathy and confrontation to navigate therapeutic ruptures  with difficult clients  
Ruth  McCutcheon , Academy of Schema Therapy , UK; Saskia  Ohlin , Academy of Schema Therapy , UK 
 
Scientific background:  The therapeutic alliance is not just a byproduct of therapy, but can be seen as a vehicle of change in 
therapy. Rupt ures in the therapeutic process can be used in a beneficial way to bring about an opportunity to heal from 
and reduce maladaptive interpersonal patterns (Schenk et al, 2020).  
 The therapeutic alliance is not just a byproduct of therapy, but can be seen as a vehicle of change in therapy. Ruptures in 
the therapeutic process can be used in a beneficial way to bring about an opportunity to reduce maladaptive interpersonal 
patterns (Schenk et al, 2020). Aspland et al (2008) noted that the ability to respond well  to ruptures is an important clinical 
skill. One of the specific clinical skills to tackle ruptures in therapy developed by Jeffrey Young is ‘empathic confrontatio n’, 
whereby the therapist confronts the client regarding their maladaptive behaviour but does  so in an empathetic way. This 
approach can show compassion and understanding for the off -putting behaviour, and at the same time set limits (Young, 
2003).  
 
Learning Objectives: This skills class is aimed at teaching CBT practitioners how to use empathic c onfrontation. It will 
provide an opportunity for CBT practitioners to learn how to:  
 1. Identify a relevant difficult interpersonal behaviour from the client.  
 2. Harness empathy in moments of rupture, making sense of personal reactions rather than becoming defensive.  
 3. Hold the client accountable for their difficult behaviour by giving feedback empathically  
 4. Use techniques to ground the client to pause and r eflect, rather than becoming stuck in repeated destructive relational 
patterns  
 5. Identify aspects of their own experience to provide a corrective experience for the client

Enhancing therapist and client commitment to exposure treatment with values and the therapeutic 
alliance.  
Jim Lucas , Openforwards , UK 
 
Scientific background:  Higher rates of experiential avoidance mediate the effects of anxiety -related distress (Kashdan, 
Barrios, Forsyth & Steger, 2006), and exposure treatments are a powerful intervention (Olatunji, Cisler & Deaco n, 2010).  
Many therapists either refrain from implementing exposure treatments or apply them too cautiously due to inaccurate 
perceptions about their client’s capacity to tolerate emotions or higher levels of therapist anxiety sensitivity (Meyer et al ., 
2014 & Farrell et al., 2016). Consequently, too many anxiety sufferers fail to change their problematic relationships with 
anxiety, so they continue to suffer.  Therapists who practice psychological flexibility from the inside out learn to be less 
experientia lly avoidant (Luoma & Plumb Vilardaga, 2012). By bringing awareness to their fears, carrying their uncertainties 
forward and evoking attention to values, therapists can engage clients in exposure treatment faster. Furthermore,

88 
 
 
 therapists can use the therap eutic alliance to sustain a commitment to exposure treatment by taking a contextual view 
that all people are capable and whole.  In this skills class, attendees will apply psychological flexibility to treatment tasks. 
With a specific emphasis on valuing, de legates will learn to use an experiential method to explore values in the context of 
fearing and avoiding exposure treatment.  
 
Learning Objectives:  
1. Describe how psychological flexibility practices can help therapists implement exposure treatments more effectively.  
2. Apply a method for engaging with values to enhance commitments to exposure treatment.  
3. Embody a contextual view of human beings to sustain commitments to undermine fear -avoidance patterns and nurture 
flexible responding practices.

Cognitive Therapy for Moral Injury in PTSD  
Hannah  Murray , Oxford Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma, University of Oxford ; Sharif  El-Leithy , 
Traumatic Stress Service, London  
 
Scientific background:  Moral injury is the profound psychological distress that can arise after perpetrating, failing to 
prevent, or w itnessing events that transgress an individual’s moral or ethical code. Moral injury is not a mental disorder, 
but it can arise alongside, or contribute to developing PTSD as well as other mental health problems (Williamson et al., 
2018).  Moral injury has been primarily studied in military populations, but is increasingly recognised amongst other 
professional groups including healthcare workers affected by the pandemic, as well as survivors of accidents, crime, state -
sponsored violence and terrorist attacks . It can arise from experiences as diverse as accidentally killing someone in a car 
accident, betraying a friend under torture, journalists reporting on mass -casualty disasters, doctors who missed a serious 
illness, sexual assault survivors who did not rep ort a serial perpetrator and emergency workers who felt let down or 
betrayed by their leaders during a major incident.  In this class, we will describe how to address moral injury when it arises 
alongside PTSD. Based on existing evidence -based models, we di scuss how to apply the cognitive model of PTSD (Ehlers, & 
Clark, 2000) to formulate moral injury reactions and how to adapt key cognitive, experiential and memory -focused 
techniques derived from cognitive therapy for PTSD, as well as treatments for moral i njury such as adaptive disclosure 
(Gray et al., 2012) to effectively treat the problem.  
 
Learning Objectives: Following the skills class, participants will be able to:  
1. Understand the concept of moral injury and who might be affected  
2. Apply the cognitive model of PTSD to clients presenting with moral injury and PTSD  
3. Adapt cognitive, experiential and memory -focused techniques to address moral injury presentations

Three Ways to Change Your Mind: a framework for cognitive restructuring  
Stirling  Moorey , London, UK  
 
Scientif ic background:  The philosophy underpinning CBT has not been investigated in any detail. This workshop, although 
very practical, draws on philosophy of science concepts, more specifically the epistemological assumptions behind

89 
 
 
 cognitive techniques. Different types of cognitive therapy and different cognitive techniques refer to truth from different 
perspectives: rational and empirical, pragmatic and constructivist positions. Understanding this can help us choose which 
techniques to use in  particular situations.  
 
Learning Objectives:  
1. To have an understanding of how different schools of CBT (e.g. Beckian, REBT, meta cognitive therapy and constructivist 
CBT) refer to the truth in different ways.  
2. To be aware of the three different persp ectives underpinning cognitive techniques: the rational -empiricist model, the 
pragmatic model and the constructivist model.  
3. To be able to select interventions on the basis of the client's receptivity e.g. at any given time a client may be resista nt to 
the idea their thoughts are distorted (rational -empiricist model) but willing to consider that they may be unhelpful 
(pragmatist model).

Behavioural Int erventions for Working with Couples  
Dan Kolubinski , London South Bank University ; Marion  Cuddy , South London and Maudsely NHS Trust , UK 
 
Scientific background:  Cognitive -Behavioural Couple Therapy (CBCT) is an efficacious approach to treating relationship 
distress. Operating from the CBT principles that encouraging changes in behaviour and perspective can impact a couple's 
sense of closeness and emotional response towards each other, CBCT places considerable impact on encouraging positive 
recip rocity and communication -skill-building. According to a meta -analysis by Shadish and Baldwin (2003), couple therapy 
demonstrated an effect size of .84 compared with no treatment and these effects were still noticeable during 5 -year 
follow -ups. 
 
Learning Ob jectives: The event will aim to provide participants with the opportunity to practice interventions to enact 
positive changes in a couple’s interaction pattern. Through role play demonstrations and guided exercises the workshop 
will focus on developing and  consolidating skills in both guided behaviour exchange and communication skills training.

Open Science – Why should I care, and how do I get started?  
Pamela  Jacobsen , University of Bath , UK; Kate  Button , University of Bath , UK 
 
Scientific background:  CBT is an evidence -based intervention, and the development of both the theoretical and applied 
research base, is a vital part of continually improving clinical outcomes. Recently, there has been growing awareness of the 
so-called ‘reproducibility crisis’ across all areas of science, including psycholog y. The reproducibility crisis refers to the 
failure to replicate the findings of many scientific studies. This may arise from the employment of questionable research 
practices, such as ‘p -hacking’ (conducting many statistical tests, and only reporting sign ificant results), HARKING 
(hypothesising after the results are known), and outcome switching (promoting secondary outcomes to primary outcomes 
to fit unexpected results). Open Science practices, which encourage open methodology (including pre -registration of 
hypotheses and outcomes), open data (in a publicly accessible repository), and open access to publication (including pre -
prints), are vital to combatting these. There is increasing interest in how Open Science practices can be applied to mental 
health r esearch, including consideration of challenges which can arise, such as how to share data safely and appropriately.

90 
 
 
 Learning Objectives:  
1. Be familiar with some key questionable research practises and how to guard against them  
2. Understand common open science practices and why they are important  
3. Know how to embed open science practises throughout the lifecycle of a project  
4. Understand different options for making data, materials, analysis code, and publications open access

How to recognize, formulate and respond to supervisory drift  
Jason  Roscoe , University of Cum bria, UK 
 
Scientific background:  Experts in the field have produced guidance on the structuring of CBT Supervision (e.g. Beck, 1995; 
Gordon, 2012; Milne, 2017; Pretorius, 2006) yet previous surveys on everyday practices have consistently found that 
supervisors and supervisees appear to drift from these recommendations (Alfonsson et al., 2017; Townend et al., 2002; 
Weck et al., 2017: Younge & Campbell, 2013). These forms of supervision where key components are omitted may indicate 
supervisory drift (P ugh & Margetts, 2020). Little has been written specifically on drift within CBT supervision with a search 
of the electronic databases PsycARTICLES, Medline, CINAHL and Academic Search Complete using the terms ‘cognitive 
behavioural therapy’ and ‘supervisor y drift’ generating only one result. The author has developed a preliminary model of 
supervisory drift drawn from literature reviews of therapist schemas and therapist skill development and from the 
responses to previously undertaken research (Roscoe et al ., 2019; Roscoe 2021a). Whilst components of the model require 
empirical support, teaching supervisors and meta -supervisors how to spot, formulate and respond to signs of drift have 
been well received by practitioners to date (Roscoe, unpublished).  
 
Learni ng Objectives: By the end of the skills class, delegates will have gained knowledge and skills to be able to:  
1. Anticipate potential problems that may arise within the supervisory relationship which indicate supervisory drift  
2. Have an awareness of a range of tools that can be used to pre -empt and respond to drift  
3. Understand how their own therapist schemas influence their beliefs about supervision and behaviour as a supervisor or 
supervisee  
4. Apply bespoke formulation within supervision to help mak e sense of the origins and maintaining factors of certain 
beliefs and behaviours

The implementation of a digital skills -based CBT intervention for individuals with subthreshold 
Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) . 
Elea  Drews Windeck , University of Sussex , UK; Lindsay  Evans , Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust , UK  
This project evaluates a digital blended version of STEPPS -EI, a cognitive behavioural skills -based  group intervention for 
individuals with subthreshold BPD (Blum et al., 2014), using an eHealth platform and group sessions delivered remotely via 
Zoom. Two Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust primary care services implemented the intervention from Mar ch to 
July 2021. Primary feasibility outcome measures included service users’ attendance at group sessions and online module 
completion rates. Other measures included service users’ self -reported symptoms, system usability, and further 
quantitative and qua litative measures designed to shed light on the experience and opinions of service users and 
practitioners. Attendance rates were high, as 75% of service users attended at least 10 (from 13) sessions. Usability ratings  
revealed good gradings for Zoom from all participants, but lower gradings for the eHealth platform. Further analyses 
revealed a generally positive attitude towards digital STEPPS -EI and practical suggestions on how to improve the 
intervention. Bayesian analyses were conducted for symptom outc omes where available - none revealed evidence for an 
effect. Overall, the implementation of digital STEPPS -EI was feasible. The online delivery has the capacity to improve 
engagement with the intervention. However, incomplete self -report data and small sam ple sizes set limits to conclusions. 
More research on the effect of this intervention on symptom outcomes is planned.  
 
How well do Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Behavioural Activation (BA) for depression 
repair anhedonia? A secondary analysis of the COBRA randomised controlled trial .  
Batool  Alalsayednasser , University of Exeter, UK ; Emily  Widnall , University of Bristol, UK, UK ; Barnaby Dunn  
Dunn , University of Exeter, UK ; Kim Wright , University of Exeter, UK ; Fiona  Warren , University of Exeter, UK ; 
Heather  O’Mahen , University of Exeter, UK  
A secondary analysis of the COBRA randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine how well Cognitive Behavioural 
Therapy (CBT) and Behavioural Activation (BA) repair anhedonia. 440 pa tients with current major depressive disorder were 
randomized to receive BA or CBT, and anhedonia and depression outcomes were measured post -acute treatment (6 -
months) and at two further follow up intervals (12 - and 18 - months). Both CBT and BA led to sign ificant improvements in 
anhedonia from baseline to 6 -months, with no significant difference between treatments. Participants remained well 
above healthy population averages of anhedonia at the end of acute treatment (6 -months) and there was no further 
significant improvement in anhedonia at either 12 -month or 18 -month follow up. Baseline anhedonia severity predicted 
less marked repair of depression symptoms and fewer depression free days across the follow -up period. The extent of 
anhedonia repair was less m arked than the extent of depression repair across both treatment arms. These findings 
demonstrate that CBT and BA are similarly (only partially) effective in treating anhedonia, indicating that both therapies 
need to be further refined or that novel treatm ents need to be developed to better treat the anhedonia symptoms of 
depression.  
 
Treating skin -picking and trichotillomania in the context of maladaptive attachment: A case study .  
Anusha  Govender , South West London & St George's Mental Health NHS Trust , UK 
Skin-picking (SP)and trichotillomania or hairpulling (HP) are habit disorders usually treated effectively with habit reversal 
training (HRT). HRT is a standard treatment used routinely in primary care. However, a proportion of patients do not 
respond. Pr esentation: The patient is a 31 -year -old married and employed female with a diagnosis of habit disorders. 
Duration of SP =27 years; HP=11 years. SP: picking skin around fingernails; toenails; cuticles; also biting fingernails. HP: 
pulling hair from head. Q uestionnaires completed at baseline and end of treatment included The Massachusetts General 
Hospital (MGH) Hairpulling Scale and Skin Picking Scale. Formulation and interventions: SP began during infancy after 
developing insecure attachments leading to dys functional beliefs and difficulty regulating affect. HP developed during a 
stressful university exchange programme. Treatment focused on cognitive restructuring of core beliefs; emotional 
regulation strategies; developing constructive coping strategies; be havioural techniques included aspects of HRT. The 
patient refused pharmacological treatment. Outcome: The patient reframed belief systems, coping strategies and 
tolerance of emotion. Measures of HP and SP reduced to mild levels of severity from moderate/se vere at baseline. 
Discussion: Cognitive techniques and exploring early attachment may be beneficial to overcoming obstacles to treatment 
with HRT. Further research is required into development of habit disorders.

 Understanding barriers to accessing psycho therapy, and the potential of CBT to address these: A 
qualitative study of Sunni Muslims in Saudi Arabia and in the United Kingdom . 
Hind  AlHarbi , University of Exeter , UK; Paul  Farrand , University of Exeter , UK; Ken Laidlaw , University of Exeter , 
UK 
Introduction : Previous research has highlighted several barriers that prevent members of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic 
communities from accessing evidence -based psychological therapies such as CBT. However, little research has focussed 
specifically on b arriers experienced by the Muslim population or regarding the acceptability of CBT.  Methods: A purposive 
sampling method was used to recruit 23 Sunni Muslim participants (10 London, 13 Riyadh) Semi -structured interviews 
were conducted with thematic analysi s and disconfirming case analysis undertaken. Results: Four main barriers levels 
(Individual, Islamic, Cultural, Provider) emerged with respect to accessing CBT for Sunni Muslims in Riyadh and London. 
Differences in these barriers emerged between the parti cipants. Sunni Muslim participants resident in London were 
divided into two groups, general refusal of psychological treatment, seeking Islamic treatment, while the other group 
accepting CBT whilst insisting on integrating it with teachings from Islam prov ided by a Muslim therapist. Participants in 
Riyadh, either accepted treatment using CBT but wanted to combine it with Islamic treatment. The second group, it 
rejected Islamic treatment, and insisted that psychological treatment be pure without any Islamic guidance.Discussion: 
Cultural adaptation must be treated with caution in Islamic communities, because even within the same Islamic sect there 
are differences that lead to different acceptance of CBT among Muslims.  
 
Impact of metacognitions and brooding in patients with anxiety disorders: more symptoms and 
decreased quality of life .  
Beatriz  Rueda , National University of Distance Education, Spain ; Esperanza  Valls , Actur Sur Mental Health 
Center, Spain  
Introduction: Metacognitions and brooding are maladaptive  cognitive strategies related to more symptoms in people with 
anxiety disorders (AD). The aims of this study were to examine the association between metacognitions, brooding, anxious 
symptoms (AS) and depressive symptoms (DS) and emotional quality of life (EQoL) in patients with AD; and to determine 
how brooding and metacognitions contributed to the prediction of symptoms and EQoL. Method: Fifty -six patients 
participated in the study. All of them were diagnosed of some AD and were selected prior to beginnin g cognitive -behavior 
therapy. They completed the Metacognitions Questionnaire -30, the Ruminative Response Scale, the Beck Depression 
Inventory, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and the SF -36 Health Survey. Results: Brooding was positively associated with 
cognitive self -consciousness, negative beliefs about uncontrollability of thoughts (metacognition 4) and need to control 
thoughts (metacognition 5). All these metacognitions and brooding also positively correlated with symptoms. EQoL was 
negatively associa ted with brooding and metacognitions 4 and 5. Moreover the metacognition 4 was the only significant 
predictor of more AS and decreased EQoL, whereas brooding was the only predictor of more DS. Discussion: Findings 
indicated that brooding was significantly related to more DS in patients with AD and the metacognition 4 seemed to have 
an important role in the impairment of their emotional functioning.

Introduction : Core outcome sets are defined as an agreed, standardised collection of outcomes which should be measured 
and reported, as a minimum, in all trials for a specific clinical area. Use of core outcome sets improves evidence synthes is 
across different trials and ensures that the views of service users and carers are represented in trial outcomes.  
Aim: To develop a Core Outcome Set (COS) for psychological therapy trials conducted in acute mental health inpatient 
services. Method : 1. To conduct a systematic review of existing literature and consult with key stakeholders, using an 
online survey and semi -structured interviews, to develop a long list of possible outcomes. 2. To use Delphi methodology to 
generate consensus and refine the lo nglist into a shortlist of outcomes.  3. To finalise the outcome list at a consensus 
meeting.To include all ‘experts’ and ensure everyone has equal contribution study participants will include service users, 
informal carers, healthcare professionals, resear chers/trialists, and end users of research. Results : The final Core Outcome 
Set will be posted on the COMET website (http://www.comet -initiative.org/) which includes a publicly searchable database 
to promote uptake by clinical trialists and other intended end-users . Discussion : Development and implementation of core 
outcomes sets facilitates the synthesis and interpretation across different trials, which is important for developing 
evidence -based clinical guidelines.

 Anxiety and depression are common, with  CBT the main modality in Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) 
services. This study examined the effectiveness of Anxiety UK’s CBT, hypnotherapy and counselling services. Delivery 
methods (telephone, face -to-face, blended and online via webc am) were examined whilst comparing outcomes against 
NHS IAPT data. Outcome data (pre -post changes in depression and anxiety assessed via validated outcome measures: 
GAD7 and PHQ9) for clients completing therapy, n = 957; n = 427 CBT, n = 136; hypnotherapy;  n = 375 counselling, 
between April 2019 - March 2020 were analysed. Recovery, reliable improvement, and reliable recovery rates for clients 
completing at least two sessions, exceeded IAPT targets. CBT yielded the greatest change in anxiety followed by 
hypnotherapy and counselling. Post -hoc tests indicated a significant difference between CBT and counselling (95% CI −1.85 
- −0.46, p = .002) with CBT yielding the greatest reduction in anxiety scores. Changes in depression scores were similar 
across CBT, hypn otherapy and counselling (one -way ANOVA: F(2, 935) = 0.72, p = .49). The more sessions attended, the 
greater the change in anxiety and depression scores with similar score reductions across therapy delivery mode.  
 Treatment gaps exist for those with anxiety. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of a charity’s therapy services. As 
outcomes were unaffected by delivery method, this has relevance in terms of accessibility.

Introduction: For patients with Long Covid, NICE guidance 2020 suggests a comprehensive clinica l assessment alongside 
referral to rehabilitation and psychological services where appropriate. We aimed to describe and categorise UK healthcare 
pathways post -hospital discharge for COVID -19 as a first step towards understanding clinical and cost -effectiv eness.  
Methods: Hospital sites taking part in the PHOSP -COVID study (www.phosp.org) were surveyed. The online survey topics 
included availability of proactive follow -up, patient access, involvement of multidisciplinary and specialty teams, 
investigations, and access to rehab and psychological services. Data was recorded on JISC. The classification of services was  
co-produced by patients, clinicians, and policy makers at a consensus event. Results: 45/64 (70%) hospitals completed the 
survey a nd 37/45 had a proactive follow -up service. Figure 1 shows a summary of hospital site categorisation by 
assessment quadrant and level of mental health service provision.  Discussion: In the UK, there is heterogeneity in patient 
access and intensity of asses sment services available post -hospitalisation for survivors of Covid -19. At site level, the 
intensity of assessment provided did not fully map to the intensity of psychological service provision.

Introduction: Depression is the leading cause of disability globally, necessitating investigations of the mechanisms 
underlying its onset and maintenance (WHO, 2017). Deficits in working memory (WM) an d increased recall of negative 
relative to positive information have been associated with depression (LeMoult & Gotlib, 2019). However, less is known 
about the extent to which this differs in social vs non -social contexts. This study examines whether WM ca pacity varies by 
context (social vs non -social) and by depressive symptoms, and whether valence (positive vs negative) influences 
performance. To do this, we designed a novel network memory task (NMT). Method: The NMT comprises 3 conditions: 
social -self, n etworks including the participant; social -other, networks not including the participant, and non -social, 
networks of flights between cities. Within each condition, participants see 12 networks displaying the relationships 
between 3 -4 people (social) or fli ght paths between 3 -4 cities (non -social) and identify whether 3 individual associations 
from each network are positive or negative. Data collection is not yet completed. Hypotheses: (1) Individuals will more 
accurately and quickly classify social vs non -social associations; this effect will be highest in the social -self condition. (2) 
Individuals with higher depressive symptoms will classify negative vs positive associations more accurately and quickly; this  
effect will be greater in the social vs non -social conditions.

Introduction: People experience spontaneous, involuntary, mental imagery frequently in daily life, and dysfunctions in such 
imagery are associated with a range of psychological d isorders. However, there is little direct evidence as to its underlying 
mechanisms in the context of psychopathology. Hence, the current study developed and tested an innovative method to 
experimentally induce positive and negative involuntary imagery, and  by doing so test its effects directly.  Method: We 
recruited an unselected sample for a lab -based study. Participants generated mental images or sentences in response to 
ambiguous pictures with positive or negative captions in a within -subjects design. The y then completed lab -based tasks 
designed to trigger involuntary memories of the previously -generated images or sentences, and assess their impact on 
mood and cognitions. The study was pre -registered on the open science framework ( https://tinyurl.com/4fkwm96j ). 
Results: The new paradigm can successfully induce positive and negative mental imagery, and can be used to investigate 
the effects in a controlled laboratory setting.  Discussion: The new paradigm provides a method to better understand 
(dysfunctional) involuntary imagery and its potential underlying mechanisms in disorders such as depression and anxiety. 
Further, if it can be extended to also induce involuntary imagery in daily life, this could open up a num ber of possibilities 
for clinical applications.

Repetitive Negative Thinking (RNT) is a cognitive process characterized by repetitiveness, intrusiveness and difficulties to 
disengage (Ehring 2011) which has been associated with burnout (Garratt -Reed et al. 2018), affecting negatively more than 
40% of medical and health students. Recent studies highlighted the role of RNT in Bu rnout, thus contributing to Emotional 
Exhaustion (EE; Cunha et al. 2022). Self -kindness has been associated with less burnout and self -judgment has been 
associated with the opposite (Durkin et al. 2016). The current study examines whether self -kindness can  serve as a 
potential moderator between RNT and EE mediated by self -judgment.  720 Portuguese medicine (72.4%), dentistry (15.3%) 
and other health related (12.4%) students (of which 81.4% girls) with a mean age of 21.61 (±6.87), answered an online 
survey in cluding the Portuguese validated versions of PTQ -15, Self -Compassion Scale/SCS, DASS -21 and MBI -SS. PROCESS 
was used to test the hypothesized model.  The model explained 25% of emotional exhaustion, and self -judgment mediates 
the association between RNT and  EE. Also, self -kindness moderates this mediation. Even though RNT is a predictor of EE, 
self-judgment seems to mediate this relationship is buffered when patients have some level of self -kindness. Our findings 
suggest the training of self -kindness might b e helpful to decrease the contribution of negative cognitive processes to 
burnout in students from health -related courses.

Background: Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) is a dispositional construct addressing an individual’s relationship with 
uncertainty that arose within the context of Generalized Anxiety Disorder in the 1990’s. The aims of the study are to chart 
the rise and spread of res earch into intolerance of uncertainty from its initial context of GAD in the early nineties, to its 
potential role in other mental health conditions and then into other areas including physical health, medical training and 
tourism. Specifically, this poste r uses bibliometric data to establish citation rates of different types of sources (including 
open access) and the spread into journals into different areas.  Method: A single data base Scopus was used. All citations 
with a publication date in 2021 or earli er were included. Results. Up until the end of 2021, 1998 sources were retrieved. 
There have been year -by-year increases and an accelerating citation rate from 50 per year by 2010, 100 by 2015, 150 by 
2018 and reaching 400 in 2021. When grouped on journal title and coverage, the earliest and largest groups were C/BT

95 
 
 
 journals and those addressing psychopathology while later on health -related journals, those addressing 
neurodevelopmental disorders, and experimental science have appeared.  Discussion. The first  part of this study tracks the 
accelerating rise in interest in the construct and starts to track the spread in topic areas in IU research.

Background: In the second part of this study, bibliometric data is used to track the geographical spread of research and 
international collaboration.  Method: Based on author names and affiliations recorded in the citation data, the data was 
analyzed as a function of authors with multiple citations, and as a function of co -occurrence of authors and of countries.  
Results. Authors from 71 different countries were identified. Based on countries with 10 or more citation s, the earliest and 
most strongly represented countries were USA, UK, Canada, and Australia. These were followed by an increasing 
contribution from Western and Southern Europe from 2000, with the first studies from Western and Eastern Asia from 
2010. Now a ll regions of Europe and Asia are represented as well as South America. Patterns of international collaboration 
show strong relationships between the four initial countries, but increasingly international collaborations involving 
researchers from most cont inents and regions.  Discussion. The study tracks the rise and spread from predominantly 
English -speaking countries and then across regions of Europe, Asia, and South America. Other regions including the African 
content remain under -represented. Although th e construct arose in a Western context, there is increasing interest from 
across the globe, some of which is facilitated by international and intercontinental collaboration.

Oxford University Hospital UK  
A large number of research trials have examined the effectiveness of psycholo gical therapies for chronic pain, and a key 
research priority is to now identify how these interventions work. This systematic review sought to summarise the current 
evidence base for mechanisms of change in psychological therapies for chronic pain, by exa mining what proportion of trials 
included in the latest Cochrane review report change mechanisms, and evaluate how these conclusions are reached. 
Eligibility criteria consisted of any primary or secondary paper included in the recent Cochrane review that e xplored 
mechanisms of therapeutic change using mediator analyses. One primary paper and seven secondary papers met criteria, 
and findings were summarised and evaluated using a narrative synthesis approach. A wide range of mechanisms were 
identified, and al though the synthesis indicated that there is evidence to support the mediating role of pain beliefs (in 
particular pain catastrophizing), the lack of methodological rigour in trial design and analyses meant that there was not 
sufficient evidence to draw fi rm conclusions about the profile of mechanisms and their universality across psychological 
therapies. Suggestions for future research are provided to highlight the next steps chronic pain research can take in order 
to further understand these underlying ch ange processes.

Third wave parenting and autism: developing digital co -facilitated supports .  
Lisa Emerson , University of Canterbury, New Zealand ; Laurie  McLay , University of Canterbury, New Zealand  
Parents of children on the autism spectrum face unique challenges, and are known to experience heightened levels of 
parenting stress. However, these parents often face barriers in accessing support and current parenting programmes rarely 
address parents’ own wellbeing needs. Across two studies, we aim to develop and evaluate digital third wave parenting 
programmes, co -facilitated by a practitioner and a parent. Study 1: a single -case research design will determine the 
feasibility, social validity and effects an online Mindful Parenti ng programme for parents of Autistic adolescents. Study 2: a 
three -arm randomised controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of an online Acceptance and Commitment Therapy 
for parents of young children on the autism spectrum. Both programmes include s elf-directed online modules, with 
fortnightly group support sessions co -facilitated by a trained practitioner and a parent facilitator. Changes in parenting 
stress and distress is examined in both studies, through single case design analysis, differences i n mean change, and effect 
sizes. Effective, accessible and acceptable supports for parents of children on the autism spectrum are essential to improve 
the wellbeing of these families. Third wave approaches may be more appropriate than traditional cognitive  or behavioural

 approaches. Digital delivery of supports can increase accessibility, and co -facilitation with parents can enhance the social 
validity of supports.

Introduction : Digital CBT (dCBT) can achieve similar outcomes to in -person therapy but young people’s (YP) qualitative 
experiences of receiving it online remain understudied. We explored YP and caregivers' experiences of receiving dCBT on a 
specialist videoconferencing platform with additional digital tools. Method : YP (N=282) who received dCBT in 2020 and 
their caregiver(s) (N=568) completed the ‘Friends and Fami ly Test’ and the ‘Experience of Service Questionnaire’ at the end 
of therapy (YP response rate of 28.5%). Thematic analysis of free -text responses of ‘what went well’ and ‘what could be 
improved’ during their care was conducted. Results : There were 1,245 p ositive comments, fitting 17 themes. Most 
commonly reported for YP were: the therapeutic relationship/alliance; psychoeducation & understanding problems; 
feeling listened to. Caregivers also praised clinician attributes. There were 687 suggestions for impr ovement, fitting 23 
themes. The top three for YP were: more personalised care; additional sessions; and concerns about technical issues. For 
caregivers it was additional sessions; more parental involvement/feedback; greater continuity of care. Discussion : Routine 
collection of feedback is key for continuous quality improvement. Unsurprisingly, feedback for this digital service mirrored 
experiences of other services, with the therapeutic alliance being a key factor for both YP and guardians despite interesti ng 
differences between YP and caregiver views.

The covid19 pandemic (WHO, 2019) brought a significant adjustment in the delivery of specialist mental health treatment 
across all services in March 2020. The mo st common change was mental health services reducing face to face contact and 
replacing with telephone and digital consultations. Due to the early positive feedback received from delivering CBT 
remotely, it was proposed that a Digital Cognitive Behavioural  Therapy (DCBT) pathway would be implemented for a 1 year 
trial period. Between January 2021 and January 2022, feedback data was collated from young people and families about 
their experiences of receiving digital CBT across BSW. The feedback focused on qu alitative and quantitative data with the 
use of service -based questionnaires. The DCBT team received 118 referrals, of which 90 young person were deemed 
suitable for the service (76%). Of the 90 young people accepted for treatment, 65 had been successfully  discharged from 
CAMHS (72%). General feedback had focused on the positives of having flexible arrangements due to the remote sessions 
and the nature of the therapist who was able to work creatively and collaboratively on a digital platform.  Despite being a 1 
year project, the results support the need for a DCBT pathway within CAMHS. There is particular emphasis on the 
effectiveness of the therapist to be able to deliver CBT digitally and achieve positive treatment outcomes. Further analysis 
of practitioner s beliefs would also be particularly useful.  
 
Understanding parents’ experience of a Family Connections pilot group within a Child and

Intro: Research has shown family members of individuals with emotion regulation difficulties often provide significant 
amounts of care with implications for their own wellbeing. A growing evidence -base suggests interventions can effectively 
reduce carer burden, empowering family members to better support themselves and their loved one. One such 
intervention is the Family Connections (FC) group, a 12 -week program which d raws on DBT and peer support. Despite 
evidence that parental involvement in treatment is key in the recovery of young people, previous research on carer 
interventions and emotion dysregulation has largely focused on adults. Thus, it is unclear how carer -focused interventions 
are experienced by parents of young people with emotion regulation difficulties. This study starts to address this research 
gap by evaluating parents’ experience of a pilot FC group delivered within a CAMHS setting. Method: A mixed -meth ods 
approach is being used. Pre -post statistics on carer burden, parental stress, mastery, anxiety and depression will be 
calculated. Data from focus groups will be analysed using thematic analysis. Result/discussion: Project is on -going. We plan 
to compar e our findings with existing research looking at FC interventions within the adult population to observe whether 
similar outcomes are found amongst carers of young people. This will allow recommendations to be made regarding future 
research, and reflection s on how groups can be effectively adapted for CAMHS.

Approximately 7 –17% of children have a sibling with a long -term condition (LTC). Siblings of children with LTCs can have 
significantly elevated mental health needs but these are often overlooked, poorly understood and untreated. Providing 
psycho logical support through low -intensity CBT interventions may help address their unmet needs.  The study was 
conducted as part of an uncontrolled trial evaluating a mental health drop -in centre at a paediatric hospital which offered 
support for patients, sibl ings and parents/carers. This study aimed to identify characteristics of siblings attending the 
centre; describe their mental health and quality of life and examine the type of intervention required for siblings and the 
impact on their mental health.  Eight een siblings aged 2 -17 attended the centre and received a brief mental health 
intervention over six -months, including self -help resources, referrals to internal psychology services, and/or brief 
psychological therapy. Results demonstrated a significant dec rease in mental health symptoms and increase in quality of 
life, providing initial support for accessible mental health interventions for siblings.  This study points to the feasibility and 
value of assessing siblings experiencing emotional and behavioural difficulties and providing them with interventions that 
are accessible, effective and acceptable. There are also direct implications for NHS service provision and delivery of low -
intensity psychological interventions.  
 
Low intensity psychological intervent ions for the treatment of eating disorders .

The COVID -19 pandemic has led to a surge in eating disorders among children and young people (CYP), with NHS services 
unable to treat all those in need. This unprecedented demand means there is urgent need for less resource -intensive 
treatments that are scientifically supported, accessible and scalable, such as guided self -help (GSH). GSH is recommended 
for adults with bulimia and binge eating disorder, and has proven efficacy for CYP with anxiety and depression. However, 
there is little research on G SH as a treatment for CYP with eating disorders. This PhD project aims to develop and evaluate 
GSH for impairing symptoms of eating disorders in CYP for whom it is clinically appropriate. We are doing a systematic 
review to explore the effectiveness of low -intensity interventions for the treatment of feeding and eating disorders. Our 
search strategy includes feeding and eating disorder terms, low -intensity psychological intervention terms and randomised 
controlled trial terms. The review is registered on PR OSPERO (CRD42022302956) and is currently at full -text screening. We 
anticipate 35 papers will be included, and the poster will describe their efficacy and key elements that contribute to 
efficacy. Future work involves modifying existing self -help intervent ions with input from focus groups with CYP with eating 
disorders, their parents and health professionals, and a feasibility study to establish the preliminary effectiveness, 
feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.

Some people experience persisting symptoms after a COVID -19 infection, they are said to have long COVID. Little is known 
about prevalence, symptoms, duration and treatment of long COVID, particularly in relation to children and young people 
(CYP). The  Children and Young People with Long COVID (CLoCk) study is a matched cohort study of 30,000 CYP aged 11 -17 
that tracks health over a two -year period to understand the trajectory of symptoms. Early findings suggest that 
approximately 40% of CYP report feel ing worried or sad 14 weeks after a PCR test (Stephenson et al. 2022). Additionally, 
figures from the Office of National Statistic (ONS) report that 30% of CYP with long COVID present with a probable mental 
health problem compared to 7.7% of CYP without th e condition (ONS, 2022). These findings highlight the need to 
understand the impact of long COVID from the perspective of those with lived experience of the condition. This poster 
presentation will focus on plans for a qualitative PhD project exploring the  mental health of CYP with long COVID through 
interviews with 16 child -parent dyads recruited from the CLoCk study. Interviews will explore how long COVID has affected 
CYP mental health including the impact of lockdown, school closures and parental health.  Understanding the psychological 
needs and challenges faced by CYP with long COVID is the first step to developing effective interventions to treat the 
condition.

Introduction: Emotional dysregulation and self -harm are commonly reported by adolescents in Child and Adolescent 
Mental Health Services (CAMHS). In this study we e xamined the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of online 
Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) skills groups for adolescents and their caregivers in CAMHS during the COVID -19 
pandemic. Method: Adolescents (n = 20, aged 14 -18 years) with emotional dysregulation and self -harm were recruited to 
the DBT skills groups (one of 16 weeks and one of 11 weeks). Caregivers were offered two cycles of 8 -week groups 
concurrently. The DBT skills group was offered as an adjunct to young people’s individual therape utic interventions within 
CAMHS. Assessments of emotional dysregulation and suicidality were conducted before and after treatment. Qualitative 
feedback was collected from adolescents and their caregivers. Results: Young people (n = 13) completed the online  DBT 
skills group, and caregivers (n = 17) attended the caregiver group. Young people found the group was delivered at the right 
level, well -organised and accessible. They reported reductions in emotion dysregulation and suicidality (ps &lt; .05). 
Caregive r feedback suggested the group is relevant and helpful. Discussion: It is feasible, acceptable, and potentially 
effective to deliver an online DBT skills group to adolescents and caregivers. Further research is needed to examine the 
impact of this online s kills group on suicidal behaviour and A&E attendance.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is effective in the workplace in increasing well -being and productivity (Flaxman, 
2010). We developed a four -session course which encouraged values -guided action and included assertiveness skills, which 
can protect against low self -esteem and increase self -acceptance (Marshall, 2015). Delivered via non -clinical staff 
experienced in vocational sup port using slide presentations, video clips, workbooks and discussion. Outcome data was 
collected from a live group intervention for 6 participants, and 6 participating via an on -line platform, with support 
sessions. A self -report confidence rating scale ( CR) and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), (Mund, 2002) were 
administered pre and post intervention. A questionnaire provided feedback and vocational outcomes. Results: Group: 
mean CR scores increased from 4 to 6.17. Mean WSAS scores indicated 25 % improvement with no significance shown on 
paired sample t -test. On -line: mean CR scores indicated 78% improvement, significance on t -test p&lt;0.01. There was a 
significant difference in the WSAS scores, p&lt;0.05. Low attrition and participant feedback suggest the course was helpful 
and well tolerated with 11 out of 12 participants employed post intervention. Results indicate improvement for both 
intervention formats. The course format can fit a 40 -minute lesson in a secondary school for year 11 pupils. Guided self -
help interventions could be helpful and warrant further research.  
 
Barriers to Emergency Department Clinicians' Confidence in Providing Paediatric Trauma -Informed 
Care .

It has been estimated that around 31% of children will experience a traumatic event during childhood, most commonly 
serious accidents that lead to hospitalisation. Around 15% of children who experience such events go onto develop PTSD. 
Emergency department clinicians have a unique opportunity to intervene during the early peri-trauma period, which can 
involve incorporating a trauma -informed approach within their care. Alisic et al. (2016) previously conducted an 
international survey of emergency department clinicians’ attitudes towards providing trauma -informed psychosocial  care 
to injured children. Findings suggested that clinicians need further education and training to enhance their knowledge and 
confidence in providing trauma -informed psychosocial care. Presently, a secondary data analysis was conducted to explore 
the ba rriers experienced by U.K. and Irish emergency department clinicians in confidently providing psychosocial care. 
Findings suggested that clinician confidence may be influenced by a lack of training, worrying about further upsetting 
children, and low levels  of perceived departmental performance in providing psychosocial care. The findings highlight a 
need for further training in psychosocial care for emergency department clinicians. Future research must identify nationally 
relevant pathways to implement trai ning programmes to improve clinician knowledge of paediatric traumatic stress and 
aim to reduce perception of barriers identified in the present study.

Fatigue and depression are common issues faced by adolescents, and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy has been applied 
separately to both. Fatigue can also be a symptom of depression. To improve the effectiveness of treatments for 
adolescent depression, we need to better understand the importan ce of individual symptoms in adolescents, such as 
fatigue. The current study aims to qualitatively explore adolescent’s experiences and understandings of fatigue in 
depression, in a mixed clinical and community sample. 17 adolescents, aged 15 -18 years old (M = 16.29, SD = .92), with 
elevated symptoms of depression have taken part in semi -structured interviews. A further 4 -8 interviews are expected. 
Data is being analysed using reflexive thematic analysis from an inductive, experiential perspective. We antic ipate that 
generated themes will provide insight into how adolescents experience fatigue as a symptom of depression. Themes may 
relate to how adolescents conceptualise, describe and recognise fatigue, how they communicate their fatigue to others, 
how fatig ue is distinguished from other depressive symptoms, and its wider impact. This research may provide useful 
insight into the relative importance of fatigue in the context of adolescent depression, indicating whether this is an area f or 
further inquiry. Find ings may also help clinicians to better identify and treat fatigue in depressed adolescents in practice 
and could inform a cognitive behavioural model of fatigue in this population.  
 
Psychopathic Features in a Nonclinical Group of Italian Adolescents: A Longitudinal Study .

According to the triarchic model, psychopathy includes three phenotypic dispositions: meanness, boldness, and 
disinhibition. Such a model has been widely explored in adults, while research with teenagers is li mited. This study aimed 
to verify the 6 -month stability of the triarchic model dimensions, and investigate their longitudinal association with 
antisocial behaviour in a nonclinical group of Italian adolescents (N=63, 55.6% girls, mean age=15.5 years±1.91; range: 12 -
19). Self -report tools assessing the triarchic constructs and antisocial behaviours were administered at the baseline (T0) 
and after 3 (T1) and 6 (T2) months. 1 (Group) x 3 (Time) repeated -measures ANOVAs were performed to ascertain the 
stability  of psychopathic features over time. Linear regressions were conducted to verify if the triarchic model domains at 
T0 predicted physical and social aggression and rule -breaking behaviour at T2. Results showed that boldness and 
disinhibition did not vary ov er time, while meanness increased from T0 to T2 (M T0=36.8±5.02; M T2=37.9±4.81). Boldness 
at T0 was a negative predictor of physical (β= -.27, p=.01) and social aggression (β= -.29, p=.01) at T2, whereas meanness 
positively predicted social aggression (β=.2 7, p=.02). Thus, boldness and disinhibition may be stable features, while an 
increase in meanness may be phase -specific of adolescence. Boldness and meanness may be, respectively, protective and 
risk factors for the emergence of aggressive behaviour in tee nagers.  
 
IAPT and PWP’s  
A local service audit reviewing the outcome of a ‘3 -month waitlist hold’ initiative in IAPT for 
service -users with co -occurring substance misuse and mental health problems.  
Shannon  Potter , Hammersmith and Fulham IAPT Service, UK ; Stephanie  Eleuterio , Hammersmith and Fulham 
IAPT Service, UK ; Alexander  Sim, Hammersmith and Fulham IAPT Service, UK  
INTRODUCTION. IAPT services have received criticism for excluding people with co -occurring mental health (MH) and 
substance mi suse problems (dual -diagnosis), despite NICE guidelines suggesting these patients should have access to MH 
support through IAPT. In response, Hammersmith & Fulham IAPT introduced a ‘3 -month waitlist hold’ pathway: patients 
who are identified as high risk s ubstance users are referred to local drug and alcohol support services, while also being held 
on the IAPT wait -list for up to 3 months. This process is intended to provide patients with motivation to reduce their 
substance use and to offer a flexible, loca lly agreed pathway to re -engage with psychological therapies. METHOD. A 
retrospective audit evaluating patients with a 3 -month hold deadline that fell between 11/2018 and 11/2021. Data was 
collected for 110 patients. RESULTS. Of those who used the 3 -month hold to reduce their substance use, 44% re -engaged 
with MH treatment through IAPT. Of those who did re -engage with treatment 55% recovered, and drop -out rates were low 
at 36%. The most common reason among those patients who did not re -engage was no respons e to contact from the IAPT 
team. DISCUSSION. Results indicate that the use of a locally agreed pathway to facilitate engagement with psychological 
therapies is beneficial. These findings support NICE guidelines that substance misuse should not be an exclus ion criterion 
for patients accessing IAPT. Suggestions are made to help improve re -engagement.

Inherently embedded within the values of IAPT, is that people from all sections of the community should have a chance to 
benefit from evidence -based psychological therapies. Despite this, clients from minoritised ethnic grou ps and religious 
groups are often under -represented in referrals and tend to have poorer outcomes in IAPT (Baker, 2020). To address these 
issues, the BAME Positive Practice Guide (Beck at al., 2019) encourages proactive work to improve access and outcomes for 
clients through service level changes, outreach, audits, adapting therapy and staff development (including through 
training). However, despite such recommendations there is limited provision and support to access such training.  This 
service evaluation used qualitative methods to gather in depth data from the attendees about their experiences of 
attending the training day on Culturally Sensitive Treatments within IAPT. Thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) was 
used to analyse the data, and to identify  patterns and themes across the entire data set. Common themes included, 
'perceived barriers that clients encounter’, 'barriers that therapists encounter’, 'positive feedback about the event' and 
'constructive feedback’. Overall, the results of this evalua tion have been encouraging with respondents reporting learning 
points and increased confidence. However, further evaluation is needed to understand the degree to which such training 
impacts on clinical practice and whether changes are sustained.  
 
Beyond Mo dule 3: Embedding Diversity and Inclusion in the PWP curriculum .  
Tamara  Wiehe , University of Reading , UK  
Decolonising and diversifying the curriculum is at the top of all training providers’ agendas. Since the national Psychologic al 
Wellbeing Practitioner  (PWP) curriculum review in 2015, we have seen improvements in these areas by the inclusion of a 
dedicated module towards the end of the programme focused on adapting our clinical practice for patients’ diversity 
considerations in line with key literature and legislation including IAPT Positive Practice guides, the Equality Act (2010), and 
the BPS Code of Ethics and Conduct (2018). However, the timing and the focus of the module present some challenges in 
which we look to overcome as a programme team and ha ve conceptualised these using the COM -B behavioural change 
framework (Michie et al., 2014). Using student and staff feedback to guide initial discussions, the need to increase 
capability and opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions on diversity and inclusion were highlighted. Due to the 
multifaceted and complex nature of decolonising and diversifying the curriculum, the subsequent deep dive lead the team 
in many directions including: (a) reconsidering the timing of the dedicated module within the pro gramme, (b) staff training 
provisions, (c) increasing engagement in D&I workstreams, and (d) reviewing the curriculum content session -by-session. 
Each of these pathways are discussed considering the implications for everyday clinical training and practice of LICBT, with 
a particular focus on intersectionality.

UK; Anna  Selby , University Hospitals of Derby & Burton , UK; Nick  Johnson  University Hospitals of Derby & 
Burton , UK  
Aims: To investigate the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) service for patients with elective and 
traumatic hand conditions within an acute hospital setting. Methods: Patients presenting in the Hand Unit with various 
hand conditions were offered CBT. Trauma Focused (TF) CBT was used to tre at traumatic injuries, elective patients were 
treated with CBT focusing on medically unexplained conditions and 3rd wave CBT methods. Demographic data and 
psychological assessment scores (PHQ9, GAD7, IES) were prospectively collected for patients who under went CBT before 
and after treatment.  Results : 114 patients attended an initial treatment session and 81 completed the treatment with full 
data available for 78 (68%) patients. Mean age was 41(range 13 – 84) and 60% were women. 64% had sustained a 
traumati c hand injury. There was a significant fall in all measured scores following treatment (table 3). 37% of patients 
suffered from severe depression according to the PHQ9 classification and 51% of patients suffered from severe anxiety 
according to the GAD7 cl assification before treatment. Following the treatment this had fallen to 0% and 3% respectively 
(figure 1). At initial assessment 93% of patients who had sustained a traumatic injury had an IES score of 33 or greater 
indicating PTSD. Following treatment t his had fallen to 7%. PHQ9 (pre 16.2, sd 7.1; post 4.7, sd 4.6, p<0.0001), GAD7 (pre 
15.2, sd 5.2; post 4.6, sd 4.1, p<0.0001) and IES (pre 61.0, sd 15.7; post 11.1, sd 12.3, p<0.0001)scores all decreased 
significantly following treatment.  Conclusions: Many patients with traumatic and elective hand conditions have associated 
psychological problems which may influence outcome. Despite this, the use of CBT is not widely utilized in acute hospital 
settings such as hand therapy and can impact the recovery of  the patient. CBT in a hand unit setting is an effective 
treatment.

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy treatment for a Fear of Hypoglycaemia within primary care: A Case 
Study .  
Josie  Bannon , Devon Partnership NHS Trust , UK; Anna  Disney , Devon Partnership NHS T rust, UK  
May individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) experience a fear of hypoglycaemia (FoH) which can have detrimental 
consequences on management of blood glucose (BG) levels and quality of life. The purpose of this case study is to examine 
the effectiven ess of CBT in treating FoH in a primary care psychological therapy service. Presenting Problem: Sarah was a 
woman in her 50s with T1D. 5 years ago Sarah experienced a hypoglycaemic episode which resulted in hospitalization. 
Following this experience Sarah developed a FoH and engaging in various behaviours that maintained high BG levels. This 
was having detrimental impacts on Sarah's health. General support by the hospital -based diabetes team had not been 
effective in supporting Sarah with her FoH. Case Conc eptualisation and Intervention: The treatment approach involved the 
creation of a formulation. Sarah’s coping strategies were conceptualised as ‘safety seeking behaviours’ (Salkovskis, 1991). 
Behavioural experiments were conducted to test the various eleme nts of the formulation. This allowed Sarah to build a 
new belief ‘If I have a hypo, I can manage'.  Outcome: Sarah exceed her goal of lowering her BG levels to an average of 10 -
12 mmol/L, with BG levels within the recommended range 75% of the time. Her leve ls of anxiety and depression also 
significantly reduced. Review and evaluation:  This case study is the first to demonstrate the effective treatment of FoH 
using CBT within a primary care IAPT service.

Introduction:  The ‘leapfrog’ tria l design (Blackwell et al., 2019) has been proposed as a method to accelerate development 
and optimization of psychological treatments by reducing the time, resources, and sample sizes needed. This study aimed 
to carry out a small -scale leapfrog trial (cli nicaltrials.gov: NCT04791137) to provide a first demonstration of the method 
and test feasibility. Method:  For demonstration purposes, the leapfrog design was applied to a cognitive training 
intervention aiming to reduce anhedonia, imagery cognitive bias m odification (CBM), delivered via the internet over 4 
weeks. Sequential Bayesian analyses were used to identify treatment arms superior or non -superior to an initial control 
condition, leading to them replacing the control condition or being dropped from th e trial, respectively. The trial started 
with 3 arms (a control condition and 2 imagery CBM variants), and 2 further arms (additional imagery CBM variants) were 
added as the trial progressed. Results:  One version of the imagery CBM remained as the ‘winner’  at the end of the trial (N = 
188 randomized participants), following sequential elimination of the other arms. All features of the leapfrog design were 
successfully implemented and no feasibility issues identified. Discussion:  The study demonstrates feasi bility of the leapfrog 
design and provides a starting point for its broader adoption as a means for more rapid development and optimization of 
psychological treatments such as CBT.  
 
Living Well with Illness: Evaluation of a Transdiagnostic Compassion -Focus ed Therapy Group for 
Long -Term Health Conditions .  
Rachel  Snodgrass , Newcastle University, UK ; Tim Chapman , The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS 
Foundation Trust, UK ; Joanna  Carnell , West London NHS Trust, UK  
Introduction: Existing evidence has shown the value of Compassion Focused Therapy for a range of difficulties such as 
eating disorders, psychosis, brain injury and PTSD. Although much research has focused on mental health difficulties in 
isolation, there is promise for employment of CFT interventi ons within physical health. This study was a mixed methods 
evaluation of a transdiagnostic CFT group, for adults with Long -term Health Conditions (LTHCs). Method: The group 
consisted of 11 weekly sessions, ten in group format and a 1:1 formulation session.  Outcome measurement data was 
collected from participants (pre and post). These measures assessed levels of anxiety, depression, overall well -being and 
confidence for engaging in daily activities. Processes targeted by CFT were measured including self -comp assion (SCp) and 
self-criticism (SCr). Qualitative feedback was also collated and analysed using conventional content analysis. Results: There 
was a significant reduction in scores of anxiety and depression. A significant improvement was observed for well -being and 
confidence for daily activities. A significant improvement was seen in SCp and concurrent reduction in SCr. Qualitative 
findings supported changes in SCp, utility of compassion -focused strategies and the benefits of a transdiagnostic format. 
Discussion: These findings suggest group CFT is an effective approach to improve psychological well -being in LTHCs and 
that this can be delivered in a transdiagnostic format.

Reading , UK; Clio Berry , Brighton and Sussex Medical School, UK  
Introduction: Mental health problems in university students are associated with many negative outcomes, yet there is a 
gap between need and timely access to evidence -based help. Single -session interventions (SSIs) are scalable, accessible, 
and designed to deliver core evidence -based intervention components within a one -off encounter. COMET (Common 
Elements Toolb ox) is an online self -help SSI, including cognitive restructuring, gratitude, and behavioural activation. COMET 
has previously been tested in India and the US with promising results. However, it has yet to be evaluated in UK university 
students. Method: We  are conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of COMET versus a waiting list control, with 2 - 
and 4 -week follow -ups. Any UK university student can take part. Feasibility outcomes as well as change in symptoms and 
self-report of how much participants have been practising skills learned are measured.  Results: To date (March 2022) 
&gt;200 UK university students have been recruited (anticipate &gt;300 total by June 2022). Findings will report on 
feasibility (including recruitment rates, intervention adher ence, and retention to follow -up), acceptability (student self -
report of helpfulness) and utility. Discussion: This presentation reports on the feasibility, acceptability, and utility of t his 
innovative, cognitive -behavioural based online SSI in UK univers ity students. This will inform the potential to offer COMET 
as a low cost, timely and scalable addition to the ava  
 
Dissonance -based prevention of eating pathology in non -Western cultures: A randomized

UK 
Objective: The aims of this study were to determine the effectiveness of an adapted version of the Body Project for young 
Saudi women, and to determine the impact of compliance (i.e. adherence to homework and attendance) on outcomes. 
Method: A randomized controlled trial. Simple randomization using electronic random number generation was used to 
allocate Sau di undergraduate females (N=92; mean age = 20.48 years; SD = 2.28) to either a culturally -adapted version of 
the Body Project or a health education control condition. Participants completed self -report measures of eating pathology, 
body image, depression a nd social anxiety before and following the interventions and at three -month follow -up. Results: 
The control group made very limited changes following the education intervention. In contrast, the Body Project 
intervention yielded extensive positive benefits , with moderate to strong effect sizes. Attending sessions and completing 
homework did not influence outcomes. Conclusion: The effectiveness of the Body Project for Saudi women indicates that 
the change methods used are relevant across cultures and deliver y methods. Women in Saudi Arabia with pathological 
eating and body concerns can be helped through the appropriate adaptation of a prevention programme developed in a 
Western culture.  
 
Training and Supervision  
 
“Power to the People”: Training for healthcare professionals in supporting persistent pain .  
Alex  Corline , Newcastle University , UK; Chris  Penlington , Newcastle University, UK ; Frances  Cole , Live Well with 
Pain, UK  
Persistent pain is thought to affect one -third of the UK population. Self -man agement is a key approach recommended for 
persistent pain. However, many healthcare professionals (HCPs) are unfamiliar with supporting self -management. The 10 
Footsteps training was developed to cover all facets of pain self -management and may help HCPs. Our study explores 
HCPs’ issues in supporting persistent pain self -management and tests if the 10 Footsteps training improves confidence 
supporting self -management. Training consisted of two half -day periods covering the 10 Footsteps to pain self -
managemen t and four optional question sessions. Questionnaires on confidence supporting self -management were given 
at baseline and three months post training, pairing 18 results. Five trainees volunteered for semi -structured interviews 
evaluating the training and t he problems supporting pain self -management. Average confidence on the 10 self -
management topics increased from baseline (M= 3.11/5, SD=0.81) to post training (M=4.03/5, SD=0.592) t(18)=4.078,

 p&lt;0.001. Reported problems in supporting persistent pain inc luded resource inadequacy, difficulty isolating pain 
conditions, and poor communication of pain. Participants related improved confidence to a greater pain experience 
understanding, improved patient resources, and ease of presentability. HCP confidence sup porting persistent pain self -
management increased after training. Themes are explored relating level of experience to course content engagement.  
 
Trainee Clinical Psychologists’ Views on the Facilitators and Barriers to Cognitive Behavioural 
Practice on Cl inical Training: A Thematic Exploration .  
Devon  Rodwell , University of Surrey , UK; Tom  Kent , University of Surrey , UK; Lucy  Hale , University of Surrey , UK  
Introduction: Trainee Clinical Psychologists (TCPs) are expected to develop knowledge and competencies in Cognitive 
Behavioural Therapy (CBT), as part of their clinical training (British Psychological Society, 2019). Research suggests that C BT 
is often underused and delivered inadequately within clinical practice (Hernandez Hernandez & Waller, 2021). To the 
authors' knowledge, exploration of TCPs’ experiences of applying CBT principles on their Clinical Psychology (CP) training 
placements is yet to be evaluated. This evaluation therefore aimed to gain an understanding of TCPs’ experiences of 
delivering CBT on clinical placement, focusing on the facilitators and potential barriers of good practice. Method: Seven 
TCPs on a UK CP programme participated in a 60 -minute focus group using a video -conferencing platform. Reflexive 
thematic analysis (Braun  & Clarke, 2012) was used to analyse the data and five themes were generated. Results: TCPs’ 
views on the facilitators and barriers to their CBT practice were identified. The five themes were “Feeling Underprepared 
for Placement”, “Placement Supervisors”, “Additional Support”, “Personal Views”, and “Concerns over Therapeutic 
Relationship”. Discussion: Strengths and limitations were ascertained in the selected CP programme’s CBT provision, across 
different domains of training. Course staff will respond to th ese issues to improve the CBT pedagogy, including the 
development of the CBT curriculum and sharing examples of good practice.  
 
A qualitative study of the experiences of cognitive behavioural therapists working with 
interpreters remotely .  
Jennifer  Wardman -Browne , University of Essex , UK  
Working with an interpreter is recommended when patients do not speak English. This research aimed to explore the 
experience of cognitive behavioural therapists working with interpreters remotely. Semi -structed interviews w ere 
conducted with fifteen participants who were asked about their experience of working with interpreters remotely. 
Interviews will be transcribed and interpreted using Thematic analysis. Results & Conclusions: Ongoing/TBC  
 It is proposed that this study will result in a report identifying current good practice and potential barriers. It is anticipated 
that this research may lead to developing training packages for practitioners.  Keywords: cognitive behaviour therapy,

Introduction : Staff struggle to access high quality training in both the assessment of common  sleep difficulties, and in the 
delivery of evidence -based interventions such as CBT for Insomnia (CBT -I). The Newcastle Regional Sleep Service and CNTW 
NHS mental health trust have co -designed a remote training package for sleep which was available for al l staff, and was 
recorded prior to and launched during the Covid -19 pandemic.  
Method : Four 40 -minute professionally produced videos of sleep training were developed for the training package. 
Additionally a pre –post knowledge test was incorporated, and a fo llow up survey of staff on the experience of the training 
and its implementation.  
Results : Within the first two months, 118 people had enrolled, mostly from a nursing background, but also staff from OT, 
psychology, pharmacy, managerial and student backgrou nds. To date 25 staff have completed all modules, 72 have 
completed at least one of the modules. Pre to post completion quiz scores increased by 20%, and mean completion score 
was 82%. We intend to present further data at conference, including feedback fro m staff on the experience of the training 
and implementation.  
Discussion : This training package provided an alternative experience to face -to-face delivery with low cost, and was able to 
be flexibly accessed by a wide range of health professionals at a tim e suitable for them.

 In-conference workshops  
Understanding and treating death anxiety  
David  Veale , Kings College London , UK; Rachel  Menzies , Sydney University , Australia  
 
Scientific Background:  Death anxiety is a term used to describe people’s fear or negative feelings towards death or dying. 
Some people may focus on their own death, such as ruminating on all the things they will miss out on after they die, or 
what it will be like to not exist anymore. Some people may experience doubts about the natu re of existence itself, such as 
questioning what will happen to them after death. Others may worry about the process of dying, such as whether their 
death will be painful, or what their final moments will be like. Some may be distressed at the idea of losi ng a loved one. 
They may worry about how they will cope with their loved ones’ death or that they will somehow cause the death of their 
loved one without meaning to. For some there is a phobic avoidance and fear of anything related to death (e.g. going nea r 
cemeteries or funeral parlours). All the experiences above are in many ways part of being human, but death anxiety is a 
problem when it is either sufficiently time -consuming, distressing or interfering in one's life. The concept cuts across 
different dia gnoses including some types of Health Anxiety, OCD, specific phobias, and panic disorder. Unfortunately, 
death anxiety may not be adequately targeted in standard protocols for these disorders and this workshop will try to 
remedy this with a specific focus on the fears of death and dying. Treatment components will be discussed, centring on 
CBT, which is the most evidence -based treatment for death anxiety.  
 
Learning Objectives: By the end of the skills class, participants will : 
1. Understand the context and p henomenology of death anxiety, and its relationship with relevant diagnoses  
2. Be knowledgeable about a cognitive behavioral model and have a understanding of the cognitive processes and 
behaviours that maintain death anxiety. This includes the intolerance  of uncertainty, magical thinking, the awfulness of 
dying, as well as avoidance, safety seeking and checking behaviours related to death.  
3. Develop alternative ways of thinking about common beliefs in death for example thoughts about the awfulness of not  
existing or the intolerance of not knowing will happen.  
4. Use appropriate exposure/ behavioural experiments for death and dying and consider what expectations are being 
tested. Fifteen different tasks will be discussed from writing out one’s funeral wis hes and obituary, painting one’s coffin or 
collecting “memento mori”.  
5. Focus on living life to the full now as an alternative to focussing on death and dying

skills

Southern Health Care NHS Foundation Trust , UK 
 
Scientific Background:  In 2017, NICE identified a need for briefer evidence -based therapies for eating disorders. This was 
followed by evidence that CBT for eating disorders (CBT -ED) can be delivered effectively for most patients in a much 
shorter format than previously recommended. The resultant 10 -sessi on therapy (CBT -T) has now developed a substantial 
evidence base, demonstrating that it can be as effective as 20 -session therapy, with equally large effect sizes and recovery 
rates. The therapy is based on a protocol that stresses the need to flex therapy  to the individual patient, without losing 
sight of the key tasks of that therapy. It differs from previous, longer forms of CBT -ED in using more intensive methods of 
producing change.  This protocol has been used to train large numbers of clinicians in eat ing disorders services in the UK 
and internationally. This workshop will introduce clinicians to the ways in which CBT -T addresses the core competences

105 
 
 
 and metacompetences of CBT for eating disorders. It will outline the therapy and the skills needed for w orking with adults 
and adolescents, demonstrating key skills and how they can be adapted to patients with different presentations (e.g., 
comorbidity; Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder; Autistic Spectrum Disorders) and using different presentation 
modes (e.g., online presentation; group work).  
 
Learning Objectives:  
1. Understand the evidence base for CBT -T relative to other forms of CBT -ED 
2. Understand the principles of CBT -T 
3. Be able to explain CBT -T to patients, trainees and supervisees  
4. Be aware of the key techniques involved in delivering brief but effective CBT -ED, including the inhibitory learning 
approach to exposure, methods addressing emotional triggers, and patient -centred body image interventions

Coping with adversity: a question of focus  
Stirling  Moorey , London, UK  
 
Scientific Background:  The concept of safety seeking behaviour has been one of the most valuable contributions to 
understanding and treating anxiety disorders and other conditions. When the perceived threat is unrealistic, such as in 
panic disorder or health anxiety, identifying and testing safety behaviours is relatively straightforward. When facing 
adversity, howeve r, the difference between adaptive and maladaptive coping can be more nuanced. It is often the degree 
and flexibility with which coping methods are applied that differentiates helpful from unhelpful coping. This workshop will 
draw on scientific evidence fr om research on coping and in behavioural medicine to help participants understand the 
factors that facilitate effective coping.  
 
Learning Objectives:  
1. To understand the correlation between particular coping styles and adjustment - The '3 Cs' of control,  coherence and 
connection.  
2. To be able to use the concept of 'focus of coping' to enhance their work with people facing adversity - focus on the 
problem, the emotional reaction to the problem, or focus on maintaining and building their life beyond the pr oblem.  
3. To differentiate between effective coping and safety behaviours by examining the function and flexibility of the coping 
strategies employed.

Brief Cognitive Therapy for Adolescent Panic Disorder  
Polly  Waite , University of Reading , UK; Lizzy  Hughes , University of Reading , UK; Emily  Sands  Oxford Health 
Foundation NHS Trust , UK 
 
Scientific Background:  Panic disorder occurs in 1 -3% of adolescents, has high rates of comorbidity, and a negative impact 
on functioning at school and with friends. Left untreated, it appears to have a chronic course. Currently the most common 
psychological treatment approach for adolescents with panic disorder  is a generic form of cognitive behaviour therapy

106 
 
 
 (CBT), developed for a range of anxiety disorders. However, many treatment trials of this general approach have excluded 
young people with panic disorder, and existing treatments specifically for adolescent s with panic disorder require a 
considerable amount of therapist time (between 11 and 22 hours of therapy). As such, there is a clear need to develop 
effective, scalable treatments. In adults, individual cognitive therapy based on Clark’s (1986) cognitive model for panic 
disorder has been shown to be highly effective, including in a brief format. We have recently evaluated the brief version of 
this treatment, adapted for use with adolescents, within the PANDA feasibility randomised controlled trial 
(https:/ /doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN14884288). Cognitive therapy was delivered 1:1 (face to face and remotely) by children’s 
wellbeing practitioners within an NHS -commissioned clinic. It involved 5 treatment sessions and 2 booster sessions. Prior 
to each of the first 4  sessions, the young person was given a self -study workbook to read, which also included written 
exercises and homework activities. This approach will be presented within this workshop.  
 
Learning Objectives: By the end of the workshop, participants will be  able to:  
1. Assess panic disorder in adolescents and use sessional measures to guide treatment  
2. Understand the key elements of cognitive therapy for panic disorder  
3. Put together an individualised model of panic disorder for a young person  
4. Understand the role of education about the nature of anxiety and the meaning of different body sensations  
5. Undertake behavioural experiments to test out young peoples’ beliefs in action  
6. Consider how to involve family members and school staff in treatment

An introduction to Dialectical Behaviour Therapy skills training for Adolescents (DBT -A) 
Marie  Wassberg , London, UK  
 
Scientific Background:  DBT Skills T raining is an essential part of the DBT treatment programme developed by Marsha 
Linehan for the treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder over 30 years ago. Since then, there have been numerous 
studies exploring and validating this approach for differen t populations.  This workshop will introduce the DBT for 
Adolescents formulation and look at the 5 sets of skills taught in the DBT -A programme. I will discuss the particular group 
processes involved in working with adolescents who present with emotion dysr egulation and relationship difficulties.  
Mindfulness is key to the development of effective functioning and self -management. Distress Tolerance and Emotion 
Regulation skills are essential for understanding and regulating emotions, while Interpersonal Effec tiveness and Walking 
the Middle Path are based on conflict resolution and uses standard assertiveness skills. DBT -A takes a very practical and 
accessible approach to increasing effectiveness in many areas, which often requires the skilful blend of all 5 sk ill sets.  While 
DBT-A was initially developed for adult patients with Borderline Personality Disorder, many of its principles and practical 
interventions have been taught to adolescents with good effect. Teaching adolescents DBT -A skills for use in their e very -
day life, can help them deal with difficulties such as how to understand and regulate strong emotions and recognise 
harmful friendships in a better way.  
 
Learning Objectives: Participants will acquire the following skills:  
1. To introduce DBT -A Skills  Training in the context of the DBT -A formulation, which hypothesises skills deficits in people 
with BPD and other disorders featuring emotion dysregulation.  
2. To introduce the 5 DBT -A skills, Core Mindfulness (the skills that underpin all DBT skills and practice), Distress Tolerance, 
Walking the Middle Path, Emotion Regulation and Interpersonal Effectiveness. We will address how these are taught in 
groups.  
3. To model and invite delegates to practice the teaching of key DBT -A skills.

 Behavioural experiments for intolerance of uncertainty: A n ew treatment for generalized anxiety 
disorder  
Michel  Dugas , University of Quebec in Outaouais, Canada ; Roz Shafran , University College London , UK 
Scientific Background:  Cognitive -behavioural therapists have many treatment options for adult clients suffering from GAD. 
Examples of treatments include metacognitive therapy, acceptance -based behaviour therapy, attention/interpretation 
training, and CBT with a focus on intolerance of uncertainty. Although these treatments are conceptually and procedurally  
distinct, they all share the following features: (1) they are based on models that involve multiple affective, cognitive, and  
behavioural components; (2) they include several intervention strategies that target the model components; and (3) 
although they have empirical support, their efficacy lags behind that of CBT protocols for other anxiety disorders. 
Consequently, our group developed a new, highly focused treatment for GAD: Behavioural Experiments for Intolerance of 
Uncertainty. The treatment draws upo n 25 years of research on the role of intolerance of uncertainty in GAD, as well as on 
recent theorizing on the mechanisms of fear reduction. In brief, the new treatment uses the structure of behavioural 
experiments to explicitly test client hypotheses and  thus enhance new learning during exposure to uncertainty. The 
treatment has now been tested in two clinical trials, with results showing that it promotes impressive change in negative 
beliefs about uncertainty, the symptoms of GAD and general psychopathol ogy. The goal of this workshop is to present the 
new treatment’s underlying theory and to illustrate its strategies and procedures.  
 
Learning Objectives:  
1. To recognize the many faces of intolerance of uncertainty to improve diagnostic decisions involvin g GAD.  
2. To learn how to adjust one’s therapeutic attitudes to promote exposure to uncertainty in session.  
3. To clearly understand the treatment’s underlying model and how the model relates to general cognitive -behavioural 
theory.  
4. To learn how to use exposure -based behavioural experiments to promote new learning about uncertainty and its 
sequelae.  
5. To learn how to monitor the progress of clients throughout therapy.

Cognitive Therapy for PTSD following sexual assault  
Sharif  El-Leithy , Traumatic Stress Service , UK, London ; Hannah  Murray , Oxford Centre for Anxiety Disorders and 
Trauma, University of Oxford , UK 
Scientific Background:  Up to 50% of women who have been sexually assaulted will develop PTSD. Sexual assault is the 
most frequent cause of PTSD in women, and tends to lead to particularly severe symptoms (Smit h et al., 2016). We will 
outline some of the challenges in working with survivors to treat PTSD following sexual assault, and formulate them within 
the cognitive model of PTSD (Ehlers & Clark, 2000). The following areas will be discussed:  
• Working with co gnitive themes such as self -blame, ‘rape myths’, mental contamination, shame, defeat and loss of trust.  
• The nature of trauma memories following sexual assault, with particular reference to drug -facilitated rape, non -fatal 
strangulation and multiple vict imisation.  
• Working with the consequences of sexual exploitation and grooming, including secrecy, ambivalence and loyalty to the 
perpetrator.  
• Coping strategies following sexual assault, including avoidance, self -harm, risky sexual behaviour and dissociation.  
• The relational impact of sexual assault, including reclaiming intimacy and sexuality.  
• The impact of media coverage, social and political discourses.  
• Issues within the therapeutic relationship, including obstacles to disclosure, therapis t gender and adapting for diversity.  
• Practical issues such as legal processes and safeguarding.  
We will describe and demonstrate how to adapt cognitive therapy for PTSD to address these issues, and invite participants 
to practise key skills  
 
Learning Objectives:  
1. Identify common themes and challenges in treating PTSD in women following sexual assault

108 
 
 
 2. Apply principles from existing cognitive models of PTSD to formulate these presentations  
3. Learn practical ways to implement cognitive the rapy techniques with survivors of sexual assaults.

Whose avoidance is it anyway? Formulating client AND therapist emotional avoidance in CBT  
Vickie  Presley , Coventry University , UK 
Scientific Background:  Whilst CBT is not primarily conceptualised as functioning via emotional processes per se, there is 
growing evidence that emotional processing is fundamental to psychological change and client recovery (Baker et al., 
2011). The role of experiential or 'emotional' avoidance i n the maintenance of psychopathology has increasingly been 
considered in the psychological literature. Research has shown that accepting emotions rather than avoiding them, results 
in lower levels of negative affect (Shallcross et al., 2010), with intolera nce of distress being highlighted as a transdiagnostic 
maintenance factor across disorders (Michel et al., 2016). Given that many clients present with difficulties related to 
emotional experiencing and expression, it is important that therapists are equipp ed with the skills to intervene effectively 
(Follette and Batten, 2002). However, therapists may have their own unhelpful beliefs about the role of emotions in 
therapy which impede this process (Leahy, 2015). The impact of therapist schemata has been docum ented (Haarhoff, 
2006; Presley et al., 2017) and more attention given to the benefits of therapists reflecting upon the interaction of their 
own schema with their therapeutic work (Leahy 2001; Young, Klosko and Weishar, 2003). In summary, whilst there is a n 
argument for helping clients to reduce emotional avoidance as part of cognitive -behavioural treatment, therapist beliefs 
about emotions are also important as part of this process.  
 
Learning Objectives: This workshop will enable participants to consider w ays to identify and formulate emotional 
avoidance in CBT, from the perspective of both client and therapist beliefs.  
Key Learning Outcomes:  
1. Improve understanding of emotions and their significance in cognitive -behavioural treatment  
2. Consider the im pact of unhelpful beliefs about emotions and their behavioural manifestations (client and therapist)  
3. Improve ability to identify and formulate emotional avoidance with clients as part of CBT treatment  
4. Improve ability to recognise and formulate therap ist emotional avoidance as part of CBT treatment and clinical 
supervision
