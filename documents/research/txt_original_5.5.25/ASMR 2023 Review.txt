The present PRISMA-guided article systematically reviews the current state of research on the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (last search: March 2022) selecting all studies that conducted quantitative scienti /uniFB01 c research on the ASMR phenomenon. Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: n = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting δ wave decreases), activation of speci /uniFB01 c brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more speci /uniFB01 c neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

## General Background

The phenomenon of autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR), a tingling sensation occurring especially on the skin of the neck and scalp as a reaction to certain triggers (Barratt &amp; Davis, 2015), has increasingly attracted public attention in recent years, especially via internet platforms such as YouTube or TikTok with individual ASMR-related videos receiving millions of views. As a novel way to relax and create pleasant feelings, ASMR might offer possible mental health-related bene /uniFB01 ts comparable to bene /uniFB01 ts that have already been demonstrated for other relaxation-associated techniques (e.g., Mindfulness: Creswell, 2017; Yoga: Field, 2011; Progressive muscle relaxation [PMR]: McCallie et al., 2006; or Autogenic Training [AT]: Seo &amp; Kim, 2019). Even though the ASMR phenomenonhasnotbeenscienti /uniFB01 cally studied in

detail as yet, the initial evidence available on various ASMR-related topics, offers the opportunity to provide a /uniFB01 rst systematic overview of the existing scienti /uniFB01 c research. Unsystematic review articles on the topic of ASMR have already been published (e.g., Ahuja, 2013; Andersen, 2015; Harper, 2020; Niven &amp; Scott, 2021; Reddy &amp; Mohabbat, 2020; N. Smith &amp; Snider, 2019). One of these articles provides a brief, structured overview of the current state of ASMR research (Reddy &amp; Mohabbat, 2020), however, without addressing the various de /uniFB01 nitions, assessment tools, and interventions related to ASMR research. By contrast, our review will extend this work both in terms of methodology and content: We aim to review the current state of ASMR research systematically and comprehensively. To this end, we will give an overview on de /uniFB01 nitions and assessment tools of the phenomenon, psychological, neural, and physiological ASMR correlates as well as ASMR interventions according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (Page et al., 2021).

## Methodology

## Selection Process

A systematic search was conducted by Tobias Lohaus (TL) in March 2022. Three different databases (Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science) were consulted. The search syntaxes for each database are presented in Box 1. After duplicates were removed from the search results, the /uniFB01 rst step in the selection process was to screen the titles and abstracts of the articles for a thematic /uniFB01 t (only articles that actually addressed the autonomous sensory meridian response were considered). This screening was done by the /uniFB01 rst author TL and supported by two master s '

students that were trained in the application of the screening criteria by TL. In the next step, a full-text evaluation of the remaining articles was carried out, with the senior author Patrizia Thoma (PT) being consulted in cases of uncertainty, for example, if it was not immediately obvious whether an article met the more speci /uniFB01 c inclusion criteria that will be described in the following paragraph.

## Eligibility Criteria

The following inclusion criteria (IC) were selected before conducting the systematic search:

- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; IC1: The study addressed the autonomous sensory meridian response.
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; IC2: Studies that implemented original empirical investigations were included, but overviews, commentaries, letters, keynotes, corrections, or qualitative research were not.
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; IC3: Only articles accepted in a scienti /uniFB01 c journal were considered (the discipline was not speci /uniFB01 ed; psychological articles were included as well as articles from medical or economic /uniFB01 elds).
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; IC4: Only articles written in English were included.

## Data Extraction Process

To obtain an overview of the de /uniFB01 nitions and assessment tools of the phenomenon, an integrative overview was created through the careful evaluation of the individual ASMR articles. In terms of the other areas covered in this systematic review (psychological, neural, and physiological ASMR correlates and ASMR interventions), authors TL and Sarah C. Schreckenberg (SS) summarized the results associated with

(potentially) ASMR-related outcomes according to the following themes:

- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; ASMR-related mental health outcomes
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; ASMR-related personality outcomes
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; ASMR-related cognition outcomes
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Speci /uniFB01 c ASMR-related brain areas/networks revealed via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Speci /uniFB01 c ASMR-related electroencephalography (EEG) outcomes
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Speci /uniFB01 c ASMR-related physiological outcomes
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Other ASMR-related phenomena and correlates

In addition to the aforementioned outcome domains, data were collected on the following variables:

- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; The report: author(s), year
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; The participants: number, age, gender
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; The research design: type of study, conditions, type of ASMR stimuli used
- GLYPH&lt;129&gt; Intervention (only intervention studies): intervention characteristics in the intervention group (IG) and control group (CG), duration

To assess risk of bias, the Critical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies was used (Moola et al., 2017), an eight-item instrument for evaluating the methodological quality of studies offering the possibility to rate ' yes, ' ' no, ' ' unclear, ' or ' not applicable ' for each item. A small adjustment was made so that the instrument could be used not only for crosssectional studies but also for almost all other study designs. To this end, Item 3 ( ' Was the exposure measured in a valid and reliable way? ' ) which cannot be applied to the many studies within the systematic review that do not contain exposure and Item 4 ( ' Were objective, standard criteria used for measurement of the condition? ' ) which is only designed for patient samples were excluded, facilitating applicability to the rather large number of studies with very different study designs retrieved in this systematic review. The /uniFB01 nal selection of items included in this review can be found in Supplemental Table S1. In addition to the evaluation of risk of bias, other items were created that assess the quality of the articles written about the studies instead of the methodological quality of the studies themselves. For this purpose, our research team developed /uniFB01 veitems presented in the Supplemental Table S1 (e.g., ' Is the interpretation of the results coherent and plausible? ' ). The risk of bias items and article quality items were rated by author TL and a member of the research team who was trained with regard to the scoring by TL. For each study, a total quality score was calculated, ranging from 0 to 11, corresponding to the total number of items. The interrater reliability for the total scores determined on the basis of all included studies was .88.

## Results

The results of the search and selection process are presented in a /uniFB02 ow diagram (Figure 1). Implementing the search syntaxes described above in the three different databases, a total of n = 1,139 studies were retrieved. Removing duplicates, n = 540 records remained that were screened based on the titles and abstracts of the articles. Numerous articles were immediately excluded since ASMR was not mentioned in the title or abstract of the articles (IC 1). N = 105were ultimately assessed in more detail. At the next step, it was a mis /uniFB01 t in relation to IC 1 -4 that led to exclusion (see Figure 1, for more details). Although the initial search did not restrict whether the research was published in a peerreviewed journal or whether it was a preprint, we subsequently decided to restrict this criterion so that only peer-reviewed articles and no preprints were included in the /uniFB01 nal analyses in this review (excluding 10 articles for this reason, 1 preprint and 9 nonpeer-reviewed articles). Ultimately, n = 49 articles were included based on the speci /uniFB01 ed screening process. Five articles were additionally included resulting from screening the reference lists of these 49 articles, leading to a total number of n = 54 studies. An overview of the data from the individual studies compiled for this review, including the main results of each study, can be found in Table 1.

With regard to the methodological quality of the studies and the articles written about these studies (see Table 2), it is striking that the authors of this article considered the overall quality to be rather inconsistent ( M = 6.93, SD = 2.65, minimum = 0, maximum = 11; based on the rating conducted by author TL).

## De nition and Assessment Tools /uniFB01

## ASMR De nition /uniFB01

Whenit comes to ASMR de /uniFB01 nitions presented within the 54 assessed articles, the /uniFB01 rst aspect that stands out is that a large number of articles cite one of the /uniFB01 rst articles dealing with ASMR on a scienti /uniFB01 c level, a source by Barratt and Davis (2015). It describes ASMR as a tingling, staticlike sensation on the skin that spreads across the skull and the back of the neck and that is accompanied by a feeling of relaxation and well-being.

Given the components of the original de /uniFB01 nition by Barratt and Davis (2015), it appears that the ASMR phenomenon in general is best described from two different perspectives: On the one hand, when de /uniFB01 ning ASMR it is possible to describe the sensory perception of ASMR. On the other hand, one can describe what a person

However, further descriptive elements of ASMR are introduced via other de /uniFB01 nitions. An overview of the different de /uniFB01 ning components of ASMR that are presented in the articles included in this systematic review is given in Table 3. In terms of the sensory perception, the de /uniFB01 nition is extended to encompass more body parts than the skull and back of the neck (e.g., spine and peripheral body parts such as arms or limbs) originally focused on by Barratt and Davis (2015). Despite these additions of further body parts, the head and neck are to be regarded as the core areas where the ASMR experience occurs. In terms of the ASMR-related feeling, additional phenomenological descriptions of the ASMR experience can also be found in other de /uniFB01 nitions provided by the authors of the studies uncovered in this systematic review. For example, in ten cases, a feeling of euphoria is described (Janik McErlean &amp; Banissy, 2017; Keizer et al., 2020; G. L. Poerio et al., 2022; Roberts et al., 2019, 2020a, 2020b, 2021; Rouw &amp; Erfanian, 2018; Seifzadeh et al., 2021; X. Wang et al., 2020). Furthermore, ASMR is described as calming in /uniFB01 ve cases (Idayati et al., 2021;

Note . ASMR = autonomous sensory meridian response; AEQ = ASMR-Experience Questionnaire; EEG = electroencephalography; fMRI = functional magnetic resonance imaging.

Palmer-Cooper et al., 2022; G. L. Poerio et al., 2018; S. D. Smith et al., 2019a; Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022). In addition, a sense of psychological stability is named in three cases as de /uniFB01 ning element of ASMR (Ahn, 2020; Ahn et al., 2019; M. Lee et al., 2019), and in three other cases, a feeling of comfort is described (Roberts et al., 2019, 2020a, 2021). Other experiences that have been described are pleasure or pleasantness (e.g., Ahn, 2020; Ahn et al., 2019; Chae et al., 2021; Hondaet al., 2020; M. Lee et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020) and peace of mind (Jeong, 2020).

In addition to naming the sensory and emotional characteristics of ASMR, the de /uniFB01 nition of ASMR can only be complete if information is also provided on how ASMR can be triggered. With regard to naming exemplary ASMRtriggers in the introduction of the articles retrieved in this systematic review, many authors again refer to a few articles, primarily again Barratt and Davis (2015). When considering the triggers used most often in the studies retrieved, the following pattern emerges: whispering (14), role play (11), tapping (9), personal attention (8), nature sounds (5, see Table 1). However, rather than counting how many studies used a speci /uniFB01 c trigger, it seems more meaningful to highlight those articles that have explicitly investigated which triggers most reliably elicited ASMR. This has been done in the studies conducted by Barratt and Davis (2015) and Barratt et al. (2017). These authors concluded that complex and lower pitched sounds (Barratt et al., 2017) as well as whispering, personal attention and crisp sounds (Barratt &amp; Davis, 2015) in particular proved to be reliable ASMR triggers.

## ASMR Assessment Tools

In terms of the instruments designed to assess ASMR, the systematic search highlighted two different instruments, namely the ASMR-15 (Roberts et al., 2019) and the ASMR-Experience Questionnaire (AEQ; Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022). While the ASMR-15 is a rather conventional questionnaire that assesses the ASMR experience by means of 15 items that can be assigned to different ASMR subfacets (Altered Consciousness, Sensation, Relaxation, Affect), the AEQis an online questionnaire encompassing 14 different questions related to several ASMR videos. It thus captures an assessment of the

ASMR experience directly related to the ASMR videos presented. In addition, a body map is integrated in the AEQ to determine the bodily ASMR experience as accurately as possible. Furthermore, since it appears that not everybody is able to experience ASMR (responder rates vary from 28% to 38%; Roberts et al., 2020a; Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022), the AEQ aims at differentiating people who can experience ASMR (ASMR-responders) from those who cannot (ASMR-nonresponders) offering a classi/uniFB01 cation into /uniFB01 ve different groups: ASMR-Strong, ASMR-Weak,Control + , Control-, False-Positive. ASMR-strong, and ASMR-weak can be consideredasASMR-responders,andControl + , Controland False-Positive as ASMR-nonresponders with False-Positive describing those who experience a sensory response to ASMR stimuli that is not in accordance with the typical ASMR characteristics.

While the ASMR-15 presents the 15 items only once, several AEQ items are repeated for each individually presented video. The internal consistency of the ASMR-15 was α = .78 in the initial study conducted by Roberts et al. (2019). In studies conducted later, this α value was reached again (G. L. Poerio et al., 2022) or was even exceeded (Morales et al., 2021: α = 0.90; Roberts et al., 2020a: α = 0.92). For the AEQ, no measure of internal consistency is provided as yet.

## Psychological Correlates

Several studies have investigated which personality traits are associated with ASMR using correlational analyses. With regard to the Big Five (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1988), ASMR correlates positively with Openness-toExperience (B. Fredborg et al., 2017; Janik McErlean&amp;Banissy,2017;Robertsetal.,2020b) and Neuroticism (Eid et al., 2022; B. Fredborg et al., 2017), but negatively with Conscientiousness (B. Fredborg et al., 2017; Janik McErlean &amp; Banissy, 2017, Roberts et al., 2020b), Agreeableness (B. Fredborg et al., 2017), and Extraversion (B. Fredborg et al., 2017). Besides the Big Five, some other personality related constructs have been linked to ASMR, such as increased sensory processing sensitivity (G. L. Poerio et al., 2022; Roberts et al., 2020b), heightened cognitive reappraisal scores (Morales et al., 2021), higher trait anxiety (Eid et al., 2022), and more pronounced self-rated empathy (Janik McErlean &amp; Banissy, 2017).

Regarding mindfulness, contradictory results emerge in different studies. One study (B. K. Fredborg et al., 2018) shows signi /uniFB01 cantly higher mindfulness-scores in ASMR-responders. In this study, this refers on the one hand to the ability to be aware of and pay attention to the present moment (assessed with the Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale [MAAS]; Brown &amp; Ryan, 2003) and on the other hand to curiosity about sensations, thoughts and emotions that arise when being in a mindful state (Toronto Mindfulness Scale [TMS]; Lau et al., 2006). On the other hand, Janik McErlean and Osborne-Ford (2020) report no correlation between mindfulness and ASMR (for ASMRresponders) while Roberts et al. (2021) report a negative correlation. In both studies, the MAAS was again used.

Given that ASMR is a somewhat complex phenomenon, it is also interesting to investigate how ASMR is related to similar experiences, for example, frisson (i.e., pleasant shivers or chills that can be triggered by movies, music or video games; Kovacevich &amp; Huron, 2019), misophonia (i.e., the negative reaction to speci /uniFB01 c sound patterns and/or sounds occurring in certain settings or situations; Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff, 2014) or synesthesia (i.e., the phenomenon of experiencing perceptions in a sensory modality triggered by a stimulus from a different sensory modality; Casini, 2017). Although it is discussed that ASMR is a component of frisson (Koumura et al., 2021) or vice versa (Honda et al., 2020), correlation analyses do not support this assumption (Roberts et al., 2019, 2020a). Examining the association between ASMR and misophonia, inconsistent results emerge, with one study revealing a relationship (Janik McErlean &amp; Banissy, 2018; ASMR-responders), which could not be con /uniFB01 rmed in the another study (Roberts et al., 2019; ASMR interest group). No study retrieved in the search conducted for this systematic review examined a possible correlation between ASMR and synesthesia.

Furthermore, until now, when it comes to mere correlational approaches, ASMR experience has not been correlated with any mental healthrelated variables. However, a number of associations between ASMR and mental health-related variables have been uncovered in the context of short-term interventions, which are presented in the Intervention Studies section.

## Neural and Physiological Correlates

## Neural Correlates

With regard to the possible neural underpinnings of ASMR, both EEG (seven studies, B. K. Fredborg et al., 2021; M. Lee et al., 2019; Paszkiel et al., 2020; Pedrini et al., 2021; Seifzadeh et al., 2021; Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2020) and fMRI studies (seven studies, S. Lee et al., 2020; Lochte et al., 2018; Sakurai et al., 2021; S. D. Smith et al., 2017; S. D. Smithet al., 2019a, 2019b, 2020) were carried out on the phenomenon. In the ASMR-related EEG studies, recording was always performed during ASMRstimulation.It has not been attempted as yet to obtain a speci /uniFB01 c EEG resting-state activation pattern for ASMR-responderscomparedtoASMRnonresponders. The results appear largely inconsistent so far, with some tentative suggestions of possible decreases in the δ band during ASMR stimulation. In the following paragraphs, the results will be described separately for the different frequency bands with the order of the discussion re /uniFB02 ecting the consistency of the evidence addressing the respective frequency band.

Only one study analyzing δ waves, M. Lee et al. (2019) investigating 15 participants and comparing brain activity during ASMR sound stimulation (among other conditions) to a restingstate baseline, yields no changes in δ power during ASMR stimulation. All other four studies (Pedrini et al., 2021; Seifzadeh et al., 2021; Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2020) that explicitly investigated the in /uniFB02 uence of ASMR on δ powershowadecreasein δ activity. However, it has to be noted that both Tian et al. (2020) and Seifzadeh et al. (2021) investigated a very low number of participants (four vs. one). They compared the respective brain activities postASMR stimulation to a resting-state period as baseline. Both studies reveal a globally declined δ band. Involving a more sizable number of participants ( n = 26), Swart, Banissy, et al. (2022) compared how the EEG pattern differs between a self-reported unchanged state (baseline) compared to self-reported ASMR experience, yielding a decrease of δ speci /uniFB01 cally in prefrontal areas. Finally, Pedrini et al. (2021) compared brain activity while watching ASMR videos not only to a resting-state condition as baseline but also to brain activity while watching

three different other video types (high arousal, low arousal, control; n = 76). Interestingly, they show lower δ values for watching ASMR videos compared to the three other video types used, but not in comparison to the resting-state condition.

α waves were assessed in seven studies (B. K. Fredborgetal., 2021; M. Lee et al., 2019; Paszkiel et al., 2020; Pedrini et al., 2021; Seifzadeh et al., 2021; Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2020). The previously mentioned studies by Tian et al. (2020) and Seifzadeh et al. (2021) involving very small sample sizes reveal a signi /uniFB01 cant α increase post-ASMR versus resting state (Seifzadeh et al., 2021, especially in the central region). However, Seifzadeh et al. (2021) also report an α band power decrease in the occipital region. Again involving a small sample ( n = 9), Paszkiel et al. (2020) used music triggering ASMR and compared it to three different conditions during which EEG recordings were carried out (relaxing music, rap music, and silence). Additionally, they included a phase during which a stressor was applied, with silence serving as the baseline condition. They state that the Mean α Wave Amplitude Value (calculated comparing the difference between the ' music listening phase ' and the ' stressor phase ' to the phase before the measurement) is signi /uniFB01 cantly higher during the ASMR-triggering condition and the relaxing music condition compared to the rap music condition and silence. This means that ASMRandmusic can relax participants even to a calmer state than before the stressor.

Forthe studies with larger sample sizes ranging between n = 15and n = 76, an inconsistent pattern of results emerges with regard to α waves (two studies suggesting an increase and two studies a decrease of α waves): Swart, Banissy, et al. (2022) reveal a global increase in α power during the self-perceived ASMR experience (ASMR compared to baseline). B. K. Fredborg et al. (2021) conducted an EEG study contrasting ASMR audio-only stimuli as well as ASMR audiovisual stimuli with control audio as well as with a pre-ASMR stimulation phase (baseline). With regard to both contrasts, they report signi /uniFB01 cant increases in α power for ASMRresponders when ASMR audios were used, but in different regions (for the contrast with control audio: especially near the left cuneus and in frontal areas; for the contrast with pre-ASMR stimulation: in broad frontal areas, right medial frontal regions and left medial frontal regions).

Remarkably, however, two /uniFB01 ndings involving sample sizes ranging between n = 15 and n = 76 appear contradictory with regard to α waves: Pedrini et al. (2021) found that ASMR videos were associated with lower α compared to two other video types used (low arousal, control). M. Leeet al. (2019) showed a decrease of α powerfor both ASMR and binaural beat as well as for a combination of binaural beat and ASMR compared to a sham condition (silent stimulus, baseline).

With regard to theta waves (assessed by B. K. Fredborg et al., 2021; M. Lee et al., 2019; Pedrini et al., 2021; Seifzadeh et al., 2021; Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2020), most studies -three studies with sample sizes between n = 15 and n = 28 (B. K. Fredborg et al., 2021; M. Lee et al., 2019; Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022) and one case study (Seifzadeh et al., 2021) -/uniFB01 nd no associations with increases or decreases in theta power. However, in the study by Pedrini et al. (2021) including 76 participants lower theta values are reported for ASMR videos compared to one other video condition (low arousal). Also, Tian et al. (2020), including a small sample size, report a decrease of theta waves during ASMR stimulation.

γ waves were assessed by B. K. Fredborg et al. (2021), M. Lee et al. (2019), Pedrini et al. (2021), Seifzadeh et al. (2021) and Swart, Banissy, et al. (2022). Again, contradictory results emerge. Comparing ASMR to the control audios, B. K. Fredborg et al. (2021) identify a signi /uniFB01 cant increase in γ power(onlyforASMRparticipants). Also, the single case study by Seifzadeh et al. (2021) shows increased γ post-ASMR stimulation in comparison to pre-ASMR stimulation (central region, frontoparietal regions). Pedrini et

In terms of β waves, which were assessed in the studies by M. Lee et al. (2019), Pedrini et al. (2021), Seifzadeh et al. (2021), Swart, Banissy, et al. (2022) and Tian et al. (2020) again contradictory results emerge. The two studies involving very small sample sizes (Seifzadeh et al., 2021; Tian et al., 2020) report a (general) increase in the β band frequency. Pedrini et al. (2021), on the other hand, report associations between ASMR andlowerlow(butnothigh) β values compared to all other video types. For the other studies, with regard to the β waves, no difference emerges between ASMR and the respective baseline conditions (M. Lee et al., 2019; Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022).

al. (2021) report lower γ values during ASMR compared to two other videos used (low arousal, control). M. Lee et al. (2019) and Swart, Banissy, et al. (2022), on the other hand, state that γ wave activity did not differ during ASMR stimulation compared to the other content used (M. Lee et al., 2019) or compared to the baseline condition (Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022).

With regard to the fMRI investigations related to ASMR, according to our systematic search, a total of seven relevant studies were retrieved, with two different methodological foci: Either attempting to uncover a link between speci /uniFB01 c, isolated brain areas with ASMR stimulation (Lochte et al., 2018; Sakurai et al., 2021; S. D. Smith et al., 2019a) or investigating functional connectivity between multiple brain areas (S. Lee et al., 2020; S. D. Smith et al., 2017; S. D. Smith et al., 2019b; S. D. Smith et al., 2020).

With regard to the link between ASMR sensation and speci /uniFB01 c brain areas, it should /uniFB01 rst be mentioned that in the study by Sakurai et al. (2021) no ASMR experience occurred during ASMRstimulation, meaning that no conclusions can be made about the relationship between ASMR experience and speci /uniFB01 c brain areas. For the remaining two studies, it can be summarized that Lochte et al. (2018) involved ASMR stimulation with the participants identifying speci /uniFB01 c episodes of relaxation and tingling. S. D. Smith et al. (2019a) contrasted ASMR stimulation induced by ASMR videos with control videos which were not likely to elicit ASMR. While Lochte et al. (2018) only tested ten ASMR-responders (without implementing a control group), S. D. Smith et al. (2019a) compared 17 ASMR-responders with 17 age- and sex-matched controls. Even though both studies used different contrasts and different methodological approaches, it is still evident that for ASMR-responders, both studies reveal associations between ASMR and the anterior cingulate gyrus, as well as between ASMR and movement-related regions. Thus, at least some indication of reliability of the /uniFB01 ndings is provided.

With regard to the functional connectivity, ASMR-responders appear to exhibit lower functional connectivity in numerous networks when compared to ASMR-nonresponders (e.g., the salience network, the visual network and the default mode network; S. D. Smith et al., 2017; S. D. Smith et al., 2019b). Moreover, during ASMR stimulation, functional connectivity can apparently be altered between different brain areas (e.g., between the posterior cingulate cortex and the superior temporal gyrus; S. Lee et al., 2020), with increased functional connectivity being revealed when a seed-based analysis was used (S. Lee et al., 2020) and decreased functional connectivity when using an independentcomponents analysis technique (S. D. Smith et al., 2020). In the study by S. D. Smith et al. (2020), differences in functional connectivity are associated with sensitivity differences to different ASMR triggers.

## Physiological Evidence

To /uniFB01 nd out whether there are physiological markers associated with watching ASMR videos or listening to ASMR audios, several experimental studies have been conducted, and some diversity in the assessments has already emerged. It was shown that ASMR is associated with a decrease in heart rate (Ahn et al., 2019; Ahn, 2020; Idayati et al., 2021; Paszkiel et al., 2020; G. L. Poerio et al., 2018), a reduction of blood pressure (Ahn et al., 2019; Ahn, 2020; Idayati et al., 2021; Paszkiel et al., 2020), and an increase in pupil diameter (Pedrini et al., 2021; Valtakari et al., 2019). In the study by G. L. Poerio et al. (2018), it was also revealed that skin conductance level was increased while watching ASMR videos for ASMR-responders but not for ASMR-nonresponders. Only one study investigated the respiratory rate while watching ASMR videos without being able to show an effect (Idayati et al., 2021).

## Intervention Studies

When it comes to short-term interventions presenting ASMR stimuli on only 1 day, ASMR appears to have an in /uniFB02 uence on several mental health-related aspects. For example, ASMR is associated with improved mood scores (Smejka &amp; Wiggs, 2022; in ASMR-responders), increased pleasant affect (G. L. Poerio et al., 2018; in ASMR-responders), and decreased state anxiety (Eid et al., 2022; in ASMRresponders). In contrast, Yusaira and Bennett (2021) report on ASMR being associated with a decrease of positive feelings like joy or love and with more sleepiness. Importantly, in this study, no distinction between ASMR-responders and

nonresponders could be made. Again not differentiating between ASMR-responders and nonresponders, M. Lee et al. (2019) state that ASMRstimulation was related to improvements of psychological stability (e.g., less anger, more calmness, more happiness). Sakurai et al. (2021), examined only participants who did not experience ASMR, reporting that stimulation with ASMR audios was not related to higher comfort related mood scores.

With regard to short-term interventions investigating cognitive functions, ASMR has been linked to improved short-term memory scores in a sample not distinguishing between ASMRresponders and nonresponders (Kim et al., 2019, only when auditory stimuli were presented), but also to reduced set shifting and inhibition abilities (executive functioning) in ASMR-responders (X. Wang et al., 2020). These results show that some cognitive functions might bene /uniFB01 t from an ASMR stimulation, but on the other hand, ASMR could also have a negative effect on higher order executive control functions.

Another construct that has been investigated in a short-term intervention study is mindfulness. Maniago et al. (2021) -who again used the MAAS which was also employed in mindfulness correlation studies -compared the effects of different ASMR triggers. They found that whispering and auditory ASMR triggers are associated with higher mindfulness scores compared to personal attention triggers.

To date, there is only one ASMR intervention study that has repeatedly exposed participants to ASMR stimuli repeatedly across several days (Ditchburn &amp; Bedwell, 2019). In this study, healthy participants watched ASMR videos for 10 -30 min every day for 1 week. Two groups were compared: One watching mindfulness videos and a passive control group where no intervention was implemented. As outcome measures anxiety, depression, and psychological well-being were assessed. Compared to the control groups, no signi /uniFB01 cant improvements were revealed in the ASMR group. Consequently, even though /uniFB01 rst indications emerge that ASMR can be associated with short-term improvements in mental healthassociated domains, there is no evidence so far that ASMR is also associated with mid- or long-term effects which could best be detected in comprehensive randomized controlled trials.

## Discussion

## Evaluation and Interpretation of the Results

## De nition and Assessment Tools /uniFB01

As stated in the results section, when de /uniFB01 ning ASMRthemajority of articles refer to Barratt and Davis (2015). However, a lot of authors deviate from the original description of ASMR provided by Barratt and Davis in several ways. Unlike Barratt and Davis ' original description, the ASMR experience is mostly not described as a phenomenon that takes place on the skin (only four more articles include the speci /uniFB01 cation of a skin-related localization of the ASMR experience: Kovacevich &amp; Huron, 2019; Maniago et al., 2021; Rouw &amp; Erfanian, 2018; Valtakari et al., 2019) and the body parts on which the ASMR sensation occurs sometimes differ from the ones named by Barratt and Davis (2015).

The other de /uniFB01 nitional components which refer to the feelings associated with ASMR (e.g., psychological stability, calmness, euphoria), described in other articles than that by Barratt and Davis (2015) and presented in the results section, have a rather vague character. However, this is also the case for relaxation or well-being (being related to ASMR) as described by Barratt and Davis (2015) and therefore these terms might as well be under consideration when it comes to a more comprehensive ASMR de /uniFB01 nition.

With regard to the triggers that elicit ASMR, there is de /uniFB01 nitely also a need for further speci /uniFB01 cation. For example, nearly all /uniFB01 ndings on the topic of ASMR triggers conducted so far have been obtained on the margins of other research questions, and there is only one study that exclusively addressed ASMR trigger evaluation (Barratt et al., 2017). A major problem in the systematic evaluation of ASMR triggers is that people who experience ASMR obviously react very differently to triggers, so that even in the future it will hardly be possible to provide generally valid information about potential reliable ASMR triggers. In addition, people may not respond identically to speci /uniFB01 c ASMR triggers at all times during the day or depending ontheir emotional state, thus further complicating scienti /uniFB01 c evaluation. Nevertheless, it is important to broaden the knowledge gained so far with regard to reliable ASMR triggers on the basis of larger samples in order to derive further at least

probability-based conclusions about which triggers are most likely associated with ASMR. In addition, critically, ASMR triggers have so far been considered in an isolated manner, that is independently of the person interacting with the triggers. An attempt should be made to evaluate whether the trigger effectiveness is in /uniFB02 uenced by the person who is trying to trigger the ASMR in another person. Possible relevant factors could be: gender, sympathy, professionalism, variety in interaction with the stimulus, etc.

Discussing the instruments that are supposed to assess ASMR, it can /uniFB01 rst be stated that the ASMR15 and the AEQ have both their strengths and weaknesses. The ASMR-15 does not take a lot of time, is very /uniFB02 exible, can be conducted either online or of /uniFB02 ine and can always be applied to new ASMR videos. The AEQ can determine much moreprecisely whichparts of the body are affected by ASMR. Furthermore, the AEQ was especially designed to distinguish between people who experience ASMR and those who do not.

A potential shortcoming of the ASMR-15 is that, overall, it may not evaluate the ASMR experience speci /uniFB01 cally enough: Only a few items refer to the core ASMR experience de /uniFB01 ned in the results section, while many of the items are nonspeci /uniFB01 c (e.g., ' I feel relaxed ' ). Another critical aspect in relation to the ASMR-15, which could, however, be resolved by a small adjustment by the authors, is that the instruction of the ASMR-15 in its current form may be too short: it refers exclusively to nonspeci /uniFB01 c sounds ( ' WhenI hear certain sounds, such as whispering, crinkling, tapping ' ). Consequently, it does not relate to a social component that is inherent in most ASMR videos. Correspondingly, a study conductedbyLohausetal.(2023)suggeststhat social cues might indeed play an important role in generating the ASMR experience. The study showed that ASMR videos (obviously associated with a social component with the ASMR performer being seen throughout the videos) are associated with signi /uniFB01 cantly more ASMR experience than the so-called walking tour videos in which the social component is less prominent. In walking tour videos, people /uniFB01 lm their walkthrough different locations from a /uniFB01 rst-person perspective and allow the viewer to participate. Comparable to ASMR videos, they also contain sounds that could potentially be experienced as pleasant, such as rustling leaves, rain, or urban sounds. Correspondingly, Shimokura (2022)

demonstrated that human-generated sounds are more likely to induce ASMR when compared to nature-generated sounds again hinting at the importance of a social component of ASMR content for the generation of ASMR.

Furthermore, the ASMR-15 leaves out a visual component, although it has been shown in a preprint by Tada et al. (2021) which was excluded in the results section due to speci /uniFB01 cations made after the systematic search that the combination of video and audio ASMR content is more likely to trigger ASMR compared to audio-only stimuli. A shortcoming of the AEQ, on the other hand is that the selection of integrated ASMR videos could be muchmoreversatile, with certain types of ASMR triggers being left out, while other types of ASMR triggers are overrepresented.

Although the ASMR-15 and the AEQ appear to be reliable and valid instruments to assess ASMR, in fact, the previous studies rarely incorporated these instruments. Seven studies retrieved in this systematic review included the ASMR-15 (Morales et al., 2021; Pedrini et al., 2021; G. L. Poerio et al., 2022; Roberts et al., 2019, 2020a, 2020b, 2021) and only two (Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022) the AEQ. It is important to note, however, that several of the studies were conducted when the questionnaires did not yet exist (the /uniFB01 rst study on ASMR-15 was published in 2019, Roberts et al., 2019; the /uniFB01 rst study involving the AEQ in 2021, Swart, Bowling, et al., 2022). In designing future studies, the two assessment tools presented in this systematic review should be used more frequently and should be adapted to ensure that ASMR experience is appropriately operationalized.

## Psychological Correlates

Regarding the association between ASMR and personality, the main focus in research so far has been on the Big Five (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1988), which certainly provides good initial evidence, but only partially circumscribes the multifaceted personality of human individuals. Other, more comprehensive measures of personality that could be correlated with ASMR are, for example, the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (Cattell &amp; Mead, 2008; involving additional personality factors such as warmth, sensitivity or tension) and the more clinically oriented Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory

(Butcher, 2010; involving e.g., social introversion). While there is preliminary (albeit contradictory) evidence regarding a relationship between ASMR and mindfulness, the relationship between ASMR and the ability to engage in other techniques associated with relaxation such as yoga, PMR, and AT remains unexplored. It wouldbeparticularly interesting to know whether people who use other relaxation techniques are also ASMR-responders, or whether ASMR content might be an alternative for people who have not had success with other relaxation techniques before.

Concerning other constructs related to ASMR, the /uniFB01 ndings indicate that it is not always clear how to distinguish ASMR from other constructs (frisson, misophonia, synesthesia). In the systematic search for this review, no study was revealed that associated ASMR with synesthesia. However, since there is obvious overlap between ASMRandsynesthesia (e.g., the fact that they are both multisensory phenomena, each triggered by speci /uniFB01 c stimuli), it is currently discussed that ASMR might be driven by synesthetic mechanisms, but more research is still needed to examine the extent to which the two constructs can be distinguished from each other (G. Poerio et al., 2022). With future investigations of what characterizes ASMR more speci /uniFB01 cally, more insights on the association between ASMR and similar constructs will be generated.

Furthermore, until now there are no studies examining the relationship between ASMR and social cognition, apart from empathy. However, given that social cues might be important for triggering ASMR(see De /uniFB01 nition and Assessment Tools section), this would de /uniFB01 nitely be interesting to be investigated in more detail. For example, a link between ASMR experience and data obtained via emotion recognition instruments (e.g., the Geneva emotion recognition test by Schlegel et al., 2014), and also Theory of Mind (ToM) instruments (e.g., the ' Reading the Mind in the Eyes ' Test by Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) or instruments assessing social problem solving (e.g., the social problem-solving task by Channon &amp; Crawford, 2010) would be conceivable.

## Neural and Physiological Evidence

In summary, with regard to neural and physiological underpinnings of ASMR, it can be stated that promising initial evidence has already been gained via EEG, fMRI, and physiological measures. Although EEG /uniFB01 ndings are rather heterogeneous, several studies tentatively suggest δ wave decreases in association with ASMR. Furthermore, there are fMRI backed associations between ASMR experience and activations of the anterior cingulate gyrus as well as movement-related brain areas (which could also be shown in at least two independent studies), atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction.

With regard to the EEG related /uniFB01 ndings, it is not obvious why a δ -wave decrease occurs in several studies, especially since δ -waves have until recently been associated with deep sleep in particular (Dang-Vu et al., 2005). However, δ -waves also relate to consciousness (Frohlich et al., 2021) -perhaps those states of consciousness that are associated with relaxation, since a corresponding δ -wave decrease has also been shown during meditation (Young &amp; Taylor, 1998). Despite these interesting /uniFB01 rst implications regarding EEG data, there are several methodological concerns that have to be resolved in future studies. It should, for example, be noted that not all typically investigated EEG frequency bands were examined in all studies, clearly biasing the report. Furthermore, in one study only a single participant was included (Seifzadeh et al., 2021). Moreover, in one case, the overall quality of the article is to be regarded as very low (score = 1 out of 11) according to risk of bias and quality analysis (Tian et al., 2020). It should also be noted that in the EEG studies, the distinction between ASMR-responders and ASMR-nonresponders was only implemented in the study by B. K. Fredborg et al. (2021).

With regard to the reliable associations between speci /uniFB01 c brain areas and ASMR, the emerging pattern of results does not yet provide enough informative value. Regarding the anterior cingulate gyrus, it appears to be dif /uniFB01 cult to interpret why it might be associated with ASMR experience. One possible reason could be (since the anterior cingulate gyrus has been linked to the salience network) that the anterior cingulate gyrus facilitates attention processes related to an external stimulus the ASMR experience is usually associated with (S. D. Smith et al., 2019a). The fact that motoric regions of the cortex are activated during ASMR experience suggests that ASMR is rather a sensorimotor, and not a

psychosomatic phenomenon (S. D. Smith et al., 2019a). Future studies should examine in more detail whether there are other speci /uniFB01 c brain areas or parts of brain areas associated with ASMR, as the brain area pattern described in this systematic review appears rather nonspeci /uniFB01 c. Also, it should be elucidated further how functional connectivity patterns are altered with ASMR experience, potentially in associations with interindividual differences in sensitivity to ASMR triggers (S. Lee et al., 2020; S. D. Smith et al., 2017; S. D. Smith et al., 2019b).

With regard to the physiological markers and ASMR, the most pronounced effect of ASMRreducing heart rate appears very plausible considering its relaxation potential. Still, it must be stated that other important physiological markers have not been investigated at all so far (e.g., heart rate variability or cortisol levels) or have only very rarely been investigated (e.g., respiratory rate or skin conductance level). Furthermore, several methodological issues must be considered in the future: In three studies presented in the results section, it is not stated whether the heart rate decrease was statistically signi /uniFB01 cant (Ahn et al., 2019; Ahn, 2020; Paszkiel et al., 2020), and the study conducted by Idayati et al. (2021) did not involve a control group or control condition. Blood pressure reduction was addressed in the same four studies with the described methodological shortcomings.

## Intervention Studies

First, but still limited and sometimes contradictory evidence for the short-term effects of ASMR particularly on various mental health variables (e.g., mood, Smejka &amp; Wiggs, 2022) was revealed. Given the pattern of results, it is evident that short-term ASMR effects are to be expected for ASMR-responders in particular (Eid et al., 2022; G. L. Poerio et al., 2018; Smejka &amp; Wiggs, 2022). If, on the other hand, no distinction is made between ASMR-responders and ASMRnonresponders or only ASMR-nonresponders are included, two out of three studies (Sakurai et al., 2021; Yusaira &amp; Bennett, 2021) show no positive short-term effects of ASMR on mental healthassociated outcomes.

Moreover, it must be stated at this point that several mental health-related domains have not been investigated as yet, both in terms of typical psychopathological symptoms (e.g., in relation to more speci /uniFB01 c anxiety-related domains such as panic disorder or social anxiety as well as somatization etc.) and in terms of positive psychological constructs (e.g., quality of life and meaningfulness).

Also, /uniFB01 rst evidence emerged concerning a possible short-term in /uniFB02 uence of ASMR on cognitive domains. Associations with improvements in short-term memory performance might be explained by the fact that there is a link between positive emotions and learning/memory with ASMR-triggering positive emotions (Kim et al., 2019). The negative relationship between ASMRandexecutive functioning could be due to the fact that the positive emotions associated with ASMR may inhibit executive functioning. Without involving ASMR, the inhibitory effect of positive emotions on executive function has, for example, been shown for the Stroop test (Phillips et al., 2002), which was also used in the study revealing the negative relationship between ASMR and executive functioning (X. Wang et al., 2020).

Importantly, one aspect that has hardly been investigated so far relates to the mid- and longterm effects of ASMR on various psychological domains. The only intervention involving repeated ASMR stimulation for 7 days shows clear limitations (Ditchburn &amp; Bedwell, 2019). For example, the ASMR videos in this study have not been comprehensively preevaluated. Furthermore, it was not possible to switch between different ASMR videos at any time during the intervention and to choose from a larger pool of videos, although this seems very important due to the large interindividual differences in terms of the suitable triggers. In addition, in the aforementioned intervention study, the time span of the intervention was rather short (1 week) and no follow-up investigation was conducted. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of appropriate control stimuli that can be used in comparison with ASMR stimuli has not yet been carried out, so that until now the choice of control stimuli to be used as a comparison to ASMR stimuli seems to be rather arbitrary. Most importantly, in the study by Ditchburn and Bedwell (2019), no distinction was made between ASMR-responders and ASMRnonresponders, although evidence suggests that consideration of responder type is important, as results may differ fundamentally between ASMRresponders and ASMR-nonresponders (see

e.g., Lohaus et al., 2023). Future studies ought to address these shortcomings when it comes to evaluating whether or not ASMR stimulation can be regarded an effective mid- or long-term intervention tool.

## Limitations of Evidence

With regard to the limitations of evidence, several weaknesses appear in a number of studies/articles. A quantitative overview of the quality of the studies/articles can be found in Table 2. Considering Table 2, it becomes clear that the following aspects in particular need to be critically discussed with regard to the retrieved studies/articles: Often it remains unclear, which inclusion criteria were applied making it dif /uniFB01 cult to judge whether the /uniFB01 ndings that already exist with respect to ASMR are generalizable or only relate to a very speci /uniFB01 c sample. Confounding factors were rarely mentioned or dealt with (e.g., the presence of additional conditions that may be dif /uniFB01 cult to distinguish from ASMR such as goose bumps or frisson). Moreover, clearly differentiated hypotheses, which are referred to in the course of the articles, were rarely stated. On the other hand, as can be inferred from Table 2, strengths of the majority of studies/articles involve the outcomes being measured in a valid and reliable way, appropriate statistical analysis being used and the main results of the study being immediately identi /uniFB01 able from the abstract.

It should be noted that a relatively short instrument (with 5 out of the 11 items assessing the writing of the article, but not the research conducted) was used for the assessment of risk of bias in order to keep the amount of ratings within a manageable range, although other instruments exist that evaluate risk of bias even more comprehensively and could have also been used for the evaluation of the ASMR studies with minor adaptations (e.g., the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies; Downes et al., 2016). This could have made the evaluation of risk of bias even more precise. Furthermore, the evaluation of certainty assessment, which is included in several PRISMA-guided reviews, was omitted for the assessment of limitations of evidence, as the commonly used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach operates at an outcome level (Balshem et al., 2011), with the outcomes being so diverse in this review that no meaningful overview could have been achieved. Nevertheless, our chosen approach -especially in combination with the items on article quality added by the research team -provides a good overview evaluating which ASMR-related studies/articles already meet important criteria with regard to methodological quality.

Apart from the results regarding methodological quality of the studies/articles already presented in Table 2, in terms of the study design, several additions can be made that are not applicable to all studies and have thus been omitted from the rating conducted in relation to Table 2. First, it has to be pointed out that blinding approaches have hardly been described in the reviewed studies. Only in two studies, a single-blind procedure was implemented (Maniago et al., 2021; Yusaira &amp; Bennett, 2021), and in one study, a double-blind approach was followed (Idayati et al., 2021). It is also not apparent from any of the articles uncovered in this systematic review that subjects were initially blinded to the study or study condition and then unblinded as they progressed. Furthermore, experimenter-induced bias was discussed and dealt with in only one article (Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022). Therefore, even beyond the results presented in Table 2, there is further reason to believe that future ASMR studies can be signi /uniFB01 cantly improved with regard to their study designs.

Furthermore, it should be considered that so far, classi /uniFB01 cations into ASMR-responders and ASMR-nonresponders have exclusively been based on self-assessments, as no objective operationalization of ASMR-responders and ASMR-nonresponders (e.g., via EEG or fMRI) is available yet. In the studies discussed in this systematic review, the usual procedure used to classify ASMR-responders and ASMRnonresponders was to show one or more ASMR videos, followed by a questionnaire, a single item, or verbal questions that were meant to gauge the ability to experience ASMR (Eid et al., 2022; B. Fredborg et al., 2017, 2018; B. K. Fredborg et al., 2021; Liu &amp; Zhou, 2019; G. L. Poerio et al., 2018; G. L. Poerio et al., 2022; S. D. Smith et al., 2017; S. D. Smith et al., 2019a, 2019b; Valtakari et al., 2019; X. Wang et al., 2020). In a few studies, the presentation of an ASMR video prior to an ASMR questionnaire/interview was not included, meaning that

participants were not able to directly verify whether or not they were experiencing ASMR, but were only asked to assess their expectations based on a description of ASMR (Janik McErlean &amp; Banissy, 2017; Janik McErlean &amp; Banissy, 2018; Janik McErlean &amp; OsborneFord, 2020; Morales et al., 2021; Palmer-Cooper et al., 2022). In these cases, misclassi /uniFB01 cation is likely to have occurred more frequently than in the studies in which one or more ASMR videos were shown before the self-report. Therefore, in future studies, until a more objective way of classi /uniFB01 cation into ASMR-responders and non-ASMR-responders is possible, it should be ensured that the self-report is as comprehensive as possible and that participants can immediately self-evaluate their ASMR experience by always showing at least one ASMR video (which would e.g., be warranted when using the AEQ).

One general aspect that is frequently discussed with regard to ASMR and might have an impact on the evidence uncovered to date but has rarely been scienti /uniFB01 cally investigated is the link between ASMR and expectancy effects. The notion that viewing ASMR videos is associated with expectations to feel a characteristic ASMR experience is suggested by the study of Cash et al. (2018), showing that people who have never watched an ASMR video are highly manipulable via an ASMR instruction that predicts a characteristic ASMR feeling. By contrast, experienced ASMR video consumers are not manipulable, suggesting that the role of expectancy effects in relation to ASMR might be rather complex,is not yet fully clari /uniFB01 edandshouldthus be evaluated in future studies examining ASMR.

Overall, we conclude that, because ASMR research is still in its infancy, there are still some uncertainties regarding the adequate operationalization of ASMR(e.g.,self-reportonlyandpossible in /uniFB02 uence of expectancy effects) that should be considered in future research. In addition, not all ASMR-related research meets high scienti /uniFB01 c standards. Thus, the results and interpretations are to be treated with caution (see Table 2), although no particularly contradictory or questionable /uniFB01 ndings from these studies were uncovered during the preparation of the systematic review. Apart from the more general problems related to the ASMR operationalization, this systematic review shows that studies related to ASMR have presented interesting, diverse results that warrant further scienti /uniFB01 cevaluation ofASMR.

## Limitations of Our Systematic Review

In addition to the limitations of our systematic review with respect to the assessment of the limitations of evidence, which have already been discussed in the previous section, two more general issues will be presented at this point. First of all, the inclusion criteria for the review were very broad, so that (pretty much) all studies that have been conducted so far with regard to the topic of ASMR were initially included. This way, an initial general overview is achieved for readers who are interested in ASMR research, but it also means that some study results could not be discussed at all to keep the overview focused and precise. Even articles of rather poor methodological quality were included. The decision to keep the articles as a part of the systematic review was made since even if the overall methodological quality of certain articles is not considered particularly high, these articles were still undergoing peer-review, may inspire future ASMR researchers in terms of their research and can still contribute to the evaluation of ASMR in a descriptive manner (e.g., Table 3).

Furthermore, despite the broad scope of the systematic review, it is still possible that individual studies are not included in this review, for example, due to lack of publication of nonsigni /uniFB01 cant /uniFB01 ndings. No estimate for publication bias could be determined in the course of the preparation of the systematic review. Overall, however, our systematic review still provides a comprehensive initial overview of the ASMR phenomenon. The fact that ASMR is one of the most searched terms on YouTube and thus on one of the most visited websites on the internet re /uniFB02 ects the massive worldwide interest in ASMR. The scienti /uniFB01 c community must not sleep on this trending topic and should conduct more fundamental research as well as intervention studies with regard to this phenomenon, taking into consideration this systematic review, which provides an overview of current ASMR research.
