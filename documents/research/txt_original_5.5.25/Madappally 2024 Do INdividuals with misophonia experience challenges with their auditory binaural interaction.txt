Highlights:  
 DCV and Masking level difference were measured in mild and moderate misophonia  
 Binaural integration and interaction skills are unaffected in misophonia  
 
ABSTRACT  
Background and Aim:  Misophonia is a condition marked by heightened sensitivity and intense emotional and 
physiological responses to particular sounds that  may not spark the same reactions in others. This study is the 
first of its kind to assess binaural integration and binaural interaction in misophonia.  
Methods:  Thirty  misophonia and 30 control participants were considered in the age range of 18 to 30 years. All 
the participants had hearing sensitivity within normal limits  and normal middle ear function . Individuals with a 
history of otological complaints, noise exposur e, ototoxic medications, tinnitus, hyperacusis, diabetes, or 
hypertension were excluded from the study. Misophonia severity was assessed using the Misophonia Assessment 
Questionnaire  (MAQ) . Binaural integration was assessed using Dichotic Consonant  Vowel ( DCV ) test, and 
binaural interaction was assessed using Masking Level Difference (MLD).  
Results:  The statistical analysis of the i ndependent t -test for DCV and Mann Whitney U test for MLD showed 
no significant difference between misophonia and the control group for both MLD and DCV.  
Conclusion:  The results suggest that the re is no significant difference in DCV and MLD scores between the 
control and misophonia groups.

Introduction

Misophonia is a disorder characterized by negative physiological or emotional reactions in response to particular 
sounds that do  not cause annoyance  [1] Schröder et al.  [2] proposed diagnostic criteria for misophonia, including 
extreme behavioral or physiological response to the presence or anticipation of certain sounds, anger, loss of self -
control, and avoidance of misophonic sound situations. In other words , misophonia is  hatred or decreased 
tolerance to particular  sounds that may be normal for others. The reactions to the sound depend on the physical 
properties of the sound and the environment in which it is presented.  Triggering sounds could be chewing , metal 
scraping, h igh-frequency insect chirping,  etc. [2-5]. The reactions to triggering sounds could be anger, irritation, 
increased heart rate, sweating, anxiety , etc. Neuroimaging studies  show ed cortical generators involved in 
misophonia generation. H yperactivation of the right insula, right anterior angulate cortex , and right superior 
temporal cortex was seen when misophonic individuals were exposed to triggering audiovisual input compared 
to neutral video clips  [6, 7] In addition , Aryal and Prabhu [8] proposed a neuro biological model of Misophonia 
generation, where they hint at the central auditory involvement in addition to the other cortical areas  (such as 
those involved in emotion or psychological distress) . 
Central Auditory Processing (CAP) is the ability to perceptually receive stimuli within the Central Auditory 
Nervous System  (CANS) and conduct the subsequent neurobiological activities that give rise to the 
electrophysiological auditory action potentials  [9]. Auditory  processing incl udes temporal processing, binaural 
interaction, fusion, integration,  separation , and auditory closure. Binaural integration is when  the patient has to 
repeat stimuli in both ears  [9]. Difficulties faced by individuals with binaural integration deficits include having 
trouble taking notes, processing more than one modality concurrently , or listening to two persons simultaneously.  
Binaural interaction refers to the task where the CANS interprets  stimuli presented simultaneously to both ears  
[10]. This proc ess occurs at the brainstem level, where information from both ears is  processed.  
Conventionally , binaural interaction is assessed through Masking Level Difference  (MLD) , while binaural 
integration abilities are measured using the Dichotic Consonant Vowel (DCV) test [11]. MLD  describes how the 
phase of either the signal or the noise at the two ears can be changed to improve the perception of a signal when 
a masker is present  [12]. ‘o’ indicates when the signal is in phase and ‘ π’ indicates when signal is ou t of phase. 
SoNo is a homophasic condition where signal and noise are in phase and S πNo and SoN π are antiphasic 
conditions where one of the signals is out of phase. In the case of SπNo, the signal is out of phase, and in SoN π, 
the noise is out of phase.  SπNo and SoN π are easier to detect compared to SoNo , which shows that antiphasic 
conditions are easier to detect compared to homophasic condition.  When the signal and noise are in phase, the 
auditory image is perceived at the central location of the head . The signal or noise phase shift  leads to a separation 
between them , which  facilitates easy detection. Conversely, the DCV test assesse s the binaural integration ability 
and is more complex  than other  dichotic speech tests . The stimuli used in DCV are pairs of pa, ta, ka, ba, da, ga. 
Two distinct CVs are presented simultaneously to both ears and the subject has to repeat. Right single correct 
score, left single correct score, and double correct score are calculated.  DCV test  is sensitive to cortical lesions . 
However , its ability to detect cortical lesions' lateralization (right or left cortical regions)  is limited.  
The evaluation of the CANS  in individuals with misophonia is still unexplored . Out of the explored processes , 
Ilaa et al ., studied temporal auditory processing in individuals with misophonia using gap-in-noise, duration 
pattern, and frequency pattern tests  [13]. The results of their study showed no group differences. To the authors' 
knowledge , no study has yet explo red the binaural interaction and integration in misophonics. However , literature 
evidence on the binaural deficits in the tinnitus individuals is available.  It has been reported that binaural 
processing and working memory ability are affected in individuals with tinnitus  [14]. The pathway involved in 
tinnitus and misophonia is similar  [8, 15]. There is abnormal activation of the non -classical auditory pathway  in 
both conditions.  The trigger is perceived in the peripheral auditory system , which is then connected to the 
subcortical and cortical auditory cent ers. Whereas in tinnitus , the trigger is substituted with an external source 
and the rest of the path foll ows the same as tinnitus. There have been studies where the authors have reported 
binaural interaction deficits in individuals with tinnitus  [16]. Another study on tinnitus individuals showed 
abnormal results on central auditory speech tests , including  pass filtered speech test, staggered spondaic word 
test, binaural fusion test, and competing sentence test  [17]. According to neuroaudiological model, misophonia 
and tinnitus have similar pathophysiology so one can expect similar findings in misophonia . There is research 
evidence that shows abnormal results in auditory objective tests such as significant differences in P1 and N1 
latency peaks in late latency response test which indicates deficit in cortical auditory processing and reduced N1 
amplitude in mismatch negativity test [18, 19]. Also , Pellicori reported misophonia individuals may experience 
central auditory processing deficit since they are hyper  focused  and more concerned about the background noises 
such as chewing, drinking sounds unlike the individuals without CAPD who can easily tune out background noise 
and pay attention to signal  [20]. This study aimed  to check for any  difference in binaural integration and binaural 
interaction between normal -hearing individuals with and without misophonia .

Methods  
A cross -sectional study of university students with misophonia was carried out. All the participants in the study 
were inf ormed about the procedure, and informed consent was taken. A total of 60 normal hearing subjects in the 
age range of 18 -30 years participated in the study. Participants were divided into two groups: Experimental (n=30, 
1 male and 29 females, age mean=22.03 , SD=2.97 years) who had the diagnosis of misophonia and control (n=30, 
12 males and 18 females, age mean=22.4; SD=2.28) who did not exhibit misophonia symptoms. Participants in 
both groups had normal hearing sensitivity, which was confirmed through pure t one audiometry, where all 
participants had pure tone averages (500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 4000 Hz) of less than 15 dB [21]. A calibrated 
audiometer was used for the same, and the procedure followed was a modified version of the Hughson -Westlake 
procedur e [21]. Also, a calibrated tympanometer (GSI Tympstar V 2.0) confirmed normal middle ear functioning 
with a probe tone of 226 Hz. All the participants had either 'A' or 'As' type tympanogram and acoustic reflex was 
present within normal range at 500 Hz, 10 00 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 4000 Hz ipsilaterally and contralaterally. 
Participants with a history of otological complaints, noise exposure, ototoxic medications, tinnitus, hyperacusis, 
diabetes, or hypertension were excluded from the study. Hyperacusis was ruled out by measuring loudness 
discomfort level at frequencies between 250 Hz to 8000 Hz and for speech and it was found to be greater than 90 
dB. 
Schröder et al.’s diagnostic criteria for misophonia were used to confirm the misophonia diagnosis. The criteria 
include the presence or anticipation of specific sound that provokes an impulsive aversive physical reaction which 
starts with irritation or disgust that instantaneously becomes anger, the anger initiates a sense of loss of self -
control with potential aggre ssive outbursts, and the individual tends to avoid the misophonic situation if not 
endures the situation with discomfort or anger, whether the anger, disgust cause significant distress and all these 
criteria should not be better explained by another disord er [2]. The Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ) 
[22] was administered to assess the severity of misophonia. MAQ consists of 21 items evaluated from 0 to 3 
points depending on how frequently the issue applies (0=not at all, 1=occasionally, 2=often, an d 3=nearly 
always). Using the total score, misophonia severity is determined. Scores ranging from 0 –11 were subclinical, 
12–24 mild, 25 –37 moderate, 38 –50 severe, or 51 –63 ex treme. A Google form link was shared with all the 
participants, through which eac h response was recorded. Only participants with definite misophonia diagnoses 
(mild and moderate) were considered in this study. The participant's characteristics in both groups are shown in 
Table 1.  
DCV test material by Yathiraj (1999) was administered through a Windows media player with a calibrated 
supraural headphone  [23]. The test is administered in a sound -treated room. The test stimuli include /pa/, /ta/, 
/ka/, /ba/, /da/, /ga/. It involves the presentation of different CV pairs with a time lag of 0 ms to both ears 
simultaneously. A free recall task was carried out in which the participants were required to attend and report 
both syllables presented. Right single score, left single score , and dou ble correct scores were calculated for each 
participant.  A schematic diagram for the following is shown in Figure 1 . 
MLD was administered through a calibrated audiometer  in a sound -treated room . It was done at 500 Hz with a 
pulse mode of 2.5 Hz , and the presentation level was kept at 50 dB HL. Three conditions of MLD , SoNo,  SπNo, 
and SoN π, were tested . 'π' represents when source is out of phase and 'o' represents when the source is in phase.  
The participants were instructed to indicate when they heard the pulsed tone , and the thresholds were noted. A 
schematic diagram for the following is shown in Figure 2.  
 
Statistical analys es 
The IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 ( IBM SPSS Corp.; Armonk, NY, USA ) 
was used to analyse  the gathered data. The Shapiro -Wilk normality test was used to determine whether the data 
distribution  was normal. To assess whether there were any significant differences between the control and 
experimental groups, inferential statistics were use d. Independent t -tests were conducted on parametric data , and 
Mann -Whitney U -tests on non -parametric data.  
 
Results  
 
Comparison of binaural integration abilities between the two groups  
Shapiro Wilk 's test showed that DCV data were normally distributed . The  results of  the independent t -test showed 
t(58)=0.77, p>0.05  for double correct score, t(58)=0.27, p>0.05  for right single correct score, t(58)=0.37, p>0.05 
for left single correct score. This indicated no statistically significant difference between misop honia and the 
control group for all three conditions. The mean and standard deviation for both groups are shown in Figure 3.

Comparison of bina ural interaction  abilities between the two groups  
Shapiro Wilk 's test found that the data were not normal. Hence , a suitable non -parametric test was chosen. Mann 
Whitney U test was administered , and the results showed /Z/=1.08, p>0.05. This revealed no statistically 
significant difference bet ween misophonia and the control group. The mean and standard deviation for both 
groups are shown in Figure 4. 
For each group, right and left single  correct scores were compared. Dependent t -test was administered and it 
showed that f or the control group, t( 29)=0.71,  p>0.05 and for misophonia , it was found to be t(29)=0.9, p>0.05.  
This revealed no statistically significant difference between the ears in both groups.  
 
Discussion  
The study's outcome showed no significant differences in the M LD test and DCV test, which implies that binaural 
interaction and binaural integration are unaffected. This study considered  only 30 misophonia participants with 
mild and moderate severity . Hence , this evidence demonstrates that individuals with these severities normally 
process binaural interaction and integration . Future research can include a larger pool of participants and a higher 
degree of misophonia severity. It is also essential to consider that the tests were conducted in an ideal situation 
optimum for listening  in a quiet environment. These tests could be administered in adverse listening conditions , 
such as lower signal -to-noise  ratios , in the presence of different types of noise , which would be more challenging 
to the participants . 
Studies on misophonia have revealed no peripheral impairments  [3, 24]. fMRI research showed hyperactivation 
of the right insula, right anterior cingulate cortex, right superior temporal cortex , and anterior insular cortex  [7, 
25]. Additionally, misophonia individuals have stronger mirroring neurons than the control group, and these 
neurons are more sensitive to trigger noises  [26]. This evidence  indicate s abnormalities at the cortical level in 
misophonia , but the present study shows no abnormalities in binaural integration  and inter action behaviorally . 
Even though tinnitus and misophonia share a common pathophysiology, auditory processing is affected 
differently. In a study by Sanjay et al.  it was found that interaural level difference, interaural time difference, and 
DCV test scores are poorer in the tinnitus group assessing binaural interaction and binaural integration [14]. In 
tinnitus individuals, habituation is affected compared to the control group, shown by N1 -P2 amplitude being less 
pronounced [27]. Another research that studied binaural processing in tinnitus individuals through Auditory 
Brainstem Response (ABR) reported that in both monaural and binaural recording, wave I, III, and V had delayed 
latencies, and wave I and III amplitudes were reduced [16]. Also, when they compared Binaural Interaction 
Component )BIC(  between both groups, they observed earlier BIC latency for wave I and V in the control group, 
whereas, with respect to amplitude, they did not find any significant differences. Another ABR study that 
evaluated tinnitus based on occasional and constant tinnitus demonstrated that constant tinnitus individuals had 
delayed wave V latency compared to occasional tinnitus individ uals and the control group [28]. Joo et al. studied 
the effect of tinnitus duration on ABR and reported that individuals with subacute tinnitus duration (1 –6 months) 
had reduced wave V amplitude and delayed wave V latency compared to individuals with acute  tinnitus duration 
(<1 month) [29]. Also, they reported prolonged interpeak latency I -V during the subacute phase compared to the 
acute and chronic phases (>6 months). This indicated that after one month of symptoms, the compensatory 
reaction to tinnitus s ignificantly reduced. Other ABR studies on tinnitus reported reduced amplitude of wave I 
and V, prolonged wave I, prolonged interpeak latency I -V, and increased interaural latency difference of wave V 
[30, 31]. A literature review of salicylate and noise -induced tinnitus on rat models showed reduced amplitude of 
wave I in both conditions whereas, increased amplitude of wave IV was observed in salicylate -induced tinnitus 
but not in noise -induced tinnitus [32]. The superior olivary complex is an essential str ucture in binaural processing 
and auditory brainstem responses, and all the abnormal findings in ABR can be attributed to the effect of binaural 
processing. Aryal and Prabhu reported no abnormal ABR findings in individuals with misophonia, supporting 
the findings obtained in the present study [33]. In most tinnitus complainers, tinnitus experienced is a continuous 
phenomenon, whereas misophonia gets triggered intermittently. This might be one of the reasons why binaural 
processing is affected differently in  these groups. There are neurophysiological evidences such as reduced N1 
amplitude in mismatch negativity, and significant differences in P1 and N1 latency which indicates differences 
in central auditory processing compared to the control group [18, 19] Al so, according to Pellicori, those with 
misophonia may have a central auditory processing deficit because they are more focused and aware of the 
background noises compared to individuals without CAPD who can easily filter out background noises [20]. The 
tests used in this study were simple and the severe misophonia group was not considered. Hence, more 
complicated tests and on severe misophonia can shed more light on this condition. Since binaural integration and

interaction findings are different in individ uals with tinnitus and misophonia, we can hypothesize that there could 
be some difference in the mechanism of binaural processing between these groups.  
 
Conclusion  
The present study is the first to study binaural interaction and  integration in misophonia i ndividuals. The above -
mentioned processes  were investigated using masking level difference and dichotic consonant  vowel , 
respectively. The results showed that there are no significant differences between individuals with and without 
misophonia. A few limitations of the study were the nu mber of participants considered and  the misophonia 
severity assessed , which was only t o a moderate degree.  Also, entire central auditory processing tests were not 
administered in this study, more studies on other central auditory processes are essential . Hence, f urther research  
on misophonia tackling these limitations could be undertaken.
