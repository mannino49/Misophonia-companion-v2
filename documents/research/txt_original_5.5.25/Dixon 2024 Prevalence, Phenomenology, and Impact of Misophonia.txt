Misophonia is characterized by decreased tolerance for and negative reactions to certain sounds and asso-
ciated stimuli, which contribute to impairment and distress. Research has found that misophonia is common
in clinical, college, and online samples; yet, fewer studies have examined rates of misophonia in population-
based samples. The current study addresses limitations of prior research by investigating misophonia prev-
alence, phenomenology, and impairment in a large, nationally representative sample of adults in the UnitedStates. Probability-based sampling was used to administer a survey to a representative sample of U.S. house-
holds. Data were adjusted with poststrati ﬁcation weights to account for potential sampling biases and exam-
ined as weighted proportions to estimate the outcomes. The sample included 4,005 participants (51.5%
female; 62.5% White). Sensitivity to misophonia sounds was reported by 78.5% of the sample, and 4.6%
reported clinical levels of misophonia. Results demonstrated signi ﬁcant demographic differences in miso-
phonia symptom severity. Speci ﬁcally, signi ﬁcantly higher misophonia symptoms were observed for partic-
ipants who identi ﬁed as female, less than 55 years old, less than a high school education, never married,
lower income, and those working part time, compared to each of the respective comparison groups.
Those with clinically signi ﬁcant misophonia symptoms reported that symptoms often onset in childhood
and adolescence, were persistent, and contributed to severe impairment in at least one life domain. Theseﬁndings provide a prevalence estimate of misophonia in the general population of the United States and
inform our understanding of who is affected by misophonia.
General Scienti ﬁc Summary
Misophonia affects 4.6% of individuals in the United States. This study found that misophonia symp-
toms are higher among individuals who identify as female, less than 55 years old, less than a high school
education, never married, lower income, and those working part time.
Keywords: misophonia, prevalence, impairment, phenomenology, sound sensitivity
Misophonia is a disorder characterized by decreased tolerance and
strong, negative reactions to certain sounds and related stimuli(Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001 ;Swedo et al., 2022 ). Sounds that trig-
ger misophonia are often human-made, such as eating sounds (e.g.,smacking, slurping), nasal and mouth sounds (e.g., breathing, snif-ﬂing), repetitive tapping (e.g., typing, pen clicking) and rustling
(e.g., plastic bags, paper crickling; Jager et al., 2020 ). Triggersmay also include sounds in the environment, such as a clock ticking
or a pet moving ( Jager et al., 2020 ), and visual stimuli associated
with sounds (e.g., seeing someone eat from across the room;Swedo et al., 2022 ). Reactions to misophonic sounds are character-
ized by intense emotional (e.g., anger, anxiety), behavioral (e.g.,mimicking the sound, agitation), cognitive (e.g., negative thoughts,attention), and physiological (e.g., muscle tension, increased heart

rate) symptoms ( Jager et al., 2020 ;Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ;Swedo
et al., 2022 ). To mitigate these symptoms, individuals often report
engaging in numerous behavioral strategies, such as avoiding orescaping from situations, attempting to discontinue the sound, andengaging in coping strategies, such as relaxation techniques and dis-traction ( Rosenthal et al., 2021 ;Swedo et al., 2022 ). Misophonia
symptoms occur on a continuum of severity ( Wu et al., 2014 ) and
can cause severe distress and impairment across life areas (e.g.,work, social life; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ;Swedo et al., 2022 ).
Although diagnostic criteria for misophonia have not yet been estab-lished, this pattern of symptoms has been found to be distinct fromother psychiatric (e.g., obsessive –compulsive disorder, autism spec-
trum disorder), audiological (e.g., hyperacusis), and medical condi-tions (e.g., tinnitus; Erfanian et al., 2019 ;Jager et al., 2020 ;Rouw &
Erfanian, 2018 ).
As the research on misophonia continues to unfold, one critical area
of investigation is the epidemiology of misophonia in the general pop-
ulation. To date, existing studies have often used clinical, college, andonline samples to estimate rates of misophonia. In clinical samples,misophonia has been found to affect 8.5% –12.7% of psychiatric
patients ( Siepsiak, Sobczak, et al., 2020 ), 35.5% of individuals with
autism ( Williams et al., 2022 ), and 10% –57% of patients presenting
with tinnitus or other sound sensitivities ( Aazh et al., 2022 ;
Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2002 ;Sztuka et al., 2010 ). In these studies,
the patient population and the screening tool (e.g., self-report measureand clinical judgment) appear to in ﬂuence misophonia rates, and
selection biases observed in clinical samples limit the extentto which these rates can be translated to other populations ( Hegedus
& Moody, 2010 ). In student samples, studies have demonstrated
that between 23.1% and 78.9% of individuals have at least somesensitivity to misophonic sounds ( Wu et al., 2014 ;Zhou et al.,
2017) and 12.2% –19.9% experience clinical levels of misophonia
symptoms based on clinical cutoffs established by the MisophoniaQuestionnaire (MQ) and the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale(A-MISO-S; i.e., at least moderate symptoms; Naylor et al., 2021 ;
Wu et al., 2014 ;Zhou et al., 2017 ). A strength of these college-based
studies is the quanti ﬁcation of misophonia symptoms through the use
of evidence-based MQs; however, ﬁndings are limited by the compo-
sition of the sample, which largely includes young, college-enrolledindividuals who identify as White and female.
Expanding upon this research, online crowdsourcing platforms
have been used to recruit community samples. These samples increasedemographic representation by including a greater proportion of maleparticipants, a wider age range, and individuals of varying educationalbackgrounds. In one study, Guetta et al. (2022) surveyed adults ( N=
297, M
age=39.1 years, 47.5% female) on Amazon ’sM e c h a n i c a l
Turk and found that 13.5% of the sample endorsed clinical levelsof misophonia on the MQ. Another study recruited participants(N=1,403, M
age=33.3 years, 51.1% female) from Proli ﬁct ov a l i -
date the Duke-Vanderbilt Misophonia Screening Questionnaire
(Williams et al., 2022 ). In this sample, the prevalence rate of misopho-
nia was 7.3%. Although the samples of these two studies were similar,each study used different clinical criteria and assessments of miso-phonia, which may account for the discrepancy in prevalence rates.Building upon this work, Vitoratou et al. (2023) took additional
steps to approximate a representative sample by conducting strati ﬁed
sampling to select individuals representative of the general U.K.population based on sex, age, and ethnicity. Participants ( N=772,
M
age=46.4 years, 51.3% female) were recruited from Proli ﬁca n dcompleted self-report questionnaires and a misophonia diagnostic
interview. Clinical levels of misophonia were observed in 18.4% ofthe sample based on the S-Five ( Vitoratou et al., 2021 ). This study
has many strengths, including the use of a receiver operating charac-teristic (ROC) analysis to identify clinical levels of misophonia, theconcurrent use of a diagnostic interview and questionnaires, andusing sampling quotas to approximate the U.K. population on certaindemographic features; however, the sampling procedures limitpopulation-level inferences. Cumulatively, these ﬁndings add to our
understanding of the rates of misophonia in different samples; yet,the methodology relied on nonrandom selection, nonprobability sam-pling, and convenience samples. To determine prevalence rates andunderstand the experience of misophonia in the broader population,studies using random sampling procedures to recruit nationally repre-sentative samples are necessary.
To date, two studies have conducted random sampling to estimate
rates of misophonia in Ankara, Turkey ( Kılıç et al., 2021 ) and
Germany ( Jakubovski et al., 2022 ). In the ﬁrst study, individuals
(N=541; M
age=43.5 years, 58.0% female) in Turkey ’s capital
city, Ankara, were identi ﬁed using bus stops as the sampling
frame ( Kılıç et al., 2021 ). Although the sample is described as
nationally representative, the demographic parameters representedby this sample are not reported. A semistructured misophonia inter-view developed for this study was administered, and results indi-cated that 12.8% of individuals met the criteria established by theauthors. In the second study, a randomized sampling procedurewas used to identi ﬁed 53,000 areas in Germany, and a target individ-
ual was selected using the Kish grid method from each of 23 house-holds in each area that were identi ﬁed on a random route ( Jakubovski
et al., 2022 ).Jakubovski et al. (2022) reported their randomly
selected sample was comparable to the general population inGermany in terms of household size, age distribution (men/women), and geographic region. Participants ( N=2,519; M
age=
50.3 years, 52.5% female) completed a paper –pencil battery of self-
report questionnaires, which included the MQ and the AmsterdamMisophonia Scale —Revised. Clinical misophonia symptoms were
identi ﬁed in 5.0% of the sample on the Misophonia Questionnaire
Severity Scale and 5.9% of the sample on the AmsterdamMisophonia Scale —Revised, with only 2.2% meeting both criteri-
ons. Together, these studies provide population-level estimates ofthe rates of misophonia and address many of the limitations inherentto clinical, student, and online samples; nevertheless, continuedresearch is necessary to further establish broader population norms.
The purpose of the current study was to conduct a rigorous inves-
tigation of misophonia prevalence, phenomenology, and impairmentby using probability-based sampling to survey a large, nationallyrepresentative sample of U.S. adults. This study was developedprior to recent developments in the assessment of misophonia(e.g., Rosenthal et al., 2021 ;Vitoratou et al., 2021 ;Williams et al.,
2022 ); however, the combination of the MQ and the A-MISO-S
were used to provide a more complete assessment and identi ﬁcation
of misophonia cases. The ﬁrst aim was to characterize misophonia
sound triggers, emotional and behavioral responses, and clinical lev-els of misophonia symptoms within this sample. The second aimwas to examine demographic predictors of misophonia symptomseverity. The last aim was to describe demographic characteristics,history of misophonia symptoms (e.g., age of onset, progressionof symptoms, family history), and impairment among individualsreporting clinically signi ﬁcant levels of misophonia.

aims of the study and the exploratory nature of this work, there were
no hypotheses.
Method
Sampling and Data Collection Procedures
Data were collected by Ipsos KnowledgePanel (KnowledgePanel),
which maintains the largest, web-based panel that is designed to berepresentative of the U.S. population. KnowledgePanel (formerlyKnowledge Networks, Inc.) has been used in epidemiologicalresearch, including national health organizations (e.g., Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2010 ), to estimate the base rates
and impact of a range of conditions in the general population, suchas food allergy ( Gupta et al., 2011 ), chronic pain ( Johannes et al.,
2010), atopic dermatitis ( Silverberg et al., 2018 ), and chronic illness
(Rosland et al., 2013 ). KnowledgePanel uses probability-based sam-
pling methods, speci ﬁcally address-based sampling methodology, to
recruit members based on the latest delivery sequence ﬁle from the
U.S. Postal Service and to select samples that are nationally represen-tative of all households ( Ipsos Public Affairs, n.d. ). This recruitment
methodology reduces self-selection bias and facilitates the recruitmentof a nationally representative sample, including commonly underrep-resented and hard-to-reach individuals. For instance, the address-based sampling includes representation of households that do nothave Internet access, and KnowledgePanel provides a web-enableddevice to individuals who do not have access to the internet. To furtherensure that samples are representative of the U.S. population, study-speciﬁc poststrati ﬁcation weights are applied to survey data based
on geodemographic benchmarks from the latest U.S. CensusBureau ’s Current Population Survey. The benchmarks used to weight
the active panel members include gender, age, race/ethnicity, educa-
tion, household income, census region, home ownership status, met-ropolitan area, and Hispanic origin. This weighting process addressespotential under- or oversampling of certain subgroups, and an iterativeproportional ﬁtting is used to produce the ﬁnal weights. Information
collected using such representative sampling methods has previouslyallowed other research institutions (e.g., Centers for Disease Controland Prevention) to draw population-based conclusions, and subse-quently, we estimate that these results are similarly informative.
Participation in each KnowledgePanel survey is voluntary, and con-
sent is implicit in the completion and return of the survey. Panel mem-bers typically do not receive more than one invitation per week, and amodest incentive program is used by KnowledgePanel to encourageongoing participation. KnowledgePanel survey completion is typi-cally about 60%, which is a substantially higher rate than nonprobabil-ity online panels that yield completion rates in the single digits ( Ipsos
Public Affairs, n.d. ).
Based on studies indicating the dimensional nature of misophonia
symptoms and estimating that between 6% –20% of individuals
recruited from nonpatient samples report clinically signi ﬁcant miso-
phonia symptoms ( Wu et al., 2014 ;Zhou et al., 2017 ), it was deter-
mined that 4,000 completed surveys would yield a suf ﬁcient sample
to conduct descriptive statistics, group comparisons, and exploratoryanalyses. A pretest of the survey was conducted in January 2022, andthe main survey was administered between January 21, 2022 andFebruary 6, 2022. Selected panel members ( N=6,688) received
an email invitation to complete an online survey and were askedto do so at their earliest convenience. Email reminders were sentto nonresponders on the third day of the survey period, andadditional reminders were sent to any remaining nonresponders on
Days 7 and 11 of the survey period. The response rate for this surveywas 59.9%.
Participants
The sample included 4,005 adults between the ages of 18 –93
years ( Mage=48.32; SD=17.76). Approximately half the sample
was female (51.5%), and identi ﬁed as White, non-Hispanic
(62.5%); Hispanic (16.9%); Black, non-Hispanic (12.0%); Other,non-Hispanic (7.2%); and multiracial, non-Hispanic (1.4%). In
terms of education, 9.6% did not have a high school degree,
28.3% had a high school degree or General EducationDevelopment diploma, 27.1% had some college education, and35.0% had a Bachelor ’s degree or higher. With regard to marital sta-
tus, over half the sample was married (56.6%), 29.5% never married,9.4% divorced or separated, and 4.5% widowed. Annual householdincome was fairly evenly distributed and ranged from .$10,000 to
$150,000 or more. With regard to current employment status,48.8% worked full time, 13.0% worked part time, and 38.1% werenot working. Most of the sample (86.7%) reported being from a met-ropolitan area. Altogether, this sample re ﬂects the U.S. population
based on the March 2021 supplement of the U.S. Census Bureau ’s
Current Population Survey.
Measures
Demographic Characteristics and Misophonia Symptom
History
Demographic characteristics were assessed by KnowledgePanel.
Gender, age, age group, race/ethnicity, education, marital status,household income, employment status, and metropolitan area status(i.e., area with ≥one urbanized area of 50,000 or more population as
deﬁned by the U.S. Census) are reported. Five misophonia symptom
history questions were used to assess age of onset, ﬁrst sound trigger,
changes in the intensity and number of sound triggers, and biological
familial history of sound sensitivities. Each item included multiple
response options, and participants could endorse multiple responsesfor the items assessing ﬁrst sound trigger and familial history of
sound sensitivities. In addition, three questions assessed the charac-teristic symptom of other sensory experiences. Speci ﬁcally, partici-
pants responded yes/no to the following questions: (a) “Do you have
ringing, buzzing, humming or other noises in your ear (tinnitus)? ”;
(b)“are every day sounds too loud for you? ”(hyperacusis); and
(c)“autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) describes an
atypical multisensory experience of calming, tingling sensationsthat originate in the crown of the head in response to a speci ﬁc subset
of audio-visual triggers. Do you experience ASMR? ”
Misophonia Symptoms
The A-MISO-S ( Schröder et al., 2013 ) is a six-item measure
adapted from the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale(Goodman et al., 1989 ). Items evaluate the time occupied by miso-
phonic sounds, social functioning, distress, effort to resist thoughtsabout the misophonic sounds, control over thoughts about the miso-phonic sounds, and avoidance of misophonic sounds. Each item israted on scale from 0 ( none)t o4( extreme ). The items are summed
to compute the A-MISO-S total score, and scores correspond toMISOPHONIA IN A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE 3This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

severity ranges, indicating subclinical misophonia symptoms (0 –4),
mild symptoms (5 –9), moderate symptoms (10 –14), severe symp-
toms (15 –29), or extreme symptoms (20 –24). Previous research
has used a clinical cutoff of ≥10 to identify individuals with miso-
phonia ( Naylor et al., 2021 ;Schröder et al., 2013 ), which has been
found to detect misophonia-related functional impairment with89% sensitivity and 67% speci ﬁcity ( Möllmann et al., 2023 ). In
this study, the A-MISO-S was used as a measure of misophoniasymptom severity and to characterize clinical levels of misophonia.In the full sample, the internal consistency of the A-MISO-S wasgood ( α=.88).
The MQ ( Wu et al., 2014 ) is a 20-item self-report questionnaire that
assesses misophonia symptom prevalence (Symptom Scale), emo-tions and behaviors related to misophonia (Emotions and BehaviorScale), and overall severity of sound sensitivities (Severity Scale).The Symptom Scale includes seven primary items that assess the pres-
ence of speci ﬁc sound sensitives, such as eating, nasal and throat
sounds, and repetitive tapping sounds. Items are rated on aLikert-type scale from 0 ( not at all true )t o4( always true ). The
Emotions and Behavior Scale consists of ten primary items that eval-uate reactions to misophonia sounds, such as avoidance of situations,annoyance, and verbal aggression. Items are rated on a Likert-typescale ranging from 0 ( never )t o4( always ). The last item of both scales
includes an “other”option that allows participants to identify an addi-
tional symptom; however, this item is not included in the total score.The Severity Scale includes one item that evaluates overall symptomseverity on a scale from 1 ( minimal )t o1 5( very severe ). Scores ≥7
indicate signi ﬁcant interference caused by clinically signi ﬁcant symp-
toms ( Wu et al., 2014 ).Möllmann et al. (2023) found this cutoff score
was the optimal balance for detecting misophonia-related impairmentwith 78% sensitivity and 77% speci ﬁcity. In this study, the MQ was
used to characterize misophonia symptoms in the sample, and theMQ Severity Scale was used as a clinical criterion. Good internal con-sistency was observed for the MQ Symptom Scale ( α=.87) and MQ
Emotions and Behavior Scale ( α=.87).
Impairment
The Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS; Mundt et al.,
2002)i sa ﬁve-item scale scored on a Likert-type scale from 0 ( not
at all )t o8( very severely ). Participants were asked to consider how
their misophonia affects their ability to carry out certain tasks acrossﬁve key areas including work, home management, social leisure activ-
ities, private leisure activities, and ability to maintain close relation-ships. Scores range from 0 to 40, and scores ≥20 indicate clinical
levels of functional impairment, scores between 10 and 20 indicatesigniﬁcant impairment, and scores less than 10 are indicative of sub-
clinical symptoms ( Mundt et al., 2002 ). In this study, the WSAS was
only administered to individuals who endorsed symptoms on the MQSymptom Scale or the A-MISO-S ( n=3,787). Good internal consis-
tency was observed ( α=.90) in this sample.
Data Analyses
Analyses were conducted with SPSS Version 28.0. KnowledgePanel
sample weights were applied for all analyses. Data were initially
screened and assumptions for Little ’s Missing Completely at Random
Test were met for items not included in the questionnaire ’s skip
logic ( p..05), suggesting data were missing at random. Tomaximize cases included, mean imputation was used to compute
total scores for measures where ,20% of items on the scale were miss-
ing. First, descriptive analyses were conducted to characterize miso-phonia symptoms (MQ Symptoms, MQ Emotions and BehaviorsScale, MQ Severity Scale, and A-MISO-S) in the full sample.Second, a series of independent samples ttests and analyses of variance
(ANOVAs) were conducted to examine each demographic factor as apredictor of misophonia symptom severity (A-MISO-S). Given theexploratory nature of these analyses, equal variances were not assumed.Games-Howell post hoc tests were conducted to compare all group dif-ferences for each demographic factor. Alpha was set at .01.
Finally, characteristics of individuals with clinically signi ﬁcant
misophonia symptoms were examined. Consistent with Jakubovski
et al. (2022) , two criterion were used to identify clinical levels of
misophonia. Speci ﬁcally, participants who scored in the clinical
range on the A-MISO-S (total scores ≥10;Möllmann et al., 2023 ;
Schröder et al., 2013 ) and the MQ Severity Scale (scores ≥7;
Möllmann et al., 2023 ;Wu et al., 2014 ) were identi ﬁed as having
misophonia. Descriptive analyses were used to examine demographiccharacteristics, misophonia symptom history, and impairment due tomisophonia symptoms (WSAS) among those with misophonia.
This study was not preregistered. However, the data, syntax, and
output are available ( Dixon, 2024a ,2024b ), and study materials

Results
Misophonia Symptoms in the Full Sample
The means, standard deviations, and frequencies of endorsing
misophonia sounds, emotions, and behaviors are reported inTable 1 . A total of 78.5% of individuals reported being at least
“sometimes ”sensitive to one sound or more ( M=3.15, SD=
2.30) on the MQ Symptom Scale. On average, the sound of peopleeating received the highest endorsement, whereas the sound of cer-tain consonants and/or vowels was the least endorsed. On the MQEmotions and Behavior Scale, 67.9% reported at least “sometimes ”
experiencing one or more behavioral and emotional symptom asso-ciated with misophonia. Among individuals who endorsed sensitiv-ity to misophonic sounds, the most common emotional andbehavioral responses endorsed were becoming annoyed and leavingthe environment (respectively).
Next, indicators of clinically signi ﬁcant misophonia symptoms
were examined. Participants generally reported a mild level of
sound sensitivity severity on the MQ Severity Scale ( M=4.00,
SD=3.21) and 14.3% scored in the clinical range. Similarly, the aver-
age score on the A-MISO-S was in the subclinical range ( M=3.66,
SD=3.63), and most participants reported subclinical levels of miso-
phonia severity (65.0%), 25.9% endorsed mild symptoms, 7.2% mod-erate, 1.0% severe, and 0.1% extreme symptoms. Altogether, 8.3%participants met the threshold for clinically signi ﬁcant levels of miso-
phonia severity on the A-MISO-S. A total of 185 (4.6%) participantsmet the misophonia criteria for this study by scoring in the clinicalrange on the MQ Severity Scale and the A-MISO-S.
Examination of Demographic Predictors of Misophonia
Symptom Severity
Table 2 provides a summary of group means, standard deviations,
and results of the ttests and ANOVAs with post hoc Games-HowellDIXON, SCHADEGG, CLARK, SEVIER, AND WITCRAFT 4This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

tests. As shown, females reported signi ﬁcantly higher misophonia
symptoms compared to males. The analyses also revealed signi ﬁcant
omnibus tests for age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status,household income, and employment. Post hoc Games-Howell testsidenti ﬁed that misophonia symptoms were higher in younger age
groups (Groups 18 –24, 25 –34, 35 –44, and 45 –54) compared to
older age groups (Groups 55 –64, 65 –74, and 75 +), those with
less than a high school education (vs. high school, some college,and a Bachelor ’s degree or higher), individuals who had never
been married (vs. married, widowed, and divorced/separated), andindividuals working part time (vs. working full time or not working).With regard to household income, higher scores were generally asso-ciated with lower income, and speci ﬁcally, individuals with a house-
hold income less than $10,000 and those with a household income of
$25,000 –$49,999 each had signi ﬁcantly higher misophonia symp-
toms than those with an income greater than $150,000, and individ-uals with a household income between $10,000 and $24,999 hadsigniﬁcantly higher misophonia symptoms than groups of individu-
als with a household income of $50,000 or higher. Although a sig-niﬁcant omnibus test was found for race/ethnicity, no signi ﬁcant
between-group differences were identi ﬁed in post hoc comparisons.
In addition, no signi ﬁcant differences were observed with regard to
metropolitan area status.
Characteristics of Participants With Clinically Signi ﬁcant
Misophonia Symptoms
Demographic characteristics (see Table 3 ) and misophonia symp-
tom history responses (see Table 4 ) of individuals with clinical lev-
els of misophonia were examined. In sum, misophonia symptomswere found to commonly emerge in childhood and adolescence,and close to half of individuals in each misophonia group identi ﬁedthe sound of people eating as their ﬁrst signi ﬁcant sound trigger. In
addition, the majority of participants reported the number of soundtriggers and intensity of sound triggers increased or had not changedsince ﬁrst experiencing the sensitivities. With regard to family his-
tory, 28.2% of participants identi ﬁed at least one family member
with sound sensitivities (mode =1; range =0–6), and the most fre-
quently identi ﬁed relative was a parent. Last, a portion of partici-
pants endorsed other sensory sensitivities, with tinnitus being themost common (44.1%).
Impairment Among Participants With Clinically
Signi ﬁcant Misophonia Symptoms
With regard to impairment due to misophonia symptoms (WSAS;
M=14.81, SD=8.32), 26.1% endorsed clinical levels of impair-
ment, 34.9% reported signi ﬁcant impairment, 38.0% reported sub-
clinical levels of impairment, and 1.0% did not respond to items.To better understand domains of impairment observed among indi-viduals with misophonia, percentages were calculated for individu-als reporting “deﬁnite”impairment or higher (i.e., ≥4) in each of the
areas. Using this threshold, 68.9% of individuals reported substantialimpairment in at least one life area. Impairment in social leisureactivities was the most common area of impairment (49.8%), fol-lowed by in home management (33.0%), work (32.3%), ability toform and maintain close relationships with others (31.0%), and pri-vate leisure activities (30.8%).
Discussion
This study is the ﬁrst to examine misophonia symptoms in a large,
nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. The descriptive dataand analyses predicting misophonia symptom severity inform ourunderstanding of who is affected by misophonia in the generalTable 1Endorsement of Misophonia Sounds, Emotions, and Behaviors in Full Sample

population, and the use of widely used MQs helps to further contex-
tualize existing and future research in this area.
Consistent with previous ﬁndings ( Wu et al., 2014 ;Zhou et al.,
2017 ), many individuals within the general population experience
at least some sensitivity to misophonic sounds, and eating soundsand repetitive tapping were the most common sounds reported.The primary ﬁndings suggest that 4.6% of individuals in the U.S.
experience clinical levels of misophonia symptoms. This rate ismost consistent with the ﬁndings observed in Germany
(Jakubovski et al., 2022 ); yet, is lower than previous estimates of
misophonia in college ( Naylor et al., 2021 ;Wu et al., 2014 ;Zhou
et al., 2017 ), online ( Guetta et al., 2022 ;Vitoratou et al., 2023 ;
Williams et al., 2022 ), and population-based ( Kılıç et al., 2021 ) sam-
ples. This discrepancy is likely due to differences in measurementand biases in sampling.With regard to measurement, the current study and Jakubovski
et al. (2022) found similar misophonia rates and both used two miso-
phonia measures to establish clinically signi ﬁcant misophonia,
wherein one of the clinical indicators was the MQ Severity Scaleand the other measure was a variant of the A-MISO-S. The use ofboth measures appears to result in a more stringent evaluation ofmisophonia-related distress and functional impairment; however,future work is needed to determine the speci ﬁcity and sensitivity
of concurrently using both measures to detect clinical levels of miso-phonia. In contrast, the use of one clinical criterion has yieldedhigher prevalence rates, ranging from 7.3% to 18.8% in online sam-ples ( Guetta et al., 2022 ;Vitoratou et al., 2023 ;Williams et al., 2022 )
and 5.0% to 12.8% in population-based samples (current results;Jakubovski et al., 2022 ;Kılıç et al., 2021 ). This pattern of ﬁndings
underscores the need to further re ﬁne the assessment of clinicalTable 2

criterion for misophonia and for researchers to carefully consider
how clinical levels of misophonia are identi ﬁed. Although diagnos-
tic criteria have not been established, recent work established a con-sensus de ﬁnition for misophonia that should be used to inform future
research in this area ( Swedo et al., 2022 ). For example, the recently
developed Duke-Vanderbilt Misophonia Screening Questionnaireuses a diagnostic algorithm to evaluate clinical criterion that alignwith the consensus de ﬁnition ( Williams et al., 2022 ); hence, future
studies should consider the use of this questionnaire or other ques-tionnaires that would similarly capture this information.
The variability in rates of misophonia is also likely due to the dif-
ferences in sampling and sampling bias. For instance, several studiessuggest younger age is associated with misophonia ( Kılıç et al., 2021 ;
Vitoratou et al., 2023 ;Williams et al., 2022 ); therefore, misophonia
may be overrepresented in college samples. In addition, self-selectionbiases may overestimate rates of misophonia observed in clinicalsamples and online studies. To overcome such biases, the current
study used strati ﬁed random sampling of all known households and
extraordinary steps were taken to reduce sampling bias (e.g., supply-ing individuals with an internet-enabled device if needed). Further,sampling weights were used to ensure the sample represented theU.S. population across many sociodemographic characteristics (i.e.,gender, age, race/Hispanic ethnicity, education, census region, house-hold income, home ownership status, metropolitan area, and HispanicTable 3Demographic Characteristics of Par ticipants With Clinically Signi ﬁcant

origin). Thus, we can be reasonably sure that the results represent the
actual rate of misophonia in the U.S. population. To date, only twostudies have used random sampling to select individuals fromGermany and Ankara, Turkey. Beyond differences in measurement,comparisons across these studies are dif ﬁcult to make given the poten-
tial for cultural differences and discrepancies in the reporting of demo-graphic information. Additional research using random selection andnationally representative samples is necessary to estimate the globalprevalence of misophonia.
Next, analyses were conducted to identify subpopulations that
may be disproportionately affected by misophonia symptoms.Small effects were found, wherein signi ﬁcantly higher misophonia
symptoms were observed for those who identi ﬁed as female, less
than 55 years old, less than a high school education, never married,lower income, and part-time employment status, compared to eachof the respective comparison groups. These ﬁndings add to the
growing body of research examining demographic predictors of
misophonia. Consistent with the current ﬁndings, some studies
have found misophonia symptoms to be more common amongwomen ( Kılıç et al., 2021 ;Williams et al., 2022 ), younger individ-
uals ( Kılıç et al., 2021 ;Vitoratou et al., 2023 ;Williams et al., 2022 ),
and individuals who are not married ( Kılıç et al., 2021 ); yet, the
population-based study conducted in Germany did not ﬁnd signi ﬁ-
cant effects for these factors ( Jakubovski et al., 2022 ). Interesting,
a higher rate of high school degrees and living in rural areas werethe only signi ﬁcant demographic characteristics to predict misopho-
nia in Germany ( Jakubovski et al., 2022 ), which is inconsistent our
ﬁndings that showed a signi ﬁcant effect of lower education and no
effect of metropolitan status on misophonia symptom severity. Inaddition, the present study is the ﬁrst to show that lower income
and working part-time were each associated with signi ﬁcantly
higher misophonia symptoms. Although replication of these ﬁnd-
ings is necessary, this pattern of results is generally consistentwith research showing that lower education, lower income, andjob insecurity are associated with worse health outcomes and lessaccess to health care ( World Health Organization (WHO), n.d. ),
which suggests the need to further consider how to detect andtreat misophonia among individuals who may be underserved.Finally, although our results did not reveal signi ﬁcant between
group differences for the effect of race/Hispanic ethnicity, a signi ﬁ-
cant omnibus effect was observed, suggesting the need for continuedresearch in this area.
In addition to the primary ﬁndings, the misophonia history symp-
toms results lend further support to ﬁndings observed in previous
misophonia samples (e.g., Jager et al., 2020 ;Rouw & Erfanian,
2018 ). Speci ﬁcally, misophonia symptoms were found to start in
childhood and adolescence, and eating sounds were most frequentlyreported as the ﬁrst sound trigger. Repetitive tapping, environmental
sounds, and throat sounds were also identi
ﬁed by many as a ﬁrst
sound trigger. Most individuals reported that the severity of these
symptoms did not change or worsened over time, which suggeststhat misophonia symptoms are often chronic and may be progres-sive. Regarding family history, most individuals reported that theydid not know of a family member with sound sensitivities; however,about one-quarter of participants identi ﬁed at least one family mem-
ber experienced sound sensitivities, with a parent being the most fre-quently identi ﬁed member. Prior studies have reported that between
22%–43.5% of individuals with misophonia indicated knowing a
family member with similar symptoms ( Kılıç et al., 2021 ;Rouw& Erfanian, 2018 ); however, there is very little research in this
area, and additional studies are needed to further understand thepotential biological and environmental in ﬂuences of the develop-
ment of misophonia.
Regarding other sensory sensitivities, 41.6% of the misophonia
sample endorsed that they experienced everyday sounds as too loud,which is much higher than hyperacusis rates observed in previousstudies (e.g., 0.7% –1.9%; Jager et al., 2020 ;Möllmann et al.,
2023), suggesting that the high rate observed in this study is likely
an overestimation due to measurement rather than the true rate ofco-occurrence of this disorder. Conversely, the rates of tinnitus andASMR were generally consistent with the range of rates reported byprevious studies, which have shown 13.8% –50.4% of individuals
with misophonia experience ASMR ( Jakubovski et al., 2022 ;
Möllmann et al., 2023 ;Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ) and 1.7% –43.5%
experience tinnitus ( Jager et al., 2020 ;Kılıç et al., 2021 ;Möllmann
et al., 2023 ).
Finally, with regard to impairment, a large portion of the sample
endorsed signi ﬁcant or clinical levels of overall impairment, and
most of the sample reported substantial impairment in at least onelife area. In particular, impairment in social activities with otherswas the most frequently endorsed area of concern. These ﬁndings
replicate previous studies showing that individuals with misophoniaoften make signi ﬁcant adjustments to their life, experience an overall
lower quality of life, and have lost jobs or relationships due to theirsymptoms ( Jager et al., 2020 ;Wu et al., 2014 ;Zhou et al., 2017 ).
Although this study addresses gaps in the literature and has many
strengths, including the use of a random sampling to recruit a nation-ally representative sample, several limitations should be considered infuture research. First, diagnostic criteria for misophonia have not yetbeen established; therefore, heightened levels of distress and impair-ment have typically been used to detect clinical levels of misophoniain the current and existing studies. The measures used in this studywere prominent in the literature at the time of the current study; how-ever, these measures were developed in the early stages of misophoniaresearch when very little empirical data were available on the symp-tom presentation of misophonia and a consensus de ﬁnition of miso-
phonia was not available ( Swedo et al., 2022 ). This study used both
the MQ Severity scale and the A-MISO-S in attempt to overcomethe limitations of each of the respective measures; however, in contextof the current literature, there are notable issues with each of thesemeasures. For instance, the A-MISO-S was initially developedbased on the YBOCS and did not originate for the explicit purposeof measuring misophonia symptoms. With regard to the MQ, onlyone item is used to evaluate clinical severity, and the instructionsfor this item ask about impairment related to sound sensitivity ratherthan speci ﬁcally referencing misophonia. Therefore, responses to this
item may re ﬂect one ’s experience of sound sensitivity more broadly
and may not be speci ﬁc to misophonia. Recent advancements in miso-
phonia research have yielded a number of self-report measures that
were developed based on misophonia research and demonstrate strongpsychometric properties, such as the S-Five ( Vitoratou et al., 2021 ,
2023
), Duke Misophonia Questionnaire ( Rosenthal et al., 2021 ),
Misophonia Response Scale ( Dibb et al., 2021 ), Duke-Vanderbilt
Misophonia Screening Questionnaire ( Williams et al., 2022 ), and
MisoQuest ( Siepsiak, Sliwerski, et al., 2020 ). To advance this
research, researchers should carefully select science-based measuresof misophonia. Replication of the current ﬁndings is needed in the
future, particularly when misophonia diagnostic criteria and a briefDIXON, SCHADEGG, CLARK, SEVIER, AND WITCRAFT 8This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

screening measure with sensitivity and speci ﬁcity for detecting these
criteria have been established.
A second limitation is that this study used one item to evaluate the
presence of the characteristic symptom of other sensory sensitivities(i.e., hyperacusis, tinnitus, and ASMR); however, the items are notdiagnostic tools, and these data should be interpreted with caution.Future work is needed to more thoroughly evaluate the presence ofother sensory sensitivities and mental health disorders and attemptto disentangle misophonia symptoms and impairment from otherconditions. Third, participants were asked to retrospectively recallhistory of misophonia symptoms and may not accurately recalltheirﬁrst sound trigger or the change in number and intensity of trig-
gers. In addition, few items were used to assess this information. Theliterature on the development of misophonia is limited; therefore,future studies may consider integrating the use of a qualitative inter-view, in-person behavioral assessments, or the integration of a family
member ’s report of symptoms to further understand historical fea-
tures associated with misophonia symptoms. Last, the study used arepresentative sample of U.S. adults; however, the ﬁndings may
not generalize to other countries. Continued research in this area isnecessary to understand the worldwide prevalence of misophonia,as well as cultural differences in the description and perception ofsound sensitivities. For instance, minoritized racial/ethnic groupsmay describe sound sensitivities differently than White individuals,and/or in a way that is not captured by these measures, which werevalidated among predominantly White samples ( Schröder et al.,
2013 ;Wu et al., 2014 ). Future work is needed to examine alternative
measures of misophonia to further evaluate racial/ethnic and culturaldifferences in prevalence of misophonia.
In conclusion, this study estimated the prevalence of misophonia
in the largest and most diverse sample to date. These data expandknowledge on misophonia and represent a critically important steptoward establishing population norms. The key ﬁndings indicate
that misophonia symptoms are somewhat common; yet, a small por-tion of individuals experience clinical levels of symptoms. In addi-tion, analyses revealed that misophonia symptom severity wasaffected by gender, age, education, marital status, work status, andhousehold income, suggesting that certain individuals are dispropor-tionately affected by misophonia. Among individuals with clinicallevels of misophonia, symptoms appear to onset early in life, are per-sistent, and contribute to signi ﬁcant life impairment. Continued
research in this area and future replication of these ﬁndings with
questionnaires that assess misophonia diagnostic criteria are critical.
