Introduction: The purpose of the present study was to investigation the relationship between misophonia
symptoms and autistic traits in adults. In accordance with this investigation, the purpose of the present study
was to determine whether misophonia is a symptom of autism.Method: The study included 445 participants without psychiatric disorders or hearing impairments. Self-
report questionnaires were utilized to evaluate the severity of misophonia symptoms and autistic traits. On
the basis of the results of the self-report questionnaires, statistical analyses were conducted.Results: Misophonia scores were found to be higher in females than in males but did not correlate with age,
smoking, or alcohol consumption. Examining the autistic characteristics reveals that gender, age, and smok-
ing have no effect on the total autism scores. Examining the association between the degree of misophoniaand autistic traits reveals that they have a considerable impact on one another.
Discussion: Our findings indicate that there is a correlation between the severity of misophonia and autistic
traits. However, our limitations and the fact that some of our results differ from those of previous researchindicate that additional research is necessary in this area.
Keywords: misophonia; autistic traits; smoking; drinking; gender
Introduction
The term ‘misophonia ’, first used by Jastreboff in 2001 ,
is a person ’s disproportionate emotional response to
other people ’s everyday sounds, animal sounds, and
ambient sounds such as keyboard and pen tapping,
regardless of decibel (Jastreboff and Jastreboff
2001,Jastreboff and Jastreboff 2014 , Bernstein et al.
2013 , Edelstein et al. 2013 , Schr €oder et al. 2013 , Kumar
et al. 2014 , Schneider and Arch 2017 , Erfanian et al.
2019 ). In many studies, it has been stated that the emo-
tional reactions experienced by people can be severe
reactions such as distress, discomfort, anxiety, anger,
disgust, hatred, and sometimes loss of control (Schr €oder
et al. 2013 , Kumar et al. 2014 ,W u et al. 2014 , Dozier
2015 , Boyce 2015 ). Various sounds, such as breathing,
wheezing, chewing, eating, slurping, lip smacking, pen
clicking, writing, or cracking knuckles, that cause thesereactions are defined as misophonic triggers (McKay
et al. 2018 , Schr €oder et al. 2013 , Kumar et al. 2014 ,
Sanchez and Silva 2018 ). Since studies on misophonia
are new and few in number, there is no definiteinformation about its prevalence. According to the
results obtained from various studies, its prevalence inthe general population is estimated to be around 3%(Jastreboff and Jastreboff 2014 ). A study done in Turkey
found that 12.8% of people have misophonia, and 43.5%of people with misophonia said that they had first-degreerelatives with similar symptoms (K ılıc¸et al. 2021 ). This
suggests that genetic transmission may have an effect onmisophonia.
A growing number of studies have attempted to shed
light on the clinical manifestations of misophonia.However, the question of whether misophonia is a diseasealone or a symptom of psychiatric disorders accompaniedby sensory sensitivity remains controversial. According toDSM-5 diagnostic criteria, increased or decreased sensi-tivity to sensory stimuli is a feature of autism spectrumdisorder (ASD). In a recent study, Rinaldi et al. found that
autistic traits were higher in individuals with misophonia(Rinaldi et al. 2022 ). One of the researchers working on
misophonia around the world, Williams et al. , did a study
comparing the severity of misophonia in autistic and non-autistic populations. They found that autistic people had
worse misophonia symptoms than non-autistic people

(Williams et al. 2022 ). This begs the question of whether
or not misophonia is an ASD symptom. There is variousevidence for the relationship between ASD and misopho-nia. Misophonia is associated with a variety of neurodeve-
lopmental disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) and tic disorders, and its intensitychanges with the treatment of these conditions (Martinoand Hedderly 2019 ,N o r r i s et al. 2022 ). This shows that
autism, one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmentaldisorders, and misophonia may be related. Another ofthese points of evidence is that the comorbidities that can
accompany both conditions are similar. Compared to indi-
viduals without misophonia, those with misophonia exhib-ited distinct differences in perfectionism, depression,anxiety sensitivity, and obsessive-compulsive disorder(Cusack et al. 2018 , Eijsker et al. 2019 ,J a g e r et al. 2020 ).
These characteristics are known to be associated with aut-ism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Greenaway and Howlin
2010 ,M e i e r et al. 2015 ). Another piece of evidence is that
people with misophonia have more autistic personalitytraits than those without (Rinaldi et al. 2022 ).
Nonetheless, it should be underlined that although peoplewith ASD are sensitive to sudden and unexpected sounds,persons with misophonia are sensitive to mild sounds in
everyday life (Robertson and Simmons 2013 , Tavassoli
et al. 2014 ). These differences make it difficult to deter-
mine the nature of the association between misophoniaand ASD. There is a need for additional research to eluci-date the association between misophonia and ASD.
According to our research, there is only one study
examining the relationship between misophonia and
autistic characteristics. In this study, the autistic symp-toms of individuals with misophonia were comparedwith those of the control group (Rinaldi et al. 2022 ). In
our study, the relationship between misophonic symp-toms and autistic traits was investigated in a normal
sample without a psychiatric disorder diagnosis. In light
of the preceding information, we hypothesized in ourstudy that as the severity of misophonia symptomsincreases, so will autistic traits.
Method
Participants
After reading the consent form, The Amsterdam
Misophonia Scale-Revised (AMISOS-R) and the AutismSpectrum Quotient (AQ) were administered to 500 stu-
dents between the ages of 18 and 28 at the Isparta
S€uleyman Demirel University Faculty of Medicine. The
criteria for exclusion from the study were: (1) the exist-ence of a psychiatric disorder (e.g. depression, bipolardisorder, anxiety disorder, ADHD), (2) a history of tak-ing psychotropic medications, (3) the existence of hear-
ing problems (e.g. partial deafness).
The study procedures adhered to the 2013 version of
the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable local lawsand regulations governing human research. The SDU eth-
ics committee approved the study protocol (2022/18-251).
Instruments
Data form
We used an interview form to gather information about
the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants,such as age, gender, and comorbid mental illnesses.
Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)
It was developed by Baron-Cohen et al. as a self-assess-
ment screening instrument to determine the degree to
which people with normal intelligence exhibit autisticsymptoms (Baron-Cohen et al. 2001 ). It is a 50-item
self-report questionnaire examining subclinical autistic
symptoms (Is ¸iket al. 2020 , Rinaldi et al. 2022 ). There
are 4 possible responses for each item (definitely agree;
slightly agree; slightly disagree; definitively disagree)and each item is labeled either ‘0’(non –ASD-like) or ‘1’
(ASD-like) (Baron-Cohen et al. 2001 ). The question-
naire yields a score between 0 and 50 points based on theresponses. The higher the score, the greater the autistic
features. Kose et al. analyzed the validity and reliability
of the AQ in the Turkish population (Kose et al. 2010 ).
The Amsterdam Misophonia Scale-Revised
(AMISOS-R)The Amsterdam Misophonia Scale-Revised Form is a
self-report instrument that measures the presence and
severity of symptoms in response to particular auditory
stimuli (Cakiroglu et al. 2022 ). It is the revised version
of the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale, which was inspiredby the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
(OCD) Scale (Schr €oder et al. 2013 , Jager et al. 2020 ,
Naylor et al. 2021 ). It is a broader measurement instru-
ment that evaluates the impact of misophonia on func-
tioning, distress, efforts to resist, attempts to control
voices and thoughts, and avoidance (Schr €oder et al.
2013 , Jager et al. 2020 , Naylor et al. 2021 ). After partici-
pants are asked which sounds they are sensitive to andhow these sounds make them feel, a 10-item rating sec-
tion is administered. Each item is rated between 0 and 4
points. The highest score to be obtained from the scale is
40 points. The severity of misophonia is classified based
on the obtained score as normal and subclinical misopho-nia, mild misophonia, moderate and severe misophonia,
or severe and extreme misophonia. Cak ıroglu et al. ana-
lyzed the validity and reliability of the AQ in the Turkishpopulation (Cakiroglu et al. 2022 ).
Statistical analyses
The study ’s data were analyzed with SPSS (Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences) version 26.0. The data
are expressed as a number (n), a percentage (%), a mean-
± standard deviation (SD), or a frequency. Analyzing
continuous variables between male/female,Emre Ert €urk et al. Correlation between misophonia symptoms and autistic

smoking/non-smoking, and drinking/non-drinking
groups, a two-tailed independent t-test was utilized. Chi-
square was used to compare categorical variables. UsingPearson correlation analysis, the relationship between
misophonia severity, total autism score, age, and gender
was evaluated. A p-value of 0.05 or less was deemed
statistically significant.
Results
500 participants were given scales; however, 12 declinedto participate, and 43 were excluded based on the exclu-sion criteria ( Figure 1 ). The study included 445 individu-
als between the ages of 18 and 28, including 249 females
(56%) and 196 males (44%). The mean age of the
women was 20.71 ± 1.86 and the mean age of the menwas 20.73 ± 2.16 ( t¼/C00.083; p¼0.934).
The participants ’misophonia scores as determined
by the AMISOS-R are presented in Table 1 . According
to these results; females were discovered to be moresensitive to misophonia than males.
Regarding the question of which sounds they are
more sensitive to than other people, the participantsanswered the most frequent eating sounds (e.g. chewing,smacking, slurping, and swallowing) with 62%. Thisresponse is followed by 35.5% for ambient noises (clockticking noise or similar devices). When the male andfemale results are examined separately, the sound of eat-
ing is the most sensitive sound in both genders. In the
second place, females answered as ambient noises andrepetitive clicking sounds, while males answered asambient noises and nasal sounds ( Table 2 ). When asked
how they feel when they hear these sounds, 56.6% ofparticipants responded as irritation. This rate is followed
by anger at 49.9%.
Table 3 shows the relationship between the total
misophonia score and whether or not a person smokesor drinks. According to the results, the total misophonia
score is unaffected by conditions such as smoking and
alcohol consumption (for drinking; t¼0.469, p¼0.639,
and for smoking; t¼1.377, p¼0.169).
Table 4 presents and compares variables such as gen-
der, smoking, and drinking for AQ and subscale scores.
There was no statistically significant difference between
the total AQ scores of males and females ( t¼0.005;
p¼0.996). In contrast, females had a higher AQ atten-
tion-switching score than males ( t¼2.961; p¼0.003),
while males had a higher AQ communication score(t¼/C02.287; p¼0.023). No significant differences were
observed between smoking status and AQ totals
(t¼/C00.920; p¼0.358) and subscales. The AQ social
skill ( t¼/C02.840; p¼0.005), attention switching
(t¼/C02.071; p¼0.039), communication ( t¼/C02.156;
p¼0.032), and total AQ score ( t¼/C0
3.421; p¼0.001) of
drinkers were lower than that of non-drinkers.
InTable 5 , the relationship between age, gender, the
AMISOS-R total score, the AQ total score, and subscale
scores is presented. Accordingly, as misophonia symp-
toms increase, autistic traits increase significantly(r¼0.154; p¼0.001). Specifically, as misophonia
symptoms intensify, scores for attention switching
(r¼0.15; p¼0.001), and attention to details ( r¼0.199;
p¼0.000) increase substantially. There is no correlation
between age and the AMISOS-R ( r¼/C00.029; p¼0.273)
or AQ total scores ( r¼/C00.030; p¼0.535), but the AQ
social skill score declines with age ( r¼/C00.087;
p¼0.033). While there is no correlation between gender
and AQ total score ( r¼0.000; p¼0.996), we observe
that females are more sensitive to misophonia ( r¼
/C00.104; p¼0.014).
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to determine whether
misophonia is a symptom of ASD by examining the rela-
tionship between adult misophonia symptoms and autis-
tic traits. Misophonia symptoms were associated withautistic characteristics, and, as predicted, autistic charac-
teristics increased as misophonia symptoms became
more severe.
Misophonia scores were found to be higher in
females than in males but did not correlate with age,smoking, or alcohol consumption. Similar to our find-
ings, Siepsiak et al. found that the severity of misopho-
nia increased with females, but there was no correlationbetween age and misophonia severity (Siepsiak et al.
2020 ). In a study conducted in Turkey by K ılıcet al. ,i t
was discovered that females, young people, and singleshad higher misophonia scores (K ılıc¸et al. 2021 ). In
contrast, Wu et al. found no correlation between

research.Emre Ert €urk et al. Correlation between misophonia symptoms and autistic

gender, age, and the severity of misophonia (Wu et al.
2014 ). Zhou et al. found the severity of misophonia
independent of gender (Zhou et al. 2017 ). Women may
be more sensitive to anxiety than men, which mayexplain why the severity of misophonia was found tobe greater among women in our study. This differencebetween age and gender demonstrates the need for add-itional research in this area.
The findings regarding the sounds to which partici-
pants are most sensitive are consistent with the majorityof previous research (Sakarya and C ¸akmak 2022 ,
Edelstein et al. 2013 , Tunc ¸ and Bas ¸bu/C21g2017 , Cakirogluet al. 2022 ). Differently, in our study, the second most
sensitive sound was ambient noise, whereas in previousstudies, repeating clicking sounds came in second.However, in the studies conducted by Zhou et al. and Wu
et al. , repeated clicking sounds were the most sensitive,
followed by sounds of eating (Wu et al. 2014 ,Z h o u et al.
2017 ). This difference could be attributable to the cultural
circumstances of the study groups.
As far as we are aware, no previous research has
examined the connection between misophonia anddrinking or smoking. It is common knowledge that indi-viduals with certain psychiatric disorders self-medicate
with alcohol and tobacco. That ’s why, in our study, we
analyzed the consumption of cigarettes and alcohol bymisophonia sufferers. However, no significant link wasdiscovered.
Examining the autistic characteristics reveals that
gender, age, and smoking have no effect on the total aut-ism scores. The result regarding gender is particularly
interesting. Previous research has shown that autistic
traits are more prevalent in men than in women, and ithas been hypothesized that this disparity is a result of theTable 1. Distribution of misophonia severity by gender.

differences in personality traits between the sexes (Kose
et al. 2013 , Ruzich et al. 2015 , Murray et al. 2017 ).
Studies that did not find a significant difference in gen-der explained this situation with a very low number offemale participants (Ko et al. 2018 , Poon et al. 2020 ).
The lack of a difference in autistic characteristicsbetween males and females in our study may be attribut-
able to the rising prevalence of hormonal imbalances
such as hirsutism, PCOS, and early menarche, which areassociated with autistic characteristics. The fact that wedid not obtain this information from the participants isone of the limitations of our study.
Several studies have found that autistic traits are
more common in people who have problems with alco-hol and other drugs (Is ¸iket al. 2020 , Bowri et al.
2021 ). In our study, we see that participants withalcohol use had lower autism scores. The reason for
this difference is that none of our study ’s participants
had an alcohol use disorder. Possibly, moderate alcoholconsumption as a socialization tool is associated withreduced autistic traits in individuals. This idea is sup-ported by the lower scores of drinkers on subscalessuch as communication and social skills.
Examining the association between the degree of
misophonia and autistic traits reveals that they have aconsiderable impact on one another. In the study byRinaldi et al. , both adults and children with misophonia
were compared to healthy controls. Both adults and
children in the misophonia group exhibited autistic
traits that were significantly higher than those ofhealthy controls (Rinaldi et al. 2022 ). Simner et al
examined attention in misophonia patients using theTable 4. AQ total and subscale Scores by gender, smoking and drinking.

AQ Attention to Detail subscale. Similarly, the attention
to detail subscale score for individuals with misophoniawas found to be higher than that of controls (Simner
et al. 2021 ). Our study demonstrates that as misophonia
symptoms increase, so do scores on the subscales ofattention to detail and attention switching, corroboratingprevious findings.
Our study was the first to examine the correlation
between the severity of misophonia and autistic symp-toms. Unlike previous research, our study did notinclude a control group. This difference is a strongpoint of this study. However, this study also has several
limitations. As is common knowledge, misophonia is
frequently accompanied by OCD, anxiety disorders, anddepression. Psychiatric symptoms of the participantsincluded in the study were not screened with any inter-view method or psychometric measurement tool. Wejust asked them if you have any psychiatric history. Weexcluded comorbid psychiatric disorders without exam-
ining the association between other psychiatric disor-
ders and misophonia severity. This is the limitation ofour study. Since the autism questionnaire and the miso-phonia scale are actually self-report scales, they may bemeasuring the same symptoms. Therefore, the relation-ship found may not be an etiological link, but may be
due to a measurement bias. This is a limitation.
Another limitation is that we did not investigate hormo-nal imbalances (such as early menarche), which havebeen linked to autistic characteristics.
Controversy exists regarding whether misophonia is
a distinct psychiatric disorder, a comorbid conditionaccompanying other psychiatric diseases, or a symptomof sensory-sensitive diseases such as ASD. However,our limitations and the fact that some of our results dif-
fer from those of previous research indicate that add-
itional research is necessary in this area.
