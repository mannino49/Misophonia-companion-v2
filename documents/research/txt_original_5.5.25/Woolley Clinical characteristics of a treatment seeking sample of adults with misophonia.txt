Clinical sample

Misophonia is characterized by intense emotional reactions to specific repetitive sounds. The clinical characteristics  and  developmental  course  of  misophonia  remain  underexplored,  particularly  in  treatment-seeking adults. In this study, we characterized the onset, symptom progression, trigger noises, and psychiatric comorbidities associated with misophonia. Additionally, we investigated the relationships between these clinical attributes and the severity of self- and clinician-rated misophonia symptoms. The sample included 60 adults with misophonia  enrolled  in  a  randomized  controlled  trial.  Most  participants  (79%)  reported  symptom  onset  in childhood and early adolescence, with symptoms often worsening over time. All participants reported being bothered  by  human  produced  sounds.  However,  responses  to  trigger  noises  vary  based  on  the  context  surrounding the sound. Those who reported equivalent distress across misophonic triggers -regardless of the individual producing the sound -endorsed significantly higher self-reported misophonia symptoms. Approximately half of the sample met diagnostic criteria for another psychiatric condition, with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and generalized anxiety disorder being the most prevalent. These findings underscore the complexity  of  misophonia  and  highlight  the  importance  of  considering  the  individual  clinical  histories  and contextual factors influencing reactions to misophonic sounds.

Misophonia is characterized by intense emotional responses (e.g., anger, hatred, disgust) and physiological arousal in response to specific sounds  (Swedo  et  al.,  2022).  Common  misophonic  trigger  sounds include  chewing,  swallowing,  breathing,  or  non-human  produced  repetitive sounds such as clock ticking (Jager et al., 2020). Misophonia is a multidisciplinary  problem  involving  audiological  and  psychological features.  Current  literature  does  not  yet  provide  enough  evidence  to classify misophonia strictly as a psychological, neurological, or audiological disorder. As research continues to build, experts have agreed to frame misophonia as a disorder of decreased sound tolerance (Swedo et al., 2022). In the interim, continued research is needed to deepen our knowledge of misophonia and its clinical characteristics.

2024;  Dixon  et  al.,  2024;  Kılıç  et  al.,  2021).  The  level  of  functional impairment  due  to  misophonia  symptoms  is  essential  in  identifying clinically significant cases. Functional impairment in misophonia may manifest as the avoidance of going to restaurants with family or friends to  prevent  the  distress  associated  with  hearing  chewing  and  mouth sounds. Individuals with misophonia who experience such functional impairments  report  significantly  higher  levels  of  general  psychopathology,  including  anxiety  and  depression,  lower  quality  of  life,  and poorer interpersonal emotion regulation skills (Mollmann et al., 2023). ¨ Given the complex and impairing nature of misophonia, more research is needed to understand and characterize its clinical presentation.

Between 33 and 79% of the population is estimated to experience some level of sensitivity to misophonia trigger sounds (Kılıç et al., 2021; Pfeiffer et al., 2024). However, the prevalence of moderate to severe or clinically significant misophonia symptoms in population-based samples is currently estimated to be between 2.1% and 12.8% (Pfeiffer et al.,

Misophonia typically emerges in childhood and fluctuates in severity over time, contributing to impairment across the lifespan (Jager et al., 2020).  Misophonic  symptoms  are  variable,  with  trigger  sounds  and contexts significantly differing between individuals (Jager et al., 2020). Some people  report  that  misophonic  reactions  are  only  triggered  by certain individuals such as their loved ones, while others report distress

related to sounds from any source, including strangers (Claiborn et al., 2020). Research indicates that misophonia triggers produced by family and  friends,  and  humans  in-general,  can  lead  to  particularly  intense misophonic reactions (Samermit et al., 2022; Siepsiak et al., 2023).

Cowan  et  al. (2022) proposed  that the intense reactions to human-made noises might be explained by the perceived control that individuals assume others have over these triggering sounds. Human-produced noises, unlike some ' impersonal ' sounds (e.g., environmental  sounds  or  noises  produced  by  strangers),  often  carry  an expectation of control,  exacerbating emotional responses when these expectations are unmet. Banker et al. (2022) found supporting evidence that  individuals  with  heightened  misophonia  symptoms  often  overestimate their control in uncontrollable situations, which exacerbates emotional distress when their expectations are unmet. The disparity in control perception and emotional investment may explain why misophonia  symptoms  are  less  intense  with  non-human  sounds  and  underscores the role of context in misophonia-related distress. Additionally, Hansen et al. (2024) demonstrated that trigger sounds can significantly influence social judgments, with misophonic participants rating faces paired with uncomfortable trigger sounds as less likeable. Gaining  a  deeper  insight  into  these  situational  (e.g.,  specific  social contexts)  and  heterogeneous influences on misophonic reactions is a crucial step in characterizing misophonia.

Understanding  the  psychological  conditions  that  co-occur  with misophonia is also important. However, previous studies have primarily relied on participants ' self-reports of prior diagnoses to gauge comorbidities  (e.g.,  Rouw &amp; Erfanian,  2018).  Few  studies  have  employed structured  clinical  interviews  to  assess  the  prevalence  of  psychiatric comorbidity among individuals with misophonia. A notable exception is a recent large-scale study of 207 adults by Rosenthal et al. (2022), where researchers conducted structured clinical interviews to examine current and lifetime psychiatric disorders using the structured clinical interview for  DSM-5  (SCID-5;  First,  Williams,  Karg, &amp; Spitzer,  2015a)  and  the structured clinical interview for DSM-5 personality disorders (SCID-5-PD; First,  Williams,  Benjamin, &amp; Spitzer,  2015).  Their  study found  that  approximately  57%  of  participants  presenting  with  misophonia symptoms were affected by anxiety disorders, with social anxiety disorder  and  generalized  anxiety  disorder  being  the  most  prevalent. Mood disorders were the second most common comorbid conditions, with nearly half of the sample diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Similarly, other studies utilizing diagnostic interviews have consistently identified anxiety and mood disorders as the most common psychiatric comorbidities in individuals with misophonia (see Guzick et al., 2023; Jager et al., 2020).

Misophonia is also suspected to co-occur at high rates with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD)  and  autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD).  However,  these disorders are less commonly assessed using appropriate diagnostic tools in  misophonic  samples.  However,  Jager  et  al.  (2020) utilized  the MINI-International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  Plus  (MINI-plus)  to assess the prevalence of ADHD and ASD in a sample of psychiatric patients with suspected misophonia, finding prevalence rates of 5% and 3%,  respectively.  Self-report  studies  have  suggested  that  ADHD  may occur in roughly 12 -18% of individuals with misophonia (e.g., Rouw &amp; Erfanian, 2018). Schroder et al. (2013) hypothesized a potential overlap between ADHD and misophonia given both disorders are marked by challenges in distractibility and fluctuating attention across visual and auditory stimuli. Supporting this hypothesis, recent neurological studies support the notion that misophonia symptoms may be associated with difficulties in sustained attention (Abramovitch et al., 2024).

Additionally, misophonia has historically been suggested as a variant of (OCD; e.g., Schroder et al., 2013), but the existing data do not strongly ¨ support  this  association  (McKay  et  al.,  2018).  In  fact,  across  studies utilizing semi-structured diagnostic interviews, OCD has emerged as a rarer  co-morbidity  (e.g.,  prevalence  rates  between  2.8%  and  8.2% Rosenthal  et  al.,  2022;  Jager  et  al.,  2020).  Thus,  the  relationship between  misophonia,  and  as  previous  findings  have  demonstrated, misophonia may be more closely related to other psychiatric conditions.

The growing need to accurately characterize misophonia is evident, yet the current state of the literature remains constrained by methodological limitations that must be addressed as we move closer to formal diagnostic  classification and  effective interventions.  A  substantial portion of existing research has relied on online self-report questionnaires and platforms like MTurk (e.g.,Cusack et al., 2018). Although online research allows for sampling from a wide range of people and locations, it presents challenges in recruiting clinically representative samples without face-to-face clinical interviews. Additionally, large-scale  phenotyping  studies  that  include  structured  clinical  interviews for assessing comorbidities (e.g., Jager et al., 2020; Rosenthal et al., 2022) often do not incorporate structured interviews to confirm the inclusion of individuals with clinically elevated levels of misophonia,  instead  relying  on  participants ' self-identification  or  self-report questionnaire-based criteria.

To enhance the reliability of misophonia research, the use of semistructured  interviews  specifically  assessing  misophonia  symptoms,  as seen in recent studies (e.g., Guetta et al., 2022), is essential. These interviews would help ensure that clinical samples accurately represent individuals with misophonia. As research on misophonia interventions increases (see Rosenthal et al., 2023), it is crucial to approximate the characteristics of individuals who are likely to seek treatment. In-person research  with  self-report  and  clinician  rated  measures  can  provide  a fuller  picture  of  the  clinical  presentation  of  misophonia  and  provide utility in intervention development.

This study describes the clinical features of misophonia in a treatment seeking sample, including the age of onset, course of the condition over time, characterization of triggers, and context of the triggers. We also  identify  and  describe  diagnostic  comorbidities.  Furthermore,  we explore the relationships between these clinical features and the overall severity of misophonia, as indicated by both participant self-reports and clinician assessment.

## 1. Methods

## 1.1. Participants

Participants  were  eligible  for  the  study  if  they  met  the  following criteria: (a) 18 years of age or older, (b) seeking treatment for misophonia, and (c) met a clinical cut-off for misophonia (total score of 20 or higher on the Duke Misophonia Interview; Guetta et al., 2022). Psychological comorbidity was not an exclusion criterion, with the exception  of  psychological  and/or  neurological  impairments  that  would preclude them from participating in the study (e.g., profound neurological  impairment) or exceed misophonia as the primary presenting difficulty (e.g., current mania).

## 1.2. Procedures

This project is funded by (masked for review). All study procedures were  pre-registered  on  open  science  framework  (OSF;  https://osf. io/9mwpd/?view_only = f7789c49dffe4a829cc6e504daac4bdc) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05601284) as part of a randomized controlled treatment trial for misophonia (see masked for review). All procedures were approved by a University Institutional Review Board.

Participants were recruited from November 2022 to November 2023 via local flyers and social media posts advertising treatment for misophonia on online platforms (e.g., Facebook Ads). Participants interested in  the  study  were  directed  to  an  informational  webpage  where  they completed an eligibility screener. A total of 261 individuals filled out the online screener, which included the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014 [see Measures section]). To be eligible for further participation, individuals needed to score above 5 (indicating at least mild impairment)  on  the  MQ  severity  item  and  confirm  their  interest  in

receiving treatment for misophonia. After the initial online screening, 232 qualified individuals were contacted via email to schedule a clinical interview to further assess eligibility. A total of 75 individuals responded to the email, consented to participate, and attended an intake appointment where they were given a structured interview to assess misophonia, the  Duke  Misophonia  Interview  (DMI;  Guetta  et  al.,  2022). Participants also completed a self-report questionnaire assessing sociodemographic  characteristics  and  misophonia  symptoms  during  the intake. Following the clinical interview, all participants were administered a comprehensive audiological assessment under the supervision of an audiologist as part of the larger clinical trial to identify peripheral hearing  deficits  such  as  hyperacusis  or  profound  hearing  loss  (see masked for review for more details on audiological procedures). Participants  were  eligible  for  treatment  if  they  met  the  pre-determined cutoff score of 20 on the DMI total score, constituting a score that fell one standard deviation below the mean in the original validation of the measure (Guetta et al., 2022). Psychiatric comorbidities were diagnosed by a graduate student clinical assessor using a semi-structured interview.

The final sample included 60 participants. Fifteen participants were excluded from the final sample due to subclinical misophonia symptoms (n = 9), sound sensitivities related to a trauma response ( n = 2), sound sensitivities related to the volume of the sound ( n = 1), current manic episode ( n = 1), or were no longer seeking treatment for misophonia ( n = 2). All participants were compensated $50 for completing the clinical interview and self-report questionnaire.

## 1.3. Measures

## 1.3.1. Duke Misophonia Interview (DMI; Rosenthal et al., 2021; Guetta et al., 2022)

The DMI is an 18-item semi-structured clinical interview designed to assess the presence and severity of misophonia symptoms. This instrument evaluates trigger sounds, the severity of reactions, and impairment on functioning, both currently and over the lifetime.

Participants begin by completing the DMI Checklist independently, which lists potential misophonic triggers and contexts that exacerbate reactions.  The  checklist  aids  clinicians  in  identifying  relevant  misophonic triggers. The clinician then conducts the interview, starting with background questions about the age of onset, the nature of misophonic triggers  (human-produced, animal-produced, or environmentally produced),  and  the  development  of  misophonia  triggers  and  symptom severity over the individual s lifetime. The interview also explores the ' context of the sounds (i.e., whether the source of the sound affects the reaction). Information collected from both the DMI checklist and preinterview background questions were used to assess trigger type and contexts affecting misophonic reactions.

The DMI is structured such that each item assesses the presence of, frequency  and  intensity,  and  impairment  associated  with  a  specific misophonia symptom (e.g., the experience of  negative emotions ' ' during a misophonic trigger [item six]). In total, the DMI yields four summary scores: current severity, current impairment, global impairment, and total score. Severity of symptoms is evaluated over the past month using a 5-point Likert scale, with total severity scores ranging from 0 to 56 -higher scores indicate greater frequency and distress of symptoms. Impairment is rated on a 3-point Likert scale for current and lifetime contexts, with total scores indicating the degree of functional impairment. The total DMI score aggregates all severity ratings for current symptoms and global impact, ranging from 0 to 72, with higher scores denoting greater overall severity and impairment.

The  DMI  has  demonstrated  excellent  preliminary  internal  consistency, predictive validity, and test-retest reliability (Guetta et al., 2022), suggesting that the DMI is a reliable and valid tool for assessing misophonia in clinical settings. The reliability of the total score ( α = .84) was good, while the reliability for the impairment score ( α = .67) within an acceptable range.

The DMI was administered to all participants by a trained doctoral student clinician. To ensure consistency, the doctoral student and the principal  investigator,  a  licensed  clinical  psychologist,  reviewed  and discussed the scoring of the first 10 participant interviews together. This process allowed them to reach agreement on the scoring for each item. After this calibration, the same doctoral student clinician conducted and independently scored the DMI for the remaining participants.

## 1.3.2. Diagnostic interview for anxiety, mood, OCD, and Neuropsychiatric disorders (DIAMOND; Tolin et al., 2018)

The DIAMOND is a structured diagnostic interview used to assess a wide range of DSM-5 psychiatric diagnoses, with the exception of personality disorders, certain dissociative disorders, and certain neurological and neurodevelopmental disorder (i.e., autism spectrum disorder). The DIAMOND demonstrates good to excellent interrater and test-retest reliability for anxiety, mood, and obsessive-compulsive and related diagnoses (Tolin et al., 2018). The DIAMOND was administered to participants by a trained graduate clinician during the clinical intake.

## 1.3.3. Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014)

The MQ is an 18-item self-report questionnaire assessing the severity and characteristics of misophonia. The MQ consists of three subscales: misophonia symptoms (seven items), misophonia emotions and behaviors (10 items), and misophonia severity scale (one item). The symptom subscale assesses the presence of sound sensitivities (e.g., people eating, repetitive tapping) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all true) to 4 (always true). The emotions and behaviors subscale assess the reactions associated with misophonia symptoms (e.g., leave the environment,  become  annoyed)  on  a  5-point  Likert  Scale  ranging  from 0 (never) to 4 (always). The total MQ score consists of the sum score from  the  symptoms  and  emotions/behaviors  subscales  with  scores ranging from 0 to 68; higher scores indicate more misophonia symptoms. The severity subscale consists of a single item assessing the overall severity of misophonia symptoms on a scale from 1 (minimal) to 15 (very severe), with scores of 7 or higher indicating clinically significant symptoms.  The  internal  consistency  of  the  MQ  total  in  the  present sample was acceptable ( α = .74).

## 1.4. Data analysis

All analyses were performed using R software (R Core Team, 2024). Before analysis, data was inspected and no missingness was found in the DMI or MQ. We employed descriptive statistics to evaluate the clinical characteristics of our sample. To explore the relationship between these clinical characteristics and misophonia symptom severity, we conducted a series of linear regression models. Each model was used to independently investigate the influence of individual clinical characteristics on misophonia symptoms, incorporating categorical predictors that divided the sample into dichotomous clinical sub-groupings.

Participants were divided into two groups based on their symptom course; the first group included participants reporting a worsening of symptoms since onset ( n = 38), and the second included participants whose  symptoms  improved  or  remained  steady  ( n = 22).  We  also divided the sample based on trigger type; the first group comprised individuals exclusively bothered by human-produced sounds ( n = 20), and the second group included those bothered by animal or environmentally produced  sounds  in  addition  to  human-produced  sounds  ( n = 40). Furthermore,  we  categorized  participants  according  to  whether  the specific person making the sound affects their misophonic reaction ( n = 36) or whether their reactions generalize to all individuals ( n = 24). Lastly, participants were divided based on the presence of at least one other psychiatric diagnosis ( n = 29) versus no comorbid diagnosis ( n = 31).

We ran all four models using the MQ total score and the DMI total score as dependent variables. Additionally, we used the MQ severity item and the DMI impairment as dependent variables. Each model was

run four times to fully investigate the relationship between each clinical characteristic sub-grouping and misophonia symptoms as measured by the MQ and DMI. The results for the models run with the MQ severity item  and DMI impairment subscale are detailed in the supplemental materials. A post-hoc power analysis revealed that, with group sizes of 20 and 40 participants respectively (representing the most uneven distribution observed), we could achieve an 81% power to detect a large effect size of d = 0.70.

and negative behavioral and emotional reactions to the triggers were elevated at the time of the clinical interview. Participants endorsed an average score of 6.83 ( SD = 1.68) on the MQ severity item, approximating the clinically significant cut-off range of 7 or higher. Average ratings on the DMI revealed a total score was 36.90 ( SD = 5.51) and impairment score of 14.47 ( SD = 3.55), indicating a heightened level of misophonia symptoms and associated psychosocial impairment.

## 2.3. Case history and course of symptoms

The majority of participants identified the onset of symptoms between the ages of 6 -10 years ( n = 26), followed by ages 10 -13 ( n = 14). Fewer participants reported the initial onset both before age 6 and between ages 14 to 18, each constituting 13% of the sample. Notably, onset in the early 20s was more rare ( n = 4). The development of new triggers over time was common, with 85% ( n = 51) of the participants reporting this  occurrence.  Few  participants  reported  previously  trying  medications ( n = 4) or some form of therapy for misophonia ( n = 3). Over the lifetime, a large portion ( n = 38) of the participants reported worsening misophonia symptoms, 16 participants experienced no change, and few ( n = 3) observed improvements. A summary of misophonia case history can be seen in Table 2.

## 2.4. Triggers

The nature of misophonia triggers varied, with 33% ( n = 20) triggered by human-produced sounds and the remainder by a combination of  human,  animal,  and  environmental  sounds.  Specifically,  mouth sounds  produced  through  eating  was  the  most  commonly  reported trigger, with 97% ( n = 58) of participants endorsing this trigger. Eating sounds were closely followed by mouth sounds unrelated to eating (e.g.,

lip  smacking) and nasal sounds, both of which were endorsed by 51 participants. Human-produced repetitive sounds and throat sounds were also  frequently  reported  ( n = 49).  In  contrast,  non-human  produced repetitive noises were reported as triggers by less than half of the sample ( n = 26). Seeing a sound produced without being able to hear it (e.g., watching TV with the volume off, seeing someone eating while wearing headphones) was the least frequently reported trigger ( n = 14). The full summary of trigger  noises  endorsed  by  participants  can  be  found  in Fig. 1.

## 2.5. Contextual influence

Trigger  sounds  produced  by  known  people  (e.g.,  family,  friends, roommates) was the most commonly reported situation exacerbating misophonia  distress  ( n = 51).  Forty-eight  participants  reported  that certain  internal  experiences  (e.g.,  trying  to  focus  or  relax,  fatigue, illness,  physical  sensations,  thoughts,  emotions)  appeared  to  make misophonia  symptoms  worse  for  48  participants.  Furthermore,  quiet environments were identified by 42 participants as problematic. Fewer participants reported situations like noisy places ( n = 18) and when the individual  could  see  the  trigger  occurring  ( n = 21).  Notably,  only  2 participants  reported  that  context  does  not  matter,  highlighting  the specific situational dependency in the experience of misophonia for the large majority of participants. Fig. 2 shows a full summary of specific situational influences on misophonia. In the structured clinical interview, 36 participants reported that it mattered who specifically made the sounds, while the other 24 reported that it did not matter who made the sounds.

## 2.6. Psychiatric comorbidities

Over half of the sample ( n = 31) did not meet criteria for another psychiatric disorder. Fourteen participants met diagnostic criteria for

ADHD and 10 participants met criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. A handful of participants met criteria for other conditions, such as social anxiety disorder ( n = 5), premenstrual dysphoric disorder ( n = 4), and persistent  depressive  disorder  ( n = 4).  A  range  of  other  disorders, including OCD, hoarding disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder, each were reported by 2 participants. Minimal occurrences were noted for tic disorder,  somatic  symptom  disorder,  post-traumatic  stress  disorder, panic disorder, and bipolar II disorder ( n = 1 for each). See a summary of psychiatric comorbidity in Fig. 3.

## 2.7. Associations between clinical characteristics on misophonia symptom severity

Our analysis did not reveal a significant relationship between the worsening  of  symptoms  over  time  and  greater  symptom  severity,  as evidenced by the MQ and DMI total scores ( p = .178 and p = .463, respectively;  see  Tables  3  and  4).  Similarly,  being  bothered  by  both human-produced and non-human-produced noises (e.g., environmental and  animal  sounds)  did  not  significantly  predict  higher  misophonia symptom  severity  compared  to  disturbances  caused  exclusively  by human-produced noises (MQ p = .159; DMI p = .118; see Tables 3 and 4). Notably, a non-person-specific reaction to misophonic triggers ( it ' does not matter who produces the trigger sound ) significantly predicted ' increased MQ total scores ( β = 4.78, p = .024), explaining 8% of the variance, suggesting that a generalized response to triggers is associated with higher symptom severity (see Table 4 and Table S1 in online supplemental  materials).  Conversely,  having  one  or  more  psychiatric comorbidities did not significantly affect misophonia severity on either the MQ or DMI scales ( p = .837 and p = .519, respectively; see Tables 3 and  4).  These  results  suggest  that  the  generalization  of  misophonic triggers, rather than the type of triggers or progression of symptoms, may play a more significant role in the severity of the condition.

## 3. Discussion

This study is one of the few studies to characterize the onset, clinical features, and comorbid psychiatric conditions in adults seeking treatment  for  misophonia.  This  study  advances  misophonia  research  in clinical  samples  by  integrating  structured  clinical  interviews  with traditional self-report measures, enhancing the reliability and depth of insights into its clinical features.

that lead individuals to sign up for treatment may be uniformly high, irrespective of their symptom progression history. Consequently, clinical assessments at intake might focus on the current severity rather than historical changes in symptomatology.

Most  participants  indicated  that  their  misophonic  symptoms  first manifested between the ages of 6 and 14, aligning with previous reports that suggest an average onset around ages 12 to 13 (Jager et al., 2020; Schroder et al., 2017). The emergence of misophonia during childhood ¨ to  early  adolescence  parallels  the  typical  onset  of  other  psychiatric conditions such as phobias, OCD, and tic disorders. This pattern contrasts with anxiety disorders like panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder,  as  well  as  mood  disorders,  which  more  commonly  develop during late adolescence to early adulthood (Kessler et al., 2007). This suggests that the developmental trajectory of misophonia may be more akin to early-onset psychiatric disorders.

Many participants (63%) endorsed their symptoms becoming more intense over time, a trend also reported in prior studies (Jager et al., 2020; Sanchez &amp; Silva, 2018). The increasing intensity corresponds with 85% of the participants reporting that new trigger sounds develop over time. Misophonia has been described as a chronic condition (e.g., Ferrer-Torres &amp; Gimenez-Llort, 2022), which is consistent with the report ´ from  the  current  sample.  Further  studies  are  needed  to  explore  the course  of  misophonia  symptoms  to  understand  why  the  condition worsens for some individuals while improves for others (e.g., n = 6 in the current sample). It is important to note that no significant relationship was found between the historical progression of misophonia symptoms (whether worsening, steady, or improving) and the severity of symptoms at the time of clinical intake. It is possible the severity of symptoms

All  participants  reported  being  bothered  by  repetitive  humanproduced sounds. In their initial set of diagnostic criteria for misophonia,  Schroder et al. (2013) suggested that the sources of misophonic ¨ sounds are typically human. In a large-scale study by Jager et al. (2020), which used diagnostic screening procedures to enroll 575 individuals with misophonia, it was found that 96% were specifically bothered by throat and mouth sounds. These findings led the researchers to propose a revised set of diagnostic criteria, suggesting that oral or nasal sounds must be triggers for diagnosis. While we are not taking a position on diagnostic  criteria,  our  current  study  found  that  97%  of  participants reported issues with eating sounds.

Of note, roughly half of the sample was bothered by sounds from other  sources,  such  as  environmental  noises  (e.g.,  clock  ticking)  and animal-made noises (e.g., licking). However, the presence of additional bothersome  noises  from  these  sources  did  not  correlate  with  more intense misophonia symptoms. This outcome is somewhat unexpected, considering that the presence of more misophonic triggers might logically  provide  more  opportunities  for  triggering  episodes.  Humanproduced  sounds,  particularly  those  made  by  adults,  are  typically more aversive to individuals with misophonia compared to sounds made by animals or babies (Jager et al., 2020). It may be that the triggering effect of human-produced noises, such as eating sounds, on individuals with misophonia is so intense that adding non-human sounds, even if they  are  bothersome,  does  not  further  increase  the  severity  of  the misophonia  symptoms.  Still,  further  research  is  warranted  given  the preliminary nature of these findings.

A substantial number of participants (85%) reported being triggered by sounds made by familiar individuals. In contrast, fewer participants

(40%)  reported  being  triggered  by  strangers,  although  situations involving strangers can still be quite distressing. Our results suggest that, when triggers are not specific to certain individuals, participants tended to report significantly higher misophonia severity on the MQ self-report measure. A possible explanation for the increased severity could be that these  individuals  regard  everyone  as  misophonic  triggers,  which  not only  heightens  their  hypervigilance  towards  misophonic  triggers  but also results in being triggered more frequently, thereby intensifying the presentation of misophonia. However, there was no correlation between the generalization of triggers to all individuals and misophonia severity as measure by the DMI through clinician ratings, which may be due to measurement accuracy or reporting bias. The measurement tools for misophonia, such as the MQ and the DMI, are still in the early stages of development.  For  instance,  the  MQ  has  not  yet  been  validated  in  a clinical sample (Wu et al., 2014), and the DMI has only been psychometrically assessed in one study and its factor structure remains unevaluated  (Guetta  et al., 2022).  As  these  tools improve,  future assessments  should  further  explore  differences  between  individuals whose triggers are specific versus those that generalize to anyone.

We found that a significant number of participants (80%) reported that misophonia intensity can vary depending on internal factors such as focus or relaxation efforts, fatigue, illness, physical sensations, time of day, thoughts, and emotions. Other research, including a recent study by Guetta et al. (2024), has also shown that perceived generalized stress can significantly impact misophonia symptoms. This is consistent with patterns observed in other forms of psychopathology, where internal circumstances influence symptom intensity (Starr &amp; Davila, 2012). In treating misophonia, clinicians should consider these internal factors to personalize treatment approaches. Only two participants indicated that their misophonia distress was unaffected by specific contexts, reinforcing  that  misophonia  distress  is  typically  context  specific.  It  was commonly reported that quiet places, as opposed to loud environments, were more triggering. The fact that quiet environments are more triggering  than  loud  ones  further  support  the  notion  that  misophonia  is distinct from other sound tolerance conditions, like hyperacusis.

Meeting criteria for another psychiatric disorder was common in this sample, with nearly half of the participants diagnosed with an additional disorder. These results support previous findings that the prevalence of psychiatric  disorders  is  significantly  higher  among  individuals  with misophonia  compared  to  the  general  population  (Rosenthal  et  al., 2022). Notably, adults in this sample were most frequently diagnosed with  ADHD  (23%),  more  than  any  other  psychiatric  disorder.  Other research aligns with  these findings, suggesting that ADHD  may commonly co-occur with misophonia (Abramovitch et al., 2024; Rouw &amp; Erfanian, 2018). While our findings reinforce the connection between misophonia and ADHD, further research is warranted considering that this studied relied on clinical interviews (the DIAMOND) for diagnosis, as opposed to the comprehensive assessment batteries typically used to diagnose ADHD.

The  second  most  common  comorbid  condition  participants  met criteria  for  was  generalized  anxiety  disorder,  affecting  17%  of  the sample. This finding aligns with the structured clinical interview results from Rosenthal et al. (2022), who reported a 25% prevalence rate for generalized  anxiety  disorder.  Other  previous  research  (e.g.,  Guzick et al., 2023; Jager et al., 2020), indicate that anxiety and mood disorders occur in approximately 9 -10% of individuals with misophonia, which are more prevalent than conditions historically associated with misophonia, such as OCD and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Indeed, recent literature suggests that OCD and PTSD are no more prevalent in individuals with misophonia than they are in the general population (e. g., Guetta et al., 2024; Jager et al., 2020). While features of these disorders may be observed in those with misophonia (e.g., Cusack et al., 2018), misophonia should not be attributed to the symptoms of OCD or PTSD. Instead, it should be treated as an separate disorder.

Although literature highlights comorbidity as common in misophonia, findings on whether comorbidity is linked to a more severe presentation of misophonia are mixed. Misophonia may be more closely related to specific comorbid disorders rather than comorbidity in general. For instance, symptoms of other psychological conditions generally do not relate to misophonia severity, except in cases involving PTSD and personality disorders (Rouw &amp; Erfanian, 2018; Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2021). Rosenthal et al. (2022) found that the presence of OCD, panic disorder, and symptoms of borderline personality disorder were significant  predictors  of  misophonia  symptom  severity.  In  our  study,  the limited representation of specific psychiatric disorders within our small sample  precluded  an  investigation  into  whether  meeting  diagnostic criteria  for  a  particular  disorder  was  associated  with  misophonia severity.  Instead,  we  assessed  whether  psychiatric  comorbidity  alone could predict greater misophonia severity, but found no significant effect, likely due to the heterogeneity of psychiatric comorbidities in our sample. Future studies with larger samples should continue to investigate  comorbid  psychopathology  in  misophonia,  as  more  insights  are needed  to  distinguish  misophonia  symptoms  from  other  psychiatric disorders, particularly for developing intervention strategies.

## 3.1. Contributions to existing research

As we have alluded to, our study replicates existing research on the age of onset, the common worsening of symptoms over time, common triggers, and frequent comorbid psychiatric disorders, but further substantiates  the  previous  findings  through  its  inclusion  of  a  treatmentseeking  sample  and  use  of  in-person  structured  clinical  interviews. Notably, we identified a new finding that has not been previously reported as far as we know: the lack of person-specific sound

sources -where any person could act as a trigger -might be connected to  greater  severity  in  misophonia.  Moreover,  we  highlight  data  that support that misophonia can intensify depending on various contexts (e. g., quiet places, during times of stress). This finding suggests a potential point of heterogeneity in how misophonia presents across individuals.

## 3.2. Treatment considerations

Nuances  in  clinical  characteristics  should  be  carefully  considered during diagnosis and treatment planning. For instance, it is feasible that individuals who experience distress from a broad range of human triggers, rather than specific individuals, may require different treatment strategies compared to those who are affected only by the sounds produced by select people. As a result, flexible intervention approaches, such as those already being considered (e.g., the Unified Protocol and Process-Based  Therapy;  see  Rosenthal  et  al.,  2023 for  a  review  of person-centered psychotherapies for misophonia), are likely appropriate for individuals with misophonia.

Moreover, individuals  who  report  that  anyone  could  be  a  trigger source may face greater challenges in environments where adaptations, such as noise-canceling devices or leaving a triggering situation, are not feasible.  Examples  of  such  environments  include  classrooms,  public transportation (e.g., buses, trains), waiting rooms, open-plan offices, or crowded  events.  Comprehensive  and  personalized  treatment  for  individuals with misophonia should include multidisciplinary approaches, such  as  cognitive  and  behavioral  strategies,  along  with  audiological interventions like noise-canceling devices (see Bowers et al., 2024 for an example). In addition, accommodations in work or classroom settings may be beneficial, provided that they support adaptive functioning, such as enabling individuals to complete tasks like tests and work

assignments without distraction. Resources for individuals seeking academic  and  workplace  accomodations  are  increasingly  available  on support and advocacy websites such as soQuiet.org.

## 3.3. Limitations

The results of this study should be interpreted with consideration to its generalizability. Our participant pool was largely composed of White women residing in the Western United States. Additionally, a general limitation of the extant misophonia research is that the definition of misophonia lacks consensus across studies. Therefore, we urge readers to interpret our findings while also considering the context of our inclusion  criteria  (a.  participants  must  be  seeking  treatment  for  misophonia, b. endorse a minimum mild severity level on the MQ at initial screening, and c. receive a score of at least 20 on the DMI total scale at intake).

The absence of inter-rater reliability limits our ability to confirm the consistency and objectivity of the scoring. With only one rater, we were unable to compare scores across evaluators to ensure that assessments were not influenced by individual biases. Although the DIAMOND has demonstrated strong inter-rater reliability (Tolin et al., 2018), such data for  the  DMI has not been reported despite its preliminary validation (Guetta et al., 2022). Future studies incorporating multiple raters will enhance the rigor of misophonia research involving structured clinical interviews.

Another  assessment  limitation  is  the  DIAMOND s  restricted  diag-' nostic coverage, allowing assessment of only a select set of DSM-5 disorders.  Notably,  it  does  not  include  personality  disorders  or  ASD. Previous studies have linked personality disorder symptoms, particularly  obsessive-compulsive and borderline personality disorders, with misophonia (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2021; Jager et al., 2020; Rosenthal et al., 2022). Additionally, autistic traits are elevated in individuals with misophonia, with a significant proportion scoring above the threshold for  clinically  significant  levels  of  these  traits  (Rinaldi  et  al.,  2023). Pronounced autistic traits can exacerbate the severity of both conditions (Ertuerk et al., 2023). Future research should employ comprehensive diagnostic tools like the SCID-5 and SCID-5-PD for accurate assessment, which will be essential for distinguishing the unique and shared traits of misophonia and developing comprehensive treatment programs.

## 3.4. Conclusions and Implications for individuals and families living with misophonia

This study advances our understanding of misophonia by detailing its onset, progression, triggers, context dependence, and comorbidities in  a  treatment-seeking  population.  Our  findings  provide  valuable  insights for providers, individuals living with misophonia, and their loved ones. Specifically, misophonia often begins in childhood and worsens over time, with certain sounds triggering symptoms in context-specific ways depending on the individual. Contrary to previous speculations, misophonia does not appear to be linked to OCD or PTSD, though it may co-occur  with  other  psychological  issues,  such  as  ADHD  or  anxiety. However, for many, misophonia develops independently, requiring its own distinct approach in treatment.

We also found that while some people are triggered by sounds made by specific individuals, others experience distress from sounds made by anyone. This distinction is crucial as it influences the severity of the condition, and the strategies needed for management. For those who can be triggered by anyone, broader coping strategies may be necessary to manage misophonia in various settings like classrooms, offices, or public spaces. Recognizing that misophonia varies across individuals and may present  alongside  different  psychological  conditions  can  help  guide more effective, personalized treatment plans. Researchers should focus on refining diagnostic criteria in clinical samples and developing targeted interventions that consider the unique triggers and experiences of individuals with misophonia.
