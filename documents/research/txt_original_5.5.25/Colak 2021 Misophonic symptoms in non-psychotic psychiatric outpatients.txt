Background: Misophonia is commonly described as abnormal or disproportionately aversive and emotional reactions  to  specific  sounds  that  interfere  with  patients ' psychosocial  functioning.  In  this  study,  we  aimed  to investigate the possible associations of specific psychological traits with misophonic symptoms in psychiatric outpatients.

Subjects: Misophonic  Symptoms  Checklist  (MSC),  Eysenck  Personality  Questionnaire-Revised  Short  Form (EPQRS), Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) and Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SASS) were used to assess various psychological  traits  in  a  sample  of  consecutive  outpatients  at  University  Hospital  Psychiatry  Department  in September 2019.

Results: After multiple regression analysis, we found that the MOCI, STAI, EPQRSneuroticism, SASS, and BPAQ predicted misophonic symptoms where only SASS and MOCI were significant predictors.

Conclusions: Our  findings  indicate  that  proneness  to  somatization  and  obsessivecompulsive  symptoms  are significantly associated with misophonic symptoms. These findings contribute to the phenomenological understanding of misophonia.

## 1. Introduction

The term misophonia was introduced by Jastreboff and Jastreboff to describe patients 'who react negatively to specific sounds with specific patterns  and/or  meanings  to  individuals  in  specific  situations ' (Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff, 2001; Rouw &amp; Erfanian, 2018). Although the first descriptions of this condition stemmed from audiology literature related to  hyperacusis;  recently  more  evidence  from  neurophysiology  and neurobiology research has supported its neuropsychiatric features and discussed it as a candidate neuropsychiatric disorder (Song et al., 2014; Brout  et  al.,  2018).  Currently,  misophonia  is  still  not  classified  as  a distinct  psychiatric  disorder  in  any  diagnostic  classification  system though it shares many aspects of a psychiatric disorder (Kumar et al., 2017).

to the oral or nasal origin, which interfere with patients ' psychosocial functioning  (Potgieter  et  al.,  2019;  Taylor,  2017).  Negative  strong emotional and autonomic reactions such as the 'fight or flight ' response are elicited by specific stimuli called 'trigger sounds ' (Edelstein, Brang, Rouw, &amp; Ramachandran,  2013).  Trigger  sounds  include  breathing, wheezing,  chewing,  eating,  slurping,  lip-smacking,  pen  clicking/tapping, typing, and cracking knuckles (Kumar et al., 2017; McKay, Kim, Mancusi, Storch, &amp; Spankovich, 2018). In some cases, images or visual stimuli such as leg-rocking, watching someone chewing, or hair-twiddling, could  provoke  similar  emotional,  behavioral,  and physiological reactions to trigger sounds (Dozier &amp; Morrison, 2017).

Misophonia was described as abnormal or disproportionately aversive and emotional reactions to specific sounds, generally but not limited

Emotional reactions to the stimuli vary from discomfort, anxiety, and distress to irritation, disgust, hate, anger, feeling trapped, impatience and  loss  of  self-control,  and  could  even  be  related  to  the  subject  or context (Edelstein et al., 2013; Potgieter et al., 2019; Schroder, Vulink, ¨ &amp; Denys,  2013).  Indeed,  some  authors  suggested  that  aggressive

outbursts  are  a  central  feature  of  misophonic  conditions  (Kluckow, Telfer, &amp; Abraham, 2014; McGuire, Wu, &amp; Storch, 2015; Schroder et al., ¨ 2013). Besides, physiological or autonomic reactions are reported to be important aspects of misophonia. Autonomic arousal in individuals with misophonia causes a variety of symptoms, possibly due to activation of the  sympathetic nervous  system activated  by 'trigger  sounds ' (Vidal, Vidal, &amp; Lage, 2010). Furthermore, misophonic patients were reported to have specific maladaptive coping mechanisms such as avoidance of social situations in which the trigger sound might occur, which in turn could interfere with the interpersonal and occupational functioning of the patient (Cavanna &amp; Seri,  2015; Schroder et al., 2013; Webber ¨ &amp; Storch, 2014).

Phenomenological features of misophonia have been associated with a  variety  of  psychiatric  disorders.  Obsessive-compulsive  disorders, agoraphobia,  tic  disorders,  mood  disorders,  panic  disorder,  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, eating disorder, trichotillomania, skin picking, and autism spectrum disorders have been reported to have significant associations with misophonic  symptoms  (Cavanna,  2014;  Ferreira,  Harrison, &amp; Fontenelle, 2013; Hazen et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2013; McGuire et al., 2015;  Schroder  et  al.,  2013;  Taylor,  2017;  Taylor,  Conelea,  McKay, ¨ Crowe, &amp; Abramowitz, 2014; Webber, Johnson, &amp; Storch, 2014).

The variability of psychiatric symptoms associated with misophonia might  suggest  a  common  physiopathology  between  misophonia  and psychiatric disorders instead of accepting them as entirely distinct entities  (Taylor,  2017).  Research  on  potential  intermediate  phenotypes between misophonia and psychiatric disorders underlying both entities can be valuable in this respect. Various psychological trait features are defined for the underlying psychopathology of diverse psychiatric disorders  (Rosenstrom  et  al.,  2019).  For  instance,  previous  research  in-¨ dicates anxiety, anger, obsessions, and avoidance behaviours which are also common features in psychiatric disorders could be associated with misophonia (Potgieter et al., 2019).

Personality, especially neurotic traits, is associated with a variety of psychiatric  disorders  (Calati  et  al.,  2008;  Celikel  et  al.,  2009;  Joyce, Light, Rowe, Cloninger, &amp; Kennedy, 2010; Svrakic et al., 2002). Studies indicate that neuroticism is an important personality trait for general psychopathology risk (Ormel et al., 2013; Lahey, 2009). Psychoticism is related to tough-mindedness such as being intolerant, belittling, acting disruptively,  and  lacking  in  empathy  (Heath &amp; Martin,  1990).  Misophonic behaviours of the individuals can be disturbing to others via harsh criticism, anger outburst or failure of empathic understanding of reasonable explanations of the origins of misophonia trigger sounds such as making nasal sounds because of a rhino-sinusitis or hand-tapping due to exam anxiety. These behaviors can be understood as an expression of personality that can be admitted to the psychoticism factor. Furthermore, personality is found to be important in noise sensitivity (Shepherd, Heinonen-Guzejev, Hautus, &amp; Heikkila, 2015). According to this ¨ study, personality can have independent effects, accounted for 33% of the variance, on noise sensitivity. A recent study indicates that sensitivity and emotional reactions towards unpleasant stimuli in misophonic individuals  might  be  related  to  neuroticism  (Daniels,  Rodriguez, &amp; Zabelina, 2020). Therefore, personality, especially neuroticism, could be an important mediator on misophonic symptoms in psychiatric patients which is worth investigating as a candidate trait.

Misophonia was also shown to be related to obsessive and compulsive  symptoms,  especially  with  obsessive  thoughts  (Cusack,  Cash, &amp; Vrana, 2018). Obsessive-compulsive symptoms associated with ordering and  harm  avoidance  dimensions,  not  compulsive  symptoms  such  as handwashing or neutralizing, are shown to be related to misophonia (McKay et al., 2018). Obsessive-compulsive symptoms were also shown as  a  mediator  between  anxiety  sensitivity  and  misophonic  symptom severity (Cusack et al., 2018). These significant results underline the importance of obsessive and compulsive traits in misophonia. However, it is not well established that this is still the case for psychiatric patients that  can  be  valuable  to  investigate  the  associations  between  these conditions. Another important facet of misophonia could be aggressive traits.  However,  trait  aggression  is  not  investigated  and  most  of  the studies were focused on state anger to misophonic triggers (Wu, Lewin, Murphy, &amp; Storch, 2014; Zhou, Wu, &amp; Storch, 2017).

Anxiety is an expected response due to trigger sounds associated with misophonia Dozier &amp; Morrison, 2017). However, little is known about the relations between trait anxiety and misophonia. In a recent study, baseline anxiety (pre-stimulus anxiety level) was found to be directly related to emotional responses towards trigger sounds associated with misophonia (Daniels et  al.,  2020).  Anxiety  was  also  shown  to  be  an important mediator for aggressive reactions towards misophonic sounds (Wu et al., 2014). Anger reactions towards others were also found to be associated with misophonia (McKay et al., 2018). But it is not clear that anger reactions are a state or a trait feature in misophonia. So, both trait anxiety  and  aggression  could  be  important  features  associated  with strong aversive emotions and associated behaviors due to misophonic trigger sounds in psychiatric patients.

Somatosensory amplification is another trait feature that could be associated with misophonia (Barsky, Goodson, Lane, &amp; Cleary, 1988; Venugopal, Mohan, &amp; Chaturvedi, 2006). Somatosensory amplification is defined as a general disposition to experience ordinary bodily sensations  as  uncomfortable  and  disturbing.  Besides,  sensations  that  are mildly noxious or disturbing might be experienced as very painful and catastrophic via the somatosensory amplification process. Somatosensory  amplification  is  a  neurobiologically  valid  and  widely  accepted feature in the pathophysiology of somatic symptom and related disorders  (Nakao &amp; Barsky,  2007;  Çolak  et  al.,  2021).  Somatosensory amplification could interfere with normal sensory processing probably with associated affective and cognitive outcomes (Koteles ¨ &amp; Witthoft, ¨ 2017). Indeed, sensory processing is defined as sequential neural processing for organizing visceral and autonomic sensations from ones ' own body and the external world (Williams, Tinley, &amp; Curtin, 2010), and deficits of sensory processing were suggested as a candidate mediator in the pathophysiology of misophonia (Schroder et al., 2013). Moreover, in ¨ a recent study, misophonia was found to be associated with physical concerns which are defined as sensitivity towards interoceptive sensations as a part of anxiety sensitivity (McKay et al., 2018). Therefore, somatosensory  amplification  would  be  suggested  as  a  potential  trait feature in association with misophonic symptoms.

Evidence suggests that misophonic symptoms, although they fluctuate  slightly  over  time,  emerge  in  adolescence  and  tend  to  have  a chronic course; this, in turn, could be viewed as evidence that certain psychological traits could be features of misophonia (Rouw &amp; Erfanian, 2018;  Siepsiak &amp; Dragan,  2019).  However,  the  association  of  misophonic  symptoms  with  other  psychological  traits  has  still  not  been investigated.  As  mentioned  above,  misophonia  could  potentially  be related to personality (especially with neurotic traits), anxiety proneness,  obsessiveness,  and  aggressive  tendencies.  Furthermore,  somatosensory amplification could be an important candidate for the sensory processing deficits in misophonia. A coherent picture of the relations between associated psychological traits and misophonia can give valuable insights into the underlying causes of this intractable condition. Additionally, results are far from to be conclusive due to the lack of studies  from  clinical  populations.  Trait  phenotypes  associated  with psychiatric disorders can be valuable in this respect.

In  this  study,  we  aimed  to  investigate  the  associations  of  specific psychological trait variables with misophonic symptoms in psychiatric outpatients.  We  hypothesized  that  misophonic  symptoms  could  be positively  associated  with  neuroticism,  trait  anxiety,  obsessiveness, anger, and somatosensory amplification in psychiatric outpatients and predicted by them.

## 2. Methods

## 2.1. Participants

Our  study  was  carried  out  in  the  outpatient  psychiatry  clinic  at University Hospital in Turkey in September 2019. The aim was to enroll enough  number  of  consecutive  outpatients  who  fulfill  the  inclusion criteria according to the calculated sample size. Patients with a minimum of five years of education (primary education level in the country) were asked to participate in the study. Patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, intellectual disability, cognitive disorders, and alcohol/drug-related disorders and marked to severely symptomatic patients were also excluded (mildly symptomatic patients were included).

## 2.2. Procedure

Patients  received  information  about  the  study  and  invited  to participate. Written and verbal informed consents were obtained from patients who agreed to participate to the study. Diagnostic assessments were conducted according to the established routines in the outpatient clinic  and  assessments  for  inclusion  and  exclusion  to  the  study  were done by experienced psychiatrists. Patients who were eligible filled the measures of the study in a single session on the day of their routine psychiatric assessments and treatments. The study has been approved by the local ethics committee.

## 2.3. Measures

## 2.3.1. Sociodemographic data collection

Information about the age, gender, marital, educational, and occupational status of the participants was obtained.

## 2.3.2. Misophonic Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ)

Misophonic Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ) is a 4-point Likert type scale developed by (Oz ¨ &amp; Kılıç, 2017). The checklist assesses both types and severity of misophonic symptoms and includes 50 different sounds. The total score will be between 0 and 150; with higher scores indicating more severe misophonic symptoms. Psychometric assessments of the MSC has shown that the scale is both valid and reliable in assessing misophonic symptoms.

## 2.3.3. Eysenck personality questionnaire revised-short form (EPQRS)

The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Revised-Short Form (EPQRS) is a self-report screening tool designed to assess three dimensions of personality;  extraversion,  neuroticism,  and  psychoticism.  The  instrument consists of 6 yes/no questions for each personality dimension with 6 additional questions belonging to the lying subscale for testing social desirability  bias.  The  questionnaire  was  developed  by  Eysenck  and Eysenck  (1975)  and  was  revised  by  Francis,  Brown,  and  Philipchalk (1992).  The  validity  and  reliability  study  of  the  Turkish  version  of EPQRS was done by Karanci (Eysenck &amp; Eysenck, 1975; Francis et al., 1992; Karancı, Dirik, &amp; Yorulmaz, 2007).

## 2.3.4. Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI)

Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI) was developed by  Hodgson  and  Rachman  and  is  designed  to  measure  subsets  of obsessive-compulsive  symptoms (Hodgson &amp; Rachman, 1977). MOCI comprises 30 yes/no items grouped into four subscales and higher scores indicate more serious obsessive-compulsive traits. The Turkish version of  the  inventory  has  been  shown to have adequate validity and reliability in a study conducted by Erol and Savasir (Erol &amp; Savasir, 1989). In the Turkish form, seven items from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was added.

## 2.3.5. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)

State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was developed by Spielberger and Gorsuch and aims to measure both state and trait anxiety levels of individuals (Gaudry, Vagg, &amp; Spielberger, 1975). The Turkish version has adequate psychometric properties shown in a study by Oner (Oner, ¨ 1997). The instrument comprises 40 items grouping into two distinct categories: state and trait. The trait anxiety part of STAI was used in this research which comprises a total of 20 questions. Higher scores indicate higher trait anxiety.

## 2.3.6. Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ)

Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) was developed by Buss and Perry and revised by them in 1992 (Buss &amp; Perry, 1992). It measures 4 dimensions of personality: physical and verbal aggression, rage, and hostility. The instrument comprises 29 5-point Likert-type items. Higher scores indicate higher levels of aggression. The Turkish version of BPAQ had  high  internal  consistency  (Chronbach s  alpha  .85)  and  stability ' (reliability coefficients 0.97) (Demirtas-Madran, 2012).

## 2.3.7. Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SASS)

Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SASS) was developed to assess the amplification of various somatic and visceral sensations that are not the  symptoms of serious diseases. It  measures various  domains  from bodily  and  visceral  sensations  such  as  auditory,  visual,  noxious,  or visceral sensory modalities. It was created by Barsky and translated to Turkish by Güleç &amp; Sayar (Barsky, Wyshak, &amp; Klerman, 1990; Güleç &amp; Sayar, 2007) with high internal consistency (Chronbach s alpha .78) and ' test-retest reliability (0.73). The instrument comprises 10 5-point Likert type  items.  The  score  ranges  from  10  to  50  points.  Individuals  with higher scores are more prone to perceive somatic sensations as more intense and disturbing.

## 2.4. Statistical analyses

Descriptive  variables  were  given  by  mean  SD,  n  (%)  or  median (range), appropriately. T-tests were conducted for MSQ scores in demographic groups. Pearson or Spearman correlation was performed to investigate the association between misophonic symptoms and MOCI, EPQRS,  BPAQ,  STAI,  SASS  according  to  the  normality  assumptions, appropriately. Mann-Whitney U and independent samples t-tests were conducted for group comparisons in terms of MSQ scores and admission status  (first  admission  or  one  than  more  admission)  and  medication status (use or no-use), respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to explore independent associations between each risk variable as a predictor of MSQ using the 'enter method . All the pre-' dictors  in  a  block  were  entered  in  a  single  step.  MOCI,  EPQRSneuroticism, BPAQ, STAI, and SASS were included as independent variables  in  the  model.  Multicollinearity  analyses  were  conducted  for testing possible correlations between these variables. Total sample size of n = 138 was calculated by g-power program (effect size f 2 = 0.15, α err prob = 0.05, power = 0.95 with 5 predictors). Data of patients with missing values were excluded from further analyses (n: 23). All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Science  (SPSS,  version  23.0  for  Windows).  A  p-value  of &lt; .05  was considered to be statistically significant.

## 3. Results

A total of 163 patients enrolled in the study and data from 140 patients were included in the final analyses. MSQ scores were not significantly  different  according  to  socio-demographic  variables  as  gender (t =GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.622; p = .535), educational (F = 1.735; p = .180), marital (t =GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.091; p = .928) and occupational (t = 0.516; p = .626) status.

Overall, 120 patients (85.7%) were under follow-up and 20 patients (14.3%) were during first admission. There was no difference between these groups in terms of MSQ scores (Z =GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.569, p = .570). Diagnosis of

the  patients  were  as  follows:  depression  (n:  29;  20.7%),  generalized anxiety disorder (n:17; 12.1%), generalized anxiety disorder-not otherwise specified (n: 13; 9.3%), adjustment disorder (n: 18; 12.9%), obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (n:  5;  3.6%),  attention  deficit  and  hyperactivity disorder (n: 9; 6.4%), insomnia disorder (n: 7; 5.0%), panic disorder (n: 7; 5.0%), social anxiety disorder (n: 4; 2.9%), functional neurological symptom disorder (n: 4; 2.9%), trauma related disorders (n:  3;  2.1%),  eating  disorder  (n:  2;  1.4%),  sexual  dysfunction  (n:  2; 1.4%), tic disorder (n: 2; 1.4%), gender dysphoria (n: 2; 1.4%).

Of these, 109 (77.9%) patients were using psychotropic medications. From these, 75 (53.6%) patients were on monotherapy, and 34 (24.3%) patients were on combination therapy in terms of psychotropic medication. Only a small number of patients (n: 11; 7.8%) were on psychotherapy and last, 20 (14.3%) patients were on their first admission as mentioned above. There were no significant difference between patients who were on medication or not in terms of MSQ scores (t = 0.791; p = .430). Medication status were as follows: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (n: 55; 39.3%), selective serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (n: 8; 5.7%), SSRIs + antipsychotics (AP) (n: 19; 13.6%), SNRIs + AP (n: 5; 3.6%), SSRIs + atypical or tricyclic (TCA) antidepressants (n: 7; 5.0%), TCA (n: 3; 2.1%), psychostimulants (n: 7; 5.0%), SSRIs + psychostimulants (n: 3; 2.1%), atypical antidepressants (n:2; 1,4%). Sociodemographic, clinical and psychological variables of the sample are given in Table 1.

There were significant weak correlations between MSQ and EPQRSneuroticism  (rho = 0.179;  p = .039);  mild  correlations  between  MSQ and BPAQ (r = 0.310; p &lt; .001), STAI (r = 0.362; p &lt; .001) and moderate  correlations  between  MSQ  and  MOCI  (r = 0.431;  p &lt; .001),  SASS (r = 0.546; p &lt; .001). Other character traits, extraversion (rho =GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.107;  p = .221)  and  psychoticism  (rho = 0.050;  p = .566),

were  not  related  with  MSQ  scores.  Age  was  not  related  with  MSQ (r = 0.131; p = .125). Age was inversely correlated with BPAQ (r =GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.215; p = .013) but not with MOCI (r = 0.104; p = .225), EPQRSneuroticism  (rho =GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.113;  p = .198),  STAI(r = 0.028;  p = .748)  and SASS (r = 0.129; p = .137). Correlations of MOCI, EPQRS, BPAQ, STAI and SASS between MSQ were given in Table 2.

Analysis conducted to see if the data met the assumption of collinearity  indicated  that  multicollinearity  was  not  a  concern  (BPAQ, Tolerance = 0.77, VIF = 1.28; SASS,  Tolerance = 0.72, VIF = 1.372; STAI, Tolerance = 0.44, VIF = 2.24; MOCI, Tolerance = 0.43, VIF = 2.32;  EPQRS-neuroticism,  Tolerance = 0.60,  VIF = 1.64).  In  the multiple  regression  analyses,  these  variables  significantly  predicted MSQ  scores  and  explained  32.5%  of  the  variance  (R 2 = 0.352,  F (5,119) = 12.953, p &lt; .001). The analysis shows that STAI (Beta = 0.04, t(124) = 0.32, p = .747), BPAQ (Beta = 0.15, t(124) = 1.74, p = .083), EPQRS-neuroticism  (Beta =GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.13,  t(124) =GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1.40,  p = .162)  did  not significantly  predict  MSQ  scores,  however  only  SASS  (Beta = 0.39,  t (124) = 4.52, p &lt; .001) and MOCI (Beta = 0.25, t(124) = 2.25, p = .026) scores were the significant predictors in the full model (see Table 3).

## 4. Discussion

In this study, we investigated the association of trait psychological variables with misophonic symptoms and significant correlations were found between misophonic symptoms and various psychological trait variables  such  as  obsessive-compulsive  symptoms,  neuroticism,  trait anxiety, somatosensory amplification, and aggression in non-psychotic psychiatric  outpatients.  No  significant  correlations  were  found  between  misophonic  symptoms  and  the  other  personality  dimensions namely extraversion and psychoticism. Sociodemographic and clinical variables  were  not  associated  with  MSQ  scores.  Multiple  regression analyses  showed  that  a  full  model  consisting  of  scores  of  EPQRSneuroticism, BPAQ, STAI, SASS, and MOCS significantly predicted the misophonic symptoms. However, MOCS and SASS remained to be significant in the full model even after adjustment. This is the key finding of our study which requires further consideration.

## 4.1. Neuroticism and misophonia

Neuroticism,  not  psychoticism  or  extraversion,  correlated  significantly with misophonia symptoms. Previous studies indicate personality could be an important mediator on noise sensitivity (Stansfeld, Clark, Jenkins, &amp; Tarnopolsky, 1985; Stansfeld, 1992). Also, neuroticism was shown to be positively related to noise sensitivity where extraversion was inversely related (Dornic &amp; Ekehammar, 1990). However, this was not replicated in another study (Shepherd et al., 2015). To our knowledge, the only study on the association between neuroticism and misophonia was conducted by Daniels et al. (2020). The primary measure of the study was not assessing personality but neuroticism was used as a covariate. In that study, neuroticism was found to be related both to sound sensitivity and emotional behaviours towards misophonia trigger sounds.  Therefore,  our  results  were  in  line  with  the  findings  of  the aforementioned study. As a general risk factor towards psychiatric disorders,  neuroticism could be accepted as an important psychological trait towards misophonia; however, it did not remain as a significant predictor in the full regression model. So, to our opinion, this finding indicates that misophonia is a stable and distinct entity irrespective of personality. To our knowledge, ours was the first study that reports an association between misophonia symptoms and neuroticism in a clinical group. This finding needs to be replicated in further studies both for clinical and non-clinical samples.

## 4.2. Trait aggression and misophonia

Trait  aggression  evaluated  by  BPAQ  correlated  significantly  with misophonia  symptoms;  however,  it  did  not  remain  a  significant

predictor in the full regression model. Wu et al. (2014) have previously reported a significant association between anger outbursts and misophonia. In this study, also anxiety was a mediator for anger reactions towards misophonia. Similar results were also shown in another study (Zhou et al.,  2017).  In  these  studies,  the  'Rage  Outbursts  and  Anger Rating Scale ' were used to assess symptoms in the previous weeks unlike our assessment with BPAQ which reflects trait aggression. Aggressiveness was not also a robust feature in another study although mild correlations  towards  misophonia  were  observed  (McKay  et  al.,  2018). Therefore, our results are in line with this finding that trait aggression is not a robust predictor of misophonia. It can be concluded that there are other possible mediators towards anger that could explain the mechanism of misophonia. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study that assessed the relation between trait aggression and misophonia.  Future  studies  should  be  conducted  to  explore  the  role  of  trait aggression either as an exogenous or endogenous risk factor for misophonia related behaviours.

## 4.3. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and misophonia

We also  found  a  significant  association  between  misophonic  and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, as measured by MOCI and it remained as one of the significant predictors in the full regression model. This finding  is  in  line  with  previous  researches  that  obsessiveness  is  an important feature of the cognitive model of misophonia (Cusack et al., 2018;  McGuire  et  al.,  2015;  Siepsiak &amp; Dragan,  2019).  Although different  scales such as 'Obsessive-compulsive inventory revised ' and MOCI were used in different populations (e.g. clinical, population-based); it seems to be a robust finding that misophonia has relations to obsessive-compulsive traits in the clinical group.

## 4.4. Trait anxiety and misophonia

Previous studies have reported an association between higher levels of  anxiety  and  misophonia  symptoms  (Quek  et  al.,  2018;  Wu  et  al., 2014), prompting a discussion of misophonia symptoms as a possible consequence of anxiety. However, these studies have used a time scale which only assessed anxiety levels during the previous weeks. We found a  significant  correlation  between  misophonia  symptoms  and  trait anxiety which is defined as an inclination to react anxiously towards general distress. In a recent study conducted by Daniels et al. (2020), trait anxiety was found to be not correlated with misophonic symptom severity; probably due to methodological issues such as sampling and psychometric measures.

On the other hand, the association between anxiety and misophonia is  complicated  which  needs  further  elaboration.  In  our  study,  trait anxiety was mildly correlated with misophonia severity. However, it was not found to be a significant predictor in the full regression model. Therefore, different dimensions of anxiety should be taken into account (Mcwilliams &amp; Brian, 2001). For instance, anxiety sensitivity was suggested as an associated feature of misophonia severity (Cusack et al., 2018). Anxiety sensitivity in misophonia could be defined as a fear of fear  towards  arousal  related  experiences,  as  unpleasant  sounds  in misophonia, which in turn leads to aggressive reactions for coping with the disturbing sensations (Wu et al., 2014). Although we did not have any measures to evaluate anxiety sensitivity, it may  have some substantial effect on misophonia severity (as discussed later). Nonetheless, we showed the first evidence that misophonic sensitivity has a significant positive correlation with trait anxiety in psychiatric outpatients. Future  studies  should  focus  on  the  association  between  different  dimensions of anxiety and misophonia.

## 4.5. Somatosensory amplification and misophonia

We  found  that  the  severity  of  somatosensory  amplification  was significantly  associated  with  misophonic  symptoms  even  in  the  fully adjusted statistical models. McKay et al. (2018) showed that physical concerns as sensitivity towards interoceptive sensations discriminated individuals  with  misophonia  from  non-misophonics  (McKay  et  al., 2018). In that study, Anxiety Sensitivity Index -3 was used to assess the three dimensions (cognitive, social, and physical) of anxiety. Furthermore, Bodily Perception Scale scores which was also another measure for bodily sensations and interoceptive signals was found to have significant  correlations  with  misophonic  symptoms  in  that  study.  In  a previous study, dispositional interoceptive focus, as indicated by body awareness,  was  shown  to  be  an  important  facet  of  somatosensory amplification (Koteles ¨ &amp; Doering, 2016). All these results could indicate a  salient  overlap  between  somatosensory  amplification  and  anxiety sensitivity.

According to Perez, Barsky, Vago, Baslet, and Silbersweig (2015), interactions between enhanced cortical or subcortical sensory processing, cognitive evaluation, and affective modification of visceral or peripheral  stimuli  lead  to  the  way  to  somatosensory  amplification. Attentional bias, negative anticipation, catastrophizing, negative mood which also constitute the core features of misophonia are all proposed to be related to somatosensory amplification (Edelstein et al., 2013; Potgieter  et  al.,  2019;  Schroder  et  al.,  2013).  Indeed,  evidence  from ¨ neuroscientific research could contribute to our findings. For instance, in a recent fMRI study, anterior insula which has a pivotal role in the

perception of interoceptive signals as a part of the salience network; ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hippocampus, and amygdala which are associated with the cognitive and emotional aspects of somatic conditions were found to be associated with misophonia (Kumar et al., 2017). These brain regions are also associated with the neural network of somatosensory amplification (Boeckle, Schrimpf, Liegl, &amp; Pieh, 2016; Bourke, Langford, &amp; White, 2015; Perez et al., 2015). This overlap  can  be  an  important  missing  link  in  the  pathophysiology  of misophonia as a candidate feature in this respect. For example, trait anxiety was shown to be related to enhanced functional connectivity between insula and periaqueductal gray matter that leads to increased pain perception via its effect on thalamo-cortical sensory gating (Perez et al., 2015). Somatosensory amplification with its cognitive amplifiers and  affective  modifiers  which  interfere  with  enhanced  auditory  processing could be the basis of anxiety sensitivity in this regard. To our knowledge, ours is the first study that indicates a possible link between somatosensory amplification and misophonia and this should be investigated in further studies.

## 4.6. Limitations

Although there is a growing interest in misophonia, the basis of its mechanism is still in nascent stages. Research on underlying intermediate  phenotypes  is  valuable  in  this  respect.  We  have  investigated prominent  psychological  traits  associated  with  misophonia  in  a  psychiatric  outpatient sample, however with some limitations. First, the generalizability of our findings to all psychiatric patients is limited since the study sample consisted of outpatients in a single university hospital psychiatry department, and due to the exclusion of psychotic or other severe psychiatric disorders. Second, some of our findings might be due to the number of analyses being carried out and represent type I statistical error. So, this limitation should be bear in mind when interpreting our results. Third, even though we are reporting preliminary evidence for  trait  features  for  misophonia;  state  assessments  still  need  to  be considered in understanding misophonia. For instance; depressed mood could  interfere  with  self-reported  psychological  variables.  For  minimizing the impact of state variables, we only enrolled patients who were mildly symptomatic and we have excluded severe psychiatric disorders. Although diagnoses such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or anxiety disorders could have a stronger inclination towards misophonia; due to the heterogeneity of the psychiatric diagnoses in our sample, it sounds methodologically not feasible to control diverse psychiatric symptoms. Fourth,  self-report  nature  of  the  scales  might  interfere  with  the  outcomes. Finally, the cross-sectional methodology in our study does not allow us to draw conclusions about causality.

## 4.7. Conclusion and future directions

Ours is the first study reporting associations between trait psychological  features  and  misophonic  symptoms  in  a  sample  consisted  of psychiatric  outpatients.  In  line  with  previous  reports  in  non-clinical population we have demonstrated that obsessive and compulsive traits are also significant in the clinical population. Finally, we have found some evidence regarding somatosensory amplification which has some overlaps with anxiety sensitivity as a possible explanation for the etiology. These findings might contribute to the understanding of misophonia  as  a  phenomenological/clinical  entity.  Future  studies  are warranted  to  investigate  the  roles  of  these  constructs,  especially  relations  between  somatosensory  amplification,  obsessive-compulsive traits, anxiety sensitivity as well as different aspects of misophonia.
