Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is characterized by a tingling
sensation with a feeling of relaxation and a state of flow. We explore the neural
underpinnings and comorbidities of ASMR and related phenomena withaltered sensory processing. These phenomena include sensory processing
sensitivity (SPS), synaesthesia, Alice in Wonderland syndrome and misopho-
nia. The objective of this article is to uncover the shared neural substrates anddistinctive features of ASMR and its counterparts. ASMR, SPS and misophonia
exhibit common activations in the brain regions associated with social
cognition, emotion regulation and empathy. Nevertheless, ASMR respondersdisplay reduced connectivity in the salience network (SN), while individuals
with SPS exhibit increased connectivity in the SN. Furthermore, ASMR
induces relaxation and temporarily reduces symptoms of depression, incontrast to SPS and misophonia, which are linked to depression. These obser-
vations lead us to propose that ASMR is a distinct phenomenon owing to its
attention dispatch mechanism and its connection with emotion regulation.We suggest that increased activations in the insula, along with reduction
in connectivity within the salience and default mode networks in ASMR
responders, may account for their experiences of relaxation and flow states.
This article is part of the theme issue ‘Sensing and feeling: an integrative
approach to sensory processing and emotional experience ’.
1. Introduction
Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a nonclinical term to describe
a multidimensional phenomenon primarily triggered by auditory and audio-
visual stimuli [ 1,2]. Individuals who experience ASMR describe a tingling
sensation, originating in the head and spreading down to the body, accompaniedby a feeling of relaxation and a mental state known as ‘flow ’[1,3]. In a flow state, a
person is fully engrossed in an activity, free from self-consciousness, deeply
focused and experiencing a distortion of time [ 4].
The estimated prevalence of ASMR ranges from 23.5 to 28% [ 5,6]. The
common ASMR triggers include auditory and audio-visual stimuli made with
persons whispering, eating, and using objects to make sounds [ 2]. Low-pitched
sounds with dark timbre are effective in inducing ASMR [ 2,7].
ASMR can be regarded as an illusion or altered perception, transitioning from
audio-visual information to tactile sensation. In this article, we compare ASMRwith related sensory phenomena, including sensory processing sensitivity
(SPS), synaesthesia, Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) and misophonia.
Individuals with a SPS trait are easily overstimulated by external stimuli, andresearch has shown that their ASMR intensity is associated with SPS levels [ 8].
Synaesthesia is a phenomenon where a stimulus in one sensory modality elicits
sensations in that modality and other modalities, and a higher prevalence of

synaesthesia has been found among ASMR responders [ 1,6,9]. AIWS is a neurological condition known for distorted perception of the
body and space, and it shares a distortion of time perception with ASMR. In addition, the prevalence of AIWS symptoms among
ASMR responders (46.6%) is higher than the prevalence of AIWS in the general population (approx. 9%) [ 10–12]. Individuals with
misophonia experience negative emotions and aversive responses elicited by specific auditory and visual stimuli. Given the overlapin triggers between ASMR and misophonia (e.g. eating sounds and repetitive tapping), ASMR and misophonia are suggested to share
same mechanisms [ 13]. Although ASMR is linked to positive emotions, and misophonia is associated with negative emotions, there is
a higher prevalence of misophonia among ASMR responders and vice versa [14–16].
This article reviews functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate the brain activations observed in
these phenomena or in individuals who experience these phenomena, with a focus on the following brain regions: the insula and
cingulate cortex (CC) related to social cognition and emotion regulation, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of the reward system, and thesensory-motor system, including the premotor area (PMA), supplementary motor area (SMA) and somatosensory cortex.
Three large-scale brain networks in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), including the salience network (SN), default mode network
(DMN) and central executive network (CEN) ( figure 1 ), are also compared between ASMR and its related phenomena. The SN is
involved in detecting salient stimuli and switching between the DMN and the CEN [ 17]. The DMN is active when a person is at
wakeful rest, such as during mind wandering and introspection. Meanwhile, the CEN is active when a person is engaged in
specific tasks [ 18–22]. Through these comparisons, we aim to elucidate the similarities and differences in the brain circuits in ASMR
and related phenomena. In addition to the brain circuits, we explore triggers, physiological responses, comorbidities and genetic
predisposition associated with these phenomena.
To investigate brain activations and networks in these phenomena, we conducted a search on PubMed using keywords specific
to each phenomenon, along with ‘fMRI ’. In most cases, there are a handful of papers to review. Nevertheless, our search yielded
numerous papers on synaesthesia. As many of these papers provide evidence supporting the theory of increased co-activations or
connectivity across brain regions in synaesthetes, we only referred to some of the most cited papers that support and oppose thistheory. Additionally, we searched for related literature using ‘electroencephalography (EEG) ’and ‘magnetoencephalography
(MEG) ’, but we found a very limited amount of literature using EEG and MEG to investigate these phenomena.
(a) Autonomous sensory meridian response
ASMR elicits physiological responses in ASMR responders, including increased pupil diameters [ 23], enhanced skin conductance
and reduced heart rate [ 24,25]. These observations suggest that ASMR induces arousal and relaxation among these individuals.
There are two types of fMRI studies in ASMR research: task-positive fMRI studies, which compare brain activations in ASMR
responders and non-responders while they watch ASMR videos and control videos; and task-negative rs-fMRI studies, whichcompare brain functional connectivity between ASMR responders and non-responders. In task-positive fMRI studies, brain acti-
vations in the insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), NAc, secondary somatosensory cortex and SMA are more
pronounced for ASMR responders when they experience a tingling sensation during ASMR videos than watching a fixationcross (namely, the control condition) [ 26]. In another study, while both ASMR responders and non-responders watched ASMR
and control videos, ASMR responders showed more activity in the dACC, PMA and SMA in the ASMR condition than in the con-
trol condition, but non-responders only showed increased activity in the cuneus [ 27]. Auditory-only ASMR stimuli have been
shown to increase activations of the insula and NAc compared with the resting condition [ 28]. The involvement of the insula
and ACC suggests the significance of social cognition, emotion regulation and the perception of social pain in ASMR experience
[29,30]. The insula, ACC and NAc are also activated during music-induced chills [ 31–34].
While the activations in the insula and dACC, the key hubs in the SN, increase in ASMR responders when they watch ASMR
videos, rs-fMRI studies showed less connectivity in the precuneus-centred DMN, SN and CEN (except in the left middle cingulate
cortex) in ASMR responders than in non-responders [ 35,36]. Another study revealed higher functional connectivity seeded from

whereas the default mode network primarily comprises medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC).royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 379: 202302522

the posterior cingulate cortex, a major hub of the DMN, to the superior and middle temporal gyri, cuneus, and lingual gyrus when
comparing ASMR videos with resting state [ 37]. In addition to SN, DMN and CEN, other networks such as the sensorimotor and
visual networks have been compared between ASMR responders and non-responders. The results show reduced functional
connectivity in these two networks in ASMR responders [ 36].
The EEG studies exploring brain waves in different frequency ranges show increased alpha-wave activities when ASMR
responders experience ASMR responses (i.e. tingling sensation) to ASMR stimuli [ 38,39]. Interestingly, footstep sounds, a less
common ASMR trigger, were also observed to increased alpha-wave activities, especially among those who were less sensitiveto these sounds and have a positive attitude toward them [ 40]. These findings indicate facilitation of attention-directed information
and inhibition of irrelevant information [ 41]. This implication is consistent with the fMRI finding of insula activation in ASMR
experiences, as the insula plays an important role in salience detection [ 17,42–44].
Although ASMR and autism share auditory sensitivity, there is no evidence supporting the association between ASMR and
autism [ 45]. ASMR videos have been reported to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety [ 1,46].
(b) Sensory processing sensitivity
SPS is defined as a personality trait characterized by being overstimulated by external stimuli, especially the positive ones, with heigh-
tened emotional responses [ 47,48]. SPS exhibits a prevalence ranging from 15 to 31% [ 48,49]. The Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) scale
[49] has been used to measure the level of SPS, in addition to the Orienting Sensitivity subscale of the Adult Temperament Question-
naire [ 50]. The HSP scale comprises three subscales: low sensory threshold (LST), ease of excitation (EOE) and aesthetic sensitivity
(AES) [ 51]. Genetic and twin studies suggest that SPS is influenced by genetic and environmental factors, with the AES subscale dif-
ferentiating from the LST and EOE subscales [ 52,53]. The intensity of ASMR is associated with the AES subscale [ 8], while autism
symptoms, alexithymia, anxiety and depression are linked to the EOE and LST subscales [ 54,55].
There are various triggers for individuals with SPS. In a study subjecting a group of adolescents to a stress test, their changes in
heart rate, heart rate variability and skin conductance were not correlated with SPS, but their perceived stress was associated withSPS [ 56]. The relationship between SPS and subjective perception of stress indicates that the insula, especially the anterior insula,
may play an important role in SPS. The anterior insula has been argued to integrate information from the internal and external
stimuli, and its activity is associated with subjective feeling [ 42].
Several fMRI studies have explored the relationship between SPS levels and brain activations by using various stimuli. The SPS
levels were positively correlated with reaction times to detect major and minor changes in visual stimuli and activations in the
right claustrum, bilateral temporal cortex, bilateral precuneus and right inferior parietal cortex [ 57]. Another study observed
the association between SPS levels and activations in the CC and PMA by using partner ’s and strangers ’faces with different
emotions [ 58]. In addition, the primary somatosensory cortex and ventral tagmental area (VTA) were specifically activated by com-
paring the brain activations for partner ’s and strangers ’happy face. In another study, wherein the participants were touched by an
experimenter, SPS levels were linked to brain activations in the insula [ 59]. Collectively, these findings in fMRI studies highlight the
brain regions related to social cognition and empathy for social stimuli, such as the insula and CC, and those related to the reward
pathway for positive stimuli, such as the VTA.
An rs-fMRI study has shown that the SPS levels were associated with e nhanced brain connectivity within the SN and the dorsal atten-
tion network, as well as the limbic network [ 60]. These findings suggest an important role of attention and emotion regulation in SPS.
2. Synaesthesia
Synaesthesia is a phenomenon wherein a stimulus for a sensory modality elicits sensations in that modality and other modalities.
The prevalence of various forms of synaesthesia is 4.4%, and the estimated prevalence of grapheme –colour synaesthesia, in which
letters and numbers elicit colour perception, is 1.1% [ 61]. Although the presence of synaesthesia in family members suggests a
hereditary connection [ 62,63], a twin study demonstrates that synaesthesia is a heritable condition that is influenced by epigenetic
and environmental factors [ 64]. Previous studies have reported a higher prevalence of synaesthesia in the autism population com-
pared with the neurotypical population. This association between autism and synaesthesia is believed to be mediated by attention
to details and abnormal sensory processing [ 65–69].
Numerous studies have explored the neural basis of synaesthesia and identified activation in the sensory cortices beyond the
stimulated modality and increased connectivity in sensory networks [ 70–73]. An rs-fMRI study revealed increased intranetwork
connectivity from the medial and the lateral visual networks to the right frontoparietal network in grapheme –colour synaesthetes
[74]. Nevertheless, ongoing debate persists about these findings and whether we should consider alternative neural models [ 75].
For example, the report of activation in the insula and CC in synaesthesia should be noted [ 76].
Mirror-touch synaesthesia, which involves experiencing tactile sensations on their own bodies upon seeing someone else
touched [ 77], has been reported in approximately 1.6% of the population [ 78]. Some researchers debate about whether this
phenomenon is a synaesthesia or vicarious experience, an empathetic state induced by seeing someone ’s sensations, emotions
and actions [ 79]. Activations in the somatosensory cortex in mirror-touch synaesthetes may be related to empathy [ 80–83].
Additionally, mirror-touch synaesthetes exhibit higher autistic trait scores compared with the control group [ 84].
(a) Alice in Wonderland syndrome
AIWS is a neurological condition characterized by distorted perception of the body, objects, space and time [ 10,85–87]. These percep-
tual distortions can manifest across the visual (e.g. dysmorphopsia, macropsia, micropsia and teleopsia), auditory and somaestheticroyalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 379: 202302523

domains (e.g. macropsia, micropsia, teleopsia, macrosomatognosia, microsomatognosia and deceleration/acceleration of psycho-
logical time) [ 10,87,88] and have been observed in various clinical conditions, including migraine [ 88–90], epilepsy [ 91], infection
[92–100] and concussion [ 101]. AIWS has also been found among people who use certain medication, such as 5-HT2 antagonist,
and during intoxication with some substances, such as cannabis [ 10].
A lesion-mapping study identified local maxima across the lesions in the right occipital lobe, primarily driven by those with
AIWS symptoms in the visual domain [ 102]. Those patients who had AIWS symptoms only in the somaesthetic domain exhibited
lesions in the limbic system, including the insula, thalamus, CC, hippocampus and parahippocampus. This lesion study did notinclude participants perceiving time distortion, but the insula has been argued to be involved in time perception [ 103].
An imaging study that compared migraine patients with AIWS, migraine patients with typical aura, and healthy individuals
showed that all migraine patients (with and without AIWS) had a lower functional connectivity in the lateral and the medial visualnetworks and higher functional connectivity in the SN and DMN compared with the healthy individuals [ 104].
3. Misophonia
Misophonia describes the phenomenon of experiencing negative emotions and aversive responses triggered by specific auditory and
visual stimuli. Given the lack of well defined criteria for misophonia, estimates of its prevalence vary widely, ranging from 5.9 to 49.1%
[16,105–109]. Although misophonia is not included in the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), researchers have
proposed diagnostic criteria of misophonia to address this issue [ 110–112]. Misophonia typically involves excessive and dispropor-
tional negative emotions, often leading affected individuals to avoid the triggering stimuli. Furthermore, individuals with
misophonia exhibit physiological responses when exposed to such triggers, including increased skin conductance, elevated heartrate and an increased low-frequency component of heart rate variability [ 113–117]. These physiological responses indicate heightened
sympathetic tones.
fMRI studies have established a connection between misophonia and increased brain activation in the insula, auditory cortex,
temporal cortex, CC, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and PMA. Furthermore, misophonia is linked to increased functional con-
nectivity between the insula and the mPFC, the key hubs in the SN and the DMN [ 114,115,117], indicating the link between the SN
and the DMN. On the other hand, the association between misophonia and increased brain activations in the orofacial motor arearemains debated [ 118,119].
Misophonia has been found to be comorbid with various psychiatric conditions, including obsessive –compulsive personality
disorder, mood disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, tinnitus, hyperacusis, post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD), eating disorders, migraine with visual aura, anxiety sensitivity, and hypersensitivity [ 15,109,120–123].
4. Discussion
This review encompasses the identification of the common and distinctive neural circuits associated with ASMR and related sen-
sory phenomena, including SPS, synaesthesia, AIWS and misophonia, to shed light on their underlying neural mechanisms.Among these phenomena, ASMR and SPS share activation in the reward pathway. Activation in the NAc are observed in
ASMR, while activations in the VTA are observed in SPS. The involvement of these reward-related regions in ASMR is consistent
with experiences of music-induced pleasure and frisson, characterized by the sensation of goose-bumps or shivers down the spine[33,34]. ASMR and mirror-touch synaesthesia share activation in the somatosensory cortex. While the role of the somatosensory
cortex in mirror-touch synaesthesia is suggested to be linked to empathy, the role of the somatosensory cortex in ASMR may be
linked to sound localization and head orientation [ 124,125].
The insula, a pivotal brain region, emerges as a shared activation site in ASMR, SPS, AIWS (in the somaesthetic domain) and
misophonia. The insula has connections with the cingulate, frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital cortices and subcortical struc-
tures, such as the amygdala and NAc [ 126–129]. The insula plays an important role in novel stimuli detection and is part of the SN,
alongside the dACC and amygdala. In addition to salience detection, the insula is involved in visceral sensations, autonomic
control, affective processes, sensorimotor processes, auditory processing, taste, olfaction and pain. The insula is proposed to be
the centre of awareness and the interoceptive template for a ‘feeling ’[42–44]. The insula and ACC are closely connected and
usually activate together, and they play an important role in social pain and empathy [ 130,131]. In summary, activation in the
insula observed in ASMR, SPS, AIWS and misophonia is associated with peculiar perception and emotional responses observed
in these phenomena.
Diverging from the previously mentioned shared brain activations, rs-fMRI studies uncover unique facets of these phenomena.
ASMR responders exhibit weaker connectivity in the SN despite strong activations in the key hubs of the SN, the insula and
the dACC. This finding suggests a diminished capacity for attention switch between internal and external stimuli. Furthermore,non-synchronization of the SN with strongly activated insula and dACC may result in altered perception. By contrast, increased
connectivity in the SN is observed in SPS and AIWS, potentially linked to their sensory sensitivity or distortion.
This review also explores the comorbidities associated with these phenomena. ASMR exhibits links to temporary reduction of
anxiety and depression symptoms but not to autism. Meanwhile, SPS is associated with autism, anxiety and depression;
synaesthesia with autism; AIWS with migraine; and misophonia with autism, anxiety, depression and migraine. In other
words, ASMR is on the opposite of the phenomena SPS, synaesthesia and misophonia.
This review acknowledges certain limitations. Heterogeneity amongst the participants in ASMR, SPS, synaesthesia, AIWS
and misophonia studies, stemming from symptom-based definitions and questionnaire assessments poses a significant
limitation. The modest amount of literature on these phenomena (except synaesthesia) also exacerbates this limitation.royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 379: 202302524

Furthermore, the diversity of the stimuli employed in physiological and imaging studies, the relatively small sample sizes and
variations in experimental paradigms contribute to the need for caution in drawing definitive conclusions. Accordingly, this article
serves as a basis for further investigations aimed at unravelling the intricate correlations between ASMR-induced sensations and
neural networks. Future studies should address standardized stimuli and psychophysical approaches to objectively identify thetarget group.
5. Conclusion
The culmination of previous studies demonstrates that ASMR is distinct from related phenomena with altered sensory processing,including SPS, synaesthesia, AIWS and misophonia. Nonetheless, ASMR, SPS and misophonia all involve activation of the insulaand CC related to social cognition and emotion regulation. ASMR differentiates itself from SPS through its reduced connectivity
within the SN. Reduced connectivity in the SN during ASMR experiences indicates a particular way to direct attention that links to
the feeling of relaxation and the flow state.
