## Abstract 9

- We conducted nine experiments to determine why a sound 's pleasantness can be altered by movies, abstract paintings, and words. In Expt. 1, unpleasant sounds, 10 such as the sound of a person sniffing, were paired either with their original video track or with video tracks depicting neutral events that could plausibly have 11 produced the sound, such as pulling tissues out of a tissue box. While the unpleasant sounds were mildly unpleasant to an unscreened population, these sounds 12 were expected to be more unpleasant for people who have misophonia, a condition in which certain everyday sounds are unbearable. Consistent with past literature, 13 neutral video tracks increased the sounds  pleasantness for the non-misophonic and misophonic populations, by 0.98 and 1.59 points, respectively (on an 11-point ' 14 scale). Movies rated as having better audio-visual matches produced greater changes in pleasantness, consistent with the hypothesis that source reassignment caused 15 the changes. Expt. 2 found a consistent result when the video tracks were replaced with written event descriptions, although the effect size was reduced. Expt. 3 16 inverted Expt. 1 and found that unpleasant video tracks decreased the pleasantness of neutral sounds by 2.12 points, but better-matching movies did not produce 17 greater changes in pleasantness. In Expts. 4-6, we sought an alternative to the source reassignment explanation by obtaining ratings of audio-visual synchrony, 18 cross-modal agreement in  symbolism, source plausibility,  and sound identifiability.  No  complete  explanation  was  found  for  the  effect  of  unpleasant  videos. 19 Furthermore, pleasant abstract paintings increased the pleasantness of unpleasant sounds by 0.37 points, correlating with cross-modal agreement but not with audio20 visual match. Taken together, different types and patterns of match ratings can help discern the causal mechanisms by which visual stimuli affect sound pleasantness 21 (e.g., source reassignment, cross-modal agreement). 22

## Introduction 24

- 25 26
- Despite their ubiquity, everyday sounds can elicit a wide range of emotional and physiological responses. Some sounds, such as a babbling brook, will
- typically evoke feelings of calmness, while other sounds, such as crying, will typically evoke feelings of sadness or discomfort. Although there is general agreement
- about which environmental sounds are pleasant or unpleasant to most people, there are also profound individual differences that depend upon prior experiences 27
- 2
- and context. In fact, some everyday sounds that are considered relatively neutral to most people can be unbearable to others. Misophonia [1,2] is a disorder 28
- characterized by strong emotional reactions, such as feelings of irritation, rage, and/or disgust, in response to certain everyday sounds, such as chewing, sniffing, 29
- or pen clicking. Although common misophonic triggers are produced by oral and nasal regions of the human body, repetitive sounds are also a class of triggers [3]. 30
- Despite these common trends, every individual with misophonia has their own unique set of triggers. Reactions can also include physiological responses (e.g., 31
- increase in heart rate and perspiration). In severe cases, individuals avoid places where unbearable sounds are likely to be encountered, significantly affecting their 32
- overall quality of life [4]. Additionally, a similar emotional reaction can sometimes be triggered by visual images depicting (or labeling) events that would normally 33
- produce the trigger sounds [4,5]. Unfortunately, sounds and images that trigger misophonic reactions (hereafter, triggers) are difficult to avoid as they are often 34 encountered in everyday life. 35
- The emotional reaction evoked by a sound depends on many factors, such as the presumed source of the sound (e.g., a specific person), the presumed 36
- action producing the sound (e.g., eating), what other sounds are present, and whether the action is socially appropriate (e.g., eating in the library). Although 37
- perceptual properties of sounds can influence their pleasantness, they alone are insufficient to determine its emotional impact. For example, a single sound can be 38
- heard as either unpleasant or neutral depending on whether its source is correctly identified [6]. For misophonia in particular, reactions to triggers can be reduced 39
- by acoustic manipulations that reduce their identifiability, such as adding noise or distortion [7,8]. This motivates the question of whether intentionally changing 40
- the identification of a trigger's source could reduce its negative impact. 41
- There is evidence that the unpleasantness of a trigger can be reduced by the suggestion of an alternative neutral source for the sound. This suggestion has 42
- been accomplished in a number of ways: (1) specifying a non-human source of an eating action [9], (2) accompanying a sound with an image or video that implies 43

44

a different source [10

-

12], and (3) modifying the interpretation of the source of the sound via text descriptions [11]. However, prior studies have not clarified how

- to generalize this approach for new sounds by outlining the requirements for an effective alternative neutral source. For example, must the unpleasant sounds be 45
- inherently ambiguous? Does the alternative source need to be believable, or even meaningful? We set out to explore the factors that make for effective alternative 46
- neutral sources by testing alternative hypotheses about the mechanisms for source reassignment. 47
- 48
- When a sound is accompanied by a video depicting its source event, this introduces dynamic temporal factors that can introduce audio-visual incongruence
- 3 [13]. Therefore, videos designed to produce source reassignment may be more effective if they temporally align with the sound. It is also possible, although 49
- speculative, that source reassignment is aided when the visual source matches the intuitive physics of sound production (e.g., a forceful motion should accompany 50 a loud sound [14].) Furthermore, perceptual input that is pleasant but unrelated to the sound source may still make unpleasant sounds more tolerable, such as 51 pleasant music played during meals [15]. Therefore, it is necessary to account for both the related and unrelated accompanying input that affects the context of 52 triggers. 53
- Samermit, Saal, and Davidenko [16] paired brief unpleasant  sounds  with  videos depicting positive alternative sources (PAVS). They compared the 54 pleasantness of the sound alone to a sound accompanied by a PAVS. They found that this sound-video pairing reduced the unpleasantness of the sounds for a 55 general population. They postulated that the PAVS convinced observers that the sounds were produced by the pleasant source and therefore the sounds were 56 perceived as more neutral. However, there are a few threats to the validity of this claim. First, the experimental design did not include a control condition of rating 57 the sounds twice in a row without watching the PAVS, so it is not clear if the unpleasant sounds could have been rated more positively on their second appearance 58 due to the ' mere exposure ' effect, in which neutral stimuli become more pleasing with repetition [17]. Second, it is possible that the presence of a video distracted 59
- attention from sounds, thereby making them less unpleasant [18]. Third, it is possible that the videos were generally pleasing to view and this may have contaminated 60
- the participants' ratings of the sounds [19,20]. 61
- Follow-on studies addressed some of these threats to the hypothesis that PAVS cause the source of the sound to be reassigned [11,12]. These studies 62 compared the pleasantness rating of unpleasant sounds when paired either with PAVS or with their original video source. They introduced a new measure that 63 asked how well the video and audio components of the movies appeared to match. Presumably, high match ratings indicate that the audio and video events are 64
- plausible and/or synchronous. The pleasantness of sounds paired with PAVS was rated higher when the match was rated higher. This relationship was interpreted 65

66

as evidence that the better- matching movies (video + audio) were changing the source assignment of the sounds, thereby increasing the sounds' pleasantn

s (which

67

we name the source reassignment hypothesis

). Alternatively, it is possible that the better-matching movies were more pleasant to watch because congruent stimuli

- are typically more pleasant (cf. [21]), leading to an increase in the sound pleasantness ratings. Furthermore, the sounds that are relatively more pleasant could be 68
- more amenable to matching with the pleasant video components, which could explain why the largest benefit was seen for the most pleasant sounds. Therefore, a 69
- positive relationship between PAVS sound pleasantness and match quality does not prove that better-matching PAVS caused a greater change in the interpretations 70

- of the sounds' sources. Thus, it is necessary to provide further evidence to estimate how much of the effect of accompanying stimuli (whether videos, words, or 71 images) is due to an alteration in the perceived source of the sound. 72
- Our goal is to understand the beneficial causal mechanisms of viewing alternative sources while listening to unpleasant sounds. Isolating these mechanisms 73 could  assist  with  developing  a  broader  set  of  stimuli  that  could  potentially  be  applied  to  cognitive  reframing  of  unbearable  sounds  (e.g.,  in  the  context  of 74 psychotherapy, real-time interventions, or mobile applications [22]). As a first step in accomplishing our goal, we replicated and extended prior studies [16,23] by 75 creating a new set of alternative visual sources for an expanded set of triggers. We compared the pleasantness rating of triggers when paired either with an alternative 76 neutral source or with their original video source. To test predictions of the source reassignment hypothesis , we also asked how well the video and audio components 77 of the movies appeared to match, and clarified whether the match was about plausibility, synchrony, or cross-modal sound symbolism. We compared misophonic 78 participants to a non-misophonic control group. We then asked whether the match rating given by both groups correlated with the pleasantness of sounds and/or 79 videos. To address whether movies with better-matching neutral sources caused a greater change in the interpretations of the sounds' sources , we asked whether 80 match predicted the change in sound pleasantness ratings between the two video conditions. 81
- Our second step  was  to  ask  whether source  reassignment could  be  accomplished  semantically  without  the  use  of  images.  We  used  simple  phrases 82 describing neutral or unpleasant sources for the unpleasant sounds to influence their pleasantness ratings. We compared the size of this semantic effect on source 83 reassignment to the effect from our first study that used accompanying visual input. We quantitatively evaluate how much of the beneficial effect of neutral visual 84 sources could be accomplished by text descriptions of those same sources. Our study was conducted on both a misophonic and non-misophonic group to investigate 85 the possibility that concurrent text descriptions could be a cost-effective alternative for source reassignment when movies are not available. 86
- We created a third way to test the source reassignment hypothesis by pairing neutral sounds with unpleasant visual sources. The visual sources, which 87 were videos depicting sources of misophonic triggers, were predicted to cause the sounds to be rated as more unpleasant. These stimuli were useful for disentangling 88 the alternative explanations for the association between pleasantness and match. If a better matching movie makes the visual source more convincing, then a movie 89 with a better match should have a larger negative effect on sound pleasantness. In contrast, if better-matching movies are more pleasant to watch, then a better 90 audio-video match should increase the sound pleasantness ratings. We also investigated the meaning of a good match rating by evaluating the distinctions between 91

|   92 | matches based on event plausibility, temporal synchrony, and/or cross-modal agreement in sound symbolism. Because this and subsequent questions addressed             |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   93 | general cognitive mechanism, we tested an unscreened population (i.e., participants were neither included nor excluded based on misophonic status).                   |
|   94 | A fourth way to test the source reassignment hypothesis is to measure the effect of visual pleasantness which is not meaningfully related to the sounds.              |
|   95 | Because unrelated videos would have mismatched timing in audio and video, static images are the best choice for an unrelated stimulus. We asked whether simply        |
|   96 | looking at a pleasant image while listening to the misophonic triggers will cause the ratings of the sounds to be more positive than when the sound is heard alone.   |
|   97 | If so, that effect requires an explanation other than source reassignment. In two parallel experiments, we established howto discriminate between visual pleasantness |
|   98 | and source reassignment via patterns of match ratings. Furthermore, we quantitatively compared the effect sizes of the pleasant images and source-reassigning         |
|   99 | movies.                                                                                                                                                               |

|  108 | To generate a new set of movies visually showing alternative neutral sound sources for misophonic trigger sounds, we first conducted an extensive search              |
|  109 | of the misophonia literature to compile a list of common triggers. For a sound to be considered a trigger, the sound must be supported by empirical evidence or be    |

self-reported by patients in a published hearing experiment or questionnaire. Based on our search criterion, we found 56 unique classes of misophonic triggers (see 110 Table S1). The classes of trigger sounds that appeared most frequently in the literature were: general chewing sounds, human vocalizations, and repetitive sounds. 111 Next, we created a list of alternative neutral sound sources for the unpleasant sounds. In our brainstorming sessions, we varied both the physical interaction 112 and the material properties of the objects that produced the sounds. We created various stimuli to test out ideas, some of which were informed by misidentifications 113 of similar sounds in previous studies in our lab. For all neutral alternatives, we used a source object and action that differed from the unpleasant sound. After in114 house pilot testing of plausibility of the alternative sources, we selected the following 20 sounds from the top classes of trigger sounds: person blowing their nose, 115 person eating chips, person chewing gum, person scratching scalp, person swishing water in their mouth, person crinkling a plastic bottle, person cracking their 116 knuckles, person gulping water, person sucking in air through their teeth, person coughing, person wheezing, person typing on a keyboard, person sneezing, person 117 brushing their teeth, person smacking their lips, person breathing loudly through the nose , person sniffing 1, and person sniffing 2 . In addition, we included two 118 sounds that are typically considered unpleasant for much of the population: person scratching a blackboard, and person scraping a fork and knife together . To 119 encompass the variety of these 20 sounds, we refer to them as unpleasant sounds rather than trigger sounds. 120

## Audio and video recordings 121

In the lab, sounds were recorded with a Zoom H4N Pro microphone at a 24-bit/96kHz sampling rate in a double-walled sound attenuating chamber treated 122 with sound-absorbing foam on the walls and ceiling. In the same chamber, the visual source of the event was recorded using a Zoom Q8 video recorder attached 123 to a tripod (unless otherwise noted below). Using movie editing software (Lightworks [24]), each digital movie was separated into two tracks: (1) a silent video 124 track depicting an Unpleasant ( Uv ) or a Neutral ( Nv ) visual source, and (2) an audio track containing an Unpleasant ( Us ) or Neutral ( Ns ) sound. 125 After making original recordings of unpleasant sound events, we created movies of their alternative neutral counterparts. The actor making a neutral sound 126 event was simultaneously watching the original movie of the unpleasant sound it was intended to emulate (a technique used by Foley artists [25]). This technique 127 allowed the actor to follow the temporal pattern of the original unpleasant sound to ensure temporal alignment of the sound and visual source. The headphones 128 and/or video screens were not visible in the framing of these movies. 129

- Several of our videos were not recorded in the lab. Some needed to be recorded outdoors. When the soundtrack was poor quality or missing, we replaced 130 it  with an in-lab Foley recording or a recording from freesound.org [26] (e.g., ducks splashing , deer eating leaves , campfire burning , lawn sprinkler spraying 131 water). The movie of birds chirping was downloaded from YouTube.com with no copyright infringement. 132
- All audio track files were wav-format and equalized to have an equal root-mean-squared level using AudioToolbox functions in Matlab [27,28]. The 133 sounds were between 5 and 20 seconds in duration (see File S2). Likewise, all the visual sources were brightness-equalized using FFmpeg [29], and had the same 134 duration as the sounds with which they were paired. 135

## Combining the audio and video tracks into a movie 136

The visual sources and sounds were recombined using Lightworks movie editing software [24]. In our naming convention, the first capital letter indicates 137 the valence of the sound (with a subscript s), and the second capital letter indicates the valence of the video (with a subscript v). When we recombined the original 138 unpleasant audio and video tracks, we produced unpleasant movies ( UsUv) . Hereafter, 'video track' refers to the visual event depicted in a movie, whereas 'movie' 139 refers to a combined auditory and visual stimulus denoted by two letters. Next, the unpleasant sounds were paired with the video track depicting a similarly timed 140 neutral visual source (i.e., UsNv ).  In  this  manner, we created 20 UsUv and 20 UsNv movies. We also used two UsUv and two UsNv movies from Samermit and 141 colleagues [22]: person sipping through a straw , and person tapping fingers on table . We note that our term UsNv corresponds to the PAVS term used by Samermit 142 et al. [16,23]; however, it was necessary to create different terminology to encompass our greater variety of stimulus conditions, which included video tracks, audio 143 tracks, images, and text descriptions (see Table 1 for terms). Matching capital letters such as UU imply an original movie whereas mismatching letters such as UN 144 imply that a sound was paired with a stimulus of a different valence. Next, for use in Experiment 3A, 22 complementary movies were made from films of neutral 145 events that produced Nv. We produced neutral movies ( NsNv) and movies in which the neutral sound was paired with the corresponding unpleasant visual source of 146 a trigger sound (i.e., NsUv ). Because the two UsNv movies from Samermit et al. [16,23] (a stream flowing and person bouncing a ball on table ) did not contain the 147 original neutral sounds, we made Foley recordings for those video tracks to create two corresponding NsNv movies. This process resulted in a total of 44 movies 148 available in a public repository ( https://doi.org/10.1184/R1/c.7112221). 149

As part of stimulus development, we measured the baseline pleasantness ratings for individual silent video tracks and audio tracks; see Supplementary 150 File S1 for method details and Supplementary File S2 ('Baseline video pleasantness' and 'Experiment 4') for pleasantness rati ngs. 151 Table 1. List of stimulus terminology for video tracks, audio tracks, and movies. This only lists studies that used different stimuli in their first and second 152 halves. Unpleasant (U), Neutral (N), and Pleasant (P) stimuli were either videos (v), descriptions (D), paintings (p), or sounds (s). 153

## Participant populations 155

|   156 | Participant recruitment began on 01/07/2022 and ended on 23/04/2024. We recruited participants online through                     |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   157 | Carnegie Mellon University system and through Prolific [30]. At the time of recruitment, all participants completed one or        |
|   158 | more of the following questionnaires that assessed misophonia severity: MisoQuest [31], Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ) [32],       |
|   159 | Duke-Vanderbilt Misophonia Screening Questionnaire (DVMSQ) [33] and the S-Five [34]. Wefollowed the scoring guidelines            |
|   160 | for each questionnaire to determine misophonic severity for each individual. For Experiments 1 and 2, using the tabulated         |
|   161 | scores for each individual, we categorized listeners into one of two groups: a misophonic or non-misophonic group. The            |
|   162 | misophonic group included all participants who received a subclinical or clinical misophonia score on any of the questionnaires.  |
|   163 | This umbrella criterion for misophonia [35] includes people who experience severe 'misophonic reactions ' without requiring       |
|   164 | that they also have a clinically relevant functional impairment in their daily lives. Note, additional recruitment for misophonic |
|   165 | participants was conducted for individuals in the same age range as our non-misophonic population through Prolific, flyers        |
|   166 | posted in the Pittsburgh region, soQuiet.org [36], and social media (e.g., Facebook, Reddit). The non-misophonic control group    |
|   167 | included participants who received a nonclinical score on all questionnaires. For the remaining experiments (i.e., Experiments    |
|   168 | 3, 4, 5), the participants were recruited irrespective of their misophonic severity. We refer to these participants as our        |
|   169 | unscreened group, reflecting a subset of the population in which some individuals may have high misophonic severity. All          |
|   170 | unscreened participants were included in one group for data analyses. In contrast, for data analyses in Experiments 1 and 2, we   |
|   171 | compared misophonic and non-misophonic groups. Thus, our non-misophonic control group is not equivalent to our unscreened         |
|   172 | group because the unscreened group may contain some misophonic participants. Across all unscreened groups (i.e.,                  |
|   173 | Experiments 3A, 4 and 5A-B; N = 154), the percentage of individuals who received a clinical or subclinical misophonia score       |
|   174 | was 11.69%, or 9.09%, respectively. Note that participant recruitment for all unscreened groups (Expts. 3-5) described the        |
|   175 | study as being about 'judging properties of sounds and/or videos' and did not mention misophonia or                               |

## Common procedures 176

Normal hearing and corrected-to-normal vision were required. First, in all studies, participants gave written consent 177 through an online form approved by Carnegie Mellon's Institutional Review Board (IRB #2015_00000409). Prior to completing 178 the  experimental  trials  online  using  Qualtrics  [37],  each  participant  answered  questions  about  their  age,  gender,  and 179 vision/hearing  status.  In  some  cases,  optional  questions  about  ethnicity  were  recorded  (see  Table  S2).  Subsequently, 180 participants completed a volume calibration to ensure that all sounds and movies were played at a comfortably audible level. 181

Next, participants completed a binaural Huggins' pitch test [38] to verify that they were wearing a pair of quality headphones. 182 If  participants  passed  the  headphone  screening,  they  completed  questionnaires  that  assessed  misophonia  severity.  Next, 183 participants completed one practice trial (a replica of a real trial in the upcoming condition) to orient them to the question 184 format. Within the experimental trials, a catch-trial was implemented to ensure that participants were fully attentive throughout 185 the duration of the study. This catch trial appeared superficially like the other trials, but the instructions were different. We 186 excluded all responses from participants who failed to correctly answer the catch-trial. Additionally, we examined data from 187 participants  to  see  if  they  provided  only  one  or  two  values  for  all  ratings,  but  no  problematic  cases  were  found  after  the 188 headphone screening and catch-trial criteria were applied. Numbers of excluded participants are reported within the methods 189 section of each individual study. Experimental trials took approximately 30 minutes per study. Participants were compensated 190 for their time with money or credit to fulfill a course requirement at CMU. In all studies involving ratings of sounds, participants 191 were asked 'ow pleasant is the sound?' H before selecting a response from an 11-point scale, wherein -5 indicated the sound 192 was very unpleasant, +5 indicated the sound was very pleasant, and 0 indicated the sound was neutral [8]. 193

194

## Experiment 1: Altering the pleasantness of an unpleasant sound 195 with neutral or unpleasant visual sources 196

We predicted that our unpleasant sounds would be more pleasant when paired with an alternative neutral visual source 197 ( UsNv ) than when paired with a visual source that depicted the true cause of the sound ( UsUv ). To test the effectiveness of the 198 movies we created on a misophonic population, we implemented a study design in which every trial contains a different movie, 199 with no repetition of sounds in the first half of the experiment. Within the first half of the experiment, half the trials are UsNv 200 and the other half are UsUv . This design allows us to measure the pleasantness of a sound upon its first exposure when it is 201 accompanied by a visual source. The complementary visual sources are shown in the second half, which is a second exposure 202 to each sound. By always accompanying the sound with a visual source, we can ensure the intended identification of the sound's 203 source in each condition, minimizing the effects of any sound ambiguity. We compare a misophonic and non-misophonic 204 group.  We  examine  the  relationship  between  audiovisual  match  and  movie  effectiveness  to  test  the source  reassignment 205 hypothesis . 206

207

## Method 208

## Participants 209

Eighty-two participants (Mage = 24.5 years; range = 18 to 36 years; 42 females, 38 males, two non-binary) were tested 210 (after excluding 23 and 18 participants for failing catch trials and headphone screening, respectively). In total, 20 participants 211 (Mage = 24.75 years; range = 18 to 36 years; 8 females, 10 males, two non-binary) met our criterion for misophonia (see General 212 Methods). 213

## Stimuli 214

The 22 unpleasant sounds, Us , combined with a video of an alternative neutral visual source, Nv to produce a movie, 215 UsNv . This process created 22 movies (see General Methods). Additionally, the unpleasant sounds were combined with their 216 original visual sources, UsUv . Our total stimulus set was 44 movies, divided equally amongst the two conditions (see Procedure 217 below, and Table 1). 218

## Procedure 219

Each of the 44 trials contained a unique movie. Participants saw every movie and were randomly assigned to watch 220 them in one of two presentation orders (see Table 1). Within each order, there were two mutually exclusive presentation halves. 221 In the first half of order A, all 22 sounds were used in 22 movies: 11 sounds were in UsUv pairs, and the remaining 11 sounds 222 were in UsNv pairs. In the second half of order A, the complementary 11 UsNv pairs and 11 UsUv pairs were presented (see Table 223 1). In order B, the second half of order A was presented first. For example, in the first half of order A, the sound of a person 224 smacking their lips was paired with an unpleasant visual source ( UsUv ), while in the second half of order A, it was paired with 225 a neutral visual source ( UsNv ). In the first half of order B, the sound of a person smacking their lips was paired with a neutral 226 visual source ( UsNv ), while in the second half of order B, the same sound was paired with an unpleasant visual source ( UsUv ). 227 By this design, in the first half of the study, every unpleasant sound was heard only once, and each sound was only paired with 228 one visual source. 229 After observing a movie, participants rated the pleasantness of the sound within the movie. Specifically, participants 230 were asked 'ow pleasant is the sound?' H before selecting a response from an 11-point scale, wherein -5 indicated the sound 231 was very unpleasant, +5 indicated the sound was very pleasant, and 0 indicated the sound was neutral [6]. Next, as in Samermit 232 and colleagues [23], participants were asked to rate ' How well does the sound match the visual event? ' with a 5-point scale, 233

for which 1 indicated 'not a good match', and 5 indicated an 'extremely good match.' eaning of 'match,' we To clarify the m 234 added that participants should rate ' How likely it is that the visual sources caused the sounds to occu r.' In our discussion, we 235 will refer to this as the 'plausibility' definition of match. The presentation order of the movies within their respective sections 236 was random. 237

## Results 239

|   240 | Experiment 1 tested the prediction that the unpleasant sounds would be rated as more pleasant when paired with an                          |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   241 | alternative neutral visual source ( U s N v ) than when paired with a visual source that depicted the true cause of the sound ( U s U v ). |
|   242 | To assess differences in sound pleasantness ratings, we conducted a mixed-design ANOVA with repeated measures of visual                    |
|   243 | source pairing (i.e., U s N v or U s U v ) and presentation half (first or second), and between-subjects factors of order (A or B),        |
|   244 | misophonic status (misophonic or non-misophonic), and gender. Age was not included as a factor because the misophonic and                  |
|   245 | non-misophonic groups were similar in age. As expected, sound pleasantness ratings depended upon pairing ( F (1, 73) = 80.123,             |
|   246 | p < 0.001, η p 2 = 0.523, power = 1.0). On average, the sound pleasantness ratings were reliably lower for misophonics than non-           |
|   247 | misophonics ( F (1, 73) = 9.615, p = 0.003, η p 2 = 0.116, power = 0.864). There was an interaction between these two factors,             |
|   248 | indicating that the difference in sound pleasantness ratings between U s N v and U s U v pairs was reliably larger for misophonics         |
|   249 | compared to non-misophonics ( F (1, 73) = 5.709, p = 0.019, η p 2 = 0.073, power = 0.655). Furthermore, we did observe a main              |
|   250 | effect of gender with females giving lower ratings ( F (2, 73) = 5.398, p = 0.007, η p 2 = 0.129, power = 0.830), and an interaction       |
|   251 | between gender and misophonic status ( F (1, 73) = 4.992, p = 0.029, η p 2 = 0.064, power = 0.597) indicating that females with            |
|   252 | misophonia gave sounds the lowest pleasantness ratings. However, gender did not interact with any of the stimulus factors.                 |
|   253 | We did not observe a main effect of presentation half ( F (1, 73) = 0.143, p = 0.707, η p 2 = 0.002, power = 0.066) nor                    |
|   254 | order ( F (1, 73) = 1.470, p = 0.229, η p 2 = 0.020, power = 0.223), nor an interaction between these two factors . We did observe         |
|   255 | a three-way interaction between order, visual pairing, and presentation half ( F (1, 73) = 9.741, p = 0.003, η p 2 = 0.118, power =        |
|   256 | 0.869). This interaction suggests that the size of the difference between U s N v and U s U v pairs was, on average, smaller in the        |
|   257 | second half (as found in Samermit et al. [23]), but this pattern depended on the test order (A or B). Because of the interaction           |
|   258 | between presentation half and test order, our subsequent analyses and figures draw only from data in the first half of the study,          |
|   259 | i.e. the first exposure to each sound.                                                                                                     |

Analyzing only the first presentation effectively transforms our study into a between-subjects design, which means that each data point in subsequent figures represents a movie that was rated by 41 of the 82 participants. The average sound

pleasantness rating for misophonics in the first half of the study, taken across all 22 sounds in the

UsUv pairing, -2.21 (SD =

1.03), was significantly lower than the average sound pleasantness rating in the

UsNv pairing, -0.63 (SD = 1.52) ( (21) = 5.91,

&lt; 0.001). This was also true for non-misophonics (M

however, they did not provide significantly lower pleasantness ratings than non-misophonics for

UsNv pairs. The change in

pleasantness due to visual pairing was marginally greater for misophonics ( (40) = 1.78,

p

= 0.082). The average match quality rating for misophonics of

UsNv pairs was 2.80 (SD = 1.05) on a scale of 1 to 5 with a range from 1.00 to 4.70, while the average

match  quality  of

UsUv pairs  was  4.00  (SD  =  0.53)  with  a  range  from  2.40  to  4.60.  The  average  match  quality  for  non-

misophonics of

UsNv pairs was 2.88 (SD = 0.73) with a range from 1.52 to 3.94, while the average match quality of

UsUv pairs

was 3.63 (SD = 0.48) with a range from 2.26 to 4.13. The misophonics rated

UsUv pairs as having higher match quality than

t

non-misophonics ( (42) = 2.44,

p

=  0.019);  however,  misophonics did  not provide higher  match quality ratings than non- misophonics for

UsNv pairs. The relationship between average sound pleasantness of sound-visual pairs versus their respective

match quality rating is illustrated in Supplemental Figures S1 and S2 for our two populations. More pleasant sound-visual pairs were significantly associated with higher match quality ratings for

Figure 1, displaying data from the first presentation half of Experiment 1, depicts a change function : the subtraction 278 of the average sound pleasantness rating ( UsUv -UsNv ) as a function of the match quality rating of UsNv pairs. The average 279 sound pleasantness ratings for misophonics ( N =  20) are represented by red squares, while the average sound pleasantness 280 rating for non-misophonics (N = 62) are represented by gray circles. For misophonics, an increase in match quality of 1 point 281 for UsNv pairing is associated with a benefit of 0.69 pleasantness rating points for sounds in UsNv pairs over the UsUv pairs (R 2 282 = 0.33, F (1, 20) = 9.67, p = 0.006). At the lowest match quality rating (1), the change in sound pleasantness was approximately 283 0.35 points whereas at the highest match quality rating (5), the change in sound pleasantness is projected to be 3.40 points. We 284 observe that 19 of the 22 data points on the change function are above zero, showing a pleasantness benefit from a neutral 285 relative to an unpleasant visual source. In particular, the sounds with the largest pleasantness change for misophonics were: 286 person brushing their teeth, person swishing water in their mouth, and person eating chips , which changed in pleasantness by 287

- 4.00, 3.80, and 2.90 points, respectively. For non-misophonics, an increase in match quality of 1 point for UsNv pairing is 288 associated with a benefit of 0.85 pleasantness rating points for sounds in UsNv pairs over the UsUv pairs (R  = 0.40, 2 F (1, 20) = 289 13.08, p =  0.002). At the lowest match quality rating (1), the change in sound pleasantness was approximately  -0.61points 290 whereas at the highest match quality rating (5), the change in sound pleasantness is projected to be 2.77 points. Again, we 291 observed that 19 of the 22 data points on the change function are above zero. The sounds with the largest pleasantness changes 292 for non-misophonics were: person brushing their teeth, person swishing water in their mouth , and person crinkling a plastic 293 bottle ,  which changed in pleasantness by 3.12, 2.81, and 2.39 points, respectively. Supplemental Figure S3 depicts a non294 significant, horizontal change function across the match quality rating of UsUv pairs for both populations (Misophonics: R 2 = 295 0.04, F (1, 20) = 0.81, p = 0.38; Non-misophonics: R 2  = 0.06, F (1, 20) = 1.37, p = 0.26), which provides evidence that the video 296 sources which matched their sounds were not driving the source reassignment. In sum, the change in pleasantness due to visual 297 pairs is related to the match quality of the UsNv movies that reassign the source, and this change is larger for the misophonic 298 participants. 299

To assess the quality of our stimuli, we plotted our results from Figure 1 alongside those of Samermit et al. [23] in 300 Supplemental Figure S4. We used their published supplemental data to compute a change function for their stimuli. The data 301 points  from our two studies  fall along  nearly identical regression lines  and the  stimuli cover similar ranges of  match and 302 pleasantness ratings. This close quantitative replication of a prior study  validates the effectiveness of our new movies and 303 illustrates the generalizability of match ratings as a predictor of the effectiveness of differing stimuli. 304

- Finally, we looked for evidence that the pleasantness of the visual sources was influencing the sound ratings. However, 305 the difference in pleasantness of the individual silent visual sources ( Uv -Nv ) did not correlate with the change in average sound 306 pleasantness ( UsNv--UsUv ) in Experiment 1 (  = -0.26, R  = 0.07, r 2 F (1, 20) = 1.47, p = 0.238). Therefore, there is no evidence 307 that participants were rating visual pleasantness instead of rating the sound pleasantness. 308

## Experiment 2: Altering the pleasantness of an unpleasant sound with written descriptions of neutral or unpleasant sources

Experiment 1 implies that movies can change a sound's pleasantness by changing its attributed source. Experiment 2 318 tested the prediction that this same effect could be accomplished without movies. Text descriptions of the visual sources used 319 in Experiment 1 were used in place of the video tracks. If the underlying effect of the movies is source reassignment, and if 320 text descriptions semantically convey the same sources that movies provide, this study should show good strong agreement 321 with Experiment 1. To the extent that the text descriptions are less convincing than movies, this study should show a smaller 322 effect size than the comparable movie study. As in Experiment 1, we tested both misophonic and non-misophonic groups. 323

324

## Method 325

## Participants 326

Eighty-one participants (Mage = 22.04 years; range = 18 to 30 years; 41 females, 34 males, five non-binary and one 327 prefer  not  to  say)  were  tested  (after  excluding  3  and  39  participants  for  failing  catch  trials  and  headphone  screening, 328 respectively). In total, 26 participants (Mage = 22.27 years; range = 18 to 29 years; 16 females, 6 males, four non-binary) met 329 our criteria for misophonia. Note, there were 21 individuals who did not complete the second half of the study due to time 330 constraints. Their data were removed from our omnibus ANOVA but were included in our analysis of the first half of the study. 331

## Stimuli 332

The 22 Us were combined with a text description of the cause of the sound. The text descriptions of the cause of the 333 sound  either  matched  its  original  source  (i.e.,  an  unpleasant  sound  paired  with  its  true,  unpleasant  description, UsUD ),  or 334 matched  the  neutral  visual  source  (i.e.,  an  unpleasant  sound  paired  with  an  alternative  neutral  description, UsND ).  The 335 descriptions contained enough information for the listener to get a sense of the source event but lacked significant detail. For 336 example, the text description for the trigger sound of crunchy chewing was ' Person eating chips ' while the text description of 337 its neutral counterpart was ' Person shaking a bottle containing beads. ' See Table 1 for descriptions of all 44 videos. 338

## Procedure 339

- 340 341
- 342 343

Participants completed the same sequence of experimental procedures as outlined in Experiment 1. Instead of watching short movies, participants were told that they would be listening to a short sound accompanied by a text description of its cause. As in Experiment 1, they were instructed to judge sound pleasantness and match quality. Half the participants were tested in each test order.

344

## Results 345

Experiment 2 tested the prediction that the pleasantness ratings of unpleasant sounds would be higher when paired 346 with a text description that offered a neutral cause of the sound ( UsND ) compared to the original, unpleasant cause of the sound 347 ( UsUD ). We conducted a mixed-design ANOVA with repeated measures of description pairing ( ND or UD ) and presentation 348 half (first or second) and between-subject factors of order (A or B), misophonic status (misophonic or non-misophonic) and 349 gender. Sound pleasantness ratings for unpleasant sounds depended upon the pairing of the neutral or unpleasant description 350 ( F (1, 48) = 52.640, p &lt; 0.001, η p 2 = 0.523, power = 1.0). On average, the sound pleasantness ratings were reliably lower for 351 misophonics compared to non-misophonics ( F (1, 48) = 27.920, p &lt; 0.001, η p 2 = 0.368, power = 1.0). The mean change in sound 352 pleasantness ratings between UsND and UsUD pairs was larger for misophonics compared to non-misophonics; however, this 353 difference was not significant ( F (1, 48) = 2.383, p = 0.129, η p 2 = 0.047, power = 0.328). We did not observe a main effect of 354 gender ( F (1, 48) = 2.579, p = 0.115, η p 2 = 0.051, power = 0.350), nor an interaction between gender and misophonic status 355 ( F (1, 48) = 2.542, p = 0.117, η p 2 = 0.050, power = 0.346), nor any of the stimulus level factors. There was no main effect or 356 interaction for the presentation half or order. 357

As in Experiment 1, the remainder of our analyses exclusively use the responses from the first time each unpleasant 358 sound was heard. The average sound pleasantness rating for misophonics, taken across all 22 sounds in the UsUD pairing, -2.40 359 (SD = 1.14), was significantly lower than the average sound pleasantness rating in the UsND pairing, -1.43 (SD = 1.78) ( (21) t 360 = 3.75, p = 0.001). This was also true for non-misophonics (M UsUD = -1.38, SD = 1.52; M UsND = -0.85, SD = 1.57) ( (21) = 2.73, t 361 p = 0.013). The misophonics rated UsUD pairs as having lower pleasantness than non-misophonics ( (42) = -2.50, t p &lt;0.02); 362 however, they did not provide significantly lower pleasantness ratings than non-misophonics for UsND pairs. The pleasantness 363 change due to description pairing was marginally larger for misophonics (M = 0.97, SD = 1.21) than non-misophonics (M = 364 0.53, SD = 0.91) ( (21) = 1.81, t p = 0.085). For misophonics, the average match quality rating of UsND pairs was 2.36 (SD = 365

0.78) with a range from 1.00 to 3.90, while the average match quality of UsUD pairs was 3.86 (SD = 0.59) with a range from 366 2.33 to 4.72. For non-misophonics, the average match quality of UsND pairs was 2.23 (SD = 0.66) with a range from 1.08 to 367 3.48, while the average match quality of UsUD pairs was 3.62 (SD = 0.67) with a range from 1.85 to 4.72. The match quality 368 ratings did not differ depending on misophonic status for UsND pairs ( (41) = 0.63, t p = 0.53), nor UsUD pairs ( (41) = 1.24, t p = 369 0.22). The relationship between average sound pleasantness of sound-description pairs versus their respective match quality 370 rating is illustrated in Supplemental Figures S5 and S6 for both populations. For both groups, higher sound pleasantness was 371 significantly associated with higher match quality ratings for UsND pairs (Misophonics: R 2 = 0.48, F (1, 20) = 18.38, p &lt; 0.001; 372 Non-misophonics: R 2  = 0.48, F (1, 20) = 18.55, p &lt; 0.001), but there was no such association for UsUD pairs (Misophonics: R 2 373 = 0.04, F (1, 20) = 0.91, p = 0.35; Non-misophonics: R 2  = 0.06, F (1, 20) = 1.26, p = 0.28). 374 To illustrate the changes caused by description pairing, Figure 2 depicts a change function : the subtraction of average 375 sound pleasantness rating ( UsUD -UsND ) pairs versus the match quality rating of UsND pairs. The average change in sound 376 pleasantness ratings for the misophonics (N = 26) and non-misophonics (N = 55) are represented by red squares and gray 377 circles, respectively. For misophonics, an increase in match quality of 1 point for UsND pairing is associated with an increase 378 of 1.12 pleasantness rating points between UsUD and UsND pairs (R  = 0.52, 2 F (1, 20) = 21.47, p &lt; 0.001). At the lowest match 379 quality rating (1), the change function is at -0.55 while at the highest match quality rating (5), the change function is projected 380 to be at 3.91. For misophonics, 18 data points on the misophonic change functions are positive (i.e. a positive change from a 381 neutral description). In particular, the sounds with the largest pleasantness change for misophonics were: person scratching a 382 blackboard, person crinkling a plastic bottle, and person typing on a keyboard , which changed in pleasantness by 3.06, 2.46, 383 and 2.38 points, respectively. For non-misophonics, we observe that an increase in match quality of 1 point for UsNv pairing is 384 associated with an pleasantness increase of 0.71 points between UsUD and UsND pairs (R  = 0.25, 2 F (1, 20) = 7.00, p = 0.015). 385 At the lowest match quality rating (1), the change in sound pleasantness is approximately -0.34 while at a high match quality 386 rating (5), the change in sound pleasantness is projected to be to be 2.49. We observe that 15 of the 22 data points on the non387 misophonic change function are positive. The sounds with the largest pleasantness change for non-misophonics were: person 388 scratching a blackboard, person swishing water in their mouth, and person scratching scalp , which changed in pleasantness 389 by 2.25, 2.03, and 1.93 points, respectively. Supplemental Figure S7 depicts a non-significant, horizontal change function 390 across the match quality rating of UsUD pairs for both populations (Misophonics: R 2 = 0.07, F (1, 20) = 1.47, p = 0.24; Non391 misophonics: R 2  = 0.10, F (1, 20) = 2.19, p = 0.15), confirming that the match of the alternative source in the UsND pairing (in 392 Figure 2) is what causes the change in sound pleasantness. 393

- Figure  2.  Experiment  2:  Unpleasant  sounds  paired  with  neutral  or  unpleasant  event  descriptions. The  relationship 394 between the change in average sound pleasantness ratings across the neutral ( UsND ) and unpleasant ( UsUD ) pairs versus the 395 average  match  quality  ratings  for UsND pairs  in  Experiment  2.  The  changes  are  calculated  by  subtracting  the  average 396 pleasantness  rating  of UsUD from UsND .  The  averages  are  calculated  within  two  mutually  exclusive  participant  groups: 397 Misophonics (red squares), and Non-misophonics (gray circles). The solid line indicates the linear regression fit to the data. 398 Each data point represents the mean change for each of the unpleasant sounds and the error bars reflect the standard error of 399 the mean across participants. 400
- Comparing the effect sizes of the first two studies, the effect of the neutral text descriptions on sound pleasantness in 401 Experiment 2 was significantly smaller than the effect of the neutral visual sources for  non-misophonics in Experiment 1 402 ( dExperiment 2 = 0.75 , average change = 0.58; dExperiment 1 = 0.95 , average change = 0.98;  (110) = -2.39, t p = 0.019), but the effect 403 was only marginally smaller for misophonics ( dExperiment 2 = 0.88 , average change = 1.05; dExperiment 1 = 1.94 , average change = 404 1.59;  (43) = -1.80, t p = 0.079). 405

406

Given that the change function

has a similar slope when the paired stimuli are visual sources (

β

Misophonics

= 0.69, 95%

407

CI = [0.23, 1.15];

β

Non-misophonics

= 0.85, 95% CI = [0.36, 1.33]) and when they are text descriptions (

Misophonics

= 1.12, 95% CI

- = [0.61, 1.62]; β Non-misophonics = 0.71, 95% CI = [0.15, 1.27]), the match ratings appear to have similar meanings in both studies. 408

409

This supports the interpretation that the same process of causal reassignment is happening in both studies (see Figure 3). Note,

410

the change scores for each of the 22 sounds were marginally correlated between Experiments 1 and 2 (

r

= 0.42, R 2

= 0.18,

F

(1,

- 20) = 4.30, p =  0.051) for misophonics, but not for non-misophonics (  = 0.35, R 2 r =  0.12, F (1, 20) = 2.72, p = 0.11). For 411
- misophonics, the source plausibility may be driving much of the variance, because alternative sources that have the biggest 412

413

effect for movies tend to also have the biggest effect for written descriptions. This result also supports the idea that the degree

414

415

416

417

418

of  match  is  what  determines  the  change  in  sound  pleasantness.  Because  the  match  ratings  are  higher  for  the  movies  in

Experiment 1 than for the description-sound pairs in Experiment 2 (by 0.44-points for misophonics and by 0.63-points for non- misophonics), we postulate that the visual sources increased the plausibility of the alternative  source,  which consequently

caused a greater source reassignment. The smaller match quality in Experiment 2 would therefore explain the smaller average change in pleasantness observed in Experiment 2 than in Experiment 1.

427

## Experiment 3A: Altering the pleasantness of a neutral sound with

## 428 neutral or unpleasant visual sources 429

Experiment  3A  was  designed  to  test  whether  the  valence  of  the  visual  sources  is  the  essential  component  that 430 determines  the  direction  of  the  shift  in  pleasantness.  Given  that  an  alternative  neutral  visual  source  can  increase  sound 431 pleasantness (Experiment 1), we predicted that an alternative unpleasant visual source would decrease the pleasantness of a 432 neutral sound. To test this idea, we paired neutral sounds from the original neutral visual sources shown in Experiment 1 with 433 visual sources of the unpleasant events that produced the unpleasant sounds used in Experiment 1 ( NsUv ). We also paired the 434 neutral  sounds  with their original  neutral  visual  sources ( NsNv ).  We  predicted that neutral sounds  would be rated as more 435 pleasant  when  paired  with  their  original  visual  sources  than  when  paired  with  alternative,  unpleasant  visual  sources. 436 Furthermore,  we predicted that  better-matching  unpleasant  movies  would  be  more  plausible  and  therefore  cause  a  greater 437 decrease in pleasantness. However, the opposite prediction is also  possible: if better-matching sound-visual pairs are more 438 pleasant, and if more pleasant sound-visual pairs increase the pleasantness of the sound, then movies with the highest match 439 ratings should have the highest pleasantness ratings, as seen in Experiment 1. 440

441

## Method 442

## Participants 443

Sixty-eight participants (Mage = 22.42 years; range = 18 to 30 years; 35 females, 31 males, two non-binary) were tested 444 (after excluding 44 participants for failing the headphone screening). In this unscreened group that was recruited irrespective 445

- of misophonic status, six individuals (Mage = 21.83 years; range = 19 to 28 years; 4 females, 2 males) met our criteria for 446 misophonia. 447

## Stimuli 448

- The 22 neutral sounds, Ns , combined with a video of an alternative unpleasant visual source, Uv , to produce a movie, 449 NsUv .  This  process  created  22  movies  (see  General  Methods).  Additionally,  the  neutral  sounds  were  combined  with  their 450 original visual sources, NsNv . Our total stimulus set was 44 movies, divided equally amongst the two conditions (see Table 1). 451

## Procedure 452

- This study followed the same procedure and design described in Experiment 1, but participants viewed NsNv pairs and 453 NsUv pairs. There were 36 and 32 participants who completed the two test orders. 454

455

## Results 456

- Experiment 3A tested the prediction that the pleasantness  ratings  of  neutral  sounds  would  be  lower  when  paired  with  an 457 alternative, unpleasant source ( NsUv ) than when paired with a visual source that depicted the original, neutral cause of the sound 458 ( NsNv ). In parallel with Experiments 1 and 2, we conducted analyses only on the first half of the study so that every trial was a 459 first exposure to a sound. In contrast to Experiment 1, given that this was an unscreened group, we averaged pleasantness 460 ratings across the entire group without an analysis of misophonic status. The average sound pleasantness rating across all 22 461 neutral sounds in the NsNv pairing, 0.92 (SD = 1.34) was significantly higher than in the NsUv pairing, -1.20 (SD = 1.25) ( (21) t 462 = -14.60, p &lt; 0.001). The average match quality rating of NsUv pairs was 1.76 (SD = 0.63), range of 1.03 to 3.41, which was 463 significantly lower than the average match quality rating of NsNv pairs, 4.07 (SD = 0.67), range of 1.86 to 4.69 ( (21) = -12.50, t 464 p &lt; 0.001). The relationship between average sound pleasantness of sound-visual pairs versus match rating is illustrated in 465 Supplemental Figures S8 and S9. We observe non-significant relationships for both NsUv (R 2 = 0.03, F (1, 20) = 0.62, p = 0.44), 466 and NsNv pairs (R  = 0.01, 2 F (1, 20) = 0.28, p = 0.60). 467

|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   473 | N s U v pairs is not related to the average match quality rating of N s N v pairs (R 2 = 0.009, F (1, 20) = 0.18, p = 0.67). These        |
|   474 | comparisons show that the N s U v pairing decreases the sound pleasantness ratings relative to the N s N v pairing, but not as a          |
|   475 | function of match, in contrast to the significant slope relating changes in pleasantness as a function of the alternative source's        |
|   476 | match in Experiment. The results in Experiment 3A are inconsistent with the source reassignment hypothesis , suggesting that              |
|   477 | there is another cause for the change.                                                                                                    |
|   478 | We looked for evidence that the pleasantness of the visual sources were influencing the sound ratings. However, the                       |
|   479 | difference in unpleasantness of the individual silent visual sources ( U v - N v ) did not correlate with the change in average sound     |

|   481 | that participants were rating visual pleasantness in instead of rating the sound pleasantness.                                            |

## Experiment 3B: Alternative meaning of auditory-visual match 490

Experiment 3A left open the question of how there could be a change in sound pleasantness without it having any 491 relationship with match quality. We considered the possibility that participants were interpreting the match judgment differently 492 between Experiment 3A and Experiment 1. In Experiment 3A, participants may have been rating the temporal alignment of the 493 sounds  and  visual  sources,  which  can  be  slightly  misaligned  due  to  the  movie  editing  process.  To  empirically  test  this 494 hypothesis,  we replicated Experiment 3A with one difference: the match rating of  source plausibility was followed by an 495 evaluation of temporal match (i.e., audio and video alignment). We intended this juxtaposition of questions to isolate the factors 496 that may have been affecting the match plausibility rating in Experiment 3A. 497

## Method 498

## Participants 499

A new set of seventeen participants were tested to replicate Experiment 3A with a modification in the procedure for 500 match judgements (Mage = 19 years; range = 18 to 20 years; 10 females, seven males) after excluding seven participants who 501 did not pass the headphone screening. Only one individual met our criteria for misophonia in this unscreened group. 502

## Stimuli 503

504

The stimuli were identical to Experiment 3A.

## Procedure 505

Experiment 3B followed the same procedure and design as in Experiment 3A, rating both sound pleasantness and 506 match for 44 videos, but these participants made two match ratings in a row. The first match rating was a source plausibility 507 match (worded identically to Experiment 3A), followed by a second match rating (0 to 4) that was a temporal match ('In this 508 movie, are the audio and video aligned in time?') 509

510

## Results 511

For this set of participants, the average change in pleasantness between NsUv and NsNv was 1.97 points (SD = 1.05). 512 As found in Experiment 3A, the change in pleasantness from NsUv to NsNv was neither significantly related to source plausibility 513 (R 2 = 0.02, F (1, 20) = 0.45, p = 0.51) nor related to temporal match (R 2 = 0.02, F (1, 20) = 0.41, p = 0.53). Next, we asked 514 whether the plausibility and temporal match judgements were treated differently by participants. Because there was a significant 515 correlation between plausibility and temporal match ratings ( r = 0.63, R 2 = 0.39, F (1, 20) = 12.85, p = 0.002), it is possible that 516 a temporally aligned movie makes the source more plausible. Importantly, given that 61% of the variance in ratings is unique 517 for each rating scale (because R 2 =  0.39), these two definitions of matching are not synonymous. Overall, this experiment 518 provides no evidence that the match rating in Experiment 3A was understood to be a temporal alignment rating, and there is no 519 evidence that better temporal alignment caused a greater negative shift in pleasantness in Experiment 3A or 3B. 520

## Experiment 3C: Cross-modal agreement in Experiment 3A 522

Given that Experiments 3A and 3B did not find any match measure that explained the variations in sound pleasantness 523 within conditions, Experiment 3C was designed to test whether the cross-modal agreement of the movies was causing the 524 negative shift in sound valence. Cross-modal agreement between meaningless images and words has been found experimentally 525 to relate to sound symbolism; for example, round visual shapes tend to match better to the word 'aluma' than ' ete' m t ak [39]. 526 One possibility is that movies with better cross-modal agreement between the video and audio pairs have a greater influence 527 on the pleasantness of the sound. To investigate this possibility, a study was conducted in which participants were instructed 528 to categorize the sounds and video tracks into one of two categories, as a means of measuring cross-modal agreement. 529

530

## Method 531

## Participants 532

A total of 32 participants (Mage = 21.88 years; range = 18 to 29 years; 15 females, 13 males, four non-binary) were 533 tested. In this unscreened group that was recruited irrespective of misophonic status, there were six misophonic individuals 534 (Mage = 21.83 years; range = 19 to 28 years; 4 females, 2 males). 535

## Stimuli 536

There were a total of 44 silent visual tracks, and 44 sounds (22 unpleasant and 22 neutral). The two nonsense words 537 used  for  cross-modal  matching , 'maluma' or 'takete,' were  chosen  because  they  have  established  sound  symbolism  that 538 corresponds to round or pointy shapes, respectively [39] . 539

## Procedure 540

The experimental platform was Gorilla.sc [40]. Each sound was heard (unimodally) in random order, followed by 541 each video source (unimodally) in random order. In subsequent data analysis, each stimulus was categorized as being either a 542 'm aluma  or a ' 't akete ' based on which name received that designation more than 50% of the time across participants. Next, 543 every NsUv pairing used in Experiment 3A was categorized as being either in crossmodal 'agreement' if the categories of the 544 movie and the sound were the same (i.e., a 'm aluma  video track with a ' 'm aluma ' sound,  't or a akete ' video track with a 545

'ta kete ' sound), or in crossmodal 'disagreement' (i.e., a 'm aluma  video track was paired with a ' 't akete ' sound, or vice 546 versa). 547

|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   551 | in Experiment 3A, the average cross-modal match quality ratings in Experiment 3A were computed in two separate groups:             |
|   552 | one in which the sound-painting pairing agreed cross-modally, and one in which they disagreed cross-modally.                       |
|   553 | Ten (out of 22) neutral visual sources and eight (out of 22) unpleasant visual sources were categorized by more than               |
|   554 | 50% of participants as 'maluma.' Inter -rater agreement was high for the neutral and unpleasant visual sources, respectively, at   |
|   555 | 0.93 (ICC Alpha, F (21, 611) = 16, p < 0.001) and 0.86 ( F (21, 553) = 8.03, p < 0.001). To test whether the cross-modal           |
|   556 | agreement measured in Experiment 3C underlies the match quality ratings measured in Experiment 3A, every N s U v pairing           |
|   557 | used in Experiment 3A was designated as being either in cross- modal 'agreement' or 'disagreement', respectively, depending        |
|   558 | on ratings of each video source and the sound obtained in Experiment 3C. The average change in pleasantness of sounds that         |
|   559 | were in N s U v pairs with cross-modal agreement (M = -2.14, SD = 0.53) was not reliably higher than the change in pleasantness    |
|   560 | for sounds that were in N s U v pairs with cross-modal disagreement (M = -2.08, SD = 0.93) ( t (20) = -0.22, p = 0.83). Therefore, |
|   561 | cross-modal agreement based on sound symbolism does not account for significant variation in the change produced by                |
|   562 | unpleasant visual sources in Experiment 3A. Furthermore, according to a t-test for independent samples, the mean match quality     |
|   563 | rating was not significantly higher for the group of stimuli that were in cross-modal agreement (M = 1.69, SD = 0.46), than        |
|   564 | cross-modal disagreement (M = 1.88, SD = 0.89) ( t (20) = -0.68, p = 0.50). This indicates that the match quality rating was not   |
|   565 | interpreted as a cross-modal agreement rating by participants.                                                                     |
|   566 | To further test the explanatory power of cross-modal match, we conducted a parallel analysis of cross-modal effects                |
|   567 | for the neutral source movies used in Experiment 1. Because Experiment 1 had provided evidence of source reassignment, we          |
|   568 | predicted that there would be no significant correlations with cross-modal match. We found that cross-modal agreement of           |
|   569 | U s N v pairs in Experiment 1 had no effect: the average change in pleasantness was unaffected by cross-modal agreement versus     |
|   570 | disagreement (M = 1.17, SD = 1.02 versus M = 0.85, SD = 0.85; t (20) = 0.52, p = 0.61) and was unrelated to the match              |
|   571 | (plausibility) rating (M = 2.96, SD = 0.76 versus M=2.19, SD = 0.87; t (20) = 1.62, p = 0.12).                                     |
|   572 |                                                                                                                                    |

## Comparison of Experiments 1, 2 and 3 573

Experiments 1 and 2 showed that our misophonic groups rated sounds in the context of movies as more unpleasant 574 than  did  non-misophonic  groups.  While  both  groups  found  sounds  to  less  unpleasant  when  they  were  paired  with  neutral 575 sources, this effect tended to be greater for the misophonic group (significantly in the full Experiment 1, and marginally for 576 first exposures in Experiments 1 and 2). Although effects of the verbal descriptions were smaller than the videos, Experiments 577 1 and 2 were quantitatively consistent with a common mechanism of source plausibility for words and videos because they had 578 similar change functions . Experiment 3A appeared to result from a different mechanism, given that its change function showed 579 no relationship to source plausibility. Experiments 3B and 3C showed that the magnitude of change per video in Experiment 580 3A did not relate to audio-visual temporal synchrony or cross-modal agreement either, leaving open the question as to what 581 causes the decreased pleasantness of the neutral sounds in the NsUv movies. Taken together, Experiments 1, 2, and 3A-C 582 constitute contrasting evidence that the neutral alternative sources cause by source reassignment because variations in their 583 pleasantness shifts correlated with match ratings based on source plausibility (but not cross-modal agreement) whereas the 584 unpleasant visual sources did not cause source reassignment because variations in their pleasantness shifts did not correlate 585 with match ratings. 586

587

## Experiment 4: The role of sound misidentification in the 588

## effectiveness of neutral visual sources 589

We considered whether participants in Experiments 3A-C rate the pleasantness of the unpleasant visual sources (rather 590 than the sounds); if so, this predicts that there should be a high correlation between Uv video and NsUv sound pleasantness. This 591 question  motivates  an  experiment  to  measure  the  pleasantness  and  identification  of Us and Ns (Experiment  4)  and  the 592 pleasantness of Uv and Nv (see Supplementary File S2). Experiment 4 serves two purposes. First, it asks whether inherent sound 593 ambiguity might permit an alternative visual source to be more plausible and effective for that sound. Sound ambiguity was 594 tested in a sound identification experiment that measured the rate at which each sound was misidentified as its alternative 595 source. Cases of misidentification allow us to test a prediction that is made exclusively by the source-reassignment explanation 596 and not by a visual pleasantness explanation: the ambiguous unpleasant sounds which tend to be misheard as a neutral sound 597

|   598 | should be rated as matching well to an alternative neutral visual source, while the ambiguous neutral sounds should be rated as     |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   599 | matching well to an alternative unpleasant visual source. Second, the study design contains two measurements of sound-alone         |
|   600 | pleasantness, allowing us to test whether the sounds' pleasantness changes upon second listening. Although the 'mere                |
|   601 | exposur e' effect is well -known for increasing stimulus preference, there is some evidence (e.g. Brickman et al. [41]) showing     |
|   602 | that the mere exposure effect applies differentially to positive/neutral stimuli and negative stimuli, with mildly negative stimuli |
|   603 | becoming more negative upon repeated exposure. Experiment 4 measures both the identifiability and the 'mere exposure'               |
|   604 | effect for all the neutral and unpleasant sounds used in our studies.                                                               |

## Method 606

## Participants 607

Thirty-two participants (Mage = 24.40 years; range = 18 to 30 years; 12 females, 20 males) were tested (after excluding 608 13 participants for failing headphone screening). In this unscreened group, 11 participants (Mage = 25.18 years; range = 18 to 609 29 years; five females, six males) met the criteria for misophonia. 610

## Stimuli 611

There were 22 unpleasant sounds, Us and 22 neutral sounds, Ns (See Table 1 and General Methods). Each of the 44 612 sounds were presented in isolation. 613

## Procedure 614

615

During the first block of 44 trials, participants were asked to rate the pleasantness of one sound per trial (i.e., a first

616

617

618

619

620

exposure). The same pleasantness scale as Experiment 1 was used. In the subsequent block of 44 trials, participants rated the pleasantness of each sound again (i.e. a second exposure) before identifying it by selecting one label from a closed set of 10

labels [42]. The labels consisted of a noun and a verb taken from a descriptive phrase (see Table 1). The 10 labels were randomly selected on each trial from the entire set of 44 possible labels, with the restriction that two of the ten labels were always (1) the

correct answer and (2) the corresponding alternative sound. The presentation order of the sounds was random.

621

## Results 622

- Experiment 4 tested the identification of our unpleasant and neutral sounds and tested the effects of repetition on 623 pleasantness. We first apply this data to Experiment 1. Sound identification accuracy of Us was 77.0% (SD = 0.20) with a range 624 from 40.6% for person cracking their knuckles to 100% for person wheezing and person scraping a knife and fork together . 625 Table 2 shows the frequency of misidentifications for each unpleasant sound. In most instances of misidentification, unpleasant 626 sounds were misidentified as their planned neutral counterparts (Planned source, 3 rd column from right). The odds ratio is 3.09 627 for planned sources versus 0.05 for unplanned sources, which was calculated by dividing the number of misidentifications per 628 type (planned or other source) by the number of total participants in the study. These instances should, in principle, raise the 629 average Us pleasantness ratings. This leads to the prediction that the rate at which Us are confused for their planned neutral 630 counterparts  should  correlate  with  higher  average Us pleasantness  ratings.  This  prediction  was  upheld  by  a  significant 631 correlation ( r = 0.20, F (1, 20) = 5.012, p = 0.036, first exposure). In effect, this result means that the true unpleasantness of 632 ambiguous Us sounds are underestimated in our sound-alone condition relative to a situation in which the source is known or 633 strongly implied (i.e. as in Experiments 1 and 2 via visual or text input). Furthermore, we reasoned that a sound which is 634 sometimes spontaneously confused for its planned neutral counterpart should often be considered plausible when it is paired 635 with that visual source. This reasoning predicts the significant correlation we found between rate of confusion of each Us and 636 its average match rating within the UsNv pairing from all participants in Experiment 1 (  = 0.61, r F (1, 20) = 12.30, p = 0.002, 637 first exposure) as well as its change in pleasantness between the UsNv and UsUv conditions ( r = 0.56, F (1, 20) = 9.36, p = 0.006, 638 first exposure). 639

640

Second, we apply this data to Experiment 3A. Sound identification accuracy of the Ns was 82.0% (SD = 0.20) with a 641 range from 44.0% for sound of a person snapping a stick to 100% for sounds of campfire burning, birds chirping ,  person 642 pulling facial tissues out of a box , person tapping a bag that is laying on top of a tambourine , and stream flowing . Table S3 643 shows that the odds ratio is 1.00 for planned sources versus 0.07 for unplanned sources. These confusions of planned neutral 644 sounds with unplanned unpleasant sources should, in principle, lower the average Ns pleasantness ratings. This leads to the 645 prediction that the rate at which the Ns are  confused for their planned unpleasant counterparts should correlate with lower 646 average Ns pleasantness ratings. However, this prediction was not upheld (  = 0.15, r F (1, 20) = 0.472, p = 0.50, first exposure). 647 There was no correlation between rate of confusion of each Ns with its average match rating within the NsUv pairing  from 648 Experiment 3A (  = 0.29, r F (1, 20) = 1.83, p = 0.19, first exposure), nor with its change in pleasantness between the NsUv and 649 NsNv conditions (  = 0.005, r F (1, 20) = 0.0006, p = 0.98, first exposure). 650

662

The identification and pleasantness data permit us to quantitatively estimate how much a sound source reassignment 663 could change the pleasantness of the sound in Experiment 1. Because the average pleasantness of correctly identified unpleasant 664 sounds during first exposure was -1.44 (SD = 1.58), and the average pleasantness of their correctly identified neutral counterpart 665 sounds  was  0.28  (SD  =  1.34),  we  estimated  that  the  largest  possible  change  in  pleasantness  caused  purely  by  source 666 reassignment would be their difference, 1.72 points. This difference provides an upper bound on the size of the effect that could 667 be obtained in Experiment 1, assuming all Us sounds were correctly identified in the UsUv trials and fully reassigned to neutral 668 sound sources when accompanied by neutral movies. This upper bound of the effect is large enough to account for the shifts 669 obtained in Experiment 1 because the average change in sound pleasantness was 1.13 points (subtracting the UsNv of -0.41 670 from the UsUv of -1.54, first exposure across all participants). This rules out the need to appeal to any additional mechanism 671 aside from source reassignment to account for the size of the changes in pleasantness that were observed in Experiment 1. 672

To examine how repeated exposure affects the pleasantness these sounds, we conducted a repeated measures ANOVA 673 to compare sound pleasantness ratings across sound valence ( Us or Ns ) and exposure (first or second). The average pleasantness 674 rating for each sound was calculated by averaging the rating across all participants, irrespective of whether the sound was 675 correctly identified. This calculation was completed separately for each sound valence and exposure. The mean pleasantness 676 of Us (Mfirst = -1.34, SDfirst = 1.51; Msecond = -1.48, SDsecond = 1.58) was significantly lower than the pleasantness of Ns (Mfirst = 677 0.24, SDfirst = 1.32, Msecond = 0.48, SDsecond = 1.41) ( F (1, 42) = 16.69, p &lt; 0.001, η p 2 = 0.284, power = 0.980). We did not observe 678 a main effect of first versus second exposure ( F (1, 42) = 0.787, p = 0.38, η p 2 = 0.018, power = 0.140). More importantly, we 679 did observe a significant interaction between sound valence and exposure ( F (1, 42) = 10.50, p = 0.002, η p 2 = 0.200, power = 680 0.886). Pleasantness ratings for Us were 0.14 points lower during second exposure, whereas the pleasantness ratings for Ns were 681 0.25  points  higher  during  second  exposure.  This  result  agrees  with  our  prediction  that  the  mere  exposure  effect  applies 682 differentially  to  positive/neutral  stimuli  and  negative  stimuli,  with  mildly  negative  stimuli  becoming  more  negative  upon 683 repeated exposure. 684

## Experiment 5A: Altering the pleasantness ratings of sounds with meaningless visual stimuli

Experiment 1 provided evidence that an unpleasant sound is rated as more pleasant when paired with an alternative 688 neutral visual source than when it is presented with an unpleasant visual source. The source reassignment hypothesis is that the 689 visual source changes the perceived cause of the sound, and this explains why the change is greater when there is a better match 690 between the visual source and the sound. However, the alternative visual sources may also have the potential to change the 691 ratings of the sounds by other mechanisms, such as contaminating the sound ratings with their visual pleasantness. Although 692 the results of Experiment 1 did not show an effect of the pleasantness of the silent visual source on the change function, those 693 visual sources had the same source as the sounds and therefore shared meaning. Because the meaning of the sound source is a 694 strong factor in its emotional effect, it is possible that the visual source's semantics ( meaning of the source) overwhelmed the 695 effect of visual pleasantness Therefore, Experiment 5A was devised to directly test the potential alternative mechanism of 696 perceptual visual pleasantness devoid of meaning. In this study, we paired pleasant abstract paintings with our unpleasant 697 sounds because they contained no semantic content. Furthermore, because these were static images, there was no auditory698 visual temporal asynchrony introduced by showing unrelated visual input. 699

## Method 702

## Participants 703

Twenty participants (Mage = 19.76 years; range = 18 to 22 years; 17 females, two males, one non-binary) were tested 704 irrespective of misophonic status (after excluding five participants for failing the headphone screening). In this unscreened 705 group, four participants (Mage = 20 years; range = 18 to 22 years; 3 females, 1 male) met the criteria for misophonia. 706

## Stimuli 707

The 22 Us sounds from Experiment 1 were played simultaneously with pleasant, abstract paintings, UsPp (See General 708 Methods and Table 1). Between participants, the pairing of unpleasant sounds to the abstract paintings was random so that each 709

listener  experienced a custom set of UsPp pairs.  We  used  166  abstract  paintings  from  The  Art  Institute  of  Chicago  online 710 collection [43] and Pexels [44], a free stock photo website. 711

## Procedure 712

It  has  been  shown that the perception of abstract art differs substantially across individuals  [45], i.e., there is  no 713 consensus on whether an abstract piece of art is pleasant or unpleasant. Therefore, this experiment was preceded by a pretest 714 (Part One) to select paintings that would be pleasant for each participant. In Part One, each participant rated the pleasantness 715 of 166 abstract paintings. Each painting was viewed for 12 seconds, the average duration of the unpleasant sounds, before being 716 given a pleasantness rating on the same 11-point scale described in Experiment 1. For each participant, the 22 abstract paintings 717 with the most positive pleasantness ratings were selected. The preselected paintings and sounds were randomly paired  and 718 displayed throughout the duration of the sound using iMovie [46]. Approximately four days later, in Part Two, the participants 719 completed ratings of the sounds with and without accompanying images. They first rated the pleasantness of all the unpleasant 720 sounds in isolation, using the 11-point pleasantness scale; next, they observed the UsPp pairs and rated the sound pleasantness 721 as well as the match quality of UsPp pairs. I nstructions were to rate ' How well the sound matches the painting .' The presentation 722 order of the stimuli within their respective sections was random. In an additional step after the experiment, 11 of the participants 723 again rated the pleasantness of the silent paintings. All other procedural elements (i.e., survey via Qualtrics, volume calibration, 724 headphone screening, and catch trials) were the same as in the common procedures in General Methods. 725

726

## Results 727

Experiment 5A tested the alternative hypothesis that the pleasantness of an unpleasant sound, Us , would increase when 728 it was presented simultaneously with a pleasant but semantically unrelated painting, Pp . The average pleasantness rating for 729 each UsPp across the entire unscreened group was calculated by averaging the sound pleasantness ratings irrespective of the 730 painting with which the sound was paired. The mean pleasantness of the sound alone (M = -1.62, SD = 1.72) was significantly 731 lower than the pleasantness of the sound in the UsPp pairing (M = -1.25, SD = 1.73;  (21) = -4.51, t p &lt; 0.001). Figure 5A shows 732 the average sound pleasantness ratings in the UsPp pairing did increase as a function of the average match quality of UsPp pairs 733 (R 2 = 0.43, F (1, 20) = 15.10, p &lt; 0.001, slope of the function = 2.92). The average match quality rating was 2.00 (SD = 0.39) 734 with a range from 1.40 to 2.65. Next, to illustrate the relationship between pairing and match, Figure  5B depicts a change 735

|   755 | did it correlate significantly with pleasantness ratings when the sound was presented alone (R 2 = 0.002, F (1, 20) = 0.035, p =         |
|   756 | 0.85). In Part One, the pleasantness of the paintings, across all 20 participants, had a mean of 3.46 (SD = 0.19) with a range of        |
|   757 | 3.10 to 3.85, which may have increased the sound pleasantness by as much as 0.40 points.                                                 |

## Experiment 5B: Altering the pleasantness of an unpleasant sound 759 with concurrent presentation of a neutral visual source 760

In Experiment 5B, we predicted that our original set of movies depicting alternative neutral visual sources ( UsNv ) 761 could increase the perceived pleasantness of our unpleasant sounds relative to the sounds alone. Experiment 5B uses the same 762 procedure as Part Two in Experiment 5A to permit a quantitative comparison of effect sizes between the two studies while also 763 serving as a replication of our findings in Experiment 1. The study design of Experiments 1-3 limits our ability to measure the 764 direct effect of the neutral visual source because the sounds are always played with a video. The present study design allows 765 us to test whether the entire relative effect in Experiment 1, obtained by subtracting two conditions containing different video 766 tracks, is due to only one type of visual source (e.g. unpleasant videos). 767

768

## Method 769

## Participants 770

Thirty-four participants (Mage = 19.70 years; range = 18 to 31 years; 23 females, 11 males)  tested irrespective of 771 misophonia status (after excluding 9 participants for failing the headphone screening). In this unscreened group, there were 772 five misophonics (Mage = 19.40 years; range = 18 to 20 years; 4 females, 1 male). 773

## Stimuli 774

There were 22 unpleasant sounds, Us , and 22 UsNv movies (see Table 1). 775

## Procedure 776

The procedure was identical to Part Two of Experiment 5A except that neutral movies were paired with sounds instead 777 of paintings. In the first half of the study, participants rated the sounds alone. In the second half of the study, participants 778 observed UsNv movies and rated both the pleasantness of the sound and the match quality of the movie. The presentation order 779 of the stimuli within their respective sections was random. 780

781

## Results 782

Experiment 5B tested the prediction that pleasantness of a sound in isolation ( Us ) would increase when it was paired 783 with a visual source that offered a neutral causal explanation of the sound ( UsNv ). Averaged across the unscreened group, the 784

- mean pleasantness of the sounds alone (M = -1.27) was significantly lower than the pleasantness of the sound in the UsNv 785 pairing (M = -0.69) ( (21) = -3.58, t p = 0.001). Figure 6A shows the average sound pleasantness ratings in the UsNv pairing as 786 a function of the average match quality of UsNv pairs (R  = 0.60, 2 F (1, 20) = 29.63, p &lt; 0.001). In agreement with previous 787 findings, the average sound pleasantness in the UsNv pairs increased with greater match quality ratings. The average match 788 quality rating was 2.50 (SD = 1.00) with a range from 1.03 to 4.32. The means for all stimuli are available in Supplementary 789 File S2. Lastly, to illustrate the relationship between the effectiveness of a UsNv pairing and its match, Figure 6B depicts a 790 change function : the pleasantness rating of Us subtracted from the sound pleasantness rating of UsNv as a function of the match 791 quality rating of UsNv pairs. The best-fitting line to the data shows that a greater match quality is associated with a greater effect 792 of the neutral visual source (R  = 0.49, 2 F (1, 20) = 19.03, p = 0.003). At the lowest match quality rating (1), the change in sound 793 pleasantness is approximately -0.21. Thereafter, the change in sound pleasantness increases by 0.53-points with every 1-point 794 increase in match quality rating. We note that the sounds with the largest pleasantness change for our unscreened group were: 795 a person smacking their lips, a person eating chips, a person cracking their knuckles, and a person sniffing 2 , which changed 796 by 1.94, 1.56, 1.38, and 1.38 points, respectively. 797

Next, the results of Experiment 5B were harnessed to assess the reliability and validity of our pleasantness ratings 798 across studies. Ratings of sounds isolation ( Us )  were highly correlated between Experiments 5B and 4 (first exposure) (  = r 799 0.94, F (1, 20) = 164.34, p &lt; 0.001), and between Experiments 5B and 5A (  = 0.97, r F (1, 20) = 311.72, p &lt; 0.001). We also 800 found  a  significant  correlation  between  sound  pleasantness  ratings  of UsNv pairings  in  Experiment  5B  and  1  (across  all 801 participants, first exposure, r = 0.93, F (1, 20) = 123.40, p &lt; 0.001), as well as for match quality ratings of UsNv pairings in 802 Experiment 5B and 1 (  = 0.94, r F (1, 20) = 145.88, p &lt; 0.001). We attribute the high reproducibility of our data to our strict 803 headphone screening process and our catch trials. The convergent validity of the unimodal ratings of each sound source was 804 shown by the significant correlation between Us pleasantness ratings from Experiment 5B and the baseline Uv pleasantness 805 ratings  ( r = 0.70 , F (1, 20) = 19.66 , p &lt; 0.001, Supplemental File S2). Furthermore, conditions in study 5B provided the data 806 needed to test whether the duration of our sounds had any effect on pleasantness (see Supplemental File S2). Duration did not 807 correlate with sound pleasantness in either the Us or UsNv conditions. 808

## Comparison of Experiments 5A and 5B 819

|   820 | The abstract pleasant paintings in Experiment 5A caused a small, yet reliable, increase in pleasantness of the sounds.                        |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   821 | This could support the hypothesis that visual pleasantness influences sound ratings. Importantly, although the match quality of               |
|   822 | U s P p is correlated to the sound pleasantness of U s P p , its match quality does not relate to the change in pleasantness, U s P p - U s . |
|   823 | The size of the change in sound pleasantness produced by the paintings (0.37 points), although reliable, is smaller than the                  |
|   824 | change produced by video sources in Experiment 5B (0.58 points), even though the paintings are more visually pleasant (3.46                   |
|   825 | points) than the videos (1.29 points in Supplemental File S2). This comparison shows an advantage in the potency of source                    |
|   826 | reassignment over visual pleasantness. As an aside, we note that the pleasantness of the paintings decreased in their second                  |
|   827 | silent exposure, potentially indicating that the intervening U s P p condition may have formed associations between the paintings             |
|   828 | and the unpleasant sounds. It was expected that there would be a significant correlation between video only and sound only                    |
|   829 | pleasantness, given their common meanings in terms of source events; however, we note that with r = 0.70, half of the variance                |
|   830 | amongst stimuli is specific to the perceptual modality and individual stimulus properties rather than being entirely determined               |
|   831 | by their common source events.                                                                                                                |
|   832 | Both Experiments 5A and 5B expose listeners to the same sounds twice. This leaves open the possibility that ratings                           |
|   833 | could increase with visual stimuli purely due to repeated exposure. However, because Experiment 4 found that our unpleasant                   |
|   834 | sounds did not become more pleasant upon second exposure, we conclude that the results of Experiments 5A and 5B reflect                       |
|   835 | true increases in sound pleasantness due to the visual stimuli in the second half.                                                            |
|   836 | There is a substantial difference between Experiments 5A and 5B (cf. Figures 5B and 6B). Plotting the relationship                            |
|   837 | between change in sound pleasantness and match quality removes effects of the sound's inherent pleasantness. It                               |
|   838 | the mere correlation between match and pleasantness in these experiments (cf. Figures 5A and 6A) does not provide evidence                    |

- that  a  better  match causes a  stronger  source  reassignment.  We  posit  that  a  strong  relationship  between change in  sound 839

pleasantness and match quality implies that the visual stimulus is reassigning the source. Therefore, a source reassignment 840 hypothesis is supported for videos (Figure 6) whereas it is not supported it for paintings (Figure 5). This result left open the 841 question of what caused the change in sound pleasantness for paintings. 842

## Experiment 5C: Cross-modal agreement and match ratings 844

The results of Experiment 5A led to further questions regarding the meaning of the match ratings. Firstly, why were 845 many of the sound-painting match ratings greater than 1 (on a scale of 1 to 5) for randomly paired, meaningless visual stimuli? 846 Experiment 5C tested whether the match ratings in Experiment 5A indicate the degree of cross-modal agreement between the 847 painting and the sound. Secondly, why do the match ratings correlate at all with the pleasantness ratings of the sounds within 848 the painting-sound pairs? One possibility is that paintings with better cross-modal agreement in the UsPp pairs have a greater 849 influence on the pleasantness of the sound. To investigate these questions,  a study analogous to the cross-modal study in 850 Experiment 3C was conducted. Participants were instructed to categorize each of the sounds and paintings as matching the 851 word 'maluma' or 'takete' as a means of measuring cross-modal agreement. 852

853

## Method 854

|   855 | As part of the study reported in Experiment 3C, the same 32 participants (M age = 21.88 years; range = 18 to 29 years;             |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   856 | 15 females, 13 males, four non-binary) judged whether the name 'luma' m a orakete' ' t best matched the 144 paintings used in      |
|   857 | Experiment 5A. See Experiment 3C Methods for further details. After each stimulus was categorized as being either a                |
|   858 | ' maluma ' or a ' takete, ' every U s P p pairing was categorized as being either in cross- modal 'agreement(e.g., ' 'maluma sound |
|   859 | with 'maluma' painting) or in cross -modal 'disagreement' ( e.g., ' maluma ' sound with a ' takete ' painting).                    |
|   860 |                                                                                                                                    |

## Results 861

37 Experiment 5C tested the prediction that the increase in Us pleasantness resulting from abstract paintings would relate 862 to their individual cross-modal agreement in sound symbolism. Seven unpleasant sounds, eight neutral sounds, and 77 pleasant 863 paintings were rated by more than 50% of the participants as ' Inter Maluma. ' -rater agreement (ICC Alpha) for unpleasant 864

that were in pairs with cross-modal disagreement (M = 0.21, SD = 1.65), ( (366) = 2.07,

agreement based on sound symbolism

does account for significant variation in the match ratings in Experiment 5A, which

offers an explanation as to why there were modest match ratings in that study. Additionally, because cross-modal agreement did  predict  the  size  of  the  effect  from  a  pleasant  painting,  it  also  offers  a  mechanism  for  how  paintings  increased  sound

874

pleasantness without reassigning the sound source.

As stated  earlier,  the source reassignment  hypothesis posits  that  the  neutral  visual  sources  cause  the  observer  to 875 reassign the source of the sound to the depicted event, thereby increasing the perceived pleasantness of the sound. Experiments 876 1 and 5B revealed that alternative neutral visual sources can change the pleasantness of the sound as a function of how well the 877 neutral visual source and sound match. We did not see such a change function in Experiment 5A; sound pleasantness increased 878 or decreased regardless of the match of an abstract painting. The significant slope relating changes in pleasantness as a function 879 of match in Experiment 5B is consistent with the source reassignment hypothesis , whereas changes in intercept only, seen in 880 Experiment 5A, are inconsistent with it. 881

## General discussion 882

Altogether, these experiments indicate that the perceived pleasantness of a sound can be modulated by pairing the 883 sound with visual or semantic input, but the mechanisms for this change differ between conditions. A shift in sound pleasantness 884 can be achieved by: (1) combining a sound with a dynamic visual source, (2) combining a sound with a text description of an 885 alternative source, and (3) combining an unpleasant sound with a pleasant but meaningless visual image. To support these and 886 future studies, we describe and validate a new database of openly available stimuli. 887 888 889 890

Our finding that neutral videos increase the pleasantness of sounds agrees with past research [12,16,23]. We found that the increase caused by neutral videos was significantly greater for a misophonic group when we looked across our entire study, which differs from [16] which found differences in bodily sensations but not a greater effect on pleasantness for their misophonic group. Testing order is a possible reason for the difference, because they used a within-participants design in which 891

- all the positive videos were seen first, whereas our design showed half the positive and half the negative videos first. As found 892 by others [23], we found that the response to a video depended on what had preceded it. Although the effect of neutral text 893 descriptions on the pleasantness of an unpleasant sound is smaller than the effect of videos of neutral visual sources, text 894 descriptions do produce robust effects that are consistent with source reassignment. Our results agree with past studies using 895 words [10,11]. An advantage of our studies is that we show that both our visual sources and descriptions exhibit the same 896 quantitative  relationship,  suggesting  that  they  are  subserved  by  the  same  mechanism.  Furthermore,  we  show  that  text 897 descriptions work for misophonic participants as well as for non-misophonics. While our sounds are mostly well-identified in 898 isolation, ambiguity tends to help an unpleasant sound to match with, and be affected by, an alternative source. This result 899 agrees with others showing the importance of trigger identification [6 -8]. A strength of our studies is that they show that the 900 quantitative difference between the pleasantness of the unpleasant sounds and their neutral counterparts is large enough to 901 account for the size of the pleasantness shift caused by visual sources. 902

Furthermore, although sound pleasantness can be altered by meaningless pleasant visual input, we conclude that visual 903 pleasantness is not the primary underlying mechanism for the beneficial effect of the neutral visual sources. This is because 904 visual pleasantness and source reassignment have different effects on the change function . If the visual/semantic input alters 905 the  perceived  source  of  the  sound,  the  magnitude  of  the  change  in  sound  pleasantness  associated  with  changing  the 906 visual/semantic input should vary systematically as a function of the plausibility match between a sound and its visual/semantic 907 input.  While  other  studies  have  measured  audio-visual  match  [12,16,23],  we  propose  a  novel  way  to  confirm  source 908 reassignment with a change function . We observe a change function when neutral visual sources and descriptions are paired 909 with unpleasant sounds (as in Experiments 1, 2, and 5B). In contrast, if visual input does not alter the perceived source of the 910 sound, the plausibility match ratings should be unrelated to the magnitude of the change, even if the overall mean does shift. 911 We observe this alternative pattern when pleasant unrelated images are paired with unpleasant sounds (Experiment 5A) and 912 when unpleasant visual sources are paired with neutral sounds (Experiment 3A). 913

914

Because  the  relationship  between  source  plausibility  and  change  in  pleasantness  is  central  evidence  for  source

915

916

917

918

reassignment, it is important to empirically test the meaning of the plausibility match rating when source reassignment is not evident. First, we asked why there could be a match without a meaningful visual stimulus in Experiment 5A. We found evidence

that the weak-moderate match ratings between the abstract paintings and sounds were attributable to cross-modal agreement.

Second, we showed with Experiments 3B and 3C that the match rating based on source plausibility in Experiment 3A was not

|   919 | simply a rating of audio-visual temporal alignment, nor was it a reflection of cross-modal agreement. Overall, conditions that    |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   920 | show evidence of source reassignment do not show the effects of cross-modal agreement, and vice-versa.                            |
|   921 | Finally, we ask whether the pleasantness ratings reflect feelings about the sounds, or the sources of the sounds. The             |
|   922 | high agreement in the change versus match function for Experiments 1 and 2 suggest that, for a given level of match, the source   |
|   923 | reassignment process produced the same pleasantness regardless of whether visual stimuli or written descriptions depicted the     |
|   924 | event.                                                                                                                            |
|   925 | One limitation of this series of studies is that we included all stimuli in all studies, even after our first study indicated     |
|   926 | which stimuli were most effective. We did this for hypothesis testing, which required a wide range of movie matches and           |
|   927 | effectiveness. However, this approach is not ideal for applications which aim to maximize effect sizes. For such cases, we        |
|   928 | recommend selecting only the most effective stimuli from our publicly available stimulus set [49].                                |
|   929 | More limitations arise because these studies were not conducted in naturalistic settings. We do not know whether the              |
|   930 | effects of source reassignment would extend beyond a few seconds, or whether they would influence sounds encountered              |
|   931 | outside the lab. Future studies in clinical settings are needed. The generalizability of our studies is limited by our sample     |
|   932 | population of young adults, which should be remedied with broader sampling methods. While movies are not a practical              |
|   933 | treatment in a natural setting, descriptions of sources have the advantage of being available via memory and without any need     |
|   934 | for technology. Our stimuli were not customized triggers for each individual because custom movies are difficult to make.         |
|   935 | A ddressing an individual's unique trigger sounds may be easier with written descriptions. However, our                           |
|   936 | had a smaller effect than our movies. It is possible that further refinement of the written descriptions could improve both their |
|   937 | matches and effectiveness.                                                                                                        |
|   938 | It is worth noting that there are other factors that shift sound pleasantness. For example, self-generated perceptual             |
|   939 | input can also modulate emotional responses to sounds. Mimicking behavior (e.g. a listener sniffs in the presence of someone      |
|   940 | else who is sniffing) is observed in misophonia and it is speculated that this may reduce the severity of the negative experience |
|   941 | from a misophonic trigger [47]. As another example, the emotional response to a soundscape, which typically involves multiple     |
|   942 | sound sources, depends upon the relative weight given to different sound sources, with unpleasant sounds being more influential   |
|   943 | than pleasant sounds [48].                                                                                                        |
|   944 | Given that everyday sounds are ubiquitous, they can be difficult to avoid. Acomprehensive treatment for misophonia                |
|   945 | will need to do more than block out external sounds or avoid situations that may involve triggering unpleasant sounds. The        |
|   946 | present findings could potentially be leveraged to help with everyday exposures to triggers. First, professional treatment could  |

involve gathering a list of triggering sounds and finding plausible alternative sources for them. Alternative sources could be 947 shown in movies such as the ones described in this research. If movies are unavailable, our data indicate that verbal descriptions 948 of alternative sources should also be effective. This cognitive reframing could prepare the person to imagine an alternative 949 source whenever they hear a trigger in the real world. If an individual can draw on that experience in real-time and imagine 950 that trigger sounds are coming from a different source, this might reduce the severity of their emotional reaction to the sound 951 in the moment. 952

953

## Summary and conclusion 954

Experiments  1,  3,  and  5  revealed  that  movies  displaying  a  visual  source  with  a  sound  can  robustly  change  the 955 pleasantness  of  that  sound.  In  Experiment  1,  when  a  neutral  visual  source  is  paired  with  an  unpleasant  sound  ( UsNv ),  the 956 unpleasant sound is rated as more pleasant than when the sound is paired with its original visual source ( UsUv ). In Experiment 957 3A, the effect is nearly equal and opposite for neutral sounds; the neutral sound is rated as less pleasant when paired with an 958 unpleasant visual source ( NsUv ) than when the sound is paired with its original visual source ( NsNv ). The results of Experiments 959 1  and  5B  indicate  that  the  change  in  sound  pleasantness  from  neutral  visual  sources  is  strongly  influenced  by  the  source 960 plausibility match between the visual source and the paired sound. Specifically, a high match promotes the reassignment of the 961 sound's causal source .  As Experiment 5A showed, visual pleasantness devoid of semantic content does not account for the 962 effect of visual sources. In contrast, Experiment 2 shows that semantic content does account for the effect, because the written 963 description of the neutral source events produces nearly as much of a change in sound pleasantness as the corresponding movies 964 do. The effect of neutral visual sources is even more beneficial for misophonic than for non-misophonic participants. 965

In conclusion, attributing an unpleasant sound to a more neutral source may make the sounds more tolerable in the 966 moment. We propose that a change function be used to determine whether a given stimulus is causing a source reassignment. 967 Because an audio-visual match can mean multiple things, we propose that judgements about matching should be very clear 968 about the definition of a match. Although movies produce a larger effect than words or images, presumably due to being more 969 compelling, it is possible that purely semantic descriptions could be at least half as effective, while being much simpler to make 970 and use. In the future, perhaps combining improved text descriptions with neutral or positive pictures would come close to 971 being as effective as movies. 972

UsNv pairs in Experiment 1 and Samermit et

al.,  (2022).  Data  from  Experiment  1  (across  all  participants)  is  indicated  by  yellow  symbols  and  a  solid  line.  Note,  our pleasantness ratings were transformed from an 11-point scale to a 5-point scale to be congruent with Samermit et al., (2022).

Data from Samermit et al., (2022) is indicated by purple symbols and a dashed line. Yellow symbols with a purple outline reflect movies that were borrowed from Samermit et al., (2022) to be used in Experiment 1. Each data point represents the

mean rating across observers for one unpleasant sound, while the error bar reflects the standard error of the mean. (B) The relationship between average sound pleasantness ratings for
