ABSTRACT  
Objectives:  Decreased sound tolerance (DST)  is common in children with auditory processing 
disorder (APD).  This study aimed t o differentiate between hyperacusis and misophonia in 
children with APD . 
Design:  A retrospective study evaluating outcomes of structured history  and co-morbidity 
following  Research Domain Criteria  (RDoC)  frame -work . Misophonia was considered as 
oversensitivity  to eating /chewing  sounds  and hyperacusis as oversensitivity to other sounds.  
Study sample : Two hundred and seventy -nine children  (160 males;119 f emales ), 6-16 year -
olds with NVIQ ≥80, diagnosed with APD  between January 2021 and December 2022.  
Results : One hundred and forty -three out of 279 children  with APD  had DST, of which 107 
had hyperacusis  (without misophonia ) and 36 had misophonia .  Misophonia co-existed with 
hyperacusis  in 35 children  (97%) , and in one child misophonia occurred without hyperacusis . 
Misophonia was prevalent in  older children,  in females , and those with tinnitus . Fear and 
being upset w ere predominant emotional response in hyperacusis  (without misophonia ) 
while  disgust and verbal abuse  were prevalent in misophonia  (with  or without hyperacusis ). 
Compared to children without DST, the hyperacusis  (without misophonia)  and misophonia  
(with or without  hyperacusis)  groups  had significant  higher prevalence of ADHD, anxiety, 
and language impairment.  Educational difficulties were similar in APD irrespective of the 
presence or absence of DST . Despite higher tinnitus prevalence in misophonia  (with or 
without  hyperacusis)  along with similar co -morbidities and educational difficulties in both 
hyperacusis  (without misophonia)  and misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis) , the 
misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis)  group  surprisingly had less support at school  
which was reflected in  fewer  Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP).  
Journal Pre-proof

Conclusions : In APD misophonia mostly co-exists with hyperacusis , with  differences in 
emotional response s, tinnitus prevalence, and gen der distribution when compared to 
hyperacusis (without misophonia ). Increase  in awareness about  misophonia  is needed , as 
children with misophonia  may have uniden tified  needs . Larger scale prospective study is 
required to cl arify if misophonia evolves from hyperacusis , and to explore th e factors 
underlying ‘misophonia with hyperacusis ’ and ‘misophonia without hyperacusis’ . For clarity, 
DST stud ies need to specify i f hyperacusis or misophonia co-existed  when referring to 
hyperacusis or misophonia .

Highlights:  
• Research Domain Criteria frame -work is helpful in comprehensive assessment of 
children w ith auditory processing disorder ( APD ) and decreased sound tolerance  
(DST).  
• First known study to explore prevalence of hyperacusis and misophonia in children 
with APD  
• Misophonia in approximately 97% co-exist with hyperacusis  
• Tinnitus is more common in misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis ) compared  to 
hyperacusis  (without miso phonia ) 
• Predominant emotional response in hyperacusis  (without misophonia ) is ‘fear’ 
compared to ‘verbal aggressiveness ’ in misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis ) 
• Misophonia with  hyperacusis  is more common in females than hyperacusis (without 
misophonia ) 
• Despite significantly more co -morbidities compared to children with APD and 
hyperacusis (without misophonia), children with misophonia (with or without 
hyperacusis) are less likely to receive Education, Health and Care Plan.

1. Introduction  
Children with oversensitivity to sounds or decreased sound tolerance (DST) , that mainly 
relates  to hyperacusis and misophonia,  makes up a significant proportion of referrals to 
paediatric audiology clinics . Differentiating between hyperacusis and misophonia is 
impo rtant for appropriate management, which has been difficult due to lack of consensus 
on the definition, similarities in presentation, and descriptions that are based on diverse 
populations in different studies [1-4].  Hyperacusis and misophonia not only  co-exist with 
each other [1] but also with other conditions. Overlapping co -morbidities is a recognised 
feature of neurodiverse and mental health conditions [5]. A diagnostic approach involving 
detailed clinical history [6] and evaluation of symptoms  related to functional connectivity of 
related neural networks in identifying unique characteristics as well as features common to 
other co -morbid conditions in a specific population would be helpful. The Research Domain 
Criteria (RDoC) frame work is such an approach  that has been  recommended to be utilized 
in evaluating DST  [2].  
 
 Swedo and colleagues (2022)  suggested that misophonia is associated with impaired 
auditory processing, emotional regulation, and learning  [3]. Association between a uditory  
processing disorder  (APD)  and hyperacusis has been reported , both in children  [7] and 
adults [8]. Not much is known about misophonia in APD . RDoC framework is already in 
clinical  use to evaluate APD  [9,10]  which  enquires about different aspects of DST in addition 
to relevant co -morbidities and educational concerns .  
 
Current definitions of hyperacusis and misophonia lack clarity [1]. Hyperacusis is seen as 
DST related to the physical characteristics of sound such as loudness, but misophonia has 
Journal Pre-proof

also been mentioned to be partially related to physical characteristics of sounds. Both 
misophonia and hyperacusis are associated with strong emotional responses , arising from 
primary or secondary activation of the limbic system.  Additionally , hyperacusis and 
misophonia have been reported to co -exist  [1] but the extent of overlap is not known. 
Therefore it is not clear how to differentiate between hyperacusis and misophonia based on 
the physical characteristics of sound or specific emotional r esponse s. To ensure clarity, the 
current study simply defined misophonia as over -sensitivity to sound of eating/chewing, the 
predominant trigger  [11-13], and hyperacusis as oversensitivity to other sounds . Such  
definition s were felt as a good starting po int to develop our understanding of misophonia 
and hyperacusis , with the scope to add additional characteristics based on the outcome of 
initial comparison. Based on data from routine APD clinical practice, this article aimed to 
explore:  
i. Prevalence of DST in children with APD  
ii. Extent of overlap between  hyperacusis and misopho nia 
iii. Differentiating between hyperacusis  (without misophonia)  and misophonia  (with or 
without hyperacusis)  in the following areas : 
a. Age  
b. gender  
c. Different sound  triggers  
d. Different e motional responses  
e. Co-morbidities  
 
2. Material  and m ethod s 
2.1. Study design  
Journal Pre-proof

This study  was an approved  quality improvement project at a regional teaching hospital 
located in the Northwest region of the United Kingdom. Data were obtained retrospectively 
from health  care  records of children diagnosed with  Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) in 
the paediatric audio -vestibular medicine department , between  January 2021 and December 
2022 .  
 
2.2. Participants  
Two hundred and seventy -nine  children  (Males= 160, Females=119) with a diagnosis of APD, 
aged between 6 and 16 years (M ean =11.6 years ; SD= 2.1), with a nonverbal intelligent 
quotient (NVIQ)  ranging between 80 -128 (M ean = 98.9; SD = 9.9) were studied. All 
participants were healthy English -speaking children attending mainstream schools.  All the 
participants had pure tone audiometric thresholds ≤ 20 dB HL at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10 and 12.5  
kHz in both ears . 
 
2.2.1. Hearing th reshold  
Pure -tone audiometry was carried out using a PC controlled AURICLE Aud (GN Otometrics) 
audiometer, operated from the OTOsuite Audiometry Module PC software, and Sennheiser 
HDA 300 headphones.  
 
2.2.2. Tympanometry  
GSI Graston Stadler TympStar Pro was used for tympanometry. Participants had middle ear 
pressures between +50 to -200 daPa.  
 
Journal Pre-proof

2.2.3. NVIQ was evaluated using the fourth edition of the test for nonverbal intelligence 
[14]. Participants in this study had NVIQ  ≥ 80, to ensure that the listening difficulty related 
to APD was not due to poor cognitive ability.  
 
2.2.4.  APD diagnos is 
The APD diagnostic procedure involved structured history, physical examination, screening 
for common neurodevelopmental conditions, and diagnostic APD test battery. For detail of 
APD diagnosis please see Ahmmed et al. (2022) .  
 
2.3. Decreased sound tolerance and types  
The structured history enquired about over -sensitivity to sounds , with  four response choices : 
‘Never’, ‘Occasionally’, Most times’ and ‘Always’ .  There were  37 various  day-to-day sound  
choice s in addition to an option of   specify ing other sounds not included in the questionnaire.  
Responses of  ‘Always ’ or ‘Most times ’ were considered as significant DST , and ‘Never’ or 
‘Occasionally’  were considered as ‘No DST ’. Impact of DST on the daily activities were 
assessed by  responses : “Not su re”, “ No restriction”, “Little  (mild)  impact”, “ Moderate”, and 
“Severe” . Participants were divided in three groups:  
Group A - No DST 
Group B - Hyperacusis  (without misophonia) : Oversensitivity to sounds other than   
eating /chewing . 
Group C - Misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis) : Oversensitive to sounds of 
eating/ chewing , with or without sensitivity to other sounds  in Group B . The reason for 
not dividing misophonia into two groups, ‘misophonia with hyperacusis’ and 
‘misophonia without hyperacusis’ is outlined in results section 3.1.  
Journal Pre-proof

2.4. Other  sensory  over -sensitivities  
Over -sensitivities to  touch, smell, taste , eating, light, and pain  were recorded .  
 
2.5. Emotional  responses  
Different emotional response s triggered by the  offending sounds were : being annoyed, 
anxious, complaining of loudness, crying/screaming, disgusted, distressed , frightened , gets 
angry, hits others,  in pain,  upset,  and verbally abusive . 
 
2.6. Co-morbidities  
Common  co-morbidities  were assessed using validated questionnaires  [15,16] that included :  
 
2.6.1. Tinnitus  
The presence or absence of tinnitus were noted in the history questionnaire .  
 
2.6.2. Language Impairment  (LI) 
Children’s Communication Checklist –2 [17] identif ied language impairment  (LI) based on the 
General Communication Composite (GCC) and the Social Interaction Deviance Composite 
(SIDC) . GCC <45  and SIDC ≤-15 were considered as LI.  
 
2.6.3. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder  (ADHD)  
Strength and weakness in ADHD symptoms and normal behaviour (SWAN) rating scale was 
used to evaluate ADHD  [18]. Inattention  and impulsivity /hyperactivity  symptoms were 
evaluated using nine  items each . Averaged score s >2.11, >2.48, and > 2 suggest ed combined, 
inattention and hyperactive types of ADHD  respectively . 
Journal Pre-proof

2.6.4. Manual dexterity  
Fifth percentile cut -off in the m anual dexterity sub -set of the  second edition of the 
Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC -2) [19] was used to identify  impaired 
manual dexterity.  
 
2.6.5. Anxiety  
The 24 -item ‘ Anxiety Scale  for Children  with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASC -ASD) ’ 
completed by children and carers evaluated anxiety  [20]. The maximum total score is 72 . 
Score s ≥ 20 suggest ed significant anxiety.  
 
2.6.6.  Academic concerns and support at school  
The participants reading, spelling, writing and numeracy skills  were recorded as ‘very good’, 
‘good ’, ‘average’, ‘poor’, or ‘very poor’  by the parents/carers . ‘Very poor’ and ‘poor’ were 
considered as  educational  concern.  Participants who had Education , Health  and 
 Care Plan (EHCP) at school were recorded . 
 
2.7. Data analysis  
SPSS version  29 was used for st atistical analyses . The data were not normally distributed. 
Krus kal-Wallis  tests carried out for continuous  variable s. Bonferroni correction of p value 
were carried out for multiple tests, and values <.05 were consi dered as statistically 
significant . Cross tabulations and Chi -square tests were carried out for categorical data.  
3. Results  
3.1. Preval ence and types of DST in children with APD  
Journal Pre-proof

One hundred and thirty six participants (48.7% ; 95% CI 42.7% -54.8% ) did not have DST 
(Group A ), 107  (38.4% ; 95% CI 32.6% -44.3% ) had hyperacusis  without misophonia  (Group B, 
over -sensitive  to sounds other than eating /chew ing), and 36 (12.9% ; 95% CI 9.2% -17.4% ) 
had misophonia (Group C, over -sensitive to the sound of eating /chewing , with or without 
hyperacusis).  Only a 12.5 year old male  in Group C  with  NVIQ of 109, anxiety, impaired 
manual dexterity, language impairment, and oversensitivity to touch  sensation developed 
misophonia only at the age of 10 years without any symptoms of hyperacusis .  Due to the 
single case of misophonia without hyperacusis , all participants with oversensitivity to sound 
of eating/chewing irrespective of the presence or absence of  hyperacusis were considered  
together  in Group C as misophonia.  
 
3.2. Age, gender  and NVIQ   
Group A comprised 82 males and 54 females, 6 - 16 year -olds (mean 11.7, SD 2.1), NVIQ 81 -
125 (mean 98.7, SD 9.6). Group B comprised 66 ma les and 41 females, 7 -16 year -olds (mean 
11.3, SD 2.1), NVIQ 80 -127 (mean 99.5, SD 10.1). Group C comprised 12 males and 24 
females, 7 -16 year -olds (mean 12.6, SD 2.4), NVIQ 84 -128 (mean 97.3, SD 10.6). Significantly 
more females than males were notes in  Group C , compared to groups A [ꭓ2 (1, N=172) =8.35, 
p<.01] and B [ꭓ2 (1, N=143)= 8.73, p<.01]. Gender differences between Groups A and B were 
not significant , with significantly more males in Groups A and B compared to Group C . 
Participants in g roup C were significantly older than group s A and  B (p<.01).  NVIQ were not 
different between the groups (p>.05).  
 
3.3. Different  sound triggers  
Journal Pre-proof

The number of sound triggers varied , ranging from one to 28 sounds  (average 12)  in group 
B, and from one to 36 sounds  (average  14) sounds in addition to sound of  eating  in group C . 
In group C  the oversensi tivity to the sole  sound  was the ‘sound of eating/chewing’ and was 
noted in only one child .  Detailed comparison  between the groups  is shown in Table 1. Some 
triggers were common in both groups  such as ‘unexpected sounds ’, ‘any crowed places ’, 
‘loud voices ’, ‘hand-dryers ’, ‘firework ’ amongst others . Significantly larger numbers of group 
C participants were oversensitive to different body sounds other than eating/chewing , 
tapping, running taps and playground noises than those in group B.    
 
Table 1 Here  
 
3.4. Emotional /psychological responses  and impact on daily activi ty 
Table 2 compares emotional responses between groups B and C. Being “upset” and 
“frightened” were common  in Group B (p<.05). Verbal abuse and feeling of disgust were 
common in Group C (p<.01).  Figure 1 shows that complaint of loudness, annoyance, fear, 
and pain  overlapped.

     Figure 1 . Here  
 
Sixty -three percent children  in group  B and 58.3% in group C reacted  on anticipat ion of the 
trigger sounds (p>.05). In group  B, 33 of the 107 (30.8%) participants  and in group C , five of 
the 36  (13.8%)  participants used  ear defenders [ ꭓ2 (1, N=143 )=3.967; p<.05) .  
Journal Pre-proof

3.5. Comorbidities  
3.5.1. Other perceptual over -sensitivities  
Participants in the groups B and C had other sensory issues , detailed in table 3 . No 
statistically significant differences were seen between the two groups in terms of over -
sensitivity to touch, smell, taste, eating, pain and light between the two groups (p>. 05). 
 
    Table 3. Here  
 
3.5.2. Tinnitus  
Compared to Group A, s ignificantly more participants  reported tinnitus in groups B  [ ꭓ2 (1, 
N=237)=4.898 ; p<.0 5]  and C  [ ꭓ2 (1, N= 168)=15.272 ; p<.0 001].    Significant ly higher report 
of tinnitus was also seen in group C compared to group B  [ ꭓ2 (1, N= 141)=4.465; p<.05] . 
 
3.5.3. Language impairment  
LI was identified in 96 (70.5%  ), 97 ( 90.6%  ), and 32 ( 88.8% ) children  in groups A,B, and C 
respectively . The scatterplot for GGC and SI DC values is shown in figure 2.  Comparison of 
the GCC scores  showed significant difference between groups A, B and C [ H(2)=40.775; 
p<.001]. Compared to group A , both  groups B (p <.001)  and C (p<.01)  had low GCC . SIDC  
helps to ident ify the type of   LI, either structural (SIDC >8), or Pragmatic (SIDC  <0), or 
intermediate to  indicate either structural or pragmatic impairment  or a combination of 
both . Structural plus intermediate categor ies have higher probability of structural LI (SLI) , 
whereas  pragmatic plus intermediate categories have a higher probability of pragmatic 
impairment  (PLI) . There w ere 49, 47 and 13 participants with in the  SLI category  in groups A , 
B, and C respectively  [ ꭓ2 (2, N=279)=1.720; p>.05].   There were 80, 88 and 29 participants 
Journal Pre-proof

within the PLI category in groups A, B, and C respectively  [ ꭓ2 (2, N=279)= 17.797; p<.001]. 
Pairwise comparison showed significant ly larger number of PLI in group B compared to 
group A [ ꭓ2 (1, N=2 43)=14.754; p<.001] , and in group C compared to group A [ ꭓ2 (1, 
N=143)=5.791 ; p<.0 5]. No differences  was noted between groups B and C .

3.5.4. ADHD  symptoms  
SWAN rating score were missing for one participant in group A, for 2 participants in group B 
and one participant in group C. Based on 5th centile cut -off for SWAN score, eight 
participants in group A (6%), 20 in group B ( 19%), and eight in group C ( 23%) had significant 
ADHD symptoms , which was significant [ ꭓ2 (2, N=275)=12. 300; p<.01].  Compared to group 
A, more ADHD were diagnosed in groups B [ ꭓ2 (1, N=2 40)=9.867 ; p<.01]  and C [ ꭓ2 (1, 
N=170)=9.345 ; p<.01] . No difference noted between groups B and C (p>.05).  
 
3.5.5. Manual dexterity  
Using the 5th percentile cut -off in the manual dexterity sub -set of MABC -2, impaired manual 
dexterity was identified in 66 (48.5%) , 53 (49.5%), and 12 (33.3%) of participants in groups 
A,B, and C respectively. No significant differences were found between the groups  (p>.05) . 
3.5.6. Anxiety  
The Anxiety Scale for Children -ASD (ASC -ASD)  questionnaire completed by parent s identified  
anxiety issues in  53 (39%), 80 ( 75%), and  28 (78%) of children  in groups A, B, and C , which  
was significant  [ ꭓ2 (2, N=27 8)=39.257 ; p<.0 0001]. There was one missing data for group B. 
Compared to group A , larger number of children  had significant anxiety in both groups B  [ ꭓ2 
Journal Pre-proof

(1, N=2 42)=32.062 ; p<.0001] and C  [ ꭓ2 (1, N= 172)= 17.205 ; p<.0001] .   No significant 
difference was noted between groups B and C (P>.05).  
 
 The questionnaire completed by the children identified anxiety in 62 (46.6%) , 73 (71.5%) 
and 30 (83.3%) of children  in groups A, B, and C respectively  [ ꭓ2 (2, N= 271)=23.876 ; 
p<.0 0001 ].  Compared to Group A , more participants had significant anxiety scores in both 
groups B  [ ꭓ2 (1, N= 235)=14.702 ; p<.001]  and C [ ꭓ2 (1, N= 169)=15.339; p<.001] .  
 
3.5.7. Overlapping co -morbidities  
Figure s 3a and 3b demonstrate  overlap ping  co-morbidities  in the misophonia and 
hyperacusis groups  respectively . ADHD symptoms were only seen in those who also had 
language impairment .

   Figure 3b Here  
 
3.5.8. Educational difficulties  
Parents raised concerns about reading in 46 (33.8%), 45 (42%), and 10 (27.7%) children in 
groups A, B, and C respectively  [ ꭓ2 (2, N=2 79)=3.027 ; p>.05 ]. Concerns about spelling ability 
were raised in 69 (50.7 %), 57 (53.2 %), and 1 9 (52.7 %) children  in groups A, B, and C 
respectively  [ ꭓ2 (2, N=279)= 0.165 ; p>.05].  Poor or very poor numeracy skills wer e reported 
in 58  (42.6%) , 48 (45.2%) , and 15 (41.6%)  children  in groups A, B, and C respectively  [ ꭓ2 (2, 
N=27 8)=0.226 ; p>.05].  There was one missing data for group B.

3.5.9. Education and Health Care Plan  (EHCP)  
30 (22.5%) , 38 (36.8%) , and 6  (16.6%)  children  in groups A, B, and C respectively  had EHCP , 
and the group differences was significant [ꭓ2(2,N=27 2)=8.351 ; p<.05].  There were few 
missing data, 3 in group  A and 4 in group B. Significantly more participants in group B had 
EHCP compared to group s A [ ꭓ2 (1, N= 236)=5.816; p<.05]  and C [ ꭓ2 (1, N= 139)=5.044 ; 
p<.0 5].  
 
4. Discussion  
4.1. Sound triggers  
The findings in this study of significant over -sensitivity to tapping, clicking and different 
body sounds other than eating and chewing in misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis)   is 
consistent with the literature  (Table 1) .  The trigger of t apping and clicking sound in 63%  of 
participants with misophonia  in this study  is not dissimilar  to  74%, 54%, 38.4%, 25.4% and 
14% reported by  Brennan et al. (2024), Guzick et al. (2022), Jager et al. (2020); Rosenthal et 
al. (2022) and Siepsiak et al. (2023)  respectively  [12, 21 -24]. Breathing sounds as a trigger in 
55.5% cases  in this study a lso compare s well with 59% reported by [24]. Our study adds that 
sounds of running water taps and noises in the playground are also misophonia  triggers .     
 
Over -sensitivity to sounds  such as unexpected sounds, noises associated with a crowd in 
school or social gathering, loud voices, sirens/alarms, fireworks amongst others present  in 
both hyperacusis and misophonia  is consistent with the view that misophonia coexists with 
hyperacusis  [1, 23] . Our study adds to the literature that in about 97% cases misophonia co-
existed with  hyperacusis ( 35 out of 36 children with misophonia had hyperacusis, see 
Results  section 3.1) . 
Journal Pre-proof

4.2. Emotional responses  
 Tyler et al. (2014)  subcategorised hyperacusis as loudness, annoyance (misophonia) fear 
(phonophobia) and pain hyperacusis [25]. The present study suggests loudness, annoyance, 
fear and pain responses co -exist (Table 2, and Figure 1)  in hyperacusis  (without misophonia)  
and misophonia  (with  or without hyperacusis) , consistent with   Brennan et al. (2024)  [23]. 
There were no difference s in compla int about   loudness between  hyperacusis  (without 
misophonia ) and misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis) , and distinction between them 
based on  oversensitivity to physical characteristics of sounds , suggested by  Jastreboff and 
Jastreboff  [1], is difficult.  Consistent with Tyler et al. (2014)  ‘fear’ was the predominant 
response  in hyperacusis  (without misophonia)  [25], in addition to ‘being  upset ’ by sounds. 
The  low prevalence of fear in misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis)  noted in this study 
is consistent with Siepsiak et al. (2023) [24].  
 
Verbal abuse and being disgusted by the  trigger sounds were significantly high in 
misophoni a (with or without hyperacusis)  in this study . Disgust has been reported in 
misophonia in 57% by Siepsiak et al. (2023)  [24], 64% by Jager et al. (2020) [12], and 68% by  
Guzick et al. (2022)  [21]. High levels of verbal aggression in misophonia has been reported in 
the literature [21]. 
 
4.3. Co-morbidities  
The overlap of multiple  co-morbidities in  this study in hyperacusis  (without misophonia)  
(Figure 3a) and misophonia  (with or without hyperac usis) [ Figure 3b] is consistent with the 
RDoC framework [5] and APD literature  [9]. 
 
Journal Pre-proof

4.3.1 Language impairment  
More than 90%  of participants in the hyperacusis  (without misophonia)  and misophonia  
(with or without hyperacusis)  group s in this study had language impairment, mainly 
pragmatic language impairment (Figures 2, 3a & 3b). Previous studies have demonstrated 
high levels of pragmatic language impairment in children with DST in APD but no distinction 
was made between hyperacusis and m isophonia [7]. To the best of the authors knowledge, 
this is the first study attempting to distinguish hyperacusis and misophonia in children with 
APD. This study suggests that hyperacusis and misophonia  could not be differentiated based 
on the language impairment , using  CCC2  outcome  in children with APD .  
 
4.3.2. Anxiety  
More than 70 % participants in both the  hyperacusis  (without misophonia)  and misophonia  
(with or without hyperacusis) groups  had  anxiety issues , significantly more than those 
without  DST. The above finding is consistent with the literat ure in hyperacusis [26], 
misophonia [27] and   sensory over -responsivity [28]. Siepsiak et al. (2022)   reported high 
anxiety levels in misophonia, but comparison with hyperacusis was difficult due to the small 
number of participants in the hyperacusis group  [29]. Guzick et al. (2022)  reported social 
anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder in  30% and 27% of youth with misophonia 
respectively [21], and  Rosenthal et al. (2022)  reported 56.9% of individuals with misophonia 
met the full criteria for at least one anxiety disorder  [22]. Rinaldi et al. (2022)  also showed 
significant anxiety le vels in children with misophonia  [30]. However, unlike the current 
study, the above studies did not compare anxiety between misophonia and hyperacusis. 
Anxiety score was unable to differentiate between hyperacusis (without misophonia) and 
misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis ).   
Journal Pre-proof

4.3.3. ADHD  
ADHD identified in this study in APD is consistent with the literature [31], so is the 
association with misophonia. Twenty -three percent of participants in this study diagnosed 
with ADHD in the misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis)  group is consistent with 21% 
and 17.9% ADHD reported in misophonia by Guzick et al.(2022)  and Rosenthal et al. (2022)  
respectively  [21, 22]. Our study adds to the literature by demonstrating, firstly the presence 
of ADH D did not differentiate between hyperacusis  (without misophonia)  and misophonia  
(with or without hyperacusis) ; secondly presence of hyperacusis or misophonia increases 
the possibility ADHD in APD; and thirdly ADHD in hyperacusis and misophonia is present i n 
association with language impairment (see Fig ures  3a and 3b ).    
 
4.3.4. Impaired Manual Dexterity  
The recognition of the importance of sensory processing and motor function in mental 
health resulted in the inclusion of sensori -motor system in RDoC [32]. Impaired motor 
function is seen in many neurodevelopmental conditions associated with misophonia and 
hyperacusis, such as ADHD [33], APD [16], and ASD [34]. The current study adds to the 
literature by showing that impaired manual dexterity in APD was not influenced by DST.  
 
4.3.5. Tinnitus  
Hyperacusis has been suggested as a precursor of tinnitus  [35], and the current study show 
that tinnitus is more related to misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis) . The higher 
proportion of participants with misophonia to have tinnitus compared to the hyperacusis  
(without misophonia)  and no DST groups in the current study is consistent with Brennan et 
al. (2024)  [23] and Aazh et al. (2022)  [27]. Brennan et al. (2024)  reported significant 
Journal Pre-proof

association between misophonia and tinnitus  [23].  Report of tinnitus in 74% of individuals 
with misophonia by Aazh et al. (2022)  [27] is consistent with our study findings of  50 % 
children with APD and misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis)  to have tinnitus compared 
to 30.5% in the hyperacusis  (without misophonia)  and 18.2% in the no  DST groups .  
 
4.3.6. Other sensory oversensitivity  
Not many studies compared other sensory issues in misophonia and hyperacusis. Rosenthal 
et al. (2022)  reported sensory processing difficulties in 9.7% of misophonia participants, but  
no comparison was made with hyperacusis  [22]. Our study shows that other sensory over -
sensitivities varied from 22% to 58%  depending on the sensory domain and there were no 
significant differences between hyperacusis  (without misophonia)  and misophonia  (with or 
without hyperacusis) [ Table 3 ].   
 
4.4. Age  
Participants with misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis)  with mean age  of  12.6 y ears  
were significantly older than hyperacusis  (without misophonia) in this study ,  consistent 
with the mean ages of 11.7 and 13.7 years reported  in misophonia  by Rinaldi et al. (2022)  
and Guzick et al. (2022)  respectively  [21, 30]. However, the above two studies did not have a 
hyperacusis  comparison group .  
Our current study suggests DST is first noted in infancy, but it is unclear about the initial 
sounds they were sensitive to.  Siepsiak et al. (2023)  reported that in 4 out of 45 children 
with misophonia oversensitivity to sounds of eating was present by the age of 3 years, but 
there was no hyperacusis group to compare with  [24].  
 
Journal Pre-proof

4.5. Gender  
The high prevalence of misophonia  (with or without hyper acusis)  in females (67%) in this 
study is  consistent with Rinaldi et al. (2022) , Guzick et al. (2022) , Jager et al. (2020) , and 
Rosenthal et al. (2022)  reporting 60%, 68%, 70.9% and 74.4%  female  prevalences of 
misophonia respectively [12, 21, 22, 30]. Our studies  adds to the literature by 
demonstrating higher female prevalence of misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis)  
compared to hyperacusis  (without misophonia) . This is interesting as both h yperacusis and 
misophonia co -exists with neurodevelop mental conditions like ADHD, APD and ASD [7, 21, 
22, 36, 37]  that are more prevalent in males  [38, 39]. In the current study , in terms of co -
morbidities misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis)  group had higher prevalence of 
tinnitus compared to the hyperacusis  (without misophonia)  group , and  no significant 
differences between the groups in respect of ADHD, anxiety and LI (see Results) . Rinaldi et 
al., (2022)  suggest that misophonia is associated with poorer well -being  [30]. It was 
therefore, sur prising to see that these children with misophonia (with or without 
hyperacus is) had fewer EHCP for support at school. Hyperacusis may be seen as a  precu rsor 
of misophonia and  the same neural system  is involved in both the conditions [1]. Emotional 
processing  and different expressions of mental disorders  are related to differential hypo - 
and hyper -activation of neural networks  within the same system  [40]  and it is possible that 
anxiety  and stress  [41] related to unmet needs may be the trigger fo r misophonia and other 
associated mental health issues  [22] or non -organic hearing loss [42] in children with APD . 
Another reason for lower EHCP in misophonia could be due to females internaliz ing the 
symptoms  [43] making identification by professionals  delayed and difficult.  Moreover, it 
could be related to lack of awareness of association between mental health and sensory 
oversensitivity [32]. Higher prevalence of  certain  mental health issues in females [44] and 
Journal Pre-proof

difficulties access ing Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS)  could be 
another factor  [45].  Future research is need to answer the underlying reason for the higher 
predominance of female in misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis) , and to compare the 
functional a ctivities within the neural networks in hyperacusis and misophonia . In view of 
co-morbidities it is important that children with APD are evaluated holistically with a 
neurodevelopmental pathway similar to ADHD and ASD.  
 
4.6. Prevalence  
No other studies have compared the prevalence of hyperacusis and misophonia in APD , 
therefore, we can also compare the findings of this study with prevalence of hyperacusis 
and misophonia in some co -morbid conditions. The 38.4% (95% CI 32.6% -44.3%)  prevale nce 
of hyperacusis  (with out misophonia)  in APD  in this study  is consistent with 37 -45% 
prevalence  of hyperacusis  reported in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [37]. There is no 
consensus and the prevalence of misophonia varies with diagnostic criteria used [23]. The 
35.5% prevalence of misophonia in ASD  [46] using the Duke -Vanderbilt Misophonia 
Questionnaire (DVMSQ)  was higher than 12.9% (95% CI 9.2% -17.4%) found in this study 
from clinical interview and structured history questionnaire in a routine APD  clinic.   
However, 36 participants with misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis)  out of 143 
participants with DST (25% ) in the current study is consistent with report of misophonia in  
23% of  patients attending hyperacusis and tinnitus clinics [27].  Our study adds to the 
literature that misophonia co-exists with hyperacusis  in approximately 97% cases (in 35 out 
of 36 children  with APD ).  
 
4.7. Limitation of the study  
Journal Pre-proof

The current study , being a  retrospective study  of 6-16 year olds,  was unable to  explore the 
progress of the hyperacusis and misophonia from the onset . The study found that only one 
out of 36 participants with  misophonia  did not have  hyperacusis. Therefore , this study was 
unable to explore features of ‘misophonia without hyperacusis ’ and larger studies are 
needed . Additionally , this study evaluated only a limited number of constructs , sub-
constructs and systems of the RDoC framework . Future studies are required with more 
multidisciplinary input explor ing other relevant RDoC components , such as visual 
processing.  It would also be worth future studies to explore any distinguishing features 
between individuals with ‘oversensitivity to  sound of eating/chewing ’ versus ‘oversensitivity 
to other bo dy generated sounds and repetitive tapping soun ds without oversensitivity to 
sound of eating/chewing’ . 
 
5. Conclusion  
This study compared hyperacusis  (oversensitivity to sounds other than eating/chewing ), 
misophonia  (oversensitivity to sounds of eating/chewing  with or without hyperacusis)  and 
no decreased sound tolerance  (no DST)  groups in children diagnosed with APD  using RDoC  
framework . Fifty -one percent had DST, constituting 7 5% hyperacusis  and 25% misophonia.  
Misophonia  mostly co-exist ed with hyperacus is. Misophonia (with or without hyperacusis) 
was prevalent in females  and in older children  compared to  hyperacusis  (without  
misophonia ). Compared to those with APD with out DST, both hyperacusis  (without  
misophonia)  and misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis)  were  associated with ADHD, 
anxiety , educational difficulties, and LI. In addition to oversensitivity to eating/chewing 
sounds , children with misophonia  plus hyperacusis  had higher prevalence of oversensitiv ity 
to other body sounds , repetitive clicking/tapping , running taps and playground noises . 
Journal Pre-proof

Issues with loudness, annoyance, fear and pain overlap ped, with fear and being upset with 
sounds being  prevalent responses in hyperacusis  (without misophonia) , while prevalent 
responses in misophonia (with or  without hyperacusis)  were  verbal abuse and disgust. 
Despite similar comorbidities and higher prevalence of tinnitus  compared to children  with 
APD  plus hyperacusis  (without misophonia) and higher prevalence of different co -
morbidities including tinnitus compared to children with  APD without DST , children with 
APD and misophonia  (with or without hyperacusis)  had fewer EHCP  compared to the other 
two groups . The need for increased vigilance of DST in females  is suggested  to ensure they 
do not have any unmet needs . The importance of  holistic evaluation of children with DST 
and APD within established neurodevelopmental pathway used for ADHD and ASD  is 
highlighted . For clarity, DST studies need to specify if hyperacusis or misophonia co -existed 
when referring to hyperacusis or misophonia.

Highlights:  
• Research Domain Criteria frame -work is helpful in comprehensive assessment of 
children with APD and decreased sound tolerance  
• First known study to explore prevalence of hyperacusis and misophonia in children 
with APD  
• Misophonia in approximately 97% co -exist with hyperacusis  
• Tinnitus is more common in misophonia (with or without hyperacusis) compared 
to hyperacusis (without misophonia)  
• Predominant emotional response in hyperacusis (without misophonia) is ‘fear’ 
compared to ‘verbal ag gressiveness’ in misophonia (with or without hyperacusis)  
• Misophonia with hyperacusis is more common in females than hyperacusis 
(without misophonia)  
• Despite significantly more co -morbidities compared to children with APD and 
hyperacusis (without misophoni a), children with misophonia (with or without 
hyperacusis) are less likely to receive Education, Health and Care Plan
