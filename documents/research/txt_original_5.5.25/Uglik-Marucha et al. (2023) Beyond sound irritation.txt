## Abstract

Misophonia is commonly associated with negative emotional or physiological responses to specific sounds or stimuli accompanying these sounds. However, the consensus definition emphasizes that misophonia entails much more than that. Even subclinical misophonia, where individuals are significantly affected by misophonia in their   lives   without   meeting   the   disorder   criteria,   can   have   notable   impacts   on personal and professional lives. The S-Five is a robust psychometric tool that allows for comprehensive research on various aspects of the misophonic experience. It captures five dimensions: internalizing appraisals, externalizing appraisals, impact, threat, and outburst, and includes a section (S-Five-T) to evaluate feelings evoked by   triggering   sounds   and   their   intensity.   We   examined   whether   the   five-factor structure   initially   developed   in   the   UK   could   be   replicated   in   a   Polish   sample, including individuals with and without self-identified misophonia.

The Polish version of the S-Five was (forward and backward) translated and tested on 288 Polish-speaking individuals. Comprehensive psychometric evaluation, including factor structure, measurement invariance assessment, test-retest reliability, internal   consistency,   and   concurrent   validity   evaluations,   was   conducted   on   the translated scale. Exploratory factor analysis confirmed the results of the original English study, while bootstrap exploratory graph analysis showed the factor structure to be reproducible in other samples. The scale was found to be bias free with respect to gender, internally consistent and stable in time, and evidence of validity was provided   using   MisoQuest   and   Misophonia   Questionnaire.   These   results   offer support   for   the   cross-cultural   stability   of   the   five   factors   and   confirm   the appropriateness of the Polish version for clinical and research purposes.

The study also examined misophonia triggers, emotional responses, cognitive attributions,   and   their   connection   to   psychopathology   symptoms.   Mouth   sounds, such as eating sounds, elicited the strongest reactions, while repetitive sounds triggered the least intense responses, consistent with other European studies using the S-Five. Anger, panic, and distress were correlated with misophonia symptoms, whereas irritation showed no relationship to the five aspects of misophonia. Disgust was weakly and negatively related to misophonic outbursts and S-Five total score.

Anger was related to externalising appraisal but even more to internalising scale. Anger was the most related to misophonia severity but not to anxiety and depression symptoms, highlighting its distinct role. The study emphasises the core role of anger, distress,   and   panic   in   misophonia   and   confirms   eating   sounds   as   predominant triggers.

## Introduction

Misophonia   is   a   recently   recognised   disorder   characterized   by   reduced tolerance to specific sounds or stimuli (Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff, 2002; Swedo et al., 2022). These sounds, known as 'triggers,' can elicit intense negative emotional, behavioural, and physiological responses unique to each individual  (Brout et al., 2018; Edelstein et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2017)  and may include anger, disgust, irritation, and anxiety (Jager et al., 2020; Swedo et al., 2022). Physiological reactions such as increased heart   rate,   muscular   tension,   and   sweating   can   also   occur (Edelstein et al., 2013; Rouw &amp; Erfanian, 2018; Schröder et al., 2017). Interestingly, misophonia's manifestation can be context-dependent, with reactions being more pronounced or limited to triggers produced by close friends and family (Edelstein et al., 2013). A recent study by Siepsiak et al. (2023) further revealed that the context of   mouth   sounds   can   significantly   influence   affective   experiences   in   adults   with misophonia. Misophonia can profoundly impact an individual's life, affecting work, academics, and interpersonal relationships (Brout et al., 2018).

In recent years, the literature on misophonia has seen a surge in interest, with more scientific articles being published between the years 2020 and 2023 than in all the previous years combined. Neacsiu et al. (2022) conducted a literature review on the   neurobiological   basis   of   misophonia,   concluding   that   it   has   unique neurobiological features that distinguish it from other disorders. Consistent with this finding,   studies   have   shown   that   misophonia   frequently   co-occurs   with   various psychiatric disorders and symptoms of psychopathology (Erfanian et al., 2019; Jager et al., 2020; Rosenthal et al., 2022; Siepsiak et al., 2022), even in childhood (Guzick et al., 2023; Rinaldi et al., 2022; Siepsiak, Turek, et al., 2023). However, there is no specific   diagnostic   entity   that   can   be   identified   as   exclusively   characteristic   of misophonia or that can fully explain its unique symptoms.

The prevalence of misophonia is currently estimated to vary between 5 to 20% in different populations. Studies based on representative samples of Germany, Turkey and the UK populations reported that 5%, 12.8%, and 18.4% of people experience significant symptoms of misophonia (Jakubovski et al., 2022; Kılıç et al., 2021; Vitoratou et al., 2023)  at clinical or subclinical levels. Similar rates (6-20%)

have been mentioned in student populations  (Sarigedik &amp; Gulle, 2021; Wu et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017) and a clinical sample (9-12%; Siepsiak et al., 2020), while one study on medical students revealed a surprisingly high  occurrence of this disorder in almost 50% of participants (Naylor et al., 2021).  Although various factors may contribute to the significant differences observed in the outcomes of these studies, it is crucial to employ cross-culturally validated questionnaires with rigorous psychometric properties. This approach ensures a more accurate measurement of misophonia and facilitates meaningful comparisons across different countries and populations.   In   a   systematic   review,  Kula   et   al.   (2023)  examined   psychometric measures of misophonia published in English between 2002 and 2020. Notably, these   tools   were   utilized   in   numerous   studies   establishing   the   prevalence   of misophonia.   However,   the   measures   have   shown   limitations   in   meeting   the requirements of the Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN;  Mokkink, Terwee, Knol, et al., 2010; Mokkink, Terwee, Patrick, et al., 2010). This highlights the necessity for improved and more comprehensive tools to accurately measure and assess misophonia symptoms. More recently, new self-report measurement tools have been developed, including the Duke-Vanderbilt Misophonia Screening Questionnaire (Williams et al., 2022), the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (Rosenthal et al., 2021), and the S-Five (Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021), offering promising alternatives for future research and prevalence studies.

In this work we focus on the S-Five. To assess the complex experience of misophonia and its severity, Vitoratou et al. (2021) developed the Selective Sound Sensitivity   Syndrome   Scale   (S-Five)   using   the   responses   of   English-speaking population self-identifying with misophonia in four waves of sampling. The S-Five identified five aspects of misophonic experience, namely i) externalising appraisals , which represents the feelings of blame and judgement for experiencing negative responses   to   sounds   that   are   directed   towards   other   people,   ii) internalising appraisals , when the judgement and blame is directed towards oneself, iii) impact , which describes perceived restrictions to functioning due to reactions to sounds, iv) threat , feeling of distress (about emotions escalating) around triggering sounds, and v) outburst , which include the presence or fear of having physical or verbal explosion in response to some sounds. The questionnaire underwent further psychometric

testing and was shown to have satisfactory psychometric properties with respect to reliability (stability and internal consistency), convergent validity, and measurement invariance. With respect to the responses to triggering sounds, the S-Five comes with  a   supplementary   checklist,   the   S-Five-T,   which   allows   for   investigations   of specific reactions and their intensity to certain sounds. For instance, Vitoratou, UglikMarucha, Hayes, Erfanian, et al. (2021)  reported that people self-identifying with misophonia were more than 40 and 20 times more likely to be triggered by eating sounds and breathing sounds, respectively. The S-Five and the S-Five-T can also be used to investigate mechanisms and response to change to intervention or treatment with respect to the five dimensions of misophonia. Incorporated into research, it can provide insight into understanding the correlates of specific facets of misophonia with other conditions or into longitudinal changes in the severity of symptoms. The fivefactor structure of the S-Five was further replicated in a large sample representative of the UK population, demonstrating excellent psychometric properties (Vitoratou et al., 2023). The robustness of the factor structure of the S-Five is further evidenced through its replications across different languages and cultures, namely in German (Remmert et al., 2022) and Chinese (Vitoratou et al., 2022) populations.

There have been only two measures of misophonia available in the Polish language, namely MisoQuest  (Siepsiak, Śliwerski, et al., 2020)  and Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014). MisoQuest was the first scale in misophonia literature   with   published   full   psychometric   evaluation   in   a   peer-reviewed   journal, whose   properties   were   assessed   in   the   Polish   population.   MisoQuest   is   a unidimensional   measure   for   identifying   the   presence   of   misophonia   defined according to a very specific and narrow criteria, developed by Schröder et al. (2013) (which were later revised by Jager et al., 2020), with minor modifications applied by authors.  For  instance,   the   diagnostic   criteria   for   misophonia   by   Schroder   et   al. include the presence of spontaneous and aversive reaction to sounds produced by humans only, while MisoQuest assesses for the presence of all ranges of sounds, both   human   and   non-human.   The   scale   has   demonstrated   good   validity   and reliability (Siepsiak, Śliwerski, et al., 2020), very high specificity but limited sensitivity (Enzler et al., 2021; Siepsiak, Sobczak, et al., 2020). Importantly, it was neither developed to measure the severity of misophonia symptoms nor developed using a multidimensional   reflective   latent   variables   model.   Furthermore,   the   MisoQuest

detects   the   presence   of   misophonia   when   the   aversive   emotional   response   is immediate. Individuals who only react negatively to a prolonged exposure to external stimuli would not be identified; however, those diagnosed would constitute a more homogenous group. MisoQuest is thus a useful tool for screening for misophonia when Schröder et al. (2013) criteria are applied.

MQ was developed   to   assess   misophonia   symptoms   in   three   sections, investigating the symptoms sensitivity (MSYS), person's behaviours and emotions (MEBS), and the severity of the symptoms (MEBS). MQ has been translated to Polish   and   its   psychometric   properties   are   currently   evaluated   as   a   part   of   an unpublished study. The original English version has shown satisfactory internal consistency  (Wu et al.,   2014).   Although   the   full   psychometric   properties   of   the English scale have not been published, it has been recently validated for use in Norway  (Larsen   et   al.,   2022),   Turkey (Sakarya   &amp;   Çakmak,   2022) and   Iran (Mehrabizadeh Honarmand &amp; Roushani, 2019). Despite this, MQ has been the most widely used questionnaire for the assessment of misophonia (Cusack et al., 2018; Janik McErlean &amp; Banissy, 2018; McKay et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2017). Notably, the MSES, which is frequently used as a cut-off score to create groups with and without misophonia, was developed on the basis of items assessing obsessive-compulsive disorder   severity   and,   to   our   knowledge,   has   not   been   validated   as   a   tool   to discriminate between those with and without misophonia.

In Poland, the notable barrier in misophonia research has been a limited possibility   to   compare   the   data   collected   in   the   Polish   population   with   the   data collected by other researchers across the world. Furthermore, to our knowledge, there   has   been   no   measurement   tool   available   in   the   Polish   language   for   a multidimensional assessment of the severity of the misophonic experience. In light of this, the aim of this study was to translate the S-Five into Polish language and validate it in the population of Polish-speaking individuals, both those who selfidentify with having the condition and those who do not. The Polish version of the SFive   would   supplement   the   assessment   of   misophonia   in   Polish-speaking populations in both therapeutic and research context and address the barriers in cross-cultural research of misophonia by allowing for international investigations.

In   accordance   with   the   findings   by Vitoratou,   Uglik-Marucha,   Hayes,   &amp; Gregory (2021) in English-speaking population, it was hypothesised that:

- 1. The five-factor structure of S-Five will be replicated in the Polish sample,
- 2. The S-Five will demonstrate satisfactory psychometric properties with respect to   internal   consistency,   test-retest   reliability,   measurement   invariance   with respect to gender adjusted for age, and convergent validity with MisoQuest and MQ and its subscales (except for MSYS),
- 3. The S-Five will emerge weakly to moderately correlated with depression and anxiety.

## Methods

## Study overview

Participants were recruited between December 2021 and March 2022 through groups on social media sites relating to misophonia, namely Facebook ('Mizofonicy' group), Reddit (r/misophonia), and Twitter (#misophonia, #mizofonia). The survey was administered via Qualtrics. Before proceeding with the study, participants were provided with a participants' information sheet and consent of participation was established (ethics approval reference RESCM-19/20-11,826). Inclusion criteria for participation included being aged 18 years and over and Polish fluency. Participants who indicated the presence of severe intellectual and/or learning disability at the beginning of the survey were automatically excluded from continuing with the study. At the end of the survey, participants were asked about the participation in a retest study, which involved entering their e-mail addresses in a separate survey to avoid linking   their   responses   with   their   contact   information.   Those   who   agreed   to participate in the retest survey were contacted again three weeks after the initial assessment. An Amazon voucher of £20 pounds was offered for one in twenty participants as a lucky draw to encourage participation.

The online survey included the S-Five and other measures for validity and hypothesis testing purposes (please see below for details on the battery used). The items of S-Five and the blocks of the remaining questionnaires were presented to the participants in random order. Throughout the survey, attention check questions were administered   allowing   for   screening   of   the   data   for   low-quality   responses. Demographic   characteristics   were   collected,   such   as   age,   gender,   occupation, education level, and country of birth and residence. Participants were asked to report any formal diagnoses they may have received of mental health conditions (affective, anxiety,   personality,   trauma,   psychotic,   substance   abuse   and   eating   disorders), neurodevelopmental   conditions   (autism,   dyslexia,   ADHD),   and   audiological conditions (hyperacusis, tinnitus, auditory processing disorder).

Translation process

The translation process followed a framework outlined by the Oxford University Innovation (Wild et al., 2005). This process took the following steps:

- 1. Forward translation of the  English version  of the  S-Five   into   Polish   was performed simultaneously by two independent researchers (NUM &amp; JZ) to produce two translations. Both NUM and JZ are bilingual with Polish as their mother tongue. One of the translators (NUM) acted as a subject expert due to being   a   co-author   of   the   original   S-Five,   thus   ensuring   that   misophonia intricacies were not missed.
- 2. Reconciliation   of   forward   translations   was   achieved   by   comparing   and merging the two Polish versions by NUM and JZ. The discrepancies in translations   were   discussed   and   resolved   with   an   independent   bilingual translator with Polish as their native language (AT). This step resulted in a preliminary Polish version of the S-Five.
- 3. Back-translation of the Polish version of the S-Five to English was performed independently by two bilingual researchers (MS &amp; WD) with Polish as their mother tongue, who were not involved in the previous exercise. The two researchers were subject experts on misophonia.
- 4. Reconciliation   of   back-translation   was   conducted   by   SV   and   JG,   original developers of the S-Five, by comparing the two back-translated versions with the source text. In this step, minor discrepancies were identified with respect to 4 items, which were discussed between NUM, JZ, and MS to reach a consensus on a final version of items. This led to minor revisions, which were reported back to SV and JG for the approval, and thus resulting in the final translated Polish version of the S-Five.
- 5. Testing   of   the   translated   questionnaire   was   performed   on   the   Polish population self-identifying with having misophonia. In the survey, a space was provided for the participants to provide feedback on the translated items.

## Measures

The S-Five (Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021)  is a selfreport scale which consists of 25 items, are rated on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all true) to 10 (completely true), with a total score range of 0-250. There are

five factors with five items each, with a score range of 0-50 for each of the following domains: externalising appraisals, internalising appraisals,   perceived   emotional threat , outbursts , and impact on functioning. Please see Table A1 in Appendix for both English and Polish items and Additional File for fillable form with automatic scoring in a pdf format.

A supplementary S-Five trigger checklist (S-Five-T) consists of 37 trigger sounds. Respondents select their main response to each sound from the following options: no feeling , irritation , distress , disgust , anger , panic , other feeling: negative , other feeling: positive ,   and physiological reaction. The latter option was recently added in the German validation of the S-Five (Remmert et al., 2022), and was also used in the present study. The intensity of the selected reaction is then rated on an 11-point scale from 0 (does not bother me at all) to 10 (unbearable/causes suffering). The checklist results in four summary indices: trigger count (TC; the number of triggers   endorsed),   reaction   count   (RC;   the   number   of   times   each   reaction   is endorsed across all triggers), frequency/intensity of reactions score (FIRS; the total score for the intensity items across all endorsed triggers), and relative intensity of reactions score (RIRS; intensity of reactions relative to the number of triggers). The original and Polish items are presented in Table A2 in the Appendix.

## Other measures

The MisoQuest (Siepsiak,   Śliwerski,   et   al.,   2020)  is   a   self-report   measure   of misophonia validated in a sample of Polish-speaking participants that was developed around the diagnostic criteria proposed by Schröder et al. (2013). The questionnaire is   a   unidimensional   tool   consisting   of   14   items,   which   are   rated   on   a   1   to   5 agreement scale. In this study, MisoQuest had both Cronbach's alpha (α) and McDonald's omega (ω) of 0.91.

The Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014) is a self-report questionnaire consisting  of   34   items   that   form   three   parts.   The   Misophonia   Symptoms   Scale (MSYS) measures the sensitivity to a specific trigger when compared to others, and

the Misophonia Emotions and Behaviours Scale (MEBS) assesses for emotional and behavioural responses to trigger sounds. Both parts are rated on a 5-point ordinal scale, which are combined to form the MQ total score. The third part, the Misophonia Severity Scale (MSES) is a single-item question that measures the severity of sound sensitivity on a 15-point scale, where 1 indicates minimal and 15 suggests very severe sensitivity. A score of 7 or above on the MSES is proposed to indicate clinical levels of misophonia. The MQ was translated by MS as a part of another, yet unpublished study. In the present study, the subscales of MQ had both α and ω of 0.74 and 0.85 for MSYS and MEBS, respectively. Cronbach's α for the total scale was 0.84 and ω was 0.83.

The Patient   Health   Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9;  Kroenke et  al.,   2001)  is   a   brief measure of the severity of depression. The tool includes 9 items that are rated on a 4-point ordinal scale that form a total score ranging from 0 to 27. PHQ-9 has been validated for the use in Polish, and such a version was used in this study (Kokoszka et al., 2016). In this study, the measure had an α and ω of 0.84.

The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7;  Spitzer et al., 2006)  screens and measures the severity of generalised anxiety disorder. GAD-7 has 7 items and uses a 4-point ordinal scale, which are summed to create a total score for all items (0 to 21). The Polish version of GAD-7 has not been psychometrically validated. In this study, the GAD-7 demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency, with both α and ω of 0.83, respectively.

The Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3; Taylor et al., 2007) is a self-report measure of anxiety sensitivity, that is, concerns regarding anxiety symptoms. ASI-3 consists of 18 items forming 3 subscales, with responses rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (very little) to 4 (very much). The three subscales measure the physical, cognitive, and social concerns about anxiety. All items are summed to create ASI-3 total (0 to 72) and the sum of items consisting of each subscale provides a subscale score (0 to 24). A Polish version that was validated in the Polish population was used in this study (Michałowski et al., 2014). The cognitive and physical subscales had both α and ω of 0.90 and 0.87, respectively and social subscale had an α and ω of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively. The entire measure demonstrated α and ω of 0.92.

## Statistical analysis

## Dimensionality

The psychometric analysis followed the Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used for evaluation of the structure of the scale. The amenability of a correlation matrix to factoring was evaluated using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy (KMO of ≥0.90 suggests suitability; Kaiser, 1960; Kaiser &amp; Rice, 1974)  and  the   Bartlett's   test   of   sphericity   (significant   difference   between   the correlation matrix and the identity matrix indicates amenability to factoring; Bartlett, 1951). To account for skewed continuous data, the maximum likelihood estimator with robust standard errors MLR was used  (Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998-2017). Two common factor selection procedures were employed, the Kaiser-Guttman criterion (Guttman, 1954; Kaiser, 1960) and parallel analysis (Horn, 1965).  The first suggests retaining the number of factors that correspond to the number of eigenvalues of the sample correlation matrix that are greater than one. Parallel analysis compares the number of sample eigenvalues with the mean of eigenvalues generated from 50 random samples of the same size and number of variables. The number of factors to be retained corresponds to the number of eigenvalues larger than the average eigenvalues from the random data.

The solutions suggested by the Kaiser-Guttman criterion and parallel analysis were compared with plus minus one factor solutions to evaluate which solution is most interpretable (Lim &amp; Jahng, 2019). Several goodness of fit indices were used to evaluate proposed solutions. The absolute fit of the model was assessed using relative χ , the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; Browne &amp; Cudeck, 2 1992; Steiger &amp; Lind, 1980 cited in Steiger, 1990) and its 90% confidence interval (90% CI), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). Fit relative to a null model was evaluated using the comparative fit index (CFI; Bentler, 1990) and the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI; Tucker &amp; Lewis, 1973). Guidelines for close fit provided in Hu &amp; Bentler (1999) and Ullman (2006) were followed with the following criteria: relative χ 2 (≤ 2), RMSEA (≤ .05, 90% CI ≤ .06), SRMR (≤ .08), CFI (≥ .95), and TLI (≥ .95).

Item selection was based on the items' factor loadings, with loadings of at least 0.30 on the main factor identified as a meaningful indicator of a latent construct and to be retained  (Brown, 2015). Items with loadings below 0.3 and/or crossloadings on other factors (λ≥ 0.25) were considered redundant.

To obtain accurate estimates for factor solutions, the ratio of the participants to the number of measured indicators was considered  (Kyriazos, 2018). For this study, 25 items were used in dimensionality investigations, which requires 250 cases for EFA alone. The study's sample (N=288) was sufficient for EFA but did not allow for further dimensionality explorations using confirmatory factor analysis.

## Exploratory Graph Analysis

In   addition   to   those   traditional   factor   reduction   methods,   a   new   method derived from the network psychometrics framework was conducted to assess the dimensionality underlying the data and to evaluate the stability of the established factor structure. Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA; Golino &amp; Epskamp, 2017) was used to generate a visual guide-network plot that depicts relations between the items and factors. In these network models, nodes (circles) correspond to items, and the edges (lines) represent correlations between two items. The basis of the network structure is derived from a Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM; Lauritzen, 1996), which estimates an undirected network of partial correlation coefficients (Epskamp et al., 2018).   GGM   was   obtained   using   a   Graphical   Least   Absolute   Shrinkage   and Selection Operator (glasso; Friedman et al., 2008; Friedman et al., 2014) method, which directly penalizes and shrinks the partial correlation coefficients of the matrix, and   thus   protects   against   overfitting.   Glasso   employs   the   extended   Bayesian information criterion to retrieve model with best fit to the data. The number of factors in the network model is estimated using the walktrap algorithm  (Pons &amp; Latapy, 2006), which detects the number and content of distinct subcomponents of uniquely related nodes through the process of 'random walks' over the network.

The   stability   of   number   of   factors   and   the   robustness   of   each   item's placement within their assigned factors identified using EGA was investigated using bootstrap   exploratory   graph   analysis   (bootEGA; Christensen   &amp;   Golino,   2021). bootEGA assesses the factorial stability using structural consistency measure, which is the proportion of times each factor initially derived from EGA was replicated from the bootstrap samples. The non-parametric approach of bootEGA was used, which is recommended for skewed data, applies resampling with replacement technique to generate 1000 samples from the original dataset with the same number of cases. For  each   generated   sample,   a   network   is   estimated   and   walktrap   algorithm   is employed   to   create   a   sampling   distribution   of   networks.   Descriptive   statistics (median, standard error, 95% confidence intervals) on the number of identified factors, and the proportion of times a specific number of factors was estimated were computed across the replica of networks. Additionally, a median network plot of a sampling distribution of 1000 networks was generated, which depicts the most likely and stable factor structure identified in the data. The median network plot was compared with the initial EGA plot.

An additional measure to structural consistency is item stability, which calculates a proportion of times each item was present in each factor specified through EGA across the replica of networks. Items identified to replicate in their confirmatory factors   ≥80%   of   the   time   were   considered   stable   and   contributing   to   structural consistency, while the items with low proportions of replications (&lt; .80) were labelled as possibly problematic due to their multidimensional nature and leading to structural inconsistency.

## Measurement invariance

Measurement invariance investigations were employed to evaluate whether the S-Five can measure the underlying construct of misophonia equivalently across different   genders.   This   procedure   ensures   that   any   observed   score   differences between groups are genuine reflections of actual differences in the construct being measured, rather than being influenced by biases in the measurement tool itself. The measurement invariance of the tool was assessed using multiple indicators, multiple

causes model (MIMIC; Joreskog &amp; Goldberger, 1975; Muthén, 1979), which involves regressing the latent factors and indicators (items) onto a gender covariate. The direct   effects   of   gender   on   the   items   were   estimated.   A   significant   direct   effect signifies measurement-noninvariance (bias) of that item; that is, when the levels of misophonia are held constant, gender alone influences the probability of endorsing a particular item. The analysis was adjusted for age.

## Reliability

The internal consistency of the S-Five was assessed using Cronbach's alpha (α; Cronbach, 1951) and McDonald's omega (ω; McDonald, 1999) within each factor. While α is the most used measure of reliability, Cronbach's α produces incorrect estimates of internal consistency except in scarce conditions when all factor loadings are of equal magnitude within a scale and no correlated residuals are present (Sijtsma,   2009).   Thus,   ω   coefficient   is   additionally   computed   as   model-based estimates of internal consistency are favoured (Revelle &amp; Condon, 2019). Guidelines for  internal   consistency coefficients vary and range from 0.70 to 0.95  (DeVellis, 2003; Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994) but in this study we follow the guidelines outlined by Nunnally (1978) that recommend a value of ≥0.80 for research scales. As a part of internal consistency investigations, additional indices were investigated for each item, namely corrected item-total correlations (ITC), average inter-item correlations (IIC), and alpha/omega if item deleted (AID/OID). For ITC and IIC, the acceptable range of correlation considered was 0.2 to 0.8. Items with values of AID/OID higher than alpha/omega for the total subscale are decreasing the reliability of the scale and were thus labelled as problematic.

The stability of the items and scales across time (test-retest reliability) was assessed   using   the   mixed   effects,   absolute   agreement   intraclass   correlation coefficient (ICC;  Shrout &amp; Fleiss, 1977)  and the Psi Non-Parametric Concordance Coefficient (Psi; Kuiper &amp; Hoogenboezem, 2019). Landis &amp; Koch (1977) guidelines were   followed   for   interpreting   the   results,   where   evidence   towards   very   good agreement was granted with values &gt;0.81, good agreement was indicated by values ranging between 0.61 to 0.80, moderate agreement was demonstrated for values of

0.41 to 0.60, fair agreement was evidenced with values of 0.21-0.40, and values indicating poor agreement were &lt;0.20.

## Validity

The concurrent convergent validity of the S-Five was tested by assessing correlations with pre-existing measures of misophonia, namely MisoQuest and MQ. In   comparison,   discriminant   validity   was   evaluated   through   associations   with   a subscale   of   MQ   (MSYS,   sensitivity   to   specific   triggers   in   comparison   to   other people), which although related to misophonia, is not measured by the S-Five. To establish   convergent   validity,   the   S-Five   and   its   subscales   should   be   at   least modestly   correlated   with   MisoQuest   and   MQ.   Discriminant   validity   should   be determined through weak correlations with MSYS subscale of MQ.

All   statistical   analyses   were   performed   using   R   version   1.31093  (R   Core Team, 2020), M plus 8 (Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1998-2017) and SPSS version 28.0 (IBM Corp, 2021)  Exploratory  factor  analysis   was   run   in  M plus via MplusAutomation package  (Hallquist &amp; Wiley, 2018)  in R and the results of parallel analysis were depicted using ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016). EGA and bootEGA were conducted using the R package EGAnet (Golino et al.,   2020),   which   makes   use   of   the qgraph (Epskamp   et   al.,   2012)  to   visualise   the   network   models.   Test-retest   reliability analysis was run in the R package nopaco (Kuiper &amp; Hoogenboezem, 2019)  and internal consistency analysis was conducted in SPSS.

## Results

## Demographic characteristics of the sample

The study included 288 participants from the Polish population (99% were born in Poland), of which 81.3% ( n =234) self-identified as having misophonia, 13.1% ( n =13) did not and 8.7% ( n =25) was not sure (5.6%, n =16 missing). Among the participants, 231 (80.2%) were women, including 2 (0.7%) who identified as trans women; 38 (13.2%) were men, including 17 (6.3%) who identified as trans men; and 19 (6.6%) identified as non-binary/other. The participants' ages ranged from 18 to 59 years   old,   with   a   mean   age   of   30.15   (standard   deviation,   SD=8.39).   The characteristics of the participants' highest level of education was as follows: lower secondary education ( n =5, 1.7%), secondary education ( n =87, 30.2%), vocational education   ( n =4,   1.4%),   post-secondary   non-tertiary   education   ( n =20,   6.9%), Bachelor's degree ( n =66, 22.9%), Master's degree ( n =99, 34.4%), and Doctoral degree ( n =7, 2.4%).

The most frequently self-reported mental health diagnoses were depression ( n =64,   22.2%)   and   generalized   anxiety   disorder   ( n =44,   15.3%).   In   terms   of audiological   diagnoses,   18   (6.3%)   participants   reported   having   a   diagnosis   of tinnitus, 16 (5.6%) of hyperacusis, and 2 (0.7%) of auditory processing disorder.

For test-retest purposes, a subset of 68 participants was re-administered the S-Five three weeks after the initial assessment. This subsample had a mean age of 29 (SD=7.5), with 56 (82.4%) identifying as women. Missingness in the trigger sections of the S-Five ranged from 2.1% to 4.2%, and listwise deletion was used, resulting in 47 participants for the test-retest analysis of S-Five-T.

## S-Five: Statements

## a) Dimensionality

The   data   were   first   evaluated   with   respect   to   their   suitability   for   factor analysis, which revealed amenability to factoring (KMO=0.91; Bartlett's test χ   = 2 3748.40, df=300, p&lt;0.001). Oblimin-rotated EFA was conducted on all twenty-five

items. Five eigenvalues were above 1 (9.014, 2.453, 1.721, 1.619, 1.417) in the sample correlation matrix, suggesting up to five factors to be retained according to the Kaiser-Guttman criterion, explaining the 64.9% of the total variance. Parallel analysis also indicated that the five-factor structure was suitable to the data (see Figure   1).   The   intercorrelations   among   the   five   factors   ranged   from   0.20 (externalising-internalising)   to   0.49   (impact-threat).   The-five   factor   structure   had close fit to the data (relative χ  = 1.70, RMSEA [90% CI] = 0.05 [0.04, 0.06], CFI = 2 0.96, TLI = 0.93, SRMR = 0.03). The factor loading estimates indicated that all items were strongly related to their corresponding factors (λ range =0.34-0.84; please see Table 1 for loadings). Salient cross-loadings (λ &gt;0.25) were not present for any item. The   intercorrelations   among   the   five   factors   ranged   from   0.20   (externalisinginternalising)   to   0.49   (impact-threat).   Each   factor   consisted   of   five   items   that conceptually   corresponded   to   the   original   model   identified   by  Vitoratou,   UglikMarucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory (2021). Solutions with fewer factors did not emerge close fit to the data and increasing the number of factors resulted in factors whose items had non-salient loadings.

The dimensionality of the S-Five was further investigated using EGA, which also concluded to 5 dimensions (Figure 2) whose items correspond to the theoretical factors identified by Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory (2021).

Figure 2. EGA (left) and bootstrap EGA's median network (right) for the S-Five model. Dimension 1 (red) relates to internalising appraisals,  dimension  2  (light green)   relates   to   outburst,   dimension   3   (dark   green)   corresponds   to   threat, dimension 4 (blue) relates to impact on life, and dimension 5 (violet) indicates externalising appraisals.

The stability and reproducibility of this factor structure was evaluated using the dimension stability function of bootstrap EGA (bootEGA) for 1000 iterations. The median network structure (Figure 2) consisted of 5 dimensions and was identical to the empirical EGA. 5-factor structure was stable across 1000 bootstrapped samples (median=5, SE=0.29, and 95% CI [4.43, 5.57]). The frequency of factorial solutions derived from bootEGA across all replica of networks was computed, which showed that   the   five   factor   structure   was   replicated   the   most   (919   times   out   of   1000 samples). While bootEGA identified 4, 6, and 7 factors to be present across all 1000 bootstrap   replicate   samples,   these   were   only   replicated   25,   56,   and   1   time respectively. Further stability checks were conducted by assessing stability of each dimension individually to see how frequently each of the initial EGA factors (identical item allocation) is reproduced across replica of networks. Dimensions 4 and 5 were the   most   stable,   with   94%   and   100%   proportion   of   times   when   identical   item arrangement was replicated, respectively. Dimensions 1, 2, and 3 were less stable and were reproduced 59%, 62% and 66% times, respectively.

Items were assessed for their stability of placement in each designated factor in the bootstrapped samples (please see Figure 3). All but three items (thr_S502, out_S524, int_S512) had high proportion of times (≥ .80) they were replicated in 1000 bootstrap samples in the confirmatory dimensions, indicating that these items are stable and consistently identified in their theoretical factors. Items thr_S502, out_S524,   and   int_S512   had   relatively   low   proportions   (&lt;   .80)   of   replications, indicating that these items could be considered unstable. These unstable items were further investigated to evaluate which additional dimensions they were replicating on (please see Table 2 for item stability values for all items). Item int_S512 from the Internalising dimension was replicated in its corresponding dimension in 614 out of 1000 bootstrapped samples, but also 213 times on Outburst factor and 122 times on Threat factor. With respect to out_S524, it replicated on its theoretical dimension in 621 samples and 198 times on Internalising and 128 times on Threat factors. Item from the Threat factor (thr_S502) replicated on its own confirmatory dimension 662 times. However, it was also replicated in the Internalising dimension (91 times) and Outburst (219 times). Although these items do correspond to their theoretical factors, they   overlap   conceptually   with   other   factors,   which   is   an   indication   of   their complexity.

Replication

Proportion   of   times   each   item   was   replicated   in   their   designated dimensions   across   1000   bootstrapped   samples.   1   (red)   signifies   internalising appraisals, 2 (blue) corresponds to outburst, 3 (green) indicates threat, 4 (orange) refers to impact on life, and 5 (yellow) signifies externalising appraisals.

## Measurement invariance

A MIMIC model was fitted to evaluate whether the probability of endorsing an item is influenced by gender adjusted for age. Significant directs effects of gender were found on 4 items, namely imp_S501 ('Do not meet friends'), imp_S514 ('Avoid places'), out_S523 ('Shout at people'), and thr_S510 ('Experience distress'). At any given value of misophonia, women scored 1.08 and 0.95 units higher on out_S523 and thr_S510 respectively (on a scale of 0 to 10) than men. Men were more likely to endorse imp_S501 and imp_S514, that is, they scored 1.27 and 1.33 units higher respectively than women while controlling for the level of misophonia. The remaining 21 items of the S-Five were measurement invariant, that is non-biased with respect

to gender (adjusted for age). The direct effects of gender on these four items were negligible, thus allowing comparison of the S-Five scores between women and men. Women scored significantly higher on the S-Five total score and its three subscales (internalising, threat, outburst) compared to men (see Table 4).

## Reliability

Test-retest reliability at item level indicated very good agreement for both Psi and ICC (please see Table 1). Internal  consistency   within   each   subscale   was satisfactory according to McDonald's omega (ω=0.82-0.92) and Cronbach's alpha (α=0.81-0.87). Further internal consistency investigations with respect to average IIC, ITC, AID, and OID revealed all items to exhibit values within acceptable range.

## Validity

Moderate   to   strong   correlations   were   found   between   the   S-Five   and   its subscales and MisoQuest, indicating concurrent convergent validity of the scale (refer   to   Table   3).   Additionally,   evidence   of   concurrent   convergent   validity   was supported by moderate to strong correlations between the S-Five and MQ, as well as its   MSES   and   MEBS   subscales.   On   the   other   hand,   weak   correlations   were observed between four S-Five factors (except for impact) and MSYS subscale,

suggesting distinctiveness of the misophonia aspects measured by these scales. Impact had moderate correlation with MSYS.

The S-Five subscales, with the exception of externalizing, displayed weak to moderate correlations   with   depression.   Notably,   the   externalizing   factor   did   not exhibit any significant associations with depression. A moderate correlation was observed   between   S-Five   total   and   its   internalizing   subscale   with   anxiety   as assessed by GAD-7. In contrast, the remaining subscales were weakly associated with  anxiety,   particularly   the   externalizing   factor.   Furthermore,   anxiety   sensitivity (ASI-3) and its social and cognitive factors showed moderate correlations with the internalizing factor of S-Five, while very weak correlation was observed with the physical factor. As for the other S-Five factors, ASI-3 and its social and cognitive factors exhibited very weak associations with them excluding the externalising factor, which exhibited no correlations with any of the ASI-3 subscales. Total S-Five had very weak correlation with physical subscale of ASI-3.

With respect to reactions to triggers, none of the S-Five subscales correlated with irritation , negative and physiological reactions.   Externalising   factor   only correlated with anger . The remaining factors had associations with distress , anger , panic and were negatively related to no feeling .    Outburst factor was additionally negatively associated with disgust and positive reactions .   The   total   S-Five score emerged   positively   correlated   with distress , anger and panic ,   and   negatively correlated with no feeling and disgust .

## S-Five: Triggers

## Stability

With   respect   to   test-retest   reliability   of   the   reaction   counts   (RC),   all   RCs demonstrated   good   to   very   good   agreement   ranging   from   0.74   ( physiological reaction )   to   0.91 (no feeling) with respect to Psi. ICC values ranged from 0.84 ( physiological reaction ) to 0.91 ( no feeling ), also indicating very good agreement in time. Psi coefficients for RIRS, FIRS and TC were very good (&gt;0.86) and ICC also indicated very good agreement (&gt;0.88). With respect to the intensity trigger sounds, Psi ranged from 0.74 (footsteps) to 0.91 (muffled sounds, baby crying) indicating good to very good agreement, ICC values showed very good agreement (0.83-0.90) for all sounds.

## Reaction counts

No feeling was on average the most frequently reported reaction. Specifically, an average of 12 out of 37 trigger sounds did not evoke any reactions, followed by irritation (10 out of 37) and anger (6 out of 37).  With respect to differences in scores, women scored significantly higher on the negative RC than men whilst men had significantly higher score on no feeling RC.

Distress , anger, panic emerged weakly correlated with MisoQuest and MQ and all its subscales. Additionally, MQ had very weak negative correlations with positive reaction. MSYS was also moderately associated with irritation ,   whereas MEBS emerged negatively and very weakly correlated with disgust . The measures of depression and anxiety were only weakly correlated with distress and panic. All subscales of ASI-3 had a weak association with disgust and all but physical subscale had weak correlations with panic .

All S-Five subscales were weakly to moderately correlated with FIRS and RIRS and all with the exception of externalising subscale correlated weakly with TC. MisoQuest and MQ, the other measures of misophonia, were weakly to strongly associated   with   FIRS,   RIRS,   and   TC.   Depression   and   anxiety   were   weakly correlated with TC and FIRS, while anxiety only showed a very weak association with RIRS. TC and FIRS had weak correlations with all ASI-3 subscales, while RIRS had no significant correlations with any ASI-3 subscales.

## Intensity

Descriptive indices for intensity of sounds are presented in Table 6 and mean intensity of each trigger sound is represented in Figure 4.  The sounds for which the highest   intensity   of   reactions   was   evoked   include   lip   smacking,   loud   chewing, chewing gum, slurping,   snoring,   loud/unusual   breathing,   crunching,   and   normal eating   sounds.   The   lowest   intensity   was   reported   for   yawning,   certain   words, footsteps, sneezing, and repetitive engine noises. Women had significantly higher intensity of reactions on sound of clipping nails, swallowing, lip smacking, normal breathing, loud unusual breathing, repetitive coughing, repetitive sniffing, snoring, chewing gum, slurping, muffled sounds, throat clearing, clock ticking, crunching, teeth sucking.

Figure 5 illustrates the percentages of participants selecting each of nine emotional reactions to 37 triggers. 'Repetitive engine noises' (78.8%), 'footsteps' (67.6%), and 'sneezing' (66.2%) were selected the most frequently as eliciting no feeling . On the other hand, triggers such as sound of 'tapping' (48.2%), 'repetitive barking'   (45.5%),   and   'loud/unusual   breathing'   (39.2%)   predominantly   evoked irritation .   'Snoring'   (13.1%),   'lip   smacking'   (10.8%)   and   'slurping'   (8.6%)   were selected most frequently as causing distress , while sounds such as 'kissing' (27%), 'mushy foods' (23.9%), and 'chewing gum loudly' (23%) most often elicited disgust . The triggers that predominantly induced anger were 'lip smacking' (45.9%), 'slurping' (38.3%), and 'loud chewing' (37.4%). For panic ,   'lip   smacking' (13.1%), 'chewing gum loudly' (9.9%), 'loud chewing' (8.1%) were selected most frequently. 'Certain accents' (11.7%), 'certain letter sounds' (10.8%), 'snoring' (9.5%) were reported the most frequently to cause other negative emotions whilst 'repetitive engine noises' (5%), 'keyboard tapping' (4.5%), 'clock ticking' (4.5%) were selected most often as eliciting other positive emotions . Finally, physiological reactions were evoked most frequently by 'cutlery noises' (3.6%) and 'rustling plastic or paper' (2.7%).

## Discussion

The main objective of this study was to translate and validate the Polish version of the S-Five, a comprehensive questionnaire for assessing misophonia symptoms' severity. The results confirmed the five-factor structure of the S-Five in the Polish-speaking population, consisting of both individuals with and without selfidentified misophonia, consistent with studies in English-speaking (Vitoratou, UglikMarucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021), German (Remmert et al., 2022), and Chinese populations  (Vitoratou et al., 2022). The factor structure's robustness was further supported through the satisfactory stability of each subscale of the S-Five, that is, they are very likely to reproduce in other samples. Additionally, the questionnaire exhibited strong psychometric properties, including reliability, internal consistency, gender-related   measurement   invariance,   and   validity,   replicating   findings   from previous research.

## Are the five dimensions of misophonia stable and generalisable?

The study successfully replicated the five theoretical factors ( externalising appraisals, internalising appraisals, threat , impact ,   and outburst )   of   the   S-Five questionnaire in the Polish population, highlighting the cross-cultural validity of using the   S-Five   to   measure   misophonia.   To   investigate   the   factor   structure   more thoroughly, a novel method called bootEGA was employed to examine the stability of these misophonic dimensions and their item allocations across  1000 simulated samples (known as bootstrapped samples) from the original dataset. The five-factor structure   was   replicated   with   a   high   frequency   (92%   of   the   time),   making   the dimensions of the S-Five generalizable to other samples. This was further supported by successful replications of the five factors in representative sample of the UK population (Vitoratou et al., 2023), German (Remmert et al., 2022) and Mandarinspeaking Chinese (Vitoratou et al., 2022) populations.

Among the five aspects of misophonic experience assessed by the S-Five questionnaire, externalizing appraisals and impact factors demonstrated the highest structural   consistency.   This   means   that   the   items   belonging   to   these   factors consistently grouped together in the same dimensions. Specifically, all externalizing

items were allocated to their factor 100% of the time. The remaining factors were also stable, but to a lesser extent, with the internalizing factor showing the lowest structural consistency.

The stability issues with the internalizing dimension were mainly due to one specific item: 'I feel like I must be a very angry person inside because of the way I react   to   certain   sounds.'   This   item   shared   some   conceptual   similarity   with   the outburst factor,   and   at   times,   it   replicated   on   the outburst factor   instead   of   its intended internalising factor. The item's focus on feelings of anger, rather than lack of respect or self-dislike, possibly explained its overlap with the outburst factor. The exploratory factor analysis also reflected this finding, as the item had the weakest association with its main factor compared to the other internalising items.

Regarding the outburst factor,   one   item-'I   am   afraid   I   will   do   something aggressive or violent   because   I   cannot   stand   the   noise   someone   is   making'occasionally replicated on both the internalising and threat dimensions. The first part of the item suggested a fear of emotions escalating, characteristic of the threat factor,   while   its   association   with   the internalising factor   indicated   worries   about potential outbursts, leading to intrusive thoughts or heightened anxiety. This item was also found to be the least meaningful indicator of the outburst factor. These issues align with a study by Remmert et al. (2022), which identified misspecifications in   the   original   S-Five   model   relating   to outburst .   Remmert   et   al.   proposed   an alternative bifactor model that offers a clearer interpretation of the physical and verbal aspects of outbursts, which could 0potentially improve the item's association with its intended outburst factor.

Finally, one item from the threat factor-'If I cannot get away from certain noises, I am afraid I might panic or feel like I will explode'-shared some conceptual similarity with the outburst dimension. This item was the only one from its original factor that emphasized a fear of explosion, which aligns with the element of the outburst   factor   about   being   afraid   of   doing   something   aggressive,   while   the remaining items in the threat factor focused on feelings of distress and helplessness when unable to avoid triggers.

These findings revealed the presence of three multidimensional items (out of 25 items) in the S-Five, which measured concepts from their intended theoretical dimensions while also showing some conceptual overlap with other aspects of misophonic experience. While these three items were found to be psychometrically sound for use in the S-Five, they could benefit from alterations to improve the stability of their respective dimensions.

The   secondary   goal   of   the   study   was   to   describe   characteristics   of misophonia triggers, as well as the emotional and behavioural reactions to triggers, in relationship to each other, five aspects of misophonic symptoms (reflected by the five scales of the S-Five), and to the severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms. The results are consistent with the previous studies, contributing to the need for the re-evaluation of understanding of the nature of misophonia. The most important findings   show   that   eating   sounds   tended   to   cause   the   most   intense   emotional reactions, and that misophonia symptoms were more associated with anger and panic, and not irritation or disgust. Another crucial discovery is that symptoms of anxiety and depression are differentially related to misophonia factors. There were moderate   correlations   between   symptoms   of   depression   and   anxiety   and internalising appraisals, and weaker or non-significant correlations with other factors.

## What trigger sounds are the most related to severity of misophonia symptoms?

In   the   study,   a   variety   of   possible   trigger   sounds   were   presented   to   the participants as a part of S-Five-T, both human and non-human. The mouth sounds, such as normal eating sounds, lip smacking, loud chewing, slurping or chewing gum loudly,   were   reported   as   those   evoking   the   most   intense   emotional   reactions. Interestingly,   repetitive   sounds   that   are   often   listed   among   misophonic   triggers (Rosenthal et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2014), such as repetitive engine noises, footsteps, or keyboard tapping, were among those that evoked the least intense reactions. In the other studies conducted in Europe with the use of S-Five (Remmert et al., 2022; Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021) similar observations were made. Meanwhile, in the study on the Chinese population  (Vitoratou et al., 2022)vother types   of   triggers   (for   instance,   baby   crying)   evoked   the   strongest   emotions. Nonetheless, due to some methodological differences (the proportions of misophonia

sufferers   in   the   sample),   this   intercultural discrepancy  should   be   treated   as preliminary   data,   and   verified   in   further   studies.   While   we   acknowledge   that according to the current understanding of misophonia and recent consensus (Swedo et al., 2022), misophonic triggers do not have to be necessarily human-made, the findings from this and other mentioned studies warrant further examination on the differences   in   experiencing   misophonia   triggered   by   human   vs.   other   repetitive sounds in future studies. For example, a recent study by  Siepsiak et al. (2022) showed that  the   prevalence   of   comorbid   psychiatric   disorders   was   significantly higher in the group of participants triggered by human oral sounds, than in those triggered by other, repetitive sounds.

It is worth to note that with respect to the listed sounds, no feeling was on average the most frequently reported response, which means that the participants were not triggered by the majority of the sounds from S-Five-T. This result supports the selective nature of misophonia.

What emotional, cognitive and behavioural responses are the most related to the severity of misophonia symptoms?

Despite   being   commonly   described   in   the   literature   as   one   of   the   most characteristic emotions in misophonia (Guetta et al., 2022; Kılıç et al., 2021; Rouw &amp; Erfanian,   2018;   A.   E.   Schröder   et   al.,   2017),   our   study   found   no   significant relationship   between   frequency   of   reporting   irritation   as   a   primary   response   to triggers, and any of the five factors in the S-Five questionnaire. Similarly, while disgust is often associated with misophonia (Savard et al., 2022), our study revealed that disgust was weakly and negatively related to only one subscale, namely the outburst, and the total score of the S-Five. Instead, our findings indicated a positive correlation between anger and all of the S-Five scales. Additionally, both distress and   panic   showed   positive   associations   with   all   S-Five   subscales,   except   for externalizing .   These   three   emotions   were   also   the   only   positively   correlated emotions with MisoQuest and MQ total. Similar to the S-Five, disgust showed only weak and negative associations with MisoQuest and MQ. These results are in line with German study (Remmert et al., 2022), where irritation was not related to any of the S-Five scales, and disgust was only weakly associated with internalising and

externalising scales. Interestingly, irritation correlated negatively with the total of SFive   in   the   original   study  (Vitoratou,   Uglik-Marucha,   Hayes,   &amp;   Gregory,   2021). Therefore, this study contributes to already notable evidence for the distinctive role of anger in misophonia, diminished the role of disgust, and demonstrated diagnostic insignificance   of   irritation   (reported   as   a   dominant   emotion)   in   misophonia. Importantly, the results from the current and other mentioned studies, are slightly different from the findings from the Chinese population (Vitoratou et al., 2022). In the Chinese study, although disgust was only weakly associated with threat sub scale, irritation correlated weakly to moderately with all of the S-Five scales, which suggest possible cultural differences with regards to irritation.

Participants obtained the highest average score on the threat subscale, which aligns with the findings from a study in the UK on individuals self-identifying with misophonia  (Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021). Notably, when examining samples from the general population using the S-Five, other studies report the highest average score on the externalising factor (Remmert et al., 2022; Vitoratou et al., 2022, 2023). This observation highlights the significant role of feeling distress (about emotions escalating) in response to triggering sounds in misophonia, rather than attributing blame to others, which may be common reaction to unpleasant sounds in the general population. Interestingly, our participants scored lowest on the impact subscale, a trend also observed in other samples from the general population (Remmert   et   al.,   2022;   Vitoratou   et   al.,   2022,   2023).   This   factor   captures   a perception of limitations caused by their reactions to sounds (for example, not seeing people you'd like to see). It could be that many individuals still participate in life, although perhaps with the use of coping strategies to enable them to do so. In contrast, a study on individuals self-identifying with misophonia  (Vitoratou, UglikMarucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021) reported the outburst subscale as the lowest on average. It's possible that this reflects a cultural difference, or that it reflects different sampling methods. In this study, although the majority of participants self-identified with having misophonia, we also had participants who did not have the condition, which could potentially influence this result.

When it comes to outburst reactions in response to trigger sounds, verbal aggression, shouting and fearing having an outburst were more highly rated than

physical   aggression   or   violence.   This   finding   is   consistent   with   similar   studies conducted in the UK (Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021), Germany (Remmert et al., 2022), China (Vitoratou et al., 2022), the Netherlands (Jager et al., 2020)  and previous studies in Poland  (Siepsiak, Śliwerski, et al., 2020), where physical aggression and violence were also infrequently reported in comparison to fears about resorting to violence. It's essential to distinguish between the fear of exploding and actual physical acts of violence. These results align with previous research, emphasizing that misophonia should not be portrayed as a violence issue, a misconception that can still occur, especially in mass media.

Another interesting result, in line with the previous studies  (Remmert et al., 2022), is the lack of relationship between self-reported physiological reactions and misophonia symptoms. While other studies have shown physiological reactions to sounds (Edelstein et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2017; Siepsiak, Vrana, et al., 2023), our findings suggest that when asked to select the main response to trigger sounds, they are more likely to identify an emotion than a physiological response. It's possible that this is because people recognise that their physiological reactions form part of their emotional reactions, or it is also possible that they do not tune into physiological component of their reactions. More research into this would be helpful, given that recognition and management of psychophysiological reactions became an important part of psychotherapeutic interventions (Lehrer, 2018).

What is the relationship between anger and types of attributions in misophonic reactions?

The   five-factor   structure   of   S-Five   indicates   that   misophonia   sufferers, although characterised by distinguishable reactions to particular trigger sounds, vary in specific features. First of all, attributions regarding one's misophonic reaction can be   made   either   externally,   as   other   people's   responsibility   or   blame   (here, externalising factor), or internally, as a self-blame (here, internalising subscale). As expected, the correlation between these two scales was weak (and the lowest), while both of these scales correlated strongly with the total of S-Five. Notably, anger correlated with all of the misophonia scales, including both of the appraisals scales. Anger had a higher correlation to internalising attributions than externalising. One

possibility for this is that one of the items in the internalising factor is about feeling like an angry person inside, and it makes sense that this appraisal would be related to increased experiences of anger to sounds. It would be interesting to examine these relationships experimentally to better understand the pattern of causality, for example   by   manipulating   the   attribution   appraisals   to   test   their   influence   on emotional   reactions.   Furthermore,   while   anger,   panic   or   disgust   were   already examined and discussed in misophonia literature, the significance of the feeling of guilt and self-blaming, related to internalising subscale, is still poorly understood and should be prioritised in further studies.

What   aspects   of   misophonia   are   and   are   not   related   to   symptoms   of psychopathology?

In   the   misophonia   literature,   it   has   been   already   well   established   that misophonia symptoms are related to anxiety and depressive symptoms (Erfanian et al., 2019; Jager et al., 2020; Quek et al., 2018; Rosenthal et al., 2022; Siepsiak et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2014). This study contributed to the knowledge of misophonia by highlighting   the   specific   dimensions   of   this   condition   are   differentially   related   to certain   symptoms   of   psychopathology.   The   findings   revealed   that   external attributions   were   neither   related   to   the   symptoms   of   depression   nor   to   anxiety sensitivity   and   were   only   weakly   related   to   the   symptoms   of   anxiety.   Internal attributions were moderately and positively related to symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as to cognitive and social anxiety sensitivity, and weakly to physical aspects of anxiety sensitivity. In previous studies, internalising factor was also in most cases more (moderately) related to depressive and anxiety symptoms than to externalising dimension  (Remmert et al., 2022; Vitoratou et al., 2022; Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes, &amp; Gregory, 2021).

We cannot make causal inferences about these associations; it is possible that feeling anxious and depressed can contribute to blaming oneself for reactions, or that the presence of these types of appraisals feeds into symptoms of depression and anxiety, or perhaps that cognitive and social anxiety sensitivity influence the relationship   between   appraisals   and   symptoms   of   depression   and   anxiety. Alternatively, an unmeasured variable may be fuelling all these traits and symptoms.

The rest of the scales were only weakly related to anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as anxiety sensitivity with no specific pattern emerging. The only exception was for the physical anxiety sensitivity, which was not related to the other subscales. Although anger, panic and distress were the emotions the most related to severity   of   misophonia   symptoms,   as   measured   by   all   the   three   misophonia questionnaires, only distress and panic were related to symptoms of depression and anxiety. These results again indicate the specific role of anger in misophonia, as one of the features of misophonia that distinguish it from other psychopathologies.

## Limitations

The sample primarily consisted of individuals referred from online misophonia support groups, but it also included individuals who did not self-identify as having the condition.   To   ensure   comprehensive   validation,   it   is   important   to   verify   the characteristics   of   the   S-Five   not   only   in   individuals   without   any   sound   overresponsivities but also in fully clinical samples. Additionally, the external validity of the   tool   should   be   assessed   through   face-to-face   diagnostic   interviews   for misophonia. Furthermore, the S-Five has not yet been tested for discriminative validity   with   respect   to   other   disorders   of   sound   intolerance,   namely   tinnitus   or hyperacusis.   Addressing   this   aspect   in   future   research   would   provide   valuable insights into the uniqueness of misophonia as compared to other sound-related conditions.   Moreover,   the   data   on   the   prevalence   of   comorbid   conditions   were derived from self-reported medical diagnoses, and thus should be interpreted with caution. Future studies would benefit from using structured clinical interviews to examine the relationship between misophonia and other disorders more thoroughly.

## Conclusions

This   study   successfully   validated   the   Polish   version   of   the   S-Five questionnaire,   confirming   its   five-factor   structure   and   robustness   in   measuring misophonia symptoms in the Polish-speaking population. The tool can be utilised in clinical practice   for   diagnostic   purposes   and   evaluating   psychotherapeutic

interventions, as well as in research, making it the first published tool in Polish to comprehensively assess misophonia severity with respect to its five components.

The study offers valuable insights into misophonia's nature, trigger sounds, emotional   responses,   and   their   links   to   psychopathology,   enhancing   our understanding of this condition. Specifically, it highlights the significant role of anger, distress,   and   panic,   while   indicating   the   limited   role   of   irritation   and   disgust   in misophonia.   Moreover,   the   findings   emphasize   that   mouth   sounds   are   more characteristic triggers of misophonia compared to other repetitive sounds. Lastly, the study demonstrates that external attributions are not associated with symptoms of depression   and   show   weak   correlations   with   anxiety   symptoms,   while   internal attributions moderately correlate with both depression and anxiety symptoms. These findings have important implications for further research and clinical management of misophonia.
