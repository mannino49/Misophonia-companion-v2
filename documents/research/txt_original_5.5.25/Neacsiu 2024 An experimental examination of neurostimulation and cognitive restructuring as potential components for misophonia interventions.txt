Misophonia is a disorder of decreased tolerance to certain aversive, repetitive common sounds, or to stimuli associated with these sounds. Two matched groups of adults (29 participants with misophonia and 30 clinical controls  with  high  emotion  dysregulation)  received  inhibitory  neurostimulation  (1  Hz)  over  a  personalized medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) target functionally connected to the left insula; excitatory neurostimulation (10 Hz) over a personalized dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) target; and sham stimulation over either target. Stimulations were applied while participants were either listening or cognitively downregulating emotions associated with personalized aversive, misophonic,  or neutral  sounds. Subjective  units  of distress  (SUDS)  and  psychophysiological measurements (e.g., skin conductance response [SCR] and level [SCL]) were collected.

Compared to controls, participants with misophonia reported higher distress ( Δ SUDS = 1.91 -1.93, p s &lt; 0.001) when listening to and when downregulating misophonic distress. Both types of neurostimulation reduced distress significantly more than sham, with excitatory rTMS providing the most benefit (Cohen s ' dSUDS = 0.53; d SCL = 0.14). Excitatory rTMS also enhanced the regulation of emotions associated with misophonic sounds in both groups when measured by SUDS ( dcontrol = 1.28; dMisophonia = 0.94), and in the misophonia group alone when measured  with  SCL  ( d = 0.20).  Both  types  of  neurostimulation  were  well  tolerated.  Engaging  in  cognitive restructuring enhanced with high-frequency neurostimulation led to the lowest misophonic distress, highlighting the best path forward for misophonia interventions.

## 1. Introduction

Misophonia is the decreased tolerance for certain aversive repetitive and common sounds such as chewing, swallowing, or keyboard tapping and for the stimuli associated with these sounds. When presented with those sounds, individuals with misophonia experience intense distress associated  with  heightened  physiological  reactions  such  as  increased heart rate or skin conductance and have trouble disengaging from the trigger  (Kumar  et  al.,  2017).  While  the  prevalence  of  misophonia  is estimated at 5 -12 % of the population (Wu et al., 2014), this condition is still  not  well  understood,  and  the  first  consensus  on  a  standardized definition  was  published  only  recently  (Swedo  et  al.,  2022).  Current misophonia treatment approaches have limited existing evidence and include lifestyle modification, cognitive behavioral therapy, and audiological treatment (Potgieter et al., 2019). However, since the mechanisms underlying misophonia are unknown, the current treatments do not have clear targets for change; limited evidence exits on the benefits of any interventions; and misophonic patients report limited satisfaction with many common approaches (Smith et al., 2022).

Emerging neuroscientific findings suggest that misophonia may be an independent disorder (Neacsiu et al., 2022a), characterized by hyperactivity of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) in response to misophonic

trigger stimuli (Kumar et al., 2017; Schroder et al., 2019), and altered ¨ activity and connectivity of prefrontal structures. The anterior insula is central  to  subjective  emotional  experience,  awareness  of  sensory perception, and higher-level integration of salient cues for emotional processing (Craig,  2009). Therefore, these  findings suggest  enhanced salience of and difficulty disengaging from misophonic sounds. Qualitative studies report that the misophonic experience contains intense emotions of anxiety, anger, and disgust, among other emotions (Brout et al., 2018; Swedo et al., 2022; Remmert et al., 2022; Rosenthal et al., 2021), as well as difficulties with emotional regulation (Guetta et al., 2022; Rinaldi et al., 2022). Thus, examinations of emotional dysregulation and comparisons with clinical populations who have difficulty with  their  arousal  and  regulation  are  warranted.  Although  several candidate networks are at play in this complex disorder (e.g., sensory, auditory, or even motor (Kumar et al., 2021)), examining the similarities and  differences  of  misophonia  with  other  emotional  disorders  holds promise because of the wealth of existing interventions for emotional dysregulation across psychopathology (Mennin, 2006; Neacsiu et al., 2014; Gross, 2013).

we  chose  to  apply  excitatory  neurostimulation  over  a  node  of  the emotion  regulation  network  (HF-rTMS  over  the  right  dlPFC)  and inhibitory  neurostimulation  targeted  towards  the  reactivity  network (LF-rTMS over a prefrontal node functionally connected to the insula). Given the consistent finding that the insula is hyperactive in the presence of trigger sounds in misophonia (Neacsiu et al., 2022a), we hypothesized  that  one  avenue  towards  intervention  is  to  inhibit  insula activity in the presence of sounds. Stimulation of the insula directly is difficult; nevertheless, connectivity based stimulation has been shown to successfully reach deeper brain structures (Beynel et al., 2021). Therefore, we used connectivity analyses to find a node in the mPFC functionally connected to the insula, and administered stimulation over this node  with  the  aim  of  inhibiting  activation  in  the  entire  network. Furthermore, we examined whether neurostimulation, cognitive restructuring, or their combination offers the most promise for a novel intervention.

In  the  present  study,  we  compared  transdiagnostic  clinical  adults who report high emotional dysregulation with adults with moderate to severe  misophonia  using  multimethod  assessment.  We  examined  differences in the response and regulation of aversive sounds to test broad emotional dysregulation in misophonia. Furthermore, we tested how clinical  controls  respond  to  and  regulate  emotions  associated  with trigger sounds to clarify the unique features of misophonia.

In addition, we aimed to investigate whether a bottom-up versus a top-down approach is best suited for a misophonia intervention. Using repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS; see Supplement) (Hoogendam et al., 2010), we examined whether inhibiting insula activity with lowfrequency  mPFC  stimulation  or  enhancing  regulation  with  highfrequency  dlPFC  stimulation  during  the  presentation  of  misophonic sounds leads to larger reductions in misophonic distress when compared to listening to trigger sounds without any intervention. Diffusion tensor imaging  data  in  humans  have  shown  direct  anatomical  connections between the insula and both the mPFC and dlPFC (Ghaziri et al., 2017). The mPFC is thought to engage in automatic, implicit emotional processing, while the dlPFC is associated with conscious, effortful emotion regulation (Etkin et al., 2015). Therefore, low-frequency mPFC stimulation  and  high-frequency  dlPFC  stimulation  allowed  us  to  examine differential  responses  to  inhibition  of  emotional  reactivity  versus augmentation  of  cognitive  emotional  control,  respectively.  We  also wanted to  compare  the  use  of  cognitive  restructuring  (an  emotional regulation skill), with neurostimulation, and with skill use plus neurostimulation  as  different  avenues  for  treatment  development  using  a within-subject  design.  Our  goal  was  to  answer  several  questions  to accelerate the development of treatments for misophonia.

We trained all  participants  to  use  cognitive  restructuring  (CR)  to understand whether skills training could be as effective for misophonic adults as it is for clinical emotional dysregulation (Neacsiu et al., 2014). Effective use of reappraisal during an emotion regulation task increases high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) (Denson et al., 2011), a marker of effective emotion regulation (Butler et al., 2006; Di Simplicio et  al.,  2012).  HF-HRV  has  not  yet  been  investigated  in  misophonia. Rather,  changes  in  skin  conductance  level  (SCL)  and  response  (SCR) were identified as potential psychophysiological markers of misophonic distress (Kumar et al., 2017). There have been few examinations of the effect of emotion regulation tasks on SCL, with one study showing no differences in SCL between effective and maladaptive regulation strategies (Campbell-Sills et al., 2006). Therefore, one aim of this study was to test differences between adults with misophonia and clinical controls on HF-HRV, SCL, SCR, and self-reported distress (SUDS) during passive listening and regulation of aversive and misophonic sounds.

The second aim was to examine whether potential misophonia interventions should target reduction to sound reactivity or improvement in emotion regulation as the primary mechanism of change. To this aim,

We hypothesized that when compared to controls, participants with misophonia will exhibit (H1) higher distress (as measured with SUDS, SCL, and SCR) when listening to misophonic trigger sounds; (H2) lower distress  when  listening  to  aversive  sounds;  and  (H3)  lower  HF-HRV during  the  regulation  of  misophonic  sounds.  We  expected  that  both LF-rTMS  (H4)  and  HF-rTMS  (H5)  stimulation  will  reduce  distress significantly  more  than  sham  stimulation  during  the  presentation  of misophonic  cues  in  the  misophonia  group.  We  expected  HF-rTMS stimulation to lead to lower distress and higher regulation (HF-HRV) in both groups when compared to sham stimulation during the presentation and regulation of aversive sounds (H6). We planned to explore differences between the use of CR, LF-rTMS, HF-rTMS, and their combination (i.e., CR + HF-rTMS; CR + LF-rTMS) within and across groups, expecting combined interventions to lead to more reductions in arousal that each component alone (H7).

## 2. Methods

## 2.1. Participants and procedures

This study was pre-registered under the Clinical Trials ID (NCT04348591) and ran between October 2020 and May 2022. The study was powered based on expected effect sizes derived from Kumar et al. [2], The CONSORT diagram (Fig. 1) and the Supplement contain additional  details  regarding  power  analyses,  participants,  and  study enrollment. Participants received a maximum compensation of $250. The study was approved by the Duke University Health System Institutional  Review  Board  and  it  study  conforms  to  the  provisions  of  the Declaration of Helsinki. Fig. 2 depicts the study design.

## 2.2. Intake session

After  providing  voluntary,  written  informed  consent,  participants completed diagnostic assessments (SCID-5, SCID-PD), a verbal intelligence test (Dunn, 1981), and a questionnaire packet [see Supplement].

## 2.3. Sound task

Qualifying  participants  completed  an  in-person  task  where  they heard  101  pre-selected  sounds:  31  aversive,  40  misophonic,  and  30 neutral sounds. Each stimulus presentation was followed by valence and arousal ratings. Participants in the misophonia group alone were also asked whether the sound was a misophonic trigger for them (yes/no). Based on this task (see Supplement for details), for each participant, personalized sets of 12 aversive, 12 misophonic, and 12 neutral sounds were selected for the neurostimulation and neuroimaging sessions.

## 2.4. Neuroimaging sessions

Participants completed an imaging session (Fig. 2B) on average 9.83

days  (SD = 9.97) after  the  eligibility  intake  session.  Following  standardized training, participants moved into a research-dedicated GE HD 3.0 T MRI scanner. The scan included an anatomical image and four runs of EPI functional images acquired while participants experienced and downregulated emotions related to personalized  sounds  (task-related acquisition: four runs). See Supplement for details.

behavioral  therapy.  The  session  focused  on  in-depth  learning  and practice of CR (See Supplement). Next, the participant s resting motor ' threshold (rMT) was established using standard procedures (Rossi et al., 2021).

FMRI analyses were performed immediately after the MRI session to define the individualized stimulation target. Structural and functional data  were  first  examined  with  MRIQC  and  then  preprocessed  with fMRIprep v1.1.4 (Esteban et al., 2019). A psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis was also conducted to measure functional connectivity  with  the  left  insula  while  listening  to  misophonic  vs.  neutral sounds. Connectivity with the left insula only was chosen because we aimed to find an mPFC target on the right hemisphere (to keep consistent with the dlPFC targeting) and other research shows contralateral connectivity tends to be strongest between limbic and prefrontal regions (Banks et al., 2007), and, finally, when affective processing is lateralized to one side of the insula, it tends to be the left side (Duerden et al., 2013).

The statistical maps for the contrasts of interest ( ' downregulate vs. listen to a misophonic sound , and  PPI: listen to misophonic vs. neutral ' ' sound )  were  transferred  to  native  space  (Avants  et  al.,  2011),  and ' overlaid  onto  the  anatomical  image  in  neuronavigation  software (BrainSight, Rogue Research, Canada). For each participant, the cluster within the right dlPFC showing the strongest positive z-statistic value for the ' Downregulate ' contrast was defined as the dlPFC target (average zdlPFC_stimulation_site = 2.74, SD = 0.73). The cluster within the right mPFC showing the strongest positive z-value above a threshold of z = 1.96 for the PPI-' Listen ' contrast was defined as the AIC functional connectivity target(average zmPFC_stimulation_site = 3.03, SD = 1.50). See Fig. 3 A-B for a visual  depiction  of  the  personalized  targeting  procedure  and  Supplement for additional details.

## 2.5. Neurostimulation experimental session

Psychophysiological  measurements  were  collected  continuously during  the  experiment  using  the  BIOPAC  MP150  recording  system (Goleta, CA) via GSR and HR electrodes. Active and sham rTMS were performed  with  a  figure-8  coil  (A/P  Cool-B65)  and  a  MagPro  X100 stimulator (MagVenture, Denmark) set up to deliver biphasic pulses. Ten Hz rTMS over the personalized right dlPFC target (HF-rTMS) was performed using 5 s of stimulation and 15 s of an inter-train interval (ITI) at 120 % rMT. One Hz rTMS over the personalized mPFC-AIC-connectivity target (LF-rTMS) was performed using one pulse per second continuously at 90 % rMT (Balconi and Bortolotti, 2012). Sham stimulation was applied using the same intensity setting but with the coil in placebo mode (Smith and Peterchev, 2018). Coil position and orientation were continually monitored through a stereotaxic neuro-navigation system (Brainsight, Rogue Research, Canada).

All participants  received  the  three  interventions.  Each  neurostimulation  experimental  session  was  conducted  by  the  first  author (AN), with the assistance of a TMS technician. AN, who was blinded to the stimulation condition, led the participant through the session and decided on dose adjustments and course of action for any protocol deviations.  The  experimental  session  (Fig.  2C-D)  is  detailed  in  the Supplement.

High-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), skin conductance response  (SCR),  and  skin  conductance  level  (SCL)  were  used  as  indicators, respectively, of emotion regulation, peak emotional arousal, and average arousal. HF-HRV and SCL were extracted within each sound task  block  (120 s).  SCR  and change in SUDS were examine for each sound presentation (30s; see Fig. 2E for a visual depiction).

## 2.6. Statistical analyses

Participants returned for the 3.5-hour skills training/neurostimulation session (Fig. 2C) on average 14.11 days after the MRI session (SD = 12.57). The first 45 min were spent on skills training, one-on-one with the first author, a clinical psychologist with expertise in cognitive

We conducted four analyses examining Δ SUDS, SCR, SCL, and HFHRV (see Fig. 2E). See Supplement for details. To account for multiple comparisons, we used a Bonferroni correction and reduced the alpha threshold to &lt; 0.0125. Planned covariates for all analyses included coil-

to-cortex distance (Lee et al., 2016; Stokes et al., 2005). Data-driven covariates  such  as  the  incidence  of  headaches  post-stimulation  were also examined and added as needed. Effect sizes were computed by using Feingold s  formula  (Feingold,  2009)  and  interpreted  using  Cohen s ' ' specifications  (Cohen,  1977).  The  distribution  of  HF-HRV  was  transformed to normal using the function lg10 (HF-HRV*1000000). All other data were normally distributed.

## 3. Results

## 3.1. Feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, compliance, and blinding efficacy

Overall participants in both groups reported reduced stress at the end compared to the beginning of each experimental session ( Δ average_intake_change = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.56, SD = 1.53; Δ average_MRI_change = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.31, SD = 1.22; Δ average_TMS_change = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.48, SD = 0.89). These results suggest that the experimental tasks were feasible and acceptable to our participants. Following the sham stimulation, 26 participants (48.15 %) reported some headache, compared to 40 participants (74.07 %) after the HF-rTMS trial, and 34 (62.96 %) after the LF-rTMS trial, a significant difference ( χ 2 [2] = 7.73, p = .02). Because of the higher incidence of headache in the active stimulation conditions, we included this variable as  a  data-driven  covariate  in  analyses.  There  was  no  difference  in guessing  active  versus  sham  assignments  between  types  of  neurostimulation received ( Msham = 5.72, SD = 2.27; MHF-rTMS = 6.74, SD = 2.07; MLF-rTMS = 6.43, SD = 2.18) or between groups (F [2, 151] = 11.05, p = .09),  according  to  a  multivariate  ANOVA  controlling  for racial  background (F [1, 151] = 0.06, p = .44).  See  Supplement for additional findings.

## 3.2. Preliminary analyses examining confounds

There  were  significantly  more  participants  belonging  to  racial  or ethnic  minority  groups  in  the  emotional  dysregulation  condition (Table 1). Therefore, racial/ethnic background was recoded as 0 (nonwhite)  or  1  (white)  and  co-varied  in  subsequent  analyses.  A  more nuanced covariate was not possible given that the misophonia group was 96.5 % white.

Significant differences were found between experimental conditions (sham vs. active rTMS) during the habituation period (i.e., when neurostimulation  alone  was  administered  at  rest).  At  rest,  HF-rTMS administered over the right dlPFC enhanced HF-HRV ( F [2, 90.49] = 6.63, p = .002), SCR ( F [2, 90.76] = 14.27, p &lt; .001), and SCL ( F [2, 96.22] = 27.17, p &lt; .001)  significantly  more  than  sham  neurostimulation ( Δ HF-HRV = 0.12, SE = 0.03; Δ SCR = 2.84, SE = 0.54; Δ SCL = 1.76, SE = 0.24). LF-rTMS over the right mPFC did not significantly affect HF-HRV, but significantly increased SCR ( Δ SCR = 1.72, SE = 0.52) and SCL ( Δ SCL = 0.72, SE = 0.23) when compared to sham. Participants experienced  significantly  higher  tonic  arousal  (SCL)  during  HF-rTMS than during LF-rTMS ( Δ SCL = 1.05; SE = 0.24, p &lt; .001). As planned, because of these observed differences, habituation values for outcomes variables replaced task baseline values as co-variates in main analyses.

Effect sizes were computed by using Feingold s formula (Feingold, ' 2009) and interpreted using Cohen s specifications (Cohen, 1977). The ' SD for HF-HRV (0.59), SCR (4.26), and SCL (3.60) during the session baseline, and for Δ SUDS post-pre session baseline (0.58) were used to compute the effect sizes.

## 3.3.1. Self-report results (SUDS)

The MMANOVA analysis of SUDS used a Toeplitz covariance structure (see the syntax in Supplement) and found a significant main effect of experimental neurostimulation ( F [2, 373.52] = 19.50, p &lt; .000000001). Pairwise comparisons between the three neurostimulation conditions  demonstrated  that  SUDS  ratings  were  significantly  lower when HF-rTMS over the dlPFC was administered than when either LFrTMS over the  mPFC ( p  &lt; .00001,  Cohen s ' d = 1.0)  or  sham  ( p &lt; .000000001, d = 1.58) were administered. See supplement for additional results for main effects.

A  significant  interaction  was  found  between  experimental  neurostimulation,  experimental  instruction,  and  group  ( F [22,  705.00] = 18.36, p &lt; .000000001). The interaction revealed that participants in the  misophonia  group  experienced  significantly  more  distress  than controls when listening ( Δ = 1.91, SE = 0.32, p &lt; .001, d = 3.34) and when downregulating ( Δ = 1.93, SE = 0.32, p &lt; .001, d = 3.34) misophonic sounds across all experimental conditions, a finding that supports H1. In addition, participants in the misophonia group reported significantly less distress than participants with emotion dysregulation when listening to aversive sounds ( Δ = 1.76, SE = 0.32, p &lt; .001, d = 3.04), a finding that supports H2. In the sham condition alone, participants  with  emotional  dysregulation  reported  more  distress  when downregulating aversive sounds than participants with misophonia ( Δ

= 1.08, SE = 0.40, p &lt; .008, d = 1.87). During dlPFC and mPFC stimulation, this difference between groups was no longer significant, suggesting  that  neurostimulation  normalized  the  regulation  of  aversive sounds for controls.

Group-specific results were as follows: for participants with emotion dysregulation,  confirming  H6,  HF-rTMS  decreased  SUDS  more  than sham when participants were asked to listen to neutral ( Δ SHAM-HF-rTMS = 0.92, p = .004, d = 1.59), aversive sounds ( Δ SHAM-HF-rTMS = 0.97, p &lt; .001, d = 1.68), or misophonic sounds ( Δ SHAM-HF-rTMS = 1.50, p &lt; .001, d = 2.59).  HF-rTMS  also  enhanced  the  downregulation  of  aversive

For  participants  with  misophonia,  unlike  patients  with  emotion dysregulation, the rTMS effect was specific for the misophonic sounds. Contrary to H6, there were no differences between both active and sham neurostimulation  when  participants  listened  to  neutral  or  aversive sounds  or  when  they  downregulated  aversive  sounds.  This  is  likely because participants with misophonia reported relatively low distress when listening to aversive sounds ( EMM = 1.55, SE = 0.34). Nevertheless, the distress produced by a misophonic sound was significantly lower in the HF-rTMS condition when compared to sham when participants were instructed to listen ( Δ SHAM-HF-rTMS = 0.92, p = .001, d = 1.59) or to downregulate ( Δ SHAM-HF-rTMS = 1.02, p &lt; .001, d = 1.76), which supports H5. LF-rTMS was marginally superior to sham during listening ( Δ SHAM-LF-tTMS = 0.58, d = 1.00, Bonferroni corrected p = .16), or  downregulation of  misophonic sounds ( Δ SHAM-LF-rTMS = 0.64, d = 1.11, Bonferroni corrected p = .12). Thus, H4 was not supported. There was no difference between the two active rTMS conditions ( p &gt; .05).

To examine the effects of implementing a behavioral skill alone, we examined differences within the sham condition only. Instructions to downregulate led to significantly less distress than instructions to listen to aversive ( Δ = 1.88, SE = 0.39, p &lt; .001, d = 3.25) and misophonic ( Δ = 2.12, SE = 0.33, p &lt; .001, d = 3.66) sounds across groups. Thus, in both conditions, excitatory neurostimulation as well as implementation of an emotion regulation skill individually reduced emotional distress, and therefore are promising interventions for both emotional dysregulation and misophonia.

To examine across groups whether neurostimulation alone was superior to behavioral skill implementation, we compared the change in distress when listening to aversive or misophonic sounds while receiving HF-rTMS with changes during sham while participants were engaged in CR. We also compared the combination of neurostimulation with CR with either intervention alone. Utilizing a behavioral skill was superior to neurostimulation alone ( paversive = 0.001, d = 2.31; pmisophonic = 0.012, d = 1.57) in reducing distress induced by aversive sounds. The combination  of  neurostimulation  and  skill  use  led  to  significantly  lower distress at the end of the sound presentation for both misophonic and aversive sounds when compared to either intervention modality alone ( p s &lt; 0.001, d s &gt; 2.90).  Therefore,  in  line  with  H7,  the  combined intervention leads to the highest reduction in distress, followed by utilizing only behavioral skills, followed by neurostimulation alone.

## 3.3.2. Peak arousal (SCR) results

A MMANOVA analysis using a Toeplitz covariance structure found a main effect of baseline ( F [1, 674.27] = 33.99, p &lt; .00000001), the time during the block ( F [3, 99.85] = 48.86, p &lt; .001), and headache ( F [1, 668.90] = 15.22, p &lt; .001). There was also a marginally significant main effect for coil-to-cortex distance ( F [1, 717.11] = 5.06, p = .03). Higher baseline SCR (i.e., during habituation; parameter estimate [PE] = 0.17, SE = 0.03), lower coil-to-cortex distance ( PE = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.12, SE = 0.03), and presence of head discomfort ( PE = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.82, SE = 0.21) led to higher SCR during individual sound presentations. SCR decreased significantly over time within each block ( p s &lt; 0.03). A significant main effect of experimental neurostimulation was also found ( F [2, 587.82] = 6.98, p = .001), but pairwise comparisons only found a marginally significant difference between sham and the LF-rTMS conditions ( Δ = 0.35, SE = 0.16, p = .03). There was no significant main effect for group, instructions provided, or racial background ( p s &gt; 0.05). The interaction effect between experimental neurostimulation, instruction provided and experimental group was marginally significant, and as a result, was not investigated further ( F [22, 1262.55] = 1.65, p = .03). Therefore, the SCR results did not support any of our hypotheses.

found a significant main effect for experimental neurostimulation ( F [2, 79.70] = 7.18, p = .001). Tonic arousal was significantly higher in the sham condition when compared to either active stimulation condition ( p HF_rTMS = 0 001; . p LF_rTMS = 0.002;  s d = 0.14), with no difference between active  conditions  ( p &gt; .05)  suggesting  that  both  types  of  neurostimulation reduced tonic arousal. Higher SCL at baseline (i.e., during habituation)  led  to  higher  SCL  during  the  experimental  runs  ( F [1, 57.77] = 2488.10, p &lt; .001). There was also a significant effect of time during the experimental run, with earlier blocks having significantly higher SCL than later blocks ( p s &lt; 0.001). Thus, SCL decreased over time during the run independent of the experimental condition. There was no significant  main  effect  for  the  experimental  group,  instructions  provided,  headache,  racial  background,  or  coil-to-cortex  distance  ( p s &gt; 0.05). Therefore, the SCL results did not support H1 and H2.

expectations  in  H6,  across  both  groups  and  all  trials,  HF-HRV  was significantly  higher  in  the  sham  condition  when  compared  to  either active stimulation condition ( p HF_rTMS = 0 008; . p LF_rTMS = 0.001, d s = 0.10). In the same analysis, there was a significant main effect of HFHRV  value during habituation ( F [1, 67.58] = 1088.48, p &lt; .00000001) and of coil-to-cortex distance ( F [1, 121.62] = 11.71, p &lt; .0009), with lower coil-to-cortex distance ( PE = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.02, SE = 0.01) and higher  HF-HRV  values  during  habituation  ( PE = 0.82, SE = 0.03) leading to  higher  HF-HRV values during experimental trials. Finally, only  a  marginally  significant  interaction  was  found  between  experimental  neurostimulation,  instruction,  and  experimental  group  ( F [22, 130.82] = 1.84,  Bonferroni  corrected p = .076),  and  therefore  the interaction was not investigated further.

A  significant  interaction  was  found  between  experimental  neurostimulation, instruction provided, and group ( F [22, 111.50] = 2.69, p &lt; .0005, Fig. 5). There were no significant differences between groups, and therefore we examined this interaction within each group.

For  clinical  control  patients  with  emotion  dysregulation,  when listening to neutral ( Δ SHAM-HF-rTMS = 0.63, p = .004; Δ SHAM-LF-rTMS = 0.67, p = .002) or misophonic sounds ( Δ SHAM-LF-tTMS = 0.811, p &lt; .001, d = 0.23; Δ SHAM-HF-rTMS = 0.59, SE = 0.203, p = .004, d = 0.16), both HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS decreased tonic arousal when compared to sham stimulation, with no difference between the two stimulation conditions. Therefore, SCL results support H6. LF-rTMS alone reduced SCL significantly  more  when listening  to  an  aversive  sound  when  compared  to sham ( Δ SHAM-LF-rTMS = 0.69, p = .002, d = 0.19). There were no significant differences between experimental neurostimulation conditions during the regulation blocks.

For patients with misophonia, and supporting H5 and H6, HF-rTMS reduced  SCL  significantly  more  than  sham  when  listening  to  either aversive  ( Δ SHAM-HF-tTMS = 0.63, p = .009, d = 0.18)  or  misophonic sounds ( Δ SHAM-HF-tTMS = 0.56, p = .009, d = 0.16) and when downregulating  misophonic  sounds  ( Δ SHAM-HF-tTMS = 0.73, p = .006, d = 0.20).  The  lowest  SCL  when  exposed  to  misophonic  sounds  in  the misophonia group was during the combination of behavioral skill utilization and HF-rTMS stimulation. H4 was not supported.

To investigate the effects of using only behavioral skills, we examined  differences  within  the  sham  condition  and  found  no  significant reduction in SCL when implementing CR alone (i.e., sham stimulation during listening was not significantly different from sham stimulation during  downregulation; p s &gt; 0.35).  Thus,  in  both  groups,  excitatory neurostimulation alone reduced emotional distress.

We also aimed to examine differences across groups in SCL after receiving  different  intervention  approaches  while  listening  to  and downregulating aversive and misophonic sounds. Therefore, we compared tonic arousal across three conditions: when participants were downregulating sounds in the sham condition; when participants were listening  to  sounds  and  receiving  HF-rTMS;  when  participants  were downregulating emotions associated with sounds while receiving HFrTMS.  For  both  aversive  and  misophonic  sounds,  neurostimulation alone  ( paversive = 0.014; pmisophonic = 0.014)  or  in  combination  with cognitive restructuring ( paversive = 0.017; pmisophonic = 0.001) led to less arousal  than  CR  alone.  There  was  no  significant  difference  between neurostimulation  alone  and  the  combined  approach  ( p s &gt; 0.10). Therefore,  H7  was  partially  supported.  There  was  also  no  difference between groups in response to these different interventions. This suggests  that  a  neurostimulation-based  treatment  might  be  optimal  for intervention for misophonia as well as emotional dysregulation.

## 3.3.4. High-Frequency Heart Rate Variability (HF-HRV) results

A MMANOVA analysis using an unstructured covariance structure did not reveal any main effect of group, instruction provided, headache, or  racial  background  ( p s &gt; 0.05).  Therefore,  H3  was  not  supported. However,  we  found  significant  main  effects  of  experimental  neurostimulation  type  ( F [2,  86.03] = 6.37, p = .003).  Contrary  to  our

In  sum,  when controlling for  the increase in HF-HRV induced by neurostimulation  or  sham  alone,  participants  have  higher  HF-HRV during the sham experimental trials than during the active stimulation trials. Raw means of HF-HRV across groups are higher for active than for sham neurostimulation  ( MHF-rTMS = 0.000186; MLF-rTMS = 0.000166; Msham = 0.000153), which is aligned with H6.

## 3.4. Exit interview

Participants  perceived  response  to  neurostimulation  varied;  some commented that neurostimulation either made them more numb to their feelings while others commented that neurostimulation led them to feel things more deeply. Participants with misophonia also described a sense of overwhelming hope, as well as wanting to laugh during the presentation of misophonic triggers because they were much less aversive than when experiencing these stimuli in the absence of neurostimulation.

All participants indicated an above-average willingness to engage in neurostimulation enhanced behavioral treatment to help reduce mental health distress ( M = 6.13, SD = 2.64, range 0 -unwilling -9 -extremely willing; pgroup_difference = 0.39). All participants found CR training very helpful ( M = 7.59, SD = 1.83, Range: 0 -9; pgroup_difference = 0.56), the combined procedures highly acceptable Macceptability = 8.13, SD = 1.03, Range  0 -9; pgroup_difference = 0.68)  and  reported  high  likelihood  to recommend this treatment to a friend ( M = 74.98 %, SD = 19.89, range 0 100 %; -pgroup_difference = 0.88).

## 4. Discussion

Emerging research highlights that misophonia is a serious disorder that  significantly  impairs  the  quality  of  life  and  functioning  (Swedo et  al.,  2022).  Several  studies  have  characterized  misophonia  across behavioral and biological domains (Neacsiu et al., 2022a; Brout et al., 2018; Siepsiak et al., 2022); nevertheless, given the intense emotional reaction to specific sounds, it is yet unclear whether misophonia should be considered a unique disorder under the purview of any particular clinical discipline. Furthermore, how to best intervene for those who meet criteria for this disorder continues to be unclear (Palumbo et al., 2018). Therefore, in this study, we compared adults with moderate and severe misophonia severity to a transdiagnostic sample of adults who meet criteria for a DSM-5 disorder and who self-report clinically high difficulties  with  regulating  emotions.  We  also  examined  whether  interventions should aim to reduce sound reactivity or improve emotion regulation  and  whether  neurostimulation,  cognitive  restructuring,  or their combination offers the most promise to intervene on this disorder.

This  study  demonstrates  that  there  are  few  psychophysiological differences in the response and regulation of distress related to sounds between clinical emotional dysregulation and misophonia. Prior preliminary studies did show psychophysiological differences (especially in SCR) between adults with misophonia and non-clinical controls (Kumar et al., 2017). Our findings highlight that when confronted with trigger sounds, adults with misophonia are similar to adults who have significant difficulties regulating emotions with a range of DSM-5 disorders in physiological  reactivity  and  arousal.  Thus,  existing  evidence-based

GLYPH&lt;0&gt;

interventions that successfully address arousal and emotion regulation developed for other clinical problems also may provide some benefit to misophonia  sufferers. Dialectical behavior therapy skills training (Neacsiu et al., 2014), adaptations of the unified protocol (Lewin et al., 2021), or neurostimulation-augmented emotion regulation training may reduce emotion dysregulation across clinical samples (Neacsiu et al., 2022b; Neacsiu et al., 2021; Neacsiu et al., 2021) and, therefore, may be promising approaches for new interventions for misophonia.

Significant  differences  were  found  in  participants ' self-report  of distress and regulation. Specifically, clinical controls were more bothered by aversive sounds than those with misophonia; misophonic adults were  more  upset  when  compared  to  controls  following  triggers  and while trying to downregulate emotions induced by trigger sounds. In light of the physiological findings, we interpret this as sensitization: the sounds that one finds most aversive (misophonic for participants with misophonia and aversive for participants with emotional dysregulation) lead  to  heightened  subjective  experience  of  distress  which  doesn t ' necessarily mirror the psychophysiological response. In other words, if one is bothered by a specific sound (i.e., is sensitized to it), hearing it may lead to higher perception of distress than the body actually experiences. An alternative interpretation could be that SCL/SCR/HF-HRV are not appropriate measures to capture the difference in response between groups and other objective measures should be tested to differentiate misophonia from clinical distress. Nevertheless, until a different measure  is  identified,  interventions  intended  to  change  misophonic distress should focus on self-reported distress as a unique differentiator from other clinical conditions.

disorder, and smoking (Cohen et al., 2022), although research continues to be needed to validate these treatments and clarify long- and shortterm effects (Kumar et al., 2022). While initially neurostimulation was reserved for treatment-resistant cases, the evidence suggests that nontreatment-resistant adults can benefit from this treatment (Voigt et al., 2019), which opens up this approach to any condition as a candidate novel  intervention.  In  the  case  of  misophonia,  no  clear  pathway  for intervention exists yet. Nevertheless, some findings suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy (Jager et al., 2021; Cecilione et al., 2022) and the use of emotion regulation skills (Lewin et al., 2021; Tonarely-Busto et al., 2022) can offer promise for misophonia. We, therefore, wanted to compare whether neurostimulation alone, emotion regulation alone, or their combination lead to the biggest decrease in distress.

We also examined whether the best way to approach intervention for misophonic  distress  was  to  change  top-down  versus  bottom-up  processes.  Using  a  functional  imaging  paradigm,  we  identified  specific functionally connected regions in the anterior insular cortex and medial prefrontal cortex that were more engaged during the presentation of misophonic versus neutral sounds. We examined whether intervening using  a  bottom-up  process,  by  inhibiting  reactivity  with  the  use  of neurostimulation, was a potential intervention for misophonia. We also identified the region in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that was most  active  during  regulation  when  compared  to  just  listening  to misophonic  sounds.  We  examined  whether  a  top-down  intervention, simulated in the study by enhancing regulation with neurostimulation and/or the use of an emotion regulation skill, could be beneficial for misophonia. Our design allowed us to compare both approaches. We found clear superiority across both self-report and tonic arousal measures for the top-down approach. Participants with misophonia experienced significantly less distress in the presence of misophonic triggers when their regulation network was engaged via either excitatory rTMS over  the  right  dlPFC  or  the  use  of  an  emotion  regulation  skill.  This finding  strongly  suggests  that  interventions  aimed  towards  emotion regulation have promise for misophonia.

There  have  been  few  neuroimaging  findings  for  misophonia  that highlight  dlPFC  dysfunction  (Neacsiu  et  al.,  2022a).  In  one  study, healthy controls alone evidenced increased activity in the dlPFC when successfully inhibiting behavior during a stop signal task. Participants with misophonia did not display dlPFC changes during inhibition success (Eijsker et al., 2019). Our findings align with this study, given that inhibition  during  a  stop  signal  task  involves  regulation.  The  lack  of activation in the dlPFC during regulation suggests that participants with misophonia recruit other brain regions for regulation, which may lead to a  less  efficient  process.  Promoting  dlPFC  activity  during  regulation, may, therefore, restore a faulty process. It is important to highlight that the  majority  of  imaging  studies  with  misophonia  thus  far  have  not included regulation paradigms (Neacsiu et al., 2022a). Therefore, the role of the dlPFC in misophonia needs additional exploration.

In the last two decades, neurostimulation has accumulated exciting new evidence that supports its potential for intervention (Lepping et al., 2014). There are currently five neurostimulation-based protocols that are FDA approved for the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive

First, it is important to highlight that engaging in either cognitive regulation or neurostimulation alone reduced distress when compared to no intervention for both misophonic and emotionally dysregulated adults.  Thus,  both  neurostimulation  and  emotion  regulation  training should  be  considered  important  options  for  future  misophonia  interventions. Second, the combined intervention on both misophonic and aversive sounds led to significantly less self-reported distress and lower tonic arousal when compared to implementing the emotion regulation skill alone. Self-report results showed the superiority of the behavioral intervention alone versus the neurostimulation alone, while the finding was reversed for the tonic arousal measure. Therefore, if the intended outcome is a reduction in physiological arousal, neurostimulation outperforms behavioral skills. Nevertheless, when it comes to perceived distress, behavioral intervention reduces this perception more so than neurostimulation alone. Given that we found differences primarily in self-reported  distress,  these  findings  suggest  that  a  combination  of neurostimulation and emotion regulation training is a promising avenue for a misophonia intervention. If a combined treatment is not possible, a behavioral  intervention  focused  on  emotion  regulation  holds  more promise than exposing participants to sounds alone.

There  were  some  key  differences  between  our  study  and  prior studies.  First,  in  our  prior  examination  of  psychophysiology  during neurostimulation,  we  found  no  difference  between  active  and  sham rTMS in heart rate variability and indices of arousal (Neacsiu et al., 2022b; Neacsiu et al., 2021). In this study, HF-rTMS increased HF-HRV significantly more than sham during the habituation period, and both types of stimulation increased arousal more than sham. This difference may  be  due  to  the  procedures  employed.  This  study  employed  an enhanced stimulation regimen with shorter ITT (15 vs. 26 s) and more pulses administered in a shorter amount of time (3 vs 10 min). More intensive excitatory neurostimulation may lead to more effect on HFHRV,  and  the  shorter  duration  may  not  allow  sufficient  time  for behavioral regulation alone to happen. Furthermore, across all experimental  conditions,  HF-HRV  ended  up  being  higher  in  sham  than  in active neurostimulation conditions when controlling for the enhanced effect  of  neurostimulation  alone  on  this  measure  during  habituation. This would suggest that rTMS does not enhance regulation, but rather it facilitates a faster regulation process. Indeed, in our prior trial, where participants regulated for 10 min, the sham condition ' caught up ' and showed similar HF-HRV towards the end of the regulation period, but was  significantly  different  at  the  beginning  of  the  regulation  period (Neacsiu et al., 2022b).

As in other studies (Stokes et al., 2005; Neacsiu et al., 2022b), we found that coil-to-cortex distance was a significant covariate; a larger distance  predicted  less  efficacy  of  neurostimulation  for  several  outcomes. Greater distance means that the strength of the electric field induced  by  neurostimulation  is  reduced  by  the  time  it  reaches  the cortical  target,  and,  therefore,  the  efficacy  of  neuromodulation  decreases. Furthermore, the presence of headaches increased skin response during experimental trials. Therefore, future research should control for these variables when interpreting outcomes.

Our findings also are relevant to the development of emotion regulation  interventions  in  people  without  misophonia.  First,  adults  with

GLYPH&lt;0&gt;

A.D. Neacsiu et al.

clinical emotional dysregulation had more difficulty in using an emotion regulation  skill  successfully  when  compared  to  misophonic  adults. Nevertheless,  this  difference  was  no  longer  significant  when  neurostimulation was added, suggesting that the addition of TMS can help normalize a dysfunctional process in this clinical sample. In other words, adults  with  emotion  dysregulation  may  need  additional  support  to implement emotion regulation skills successfully. Furthermore, as with misophonia, the combination of behavioral skills and neuromodulation led to the least distress, suggesting that future interventions should focus on this combined approach for maximum benefit. This finding aligns well with research that highlights the superiority of behavioral therapy in tandem with neurostimulation when compared to behavioral therapy alone  (Neacsiu  et  al.,  2022b;  Kozel  et  al.,  2018).  The  hypothesized mechanism  is  that  neurostimulation  facilitates  neural  processing  in localized cortical regions via inducing Hebbian-like plasticity (Stefan et  al.,  2000)  which may have therapeutic effects and may remediate deficits in affected neural networks (Luber et al., 2008).

These results should be considered in light of several key limitations. While the study was adequately powered, the sample size was small and lacked  racial  and  ethnic  diversity  across  groups.  Results  should  be replicated  with  a  larger  sample  size  and  better  representation  of minoritized  populations.  A  full  factorial  design  could  have  clarified whether the stimulation intensity or brain region stimulated was the active ingredient for the results we found. Future replications should consider  executing  a  complete  stimulation  by  region  and  by  group experimental design (HF vs. LF, insula vs. dlPFC, misophonia vs control). LF-rTMS was applied at 90 % MT and HF-rTMS was applied at 120 % MT per existing protocols at the time when the study was designed. The superiority of HF-rTMS may be due to the higher stimulation intensity. Higher LF-rTMS intensity and alternative ways to target the anterior insula should be investigated before completely discounting the viability of targeting with neurostimulation the anterior insula via its functional connectivity with the mPFC to treat misophonia or emotional dysregulation. Despite our efforts to control for cumulative effects, lingering rTMS effects may have also influenced the results. A between-subjects design would be ideal for a replication study to rule out the influence of cumulative effects, although here we controlled for task order and presented experimental conditions in a randomized order. Lastly, there were several protocol deviations engaged that may confound study results. We included all data available and described our study deviations because the problems we encounter mimic real-world issues and solutions  that  would  need  to  be  implemented  in  a  community  practice should an intervention emerge from our protocol.

Alternative neurostimulation techniques, such as the use of transcranial electrical stimulation, may also be important lines of research for future intervention development. For example, tinnitus symptoms were shown to be modulated by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (Vanneste  et  al.,  2013;  Yuan  et  al.,  2018).  Transcranial  alternating current stimulation (tACS) may facilitate improvement in cognition as well  as  in  depressive  symptoms,  with  mixed  results  associated  with amelioration of schizophrenia symptoms (Lee et al., 2022). Both noninvasive  electrical  neurostimulation  modalities  are  safe  and  welltolerated (Matsumoto and Ugawa, 2016). The precision of targeting is reduced  with  these  alternative  methods  when  compared  to  rTMS although these methods are less costly and may lead to more scalable interventions. Therefore, conduction of blinded, randomized placebocontrolled  trials  would  be  needed  to  evaluate  its  clinical  application and efficacy.

Taken together, these findings highlight that neurostimulation and cognitive  restructuring  are  promising  avenues  of  intervention  for misophonia, with their combination  showing  the  most  promise. Engaging  in  regulation  may  lead  to  more  reduction  in  misophonic distress  than  attempting  to  inhibit  reactivity  to  sounds.  Adults  with misophonia have similar psychophysiological responses to stress and triggers as adults with clinical emotional dysregulation, although selfreported distress differentiates groups. This highlights the conclusion that misophonia may be a disorder comparable to other DSM disorders and  that  additional  biomarkers  that  capture  the  unique  misophonic distress  are  still  needed.  It  is  important  to  highlight  that  our  study sampled  different  approaches  for  intervention,  but  did  not  test  an intervention per se. Future studies should examine the short and longterm effects of neurostimulation, emotion regulation, or their combination for misophonia.
