 ABSTRACT  
Studies of misophonia have not assessed the impact of music and sound complexity on 
intelligence  in individuals with misophonia. Edelstein et al. (2013) have provided work 
which pools trigger sound characteristics including sound repetitiveness yet does  not 
include a substantial music subcategory. Utilizing  the Cattell–Horn –Carroll model of 
intelligence, the  current study explores the nature of music and music complexity on fluid 
intelligence , as described by Sternberg (2012). The hypotheses for this study focused on 
the relationship that complexity and music might have with misophonia. The rate of 
misophonia in the Mechanical Turk population was hypothesized to be 20%. The group with misophonia was predicted to perform worse when exposed to repetitive music and 
better when exposed to no music or complex music. Fluid intelligence was measured with 
a reaction speed score from the n -back task of working memory (Jae ggi et al.,2010). 
Disposition for misophonia was measured with the MisoQuest survey ( Siepsiak et al., 
2020a) . A sample of Mechanical Turk workers participated in an n -back activity while 
exposed to no music, complex music, or repetitive music. The outcome of the study showed that rates of misophonia in the Mechanical Turk population were lower than hypothesized at under 5%. In supplementary analysis, the participants, categorized as having more misophonia traits, were worse at the n- back task in every condi tion 
including no music, complex music, and repetitive music. The outcome of this study can inform the work and educational environment setup.

 INTRODUCTION  
Over time scientific investigations have garnered valuable and applicable 
information for populations to be able to implement technologies improving quality of 
life (Jaffe et al., 2013; Rull, 2014). Today, the push for advancement in care is 
increasingly aimed at understanding human behavior, both biologically and psychologically (Altimus et al., 2020). Improvements are necessary for optimizing health and wellbeing across the population. This interest synergizes with another modern goal: 
personalized treatment ( Goetz & Schork, 2018). To provide biologically and 
psychologically based personalized treatments, investigation into a number of 
psychological and neuroscientific areas must be conducted ( Dutcher & Creswell, 2018).  
One of these topics is sound sensit ivity ( Cavanna & Seri, 2015); in particular the 
understudied subset of sound sensitivity behaviors, misophonia. Misophonia is defined as a neurobehavioral syndrome that occurs as exposure to a trigger sound results in emotive and physical reactions greater  than that expected in the population generally (Edelstein et 
al., 2013; Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001). Some of these sounds may include eating sounds (i.e. slurping, chomping, sucking fluid through a straw) or fidgeting sounds (i.e. foot shuffling, knuckle popping, nail clicking, or pen clicking).  People with misophonia experience flashes of negative emotion in response to these specific sounds. The negative emotions often involve anger and can influence the sympathetic/parasympathetic response exchange of the autonomic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is defined as the portion of the nervous system which upregulates activity leading to

2 
 physiological readiness for acute emergency (National Cancer Institute, n.d. -a). These 
changes can include faster heart rate and respiration rate. The response by this system 
triggers the flight- or-flight response, characterized by intense emotion and action. This is 
the system activated by misophonia. T he parasympathetic response is complementary to 
the sympathetic response. The parasympathetic nervous system is defined as the system 
responsible for reducing heart rate and respiration rate (National Cancer Institute, n.d.- b).  
Misophonia and related conditions are estimated to occur in between 15 and 20% 
of the population. Such conditions contribute to maladaptive characteristics. Avoidance of serving triggering food or being around people eating  triggering foods that create the 
disliked noises, as well a s avoidance of people who typically produce  trigger noises are 
examples of these characteristics.
 Those with misophonia can also show mimicry with 
certain sounds. Mimicry occurs when a person with misophonia experiences a trigger sound and makes a similar noise themselves as a coping strategy . These characteristics 
may decrease quality of life for those with misophonia and those with whom they interact. Additionally, two possible financial consequences of misophonia and other related conditions could be cos tly with the need for therapeutic intervention, and could 
also cause negative workplace efficiency, although at this time no research has been found that investigates misophonia as an economic factor. For example, tinnitus, a condition often linked to misophonia and with comparable treatment and incidence, has been recorded as costing some medical organizations over 750 million dollars annually in the UK (Stockdale et al., 2017). This exorbitant cost for tinnitus, a condition with similar

3 
 therapeutic treatm ents as misophonia, is found in a population of sufferers only half as 
large as those estimated to have misophonia (Stockdale et al., 2017).  
To properly examine consequences associated with misophonia, investigation of 
sound response is important  (Schröder et al., 2019) . Neural configuration and 
connectivity associated with peripheral nervous system function, as well as intellectual 
involvement, has been partially investigated, and it has been found that those with misophonia engage the stimulus filtration  portions of the brain, but may have 
abnormalities in that system. This filtration system is known as the salience network and involves the insula and anterior cingulate cortex. Any impacting conditions on this network will affect stimuli sorting and appro priate engagement of additional neural 
networks. Yet, with this in mind, too many gaps remain to fully describe the nature of the condition. To better understand the condition and its link with intellectual functioning, the current study will examine two r elationships between misophonia and fluid 
intelligence. The first relationship assessed will be for underlying links between level of fluid intelligence and the presence of misophonia. The second, and most clinically relevant, will assess the functioning of fluid intelligence under complex and simple musical conditions in individuals with and without misophonia. The logic for this 
investigation follows in the footsteps of other intelligence inquiries ( Mani et al., 2013) . 
These findings bring into focus the need to assess stimulus impact on intelligence 
functioning, in schools and workplaces. People with misophonia may not function at their 
optimal level with certain background noises, for example. The current study explores the

4 
 impact of two forms of music ( repetitive and rhapsodic), on fluid intelligence function in 
individuals with and without misophonia. It is hypothesized that repetitive music will 
harm the fluid intelligence task performance of those with misophonia to a greater extent 
than those without misophonia. This will add to the current literature by investigating a 
link between fluid intelligence and misophonia as well as determining the fragility of 
intelligence when exposed to complex and repetitive sound stimulus . A review of the 
literature on  sound sensitivities, misophonia and fluid intelligence will follow to provide 
appropriate background information for the study.  
Sound Sensitivities and Misophonia  
The term misophonia means hatred of sound and refers to a condition where 
individuals experience atypically dramatic negative reactions to a trigger sound. The most 
well-known reaction is that of anger or revulsion ( Daniels et al., 2020). This condition is 
worth investigating due to evidence that it is potentially quite common, and symptoms  
can substantially interfere with daily living. The severity of the symptoms determines the 
level of disruption to an afflicted individual. For example, a small misophonic reaction may induce an individual to reduce eye contact with dinner partners. This would be typical of someone who finds chewing sounds to be a trigger. A more extreme reaction would be for the individual to begin eating alone. The symptomology is increasingly understood, yet investigation into the rate of occurrence is somewhat murky. A genetics 
study indicates the population rates of misophonia could be over 20% ( Fayzullina et al., 
2015) . A clinical group of inpatients in Poland ( N=94) were assessed using a validated

5 
 questionnaire; results from the study found rates nearer to 8-12% ( Siepsiak et al., 2020a ). 
Even if rates are as low as 8%, this still indicates a population relevant for study based on 
almost one person in ten experiencing impairment due to the symptoms. 
Misophonia can then be understood as a dislike of sound. However, many 
conditions can fall under such a generalization. The unique characteristics of misophonia are often best understood within the context of the sound intolerance category of syndromes, disorders, and behaviors. 
The Umbrella of Sound Sensitivity and Perception Alteration Syndromes  
Altered hearing sensation and perception occurs at two basic points in the 
auditory process (Kumar et al., 2017)
. First there is a difference in how the ear or body is 
transducing sound. This occurs between vibration capture by sensory organs and tissues 
and the point where sound passes through the auditory nerve to the brain. The second occurs at the perceptual level where the impulses from the auditory nerve are processed and utilized in an altered way at some point in the brain. When only looking into human sound disorders and phenomena, there is substantial variation in location and causes of 
these unique conditions (Buran et al. 2014; O'Hanlon et al., 2013). Conditions range from 
hearing loss to autonomous sensory meridian response. Some of these syndromes do not cause distress, but some do. One such neutral syndrome is addressed below. 
Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response  
Some conditions are entirely part of neural processing as is the case with 
autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) and synesthesia, when information

6 
 meant to stimulate one sense actually stimulates more than one in an atypical way ( Buran 
et al. 2014; O'Hanlon et al., 2013). Autonomous sensory meridian response is a newly 
observed phenomenon (Poerio et al., 2018). Available information describes this 
condition as a tingling feeling along the body, particularly the spine, induced by auditory stimulation. The triggers for this condition are often sounds that bear similarity to misophonia triggers. Some of these ASMR sounds include clicks, scratching, and mouth sounds. Emotionally, the ASMR condition elicits positive feeling about these trigger noises. This response to auditory stimuli resembles misophonia due to the strong sound-emotion relationship further magnified by the similarity of trigger noises. As the body of research on these phenomena grows, it will become plausible to study any relationship between ASMR and misophonia. Their parallels outweigh their differences at this point. The similarities may indicate that ASMR is the positive aspect of the same syndrome as misophonia (which would be a negative aspect).  
Maladaptive Conditions of Decreased Sound Tolerance 
Among the variations in sound signaling and processing, one group of disorders 
present with  symptoms are closely related (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001). In fact, the 
treatment protocol for these pathologies is often the same. These conditions include tinnitus, phonophobia, hyperacusis, and misophonia. Tinnitus once was a blanket term for tinnitus, hyperacusis, and misophonia. Even recent work still can use the terms interchangeably. Tinnitus does, however, have a unique grouped symptomology. It is a condition typically brought on by mechanical damage to the inner ear. The brain responds

7 
 to the damage by producing a psychosomatic tone the individual perceives to hear. 
Phonophobia is often a complementary condition that shares some characteristics with 
misophonia  (Asha'ari & Mat Zain, 2010). Phonophobia is the fear of a sound or sounds 
and is a con dition often confused with misophonia (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001). In this 
case, the symptomatic difference is between two reaction emotions. For phonophobia, fear is the characteristic response emotion. For misophonia anger is the characteristic respo nse. One of the most influential findings in misophonia research is the importance in 
determining ways to separate individuals with hyperacusis and misophonia diagnostically. These two conditions are often confused due to similarity of symptom presentation. Hyperacusis, as a pathology, can be described as a maladaptive emotional reaction to the volume of an environmental sound. Typically, this occurs through damage to the ear. The previously described sound disorders are important to the study of misophonia, due to the number of traits that are similar enough to create a potential for misdiagnosis. None is closer than hyperacusis which can present in the same way as misophonia with only a difference in sound trigger to distinguish the one from the other in many assessments. Hyperacusis occurs due to volume of any sound. Misophonia occurs due to the timbre of a specific sound at any volume. 
Theories Associated with Misophonia 
Many hallmark theories are in the process of being tested related to the 
misophonic condition and many more are yet to be tested ( Brout et al., 2018; Dozier, 
2015; Kumar et al., 2017 ; Taylor, 2017;  Webber et al., 2014). Among them are cognitive

8 
 theories of neuroplasticity and behavioristic classical conditioning. The Jastreboffs have 
studied misophonia in this way. The origins of the Jastreboffs’ first conceptualization is heavily influenced by the theory of neuroplasticity, which features prominently in their clinical work on a range of sound disorders (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001). Misophonia is treated somewhat like a bad habit, in the theory of neuroplasticity. Misophonia is viewed as a maladaptive reflex in need of re- training. Reflexes are a prompted behavioral 
or physiological reaction executed without conscious thought ( Pavlov, 2010) . Over time, 
the concept of the neuroplasticity element of misophonia has become a component in a greater theory which merges with work by other clinicians (Dozier, 2015), as the focus of several clinicians has been on applying the broader concept of classical conditioning to misophonia (Dozier, 2015; Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2002).  
Classical conditioning, through associative learning, makes for a useful theor y to 
begin implementing treatments with newly described conditions. The Jastreboff (2002) model of misophonia reasons that the cause of the sound sensitivity syndromes occurs in individuals with unusually active or embellished connections between their auditory processing (hearing), limbic processing (emotion), and autonomic nervous system (which controls organs and glands). This theory may ultimately contribute to categorizing the sound sensitivity conditions as maladaptive incarnations of ASMR. Dozier (2015) focuses on the stimulus-response theory to inform his approaches to the condition and treatments. In his practice, Dozier implements a behavioristic framework attributing misophonia to conditioned responses or reflexes no different from Pavlovian conditioning

9 
 (Dozier, 2015; Pavlov, 2010). Though the classical conditioning approach is efficient for 
treatment, this focused attention may slow investigation into other aspects of the disorder  
(Palumbo et al., 2018) . The focus on immediate care may be prevent ing the finding of 
more helpful and specific therapies. Recently, leaky sensory gating and poor cognitive 
control have been implicated in misophonia stimulus transduction (Zabelina et al., 2015), 
and may provide different treatment pathways.  
Misophonia: Di ssenting Perspectives  
 Interest in misophonia has not translated into agreement over its place in 
psychology, psychiatry, or audiology  (Palumbo et al., 2018) . The status of its 
classification as a disorder does not have unanimous support (Jastreboff & Jas treboff, 
2001; Schröder et al., 2013; Taylor, 2017). Not everyone is in consensus about the level of importance misophonia has or where it belongs diagnostically (Taylor, 2017; Webber 
et al., 2014). One point, brought up by Asha’ari et al. (2010), is that there is an 
interrelation between misophonia, phonophobia, and hyperacusis. Specifically, 
misophonia and phonophobia can be brought on by the initial development of 
hyperacusis which would weaken the independence of origin which helps to define 
discrete di sorders. The Jastreboffs also do not necessarily support the classification of 
misophonia as independent (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2002). These arguments and research into the potential comorbid relationships of these sounds disorders are shaping the future of misophonia treatment (Webber et al., 2014).

10 
 Though identification of misophonia as an extension of obsessive-compulsive 
disorder is a concept waning in popularity, the effects of this research area in misophonia 
will be present for the foreseeable future (Schröder et al., 2013) . Instruments adapted 
from assessments for obsessive compulsive disorder have been used as a basis and 
inspiration for early misop honia assessment construction. This relates to the current study 
as the instrument used, MisoQuest, is based on criteria and items from an Obsessive-
Compulsive disorder ( Siepsiak et al., 2020a) . Going forward, it is worth remembering 
that many scales for m isophonia originate from obsessive compulsive disorder scales. 
Instruments with such an origin may require further assessment as the body of research expands. Fortunately, other perspectives are also used to investigate misophonia.  
The research indicating  potential for genetic influence in the development of 
misophonia is sparse, but has enough merit to support further study ( Fayzullina et. al., 
2015) . In a hereditary case study, a fifteen -m ember family was found to have a 100% rate 
of misophonia (Sanchez & Silva, 2018). Twelve members completed self- report 
questionnaires on their symptoms and on other potentially linked conditions. The 
questionnaire scores for obsessive compulsive traits, misophonic emotion (e.g., anger, 
revulsion, anxiety), and depression were recorded at rates above 25% --an incidence 
greater than expected. Equally as important as the general comorbid traits were the 
reports of specific trigger sounds. The trigger sounds were not all ubiquitous in the family 
but fell within the categories determined in prior research (e.g., mouth sounds, pen 
clicking etc.).

11 
 The study does have several weaknesses, in particular the small sample, yet the 
reasoning for it is relevant. A growing number of conditions and attributes across 
domains are found to have genetic influences, including misophonia ( Fayzullina et. al., 
2015) . Identifying the impact of genetics on any psychological or physiological response 
is an important enough component to substantiate investigation. At least one large 
investigation by 2 3andMe has found an associated gene for misophonia, TENM2 
(Baumgartner & Wides, 2019;  Fayzullina et al., 2015 ). TENM2 is one of a family of 
genes coding for teneurin,  which is an important lipid bilayer protein linked to various 
cellular functions includin g the development of synapses (connections between neurons 
in the brain) (Baumgartner & Wides, 2019; Mosca et al., 2012).  
The State of Research  
 As of spring 2021, the literature is only beginning to contain studies of larger 
samples ( Siepsiak et al., 2020a).  Disputes over the importance or existence of misophonia 
as a construct are still not resolved satisfactorily ( Taylor, 2017) . Jastreboff (2015) noted 
that the rate of misophonia as a psychiatric pathology (2%) differed in prevalence to the 
rate of misophonia symptoms. This further complicates the reported rates of incidence. 
However, new studies with larger sample sizes can begin to counteract the weaknesses of 
the studies with small sample sizes ( Jager et al., 2020) . Rouw et al. (2018) surveyed a 
group of online participants with misophonia ( N=300). Quek et al. (2018) and Siepsiak et 
al. (2020a) did two larger studies contributing to the cross-cultural investigation of 
misophonia. These studies both evaluate misophonia in clinical populations. Their

12 
 findings, along with the Amsterdam study of 575 participants with misophonia, are the 
beginning of more generalizable knowledge ( Jager et al., 2020; Quek et al., 2018; 
Siepsiak et al. 2020a) . 
 As described above, the body of research is relatively new ( Asha'ari & Mat Zain, 
2010; Schröder et al., 2013; Vanaja & Abigail, 2020) . As a consequence, a significant 
portion of the literature appears to be exploratory science. Few studies cover similar 
topics that overlap and those that do are currently without subs tantial support ( Daniels et 
al., 2020; Palumbo et al., 2018) . During this initial stage of observation and testing, 
smaller case studies and focused samples still provide an important base for exploring 
ideas, but most critically as an introduction to effe ctive treatments that are worth further 
testing in larger samples ( Vanaja et al., 2020) . Although it appears to be a jumbled 
picture, the evidence leading towards an understanding of misophonia will build through replication, incremental study, and studies with larger “n”  values.  
Misophonia in this study is conceptualized as a condition where trigger sounds 
e 
licit responding malevolent feelings. Applying such parameters to the construct agrees 
with previously discussed findings ( Daniels et al., 2020) . The aspect of interest is the 
characteristic or characteristics of sounds on a continuum of benign sound to trigger 
sound. A study conducted by Edelstein et al. (2013) analyzed common trigger noises and 
looked for themes. They found several important traits among trigger sounds. The most 
predominant finding was the importance of context for a trigger response. Trigger noises 
were indicated to be most intense when produced by a person with a close relationship to

13 
 the person with misophonia. A related findi ng indicated that there is a level of control 
occurring depending on context as trigger sounds did not affect as many people with 
misophonia when the trigger sounds were made by infants or animals. Interestingly, a 
category of sounds that was on the list often are used in music: ticking clock sounds, bass 
sounds, and whistling were noted as trigger sounds. This study indicates that repetitive 
sounds are worse than non-repetitive sounds and human-made sounds with emotional 
context are triggering. These findi ngs paired with recorded, heightened, autonomic 
reactions to non- specifically aversive stimuli support investigation into the broader 
audiological responses of those with misophonia (Edelstein et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 
2019). In continuation of this prior study,  the present study adds to the growing body of 
work focusing on the relationship between diagnosed or self-reported misophonia cases 
and both biometric and psychometric responses to sound. This study will provide an early investigation into the prevalence of self -reported misophonia among the MTurk 
population and further examine the reaction to repetitive stimuli other than the specified trigger sounds. This will aid in building a model for the characteristics of a sound categorized as an influen tial stimulus or, more extremely, a misophonic trigger. 
Misophonic reactions will instigate a stress response ( Edelstein et al., 2013). These 
responses then have a deleterious effect on intelligence as described earlier with the study 
on financial hardship in an Indian farming population ( Mani et al., 2013) .

14 
 Fluid Intelligence and Potential Misophonia Associations  
Intelligence  
Intelligence, according to Sternberg (2012), is the success in dynamic and 
challenging environments based on some form of learned technique acquired by exposure to the relevant environment. There are many theories that produce an array of models and constructs to explain intelligence. This investigation draws on the Cattell– Horn –Carroll 
theory of intelligence. This widely accepted th eory breaks intelligence into two main 
categories: crystalized intelligence and fluid intelligence. Crystalized intelligence can be described as experience- based learning and retention of information. It is using facts and 
prior events to navigate current situations. Fluid intelligence can be employed in novel situations. Fluidity of intellect refers to flexible thought and problem solving. Fluid intelligence helps with novel problems and limited tools. For example, fluid intelligence would involve sticking  a laptop battery in the refrigerator if the computer overheats.  
In this framework, fluid intelligence is a component of cognitive problem solving 
(Sternberg, 2012). This type of thinking results in skilled adaptability to novel situations in a daily conte xt. A concrete example of the impact fluid intelligence can have is 
evidence that it is linked to increased economic and medical wellbeing. This construct is important, yet the abstract nature of it presents researchers with a challenge when measuring for its presence and magnitude in participants.  
Several measures have been developed to measure intelligence generally and to 
measure specific types such as fluid intelligence, as investigated by Salthouse and Pink

15 
 (2008). These measures often trace where in the brain activity occurs (Menon & Uddin, 
2010). Some scholars say a component of fluid intelligence is working memory (Salthouse & Pink, 2008). That is a somewhat disputed notion among the academic community (Apšvalka et al., 2019). Newer CHC theorists suggest that fluid intelligence is not the same as working memory, though the two are often so highly correlated that separating them may violate statistical collinearity. Although this is important, the present body of work does not contain adequate support  to treat fluid intelligence and 
working memory as separate constructs. At the very least, the presence of one regularly indicates the presence of the other. This entwined nature of fluid intelligence and working memory is the reason the construct of fluid intelligence will be measured in the current study using a task labeled with working memory.  
Misophonia and Fluid Intelligence  
The sampling in prior studies could indicate an association between misophonia 
and intelligence. A study in Florida obtained a sample of individuals with misophonia from a university population (Wu et al., 2014). A higher rate of misophonia was found in this sample, compared to studies sampling from other populations such as those from clinical settings (Siepsiak et al., 2020a). T his could be an indicator that misophonia has a 
relationship with fluid intelligence. Additionally, this would relate to the established link between academic pursuit and fluid intelligence which has been examined (Kaufman et al., 2009). This could indicat e an association among academics, fluid intelligence, and 
misophonia. Should such a connection be revealed, examination into the impact of

16 
 underlying structures that simultaneously affect both fluid intelligence and misophonia 
may be found. Leaky sensory gating is a phenomenon that should be examined as a potential indicator or cause of elevated fluid intelligence and risk factor for misophonia. Leaky sensory gating is a phenomena which has been implicated in creative thought, similar to fluid intelligence problem solving. It is characterized by poor attentional control which allows more environmental information to permeate thoughts which generate creativity. Both leaky sensory gating and fluid intelligence have significant links to the salience network of the brain whereby stimuli are sorted and additional networks are engaged.  
There have been some mixed results in studies connecting misophonia and fluid 
intelligence (Jager et al., 2020). Several researchers argue over the definition of misophonia and addit ionally do not agree on the types of intelligence that may be 
associated. This means that intelligence among the population with misophonia may be 
elevated, average, or below average and vary between forms, because the definitions of intelligence used in the current research are not similar. This perceived discrepancy in definition causes a mistrust in the measures used to determine misophonia. The concern is that the current instruments are not equipped to differentiate between conditions such as hyperacus is, misophonia, tinnitus, and other sound sensitivity conditions. Therefore, 
the construct validity of misophonia studies may require investigation and refinement. Jager et al. (2020) excluded nearly 30% of their initial pool of potential participants due to the presence of similar conditions. The group further relates that the indeterminate

17 
 nature of the sample groups (caused by instruments measuring related syndromes) 
involved in prior study could weaken the evidence produced. These researchers indicate that prior findings linking misophonia to fluid intelligence may be due to a comorbid or 
analogous diagnosis, like Asperger’s or obsessive -compulsive disorder (Jager et al., 
2020; Wu et al, 2014). These findings indicate a need for measurement of reactions to auditory stimuli during cognitive tasks linked to fluid intelligence. The involvement of this type of assessment can start with the n -back task. The n -back task is an exercise 
whereby participants are exposed to a series of stimuli at short intervals (often a second) and then are prompted to determine if a designated stimulus is the same as one relayed “n” number of stimulus exposures ago.  
Misophonia, Intelligence, and Leaky Sensory Gating  
Some experiments are building evidence for the nature of misophonic reactions 
(Ansusinha et al., 2018). One study indicates there may be a difference in reaction to 
misophonic triggers during visual n- back tests and auditory n -back tests. This indicates a 
difference in disruption based on senses utilized. The use of the n -back for this purpose 
refines the areas of interest anatomically. The construct validity has changed somewhat over the years. Initially, as the name implies, the n -back task of working memory was set 
to measure working memory. Since then, the construct of measure has changed to fluid intelligence. These investigations provide substantive evidence for systematic study of performance during working memory tasks under many intensities and qualities of sensory stimulation. The importance of investigating fluid intelligence or intelligence in a

18 
 sample with misophonia is relevant. The outcome of study will remove confusion and 
uncertainty about the prior  investigations with uncertain construct validity (Jager et al., 
2020).  
Music and Misophonia Trigger Sounds  
Music, among individuals, is sought after commonly as an entertainment or a 
strong need, it can be seen as a motivator for behavior (Schäfer, 2016). Music as a 
motivating force is pervasive in many social environments intentionally modifying behavior and affecting emotional regulation (Schäfer, 2016). Music is readily available and often has strong impacts on emotional states highlights the importan ce of 
investigating the overall effects of listening to fluid intelligence. The influence of music in every society and on many people indicates it is a sound that regularly elicits emotional or valent responses.  
For example, in an empirical study on the effect of music valence on lottery 
behaviors, researchers implemented several music environmental conditions which produced more aggressive gambling behavior in participants (Schulreich et al., 2014). Happier music inclined participants to select higher risk opportunities. These results drew attention to the relationship between mood and cognitive or intelligence influenced situations. Opinions and attitudes concerning risk, which are addressed in the cumulative prospect economic theory, can be modified wit h exposure to musical influence. The 
happier participants, in the happy music condition, became gutsy and chose to engage in

19 
 riskier behaviors with more frequency than the groups with less happy participants and 
sad music.  
The impact of music valence may have on people day -to-day may be even greater 
than a single study suggests as everyone constantly cognitively engages in action and choice. Another study examined the influence polysensory stimulation can have on stimulus response (Chang et al., 2015). Sig ht, touch, and smell are all senses that may 
intertwine and invoke varied responses to a stimulus. For example, substantial variation in the perception of happiness and sadness in a song was based on if the listener had their eyes open or closed. This stud y found relationship between sight and musical perception. 
Feelings were more intense when the eyes were open regardless of whether the songs were happy or sad. These findings indicate that environmental experiences that may be perceived as mono -sensory co uld be poly -sensory fusions with strong cognitive 
implications.  
Five sound characteristics intertwine into the phonic form understood to be music. 
These important particles of composition include melody, rhythm, dynamics, tempo, and timbre (Hebert & Peretz , 1997). Melody is pitch clusters minimally separated by time -
space. Rhythm is sound and silence expressed in alternation through time. Dynamics are the loudness or stress applied to any tone produced. Tempo is the rate or speed music is performed. Timbre is the textural group of tones and overtones produced that is unique to 
the object making the sound. Of the five elements, timbre may be more elusive to understand conceptually. Timbre is why a violin and a xylophone sound different even if

20 
 the pitches the y produce are equivalent. This textural element is not emphasized. Focus is 
commonly on the other four elements for the purposes of music performance education.  
Music has an effect on emotion, perception, and action (Chang et al., 2015; 
Schäfer, 2016; Schulreich et al., 2014). Many components of sound, silence, and 
organization combine when music is produced (Hebert & Peretz, 1997). Each musical element has a potentially different impact on neural processing. For example: evidence collected by Hebert and P eretz indicates long -term memory encoding and retrieval for 
melody may be stronger than that of rhythm. Such a variance in impact creates incentive to test as many elements of sound as possible.  
Emotion and Music  
The neural pathways for emotion and music have been mapped (Schaefer, 2017). 
These trails are very close together possibly explaining the paired emotional response to 
music. The current study explores whether there is still a mild generalized sensitivity to 
sound without specifying any particular emotion. The aim is to build a profile of what misophonic trigger noises can be and what features are most important in their makeup. This includes sounds across auditory domains from environmental noises, person-attributed bodily noises, and music. The emotion attached to music indicates music 
should be examined as a stimulator and influencer on thought and cognition emotionally and logically. Emotion often pairs with physiological responses such as hormone shifts.

21 
 Emotion in Misophonia trigger response  
The nature of the emotional response to misophonic triggers indicates a varied 
hearing to emotion structure in the brain (Moller, 2011). There are two related events in 
this to misophonia. First, both misophonic tri ggers and music have repetitive qualities 
(Margulis, 2013a ). This should be compared with music, a sound commonly responsible 
for intense emotions which is currently understudied as a potentially significant 
misophonia stimulus. Secondly, humans are commonly the ones producing the music 
which also fits as a factor in misophonia triggers. 
Misophonia Triggers and Music Similarities 
 Edelstein et al. (2013), investigated the biometric response of individuals with and 
without misophonia in the presence of an array of trigger sounds. Results indicated that 
those with misophonia have higher skin conductance responses to sound stimuli. Thi s 
supports the idea that those with misophonia are more sensitive to many sounds. 
Examples of the sounds used included: pen clicks, slurping, and chip bag crinkling. These 
sounds are often repetitive and have a human origin. Importantly, when asked about 
whether individuals were more concerned with repetitive sounds, over eighty percent of 
the sample indicated they were more influenced by repetitive sounds. Music can share 
several similarities with the misophonia trigger noises (Hebert & Peretz, 1997) . Musi c 
also is commonly human controlled and can have repetition. Furthermore, music is a 
strong emotional influencer. These attributes make music a good test sound for 
misophonia. In the current study, two variants of the same tune will be used as sound

22 
 stimuli. One song will repeat the same melody will no significant variation. The other 
song will technically play the same tune, but there will be complex additions and 
harmonies which will ensure the song does not repeat during the n- back task.  
Employed Theoret ical Framework  
This study works from a reductionist perspective and utilizes both a descriptive 
and comparative approach. Reductionism is a philosophy that investigates phenomena by 
looking at the whole of the phenomena of interest and then assessing parts at more refine d and basic levels (Barendregt & Van Rappard, 2004). The r eductionist perspective, 
in this study, is implemented when conceptualizing the range of sound stimuli and determining the specific element under examination in this current study, repetitiveness. The comparative nature of the study provides the necessary information to begin constructing part of a model for sound stimulus response in those with misophonia. Reductionism is not always considered the best practice with behavioral research, which has led to concerns about the overemphasis of reductionism in neural and behavioral research (Krakauer et al., 2017). Exploration of observed events within the scope of psychology and neuroscience, often requires a variety of methodologies for accurate evaluatio n cases. For newer phenomena, such as misophonia, reductionist methods are 
not without merit. The rigorous structure and strong link between action and biology is a critical initial step which may lead to later expansion of ideas where other perspectives are appropriate (Krakauer et al., 2017).

23 
 Such an approach appears best when considering the prior work on misophonia 
and its characteristics ( Schröder et al., 2019). The prior literature has examined 
misophonia from several approaches including the neurobiological and survey self-
reports (Schröder et al., 2019;  Wu et al., 2014). Progress in understanding misophonia 
has been focused on therapy, comorbidity, symptoms, neural behavior and incidence as 
reported by Cavanna and Seri (2015). Research on misophonia is sparse on several topics, though it is expanding in general. The literature has not thoroughly examined the response to the many common environmental sounds such as wind, rain, music or motors 
(Schröder et al., 2019). Utilizing a comparative framework,  this study will begin to 
uncover the nature of the misophonia and sound relationship and build toward a detailed model of the relationship between misophonia and sound triggers. A comparative approach is appropriate for this study based on the incomplete assessment of misophonia sound response. with respect to sound stimulus, neurobiology, and psychological profile 
(Schröder et al., 2019).  
There has been little inquiry into the nature of how those with misophonia 
t
ransduce the wider spectrum of sound. One possibility is the findings associating 
misophonia with peripheral nervous system variation and salience network linkages 
(Schröder et al., 2019). This current study we are implementing focuses on a single element of emotionally charged sound (repetitiveness) to begin building a base for the characteristics of misophonic stimulus and neutral stimulus outside of established trigger sounds. Prior findings have generally characterized response to trigger, benign, and

24 
 irritating sounds like the work by Schröder et al. (2019). Results from the work of 
Schröder et al. indicate that sound stimulus responses in those with misophonia may 
differ from those without misophonia . Furthermore, investigations with stimuli other than 
trigger sounds have been sparse. This cur rent study aims to begin a systematic 
identification of sound characteristics that may be influential across a spectrum of sound 
stimuli. Sound stimulus during the fluid intelligence task will further clarify existing 
theories about the sensitivity of hear ing in those with misophonia symptoms ( Schröder et 
al., 2019). Measurement  of reactivity to musical sound repetition will broaden or refine 
the scope of potential impactful sounds to those with misophonia. The current study will address several gaps. First ly, sampling for rates of occurrence in online populations is 
underdone ( Lourenco  and Tasimi,  2020). Secondly, a relationship between fluid 
intelligence and misophonia will be investigated. Thirdly, two types of music stimulus (repetitive, and rhapsodic) will be applied as a stressor for assessing the impact musical complexity has on fluid intelligence task completion in individuals with misophonia. Each element is an addition to research that has not previously been investigated. 
Research Objective  
 The current study demonstrate s whether music is a stimulus that impacts fluid 
intelligence function in individuals with misophonia more than the general population. Additionally, this study generated  data for the role of repetitive versus rhapsodic music 
on both individuals with misophonia and without misophonia during working memory tasks. Through these analyses , several questions were answered  including: 1) What was

25 
 the rate of misophonia in a Mechanical Turk population; 2) Was  there a different 
response to mus ical complexity on functionality during fluid intelligence tasks in 
individuals with misophonia  and those without .  
 The results from this study could inform workplace and educational 
environmental design decisions by individual students and workers as wel l as educators 
and managerial professionals. The thesis outcomes could provide usable evidence of the 
effect music complexity has on fluid intelligence task scores. This evidence could also provide information on the toll various auditory environments can have on intelligence performance in individuals with misophonia.  
Hypotheses  
 The hypotheses of the study were as follows:  
Rate of Misophonia Incidence  
Hypothesis one. Misophonia will be  recorded in the sample population at rates 
within statistical expectation for a condition estimated to occur in 15 -20% of the 
population.  
Environmental Element Impact  
Hypothesis two. The individuals testing in heavily noise -polluted environments 
were expected to have  reaction time scores on the n -back task  that could be predicted 
from the MisoQuest score. 
 There are three sound stimulus conditions in the design: no music, simple  music, 
complex  music.

26 
  
 Hypothesis t hree. The individuals testing in heavily noise -polluted environments 
will have lower accuracy and reaction time scores on the n -back task than in quiet 
environments. 
N-back Reaction Speed Score  
Hypothesis four. The misophonia group will score higher on reaction time for the 
fluid intelligence task in the music free condition than the group without misophonia or 
the groups with misophonia and the simple or complex sound conditions.  
Hypothesis five. The misophonia group will score lower on the reaction scores of 
fluid intelligence ta sk in the rhapsodic music condition than the non- misophonia group.  
Hypothesis six. The misophonia group will score lower on the fluid intelligence 
task reaction speed score in the simple music condition as compared to the non-misophonia group.  
Hypothesis seven. The misophonia group will score lower on the fluid 
intelligence task reaction speed score in the simple music condition than in the complex music condition. 
Hypothesis eight. There will be a positive relationship between the misophonia 
score and the reaction speed of the fluid intelligence task in the music free condition. There will not be a positive relationship between misophonia score and fluid intelligence task score in either the simple condition or the complex condition.

27 
 N-back Accuracy  
Hypo thesis nine. The misophonia group will score higher on accuracy for the 
fluid intelligence task in the music free condition than the group without misophonia or 
the groups with misophonia and the simple or complex sound conditions.  
Hypothesis ten. The misophonia group will score lower on the accuracy of fluid 
intelligence task in the rhapsodic music condition than the non- misophonia group.  
Hypothesis eleven. The misophonia group will score lower on the fluid 
intelligence task accuracy score in the simple mu sic condition as compared to the non-
misophonia group.  
Hypothesis twelve. The misophonia group will score lower on the fluid 
intelligence task accuracy score in the simple music condition than in the complex music condition. 
Hypothesis thirteen. There will  be a positive relationship between the misophonia 
score and the accuracy of the fluid intelligence task in the music free condition. There will not be a positive relationship between misophonia score and fluid intelligence task score in either the simple condition or the complex condition.  
These findings  may demonstrate that the group with misophonia  have higher 
general n -back task scores, which can add support to the theory that fluid intelligence is 
elevated in individuals with misophonia. The findings  may  also demonstrate that the 
repetition of music, or exposure to music more greatly affect the performance of the misophonic group, which would support the theory that leaky gating may be associated

28 
 with sound sensitivity conditions like misophonia. Furthermore, the repetitive music may 
harm  n-back performance more due to the similarity between repetitive music and 
repetitive nature of trigger noises already described (Margulis, 2013a). Additionally, assessment of prevalence of misophonia in the Mechanical  Turk working population 
could further establish a baseline of expected population rates in an epidemiological sense. These questions have been proposed as untapped areas of inquiry in academic 
discussion over the last several years ( Cavanna & Seri, 2015).

29 
 Method  
Participants  
For this study, 245  participants  (N = 245)  were recruited from the Mechanical 
Turk (MTurk), a crowd -sourcing task site (Moss et al., 2020). A study that has sampled 
from MTurk populations report consistent percentages for the major demographics over 
time. With these figures in mind, expected sample demographics reflect a substantially more diverse sample than would be expected in a study performed with community samples from the local region (U.S. Census, 2010). This  MTurk stud y included  63% male 
participants, 35.9% female participants, 0.4% non -binary, and income was represented 
somewhat proportionally. Income  breakdowns for five  ranges  of the sample revealed that 
most participants earned withing the lower three categories. The participant percentages for household income included  22.5% of participants with lower  incomes (under 
$20,000), 32.6% of participants with incomes over $40,000 but under $59,999, 19.9% of participants with incomes over $60,000 but under $79,999, 15.9% of participants with 
incomes over $80,000 but under $99,999, and 9.1% of participants with household income of $100,000 or more. In order to better engage participation by those who would 
be in the misophonia group, advertising aimed at them was to be employed. As previously mentioned, estimates of misophonia in the population, 15%, require a larger sample size to increase validity (Siepsiak et al., 2020a).  Of sampled par ticipants, 81% 
reported living in the United States with the largest group, 11.6%, reporting residence in the state of California. Within the sample 15.6% reported living outside the United States.

30 
 Participants ages were predominantly under 40 years old wi th 30.1% between 19 and 28 
years of age, 43.5 % between 29 and 38 years of age, 15.6 % between 39 and 48 years of 
age,  8% between 49 and 59 years of age,  2.9% were 60 years old or more.  
Design        
This comparative study used a 2 (misophonia and non-misophonia) x 3 (no sound, 
repetitive music, and rhapsodic music) factorial ANOVA design. Accuracy and speed of 
task completion in the n- back test were the dependent variables to determine the impact 
of the group difference (misophonia, no misophonia), and the treatment with random order assignment (no music, repetitive music, and rhapsodic music). Separate 2X3 
ANOVAs were conducted for each of the two dependent variables.  
Measures and Materials  
Fluid intelligence was measured using an n -back task of working memory (Jaeggi 
et al.,  2010). In a prior study, this task has been found to have predictive value for fluid 
intelligence. The task required participants to view a series of objects and produce recall 
of objects viewed at a defined time (i.e., writing  the letter they saw three objects ago). 
Trials consisted of exposure to twenty letters. Each visual exposure lasted for 500 milliseconds. The response window duration was for 3000 milliseconds after the stimuli response. The reaction times are recorded in  milliseconds and were assessed as group 
mean scores during analysis. Incorrect responses are separated into two categories. The first occurs when the participant signals the presence of a letter seen immediately prior to the most recent letter stimulus wh en it is false. This is known as a “False Alarm.” The

31 
 other incorrect response occurs when the participant misses the opportunity to indicate 
that a presented stimulus letter was previously presented immediately before the last stimulus. This is referred to as a “Miss.” The errors and speed were used as straight measures during analysis.  
The sound conditions employed during the n-back task include a condition 
without sound, a condition with a repetitive recording of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star , and 
a complex or rhapsodic music condition with an excerpt from Mozart’s variations 
(Mozart, 1781) . The tunes were set for the same duration and both share the same 
melodic structure and instrumentation. These attributes remove potential conflicting factors such  as duration effects, melodic variation influence, valence difference 
preferences, and timbre difference. Potential auditory confounds are addressed in the following section. 
Confounding variables 
Accompanying the tasks were questions about environmental noise and to 
confirm exposure to auditory stimulus for each task from their device speakers (See Appendix E). The environmental noise question used a 0-10 point scale and asked, “On a scale from 0 -10 with 0 being silent and 10 being very loud, how loud would you rate the 
environment you are in right now?” An additional question about distracting environment was asked to assess the level of environmental contamination a participant experiences. This question was also on a 0 – 10 scale with 0 being not distracting and 10 being extraordinarily distracting. The technology check question was yes/no and framed thusly,

32 
 “During the previous task could you hear noise from your device’s speaker(s)? (Y/N)”. 
These possible confounding variables were correlated with the score on the dependent variable, fluid intelligence, to see if they had an effect.  If they do, they would be included as co -variates in the main analyses.  
To determine the participants’ misophonic status, the study employed the 
misophonia questionnaire, Mi soQuest ( Siepsiak et al., 2020a; See Appendix F) . The 
survey uses 14 items and has had superb, reported reliability ( a = 0.96). These items are 
based on a five-point Likert scale with (1 = I definitely do not agree; 2 = I do not agree; 3 = Hard to say; 4 = I agree; 5 = I definitely agree). Of particular value were the items 
which separate misophonia from other conditions. An example from Siepsiak et al., 
(2020) : “I find some quiet sounds unbearable” separates misophonia from tinnitus (Table 
1). Scoring for this study was based on prior research (Siepsiak et al., 2020b). The 
recommended cutoff is for a score of 61 points or more out of a total of 70 points. The purpose of the instrument is to assess the presence of misophonia in the individual answering the questionnaire. This test has dichotomous results and is not intended to determine intensity of symptoms.  
Demographic information was also recorded through a series of questions. These 
demographics assessed population characteristics that included: income, age, sex, and geographic region of residence (See Appendix G).  The individuals who participated in the study were part of two waves of responses. The first wave did not have any advertising targeting misophonia. The second

33 
 wave did have advertising that targets individuals with misophonia. Each wave was 
constructed so sampling would be equal across regions and without replacement. There are two reasons for the dual wave. Firstly, one portion of the dual wave was designed to attempt to reach an increased number of respondents that would be classified in the misophonia group. This was accomplished by targeted advertisement f or one sample 
attempt. This was done to ensure adequate sample of individuals with misophonia. The second reason for two waves was to sample the population without misophonia targeted advertisement for population characteristic descriptive assessment.  
Proc edure  
Participants who selected the H uman Intelligence Task (HIT)  on MTurk selected 
the survey and were taken to the informed consent page  (See Appendix A; Appendix B) . 
Once participants assented electronically, they were instructed to turn on a speaker de vice 
and find a quiet environment if possible. Following this, they were provided directions 
for the n -back task  on the Psytoolkit platform ( Stoet,  2010; 2017; See Appendix C ). 
Following a practice session of the task they were exposed to each of the three  n-back 
tasks in randomized order. To screen for contamination, participants provided responses to questions assessing the noise pollution present in the participant’s environment. This assessment used a 0 -to-10 ranking of environmental sound pollution, “O n a scale of 0 -to-
10 with 0 meaning no sound pollution and 10 meaning extreme sound pollution, how would you rate the sound pollution in your current environment?”  Two additional questions were used to assess the success of the treatment stimuli. One ques tion

34 
 ascertained speaker volume with an open -ended short answer response, “What volume 
level is your speaker set to?” A second question asked the participant to indicate if they 
heard a sound during each n- back trial, “Did you notice sound coming from your  
speakers during this n- back trial? (Y/N)”.  
In the interest of participant protection, individuals who chose to participate were 
provided a URL to the survey on Qualtrics where they then completed the questionnaire  
and answered demographic questiions . The se participants were provided a debriefing at 
the conclusion of the study  (See Appendix I) . This included providing information for 
support services in the event of an adverse reaction a participant may experience. The only identifiable information acquire d from the participants were completion codes that 
enabled proper monetary compensation via MTurk. All APA guidelines for ethics were followed (American Psychological Association, 2017; See Appendix J ).   
Results  
Preliminary Analyses  
A power analysis was r un to determine sample size for the study. A small effect 
size with .80 power and an alpha of .05 were used to estimate the sample needed for power. The necessary N for this  study was 215. This was determined with the Cohen 
power primer table  (Cohen, 1992) .  
Main Analyses        
Hypothesis One

35 
 The MisoQuest misophonia rate in the sample  was not found to be at the expected 
prevalence of 15 -20%. The sample recorded a rate of 4.7%  (n = 12) . This finding does 
not support the  first hypothesis .  
The low rate of participation from the group qualifying as having misophonia 
impacted the planned subsequent analyses. To increase power while attempting to 
maintain the purpose of the study, a median split of participants into two groups: those scoring lower on the MisoQuest Questionnaire and those scoring higher on the MisoQuest questionnaire was implemented. The following analyses were performed with these two groups.  
Hypothesis Two  
Reaction S core C ould B e Predicted M ostly From MisoQuest Score. A 
regression was run to ascertain the extent to which environmental confounds affected the variables of interest.  In hypothesis two, i t was predicted  that reaction speed score (Y) 
could be predicted mostly from MisoQuest misophonia score (X1), but background noise or environmental loudness level (X2), speaker volume (X3) and distractedness level (X4) were also assessed. A simultaneous regression analysis was used to test this hypothesis. The data were screened to test the assumptions of a multiple regression including the 
assumption of multicollinearity
. Results suggest that all assumptions were met; 
collinearity diagnostics for tolerance and VIF indicated that multicollinearity was not an 
issue when assessing the predictor variables. All predictor variables w ere entered 
simultaneously. Overall, the regression model testing these predictors was significant [ F

36 
 (4,244) = 1.8, p = 0.129; r = .17; Adjusted R2  = .01]. About 17% of the variance in 
reaction score can be explained by these predictors.    
When assessing each predictor individually, the results suggest that MisoQuest 
score is a significant predictor of reaction speed score [ t (239) = 2.44, p = .02; β  = .16]. 
The squared semi -part that estimated how much variance in reaction speed score was 
uniquely predict ed from MisoQuest score was sr2 = .156. Thus, about 16% of the 
variance in reaction speed score was uniquely predicted from MisoQuest score.  
Hypothesis Three 
Individuals Testing in Heavily Noise -polluted Environments Would Have 
Lower Reaction Speed Scores  on the N -back Task Than in Quiet Environments.  The 
regression additionally was run to examine the impact of e nvironmental factors on 
reaction speed. Environmental loudness was not a significant predictor of reaction speed 
score [ t (239) = - .536, p = .59; β = -.05]. The squared semi -part that estimated how much 
variance in reaction speed score was uniquely predicted from environmental loudness 
was sr2 = .034. Thus, about 0.3% of the variance in reaction speed score was uniquely 
predicted from environmental loudness. Environmental distractedness also was not a 
significantly predictor of reaction speed score [ t (239) = - .05, p = .96; β  = -.004]. The 
squared semi -part that estimated how much variance in reaction speed score was uniquely 
predicted from environmental distractedness was sr2= .003. Thus, about  .03% of the 
variance in reaction speed score was uniquely predicted from environmental 
distractedness . Speaker volume was not a significant predictor of reaction speed score [ t

37 
 (239) = - 1.00, p = .32; β = .17]. The squared semi -part that estimated how much variance 
in reaction speed score was uniquely predicted from  speaker volume  was sr2 = .064. 
Thus, about 0.6% of the variance in reaction speed score was uniquely predicted from 
speaker volume.  
Together these findings suggest that distractedness, speaker volume, and 
environmental loudness were not significant predictors of reaction speed score for this 
sample when together. However, MisoQuest score uniquely predicts more of the variance 
in reaction speed score than environmental loudness or distractedness. The findings support the treatment of the reaction time, accuracy, music exposures, and misophonia condition as without conflicting interaction variables. It was predicted  in the third 
hypothesis that individuals testing in heavily noise -polluted environments will have lower 
reaction speed  scores on the n- back task than those in quiet environments. The r eaction 
speed scores of those in the heavily noise polluted environments were seen to not have 
statistically significant differences in n -back task than those in quiet environments. This 
refutes the third  hypothesis. Null hypothesis retained.  
Hypothesis F our-Eight  
A between -subjects 2x3 factorial ANOVA  was conducted. Due to the low 
sampling of participants that qualified as having misophonia according to MisoQuest score, the  ANOVA was conducted based on a median split of the sample group. The 
dependent variable w as reaction speed  on the fluid intelligence task. Two independent 
variables 1) misophonia (misophonia and no misophonia) and; 2) three levels for musical

38 
 complexity (simple, complex, and without music) were tested to assess for differences in 
reaction speed  on the n- back task . The factorial ANOVA for reaction speed  addresses 
hypotheses four through eight .  
Hypothesis Four : The M isophonia G roup Will S core H igher on R eaction 
Speed for the F luid I ntelligence T ask in the M usic F ree Condition T han the G roup 
Without M isophonia or the G roups with M isophonia and the S imple or C omplex 
Sound C onditions.  This hypothesis was not supported. Participants in the complex 
music condition ( M = 750.26, SD = 229.69) did not have better reaction speed on the 
working me mory task than participants in either the simple music condition ( M = 744.20, 
SD = 254.91) or the null music condition ( M = 716.81, SD = 191.78).  
Hypothesis Five: The Misophonia G roup Will S core L ower on  Reaction 
Speed for the F luid I ntelligence T ask in the  Complex  Music C ondition than the 
Non-misophonia G roup.  This hypothesis was supported. Participants with low 
misophonia scores below the median ( M = 696.66, SD = 199.45) scored better (lower) on 
reaction speed score than participants with high misophonia scores above the median ( M 
= 783.15, SD = 254.92) . 
Hypothesis Six: The M isophonia G roup Will S core L ower on the Fluid 
Intelligence T ask Reaction S peed S core in the S imple M usic C ondition as C ompared 
to the N on-misophonia Group . This hypothesis was supported. Participants with low 
misophonia scores below the median ( M = 696.66, SD = 199.45) scored better (lower) on

39 
 reaction speed score than participants with high misophonia scores above the median ( M 
= 783.15, SD = 254.92).  
Hypothesis Seven:  The Misophonia G roup Will S core L ower on the Fluid 
Intelligence T ask R eaction S peed S core in the S imple M usic C ondition than in the 
Complex M usic C ondition . This hypothesis was supported. Participants in the complex 
music condition ( M = 750.26, SD = 229.69) di d not have better reaction speed on the 
working memory task than participants in either the simple music condition ( M = 744.20, 
SD = 254.91) or the null music condition ( M = 716.81, SD = 191.78).  
Hypothesis Eight: There Will B e a P ositive R elationship Between the 
Misophonia Score and the R eaction S peed of the fluid intelligence task in the music 
Free C ondition. There Will N ot be a P ositive R elationship B etween M isophonia 
Score and F luid I ntelligence T ask S core in E ither the S imple C ondition or the 
Comple x Condition.  This hypothesis was n ot supported. Participants in the complex 
music condition ( M = 750.26, SD = 229.69) did not have better reaction speed on the 
working memory task than participants in either the simple music condition ( M = 744.20, 
SD = 254.91) or the null music condition ( M = 716.81, SD = 191.78).  
In the ANOVA conducted for reaction speed , results indicate a significant main 
effect of misophonia  [F (5, 244) = 6.88, p = .009, partial η2 = .03]. Participants with low 
misophonia scores below the median ( M = 696.66, SD = 199.45) scored better (lower) on 
reaction speed score than participants with high misophonia scores above the median ( M 
= 783.15, SD = 254.92). The main effect of sound condition was found to be non-

40 
 significant [ F (5, 244) = .358, p = .70, partial η2 = .003; See Figure 1 ]. Also, the  
interaction effect  was non-significant [ F (5, 244) = .002, p = .998, partial η2 < .000] . 
 
Reaction Speed ANOVA  
 
Hypotheses Nine -Thirteen   
A between -subjects 2x3 factorial ANOVA was conducted. Again, the low 
sampling of participants that qualified as having misophonia according to MisoQuest 
score, caused the ANOVA to be conducted based on a median split of the sample group.  
A significant main effect of misophonia  was found [ F (5, 265) = 16.30, p < .001, partial 
η2 = .056] . Additionally, another significant main effect of sound condition was found [ F 
(5, 265) = 3.38, p = .035, partial η2 = .025] . There was also a n on-significant interaction

41 
 effect [F (5, 244) = .002, p = .998, partial η2 < .000] . Qualifying this analysis is an 
overall trend for low partial η2 values.  
Hypothesis Nine: The misophonia group will score higher on accuracy for 
the fluid intelligence task in the music free condition than the group without 
misophonia or the groups with misophonia and the simple or complex sound 
conditions . This hypothesis was not supported. Low misophonia scorers ( M = 7.07, SD = 
7.01) scored better on accuracy than participants with high misophonia scores regardless 
of condition ( M = 12.14, SD = 9.14) . 
Hypothesis Ten: The misophonia group will score lower on the accuracy of 
fluid intelligence task in the rhapsodic music condition than the non- misophonia 
group . This hypothesis was not supported. Particip ants in the complex music condition 
(M = 10.77, SD = 8.91) did not have better accuracy on the working memory task than 
participants in either the simple music condition ( M = 10.23, SD  = 8.82) or the null music 
condition ( M = 6.52, SD  = 6.40) . 
Hypothesis E leven: The misophonia group will score lower on the accuracy 
of fluid intelligence task in the simple music condition than the non- misophonia 
group . This hypothesis was supported. Across all conditions the misophonia group 
scored more poorly than the non- misophonia group ( M = 7.07, SD = 7.01) scored better 
on accuracy than participants with high misophonia scores ( M = 12.14, SD = 9.14) . 
Hypothesis Twelve: The misophonia group will score lower on the fluid 
intelligence task accuracy score in the simple music condition than in the complex

42 
 music condition . This hypothesis was not supported. The misophonia group in the 
simple music condition  ( M = 11.78, SD = 9 .58) scored better on accuracy than 
participants with higher misophonia in the complex condition ( M = 13.93, SD = 9.02) . 
Hypothesis Thirteen: There Will B e a P ositive Relationship B etween the 
Misophonia Score and the Accuracy  of the Fluid I ntelligence T ask in the M usic F ree 
Condition. There Will N ot be a Positive R elationship Between M isophonia S core 
and F luid I ntelligence T ask Accuracy  in E ither the S imple C ondition or the 
Complex C ondition.  This hypothesis was partially supported. The group higher in 
misop honia had worse error scores in the music free condition ( M = 7.83, SD = 6.41) , 
simple music condition  (M = 11.78, SD = 9.58), and complex music condition ( M = 
13.93, SD = 9.03).  
In this ANOVA results indicate a significant main effect of misophonia  [F (5, 
265) = 16.30, p < .001, partial η2 = .056]. Participants with low misophonia scores ( M = 
7.07, SD = 7.01) scored better on accuracy than participants with high misophonia scores 
(M = 12.14, SD = 9.14). A significant main effect of sound condition wa s found [ F (5, 
265) = 3.38, p = .035, partial η2 = .025]. Participants in the complex music condition ( M 
= 10.77, SD = 8.91) did not have better accuracy on the working memory task than participants in either the simple music condition ( M = 10.23, SD  = 8.82) or the null music 
condition ( M = 6.52, SD  = 6.40). These main effects were accompanied by a non-
significant interaction effect [ F (5, 244) = .002, p = .998, partial η
2 < .000].  
Additional Analyses

43 
 Due to the resetting of threshold in the main ana lysis, a split analysis of 
participants with upper and lower third MisoQuest scores was run. The intent was to 
intensify any differences between those scoring low on misophonia and those with higher MisoQuest scores. Results from these analyses  were not significant ly different from the  
median split analyses . 
Discussion   
Hypothesis One  
In the first hypothesis, it was expected that the rate of misophonia found in the 
Mechanical Turk sample would be around 20%. This was expected dure to prior 
population genetics study ( Fayzullina et al., 2015) . The current study did not directly 
support a rate of misophonia expected. One potential explanation for this outcome is that the instrument used to measure misophonia, MisoQuest, was developed under a more 
clinical environment ( Siepsiak  et al. , 2020a) . This may mean the instrument is most 
appropriate for identification of clinical level misophonia and not misophonia traits along a continuum. Future studies might use instrumentation designed to measure traits and categorize by levels for other studies looking at misophonia and intelligence performance.   
Hypothesis Two 
It was expected that  individuals testing in heavily noise-polluted environments 
would have reaction speed  scores on the n- back task  that could be predicted from the 
MisoQuest score. This hypothesis was supported. T he association between reaction speed

44 
 and MisoQuest score was examined in a regression analysis. The portion of reaction 
speed found to be associated with misophonia score was approximately 16%. The strong association between the two may be due to stabilit y of the constructs measured. Both 
misophonia and fluid intelligence are traits that are thought to have resilient features when measured under various conditions ( Jaeggi et al.,2010).  
Hypothesis  Three 
Initially, it was predicted that individuals testing in heavily noise -polluted 
environments would have lower reaction speed scores on the n- back task than in quiet 
environments. A regression was run to ascertain the impact that environmental factors could have on reaction speed scores. The individuals testing  in heavily noise -polluted 
environments did not have lower speed and reaction time scores on the n- back task than 
those in quiet environments. There are at least  two potential reasons for a result such as 
this. It is possible that the reactions speeds of participants were not impacted by 
environmental sounds due to resilience inherent in individuals that participate in the Mechanical Turk platform. Individuals that may be bothered by loud sounds during tasks like this one might not choose to engage in thes e activities. Another possibility  is that this 
is linked to the stability of measure associated with traits like fluid intelligence and misophonia and similar to h ypothesis t wo (Jaeggi et al.,2010).  
The misophonia group did not score higher on the working memory task in the  
music free condition than the group without misophonia. This result was also true in the simple ( repetitive) and complex (rhapsodic) sound conditions.

45 
 Hypothesis  Four   
Originally it was predicted that the misophonia group would score hi gher on 
reaction speed for the fluid intelligence task in the music free condition than  either  the 
group without misophonia or the groups with misophonia and the simple or complex 
sound conditions . A factorial ANOVA was run to compare misophonia and sound 
conditions with respect to reaction speed score. Hypothesis four was unsupported. The  
misophonia group scored  lower on the working memory task in the  complex  music 
condition than the non- misophonia group and did score better in the group without music, 
but the results were not statistically significant. Such a result may indicate that small differences in reaction speed may need to be treated differently in measurement.  
Hypothesis  Five  
It was expected that the misophonia group would score lower on the reaction 
speed scores of the fluid intelligence task in the complex music condition than the non-
misophonia group. This hypothesis was supported. The factorial ANOVA for reaction speed score was further exami ned for this hypothesis. The group with higher misophonia 
traits did not score as well as those with lower misophonia traits in the complex music condition. Originally, the reasoning for this outcome was tied to the suggestion that misophonia would increas e sensitivity to sound across the board. This hypothesis does 
indicate that those with misophonia would do worse on fluid intelligence tasks in environments with complex sounds than those without misophonia.  
Hypothesis  Six

46 
 The misophonia group w as predict ed to  score lower on the fluid intelligence task 
reaction speed score in the simple music condition as compared to the non- misophonia 
group. This hypothesis was supported. The factorial ANOVA for reaction speed score 
was investigated for this hypothesis. Those with higher misophonia scores did not react as quickly in the simple music condition as those with lower misophonia scores. Though this hypothesis was supported, the overall results may indicate different reasons behind the outcomes than were conceived originally.  
Hypothesis  Seven  
The higher  misophonia  trait group w as expected to  score lower on the fluid 
intelligence task reaction speed score in the simple music condition than in the complex music condition. This hypothesis was unsupported. Again, the factorial ANOVA for reaction speed score was examined for this hypothesis. Those with higher misophonia traits scored lower in the complex condition, but the difference was not significant. This 
outcome indicates that those with misophonia might not be impacted by complexity of sound. 
Hypothesis  Eight  
A positive relationship between the misophonia score and the reaction speed of 
the fluid intelligence task in the music free condition was expected. No positive 
relationship between misophonia score and fluid intelligence task score in either the simple condition or the complex condition was expected. This hypothesis was partially supported. Further exploration of the factorial ANOVA for reaction speed score was

47 
 conducted for this hypothesis. There was n o significant  positive relationship between 
misophonia and reactions speed for the music free condition. The same lack of positive 
relationship occurred for the other conditions, both simple and complex. The indication that reaction speed was overall worse might hint at neural regions implicated in the n -
back task. (Miró-Padilla et al., 2020 ). Individuals with higher misophonia traits might 
have differences in motor networks that can be differentiated by both the reaction speed and the accuracy scores. The next step might be to construct designs that parse out fluid intelligence related to speed, error, input, and decision- making as separate constructs. 
This style of design might pinpoint the specific locations of variation occurring in those with higher misophonia traits. 
Hypothesis Nine  
Originally, it was predicted that the high  misophonia tra it group would score 
higher on accuracy  for the fluid intelligence task in the music free condition than  either  
the group with low misophonia traits  or the groups with higher misophonia traits  and the 
simple or complex sound conditions . A factorial ANOVA w as run to compare 
misophonia and sound conditions with respect to reaction accuracy. Hypothesis nine was unsupported. Those with higher misophonia traits  scored worse on accuracy than those 
with lower misophonia traits  scored in each sound condition. It is possible this could be 
due to random sampling, though investigation into the reactions and processing should be considered. 
Hypothesis Ten

48 
 It was expected that the misophonia  trait group would score lower on the accuracy  
of the fluid intelligence task in the complex music condition than the low misophonia 
trait group. A factorial ANOVA was run to compare misophonia and sound conditions with respect to reaction accuracy. Hypothesis ten  was unsupported. The group with 
higher misophonia scores was not more accurate than the group with lower misophonia scores in the complex music condition. The cause of this may relate to sensory gating 
(Zabelina et al., 2015). The inability to block complex sound may have a greater 
cognitive, though not emotional, cost for those with misophonic traits than those with fewer misophonic traits.  
Hypothesis Eleven  
The higher  misophonia trait group w as predicted to  score lower on the fluid 
intelligence task accuracy  score in the simple music condition as compared to the low 
misophonia trait group. A factorial ANOVA was run to compare misophonia and sound conditions with respect to accuracy. Hypothesis eleven  was supported. The group with 
higher misophonia traits were less accurate in the simple sound condition than the group with lower misophonia traits.  This outcome does point to a difference in processing of 
information between those with higher misophonia inclination and those with lower misophonia inclination. This outcome may be due to disruption caused by auditory stimuli as predicted, but alternate explanations should also be considered. There could be 
a generalized motor disruption among those with misophonia traits that formed as a consequence of the misophonia pathways. This type of interference could be caused by

49 
 mimicry compensatory behaviors. There may be a small amount of constant inclination 
towards motor mimicry for environmental sounds that impacts reflexive motor efficiency in the n- back task ( Kumar  et al., 2021).  
Hypothesis Twelve  
The misophonia group w as expected to  score lower on the fluid intelligence task 
accuracy score in the simple music condition than in the complex music condition. A factorial ANOVA was run to compare misophonia and sound conditions with respect to accuracy.  Hypothesis twelve  was u nsupported. The higher misophonia trait group scored 
more accurately in the simple sound condition than in the complex sound condition as was expected , but this result was not significant.  This statistical insignificance might be  
due to the method of meas urement. Alternatively, the difference may mean that there is a 
small span of difference between sound conditions that is meaningful but constrained by 
physiologically dependent upper and lower limits (( Miró-Padilla et al., 2020 ). This 
would also explain the low effect sizes noted across the analyses.   
Hypothesis Thirteen  
A positive relationship between the misophonia trait score and the accuracy  of the 
fluid intelligence task in the music free condition  was expected . No positive relationship 
between misophonia trait  score and fluid intelligence task accuracy score in either the 
simple condition or the complex condition was expected.  A factorial ANOVA was run to 
compare misophonia and sound conditions with respect to accuracy. Hyp othesis thirteen  
was partially supported. There was no positive relationship between misophonia trait

50 
 scores and any of the three sound conditions: no sound, simple  sound, and complex sound 
conditions. This may be due to general disruption caused by misophonia pathway 
development. The intensity of the misophonia circuit may have caused typical relay development for fluid intelligence to be downregulated or disrupted ( Kumar  et al., 2021).  
In general,  it was found that those with more misophonia traits did not do as well 
on the fluid intelligence task than those with fewer misophonia traits. This may mean that those with misophonia underutilize some or all the areas involved in completing the n-back task. This evidence could direct further investigations into more specific  
neurological areas to determine where altered connectivity occurs. One such area to investigate may be the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as it is known as an important part 
of decision making and is linked to the n- back task ( Miró-Pa dilla et al., 2020 ). Another 
path to investigate is how individuals might be compensating. If those with misophonia score worse on fluid intelligence, then the next question is to investigate if they are compensating in a specific way. Furthermore, the ori ginal idea in this study was that there 
may be an association between higher fluid intelligence and misophonia (
Fayzullina et 
al., 2015; Kaufman et al., 2009 ; Wu et al., 2014). The current study does not support such a relationship, but perhaps looking at other factors such as resilience or creativity may provide more explanation for perceivable associations.  
The context for this study may have a substantial impact on the results. This study 
was originally designed as a laboratory experiment. The onset of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic changed the design as it was reformatted for online distribution. The use of

51 
 Mechanical Turk was employed as a means of accessing a population safely and with 
opportunity at a reasonable recruitment size. The change in design has  opened the study 
up to several internal validity threats. One such threat was attrition. In our study the rigorous need to exclude participants greatly changed the valid sample available. These reductions, though necessary in this case, display potential problems in measuring remotely and measuring via web. Of these problems, foremost are the contamination variables. Though these were accounted for in screening analysis and found to be nonsignificant, the possibility of impact on the outcomes increases whe n considering the 
small differences in reaction speed. Remedies for these weaknesses might include designs with more statistical power and fewer conditions. Interestingly, the lack of impact of environment on results may mean that studies in online environments with complex tasks may be usable in the future. This may be due to the increase in web interactions due to the pandemic.   
Further lines of inquiry   
Follow -up studies could be designed with a focus on smaller portions of the 
research question  or new l ines of investigation . With this current topic , sampling of the 
target population through support groups and other specialized organizations would provide a more powerful sample. In addition to the change in sampling, the task instruments may be used for m ore extended periods. More assessment data per 
participant may yield improved accuracy of cognition measurement. Another consideration for the measurements regards the reaction speed. It could be important to

52 
 apply a log transformation or factor out a neural reaction constant when measuring 
millisecond speeds ( Miró-Padilla et al. , 2020 ). Such a modification could highlight true 
differences that may be diluted in this current study.  Additionally, the inclusion of 
additional validated measures might provide a clear picture of the processes involved in 
misophonia and environmental sounds. The distribution of scores on MisoQuest describe a bell curve which, when considering the construction of the items, might indicate a spectrum . Changing to a spectrum perspect ive on misophonia might be most appropriate 
for future studies. Other additions might include recording ambient noise decibel in other iterations of this study.   
Though the hypotheses were largely only partially unsupported, this study does 
provide evidence of key information for this topic and this methodology. The topic evidence supports the existence of intense misophonia at population rates below 5%. The absence of support for a misophonia rate of 15-20% could be due to several causes. The MisoQuest instrument was developed in a clinical setting (Siepsiak et al., 2020a). This instrument, as mentioned, might target clinical levels to an extent which excludes its appropriateness for the current research questions.  
The lack of impact that environmental conditions have on the tests of intelligence 
suggest that either the Mechanical Turk population is resilient against environmental effects or that perhaps there is a trend toward working in quiet environments among Mechanical Turk workers.

53 
 New study questions could be focused on increasingly specific neural areas such 
as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, decision making networks, and  motor networks  
(Miró-Padilla et al., 2020. ; Kumar  et al.,  2021 ). Alternative measures to fluid 
intelligence could include measures of creativity, musicality, and resilience as each of 
these traits could be impacting outcomes for those with misophonia.

Debrief  
Thank you for your participation in this research study! Now that your participation is 
completed, we will describe the specific nature of the study  to you, why it was important, 
provide resources to answer any of your questions, and provide you with the opportunity to 
make a decision on whether you would like to have your data included in this study . 
 What  you should know about this study  
 This study measured fluid intelligence (flexible thinking) under auditory stress conditions 
(music complexity) in individuals with the sound sensitivity misophonia and those without that sound sensitivity. You were exposed to one of three sounds during the completion of the n -back 
task (which is used here to measure fluid intelligence). The conditions used in the study included: no music, repetitive music, and non -repetitive music. The technological questions you 
were asked about the sounds in your environment and technological specifications will be used to make sure there were no confounding noises (or account for any p resent) in the environment 
you were in during the task. The 14 questions asking about your responses to noise are used to determine if criteria for misophonia are met. The demographic questions were to assess how closely the participant sample matches what  we would expect when compared to the mTurk 
workforce.  
  We hope that this study will further aid in optimization of working and educational 
environments for the general population and to guide occupational interventions for individuals 
impacted by misopho nia. 
 
Please do not disclose research procedures and/or purpose to anyone who might participate in 
this study in the future as this could affect the results of the study.
