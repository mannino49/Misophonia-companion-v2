## ABSTRACT

Introduction: Misophonia, not yet classified within diagnostic manuals, triggers strong  emotional,  physiological,  and  behavioural  reactions to  specific  sounds.  This  study  examines  its  correlations  with  attention deficient/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  traits,  obsessive-compulsive traits,  and  autism-related  traits  in  adolescent  outpatients  with  nonpsychotic  disorders.  We  hypothesize  a  positive  association  between misophonic symptoms and these psychological traits.

Methods: This study was conducted at a Turkish psychiatric centre from January to July 2023 in adolescents aged 12-18. Parents completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient-Adolescent (AQ-Adolescent), and Conner's ADHD Parent Rating Scale-48 (CPRS-48), while the adolescent filled out the  Misophonic  Symptom  Checklist  (MCL)  and  Maudsley  ObsessiveCompulsive Inventory (MOCI). Using non-parametric statistical tests, the research found associations between the scales, with a total sample size of 348.

Results: Females  had  higher  scores  on  MCL.  There  is  a  negative correlation  between  AQ-Adolescent  and  MCL,  positive  correlations between MCL-MOCI and MCL-CPRS-48. In gender specific correlation analysis found that AQ-Adolescent and MCL were negatively correlated, MCL and MOCI were positively correlated in males. MCL, CPRS-48 and MOCI were positively correlated in females. In regression AQ-Adolescent, MOCI and CPRS-48 significantly predicted the levels of MCL.

Conclusions: Our  study  unveils  a  link  between  ADHD,  obsessivecompulsive  symptoms,  autistic  traits,  and  misophonic  symptoms  in adolescent psychiatric outpatients, highlighting sex differences.

## INTRODUCTION

Misophonia, while not formally recognized as a definitive diagnosis within the  International  Classification  of  Diseases  (ICD)  and  the  Diagnostic and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM),  is  characterized  by pronounced negative emotional (anger, disgust, distress), physiological (increased  heartbeat,  piloerection)  and  aggressive  (shouting,  yelling  or giving harm to the source of the misophonic sound, in a word trigger) or  aversive  (moving  away  from  the  source  of  the  trigger  or  not  being present at a place where a trigger could emerge) behavioural responses to certain auditory stimuli (1,2). Predominantly, these triggering sounds are generated by other individuals and encompass activities such as lip smacking, chewing, coughing, and respiration. Intriguingly, certain visual stimuli related to these sounds, such as the movement of lips, can also provoke misophonic reactions. While mild aversions to specific sounds, such  as  gum  chewing  or  slurping,  are  prevalent  among  the  general population, the experience of misophonia transcends mere discomfort. It can result in significant social impairments across domestic, academic, and professional environments. Furthermore, the condition may precipitate challenges in interpersonal relationships (3-5). From  a clinical perspective, neuropsychiatry professionals have postulated that  misophonia  might  be  categorized  as  a  neuropsychiatric  disorder. In contrast, audiological experts have suggested its inclusion under the umbrella  of  decreased  sound  tolerance  syndrome,  concurrently  with hyperacusis and phonophobia (1,6).

## Highlights

- · Misophonia is positively correlated with ADHD.
- · Misophonia is positively correlated with obsessivecompulsive traits.
- · Misophonia is inversely correlated with autistic traits.
- · There are sex differences on these relationships.

The  prevalence  of  misophonia  remains  inadequately  characterized, though findings from a myriad of studies suggest a range between 6% and 50% (7-11). The extensive variability observed in these prevalence rates can be attributed to disparities in study samples and the utilization of distinct scales or diagnostic criteria in assessing misophonia. Preliminary research posits the typical onset of misophonia around ages of 12 to 13 (12) and suggests potential hereditary factors (13).

Despite the ongoing debates between audiological and neuropsychiatric disciplines,  burgeoning  evidence  highlights  potential  associations  between psychological traits or manifestations and  misophonia.  Obsessivecompulsive disorders, agoraphobia, tic disorders, mood disorders, panic

disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic  disorder,  eating  disorder,  trichotillomania,  skin  picking, and autism spectrum disorders have been reported to have significant associations with misophonic symptoms (1,14-21). A study by Çolak et al. (22) delineated a positive correlation between aggression, trait anxiety, obsessions, neuroticism, somatic sensation amplification, and the severity of  misophonic  symptoms  in  patients  with  non-psychotic  psychiatric disorders. Rinaldi et al. found that adolescents with misophonia exhibited elevated levels of obsessive-compulsive traits when juxtaposed with their non-misophonic counterparts. Additionally, individuals with misophonia tend to experience heightened levels of depression and anxiety compared to those who do not have the condition.

In  the  present  study,  we  focused  on  three  specific  psychological  traits: Attention deficient/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  traits, obsessivecompulsive traits, and autism-spectrum traits. Our selection was predicated on three primary considerations: a) extant literature suggesting potential associations with misophonia, b) psychiatric conditions that exhibit higher prevalence among adolescent outpatients, and c) psychological traits whose associations with misophonia remain inadequately elucidated.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been postulated to have a potential association with misophonia, primarily due to symptomatology  overlaps,  such  as  the  recurrent  preoccupation  with triggers (analogous to obsessions) and subsequent avoidance behaviours (akin  to  compulsions)  (23,24).  While  there  are  distinct  differences  in the symptomatology of misophonia and OCD, underlying relationship between  these  two  conditions  is  plausible.  Numerous  studies  have identified  the  co-presentation  of  OCD  and  misophonia  in  both  adult and paediatric  populations  (21,23,25).  Furthermore,  there  has  been  a report  indicating  a  comorbidity  between  misophonia  and  Tourette Syndrome, a condition wherein OCD is notably prevalent, particularly in paediatric cases (26).

A connection between ADHD and sensory sensitivities is well-established (27,28), with misophonia often considered a form of sensory sensitivity by  various  researchers  (29,30).  In  one  particular  study,  approximately 5%  of  adult  participants  with  misophonia  were  found  to  also  have ADHD (31). Conversely, another research retrospectively examined the medical records of misophonic adults and contrasted them with those of individuals without misophonia. In this research, while rates of depression and  anxiety  disorders  were  elevated  in  childhood,  the  prevalence  of ADHD  did  not  appear  to  be  significantly  heightened  among  adults with misophonia (32). These debatable data indicate that relationships between ADHD and misophonia need to be investigated. Moreover, the relationship between subclusters of symptoms of ADHD -hyperactivity, attention deficits, and impulsivity- and misophonia does not have a place in current literature.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is also frequently associated with sensory sensitivities.  The  DSM-V  characterizes  over-responsiveness  to  auditory stimuli  as  a  feature  of  autism  (33).  However,  the  auditory  sensitivities linked to autism predominantly pertain to sounds that are loud, highpitched,  or  unexpected,  which  are  not  characteristic  of  misophonia (1,34).  While  several  case  reports  and  studies  aimed  to  explore  the relationship between autism and misophonia, findings remain conflicting (21,35).  Jager  et  al.  found  no  significant  association  between  autism and  misophonia  (31),  whereas  Claiborn  et  al.  observed  a  marginally increased prevalence of autism among individuals with misophonia (36). Importantly, from a neurobiological perspective, the involvement of the insular  cortex  and  the  salience  network  in  both  conditions  suggests  a potential interconnection (37,38).

In the present study, given the ambiguity surrounding the psychological basis of misophonia and the pressing need for comprehensive examination,  our  objective  was  to  explore  the  association  between levels of misophonic symptoms and various trait psychological variables. Specifically,  we  assessed  attention-deficit  and  hyperactivity  symptoms, obsessive-compulsive traits, and autism-related traits among adolescent outpatients  presenting  with  non-psychotic  psychiatric  disorders.  Our hypothesis  is  that  there  is  a  positive  correlation  between  levels  of misophonic  symptoms  and  the  levels  of  ADHD  symptoms,  obsessivecompulsive symptoms, and autism-spectrum traits.

## METHODS

## Participants

This study was conducted at a private psychiatric centre in Türkiye from January to July 2023. The objective was to recruit a sufficient number of outpatients  who  met  the  inclusion  criteria  as  determined  by  the  precalculated sample size. Eligible participants were patients aged between 12 to 18 years. Exclusion criteria  encompassed diagnoses of psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder,  and  alcohol  or  drug  related  disorders.  Additionally,  due  to the requirement for parents (either mother, father, or legal guardian) to complete  two  of  scales  employed  in  this  study,  patients  with  illiterate parents were also excluded. Total sample size was calculated by g-power program  (H1  rho 2 =0.05,  alfa  error  prob=0.05,  power=0.95  with  three predictor).  The  calculated  sample  size  was  335.  Informed  consent  was duly obtained from both the patients and their respective guardians. The ethical approval was obtained from Antalya Bilim University Social and Human Sciences  Ethical  Committee  (Approval  No:  2022/18,  Approval Date: 22.04.2022).

A total of 348 patients participated in the study, with females constituting 56%  of  the  sample.  The  mean  age  of  the  participants  was  14.34±1.56 years. Detailed sociodemographic characteristics are presented in Table 1.

In our sample, medication using distribution was unmedicated (21.8%, n=76), only tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) (0.6%, n=2), TCA+ antipsychotic (Ap)(0.9%,  n=3),  only  Ap  (4.3%,  n=15),  only  Noradrenaline  reuptake inhibitors (NRI) (2.6%, n=9), only Serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors  (SNRI)  (1.4%,  n=5),  SNRI+Ap  (0.6%,  n=2),  Selective  serotonin reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRI)  (44.3%,  n=154),  SSRI+Ap  (3.2%,  n=11),  only Methylphenidate (MPh) (15.2%, n=53), MPh+NRI (0.6%, n=2), MPh+Ap (2.3%,  n=8),  MPh+TCA  (0.6%,  n=2),  SSRI+MPh  (0.3%,  n=1),  Mirtazapine (0.9%, n=3), and SSRI+Mood regulators (0.6%, n=2).

## Procedure

Following a psychiatric evaluation conducted by a child and adolescent psychiatrist (one of the authors) and upon obtaining informed consent from  both  the  patient  and  their  parent,  the  researchers  completed  a sociodemographic data form. The Autism Spectrum Quotient-Adolescent (AQ-Adolescent)  and  Conner's  ADHD  Parent  Rating  Scale-48  (CPRS48)  were  administered  to  the  parent.  Concurrently,  the  Misophonic Symptom  Checklist  (MCL)  and  the  Maudsley  Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory  (MOCI)  were  presented  to  the  patient.  Eligible  patients completed  the  study  measures  in  a  singular  session,  which  coincided with  their  psychiatric  assessments  and  treatments.  This  study  received approval from the local ethics committee.

## Measures

Sociodemographic data form: The form, designed by the research team, was employed to gather pertinent information on the patients, including their age, sex, psychiatric diagnosis, and ongoing treatment. Additionally, data related to the parents such as age, occupational status, educational

background, family history of psychiatric diagnosis, hospitalization after delivery, and mode of delivery were also collected.

Autism Spectrum Quotient-Adolescent (AQ-Adolescent): The AQ was originally devised to screen for autistic traits or broad autism phenotype in adults possessing typical intellectual capacities. While the foundational construct  of  the  adolescent  version  aligns  with  that  of  the  AQ,  it  has adapted  to  facilitate  completion  by  parents  (39).  The  AQ-adolescent encompasses 50 items and five subdimensions: communication, social skills, imagination, attention to detail, and attention switching. The scale employs a 4-point Likert scale. However, during scoring, both 'strongly agree'  and  'somewhat  agree'  responses  are  assigned  a  score  of  one, while  'strongly  disagree'  and  'somewhat  disagree'  are  scored  as  zero. Consequently, the maximum achievable score on the scale is 50 points. The Turkish validity and reliability study was conducted by Çetinoğlu et al (40).

Conner's ADHD Parent Rating Scale-48 (CPRS-48): The initial version of the CPRS comprised 94 items and was designed for parents to assess their children's attention deficit, hyperactivity, and associated symptoms (41). Later, in 1978, Goyette et al. streamlined this into a 48-item version (42). This version defines five subscales: conduct problems, learning problems,

psychosomatic, impulsive-hyperactive, and anxiety. The scale utilizes a 4-point Likert system. The Turkish adaptation encompassing both validity and reliability evaluations, was carried out by Kaner et al (43).

Misophonic  symptom  checklist  (MCL): MCL  is  a  4-point  Likert  type scale developed by Öz and Kiliç (7). The checklist assesses both types and severity of misophonic symptoms and includes 50 different sounds. The total score will be between 0 and 150; with higher scores indicating more severe misophonic symptoms.

Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI): MOCI was developed by Hodgson and Rachman and is designed to measure subset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (44). Maudsley obsessive-compulsive inventory comprises 30 yes/no items grouped into four subscales and higher  scores  indicate  more  serious  obsessive-compulsive  traits.  The Turkish  version  of  the  inventory  has  been  shown  to  have  adequate validity and reliability in a study conducted by Erol and Savasir (45).

## Statistical Analysis

Descriptive  statistics  were  utilized  to  characterize  sociodemographic and clinical  variables,  as  well  as  the  scores  derived  from  the  scales.  In light of the non-normal distribution of the scale scores, as determined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, non-parametric statistical tests were employed. Specifically,  the  Mann-Whitney U test was implemented to contrast MCL scores between two groups, while Spearman's correlation was used to investigate associations between the ages of the adolescent, mother, and father, and the scores of the respective scales. Due to the impact of sex on MCL scores, correlation analyses of MCL and the other scales  were  conducted  for  each  sex  separately.  Subsequent  to  these analyses,  multivariate  linear  regression,  using  the  enter  method,  was employed to gauge the predictive capacities of the MOCI, CPRS-48, and AQ-Adolescent on MCL scores. All statistical procedures were executed using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) program version 22.0. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was deemed indicative of statistical significance.

## RESULTS

The  distribution  of  scale  scores  was  assessed  using  the  KolmogorovSmirnov test.  None  of  the  scales  conformed  to  a  normal  distribution, warranting the use of non-parametric statistical analyses. The medians for the AQ-Adolescent, CPRS-48, MCL, and MOCI were 22 (range: 9-31), 41 (range: 8-96), 41 (range 2-124), and 17 (range: 4-33), respectively.

## The Relationship Between Sociodemographic-Clinical Variables and MCL

Exploring  associations  between  sociodemographic  variables  and  MCL scores, significant positive correlations were found both the mother's age (r=0.215, p&lt;0.001) and the father's age (r=0.138, p=0.015). No significant correlation was observed between the adolescent's age and MCL scores (r=0.026, p=0.629). Female participants exhibited significantly higher MCL scores compared to males (Z=-3.377, p&lt;0.001). There was no significant association between the MCL scores and the blood relationship between the  parents  (Z=-1.489,  p=0.137).  Participants  with  a  family  history  of mental disorders had significantly higher MCL scores than those without such a history (Z=-2.466, p=-0.014). The method of delivery did not have a  significant  impact  on  the  MCL  scores  (Z=-1.693,  p=0.091).  Notably, participants who did not require hospitalization post-delivery exhibited significantly higher MCL scores compared to those who did (Z=-2.616, p=0.009).

## The Correlational Analysis Between Scales

The correlation analyses of AQ-Adolescent, MCL, MOCI and CPRS-48 are presented in Table 2. While MCL was positively correlated with MOCI (r=0.357, p&lt;0.001) and CPRS-48 (r=0.313, p&lt;0.001), negatively with AQAdolescent  (r=-0.123,  p=0.021).  Sex-stratified  correlation  analyses  are presented in Table 3.

## The Regression Model for Predicting MCL Scores

Finally, enter method multivariate linear regression analyses conducted was with MOCI, CPRS-48 and AQ-Adolescent to predict MCL. Analysis conducted to see if the date met the assumption of collinearity indicated that multicollinearity was not a concern (MOCI, Tolerance=0.95, VIF=1.053;

among  misophonic  individuals.  Conversely,  Cliaborn  et  al.  reported  a slightly elevated prevalence of autism in misophonics compared to the general population (36).

## DISCUSSION

In  this  study,  the  association  between  misophonic symptoms and trait psychological  variables,  including  ADHD,  obsessive-compulsive  and autism  related  traits,  was  investigated.  While  ADHD  and  obsessivecompulsive traits were positively correlated with misophonic symptoms, autism  related  traits  were  negatively.  Additionally,  sex,  the  ages  of mother and father, family history of mental disorders, and not requiring hospitalization after post-delivery had an impact on MCL scores. In the regression model, MOCI, CPRS-48, AQ-Adolescent significantly predicted the misophonic symptoms, and all variables maintained their significance in the full model.

In  the  present  study,  female  participants  manifested  elevated  levels of  misophonic  symptoms.  The  literature  offers  varied  perspectives  on the  association  between  misophonia  and  sex.  Nonetheless,  results predominantly leaning towards female dominance have been recurrently reported (1,9,36). The implications of sex in relation to misophonia will be elaborated upon in subsequent sections of this discussion.

There was a discernible positive correlation between the ages of both parents and the severity of misophonic symptoms in their offspring. This emergent finding insinuates a potential neuropsychiatric underpinning to misophonia. While it might seem speculative to infer so, it is noteworthy that elevated parental age has been previously associated with conditions like autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and cognitive deficits (46). Contrastingly, this age associated predisposition is not evidenced in audiological disorders according to our knowledge.

Furthermore,  participants  with  a  familial  history  of  mental  disorders displayed heightened misophonic symptoms. The established knowledge posits an augmented risk for various mental disorders contingent upon family history. Analogously, this principle holds for a myriad of organic disorders,  encompassing  conditions  like  cancer,  Alzheimer's  disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. However, deriving concrete interpretations from this observed association remains challenging. More targeted  research  endeavours  are  essential  to  draw  more  conclusive inferences. The same issues are valid for not having hospitalization postdelivery and higher levels of misophonic symptoms.

Contrary to our hypothesis, our findings indicated a negative correlation between the levels of autistic traits and misophonia symptoms. Intriguingly,  this  significant  correlation  diminished  when  exclusively focused on female-specific correlation analyses. A few case reports have identified the coexistence of autism and misophonia (21,35). Yet, a study by Jager et al. did not elucidate a distinct association between the two conditions (31). Given the absence of a control group in their study, one cannot  conclusively  deduce  that  autistic  traits  are  not  more  prevalent

Drawing  from  neurobiological  evidence,  Williams  et  al.  underscored potential  shared  neural  substrates  between  autism  and  misophonia (38). Specifically, previous research has documented heightened anterior  insular  cortex  activity  (37)  and  salience  network  responses (47) in misophonic individuals following exposure to triggering stimuli. These neural structures and networks, particularly the insular cortex and the salience network, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of autism (38). Rinaldi et al. also observed amplified autism-related traits in misophonic adults and children (29).

However, our findings suggest a divergent relationship. More intriguingly, this inverse correlation between autistic and misophonic traits became non-significant when  analysing  the  female  participants  specifically. A  fundamental  distinction  to  note  is  that  reactions  in  autism  are  not predominantly  specific  sounds  but  tend  to  be  aversive  or  aggressive responses to loud, high-pitched, or sudden noises (34). Misophonia, on the  other  hand,  manifests  as  emotional,  autonomic,  and  behavioural reactions to specific sounds, often determined by individual sensitivities and  the  sound  source.  Williams  et  al.  broached  the  subject  of  this relationship  by  classifying  misophonia  under  the  broader  spectrum  of reduced sound tolerance. Our data, however, may imply that misophonia diverges  from  this  overarching  categorization,  potentially  signifying  its distinct neuropsychiatric classification.

In  our  research,  ADHD  trait  levels  showed  a  positive  correlation  with misophonia  symptoms  across  the  entire  sample.  Yet,  intriguingly,  this significant positive association between the two conditions disappeared in  gender-specific  analyses  focusing  on  males.  Previous  studies  have attempted to elucidate the comorbidity between ADHD and misophonia. Jager et al. found that 5% of their 575 adult misophonic participants had co-morbid  ADHD  (31).  In  contrast,  another  study  reported  a  higher rate  of  12%(5).  Notably,  a  recent  study  indicated  that  ADHD  did  not significantly impact children in the misophonia group (32).

When  considering  sex  differences,  ADHD  is  typically  more  prevalent in males  during  childhood  and  adolescence,  with  notable  clinical differences observed between the sexes. Specifically, inattention tends to be more predominant in females, whereas hyperactivity and impulsivity are more commonly seen in males. Furthermore, tactile defensiveness, characterized  by  heightened  sensitivity  to  touch,  is  more  prevalent  in females. It's possible that this sensory sensitivity could shed light on our findings. Nevertheless, these novel results necessitate further investigation through more targeted research.

Our study identified a positive correlation between obsessive-compulsive and  misophonic  symptoms.  Interestingly, sex did not significantly impact  this  relationship  as  it  did  in  the  associations  between  ADHDmisophonia and autism traits-misophonia. Several researchers propose that misophonia should be conceptualized within the spectrum of OCDrelated disorders. They suggest that if misophonia were to be included

in diagnostic manuals such as the DSM or ICD, it should be categorized under OCD-related conditions (1,23,30,48). According to this perspective, the act of ruminating on triggers represents the obsessive component, while aversive behaviours function as the compulsive part. Conformably, just  as  not  exhibiting  compulsion  in  OCD  can  lead  to  heightened anxiety and autonomic symptoms, exposure to a trigger in misophonia without an escape can evoke similar responses. Nevertheless, we along with  some  other  researchers  (49),  challenge  this  conceptualization. The  symptomatology  of  misophonia  exhibits  distinct  differences  from that of OCD-related disorders. Notably: 1) misophonics do not always ruminate  on  potential  trigger,  2)  predominant  emotion  is  not  anxiety, it  is  disgust, and 3) aversive or aggressive behaviours are not observed in  every  misophonics;  some  individuals  may  endure  a  trigger  without exhibiting notable reactions, and there's no repetitive manifestation of compulsive  behaviour.  However,  the  correlation  between  obsessivecompulsive and misophonic symptoms has been consistently observed (1,12,18,22,23,50). The foundational cause of this relationship remains an area of ongoing investigation.

Our study faces several limitations. The findings may not be generalizable to all adolescent psychiatric patients due to their confinement to a single private centre and the exclusion of specific disorders, such as psychotic disorders and autism spectrum disorder. While we examined several trait features,  other  aspects  like  state  features,  trait  anxiety,  and  personality were not assessed, leaving a gap in our understanding of misophonia. The  reliance  on  self-report  scales  introduces  potential  biases,  and  we did  not  account  for  the  known  comorbidities  of  anxiety  and  OCDrelated  disorders.  Medications  that  participants  might  be  on,  such  as methylphenidate,  antidepressants,  and  antipsychotics,  could  influence symptom  levels.  AQ-Adolescent  and  CPRS-48  were  filled  by  parents. There  may  be  a  risk  of  that  some  parents  could  be  willing  to  present their child's clinical manifestations exaggerated or extenuated. Finally, the cross-sectional design of our study does not allow us to draw conclusions about causality.

Our  study  pioneers  the  exploration  of  associations  between  ADHD symptoms, obsessive-compulsive tendencies, autistic traits, and misophonic symptoms among adolescent psychiatric outpatients. While  gender  was  not  our  primary  focus,  its  notable  influence  on these  relationships  holds  significance.  These  insights  could  enrich  our understanding of misophonia as a distinct clinical phenomenon. Further research is essential to delve deeper into these relationships.
