‡Senior co-authors.Misophonia (hatred of sound) is a newly deﬁned psychiatric condition in which ordinary
human sounds, such as breathing and eating, trigger impulsive aggression. In the current
study, we investigated if a dysfunction in the brain’s early auditory processing system could
be present in misophonia. We screened 20 patients with misophonia with the diagnostic
criteria for misophonia, and 14 matched healthy controls without misophonia, and investi-
gated any potential deﬁcits in auditory processing of misophonia patients using auditory
event-related potentials (ERPs) during an oddball task. Subjects watched a neutral silent
movie while being presented a regular frequency of beep sounds in which oddball tones
of 250 and 4000 Hz were randomly embedded in a stream of repeated 1000 Hz standard
tones. We examined the P1, N1, and P2 components locked to the onset of the tones.
For misophonia patients, the N1 peak evoked by the oddball tones had smaller mean peak
amplitude than the control group. However, no signiﬁcant differences were found in P1
and P2 components evoked by the oddball tones. There were no signiﬁcant differences
between the misophonia patients and their controls in any of the ERP components to
the standard tones.The diminished N1 component to oddball tones in misophonia patients
suggests an underlying neurobiological deﬁcit in misophonia patients.This reduction might
reﬂect a basic impairment in auditory processing in misophonia patients.

INTRODUCTION
Misophonia is a newly deﬁned psychiatric condition, which is
characterized by the hatred of ordinary human sounds (Hadji-
pavlou et al., 2008; Schwartz et al., 2011; Edelstein et al., 2013;
Ferreira and Harrison, 2013; Neal and Cavanna, 2013; Schröder
et al. , 2013). The central hallmark of misophonia is an aggres-
sive impulse automatically triggered by sounds, such as breathing,
chewing, and eating. T o date, there has been no neurophysiological
marker linked with this disorder. Such a marker could potentially
beneﬁt the recognition of misophonia patients and give directions
to further neurophysiological research in this domain.
The underlying causes of misophonia are unknown. Patients
usually report normal hearing and standard hearing tests do not
reveal any audiological deﬁcits (Edelstein et al., 2013 ;Schröder
et al., 2013). Therefore, our aim was to explore if the pathophysi-
ology of this disorder manifested itself in some dysfunction of the
auditory processing system. This was carried out by examining
differences in speciﬁc components of the auditory event-related
potentials (ERPs) between misophonia patients and controls,
elicited by pure tones in an oddball paradigm.
Early sensory components evoked by auditory stimulation
include a positive peak around 50 ms (P50 or P1), a negative peak
around 100 ms (N100 or N1), and a positive peak around 200 ms
(P200 or P2). T o date, there have been a number of studies examin-
ing anomalies in these components in various psychiatric disorderssuch as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and posttraumatic stress-
disorder (PTSD) (O’Donnell et al., 1994; Javitt et al., 2000; Kayser
et al., 2001; Salisbury et al., 2010; Javanbakht et al., 2011).
The P1 is associated with pre-attentive orienting toward new
sounds and is not yet affected by attention (Picton and Hill-
yard, 1974; Pratt et al., 2008). Sensory gating (the suppression of
responding to irrelevant stimuli) can be assessed by examining
P1 suppression during repetitive presentation of an auditory-
stimulus ( Luck and Kappenman, 2012 ). Its amplitude is found
to be altered in various disorders such as autism, Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, and attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (Buchwald et al.,
1989 , 1992; Kemner et al., 1996).
The N1 peak is linked to early attention (Näätänen, 1992; Rinne
et al., 2006). It has been suggested to signal the detection of abrupt
changes in sensory input, which enables us to focus on events
that are potentially informative ( Friston, 2005; Winkler, 2007;
T odd et al., 2012). The N1 is commonly assessed in an “oddball”
paradigm (Näätänen and Picton, 1987). In such paradigm, partici-
pants are presented repetitive sounds (“standard”) with randomly
occurring rare deviant sounds (“oddballs”), often while watching a
silent movie. Attenuated N1 responses have been found in various
studies of schizophrenia, a disorder in which notable audiological
symptoms, i.e., acoustic hallucinations and delusions, are present.
In these studies, N1 peaks were reduced in chronic schizophrenics,
ﬁrst-hospitalized patients, and twins of schizophrenics ( Salisbury

Schröder et al. Diminished N1 potentials in misophonia
et al., 2010). N1 ﬁndings in PTSD are inconsistent with some
studies reporting increased N1 amplitude and others decreased
amplitude. Peak latency increments were also found but not in all
studies (Javanbakht et al., 2011). Interestingly, in antisocial person-
ality disorder, an impaired N1 was related to increased impulsivity
(Lijfﬁjt et al., 2012). Decreased N1 function was also found in
cocaine abuse and bipolar disorder (Boutros et al., 2006; Lijfﬁjt
et al., 2009).
The P2 peak is an endogenous evoked component and appears
to be involved in early allocation of attention and initial con-
scious awareness (Näätänen, 1992). Less research has been focused
on the P2 peak. Reduced P2 has been found in chronic and in
ﬁrst-hospitalized schizophrenic patients (O’Donnell et al., 1994;
Salisbury et al., 2010). In PTSD studies, the results are ambiguous
with both increased and decreased P2 amplitudes being reported
(Javanbakht et al., 2011).
In our present study, we investigated early processing of audi-
tory information using a non-attending oddball paradigm. We
focused our analysis on any differences in the P1, N1, and P2
components of the evoked potentials between patients diagnosed
with misophonia, and matched healthy controls. While the exoge-
nously generated P1 component could provide information about
sensory gating, a P2 difference would point more toward attention-
related malfunctioning. Because the N1 is considered the most
stable ERP component, this could be a reliable marker of pathol-
ogy. We believe that any difference between the auditory evoked
responses of misophonia patients and controls could reﬂect an
anomaly in the way that these patients ﬁlter novel information in
the auditory environment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
PARTICIPANTS
Twenty patients with misophonia (males D11, femalesD9, aged
20–55 years, MD35.9 years, SDD10.6 years) were screened with
the diagnostic criteria for misophonia and severity was assessed
with the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (AMisoS) (Schröder et al.,
2013). All patients were tested for auditory impairments (McArdle
and Hnath-Chisolm, 2009; Schlauch and Nelson, 2009). Psychi-
atric status was evaluated using the Symptom Checklist (SCL-
90) (Derogatis et al., 1973), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
(HAM-D) (Hamilton, 1960), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale
(HAM-A) (Hamilton, 1959).
Fourteen healthy controls (males D11, femalesD3), matched
for demographical characteristics, were recruited on the absence
of any misophonic symptoms or psychiatric comorbidity and
tested. The age ranged between 23 and 55 years ( MD32.4 years,
SDD9.0 years).
Subjects were tested for hearing deﬁcits using standard hearing
tests (tone and speech audiogram and loudness discomfort lev-
els) and no deﬁcits were found. Complementarily, both groups
ﬁlled out the Proﬁle of Mood States (POMS) – short form,
which assessed arousal level and mood on ﬁve subscales (T ension–
Anxiety, Depression–Dejection, Anger–Hostility, Fatigue–Inertia,
and Vigor–Activity). The overall assessment of the current emo-
tional state – the total mood disturbance (TMD) score – was
calculated by adding up the ﬁrst four negative subscale scores
and subtracting the Vigor–Activity score (McNair et al., 1992;T able 1 | Clinical and demographic characteristics of the study sample .

compensation for their travel expenses, but no further compen-
sation was offered for participating in the study. The study was
carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was
approved by the local medical ethics committee of the Academic
Medical Center of Amsterdam.
AUDITORY PARADIGM
The participants were presented with a pseudorandomized
sequence of 840 tone stimuli (Presentation 11.3, Neurobehav-
ioral Systems Inc., Albany, CA, USA) administered through Philips
SHS3201/28 headphones. The standard tones (80%) had a fre-
quency of 1000 Hz. A deviant tone that was lower than the
standard tone (250 Hz) and a tone that was higher than the
standard (4000 Hz) were added to the sequence. Both deviants
were presented in 10% of trials and were never presented
successively.
The auditory stimuli had a duration of 200 ms (including 10 ms
rise and fall times shaped by a Blackman window), while the

inter-stimulus interval was 650 ms. During the presentation of
the tones, the participants watched a neutral silent movie with
subtitles. They were instructed to ignore the tones.
DATA ACQUISITION
EEG data were acquired using a WaveGuard 10–5 cap system
developed by ANT, with 64-Ag/AgCl electrodes, spanning from
frontal, temporal, central, and occipital scalp sites. The EEG was
sampled at 512 Hz with an online average reference and then
subsequently imported into MATLAB for all further off-line analy-
ses. The electrooculogram (EOG) was recorded between supra-
and infra-orbital sites around the left eye for vertical movement
(blinks), and outer acanthi of the left and right eyes for possible
side-eye movements.
EEG PREPROCESSING
Data analysis was completed using EEGLAB1and Fieldtrip soft-
ware packages2along with in-house scripts. Data were high-pass
ﬁltered at 0.5 Hz using a non-causal FIR ﬁlter (“ﬁr1” in EEGLAB).
Trials containing artifacts (e.g., eye movements, blinks, mus-
cle potentials) were removed from the EEG using the default
automatic-reject routines in EEGLAB. Independent component
analysis was used to remove any eye movements not rejected by
the semiautomatic routines (Jung et al., 2001).
ERP ANALYSIS
The auditory-stimulus locked ERP data were low-pass ﬁltered at
30 Hz using a two-pass Butterworth IIR ﬁlter (default option Field-
trip) and averaged with the sweep beginning 200 ms before the
stimuli and lasting until 450 ms after stimulus onset. The ERPs
were baseline corrected using the mean time 150 ms prior to
stimulus onset.
The average peak amplitude and peak latency of the P1, N1, and
P2 were computed per subject and compared between the miso-
phonia patient group and healthy controls. The time interval for
determining the mean peak amplitude and latency were chosen
based on looking at the grand-averaged data.
The difference in the P1, N1, and P2 response between miso-
phonia patients and controls was assessed separately for the stan-
dard and deviant tones. This was due to the assumption that
different processes likely take place after presentation of a fre-
quent and infrequent tone, which could be affected differently in
patients. Moreover, separating analyses for standard and deviant
tones could also circumvent the potential problem of comparing
conditions with a difference in signal-to-noise ratio, arising from
the difference in amount of trials between the standard and deviant
condition (Salisbury et al., 2010).
For the deviant tones, peak latency of the P1 was deﬁned as
the most positive deﬂection occurring between 50 and 100 ms
post-stimulus onset in electrodes Fz and FCz. N1 peak latency
was deﬁned as the most negative deﬂection in Fz and FCz occur-
ring between 100 and 200 ms, and the P2 was deﬁned as the most
positive deﬂection in Cz and FCz between 200 and 300 ms.

2http://www.ru.nl/fcdonders/ﬁeldtrip/For the standard tones, evoked responses were different in tim-
ing and therefore different time-windows were used for the N1
(120–160 ms) and P2 (160–220 ms). Channel selection was based
on maximal amplitude of the grand average.
The mean amplitudes for the P1, N1, and P2/3 were obtained
by averaging values of abovementioned channels within the
predeﬁned intervals.
An independent t-test was performed to test for a difference
in responses elicited by the standard tones. Two-way repeated-
measures analysis of variance (rANOV A) was used to test for a
difference in response after presentation of deviant tones, with
tone (low deviant, high deviant) as within-subject variable and
group (control, patient) as between-subject variable. Statistics
were performed using SPSS, attaining a threshold of p0.05.

RESULTS
STUDY PARTICIPANTS
Clinical characteristics are presented in T able 1 . There was no sig-
niﬁcant difference in age between the patient group and the control
group ( pD=0.323). Also, the male/female ratio was not signif-
icantly different [ X2(1,ND34)D2.004, pD0.157]. Compared
to controls, misophonia patients reported a signiﬁcantly higher
baseline emotional state [ t(28.39)D3.11, pD=0.004], measured
by the TMD score on the POMS.

intervals of interest.
DEVIANT TONES ELICITED A DIMINISHED N1 IN MISOPHONIA
PATIENTS
The deviant tones evoked a smaller N1 component in the miso-
phonia patients than in the control group [  0.711 vs. 1.277mV ,
F(1,32)D5.608, pD0.024]. However, the peak latency of the
deviant evoked N1 was not different between the misophonia and
the healthy control group. We found no differences in the P1, P2
average amplitude or peak latencies between patients and con-
trols (see T ables 2 and 3). Also no interactions between group and
deviant tones were found.
A main effect of tone was present for the P1, N1, and P2 average
amplitudes. The low deviant tone elicited a larger P1 than the high
deviant tone [0.332 vs. 0.096 mV ,F(1,32)D4.840, pD0.035]. In
contrast, the lower deviant tone evoked a smaller N1 than the high
tone deviant [ 0.662 vs. 1.226mV ,F(1,32)D5.537, pD0.001].
The P2 was larger after presentation of the lower deviant than the
high deviant tone [0.768 vs. 0.323 mV ,F(1,32)D8.457, pD0.007].
Finally, the peak latency of the N1 response was different for
the two deviant tones, such that the high tone showed an earlier
peak compared to the low tone [136 vs. 151 ms, F(1,32)D20.097,
pD0.0001].

We found that the mean amplitude of the auditory N1 was
signiﬁcantly diminished in misophonia patients compared to
healthy controls. This attenuation suggests a deﬁcit in auditory
information processing at a low-level in misophonia patients.

One possible explanation of the smaller N1 peak in misopho-
nia patients in our study might be the difference in the clinical
characteristics of the two groups. The most notable difference was
the TMD scores on the POMS ( T able 1 ). Misophonia patients
had a signiﬁcantly higher TMD than the controls. An increased
TMD could reﬂect a state of general hyperarousal in misophonia
patients. Due to this hyperarousal or general irritability, misopho-
nia patients might not have attended to the sounds as much as the
controls. The link between general hyperarousal and misophonia
has also been discussed by Edelstein et al. (2013) who found a
signiﬁcantly higher skin conductance response in the misophonia
group triggered by various visual and auditory aversive stimuli.
Both misophonia patients and controls found similar stimuli to
be aversive and non-aversive but on a different level. They there-
fore raised the possibility that misophonia patients are merely at
the tail end of the distribution.
Another explanation could be that difference in N1 peak ampli-
tude between the misophonia group and the control group isdue to some other psychiatric comorbidity or the use of psy-
chotropic medication. However, we believe that it is very unlikely
that these differences can be explained by comorbidity because in
the misophonia group only one patient had a current psychiatric
comorbidity, which was attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD). Nevertheless, the confounding effect of psychotropics,
especially antidepressants,on N1 responses in misophonia patients
cannot completely be ruled out. However, previous research inves-
tigating medication effects on the N1 indicate that this is unlikely
(Salisbury et al., 2010).
We concede that our current ﬁndings cannot easily be linked to
two fundamental issues underlying misophonia symptomology:
ﬁrst, why do human sounds – and not inanimate, i.e., environ-
mental sounds – evoke misophonic symptoms? And second, why
do these sounds trigger aggression (Schröder et al., 2013)?
We conjecture that the ﬁrst issue could be related to the exis-
tence of two separate neural systems for processing human and
non-human sounds (Pizzamiglio et al., 2005; Engel et al., 2009).
Possibly, in misophonia it is only the human sound-processing
network that is affected. This, however, does not fully explain the
arousal described by a few misophonia patients caused by inani-
mate – environmental – sounds (Edelstein et al., 2013), or why we
observed a lower N1.
The second question might be understood through literature
on obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). OCPD
has a very high comorbidity rate in patients with misophonia of
52.4% (Schröder et al., 2013). Core symptoms of OCPD include
cognitive inﬂexibility and high levels of moralism, which can
result in criticism of other people’s behavior (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000). Violation of social norms – both intentional
and unintentional – have been associated with left orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC) activation (Berthoz et al., 2002). Therefore, OFC
involvement in the emergence of misophonia symptoms could
exist. This could then also partly explain the differences, described
by some misophonia patients, between their aggressive reactions
to sounds made by, e.g., babies or elderly demented, which usu-
ally do not trigger much aggression, and to those of other adults,
which do. The difference might lie in the level that the misophonia
patients assess the accountability and deliberateness of the sound
source.
CONCLUSION
This is the ﬁrst study investigating the underlying neurobiologi-
cal mechanisms of misophonia. We found that it was possible to
distinguish misophonia patients from healthy controls by using
a simple auditory oddball paradigm. We conclude that a lower
than normal N1 response could be a neurophysiological marker
for misophonia. However, it still remains to be investigated if
this diminished N1 is a characteristic of general psychiatric psy-
chopathology or a distinctive characteristic for misophonia. More-
over, it is unclear whether the underlying deﬁcit in misophonia is
due to altered auditory perception, an inadequate processing of
auditory stimuli, or a higher order dysfunction of cortical control
related to impulsivity. Thus, we believe further research should
therefore aim at delineating misophonia from other psychiatric
disorders and elucidate the neural interactions directly correlating
with the symptomology of misophonia.
