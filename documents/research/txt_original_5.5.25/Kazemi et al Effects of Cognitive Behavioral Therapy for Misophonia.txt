## Abstract

Background: Misophonia is a condition characterized by intense physical and emotional reactions to  everyday  sounds,  commonly  known  as  triggers.  Despite  its  prevalence,  with  estimates suggesting  that  6%  to  20%  of  students  are  affected,  research  on  effective  treatments  remains limited. Misophonia is believed to stem from enhanced connectivity between the limbic system and auditory structures, rather than auditory abnormalities. Comorbidities with mental disorders such as PTSD, OCD, and major depressive disorder are common. While no definitive treatment has been established, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) shows promise. Studies indicate that CBT can reduce distress and improve coping strategies, with significant symptom improvement reported after CBT interventions.

Methods: We included randomized controlled trials, open-label studies, and pilot cases focused on misophonia, using PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for our search. Non-English studies, animal research, and case reports were excluded. Data extraction covered study  parameters  and  outcomes,  and  biases  were  evaluated  using  the  Cochrane  Collaboration method.

Results: Screening 28 studies led to inclusion of six, including randomized controlled trials and an  open-label  study.  Results  show  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  significantly  reduces misophonia symptoms, with studies reporting up to 48% improvement in A-MISO-S scores and sustained benefits over time. These findings underscore CBT 's potential as a promising treatment for misophonia, though further research is needed to establish standardized protocols and longterm efficacy.

Conclusion: This  systematic  review  confirms  CBT  as  effective  for  treating  misophonia, highlighting its symptom reduction and quality of life improvements. Further research is needed to refine CBT protocols and explore alternative treatments.

## 1. Introduction

Misophonia is a new condition in which people have highly adverse physical and emotional  reactions  to  certain  everyday  sounds,  such  as  chewing,  slurping,  nose sniffing,  or  breathing,  frequently  referred  to  as  triggers.  The  first  definition  of misophonia  was  "an  abnormally  strong  reaction  is  triggered  by  a  sound  with  a specific pattern and meaning to an individual," according to Jastreboff (Jastreboff et al., 2014) . Misophonia sufferers frequently exhibit avoidance or escape behaviors in an  attempt  to  avoid  being  around  sounds  that  trigger  them,  which  can  have detrimental effects on interpersonal relationships and cause them to become isolated. Misophonia  sufferers  usually  perceive  sound  normally,  so  hearing  threshold problems cannot be the cause of their negative responses (Schröder et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2014; Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff, 2015) . Cavanna and Seri suggest that misophonic  reactions  could  result  from  enhanced  limbic  system  and  auditory structure connectivity (Cavanna and Seri. 2015) .

According to the few currently available sources, 6% and 20% of students are thought to have misophonia (Wu et al., 2014; Zhuo et al., 2017) . Given the large number of people with this disorder, it is clear that more research is required to identify  effective  treatment  and  prevention  methods.  Despite  the  disorder's  high prevalence, little research has been done on it up to this point. So, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) does not define misophonia precisely (Ghorbani et al., 2022) .  Studies  already conducted indicate that people with misophonia corresponded to with the criteria of at least one additional mental disorder. Erfanian et al. found that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, 15.4%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, 11.5%), major depressive disorder (9.6%), and anorexia nervosa (9.6%) are among the most common comorbidities (Erfanian et al., 2019) .

It has not yet been reported that any conclusive treatment is effective. However, the results of Lewin et al. suggest that CBT can be an appropriate approach to start a psychotherapeutic  intervention  for  misophonia (Lewin  et al., 2021) . This comprehensive approach not only alleviates the immediate distress caused by trigger sounds but also contributes to long-term coping strategies that enhance daily living. Nonetheless,  six  studies  utilizing  CBT  have  produced  encouraging  outcomes (Bernstein et al., 2013; Dozier, 2015a, b; McGuire et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2016; Rosenthal et al., 2023) . As one of the main symptoms of misophonia is heightened attention to trigger sounds, the principal objective of CBT is to lessen the arousal that these sounds cause (Jager et al., 2021) . In a study by Schröder et al., after eight sessions of  CBT once every two weeks, about half (48%) of the 90 participants reported improvement on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGII) and a reduction of 4.5 points on the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (range 0 to 20) (Schröder et al., 2017) .

In  addition,  after  three  months  of  CBT,  patients'  misophonic  symptoms significantly  decreased  compared  to  the  waiting-list  group (Jager  et  al.,  2021) . According  to  the  results  of  several  case  studies,  CBT  can  effectively  target  the symptoms of misophonia (Mattson et al., 2023) and lead to significant improvements in mental and physical dysfunction and increased areas of functioning in patients (McMahon et al., 2024) .

Fortunately, further research is underway  to find effective therapeutic interventions for preventing and reducing misophonic symptoms. Thus, we decided to conduct this systematic review after reviewing various studies and the lack of a comprehensive review on the effectiveness of CBT on misophonia.

## 2. Method

This review followed the PRISMA-ScR checklist (Moher et al., 2015) for reporting systematic reviews (Fig 1). First, the purpose of the investigation and its rationale were established. A thorough,  comprehensive  approach  to  literature  was  used  to identify the relevant research. The selection of studies was carried out using defined search parameters. The findings were gathered, incorporated, and presented. Experts then examined the results in the field.

## 2.1. Eligibility criteria

The  PICO  framework,  consisting  of  Population,  Intervention,  Comparison,  and Outcome, is commonly used by researchers to formulate clear and focused research questions.  By  defining  these  components,  PICO  helps  establish  inclusion  and exclusion criteria, guiding the literature review process and ensuring a structured approach to research. This framework is essential for conducting valid, valuable research, as it helps focus the inquiry and facilitates systematic evidence searches (Schardt et al., 2007) .

We included records if they a) reported randomized controlled trials (RCTs), open-label  studies,  and  pilot  cases  where  the  effectiveness  of  a  treatment  was documented and tested, and misophonia was the primary complaint or treatment target.  b)  They  have  to  describe  a  population  of  patients  with  misophonia.  c) Treatment outcomes should have been accurately reported in trials. d) They included all ages and comorbidities. e) The data were limited to studies submitted in English.

As  part  of  our  rigorous  selection  process,  records  that  reported  on  animal research or that were case reports or case studies (personal or expert opinions) were not  included.  Furthermore,  records  lacking  an  English  full-text  translation  were excluded from our analysis.

## 2.2. Information sources and search strategy

We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central, Web of Science, and Google Scholar  on  November  17,  2023,  for  the  keywords:  'misophonia,'  'Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),' and 'misophonia treatments,' or 'decreased sensitivity to sound.' In addition, there is a reference section to find other related sources that have not been found in the initial primary search; the relevant sources have been searched. In December 12, 2024, the searches were last renewed.

## 2.3. Study selection

Initially, all abstracts and article titles were independently evaluated according to predefined  criteria.  Subsequently,  the  full  texts  of  the  selected  articles  were thoroughly reviewed. During this evaluation, there was no disagreement between the researchers as to whether or not an article should have been submitted.

## 2.4. Data extraction

The researchers extracted all information from the articles into an Excel file based on the following items: Year of publication, study type, study objective, number of participants,  the  average  age  of  participants,  age  range,  the  gender  ratio  of participants,  clinical  symptoms  or  concurrent  physical  or  mental  illnesses  of participants, method of participant grouping, randomization of participants, blinding of grouping, blinding of therapists to the type of intervention, blinding of therapists to the type of intervention, triggering sounds, a treatment used, outcome measures, primary outcomes,  number  of  treatment sessions, recommended  techniques, medications  or  complementary  treatments,  assessment  time,  article  outcome, conditions and limitations, weaknesses or strengths, and notes. Then, disagreements in the extracted data were minimized, and the researchers reached a final agreement through reassessment.

## 2.5. Risk of bias

The  Cochrane  Collaboration  technique  was  employed  to  evaluate  each  study's potential for bias (Higgins et al., 2003) . The writers assessed the risk of biases in reporting, performance, detection, attrition, and selection. The ultimate verdict is shown in Table 1. There were three categories for the risk of biases: low, high, and undetermined. The numbers in the first row represent the reference numbers of the included studies,  a  (+)  indicates  low  risk,  a  (?)  indicates  unclear  risk,  and  a  (-) indicates  high  risk.  Other  biases  were  associated  with  a  possible  source  of  bias related to study design, insufficient data to determine an essential risk of bias or insufficient evidence regarding a significant issue.

The numbers in the first row represent the reference numbers of the included studies, a (+) indicates low risk, a (?) indicates unclear risk, and a (-) indicates high risk. Other biases were related to potential sources of bias in study design, insufficient information to assess significant risks, or a lack of evidence regarding important matters

## 3. Results

A total of 28 resources were eligible for initial screening after removing duplicates containing seven items. Of these, 19 were excluded due to being case studies, and the remaining nine were moved to the following screening stage. Finally, six studies remained after excluding three additional resources because they did not meet our study criteria, as shown in Figure 1. Of the included studies, five were RCTs and one was an open-label study. Four studies also had adjunctive treatments, but only the results from CBT are presented in the results table. Table 2 gives information on the studies in question.

All interventions were conducted on individuals with misophonia, and most studies used the A-MISO-S (Schröder et al., 2013) . To ensure the validity of our findings, we employed the Cochrane Collaboration technique, a widely recognized and rigorous method for assessing the potential for bias in each study (Higgins et al., 2003) .

## 3.1. Definition of misophonia

Misophonia , a condition that can significantly disrupt daily life, is characterized by exceptionally strong negative responses to particular sounds (Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff, 2014) . The seemingly innocuous sounds of chewing, breathing, or typing can trigger intense emotions like anger, disgust, and rage, accompanied by physical symptoms such as sweating and elevated heart rate (Jager et al., 2020; Schröder et al., 2017; Ghorbani et al., 2022; Lewin et al., 2021; Rappoldt et al., 2023; McMahon et al., 2024) . These reactions can be so severe that they lead to social distancing and avoidance behaviors (Potgieter et al., 2019; Köroğlu et al., 2024; Campbell, 2023; Vitoratou et al., 2021; Bernstein et al., 2013; Brout et al., 2018; Dozier, 2015).

Some  authors  have  included  the  literal  meaning  of  misophonia  in  their definitions as hatred of sound (Edelstein et al., 2013; Giorgi, 2015; Kumar et al., 2014;  Schröder,  Vulink  et  al.,  2013;  Wu  et  al.,  2014) . While the  exact  cause  of misophonia  remains  unknown,  it  is  believed  to  be  a  complex  interplay  of neurological and psychological factors, as described by Erfanian et al. (Erfanian et al., 2019) . Although there is no universally accepted treatment for misophonia, there are promising approaches, such as CBT, that offer hope for managing the condition (Erfanian et al., 2019; Köroğlu et al., 2024; Campbell, 2023; Vitoratou et al., 2021; Bernstein et al., 2013; Brout et al., 2018; Cavanna et al., 2015) .

Definitions of misophonia also include a wide range of emotional reactions. The broad spectrum of emotional responses includes discomfort, distress, anxiety (Johnson et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014) , hatred, irritability, anger, loss of self-control, and  disgust (Boyce, 2015;  Colucci, 2015;  Dozier,  2015a, 2015b, 2015c; Giorgi, 2015; Kumar et al., 2014, 2017; Reid et al., 2016; Schröder, Mazaheri, et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2015, 2017; Webber et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014) . Some definitions also mention  physiological  arousal  (as  a  stimulus) and  emotional  reactions (Bernstein et al., 2013; Edelstein et al., 2013; Vidal et al., 2017) .

## 3.1.1 Comorbid disorders

Misophonia may also be comorbid with a number of mental disorders, including anxiety,  depression,  and  obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD) (Cavanna  et  al., 2015) . According to Jager et al, 28% of 27 individuals diagnosed with misophonia also  received  concurrent  diagnoses  based  on  Axis  I  of  the  DSM-IV  diagnostic system for mental disorders (Jager et al., 2021) . Notably, anxiety disorders were the most  common  comorbid  condition  with  misophonia,  with  a  prevalence  of  45% reported by Ghorbani et al. (Ghorbani et al., 2022) . Comorbidity with neurological disorders such as Tourette's syndrome and auditory system disorders also has been observed (Naguy et al.,  2022;  Neal  &amp;  Cavanna,  2013) .  Refer  to  the  "Comorbid Disorder(s)" section of Table 2.

## 3.2. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

CBT is a well-researched and structured short-term therapy that aims to address maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors, commonly applied in treating mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress, by involving techniques that help patients identify and challenge distorted cognitions, leading to improved emotional and behavioral responses, and is recognized for its effectiveness in reducing symptoms and improving overall psychological functioning (Hofmann et al., 2012) .

Although limited results have been obtained so far for the effective treatment of misophonia, CBT has been recognized as the most effective approach. In a study by Schröder and colleagues, 90 patients with moderate misophonia received CBT sessions bi-weekly (Schröder et al., 2017) . The components of this therapy included task concentration  exercises,  counterconditioning,  stimulus  manipulation,  and relaxation exercises. The task concentration exercises aimed to redirect the patient's attention from the triggering sound to something else whenever they encountered the sound. In counterconditioning, pleasant stimuli, like the person's favorite music, were  paired  with  triggering  sounds,  like  chewing  noises,  to  establish  positive associations. Dozier initially used this approach in his case studies (Dozier 2015a, 2015b,  2015c) .  The  triggering  sounds  were  made  manageable  through  stimulus manipulation so that people could do so in a secure setting, like on a computer. Finally,  relaxation  techniques  were  used  to  lessen  agitation  brought  on  by  the triggering noises.

Nine percent of patients experienced total symptom remission following group cognitive behavioral therapy (G-CBT), and 48% had a 30% or higher decrease in their A-MISO-S scores (Schröder et al., 2017) . Furthermore, after three months of CBT, a significant decrease in misophonia symptoms was seen in a study by Jager and colleagues compared to the waiting list group. This improvement persisted a year after the treatment's conclusion (Jager et al., 2021) . In research conducted at Tehran's  Tarbiat  Modares  University,  69%  of  participants  reported  improved misophonia symptoms following CBT. This therapy also led to reductions in anxiety and depression and increased distress tolerance (Ghorbani et al. reported results for OG-CBT and OG-MACT  separately, ensuring clarity in their individual effectiveness) (Ghorbani et al., 2022) .

## 4. Discussion

This systematic review aimed  to investigate the effectiveness of CBT  for misophonia. We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria, five being RCTs and one being an open-label study. The studies provided encouraging evidence that CBT can be a practical treatment approach for misophonia, leading to significant reductions in symptoms and improved quality of life for patients (Schröder et al., 2017; Bernstein et al., 2013; Dozier 2015a,2015 b; McGuire et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2016; Rosenthal et al., 2023) .

CBT is effective in treating misophonia by developing coping skills to prevent and appropriately respond to its distressing symptoms (Brout et al., 2018; Jager et al., 2021) . It is assumed that this disorder is not caused by anatomical abnormalities leading  to  auditory  problems (Młller,  2011) but  rather  by  an  overly  sensitive connection between the limbic and sympathetic nervous systems (SNS; Jastreboff &amp; Hazell,  2008) . Some  authors  believe  this  hypersensitivity  in  individuals  with misophonia can be altered by changing their cognition and behavior (Swedo et al., 2022) .  Furthermore, CBT helps patients with misophonia to have greater control over  their  emotions  and  behavioral  reactions,  allowing  them  to  exhibit  fewer negative  responses  whenever  they  hear  or  anticipate  triggering  sounds (FerrerTorres &amp; GimØnez-Llort, 2022 ( .

A key strength of this review is its focus on RCTs, which provide a robust methodology that strengthens the overall findings and increases confidence in the results. Notably, all studies reported positive outcomes for CBT, with a significant decrease in misophonia symptoms observed in both treatment groups compared to controls. This consistency across studies using diverse methodologies suggests that CBT offers a robust and generalizable treatment approach for misophonia (Schröder et al., 2017) .

## 4.1. Limitations and Future Directions

Despite the promising findings, some limitations need to be addressed. First, the sample sizes in the included studies were relatively small. However, the potential of larger-scale studies with more extended follow-up periods to confirm the long-term efficacy  of  CBT  for  misophonia  is  a  beacon  of  hope.  Additionally,  the  studies included participants with varying degrees of misophonia severity, and this opens the  door  for  future  research  to  explore  whether  CBT  is  equally  effective  for  all severity levels.

Another limitation is the potential for comorbid conditions. Misophonia is often comorbid  with  other  mental  health  disorders,  such  as  anxiety  and  depression (Erfanian et al., 2019) . The studies included in this review did not control for these comorbidities,  which  could  potentially  influence  the  treatment  outcomes.  Future research should investigate the effectiveness of CBT for misophonia in patients with comorbid conditions (Erfanian et al., 2019) .

Finally, it  is  essential  to  acknowledge  that  CBT  may not  be suitable  for  all patients with misophonia. Some individuals may have difficulty engaging in therapy or may require additional treatment modalities in conjunction with CBT. Further research is needed to identify factors that predict treatment response and to develop alternative treatment options for patients who do not respond well to CBT.

## 5. Conclusion

This systematic review suggests that CBT is a promising treatment approach for misophonia, with the potential to reduce symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients significantly (Jager et al., 2021; Schröder et al., 2017; Bernstein et al., 2013; Dozier 2015a,2015 b; McGuire et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2016; Rosenthal et al., 2023) . However, further research is needed to address the limitations identified in  this  review  and  to  optimize  CBT  interventions  for  misophonia.  Future studies should  explore  the  effectiveness  of  CBT  for  different  severities  of  misophonia, investigate the impact of comorbid conditions on treatment outcomes, and identify factors  that  predict  treatment  response.  Additionally,  research  into  alternative treatment modalities for misophonia is crucial to ensure that all patients have access to effective interventions.
