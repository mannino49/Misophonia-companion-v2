Misophonia can be characterized both as a condition and as a negative
affective experience. Misophonia is described as feeling irritation or disgust
in response to hearing certain sounds, such as eating, drinking, gulping,
and breathing. Although the earliest misophonic experiences are often
described as occurring during childhood, relatively little is known about the
developmental pathways that lead to individual variation in these experiences.
This literature review discusses evidence of misophonic reactions during
childhood and explores the possibility that early heightened sensitivities
to both positive and negative sounds, such as to music, might indicate
a vulnerability for misophonia and misophonic reactions. We will review
when misophonia may develop, how it is distinguished from other auditory
conditions (e.g., hyperacusis, phonophobia, or tinnitus), and how it relates
to developmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder or Williams
syndrome). Finally, we explore the possibility that children with heightened
musicality could be more likely to experience misophonic reactions and
develop misophonia.

Introduction
Misophonia is a newly described and complex auditory condition characterized by
aversive reactions to particular sounds and the events that generate those sounds. The
term misophonia was not introduced into the published literature until 2001 (Jastreboﬀ
and Jastreboﬀ, 2001). Over the past two decades, publications on the topic of misophonia
have increased from three articles in 2006 to 36 articles in 2021 (Retrieved from PubMed
on September 13, 2022). Though a recent consensus paper classiﬁed misophonia as a
disorder instead of a condition or syndrome (Swedo et al., 2022), people do frequently
experience subclinical reactions to misophonic triggers (Wu et al., 2014; Naylor et al.,
2021; Sarigedik and Gulle, 2021).
The goal of this literature review is to explore and examine what is currently
known about how misophonic reactions are experienced and how they develop within

the general population, not only in clinical populations that
seek out treatment. Exploring populations that do not have
signiﬁcant disruption in quality of life and experience less
severe misophonic reactions, as well as populations without the
disorder, could give clues for understanding and treating people
with misophonia; however, this research is largely absent from
the literature. Therefore, we examine evidence of misophonic
reactions during childhood and explore the possibility that early
heightened aﬀective sensitivities to a range of sounds might
confer a vulnerability for misophonia. Speciﬁcally, we cover
when and why misophonic reactions may develop in the general
and clinical populations, how misophonia is distinguished from
other auditory conditions (e.g., hyperacusis, phonophobia, or
tinnitus) and developmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum
disorder or Williams Syndrome), and pose the question of
whether a heightened sensitivity or preference for music might
predispose a child to experience misophonic reactions, even if
these reactions do not rise to the level of clinical impairment.
We reviewed the literature in these areas (the development
of misophonic reactions, other developmental disorders, and
auditory experiences) with the goal of covering fundamental
concepts, current gaps within the literature, and potential
developments within the ﬁeld. A limitation of this review is that
only research published in English was included.
Characterization of misophonia
Misophonia is typically characterized by irritation and/or
disgust that individuals may experience when hearing certain
sounds, such as breathing, drinking, and throat clearing,
but especially eating and chewing (Edelstein et al., 2013;
Schröder et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014; Brout et al., 2018).
The term misophonia translates directly as the “hatred of
sounds.” The sounds that create the negative response in people
with misophonia are called “triggers” or “misophonic sounds”
(Edelstein et al., 2013, 2020; Brout et al., 2018). Triggers
are usually repetitive or periodic in nature, and they create
“misophonic responses, ” negative emotions that often lead
individuals to remove themselves from the environment or
sometimes to act with anger and aggression. These responses
and reactions and the triggers that elicit them diﬀer across
individuals and have varying levels of severity (Edelstein
et al., 2013; Brout et al., 2018). Further, misophonia is
deﬁned separately from phonophobia (the fear of sounds)
and hyperacusis (discomfort or pain due to the intensity, or
loudness, of a sound) (Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2001, 2002;
Schröder et al., 2013, 2014; Tyler et al., 2014).
Swedo et al. (2022) codiﬁed a consensus deﬁnition
of misophonia, summarizing 93 deﬁnitional statements
with 80% or greater expert agreement. This deﬁnition
highlights the nature of misophonic triggers, the behavioral
and negative emotional reactions to these triggers, andexpected comorbidities. The consensus deﬁnition also
separates misophonic reactions from the impairments
they may create, which are described in the International
Classiﬁcation of Functioning, Disability, and Health (World
Health Organization [WHO], 2001) and will assist clinicians
in formally diagnosing misophonia. Within the domain of
body functions , misophonic reactions may aﬀect emotional
and perceptual mental functions , in which heightened levels of
negative emotion and perceptions of sounds are considered
aversive instead of neutral. To the extent that misophonic
reactions preclude processing of other sounds, they may also
impair sensory bodily functions . These impairments may interact
with the sound quality environmental factor of functioning and
disability, in which only certain sounds in the environment
give rise to misophonic reactions. Misophonic reactions may
also aﬀect participation in a variety of activities, including
impairments in listening ;receiving communication ;handling
stress ; and engaging inparticular interpersonal relationships ,
education , and employment .
There are a range of self-report questionnaires available
to researchers that can be used to determine (1) if someone
experiences misophonic reactions and (2) the threshold or
degree of severity of the symptoms. A comprehensive list
and diﬀerences of questionnaires that have and have not
been validated can be found in Rinaldi et al. (2021).
The questionnaires that have been validated for assessing
misophonic reactions are the Misophonia Quotient (MQ; Wu
et al., 2014), the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S;
Schröder et al., 2014; Jager et al., 2020; Naylor et al., 2021;
Sarigedik and Gulle, 2021), the Selective Sound Sensitivity
Syndrome Scale (S-Five; Vitoratou et al., 2021), the Duke
Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ; Rosenthal et al., 2021),
Misophonia Response Scale (Dibb et al., 2021), and MisoQuest
(Siepsiak et al., 2020). Though these questionnaires can assess
the severity of misophonic reactions, these assessments were
created using diﬀerent deﬁnitions of misophonia and need to be
evaluated using the consensus deﬁnition of misophonia (Swedo
et al., 2022).
The self-reported prevalence of individuals who experience
misophonic reactions in the general population ranges from
20 to 55% (Wu et al., 2014; Naylor et al., 2021; Rinaldi
et al., 2021; Sarigedik and Gulle, 2021). Studies measuring
misophonia sensitivity in large ( N500) non-clinical samples
of undergraduate college students using the MQ (Wu et al.,
2014) and the Sussex Misophonia Scale (SMS) (Rinaldi et al.,
2021) report that 20–40% of participants have sound sensitivities
that signiﬁcantly aﬀect their lives. Even higher prevalence
rates of 50–55% have been observed in studies using the
A-MISO-S (Naylor et al., 2021; Sarigedik and Gulle, 2021),
with roughly 40% of participants reporting symptoms that
are mild, 12% moderate, and less than 1% reporting severe
symptoms. However, these prevalence estimates are derived
from self-reported symptoms and disability, which are typically

Mednicoff et al. 10.3389/fnins.2022.924806
saturated with negative emotion instead of disorder-speciﬁc
features (Oltmanns et al., 2018). As a result, these estimates are
likely inﬂated relative to those that would be established through
a clinical interview establishing distress and dysfunction
speciﬁc to misophonia using the new consensus deﬁnition
(Swedo et al., 2022).
Despite the growing interest in misophonia, it has not been
formally recognized as a distinct neurological, audiological, or
psychiatric disorder according to either ICD-11 or DSM-5 (-TR)
diagnostic criteria (Brout et al., 2018; Lewin et al., 2021). Because
of this, the presence and extent of misophonia may be largely
underrepresented in the literature (Ferreira et al., 2013; Lewin
et al., 2021) or grouped with other dysfunctions of auditory
perception with decreased sound tolerance, like hyperacusis
(Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2002, 2013, 2015). Decreased sound
tolerance disorders fall under an umbrella of dysfunctions
deﬁned by negative reactions to sounds that surpass those
that would be expected from an average listener (Jastreboﬀ
and Jastreboﬀ, 2002, 2013, 2015). Examples include diplacusis
(an anomaly whereby the pitch of a single tone is perceived
diﬀerently by the two ears; Di Stadio et al., 2018), polyacusis
(when more than two tones are perceived from a single
sound simultaneously; Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2015), tinnitus
(phantom auditory perception without corresponding activity in
the cochlea or external sound source; Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ,
2001, 2015; Moore, 2012), and most commonly, hyperacusis
(Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2015). Hyperacusis and misophonia
have distinct proﬁles from one another (Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ,
2015). In hyperacusis, patients’ negative reactions are dependent
on the physical characteristics of the sound (e.g., spectrum and
intensity/loudness) (for reviews, see Baguley and Hoare, 2018;
Potgieter et al., 2020), whereas in misophonia, patients’ negative
reactions are dependent on the meaning and context for the
individual and typically to speciﬁc sound categories (Jastreboﬀ
and Jastreboﬀ, 2002, 2013, 2015; Hansen et al., 2021).
As noted by Rinaldi et al. (2021), misophonia assessments
typically exhibit poor divergent validity to separate out similar
conditions like hyperacusis. Studies that investigate whether
someone experiences misophonia or another hearing disorder
have to use additional questionnaires or surveys for diﬀerential
diagnosis (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018; Rinaldi et al., 2021). This is
especially important since misophonia and hyperacusis seem to
co-occur together with similarly reported symptoms (Jastreboﬀ
and Jastreboﬀ, 2013, 2015). Only a few questionnaires have been
created and validated to assess hyperacusis across the general
population, and at present, no questionnaire diﬀerentiates
hyperacusis from misophonia (Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2014;
Baguley and Hoare, 2018). Ultimately, further research is
needed to clarify the relationship between misophonia and these
disorders.
Several other neurological, medical, and psychiatric
disorders besides misophonia also entail over-responsivity
and sound intolerance. Migraine headaches are a neurologicalcondition characterized by unilateral throbbing headache,
photosensitivity, and increased reactivity to other sensory
inputs (Sullivan et al., 2014). Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is often accompanied
by sound over-responsivities (Ben-Sasson et al., 2009), and
Williams Syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental genetic
disorder with musicality and sociability as prominent features
(Pinheiro et al., 2011; Lense et al., 2014). Schizophrenia is
associated with deﬁcits in gating aversive sounds as measured
through pre-pulse inhibition of the startle blink reﬂex (San-
Martin et al., 2020), in which the magnitude of the eye blink to
a loud and aversive startle probe is typically reduced after a less
intense tone (Grillon et al., 1996). In contrast, though one of
the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder is the experience
of an exaggerated startle reﬂex, larger psychophysiologically
assessed startle reﬂex magnitude is not uniquely associated with
post-traumatic stress disorder diagnoses (Pole, 2007) and could
be associated with other diagnoses instead, like misophonia. The
extent to which these disorders–along with such other disorders
as obsessive compulsive disorders, personality disorders, and
anxiety disorders–are comorbid with misophonia is unclear
(Ferreira et al., 2013; Brout et al., 2018; Rouw and Erfanian,
2018; Erfanian et al., 2019).
Though some misophonic sounds can be considered
universally annoying, most are not commonly considered to
be negative or aversive to the general population (Edelstein
et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2013). As suggested by Edelstein
et al. (2020), a given sound (or sounds) can be a misophonic
trigger for one person, but not for another person. Misophonic
triggers are often human-produced (e.g., eating or breathing
sounds) (Schröder et al., 2013), and although many studies
report a predominance of human-made triggers, there are both
case studies and empirical research of misophonic reactions
to a variety of other sounds, such as keyboard or pen
tapping, clinking glasses, clock ticking, refrigerator sounds, etc.
(Edelstein et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2013; Jastreboﬀ and
Jastreboﬀ, 2014; Taylor, 2017). Although both human-made and
non-human-made sounds have been identiﬁed as misophonic
triggers (Dozier et al., 2017; Hansen et al., 2021), most people
with misophonia report at least some human-made triggers,
and Jager et al. (2020) argue that misophonia should not be
diagnosed for individuals who report exclusively non-human
generated triggers.
In neurotypical populations, distinct neural and
physiological responses have been observed for people
with misophonia relative to controls. For example, individuals
with misophonia had heightened skin conductance responses
to misophonic sounds, but not when they watched the
same stimulus with the sound removed from the visual
stimulus (Edelstein et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2017). This
ﬁnding indicates that misophonic reactions are largely driven
by sound. Additionally, one study (Schröder et al., 2014)
reported that individuals with misophonia had diminished

Mednicoff et al. 10.3389/fnins.2022.924806
N1 auditory event-related potential amplitude to oddball
tones compared to controls, but no diﬀerence in N1 peak
latency. The authors speculated that this ﬁnding might indicate
auditory and neurobiological abnormalities in misophonia
(Schröder et al., 2014).
A few studies have used brain imaging to examine the
neural correlates of misophonic reactions. Schröder et al. (2019)
investigated neural diﬀerences between individuals with and
without misophonia using fMRI and electrocardiography.
Compared with controls, individuals with misophonia
responded to misophonic triggers with higher ratings of
anger, disgust, and sadness, increased heart rate, and increased
activation of brain areas associated with auditory processing
and the salience network. Another study reported that
relative to controls, those with misophonia had larger right
amygdala volume based on voxel-based morphometry,
greater connectivity from their right and left amygdalae to
the cerebellum, and increased ventral attention network
connectivity to the occipital cortices and fusiform gyri (Eijsker
et al., 2021). The authors propose that the enlarged amygdala
could be related to heightened emotional responses, and that
increased connectivity between the amygdala and cerebellum
may drive the reﬂex-like physiological reactions to misophonic
sounds. Because higher ventral attention network connectivity
was found with the occipital cortex instead of the auditory
cortex, the authors suggest that this heightened connectivity
may reﬂect enhanced capability to respond to visual aspects
of misophonic triggers (Eijsker et al., 2021). Lastly, when
Kumar et al. (2021) compared individuals with misophonia to
controls, they found three main results. First, despite ﬁnding
no diﬀerences in the auditory cortex between both groups,
they saw stronger resting state connectivity between both
auditory and visual cortices and the orofacial motor area of
individuals with misophonia. Second, they found stronger
functional connectivity between the auditory cortex and
orofacial motor area when general sounds were played, and
third, found increased activation in the orofacial motor area for
individuals with misophonia when speciﬁc triggers were played
to both groups (Kumar et al., 2021). Together, these studies
provide preliminary evidence that misophonia is associated
with distinct physiological and neural responses to misophonic
triggers as compared to other sounds (Edelstein et al., 2013;
Schröder et al., 2014, 2019; Kumar et al., 2017, 2021; Eijsker
et al., 2021). These atypical neurophysiological responses could
reﬂect experience-driven diﬀerences or an early predisposition
for intense emotional responses to sound, or some combination
of the two.
Development of misophonia
Given that misophonic reactions are experienced by so
many people, especially at a sub-clinical level, a critical questionis how and when misophonic reactions occur over the course
of one’s life. Although a recent consensus between experts
agrees that misophonia most likely emerges in childhood,
more research is still needed to determine when children are
most likely to begin experiencing their earliest misophonic
reactions (Swedo et al., 2022). Individuals who experience
misophonia typically report symptoms starting from a very
young age and/or for as long as they can remember. In
a sample of 301 misophonic patients above the age of 18,
Rouw and Erfanian (2018) found that 45% of these patients
reported onset of misophonic experiences during childhood,
30% during adolescence, and 15% for “as long as I can
remember.” In retrospective studies, most individuals reported
that their misophonia symptoms emerged during childhood
or adolescence (for a review, see Potgieter et al., 2019), with
some reported symptoms not emerging until young adulthood
(Boyce, 2015; Tunç and Ba¸ sbu ˘g, 2017), or emerging at any
point throughout the life span (Zhou et al., 2017; Sanchez and
Silva, 2018). Thus, there appears to be individual variation in
when people retrospectively report their misophonia symptoms
emerging.
Studies using self-report measures of misophonia in younger
non-clinical populations describe levels of misophonia severity
that are comparable to those observed in adults, with more than
half of high school students reporting a clinically signiﬁcant
level of misophonia using the A-MISO-S (Sarigedik and Gulle,
2021), and 11% of 10- to 14-year-old children according
to an adolescent version of the Sussex Misophonia Scale for
Adolescents (SMS-A) (Rinaldi et al., 2022). This provides
support for the notion that misophonia emerges prior to
adulthood.
How misophonia develops is currently unclear (Schröder
et al., 2017; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018; Lewin et al., 2021). One
study found that 77% of participants self-reported symptoms
worsening with age (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018), whereas another
study found a negative association between age and misophonia
severity (Vitoratou et al., 2021). If symptoms indeed worsen over
time, therapies would presumably be needed to prevent this.
Treatments like exposure therapy have not been as successful
in case studies to treat misophonia due to non-compliance
(Hadjipavlou et al., 2008), and studies that have looked at
medication alone or counterconditioning are limited to a
handful of case studies (Dozier, 2015a,b; McGuire et al., 2015;
Tunç and Ba¸ sbu ˘g, 2017; Vidal et al., 2017). In comparison,
cognitive-behavioral therapy seems to be successful in reducing
misophonia in adults (Bernstein et al., 2013; McGuire et al.,
2015; Reid et al., 2016; Potgieter et al., 2019; Jager et al.,
2021), and perhaps also in younger populations (see Lewin
et al., 2021 for a preliminary proof of concept); however,
those with a higher severity of misophonia symptoms seem
more likely to respond to treatment (Schröder et al., 2017).
The eﬀectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapies in reducing
the severity in misophonic symptoms could implicate two
Frontiers in Neuroscience 04 frontiersin.org

fnins-16-924806 September 17, 2022 Time: 15:32 # 5
Mednicoff et al. 10.3389/fnins.2022.924806
mechanisms in the development of misophonia, which await
larger-scale treatment dismantling studies to explore. For the
ﬁrst mechanism, if the behavioral components represent the
active therapeutic ingredients, such ﬁndings would point to a
role of learning in misophonia, in which initial hyperarousal in
response to a speciﬁc sound or sounds might lead to associations
between those sounds and aversive emotional and physiological
responses (Schröder et al., 2017). For the second, if individuals
were to use maladaptive behaviors (such as avoidance) to escape
trigger sounds, this would further exacerbate symptoms of
misophonia over time, which behavioral interventions would
help mitigate (Lewin et al., 2021). Alternatively, if targeting
cognitive elaborations and schemas related to misophonic
triggers improves patient function, the cognitive components of
interventions may provide a means of coping with sensitivities.
In either case, if misophonia is a learned behavior, it is
unclear whether or not misophonia could be induced in any
person under the right circumstances, as proposed by Rouw
and Erfanian (2018), or if certain individuals are predisposed
to experience intense emotional responses or aversive reactions
to sound. Interestingly, Rouw and Erfanian (2018) found that
half of the people with self-reported misophonia in their study
experienced autonomous sensory meridian responses (ASMR),
whereas Vitoratou et al. (2021) found that 29.2% of their
participants from their study self-reported experiencing both.
This raises the question of whether these same individuals not
only have pronounced negative experiences toward misophonic
triggers, but also enhanced positive experiences to other
sounds as well (see below). Perhaps there are individual
diﬀerences in the intensity with which listeners experience
emotional responses to sound, and further research attempting
to understand these endophenotypes could help address this
question of whether or not certain individuals are more or less
vulnerable to acquiring misophonia.
Misophonia, autonomous sensory
meridian response, and frisson
Although misophonia is characterized by negative
emotional reactions to sounds, an open question is whether
those who experience misophonic reactions also have
heightened reactions to other sounds–both positive and
negative. Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a
phenomenon typically triggered by everyday stimuli that induce
a state of relaxation, positive feelings, and tingling sensations
that originate from the head region and spread to the rest of
the body (Barratt and Davis, 2015; McGeoch and Rouw, 2020).
ASMR has been associated with speciﬁc personality traits,
with individuals who experience ASMR having higher scores
on openness to experience and neuroticism on the Big Five
Inventory of personality (Fredborg et al., 2017). Individuals whoexperience ASMR may watch or listen to ASMR content several
times a week to multiple times per day, usually for relaxation
or sleep induction (Barratt and Davis, 2015; Barratt et al., 2017;
McErlean and Banissy, 2017; Poerio et al., 2018; Kovacevich and
Huron, 2019). ASMR is a common experience as seen by the
ubiquity of virtual ASMR communities around the world (Liu
and Zhou, 2019), and a high percentage of individuals reporting
that they experience ASMR, with one study showing 81% of
1,002 participants experienced ASMR (Poerio et al., 2018).
Like misophonia, those who experience ASMR exhibit larger
physiological responses to ASMR triggers relative to those who
do not experience ASMR, such as a decrease in heart rate
and an increase in skin conductance (Poerio et al., 2018).
Also like misophonia, most individuals who report having
ASMR say that they have experienced it in some form since
childhood (Barratt and Davis, 2015). Interestingly, a large
proportion of individuals who experience ASMR also self-
report experiencing misophonia (Barratt et al., 2017), and they
tend to score higher on misophonia scales relative to controls
(McErlean and Banissy, 2018).
While misophonia seems to be a type of negative sound
sensitivity, ASMR is a type of sound sensitivity that is
predominantly perceived as aﬀectively positive. Similarly to
misophonic triggers, sounds that give rise to pleasurable ASMR
experiences in some people (e.g., someone clicking their tongue,
trimming their nails, typing on a keyboard, or chewing ice) do
not elicit particularly strong reactions in others (Barratt and
Davis, 2015). Rather, the types of sounds that induce ASMR
vary depending on the person’s speciﬁc sensitivity level and
experiences with those sounds, which is also very similar to those
who experience misophonia (Pruitt, 2019). In fact, some of the
very same sounds that produce positive ASMR reactions in one
person can produce completely opposite negative misophonic
reactions in another person, especially chewing and other eating
sounds (McErlean and Banissy, 2017). Sounds such as chewing
or slurping would be considered emotionally neutral by most
people, but this sound can either elicit heightened negative
reactions in people with misophonia or heightened positive
feelings in some who experience ASMR. This is consistent
with the notion that misophonia and ASMR might both entail
increased auditory emotional responses but with contrasting
aﬀective valence (Barratt and Davis, 2015).
Frisson, or musical chills, is yet another well-documented
sound-induced emotional phenomenon characterized by
positive aﬀect and strong physiological reactions while listening
to music, notably shivering, goosebumps, and teary eyes (del
Campo and Kehle, 2016; McGeoch and Rouw, 2020). Frisson is
seen as an overall pleasant experience, with one study showing
that chills were signiﬁcantly correlated with the perceived
pleasantness of the songs (Grewe et al., 2007). Although
there are distinct diﬀerences between ASMR and frisson,
including stimulus triggers, duration, and speciﬁc emotional
responses, some have proposed that ASMR might be a milder,

less intense version of frisson (del Campo and Kehle, 2016;
Kovacevich and Huron, 2019). Musical frisson seems to be a
more common experience than ASMR, with one of the earliest
studies on frisson showing that, out of all 249 participants
who responded to their survey, about 78.7% self-reported ever
experiencing chills (Goldstein, 1980). Although many people
experience frisson, it does not occur regularly and diﬀers
greatly between people in amount, duration, and the musical
pieces that induce them (Grewe et al., 2007). The experience
of musical frisson is associated with brain reward circuitry:
regional cerebral blood ﬂow increases in left ventral striatum
and dorsomedial midbrain, but decreases in right amygdala, left
hippocampus/amygdala, and ventral medial prefrontal cortex
(VMPF) (Blood and Zatorre, 2001). These regions of activation
in the brain reward circuitry have been associated with euphoria
and positive emotions, which is consistent with the positive
aﬀective experience of frisson.
Although music-induced frisson has been the focus of
prior research, relatively little is currently known about
the relationship between misophonia and frisson. Even so,
frisson and misophonia have some noteworthy similarities.
Like misophonia, frisson experiences are consistent, so even
after listening to the same piece of music multiple times, a
listener can still experience this strong emotional response
(Sloboda, 1991). The experiences of frisson and misophonia
both vary widely between individuals: virtually any genre of
music can induce frisson in a person depending on their
preferences, and misophonic triggers also vary depending on
the individual and their life history with a given trigger
(Salimpoor et al., 2009; Edelstein et al., 2013). Nevertheless,
the acoustic features of misophonia and frisson triggers
may diﬀer, since misophonic triggers are often repetitive
or periodic in nature (Edelstein et al., 2013; Brout et al.,
2018), whereas frisson is often and most notably induced
when a novel musical event violates expectations, such as an
unexpected harmony or entrance of a new voice, or an intense
musical feature like dynamic leaps in loudness (Sloboda, 1991;
Grewe et al., 2007; Plazak, 2008; Harrison and Loui, 2014).
More research is needed to understand the similarities and
diﬀerences between experiences of misophonia and musical
frisson.
Misophonia, ASMR, and frisson all entail high-level
auditory aﬀective processing and depend on speciﬁc triggers
that vary across individuals. Some listeners may have greater
likelihood of experiencing ASMR, misophonia, or frisson
because of their greater attention to and sensitivity toward
a range of both positive and negative meaningful sounds.
Although no papers to date directly compare frisson and
misophonia, both phenomena are associated with activity in
similar areas of the brain and have similar physiological
expressions. As for the diﬀerences in brain regions between
frisson and misophonia, in response to frisson-inducing classical
music, a decrease in cerebral blood ﬂow was seen in the lefthippocampus, amygdala, and VMPF with positron emission
tomography (Blood and Zatorre, 2001), whereas in response to
misophonia trigger videos, an increase in activation was seen
in some of these same areas with fMRI (Kumar et al., 2017).
The amygdala and VMPF are both areas involved in emotional
processing and regulation, implicating emotional circuitry in
both of these phenomena (Blood and Zatorre, 2001; Kumar
et al., 2017). As the intensity of frisson increases, regional
cerebral blood ﬂow increases in regions for motor processes,
such as the supplementary motor area and cerebellum (Blood
and Zatorre, 2001). Though this may explain muscle tension
and relaxation when experiencing musical frisson, the increased
connectivity between the amygdala and cerebellum when
experiencing misophonia may drive the reﬂex-like physiological
reactions to misophonic sounds (Eijsker et al., 2021). As for
similarities between frisson, misophonia, and ASMR, listening
to frisson-inducing music, misophonia-inducing sounds, and
ASMR videos all caused increases in skin conductance and heart
rate (Craig, 2005; Salimpoor et al., 2009, 2011; Edelstein et al.,
2013; Poerio et al., 2018; Schröder et al., 2019). Furthermore,
an increase in the activation of the insula and anterior cingulate
cortex, which are parts of the salience network that detects and
selects emotionally important information, is also seen with
all three emotional phenomena: frisson (Blood and Zatorre,
2001), misophonia (Kumar et al., 2017; Schröder et al., 2019),
and ASMR (Lochte et al., 2018). Both frisson and ASMR
can be inﬂuenced by expectancy eﬀects, in which observers
anticipate that a certain stimulus will result in a sensory
experience and are therefore likely to achieve that outcome
(Cash et al., 2018). The role of expectation in both ASMR
and frisson may be due to increased activity in the reward
pathway, such as the left and right nucleus accumbens as
well as the medial prefrontal cortex, along with brain regions
associated with emotional arousal as noted above (Blood and
Zatorre, 2001; Lochte et al., 2018; Valtakari et al., 2019). The
similarities in physiological responses between frisson, ASMR,
and misophonia suggest that these brain regions may be
involved in sound-induced emotional responses, both positive
and negative. Because many people who experience ASMR also
experience misophonia, and ASMR and frisson both similarly
heighten reward pathway activity, it is possible that many people
who experience both misophonia and ASMR also experience
frisson.
Developmental disorders with
heightened sensitivity to sounds
Given that misophonia falls under the umbrella of decreased
sound tolerance disorders and appears to at least share some
features with other phenomena that begin in childhood, it may
be informative to compare misophonia with other disorders
that originate in childhood and entail heightened sensitivity

to sounds. For example, Williams Syndrome (WS) and autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders
that are associated with hyperreactivity to both positive and
negative sounds and a high prevalence of decreased sound
tolerance, including misophonia.
People with WS exhibit higher rates of hyperacusis, auditory
fascinations, and auditory aversions (Levitin et al., 2005; Lense
et al., 2013), compared to typically developing individuals.
Hyperacusis has been proposed to result from a tendency for
heightened arousal in the sympathetic nervous system, leading
to ﬁght-or-ﬂight reactions (Blomberg et al., 2006). Because of
this tendency, hyperacusis could be seen as a vulnerability
for psychopathology (Blomberg et al., 2006). The prevalence
of misophonia is not as well known in this population,
perhaps because most researchers studying WS would not have
become aware of misophonia until recently. Individuals with
WS who have been diagnosed with hyperacusis often report
aversion (misophonia) or fear (phonophobia) of sounds, rather
than a decreased tolerance or pain to the sound’s intensity,
as is typical with hyperacusis (Baguley and McFerran, 2011;
Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2014; Silva et al., 2021). In fact,
studies have reported a high prevalence of auditory aversions
within this population, with as much as 85–95% of people
with WS reporting aversions to one or more sounds (Klein
et al., 1990; Van Borsel et al., 1997; Levitin et al., 2005). The
aversive sounds in this population seem to be contextual, and
driven by unique individual experiences, as in misophonia. This
suggests that misophonia in WS may have been mistaken for
hyperacusis (Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2014). One solution to
distinguish this, as suggested by Baguley and McFerran (2011),
would be to administer a validated questionnaire to formally
diagnose hyperacusis separately from misophonia, and work
toward greater consensus in deﬁning hyperacusis (Glod et al.,
2020).
Decreased sound tolerance is also experienced by 50–
70% of children or adults with ASD at some point in their
lives (Williams et al., 2021a). However, similarly to those
with WS, clinical questionnaires vary and do not all address
which phenomenologically distinct aspects of decreased sound
tolerance that the individual with ASD is most likely to
be experiencing: hyperacusis, phonophobia, or misophonia
(Williams et al., 2021a,b). This diﬀerentiation will be important
for future research, as recent meta-analyses state that current
and lifetime prevalence of hyperacusis in ASD can be as
high as 40 and 60%, respectively (Williams et al., 2021b). No
studies to date have assessed the prevalence of misophonia
in ASD and separated it from the other forms of decreased
sound tolerance. Evidence from clinical samples that happen
to have patients comorbid with ASD suggest that for cases
of decreased sound tolerance in this population, it could be
explained by hyperacusis (Amir et al., 2018), misophonia, or
both (Williams et al., 2021b). A few of the regions of the
brain implicated in the pathology of ASD include the insula,amygdala, and salience network (Uddin and Menon, 2009;
Dziobek et al., 2010; Green et al., 2016), which are also
regions implicated in misophonia (Kumar et al., 2017; Schröder
et al., 2019). Resting-state connectivity between the salience
network and amygdala has been seen in neuroimaging studies
of children and adolescents with ASD (Green et al., 2016),
as well as in adults who experience misophonia (Schröder
et al., 2019; Eijsker et al., 2021). This connectivity has been
proposed to be related to the sensory over-responsivity seen
in people with ASD in response to auditory and tactile stimuli
(Green et al., 2016, 2018). It is possible that these networks
underlie auditory sensitivities exhibited in both autism and
misophonia.
A striking feature of ASD and WS is that both are
characterized by unusually positive responses to musical stimuli
(Järvinen et al., 2016). Enhanced processing and heightened
aﬃnity toward music are seen in varying degrees across both
disorders (Levitin et al., 2005; Lense et al., 2013; Järvinen
et al., 2016). For example, though language deﬁcits are common
in ASD, pitch and melody discrimination are unimpaired
or even enhanced in those with ASD compared to typically
developing controls (Bonnel et al., 2003; Heaton, 2003; Jones
et al., 2011; O’Connor, 2012; Stanutz et al., 2012). From early in
development, individuals with ASD tend to prefer and allocate
greater attention to musical stimuli than to speech (Blackstock,
1978; Dawson et al., 1998; Kuhl et al., 2005; O’Connor, 2012).
This increased awareness and attention to pitch and music could
even contribute to language impairments observed in ASD,
particularly if greater attention to other sounds interferes with
or alters the trajectory of typical language learning (O’Connor,
2012). Likewise, despite auditory sensitivities and aversions
to particular sounds and a range of cognitive deﬁcits, those
with WS seem to largely exhibit enhanced musical abilities,
hypermusicality and high engagement with music (Levitin
and Bellugi, 1998; Don et al., 1999; Lenhoﬀ et al., 2001;
Lense et al., 2013), however, that is not true for everyone
with WS (Don et al., 1999; Thornton-Wells et al., 2010).
It is important to note that there are also key diﬀerences
between WS and ASD especially regarding degree of sociability
(Asada and Itakura, 2012). While individuals with WS are
typically extremely social and want to interact with others
(Jones et al., 2000) and this sociability may drive an aﬃnity
for music and musical activities (Zitzer-Comfort et al., 2007),
those with ASD often exhibit wide-ranging deﬁcits in social
processing and communication (Phillips et al., 2019). Thus,
there may be distinct mechanisms and causes for musical
aﬃnity in these populations. It is also unclear in both WS
and ASD populations whether individuals who show particular
aﬃnity or interest in music also tend to have more auditory
aversions. Nevertheless, we review this evidence to point out
that in principle, stronger negative and positive reactions to
emotionally meaningful sounds can exist within the same
population.

Misophonia and musicality
If certain individuals tend to experience stronger negative
and positive emotional responses to sounds, sound sensitivities
might be more common in people in the general population who
show a greater aﬃnity for music and musical activities. Indeed,
professional musicians report more sound-related problems
such as tinnitus, hyperacusis, and diplacusis than would be
expected based on their age and gender (Kähäri et al., 2003,
2004; Jansen et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2010; Schink et al., 2014;
Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2015; Di Stadio et al., 2018). Although
there are many anecdotal accounts of musicians who experience
misophonia (Kuehn, 2015), few studies have directly examined
whether musicians are more likely than non-musicians to
experience misophonia. In one study, “noise sensitivity” did
not diﬀer for musicians and non-musicians (although it did
negatively predict music listening and enjoyment) (Kliuchko
et al., 2015); however, noise sensitivity as measured was
not equivalent to misophonia (Weinstein, 1978). A recent
study showed that, compared with non-musicians, self-reported
misophonia was in fact lower for musicians who practiced from
1 to 7 h per day (Siepsiak et al., 2020). It is unclear whether
this result implies that those with a propensity toward music
training are actually less likely to experience misophonia, or if
misophonia might interfere with regular music practice. The
relationship between music training and sound oversensitivity
is further muddied by the fact that professional musicians
tend to have more long-term exposure to loud sounds (Jansen
et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2010; Schink et al., 2014), so many
of the sound-related problems reported above (e.g., tinnitus,
diplacusis) in professional musicians may be driven by low-level
damage to the auditory system and not necessarily by high-level
aversive reactions to sounds, as seen in misophonia (but see
Couth et al., 2020).
It is nevertheless also apparent that musicians diﬀer from
non-musicians in how they respond to a range of both musical
and non-musical sounds, particularly aﬀective sounds. There
is abundant evidence that, compared with non-musicians,
musicians exhibit enhanced processing of fundamental musical
components such as pitch, melody, timbre, chords, and musical
rhythm (Fran ˇek et al., 1991; Pantev et al., 2001; Micheyl et al.,
2006; Chen et al., 2008; Brattico et al., 2009; Repp, 2010;
Schellenberg and Moreno, 2010; Boh et al., 2011; Rammsayer
et al., 2012; Matthews et al., 2016). Musicians outperform
non-musicians at recognizing emotion conveyed in music
(Castro and Lima, 2014; Kantor-Martynuska and Horabik, 2015;
Akkermans et al., 2019; Dahary et al., 2020), they have more
consistent, more rapid, and/or more intense experiences of
both positive and negative musical emotion as reﬂected by
subjective arousal ratings and physiological responses (Steinbeis
et al., 2006; Brattico et al., 2009; Dellacherie et al., 2011;
Mikutta et al., 2014; Park et al., 2014), and these aﬀective
responses are driven by a distinct set of musical cues such asdissonance, mode (major/minor), and harmony (Schön et al.,
2005; James et al., 2008; Midya et al., 2019; Battcock and Schutz,
2021). Even the experience of frisson has been reported more
often in musicians than in non-musicians (Sloboda, 1991; but
see Grewe et al., 2007). Music training also predicts better
performance on non-musical speech and language processing
tasks and measures (Wong et al., 2007; Parbery-Clark et al.,
2009; Bidelman et al., 2013; Zuk et al., 2013; Coﬀey et al.,
2017). In particular, musicians outperform non-musicians at
identifying and responding to emotion in speech (Nilsonne and
Sundberg, 1985; Thompson et al., 2004; Lima and Castro, 2011).
This suggests that individuals who pursue music training or
who become professional musicians have enhanced aﬀective
responses to both musical and non-musical sounds.
Most studies of musicians and music training are
correlational, so it is unclear if the advantages and disadvantages
described above result from extensive practice and training-
driven plasticity, or if individuals with greater aptitude or
aﬃnity for music are more likely to pursue music training
or a career in music (Swaminathan and Schellenberg, 2018).
Importantly, formal music training is not necessary for listeners
to meaningfully relate to and engage with music. Over the
course of development, most adult listeners acquire informal
musical expertise through day-to-day exposure that allows
them to understand the nuances of music, such as generate
expectations about when and what will happen in the music,
detect wrong notes, dance and sing in synchrony with others,
and respond emotionally to music (Hannon and Trainor,
2007; Corrigall and Trainor, 2010, 2014; Hannon et al., 2018).
Although some evidence suggests that musicians and non-
musicians attend to diﬀerent structural features of music
while performing the same musical tasks (Midya et al., 2019;
Battcock and Schutz, 2021; Nave-Blodgett et al., 2021), this is
perhaps not surprising given that individual diﬀerences in many
aspects of music processing are robustly shaped by listening
experience, such as exposure to particular cultural traditions
or genres of music (Hannon and Trehub, 2005; Demorest
et al., 2008; Honing and Ladinig, 2009; Hannon et al., 2012;
Ullal et al., 2014). Musicians may therefore represent a rather
narrow segment of the general population, as robust and music-
speciﬁc behavioral and neural responses to music can also be
observed in individuals who have no formal music training
(Tervaniemi et al., 2006; Vanden Bosch der Nederlanden et al.,
2015; Mednicoﬀ et al., 2018; Boebinger et al., 2021; Jacoby
et al., 2021). Thus, focusing on diﬀerences between musicians
and non-musicians may not be as productive as examining
individual diﬀerences in musical skill and engagement in the
general, non-musician population, especially if we are interested
in understanding the development of predispositions toward
sound sensitivity.
Recent evidence has called into question the popular
assumption that music training and practice are the primary
drivers of the hearing-related skills and advantages observed
Frontiers in Neuroscience 08 frontiersin.org

fnins-16-924806 September 17, 2022 Time: 15:32 # 9
Mednicoff et al. 10.3389/fnins.2022.924806
in musically trained individuals. A number of tests are now
available to assess musical abilities in the general population,
such as the Goldsmith Musical Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI)
(Müllensiefen et al., 2014a,b), Musical Ear Test (Wallentin et al.,
2010), and Proﬁle of Music Perception Skills (Law and Zentner,
2012), and they have revealed considerable individual variation
in musical abilities even among individuals who have never had
formal music training. Formal music practice/training appears
to be only one of several factors (such as cognitive ability
and openness to experience) that predict variation in musical
abilities (Swaminathan and Schellenberg, 2018). Twin studies
suggest that music practice itself is highly heritable, and that
music ability is predicted by genetic relatedness and not by
practice (e.g., identical twins who diﬀer in practice nevertheless
have similar musical abilities) (Mosing et al., 2014). Recent
advances in genetics have even identiﬁed speciﬁc loci associated
with singing and musical pitch processing abilities (Ukkola et al.,
2009; Park et al., 2012; Tan et al., 2014).
Musical ability (rather than music training) also predicts
non-musical skills. For example, non-musicians with high
musical ability exhibit enhanced neural encoding of speech
comparable to what has been observed among highly trained
musicians (Mankel and Bidelman, 2018), and rhythm
perception ability predicts discrimination of speech phonemes
even after controlling for music training (Swaminathan and
Schellenberg, 2017). Similarly, vocal emotion recognition
(but not facial emotion recognition) is predicted by music
aptitude after controlling for music training, and untrained
individuals with high music aptitude were just as good as
trained musicians at identifying vocal emotion (Correia et al.,
2020). In one study with children aged 6–9, music ability
was correlated with language abilities, IQ, personality (only
openness to experience was included), and age, and the
relationship between musical and language abilities remained
even after controlling for music training (Swaminathan and
Schellenberg, 2020). This suggests that basic auditory skills
and musical aptitude vary meaningfully in the general adult
and child populations, and they predict not only musical
ability but also non-musical abilities relevant for speech
and emotion processing. Although these predispositions
presumably drive certain individuals to pursue music as a
hobby or profession, an open question is whether they also
predict that certain individuals will have stronger, more
intense experiences such as misophonia, ASMR, and frisson.
Another possibility, as noted above, is that individuals who
experience misophonia may be less drawn toward music and
less likely to have pleasurable auditory experiences from an
early age, or alternatively, perhaps musical activities reduce
misophonic reactions by providing more positive auditory
aﬀective experiences or by masking aversive sounds and
misophonic experiences (Jager et al., 2020; Siepsiak et al., 2020).
Research examining potential links between sound sensitivity
and musicality, particularly during childhood, might shedlight on individual risk factors for developing misophonia,
and they may inform treatments that entail using music as a
treatment for misophonia (Dozier, 2015a,b,c; Kuehn, 2015;
Potgieter et al., 2019).
Discussion
In this paper, we reviewed what is currently known about
the characterization and development of misophonic reactions,
developmental disorders that exhibit heightened sound
sensitivity or over-responsivity, and misophonia’s relationship
to other auditory emotional experiences, including music.
Rather than only examining misophonia in treatment-seeking
populations, this review aimed to also explore how misophonic
reactions may be experienced within the general population. To
do this, we discussed how individual diﬀerences in development,
auditory experiences, and musical predispositions might drive
certain people to have stronger aﬀective responses to sounds
and audiovisual stimuli. This could inﬂuence the likelihood of
individuals experiencing misophonia, ASMR, and frisson over
the course of development.
Future research should explore individual variation in high-
level auditory and aﬀective processing of sounds, including
music, to examine whether musicality might be related to
the development of other sound sensitivities. Given that very
few to any measures of sound-induced emotional experiences
(misophonia, ASMR, chills) have been validated with children
nor designed to be child-friendly (Schröder et al., 2013;
Roberts et al., 2020; Rinaldi et al., 2022), there is a need for
research examining the extent to which these experiences occur
during childhood, how they change over the course of typical
development, and whether or not they co-occur within the same
individuals. Such research would help identify risk factors for
misophonia and other sound sensitivities while also shedding
light on the development of misophonia.
Focusing on populations of individuals who exhibit
characteristics of a disorder but not a diagnosis can be helpful
for several reasons. First, misophonic reactions likely occur
in the general population to varying extents so understanding
this experience is important from a basic science perspective.
Second, there is a potentially useful tradition of studying non-
diagnosed individuals who exhibit psychiatric symptoms in the
broad eﬀort in order to identify endophenotypes (Gottesman
and Gould, 2003; Greenwood et al., 2013; Demetriou et al.,
2019), i.e., biomarkers that can help reveal the mechanistic
source of disorders. The reason this is useful is that only
studying those with a diagnosed disorder can lead to ambiguities
about whether potential biomarkers are closely tied to the
mechanistic basis of the disorder or if instead they are the
result of treatments or other consequences of having a chronic
disorder. Finally, studying naturalistic coping mechanisms in
non-diagnosed individuals who experience mild to moderate

Mednicoff et al. 10.3389/fnins.2022.924806
misophonic reactions could provide clues about how to treat
more severe, diagnosed cases of misophonia. For example, one
study (Jager et al., 2020) found that the majority of individuals
with misophonia (99%) self-report coping strategies that entail
listening to music or producing rhythmic noises that mimic
their misophonic triggers, highlighting the need for further
research on precisely how music as a stimulus might counter
the eﬀects of misophonic reactions. It would therefore be useful
to know if musical engagement could promote positive aﬀective
auditory experiences that ameliorate some of the problems
experienced by those suﬀering from misophonia, both in terms
of overall wellbeing beneﬁts of musical activities but also the
speciﬁc use of music and music-like stimuli as a coping strategy.
Lastly, because misophonic reactions are so common in the
general population, further research on these reactions could
be informative for basic questions about the development of
auditory aﬀective processing more generally.
