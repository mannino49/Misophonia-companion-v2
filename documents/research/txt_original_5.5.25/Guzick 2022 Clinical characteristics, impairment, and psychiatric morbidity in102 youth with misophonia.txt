Abstract  
Background : There  is little information  on the clinical  presentation,  functional  impact,  and 
psychiatric  characteristics  of misophonia  in youth,  an increasingly  recognized  syndrome  
characterized  by high emotional  reactivity  to certain  sounds  and associated  visual  stimuli.  
Method:  One-hundred -two youth  (8-17 years -old) with misophonia  and their parents  were  
recruited  and compared  with 94 youth  with anxiety  disorders.  Participants  completed  validated  
assessments  of misophonia  severity,  quality  of life, as well as psychiatric  symptoms  and 
diagnoses .  
Results:  The most  common  misophonia  triggers  included  eating  (96%),  breathing  (84%),  throat  
sounds  (66%),  and tapping  (54%).  Annoyance/irritation,  verbal  aggression,  avoidance  behavior , 
and family  impact  were  nearly  universal.  Misophonia  severity  was associated  with internalizing  
symptoms,  externalizing  behaviors  (child -report),  and poorer  quality  of life. High  rates  of 
comorbidity  with internalizing  and neurodevelopmental  disorders  were  found.  Quality  of life and 
externalizing  behaviors  were  not significantly  different  between  misophonia  and anxiety  
samples;  internalizing  symptoms  and autism  characteristics  were  significantly  higher  among  
youth  with anxiety  disorders.  
Limitations:  This self-selected  sample  showed  limited  multicultural  diversity.  
Conclusion s: This study  presents  misophonia  as a highly  impairing  psychiatric  syndrome.  
Future  interdisciplinary  work  should  clarify  the mechanisms  of misophonia,  establish  evidence -
based  treatments,  and extend  these findings  to randomly  sampled  and more  culturally  diverse  
populations.

Introduction  
Misophonia  is characterized  by strong,  unpleasant  emotional  reactions  to certain  sound s 
and associated  visual  stimuli  (Lewin  et al., 2021;  Potgieter  et al., 2019;  Rosenthal  et al., 2021;  
Swedo  et al., 2022) . Although  not a formal  diagnosis  in the DSM -5 or ICD-11, misophonia  has 
been  increasingly  studied  and recognized  in clinical  practice  since  it was first described  in the 
early  2000’s  by audiologists  treating  individuals  with decreased  sound  tolerance  (Jastreboff  and 
Jastreboff,  2000;  Potgieter  et al., 2019;  Swedo  et al., 2022) . Misophonia  symptoms  can arise  at 
any age, though  most  retrospective  studies  of adults  with misophonia  suggest  onset  during  
childhood  or adolescence. (Claiborn  et al., 2020; Jager  et al., 2020;  Potgieter  et al., 2019) .  
Unfortunately,  there  is an extreme  paucity  of research  on individuals  with misophonia  across  the 
lifespan,  but especially  among  youth.  Without  systematic  data on the clinical  presentation  of 
misophonia  in children  and adolescents , researchers  and clinicians  will be unable  to develop  an 
understanding  of this condition  and its treatment . 
 Adults  with misophonia  experience  disturbing  and often  intense  emotional  reactions  to 
sound  triggers  including  annoyance,  disgust,  anger,  hatred,  panic,  and aggression  (Claiborn  et al., 
2020;  Jager  et al., 2020;  Potgieter  et al., 2019;  Rouw  and Erfanian,  2018) . Physical  reactions  
may include  muscle  tension,  heavy  breathing,  as well as physical  or verbal  outbur sts (Claiborn  et 
al., 2020;  Jager  et al., 2020;  Potgieter  et al., 2019;  Rouw  and Erfanian,  2018) . In several  studies  
examining  adult  samples  comprised  mostly  of females  with moderate  to severe  misophonia  
symptoms  (Claiborn  et al., 2020;  Jager  et al., 2020;  Rouw  and Erfanian,  2018;  Wu et al., 2016) , 
the most  common  sound  triggers  were  oral or eatin g sounds  in addition  to nasal  or breathing  
sounds,  and repetitive  tapping  sounds  (e.g.,  with hands,  keyboards,  or pens)  (Claiborn  et al., 
2020;  Jager  et al., 2020;  Rouw  and Erfanian,  2018;  Wu et al., 2016) . Almost  all affected  Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof

individuals  report  severe  irritation  or anger  with triggers  and hyper -focus  on sounds,  with less 
common  emotional  responses  including  disgust and panic  (Jager  et al., 2020) . Many  others  
experience  feelings  of powe rlessness  and loss of control  (Jager  et al., 2020) . 
Four  studies have  investigated  comorbid  psychiatric  diagnoses;  in one clinic -based  study,  
28% of 575 adults  with misophonia  experienced  a comorbid  psychiatric  diagnosis,  most  
commonly  mood  (10%)  and anxiety  disorders  (9%) , as well as higher -than-expected  rates  of 
ADHD  (5%)  (Jager  et al., 2020) . Erfanian  et al. (2019)  found  that among  52 adults  with 
misophonia,  40% experienced  a psychiatric  disorder,  most  commonly  posttraumatic  stress  
disorder  (15%),  OCD  (11%),  and anorexia  (10%) . In another  study,  individuals  with misophonia  
had significantly  higher  rates  of psychiatric  comor bidity  than adults  with general  non-
misophonic  auditory  over-responsivity  and healthy  adults,  with 71% of those  with misophonia  
experiencing  a comorbid  psychiatric  disorder,  most  commonly  panic  disorder  (19%),  generalized  
anxiety  disorder  (15%),  social  anxiety disorder  (13%),  and major  depressive  disorder  (12%)  
(Siepsiak  et al., 2022) . Finally,  a study  with 207 adults  with misophonia,  the most  common  
comorbidities  were  anxiety  disorders  (57%),  major  depressive  disorder  (50%  lifetime;  7% 
current),  attention -deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (15%),  and posttraumatic  stress  disorder  (16%)  
(Rosenthal  et al., 2022) .The most  common  psychiatric  symptoms  in adults  with misophonia  
include  mood,  anxiety,  and obsess ive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  symptoms  or obsessive -
compulsive  personality  disorder  traits  (Claiborn  et al., 2020;  Jager  et al., 2020) . 
 Case  series  data among  children  with misophonia  suggest  a similar  pattern,  though  these 
studies  are limited  by very small  samples  (Dover  and McGuire,  2021;  McGuire  et al., 2015;  
Muller  et al., 2018;  Reid  et al., 2016;  Sarigedik  and Yurteri,  2021) . Rinaldi  et al (2022 a) 
identified  15 children  with elevated  misophonia  symptoms  through  population  screening  rather Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof

than self-identification  or presentation  for treatment.  In this sample , 9 participants  were  female  
with a mean  age of 11.7 years  and 6 participants  were  male  with a mean  age of 11 years  (Rinaldi  
et al., 2022 a). These  children  showed  poorer  health -related  quality -of-life than peers  and higher  
traits  associated  with anxiety  and OCD  (Rinaldi  et al., 2022 a) as well as autistic  traits  across  
several  social -cognitive  domains,  including  attention -switching,  communication,  social  skills,  
attention  to detail,  and imagination  (Rinaldi  et al., 2022 b). 
 To address  the absence  of data describing  misophonia  in youth,  this study  evaluated  
clinical  data from  a sample  of 102 children  and adolescents  meeting  the proposed  diagnostic  
criteria  for misophonia  (Swedo  et al., 2022) . First,  the study  aimed  to describe  the clinical  
phenomenology  of youth  with misophonia,  including  age, gender  distribution,  types  and 
frequency  of misophonia  triggers,  misophonia -related  emotions,  frequency  of aggression  
responses,  avoidance  behaviors,  and areas  and degree  of impairment.  It was expected  that anger  
and irritability  would  be the most  common  emotional  experiences,  eating  and breathing  sounds  
the most  common  trigger  sounds,  and that the majority  of the sample  would  be female.  Second,  
the study  evaluated  association s between  misophonia  severity  and psychiatric  symptoms  as well 
as quality  of life. It was expected  that this sample  of children  and adolescents  with misophonia  
would  have  high rates  of comorbid  mood,  anxiety,  and obsessive -compulsive  disorders  as well as 
elevated  autism  spectrum  symptoms  based  on strong  associations  between  misophonia  and 
psychiatric  symptoms  in existing  reports  on misophonia  in children  and adolescents  as well as 
those  in adults  (Cusack  et al., 2018;  Erfanian  et al., 2019;  Jager  et al., 2020;  Rinaldi  et al., 2022 a; 
Rinaldi  et al., 2022 b). Exploratory  analyses  investig ated whether  youth  with misophonia  differed  
significant ly in these  factors  compar ed to youth  with anxiety  disorders.

Procedures  
Youth  with suspected  misophonia  were  recruited  via online  advertisements,  
misophonia /anxiety -focused  social  media  pages,  as well as clinical  and professional  networks . 
Youth  with suspected  anxiety  disorders  were  also recruited  to serve  as a non-misophonia  clinical  
comparison  group , as these  disorders  are also characterized  by heightened  emotional  reactivity  to 
specific  stimuli. The majority  of participants  were  recruited  via online  advertisement s.  
Participants  and their parents  assented/consented  to participate  in the study  during  an 
initial  video  call. Inclusion  criteria  for both samples  were : 1) being  8-17 years,  2) paren t 
willingness  to participate,  3) English  fluency . For the misophonia  group,  an additional  criterion  
was: clinically  significant  misophonia  symptoms  based  on a score  of at least 10 on the A-MISO -
S, indicating  at least moderate  misophonia  (Schröder  et al., 2013) . For the anxiety  group,  
additional  inclusion  criteria  were:  1) a Parent -report  Multidimensional  Anxiety  Scale  for 
Children  (MASC)  T-Score  of at least 60, 2) an anxiety  disorder  diagnosis  on the Mini  
International  Neuropsychiatric  Interview  for Children  and Adolescents  (MINI -KID) , and 3) a 
score  of ≤4 on the A-MISO -S, corresponding  with subclinical  misophonia  symptoms . 
After  consent  and screening,  participants  were  scheduled  for a separate  assessment  video  
that included  online  questionnaires  and a clinical  interview  which  included  the Misophonia  
Assessment  Interview  (MAI)  (Lewin,  2020;  Lewin  et al., 2021)  and the MINI -KID (Sheehan  et 
al., 2010)  Interviewers  were  research  coordinators  with a bachelor’s degree  in psychology  or a 
related  field (e.g.,  neuroscience)  or doctoral  students  in professional  psychology.  Training  
included  didactic  presentations  on the MINI -KID and MAI,  observation  and co-rating  of 
assessments  with a trained  rater,  and weekly  supervision  with a licensed  psychologist  to ensure  
valid ity and reliability  of assessments.  Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof

The Institutional  Review  Board  at Baylor  College  of Medicine  approved  the study.  All 
portions  of the study  were  completed  virtually.   
Participants  
One-hundred  and twelve  youth  with suspected  misophonia  and 140 youth  with suspected  
anxiety  disorders  were  recruited . Of the 112 youth  in the misophonia  group , 102 were  included  
in analyses;  of the 140 in the anxiety  group,  94 were  included.  Reasons  for exclusion  in the 
misophonia  group  included  too mild misophonia  symptoms  (Amsterdam  Misophonia  Scale  [A-
MISO -S] score  <10),  n = 5 (5%),  or failed  attempts  to schedule  an assessment  visit after the 
initial  informed  consent  video  call, n = 5 (5%).  Reasons  for exclusion  in the anxiety  group  
included:  MASC  score  below  the clinical  cutoff,  n = 26 (19%),  A-MISO -S score  too high,  9 
(6%),  no anxiety  disorder  as assessed  on the MINI -KID, n = 9 (6%) , and failed  attempts  to 
schedule  an assessment  visit after the initial  informed  consent  video  call, n = 2 (1%). 
Measures  
Misophonia  characteri stics.   The Misophonia  Assessment  Interview  (Lewin,  2020)  is a series  
of questions  evaluating  symptoms  of sound  sensitivity,  enhanced  emotional  and physical  
reactions  to sound  triggers,  and degrees  of avoidance  or interference  with daily  activit ies. Based  
on the initially  proposed  diagnostic  criteria  for misophonia  by Schroeder  et al. (2013) , it asks 
about  specific  sound  triggers,  emotional  responses,  and avoidance  behaviors.  It was developed  to 
follow  the format  of a commonly  used diagnostic  interview  using  the proposed  diagnostic  
criteria  of misophonia  for an ongoing  randomized  clinical  trial separate  from  this study  (Lewin  et 
al., 2021) . This assessment  was only administered  to the misophonia  sample.  Responses  to items  
on the MAI  are presented  descriptively  to characterize  the presentation  of misophonia  in youth.  Journal Pre-proof

Misophonia  severity.   The A-MISO -S, adapted  from  the Yale -Brown  Obsessive  Compulsive  
Scale  (Y-BOCS)  (Goodman,  1989;  Goodman  et al., 1989) , is a commonly  used measure  of 
misophonia  severity  (Schröder  et al., 2013)  that has shown  strong  psychometric  properties  as a 
self-report  measure  in college  students , including  good  internal  consistency  and a single -factor  
structure  that explained  45% of the variance  in item responses  (Naylor  et al., 2021) . It includes  
six 0-4 Likert  scale  items  assessing  time taken  by symptoms,  functional  impairment,  emotional  
distress,  resistance  against  symptoms,  control  over symptoms,  and avoidance.  It was 
administered  as a child -report  measure  in this study,  which  has showed  adequate  psychometric  
properties  in youth  with misophonia , including  a clear  single -factor  structure  as well as adequate  
convergent  validity  and internal consistency  (Blinded , under  review) . Because  it was developed  
for adults , to administer  the measure  in a developmentally -tailored  manner , the measure  was 
presented  to youth  with a trained  assessor  present  to provide  additional  clarifications  on items 
when  youth  had questions . Item 4 was not included  in the total score  because  this item does not 
contribute  to overall  severity  and the measure  has been  shown  to be more  internally  consistent  
without  it (Blinded ., under  review) ; in this sample,  internal  consistency  was α = .68 with all 6 
items  and α = .76 with 5 items,  so the 5-item version  was used.  The MAQ  aids in measuring  
misophonia  severity  by evaluating  the negative  impact  of misophonia  symptoms  on an 
individual ’s activities,  thoughts,  and emotions  (Dozier,  2015;  Johnson  and Dozier,  2013) . It 
includes  21 items  score d on a 0-3 Likert  scale  and has also shown  strong  psychometric  properties  
for both the child -reported  (C-MAQ)  and parent -reported  (P-MAQ)  versions , including  strong  
internal  consistency  and convergent  validity  (Blinded,  under  review) . The overall  MAQ  
misophonia  scale  was used in the present  study and showed  high internal  consistency  in this 
sample;  C-MAQ:  α = .94; P-MAQ:  α = .93.   Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof

Psychiatric  diagnoses.  Psychiatric  diagnoses  were  assessed  with the MINI -KID, a commonly  
used and well-validated  psychiatric  interview  based  on DSM -5 and ICD-11 criteria.  The MINI -
KID has shown  strong  psychometric  properties  in general  and clinical  populations  (Boyle  et al., 
2017;  Duncan  et al., 2018;  Sheehan  et al., 2010) . It is designed  to be a streamlined  diagnostic  
interview  that can be administered  by raters  with a range  of training  under  the supervision  of an 
experienced  clinician  (Sheehan  et al., 2010 ). 
Emotional  and behavioral  functioning.  The parent -report Child  Behavior  Checklist  (CBCL)  
and child -report  Youth  Self Report  (YSR)  are well-validated,  broadband  measures  of childhood  
psychopathology  that include  112 0-2 Likert  scale  items  (Achenbach  and Rescorla,  2001) . The 
CBCL/YSR  generates  internalizing  and externalizing  scale s that correspond  to mood/anxiety  
symptoms  and disruptive  behavior  symptoms,  respectively  (Achenbach  and Rescorla,  2001) . 
Both  subscales  across  child - and parent -report  showed  high internal  consistency  in this sample;  
CBCL -externalizing:  α = .89; CBCL -internalizing:  α = .89; YSR-externalizing:  α = .83; YSR -
internalizing:  α = .90. 
Autism  spectrum  features.  The Social  Responsiveness  Scale,  Second  Edition  (SRS -2) is a 
measure  of deficits  in social  adaptive  functioning  and a commonly  used,  well-validated  
evaluation  of ASD  that includes  65 items  score d on a 0-3 Likert  scale  (Bruni,  2014;  Constantino  
and Gruber,  2012) . It contains  sub-domains  scoring  social  communication  and interaction  (SRS -
SCI)  as well as restricted  or repetitive  behavior  (SRS -RRB)  corresponding  with the symptom  
domains  of autism  spectrum  disorder  described  in the Diagnostic  and Statistical  Manual  of 
Mental  Disorders  (Constantino  and Gruber,  2012) . The SRS-2 shows  strong  psychometric  
properties  and high internal  consistency  in this sample,  SRS-SCI: α = .92; SRS-RRB:  α = .82. Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof

Quality  of life. PQLES -Q. The pediatric  version  of the Short  Form  of the Quality  of Life 
Enjoyment  and Satisfaction  Questionnaire  is a self-report  questionnaire  with items  scored  on a 1-
5 Likert  scale  that assesses  quality  of life among  children  and adolescents  (Endicott  et al., 2006) . 
It has shown  strong  internal  consistency,  test-retest  reliability,  and concurrent  validity  among  
both children  and adolescents  (Endicott  et al., 2006) . Internal  consistency  in this sample  was α = 
.89.  
Analysis  plan  
First,  data were  evaluated  for patterns  of missingness  and conformity  to normal  
distribution  assumptions.  Missing  data were  rare (two YSR,  one CBCL -Internalizing  subscale,  
one parent -report  MAQ , one SRS-RRB ), and thus completer -only analyses  were  conducted . Data  
were  not found  to show  significant  skewness  or kurtosis,  with all skewness  and kurtosis  statistics  
falling  within  -2 and +2, suggesting  they would  be appropriate  for parametric  analyses  (George  
and Mallery,  2010) .  
To evaluate  the clinical  characteristics  of youth with misophonia,  descriptive  information  
from  the Misophonia  Diagnostic  Interview  were  presented,  including  frequencies  of different  
trigger  sounds,  avoidance  behaviors,  aggression  responses,  and emotional  responses.  
Demographic  information  was also presented.  To evaluate  the psychiatric  morbidity  of the 
sample,  frequencies  of different  psychiatric  diagnoses  were  presented  as well as norm  referenced  
scale  scores  on the CBCL,  YSR,  and SRS-2. One-sample  t-tests comparing  mean  t-scores  for 
each subscale  with a population  mean  of 50 were  conducted  to estimate  significant  differences  
with typical  populations.  Independent  samples  t-tests evaluated  differences  in CBCL,  YSR,  and 
SRS-2 scores  between  the misophonia  and anxiety  groups.  Recruitment  targets  were  based on a 
power  analys is for a cluster  analysis  (in preparation ). For this study,  given power  = .80, alpha  = Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof

.01 (for all analyses,  p < .01 was interpreted  as significant  to minimize  family -wise error),  and 
sample  sizes  of 102 and 94, this study  was powered  to detect  a medium  between -group  effect  of 
d = .48. Within  the misophonia  sample,  partial  correlations  controlling  for age and gender  (male  
vs. non-male)  between  misophonia  symptom  severity  (using  the A-MISO -S and MAQ)  and 
psychiatric  symptom  scales  (CBCL  and YSR) , quality  of life (PQ-LES-Q), and autistic  features  
(SRS -2) were  conducted.  With  102 participants,  given  power  = .80 and alpha  = .01, this study  
was powered  to detect  small -to-medium  correlations  (r = .33).  
Results  
Sample  demographics  
 The majorit y of the misophonia  sample  identified  as White  (87%)  and female  (68%).  The 
mean  age of the sample  was 13.7 years  (SD = 2.5) and the mean  age of misophonia  onset  was 8.8 
years  (SD = 3.0). The majority  of the anxiety  sample  also identified  as White  (71%)  and female  
(57%),  with a mean  age of 12.4 years.  The misophonia  group  was significantly  older  and had a 
significantly  higher  proportion  of participants  who identified  as White  (see Table  1). A summary  
of demographic  information  is presented  in Table  1. 
Clinic al characteristics  of misophonia  in youth  
 Among  youth  with misophonia,  the most  common  trigger  sounds  included:  eating  sounds  
(people  eating/chewing/swallowing/lip  smacking/slurping/teeth  tapping),  n = 98 (96%),  
breathing  sounds  (people  breathing/sniffing /exhaling/inhaling/yawning),  n = 86 (84%),  throat  
noises  (people  making  throat  clearing  sounds/coughing),  n = 67 (66%),  tapping  (people  tapping  
with hands,  feet, or object),  n = 55 (54%),  specific  language  sounds  or tones,  rustling  sounds  
(rustling/clatter ing of paper,  plastic,  or aluminum  foil),  n = 37 (36%),  and environmental  sounds  
(clocks,  engines,  appliances),  n = 29 (28%).  See Figure  1 for a summary.  Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof

Figure  1 Here  
Most  youth  with misophonia  reported  experiencing  annoyance/irritation,  n = 99 (97%)  or 
anger,  n = 97 (95%)  when  hearing  (or anticipating  hearing)  trigger  noises.  Other  emotional  
responses  or anticipatory  emotions  were  also frequently  endorsed,  including  a general  feeling  of 
distress,  n = 95 (93%),  worry/anxiety,  n = 81 (79%),  disgust,  n = 69 (68%),  and 
sadness/depression,  n = 44 (43%).  Importantly,  emotional  responses  were  assessed  as in response  
to or in anticipation  of hearing  triggers  without  specifically  distinguishing  between  them.  A high 
portion  also endorsed  a history  of aggressive  responses,  most  frequently  verbal  aggression,  n = 
87 (85%),  though  physical  aggression  was also common  (including  aggressive  outbursts  or 
damage  to objects/property),  n = 51 (50%).  Avoidance  of specific  situations  was common  as 
well,  most  frequently  famil y members,  n = 82 (80%),  and meals,  n = 77 (76%).  Most  of the 
sample  endorsed  specific  modifications,  anticipatory  avoidance,  or reactive  avoidance  behaviors,  
most  commonly  covering  ears with hands,  n = 94 (92%),  using  protective  equipment  like 
headphones,  n = 93 (91%),  or eating  privately  or with special  arrangements  (e.g.,  apart  from  
siblings),  n = 86 (84%).  A summary  of these  data is presented  in Figure  2.

Psychiatric  morbidity  
 Psychiatric  morbidity  in the misophonia  sample  was high,  with 81 participants  (79%)

major  depressive  disorder  (current  or past),  n = 48 (47%),  with 15 (15%)  experiencing  a current  
depressive  episode  at the time of assessm ent. Nearly  half were  experiencing  a current  anxiety  or 
obsessive -compulsive  disorder,  n = 46 (45%);  the most  commonly  anxiety  disorders  were  social  
anxiety  disorder,  n = 31 (30%)  and generalized  anxiety  disorder  n = 27 (27%).  Obsessive -Journal Pre-proof

compulsive  disorder  occurred  in 8 participants  (8%).  Other  common  diagnoses  included  
attention -deficit/hyperactivity  disorder,  n = 21 (21%)  and chronic  tic disorders,  n = 13 (13%).

 Youth  were  found  to have  clinically  elevated  internalizing  symptoms  per both youth  and 
parent -report,  YSR -Internalizing  M (SD)  = 67.1 (14.2); CBCL -Internalizing  M (SD)  = 69.8 
(16.5). These  values  were  significantly  higher  than what  would  be expected  in a randomly  
sampled  population,  YSR -Internalizing:  t (100) = 12.12 , d = 1.21, p < .001;  CBCL -Internalizing:  
t (99) = 11.95, d = 1.20, p < .001.  Using  the CBCL  cutoff  of a T-score  of 70 representing  the 
clinical  range,  clinically  elevated  internalizing  symptoms  were  reported  in 44 youth  with 
misophonia  (43%)  based  on child -report  and 46 youth  (45%)  based  on parent -report.  On average,  
externalizing  symptoms  were  in the non-clinical  range  per child - or parent -report,  YSR -
Externalizing  M (SD)  = 55.4 (8.4);  CBCL -Externalizing  M (SD)  = 52.0 (9.8). The YSR -
Externalizing  subscale  was significantly  higher  than what  might  be expected  in a typically  
developi ng sample,  t (100) = 6.51, d = 0.65, p < .001,  though  the CBCL -Externalizing  was not, t 
(99) = 2.03, d = 0.20, p = .045.  Three  youth  with misophonia  (3%)  self-reported  clinically  
elevated  externalizing  symptoms  and 6 (6%)  parent -reported  clinically  elevated  externalizing  
symptoms.  
On average,  youth  with misophonia  did not show  elevated  scores  on the SRS-SCI, M 
(SD)  = 55.0 (9.3), or the SRS-RRB,  M (SD)  = 53.9 (10.1), though  these  values  were  significantly  
higher  than what  would  be expected  in a random ly sampled  population  with a mean of 50, SRS-
SCI, t(101)  = 5.49,  d = 0.54, p < .001;  t(100)  = 3.91,  d = .39, p < .001.  Using  a T-score  of 70 as Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof

representing  the clinical  range,  8 (8%)  were  found  to have  clinically  elevated  scores  on the SRS-
SCI and 11 (11% ) on the SRS-RRB.   
The most  common ly endorsed  areas  of misophonia -related  impairment  were  family  
life/relationships,  n = 95 (93%),  interacting  with people,  n = 51 (50%),  learning/homework,  n = 
44 (43%),  and being  in public,  n = 41 (40%).  A complete  summary  of these  data is presented  in

Comparing  psychiatric  symptoms  in anxiety  and misophonia  samples . For all comparison s, 
age-normed  T-scores  were  used.  The anxiety  group  had significantly  higher  scores  on both the 
YSR -Internalizing,  t (191)  = 3.49,  p < .001,  d = .50, and CBCL -Internalizing  subscales,  t (192)  = 
3.52,  p < .001,  d = .51. Externalizing  symptoms  were  not significantly  different  between  the 
anxiety  and misophonia  groups,  YSR -Externalizing:  t (191)  = 1.49,  p = .14, d = .21; CBCL -
Externalizi ng: t (194)  = 1.72,  p = .087,  d = .25. Youth  with anxiety  disorders  were  found  to have  
significantly  higher  scores  on the SRS-SCI, t (194)  = 3.82,  p < .001,  d = .55., and the SRS-RRB,  
t (192)  = 3.07,  p = .002,  d = .44. There  were  no significant  differences  between  the samples  in 
PQLES -Q scores,  t (192)  = 0.39,  p = .70, d = .056.  
A linear  regression  was conducted  controlling  for race (White  vs. non-White)  and an 
identical  pattern  of significance  emerged . Specifically,  when controlling  for race,  misophonia  
sample  membership  was associated  with less severe  CBCL -Internalizing , β = -.26, p < .001, ΔR2

with CBCL -Externalizing,  β = -.14, p = .051, ΔR2 = .020, YSR -Externalizing,  β = -.11, p = .13, 
ΔR2 = .012, or PQLES -Q scores ,  β = -.038, p = .61, ΔR2 = .001. 
Clinical  correlates  Journal Pre-proof

Within  the misophonia  sample,  when  controlling  for age and gender,  both the P-MAQ  
and C-MAQ  were  associated  with a number  of other  clinical  measures,  including  the YSR -
Internalizing  subscale,  the YSR -Externalizing  subscale,  the CBCL -Internalizing  subscale,  the 
MASC , and the P-QLES -Q. The A-MISO -S was not significantly  associated  with any of the 
tested  variables,  though  was modestly  associated  with the following  variables  at a trend  level:  
YSR -Internalizing,  CBCL -Externalizing,  SRS-RRB,  and PQLES -Q. See Table  2 for a summary

Discussion  
 This study  describe d the clinical  presentation  of misophonia  in a large  cohort  of children  
and adolescents.  Consistent  with studies  in adults  (Claiborn  et al., 2020;  Jager  et al., 2020;  Rouw  
and Erfanian,  2018;  Wu et al., 2016) , the most  prevalent  trigger  noises  included  those  related  to 
eating,  breathing,  or making  throat  noises,  though  other  trigg ers were  common  as well (e.g.,  
tapping,  paper  rustling). The most  common  emotional  responses  were  anger  and 
annoyance/irritation,  though  there  was a significant  mix of emotional  responses,  with 
participants  also describing  anxiety,  disgust,  and sadness  as well in reaction  to or in anticipation  
of trigger  noises.  Avoidance  behaviors  were  nearly  ubiquitous,  with the most  frequently  
endorsed  behaviors  including  covering  ears (with  hands  or noise -blocking  devices  such as 
headphones),  avoiding  places  involving  eating,  and avoiding  specific  people,  most  commonly  
family  members.  Nearly  all youth  had become  verbally  aggressive  in response  to trigger  noises  
at some  point,  and over half had engaged  in physical  aggression.  Interference  with family  life 
was reported  in nearly  every  participant,  though  interference  with social  life outside  the family  
was also present  in over half the sample,  and interference  with various  other  areas  of life were  
also commonly  endorsed  (e.g.,  school,  learning/homework).  Misophonia  severity  was associated  Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof

with poorer  quality  of life, which  was reported  at similar  levels  as youth  with anxiety  disorders,  a 
population  who consistently  report  quality  of life impairments  compared  with typically  
developing  youth  (Bastiaansen  et al., 2004;  Ramsawh  and Chavira,  2016) . Also  consistent  with 
reports  in adults  (Claiborn  et al., 2020;  Jager  et al., 2020;  Rouw  and Erfanian,  2018) , most  
participants  were  female,  although  the self-referred  nature  of the sample  warrants  caution  in 
interpreting  this trend . The age-of-onset  was just younger  than 9, which  aligns  with the lower  
end of the estimates  that have  been  reported  in adults  (Claiborn  et al., 2020;  Jager  et al., 2020;  
Rouw  and Erfanian,  2018) , as would  be expected  in a study  focused  on youth.  
High  rates  of psychiatric  comorbidity  were  noted  in this sample,  with 80% meeting  
criteria  for at least one disorder.  The most  common  psychiatric  diagnoses  were  social  anxiety  
disorder,  generalized  anxiety  disorder,  major  depressive  disorder,  and specific  phobias.  
Anecdotally,  during  interviews,  participants  frequently  described  feeling  depressed  because  of 
the isolation  and distress  caused  by misop honia.  It is possible  there  is a similar  causal  pathway  
with social  anxiety  in severe  cases  of misophonia,  as social  avoidance  and interference  was very 
commonly  reported  in this sample.  Significant,  medium -to-large  associations  between  the parent - 
and child-report  MAQ  (assessing  misophonia  symptoms ) and anxiety,  internalizing  symptoms,  
quality  of life, and externalizing  symptoms  were  found,  further  supporting  a link between  
misophonia  and psychiatric  symptoms.  It is worth  noting  more  consistent  and larger  associations  
between  psychiatric  symptom  measures  and the MAQ  relative  to the A-MISO -S, whose  items  
assess  the impact  of misophonia  (e.g.,  “My sound  issues  currently  make  me unhappy;”  “My 
sound  issues  currently  interfere  with my social  life”),  relative  to items  more  directly  assessing  
misophonia  severity  on the A-MISO -S (e.g.,  “How  much  distress  do the misophonic  triggers  
cause  you” ?). Reliability  was also higher  on the MAQ,  which  may have  contributed  to Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof

differential  associations . This highlights  the need  for rigorous  psychometric  testing  and 
refinement  of misophonia  assessments  in youth,  which  are only beginning  to be conducted  
(Blinded  et al., under  review;  Rinaldi  et al., 2022 a). 
These  comorbidity  findings  were  consistent  with two studies  in adults  (Rosenthal  et al., 
2022;  Siepsiak  et al., 2022) , though  contras ted two others  that recruited  patients  as part of clinic  
flow,  which  found  lower  rates  of comorbidity  (Erfanian  et al., 2019;  Jager  et al., 2020 , though  
higher -than-expected  depression  and ADHD  were  noted  in Jager  et al., 2020 ). It is possible  this 
discrepancy  is due to the recruitment  methods  for these  different  studies;  the current  study  and 
the similar  adult  studies  used primarily  online  and community -based  recruitm ent whereas  
Erfanian  et al. (2019)  included  both psychiatry  and audiology  clinic  referrals,  the latter  of which  
may be less psychiatrically  affected.  Jager  et al. (2020)  may have  also had referral  patterns  that 
resulted  in a different  clinical  presentation . 
 Results  support  conceptualizing  misophonia  as a disorder  on the internalizing  spectrum,  
with high rates  of negative -valence  emotional  responses  to sound  triggers,  significant  
associations  with co-occurring  internalizing  symptoms,  and high comorbidity  with mood  and 
anxiety  disorders.  Further,  despite  frequently  reported  anger  outbursts  and family  conflict  tied to 
misophonia,  externalizing  symptoms  were  not significantly  different  from  youth  with anxiety  
disorders , and similar  to what  might  be expected  in a normative  sample  (Merikangas  et al., 
2010) , suggesting  it is likely  more  an “internalizing”  than “externalizing”  problem.  That said, the 
anxiety  disorder  group  reported  higher  internalizing  symptoms  than the misophonia  group . 
Although  this finding  may be related  to a measurement  artifact  (i.e., anxiety  is more  specifically  
assessed  on the CBCL  and YSR  than misophonia  symptoms ), it may also indicate  that 
categorizing  misophonia  as an internalizing  disorder  is an overly  simplistic  conclusion . Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof

To that end, beyond  internalizing  disorders,  there  were  high rates  of comorbidity  with 
several  diagnoses  beyond  what  would  be expected  in a randomly  selected  sample,  including  
chronic  tic disorders  (13%),  ADHD  (21%),  and OCD  (8%),  as well as high rates  of elevated  
autistic  characteristics  (8% with elevated  social  communication/interaction  difficulties;  10% with 
elevated  repetitive  behaviors  and focused  interests).  Rather  than being  linked  to one specific  
diagnosis,  it is likely  that shared  transdiagnostic  processes  across  these  diagnoses  led to this 
pattern.  One psychological  dimension  that may be implicated  across  these  disorders  is sensory  
dysregulation,  which  should  be more  thoroughly  investigated  in follow -up work  (Harrison  et al., 
2019) . Further  research  should  seek to better  understand  comorbidity  in misophonia,  as co-
occurring  psychiatric  diagnoses  likely  exist  due to shared  predispositions  (e.g.,  genetics,  
neurobiology,  behavioral  patterns)  as well as causal  pathways  (e.g.,  misophonia -related  isolation  
causing  depression  and social  anxiety).   
It is worth  noting  that the anxiety  sample  reported  significantly  higher  autistic  
characteristics  than the misophonia  sample, and further,  that misophonia  symptoms  were  not 
correlated  with autism  characteristics , consistent  with a large  study  in adults  (Jager  et al., 2020) . 
Autism  features  have  been  found  to be elevated  in youth  with misophonia  relative  to non-
misophonia  controls  in prior  work  (Rinaldi  et al., 2022 b); it is plausible  that some  may consider  
this finding  reflective  of some  specific  relationship  between  autism  and misophonia,  particularly  
when  considering  the phenomenological  simila rities  in sound  sensitivity  in these  syndromes,  
which  are rarely  seen in other  populations.  When comparing  with a relevant  psychiatric  control  
in this study , the autism -misophonia  connection  appears  less specific  and further  supports  the 
notion  that there  may be other  underlying  dimensions  across  these  conditions  (e.g.,  emotional  Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof

and sensory  hyperreactivity ), rather  that misophonia  reflecting  a symptom  of some  other  
diagnosis.  
. A clear  understanding  of the clinic al presentation  of misophonia  in youth  provides  a 
much -needed  foundation  for interdisciplinary  work  investigating  the mechanisms  of this 
disorder,  which  will inform  innovative  treatment  development.  For example,  avoidance  behavior  
was very commonly  reporte d in this sample,  both in anticipation  of and in response  to trigger  
noises  (e.g.,  using  headphones,  avoiding  family  members,  avoiding  meals).  Behavioral  and 
emotional  avoidance  is considered  to play a central  role in the development  and maintenance  of 
mood, anxiety,  and obsessive -compulsive  disorders  in youth , and thus has become  a key 
treatment  target  of cognitive -behavioral  therapies , and it is reasonable  to expect  it would  play a 
similar  role in misophonia  (Chu,  2013;  Kennedy  and Ehrenreich -May,  2017) .  
 This study  had several  limitations.  First,  participants  primarily  identified  as White  and 
English  speaking;  further  work is needed  to understand  misophonia  in culturally  diverse  
populations.  The comparison  anxiety  group  was significantly  younger  and less frequently  
identified  as White;  although  age-corrected  scores  were  used in comparison  analyses  and the 
pattern  of result s did not change  when  statistically  controlling  for race, results  should  be 
considered  within  this possible  limitation.  Similarly,  the misophonia  sample  was recruited  
predominantly  from  online  support  communities,  and may reflect  youth  with more  severe,  
primary  misophonia , and results  may be less generalizable  to youth  with misophonia  sampled  
from  the general  population,  or youth  with misophonia  as a secondary  diagnosis.  Another  
limitation  of this study  was the use of misophonia  assessments  with only prelim inary  
psychometric  validation ; unfortunately  no validated  assessments  were  available  when  this study  
began  and thus we adapted  measures  from  the adults  literature  to draw  conclusions.  Rigorous  Journal Pre-proof
Journal Pre-proof

development  of psychometrically  validated  assessment  for misoph onia severity  and diagnosis  are 
needed  in the future.  Further,  only auditory  triggers  were  assessed  in this study  despite  an 
increasing  appreciation  of visual  triggers  in the clinical  presentation  of misophonia  (Swedo  et al., 
2022)  Further  research  is also needed  to understand  clinical  features  of misophonia  from  
interdisciplinary  perspectives  (e.g.,  audiological  and neurobiological  evaluations  were  not 
included  in this study)  and in comparison  with other  populations  (e.g.,  autistic  youth).   
 This study  provided  foundational  data on the clinical  presentation  of misophonia  in 
youth,  confirming  a highly  impairing  clinical  presentation  that is congruent  with reports  in adults  
while  adding  an important  developmental  perspective.  Further  research  is needed  to understand  
the mechanisms  of this disorder  to inform  treatment  development.

Highlights  
 Misophonia was associated with substantial  functional impairment in this sample  
 Anger/irritation, avoidance behavior, and impact to family life were nearly universal  
 Anxiety disorders were common  (45%)  as were current or past depressive disorders (46%)  
 Other common comorbidities were attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder  (21%) and tic 
disorders (13%)  
 Youth with misophonia had  elevated internalizing symptoms and autism features relative to 
population norms  (though less than youth with anxiety disorders)
