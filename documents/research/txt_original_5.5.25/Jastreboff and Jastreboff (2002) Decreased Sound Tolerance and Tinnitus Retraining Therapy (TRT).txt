## Decreased Sound Tolerance and Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT)

MARGARET M. JASTREBOFF AND PAWEL J. JASTREBOFF Emory Univ~rsity School  of Medicine, Atlanta, USA

The main  objective  of Tinnitus  Retraining  Therapy (TRT)  is  habituation  of activation  of the  autonomic nervous  system,  evoked by  signals present in  the auditory pathways.  Sound therapy aims  at decreasing the strength of these signals. The same systems in the brain  are  involved  in  tinnitus  and  decreased  sound tolerance,  and  the  same basic  neurophysiological mechanisms  are  utilised for  decreasing  the  tinnitus› related  neuronal  activity  and,  in  case of hyperacusis, abnormally  enhanced activity  induced by  external sounds.  The  similarity  of TRT treatment between tinnitus  and  misophonia is  even  closer,  as  in  both situations  the  goal  is  to  achieve  extinction  of functional  connections  between  the  auditory  and  the limbic and autonomic nervous systems. The increased gain  within  the  auditory  pathways  that  are  presum› ably  responsible  for  hyperacusis  could  enhance  the tinnitus  signal,  thus  it is  possible  to  expect coexis› tence of tinnitus  and hyperacusis,  and the predisposi› tion  of hyperacusis  patients  to  develop  tinnitus. As such,  for  some patients tinnitus  and  hyperacusis  may be  considered  the  double  manifestation  of the  same internal phenomenon.

that tinnitus is  a phantom auditory perception (i.e., it is  a real perception of a sound for which there  is  no  corresponding  physical  correlate) (Jastreboff,  1990).

Clinically-significant tinnitus  (i.e.,  creating problems to an extent that subjects are seeking professional help) involve a number of systems in the brain.  Since patients perceive tinnitus as a sound, therefore the tinnitus-related neuronal activity  is  present  within  the  auditory  path› ways.  The  symptoms  which  patients  experi› ence (anxiety,  annoyance,  strong  emotional reactions),  strongly suggest that the limbic and autonomic  nervous  systems  are  involved  as well,  and  that  activation  of these  systems  is responsible for  tinnitus  becoming  clinically› significant.  Recent  studies,  using  variety  of techniques,  strongly  supported this  postulate (Lockwood et aI.,  1996;  Lockwood et aI., 1998;  Langner &amp; Wallhdusser-Franke,  1999; Andersson et  aI.,  2000;  Mirz  et aI.,  2000; Lockwood et aI., 2001).

Tinnitus  perception is  not  governed by  the same principles  as  perception of external sounds.  Its  suppression is  not frequency dependent and does not show presence of the critical band,  with  contralateral  suppression frequently being at least as effective as ipsilat› eral  (Feldmann,  1971,  1988). It is  impossible to  observe beats  of tinnitus  with  external tones,  and  to  re-synthesise  tinnitus  by  any combination of external  sounds  (Penner, 1993).  These observations yielded a postulate

These concepts  were  developed in  the  80s, published in  1990 (J astreboff,  1990),  and  are presently known  as  the  neurophysiological model of tinnitus.  The  model  postulates  the involvement of both auditory and non-auditory systems in  cases  of clinically-significant tinni› tus.  In  these  cases,  the  focus  of attention  is predominantly on the  neurophysiology  of the limbic  and  autonomic  nervous  systems,  with the  auditory  system playing  only  secondary role in reactions to tinnitus. Part of the model is devoted to  neurophysiological  mechanisms,

which  could potentially  enhance  the  tinnitus› related  neuronal  activity  or  even  contribute  to its  generation,  while  the  main  part focuses  on functional  connections  between  auditory  and other systems in the brain. There is a consensus that auditory systems display an automatic gain control mechanism, and its  sensitivity depends on  the  average  environmental  sound level. .  Experimental results have shown that the sensitivity of the  single neurons  and their assembles in  the  auditory  pathways  indeed increases when  sound level is  low,  when  conductive hearing loss  is  induced,  and  finally  when  the cochlea  is  partially  or  totally  damaged (Gerken,  1979;  Sasaki  et al.,  1980;  Gerken  et aI.,  1984;  Gerken  et  aI. ,  1985;  Gerken  et  al., 1986; Salvi et aI.,  1992; Salvi et aI.,  1996).

On the  other hand,  the  observation  that 94% of subjects  developed tinnitus  when staying  in  the  anechoic  chamber for  few minutes  (Heller &amp; Bergman,  1953),  collabo› rated the possibility that enhanced sensitivity of the  peripheral  and  central  part  of the auditory  system could  contribute  to  tinnitus (lastreboff,  1990). It is  possible  to  envision, that  in  some  cases  tinnitus  and  decreased sound tolerance are two manifestations of the same internal phenomenon of increased gain within the  auditory  pathways  (Jastreboff, 1990;  lastreboff &amp; Hazell,  1993b).  This hypothesis  yielded  in  tum  a  prediction  that substantial  proportions  of tinnitus  patients should  exhibit decreased  sound tolerance  as well.  This postulate was in contrast to  litera› ture  stating  that  only  0.1 %  of tinnitus patients  showed symptoms  of hyperacusis (Vernon,  1987). This  was  rather  surprising, as  analysis  of physiological  mechanisms  of the  neurophysiological model  of tinnitus suggested  that  the  same  ne(works  are involved in tinnitus and some components of decreased sound tolerance.

The only approach to test if these theoreti› cal  predictions  were correct was  by evaluat› ing tinnitus patients for their sound tolerance. While there  is  no  consensus  regarding  a protocol for  the  evaluation  of decreased sound tolerance, there is a general agreement that  pure  tone  loudness  discomfort level

(LDL)  provides  a  reasonable  estimation  of the  problem.  From  1990, both  at  University of Maryland  at  Baltimore  and  at Emory University  in  Atlanta,  we  were  routinely evaluating LDL in  all  new  patients,  and during  some  follow-up  visits.  High  preva› lence  of decreased  sound  tolerance  was evident from the results  of the first group  of patients  (Jastreboff  et  aI., 1994)  and indicated that it might affect  about  40% of tinnitus  patients,  with  approximately  30% requiring  specific  treatment for  hyperacusis (Jastreboff et  aI.,  1999;  lastreboff &amp; lastre› boff 2000; lastreboff &amp; lastreboff,  2002). This  observation  has  been  confirmed  by other centers (Coles &amp; Sood,  1988; Hazell &amp; Sheldrake  1992;  Lux-Wellenhof,  1999; Fabijanska et al. ;  1999;  Gold  et  aI.,  1999; Pilgrarnrn et aI.,  1999; Gold et aI., 2002).

Decreased sound tolerance can have  an extremely strong impact on patients' lives. It can prevent pe9ple from  working,  social interaction,  or  participating  in  variety  of pleasant life  activities.  In  extreme  cases, decreased sound tolerance can totally control patients' lives.  Some patients  do  not  even leave  their  homes.  Not only  their lives,  but also  their families'  are  totally  controlled by the issue of avoidance of sound.

The most recent results  from  a  group  of 149  consecutive  patients  seen  at  Emory Tinnitus  and  Hyperacusis  Center in  Atlanta confirmed  high  level  of prevalence  of decreased  sound  tolerance  in  tinnitus patients.  For each patient,  during  the  initial visit  the  pure  tone  LDL  were  evaluated for both ears, for frequencies 0.5,  1, 2,  3, 4, 6,  8, 12  kHz. The  average  value  of LDL for  all frequencies and both ears, was calculated for each  patient.  The  mean LDL value for  all patients  was  88.66  dB  HL  with  standard deviation equal to 17.85 dB.

The cumulative distribution  of the  data (Figure  1)  provides  more  insight into  the patients' status: 62.4% of all patients have an average LDL  value below  100 dB  HL, 58.4% below 95 dB HL, 38.3% below 90 dB HL,  and  22.8%  below  80 dB  HL.  At  the same time  65.8%  of these patients  stated

during  the  initial  interview  that  they  experi› ence decreased sound tolerance.

The  average  of LDL for  patients  reporting problems  with  sound  tolerance  was  81.7  dB HL,  while  for  patients  not  perceiving a  problem  was  102.0 dB  HL.  These data are  consistent  with  our past results  where the  average  level  below  100  dB  HL  was suggested as  a indicator of potential problems (Jastreboff &amp; Hazell,  1993a), while an average value  below  90  dB  HL indicates  the  need for  a specific  treatment because  of decreased sound tolerance.

While average values of LDL provide some guideline for  diagnosis,  individual data show large  variability,  and  patients' complaints do  not  simplistically  correlate  with  values of LDL.  Some patients  with  normal  values of LDL exhibit strong  reactions  to  everyday sounds  (acceptable  by  others  in  their surrounding),  which  significantly  affect their life.  Other patients, with LDL in the range of 90 dB  HL,  do  not report  any  noticeable impact on life by  these  sounds.  Another group  may  have  LDL in  the  range  of 20-40 dB  HL but,  while reporting  the  problem  of the  decreased  sound  tolerance,  nevertheless they  are  able  to  tolerate  some  louder than indicated by  LDL  sounds  (e.g.,  normal  level of speech).  Many  patients  exhibit a different level  of tolerance  to  various  sounds,  which does  not correspond to  physical characterisa› tion  of these  sounds  (i.e., their  spectrum and overall intensity).

The simplest assumption that patients have phonophobia was  difficult to  accept.  The majority ' of these patient~ do  not  show elements  of a  classical  phobia,  and  further› more they  are  not afraid of sound but rather express  negative  feelings  and  dislike  of sound.  The analysis  of potential neurophysi› ological mechani~ms underlying reactions  of people  to  sound,  resulted  in  the  conclusion that  the  same  systems  in  the  brain  are involved  in  tinnitus  and  in decreased  sound tolerance (see Figure 2).

Considering potential  neurophysiological mechariisms involved in processing of signals within  the  auditory  pathways,  and  interaction of the auditory with other systems in the brain, we proposed that decreased  sound tolerance actually  consists  of two  components:  (a) hyperacusis  which reflects  abnormally  strong reactivity  of the  auditory  pathways  to  sound,

and only secondary yielding  activation of the limbic  and  autonomic  nervous  systems  (see Figure  3);  and  (b)  misophonia  (dislike  /  hate of sound)  which reflects  abnormally  strong reactions of the autonomic and limbic systems resulting from enhanced connections between the  auditory,  limbic  and  autonomic  systems, or enhanced reactivity  of the  limbic  and autonomic  system to  sound (see  Figure 4) (Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff,  2001;  Jastreboff &amp; J  astreboff,  2002).  Misophonia includes  a broad spectrum of emotions including, but not limited  to  fear.  When fear  is  a  dominant

factor,  patients are experiencing phonophobia, which is a specific sUbtype of misophonia.

In the  case  o(pure hyperacusis,  a patient experiences discomfort as a result of exposure to  a sound (quiet,  medium or loud). The same sound would not evoke  a similar reaction in an  average  listener.  The  strength  of the reaction is  controlled by  the  physical  charac› teristics  of the  sound  (e.g.,  its  spectrum  and intensity). The  reaction to  a  specific  sound will  be  the  same  disregarding  the  context in which it occurs.  In  cases  of misophonia  and phonophobia,  the  strength of the  patient's reaction is  only  partially  determined by  the physical characteristics of the upsetting sound. It is  also  dependent on the  patient's previous evaluation  and  recollection  of the  sound,  the patient's psychological profile and the context in which the sound is presented.

Abnormally  high  activation  of  the autonomic nervous system due to  either high amplification /  sensitivity  of the  auditory system subsequently passed to  autonomic nervous  system  (hyperacusis),  or by  over amplification occurring  at  connections between the  auditory  pathways  and  auto› nomic nervous  system  (misophonia)  results in behavioral reactions to  a sound.  Note, that connections  involved in  misophonia  are controlled by conditioned reflexes principles, the same as in the case of tinnitus.

In  addition  to  the  LDL  evaluation  a detailed interview  is  necessary  to  determine the  presence  and  extent  of hyperacusis  and misophonia.  LDLs provide  an  assessment of total  decreased  sound  tolerance  (e.g.,  the sum  of  hyperacusis  and  misophonia). Decreased values of LDL are necessary,  but not  sufficient  condition  to  prove  the presence of hyperacusis.

Note,  that  misophonic  reactions  are strongly  dependent on verbal instructions given to  patients,  their  general  feeling  at particular day,  and  the  level  of trust  to audiologist performing the  test  (the  fear  of being exposed to highly uncomfortable level of sound).  As  the  extent of misophonia affects  the  LDL,  these  factors  strongly increase  variability  of the  LDL.  Moreover,

for  proper treatment of patients  with  tinnitus and decreased sound tolerance it is important to  identify  and  characterise  the  hyperacusis component, as it has to be treated first.

There  are  several  variations  of clinical protocols for establishing LDLs with various stimuli  (e.g.,  continuous  or  pulsed,  beeps  of sound,  pure  tones  or  narrow  band noise) (Ricketts &amp; Bentler,  1996; Cox et aI.,  1997). The approach we  advocate incorporates modifications  of standard  procedures  aimed at  decreasing  the  effects  of misophonic  and phonophobic components  to  a minimum. To minimise  the  impact of these  components, and  to  assess  as  closely  as  possible  the presence  and  the  extent  of hyperacusis, testing is conducted in such a manner that the patients  are  aware  that  they  have  real  full control  over  the  maximal  sound level  to which  they  will  be  exposed.  Moreover, testing  is  performed  in  a  manner  allowing patients  to  become  familiar  with  the  proce› dure  and  consequently  decrease  the  anxiety and  concerns  patients  may  have  regarding LDL evaluation. Therefore,  we  introduced several  modifications  to  standard LDL procedure aimed at  decreasing the impact of the misophonic component on LDL values.

Every patient is  getting  a very  specific  set of instructions  regarding  testing  procedure, and  sound  level  when  response  is  expected. The  measurements  of LDL  are  performed using  short  pure  tones,  with  the  initial  level below threshold  of hearing  and  increased  in 5  dB  (or  1 dB  typically)  increments. Testing  is  performed  at  the  previously mentioned frequencies,  and  all  frequencies are tested twice (i.e.,  after performing testing for  all  frequencies  the  testing  is  repeated). Only the  second set is recorded on an  audio› gram.  It  is  common  for  misophonic  patients to  have  the  first  set  of measurements  10-15 dB  lower  than  the  second  set.  While  this protocol  does  not  assure  total  removal  of the  misophonic  component,  it decreases  its impact  on  final  LDL.  As  a' result  the measurements  are  more  stable,  and  there  is high test-retest repeatability.

In  the  presented  group  of patients,  65.8% reported some problem with sound tolerance (average LDL = 81.7  dB  HL),  and  66.4% were  diagnosed  with  decreased  sound toler› ance  (LDL  = 82.2 dB  HL).  However,  only 32.9%  of all  patients  were  diagnosed  with hyperacusis  requiring  specific  treatment (average  LDL  =  73.5  dB  HL).  While  57.0% were diagnosed with misophonia (LDL  = 81.9  dB  HL),  only 28.9% had pure misopho› nia without hyperacusis (LDL =  92.8 dB  HL). Finally, 2.7% had only decreased sound toler› ance  and  no  tinnitus  (LDL  =  85.0  dB  HL) (see Table 1).

Patients  with  significant hyperacusis typically  develop  misophonia  as  well.  Since LDLs  represent an  estimation  of a  sum  of hyperacusis and misophonia, as  expected the average LDLs  for  patients  with hyperacusis, some of whom have misophonia as well, was the lowest. Note, that all LDLs values tend to be  around  80  dB  HL,  for  patients  exhibiting some problems  with  decreased  sound  toler› ance,  suggesting  80-85 dB  HL  as  an  indica› tor of the need for sound tolerance treatment.

It is  important to  recognise,  that  neither hyperacusis,  misophonia nor  phonophobia have  any  relation  to  hearing  thresholds,  and

can  appear in  patients  with  normal  hearing, and various  types  of hearing  loss.  These phenomena are  not related to  recruitment. Recruitment results from the elevated thresh› old of hearing,  and  is  governed  by  purely peripheral mechanisms resulting from loss of outer hair cells  (OHC) in the cochlea.  On the other hand the  mechanisms  of hyperacusis can  be  peripheral,  central,  or  mixed,  and misophonia always involves  only  central mechanisms.  Potential peripheral mecha› nisms of hyperacusis might involve dysfunc› tion  of the  mechanisms  controlling  decrease of the  OHC produced amplification with the increase of a sound level or abnormally high ainplification  provide  by  OHC.  Indeed,  in some patients  there  is  an  indication  of inappropriate functioning of OHC system, as evaluated  by  distortion  product otoacoustic emission.  Central  mechanisms  of hyperacu› sis might involve the increase of the sensitiv› ity  of  neurons  in  the  central  auditory pathways  after decreased  auditory  input (dorsal  cochlear nuclei,  inferior  colliculi) (Gerken,  1979;  Sasaki,  Kauer, &amp; Babitz, 1980;  Gerken,  Saunders, &amp; Paul,  1984; Gerken,  Simhadri-Sumithra, &amp; Bhat,  1986; Salvi, Wang, &amp; Powers, 1996).

Potential mechanisms of misophonia might involve  an  abnormally  strong  functional connection between the  limbic  system  and the  auditory  system,  or  abnormally  high tonic  activation  of the  limbic  system.  Most frequently,  significantly  decreased sound tolerance  results  from  a  combination  of hyperacusis and misophonia.

Our data confirm a  lack of relationship between decreased  sound tolerance  and hearing. There is rather common opinion that hyperacusis  is  presented  only,  or  predomi› nantly  in  people  with  normal  hearing. Contrary to  this  belief,  our results  show  that 55.5%  of patients requiring  treatment for hyperacusis had hearing loss as well.

At the  same  time,  in  the  population  of patients  with hearing  loss  (91  subjects) 62.6%  reported decreased  sound  tolerance, 57.0% were diagnosed with misophonia, and 29.7%  with  hyperacusis.  72.5%  had high frequency hearing loss, 5.5% conductive and 22.0% other type.

At this  moment, it appears to  be a consen› sus  that  decreased  sound  tolerance  affects  a significant proportion of tinnitus patients and of the  general  population.  In  this  study 65.8%  of tinnitus  patients  exhibited some degree  of decreased  sound tolerance,  with 32.9% requiring specific treatment for hyper› acusis.  Therefore,  assuming  that  approxi› mately  30%  of tinnitus  patients  require treatment for  hyperacusis,  considering  that 86% of hyperacusis patients reported tinnitus (Anari et aI.,  1999), and accepting that about 4%  of general population have  clinically significant tinnitus,  it  is  possible  to  extrapo› late  that  significant hyperacusis  probably exists  in  at  least  1.4%  of the  general popula› tion,  and decreased sound tolerance affects  a proportion twice as large.

Data  from  an  epidemiological  study performed in  Poland on  10,349  subjects strongly  suggest that  this  assessment might be highly  conservative,  as  15.2% of subjects reported decreased sound tolerance (Fabijan› ska,  Rogowski,  Bartnik, &amp; Skarzynski, 1999).  Notably,  tinnitus  data  from  the  same population  are  in  agreement  with  findings from  other  studies  (i.e.,  20.1 %  of subjects experienced tinnitus  lasting  more  than  5 minutes,  5.4%  reported  clinically-significant tinnitus for which they seek professional help and 40% of tinnitus patients reported hypera› cusis as well).

In  the  majority  of cases  the  etiology  of hyperacusis is unknown. Hyperacusis has been linked to  sound  exposure  (particularly  short, impulse noise),  head injury,  stress,  medica› tions,  and  a  number  of medical  conditions such  as  tinnitus,  Bell's palsy,  Lyme  Disease, Williams Syndrome, Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, failed  stapedectomy,  perilymphatic fistula, head injury,  migraine,  depression,  withdrawal from  benzodiazepines,  increased Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF)  pressure and  Addison's disease  (Katznell &amp; Segal,  2001;  J  astreboff &amp; Jastreboff,  2002).  Audiological  data indicate that hyperacusis can have both peripheral and

central components  (Jastreboff,  Jastreboff, &amp; Sheldrake, 1999).

TRT offers  an opportunity  to  treat not only tinnitus  but  also  decreased  sound  tolerance. Initially,  the  treatment  of decreased  sound tolerance was focused on treating hYperacusis. The approach involves the  desensitisation of patients  through exposure to  a  variety  of sounds  (provided by  sound generators,  table top sound machines, nature sounds, radio, TV, etc.). Sound therapy for treatment of hyperacu› sis  has  several  differences,  as  compared with sound therapy used for  tinnitus.  Avoidance of silence and continued exposure to background sound is  even more important than for tinnitus patients.  The  sound  level  from  sound  genera› tors  needs  to  be  closer monitored  (which results  in  standard for  recommendation using sound generators),  and  may  require  modifica› tion during the treatment.

The  desensitisation  approach  has  been promoted for  some time  with  a  variety  of protocols  and  types  of sounds  utilised;  such as  the  recommendation  of using  sound  with certain frequencies  removed, short exposures to  moderately  loud  sound,  or  prolonged exposures  to  low  level  sounds  (Vernon &amp; Press,  1998). According  to  principles  of the neurophysiological model of tinnitus,  desen› sitisation is recommended and it is  used as  a part of TRT (Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff,  2000). Both  theory  and  our results  of treatment  of hyperacusis  were  presented already  (Jastre› boff et  aI. ,  1996a;  Jastreboff et aI.,  1996b; Jastreboff et aI.,  1998; Jastreboff 1998).

However,  the  misophonic  component cannot be  removed by  desensitisation  and  a separate  approach  needs  to  be implemented. Recognising the similarity of neural networks involved in tinnitus  and  misophonia  and the involvement of conditioned reflexes  we promote a method based on active extinction of conditioned reflexes  (Konorski,  1948; Konorski,  1967),  which involves  systematic exposure of patients  to  sounds  associated with  a  pleasant  situation,  with  gradually increasing sound levels.  A  handout with protocol for misophonia,  as  given to patients, is shown in the Appendix.

Both,  desensitisation  and  active  extinction process produce effects  relatively  fast  and, typically,  patients  with  decreased  sound tolerance show fast recovery,  with a number of them reaching  the maximal  levels  of sound  allowed for  testing  LDLs  without experiencing  discomfort.  Effectively,  it is possible  to  achieve  not  only  improvement, but a cure for decreased sound tolerance in a significant proportion of patients.  If only hyperacusis  is  treated  without recognising and treating  misophonia results  are  unpre› dictable and recovery might take a long time, or even treatment might be unsuccessful.

As most frequently  significantly decreased sound tolerance results  from  a  combination of hyperacusis and misophoniaJphonophobia, it . s  important to  assess the  presence and the i extent of both hyperacusis and rnisophonia in each  patient  (Jastreboff,  Jastreboff, &amp; Sheldrake,  1999;  Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff, 2000), as they need to be treated using differ› ent  methods  (J  astreboff &amp; J  as  treb  off,  2001; Jastreboff &amp; Jastreboff,  2002).  After  a detailed interview and audiological testing,  a medical evaluation is  advisable  to  rule  out medical conditions,  which  might be related to tinnitus or decreased sound tolerance.

In  conclusion,  several  issues  are  worth pointing out.  The  same systems  in  the  brain are involved in tinnitus  and decreased sound tolerance,  and  the  neurophysiological  model of tinnitus  provides  theoretical  guidance  for treatment of both conditions.  Basically,  the main  difference  between  tinnitus  and misophonia is  that in  the  case  of tinnitus there  is  no  external  sound,  and  the  tinnitus signal  is  stable.  However,  for  both phenom› ena,  the  same  neuronal  pathways  are activated, with the final product being activa› tion of the sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system, which in tum is  responsible for behaviourally observed problems.

Analysis of the neural mechanisms respon› sible  for  hyperacusis  and  misophonia suggests  specific  clinical  approaches  aimed at  removing  these  problems.  In  the  case of pure  hyperacusis,  where  the  problem is constrained to  the  auditory  pathways  and

conditional  reflexes  are  not  involved,  effec› tive  treatment  can be  based  on  desensitisa› tion implemented by exposing the subject to relatively  low  levels  of neutral  sounds.  This approach  would not  work for  misophonia where  conditioned reflexes  linking  the auditory  with  the  limbic  and  autonomic nervous  systems  play  a cr~cial role.  In  the case of misophonia the reflexes are the same, with  substitution  of an  internally  generated signal  (tinnitus)  by  a  variety  of external sounds (misophonia).

For both  tinnitus  and  hyperacusis,  part  of the  problem arises  from  the  presence  of unusual activity within the auditory pathways:  for  tinnitus  an  abnormal, typically  weak neuronal  activity;  for  pure hyperacusis -abnormally enhanced neuronal activity induced by external sounds. For  both  tinnitus  and  hyperacusis,  the problem arises  from  overactivation  of the autonomic  nervous  system by  these  signals. In the case of misophonia, the activity within the  auditory  system is  normal,  but it causes abnormal  activation  of  the  limbic  and autonomic nervous systems.

TRT is  aimed at habituation of activation of autonomic  nervous  system evoked by  the signal present in  the  auditory  pathways,  and  a part of protocol  (sound  therapy)  aims  at decreasing  the  strength of this  signal.  In  the case  of tinnitus,  the  strength  of the  tinnitus› related  neuronal  activity  is  directly  decreased by  increasing  background neuronal  activity. This is accomplished by exposing the patient to additional  external  sounds.  Sounds  used  to provide  this  additional  auditory  background should  not induce  annoyance  or aIlY  other negative  reactions.  These  sounds  decrease  the overall gain  of the  auditory  system as  well. In the  case  of hyperacusis,  a partial  decrease  of the  signal  strength  is  achieved  immediately, due  to  the  same  principle  of difference  with background.  For example,  measurements  of LDLs, while the patient is provided with sound from  sound  generators,-result in  higher values of LDLs. It is common for hyperacusis patients to  note  immediate protective properties  of sound from  sound generators. We recommend increasing the sound level  of sound generators when patients expect to be in a louder environ› ment.  As  amplification  of the  sound-induced neuronal  activity  in  the  case  of significant hyperacusis  appears  to  be  relatively  large,  the main effect of desensitisation  is  a  gradual decrease  of this  gain,  typically  achieved  in  a span of several weeks or months.

Nevertheless, for both tinnitus and hypera› cusis  the  aim  of TR  T  is  to  decrease  the strength of neuronal  activity  within  auditory pathways  and  to  eliminate  activation  of the autonomic nervous system. The similarity of TRT  treatment  between  tinnitus and misophonia is  even closer.  In both cases,  the signal  coming  from  the  auditory  system  to the limbic and autonomic nervous systems is weak (in  case  of tinnitus),  or normal  (for misophonia).  However,  abnormal  amplifica› tion of these signals, occurring at the connec› tions  between the  auditory,  the  limbic  and autonomic  nervous  systems,  is  responsible for the problem. TRT is aimed at elimination of these  functional  connections,  that  is,  an extinction  of conditioned reflexes  linking these  systems (habituation of reactions). The main  difference  between  tinnitus  and misophonia is  that we can manipulate exter› nal  sounds  (but not tinnitus). Therefore,  it  is possible  to  implement  a  more powerful method of active  extinction  of these  condi› tioned  reflexes  by  associating  sounds  with positive  reward.  This  is  impossible  in  the case of tinnitus  where the more cumbersome method of possible extinction is  utilised. Nevertheless,  the  basics  of the  methods  are identical for tinnitus and misophonia.

An  interesting  aspect  of decreased  sound tolerance  is  that  affected  subjects  typically have a tendency to notice, and to be aware of somatosounds  (e.g.,  swallowing, chewing, jaw movements), as  well  as  external sounds, with  patients  concentrating  on  all  sounds. This  is  tum,  causes  patients  to  avoid  sound, enhances  tendency  to  remain  in  silence,  and overprotect their ears.  All  these  factors, result in further enhancement of misophonia, hyperacusis,  and  tinnitus.  TRT results  in habituation  of perception of these  sounds

(similarly  to  habituation  of tinnitus  percep› tion),  removes  factors  worsening  these problems,  and thus  provides  an extra benefit .  to  these patients.

Finally,  as  increased  gain  within  the auditory  pathways  will  enhance  an  already existing  low  level  of the  tinnitus-related neuronal  activity  and  consequently  may cause crossing  the  threshold of its  detection, it  is  possible  to  expect that  subjects  with hyperacusis  may  have  the  tendency  to develop  tinnitus  as  well.  On  the  other  hand decrease  of this  gain  should  result  in  a decrease  of the  tinnitus  signal.  As  such,  for some patients  tinnitus  and  hyperacusis  may be considered the double manifestation of the same internal phenomenon "two sides  of the same coin".

## TREATMENT OF MISOPHONIA

Misophonia  (dislike  of sound)  is  treated  by  training  involving  engagement in activities which you enjoy, and which have sound as  an inevitable component.

The main  concept  is  to  create  association  of sound  with  a  pleasant  situation. This  can  be  achieved by  engaging in  activities  which  you  like,  and  which  have sound  as  an  indispensable  part,  such  as  listening  to  music,  shopping  in  a  mall, going to  parties,  restaurants  and so  forth. You  should  always  have  a full  control over the situation and to be able to discontinue sound exposure at any time, if you would like to (for example, listening to music at home but not going to a concert).

The  most  common method  is  to  listen  to  music  at home.  In  this  case,  you should select your most favourite type of music and listen to  it attentively once I twice  every  single  day  for  20-40  minutes. The  music  should  have  reasonably stable level without going from very quiet to very loud.

The treatment consists  of 3-week cycles,  repeated  as  many  times  as  it  is needed.

- For the  first  week,  the  sound  volume  should  be  set every  day  for  the  most comfortable level.
- For the second week, the level should be increased by one just noticeable step louder than the most comfortable level for a given day.
- For the third week, sound volume should be increased by another step, that is, sound is initially  set at most comfortable level and then increased by  two just noticeable steps louder.

Then this 3-week cycle is repeated.
