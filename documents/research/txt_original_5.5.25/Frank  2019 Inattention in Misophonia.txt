ABSTRACT
Introduction : Misophonia is marked by abnormal negative reactions to speci ﬁc and idiosyncratic
sounds. Despite unclear etiology and diagnostic conceptualization, neuropsychology may be able
to help characterize the syndrome. In the current study, we administered the Attention Network
Test (ANT) under symptom provocation conditions, as well as secondary measures of concept
formation, perseveration, processing speed, and frustration tolerance. We assessed treatment
seeking individuals with misophonia and non-clinical controls. We hypothesized higher alerting,
orienting, and con ﬂict eﬀects on the ANT suggesting overall poorer performance for the mis-
ophonia group.
Methods : The sample consisted of symptomatic individuals recruited from a randomized treat-
ment trial prior to the mandatory waitlist ( n= 11) and age, gender matched controls ( n= 11).
Symptomatic individuals were screened with the Misophonia Questionnaire, as well as a number
of additional self-report and diagnostic measures.
Results : Robust Bayesian estimation in multi-level models suggested worse alerting attention for
symptomatic individuals, βMedian = 2.766, βSD= 1.253, 95% CI[0.322, 5.2876], Bayes factor = 31.41.
There were no e ﬀects respective to block (i.e., blocks before versus during and after symptom
provocation) or interaction e ﬀects. There were also no e ﬀects particular to executive functioning
measures but some evidence this domain should be further explored (e.g., ANT con ﬂict eﬀects,
perseveration, and serial math accuracy).
Conclusions : We propose that symptom provocation alone does not explain the observed group
diﬀerence in alerting attention, which could re ﬂect a long-standing neuropsychological weak-
ness. Future studies should attempt to characterize misophonia with more comprehensive
neuropsychological batteries and larger samples.ARTICLE HISTORY

Bayesian analysis
Misophonia, or selective sound aversion syndrome, is
marked by abnormal negative reactions to speci ﬁc and
idiosyncratic sounds (e.g., eating/chewing, lip smack-
ing, pen clicking, and clock ticking; Jastrebo ﬀ&
Jastrebo ﬀ,2015 ). Misophonia was ﬁrst discussed in
the audiological literature (Jastrebo ﬀ& Jastrebo ﬀ,
2001 ), although it di ﬀers from well-established disor-
ders of decreased sound tolerance such as hyperacusis
(i.e., generalized sound sensitivity; Aazh et al., 2014 ).
Individuals with misophonia report negative reactions
to a wide variety of sounds (Edelstein, Brang,
Ramachandran, & Rouw, 2013 ; Schröder, Vulink, &
Denys, 2013 ; Wu, Lewin, Murphy, & Storch, 2014 ),
with no consistent pattern of cochlear abnormality or
hearing threshold (Jastrebo ﬀ& Jastrebo ﬀ,2015 ).
Reactions vary, but typically include neurophysiologi-
cal (e.g., tachycardia, angina, labored breath, tension
headache, hyperthermia, diaphoresis) and a ﬀective-
behavioral sequelae (e.g., fear, irritation, anger, disgust;
Schröder et al., 2013 ; Schwartz, Leyendecker, &
Conlon, 2011 ; Webber & Storch, 2015 ). At the timeof writing, no study has systematically examined neu-
rocognitive processes in misophonia. However, nine of
eleven participants in Edelstein et al. ( 2013 )’s sample
complained that misophonia symptoms substantially
impeded attention, and reported a bene ﬁt when atten-
tion was redirected from trigger stimuli. Therefore,
neuropsychology may be able to contribute toward
characterizing the syndrome.
Misophonia is not part of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disord ers (5th ed.;
DSM –5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013 ).
Proposals have been made to classify it as a new dis-
order (see Dozier, Lopez, & Pearson, 2017 ; Schröder
et al., 2013 ). However, it remains unclear whether
taxometrically sound criteria can be established (e.g.,
whether symptoms pertain to psychology, neurology,
audiology, or a combination of the three disciplines;
Taylor, 2017 ). Misophonia shares commonalities with
sensory intolerance, and perceptual anomalies such as
synesthesia (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Taylor, 2017 ).
Studies assessing psychiatric overlap have been mixed,

with some samples evincing corollaries to know diag-
noses (e.g., obsessive compulsive and related disorders
[OCRD] and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD];
Cusack, Cash, & Vrana, 2018 ; McKay, Kim, Mancusi,
Storch, & Spankovich, 2018 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ),
but no consistent pattern of co-morbidity (Frank &
McKay, 2018 ; Schröder et al., 2013 ). Individuals with
misophonia attempt to avoid situations that provoke
symptoms, or inhibit symptoms when they occur, and
show poor stress management (Edelstein et al., 2013 ;
Frank & McKay, 2018 ). Several case reports and con-
trolled trials have suggested preliminary support for
psychosocial interventions (see Palumbo, Alsalman,
De Ridder, Song, & Vanneste, 2018 for a review). To
date, however, no treatment has been well validated
with misophonia samples.
Not surprisingly given the nascent state of misopho-
nia research, biological markers have proved elusive.
Jastrebo ﬀand Hazell ( 2004 ) posited that enhanced
auditory-limbic connectivity may be implicated.
Kumar et al. ( 2017 ) found exaggerated blood-oxygen-
level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the anterior
insular cortex, elevated heart rate, and galvanic skin
response (GSR) in participants with misophonia
(n= 20) compared to age- and gender-matched con-
trols. These di ﬀerences were observed during partici-
pant responses to trigger sounds but not unpleasant or
neutral sounds, and were associated with altered func-
tional connectivity (during misophonia sounds only),
greater myelination within the ventromedial prefrontal
cortex (vmPFC), and greater self-reported awareness of
bodily sensations. Similarly, Edelstein et al. ( 2013 )
reported elevated GSR during exposure to misophonia
stimuli for participants with misophonia ( n= 6) when
compared to controls. Schröder et al. ( 2014 ) investi-
gated event-related potentials (ERPs) and found
a diminished N1 component (i.e., early attention to
sensory changes) in participants with misophonia
(N= 20). These ﬁndings provide initial support for
neuro-biological correlates in persons who report the
condition when exposed to trigger stimuli.
Neuropsychological functioning in misophonia
At the time of writing, only two studies have assessed
neuropsychological functioning in individuals with
misophonia. Eijsker, Schröder, van Wingen, and
Denys ( 2018 ) administered a stop-signal task to 22
participants with misophonia and 19 controls. The
misophonia group evinced intact response inhibition,
but favored accuracy over speed, with concomitant
BOLD hyper-activation of the superior medial frontal
gyrus (SMFG) during inhibition failure and BOLDhypo-activation of the posterior cingulate cortex during
success. Silva and Sanchez ( 2018 ) administered an
adapted version of the Dichotic Sentence
Identi ﬁcation Test (DSI; Andrade, Gil, & Iório, 2010 )
to participants with misophonia ( n= 10), tinnitus
(n= 10), and healthy controls ( n= 20). Participants
with misophonia showed signi ﬁcantly worse selective
attention than other groups, but only when the DSI
was administered with distractor stimuli (i.e., chewing
sounds) rather than white noise. While few conclusions
can be drawn due to the small number of studies,
attentional processes in misophonia appear to warrant
further investigation.
Posner and Petersen ( 1990 ) proposed attention as
the composite of three interactive networks. Alerting
attention, implicating right frontal and parietal regions,
involves achieving and maintining sensitivity to incom-
ing stimuli. Orienting attention, involving the superior
parietal lobe, temporal parietal junction, and frontal
eyeﬁelds, aligns attention to the source of sensory
signals. Executive attention involves con ﬂict monitor-
ing and management, and implicates the midline fron-
tal areas and lateral prefrontal cortex. The Attention
Network Test (ANT), a computer-based application of
the Eriksen ﬂanker task, was designed to independently
assess these three networks using alerting, spatial, and
ﬂanker cues (Fan, McCandliss, Sommer, Raz, & Posner,
2002 ). Consistent structural and functional imaging
data have been found (Fan, McCandliss, Fossella,
Flombaum, & Posner, 2005 ; Westlye, Grydeland,
Walhovd, & Fjell, 2011 ), as well as data from studies
using ERPs (Neuhaus et al., 2010 ). However, uncer-
tainty remains regarding the independence of the
attentional networks (see Macleod et al., 2010 ) and
their relationship with executive functions (e.g., work-
ing memory capacity; Redick & Engle, 2006 ).
The current study
The present study assessed neuropsychological func-
tioning related to frontal systems in misophonia. This
included a brief and targeted assessment of attention
and executive functioning. Following Abramovitch and
Schweiger ( 2015 ), we assumed that neuropsychological
diﬀerences between symptomatic individuals and non-
clinical controls would be in the small to moderate
range. We also assumed that testing under conditions
of symptom provocation would be informative. This is
theﬁrst study to characterize misophonia using multi-
ple neuropsychological instruments. Given the under-
studied nature of the syndrome, this attempt may
provide an important basis for future e ﬀorts. This is
also the ﬁrst study to employ the ANT with a sampleJOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY 67

reporting misophonia, and the ﬁrst to modify the task
to assess symptom provocation e ﬀects (see Methods).
In order to further characterize frontal systems, we
administered secondary neuropsychological and beha-
vioral measures. We hypothesized that participants
with misophonia would demonstrate higher alerting,
orienting, and con ﬂict eﬀects on the ANT (of note,
higher scores suggest worse attentional functioning).
As an exploratory analysis, we assessed group e ﬀects
in concept formation, perseveration, and frustration
tolerance.
Method
Participants
We assessed participants with misophonia ( n=11) and
matched controls ( n= 11) in the current study. The
groups were matched for gender (males = 4,
females = 7), age, F(1, 20) = 0.000, p= 1.000, and
years of education, F(1, 20) = 0.026, p= .873. All
participants identi ﬁed as non-Hispanic White except
for one, who identi ﬁed as biracial. The misophonia
group was recruited from enrollees in a randomized
treatment trial prior to the mandated waitlist period
(see Frank & McKay, 2018 ). The treatment trial was
designed to assess the e ﬃcacy of cognitive-behavioral
interventions on misophonia symptoms. Participants
were recruited via the misophonia Facebook page,
postings on professional listservs, and through direct
email contact by the principal investigator. All partici-
pants in the misophonia group reported at least mod-
erate severity levels on the Misophonia Questionnaire
prior to enrollment (MQ Severity Rating ≥7; Wu et al.,
2014 ), and substantial functional distress related to the
condition. While no established clinical criteria exist
for a diagnosis of misophonia, the treatment seeking
individuals in our misophonia group show qualitatively
higher total MQ scores ( M= 43.45, SD= 7.31) than our
non-clinical control group ( M= 12.27, SD= 8.15) as
well as the community sample found in Wu et al.
(2014 ;M= 17.81, SD= 9.17). Participants in the treat-
ment trial were also screened for exclusion using the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5;
First, Williams, Karg, & Spitzer, 2015 ). Exclusion cri-
teria for the treatment trial included signi ﬁcant cogni-
tive impairment, autism spectrum disorder, psychosis,
personality disorder, and past history of aggressive
behavior, which were considered potential confounds
for treatment e ﬃcacy. The current study was approved
as an amendment to the treatment trial protocol. Of
those participants enrolled during the active recruit-
ment phase for the current study ( n= 13), only twowere unable to be matched with controls. One partici-
pant was determined to be ineligible based on exclu-
sion criteria during this time period (namely,
a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder).
Instruments and procedure
In order to prevent uncontrolled symptom provocation
from a human examiner, digitized and remote versions
of all tests were administered. Attentional networks
were assessed with the Attention Network Test (ANT;
Fan et al., 2002 ). Participants completed 24 trial runs
(with feedback) followed by 288 experimental trials.
For each trial, arrows appeared either above or below
aﬁxation cross with various ﬂanker conditions pertain-
ing to alerting, orienting, and con ﬂict eﬀects (respec-
tively, no-cue versus double-cue, center-cue versus
spatial-cue, and incongruent-cue versus congruent-
cue). Participants were prompted to correctly identify
the direction of each arrow. E ﬀects were derived by
subtracting mean response time between correct trials
of respective conditions (see Fan et al., 2002 ).
Symptom provocation
The ANT was modi ﬁedfollowing a similar procedure
to that found in Panagopoulos, Greene, Campbell, and
Black ( 2013 ). Auditory stimuli were played during
a randomized block (respectively, trials 1 –96, 97 –192,
or 193 –288), allowing a comparative index of perfor-
mance (i.e., response di ﬀerences for blocks before, dur-
ing, and after auditory stimuli were played). Auditory
stimuli consisted of recordings of sounds rated most
aversive to a misophonia sample played in random
order for 15s intervals (per Edelstein et al., 2013 ).
Additional measures
Perseveration, set shifting, and concept formation were
assessed with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST;
Berg, 1948 ). Participants were asked to sort response
cards according to an unknown matching principle,
and adjust their approach during administration.
A computerized version of the task was employed
using 64 digital cards and responses were scored
according to norms provided by Axelrod, Jiron, and
Henry ( 1993 ).
Frustration tolerance was assessed with the Paced
Auditory Serial Addition Task –Computerized
(PASAT-C; Lejuez, Kahler, & Brown, 2003 ). In this
task, participants were asked to complete serial math
from sequentially displayed numbers. It was predicted
that the stress management portion of the task wouldB. FRANK ET AL. 68

be meaningful for our sample, and that the overall task
would provide a secondary index of accuracy and pro-
cessing speed.
Several self-report instruments were administered.
Misophonia symptoms and behavioral reactions were
assessed with the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu
et al., 2014 ). Depression, anxiety, and stress were
assessed with the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21
(DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995 ). Anxiety sen-
sitivity (i.e., the fear of sensations and behaviors asso-
ciated with anxiety) was assessed with the Anxiety
Sensitivity Inventory-3 (ASI-3; Taylor et al., 2007 ).
Distress tolerance was assessed with the Distress
Tolerance Scale (DTS; Simons & Gaher, 2005 ). Health
and neurological histories were recorded using the
Body Perception Questionnaire: Health History
Inventory (Porges, 1993 ).
Participants provided written informed consent
prior to enrollment in the study. The study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Fordham University and conducted according to the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All partici-
pants were tested individually and given breaks
between tasks. Participants completed self-report mea-
sures using the Survey Monkey Inc. platform ( www.
surveymonkey.com ). Neuropsychological tests and
instructions were administered digitally using Inquisit
5(https://www.millisecond.com/ ). Participants were
virtually monitored during testing with VSee ( https://
vsee.com/ ), a HIPAA-compliant video-chat interface.
The entire research protocol lasted 120 minutes.
Statistical analyses
Analyses were conducted in the statistical program-
ming language R (version 3.5.1; R Development Core
Team, 2016 ). Linear models were ﬁrst computed for
demographic and self-report variables to assess e ﬀectsbetween the misophonia and control group. In order to
account for multiple comparisons in these analyses,
a Bonferroni correction was employed ( α= 0.01).
Bootstrapped con ﬁdence intervals were computed
using the carlibrary with 10,000 samples (version
3.0–0; Fox & Weisberg, 2011 ).
For analyses pertaining to ANT data, an iterative
process was employed (see Fox & Weisberg, 2011 ).
A linear contrast model was computed using between
subject (i.e., misophonia or control group) and within-
subject factors (i.e., before versus during and after
symptom provocation) for alerting, orienting, and con-
ﬂict eﬀects. Diagnostic plots were reviewed (e.g., resi-
duals, Q-Q plots, etc.) and, when indicated, dependent
variables were transformed using the powerTransform
function in the carlibrary. This function employs
a maximum-likelihood-like approach to select an opti-
mal univariate or multivariate transformation for line-
arity, normality, and constant variance (Box & Cox,
1964 ). For values with negative responses,
a modi ﬁcation of the procedure was computed as
designed by Hawkins and Weisberg ( 2017 ). Eﬀect
sizes were interpreted according to Cohen ( 1988 ) and
Fritz, Morris, and Richler ( 2012 ).
Initial regression models for the ANT indicated pos-
sible violations of residual normality; therefore, transfor-
mations were employed (respectively, λAlerting =0 . 5 5 9 ,
γAlerting = 44.409; λOrienting =0 . 2 4 4 , γOrienting = 25.494;
λConﬂict=0 . 0 8 5 , γConﬂict= 46.129). While these transfor-
mations were optimized from the given models, they also
appeared to improve distortions at the univariate level
(see Figure 1 ). However, all analyses were conducted
employing transformed and non-transformed values
and there were no di ﬀerences in outcome.
In order to produce maximally reliable information
from a small sample size, ﬁnal models were assessed with
robust Bayesian estimation, computed in the rstanarm
library (version 2.13.1; Stan Development Team, 2016).

This algorithm produces Bayesian estimation of ﬁxed
eﬀects using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simu-
lation with 10,000 iterations (Gelman & Hill, 2014). For
all Bayesian models, default (weakly informative) priors
were employed. Unlike null hypothesis testing, Bayesian
models assess positive evidence for credible e ﬀects from
the computed posterior distribution. Bayesian credible
intervals provide an estimation of population parameters
(versus an estimation of repeated sampling from
a statistical distribution). Bayesian intervals are termed
credible because they are an estimation of population
values, a probability distribution of the “true value ”for
any given statistical question. This approach is less
dependent on the sample, and any error contained
therein, and more dependent on the “true value ”having
some predictable form (e.g., a speci ﬁed prior). In the
current study, it was assumed that the di ﬀerence between
groups was more likely null than negative or positive
inﬁnity. Since MCMC generation of the posterior distri-
bution involves a unique and iterative process from the
data (rather than repeated comparisons), and due to the
robustness of these methods to Type I errors, no correc-
tion for repeated comparisons is necessary (Gelman, Hill,
&Y a j i m a , 2012; Jaynes, 2003; Wagenmakers et al., 2018).
For e ﬀects retained as credible, secondary Bayesian
models were run estimating both ﬁxed and random e ﬀects
to assess any di ﬀerences in outcome with this added para-
meter (i.e., group e ﬀects nested in the within-subject fac-
tor). Bayes factors were computed for retained e ﬀects with
thebridgesampling library (Gronau et al., 2017)a n di n t e r -
preted according to Je ﬀreys ( 1998). Model ﬁtw a sc o m -
pared using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO), the
widely applicable information criterion (WAIC), and
Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS; see
Vehtari, Gelman, & Gabry, 2017).
For additional neuropsychological measures, a similar
procedure was employed. However, quit time on the
PASAT-C was not assessed since exactly eight individuals
(73%) from the misophonia and control groups completed
the measure (i.e., a majority of both groups). We assessed
a linear model comparing the total number of correct
responses between the groups. For the WCST, we assessed
linear models comparing standard scores for completed
categories, total errors, and perseverative responses. Other
data from the participants were reviewed qualitatively.
Results
As expected, the misophonia group reported higher levels
of sound aversion and concomitant behavioral reactions
than matched controls (see Table 1 ). There was
as i g n i ﬁcant e ﬀect of group on the total score for this
measure, F(1,20) = 89.21, p< .001, η2= 0.82, 95% CI[24.30, 38.07]. In addition, these participants reported sig-
niﬁcantly higher anxiety sensitivity, F(1, 20) = 9.57,
p= .005, η2=0 . 3 2 4 ,9 5 % CI[5.01, 25.72] and stress, F(1,
20) = 13.75, p= .001, η2= 0.420, 95% CI[6.14, 22.04], and
lower distress tolerance than the control group, F(1,
20) = 29.75, p< .001, η2= 0.598, 95% CI[−34.19, −15.27].
Diﬀerences were observed in anxiety, F(1, 20) = 5.95,
p= .024, η2= 0.229, 95% CI[1.13, 14.51] and depression,
F(1, 20) = 6.88, p= .016, η2= 0.266, 95% CI[2.06, 18.31],
which were not signi ﬁcant after Bonferroni correc-
tion ( α= 0.01).
In addition, health and neurological histories sug-
gested higher endorsement of some psychiatric and
somatic complaints. A greater number of individuals in
the misophonia group reported migraine headaches in
comparison to the control group (18% versus 9%, respec-
tively), as well as gastric/digestive problems (55% versus
18%), arthritis (27% versus 0%), hopeless unhappiness
(9% versus 0%), depressive symptoms (36% versus 9%),
back problems (27% versus 18%), gastric/duodenal ulcers
(18% versus 0%), psychiatric disorders (18% versus 0%),
and motion sickness (36% versus 9%). However, lower
incidence of hypertension (0% versus 18%), anorexia
(0% versus 9%), obesity (9% versus 27%), endocrine
problems (0% versus 9%), diabetes (0% versus 9%), can-
cer (0% versus 9%), and pneumonia (0% versus 18%)
were reported by the misophonia group.
In the initial models, the misophonia group evinced
signiﬁcantly worse alerting attention than the control
group as suggested by a higher alerting e ﬀect,β= 2.790, t

when partialling out variance from within-subject e ﬀects
(see Figure 1 ). The overall model was signi ﬁcant, F
(62) = 2.9109, p= .041, R2= 0.134. This e ﬀect was con-
sistent with robust Bayesian estimation in the ﬁnal model,

suggested an e ﬀect when partialling out variance from
ﬁxed and random within-subject e ﬀects, βMedian = 2.7766,
βSD= 1.253, 95% CI[0.322, 5.2876], BF = 31.41. While
estimation was more precise in the nested model, model ﬁt
was relatively strong for both (WAIC = 405.6 and 406.0,
SE= 12.8 and 12.9). All PSIS estimates were acceptable,
suggesting little in ﬂuence from outliers (Pareto k’s<0 . 5 ) .
In the initial frequentist model for alerting e ﬀects, there
were no signi ﬁcant interaction e ﬀects and no signi ﬁcant
within-subject e ﬀects from blocks during or after stimuli
were played, β=1 . 4 4 5 , t(62) = 0.9658, p= .342, d= 0.17,
and, β= 2.3766, t(62) = 1.5655, p= .125, d= 0.06, respec-
tively. Likewise, there were no e ﬀects in the ﬁnal Bayesian
model, βMedian = 1.184, βSD=1 . 3 9 4 ,9 5 % CI[−1.5105,
4.0435] and, βMedian = 1.9876, βSD= 1.460, 95% CI
[−0.7766, 4.9329].
The initial model assessing orienting attention was not
signiﬁcant overall, F(3, 62) = 0.303, p= .823, R2=0 . 0 3 ,o r

signiﬁcant, β= 0.322, t(62) = 0.670, p= .506, d= 0.11, and,
β= 0.280, t(62) = −0.5878, p= .566, d= 0.08. This was
consistent with robust Bayesian estimation of between-
subject e ﬀects in the ﬁnal model, βMedian =−0.234, βSD=
0.444, 95% CI[−1.2879, 0.6437]. Likewise, within-subject
eﬀects were not retained for orienting attention, βMedian =

Qualitative information on the ANT can be viewed in
Table 2 . There was a notable diminution in accuracy for
the misophonia group across ANT stimuli. There was,
however, a possible ceiling e ﬀect on this metric as both
groups were highly accurate. Mean response time
appeared to follow expected patterns for both groups,
with more di ﬃcult ANT conditions provoking slower
responses.
As noted, quit time on the PASAT-C was not
assessed given that only three individuals (27%)
from each group quit the task. There were, however,no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences in the total number of
correct items for either raw, β=−8.6545, t(20) =

Discussion
This was the ﬁrst study to attempt to characterize neurop-
sychological functioning related to frontal systems in mis-
ophonia using multiple neuropsychological instruments.
Misophonia remains an under-studied condition, with
unclear etiology and rudimentary diagnostic conceptuali-
zation (Brout et al., 2018; Cavanna & Seri, 2015;P a l u m b o
et al., 2018;T a y l o r , 2017). Given the cross-sectional nature
of this study, we cannot conclude whether observed di ﬀer-
ences between particip ants with misophonia ( n=1 1 )a n dTable 2. Proportion of correct responses and mean response

matched controls ( n= 11) re ﬂect a long-standing neurop-
sychological weakness. However, our symptom provoca-
tion paradigm suggests this possibility. Our data indicate
that the misophonia group had di ﬃculties achieving and
maintaining alertness during the attention task. The ﬁnd-
ings were consistent between frequentist models and
nested models using robust Bayesian estimation. Bayes
factors suggested the evidence for the e ﬀects was substantial
(greater than 5) to strong (greater than 10). It is notable that
eﬀects respective to block, as well as interaction e ﬀects,
were not retained in the overall model (i.e., blocks before
versus during and after symptom provocation). This sug-
gests that performance di ﬀerences were not exclusively
ar e s u l to fs y m p t o mp r o v o c a t i o n( i . e . ,a ni m p a c to np e r -
formance after stimuli were played). We propose that the
observed group di ﬀerence in alerting attention could be
characteristic of individuals with misophonia. However, it
would be warranted to administer a “cold ”version of the
ANT to similar participants in order to further support this
ﬁnding.
Given the current results, we speculate that atten-
tional disturbance in misophonia samples will be in the
small to moderate range, even under symptom provo-
cation conditions. Both groups showed an error rate
similar to that found in previous studies using the ANT
(e.g., Fan et al., 2002 ). However, there was somewhat
worse accuracy for the misophonia group compared to
matched controls across stimuli and conditions of the
ANT. This feature contrasts somewhat with Eijsker
et al. ( 2018 ). Of note, however, the stop-signal task
employed in this study re ﬂects successful engagement
of a di ﬀerent cognitive capacity. Therefore, accuracy on
various neuropsychological instruments may be an area
that warrants further exploration.
Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not ﬁnd diﬀerences
in orienting attention, which aligns attention to the source
of sensory signals. Enhanced resting auditory-limbic con-
nectivity in persons with misophonia (as suggested by
Jastrebo ﬀ& Hazell, 2004;P a l u m b oe ta l . , 2018) may entrain
a strengthened orienting reaction to appraise stimuli for
threat potential. However, further studies will be needed to
conﬁrm this result, and explore biological corollaries as
well as clinical implicatio ns. In addition, we found no
eﬀects particular to executive functioning measures (e.g.,
ANT con ﬂict eﬀects, WCST perseveration, and PASAT
accuracy). As such, our sample did not evince meaningful
executive dysfunction. These data correspond with Eijsker
et al. ( 2018)’sﬁnding of intact response inhibition.
However, given the medium e ﬀe c ts i z ew ed o c u m e n t e d
on the WCST (i.e., perseverative responses), future studies
should explore similar metrics.
While individuals with misophonia may have higher
rates of diagnosable conditions, they have not shownaconsistent psychodiagnostic pattern for comorbid or
co-occurring disorders (Frank & McKay, 2018 ; Kumar
et al., 2017 ; Schröder et al., 2013 ). In the current study,
participants in the misophonia group endorsed higher
levels of some psychiatric and somatic complaints than
the control group, but no general pattern of poor
health. We did not statistically control for substance
use, anxiety, or depression in the current study.
However, qualitatively, our participants reported anxi-
ety and depression symptoms as a result of misophonia
triggers, as well as their inability to exert control over
their reactions. Similarly, participants reported that
substance use was a coping mechanism for their symp-
tomology. For this reason, partialling out variance in
the models we used would be problematic (see Spector
& Brannick, 2011 ). Of note, all of the participants in
the misophonia group enrolled with misophonia as
their primary complaint. In addition, to the best of
our knowledge, there is no evidence that misophonia
reactions are common sequelae of a primary mood or
substance use disorder.
More studies will be needed to determine whether
the clinical patterns in individuals with misophonia
diﬀer for those with and without co-occurring distur-
bances (e.g., through propensity score matching tech-
niques; Lee & Little, 2017 ). However, we speculate that
severe misophonia will typically be accompanied by
aﬀective disturbance and problematic coping beha-
viors. Therefore, we suggest that the current results
are generalizable to persons with the condition.
Longitudinal studies during symptom onset could
help distinguish whether inattention plays some role
in the etiology of misophonia, occurs as a result of
symptoms, or derives from secondary e ﬀects (e.g.,
depression, anxiety, and substance use). We propose
that di ﬃculties achieving and maintaining alertness
may create a state whereby aversive stimuli are poorly
predicted, and given higher salience on occurrence. In
addition, individuals with misophonia may have
weaker capacities for autogenic redirection and
distraction.
Studies have associated attentional dysregulation
with audiological conditions such as tinnitus (Hallam,
McKenna, & Shurlock, 2004 ; Roberts, Husain, &
Eggermont, 2013 ). Following Roberts et al. ( 2013 ),
Silva and Sanchez ( 2018 ) suggested that selective atten-
tion failures limit the allocation of perceptual proces-
sing resources in individuals with misophonia. Further,
poor auditory gating and sensory over-responsivity
(SOR) may be associated with de ﬁcits in predictive
coding (a top-down process; see Pelt et al., 2016 ).
This di ﬃculty anticipating and coding incoming sen-
sory information may account for the aberrant ERPB. FRANK ET AL. 72

responses documented in misophonia samples (e.g.,
Schröder et al., 2014 ). Sensory over-responsivity could
also explain the previously mentioned overlap with
psychiatric conditions (Cavanna & Seri, 2015 ). As was
suggested by Taylor ( 2017 ), misophonia may be a sub-
category of SOR conditions.
Individuals with di ﬃculty inhibiting their reactions to
trigger stimuli, and diminished ability to redirect their
attention, may show poor management of concomitant
stress. For example, Bardeen, Tull, Dixon-Gordon,
Stevens, and Gratz ( 2015) found that for participants
with lower attentional control, reported emotion dysre-
gulation corresponded with poor performance on
a distress tolerance task. In misophonia, this same pattern
could produce avoidance (a negative functional quality)
and prevent adaptation to stimuli encountered in daily
life (Frank & McKay, 2018). Attentional resources pro-
cessed in the anterior insula have previously been linked
to interoception, learning, error processing, and resultant
anxiety sensitivity (see Paulus & Stein, 2006). Both ante-
rior insula activity (Kumar et al., 2017) and anxiety (Wu
et al., 2014) may have critical functions in misophonia.
Understanding the neuropsychological pro ﬁle of miso-
phonia may help disentangle symptom etiology and pro-
vide guidance on the condition ’s functional impact.
The limitations of the current study include a small
sample, and the lack of a comprehensive neuropsycho-
logical battery. In order to best optimize our data, we
employed an iterative analytic procedure relying on
advanced statistical methodology (i.e., Bayesian estima-
tion via MCMC simulation). These methods have been
documented as among the superior approaches to ﬁt-
ting multi-level models (see Browne & Draper, 2006 ;
Shor, Bafumi, Keele, & Park, 2017 ). In addition, while
our sample was comparable in size to some prior
studies of misophonia (e.g., Edelstein et al., 2013 ), it
was smaller than others (e.g., Kumar et al., 2017 ),
especially studies conducted in the context of
a specialized clinic (Jastrebo ﬀ& Jastrebo ﬀ,2014 ;
Schröder, Vulink, van Loon, & Denys, 2017 ). We can-
not rule out the possibility of Type-II errors given this
study ’s limited sample. In addition, sounds were played
continuously, rather than time-locked to trial events
(i.e., stimuli on the ANT). It is possible that partici-
pants predicted the time-interval used in the current
study (15s), which dampened their distressing poten-
tial. We consider this unlikely given the random order
of sounds played, their short duration, and qualitative
reports that the exposure was distress-provoking.
However, our results may re ﬂect general rather than
competing e ﬀects of misophonia symptoms. We
employed this methodology in order to achieve ecolo-
gical validity of the e ﬀects, since misophonia stimuliare typically experienced as continuous and asynchro-
nous with task events. However, studies employing
time- and phase-locked stimuli may provide important
insights into the condition. The strengths of the cur-
rent study include a novel methodology that enabled
the examination of attentional functioning and symp-
tom provocation e ﬀects.
Due to the constraints and time demands of our
treatment protocol, we did not o ﬀer a full neuropsy-
chological battery. However, there could be great value
in comprehensively characterizing misophonia. In
addition, assessing attentional networks under symp-
tom-neutral conditions will be necessary to determine
whether alerting di ﬃculties relate to symptom-speci ﬁc
or generalized cognitive patterns. It may also be useful
to compare visual and auditory modalities of the ANT
(see Callejas, Lupiàñez, Funes, & Tudela, 2005 ). This
was a cross-sectional study with several limitations. We
cannot conclude whether misophonia symptoms were
the speci ﬁc cause of di ﬃculties in alerting attention, or
whether these di ﬃculties re ﬂect a long-standing weak-
ness. However, given the current results, attentional
vigilance should be an important feature for future
studies of misophonia to examine.
