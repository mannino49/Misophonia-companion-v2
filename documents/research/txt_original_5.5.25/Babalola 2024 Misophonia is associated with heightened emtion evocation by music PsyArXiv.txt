MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   2 
 
Abstract  
Misophonia is a disorder commonly characterized by negative emotional responses to “trigger ” 
sounds, such as chewing or tapping . It has been linked to conditions  like hyperacusis and PTSD ; 
however,  the relationship between misophonia and musical processing remains underexplored. 
Under the framework that misophonia stems from altered connectivity between  auditory and 
limbic  systems, we predicted that individuals with greater misophonia severity would also show 
stronger emotional responses to music.  From a large initial screening study ( n = 300), a subset of 
participants ( low misophonia: n = 58, high misophonia: n = 40) were asked about several 
musical and non -musical traits . Participants in the high misophonia group scored higher than the 
low misophonia group on several musical measures, including active engagement with music 
and emotion evocation from music. Participants in the high misophonia group also scored higher 
than the low misophonia group on hyperacusis  and PTSD tendencies,  replicating prior work.  The 
present study supports conceptualizing misophonia in terms of enhanced auditory -emotional 
responses, to both negative (“trigger”) and positive stimuli, such as music. The se findings fit 
within a small but growing body of research highlighting the positive emotional implications of 
misophonia, particularly in musical contexts.

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   3 
 
Misophonia is associated with heightened emotion evocation in music  
You hear your friend sniffling next to you and are instantly enraged. Your coworker is 
tapping their pen on the table during a meeting, and your physiological stress response  is 
activated. You avoid eating dinner with your family, so you don’t have to hear them chewing. In 
human auditory processing, the response to everyday sounds , such as chewing, breathing, or 
keyboard tapping typically garners little attention. But for some individuals  with misophonia , 
these everyday sounds can turn into a cacophonous ni ghtmare, invoking a visceral and 
uncontrollable negative response.  
Misophonia  is a condition where  individuals experience  an exceptionally  strong negative 
emotional response  (e.g., anger, anxiety)  to specific “trigger” sounds  or stimuli associated with 
such sound s (for review see Brout et al., 2018; Potgieter et al., 2019) . These negative responses 
do not seem to be elicited by general psychoa coustic  features of a sound (e.g.,  loudness , 
roughness ), but rather  by the specific meaning to an individual (Swedo et al., 2022) . Trigger 
sounds tend to be repetitive and generated by the body ( e.g., orofacial sounds ); however , any 
sound in principle could serve as a trigger for someone with misophonia. Although the 
mechanisms underlying misophonia are still debated (e.g., see Palumbo et al., 2018) , one 
possibility is that affective  brain  networks are  in a heightened state of excitation  in response to 
auditory input  amon g individuals with misophonia  (Møller, 2011) . In support of this framework, 
Kumar et al. (2017)  found heightened activity  and altered functional connectivity of the anterior 
insular cortex  – a core component of the salience network  - among individuals with misophonia  
when  listen ing to trigger sounds . 
Misophoni a is distinct from other auditory processing conditions, such as  hyperacusis, 
which is characterized by physical discomfort or pain upon hearing  sounds at a level of loudness

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   4 
 
that would be tolerable for most people (Henry et al., 2022) . Unlike misophonia, hyperacusis is 
not confined to specific trigger sounds but encompasses a wide array of everyday noises, often 
rendering even moderate  decibel  sounds unbearably loud and uncomfortable for those 
experiencing it. While auditory disorders, including hyperacusis, are often comorbid with 
misophonia (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014) , it is worth noting that the field of audiology 
generally classifies misophonia as a subtype of hyperacusis, rather than a distinct disorder (Tyler 
et al., 2014) . The potential link between experiencing misophonia and hyperacusis remains 
unclear. It is theorized that distressing hyperacusis might amplify anxiety and depression, 
heightening an individual's likelihood of developing a strong reaction to trigger sound s, as seen 
in misophonia (Aazh et al., 2022) . Alternatively, hyperacusis could potentially divert an 
individuals' attention, preventing them from attending to potentially bothersome misophonic 
trigger sounds (Aazh et al., 2022) . The relationship between misophonia and hyperacusis thus 
remains uncertain. There is no clear indication of whether the likelihood of experiencing 
misophonia is associated with hyperacusis. It is important to note that previous studies have not 
thoroughly examined the relationship between the impact of hyperacusis and t he presence of 
misophonia. However, a study by Aazh et al.  (2022)  identified that among a population seeking 
assistance from an audiology clinic for tinnitus  (a perceived ringing or buzzing sound that does 
not have an external source)  and/or hyperacusis, 23% were classified as  also having misophonia.  
Initially, misophonia was not thought to be associated with psychopathology (Jastreboff 
& Jastreboff, 2014) . However , accumulating research shows that the condition is associated with 
elevated anxiety and stress -related  symptoms, as well as increased co -occurrence with anxiety 
disorders, post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),  autism spectrum disorder (ASD), mood 
disorders , and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  (Abramovitch et al., 2024; Erfanian et al.,

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   5 
 
2019; Potgieter et al., 2019) . Research has even found genetic correlations between misophonia 
and psychiatric personalities/disorders including major depression disorder, PTSD, generalized 
anxiety disorder, and neuroticism (Smit et al., 2023) . Neuroticism is the tendency to experience 
frequent and intense negative emotions in response to various sources of stress. The responses 
include anxiety, irritability, anger, and the experience of anxious or depressive moods (Barlow et 
al., 2014) . Anger and anxiety are common emotional responses to misophonic triggers  (McKay 
et al., 2018) , suggesting  that neuroticism could be useful in understanding misophonia. It has 
been suggested that neuroticism may be a potential vulnerability factor for misophonia, as 
neurotic individuals may be prone to developing misophonic reactions to sounds they find 
aversi ve (Cassiello -Robbins et al., 2020) .  
Less is known about misophonia as it relates to musicianship and music processing, 
although there is some evidence that active musicians experience higher noise sensitivity than 
non-musicians (Franěk, 2009; Jansen et al., 2009) . Although there ar e anecdotal accounts of 
musicians who experience misophonia (Kuehn, 2015) , few studies have directly examined 
whether musicians are more likely than non -musicians to experience misophonia . It is evident 
that musicians differ from non -musicians in their response to both musical and non -musical 
sounds, particularly affective sounds. There is overwhelming evidence that musicians process 
fundamental musical components such as pitch, melody, timbr e, chords, and musical rhythm 
more efficiently than non -musicians (Franěk et al., 1991; Matthews et al., 2016; Rammsayer et 
al., 2012; Repp, 2010) . Musicians also outperform non -musicians in recognizing emotion 
conveyed through music, and they have more consistent, rapid, and intense experiences with 
both positive and negative musical emotion (Akkermans et al., 2019; Castro & Lima, 2014; Park 
et al., 2014; Steinbeis et al., 2006) . Musicians have been shown to have stronger emotional

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   6 
 
responses than non -musicians, with specific neural activations linked to their musical training. 
For example, musicians rate sadness and fear as significantly more arousing than non -musicians, 
and musical training has been linked to specific neural activat ions in response to these emotions 
expressed in music (Park et al., 2014) . In summary, musicians differ from non -musicians in their 
emotional responses to both musical and non -musical sounds ; thus, if individuals higher in 
misophonia symptomology are also more likely to be musicians, this could be one poten tial 
explanation for why individuals with misophonia might experience heightened emotional 
responses to music.  
Even if misophonia is not associated with greater amounts of musical training , there are 
other reasons to expect that misophonia might relate to the emotional processing of music.  If 
misophonia is characterized by  altered auditory -limbic connections , as has been suggested  (e.g.,  
Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2023) , then individuals experiencing misophonia might demonstrate 
altered (heightened) affective responses to positive sounds , such as  music . In support of th is idea, 
recent work has found a positive correlation between  video -induced misophonic experiences and 
frisson  reactions  to music  (“chills” or “goosebumps”) , indicating that listeners who experience 
greater misophonic reactions a lso have increased  physiological reactions associated with emotion 
processing  in the context of music (Mednicoff et al., 2023) . These authors also fin d positive 
associations between misophonic experiences and autonomous sensory meridian response 
(ASMR) , which is commonly described as a  pleasant  tingling sensation  across the  head or back 
of the neck in response to certain auditory stimuli (Rouw & Erfanian, 2018) . These studies 
suggest that individuals with more severe misophonia symptoms may experience overall 
heightened associations between sounds and affect , regardless of positive or negative valence.

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   7 
 
The current stud y uses a quasi -experimental design to assess how misophonia relates to 
facets of auditory and emotional processing , with a specific emphasis on musical processing . A 
large sample of participants initially completed the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A -MISO -S) 
as part of a pre -screening study. Two groups of  participants, matched on demographic variables  
(e.g., age, gender, education, race/ethnicity)  but differing in misophonia severity, were then 
invited to complete the main study, which assessed participants’ musicality, emotional responses 
to music, general auditory sensitivity and prefer ence, and dispositional factors (e.g., anxiety, 
PTSD). Based on prior research, we predicted that individuals in the high misophonia group 
would display higher levels of anxiety, PTSD,  autism traits,  and hyperacusis compared to  
individuals in the low misophonia group. Additionally, b ased on the notion that misophonia 
represents altered connectivity between auditory and limbic  pathways, we predicted that 
individuals in the high misophonia group would  show higher levels of musicianship, and would 
also show st ronger emotional responses to music  relative to individuals in the low misophonia 
group.  
Method  
Participants  
 We recruited 300 participants for the initial misophonia screening . Participant  eligibility 
for the main study  was determined based on responses to  the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A -
MISO -S), in addition to data quality assessments (see Participant Inclusion  for details).  From 
this initial screening, 111 participants (low misophonia: n = 67; high misophonia: n = 44) were  
invited to complete the main study , with 98 participants (low misophonia: n = 58; high 
misophonia: n = 40) ultimately completing the study.  Participants across groups were well

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   8 
 
matched in terms of  demographic variables  (age, gender, education, and race/ethnicity ), but 
differed as expected on reported misophonia  (Table 1 ). All participants were recruited from 
Amazon Mechanical Turk  via CloudResear ch (Litman, 2017) , with all participants successfully 
passing internally administered attention checks from CloudResearch. Participants were treated 
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the 
Huron University  Research Ethics Board.

Materials  
Screening  
 Self-reported m isophonia was assessed via the A -MISO -S (Schröder et al., 2013) . The A -
MISO -S consists of six  questions (e.g., “How much of your time is occupied by misophonia 
triggers? ”) that are answered on a Likert -type scale of 0  (e.g., None ) to 4 (e.g., Extreme : Greater 
than 8 hrs/day or near constant (thoughts about) triggers ), with higher values representing  
greater severity of misophonia . The final question of the A-MISO -S is a free response item, in 
which individuals are asked  to state what would be the worst thing to happen to them if they 
were unable to avoid the misophonia  triggers.  Prior to completing the A -MISO -S, participants 
were provided with a definition of misophonia  and were asked (1) whether they experience  
misophonia on a scale from 1 (Definitely no ) to 5 (Definitely yes ) and (2) whether they had heard 
of misophonia prior to participating in the study ( Yes, No). In the present study, the  six Likert -
type questions of the  A-MISO -S displayed excellent  reliability , α = .94, and the summed score 
from the six items  significantly correlated with the single -item self-reported experience of 
misophonia , r(96) = .55, p < .001,  providing convergent validity . The final free response item 
from the A -MISO -S was not specifically considered in terms of misophonia severity, but rather

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   9 
 
was used as a data quality assessment (see Participant Inclusion for details). Prior to answering 
questions about their experiences with misophonia, p articipants  completed a short demographic 
questionnaire, in which they provided age (in years),  gender,  level of education , employment 
status , proficiency with English, and race/ethnicity. The screening assessment was administered 
in Qualtrics (Provo, UT).  
Main Study  
 Questionnaires . Musical ity was assessed via two measures: the Goldsmiths Musical 
Sophistication Index (Gold -MSI; Müllensiefen et al., 2014)  and the Barcelona Musical Reward 
Questionnaire (BRMQ; Mas -Herrero et al., 2013) . The Gold -MSI assesses a variety of musical 
skills (e.g., “I can sing or play music from memory”) and general musical behaviors (e.g., “ I 
enjoy writing about music, for example on blogs and forums ”). Participants rated 3 8 statements 
on a scale  from 1 ( e.g., Completely disagree ) to 7 ( e.g., Completely agree ) in terms of how well 
each statement described themselves . The final t wo questions (assessing which instrument 
participants play best and which musical genre participants prefer) were not  included in  the 
present analys es. The Gold -MSI has  five subscales: (1) Active Engagement, (2) Perceptual 
Abilities, (3)  Musical Training, (4) Singing Abilities, and (5) Emotions.  The reliability of the 
Gold -MSI for this sample  was excellent, α = .94, with each subscale exhibiting good reliability  
(range from α = .71 to .88) . Mean scores were calculated for the overall Gold -MSI, as well as for 
each factor.  The BRMQ assesses the extent to which individuals find music rewarding along five 
factors: (1)  Music Seeking, (2) Emotion Evocation, (3)  Mood Regulation, (4) Social Reward, and 
(5) Sensory Motor. Participants rated 20 statements  (e.g., “ I can become tearful or cry when I 
listen to a melody I like very music) ” on a scal e from 1  (Completely disagree ) to 5 ( Completely 
agree ). Two items were reverse scored . The reliability of the BMRQ  for this sample  was

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   10 
 
excellent, α = .92 , with each  factor of the BRMQ  exhibit ing good  reliability  (range from α = .70 
to .82). Summed  scores were calculated for the overall scale, as well as for each factor.  
Broader e motional responses to stimuli were assessed via two measures, a modified 
version of the  ASMR -Experience Questionnaire (AEQ; Swart et al., 2022)  and a word aversion 
questionnaire  (WAQ)  modelled on Thibodeau (2016) . The modified AEQ provided participants 
with a definition of ASMR  and asked if they were capable of experiencing ASMR  using  a Likert-
type scale ranging from 1 (Definitely yes ) to 5 ( Definitely no ). The WAQ  presented participants 
with a total of six words: three words (milk, chew , meal ) broadly associated with eating and 
predicted to be aversive to participants with misophonia , and three  minimal pair  control words 
(silk, new, teal). Participants answered six questions related to each word : (1) How often they use 
the word in both speaking and writing , (2) How often they hear the word in everyday use , (3) 
How aversive the word is to them , (4) How positive versus negative the word is , (5) How 
exciting or attention -grabbing the word is, and (6) How easily the word brings an im age to mind. 
Each response was made on a 100 -point slider scale . Separate m ean scores for the suspected 
misophonic trigger words  and control words  were calculated for each question . In the present 
study, only the questions related to  emotional valence (Questions 3, 4, and 5)  were analyzed . 
 General sensitivity to sound was assessed via the Hyperacusis Handicap Questionnaire 
(HHQ; Prabhu & Nagaraj, 2020) . The HHQ consists of 21 questions (e.g., “ How often do you 
avoid doing a certain task or going out because you have to be in a noisy place/situation? ”) 
which participants rated on a  Likert -type scale ranging from 0 ( Never ) to 4 ( Always ). The HHQ 
is evenly divided into  (1) functional, (2) social, and (3) emotional subscales of hyperacusis. The 
HHQ for this sample displayed good  overall  reliability,  α = .87,  with each subscale additionally

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   11 
 
exhibiting adequate reliability  (range from α = .63 to .82). Mean scores were calculated for each 
subscale.   
 Personality was assessed via the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI; Gosling et al., 
2003) . Each item of the TIPI consists of two descriptors  (e.g., “ Anxious, easily upset ”), with 
participants rating how well both descriptors described themselves on a Likert -type scale ranging 
from 1 ( Not at all ) to 5 ( Extremely ). There were two items for each of the five personality factors 
(Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) . One item per factor 
was reverse scored. Although the TIPI is not expected to have strong  reliability given that only 
two items compose each factor, the  present administration found  good reliability for two factors 
(Extraversion: α = .79; Neuroticism: α = .70), adequate reliability for  Conscientiousness ( α = 
.59), and inadequate reliability for Agreeableness ( α = .41) and Openness ( α = .41). Mean scores 
were calculated for each subscale.  
  Posttraumatic s tress, anxiety, and depression were assessed via three measures: the 
National Stressful Events Survey PTSD Short Scal e (NSESSS -PTSD; LeBeau et al., 2014) , the 
Short F orm State Anxiety Inventory  (SF-SAI; Zsido et al., 2020) , and the Patient Health 
Questionnaire  (PHQ -9; Kroenke et al., 2011) , respectively.  The NSESSS -PTSD consist s of nine 
questions  that assess how bothered participants are by problems over the past seven days , 
triggered by an extreme ly stressful event or experience (e.g., “Trying to avoid thoughts, feelings, 
or physical sensations that reminded you of a stressful experience?” ). Participants respond on a 
Likert -type scale ranging from 0 ( Not at all ) to 4 ( Extremely ), and mean scores were calculated 
as an indicator of current PTSD symptoms . The NSESSS -PTSD  for this sample  displa yed 
excellent reliability  (α = .95). The SF -SAI consists of 5 items  (e.g., “ I feel that difficulties are 
piling up so that I cannot overcome them. ”), which participants rate on a Likert -type scale

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   12 
 
ranging from 1 ( Not at all ) to 4 ( Very much so ). The SF -SAI for this sample displayed excellent 
reliability  (α = .92) , and mean scores were calculated as an indicator of current anxiety. The 
PHQ -9 consist s of nine personal descriptors (e.g., “Feeling tired or having little energy”) , which 
participants rate on a Likert -type scale ranging from 0 ( Not at all ) to 3 ( Nearly every day ) in 
terms of how often participants have felt this way over the past two weeks.  The PHQ -9 for this 
sample  displayed excellent  reliability  (α = .92), and mean scores were calculated as  an indicator 
of current feelings of depression.  
 Behaviors associated with ASD were assessed via the 10-item Autism Spectrum Q uotient 
(AQ-10; Allison et al., 2012) . The AQ -10 consists of  statements (e.g., “ I know how to tell if 
someone listening to me is getting bored. ”), which participants rate on a Likert -type scale 
ranging from 1 ( Definitely agree ) to 4 ( Definitely disagree ). Six items are reverse scored (i.e., 
disagreeing is consistent with ASD traits ). For each item, if  the response is consistent with ASD  
traits (e.g., responding with a “3” or “4” to the example prompt ), participants receive a “1”; 
otherwise, they receive a “0”. Scores are then summed (ranging from 0 -10), with scores above 6 
taken to indicate potentially clinical ASD. The AQ -10 for this sample  displayed adequate  
reliability  (α = .67) . 
 Sound  Rating Task. Participants rated a total of 80 short (5 -second) sounds on a scale 
from 1 (Extremely unpleasant ) to 5 ( Extremely pleasant ). Sounds were presented in three total 
forms: unaltered  (n = 20), time -domain scrambled ( n = 30), and noise vocoded ( n = 30). The 
unaltered sounds consisted of 10 recordings from nature (e.g., birdsong, crashing waves) and 10 
recordings from urban environments  (e.g., background chatter, traffic)  used in prior work (e.g., 
Van Hedger et al., 2019) . The time -domain scrambled and noise -vocoded sounds consisted of the 
same 20 nature and urban sounds, plus an additional 10 sounds widely considered to be

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   13 
 
misophonic triggers (e.g., chewing, breathing, knuckle cracking, lip smacking) . We did not 
present these misophonic trigger sounds in their unaltered forms, as we did not want to cause 
undue distress in the high misophonia group. Time -domain scrambling was selected to preserve 
the long -term spectral profiles of each sound, while disrupting the temporal transitions critical 
for sound object identification (Van Hedger, Nusbaum, Heald, et al., 2019) . Noise vocoding was 
selected to preserve the temporal profiles of each sound, while disrupting the spectral profiles 
(e.g., see Shannon et al., 1995) . Both time -domain scrambling and noise vocoding were done 
through Matlab (MathWorks: Natick, MA). Scrambled sounds were chopped into a set of short  
(25 ms) windows with 50% overlap , tapered with a raised cosine window. The  25 ms windows 
were then shuffled and re -overlapped within a 250 ms radius . Noise vocoded sounds used 4 
frequency bands (120 to 498 Hz, 498 to 1378 Hz, 1378 to 3426 Hz, and 3426 to 8192 Hz ). 
Within each band, the amplitude envelope was extracted and modelled with white noise. All 
sounds w ere normalized to -25 dB Full Spectrum.  Mean rating scores were calculated for each 
sound type (unaltered nature, unaltered urban, scrambled  nature, scrambled urban, scrambled 
misophonia, vocoded nature, vocoded urban, vocoded misophonia). The sound rating task was 
programmed in jsPsych (de Leeuw, 2015) . 
Procedure  
Screening  
 After providing informed consent, participants answered demographic questions  and an 
attention check , in which they wer e given a scale and were instructed to select a specific 
response option.  Following the  initial  attention check, participants completed the A -MISO -S. 
There was a second attention check embedded  within the A -MISO -S (following the Likert -type 
responses and preceding the free response question), similar in nature to the first attention check.

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   14 
 
Following the A -MISO -S, participants were given a unique completion code and compensated 
with $1.25 USD.  
Main Study  
 Eligible participants were invited to complete the main study via a personalized email 
announcement, sent through CloudResearch . Eligible participants had 30 days to complete the 
main study  from its launch, which occurred 4 days after the initial screening . After providing 
informed consent, p articipants completed the questionnaires (Gold -MSI, BMRQ, AEQ, WAQ, 
HHQ, TIPI, NSESSS -PTSD , SF-SAI, PHQ -9, AQ -10) in a randomized order. Following the 
questionnaires, participants were automatically redirected to the sound rating task  and upon task 
completion participants were given a unique completion code and compensated with $10 .00 
USD.  
Participant Inclusion  
 There were five primary considerations for participants who completed the initial 
screening to be invited to participate in the main study. First, participants had to pass both 
attention checks. Second, participants could not have completed the entire survey in under two 
minutes, as this represented a completion time that was over twice as fast as the average 
completion time of 4 minutes and 26 seconds , and  was considered by the researchers to represent 
an insufficient amount of time to thoroughly read the  prompts and response options of the A -
MISO -S. The third consideration was that participants could not have skipped questions,  as this  
either  invalidated the calculation of their misophonia score or did not allow for proper 
demographic comparisons across the constructed misophonia groups. The fourth consideration 
was an inadequate or otherwise suspicious answer on the free response question of the A -MISO -
S. Although we expected a large degree of variability in these  free responses depending on one’s

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   15 
 
self-reported misophonic severity, some participants  provid ed a definition of misophonia 
accessed from a search engine or answer ed the question in a way that was nonsensical given the 
prompt. Two authors ( OB and SVH ) independently rated the free response answers and then 
discussed discrepancies  (1.7% of responses)  until a determination was made  as to whether the 
free response was acceptable for inclusion . Assuming participants satisfied the first four 
inclusion criteria, the  fifth and final consideration wa s participants’ scores on the A -MISO -S. To 
be invited to the low misophonia group, participants had to score under 4 (defined as Subclinical  
misophonia symptoms ). To be invited to the high misophonia group, participants had to score 
above 10 ( defined as Moderate  misophonia symptoms) .  
Data Analysis  
 Data were analyzed in R  4.3.0  (R Core Team). A series of independent samples t-tests 
were used to assess group differences between the low and high misophonia participants. For 
each analysis, we additionally calculated effect sizes (Cohen’s d) using the “effsize” package.  
Given  the number of administered measures, we report both the uncorrected p-values and the 
False Discovery Rate (FDR) q-values (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995) , which provides a multiple 
comparison correction that limits the Type I Error (i.e., false discoveries) to our specified alpha 
cut-off of 5%.   
Results  
Music ality and Emotional Responses to Music  
 Participants  in the high misophonia group scored overall higher on the Gold -MSI 
compared to participants in the low misophonia group , t(96) = 2.72, p = .008, q = .018, d = 0.5 6. 
For the subscales, high misophonia participants reported greater active engagement with music,

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   16 
 
t(96) = 3.27, p = .00 2, q = .004, d = 0.6 7, as well as greater amounts of musical training, t(96) = 
3.01, p = .00 3, q = .009, d = 0.62. No other subscale of the Gold -MSI differed across group ( qs > 
.105). In terms of experiencing musical reward, there was no overall difference between high and 
low misophonia participants on the BMRQ , t(96) = 1.53, p = .130, q = .244, d = 0.31. However, 
participants in the high misophonia group scored higher on the emotion evocation subscale of the 
BMRQ compared to participants in the low misophonia group, t(96) = 2.80, p = .006, q = .015, d 
= 0.57. No other subscale was significant (all qs > .104). Figure 1  plots the group comparisons 
across all musical measures.  
[[Figure 1 about here]]  
Sound Sensitivity  
 Participants in the high misophonia group reported a greater degree of hyperacusis 
compared to participants in the low misophonia condition, as measured by the overall score on 
the HHQ, t(96) = 7.87, p < .001, q < .001, d = 1.62. The functional, social, and emotional 
handicaps of hyperacusis were additionally higher among the high misophonia participants (all 
ps and qs < .001), with each subscale showing a large effect size (functional: d = 1.21, social: d = 
1.40, emotional: d = 1.41). Figure 2 plots the gr oup comparisons across the HHQ subscales . 
[[Figure 2 about here]]  
Emotional Responses  to Non-Musical S timuli  
 For the WAQ, participants in the high misophonia group reported greater aversion to both 
the trigger words , t(96) = 5.21, p < .001, q < .001, d = 1.0 7, and the control words, t(96) = 4.52, p 
< .001,  q < .001, d = 0.93, compared to participants in the low misophonia group. Participants in 
the high misophonia group also rated the trigger words, t(96) = 4.62, p < .001, q < .001, d = 0.95,

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   17 
 
and the control words, t(96) = 3.49, p < .001, q = .00 2, d = 0.7 2, as more exciting and attention -
grabbing. There were no group differences in terms of how positive or negative the trigger and 
control words were rated ( qs > .682). For the sound rating task, we observed no differences 
across groups as a function of each sound category (all qs > .273). Participants in the high 
misophonia group nominally reported a lower capacity to experience ASMR; however, the group 
difference was not significant after false discovery rate correction, t(96) = -2.05, p = .043, q = 
.095, d = 0.42.  
Personality  and Autistic Traits  
 Participants in the high misophonia group  scored significantly higher on neuroticism, 
t(96) = 3.53, p < .001, q  = .00 2, d = 0.73, and significantly lower on conscientiousness , t(96) = -
4.32, p < .001, q  < .001, d = 0.89, compared to participants in the low misophonia group. The 
two groups did not differ on extraversion, openness, or agreeableness (all qs > .391). In terms of 
autism traits, con sistent  with our prediction, p articipants in the high misophonia group scored 
significantly higher on the AQ -10 compared to participants in the low misophonia group, t(96) = 
3.69, p < .001, q = .00 1, d = 0.7 6. 
PTSD , Anxiety, and Depression  
 Compared to participants in the low misophonia condition, p articipants in the high 
misophonia group reported significantly greater amounts of posttraumatic stress, t(96) = 6.09, p 
< .001, q < .001, d = 1.25, greater anxiety , t(96) = 5. 39, p < .001, q < .001, d = 1.11, and greater 
depress ive symptoms, t(96) = 5. 56, p < .001, q < .001, d = 1.14.

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   18 
 
Discussion  
The field of misophonia research faces a pressing question: Does misophonia’s scope 
expand beyond aversive reactions to “trigger sounds” and auditory sensitivity to include 
heightened emotional responses to a wider range of stimuli, including music ? The present study 
finds several factors are associat ed with misophonia, including  musicality, emotion evocation 
from music,  sound sensitivity,  language perception,  personality, autism traits, and symptoms 
related to PTSD, anxiety , and depression . These findings  support the conceptualization of 
misophonia as a multifaceted construct  with both positive and negative associations . 
As hypothesized, individuals with misophonia reported greater active engagement with 
music, greater amounts of musical training , and stronger emotion evocation from music . This 
suggests that individuals with misophonia might seek out and engage with music more compared 
to those without misophonia. This  additionally supports the contention that misophonia can 
involve heightened affective responses to positive sounds, like music, in addition to negative 
trigger sounds. Further research could explore whether m usic serves as a distraction, or  coping 
mechanism  to modulate emotional arousal , in individuals with misophonia. The  finding that 
individuals higher in misophonia  scored higher on the emotion evocation subscale of the BMRQ  
conceptually supports recent work examining  how misophonia relates to positive emotional 
responses to sounds, including  musical frisson (Mednicoff et al., 2023)  and is more broadly 
aligned with the framework that misophonia is characterized by altered auditory -limbic 
connections (cf. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2023) .  
However, Mednicoff et al. (2023) also f ound  that misophonia was not related to 
musicality and was positively associated with ASMR. In the present study, we found that 
misophonia related to some facets of musicality  (overall musicality scores, active engagement,

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   19 
 
and musical training)  and was (nominally) negatively  associated with the capacity to experience 
ASMR.  These differing results could be due to differences in study design as well as task 
construction. Although the musicality assessment  (Gold -MSI)  was the same in both studies,  
Mednicoff (2023)  used a correlational design (i.e., examining variability in misophonia across 
the full range of responses) whereas we used a quasi -experimental design (constructing groups of 
individuals who have low and high misophonia e xperiences). If musicality is related to 
misophonia in a non -linear manner, this could potentially explain why we found associations 
between misophonia and musicality and Mednicoff et al. (2023)  did not. With respect to ASMR, 
the present study differed from Mednicoff et al. (2023)  by only assessing ASMR using a single 
item, self -report measure. In contrast, Mednicoff et al. (2023)  played ASMR -inducing videos to 
individuals and examined self -reported emotional responses. Thus, it is possible that individuals 
high in misophonia might expect to dislike ASMR videos  (particularly given that the source of 
the sounds can be orofacial, such as whispering)  but ultimately deriv e emotional enjoyment from 
them when experiencing  them. Nevertheless, these divergent findings highlight the need for 
further  researc h to clarify  the underlying mechanisms of misophonia , ASMR , and musical frisson 
given  that there m ight be some overlap or interaction between the sensory process es involved in 
these phenomena.  
Participants in the high misophonia group reported  hypersensitivity to sound and greater 
aversion to specific words compared to participants in the low misophonia group.  Specifically, 
functional, social, and emotional hyperacusis handicaps were significantly elevated  in the high 
misophonia group. This suggests that individuals with misophonia experience not only 
heightened aversion to specific trigger sounds , but also significant impairments in daily 
functioning, social interactions, and emotional well -being due to their sensitivity to sound.

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   20 
 
Additionally, participant s in the high misophonia group reported greater aversion to both the 
trigger words and the control words  presented on the WAQ , and also found the se words to be 
more exciting and attention -grabbing. Engaging in thoughts or imaginings involving 
verbalization often conjures images of forming words, a process that inherently involves the 
orofacial region, potentially leading to negative associations for those with misophonia. For the 
trigger words, this suggests that the mere anticipati on of encountering a trigger, can sometimes 
suffice to elicit a response on its own. This suggests that the anticipation of discomfort or 
aversion can itself serve as a trigger, underscoring the complex interplay between cognitive 
processes, sensory experi ences, and emotional responses. In terms of the control words, an 
examination of discourse on Reddit (2022) revealed discussions among individuals with 
misophonia concerning specific letter sounds that evoke aversive responses . This discussion 
informed the  use of non -food related words ( silk, teal, new ) as control words. Notably, letters 
such as "p," "k," and "s" emerged as salient triggers within these conversations. This observation 
underscores the nuanced nature of misophonia, indicating that the condition extends beyond 
conventional triggers such as c hewing or sniffling. The identification of phonetic elements as 
triggers highlights the potential for misophonia to manifest in response to a broader range of 
stimuli, including linguistic components intrins ic to speech production. More research should be 
conducted into the linguistic elements of misophonia triggers.  
Participants in the high misophonia group  also scored significantly higher on neuroticism, 
indicating a predisposition to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, irritability, and 
distress. Additionally, they scored significantly lower on conscientiousness, reflecting lower 
levels of self -discip line, organization, and reliability. These personality traits may exacerbate the 
emotional and behavioral responses to misophonic triggers, contributing to the overall symptom

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   21 
 
severity and impairment experienced by individuals with misophonia.  Clinicians and researchers 
should recognize that individuals with misophonia may exhibit heightened emotional reactivity 
and lower self -discipline, which could influence responses to misophonic triggers and overall 
coping strategies. Interventions focusin g on emotion regulation and coping skills may be 
particularly beneficial for individuals with misophonia characterized by high neuroticism and 
low conscientiousness.  
Participants in the high misophonia group scored significantly higher on the AQ -10, 
indicating elevated levels of autism -related traits. This finding supports the hypothesis that there 
may be an overlap between misophonia and autism spectrum symptoms, char acterized by 
difficulties in sensory processing, emotional reactivity , and repetitive behaviors.  Both ASD and 
misophonia involve atypical sensory processing, characterized by heightened sensitivity to 
sensory stimuli. Individuals with ASD often experience sensory sensitivities across multiple 
modalities, including auditory, visual, tactile, and olfactory domains. Similarly, individuals with 
misophonia exhibit hypersensitivity to specific auditory, and at times  visual and tactile, stimuli , 
which can evoke intense emotional and physiological responses. Moreover, i n ASD, emotional 
regulation difficulties are a core feature, characterized by atypical emotional responses and 
difficulties in interpreting and regulating emotions.  Individuals with misophonia  can als o 
experience intense emotional reactions, such as anger, anxiety, or distress, in response to trigger 
sounds.  These shared features may explain the finding of overlap in ASD and misophonia.  
Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms linking misophonia and autism 
traits  in general population samples.   
Finally, t hose with high misophonic symptoms also reported significantly more 
symptoms related to  PTSD, anxiety, and depress ion compared to the low misophonia group.

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   22 
 
These symptoms suggested altered emotion -related functioning within these individuals, and 
prior research has also identified associations  between  misophonia and altered functional 
connectivity among brain networks responsible for emotion  processing and  regulation  (Kumar et 
al., 2017) . Prior research also indicates that PTSD and depression, along with obsessive 
compulsive disorder and anorexia, are common psychiatric comorbidities of misophonia 
(Erfanian et al., 2019) . Although participants in this study were not asked to report clinical 
diagnoses, the presence of a higher degree of psychiatric symptoms in participants high in 
misophonia indicates that misophonia might be more likely to co -occur with other affective 
disorders.  
The present study has several notable limitations. First, all data were collected via self -
report measures from an online sample of participants. While past research has shown that  
similar methodologies  produce high quality data (Hauser et al., 2023) , we cannot  rule out the 
possibility that participants did not accurately complete the questionnaire measures used in this 
study. Furthermore, given the research question self -report measures are an important feature of 
the study design, as it is not possible to rand omly assign participants to experience misophonia.  
Second, the data for this study are cross -sectional and associations between study variables 
cannot establish causality. It is not presently known whether musical training influences the 
subsequent develop ment of misophonia symptoms or whether engagement with music represents 
a potential coping mechanism  employed by those with misophonia to manage negative affective 
reactions . Further research on the development of misophonia is needed to begin addressing 
these questions.  
Despite these limitations, the presents study provides initial findings exploring the 
relationship between misophonia and  different facets of auditory and emotional processing.

MISOPHONIA AND EMOTION   23 
 
Overall, we find that individuals high in misophonia also report greater engagement with music, 
more  emotion evocation from music, and heightened sound sensitivity, as well as higher levels of 
neuroticism, autism traits, and symptoms related to PTSD, anxiety, and depression compared to 
individuals who do not experience misophonia in their daily lives. Im portantly, the findings of 
this study suggest that individuals with misophonia might have heightened affective responses to 
positive auditory stimuli, and this represents a promising direction for future research.
