Abstract  
Misophonia is a newly recognized condition involving adverse emotional reactions to 
environmental sounds, most often produced by other people.  This study reports result s of a 
survey describing the phenomenology of misophonia based on a large sample.  Survey data 
were collected from individuals self -identified as having misophonia. A total of 1,061 individuals 
reported specific distressing reactions to sounds, and responses indicating severity of 
misophonia and perceived comorbidity.  Over 82% of respondents were female. The average 
age of the study participants was 37.49 years ( SD = 12.24; range from 18 to 72).  Most 
respondents reported multiple triggers and adverse emotional reactions, as well as multiple coping responses. The majority of respondents reported comorbid diagnoses. Misophonia 
severity is described,  as well as impact on quality of life. A minority of respondents had some 
experience with treatment and most reported no change  in symptoms .  Treatments reported for 
misophonia were typically ineffective, and once developed, misophonia symptoms persist. T he 
results of the study  showed that m isophoni a is a newly recognized condition that appears to 
have important impact on people’s lives.  It typically develops in early life, and is associated with 
a reduced quality of life, substantial comorbidity, negative emotional experiences,  and 
behaviors that are likely to impact interpersonal relationships.

Misophonia is a newly recognized and little -studied condition characterized by extreme 
emotional reactions to normal volume environmental sounds. The term , coined by Ja sterboff 
and Jasterboff  (2002) , literally means ‘ hatred of sound’ . Individuals with this condi tion are 
typically negatively affected by sounds produced by other individuals , or, less commonly , by 
mechanical sounds.  The most common triggers appear to be mouth sounds , such as chewing, 
crunching  and lip smacking , and sounds related to breathing , including sniffing and loud 
breathing. Other  commonly reported  triggers are  man- made mechanical sounds , including 
keyboard noises and pen clicking. Some people with misophonia also find that certain visual 
stimuli associated with trigger sounds  or repetitive motions not associated with any sounds will 
produce the responses ordinarily elic ited by sounds ( Bernstein et al.,  2013;  Dozier, 2015a, 
2015b , 2015c ; Edelstein  et al.,  2013 ; Johnson et al ., 2013;  Schröder  et al.,  2013). Typical 
responses to t riggering  sounds (triggers) include aversive emotional reactions, such as  disgust,  
anger , or rage (Schröder et al., 2013) , and sometimes physical reflex responses (Dozier, 
2015a, 2015b , 2015c ; Dozier & Morrison, 2017;  Dozier  et al.,  2020; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ). 
The reaction to the sounds also typically includes an impulse to confront the person making the 
sound or to escape from the sound . These reactions may cause impairment in functioning,  
which impact s performance at work and disrupt s relationships.

 Previous studies have described m isophonia variously  as reflecting a conditioned reflex 
(Dozier, 2015b, 2015c;  Dozier & Morrison, 2017 ; Dozier, et al., 2020; Jasterboff & Jasterboff, 
2002,  2014;  Schröder et al., 2013); as related to neural processing of sound ( Schwartz  et al., 
2011); as a symptom of obsessive- compulsive disorder  (OCD) , generalized anxiety disorder, or 
schizotypal personality disorder ( Cavanna, 2014;  Ferreira et al., 2013); as associated with “just 
right” OCD and Tourette’s disorder ( Neal & Cavanna, 2013 ); and as a discrete disorder on the 
obsessive compulsive spectrum ( Schröder et al., 2013 ). The correlation between OCD and 
misophonia ( Ferreira et al., 2013;  Schröder et al., 2013;  Webber  et al.,  2014) sug gests that 
misophonia may share phenomenological characteristics with OCD, anxiety, and depressive 
disorders, but does not necessarily indicate that these symptoms are rooted in a common condition (Wu et al., 2014). Indeed, variable phenomena  including excessive response to 
sound are also characteristic of some neurodevelopmental disorders , such as tic disorders , 
ADHD,  and autism spectrum disorders ( Cavanna & Seri, 2015;  Crossley & Cavanna 2013).  
 Despite being first described in the literature over 15 years ago, there are few published 
investigations of misophonia prevalence and pathogenesis.  Most of the studies that do exist 
have been based on small cohorts , and have used differ ent approaches to assessment, and 
different definitions of misophonia, leading to some confusion in the field.  The impact of 
misophonia on quality of life has not been studied.  
Schröder  et al. (2013)  assessed 42 patients with misophonia symptoms recruited from a 
hospital website. Assessment included a psychiatric interview, measures of depression, a 
symptom checklist , a structured interview (SCID -II) and the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A -
MISO -S) severity scale.  The A -MISO -S was developed by Schröder et al .(2013)  based on the 
Yale-Brown Obsessive- Compulsive Scale ( Y-BOCS ).  All reported trigger sounds were made 
by humans , and the  most com mon triggers  were related t o eating and breathing sounds. Other 
common triggers included clicking noises produced by keyboards or pens. All patients reported 
avoidance behaviors and daily stress or discomfort and anticipated exposure to triggers. The 
prevalence of com orbid psychiatric disorders was reported  as within expected ranges , except 
for a very high prevalence of obsessive- compulsive personality disorder  (OCPD) . Schröder et 
al. (2013) have suggested that misophonia could be considered as a distinct psychiatric 
condition.   
Wu et al.  (2014)  surveyed 483 undergraduates  from a pool of students taking psychology 
courses. Their  sample was predominately female and ranged in age from 18 to 54. Measures

  included The Misophonia Questionnaire , developed by the authors, measures of sensory 
defensiveness, self -report of disability, obsessive- compulsive symptoms, and rage. This group 
report ed that  nearly 20%  of their sample had clinically significant misophonia symptoms that 
caused  interference in their lives . Wu et al. (2014)  reported correlations between misophonia 
and impairment  in a function in multiple domains including school/work and home life. They  
also found a strong correlation between misophonia and general sensory sensitivities  and 
moderate correlations between misophonia and  obsessive -compulsive symptoms, anxiety , and 
depression. Anxiety was found to be a significant mediator between misophonia and rage. In 
their study, t he most troubling sounds identified were people eating, nasal sounds, and 
repetitive tapping  (Wu et al., 2014) . 
Edelstein et al. (2013)  interviewed 11 individuals recruited from a university campus , from 
contacts with their lab and from a  misophonia support group. In this cohort, the a ge of onset 
was typically in childhood, the most common trigger s we re eating sounds and low frequency 
bass sounds, and reactions to trigger sounds included  a range of negative emotional 
responses including anxiety, panic anger and rage. Edelstein et al . (2013)  then evaluated the 
skin conductance responses to stimuli ( YouTube videos and lab recorded stimuli ) in 6 of the 
original subjects  compared to 5 control subjects. The stimuli were selected based on interview 
data from the subjects with misophonia and included sounds expected to produce emotional 
responses. Misophonic subjects and controls similarly identified  stimuli  as aversive , but 
misophonic subjects showed greater skin conductance responses and greater reported subjective responses . Based on these findings,  Edelstein et al . (2013)  have argue d that 
response to stimuli in individuals with misophonia may represent a quantitative difference from 
normal neurological function.  
Taylor  et al. ( 2014)  surveyed  534 individuals who expressed an interest in clinical psychology. 
This group defined sensory intolerance as a combination of auditory and tactile sensitivity. 
Auditory intolerance was intolerance to sounds such as alarms, sirens, appliances, or 
background noises like people talking or ticking clocks , which is inconsistent with the 
description of typical trigger sounds in other studies ( Edelstein et al., 2013; Jasterboff & 
Jasterboff, 2014 ; Schröder et al., 2013). Taylor et al. (2014)  also evaluated tactile intolerance , 
which  had not previously  been reported as a form of sensory sensitivity characteristic of 
misophonia. Given th ese inconsistencies in definition of misophonia,  the phenomena described 
in the Taylor et al . (2014)  study may represent  a different class of  sensory experiences.

 Recently , Rouw &  Erfanian (2017)  collected survey data from over 300 people who self -
identified as having misophonia from Internet and Facebook sites focused on misophonia. 
They collected data on phenomenology including physical and emotional responses as well as effect on life an d comorbidity.  Their sample was predominately female , and most respondents  
reported onset of symptoms in childhood or teenage years.  All subjects reported some 
emotional response to triggers and most also reported a physical response.  Rouw & Erfanian 
(2017)  used the first 3 questions from the A -Miso -S time spent, interference, and distress 
associated with misophonic sounds  (Schröder et al. 2013) to assess impact on life. Half of their 
respondents reported comorbid psychopathology , with the most common comorbid diagnoses 
being tinnitus, post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) and ADD/ ADHD all reported by 12% of 
their sample. In another category , anxiety and depressive disorders were reported by 13%.  
Only PTSD was related to severity of misophonia symptoms  (Rouw & Erfanian, 2017) . 
Aims and Hypothesis  
The purpose of the  current  study was to confirm and extend the findings of previous, smaller 
studies , and address the impact on quality of life and the role of treatment  in people with 
misophonia.  This research focuses on sound triggers consistent with the most common 
descriptions of misophonia;  it does not include investigation of visual triggers or other forms of 
sensory intolerance. Data were collected to clarify the relationship between misophonia and psychopathology to understanding the conceptualization of misophonia as a distinct condition  
or as a symptom of an underlying disorder.  
The hypothesis was  that there would be a negative correlation between severity of misophonia 
symptoms and quality of life.

  study participants was 37.49 years ( SD = 12.24; range from 18 to 72). Over 52% had college 
level education or beyond.   
The survey was conducted on individuals recruited from social media and web sites focused on 
misophonia. Specifically, participants were recruited from a Yahoo group and Facebook groups 
focused on misophonia by messages posted inviting people with misophonia to compl ete the 
survey. No compensation was provided for participation, but participants were informed the 
survey would help researchers better understand the condition. Participants were asked to 
respond to an anonymous survey requiring them to be age 18 or older . Responses were 
recorded using Survey Monkey. Answers to questions could be skipped, except for the 
agreement to informed consent and age. Therefore, the number of respondents to each 
question varied.  
Procedure  
Data were collected on characteristics of individuals who self -identified as suffering from 
misophonia, including quality of life, psychiatric comorbidity, typical triggers, symptom severity, 
coping responses, and treatment experiences and effects.  
The su rvey consisted of 23 questions in various formats. Questions included demographic 
information  age, sex and level of education, quality o f life, psychiatric  comorbidity, and 
description of misophonia phenomenology , severity , and treatment experience.   Quali ty of life 
was assessed using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, short form 
(Q-LES- Q-SF; Endicott  et al. , 1993 ). This scale, in either short or long forms, is extensively 
used in psychiatric research. The social relationship item was inadvertently omitted from the survey form.  To assess comorbidity, respondents were asked to check any disorder they had been diagnosed with or believed they had from a list of 12 possible choices , and/or to indicate 
other diagnoses ( see Table 7 for a list of categories). Several of the items on the comorbidity 
list were selected from the obsessive- compulsiv e spectrum, as symptoms of misophonia have 
been associated with obsessive- compulsive symptoms and related phenomenon ( Ferreira et 
al., 2013;  Schröder et al., 2013 ). Tinnitus was inc luded in the comorbidity list as high rates of 
this comorbidity have been reported ( Jasterboff & Jasterboff, 2014 ).  
Trigger sounds were assessed by asking respondents to indicate if they responded by 
becoming upset, anxious, angry, or disgusted, to a list of eight categories of soft sounds , and to

 Examples of items on this list include mouth sounds such as chewing or crunching, joint 
sounds such as knuckle cracking and foot sounds such as tapping. Categories of triggers were developed from a review of the literature and experience working with individuals with identified misophonia complaints.  Age of onse t was assessed by asking ‘ at what age did you first 
experience this reaction to sounds ’. Physical responses (see Table 3) were assessed from a 
list of five categories based on published literature and clinical experience . Respondents could 
select multiple responses, with “ other” category for w rite-in responses .  
Misophonia severity was assessed with the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale ( A-MISO -S; 
Schröder  et al., 2013 ; Table 4). Research on misophonia has yet to establish well -supported 
measures. The A -Miso -S, adapted by Schröder et al. (2013) from the Yale- Brown Obsessive-
Compulsive scale ( Y-BOCS;  Goodman  et al.,  1989) , appears promising, and like the Y -BOCS it 
is adaptable to self -repor t or clinician administration. The level of physical discomfort when 
exposed to triggers  was assessed with the Misophonia Physical Sensation Scale ( see Table 4 ).  
Respondents  were asked to  check the response that best described their reaction.  Possible 
responses ranged from feeling no physical response to feeling a physical response which is 
overpo wering and is causing physical pain.  
Possible treatments sought were listed using vernacular terms such as counseling/ talk therapy , 
cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT) and exposure therapy . The list of treatments was designed 
to identify treatments people believed they  had experienced,  and technical definitions of 
treatment approaches were not provided or asked about . This question instructed respondents 
to check all that apply and had a fil l in other response.  Exposure therapy, which may be 
included as a component  of CBT, was listed separately bec ause exposure to trigger stimuli  has 
been reported anecdotally and in the literature ( Schröder  et al.,  2017)  to be associated with 
increased misophonia severity.  The effects of treatment on misophonia severity and quality of 
life were assessed using a 7 -step Likert scale from greatl y improved to greatly worsened.  
Descriptive statistics and bivariate tests ( t-test, chi -square test, and correlation) were used to 
demonstrate sample demographics and all study measures, with calculated effect size 
estimates. Ordered logistic r egression analysis was conducted with the treatments for 
misophonia as the independent variable s and the change of misophonia conditions as the 
dependent variable.

  Results  
Chi-square test was performed to compare the distribution of age of onset between female s 
and males. The results indicated no significant association between sex and age of onset  χ2(7, 
N = 1,061 ) = 10.93 , p = .14, V = 0.10. The average yearly rate of onset  was calculated as the 
number of participants reporting onset for a year divided by the number of participants that age 
or older.  Figure 1  shows the average yearly rate of  onset for various age ranges. The age 
ranges were chosen to reduce a self -report artifact, where participants were far more likely to 
report onset of a multiple of 5 in adulthood (e.g. 25, 30) and twice as likely t o report onset of a 
multiple of 2 in the 7 to 13 age range  (e.g. 8, 10, 12) . The average age of reported onset was 
12.61 years ( SD = 7.46; range = 0 to 50), and the median age of onset was 11 years.

Misophonia severity was assessed using the A -Miso -S (Schröder  et al., 2013), which was 
adapted from a tool used to measure the severity of OCD, the Y -BOCS ( Goodman et al., 
1989). Similar adaptations of the Y -BOCS have been developed for other obsessive 
compulsive or impulse control disorders and appear to be valid and reliable measures ( Pallanti 
et al.,  2005;  Philips  et al.,  1997 ). 
The A -Miso -S produced  scores ranging from 0 to 24. Scores of 0– 4 are considered subclinical, 
5–9 mild, 10– 14 moderate, 15– 19 severe, and 20– 24 extreme ( Schröder  et al., 2013 ). The A -

 Miso -S scores in this sample ranged from 2 to 24 with a mean of 12.93 ( SD = 3.66), which was 
considered to be moderate (See Table 1). Additionally, most participants ( n = 528, 51.4%) fell 
in the moderate range  (See Figure 2 ). The results of t-test and chi -square test indicated that 
both the mean and distribution of misophonia severity were not significantly different between 
males ( M = 12.58, SD = 3.63) and females ( M = 13.00, SD = 3.67), t(1,025) = 1.40, p = .16, d = 
0.11;  χ2(4, N = 1,061) = 7.40, p =.12, V = 0.08.  However, an earlier age of onset was 
significantly associated with a greater level of misophonia r (1,007) = –.21, p < .001.

  Table 2  shows sounds that trigger misophonia and the A -Miso -S scores for participants who 
experienced emotional distress by par ticular sounds . Participants indicated they had 
experienced significant emotional distress in  reaction to sounds, including anxiety, disgust, and 
anger. The most common trigger sounds were mouth sounds ( n = 1,024, 96.5%) and breathing 
sounds ( n = 884, 83.3%). Common responses in the Other Sounds  category included  animal 
sounds ( n = 45, 4.2%), bass or sound through walls ( n = 40, 3.8%), whispering/accents/voice 
characteristics ( n = 36, 3.4%), and whistling ( n = 35, 3.3%). There were many unique 
responses in this category , such as pencils on paper, card shuffling, bells, items rolling in a car, 
hiccupping, fire crackling, fast talking at the end of a car commercial,  accordion music, and 
bagpipes.  The correlations between emotional distress from sounds (yes/no) and misophonia 
severity (as assessed by A -Miso -S) were positive and statistically significant ( See Table 2). 
The correlation for mouth sounds was not significant because almost all participants, 
regardless of their severity level, reported that mouth sounds trigger misophonia.

 Table 3 shows physical reactions to misophonia triggers  and the A -Miso -S scores for 
participants who reported particular reactions . Most participants  reported one or more physical 
reaction(s) to trigger sounds  (n = 1,038, 97.8%). The most common reactions were facial or 
body responses , indicat ing that  the person is upset or annoyed (n = 912, 86.0%) or has  muscle 
tension (n = 879, 8 2.9%). The participants were also asked to specify other physical reactions 
not listed in the survey question. This “other” category  included 94 responses that are either 
considered coping behaviors  (e.g. put on headphones) , emotions (e.g. anger ) or no t a physical 
reaction (e.g. not able to concentrate) . These responses  were excluded from the data reported 
in Table 3 . The remaining 193 “other”  responses (18.2%) are shown below.  The correlations 
between physic al reactions (yes/no) and misophonia severity (as assessed by A -Miso -S) were 
all positive and statistically significant ( See Table 3), indicating that participants with greater 
severity were more likely to physically react to trigger sounds.

For the items listed  in Table 4, the participants  rated the level of physical discomfort when they 
hear trigger sounds  on an 11- point Likert scale ranging from , “no physical sensation, ” to, 
“overpowering physical sensation that causes pain.” Most participants  (n = 1,020, 9 7.1%) 
described some physical sensations when exposed to trigger sounds. The correlation between 
physical discomfort and misophonia severity (as assessed by A -Miso -S) was positive r(1,015) 
= .51, p < .001 , indicating that participants with greater severity felt greater discomfort in 
response to trigger sounds.

Figure 3. The Effect of Treatment for Misophonia on Severity and Quality o f Life, n = 271.  
Ordered logistic r egression analysis was conducted to identify the treatments that  have 
significant effects on misophonia symptoms, ranging from “ greatly improved” to “ greatly 
worsened”  (See Table 6) . The “medication for anxiety or depression”  response  under the 
“other” category was included as a distinct treatment into  the regression model . The results 
from ordered logistic regression analysis (Likelihood- ratio χ2 (11) = 38.86, p  < .001; 
McFadden's pseudo R2 = 0.06) suggested that counseling/talk therapy was significantly 
associated with worsening of misophonia symptoms ( b = 0.93; p  < .001), while medication for 
anxiety or depression was significantly related to improved misophonia symptoms ( b = –1.38; p 
<.001).

Discussion  
Misophonia is a newly recognized and little studied condition, but research on it has increased 
recently. This study confirms and extends findings from smaller studies  that indicated  
misophonia is associated with substantial comorbidity and reduced quality of life (Rouw & 
Erfanian,  2017;  Schröder et al., 2013 ; Wu et al., 2014 ). Over 97% of the current cohort  
reported a physical reaction to trigger sounds, indicating that a physical response is a central 
feature of misophonia.  Additionally, these data suggest i ndividuals who struggle with this 
condition may be unidentified or offered ineffective treatment.   
The study sample was recruited from social media sites focused on misophonia. This indicates 
that the respondents were already aware of the condition, and sufficiently interested in it to be

  actively seeking information or otherwise communicating about it. This self -selected group may 
have m ore severe complaints than individuals who have some misophonia symptoms but have 
not self-identified or sought help for the problem. The sample was predominately female (82%) 
and people under 40 , similar in sex and age to the cohort described by  Rouw & Erfanian 
(2017).  The age and sex may be influenced by sampling from social media sites , and  surveying 
the membership of  the Facebook Misophonia Support Group and  the Misophonia Treatment 
and Management group revealed a similar ratio of women to men.  However , the gap in female 
vs. male usage of social media is less than 10%  (Anderson, 2015 ), so the predominance of 
women in this study is far greater than can be attributed to sex differences i n social media use.  
In this study, 80% reported symptom onset by age 15 , and a majority with onset by age 11 , 
consistent with age of onset reported elsewhere (Dozier, 2015d;  Edelstein  et al. , 2013;  Rouw & 
Erfanian, 2017;  Schröder et al., 2013 ). However , 10% reported onset of misophonia at age 21 
or older, with a maximum of 50 years in this sample. Figure 1 illustrates that onset of 
misophonia occurs in adulthood at lower  rates , with a slowly declini ng rate of onset after age 
24. This is consistent with  the findings of  Rouw & Erfanian (2017) , who reported adult onset in 
9% of participants.  Onset of misophonia in adulthood has also been reported by other 
researchers ( Dozier 2015b;  Schröder et al., 2013) , and these occurrences may indicate that 
misophonia i s not a developmental disorder . Indeed, s everal researchers have proposed that 
misophonia develops through classical conditioning which could occur at any age (Dozier, 
2015b, 2015c,  2015d ; Dozier & Morrison, 2017;  Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014; Schröder et al., 
2013) . Misophonia can be viewed as a conditioned emotional response (CER) to the trigger 
stimuli ( Dozier  et al.,  2017; Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014 ; Schröder et al., 2013 ), or as a 
conditioned physical (muscle) response to the trigger stimuli and a CER to the combined 
sensation of the physical response and the trigger stimulus (Dozier, 2015b,  2015c,  2015d;  
Dozier & Morrison, 2017).  
This model proposes t hat a conditioned physical response elicited by the trigger stimulus is a 
critical feature of  misophonia.  Several case studies have shown a relationship between the 
muscle response to the trigger and muscles that were tensed when the trigger was hear d 
initially , which could be evidence of conditioning of a physical response to the trigger ( Dozier, 
2015b) . The reports of physical responses to triggers by participants in this study support the 
premise that misophonia includes a physical response (i.e. directly elicited muscle contraction) to a trigger stimulus. In the current  sample,  87% of participants reported that they feel a

 physical sensation when triggered, which ranged  from difficult to ignore to painful  (see Table 4)  
compared to 75% of the  Rouw and Erfanian (2017)  sample reporting this level of response .  
Many participants reported a physical response of muscle movement (jerking, flinching, or 
twitching) or an uncomfortable sensation in their chest or abdomen,  which may be evidence of 
a conditioned physical reflex response (see Table 3). The genital response reported by a small 
percentage of participants could also be a directly elicited physical reflex  (Dozier & Morrison, 
2017) . If the physical response is typically distressing and sometimes painful , then its 
connection to a negative emotional response in the form of a CER is a plausible mechanism for the condition. These data are consistent with the premise that misophonia is a condition where 
there is both an elicited physical response and an emotional response to a trigger stimulus. The existence of an immediate physical response to trigger stimuli could have important implications about the inherent nature of misophonia. Other responses, such as muscle 
tension, sweating, and increased heart rate reported by participants may be part of a general physiological distress response to extreme emotions ( Dozier, 2015b , 2015c;  Dozier et al., 
2017; Edelstein et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2013 ; Kumar et al., 2017).   
The participants in this study had substantially  lower levels of q uality of life compared  to the 
community norm  (Rapaport et al., 2005; Wyrwich et al., 2011 ; see Table 8).  Comorbid anxiety  
and mood disorders are associated with reduced quality of life score  (Barnes et al., 2012;  
Wyrwich et al., 2011) . The reduced quality of life in the current cohort may be attributed to 
misophonia, anxiety/depression, or both. In this sample, 81.4 % had quality of life scores below 
the mean of the community norm, and 56.3% were 10% or m ore below the norm mean. Quality 
of life scores more than 10% below the mean are consistent with at least some mild problems or difficulty in several areas of functioning ( Schechter et al., 2007). The reduced quality of life 
among the participants with misophonia and the negative correlation between misophonia 
severity and quality of life demonstrate the impact of this condition. Although misophonia is associated with a lower quality of life than reported for a community normative sample, the 
reduction in quality of life is less pronounced than that found in samples of individuals with 
major depressive disorder or PTSD reported by Rapaport, et al.  (2005 ) and included in Table 8.   
The A -MISO -S data describe a distribution of levels of severity , with most participants 
indicating moderate to severe misophonia. The reported combination of moderate to severe misophonia and corresponding impact on quality of life make this a potentially important condition.  The A -Miso -S severity correlates with reports of physical responses , which appears 
to be an important feat ure of misophonia. These relationships also support the value of the A -

  MISO -S as a severity measure and as having predictive validity. Physical discomfort is possibly 
related to a conditioned physical reflex included in one model of the disorder ( Dozier , 2015b).   
Severity was greater with the presence of trigger sounds other than mouth sounds . Mouth 
sounds  was not significantly related to severity due to the high occurrence (96.5%) of this 
trigger . This suggests that the more types of triggers a person has, the broader the effect and 
greater the misophonia severity .  This may also correspond to a history of generalization or 
exposure to new conditioning of triggers.  
Some sources have suggested misophonia is an OCD -related condition,  or on a putative OCD 
spectrum ( Ferreira et al., 2013;  Neal & Cavanna, 2013).  Wu et al . (2014 ) report ed a medium 
effect size for the relationships between misophonia symptoms and OCD , and a small effect 
size for depression.  Because the current findings on comorbid diagnoses are based on self -
report , and the survey question on comorbidity asked if participants  believed they had a 
diagnosable disorder , the accuracy of the comorbidity data may be questioned.  The occurrence 
of comorbidity  may also be exaggerated  because the questions asked for any lifetime 
diagnoses rather than current diagnoses.  Jastreboff & Jastreboff  (2014) noted  that many 
individuals with misophonia exhibit psychological problems, and that ps ychological disorders 
such as OCD may affect the negative reactions to sounds as well as susceptibility to 
developing misophonia.  However,  Jasterboff & Jasterboff (2014 ) also report ed that in their 
cumulative experience with hundreds of misophonia patients , only a few had psychiatric 
problems.  Multiple sources have argued that misophonia overlaps in some features  with three 
anxiety disorders (social phobia, OCD, and PTSD ) as well as with personality disorders  
(Ferreira et al., 2013 ; Schröder et al., 2013; Webber  et al. , 2014 ).  Rouw & Erfanian (2017)  
report ed the most common comorbid disorders in their sample are anxiety and depressive 
disorders (13%) and tinnitus, PTSD and ADD/ ADHD (12%). Their list of  diagnoses  included 
OCPD (8%) but not OCD. The current  sample reported similar rates of tinnitus (18.5), ADHD 
(13.1%) and PTSD (12.6%).  Schröder  et al. (2013) report ed 7.1% of their sample had mood 
disorders compared to 48.4 % in the current sample, and only 2.4% had OCD , compared to 
20.8% in this sample. Schröder et al. (2013 ) report ed 2.4% with panic disorder and no other

panic.  Lastly, Schröder et al. (2013)  report ed over half of their sample met criteria for OCPD. In 
this study, OCPD was not included in the list of possible comorbid disorders , and although  the 
survey a llowed for reporting of  other diagnoses , none of the participants  reported a diagnosis 
of OCPD. The large differences in comorbidity may be influenced by a number of factors. This

 study asked about disorders respondents believed they had , and did not distinguish between 
current and lifetime incidence. Rouw & Erfanian (2017)  asked if respondents had been 
diagnosed with any other psychiatric conditions and had a check list and other category of 
responses. Schröder et al. (2013) assessed subjects with a psychiatric interview, structured 
interviews and scales to assess anxiety and depression,  and a symptom checklist to identify 
current diagnoses , and concluded that there were  critical differences between each disorder 
and misophonia. The current data lend further support to the identification of misophonia as a 
distinct condition.  The relationship between misophonia and other disorders needs to be 
studied further.  
Notably,  the results in the current study showed that most participants  had not received 
treatment for their misophonia (see Table 5 ). Of those who did, the results were generally 
disappointing, with 57% reporting no improvement and 7 % reporting worsening. The most 
frequently reported treatment w as counseling or talk therapy , which was associated with a 
worsening of symptoms  (see Table 6 ). Some comments suggested that therapists typically had 
no concrete suggestions, ignored the concern , or attributed it to another problem. Because  
there is not an official recognition of misophonia in the DSM -5 or ICD -10 at this time , therapists 
may think it needs to be conceptualized as a symptom of another disorder.  Cavanna (2014)  
argued  there is a dangerous trend to mix symptoms, syndromes, disorders , and illnesses as if 
they had the same diagnostic importance. Since irritability is a central feature of misophonia,  it 
may be that therapists conceptualiz e it as a feature of a mood or anxi ety disorder , which were 
the two most commonly reported comorbid diagnos tic categories  and are often associated with 
irritability . Unfortunately , this practice  may lead to providing treatment that is directed at 
another disorder rather than  address ing the primary complaint . People in this study who 
reported treatment with medications for anxiety or depression also reported some improvement 
of misophonia  symptoms. One plausible explanation is that treatment for anxiety or depression 
improved the overall well -being of these individuals, and thereby lessened misophonic severity.  
Of respondents who sought treatment, some (~33%) reported a positive effect on  both 
misophonia and quality of life, though most reported only a slight improvement (see Figure 3 ).  
Only 12% reported moderate or better improvement in misophonia symptoms.  In contrast, 
Schröder et al. (2017)  reported an open trial of CBT for misophonia. Using a protocol designed 
for misophonia they found 48% of the patients showed a clinically significant reduction in 
misophonia symptoms.  That finding, and the 12% in this study who reported  that treatment 
resul ted in moderate or better improvement , are evidence of the potential of therapy to address

  misophonia. This  underscores the need for further research on misophonia and treatment 
methods to understand how it can be treated effectively , and provides some evi dence that 
misophonia does not have to be a life- long debilitating condition.  
Additional research on misophonia is warranted due to the negative impact of this condition on 
individuals, the apparent prevalence, and the limited body of knowledge. Researc h should be 
conducted in three areas. First ly, there is a need for r esearch that will increase understanding 
of the fundamental nature of the misophonic response  and the  underlying mechanism of 
misophonia. Specifically, does misophonia include an immediate physical reflex r esponse to 
the trigger stimulus , and what is the relationship between the trigger, physical reflex, and 
emotional response?  Secondly , the current study indicates that a relatively small percentage of 
individuals with misophonia have experienced a large reduction in misophonia severity with 
treatment. A better understanding of treatments for misophonia and factors that contribute t o a 
positive treatment effect  are needed. Several cases studies  and one open trial  have reported 
successful treat ment of misophonia, but controlled treatment trials are needed along with 
research into factors that influence response to treatment . Finally, there is a need for 
fundamental research in classical conditioning mechanisms that could allow a misophonic  
response to  be initiate d and maintained, including investigation of conditioning with stimulus -
response pair ing as proposed by Donahoe & Vegas (2004).  
Limitations  
Participants in this study were recruited from internet gr oups about misophonia, and therefore 
were likely to be individuals who currently suffer from this condition . Over 80% of the 
participants  were women, which may reflect influence  of sampling from social media and 
specifically Facebook misophonia groups . There are no well -validated questionnaires  to assess 
misophonia phenomenology and severity . Limited conclusions can be drawn about the 
effective interventions. I ndividuals whose symptoms have  subsided may be less likely to 
continue participating  in social media groups. This creates a form of self -selection bias where 
participants who have experienced effective treatments may not have been  sampled. B ecause 
multiple treatments were reported with only a single outcome response, information about the 
effect of individual treatments is limited to conclusions  derived from regression analysis.  
Comorbidity data reflect self -report of lifetime diagnoses and  may not indicate present 
comorbidity. Self-report survey  responses may be less reliable than data  derived from 
structured clinical interviews .

 Conclusion  
Misophonia is a newly recognized and understudied condition. Misophonia typically develops 
early in life  but may develop in adulthood.  Typical presentations include emotional distress and 
noticeable physical reactions to triggers .  Severity is correlated with the severity of physical 
reactions and increased severity is associated with a greater range of triggering sounds.  
Mouth sounds are extrem ely common, but not universal, with 3.5% of participants not reporting 
mouth sound triggers.  Emotional reactions seen in misophonia are typically dysphoric.  
Reactions to the sounds are associated with behaviors that are likely to have an adverse 
impact on interpersonal relationships  and task performance . Misophonia is associated with 
substantial comorbidity  and reduced quality of life . Misophonia has been conceptualized as 
related to or a variation of other disorders such as OCD, however comorbi dity data suggest it is 
a separate condition. Assessment of misophonia is not yet standardized but the A -MISO -S and 
checklists of trigger sounds and reactions appear to be of value and merit further study. Little is 
known about treatment and most people who st ruggle with this condition may be unidentified or 
offered ineffective treatment. Given that the condition may be common and may have important 
impact on quality of life and daily function,  further research should be encouraged.
