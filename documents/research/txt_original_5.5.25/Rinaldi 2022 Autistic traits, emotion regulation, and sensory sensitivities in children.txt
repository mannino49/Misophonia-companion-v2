## Abstract

Misophonia is an unusually strong aversion to everyday sounds such as chewing, crunching, or breathing. Previous studies have suggested that rates of autism might be elevated in misophonia, and here we examine this claim in detail. We present a comprehensive review of the relevant literature, and two empirical studies examining children and adults with misophonia. We tested 142 children and 379 adults for traits associated with autism (i.e., attention-to-detail, attention-switching, social processing, communication, imagination, emotion regulation, and sensory sensitivity across multiple domains). Our data show that autistic traits are indeed elevated in misophonics compared to controls. We discuss our findings in relation to models of the interface between autism, sensory sensitivities, and the specific features of misophonia.

Misophonia is a condition characterised by unusually strong aversions to everyday sounds, such as chewing, crunching, or breathing. Aversive sounds are not particularly loud, and tend to be human bodily sounds from the mouth and nose, but can also be other noises such as repetitive tapping or clicking. Although most people can easily ignore these sounds, people with misophonia experience strong emotional reactions such as anger, disgust, panic and rage, often accompanied by an autonomic response (e.g., increased heart rate; (Dozier et al., 2017; Swedo et al., 2022). Misophonia can be profoundly detrimental to daily life, negatively impacting on family dynamics, school and work-life (Wu et al., 2014). In this study we investigate what traits might contribute to the profile of people with misophonia, looking par -ticularly at traits typically associated with autism. Our aim is to establish whether people with misophonia (henceforth misophonics)  show  unusual  profiles  beyond  sound  aver -sions  themselves.  Such  data  can  provide  valuable  insight into potential underlying mechanisms for the condition. We begin with a brief introduction to misophonia, then describe previous  investigations  linked  to  autism,  and  theoretical arguments for why autism may be an area of interest for researchers  of  misophonia.  We  then  present  two  studies testing both adults and children with misophonia, to better understand how autism and autistic traits might play a role in the emergence of misophonia.

Misophonia tends to develop in childhood or adolescence (Rouw &amp; Erfanian, 2018) but can also appear (or intensify) in  later  life  (Cavanna  &amp;  Seri,  2015).  The  condition  was first  recognised  two  decades  ago  (Jastreboff  &amp;  Jastreboff, 2001), and a growing body of research has shed new light on its  phenomenology and related characteristics. Several studies have shown differences in people with misophonia beyond  sound-sensitivities  themselves,  including  traits  of perfectionism,  depression,  anxiety  sensitivity,  and  obsessive  compulsive  disorder  (Cusack  et  al.,  2018;  Eijsker  et al., 2019 ; Jager et al., 2020). Importantly, a number of these traits  are  known  co-morbidities  in  autism  spectrum  conditions  (henceforth  autism;  Greenaway  &amp;  Howlin  2010; Meier  et  al.,  2015).  And  indeed,  over-responsiveness  to auditory stimuli is itself a feature of autism ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ; American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Importantly however, the nature of sound sensitivities in autism are often described as rather different to misophonia. Researchers of autism-linked sensi -tivities have tended to focus on sounds that are loud, or high, or sudden/unexpected (e.g., (Robertson &amp; Simmons, 2013; Tavassoli  et  al.,  2014 )  and  this  is  notably  different  to  the sounds of misophonia (i.e., often gentle or ambient sounds

from specific categories, such as eating noises). As such, it is  still  unclear  whether  misophonia  overlaps  with  autism. One recent review has speculatively proposed that misophonia may potentially account for at least some portion of the sound intolerances found in autistic people (Williams et al., 2021). We therefore investigate these links empirically in the current paper, beginning with a review of how autism has been mentioned in misophonia literature to date.

There have been several case studies of individuals with both autism and misophonia (Haq et al., 2020; Webber et al., 2014) as well as several studies that have attempted to draw a  specific  link  between  misophonia and autism in a more direct  way.  Jager  et  al.,  ( 2020)  administered  the  Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) to 575 confirmed  misophonics.  This  widely-recognised  measure produces an overall score where 32 + suggests clinically significant levels of autistic traits. However, Jager et al. found no obvious links with autism: their misophonic participants had relatively typical AQ scores, and typical rates of autism for their country of testing (i.e., their mean AQ was 19.3, with 2.4% autism, and this can be compared to baselines of 16.4 and 1.4% respectively; Baron-Cohen et al., 2001b; van der Gaag 2018). Crucially, however, there were no controls, and  a  number  of  potential  misophonics  were  removed  a priori from their study, specifically if they showed evidence of autism. This makes it impossible to interpret autism/AQ data within this sample, because it has already been stripped of people with autism (Williams et al., 2021). In a second study, Claiborn et al., (2020) questioned 1061 self-declared misophonics and found that 38 (3.6%) reported autism. This figure is slightly higher than the comparable general popula -tion (e.g., 2.2% in the USA; Dietz et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2021) but we suggest the wording of their question may have inflated the estimate ( Have you been diagnosed with autism, or do you think you might have it ? [our emphasis]). Nonetheless, even if this figure were a reliable estimate of diagnosis, small numbers make it difficult to interpret comorbidity when dealing with rare conditions (autism) within rare conditions (misophonia). Hence any such attempt may be stymied from the outset.

There are, nonetheless, a number of reasons to suspect that  rates  of  autism  may  indeed  be  higher  in  misophonia. Williams et al., (2021) present a helpful review describing a number of studies and first-person accounts where sound intolerances  reported  by  autistic  people  appear  to  resonate  with  definitions  of  misophonia  (e.g.,  strong  negative emotional reactions from typical misophonia triggers such as chewing, breathing and snoring). But of course, people with  autism  might  experience  misophonia  at  rates  found elsewhere  in  the  population,  without  any  meaningful  comorbidity. Nonetheless, clues to whether we might expect a  link  with  autism  also  come  from  the  neurological  basis of misophonia. For people with misophonia, trigger-sounds are associated with increased activation in anterior insular cortex (Kumar et al., 2017; Schroder et al., 2019), within the brain's 'salience network' (Menon and Uddin, 2010; Uddin 2015). Kumar et al., (2017) also showed increased functional connectivity within the anterior insula during the presentation of misophonic triggers, particularly between the insula and  ventromedial  prefrontal  cortex,  posteromedial  cortex, hippocampus and amygdala; i.e.,  limbic  regions  involved in  emotional processing and regulation. This involvement of  the  limbic  system  and  'salience  network'  suggests  that sounds  may  be  particularly  salient  and  emotionally  laden for  people  with  misophonia.Williams  et  al.,  (2021)  have interpreted  these  neuroimaging  findings  in  the  context  of autism. The  insula  and  salience  network  have  been  especially  implicated in the pathology of autism (Nomi et al., 2019; Uddin, 2015), so Williams et al. hypothesise that such differences in the insula may also potentially increase rates of misophonia in autistic people. They also point out that increased  resting-state  connectivity  between  the  salience network and amygdala has been suggested in other cases of sensory problems in children with autism (Green et al., 2016; Green &amp; Wood, 2019).

Here we  investigate this hypothesis directly, seeking  empirical  evidence  linking  autism  and  misophonia  in samples of adults and children. We will administer the AQ questionnaire  to  both  adults  and  children  (these  latter  via the  parent-completed  version;  Baron-Cohen  et  al.,  2006). If  there  is  a  meaningful  underlying  co-morbidity between misophonia and autism, we predict stronger autistic traits in adults with misophonia, with this difference potentially evi -dent already in children. A small number of previous studies of misophonia have already suggested there may be at least one trait linked with autism, which is heightened attentionto-detail, i.e., the ability to allocate cognitive resources to all  details  of  a  task  or  environment,  no  matter  how  small (Young et al., 1989). For example, one study of auditoryevoked  potentials  found  attentional  differences  between misophonics and controls in their N1 peak, a feature linked to  early  attentional  processing  (Näätänen,  1992;  Rinne  et al., 2006). Another study using the 'stop signal task' (which measures response inhibition) suggested that misophonics employed more attentional resources than controls (Eijsker et al., 2019). Finally, in our own earlier study, adults with misophonia were given the Attention-to-Detail subscale of the AQ, and produced significantly higher scores compared to controls without misophonia (Simner et al., 2022). In the current  study  we  will  administer  the  entire AQ,  to  examine whether misophonics score higher across all sub-scales linked to autism.

We will also investigate a second feature associated with autism,  which  is emotional  reactivity ,  a  trait  linked  with

emotion dysregulation .  Emotional reactivity refers to how we respond to any given situation in terms of our emotionrelated behaviours, affect and physiology. This trait varies among individuals, and can be measured according to our emotions'  intensity,  duration,  and  onset  (i.e.,  the  level  of stimulus needed to activate the emotion; e.g., Nock et al., 2008) Emotional reactivity is kept in check by our emotion regulation system, and failures in regulation (i.e., emotional dys regulation) can lead to high levels of emotional reactivity,  and  poorer  life  outcomes  (Grosse  Rueschkamp  et  al., 2018; Nock et al., 2008). Emotional reactivity in children has been linked to clinical conditions in later life (McLaughlin et al., 2010). Importantly, emotion dysregulation is also found in autism (Mazefsky et al., 2013) and more recently in  adults  with  misophonia.  Emotion  dysregulation,  which can  manifest  as  angry  outbursts  (Giesbrecht  et  al.,  2010) has  even  been  assumed  in  misophonia  simply  from  evidence of co-morbidities such as depression (Erfanian et al., 2018).  Recently,  Cassiello-Robbins  et  al.,  (2020)  showed that difficulties with emotion regulation are positively cor -related with symptoms of misophonia in adults, although it is unclear whether these effects reach back into childhood. Here, we take a direct approach in administering a targeted questionnaire to children with and without misophonia, tapping  into  the  three  components  of  emotion  dysregulation (i.e.,  using  the  Perth  Emotional  Reactivity  Scale,  PERS; Becerra et al., 2019) If emotional dysregulation is expected within populations higher in autistic traits, we predict that children with misophonia may score higher on direct tests, such as the PERS.

We also look at one final autism-related trait which is sen -sory sensitivity (Kern et al., 2007; Robertson &amp; Simmons, 2013; Watling et al., 2001). Sensory sensitivity is characterised  by  both  hyper-sensitivity/  sensory  overload  (e.g., finding  strong  smells  overwhelming  and  avoiding  them) and hypo-sensitivity/ sensory under-responsivity (e.g., failing to notice strong smells at all and actively seeking them out). Sensory sensitivities can occur in a number of different sense  domains  (e.g.,  visual,  auditory,  olfactory,  gustatory, tactile, vestibular, proprioceptive) and an obvious hypothesis is that people with misophonia may well be hyper-sensitive within the auditory domain. As noted above, measures of sensory sensitivity in autism often focus on sounds that are different to the trigger-sounds of misophonia (e.g., ask -ing about problems with the intensity, pitch or suddenness of  sounds;  e.g.,  Robertson  &amp;  Simmons  2013)  although  a small number of items might be interpreted as applying to misophonia more generically (e.g., finding certain sounds annoying). We therefore ask whether people with misophonia have autism-linked sensory hyper-sensitivity, and look not only at hearing, but also more broadly across multiple sense domains. Where sensitivities arise, they can present early in development (Ben-Sasson et al., 2010) and have a significant negative impact on children's lives (e.g., in eat -ing,  playing,  family  interactions;  Dunn  et  al.,  2016).  For all these reasons it is important to recognise whether broad sensory sensitivities are a feature of misophonia in children, and we seek to test this here.

In  summary,  we  propose  to  test  a  group  of  adults  and children with and without misophonia (whom we will identify  using  an  appropriate screener; see Methods). We will administer the AQ to adults and children, this latter via parents who will also receive the PERS to measure emotional reactivity (Becerra et al., 2019) and a parent version of the Glasgow  Sensory  Questionnaire  (Robertson  &amp;  Simmons, 2013) to  measure  sensory  sensitivities. We  predict  higher rates in all measures, and across both populations, if indeed misophonia is related to autism and to autistic traits.

## Experiment 1

## Methods

## Participants

We tested 126 misophonic adults (mean age = 30.32 years, SD   17.21;  92  female/  25  males/  5  non-binary/  4  pre-= ferred not to say) and 253 non-misophonic controls (mean age = 20.87 years, SD = 6.35; 199 female/ 47 male/ 3 nonbinary/  4  preferred  not  to  say).  We  recruited  participants from  a  long-list  of  self-declared  misophonics  (recruited via  online  forums  where  misophonia  is  discussed  e.g., Facebook, Reddit; Twitter) as well as a general population sample from the University of Sussex community. All participants were screened for misophonia (see below). Those exceeding the diagnostic threshold entered our misophonia group (whether from our self-declared misophonic stream, or  general  population  stream),  while  those  falling  below entered our control group. For added conservativeness, we entirely excluded any self-declared misophonic who did not pass the diagnostic threshold, along with participants with incomplete  data.  Ethical  approval  was  obtained  from  the local  university  ethics  board  prior  to  testing.  Participants took  part  without  monetary  incentive,  and  students  were offered course credit.

## Materials and Procedure

Participants completed our study online, using our in-house web  application  (www.misophonia-hub.org).  Participants were  sent  a  URL  via  email  to  take  part,  which  led  them directly to our testing page. Participants completed our two measures presented in the order described below (alongside

other tests to be reported elsewhere). Our task took 20 min to complete.

Sussex Misophonia Scale . This questionnaire is accessed via The  Misophonia  Hub (www.misophonia-hub.org)  an online multi-purposes site with resources and tests for people with misophonia. In Part 1 of the questionnaire, participants were asked to indicate whether they hate, or do not mind, a set of 48 misophonia trigger-sounds (e.g., chewing), broken down into eight categories (these categories being; the sound of people eating; the sound of repetitive tapping; the sound of rustling; throat sounds; mouth or nose sounds; voice sounds; background sounds; and also repetitive visual movements  --  since  these  latter  are  also  known  triggers of  misophonia; Brout et al., 2018). For any Yes response, this revealed a full list of triggers within that category. For example, if participants responded Yes to I hate the sound of people eating , this revealed check boxes for eight types of eating-sound ( crunchy foods; crispy snacks; chewing; lip smacking; swallowing; slurping; wet mouth sounds; other eating  sounds ).  In  Part  2  of  the  scale,  participants  were shown 39 statements about behaviours, emotions and outcomes from misophonia, introduced with the question: How often  do  these  things  happen  to  you? Examples  include: Hatred  of  some  sounds  make  me  feel  lonely (Item  18); I want to get pay-back on people who make certain sounds (Item 37); and I cover my ears to block out certain sounds (Item 28). Responses were given on a 5-point scale ( Never , Rarely , Sometimes , Often , Always ). The test has been used by several thousand misophonics to date, and its Receiver

Operator Characteristics show it to be an 'excellent' measure for identifying misophonia in adults (https://psyarxiv. com/5eb39/ see also Rinaldi, Ward, et al., 2022).

Autism  Spectrum  Quotient  (AQ). The  AQ  is  a  widely used  measure  for  identifying  autistic  traits  (Baron-Cohen et  al.,  2001).  The  full  questionnaire  consists  of  50  items divided  equally  into  five  subscales  measuring  different aspects of autism symptomology; i.e., communication (e.g., I frequently find that I don't know how to keep a conversa -tion  going ),  imagination  (e.g., When I'm reading a story, I  can  easily  imagine what the characters might look like ; reversed scored), social skills (e.g., I  find  it  hard  to  make new friends ), attention switching (e.g., I prefer to do things the same way over and over again ) and attention-to-detail (e.g., I tend to notice details that others do not ). Responses are given on a 4-point Likert scale ( Definitely agree ; Slightly agree , Slightly disagree , Definitely  disagree ) and  total scores range between 0 and 50, where higher total scores indicate stronger autistic traits (i.e., poorer attention-switching, imagination, communication, social skills, and greater attention-to-detail).  The  AQ  scale  has  been  used  widely within  the  autism  literature  and  has  been  shown  to  have acceptable internal consistency varying from α = 0.63 -0.78 (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001; Kurita et al., 2005). The 10 items within  the Attention-to-Detail  subscale  have  already  been administered to a population which overlaps in part with our participant-sample used here, for a paper exploring attentional influences in misophonia (Simner et al., 2022). Nonetheless,  data  from  this  sub-scale  are  included  here  as  one

Fig. 1 Means plot showing differences between misophonics (shown in triangle) and controls (shown in circles) in each of the AQ subscales from left to right: Social skills, Attention switching, Attention to detail, Communication, and Imagination. Higher scores indicate greater autistic traits

aspect of the different question of autism symptomatology, but we point out that any findings in the Attention sub-scale should not be taken as a replication of this earlier paper.

## Results

After using the SMS to separate our sample into misophonics and controls (see Participants ) we then examined scores on the AQ. Within the AQ, scores range between 0 and 50, where  higher  score  indicated  greater  attention-to-detail. We followed Baron-Cohen et al., (2001) in scoring 1 point for  responses  of  'Slightly/Definitely  agree'  to  positively worded  items  and  'Slightly/Definitely  disagree'  to  nega -tively worded items. The overall score for adults with misophonia was 24.74 (SD 8.12) compared to 17.29 (SD 6.62) for  controls. We explored these AQ data in a 2 × 5  mixed ANOVA  crossing  group  (misophonics  vs.  controls)  with subscale ( Attention to detail, Attention switching, Imagination. Social skills, Communication ). We found a main effect of group (  (1, 377) f = 91.48, p &lt; .001), a less interesting main effect of sub-scale ( f (3.38, 1273.31) = 111.10, p &lt; .001; since scores  are  generally  higher  for  some  sub-scales  over  others), and a significant interaction ( f (3.38, 1273.31) = 10.04, p &lt; .001) 1 . We explored this interaction using estimated marginal means post-hoc tests which showed that misophonics have a more autistic like profile across all subscales of the AQ (all t-values falling between -4.04 and -10.58, and all corrected p' s &lt; .001; see Fig. 1 ) but with largest effect size for  Social  Skills. All  effect  sizes  were  moderate  or  large (Cohen's d for  each  sub-scale  was:  imagination d = 0.50, attention  to  detail d = 0.51,  attention  switching d = 0.51, communication d = 0.72, social skills d = 0.98).

Since scores on the AQ of 32 + are  indicative  of  possible presence of autism, we therefore additionally explored whether significantly more misophonics passed this thresh -old than controls. We found 27 misophonics (21.4%) scored 32 or above compared to only 7 controls (2.8%), and this difference was highly significant ( χ2 (1) = 33.62, p &lt; .001).

## Discussion

We found that a large group of adults with verified misopho -nia also showed significant differences compared to controls in their autistic traits. Data showed that their scores on the

1 Our entire sample were 77% female, as is often the case in selfreferred  cohorts  (Dindia  &amp;  Allen,  1992).  However  there  were  no gender  differences  across  groups  ( χ2 = 0.98, p = .32).  And  when  we repeated our analyses with gender as a covariate we found no differ -ence  in  any  pattern  of  results  (i.e.,  same  main  effects  of  group  and subscale, and interaction between group and subscale, at ps &lt; .001).

AQ were significantly higher, with differences maintained across all five sub-scales, meaning that people with miso -phonia showed similar traits to people with autism in having  poorer  communication,  social  skills,  imagination  and attention-switching, but greater attention-to-detail. Largely overlapping  data  from  the  sub-scale  of  attention-to-detail had  been  presented  elsewhere  (Simner  et  al.,  2022),  but this  is  the  first  evidence  of  an  overall  scale  differences  in autistic traits across all five sub-scales. We also found that 21.4% of people with misophonia reached the clinically significant threshold (scoring 32 + ), compared to just 2.8% of controls. However, we might wish to consider that people with misophonia were recruited by self-referral from websites which might attract particularly strong cases. In other words, we may have found AQ differences by inadvertently recruiting  people  with  the  most  extreme  misophonia  (or indeed, individuals who are different in other ways, com -pared to our controls recruited from the student population for course credit). Hence to address this, we next looked at traits of autism in a group where misophonics and controls were recruited in exactly the same way. In Experiment 2, we screen a large sample of individuals for misophonia, rather than relying on self-referral. At the same time, we extend our investigation into children, to ask whether people with misophonia  are  already  showing  differences  in  autistic traits, at even a young age.

## Experiment 2

## Participants

We  tested  275  participants,  comprising  142  adolescents aged  10-14  years  (Mean  11.72  SD  1.12;  65  female,  77 male), along with 138 of their parents (116 female, 21 male, 1 prefer not to say) whose children had a mean age 11.72 (SD 1.13; 63 female, 75 male). There were more children than  adults  since  some  families  ended  testing  after  the child-measures but before the adult-measures. We therefore included  these  families  in  our  analyses  for  child-measure only (and we indicate in our Results the numbers of participants within each parent-measure). Our adolescent participants will form the basis of our two groups (misophonics vs.  controls),  which  are  to  be  separated  during  our  study using a validated adolescent misophonia questionnaire. (see Materials and Procedure ).

Our young participants were recruits of the Multisense project (e.g., Rinaldi et al., 2020) a large-scale study focussing on multiple aspects of childhood development, where uptake was 99% of Years 2-5 from 22 junior schools in the south of England, targeted in 2016. The original cohort represented over three thousand children in the initial recruitment wave. The 142 children in our current study were a

sub-set of those whose parents had agreed to stay in touch for future screening , and they were tested for the current 2 study four years after initial recruitment. Testing took place between November 2020 and March 2021, and (parent) participants were entered into a £100 prize draw.

## Materials and Procedure

Participants  completed  our  study  remotely,  using  our  inhouse web application (www.misophonia-hub.org). Parent participants were sent a URL via email to take part, and this led them directly into our testing page. Our testing battery included the four measures below (alongside other tests to be reported elsewhere). The first two measures were com -pleted  by  children,  taking  approximately  15  min,  and  the last two measures were completed by their parents, taking 15 min.

SMS-A: Sussex Misophonia Scale for Adolescents ( Rinaldi  et  al.,  2022).  This  child-completed  questionnaire  is almost identical to the adult measure described in Experiment 1, with only a single-word difference, substituting the word 'work' for 'school' in four items (Q12, Q14, Q22, Q31). For example, Item 12 now read as: I don't do well at school because of distractions from sounds . This only very minor change was possible because the scale was originally carefully devised to be adaptable for both adults and children, and has been validated in adolescents with convergent validity against measures of life-satisfaction, quality of life, anxiety,  and  obsessive  compulsive  traits  (Rinaldi  et  al., 2022).

Perth Emotional Reactivity Scale (PERS; Becerra et al., 2019). The PERS is a 30-item self-report questionnaire measuring the trait of emotional reactivity, as defined by (David -son, 2010) and (Becerra &amp; Campitelli, 2013). Items measure the ease-of-activation, intensity, and duration of emotions, repeated  once  for  negative  emotions  (e.g.,  sadness)  and once for positive emotions (e.g., happiness). Responses are given on a 5-point scale from Very unlike me to Very like me ,

2 Our  sample  who participated here were representative of the the original  wave  across  a  range  of  well-being  metrics  taken  at  earlier  recruitment; i.e.,  no  different  in  positive  affect  ( t (141.95) = 0.70, p = .49), negative affect ( t (141.86) = 1.70, p = .09; PANAS-C, (Laurent et  al.,  1999),  pro-social  behaviour,  emotional  symptoms,  conduct, hyperactivity or peer problems (i.e., no effect of group ( F (1,534) = 0.79, p = .374),  nor  interaction  ( F (3.21,  1712.16) = 0.53, p = .673;  Goodman, 2001)). Our sample were higher than the remainder in spelling ( (149.21) t = -6.04, p &lt; .001) and maths ( (113.88) t = -7.16, p &lt; .001) and this is perhaps to be expected from the children of parents who sign up for continued research (given the heritability of contentiousness and intelligence; Devlin et al., 1997; Luciano et al., 2006). The important point,  however, is that our entire sample for the current study were recruited  in  exactly  the  same  way,  and  we  look within this  subset, based on a screening for misophonia. In other words, our sampling is unrelated to our findings on misophonia.

where higher scores indicate higher reactivity (i.e., faster/ more easily  activated  emotions,  more  intense,  and  longer in their duration). Example items are: I  tend to get happy very easily (activation-positive emotions), When I am joyful, I tend to feel it very deeply (intensity-positive emotions), and It' s  hard for me to recover from frustration (durationnegative  emotions).  The  PERS  has  good  psychometric properties, with strong loadings of items on their intended factor, concurrent validity with other emotion measures, and good-to-excellent internal reliability (Becerra et al., 2019). Although this test has been used previously on adults, we conducted a linguistic analysis of its vocabulary using age of acquisition norms (Bird et al., 2001; Gilhooly &amp; Logie, 1980)  retrieved  via  the  N-Watch  psycholinguistics  tool (Davis, 2005). This analysis suggested that the vocabulary within this test make it appropriate for adolescents in our study,  having a mean age-of-acquisition of approximately 3 years 11 months, with an upper age of approximately 8 years 11 months (based on n66 of its 99 words, which were retrievable from N-Watch). We therefore administered this test to our participants, who were aged 10-14 years.

Autism Spectrum Quotient for Adolescents (AQ-Adolescent) .  The AQ-Adolescent (Baron-Cohen et al., 2006) has the same items and structure as the adult AQ described in Experiment 1, except that it is completed by a parent/carer, and all first person pronouns are replaced by third person pronouns (e.g., I → S/he [my child]). The AQ-adolescent has excellent test-retest reliability as well as face validity in showing that adolescents diagnosed with autism do indeed score higher than controls (Baron-Cohen et al., 2006).

The  Parent-completed  Glasgow  Sensory  Questionnaire (GSQ-P). The GSQ-P is parent version of the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ; Robertson &amp; Simmons 2013) to assess sensory sensitivities in children. It contains 24 items, covering  six  sense  domains  ( visual , auditory , gustatory , olfactory , tactile , vestibular ) with half of all items measuring Hyper-sensitivity (e.g.,  'Does your child ever hate the feeling or texture of certain foods in his/her mouth?') and half measuring hypo-sensitivity (e.g., 'Does your child ever complain of  having  a  weak  sense  of  taste?').  There  were five  possible  responses: Never,  Rarely,  Sometimes,  Often, Always . The  adult  measure  shows  excellent  reliability (α = 0.94; GSQ; Robertson &amp; Simmons 2013) and our parent  adaptation  ensured  all  items  were  suitable  for  parents (e.g., Do you → Does your child).

## Identifying Children with Misophonia

We applied the required threshold to identify children with misophonia, which were those scoring 49 or higher (out of 156) within the Sussex Misophonia Scale for Adolescents , taken  from  (Rinaldi  et  al.,  2022).  The  resultant  misophonia  group  comprised 15 children, including 9 girls (mean age 11.67, SD 1.32) and 6 boys (mean age 11.00, SD 0.89). The remaining 127 children were designated controls, and comprised 56 girls (mean age 11.67, SD 1.22) and 71 boys (mean age 11.83, SD 1.03). We then compared our groups in  the  remaining  measures  below,  where  we  give  participants  numbers  for  each  analysis.  We  ran  our  analyses  in R using the packages 'afex' for ANOVA, 'emmeans' for post-hoc estimated means tests, and 'tidyverse' for general data wrangling.

## Do children with misophonia show greater autismrelated traits compared to their peers?

AQ in a 2   5  mixed ANOVA crossing group (misophon-× ics  vs.  controls)  with  subscale  ( Attention  to  detail,  Attention switching, Imagination. Social skills, Communication ; see  Fig.  2 )  .We  again  found  a  main  effect  of  group  ( f (1, 120) = 5.05, p = .027), the less interesting main effect of subscale (  (3.16, 378.76) f = 15.48, p &lt; .001; see Experiment 1), and  no  interaction  (   (3.16,  378.76) f = 1.42, p = .234).  This suggests children with misophonia scored higher than controls across all sub-scales to a similar degree.

There were no significant differences across groups in the number of participants scoring in the clinically relevant zone of 32 + , although potentially due to small numbers (Fishers Exact p = .616 ). Two children with misophonia (out of 12) scored 32 or higher, compared to 11 controls (out of 110). This  would  represent  high  percentages  (12.5%  and  10% respectively)  perhaps  indicating  that  even  controls  in  this sample were unusually high in autistic traits. Nonetheless, this makes our target comparisons more, not less, conservative, since even within a sample with apparently higher rates of autistic traits, children with misophonia still stand out as being different to their peers.

We  first  looked  at  our  parent-report  measure  for  autistic traits  (AQ-Adolescent;  (Baron-Cohen  et  al.,  2006).  The overall score for children with misophonia was 25.00 (SD 1.30) compared to 18.78 (SD 8.85) for controls (based on 12 misophonics and 110 controls). We again explored the

We  examined  our  data  for  child-reported  differences  in the  PERS  (Becerra  et  al.,  2019).  Mean  scores  across  the

positive-emotion dimensions for children with misophonia were  48.91  (SD  11.92)  compared  to  controls  who  scored 52.07 (SD 11.14) (based on 12 misophonics and 116 controls). Across the negative-emotion dimensions mean scores for children with misophonia were 62.90 (SD 5.74) compared  to  controls  who  scored  41.27  (SD  12.80).  We explored these differences using a 2 × 2 × 3 ANOVA crossing  group  (misophonics,  controls)  with  valence  (positive, negative) and subscale (activation, intensity, duration; See Fig.  3 ).  We  found  a  main  effect  of  group  and  significant interactions between group and both valence and subscale, although we did not find a 3-way interaction, see Table 1. We ran post-hoc estimated marginal means tests to explore the interaction across group and valence (i.e., positive/negative  emotions),  and  found  that  misophonics  were  signifi -cantly higher than controls across negative scales ( (235) t = -5.86, p &lt; .001)  but were no different from controls across positive scales ( (235) t = -1.21, p = .229). We also explored the interaction between group and subscale (i.e., activation/ intensity/ duration) and found significant groupwise differ -ences for all subscales (i.e., misophonics higher than controls) with the subscales of activation and intensity showing the largest effect sizes (activation t (0.90) = -2.93, p = .004: intensity  (0.90) t = -4.39, p &lt; .001: duration  (0.90) t = -2.25, p = .026).

## Do children with misophonia show greater sensory sensitivities compared to their peers?

Finally, we looked at the parent-report measure for sensory sensitivities  (GSQ-Parent),  where  higher  scores  indicate greater  sensitivities.  The  overall  score  for  children  with misophonia was 22.62 (SD 18.65) compared to 15.39 (SD 11.09) for controls (based on 13 misophonics and 119 controls). Figure 4 shows this broken down across conditions.

Fig. 4 Means plot showing differences between misophonics (shown in triangle) and controls (shown in circles) in each of the GSQ subscales where - is shown for hypo-sensory sensitivities and + is shown for hyper-sensory sensitivities

We  explored  these  data  using  a  2 × 2 × 6  mixed  ANOVA crossing  group  (misophonics,  controls)  with  sensitivity (hypo-sensitive,  hyper-sensitive)  and  sense  (Visual, Auditory, Tactile. Gustatory, Olfactory, Vestibular). The outcome of this analysis is shown in Table 2, but can be summarised as follows. First, we found a main effect of sense, simply because  people  were  more  sensitive  in  some  senses  than others (e.g.,  the  tactile  sense  more  than  the  visual  sense). We also found a main effect of sensitivity (because people showed greater hyper-sensitivity  than  hypo-sensitivity)  as well as an interaction between these two factors (i.e., larger differences  between  hyper  and  hypo-sensitivity  in  some senses over others; cf. gustation vs. vestibular). Importantly however, we found a main effect of group -- since children with  misophonia  were  more  sensitive  than  controls.  We also  found  an  interaction  between  group  and  sensitivity. We explored this interaction with post-hoc estimated marginal  means  tests,  and  found  that  misophonics  were  significantly more hyper -sensitive than controls (misophonics Mean 2.16 vs. controls Mean 1.20) but they were no differ -ence to controls in hypo -sensitivities (hyper,   (195) t = 2.91, p = .004:  hypo, t (195) = -0.75, p = .453;  p  values  are  corrected). There was no significant three-way interaction (see Table 2), suggesting no evidence that this hyper-sensitivity of  misophonics was mediated by sense (i.e., misophonics were hyper-sensitive across all senses; see Fig. 4).

## Discussion

Our study examined whether adolescents with misophonia already show autism-related traits, similar to adults (Experiment 1). We found that children 10-14 years with misophonia scored higher in all sub-scales of the AQ, as well as in emotional reactivity to negative (but not positive) emotions, and  also  showed  greater  sensory  hyper-sensitivities,  both within the auditory domain, and more broadly across multiple senses. We discuss the interpretation of these findings

in combination with our adult data in the General Discussion below.

## General discussion

Our  studies  aimed  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  misophonia may be linked to autism in non-trivial ways. We found evidence that both adults and children with misophonia show greater autism-related traits, using the AQ measure (BaronCohen et al., 2001, 2006). Our previous study had shown elevated Attention-to-Detail in our adult sample (Simner et al., 2022), but here we show autistic tendencies across all five autistic subscales, including attention-switching, com -munication,  social  skills  and  imagination.  In  the  current study, we also found that this effect is already apparent in children with misophonia aged 10-14 years. We found, too, that these same children were demonstrating greater emotional  dysregulation/  reactivity  than  their  peers  (Becerra et al., 2019). These data suggest children with misophonia are faster to activate negative moods, feel negative moods more  intensely,  and  maintain  negative  moods  for  longer. These data are also compatible somewhat with adult find -ings (examining different aspects of emotion dysregulation; Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020) and now show that emotion dysregulation reaches back into childhood. Finally, children with misophonia also demonstrated greater sensory hypersensitivity (using a parent version of the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire; (Robertson &amp; Simmons, 2013) not only in the auditory domain, but also more widely across multiple senses.

To some extent it is no surprise to find sensory hypersensitivities in the same group where misophonia has been identified, at least in the auditory domain. The measure used here (i.e., the GSQ adapted for parents) contains two items on auditory hyper-sensitivities, one of which might loosely fit the definition of misophonia, at least in part ( Does your child  find  certain  noises/pitches  of  sound  annoying? )  and a second which characterises a more typical autistic sensitivity to sound ( Does your child dislike loud noises? )  and might signal the related condition of hyperacusis (in which loud noises can cause pain or 'fullness' in the ears; Baguley 2003; Baguley &amp; McFerran, 2011). Important here, however,  was  to  examine  whether  children  with  misophonia have  hyper-sensitivities  in  other  senses.  This  was  indeed the case: we found hypersensitivities across multiple sense domains (auditory, but also tactile, visual etc.) Also important was to establish whether auditory hyper-sensitivity in misophonia was paired with a co-occurring auditory hypo -sensitivities.  Studies  have  shown  moderate-to-large  relationship between hyper- and hypo-sensitivity, in that both hyper  and  hypo-sensitivities  can  cluster  within  a  single individual  (Sapey-Triomphe  et  al.,  2018).  Here  we  found misophonics showed evidence of higher hyper-sensitivities in multiple senses, but no difference in their hypo-sensitivi -ties compared to controls.

It  is  important  to  recognise  sensory  sensitivities  (and indeed other autism related traits),  and  to  recognise  them early, because they can have a significant impact on lives. Sensory  hyper-sensitivities  in  children,  for  example  are associated with higher levels of anxiety, shyness and more challenging  behaviours  (Dunn  et  al.,  2016).  Sensory  sensitivities have also been linked to dyspraxia (Buitendag &amp; Aronstam,  2010),  play  preferences  (Bundy  et  al.,  2007), compulsive-like  behaviour  (Dar  et  al.,  2012),  stereotyped movements (Gal et al., 2010) and feeding problems (Davis et al., 2013 ). Our findings suggest that understanding sen -sory  sensitivities  -  especially  as  they  arise  in  children  -might be a key focus for misophonia scientists.

Our findings of poorer emotion regulation might also be considered to mirror a core trait associated with misophonia:  that  negative  emotional  reactions  are  triggered  more readily, not only specifically in response to sounds, but also more generally in everyday life. It is likely that some of the same neurological underpinnings which cause unusual negative emotions in response to sounds (Kumar et al., 2017; Schröder et al., 2019) may also be at play in the emotion dysregulation  found  more  broadly  here.  Williams  et  al., (2021) has speculated a link between autism and misophonia  based  on  their  neurological  profiles.  As  in  misopho -nia,  the  insula  and  salience  network  have  been  especially implicated in autism (Nomi et al., 2019; Uddin, 2015), and indeed,  increased  resting-state  connectivity  between  the salience  network and amygdala has also been found with sensory  hyper-sensitivity  more  broadly  (in  children  with autism;  (Green  et  al.,  2016;  Green  &amp;  Wood,  2019).  Here we  investigated  this  hypothesis  directly,  findings  links between misophonia and both autism, and sensitivities. In summary, we found one or more differences across all mea -sures administered, and our hypotheses were supported by data from 126 adult and 15 child misophonics, and 391 controls. Although our sample size of child misophonics was small, it still yielded significant and meaningful effect sizes. Moreover, it represents the first ever sample derived from population screening, rather than clinic-referral, and so are particularly valuable in this regard.

Our findings, linking misophonia with autistic traits, are difficult to dismiss as recruitment biases, since although our adults were largely self-referred as misophonic, our children were not. And there were no differences in the recruitment methods between our misophonic and control children, suggesting that differences reside in their classification along the lines of misophonia. Importantly, our screening for misophonia was child-completed, while two of our other measures  were  parent-completed,  meaning  our  results  cannot

be dismissed as a response bias (e.g., an acquiescence bias) because our data come from different individuals rating the same child.  In  summary,  our  research  centred  around  the idea that dispositional differences might shed light on why people with misophonia find everyday sounds overly aver -sive. We found elevated autistic traits across all 5 subscales of  the AQ,  as  well  as  the  autism-related  traits  of  sensory sensitivity  and  emotion  dysregulation.  It  is  important  to note, however, that misophonia and autism are not equivalent. Only 27 of the 126 adults with misophonia in our study reached the clinically significant threshold for autism in the AQ (i.e., a score of 32 or higher). In other words, people with misophonia need not have autism, just as people with autism need not have misophonia. Nonetheless, it is important to recognise the link we have demonstrated between the two, especially where support can be offered, and perhaps most especially for children.
