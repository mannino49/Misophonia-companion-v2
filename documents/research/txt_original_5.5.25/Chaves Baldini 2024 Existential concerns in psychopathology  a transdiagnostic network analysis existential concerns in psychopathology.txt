ABSTRACT
Existential concerns, such as autonomy and identity, are often overlooked 
although they play an important role in psychopathology and clinical practice. 
The aims of this study are to investigate how existential concerns relate to 
psychopathological symptoms and to identify important existential concerns. 
This study used a cross-sectional quantitative design with a transdiagnostic 
sample. A mixed graphical model of 4 existential and 3 symptom domains with 
4 covariates was estimated in a sample of 996 individuals with various psychia -
tric disorders. Symptom nodes were derived from questionnaires on psycho -
pathological symptoms and existential nodes from questionnaires on 
transdiagnostic psychiatric dimensions and self-esteem. The centrality metric, 
expected influence, was calculated to determine nodes’ cumulative influence in 
the network. Existential concerns were related to worse psychopathology over -
all, but most strongly to depressive and anxiety symptoms. The strongest cross- 
domain relationship was between anxiety and recognition of psychiatric dis-
order. Of the existential concerns, autonomy and identity were the most central 
nodes in the network. Our results advocate the need to address existential 
concerns in clinical practice and research. Conveying individual responses to 
experiencing psychopathology, such as recognition of disorder, and supporting 
autonomy or positive identity formation may be areas for intervention.

Introduction
Existential concerns have psychological, medical, and philosophical signifi -
cance, but the increased focus on behavioral psychology and biomedical 
models over the past decades has largely ignored existential concerns in 
psychiatry (Koole et al., 2006 ). Existential psychology is derived from existen -
tialism and largely concerns itself with how people face and cope with the 
experience of human existence (Koole, 2010 ; Yalom, 1980 ). The existential 
dimension then can broadly refer to the way we relate to and reflect on our 
experiences and conflicts that may arise thereof (de Haan, 2017 ; Koole et al.,  
2006 ). The existential dimensions can also consist of spiritual, religious, and 
secular components (Hvidt et al., 2022 ; Whitley & Drake, 2010 ). According to 
existentialism-inspired psychology and psychotherapy, death, freedom, iso-
lation, identity, and meaning are the major overarching existential concerns 
that humans face, and it is posited that these concerns can have a significant 
impact on well-being (Greenberg et al., 2004 ; Yalom, 1980 ). Existential con-
cerns are complex to define, often encompass a wide range of themes, and 
can have intricate relationships with psychopathology. For instance, they can 
play a constitutive or modulatory role in or be an integral part of psycho -
pathology (de Haan, 2017 ). In this study, we are guided by the conceptualiza -
tions of existential concerns from existential psychology and therapy (e.g., 
Koole, 2010 ; Yalom, 1980 ).
Everyone contends with existential concerns to some degree, but more so 
individuals with psychiatric disorders who express feelings of loneliness and 
yearning for social connection and belonging, feeling a loss of dignity and 
self, fearing change and responsibility, needs for personal development, and 
searching for meaning (Damsgaard et al., 2021 ; Huguelet, 2014 ; Søberg et al.,  
2018 ; Wagner & King, 2005 ). Some individuals also report religiosity as an 
important component of existential concerns, such as faith contributing to 
meaning of life (Søberg et al., 2018 ). As such, one could argue that many if not 
all of the existential concerns are transdiagnostic constructs, meaning that 
they are not specific to a particular condition or psychiatric disorder. For 
example, death anxiety (Iverach et al., 2014 ), existential suffering (Yager,  
2021 ), and emptiness (Herron & Sani, 2022 ) have been shown to be trans -
diagnostic existential concerns related to many psychiatric conditions. Of the 
existential concerns identified by existential psychology, we focus on identity 
(e.g., the struggle of maintaining a clear sense of who one is while facing 
uncertainties surrounding self-perception), freedom (e.g., the experience of 
free will versus constraints and the responsibility of one’s choices), and 
isolation (e.g., the need for social connection versus experiences of rejection 
and feeling isolated in one’s subjective experience of reality) (Koole et al.,  
2006 ; Yalom, 1980 ). Individuals with psychiatric disorders often describe a loss 
of self and identity and of struggling with reconciling with their illness 2

identity (Kaite et al., 2015 ; Wisdom et al., 2008 ). While identity problems can 
be a risk factor for psychopathology (Persike et al., 2020 ), psychopathology 
can also impact identity as one may question if the psychiatric disorder is part 
of the self (de Haan, 2017 ). Additionally, a compromised or lack of autonomy 
(e.g., Bergamin et al., 2022 ; Hill & Pettit, 2013 ; van Bergen & Saharso, 2016 ) as 
well as social isolation and loneliness (e.g., Chou et al., 2011 ; Leigh-Hunt et al.,  
2017 ; Yalom, 1980 ) can be associated with psychopathology. Associated with 
a sense of will and responsibility, compromised autonomy can have conse -
quences on one’s ability to act in accordance with one’s goals or desires (Ryan 
& Deci, 2004 ). Threats to freedom and autonomy may often be considered 
external, but psychopathology can itself also be a barrier to autonomy 
(Bergamin et al., 2022 ). Lastly, social isolation can be both interpersonal and 
existential in a way that reflects a lack of social connections or worth therein 
but also a sense of feeling different from others, misunderstood, or alone in 
one’s experiences (Pinel et al., 2017 ). Connectedness is often considered 
necessary for mental health (e.g., Saeri et al., 2018 ), but connectedness 
could be hindered by psychopathology, such as through shame of having 
a psychiatric disorder (de Haan, 2017 ).
Given that psychopathology can itself be considered an existential experi -
ence and entails how patients “evaluatively relate to their disorder” (e.g., de 
Haan, 2017 ; Yalom, 1980 ), we also included the recognition of that experience 
as an existential concern. In this regard, recognizing a psychiatric disorder is 
different from experiencing or having a disorder. For instance, the recogni -
tion of a mental illness often causes extra stress and suffering since it 
compromises hope and positive outcome of mental well-being. Although 
there is no validated instrument or measurement of the experience of psy-
chopathology as an existential concern, capturing this aspect of the lived 
experience of patients with psychiatric symptoms remains important, espe -
cially as this study specifically aims to explore existential themes in 
a psychiatric population.
Studies that more directly investigate the interrelations between various 
existential concerns and symptoms are sparse but demonstrate that they are 
indeed related (Chawla et al., 2022 ; Kretschmer & Storm, 2018 ). It remains 
therefore necessary to further explore relationships between existential con-
cerns and symptoms and do so with a transdiagnostic approach. Depressive, 
anxious, and psychotic symptoms can be considered core symptom dimen -
sions, and they have been shown to be transdiagnostic in nature. For 
instance, anxiety and depression can occur in numerous disorders, such as 
misophonia (Quek et al., 2018 ), obsessive-compulsive disorder (Nestadt et al.,  
2001 ), and psychosis (Wilson et al., 2020 ), and psychotic symptoms have also 
been reported in non-psychotic disorders (Hanssen et al., 2003 ).
Individuals with psychiatric disorders have expressed that recovery 
and remission are more than the reduction of symptoms (Binder et al.,  COGENT MENTAL HEALTH
 3

2010 ; Zimmerman et al., 2006 ) and that existential concerns are as—or 
even more—important and urgent than symptom reduction (Kogstad 
et al., 2011 ; Wagner & King, 2005 ). Consequently, there has been renewed 
recognition that these concerns should be acknowledged and addressed 
as part of routine care (Koslander et al., 2009 ; Søberg et al., 2018 ; Ulland & 
DeMarinis, 2014 ) and that the existential dimension should be empha -
sized in the bio-psycho-social model (de Haan, 2017 ; Moore & Goldner- 
Vukov, 2009 ; van Os et al., 2019 ). Further understanding of the role of 
existential concerns in psychiatry and their relation with psychopatholo -
gical symptoms is therefore of importance. There remains however 
a dearth of quantitative research on the relationship between psycho -
pathology and existential concerns, especially in a transdiagnostic 
manner.
A network approach could be useful for investigating how these exis -
tential concerns and symptoms interrelate. This approach posits that psy-
chopathology manifests due to a complex interplay of symptoms and 
other clinically-relevant biopsychosocial factors, such as cognitions and 
daily functioning (Borsboom & Cramer, 2013 ), which is represented by 
a network of nodes (variables) and edges (relationships between nodes). 
Rather than treating symptoms as passive underlying indicators of a latent 
disorder with equal weight, the network approach conceptualizes symp -
toms as individual active agents that can have differential (causal) impacts 
on other symptoms and the overall psychopathology (Borsboom, 2008 ; 
Borsboom & Cramer, 2013 ). Coupled with the transdiagnostic approach, 
a network model can be expanded to not only include symptoms but also 
other elements relevant for psychopathology (McNally, 2021 ), which also 
aligns with going beyond just symptom reduction. Although cross- 
sectional network analyses do not allow for causal inference, they can 
elucidate numerous relationships between nodes in one model as well as 
nodes that are most central, or most strongly connected, in the network, 
and can be useful for hypothesis generation. In this case, we can examine 
which existential concerns are most influential in the network and how 
individual existential concerns interact with symptom dimensions within 
a network model.
The present study aims to explore cross-sectional relationships between 
existential concerns (i.e., autonomy, identity, recognition of psychiatric dis-
order, and social connection) and psychopathological symptoms (i.e., depres -
sive, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms) in a transdiagnostic sample of 
individuals with psychiatric disorders by estimating a network model of 
existential and symptom domains and performing centrality analysis to 
detect which variables are important within the network. Considering the 
agnostic and exploratory nature of the network approach, there were no 
hypotheses regarding specific relationships or centrality. It was however 4

generally expected that stronger existential concerns (e.g., lower autonomy) 
would be related to worse symptom severity (e.g., worse depressive 
symptoms).
Methods
Sample
The sample consists of 996 patients with psychiatric disorders recruited 
during intakes at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Psychiatry 
at the Amsterdam University Medical Centers (UMC), location Academic 
Medical Center (AMC), which is a public tertiary care medical institution. 
The Department of Psychiatry is an expertise center for anxious and 
obsessive-compulsive related disorders, depressive disorders, psychosis, 
and misophonia and offers a variety of evidenced-based and experi -
mental treatments (e.g., cognitive, behavioral, and trauma therapies, 
medication, electroconvulsive therapy, deep brain stimulation) as well 
as supplementary interventions (e.g., creative therapies, lifestyle inter -
ventions, and reintegration support). Inclusion criteria were: age 14–75  
years, ability to give informed consent, a DSM-IV-TR or DSM-5 diagnosis 
as determined by a trained psychiatrist, and fluent in Dutch. Exclusion 
criteria were: acute high risk of suicide (i.e., suicidal behavior requiring 
immediate and urgent attention), premorbid IQ < 70, history of seizure 
or clinically significant abnormality of the neurological system.
Procedure
The Across study is an ongoing, longitudinal research project that col-
lects data on cognitive functioning, psychopathology symptoms, and 
biological parameters. The full study and procedure are described in 
Nieman et al. (2020) . After an intake at the Department of Psychiatry, 
patients were invited to participate after being briefed about the study, 
and written informed consent was obtained from participants if they 
agreed to participate. Participants were able to participate at any point 
of their clinical trajectory (e.g., before, during, or after treatment); note 
that one-third to one-half of patients who have an intake at the 
Department of Psychiatry do not start treatment. Participants could 
discontinue participation from the study or parts of the study at any 
time.
The current study used data from baseline questionnaires on psycho -
pathological symptoms and other clinically-relevant factors, such as self- 
esteem. Questionnaires were administered on a computer during 
a research session, which took about 30 minutes to an hour to complete. COGENT MENTAL HEALTH

The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethical Review 
Committee of the Amsterdam UMC (no. NL55751.018.15), and data are 
stored according to European privacy laws.
Measures
At the time the Across study was designed, there was not a validated ques -
tionnaire that comprehensively covered different existential concerns. 
Therefore, items related to existential domains of identity, autonomy, recog -
nition of psychiatric disorder, and social functioning and connection were 
selected from the Psychiatric Dimensions Questionnaire and the Self-esteem 
Rating Scale- Short Form (SERS-SR) to create a limited inventory of existential 
concerns. Given that the authors have backgrounds in psychiatry and (clin -
ical) psychology, the existential concerns are based on the definitions from 
existential psychology and psychiatry, such as the “Big Five Existential 
Concerns” (Koole et al., 2006 ).The Psychiatric Dimensions Questionnaire 
assesses a variety of transdiagnostic concepts that are commonly affected 
in patients with a psychiatric disorder: affect, volition, identity, cognition, 
reality, and vitality (Nieman et al., 2020 , 2021 ). It was developed at the 
Amsterdam UMC (Nieman et al., 2021 ) and consists of 26 items. We specifi -
cally used items from the volition, identity, and vitality subscales to tap into 
themes on autonomy/freedom, identity, and recognition of disorder. The 
SERS-SR measures self-esteem in relation to self-worth, social competence, 
abilities, self-competence, and worth compared with others (Lecomte et al.,  
2006 ). It consists of 20 items that are rated on a scale from 0 (strongly 
disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). The SERS-SR demonstrates high internal 
consistency for the positive and negative scales (respectively, α = 0.91 and 
α = 0.87) and good test-retest reliability for each scale (respectively, r = 0.90 
and r = 0.91) (Lecomte et al., 2006 ). We specifically selected items relating to 
feeling accepted versus rejected and navigating interpersonal relationships 
to tap into the existential concern of isolation.
Psychopathological symptoms included in this study were assessed 
with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), the Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology Self-Report (IDS-SR 30), and Prodromal Questionnaire 16 
(PQ-16), which are validated and psychometrically-sound questionnaires. 
The HAM-A measures the severity of somatic, cognitive, and affective 
symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton, 1959 ). It consists of 13 items that are 
rated on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe). The HAM-A demon -
strates satisfactory interrater reliability and concurrent validity (Maier 
et al., 1988 ). The IDS-SR measures the severity of depressive symptoms 
pertaining to mood, cognition, arousal, suicidality, and sleep (Rush et al.,  
1986 ). It consists of 30 items that are rated on a scale from 0 (symptom is 
not present) to 3 (strongest impairment). The IDS-SR also demonstrates 6
 U. CHAVEZ-BALDINI ET AL.

good internal consistency (α = 0.85) and satisfactory psychometric prop -
erties (Rush et al., 1996 ). Because a number of items from the IDS- SR30 
and HAM-A overlap (e.g., both ask about depressed and anxious mood), 
total scores of the shortened versions which focus on core symptoms of 
each domain were used to avoid multicollinearity: Quick IDS-SR (QIDS-SR 
-16; Rush et al., 2003 ) and HAM-A 6 (Bech, 2012 ). Both the QIDS-SR (Rush 
et al., 2003 ) HAM- A6 (Bech, 2011 ) also demonstrate satisfactory psycho -
metric properties. The PQ-16 assesses the occurrence and severity of At 
Risk Mental State symptoms for a first psychosis (Ising et al., 2012 ). It 
consists of 16 items (2 negative symptoms, 5 unusual thought content/ 
delusional ideas/paranoia, and 9 on perceptual abnormalities/hallucina -
tions) which participants first endorse the presence of a symptom (true 
or false) and then rate the severity from 0 (no distress) to 3 (severe 
distress). The PQ-16 demonstrates an all item-total correlations of at least 
0.31 and good internal consistency (α =  0.77) (Ising et al., 2012 ). Anxious, 
depressive, and subclinical psychotic symptoms were included in this 
study because they align with the expertise of the study’s institution 
and were the questionnaires from the Across Study that were adminis -
tered to all participants regardless of diagnosis, symptomology or other 
demographic or clinical factor, such as treatment status or illness 
severity.
Age, gender, diagnostic category, and use of psychotropic medication 
were included as covariates in the network. Age and gender were obtained 
from a demographic questionnaire. Diagnostic category and treatment were 
obtained from the participants’ medical records. The diagnosis is determined 
by a psychiatrist and categorized into 7 categories: schizophrenia spectrum 
and other psychotic disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, obses -
sive-compulsive and related disorders, misophonia (impulse-control disorder 
NOS), bipolar disorder, and other disorders. Use of psychotropic medication 
includes antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, psychostimulants, 
and mood stabilizers and is coded as a binary variable of 0 (no) and 1 (yes).
Nodes that were included in the network can be viewed in Table 1, 
excluding covariates. Each node represents either an existential factor or 
a symptom domain. To create the existential concerns nodes, individual 
items were collapsed with content-based selection and weighted topological 
overlap approach using the R-package EGAnet (Golino et al., 2020 ), which 
helps determined which items have a high degree of conceptual overlap 
based on correlations and can be collapsed together. Nodes in networks 
usually reflect individual items, and because these items are often taken 
from questionnaires that are meant to measure a latent construct, node 
reduction is suggested to reduce the degree of conceptual overlap between 
items and ensure that nodes represent “autonomous causal agents” and 
facilitate interpretability of results (Wysocki et al., 2022 ).COGENT MENTAL HEALTH

Data analyses
Analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.1 (R Core Team, 2020 ). We 
estimated cross-sectional regularized networks of existential concerns 
(continuous), psychopathological symptoms (continuous), and covari -
ates (continuous and categorical). In a network, variables are repre -
sented by nodes and the relationship between variables are 
represented by edges. To account for continuous and categorical vari -
ables, we estimated mixed graphical models (MGM) using the 
R-package mgm (Haslbeck & Waldorp, 2020 ), in which edges are statis -
tically defined by the nodewise regression coefficient. Due to the 
categorical variables in this model, a correlation matrix or partial corre -
lation network would not be suitable. MGM uses casewise deletion for 
analyses (Haslbeck & Waldorp, 2020 ), so participants with at least one 
missing data point were removed. To create sparse networks, models 
were estimated with the least absolute shrinkage and selection opera -
tor (LASSO), using the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC) 
and a gamma of 0.5, which reduces false positive edges by shrinking all 
edge weights and setting the smallest to zero. This produces a network 
with non-zero edges, or edges that have a weight greater than zero as 
an edge weight of zero indicates that there is no edge. Due to this Table 1. Nodes and labels

regularization process, a mixed graphical model is more appropriate 
than a simple correlation matrix, which does not reduce false positives, 
for investigating the relationships between numerous variables. After 
estimation, networks were visualized as undirected networks with the 
R-package qgraph (Epskamp et al., 2012 ), using the “circle” layout and 
colorblind theme.
The centrality metric of expected influence (EI) was computed using 
the R-packages qgraph (Epskamp et al., 2012 ). EI assesses a node’s 
cumulative influence in a network and is calculated as the summed 
weight of its edges while taking into account negative edges 
(Robinaugh et al., 2016 ). By summing up the strengths of its edges, EI 
can give insight into a node’s role in the “activation, persistence, and 
remission of the network” (Robinaugh et al., 2016 ) and indicates which 
node has the most overall impact in the network. Clinically, this may be 
used to guide hypotheses on potential treatment targets. To check for 
the influence of variable properties on centrality, EI was correlated with 
infrequency of endorsement, means, variance, and standard deviations 
of variables (Spiller et al., 2020 ; Terluin et al., 2016 ).
To assess the accuracy of edge weights, differences between edges and 
centralities, and the stability of centralities, stability checks were con -
ducted using bootnet as detailed in Epskamp et al. (2018) . This results in 
bootstrapped non-parametric 95% confidence intervals based on 1,000 
bootstrap samples, which are used to indicate the accuracy of the edge 
weights and differences between edges and centralities. The width of the 
interval indicates the accuracy of the edge weights. Whether or not an 
interval contains a zero indicates if there are differences between edges 
and centralities of nodes. For example, if the interval does not contain 
zero, this means that the edges or centralities differ at the α = 0.05 level. 
Case-drop bootstrapping, in which a certain percentage of the sample is 
randomly removed in an iterative manner, based on 1,000 bootstrap 
samples produces a correlation-stability (CS) coefficient, which indicate 
the stability of centralities. A CS coefficient should not be below 0.25 
and preferably above 0.5 (Epskamp et al., 2018 ).
As sensitivity analyses, a control network without misophonia was esti-
mated, given that it was the largest group (35.7% of the sample) and may 
impact the whole sample estimates. Centralities were computed and stability 
checks were conducted for this control network. Given differences in estima -
tion methods (i.e., differing diagnostic variable levels), a network comparison 
test cannot be used to compare the main and control network. Therefore, 
similarities between the main and control network were evaluated using the 
correlation between edge lists as a global measure of network similarity, the 
percentage of individual edges that are replicated, correlations of centralities 
between networks, and replication of the most central symptoms.COGENT MENTAL HEALTH

Results
Sample characteristics
Data from 996 participants collected between 2012 and 2022 were 
included in the analyses. 1155 patients participated in the study, but 
159 were excluded because of missing data. Data was determined to be 
missing at random (MAR) through inspection and according to Little’s 
Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) test (χ2 = 36.7, DF = 32, p =  
0.261). The distribution of the primary diagnosis reflects the naturalistic 
patient population of the Amsterdam UMC. Sample characteristics can

Network analysis
The network of existential concerns and symptoms is visualized in Figure 1.
The whole sample network contained 14 non-zero edges out of 21 
possible edges (excluding edges with and between covariates), 100% of 
which were positive. This indicates that existential concerns were over -
all related to worse psychopathology. Generally, the network appears to 
be stable as indicated by the generally narrow confidence intervals of 
the edge weights (Figure S1 in the Supplementary materials). The 
strongest cross-domain edge was between recognition of psychiatric

disorder and anxiety (weight= .28), in which stronger recognition of 
psychiatric disorder was related to worse anxiety. This edge was sig-
nificantly different from 9 other edges (Figure S2 in the Supplementary 
materials). Existential concerns were most strongly related to depressive 
and anxiety symptoms whereas psychosis was related to identity. The 
edge matrix for the network can be viewed in Table S3 and results of 
stability checks can be viewed in Figures S1-S4 in the Supplementary 
materials.
The centrality plot of EI can be viewed in Figure 2. Anxiety had the highest 
EI overall, meaning that it had the highest cumulative influence in the net-
work as determined by the summed weight of its edges, and the existential 
factor with the highest EI was autonomy with identity as a close second. 
Autonomy and identity were significantly different from 4 other nodes, but 
were not significantly different from each other (Figure S3 in the 
Supplementary Materials). EI is highly stable with a CS coefficient of 0.75, 
meaning that 75% of the data could be dropped and retain a correlation of 
0.7 with the original dataset with 95% certainty. Furthermore, EI was not 
significantly correlated with infrequency of endorsement (r= −.07, p = .88), 
mean (r = .64, p = .12), variance (r = .59, p = .16), or standard deviation (r = .63, 
p = .13) of nodes, indicating the EI was not influenced by variable properties.
Effects of covariates can also be viewed in Table S3. Across all networks, 
diagnosis had the most relationships with the existential concerns and

symptoms. Diagnosis had the strongest relationship with recognition of 
psychiatric disorder and depressive symptoms.
The control network without misophonia (n = 640) resulted in 13 non- 
zero edges, 100% of which were positive. The control network also 
appears to be stable as indicated by the narrow confidence intervals of 
the edge weights (Figure S7 in the Supplementary materials). The edges of 
the main and control network were strongly correlated (r = .96, p < .001). 
91% of the edges in the control network were replicated in the main 
network and 86% of the edges in the main network were replicated in 
the control network. The edge between recognition of psychiatric disorder 
and anxiety as the strongest (weight= .32) was replicated, which was 
significantly different from 9 other edges (Figure S8 in the 
Supplementary materials). Autonomy and identity also had the highest EI 
out of the existential concerns, which were significantly different from 3 
other nodes, but were not significantly different from each other (Figure 
S9 in the Supplementary materials), and the overall EI is significantly 
correlated between the main and control networks (r = .98, p < .001). EI 
demonstrated high stability (CS coefficient = .75). The control network, 
centrality plots, and stability and difference tests can be viewed in the 
Supplementary materials (Figures S5-S10).
Discussion
This study for the first time investigated existential concerns and symptoms in 
patients with various psychiatric disorders from a transdiagnostic perspective 
using network analysis. In a large naturalistic cohort, we found that worse 
symptom severity was related to worse existential concerns and that auton -
omy and identity were highly influential nodes in the network. The findings 
highlight the importance of including existential concerns in psychiatric 
research.
Overall, we found that existential concerns were mostly related to 
anxiety and depressive symptoms. This is in line with previous existential 
works in which existential concerns are an integral part of psychiatric 
suffering and especially deeply intertwined with anxiety and depression 
(Bygstad Landro & Giske, 2018 ; Yalom, 1980 ). The literature on the general 
population and patients with cancer also shows a clear relation between 
existential concerns and negative emotional states, such as anxiety and 
depression (e.g., Berman et al., 2006 ; Chen et al., 2022 ; Mascaro & Rosen,  
2005 ; Vehling & Kissane, 2018 ). Some consider anxiety and depression to 
be existential states in and of themselves and numerous existential philo -
sophers and psychiatrists (e.g., Paul Tillich (1952 ), Viktor Frankl (1985 ), Irvin 
Yalom (1980 ), and Martin Heidegger (1927 ), among others) have posited 
that psychopathology is a reaction to or extension of existential concerns. COGENT MENTAL HEALTH
 13

For instance, anxiety can manifest when one confronts existential con-
cerns, such as death (e.g., Tillich, 1952 ), or depression can be an outcome 
of a sense of meaninglessness (e.g., Frankl, 2005 ). Over time, these experi -
ences of anxiety or depression can become pathological and pathologized 
(Nieman, 2016 ). However, not all psychopathology results from existential 
concerns. Experiencing a chronic illness, including a psychiatric disorder, 
can make one more acutely aware of existential concerns as one grapples 
with what it means to live with a disorder, though (Kaite et al., 2015 ; 
Yalom, 1980 ).
The strongest cross-domain relationship was between recognition of psy-
chiatric disorder and anxiety symptoms. This could potentially reflect the 
“insight paradox”, in which increased insight can have positive effects, such 
as better clinical and psychosocial outcomes, while also having negative 
effects, such as decreased well-being and depression (Gonzalez, 2008 ; 
Lysaker et al., 2006 ; Sorgaard et al., 2011 ). Shame and self-stigma can be 
related to insight (Buchman-Wildbaum et al., 2020 ), and studies have shown 
relationships between shame, self-stigma, and anxiety symptoms (Busby 
Grant et al., 2016 ; Szentágotai-Tătar et al., 2020 ). As observed in the clinic, 
recognition could increase also anxiety as patients realize the severity of their 
situation and the uncertainty of their trajectory and outcomes, especially if 
they have a family history of mental illness- an observation that merits further 
investigation. Additionally, psychopathology can cause suffering beyond 
symptomology due to negative effects, such as impaired functioning, losses 
in several life domains, and thwarted motivations (Yager, 2021 ). For instance, 
one can perceive oneself as worthless for being depressed or worry about 
potential consequences of having a disorder (Hanson & Young, 2012 ). 
Suffering due to psychopathology can be considered transdiagnostic and 
related to negative mood and anxious apprehension (Yager, 2021 ). 
Altogether, this finding further supports the importance of targeting not 
only symptoms but the behaviors, thoughts, and outcomes in response to 
the symptoms and their meaning to the patient.
Autonomy and identity had the highest expected influence and were 
nodes that most strongly related to all other existential concerns and symp -
toms, except for (subclinical) psychotic and anxiety symptoms, respectively. 
Autonomy can be described as the capacity of an individual that enables 
them to live a meaningful life of their own making (Bergamin et al., 2022 ) and 
is considered a basic psychological need to function effectively and for well- 
being (Deci & Ryan, 2000 ). Compromised autonomy, including perceived lack 
of control and avolition, can be related to depression and negative affect 
(Rouse et al., 2020 ; Vansteenkiste et al., 2006 ). Additionally, a possible relation 
is seen between autonomy and mental disorders, in which autonomy can be 
differently affected in mental disorders according to the underlying psycho -
pathology (Bergamin et al., 2022 ).14
 U. CHAVEZ-BALDINI ET AL.

As found in previous literature, many individuals with psychiatric disorders 
struggle with a loss of self and identity (Kaite et al., 2015 ; Wisdom et al., 2008 ). 
Identity disturbance has been associated with numerous psychiatric disorders 
(Kaufman et al., 2015 ; Neacsiu et al., 2015 ) and could be considered 
a transdiagnostic construct. It has also been shown to be specifically related 
to depression severity (Sokol & Eisenheim, 2016 ) and psychosis or psychotic- 
like experiences (Cicero, 2017 ; Cowan et al., 2021 ). Bergamin et al. (2022) posit 
that in depression and psychosis, a loss of autonomy relates more to an 
affected sense of identity and motivations. Interestingly, autonomy and 
identity were the most strongly related of all other existential concerns. 
Supporting autonomy and positive identity formation may therefore be 
areas for intervention. For instance, self-stigma can thwart both autonomy 
and identity (Bergamin et al., 2022 ; Buchman-Wildbaum et al., 2020 ) and 
could be a potential mechanism to intervene on.
Whether existential concerns overlap with, lead to or arise from psycho -
pathology, addressing these concerns in psychiatric research and practice is 
important (Moore & Goldner-Vukov, 2009 ), especially because many patients 
find that symptom-reduction alone is insufficient as treatment outcome 
(Binder et al., 2010 ; Zimmerman et al., 2006 ). Addressing existential concerns 
may sometimes fall out of the scope or capacity of conventional care. 
Existential psychotherapy and social prescribing are examples of supplemen -
tary or alternative interventions that address existential and social needs (e.g., 
South et al., 2008 ; Yalom, 1980 ). Third-wave therapies, such as Acceptance 
and Commitment therapy (ACT), and the emerging process-based therapies 
and approaches are also turning their attention to more existential themes. 
Recovery-oriented frameworks and interventions may also prove fruitful, such 
as the CHIME model, which focuses on empowerment and meaning in life 
(Van Weeghel et al., 2019 ). There has also been an increased attention to 
considering religiosity or spirituality of patients within care to aid recovery 
(Koslander et al., 2009 ). It could also be possible to address existential con-
cerns in standard psychotherapy by targeting underlying psychological con-
structs (e.g., self-efficacy for autonomy) (Bergamin et al., 2022 ). Existential 
concerns should be treated as part of the lived experience and not patholo -
gized, however. Peer support workers can in this case be instrumental in 
aiding existential recovery (Whitley & Drake, 2010 ). Further research is neces -
sary to differentiate between general existential concerns and psychopathol -
ogy to avoid overtreatment and give opportunity for personal growth 
(Nieman, 2016 ).
The main strengths of the study pertain to the naturalistic and transdiag -
nostic nature of the sample and instruments and the relatively large sample 
size. Our results were stable, and we included some demographic and clinical 
characteristics as covariates to limit confounding effects. Furthermore, we 
performed sensitivity and control analyses to check for the effect of COGENT MENTAL HEALTH
 15

misophonia and variable properties on our main findings, lending support to 
the validity of our results.
Nonetheless, the results of this study should be interpreted with a number 
of limitations. First, the cross-sectional design prevents any directional or causal 
interpretations of relationships and decreases robust interpretation of centrality 
as it does not always translate to mechanisms of change nor can we ascertain 
directionality of influence (Spiller et al., 2020 ). However, cross-sectional net-
works have exploratory value and may be useful to investigate the co- 
occurrence of symptoms or other clinical factors and generate hypotheses 
(Bos et al., 2017 ; von Klipstein et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, existential concerns 
were not derived from questionnaires specifically measuring existential con-
cerns, which may reduce validity of the items included in this network. The 
Across study was also not specifically designed to investigate existential 
themes, meaning that our operationalization of these themes is not thorough 
and that not all potential existential themes are included in this study. It also 
remains necessary to further investigate existential themes that specifically 
pertain to patients with psychiatric disorders, such as the experience of psy-
chopathology itself, and develop validated instruments. As a result, our hypoth -
eses and analyses of these themes remained exploratory. Sum scores of 
symptom questionnaires were also used, which can lead to a loss of informa -
tion about relationships between individual items. This was done to reduce the 
number of nodes in the network due to the exploratory nature of this study.
Additionally, sample bias may have played a role, such that those with 
worse psychopathology were less likely to participate. The overrepresenta -
tion of misophonia in the sample could be a reflection of this, but we 
conducted a sensitivity analysis for this. Lastly, while the sample size was 
relatively large, the diagnostic categories were not large enough to compare 
individual diagnosis networks. Support for the transdiagnostic nature of our 
findings is therefore less robust. We did however include diagnosis as 
a covariate in the network in order to control for potential diagnostic effects. 
Lastly, we were not able to take into account the potential impact of somatic 
diseases and conditions, such as cancer, which have been shown to affect 
existential concerns. As psychiatric disorders and somatic diseases regularly 
co-occur, it is necessary for future research on existential concerns and 
psychopathology to include somatic diseases as a potential factor. Another 
factor we were not able to take into account was religiosity. As existential 
concerns can have a religious or spiritual component or be impacted by one’s 
religiosity or spirituality, investigating these factors in future research is 
necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding on the relationship 
between existential concerns and psychopathology.
Overall, the findings of this study further support the importance of including 
existential concerns in psychiatric research. While there is evidence that indivi -
duals with psychiatric disorders grapple with existential concerns, further 16

research is needed to investigate the interplay of existential concerns and 
dimensions of psychopathology, especially with dynamic and longitudinal 
designs to determine directionality of relationships and more robustly elucidate 
potential treatment targets.
