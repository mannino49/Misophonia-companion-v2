Objectives: Misophonia is a little-understood disorder in which certain 
sounds cause a strong emotional response in those who experience it. 
People who are affected by misophonia may find that noises like loud 
chewing, pen clicking, and/or sniffing trigger intense frustration, anger, 
or discomfort. The relationship of misophonia with other auditory disor -
ders including loudness hyperacusis, tinnitus, and hearing loss is largely 
underexplored. This project aimed to investigate the prevalence and 
hearing-health comorbidities of misophonia in a college-aged popula-
tion by using an online survey.
Design: A total of 12,131 undergraduate and graduate students between 
the ages of 18 and 25 were given the opportunity to answer an in-depth 
online survey. These students were sampled in a roughly 50 of 50 sex 
distribution. The survey was created using Qualtrics and included the 
following components: electronic consent, demographics questionnaire, 
Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ), Khalfa’s Hyperacusis Questionnaire 
(HQ), Tinnitus and Hearing Survey, and Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). 
To be eligible for compensation, answers for each of the above com-
ponents were required, with the exception of the TFI, which was only 
presented to students who indicated that they experienced tinnitus. 
Respondents were determined to have high or possible likelihood of 
having misophonia if they gave specific answers to the MQ’s Emotion 
and Behavior Scale or the MQ Severity Scale.
Results: After excluding duplicate responses and age-related outliers, 
1,084 responses were included in the analysis. Just over 20% (n = 217) 
of the sample was determined to have a high or probable likelihood of 
having misophonia. The sample was primarily White, female, and of 
mid-to-high socioeconomic status. There was a strong positive cor -
relation between MQ total scores and HQ total scores. High likelihood 
misophonia status showed a significant relationship with self-reported 
hearing loss and tinnitus. No statistically significant relationship was 
found between misophonia and age, ethnicity, or socioeconomic sta-
tus. MQ total scores differed significantly when separating respon-
dents by sex, self-reported tinnitus, and loudness hyperacusis. White 
respondents had significantly higher MQ total scores than Asian/Asian 
American respondents.
Conclusions: The estimated prevalence of misophonia was about 8% to 
20% of the sample, which agrees with most of the currently published 
research examining misophonia symptoms in collegiate populations. 
Results of data analysis suggest that misophonia severity may be related 
to loudness hyperacusis, sex, and possibly tinnitus. Future studies are 
needed to further examine the characteristics of these relationships, 
possibly in populations more optimized to reflect the general population 
or those with hearing-health disorders.Key words: Decreased sound tolerance, Hyperacusis, Misophonia,

INTRODUCTION
Misophonia, initially defined by Jastreboff and Jastreboff  
in 2001, is a decreased sound tolerance disorder that causes 
patients to have a negative involuntary emotional and physical 
response to specific sounds. Since its initial description, there 
has been an increased clinical and academic interest in miso-
phonia and other sound tolerance disorders to better understand 
the nature of misophonia and its symptoms. Current attitudes 
reflect that misophonia is not the hatred of sounds in general, 
but rather adverse reactions to a select set of specific auditory 
stimuli that vary between individuals, without a known relation 
to a person’ s hearing thresholds (Jastreboff & Jastreboff 2001; 
Siepsiak & Dragan 2019). Despite the surge of interest in the 
disorder, misophonia is still critically under-researched and its 
prevalence is still unclear.
Misophonic Trigger Sounds and Reactions
Common misophonic trigger sounds include chewing, slurp-
ing, pen-clicking, breathing, lip-smacking, sniffing, and tapping, 
among others (Edelstein et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2014; Potgieter et 
al. 2019). Sources of misophonic triggers may be specific to or 
heightened by familiar people, such as family members, friends, 
and coworkers (Edelstein et al. 2013). Individuals with misopho-
nia may have multiple triggers, each causing a unique variety of 
emotional and physical reactions. Emotional reactions to trigger 
sounds can present in a wide range from disgust, repulsion, and 
anxiety to anger and violent thoughts (Kumar et al. 2014; Wu 
et al. 2014). It has been observed that somatic responses may 
also accompany these emotions, including difficulty breathing, 
increased body temperature, increased heart rate, and pressure 
in the chest based on patient self-report (Edelstein et al. 2013) 
and in-person lab testing (Kumar et al. 2017). Consequently, 
misophonia symptoms can lead to maladaptive and avoidance 
behaviors, which may significantly impair an individual’ s level 
of functioning (e.g., social and occupational).
Evaluation and Diagnosis of Misophonia
Swedo et al. (2022) developed a consensus definition using 
the Delphi method to describe misophonia. They defined miso-
phonia as a disorder of decreased tolerance to specific sounds 
or trigger stimuli, which are unpleasant or distressing and elicit 
negative emotional, physiological, and behavioral responses. 
Swedo et al. (2022) also described reactions to triggers,

influences on reactions, functional impairments, relation-
ships to other conditions/disorders, and misophonic triggers. 
However, the thresholds at which reactions to such triggers rise 
to the level of a disorder, such as misophonia, are not defined. 
The introduction of a consensus definition is a promising step 
forward in the arena of misophonia research. It is expected that 
as understanding of misophonia and the amount of research sur -
rounding it grows, this definition will continue to evolve and 
change.
Present literature supports a differential diagnosis approach 
to evaluate whether a patient is presenting with misophonia or 
not (Siepsak & Dragan 2019). Although it is a distinct disorder, 
misophonia’ s similarities to other decreased sound tolerance 
disorders, such as hyperacusis, provide a challenge for accurate 
identification. Hyperacusis refers to when an individual experi-
ences discomfort listening to a broad range of sounds that are 
acceptable to individuals with normal hearing (Khalfa et al. 
2002). In addition, hyperacusis has been further categorized 
into four categories: (1) loudness hyperacusis, discomfort to 
moderately loud sounds, (2) annoyance hyperacusis, negative 
emotional reaction to sound, (3) fear hyperacusis, avoidance, or 
anticipatory response to sound, and (4) pain hyperacusis, expe-
rience pain at lower sound levels than individuals with normal-
hearing (Tyler et al. 2014). Situating misophonia within this 
framework, involves very specific trigger sounds akin to fear 
and/or annoyance hyperacusis, whereas loudness hyperacusis 
involves heightened sensitivity to a broad range of sounds and 
may be treated as the more general form of hyperacusis. In this 
article, the discussion of hyperacusis will pertain to loudness 
hyperacusis. Note Tyler et al. (2014) describe subcategories of 
hyperacusis but the overlap between categories is not character -
ized, nor is there an assumption in the framework that having 
one subtype of hyperacusis correlates with having another sub-
type. Furthermore, Swedo et al. (2022) do not mention loudness 
hyperacusis. Thus, distinguishing between these commonly 
occurring conditions is important.
Misophonia may also be comorbid or share characteristics 
with certain psychological conditions, like anxiety disorders 
and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), furthering the chal-
lenge of untangling misophonia and its symptoms from other 
diagnoses (Wu et al. 2014; Bruxner 2015). Complexity of 
misophonia comes from the lack of consensus on a universally 
accepted definition used in past misophonia research and evalu-
ation tools and comorbidity and association with other psycho-
logical conditions.
In the past decade, several clinical tools have been devel-
oped with the purpose of gauging the severity of a person’ s 
misophonia symptoms. The Amsterdam Misophonia Scale 
(A-MISO-S) is an adaptation of the Y ale-Brown Obsessive-
Compulsive scale and features six items meant to assess the 
level of impact misophonia has on various aspects of a patient’ s 
social life and emotions. The A-MISO-S scoring method groups 
patients into subclinical, mild, moderate, severe, and extreme 
symptom categories based on the patient’ s overall score on the 
six items (Schröder et al. 2013). Wu et al. (2014) developed 
the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ), a three-part self-report 
questionnaire that aims to identify specific trigger sounds, 
emotional and behavioral misophonic reactions, and overall 
sensitivity to sound. A third questionnaire developed in Polish, 
the MisoQuest, was created and validated in 2020 by Siepsiak, 
Śliwerski, & Dragan and displayed excellent reliability and features items based on the diagnostic criteria for misophonia 
proposed by Schröder et al. (2013). Most recently, the Duke 
Misophonia Questionnaire was developed and initially validated 
by Rosenthal et al. (2021), and aimed to measure five different 
facets of an adult’ s misophonia: the frequency at which they are 
affected by misophonic sounds; the degree of their misophonic 
response across domains of functioning; impairment caused by 
misophonia; coping mechanisms used before, during, and after 
exposure to a misophonic sound; and beliefs about self, others, 
and the world in relation to misophonia symptoms.
Although the development of these questionnaires is benefi-
cial to misophonia diagnosis and assessment, their reliance on 
subjectivity and lack of universally agreed-upon scoring cutoffs 
and groupings means that a complete picture of a person’ s miso-
phonia is not yet attainable. Further research is needed to repli-
cate and validate the results of the studies to improve or confirm 
their reliability, accuracy, and generalizability. Due to the dif-
ferent tools used in the published literature and differing crite-
ria for identifying clinically significant misophonic symptoms, 
estimating the prevalence of misophonia is especially challeng-
ing. More research and more validated tools are needed to esti-
mate the prevalence of misophonia in the greater population.
Misophonia Prevalence
Current literature posits that the onset of misophonic 
symptoms typically occurs in late childhood and adolescence 
(Potgieter et al. 2019), making young adults an optimal demo-
graphic to examine for studies interested in prevalence of 
misophonia. The majority of information on prevalence from 
large-scale studies comes from three studies that focus on the 
incidence of misophonia among college-aged university stu-
dents, which estimates that misophonia affects between 20 
and 50% of their samples with limited generalizability to the 
larger population (Wu et al. 2014; Zhou et al. 2017; Naylor et 
al. 2020).
A sample of 482 undergraduate students at the University of 
South Florida completed the MQ along with other self-report 
measures of OCD, depression, impairment/disability, and sen-
sory defensiveness to give a picture of the dynamics and preva-
lence of misophonia in a large sample. The study determined 
that around 20% of survey participants reported clinically 
significant misophonia symptoms (Wu et al. 2014). It should 
be considered that the criteria for distinguishing clinically sig-
nificant misophonia symptoms from subclinical misophonia 
symptoms were the score indicated on a single item, the MQ 
Misophonia Severity Scale, in which participants rated their 
overall sensitivity to sound on a visual analog scale from 1 to 15 
(minimal-very severe).
Later, Zhou et al. (2017) completed an article-and-pencil 
survey study in a group of 415 college students at Shanghai 
Normal University and Shanghai Polytechnic University using 
a similar test battery to Wu et al. (2014). Although the cutoff  
to identify clinically significant misophonia symptoms using 
the MQ remained the same as it was in the 2014 study, a score 
of 12 or higher on the Sheehan Disability Scale—Misophonia 
(SDS-M) was added to the inclusion criteria for the clinically 
significant group. The results of this study without the addi-
tional impairment criterion were consistent with the previous 
findings by Wu et al. (2014), with around 20% of the students 
who participated in the study indicating clinically significant 
misophonia symptoms (Zhou et al. 2017). When the impairment

criterion was considered, the levels of impairment decreased to 
only 6% of the study, suggesting that while sound sensitivity 
may affect a large percentage of the sample, a much smaller por -
tion experienced moderate impairment attributed to decreased 
sound tolerance (Zhou et al. 2017).
Most recently, in 2020 a sample of 336 students from the 
School of Medicine at the University of Nottingham were 
recruited to complete an online test battery examining miso-
phonia using the A-MISO-S with a total score of five or more 
indicating clinically significant misophonia symptoms (Naylor 
et al. 2020). Estimations of misophonia incidence among the 
sample were markedly higher than those established by previ-
ous studies (Wu et al. 2014; Zhou et al. 2017), with 49.1% of 
the sample indicating clinically significant misophonia (Naylor 
et al. 2020). It should be noted; however, that the definition for 
clinically significant misophonia in the study included people 
who scored in mild to extreme categories, whereas the previous 
studies only considered those who displayed moderate to severe 
misophonia symptoms as defined on the MQ.
Recently, studies have begun examining the prevalence of 
misophonia in the general population. Jakubovski et al. (2022) 
used MQ and A-MISO-S Revised (AMISOS-R) to conduct a 
large-scale representative population survey in Germany. In a 
sample of 2519 participants, clinically significant misophonia 
was found in 5% as measured by the MQ and 5.9% as mea-
sured by the AMISOS-R. Similarly, Kılıç et al. (2021) sampled 
541 participants from 300 Turkish households. Using their own 
diagnostic criteria, they found that misophonia was found in 
12.8% of the Turkish population. Vitoratou et al. (2023) esti-
mated misophonia in a large representative sample of the UK 
general population. They estimated that 18.4% of UK partici-
pants had misophonia which causes significant burden. These 
studies typically do not report on any comorbid hearing issues, 
although Kılıç et al. (2021) did examine a history of tinnitus and 
misophonia symptoms but did not find a significant relationship.
Goals of the Study
The goal of this study was to further examine misophonia in 
a large and heterogeneous collegiate sample using an extensive 
survey test battery of audiological and psychological question-
naires, with the goal of further understanding the prevalence 
and hearing-health comorbidities of the disorder. This allowed 
us to partially replicate existing studies (using the Wu et al., 
MQ, which was used in both Wu et al. (2014) and Zhou et al. 
(2017). In addition, in a misophonia sample group, we discuss 
the proportion of demographic characteristics and comorbid 
hearing-related conditions such as loudness hyperacusis, tinni-
tus, and hearing loss; and their relationship to misophonia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Survey Construction and Surveys Used
The survey was constructed using Qualtrics and included 
the following components: electronic consent, demographics 
questionnaire, MQ, Khalfa’ s Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ), 
Tinnitus and Hearing Survey (THS), Tinnitus Functional Index 
(TFI), and the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-
R). For the purpose of this article, the results of the OCI-R will 
not be discussed, as a more in-depth analysis of that data will 
be included in a forthcoming article. Although the study used a different test battery than previous research into misopho-
nia prevalence (Wu et al. 2014; Zhou et al. 2017; Naylor et al. 
2020), the age range used for the study remained similar, to 
allow for a replication of the college-aged respondents recruited 
in previous studies.
The MQ is an assessment tool that aims to assess a patient’ s 
misophonia symptoms, misophonic reactions, and overall sever -
ity of sound sensitivity (Wu et al. 2014). It contains three sections 
with good internal consistency as reported in the initial publica-
tion: the Misophonia Symptom Scale (Cronbach’ s α = 0.86), 
the Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors Scale (Cronbach’ s α 
= 0.86), and the Misophonia Severity Scale (Cronbach’ s α = 
0.89). The Misophonia Symptoms Scale provides insight into 
the presence of sound sensitivities and that specific sounds 
prompt a misophonic response from the respondent. The final 
item on the survey, the Misophonia Severity Scale, was based 
on the National Institute of Mental Health Global Obsessive-
Compulsive Scale and is a single visual analog scale that allows 
the participant to indicate their subjective perception of overall 
sound sensitivity from a score of 1 indicating “minimal” sound 
sensitivity to a score of 15 indicating “very severe” sound sen-
sitivity; a score of 7 or higher was determined to indicate clini-
cally significant misophonia symptoms (Wu et al. 2014). The 
MQ is one of the most widely used tools to assess misophonia 
severity and its impact on an individual’ s quality of life.
The HQ is a screening tool used to assess a patient for symp-
toms of loudness hyperacusis, a decreased sound tolerance 
disorder in which a person experiences extreme sensitivity to 
sounds that may be perceived as normal intensity by the aver -
age listener. The HQ evaluates loudness hyperacusis in three 
different dimensions: attentional, social, and emotional; but the 
extent to which these dimensions characterize subcategories as 
discussed in Tyler et al. (2014) is not known. Often, hearing 
thresholds in patients with loudness hyperacusis are within nor -
mal limits and, much like misophonia, most of the assessment 
and diagnosis of hyperacusis is based on subjective patient self-
report, and there are currently no universally agreed-upon mea-
sures to diagnose the disorder. Aazh and Moore (2017) suggest 
an HQ total score of 22, whereas Khalfa et al. (2002) recom-
mend a cutoff score of 28. Because the study intended to recruit 
both hyperacusis participants and participants who experience 
hyperacusis comorbid with misophonia, this was a useful tool 
to include in the survey. The internal consistency of the HQ was 
acceptable ranging from Cronbach’ s α = 0.66 to 0.68.
The THS is a brief 10-item survey intended for use to screen 
patients for symptoms of three auditory conditions: tinnitus, 
hearing loss, and decreased sound tolerance disorders. It was 
included to supplement information on whether a respondent 
has hearing loss, tinnitus, or both, should the determination be 
needed for the in-person portion of the study. The THS reported 
good to excellent internal consistency with Cronbach’ s α of 
0.86 to 0.94 (Henry et al. 2015).
Participant Recruitment
This research study was conducted at the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Because the onset of 
misophonia symptoms typically occurs in late childhood and 
into early adulthood (Potgieter et al. 2019), a college-aged 
young adult population was selected for participant recruit-
ment. A total of 12,131 undergraduate and graduate students at

UIUC between the ages of 18 to 25 were given the opportunity 
to answer an in-depth online survey. A total number of 10,000 
of these students were randomly sampled with the assistance of 
the Dean of Students of the institution in a roughly 50/50 sex 
distribution. The number of students contacted in each round of 
recruitment using samples from the Dean of Students, ranged 
from 1000 to 3000 per email blast. The remaining 2131 students 
were undergraduate and graduate students currently enrolled in 
the home college of several of the investigators of this study and 
were invited to complete the survey to increase survey yield; 
all students in the college between the ages of 18 and 25 were 
invited to complete the survey.
Study participants were compensated with a $5 Amazon 
eCard if the surveys were completed in full. To be eligible for 
compensation, answers to the electronic consent, demographics 
questionnaire, MQ, HQ, THS, and the OCI-R were required. 
The only survey that did not need to be completed for every 
student was the TFI, which was only presented to students 
who indicated that they experienced tinnitus. This study was 
approved by the relevant UIUC institutional review board pro-
tocol number 21268.
Data Organization and Participant Categorization
A total of 1084 complete responses were included in the 
data analysis. Once the HQ and MQ responses were formatted, 
the data were analyzed using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for 
Windows, Version 27.0) analytic software to identify partici-
pants who fit each of the following criteria: high likelihood of 
having misophonia, possible likelihood of having misophonia, 
high likelihood of having hyperacusis, and possible likelihood 
of having hyperacusis. Respondents with an overall score of 29 
or greater on the HQ were considered to have a high likelihood 
of hyperacusis and respondents with an overall score between 
23 and 28 on the HQ were considered to have a possible likeli-
hood of having hyperacusis. Criteria for inclusion were deter -
mined with the aim of encompassing some of the wide spectrum 
of possible trigger sounds, reactions, and symptoms related to 
misophonia, so as not to exclude anyone with misophonia-like 
symptoms. Single-item indicators of misophonia that assessed 
impairment and/or severity were incorporated into the present 
study’ s respondent classification schema for different likeli-
hoods of misophonia, which is thought to parallel the criteria of 
Zhou et al. (2017) with only the MQ.
Respondents classified as high likelihood of misophonia had 
at least one of the following characteristics: a score of 12 or 
higher on the MQ Severity Scale; self-report of always having 
to leave the room in the presence of trigger sounds; self-report 
of actively avoiding trigger sounds; self-report of always having 
violent thoughts in the presence of trigger sounds, self-report of 
always becoming verbally aggressive in the presence of trigger 
sounds, or self-report of often becoming physically aggressive 
in the presence of trigger sounds. Cutoff scores of 12 and 10 
on the MQ Severity Scale were chosen to designate high and 
possible likelihoods of having misophonia, respectively, as they 
designate moderate to severe sound sensitivity and would pro-
vide a higher level of confidence that participants selected for 
the in-person portion of the study were experiencing clinically 
significant symptoms of misophonia. These characteristics of 
high likelihood misophonia reflect intense reactions to trigger 
sounds. For a respondent to be classified as possibly having misophonia, one or more of the following characteristics were 
present: a score of 10 or 11 on the MQ Severity Scale; self-report 
of sometimes becoming physically aggressive in the presence of 
trigger sounds; self-report of often becoming verbally aggres-
sive in the presence of trigger sounds; or self-report of often 
experiencing violent thoughts in the presence of trigger sounds. 
The categorization criteria for those with a possible likelihood 
of having misophonia involved a self-report of milder, but still 
impactful, symptoms than those of the high likelihood miso-
phonia group. Our categorization criteria (other than the MQ 
Severity Scale score) emphasized aggression, which is typically 
precipitated by anger and which can be used as an indicator of 
anger severity (that does not require the respondent to explicitly 
acknowledge angry feelings). This was based on the salience of 
anger in so many sets of proposed diagnostic criteria for miso-
phonia (e.g., Schroeder et al. 2013; Lewin et al. 2015; Dozier 
et al. 2017).
Assessment of hearing loss was changed into a dichotomous 
variable where positive responses for “no hearing loss” and “not 
sure about hearing loss” were combined as “no hearing loss.” 
Tinnitus was also transformed into a dichotomous variable 
where “no tinnitus” and “not sure about tinnitus” were com-
bined as “no tinnitus.” The response options for self-reporting 
tinnitus and hearing loss were formatted similarly because rep-
resenting respondents with uncertainty as positive indications 
of each disorder would drastically overestimate the presence of 
these disorders in a young collegiate sample.
Data Analysis
Pearson correlation between the MQ and HQ total scores 
was computed first. Pearson Chi-Square test of independence 
was also used to examine associations between respondents cat-
egorized as having a high likelihood of misophonia and other 
categorical variables such as hyperacusis, tinnitus, hearing loss, 
race, ethnicity, sex, and parental education. Independent sample 
t-tests were used to determine whether there were differences in 
MQ total score and MQ severity for individuals for the presence 
or absence of hyperacusis, tinnitus, and hearing loss separately. 
Due to large differences in sample size, equal variances were 
not assumed. One-way analysis of variance was employed to 
determine differences in MQ total score and MQ severity for 
categorical variables with more than two levels. Cohen’ s d and r 
criteria were used to interpret effect sizes (Cohen 1988).
Exclusionary Criteria
On the self-report survey, participants were given the follow-
ing options to report gender identity: female/primarily feminine, 
male/primarily masculine, both male and female, neither male 
nor female, or do not know. A very small number of respondents 
(n = 28) responded with one of the latter three answers. For 
this reason, responses from these participants were excluded for 
the purpose of analyzing the data, and misophonia was instead 
examined in relation to felt female/primarily feminine or male/
primarily masculine sex. Similarly, there was a small sampling 
in the study of American Indian (n = 2) and Native Hawaiian/
Pacific Islander (n = 7); these responses were excluded from 
data analysis. In addition, although participants were advised to 
complete the survey only once, several participants submitted 
multiple responses; all additional responses beyond the initial 
submission were excluded for the purpose of data analysis.

Descriptive Analysis
Proportional data for respondents categorized as having a high 
and possible likelihood of misophonia and a high likelihood of 
hyperacusis are shown in Table 1. Using the operationalizations 
described earlier, 8.12% (n = 88) of respondents had a high like-
lihood of misophonia, and 11.9% (n = 129) of respondents had 
a modest likelihood of misophonia. Respondents with a high 
likelihood of having hyperacusis comprised 3.9% (n = 42) of the 
sample, with those having symptoms indicative of possible hyper -
acusis comprising 8.2% (n = 89) of the sample. Demographic 
information on the respondents’ race, age, gender, and paren-
tal education is shown in Table  2. Race demographics revealed 
slightly over half of respondents were White, just under a third 
were Asian/Asian American, a tenth were Black or multiracial, and 
the remainder were American Indian or Native Hawai’ian/Pacific 
Islander. Slightly more than a tenth of our sampling identified as 
Latinx. In our sample, just under two-thirds were female; slightly 
less than a third were male; and the remainder identified as a dif-
ferent gender. This sample of students had well-educated parents, 
with slightly less than half holding a graduate degree; over a third 
holding a bachelor’ s degree; and the remainder having an associ-
ate’ s degree, high school, or grade school education. Tinnitus was 
reported in 27.7% (n = 300), hearing loss was reported in 3.3% 
(n = 36), and hyperacusis was reported in 23.9% (n = 259) of all 
participants. See Table 2 for complete details. The study sample’ s 
MQ revealed Cronbach’ s α  values comparable to Wu et al. (2014) 
for each subscale: Misophonia Symptoms Scale (Cronbach’ s α  
= 0.84), Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors Scale (Cronbach’ s 
α = 0.89), and MQ Total Score (Cronbach’ s α  = 0.92). In addi-
tion, the present study’ s HQ internal consistencies were generally 
stronger than that reported in the study by Khalfa et al. (2002) 
values for each subscale: attentional (Cronbach’ s α  = 0.77), social 
(Cronbach’ s α = 0.76), and emotional (Cronbach’ s α  = 0.81).
Individual misophonia symptom frequency was also 
assessed. The most common misophonia stimuli reported to 
be “often” or “always” bothersome among the sample included 
sounds of eating (39.5% of sample), nasal sounds (29.7% of 
sample), and throat and tapping sounds (both 25.4% of sample) 
followed by environmental sounds (17.0% of sample), sounds 
of rustling (14.8% of sample), other sounds not listed (14.6% 
of sample), and 4.1% to consonant/vowels sounds (4.1). See 
Table 3 for complete details.
Relationship of Misophonia and Hyperacusis
Pearson Chi-square test of independence demonstrated a sig-
nificant association between high misophonia and hyperacusis 
classification [χ2(1) = 87.17, p  < 0.001, phi = 0.284]. MQ total scores showed a strong positive correlation with HQ total scores 
[r (1082) = 0.676, p  < 0.001]. These findings suggest a relation-
ship between misophonia and hyperacusis. The scatterplot of 
HQ total scores and MQ total scores illustrates their possible 
relationship in Figure 1. Independent samples t -test revealed a 
statistically significant difference in MQ total scores [t  (173.75) 
= 18.69, p  < 0.001] between respondents with possible or high 
likelihood hyperacusis (M = 36.89, SD = 10.65) and respon-
dents without hyperacusis (M = 19.26, SD = 11.16) with a large 
effect size (d  =1.59), underscoring the high comorbidity between 
hyperacusis and misophonia. Similarly, respondents with hyper -
acusis (M = 8.78, SD = 2.62) had significantly larger MQ sound 
severity scale scores [t  (175.81) = 14.78, p  < 0.001] than respon-
dents without hyperacusis (M = 5.09, SD = 2.89), with a large 
effect size (d  = 1.3). In addition, there was a significant effect 
[F(2, 1081) = 120.66, p  < 0.001)] for misophonia group status 
on HQ scores where those with a high likelihood of having miso-
phonia (M = 21.5, SD = 9.47) scored significantly higher than 
those with possible likelihood of having misophonia (M = 18.1, TABLE 1. Misophonia and hyperacusis proportions within the

SD = 7.23), with both groups scoring significantly higher HQ 
scores than the no misophonia likelihood group (M = 11.47, SD 
= 6.47). Thus, we observed that there was a high co-occurrence 
of hyperacusis and misophonia and that the severity of miso-
phonic symptoms was higher in individuals with hyperacusis.
Relationship of Misophonia and Tinnitus
Individuals with a high likelihood of misophonia demon-
strated a statistically significant relationship with self-reporting 
tinnitus [χ2(1) = 5.75, p = 0.016, phi = 0.073]. MQ total scores 
of respondents self-reporting having tinnitus (M=22.87, SD = 
13.00) were significantly larger [t (514.23) = 2.38, p = 0.018] 
than respondents without tinnitus (M = 20.81, SD = 12.26) with 
a small Cohen’ s d of 0.166. A significant difference in means 
between respondents with tinnitus (M = 6.07, SD = 3.22) and 
respondents without tinnitus (M = 5.36, SD = 3.04) on the MQ 
sound sensitivity scale was also determined [t (496.64) = 3.24, p 
= 0.001] with a small Cohen’ s d of 0.231. These findings suggest 
there may be an association between misophonia and tinnitus, 
with a small effect size reflecting the need for further examina-
tion to determine the relationship between the conditions.
Relationship of Misophonia and Hearing Loss
There was no statistically significant relationship between 
self-perceived hearing loss and a high likelihood of misophonia [χ2(1) = 0.328, p = 0.567, phi = –0.017]; it should be noted 
that the majority of respondents within this sample denied any 
perceived hearing loss. This sample is not optimized to examine 
the relationship between misophonia and hearing loss. There 
were no significant differences in MQ total scores based on self-
reported hearing status [t (37.06) = 1.890, p = 0.067] or the MQ 
sound sensitivity scale [t(30.91) = 0.971, p = 0.339].
Relationship of Misophonia With Demographic 
Characteristics
Due to very limited data collected from participants with a 
felt gender of both female and male, neither female nor male 
nor “don’t know,” a dichotomous sex variable featuring solely 
female/primarily feminine and male/primarily masculine 
was created and used in the analysis. Pearson Chi-Square test 
found no significant relationship between dichotomous sex and 
dichotomous high likelihood misophonia group status [χ2(1) = 
3.07, p = 0.08, phi = –0.054].
Independent samples t-tests showed a statistically significant 
difference in means between male (M = 17.40, SD = 12.00) 
and female (M = 23.15, SD = 12.29) participants for MQ total 
score [t (698.97) = 7.25, p < 0.001] with a medium effect size 
(Cohen’ s d = 0.47). Similarly, female subjects (M = 5.79, SD 
= 3.08) demonstrated significantly larger MQ sound sensitivity 
scale scores [t (614.21) = 4.16, p < 0.001] than did males (M = 
4.93, SD = 3.06) with a small effect size (Cohen’ s d = 0.282). 
This suggests that misophonic symptoms may be more severe 
in females.
The statistical analysis for race was reduced to four cate-
gories (White, Black, multiracial, Asian/Asian American) due 
to limited sampling of American Indian and Native Hawaiian/
Pacific Islander groups (n = 2 and n = 7, respectively). There 
were no significant relationships between participants catego-
rized with high likelihood misophonia and race [χ2(3) = 3.55, 
p = 0.314, phi = 0.060], or parental education [χ2(4) = 4.28, 
p = 0.370, phi = 0.063], or age [χ2(7) = 2.95, p = 0.89, phi = 
0.052], or ethnicity [χ2(1) = 1.62, p = 0.203, phi = –0.039]. 
When evaluating differences in MQ total score and MQ sound 
sensitivity scale on different categorical variables, there were no 
significant effects for parental education (“what is the highest 
level of education completed by your parent(s)”) on MQ total 
score [F(4,1079) = 0.085, p = 0.987] or MQ Sound sensitivity 
[F(4,1026) = 0.255, p = 0.907]; no significant differences in eth-
nicity for MQ total score [t (168.63) = 0.183, p = 0.855] or MQ 
sound sensitivity scale [t (175.90) = 0.172, p = 0.864]. However, 
there was a significant effect for race when comparing MQ total 
scores [F (3, 994) = 5.621, p = 0.001], but not the MQ sound TABLE 3. Individual symptoms endorsed on the Misophonia Questionnaire

parison using the Bonferroni correction (p = 0.003) revealed the

ing significantly larger MQ total scores [t (697.95) = 3.56, p <

DISCUSSION
The goal of this study was to estimate the proportion of 
misophonia in a collegiate population, as well as to explore pos-
sible links between misophonia and demographic information, 
tinnitus, HL, and hyperacusis. Estimated proportion of high 
likelihood misophonia and modest likelihood of misophonia 
was a combined 20% in our study. There was a positive cor -
relation between HQ and MQ scores. Furthermore, our find-
ings indicated there were significant differences in both MQ 
total scores and MQ sound sensitivity scores between male and 
female respondents, people who reported having tinnitus and 
those who did not, and people with and without hyperacusis.
Misophonia and Hearing Health Conditions
Discussion of hyperacusis and misophonia definition and 
boundaries that incorporate the wealth of research for each dis-
order are scant (Tyler et al. 2014; Swedo et al. 2022). Although 
misophonia may share characteristics of annoyance hyperacusis 
within Tyler et al., (2014) framework, its co-occurrence with 
loudness hyperacusis is not delineated in the literature. Our 
study found a positive significant correlation between MQ and 
HQ scores, suggesting misophonia and loudness hyperacusis 
may be often comorbid in the same individual. In addition, indi-
viduals with loudness hyperacusis may experience misophonia 
symptoms more severely, and vice versa.
In addition to suggesting that misophonia and hyperacusis 
(as measured by MQ and HQ, respectively) are associated, our 
results also suggested that these two conditions are distinct given 
that there was a large minority that had only one of the two con-
ditions. It should be noted that there are similarities in the types 
of items included in the questionnaire measures of misophonia 
and hyperacusis, it is possible that the results of this study over -
estimated the strength of the association between them. It will 
be important for future research to use additional approaches to 
measuring misophonia and hyperacusis when estimating their 
association. Our findings are novel and clinicians interested in 
treating either disorder will need to be cognizant of the symp-
toms of both disorders when planning targeted interventions. In 
the same vein, brain imaging studies are needed to map out the 
similarities and differences in the neural correlates of loudness 
hyperacusis and misophonia.
Few studies have used specific questions or questionnaires 
to characterize hyperacusis and misophonia to examine their 
association with each other, and thus there are limited options 
within the currently published literature to compare with this 
study’ s results. Aazh et al. (2022) examined audiological and 
psychological characteristics in hyperacusis and tinnitus 
patients with or without misophonia symptoms. 23% of par -
ticipants in their sample were categorized as having misophonia 
using question 4 of the sound sensitivity symptoms question-
naire (SSSQ4). SSSQ4 asks “Over the last 2 weeks, how often 
have you been feeling angry or anxious when hearing certain 
sounds related to eating noises, lip smacking, sniffling, breath-
ing, clicking sounds, tapping?” and respondents reporting occurrences for seven or more days were categorized as having 
misophonia. They found that 73% of individuals categorized 
as having misophonia had a significant impact on hyperacusis 
and found that SSSQ4 strongly correlated with patient scores 
on the Hyperacusis Impact Questionnaire. In total, Aazh and 
colleagues reported 42% of their sample as having some miso-
phonia symptoms.
Enzler et al. (2021) developed a psychoacoustic test for 
misophonia and recruited participants through misophonia and 
audiology-specific communities. They categorized participants 
with misophonia who had a MisoQuest score of ≥ 61 and also 
self-reported misophonia. Their sampling revealed that in par -
ticipants with misophonia, 73% self-reported hyperacusis, 19% 
self-reported tinnitus, and 22% self-reported hearing issues. It 
should be noted that Aazh et al. (2022) and Enzler et al. (2021) 
examined a broad range of ages (17 to 97 years in the former 
and a mean age of 33 years in the latter). The present study 
found that among collegiate students who self-reported miso-
phonia, 23.9% self-reported hyperacusis, 27.7% self-reported 
tinnitus, and 3.3% self-reported hearing loss.
This study noted statistically different means on both the MQ 
and the MQ Sound Sensitivity Severity Scale within the tin-
nitus self-report variable. Aazh et al. (2022) reported that 74% 
of their patients categorized with misophonia had severe tinni-
tus and found that the SSSQ4 strongly correlated with Tinnitus 
Impact Questionnaire scores. The present study found a sig-
nificant relationship between our categorization of misophonia 
status and self-reported tinnitus. In addition, respondents with 
tinnitus had higher MQ total scores than those without tinnitus. 
While this finding suggests that people with tinnitus may expe-
rience misophonia differently or more severely than those who 
do not have tinnitus, it is important to note that the self-report 
of tinnitus was extremely high for this sample and may not be 
reliable (n = 300, 27.67%, age range = 18 to 25 years). In Jarach 
et al. (2022) recent meta-analysis, tinnitus prevalence in young 
adults (age range 18 to 44 years) was found to be 9.7%. The 
question regarding tinnitus may have been confusing in that it 
did not seek to differentiate between chronic or temporary tin-
nitus and could be answered in the affirmative in either case 
(i.e. “Y es” or “Not sure”). Our findings are also different from 
those of Kılıç et al. (2021), who did not observe any association 
between a history of tinnitus and misophonia in their study.
Other in-person studies have examined the relationship 
between misophonia and hearing-related disorders. Schröder et 
al. (2013) randomly selected 5 of 42 participants to complete 
a measure of loudness discomfort levels (LDL) and audiom-
etry but found no hearing disorders. Jager et al. (2020) evalu-
ated hearing thresholds in 109 of 575 participants referred for 
misophonia. They found the prevalence of hearing loss in their 
sample was less than the general population, which may suggest 
no relationship between misophonia and hearing loss. Siepsiak 
et al. (2022) measured pure-tone audiometric thresholds and 
LDL in participants who reported misophonic or misophonic-
like symptoms and healthy controls. They found no significant 
group differences in LDL or hearing loss. In general, the preva-
lence of hearing disorders observed in the misophonia popula-
tion is relatively small.
LDLs or a measure of loudness growth are endorsed as a 
method of assessing loudness hyperacusis, apart from self-
reports, whereas the other subcategories of hyperacusis may 
only be evaluated by questionnaires on interviews (Pienkowski

et al. 2014). Nevertheless, instructions on patient’ s internal cri-
teria and hearing sensitivity may vary, which makes it difficult 
to compare across studies and establish norms based on loud-
ness level. Patient self-reporting, questionnaires, and interview-
style questions may lack the objectivity desired for targeted 
diagnosis of loudness hyperacusis but would reveal the other 
subcategories of hyperacusis. This variability of each measure 
emphasizes the importance of using multiple measures to char -
acterize all subcategories of hyperacusis.
Misophonia in a Large Collegiate Sample
This study estimated the proportion of misophonia within a 
large (n > 1000) sample of collegiate students to be between 8% 
and 20.02%. This finding is in agreement with the conclusions 
of Wu et al. (2014) and Zhou et al. (2017) who found, in their 
college-aged samples, a misophonia prevalence of about 20% 
when using the study by Wu et al. original criteria, and a prev-
alence of about 6% when including an impairment criterion. 
The tools used to evaluate participants as well as the criteria 
used to determine whether a participant would be categorized as 
meeting the threshold for “clinically significant” misophonia for 
the purpose of this study were most similar to that of Wu et al. 
(2014) study than that of the Naylor et al. (2020) study, which 
used more liberal criteria to determine what constitutes “clini-
cally significant” misophonia and had a much higher estimated 
prevalence among their sample.
The present study identified a statistically significant dif-
ference in MQ total score means and overall sound sensitiv-
ity between men and women. This finding diverges from the 
results of Wu et al. (2014), who found no significant relation 
between gender and MQ total score. To further compare the 
findings of the present study to that of Wu et al. (2014), the 
present sample was categorized using Wu et al.’ s (2014) criteria 
of the MQ Severity Scale ≥7 indicating clinically significant 
symptoms. This study’ s criteria found that the proportion of 
women with a high likelihood of misophonia exceeded that of 
men (8.9% women vs. 5.8% men), but respondent sex was not 
a factor when considering the possible likelihood of misopho-
nia (11.7% women vs. 11.8% men). Using Wu et al.’ s (2014) 
criteria in the present sample resulted in 29.1% of men and 
39.1% of women being identified as having misophonia-like 
traits. Using Wu et al.’ s (2014) criteria in the present sample 
resulted in 29.1% of men and 39.1% of women being identified 
as having misophonia-like traits. This suggests that whereas in 
our study the proportion of females reporting misophonia far 
outnumbered males when using the study by Wu et al. (2014) 
criteria, such observations are sensitive to the criteria used 
and broader claims about gender disparity should be carefully 
examined in future studies. Literature reviews previously have 
not found consistent information regarding misophonia occur -
rence and severity disparities between men and women (Brout 
et al. 2018; Potgieter et al. 2019); however, recent reports have 
noted a higher prevalence of misophonia in young women com-
pared with other demographic groups (Kılıç et al. 2021; Ertuerk 
et al. 2023).
No statistically significant relationships were found between 
our categorization of high likelihood misophonia and ethnic-
ity, parental education level, or age. In regard to parental edu-
cation level, US census data for 2021 cited by the National 
Center for Education Statistics (2022), the proportion of US parents holding a graduate degree (22.3%), or bachelor’ s degree 
(24.4%) was much lower than parents of respondents in the 
present study who held a graduate degree (43.3%) or bache-
lor’ s degree (34.0%). The present study also found that Whites 
had significantly higher MQ total scores than Asians/Asian 
Americans. Wu et al. (2014) found no significant relationships 
between age or race/ethnicity and misophonia symptoms; they 
did not consider parental education level.
When comparing the frequency of misophonic trigger 
sounds in this study’ s sample with that observed in the stud-
ies by Wu et al. (2014) and Zhou et al. (2017), eating sounds, 
nasal sounds, throat sounds, and repetitive/tapping noises were 
the four most commonly observed trigger sounds in all three 
samples. However, this study recorded a higher proportion of 
respondents noting eating sounds as triggers (39.5%) compared 
with that of Zhou et al. (16.6%) and Wu et al. (22.8%).
Limitations of the Study
Although the sample size of this study was large and the sur -
vey was extensive, there were several limitations to the analysis 
and generalizability of the study. It should be acknowledged 
that this study is exploratory; there are currently no widely 
endorsed clinical guidelines to diagnose misophonia. This study 
used unvalidated hyperacusis and misophonia evaluative tools 
out of necessity. At the time of this study’ s conception, there 
were no validated tools to evaluate misophonia and the hyper -
acusis questionnaire has not been validated in English. Fackrell 
et al. (2015) attempted to validate the HQ in a tinnitus popula-
tion but could not confirm the structure of the questionnaire. 
They recommended the English-language HQ be validated in 
the general population.
The variables used for tinnitus and hearing loss were based 
entirely on patient self-report and the number of positive indi-
cations for tinnitus seemed exceptionally large for a young col-
legiate sample (n = 300, age range = 18 to 25 years). This may 
be due in part to the wording of the survey questions, which did 
not specify what type of “ringing in the ears” constituted a par -
ticipant having tinnitus (e.g., chronic, constant, nonbothersome, 
etc.). In addition, based on hyperacusis self-report, a similar 
overestimation was observed (n = 259, reported having hyper -
acusis). It should be noted that respondents who experience 
hearing health conditions, including tinnitus and hyperacusis, 
may have been more motivated to answer the survey since the 
content is closely related to their personal experience, which 
could also have contributed to the large amount of self-reported 
comorbidities in this sample. Although hearing loss is one of the 
hearing health comorbidities examined for the purpose of this 
study, the number of participants who reported having hearing 
loss was small (n = 35; 3.23% of the total sample; age range 
= 18 to 25 years). This is expected for a young, healthy colle-
giate population, but nonetheless limits the reliability of analy-
sis when considering misophonia’ s relationship to hearing loss. 
This sample was not optimized to examine participants with 
hearing loss.
All students recruited for this study belonged to a very spe-
cific age range, were attending a prestigious 4-year university at 
the time of their response, and the majority came from highly 
educated home backgrounds and high socioeconomic statuses 
which inherently limits potential generalizability to the general 
population.

Future Directions for Research and Clinical Practice
Moving forward, research into decreased sound tolerance 
disorders should continue to examine hearing loss, tinnitus, and 
hyperacusis in relation to misophonia. Developing a standard-
ized set of diagnostic guidelines for misophonia is crucial for 
both people with misophonia and the health professionals who 
care for them. Clinically speaking, it is key that healthcare pro-
fessionals who may interact with people experiencing misopho-
nia are educated on similar decreased sound tolerance disorders 
and comorbidities that may accompany misophonia so that this 
can be accounted for in the evaluation and treatment of their 
symptoms.
Individuals with misophonia may seek out hearing health 
professionals for help with their symptoms. Being aware of 
their strong reaction to auditory stimuli, they may appropriately 
consult an audiologist for evaluation and counseling due to their 
expertise in hearing and auditory-related concerns. Although a 
clinical diagnosis of misophonia may involve a semi-structured 
interview (Schröder et al. 2013), an interprofessional approach 
involving audiologists will often include ruling out associated 
neurological or psychiatric disorders and other decreased sound 
tolerance disorders like hyperacusis (Swedo et al. 2022).
It is within an audiologist’ s scope of practice to determine if 
a patient’ s symptoms stem from misophonia, a combination of 
disorders like loudness hyperacusis which may co-occur with 
misophonia, or a different condition entirely, in which case a 
physician or otolaryngologist would be necessary for further 
evaluation to determine the root cause of the patient’ s symp-
toms. Some audiologists consider misophonia to be akin to 
“annoyance hyperacusis” and treat them accordingly (Tyler et 
al. 2014). It is important that audiologists identify patients who 
may have misophonia and counsel them on treatment options 
or appropriately refer them. Too often patients with misophonic 
symptoms are passed between clinicians without any diagnosis 
or treatment, which can leave those who experience misophonia 
feeling frustrated or defeated. It is crucial that audiologists feel 
comfortable and confident assessing a patient’ s symptoms and 
getting them the help they need. It is also important to acknowl-
edge that, whereas cognitive-behavioral therapy is available and 
used to treat misophonia therapeutically, there are currently no 
evidence-based treatments available for the disorder.
Continued education for audiologists, psychologists, allied 
health professionals, and the public on the disorder is needed to 
increase awareness and clinical competence. Validation of new 
and existing evaluative tools for misophonia (including those 
focused on the functional impact of misophonia, similar to what 
has been done in the case of tinnitus) should take place and small-
scale studies should continue to be replicated to confirm findings.
Conclusions
Around 8 to 20% of this study’ s sample reported symp-
toms consistent with the formulated criteria for “clinically 
significant” misophonia. Results of data analysis indicated that 
misophonia was more likely to affect people who had loudness 
hyperacusis, with increasing severity of misophonia symptoms 
correlated with worse hyperacusis. In addition, misophonia 
symptoms were reported to be more severe in women than in 
men and in those with self-reported tinnitus. The findings of 
the present study advance our knowledge about misophonia 
and other sound sensitivity disorders, but further research is 
needed to establish a well-defined and universally agreed-upon characterization of misophonia and loudness hyperacusis and 
their differences for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.
