Summary  
Misophonia is a recently identified and poorly understood condition in which a person perceives 
an innocuous stimulus such as eating, sniffing or hair twirling, and experiences a strong negative 
emotional response and physiological distress . Some experts consider misophonia an emotional 
response disorder while others consider misophonia a n emotional and physical reflex disorder. 
The Safe  and Sound Protocol  (SSP)  is a five -hour music listening program based on polyvagal 
theory designed in improve autonomic regulation , reduce auditory hypersensitivity , and increase 
social engagement . A brief misophonia therapy with emphasis on relaxation an d the five -hour 
SSP listening program was provided to nine participants . The median reduction in misophonia 
severity was 15% on the Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire and 25% on the Misophonia 
Response Scale . Further investigation of SSP as a component of  treatment for misophonia is 
warranted.

Safe and Sound Protocol with Brief Therapy for Misophonia: A Pilot Study  
Misophonia was first identified as a condition in 1997 and is not currently included in t he DSM -
5 or the ICD -11 (Dozier & Mitchell, 2023) . Misophonia is an under -studied  condition in which a 
person has an extreme reaction to subtle stimuli  (for example,  mouth or nasal sounds  or hair 
twirling ), and there are no empirically validated treatments for misophonia . Misophonia is 
generally viewed as a poorly understood  emotional response disorder  (Swedo et al., 2022) and by 
others as a physical and emotional reflex disorder (Dozier, Lopez, & Pearson, 2017) . A recent 
theory of misophonia provides the model of misophonia as a physical and emotional reflex 
disorder and is shown in Figure 1 (Dozier & Mitchell, 2023) .  
Figure 1. Mitchell -Dozier model of misophonia. (1) Anticipatory anxiety and avoidance, (2) the 
misophonic trigger stimulus elicits the i nitial physical reflex (e.g., muscle flinch), (3) intense emotional 
response of misophonia, physiological distress, thoughts, urges and emotion driven behaviors while the 
trigger continues, (4) coping responses after the trigger, including covert mental re view and overt 
behavior, and (5) environmental response and internal and external consequences. The dotted connection 
indicates phase 3 contributes to strengthening of the initial physical reflex, phases 2 to 5 contribute to 
strengthening anticipatory anxi ety and avoidance of phase 1 and phase 5 contributes to strengthening 
phases 3 and 4. (Source: Dozier & Mitchell, 2023)  
 
This model of misophonia is used by therapists associated or trained by Misophonia Institute to 
provide treatment for misophonia . These treatments include Sequent Repatterning Hypnotherapy 
developed by Chris Pearson, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy – Misophonia developed by Nate 
Mitchell, and Relaxation and Counterconditioning Therapy developed by Tom Dozier.  
The Safe & Sou nd Protocol (SSP ; Unyte Health, 2023 ) is a  practical application of polyvagal 
theory, designed to help people learn to attain a grounded physiological and emotional state 
where they feel safe, connected, calm, and social . It has been shown to improve  audit ory 
hypersensitivity,  behavioral state regulation, and social engagement behaviors through five hours 
of listening to  SSP specially -filtered music  with a safe listening partner . There are thousands of 
trained SSP providers and tens -of-thousands of people w ho have completed SSP . Numerous 
clinical trials of SSP have demonstrated significant improvements in autonomic state regulation, 
sensory processing, mental health, and social engagement. The results of data collected on SSP 
delivery system have found impro vements in autonomic state regulation, sensory processing, 
social engagement, and functional skills. SSP is not a stand -alone treatment package . It is to be

provided in conjunction with other therapeutic treatment.  For more information on SSP see

We hypothesized  that a combination of SSP and brief, basic misophonia treatment will provide a 
reduction in misophonia severity  for study participants . 
Method  
Participants  
The opportunity to participate in this pilot study was posted on Facebook misophonia groups and 
in the Misophonia Institute email newsletter . Interested individuals were emailed an Informed 
Cons ent document .  
Nine  individuals signed up and completed the study . Demographics are as follows: 7 female, 2 
male, age range 15 to 60 years (mean 40.2, sd 15.4), race white.  
Procedure  
Participants were informed that they could choose an SSP provider of their choice or work wit h 
Tom Dozier, the principle investigator of this study . All participants chose to work with Tom 
Dozier . After returning the informed consent, each person was added as a client on the SSP 
provider portal . The misophonia severity measures were emailed  to the  individual as fillable PDF 
documents and returned via email . The SSP i ntake assessment was sent via the SSP provider 
portal and completed online.  
Once the SSP assessment and misophonia severity measures were completed, an initial session 
was scheduled . The meeting was conducted on HIPAA compliant Zoom. The initial session 
included a discussion on autonomic regulation, how the SSP has been shown to improved 
autonomic regulation, and an overview of misophonia theory . Individuals were also tested  for an 
initial physical reflex (IPR; see Figure 1, phase 2)  to determine if they could perceive the IPR 
and determine the affected  muscle or part of the body , using the procedure from Dozier & 
Morrison (2017) . Participants were encouraged to breathe and r elax muscles when they might be 
exposed to a trigger, and to breathe and relax muscles if there was an ongoing trigger.  
SSP sessions require a safe listening partner for co -regulation . Five participants listened with a 
family member, one with a friend, two with their dog, and one with  Tom Dozier via Zoom . 
Remote (not in the therapist’s office) SSP listening sessions are provided via the Un yte ILS app. 
Titration, or the rate of providing SSP listening, is important to ensure  the listener does not 
experience dysregulation . Unyte recommendation for listening is 30 -minute sessions . Unyte has 
an SSP slogan of, “You can go too fast, but you can’t go too slow. ” An initial 5 -minute session 
was conducted in the first session with Tom Dozier. All participants remained calm during this 
short listening session . Participants were instructed to conduct a 5 -minute listening session with 
their listening partner that day , and then complete a 10 -minute listening session every day, 
provided they did not experience dysregulation during the session . If they experienced 
dysregulation during the session, they were to stop that session, and continue SSP with shorter 
sessions. (N one of the participants experience any dysregulation).  Once the first hour of SSP was 
complete, the session time was increased to 20 minutes per day for the remaining four hours of 
SSP.  Participants were allowed to use shorter listening sessions and to ski p days.  
Participants were asked to have a follow -up session the next week, additional sessions if they 
desired, and a final session after they completed SSP.  The daily relaxation and especially

relaxing when exposed to triggers was emphasized in all sessio ns. After completing SSP, the 
misophonia severity measures were emailed to the participant and returned by email.  
Measures  
Misophonia  severity questionnaires included the Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ)  
and the Misophonia Response Scale (MRS) . The MAQ consists of 21 questions about the 
negative impact of misophonia on the person’s activities, thoughts, and feelings  (Dozer 2015a ). 
Each question has a 0 to 3 rating, with 0 being “not at all” and 3 being “almost all of the time ,” 
and a maxim um possible sum score of 63. The Misophonia Response Scale  (MRS) rates 
emotional and physical response severity and how misophonia interferes  in 5 domains of life on 
a 1-7 scale.  The MRS also includes factors of frequency of triggers, time to recover from a 
trigger , and avoidance. The maximum MRS score is 49, and historical average severity of those 
seeking treatment is 20.  Both the MAQ and MRS are validated measures of misophonia  severity.  
(Altin et al., 2022; Dibb et al., 2021 )  
Results  
Misophonia severity response to  treatment is shown in Figures 2  and 3 and in Table 1 . The data 
is ordered from most to least  severe , based on MAQ score.  The average point reduction was 5.3 
for the MAQ and 4.5 for the MRS . The average percentage reduction in severity was 25% on the 
MAQ and 28% on the MRS.

Discussion  
Misophonia is an under -researched  condition that causes great distress in individual s, and there 
are no empirically validated  treatments . Even the basic understanding of what misophonia 
actually “is” is debated . In this study, participants received  the stan dard SSP protocol, along with 
basic education on misophonia, identifying the initial physical reflex (IPR), and the importance 
of relaxing muscles before, during, and after misophonia triggers.

Eight participants reported a moderate or better positive res ponse to treatment, but most still 
experienced misophonia triggers  upon completion of this study . Only  one participant , with the 
lowest  misophonia severity , reported no longer experiencing triggers.  One participant reported a 
slight worsening of misophonia . This person was the only participant  unable to identify an IPR 
response and the only one that received SSP with a listening partner via Zoom. There were no 
negative responses toward the SSP listening experience, and all reported experiencing the calm, 
peaceful feel ings. Several reported feeling more connected to their listening partner or a desire 
for more social engagement.  The median response to treatment was a reduction of 15% on the 
MAQ and 25% on the MRS misophonia severity scales.  
Limitations  
There are several limitations with this study. First , as a pilot study, this study was not conducted 
under the oversight of an Institutional Review Board. Second , measures of misophonia severity 
are based on self -report,  which is known to h ave reliability issues.  Third , the number of 
participants was small. Finally,  the study included both SSP and a brief treatment for 
misophonia, so the contribution  of each is unknown . 
Conclusion  
SSP was very well received by all participants, and a modes t level of reduction in misophonia 
severity was reported by most participants . SSP is a low -cost, low -risk and pleasant intervention 
and may be reasonably considered as a component of misophonia treatment . Based on these 
results, m ore research on SSP as a treatment for misophonia treatment is warranted.
