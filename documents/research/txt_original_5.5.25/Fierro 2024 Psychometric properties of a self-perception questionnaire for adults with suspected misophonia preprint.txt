Abstract
Misophonia is a disorder of decreased tolerance to specic sounds or stimuli associated with such sounds, called triggers. The
aim was to validate a questionnaire on self-perception of the type of sound, visual identication, and origin of sounds in adults
with suspected misophonia by Spanish-speaking people. An interview was conducted with a total of 395 participants, divided
into four distinct blocks of questions: the trigger of misophonia, the visual identication of gestures or actions related to selective
sounds, the emotional closeness between listener and sender, and the impact on the daily personal relationships of the person
with misophonia. Each block used classical test theory to factorially validate the instrument. The rst group of questions
gave as a result four factors: mouth and throat sounds, environmental sounds, material sounds, and pronunciation sounds
(Cronbach's alpha = 0.929; KMO = 0.894). The second group identied two dimensions of reaction to actions and gestures,
one related to movements of the mouth and throat and the second to body movements or exaggerated gesticulation (Cronbach's
alpha = 0.840; KMO = 0.819). The third block linked low and high emotional closeness factors (Cronbach's alpha = 0.690;
KMO = 0.633). The fourth block obtained a factor for daily chores and another for aective relationships (Cronbach's alpha
= 0.861; KMO = 0.820). The questionnaire oers valuable insights into the nature of misophonia, and the necessity for further
research in this eld. These ndings emphasize the importance of developing a comprehensive understanding of misophonia to
enhance diagnosis.
