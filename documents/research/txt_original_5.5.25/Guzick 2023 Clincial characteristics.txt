Background: There is little information on the clinical presentation, functional impact, and psychiatric characteristics of misophonia in youth, an increasingly recognized syndrome characterized by high emotional reactivity to certain sounds and associated visual stimuli.

Method: One-hundred-two  youth  (8 -17  years-old)  with  misophonia  and  their  parents  were  recruited  and compared with 94 youth with anxiety disorders. Participants completed validated assessments of misophonia severity, quality of life, as well as psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses.

Results: The most common misophonia triggers included eating (96 %), breathing (84 %), throat sounds (66 %), and tapping (54 %). Annoyance/irritation, verbal aggression, avoidance behavior, and family impact were nearly universal.  Misophonia  severity  was  associated  with  internalizing  symptoms,  child-reported  externalizing  behaviors, and poorer quality of life. High rates of comorbidity with internalizing and neurodevelopmental disorders  were  found.  Quality  of  life  and  externalizing  behaviors  were  not  significantly  different  between misophonia and anxiety samples; internalizing symptoms and autism characteristics were significantly higher among youth with anxiety disorders.

Limitations: This self-selected sample was characterized by limited multicultural diversity.

Conclusions: This study presents misophonia as a highly impairing psychiatric syndrome. Future interdisciplinary work  should  clarify  the  mechanisms  of  misophonia,  establish  evidence-based  treatments,  and  extend  these findings to randomly sampled and more culturally diverse populations.

## 1. Introduction

Misophonia  is  characterized  by  strong,  unpleasant  emotional  reactions  to  certain  sounds  and  associated  visual  stimuli  (Lewin  et  al., 2021; Potgieter et al., 2019; Rosenthal et al., 2021; Swedo et al., 2022). Although not a formal diagnosis in the DSM-5 or ICD-11, misophonia has been increasingly studied and recognized in clinical practice since it was first described in the early 2000's by audiologists treating individuals with decreased sound tolerance (Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2000; Potgieter et al., 2019; Swedo et al., 2022). Misophonia symptoms can arise at any age, though most retrospective studies of adults with misophonia suggest onset during childhood or adolescence (Claiborn et al., 2020; Jager  et  al.,  2020;  Potgieter  et  al.,  2019).  Unfortunately,  there  is minimal  research  on  misophonia  across  the  lifespan,  but  especially among youth. Without systematic data on the clinical presentation of misophonia in children and adolescents, researchers and clinicians will be  unable  to  develop  an  understanding  of  this  condition  and  its treatment.

Adults  with  misophonia  experience  disturbing  and  often  intense emotional  reactions  to  sound  triggers  including  annoyance,  disgust, anger, hatred, panic, and aggression (Claiborn et al., 2020; Jager et al., 2020; Potgieter et al., 2019; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018). Physical reactions may include muscle tension, heavy breathing, as well as physical or verbal outbursts (Claiborn et al., 2020; Jager et al., 2020; Potgieter et al., 2019; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018). In several studies examining adult  samples  comprised  mostly  of  females  with  moderate  to  severe

A.G. Guzick et al.

misophonia symptoms (Claiborn et al., 2020; Jager et al., 2020; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018; Wu et al., 2016), the most common sound triggers were oral or eating sounds in addition to nasal or breathing sounds, and repetitive tapping sounds (e.g., with hands, keyboards, or pens) (Claiborn et al., 2020; Jager et al., 2020; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018; Wu et al., 2016). Almost all affected individuals report severe irritation or anger with triggers and hyper-focus on sounds, with less common emotional responses including disgust and panic (Jager et al., 2020). Many others experience feelings of powerlessness and loss of control (Jager et al., 2020).

Four studies have investigated comorbid psychiatric diagnoses; in one clinic-based study, 28 % of 575 adults with misophonia experienced a  comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, most commonly mood (10 %) and anxiety disorders (9 %), as well as higher-than-expected rates of ADHD (5 %) (Jager et al., 2020). Erfanian et al. (2019) found that among 52 adults with misophonia, 40 % experienced a psychiatric disorder, most commonly  posttraumatic  stress  disorder  (15  %),  OCD  (11  %),  and anorexia  (10  %).  In  another  study,  individuals  with  misophonia  had significantly higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity than adults with general non-misophonic auditory over-responsivity and healthy adults, with 71 % of those with misophonia experiencing a comorbid psychiatric disorder, most commonly panic disorder (19 %), generalized anxiety  disorder  (15  %),  social  anxiety  disorder  (13  %),  and  major depressive disorder (12 %) (Siepsiak et al., 2022). Finally, a study with 207  adults  with  misophonia,  the  most  common  comorbidities  were anxiety disorders (57 %), major depressive disorder (50 % lifetime; 7 % current),  attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (15  %),  and  posttraumatic  stress  disorder  (16  %)  (Rosenthal  et  al.,  2022).The  most common psychiatric symptoms in adults with misophonia include mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder traits (Claiborn et al., 2020; Jager et al., 2020).

Case series data among children with misophonia suggest this syndrome  often  presents  with  co-occuring  psychiatric  disorders,  though these studies are limited by very small samples (Dover and McGuire, 2021; McGuire et al., 2015; Muller et al., 2018; Reid et al., 2016; Sarigedik and Yurteri, 2021). Rinaldi et al. (2022a) identified 15 children with  elevated  misophonia  symptoms  through  population  screening rather  than  self-identification  or  presentation  for  treatment.  In  this sample, 9 participants were female with a mean age of 11.7 years and 6 participants  were  male  with  a  mean  age  of  11  years  (Rinaldi  et  al., 2022a). These children showed poorer health-related quality-of-life than peers and higher traits associated with anxiety and OCD (Rinaldi et al., 2022a) as well as autistic traits across several social-cognitive domains, including attention-switching, communication, social skills, attention to detail, and imagination (Rinaldi et al., 2022b).

To address the absence of data describing misophonia in youth, this study evaluated clinical data from a sample of 102 children and adolescents meeting the proposed diagnostic criteria for misophonia (Swedo et al., 2022). First, the study aimed to describe the clinical phenomenology of youth with misophonia, including age, gender distribution, types and frequency of misophonia triggers, misophonia-related emotions, frequency of aggression responses, avoidance behaviors, and areas and degree of impairment. It was expected that anger and irritability would be the most common emotional experiences, eating and breathing the most common trigger sounds, and that the majority of the sample would  be  female.  Second,  the  study  evaluated  associations  between misophonia severity and psychiatric symptoms as well as quality of life. It  was  expected  that  this  sample  of  children  and  adolescents  with misophonia  would  have  high  rates  of  comorbid  mood,  anxiety,  and obsessive-compulsive  disorders  as  well  as  elevated  autism  spectrum symptoms based on strong associations between misophonia and psychiatric  symptoms in existing reports on misophonia in children and adolescents as well as those in adults (Cusack et al., 2018; Erfanian et al., 2019; Jager et al., 2020; Rinaldi et al., 2022a; Rinaldi et al., 2022b). Exploratory  analyses  investigated  whether  youth  with  misophonia differed significantly in these factors compared to youth with anxiety disorders.

## 2. Methods

## 2.1. Procedures

Youth with suspected misophonia were recruited via online advertisements, misophonia/anxiety-focused social media pages, as well as clinical and professional networks. Youth with suspected anxiety disorders were also recruited to serve as a non-misophonia clinical comparison group, as these disorders are also characterized by heightened emotional  reactivity  to  specific  stimuli.  The  majority  of  participants were recruited via online advertisements.

Participants and their parents assented/consented to participate in the study during an initial video call. Inclusion criteria for both samples were: 1) being 8 -17 years, 2) parent willingness to participate, 3) English fluency. For the misophonia group, an additional criterion was: clinically significant misophonia symptoms based on a score of at least 10 on the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S), indicating at least moderate misophonia (Schroder et al., 2013). For the anxiety group, ¨ additional inclusion criteria were: 1) a Parent-report Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) T-Score of at least 60, 2) an anxiety disorder diagnosis on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID), and 3) a score of ≤ 4 on the AMISO-S, corresponding with subclinical misophonia symptoms.

After  consent  and  screening,  participants  were  scheduled  for  a separate  assessment  video  that  included  online  questionnaires  and  a clinical interview which included the Misophonia Assessment Interview (MAI) (Lewin, 2020; Lewin et al., 2021) and the MINI-KID (Sheehan et al., 2010) Interviewers were research coordinators with a bachelor's degree in psychology or a related field (e.g., neuroscience) or doctoral students  in  professional  psychology.  Training  included  didactic  presentations on the MINI-KID and MAI, observation and co-rating of assessments with a trained rater, and weekly supervision with a licensed psychologist to ensure validity and reliability of assessments.

The  Institutional  Review  Board  at  Baylor  College  of  Medicine approved the study. All portions of the study were completed virtually.

## 2.2. Participants

One-hundred and twelve youth with suspected misophonia and 140 youth with suspected anxiety disorders were recruited. Of the 112 youth in the misophonia group, 102 were included in analyses; of the 140 in the  anxiety  group,  94  were  included.  Reasons  for  exclusion  in  the misophonia group included too mild misophonia symptoms (Amsterdam Misophonia Scale [A-MISO-S] score &lt; 10), n = 5 (5 %), or failed attempts to schedule an assessment visit after the initial informed consent video  call, n = 5  (5  %).  Reasons  for  exclusion  in  the  anxiety  group included: MASC score below the clinical cutoff, n = 26 (19 %), A-MISO-S score too high, 9 (6 %), no anxiety disorder as assessed on the MINI-KID, n = 9 (6 %), and failed attempts to schedule an assessment visit after the initial informed consent video call, n = 2 (1 %).

## 2.3. Measures

## 2.3.1. Misophonia characteristics

The Misophonia Assessment Interview (Lewin, 2020) is a series of questions evaluating symptoms of sound sensitivity, enhanced emotional  and  physical  reactions  to  sound  triggers,  and  degrees  of avoidance or interference with daily activities. Based on the initially proposed diagnostic criteria for misophonia by Schroder et al. (2013), it ¨ asks about specific sound triggers, emotional responses, and avoidance behaviors. It was developed to follow the format of a commonly used diagnostic  interview  using  the  proposed  diagnostic  criteria  of  misophonia for an ongoing randomized clinical trial separate from this study

A.G. Guzick et al.

(Lewin  et  al.,  2021).  This  assessment  was  only  administered  to  the misophonia  sample.  Responses  to  items  on  the  MAI  are  presented descriptively to characterize the presentation of misophonia in youth.

strong  psychometric  properties  and  high  internal  consistency  in  this sample, SRS-SCI: α = 0.92; SRS-RRB: α = 0.82.

## 2.3.6. Quality of life

PQLES-Q. The pediatric version of the Short Form of the Quality of Life  Enjoyment  and  Satisfaction  Questionnaire  is  a  self-report  questionnaire with items scored on a 1 -5 Likert scale that assesses quality of life among children and adolescents (Endicott et al., 2006). It has shown strong internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity among both children and adolescents (Endicott et al., 2006). Internal consistency in this sample was α = 0.89.

## 2.4. Analysis plan

First, data were evaluated for patterns of missingness and conformity to normal distribution assumptions. Missing data were rare (two YSR, one  CBCL-Internalizing  subscale,  one  parent-report  MAQ,  one  SRSRRB),  and  thus  completer-only  analyses  were  conducted.  Data  were not found to show significant skewness or kurtosis, with all skewness and kurtosis statistics falling within GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 and + 2, suggesting they would be appropriate for parametric analyses (George and Mallery, 2010).

To evaluate the clinical characteristics of youth with misophonia, descriptive  information  from  the  Misophonia  Assessment  Interview were  presented,  including  frequencies  of  different  trigger  sounds, avoidance behaviors,  aggression  responses,  and  emotional  responses. Demographic information was also presented. To evaluate the psychiatric morbidity of the sample, frequencies of different psychiatric diagnoses were presented as well as norm referenced scale scores on the CBCL, YSR, and SRS-2. One-sample  -tests comparing mean t-scores for t each subscale with a population mean of 50 were conducted to estimate significant differences with typical populations. Independent samples  t tests evaluated differences in CBCL, YSR, and SRS-2 scores between the misophonia and anxiety groups. Recruitment targets were based on a power analysis for a cluster analysis (in preparation). For this study, given power = 0.80, alpha = 0.01 (for all analyses, p &lt; .01 was interpreted as significant to minimize family-wise error), and sample sizes of 102 and 94, this study was powered to detect a medium between-group effect of d = 0.48. Within the misophonia sample, partial correlations controlling for age and gender (male vs. non-male) between misophonia symptom  severity  (using  the  A-MISO-S  and  MAQ)  and  psychiatric symptom scales (CBCL and YSR), quality of life (PQ-LES-Q), and autistic features (SRS-2) were conducted. With 102 participants, given power = 0.80  and  alpha = 0.01,  this  study  was  powered  to  detect  small-tomedium correlations ( r = 0.33).

## 3. Results

## 3.1. Sample demographics

The majority of the misophonia sample identified as White (87 %) and female (68 %). The mean age of the sample was 13.7 years ( SD = 2.5) and the mean age of misophonia onset was 8.8 years ( SD = 3.0). The majority of the anxiety sample also identified as White (71 %) and female (57 %), with a mean age of 12.4 years. The misophonia group was significantly older and had a significantly higher proportion of participants who identified as White (see Table 1). A summary of demographic information is presented in Table 1.

## 3.2. Clinical characteristics of misophonia in youth

Among youth with misophonia, the most common trigger sounds included: eating sounds (people eating/chewing/swallowing/lip smacking/slurping/teeth  tapping), n = 98  (96  %),  breathing  sounds (people breathing/sniffing/exhaling/inhaling/yawning), n = 86 (84 %), throat noises (people making throat clearing sounds/coughing), n = 67 (66 %), tapping (people tapping with hands, feet, or object), n = 55 (54

## 2.3.2. Misophonia severity

The A-MISO-S, adapted from the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) (Goodman, 1989; Goodman et al., 1989), is a commonly used measure of misophonia severity (Schroder et al., 2013) that has ¨ shown strong psychometric properties as a self-report measure in college students, including good internal consistency and a single-factor structure that explained 45 % of the variance in item responses (Naylor et al., 2021). It includes six  0 -4  Likert  scale  items  assessing  time  taken  by symptoms, functional impairment, emotional distress, resistance against symptoms, control over symptoms, and avoidance. It was administered as  a  child-report  measure  in  this  study,  which  has  showed  adequate psychometric properties in youth with misophonia, including a clear single-factor structure as well as adequate convergent validity and internal consistency (Cervin et al., 2022). Because it was developed for adults, to administer the measure in a developmentally-tailored manner, the measure was presented to youth with a trained assessor present to provide additional clarifications on items when youth had questions. Item 4 was not included in the total score because this item does not contribute to overall severity and the measure has been shown to be more internally consistent without it (Cervin et al., 2022); in this sample, internal consistency was α = 0.68 with all 6 items and α = 0.76 with 5 items, so the 5-item version was used. The MAQ aids in measuring misophonia severity by evaluating the negative impact of misophonia symptoms on an individual's activities, thoughts, and emotions (Dozier, 2015; Johnson and Dozier, 2013). It includes 21 items scored on a 0 -3 Likert scale and has also shown strong psychometric properties for both the  child-reported  (C-MAQ)  and  parent-reported  (P-MAQ)  versions, including strong internal consistency and convergent validity (Cervin et al., 2022). The overall MAQ misophonia scale was used in the present study and showed high internal consistency in this sample; C-MAQ: α = 0.94; P-MAQ: α = 0.93.

## 2.3.3. Psychiatric diagnoses

Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed with the MINI-KID, a commonly used and well-validated psychiatric interview based on DSM-5 and ICD11 criteria. The MINI-KID has shown strong psychometric properties in general and clinical populations (Boyle et al., 2017; Duncan et al., 2018; Sheehan  et  al.,  2010).  It  is  designed  to  be  a  streamlined  diagnostic interview that can be administered by raters with a range of training under the supervision of an experienced clinician (Sheehan et al., 2010).

## 2.3.4. Emotional and behavioral functioning

The parent-report Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and child-report Youth  Self  Report  (YSR)  are  well-validated,  broadband  measures  of childhood  psychopathology  that  include  112  0 -2  Likert  scale  items (Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001). The CBCL/YSR generates internalizing and externalizing scales that correspond to mood/anxiety symptoms and disruptive behavior symptoms, respectively (Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001). Both subscales across child- and parent-report showed high internal consistency in this sample; CBCL-externalizing: α = 0.89; CBCLinternalizing: α = 0.89; YSR-externalizing: α = 0.83; YSRinternalizing: α = 0.90.

## 2.3.5. Autism spectrum features

The  Social  Responsiveness  Scale,  Second  Edition  (SRS-2)  is  a commonly used, well-validated evaluation of autism features that includes 65 items scored on a 0 -3 Likert scale (Bruni, 2014; Constantino and Gruber, 2012). It contains sub-domains scoring social communication and interaction (SRS-SCI) as well as restricted or repetitive behavior (SRS-RRB) corresponding with the symptom domains of autism spectrum  disorder  described  in  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of Mental  Disorders  (Constantino  and  Gruber,  2012).  The  SRS-2  shows

%), specific language sounds or tones, rustling sounds (rustling/clattering of paper, plastic, or aluminum foil), n = 37 (36 %), and environmental sounds (clocks, engines, appliances), n = 29 (28 %). See Fig. 1 for a summary.

Most  youth  with  misophonia  reported  experiencing  annoyance/ irritation, n = 99 (97 %) or anger, n = 97 (95 %) when hearing (or anticipating  hearing)  trigger  noises.  Other  emotional  responses  or anticipatory emotions were also frequently endorsed, including a general feeling of distress, n = 95 (93 %), worry/anxiety, n = 81 (79 %), disgust, n = 69  (68  %),  and  sadness/depression, n = 44  (43  %). Importantly, emotional responses were assessed as in response to or in

anticipation of hearing triggers without specifically distinguishing between them. A high portion also endorsed a history of aggressive responses,  most  frequently  verbal  aggression, n = 87  (85  %),  though physical aggression was also common (including aggressive outbursts or damage to objects/property), n = 51 (50 %). Avoidance of specific situations was common as well, most frequently family members, n = 82 (80 %), and meals, n = 77 (76 %). Most of the sample endorsed specific modifications, anticipatory avoidance, or reactive avoidance behaviors, most commonly covering ears with hands, n = 94 (92 %), using protective equipment like headphones, n = 93 (91 %), or eating privately or with special arrangements (e.g., apart from siblings), n = 86 (84 %). A summary of these data is presented in Fig. 2.

## 3.3. Psychiatric morbidity

Psychiatric morbidity in the misophonia sample was high, with 81 participants (79 %) meeting criteria for at least one psychiatric diagnosis. Almost half of the sample experienced a major depressive disorder (current or past), n = 48 (47 %), with 15 (15 %) experiencing a current depressive episode at the time of assessment. Nearly half were experiencing a current anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder, n = 46 (45 %); the most commonly anxiety disorders were social anxiety disorder, n = 31  (30  %)  and  generalized  anxiety  disorder n = 27  (27  %). Obsessive-compulsive disorder occurred in 8 participants (8 %). Other common diagnoses included attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, n = 21 (21 %) and chronic tic disorders, n = 13 (13 %). Please see Fig. 3 for a summary of non-misophonia primary and total psychiatric diagnoses in the sample.

Youth were found to have clinically elevated internalizing symptoms per  both  youth  and  parent-report,  YSR-Internalizing  M  (SD) = 67.1 (14.2);  CBCL-Internalizing  M  (SD) = 69.8  (16.5).  These  values  were significantly higher than what would be expected in a randomly sampled population,  YSR-Internalizing: t (100) = 12.12, d = 1.21, p &lt; .001; CBCL-Internalizing: t (99) = 11.95, d = 1.20, p &lt; .001. Using the CBCL cutoff  of  a  T-score  of  70  representing  the  clinical  range,  clinically elevated internalizing symptoms were reported in 44 youth with misophonia (43 %) based on child-report and 46 youth (45 %) based on parent-report.  On  average,  externalizing  symptoms  were  in  the  nonclinical range per child- or parent-report, YSR-Externalizing M (SD) = 55.4 (8.4); CBCL-Externalizing  M  (SD) = 52.0 (9.8). The  YSRExternalizing subscale was significantly higher than what might be expected in a typically developing sample, t (100) = 6.51, d = 0.65, p &lt; .001, though the CBCL-Externalizing was not, t (99) = 2.03, d = 0.20, p = .045.  Three  youth  with  misophonia  (3  %)  self-reported  clinically elevated externalizing symptoms and six (6 %) parent-reported clinically elevated externalizing symptoms.

On average, youth with misophonia did not show elevated scores on the SRS-SCI, M  SD ( ) = 55.0 (9.3), or the SRS-RRB, M  SD ( ) = 53.9 (10.1), though these values were significantly higher than what would be expected in a randomly sampled population with a mean of 50, SRS-SCI, t (101) = 5.49, d = 0.54, p &lt; .001;  (100) t = 3.91, d = 0.39, p &lt; .001. Using a T-score of 70 as representing the clinical range, 8 (8 %) were found to have clinically elevated scores on the SRS-SCI and 11 (11 %) on the SRSRRB.

The most commonly endorsed areas of misophonia-related impairment were family life/relationships, n = 95 (93 %), interacting with people, n = 51 (50 %), learning/homework, n = 44 (43 %), and being in public, n = 41 (40 %). A complete summary of these data is presented in Fig. 2.

3.3.1. Comparing psychiatric symptoms in anxiety and misophonia samples For all comparisons, age-normed T-scores were used. The anxiety group had significantly higher scores on both the YSR-Internalizing, t (191) = 3.49, p &lt; .001, d = 0.50, and CBCL-Internalizing subscales, t (192) = 3.52, p &lt; .001, d = 0.51.

A linear regression was conducted controlling for race (White vs. non-White) and an identical  pattern  of  significance  emerged.  Specifically, when controlling for race, misophonia sample membership was associated with less severe CBCL-Internalizing, β = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.26, p &lt; .001, Δ R 2 = 0.064, YSR-Internalizing, β =GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.24, p &lt; .001, Δ R 2 = 0.056, SRSSCI, β =GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.27, p &lt; .001, Δ R 2 = 0.068, and SRS-RRB scores, β = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.22, p = .002, Δ R 2 = 0.047. There was no significant association with CBCLExternalizing, β =GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.14, p = .051, Δ R 2 = 0.020, YSR-Externalizing, β = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.11, p = .13, Δ R 2 = 0.012, or PQLES-Q scores, β = GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 0.038, p = .61, Δ R 2 = 0.001.

onset was just younger than 9, which aligns with the lower end of the estimates that have been reported in adults (Claiborn et al., 2020; Jager et al., 2020; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018), as would be expected in a study focused on youth.

## 3.4. Clinical correlates

Within the misophonia sample, when controlling for age and gender, both the P-MAQ and C-MAQ were associated with a number of other clinical  measures,  including  the  YSR-Internalizing  subscale,  the  YSRExternalizing  subscale,  the  CBCL-Internalizing  subscale,  the  MASC, and the P-QLES-Q. The A-MISO-S was not significantly associated with any of the tested variables, though was modestly associated with the following variables at a trend level: YSR-Internalizing, CBCL-Externalizing, SRS-RRB, and PQLES-Q. See Table 2 for a summary.

## 4. Discussion

This  study  described  the  clinical  presentation  of  misophonia  in  a large  cohort  of  children  and  adolescents.  Consistent  with  studies  in adults (Claiborn et al., 2020; Jager et al., 2020; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018; Wu et al., 2016), the most prevalent trigger noises included those related  to  eating,  breathing,  or  making  throat  noises,  though  other triggers were common as well (e.g., tapping, paper rustling). The most common  emotional  responses  were  anger  and  annoyance/irritation, though there was a significant mix of emotional responses, with participants also describing anxiety, disgust, and sadness as well in reaction to or in anticipation of trigger noises. Avoidance behaviors were nearly ubiquitous,  with  the  most  frequently  endorsed  behaviors  including covering  ears  (with  hands  or  noise-blocking  devices  such  as  headphones), avoiding places involving eating, and avoiding specific people, most commonly family members. Nearly all youth had become verbally aggressive  in  response  to  trigger  noises  at  some  point,  and  half  had engaged in physical aggression. Interference with family life was reported in nearly every participant, though interference with social life outside the family was also present in over half the sample, and interference with various other areas of life were also commonly endorsed (e. g.,  school,  learning/homework).  Misophonia  severity  was  associated with poorer quality of life, which was reported at similar levels as youth with  anxiety  disorders,  a  population  who  consistently  report  poorer quality of life compared with typically developing youth (Bastiaansen et al., 2004; Ramsawh and Chavira, 2016). Also consistent with reports in adults (Claiborn et al., 2020; Jager et al., 2020; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018), most participants were female, although the self-referred nature of the sample warrants caution in interpreting this trend. The age-of-

High rates of psychiatric comorbidity were noted in this sample, with 79 % meeting criteria for at least one disorder. The most common psychiatric  diagnoses  were  social  anxiety  disorder,  generalized  anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and specific phobias. Anecdotally, during interviews, participants frequently described feeling depressed because of the isolation and distress caused by misophonia. It is possible there is a similar causal pathway with social anxiety in severe cases of misophonia, as social avoidance and interference was very commonly reported in this sample. Significant, medium-to-large associations between the parent- and child-report MAQ (assessing misophonia symptoms) and  anxiety, internalizing symptoms,  quality of life, and externalizing symptoms were found, further supporting a link between misophonia and psychiatric symptoms. It is worth noting more consistent and larger associations between psychiatric symptom measures and the MAQ relative to the A-MISO-S, whose items assess the impact of misophonia (e.g., ' My sound issues currently make me unhappy; '  ' My sound issues currently interfere with my social life ' ), relative to items more  directly  assessing  misophonia  severity  on  the  A-MISO-S  (e.g., ' How much distress do the misophonic triggers cause you ?). Reliability ' was also higher on the MAQ, which may have contributed to differential associations. This highlights the need for rigorous psychometric testing and refinement of  misophonia assessments  in  youth,  which  are  only beginning to be conducted (Cervin et al., 2022; Rinaldi et al., 2022a).

These  comorbidity  findings  were  consistent  with  two  studies  in adults (Rosenthal et al., 2022; Siepsiak et al., 2022), though contrasted two others that recruited patients as part of clinic flow, which found lower rates of comorbidity (Erfanian et al., 2019; Jager et al., 2020, though higher-than-expected depression and ADHD were noted in Jager et al., 2020). It is possible this discrepancy is due to the recruitment methods for these different studies; the current study and the similar adult studies used primarily online and community-based recruitment whereas Erfanian et al. (2019) included both psychiatry and audiology clinic referrals, the latter of which may be less psychiatrically affected. Jager et al. (2020) may have also had referral patterns that resulted in a different clinical presentation.

Results  support  conceptualizing  misophonia  as  a  disorder  on  the internalizing spectrum, with high rates of negative-valence emotional responses to sound triggers, significant associations with co-occurring internalizing symptoms, and high comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders.  Further,  despite  frequently  reported  anger  outbursts  and family  conflict  tied  to  misophonia,  externalizing  symptoms  were  not significantly different from youth with anxiety disorders, and similar to what  might  be  expected  in  a  normative  sample  (Merikangas  et  al., 2010), suggesting it is likely  more  an ' internalizing ' than ' externalizing ' problem. That said, the anxiety disorder group reported higher internalizing  symptoms  than  the  misophonia  group.  Although  this finding may be related to a measurement artifact (i.e., anxiety is more

specifically assessed on the CBCL and YSR than misophonia symptoms), it  may also indicate that categorizing misophonia as an internalizing disorder is an overly simplistic conclusion.

from  interdisciplinary  perspectives  (e.g.,  audiological  and  neurobiological evaluations were not included in this study) and in comparison with other populations (e.g., autistic youth).

To that end, beyond internalizing disorders, there were high rates of comorbidity with several diagnoses beyond what would be expected in a randomly selected sample, including chronic tic disorders (13 %), ADHD (21 %), and OCD (8 %), as well as high rates of elevated autistic characteristics (8 % with elevated social communication/interaction difficulties; 10 % with elevated repetitive behaviors and focused interests). Rather than being linked to one specific diagnosis, it is likely that shared transdiagnostic processes across these diagnoses led to this pattern. One psychological dimension that may be implicated across these disorders is sensory dysregulation, which should be more thoroughly investigated in follow-up work (Harrison et al., 2019). Further research should seek to better understand comorbidity in misophonia, as co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses likely exist due to shared predispositions (e.g., genetics, neurobiology, behavioral patterns) as well as causal pathways (e. g., misophonia-related isolation causing depression and social anxiety).

It  is  worth  noting  that  the  anxiety  sample  reported  significantly higher autistic characteristics than the misophonia sample, and further, that misophonia symptoms were not correlated with autism characteristics, consistent with a large study in adults (Jager et al., 2020). Autism features  have  been  found  to  be  elevated  in  youth  with  misophonia relative to non-misophonia controls in prior work (Rinaldi et al., 2022b); it  is  plausible that some may consider this finding reflective of some specific relationship between autism and misophonia, particularly when considering  the  phenomenological  similarities  in  sound  sensitivity  in these  syndromes,  which  are  rarely  seen  in  other  populations.  When comparing with a relevant psychiatric control in this study, the autismmisophonia connection appears less specific and further supports the notion  that  there  may  be  other  underlying  dimensions  across  these conditions  (e.g.,  emotional  and  sensory  hyperreactivity),  rather  that misophonia reflecting a feature of autism.

A clear understanding of the clinical presentation of misophonia in youth provides a much-needed foundation for interdisciplinary work investigating the mechanisms of this disorder, which will inform innovative treatment development. For example, avoidance behavior was very commonly reported in this sample, both in anticipation of and in response  to  trigger  noises  (e.g.,  using  headphones,  avoiding  family members,  avoiding  meals).  Behavioral  and  emotional  avoidance  is considered to play a central role in the development and maintenance of mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorders in youth, and thus has become a key treatment target of cognitive-behavioral therapies, and it is reasonable to expect it would play a similar role in misophonia (Chu, 2013; Kennedy and Ehrenreich-May, 2017).

This  study  had  several  limitations.  First,  participants  primarily identified  as  White  and  English  speaking;  further  work  is  needed  to understand misophonia in culturally diverse populations. The comparison anxiety group was significantly younger and less frequently identified as White; although age-corrected scores were used in comparison analyses and the pattern of results did not change when statistically controlling for race, results should be considered within this possible limitation.  Similarly,  the  misophonia  sample  was  recruited  predominantly from online support communities, and may reflect youth with more severe, primary misophonia. Results may be less generalizable to youth with misophonia sampled from the general population, or youth with misophonia as a secondary diagnosis. Another limitation of this study  was  the  use  of  misophonia  assessments  with  only  preliminary psychometric validation; unfortunately no validated assessments were available when this study began and thus we adapted measures from the adult literature to draw conclusions. Rigorous development of psychometrically validated assessment for misophonia severity and diagnosis are needed in the future. Further, only auditory triggers were assessed in this study despite an increasing appreciation of visual triggers in the clinical  presentation  of  misophonia  (Swedo  et  al.,  2022).  Further research is also needed to understand clinical features of misophonia

This study provided foundational data on the clinical presentation of misophonia in youth, confirming a highly impairing clinical presentation that is congruent with reports in adults while adding an important developmental perspective. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms of this disorder to inform treatment development.
