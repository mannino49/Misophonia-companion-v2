## 1. Background 31

- Misophonia is a recently identified disorder in which patients experience extreme 32 irritation, anger or disgust when confronted with certain stimuli. These stimuli include oral and 33 nasal sounds (e.g. eating or breathing), other sounds produced by people (e.g. typing or pen 34 clicking), sounds produced by objects (e.g. clock ticking), sounds produced by animals (e.g. 35

36

birds) and visual triggers (e.g. jiggling legs) [1, 2]. Triggering stimuli are context dependent

37

and might develop because of the attached interpretation or meaning within the social

- context [3]. For instance, loud chewing of adult family members might elicit a strong 38 misophonic response, while the same sound coming from a baby might not because this 39 sound could be expected from a baby. 40 Preoccupation with triggering stimuli ('hyper focus') is a core characteristic commonly 41 observed in misophonia. Individuals with misophonia do not only notice triggering stimuli 42 earlier than other people, it is also extremely difficult for them to shift their attention away [2]. 43 The triggering stimuli invoke immediate impulsive aversive emotional and physiological 44 reactions, which is often accompanied by the feeling of losing control. To avoid these 45 negative feelings, patients often pay more attention to potential triggers, which leads to an 46 increased hyper focus [4]. Misophonia is associated with anticipation anxiety and avoidance 47 of situations in which the triggering stimuli might occur [2]. 48 Journal Pre-proof
- Misophonia was first described in the audiology literature in 2001 [5]. In 2013, the 49 research group at the Amsterdam UMC proposed the first diagnostic criteria for misophonia 50 as a psychiatric condition [6]. Since then, more research emerged worldwide within various 51 disciplines, using different definitions and methods to categorize and diagnose misophonia. 52
- Recently, a consensus definition of misophonia has been reached with the input of 15 53 experts, describing misophonia as a ' disorder of decreased tolerance to specific sounds or 54 stimuli associated with such sounds ' [1, p.10]. 55
- Previous research focused mainly on adults with misophonia. Currently, very little is 56 known about misophonia in children and adolescents. The average age of onset is estimated 57 around 13 years of age, as suggested by earlier retrospective research in adults [2]. 58

|   59 | Systematic epidemiological studies into misophonia in children have not yet been performed.           |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   60 | Self-report studies among students suggest a prevalence of clinically relevant misophonia             |
|   61 | symptoms ranging from 6% (in Chinese students, aged 18-23 years; [7]) to almost 20% (in               |
|   62 | American students, aged 18-54 years [8]). However, based on longstanding expert clinical              |
|   63 | experience, we think these numbers may be overrated, since these study populations are not            |
|   64 | a representation of the general population. Moreover, the measurement of misophonia                   |
|   65 | symptoms was based on self-report questionnaires, without the use of a diagnostic interview.          |
|   66 | It should be noted that none of these studies used the consensus definition of misophonia.            |
|   67 | One tool to assess misophonia in youth is the Sussex Misophonia Scale for                             |
|   68 | Adolescents (SMS-Adolescent) [9], a mono-informant self-report questionnaire, also                    |
|   69 | containing questions reflecting potential other disorders (e.g. hyperacusis). The SMS-                |
|   70 | Adolescent is currently preliminary validated for adolescents aged 10-14 years old (N=15)             |
|   71 | [9]. There remains an urgent need for validation of accurate screening and diagnostic tools Pre-proof |
|   72 | for misophonia in children and adolescents [10].                                                      |
|   73 | Recently, research was conducted into the clinical characteristics of misophonia in                   |
|   74 | children and adolescents [9-11]. Within a sample of 102 adolescents with misophonia (8-17             |
|   75 | years-old), 79% of patients met the criteria for at least one other psychiatric diagnosis, with       |
|   76 | mood disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder and ADHD being the most Journal      |
|   77 | prevalent [10]. Another study with a relatively small, population based sample of 15                  |
|   78 | adolescents with misophonia (10-14 years-old) reported higher rates of autistic                       |
|   79 | characteristics [11]. However, the relationship between autism and misophonia appeared                |
|   80 | less specific in the larger sample of Guzick and colleagues [10]. Perhaps there are                   |
|   81 | underlying transdiagnostic factors, such as sensory and emotional hyperreactivity, that play          |
|   82 | an important role in the pathogenesis of misophonia [10]. Indeed, it was found that                   |
|   83 | adolescents with misophonia experience greater (parent reported) sensory hypersensitivity             |
|   84 | across different domains (e.g. in tactile or visual senses) and greater emotional dysregulation       |
|   85 | in response to negative emotions [11], however more research is warranted to discover the             |
|   86 | exact mechanisms involved in misophonia in youth [10].                                                |

|   87 | Misophonia can lead to serious social and educational impairments in children and                  |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   88 | adolescents [10]. It is commonly reported that children can no longer eat, sleep or be in a car    |
|   89 | together with their family, negatively affecting family relations. Social life outside of home and |
|   90 | school work are also often negatively affected by misophonia [10]. At school, misophonia           |
|   91 | may lead to concentration problems, social isolation or school dropout. Misophonia severity        |
|   92 | is associated with poorer quality of life in adolescents [9, 10].                                  |
|   93 | To the best of our knowledge, no evidence-based treatment specifically for children                |
|   94 | and adolescents with misophonia exists worldwide. To date, only one small-scale                    |
|   95 | randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been proposed by Lewin and colleagues (N=44) [12] Pre-proof  |
|   96 | for youth with misophonia aged 8-16 years, comparing transdiagnostic family-based                  |
|   97 | treatment for emotional disorders to misophonia education and emotional/physiological              |
|   98 | relaxation exercises. Their treatment protocol, named The Unified Protocols for                    |
|   99 | Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Children and Adolescents (UP-C/A) is           |
|  100 | based on the assumption that targeting the putative common underlying emotional and Journal        |
|  101 | behavioral processes misophonia shares with other conditions (such as poor emotion                 |
|  102 | regulation) might provide a reduction of misophonia symptoms [12].                                 |
|  103 | While the study protocol of Lewin [12] and our current study protocol share common                 |
|  104 | characteristics (e.g. family involvement), there are notable differences. For instance, the        |
|  105 | current study protocol is designed to specifically target misophonia in a group setting, while     |
|  106 | the protocol used by Lewin is developed for individual families to target underlying general       |
|  107 | mechanisms commonly observed across different disorders.                                           |
|  108 | Moreover, while the core ingredient of the protocol of Lewin consists of cognitive                 |
|  109 | behavioral therapy (CBT), our protocol combines CBT and psychomotor therapy (PMT),                 |
|  110 | which has shown promising results in adults with misophonia [13]. Within our protocol, CBT         |
|  111 | is used to counteract core symptoms in misophonia, by targeting dysfunctional associations,        |
|  112 | cognitions and behaviors. Various single case studies have indicated positive results of CBT       |
|  113 | on reducing misophonia [14-16]. Psychomotor therapy is a treatment method that employs             |
|  114 | body perception and movement to foster psychosocial development of children and to reduce          |

|   115 | psychological symptoms and their impact on daily life [17]. In the Netherlands and Belgium,                 |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   116 | PMT is used to aid in the treatment of various mental health disorders, such as depression                  |
|   117 | and eating disorders [18]. Evidence suggests PMT might serve as a viable add-on to CBT                      |
|   118 | group therapy [19]. Within our protocol, PMT contains exercises such as attention training                  |
|   119 | and relaxation training, which reduce the hyper focus and heightened state of alertness                     |
|   120 | commonly observed in misophonia patients [2].                                                               |
|   121 | In an adult sample of patients with misophonia (N=54, drop-out rate 15%), our CBT +                         |
|   122 | PMT group treatment protocol resulted in a statistically significant reduction of misophonia                |
|   123 | symptoms at 3 months follow-up with very large effect size (-9.7 AMISOS-R; 95% CI [-12.0 -                  |
|   124 | 7.4]; p <.001, d= 1.97), effects were maintained at 1-year follow-up [13]. We chose for an                  |
|   125 | adaptation of this protocol for children and adolescents, aged 8-18 years old. In this paper,               |
|   126 | the trial design of a randomized controlled trial into the effectiveness of this innovative group Pre-proof |
|   127 | protocol for children and adolescents will be described. Our hypothesis is that our group                   |
|   128 | treatment protocol is effective in reducing misophonia in the treatment group (N=41), as Journal            |
|   129 | compared to a waiting list control group (N=41).                                                            |
|   130 | Furthermore, during our study we aim to validate two innovative multi-informant self-                       |
|   131 | report misophonia questionnaires for screening and diagnosis: the Misophonia Screening                      |
|   132 | List - Child and Youth and the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale - Youth (AMISOS-Y). The                           |
|   133 | latter is an adaptation from the widely used adult self-report questionnaires A-MISO-S [6, 10]              |
|   134 | and the revised version AMISOS-R [13, 20, 21], specifically attuned to Dutch children. Lastly,              |
|   135 | by including a wide range of secondary outcomes (emotional and behavioral problems of the                   |
|   136 | child, school functioning, attention problems, sensory processing, (care-related) quality of                |
|   137 | life, cost of illness) and predictors (demographic variables, parenting burden, parental                    |
|   138 | behavioral and emotional problems, family accommodation) we aim to investigate potential                    |
|   139 | underlying mechanisms in the etiology and maintenance of misophonia in children and                         |
|   140 | adolescents. Finally, we aim to improve our findings by incorporating ratings of misophonia                 |
|   141 | severity of the child over time by the psychologist-researcher, as well as ratings of social                |

## 2. Design and methods 143

|   144 | Design: this study is a single-center, single-blinded randomized controlled trial                       |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   145 | (RCT). It compares group cognitive behavioral therapy and psychomotor therapy for                       |
|   146 | misophonia to a waiting list control group.                                                             |
|   147 | Inclusion: children are eligible for inclusion if they are between the age of 8-18 years,               |
|   148 | suffering from misophonia symptoms and for these misophonia symptoms referred to one out                |
|   149 | of two divisions of our center (Psychiatry Department of the Amsterdam UMC, or the                      |
|   150 | Academic Center for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Levvel, Amsterdam) for diagnosis and               |
|   151 | treatment of misophonia between August 2021 and January 2023. Written informed consent                  |
|   152 | will be obtained from children (12+) and both parents. Considering the ongoing validation               |
|   153 | study of our assessment tools, no specific misophonia cut-off scores will be used for                   |
|   154 | inclusion. Children will only be included in this study if they and/or their parents express            |
|   155 | serious suffering and severe impairment of daily life during an extensive intake with trained Pre-proof |
|   156 | psychiatrists/psychologists.                                                                            |
|   157 | Exclusion: ineligible are children who:                                                                 |
|   158 | - have another primary diagnosis than misophonia (e.g. ADHD), since we want to test                     |
|   159 | the effectiveness of our protocol on misophonia as primary diagnosis                                    |
|   160 | - have psychiatric comorbid symptoms that hinder group functioning (e.g. severe Journal                 |
|   161 | autism)                                                                                                 |
|   162 | - have psychiatric comorbid symptoms requiring adjustment of the misophonia                             |
|   163 | treatment protocol according to therapists (e.g. severe autism)                                         |
|   164 | - have received cognitive behavioral therapy for misophonia in the past year                            |
|   165 | - display self-injurious behavior (i.e. auto-mutilation) at present or in the past year,                |
|   166 | since this behavior might negatively affect other group members and would require                       |
|   167 | deviation of treatment protocol                                                                         |
|   168 | - have an estimated IQ below 85                                                                         |
|   169 | - are unable to read or write Dutch, since treatment and questionnaires are in Dutch                    |

During the intake, the in- and exclusion criteria will be assessed further, as well as the 185 presence of comorbid disorders. The presence of misophonia will be assessed by a 186 structured diagnostic interview, using the diagnostic criteria as proposed by Jager and 187 colleagues [2]. In addition, to support a possible diagnosis, two misophonia questionnaires 188 will be administered, the Misophonia Screening List - Child and Youth and the Amsterdam 189 Misophonia Scale - Youth (AMISOS-Y), to both the child and the parents. 190

- have serious family problems (e.g. divorcing parents). The experience of misophonia might be context dependent [3] and is often reported to be mainly directed towards a close family member [2], impacting family relations. Therefore, the family will play an active role within the group therapy, for instance by receiving psychoeducation and separate parent sessions, and joining in exercises. However, some families might experience serious problems extending beyond the problems caused by misophonia, for instance an acrimonious divorce. This might hinder protocol adherence and is therefore an exclusion criterion.

2.1. Patient recruitment and procedure Children referred to our academic center for diagnostics and treatment of misophonia and their parents will be contacted and briefly informed about this research project by telephone. During this telephone call, a first short screening will take place regarding suitability of the child for this project by the psychologist-researcher (LR). Afterwards, an intake will be planned with psychiatrists or psychologists from our center. Journal Pre-proof

After the diagnostic intake procedure, parents of eligible children will be orally informed about the RCT by the psychologist-researcher. Parents and children will also

receive written information. Written informed consent will be obtained from both parents/guardians for all children. From the age of 12, informed consent will also be obtained

from the child. Only children (≥12 years), who have given informed consent, and whose parents have signed informed consent will participate in this study.

Figure 1 shows an overview of procedures and randomization.

2.2 Randomization

After informed consent has been provided, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM199 5 disorders in children and adolescents (SCID-5 Junior) [22] will be conducted with children 200 and parents. This interview measures the psychiatric comorbidity of the child and will serve 201 as both a predictor and a final check of the exclusion criteria. Afterwards, children will be 202 randomly assigned to group treatment for misophonia (N = 41) or the waiting list control 203 group (WCG: N = 41). Children assigned to the WCG will have to wait 3 months before 204 receiving treatment. Both groups will be treated with the same group treatment protocol 205 (CBT/PMT) for misophonia. 206

A standardized, cognitive behavioral therapeutic protocol combined with psychomotor 216 therapy (in group format) was previously developed at the Amsterdam UMC to treat 217 misophonia in adults. This protocol showed both short-term and long-term positive effects in 218 adults [4, 13]. Based on this adult protocol, two recent versions have been adapted and fine219 tuned to fit the needs of children/adolescents in two different age groups: children (ages 8220 13) and adolescents (ages 13-18). The adaptations for children/adolescents include changes 221 in language and form of education and exercises (e.g. use of simple words, alternating 222 theory with simple children's games such as 'Simon Says') and the addition of active 223 involvement of parents. Parents are required to join the therapy during session 1, 5 and 6 224 and during the follow-up. Parents receive psychoeducation and separate parent sessions, 225

Randomization will occur within the computerized data collection system Castor. 207 Permuted block randomization will be used, with block sizes of 2 and 4, in a 1:1 ratio 208 stratified by age and gender. Randomization will be performed by an independent 209 researcher. The psychologist-researcher who performs the assessments will be blinded for 210 participant's allocated intervention. Children and parents, as well as the treatment staff, will 211 be explicitly instructed to refrain from sharing the randomization condition with the 212 psychologist-researcher. 213 214 2.3 Intervention 215 Journal Pre-proof

|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   227 | child groups (ages 8-13), parents are invited to join the last 15 minutes of each session to           |
|   228 | receive an update of the session. In the adolescent groups (13-18), parents receive an e-mail          |
|   229 | after each session with information.                                                                   |
|   230 | The therapy will be administered in groups of 6-8 children/adolescents, with 7 weekly                  |
|   231 | sessions of 1.5 hours of CBT and 1.5 hours of PMT, and a follow-up of 1.5 hours after 3-4              |
|   232 | weeks. Additionally, the children/adolescents will receive assignments to complete at home             |
|   233 | with their parent(s). Table 1 shows the core components of the CBT and PMT program.                    |

|   237 | To ensure treatment integrity, all therapists will be trained in the CBT/PMT protocol by               |
|   238 | two licensed CBT/PMT therapists or psychologists with expertise in the treatment of                    |
|   239 | misophonia before providing the current treatment protocol. During all group treatments,               |
|   240 | ongoing two-weekly therapist peer supervision will be provided by the expert CBT/PMT                   |
|   241 | therapists to avoid protocol drifting.                                                                 |
|   242 | To study treatment integrity, group therapy sessions will be audio-recorded after                      |
|   243 | having received written consent of children and parents. If children or parents do not provide Journal |
|   244 | written consent, treatment sessions will be rated live (during the group sessions) by an               |
|   245 | independent member of the research team. In total, a random 15% of all sessions will be                |
|   246 | rated by two trained, independent master students of psychology. Moreover, four sessions of            |

|   250 | Assessments will be administered online and by telephone/video calls to children,                      |

|   252 | will be conducted with parents and children along with the questionnaires. T2 is 3 months              |
|   253 | after the baseline assessment (thus, either directly after treatment or directly after waiting         |

|   254 | list). After the T2 measurement, treatment for the WCG starts. T3 is 6 months after baseline,      |

|   256 | An overview of the instruments is provided in Table 3. The majority of the instruments             |
|   257 | used are part of our regular clinical care and are psychometrically sound and validated [22-       |
|   258 | 51]. Research to date has not yet determined the psychometric properties of our two                |
|   259 | misophonia questionnaires, the Misophonia Screening List - Child and Youth and the                 |
|   260 | Amsterdam Misophonia Scale - Youth (AMISOS-Y). Therefore, these questionnaires will be             |
|   261 | validated for the purpose of this study, and this may be considered as an additional aim of        |
|   262 | the study. A parent and child version exists (with parallel items) for both questionnaires.        |

|   265 | The severity of misophonia according to parents and child will be assessed by the                  |
|   266 | Amsterdam Misophonia Scale Youth - (AMISOS-Y). The AMISOS-Y consists of 7 multiple-                |
|   267 | choice items about the nature of misophonia, and 10 items on a 4 point- Likert scale               |
|   268 | (different response categories per question). An example question is 'How bad do the               |
|   269 | sounds make you feel?'.                                                                            |

|   272 | the participants compared to a healthy control group (N=240), recruited from elementary and        |
|   273 | secondary schools from urban and rural parts of the Netherlands.                                   |
|   274 |                                                                                                    |

|   276 | The nature of the misophonia symptoms according to parents and child will be                       |
|   277 | assessed by the Misophonia Screening List - Child and Youth. This questionnaire consists of        |
|   278 | 14 items on a 4 point- Likert scale. An example item is 'If I enter a situation in which family or |
|   279 | friends are eating, I feel angry immediately'.                                                     |

|   283 | 11 (YSR; child version) [23]. Specifically the subscales anxious/depressed, social problems,            |
|   284 | attention problems and aggressive behavior are of interest, since these scales might be                 |
|   285 | especially related to misophonia. Reliability statistics are sufficient to good (based on a Dutch       |
|   286 | sample of children), validity statistics are sufficient [23, 32].                                       |
|   287 | School functioning will be assessed by the Teacher Report From (TRF) [23, 32].                          |
|   288 | Attention problems will be assessed by the Dutch ADHD questionnaire (ADHD-                              |
|   289 | vragenlijst; AVL) [24]. Both reliability and construct validity are rated as good by the Dutch          |
|   290 | Committee on Tests and Testing (COTAN) [33].                                                            |
|   291 | Sensory processing will be assessed by the Short Sensory Profile - NL (SSP-NL)                          |
|   292 | [34] and the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile - NL (AASP-NL) [25]. The SSP-NL will be                   |
|   293 | used for children under the age of 11 and is answered by parents. Reliability scores of seven Pre-proof |
|   294 | out of eight sections are sufficient to good, however the validity of the SSP-NL remains                |
|   295 | debatable due to lack of information about convergent and divergent validity in a Dutch Journal         |
|   296 | sample [35]. The AASP-NL will be used for children aged 11 or older and is answered by                  |
|   297 | children. Evidence of test-retest reliability and internal validity is provided in the manual [25].     |
|   298 | The severity of psychopathology will be assessed by the Clinical Global Impression                      |
|   299 | Scale - Improvement (CGI-I) [36]. This scale is used to measure change in                               |
|   300 | psychopathological problems over time according to the psychologist-researcher, and is filled           |
|   301 | in after a short interview with parents and child at the three time points. The CGI-I has been          |
|   302 | found to be a reliable and valid measure of clinical change [26].                                       |
|   303 | Quality of life will be assessed by the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) - PF28                         |
|   304 | (parent version) [37], showing moderate to excellent test-retest reliability and adequate               |
|   305 | discriminant validity in a Dutch child sample [27] and the CHQ - CF45 (child version) [37],             |
|   306 | found to be reliable and valid [28]. Care-related quality of life will be assessed by the Carer         |
|   307 | Quality of Life (CarerQol) [29].The CarerQol has been found to be valid for informal                    |
|   308 | caregivers, such as parents [38, 39] and displays adequate test-retest reliability [40].                |

|   309 | Cost of illness: we aim to measure the costs associated with misophonia to estimate                   |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   310 | the total financial burden of misophonia on society (i.e., conduct a cost of illness study [41])      |
|   311 | by comparing baseline data of patients and a healthy control group on a retrospective cost            |
|   312 | questionnaire. In addition, using an existing Cost of Illness questionnaire [42, 43], changes in      |
|   313 | costs after treatment (from T2 to T3) will be assessed [42, 43].                                      |
|   314 | Social validity is defined as the perceived impact of the treatment on treatment goals                |
|   315 | and outcomes [44]. Four standardized social validity forms were created for this research             |
|   316 | (CBT/PMT; child version/parent version) and will be handed over to children and parents at            |
|   317 | the end of the treatment.                                                                             |
|   318 | Misophonia might result in coercive and disruptive behavior of the child. This behavior               |
|   319 | will be assessed by the Coercive Disruptive Behavior Scale - Misophonia. This questionnaire Pre-proof |
|   320 | is an adaptation from the Coercive and Disruptive Behavior Scale - Pediatric OCD (CD-POC)             |
|   321 | [46], which has shown good psychometric qualities [45, 46].                                           |

|   325 | Psychiatric comorbidity of the child will be assessed by a semi structured clinical                   |
|   326 | interview for children and parents, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 disorders in          |
|   327 | children and adolescents (SCID-5 Junior) [22]. If performed in the correct way by a trained           |
|   328 | interviewer, the SCID-5 Junior is a reliable and valid instrument to assess DSM-5 diagnoses           |
|   329 | in children and adolescents [22].                                                                     |
|   330 | Parenting burden will be assessed by the Dutch Parenting burden questionnaire                         |
|   331 | (Opvoedingsbelastingvragenlijst; OBVL) [30]. Reliability is rated as good, and construct              |

|   345 | There are no previous studies into treatment of misophonia in children, but an RCT                     |
|   346 | into misophonia treatment among adults showed a large positive treatment effect (in terms of Pre-proof |
|   347 | Cohen's d, d=1.97 [13]). Assuming a more conservative, yet still large effect (F = 0.25 in             |
|   348 | ANOVA, see statistical analysis below, which corresponds to d = 0.80) and desiring a                   |
|   349 | minimum power of 0.80, a sample size of 82 (41 per group) is sufficient to demonstrate Journal         |
|   350 | significant differences in the primary outcome (severity of misophonia, difference in group            |
|   351 | treatment versus WCG). This power analysis has been performed with the use of IBM SPSS.                |
|   352 | It is therefore our intention to include 82 children, a number which we consider realistically         |
|   353 | feasible.                                                                                              |
|   354 | Clinical experience suggests that dropout during treatment is rare. Considering the                    |

|   356 | Netherlands, we find that children and parents are often considerably motivated to participate         |
|   357 | in the entire treatment. In view of these findings, and by taking our intended sample size and         |
|   358 | a conservative estimate of the effect size into account, we consider our study sufficiently            |
|   359 | powered. We will study differences between the population that drops out and the population            |
|   360 | that participates until the end of treatment (to study a possible selection bias).                     |

|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   364 | will be carried out on the repeatedly measured AMISOS-Y scores. T2 will be regarded the             |
|   365 | primary endpoint, T3 the secondary endpoint. If the results are significant, post-hoc analyses      |
|   366 | (e.g. Tukey) can be used to determine which differences contribute to this significant effect. It   |
|   367 | will then be assessed which of the two groups shows the larger change in AMISOS-Y score             |
|   368 | and in which direction. If there is a reduction on T2, and this reduction is larger for the         |
|   369 | experimental group than the WCG, we will conclude treatment is effective.                           |
|   370 | If assumptions underlying AN(C)OVA are violated, we will turn to a nonparametric                    |
|   371 | equivalent. Gender, age, and socio-economic status will be included as covariates (p <.05).         |
|   372 | Differences in demographics and clinical background between children in the treatment               |

|   374 | tests, if needed.                                                                                   |
|   375 | For the secondary outcomes, the same analyses will be used.                                         |
|   376 | For the predictors of treatment outcome, multivariate regression analyses will be                   |

|   378 | outcome. Moderating influences will be investigated by including interaction terms in the Journal   |
|   379 | linear mixed models between the significant predictor variables and the treatment group.            |
|   380 | Separate analyses will be performed for child versus parent scores (i.e. per informant).            |

## 4. Discussion

Misophonia is a recently recognized disorder that is assumed to originate in 422 childhood. If left untreated, misophonia might lead to serious negative consequences for 423 children and their families, such as impaired family relations, social isolation and school 424 dropout according to patients. To our knowledge, no research has been performed worldwide 425 into treatment of misophonia for children and adolescents. This study is the first large RCT to 426 investigate the effectiveness of the CBT plus PMT group treatment protocol for misophonia in 427 children and adolescents, to ensure that evidence-based treatment is available. 428

This study has several strengths. First, sound assessment instruments (both generic 429 and misophonia specific) and an adequate sample size are used. We aim to validate two 430 misophonia questionnaires, improving screening and diagnostics. Second, a standardized 431 combined CBT/PMT treatment protocol is used in in group format, with two-weekly therapist 432 peer supervision, and treatment integrity being analyzed. Earlier, this protocol showed both 433 short-term and long-term effects in an adult sample [13]. Lastly, this study aims to contribute 434 to general knowledge about misophonia in children and adolescents, by including a wide 435 range of secondary outcomes and predictors of treatment success, and by using multiple 436 informants (child, parents, teacher, psychologist-researcher). 437 Journal Pre-proof

## 4.1 Limitations 439

There are some limitations in our study that need to be addressed. First, children 440 might differ from adults in their intrinsic treatment motivation and therapeutic needs. Although 441 the treatment protocol is adjusted to children in language and nature of exercises, the 442 treatment duration remains unchanged, possibly forgoing children's needs for more 443 reinforcement, practice moments and repetition. 444

|   445 | Second, this study only includes one follow-up after 3 months. A follow-up after 6                |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   446 | months or a year might be more helpful in monitoring the long-term treatment outcomes.            |
|   447 | Third, this study entails several exclusion criteria, which might limit the generalizability      |
|   448 | of the findings. We have decided to use these to create a homogenous group of children with       |
|   449 | misophonia, since this is the first RCT of a combined CBT/PMT protocol for children and           |
|   450 | adolescents with a primary diagnosis of misophonia.                                               |
|   451 | Fourth, at the start of this study, no Dutch validated assessment tool for misophonia             |
|   452 | in children was available to be used as outcome measure. Therefore, we aim to validate two        |
|   453 | Dutch assessment tools for misophonia in this study.                                              |
|   454 | Lastly, this study uses a passive waiting list control group receiving the same                   |
|   455 | treatment after 3 months, instead of an active control group. This might hinder drawing Pre-proof |
|   456 | conclusions about the effectiveness of specific treatment elements of the program.                |
|   457 |                                                                                                   |
|   458 | 4.2 Implications for clinical practice                                                            |
|   459 | Worldwide, there is limited knowledge about misophonia in children and adolescents. Journal       |
|   460 | Information about characteristics of misophonia in Dutch children remains lacking, as well as     |
|   461 | validated Dutch questionnaires and evidence-based treatment to adequately screen,                 |
|   462 | diagnose and treat misophonia in children. This research will lead to a global improvement of     |
|   463 | knowledge and care by improving the diagnostics and treatment of misophonia in children           |
|   464 | and adolescents. We expect that the results will be immediately relevant for clinical practice.   |
