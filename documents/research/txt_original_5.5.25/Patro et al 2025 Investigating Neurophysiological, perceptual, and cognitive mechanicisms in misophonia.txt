Simple Summary: While the emotional and behavioral effects of misophonia are well rec-
ognized, its impact on brain function and perception remains unclear. This study examined
differences in brain responses to sound, speech perception in noisy environments, and
cognitive abilities between individuals with and without misophonia. The results of this
study suggested that individuals with misophonia exhibited reduced brain responses to
unexpected sounds, indicating differences in early auditory processing. However, their
hearing abilities, speech perception, and cognitive performance were comparable to those
without misophonia. These results suggest that misophonia is associated with distinct
neural processing differences but does not appear to affect overall auditory or cognitive
function. A better understanding of these brain mechanisms may contribute to improved
strategies for managing misophonia.
Abstract: Misophonia is a condition characterized by intense, involuntary distress or anger in
response to specific sounds, often leading to irritation or aggression. While the condition is
recognized for its emotional and behavioral impacts, little is known about its physiological
and perceptual effects. The current study aimed to explore the physiological correlates and
perceptual consequences of misophonia through a combination of electrophysiological, percep-
tual, and cognitive assessments. Seventeen individuals with misophonia and sixteen control
participants without the condition were compared. Participants completed a comprehensive
battery of tests, including (a) cortical event-related potentials (ERPs) to assess neural responses
to standard and deviant auditory stimuli, (b) the spatial release from the speech-on-speech
masking (SRM) paradigm to evaluate speech segregation in background noise, and (c) the
flanker task to measure selective attention and cognitive control. The results revealed that
individuals with misophonia exhibited significantly smaller mean peak amplitudes of the
N1 and N2 components in response to oddball tones compared to controls. This suggests
a potential underlying neurobiological deficit in misophonia patients, as these components
are associated with early auditory processing. However, no significant differences between
each group were observed in the P1 and P2 components regarding oddball tones or in any
ERP components in response to standard tones. Despite these altered neural responses, the
misophonia group did not show differences in hearing thresholds, speech perception abilities,
or cognitive function compared to the controls. These findings suggest that while misophonia
may involve distinct neurophysiological changes, particularly in early auditory processing, it
does not necessarily lead to perceptual deficits in speech perception or cognitive function.

1. Introduction
Misophonia, derived from the Greek roots miso-(meaning “hatred”) and -phonia (mean-
ing “sound”), is a condition characterized by intense negative emotional reactions—such
as irritation, anger, or disgust—when individuals encounter specific “trigger” sounds [ 1].
Common triggers often include human-generated sounds such as chewing, slurping, sniffing,
and throat clearing [ 2], as well as repetitive noises from objects like pen clicking or keyboard
typing [ 3]. Beyond emotional discomfort, these reactions are often accompanied by increased
autonomic arousal, leading to significant distress [ 4]. To manage this discomfort, individu-
als with misophonia may avoid situations where triggers are present or endure them with
great difficulty [ 2]. Over time, this avoidance and distress can cause profound functional
impairments, disrupting daily life and social interactions. Despite growing awareness of
this condition, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, specific to the realm of au-
ditory processing, and their broader perceptual consequences remain poorly understood,
underscoring the need for further research.
Neurophysiological studies have begun to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of
misophonia, shedding light on both cortical and functional anomalies associated with this
condition. Research using fMRI has consistently highlighted hyperactivity in the anterior
insular cortex (AIC; a key region in the salience network) in response to misophonic trigger
sounds (e.g., [ 5]). This hyperactivity is accompanied by increased functional connectivity
between the AIC and regions involved in emotional processing and regulation (e.g., ventro-
medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex), suggesting an exaggerated salience
assigned to specific sounds in individuals with misophonia [ 5]. Furthermore, the anterior
cingulate cortex (ACC; involved with top-down executive control) and superior temporal
cortex have also shown hyperactivity, indicating a broader network dysfunction in response
to misophonic stimuli [6].
On the electrophysiological front, Aryal and Prabhu [ 7] recently observed significant
differences in the latency of P1 and N1 peaks of Auditory Late Latency Responses (ALLRs)
between individuals with misophonia and controls. These latency differences suggest that
individuals with misophonia may experience delayed or altered cortical processing of
auditory stimuli. Similarly, Schröder et al. [ 8] investigated auditory processing in miso-
phonia patients using auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) during an oddball task.
They found that misophonia patients exhibited a smaller mean amplitude of the N1 peak
in response to oddball tones compared to controls, with no significant differences in the
P1 and P2 components. Importantly, no differences were observed in ERP components
in response to standard tones, indicating that the deficits in misophonia are specific to
change detection mechanisms in the auditory cortex, rather than reflecting broader auditory
processing impairments.
Given this evidence, the mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm provides a strong ratio-
nale for investigating auditory processing deficits in misophonia, as it is a well-established
tool for assessing automatic change detection mechanisms in a repetitive auditory con-
text [ 9]. Individuals with misophonia exhibit intense emotional responses to specific audi-
tory triggers, and MMN, which operates without conscious attention, could reveal how
these individuals’ brains respond to “deviant” sounds that deviate from the expected norm,
providing insights into heightened sensitivity or aversive reactions to certain stimuli [ 10].
MMN is also closely tied to sensory memory processes, requiring the formation of short-
term memory traces to compare incoming auditory stimuli against the established auditory
context [ 11]. In misophonia, a diminished MMN may indicate a disrupted sensory memory
system that fails to appropriately filter and encode auditory stimuli. Such deficits could
cause certain sounds to be perceived as disproportionately salient, exacerbating emotional
distress. In this study, MMN was utilized to investigate how these auditory processing

Biology 2025 ,14, 238 3 of 19
deficits contribute to misophonia. Further, our analysis that focuses on the N1 peaks elicited
by the standard and deviant stimuli, latency, and amplitude difference between the N1
peaks of the standard and deviant waveforms provides insights into early neural responses
to acoustic changes. This metric helps compare findings with Schröder et al. [ 8], who
reported that individuals with misophonia exhibit a selective reduction in N1 response to
deviant stimuli, thereby diminishing the N1 amplitude difference between standard and
deviant waveforms.
While the neurophysiological basis of misophonia has been increasingly studied, with
some research highlighting altered cortical activity in affected individuals, the perceptual
consequences of these neural changes remain largely unexplored. In particular, how in-
dividuals with misophonia process speech under adverse listening conditions—such as
noisy or acoustically challenging environments—has received limited attention. Since indi-
viduals with misophonia do not typically exhibit peripheral auditory processing deficits,
any difficulties in speech perception are likely to stem from central processes, particularly
those involved in auditory scene analysis [ 12,13]. The spatial release from masking (SRM)
paradigm is well suited to investigate these central mechanisms, as it examines how indi-
viduals segregate target speech from background noise based on spatial cues [ 14–18]. By
comparing SRM performance in individuals with and without misophonia, this study aims
to illuminate the perceptual challenges that characterize this population.
Cognitive operations, especially attention, are fundamental to the perception and
processing of sensory stimuli, enabling individuals to focus on relevant information while
suppressing distractions. In misophonia, the attentional process is often disrupted due to
abnormally increased sensitivity to specific trigger sounds [ 19,20]. This increased vigilance
towards aversive sounds can impede the ability to allocate attention to other important
stimuli, resulting in difficulties in task performance and broader cognitive functioning.
The attentional deficits observed in individuals with misophonia—such as an exaggerated
focus on trigger sounds—suggest that cognitive resources are disproportionately allocated
to these stimuli, thereby reducing the capacity to engage with other aspects of the environ-
ment [ 21]. To further investigate these attentional mechanisms in misophonia, we employed
the flanker task, a controlled method for assessing selective attention. This task presents
distracting stimuli (flankers) alongside a central target stimulus, requiring participants to
focus on the target while inhibiting attention to the flankers [ 22,23]. We hypothesized that
individuals with misophonia would exhibit greater difficulty disengaging attention from
the flankers. This would suggest that their attention deficits are not confined to auditory
stimuli alone but may extend to broader, domain-general cognitive processes.
In summary, this study aimed to investigate the neurophysiological, perceptual, and
cognitive mechanisms underlying misophonia. Three tasks were utilized: ERP measure-
ments to assess automatic change detection in auditory processing, the SRM paradigm to
examine speech segregation in the presence of background noise, and the flanker task to
evaluate selective attention and cognitive control. These tasks collectively offer a detailed
understanding of the neural and perceptual impairments associated with misophonia.
2. Method
2.1. Participants
An a priori power analysis (effect size, d= 0.25, α= 0.05) indicated that a total sample
size of 24 participants (12 per group) would be required to achieve a statistical power of
0.8. To ensure a sufficiently powered study, 35 participants (2 males, 33 females; age range:
18–30 years, M= 24 years, SD= 3 years) were recruited via word of mouth and social media.
However, due to abnormally high electrode impedances during data collection, reliable
ERP responses could not be recorded for two participants, leading to their exclusion from

Biology 2025 ,14, 238 4 of 19
the analysis. This resulted in a final sample of 33 participants, with 16 assigned to the con-
trol group (1 male, 15 females; M= 24.37 years, SD= 1.76 years) and 17 to the misophonia
group (1 male, 16 females; M= 23.94 years, SD= 2.94 years). Each participant was screened
for misophonia using the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S; Schröder et al. [ 3]).
The A-MISO-S, based on the Yale–Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale ( Y-BOCS ), includes
six items assessing overall symptoms, distress, interference, effort to resist, control over
symptoms, and avoidance [ 3]. Participants were placed in either the experimental (miso-
phonic) group or control group based on their A-MISO-S score ( 0–4 subclinical ,5–9 mild ,
10–14 moderate, 15–19 severe, 20–24 extreme). Scores of 5 and above indicated misophonia.
Participants were blinded to the outcome of the A-MISO-S screening and were not informed
of their group allocation to ensure unbiased participation in the study. Participants also
described scenarios where they encountered triggers, such as in classrooms and at home,
and their reactions (e.g., “anger (extreme)”, “extremely uncomfortable”, “anxiety/panic
attack”, “flee the environment”, “irritated”, “distress”, “disgust”), aligning with diagnostic
criteria [ 24–28]. In total, 16 participants were included in the control group (1 male, 15 fe-
males, aged 24, M= 24, SD= 2), and 19 in the misophonic group (1 male, 18 females, aged
24,M= 24, SD= 3), with an average A-MISO-S score of 9. Within the misophonic group,
11 participants scored in the mild range, 4 in the moderate range, 1 in the severe range, and
1 in the extreme range.
Participants were screened for hearing deficits through otoscopic inspection, tympa-
nometry, and standard pure-tone audiometry. Written informed consent was obtained from
all participants in accordance with the Towson University Institutional Review Board (IRB
#1717, approved on 21 April 2022), Towson, MD, USA. Participants were compensated at a
rate of USD 15 per hour for their time. Payment was issued in the form of gift cards upon
completion of the study session.
2.2. ERP: Stimuli, Acquisition Parameters, and Response Analyses
ERP recordings were conducted using a pair of stimuli following an oddball paradigm
(i.e., standard and deviant stimuli). The stimulus pair consisted of a 600 Hz tone presented
binaurally. Each stimulus had a total duration of 200 ms, including a 30 ms rise time, a
140 ms steady-state plateau, and a 30 ms fall time. The standard stimulus was an unaltered
600 Hz tone delivered to both ears. The deviant stimulus featured the same 600 Hz tone
but with a 15◦phase shift (equivalent to 0.2618 radians) applied to the right channel. This
phase difference corresponds to a small temporal delay relative to the left channel over the
600 Hz tone’s period (~1.67 ms). All stimuli were generated using MATLAB version 2024
(MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).
The MMN response waveforms were obtained using a Duet two-channel SmartEP
system (Intelligent Hearing Systems, Miami, FL, USA). Stimuli were presented at 70 dBnHL
in an ‘oddball’ paradigm, with the standard stimulus occurring 80% of the time and the
deviant stimulus 20% of the time. The stimuli were presented in rarefaction polarity, with a
repetition rate of 1.1/s. Responses were averaged over 200 sweeps of deviant stimuli and
800 sweeps of standard stimuli, within a time frame of −50 to 500 ms relative to stimulus
offset. A bandpass filter with a frequency range of 0.1 to 30 Hz was applied, and the signal
was amplified up to 50,000 times. Stimuli were presented binaurally to each participant.
Participants were seated comfortably to minimize muscular artifacts and engaged
in watching a subtitled movie without sound to ensure a passive listening state. Each
participant was informed about the preparation and placement process of the electrode
montage (2-channel, vertical montage). Before electrode placement, the skin was cleansed
using an exfoliating gel, and an electrolytic paste was applied for electrode attachment. The
electrodes were securely affixed using micropore tape in the designated regions according

Biology 2025 ,14, 238 5 of 19
to the standard 10–20 electrode placement system: ground electrode (Fp), positive electrode
(Fz), and reference electrodes on the mastoids (M1 for the left channel, M2 for the right
channel). Foam insert earphones were placed in each participant’s ears for a binaural
setup. Participants were instructed to remain quiet and focus solely on the movie content,
disregarding any acoustic stimuli delivered through the earphones. Impedance levels were
confirmed before each run (3–5 runs), maintaining less than 5 k Ωfor absolute impedance
and below 2 k Ωfor inter-electrode impedance.
All ERP waveforms elicited by the standard and deviant stimuli were visually in-
spected, and the peak latencies and amplitudes were manually identified and marked for
subsequent analysis. This manual marking ensured accuracy and consistency in capturing
the electrophysiological responses across participants. The normative latency ranges for
each ERP peak were referenced based on established guidelines to standardize interpreta-
tions. For the standard stimuli, the P1, N1, and P2 peaks were observed at approximate
latencies of 50 ms, 100 ms, and 200 ms, respectively. These values align with expected
auditory cortical responses to simple auditory stimuli under normal conditions [ 28]. For
the deviant stimuli, the same peaks typically appeared within similar latency ranges, al-
though slight shifts in latency and amplitude were occasionally observed, likely reflecting
stimulus-specific neural processing.
To isolate components related to auditory deviance detection, difference waveforms
were calculated by subtracting the ERP elicited by standard stimuli from that elicited by
deviant stimuli for each trial. Subsequent analyses focused on two primary negative peaks:
∆N1 and MMN. ∆N1 was defined as the difference in latency and amplitude between the
N1 peaks of the standard and deviant waveforms, typically occurring within the 80–120 ms
latency range. In contrast, MMN was identified as a distinct negative deflection in the dif-
ference waveform, occurring within the 150–250 ms latency range. MMN amplitude was
calculated as the difference between the N2 peak elicited by deviant stimuli and the cor-
responding segment of the standard waveform [ 9]. This measure reflects neural processes
involved in the automatic detection of auditory irregularities. In addition to amplitude mea-
sures, we analyzed the latencies of individual ERP components and difference waveforms.
The latency analyses provided complementary insights into the temporal dynamics of neu-
ral responses [ 29], offering a detailed perspective on the temporal dynamics of auditory
processing and potential deficits associated with misophonia.
2.3. SRM Paradigm
The speech corpus recorded at Boston University’s Hearing Research Center [ 15] was
used to assess SRM. This corpus contained sentences composed of five monosyllabic words
that are syntactically correct but semantically unpredictable. Prior research has shown
that access to semantic cues may obscure the observation of any potential relationship
between misophonia and speech perception. The target (and the masker) sentences in
this corpus had the structure <name> <verb> <number> <adjective> <object> (e.g., Jane
found five red toys), with each word being randomly selected from 8 possible options.
The target always contained the <name> call-sign “Jane” with other keywords being
randomly selected from other available choices. The target was always presented in the
center (0◦azimuth), while the maskers were either colocated with the target at 0◦azimuth or
spatialized at ±15◦(spatially separated). The spatial locations of the target and background
speakers were simulated by applying non-individualized head-related transfer functions
(HRTFs) to the test stimuli, downloaded from an MIT website (sound.media.mit.edu). The
target/masker voices (female voice: f0 = 175–200 Hz) varied across trials but remained
the same within each given trial. The stimuli were generated in MATLAB version 2024
(MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) on a PC and played using a Lynx Hilo sound card

Biology 2025 ,14, 238 6 of 19
(Lynx Studio Technology, Costa Mesa, CA, USA). The stimuli were presented via Sennheiser
HDA 650 (Sennheiser, Old Lyme, CT, USA) headphones. The masking stimuli were fixed at
70 dB SPL, while the target signal level was adaptively adjusted using a one-up, one-down
tracking procedure to determine the Target-to-Masker Ratio (TMR) threshold corresponding
to 50% correct performance. SRM was quantified by subtracting the TMR threshold of
the spatially separated condition from that of the colocated condition, representing the
improvement in speech perception due to spatial separation. The methodology for stimulus
presentation and response analysis for SRM has been detailed in recent studies conducted by
our laboratory [ 30–33]. Participants were tasked with identifying target sentences beginning
with the call-sign “Jane”, always delivered from the center. Each trial featured a randomized
pairing of target and masker voices, consistent within a given trial. Practice runs for both
conditions were conducted to familiarize participants with the task. The experiment used a
fixed set of conditions, and the target–masker configurations were randomized to minimize
predictability effects.
2.4. Flanker Task
The flanker test was conducted using the Psychology Experiment Building Language
(PEBL version 2.0.4) platform (The PEBL Project, Fairfax, VA, USA) [ 34]. In this task, par-
ticipants were presented with a central stimulus and tasked with identifying its left–right
orientation while actively disregarding surrounding stimuli, referred to as ‘flankers’ [ 35]. The
primary objective was to determine whether the centrally located arrow pointed to the left or
right, while ignoring the orientation of the surrounding arrows [ 36]. The surrounding arrows
were either congruous, where the target stimulus and distracting stimuli were associated
with the same response (e.g., all arrows pointing in the same direction), or incongruous,
where the target stimulus and distracting stimuli were associated with different responses
(e.g., the central arrow pointing left while flankers point right) [ 37]. The key manipulation in
this task was the congruency of the target stimulus and its flankers.
Each participant underwent 160 trials, with accuracy and response times recorded.
These measurements served as indicators of cognitive attention, in line with the methodol-
ogy detailed by Zelazo et al. [ 38]. The task setup is straightforward, with stimuli shown for
an unlimited time until the participant responds to advance to the next trial. The stimuli
were typically composed of a target image in the center flanked by one or more distractor
stimuli on either side. Completion times for the flanker task were scored separately for
congruent, incongruent, and conflict cost conditions. To account for potential confounding
factors such as motor skills, visual acuity, and processing speed, a differential measure
termed conflict cost was employed. Conflict cost was calculated by subtracting the total
completion times for congruent trials from those for incongruent trials, providing a more
targeted assessment of attentional control [ 35]. Higher conflict costs would indicate greater
difficulty in filtering out irrelevant distractors and focusing on the target stimulus, suggest-
ing weaker attentional control. Conversely, lower conflict costs demonstrate an enhanced
ability to manage interference and maintain focus. By analyzing conflict cost, this study
aimed to gain insight into the attentional processes that may be disrupted in individuals
with misophonia.
2.5. Testing Procedure
The participants’ testing journey began with audiometric assessments to establish
baseline hearing thresholds. Following this, the A-MISO-S scale was used to assess the
severity of misophonia symptoms, providing context for individual differences in miso-
phonia severity. Next, participants completed the ERP task to examine neural responses to
auditory deviance, focusing on MMN and ∆N1 components. This task assessed the brain’s

Biology 2025 ,14, 238 7 of 19
automatic response to standard and deviant auditory stimuli, providing insights into audi-
tory processing and potential neural impairments associated with misophonia. The SRM
paradigm followed, where participants’ ability to segregate speech from background noise
was tested. By measuring SRM, this task evaluated how well participants could perceive
speech in noisy environments, highlighting potential challenges faced by individuals with
misophonia in real-world listening situations. Finally, participants engaged in the flanker
task, which assessed cognitive control and attentional processes. The conflict cost measure
was used to examine participants’ ability to filter distractions and focus on the target stim-
ulus, offering insights into the attentional challenges that may be present in individuals
with misophonia.
3. Results
3.1. Audiometric Characteristics and Misophonia Severity
All participants enrolled in the study exhibited symmetrical hearing abilities bilaterally,
with interaural asymmetries of 10 dB HL or less across all tested frequencies. Figure 1 illus-
trates the audiometric thresholds for both the control and misophonia groups. Figure 1A,B
display individual audiograms, along with mean audiograms averaged across ears, for
the control group and the misophonia group, respectively. Thin colored lines represent
the hearing thresholds of individual participants, while bold lines highlight the group
mean thresholds. Notably, all participants displayed thresholds within the normative range
(≤20 dB HL). Figure 1C compares the individual and mean PTA thresholds between the
two groups. A mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to compare au-
ditory thresholds between the two test groups. Test frequency served as the within-subject
factor, while subject group served as the between-subject factor. The results revealed a
significant main effect of test frequency [ F(7, 217) = 1.01, p= 0.04, η2= 0.03]. However, the
main effects of participant group [ F(1, 31) = 0.27, p= 0.61, η2= 0.01] and its interaction
with test frequency [ F(7, 217) = 2.01, p= 0.60, η2= 0.06] were not statistically significant.
Post hoc pairwise comparisons indicated that intergroup differences were not statistically
significant at any of the test frequencies (all p> 0.05). These findings suggest similar audio-
metric thresholds across all tested frequencies for both participant groups. Additionally,
the pure-tone averages (PTAs) were calculated for each participant and compared between
the control (M = 4.33, SD = 3.44) and misophonia (M = 5.5.04, SD = 3.01) groups using an
independent-sample t-test. The results showed no significant difference in PTA between
the two groups ( t(31) = −0.39, p= 0.70, Cohen’s d = 0.08). The mean PTAs are depicted in
Figure 1C.
The distribution of individual A-MISO-S scores (unfilled circles) and the group mean
score (filled circle) are presented in Figure 2, highlighting both the variability within the
sample and the average severity of misophonia. Error bars represent ±1 standard error
(SE). For reference, the degree of misophonia severity, as defined by Schröder et al. [ 8], is
also indicated, providing context for interpreting the severity levels within the sample. This
visualization underscores the range of experiences among participants while situating the
group mean within established severity thresholds. It is evident from the figure that all
participants in the misophonia group exhibited clinically significant misophonia, as indicated
by their total A-MISO-S scores falling within the range of 5 to 24. The mean A-MISO-S
score among these participants was calculated at 8.89, demonstrating a considerable level of
symptom severity across the sample, with individual scores ranging from 5 to 23.

3.2. ERP Amplitudes and Latencies
Figure 3 displays the mean amplitudes of the ERP components (P1, N1, P2, and
N2) for the control and misophonia groups across different stimulus conditions. Panels
A and B show the mean amplitudes elicited by standard stimuli and deviant stimuli,
respectively, with groups color-coded for clarity (green for the control group and purple for
the misophonia group). Panels C and D present the individual data distribution (unfilled
circles) and mean amplitudes for ∆N1 and MMN responses, respectively, for both groups.
Error bars in all panels represent ±1 standard error (SE). Two mixed-design ANOVAs
were conducted to analyze these amplitudes: one for responses to standard tones and
another for responses to deviant tones across the two groups. In each ANOVA, ERP
component (P1, N1, P2, N2) served as the within-subject factor, and group (control vs.
misophonia) served as the between-subject factor. For the standard tones, there was a
significant main effect of ERP component [ F(3, 93) = 585.74, p< 0.001, η2= 0.95], indicating
that cortical response amplitudes differed between the four peaks. However, neither the

main effect of group [ F(1, 31) = 0.04, p= 0.85, η2< 0.001] nor the interaction between ERP
component and group [ F(3, 93) = 0.11, p= 0.95, η2< 0.001] reached statistical significance. In
contrast, analysis of responses to the deviant tones revealed a significant main effect of ERP
component [ F(3, 93) = 895.73 ,p< 0.01, η2= 0.97], suggesting distinct cortical responses to
deviant stimuli. While the main effect of group was not significant [ F(1, 31) = 9.88, p< 0.01 ,
η2= 0.24 ], a significant interaction between ERP component and group was observed
[F(3, 93) = 5.58 ,p< 0.01, η2= 0.15]. Post hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted to
examine this interaction. No significant group differences were found in P1 ( Mdiff = 0.24,
SE= 0.35, p= 0.49, Cohens’ d = 0.10) or P2 amplitudes ( Mdiff = 0.01, SE= 0.23, p= 0.99, Cohen’s
d= 0.01). However, significant group differences were observed for N1 ( Mdiff =−0.86,
SE= 0.19 ,p< 0.01, Cohen’s d =−1.24) and N2 amplitudes ( Mdiff =−1.55, SE= 0.29, p< 0.01,
Cohen’s d =−1.27), with the misophonia group showing reduced amplitudes compared to
the control group.

compare  the latencies  of the ΔN1 and MMN components  between groups. The t-test com-
paring ΔN1 latency revealed  no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the groups (t(31) = 0.38, p 
= 0.35, Cohen’s d = 0.12). Similarly,  the t-test comparing  MMN latency also showed no sig-
niﬁcant group diﬀerence (t(31) = −0.04, p = 0.48, Cohen’s d = −0.01). The latencies  of the ΔN1 
and MMN components  for each group are depicted  in Figures 4C and 4D, respectively.

To further examine group differences, ∆N1 and MMN waveforms were calculated
by subtracting the ERP waveforms elicited by standard tones from those elicited by de-
viant tones. Two independent t-tests were performed to compare the ∆N1 and MMN
response amplitudes between the control and misophonia groups. The first t-test re-
vealed a significant reduction in ∆N1 amplitudes in the misophonia group compared
to the control group ( t(31) = −4.90, p< 0.01, Cohen’s d =−1.52). Similarly, the second
t-test demonstrated a significant reduction in MMN amplitudes in the misophonia group
(t(31) = −7.63,p< 0.01 ,Cohen’s d =−2.38). These findings suggest that both ∆N1 and
MMN response amplitudes were significantly diminished in individuals with misophonia
compared to controls. The mean ∆N1 and MMN amplitudes for each group are depicted in
Figures 3B and 3C, respectively.
Figure 4 shows the mean ERP latencies for the control and misophonia groups across
stimulus conditions. Panels A and B present the latencies elicited by standard and deviant
stimuli, respectively. Panels C and D illustrate the individual data distribution (unfilled cir-
cles) and mean latencies for ∆N1 and MMN responses, respectively, in both groups. Aligned
with the ERP amplitude analyses, we conducted two separate mixed-design ANOVAs to
compare ERP peak latencies across participant groups: one for standard tones and another
for deviant tones. For standard tones, the analysis revealed a significant main effect of ERP
component [ F(3, 96) = 1126.14, p< 0.001, η2= 0.97], indicating that response latencies varied
significantly across the different ERP components. However, neither the main effect of
group [ F(1, 31) = 0.05, p= 0.82, η2< 0.001] nor the interaction between ERP component and
group [ F(3, 93) = 0.44, p= 0.72, η2= 0.01] was statistically significant. Similarly, for deviant
tones, the analysis revealed a significant main effect of ERP component [ F(3, 93) = 227.16 ,
p< 0.01 ,η2= 0.88). However, neither the main effect of group [ F(1, 31) = 1.32 ,p= 0.26,
η2= 0.04 ] nor the interaction between ERP component and group [ F(3, 93) = 0.97, p= 0.97 ,
η2< 0.001] was significant. Further, independent t-tests were conducted to compare
the latencies of the ∆N1 and MMN components between groups. The t-test comparing
∆N1 latency revealed no significant difference between the groups ( t(31) = 0.38, p= 0.35,
Cohen’s d = 0.12 ). Similarly, the t-test comparing MMN latency also showed no significant
group difference ( t(31) = −0.04, p= 0.48, Cohen’s d =−0.01). The latencies of the ∆N1 and
MMN components for each group are depicted in Figures 4C and 4D, respectively.

3.3. SRM
Figure 5 depicts the mean Target-to-Masker Ratios (TMRs) for colocated conditions
(target and maskers at 0◦azimuth) and spatially separated conditions (target at 0◦and
maskers at ±15◦azimuths) in the control and misophonia groups. The magnitude of spatial
release from masking (SRM) for each group is also presented. The results of the two-way
mixed-design ANOVA, which included masker spatial location as the within-subjects
factor and participant group as the between-subject factor, revealed a significant main
effect of masker spatial location [ F(1, 31) = 154.25, p< 0.01, η2= 0.83]. This indicates that
SNR thresholds varied significantly between colocated and spatially separated conditions.
However, the main effects of participant group [ F(1, 31) = 0.20, p= 0.66, η2= 0.01] and the
interaction between participant group and masker spatial location [ F(1, 31) = 0.20, p= 0.66,
η2= 0.01] were not statistically significant.

Figure 5. Spatial release from masking  (SRM): Mean TMRs are plotted for colocated  conditions  (tar-

azimuths)  for the control and misophonia  groups. The amount of SRM for both groups is also pre-
sented. Error bars represent  ±1 SE. 
Post hoc pairwise  comparisons  for the within-subject  factor conﬁrmed that both 
groups exhibited  a signiﬁcant beneﬁt from target–masker  spatial separation,  showing  sub-
stantially  better speech recognition  performance  in the spatially  separated  condition  com-
pared to the colocated  condition  (p < 0.01). Conversely,  between-group  comparisons  re-
vealed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in speech recognition  performance  between the control 
and misophonia  groups under either spatial condition  (spatially  separated:  p = 0.34; colo-
cated: p = 0.51). To compare  the extent of spatial release from masking  (SRM) between the 
groups, SRM values were calculated  for each participant  by subtracting  the TMR thresh-
olds in the colocated  condition  from those in the spatially  separated  condition.  An inde-
pendent-sample  t-test revealed  no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in SRM scores between the 
groups (t(31) = −0.45, p = 0.33, Cohen’s d = −0.16), indicating  that both groups beneﬁtted 
equally from spatial separation  of the target and masker (see Figure 5). 
3.4. Flanker Task 
Figure 6 illustrates  the mean completion  times for the congruent  and incongruent  
sections of the ﬂanker task, along with the conﬂict cost, deﬁned as the diﬀerence in com-
pletion times between these two conditions.  A two-way  mixed-design  ANOVA  was con-
ducted with task type (congruent  vs. incongruent)  as the within-subject  factor and partic-
ipant group as the between-subject  factor. The analysis revealed  a signiﬁcant main eﬀect 
of task type [F(1, 31) = 225.05, p < 0.01, η2 = 0.88], indicating  that completion  times were 
signiﬁcantly longer for incongruent  trials compared  to congruent  trials. However,  neither 
the main eﬀect of group [F(1, 31) = 2.32, p = 0.19, η2 = 0.07] nor the interaction  between task 
type and group [F(1, 31) = 0.80, p = 0.40, η2 = 0.02] was signiﬁcant. These results suggest 
that both groups exhibited  similar ﬂanker completion  times across the task conditions.  
The analysis of conﬂict cost also revealed  no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the control 
and misophonia  groups [t(31) = −0.89, p = 0.38, Cohen’s d = −0.32]. These ﬁndings indicate 
that both groups exhibited  comparable  abilities to focus attention and suppress  interfer-
ence from distracting  stimuli, as measured  by the ﬂanker task. Overall, the results suggest 
that misophonia  is not associated  with deﬁcits in selective  attention or cognitive  control. 
Figure 5. Spatial release from masking (SRM): Mean TMRs are plotted for colocated conditions
(target and maskers at 0◦azimuth) and spatially separated conditions (target at 0◦and maskers at
±15◦azimuths) for the control and misophonia groups. The amount of SRM for both groups is also
presented. Error bars represent ±1 SE.
Post hoc pairwise comparisons for the within-subject factor confirmed that both groups
exhibited a significant benefit from target–masker spatial separation, showing substantially
better speech recognition performance in the spatially separated condition compared to the

Biology 2025 ,14, 238 12 of 19
colocated condition ( p< 0.01). Conversely, between-group comparisons revealed no signifi-
cant differences in speech recognition performance between the control and misophonia
groups under either spatial condition (spatially separated: p= 0.34; colocated: p= 0.51). To
compare the extent of spatial release from masking (SRM) between the groups, SRM values
were calculated for each participant by subtracting the TMR thresholds in the colocated
condition from those in the spatially separated condition. An independent-sample t-test
revealed no significant difference in SRM scores between the groups ( t(31) = −0.45,p= 0.33,
Cohen’s d =−0.16), indicating that both groups benefitted equally from spatial separation
of the target and masker (see Figure 5).
3.4. Flanker Task
Figure 6 illustrates the mean completion times for the congruent and incongruent sec-
tions of the flanker task, along with the conflict cost, defined as the difference in completion
times between these two conditions. A two-way mixed-design ANOVA was conducted
with task type (congruent vs. incongruent) as the within-subject factor and participant
group as the between-subject factor. The analysis revealed a significant main effect of
task type [ F(1, 31) = 225.05, p< 0.01, η2= 0.88], indicating that completion times were
significantly longer for incongruent trials compared to congruent trials. However, neither
the main effect of group [ F(1, 31) = 2.32, p= 0.19, η2= 0.07] nor the interaction between task
type and group [ F(1, 31) = 0.80, p= 0.40, η2= 0.02] was significant. These results suggest
that both groups exhibited similar flanker completion times across the task conditions. The
analysis of conflict cost also revealed no significant difference between the control and
misophonia groups [ t(31) =−0.89, p= 0.38, Cohen’s d =−0.32]. These findings indicate that
both groups exhibited comparable abilities to focus attention and suppress interference
from distracting stimuli, as measured by the flanker task. Overall, the results suggest that
misophonia is not associated with deficits in selective attention or cognitive control.

Data from the 17 participants  with misophonia  were analyzed  to explore the associations  
between the obtained measures  using multiple correlations.  Figure 7 presents a heat map il-
lustrating  the strength of correlations  between the various measures  used in this study. Sig-
nificant correlations  are denoted by asterisks (*** p < 0.001 and ** p < 0.01), based on the uncor-
rected significance  level for multiple comparisons.  Nonsignificant  correlations  are not 
marked. This visualization  provides an overview  of the relationships  between behavioral,  
neural, and self-report  measures,  highlighting  key associations  relevant to understanding  
misophonia.  A Bonferroni-adjusted  significance  level (α = 0.002) was applied to account for 
the 28 comparisons.  Two significant  correlations  were observed.  The A-MISO-S  scores, which 
reflect self-reported  estimates  of misophonia  severity, showed a significant  negative correla-
tion with both ΔN1 amplitude  (r = −0.56, p = 0.019) and MMN amplitude  (r = −0.67, p < 0.002). 
These negative correlations  indicate that as misophonia  severity increases,  the amplitudes  of 
these ERP components  tend to decrease.  However,  only the correlation  between A-MISO-S  
scores and MMN amplitude  remained  significant  after applying  the adjusted alpha threshold  
(α = 0.002), indicating  that the relationship  between misophonia  severity and cortical response  
is particularly  evident in the MMN component.  All other correlations  were not significant,  
even at the uncorrected  alpha level (all p > 0.05). Only noteworthy  (lack of) correlations  are 
highlighted  below.

3.5. Correlation Analyses
Data from the 17 participants with misophonia were analyzed to explore the associa-
tions between the obtained measures using multiple correlations. Figure 7 presents a heat
map illustrating the strength of correlations between the various measures used in this
study. Significant correlations are denoted by asterisks (*** p< 0.001 and **p< 0.01 ), based
on the uncorrected significance level for multiple comparisons. Nonsignificant correlations
are not marked. This visualization provides an overview of the relationships between
behavioral, neural, and self-report measures, highlighting key associations relevant to
understanding misophonia. A Bonferroni-adjusted significance level ( α= 0.002) was ap-

Biology 2025 ,14, 238 13 of 19
plied to account for the 28 comparisons. Two significant correlations were observed. The
A-MISO-S scores, which reflect self-reported estimates of misophonia severity, showed a
significant negative correlation with both ∆N1 amplitude ( r=−0.56, p= 0.019) and MMN
amplitude ( r=−0.67, p< 0.002). These negative correlations indicate that as misophonia
severity increases, the amplitudes of these ERP components tend to decrease. However,
only the correlation between A-MISO-S scores and MMN amplitude remained significant
after applying the adjusted alpha threshold ( α= 0.002), indicating that the relationship
between misophonia severity and cortical response is particularly evident in the MMN
component. All other correlations were not significant, even at the uncorrected alpha level
(allp> 0.05). Only noteworthy (lack of) correlations are highlighted below.

One of the hypotheses of this study was to assess whether individuals with misophonia
exhibit speech perception deficits. The group comparison results indicated no significant
difference in SRM between the groups. Notably, no correlation was also found between SRM
and A-MISO-S scores, suggesting that misophonia severity was not associated with speech
perception in noise. Furthermore, ERP components were not significantly correlated with
SRM, indicating that the physiological deficits observed at the cortical level in individuals
with misophonia, as reflected by the ERP measures, did not necessarily translate into
perceptual deficits in speech perception.
Additionally, no correlation was found between A-MISO-S scores and either ∆N1
latency or MMN latency. Although the amplitudes of these ERP components were reduced
in individuals with misophonia, the latencies were not significantly altered, suggesting that
misophonia severity was not associated with changes in the timing of neural responses.
Finally, the PTAs were not correlated with any of the measures used in the study. More
importantly, neither ∆N1 amplitudes nor MMN amplitudes were correlated with PTA
values, suggesting that the observed individual differences in cortical responses were not
driven by differences in audibility. Instead, these differences appear to reflect variations in
misophonia severity.
4. Discussion
While significant progress has been made in recognizing and establishing diagnostic
criteria for the condition, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms driving miso-
phonia remain elusive. One area of conflict is understanding how the brain processes
auditory stimuli in individuals with misophonia compared to those without the condition.
The objective of this study was to delve deeply into the various facets of physiological,

Biology 2025 ,14, 238 14 of 19
perceptual, and cognitive processing in individuals exhibiting misophonia symptoms,
contrasting them with those who do not manifest such symptoms.
4.1. Hearing Sensitivity Is Unaffected by Misophonia
In this study, no findings consistent with individuals with misophonia having hear-
ing loss were observed. Both individual and group audiograms revealed that pure-tone
averages did not differ significantly between individuals with and without misophonia.
This aligns with previous research indicating that no significant hearing loss is typically ob-
served in individuals with misophonia. Other studies have similarly found no substantial
evidence of hearing disorders among individuals with misophonia [ 3,4,39]. For instance,
Jager et al. [ 4] found that hearing loss prevalence in individuals with misophonia was lower
than in the general population, suggesting misophonia is not closely linked to hearing loss.
Similarly, Siepsiak et al. [ 39] reported no significant differences in pure-tone thresholds or
loudness discomfort levels between individuals with misophonia and healthy controls, fur-
ther supporting the absence of a direct association between misophonia and hearing ability.
Aryal and Prabhu [ 7] also compared hearing thresholds in individuals with and without
misophonia across standard (0.25–8 kHz) and extended high frequencies (9–16 kHz). Their
results showed similar hearing abilities in both groups, indicating that misophonia may
not affect auditory sensitivity. Thus, the findings of this study are consistent with this body
of research and contribute to the growing literature supporting the absence of significant
hearing loss in individuals with misophonia.
4.2. Misophonia Severity: Consistency with Existing Research
The average severity of misophonia symptoms in our study participants was 8.89 on
the A-MISO-S scale, which falls within the mild range, consistent with Schröder et al. [ 3].
Similar findings have been reported in previous studies, where 35% to 50% of individu-
als in help-seeking or student samples exhibited mild symptoms. For example, Naylor
et al. [ 40] found that clinically significant misophonic symptoms were common, affecting
49.1% of their sample in the U.K. Within this experimental group, 37% of participants
experienced mild symptoms, 12% had moderate symptoms, and 0.3% had severe symp-
toms, with no extreme cases identified. Our study’s findings are consistent with Aryal
et al. [ 7], who researched the Indian population and found that the majority of partici-
pants with misophonia exhibited mild symptoms (22.35%). The A-MISO-S questionnaire
demonstrated good internal consistency and validity for assessing misophonia symptoms
among the student population at Towson University. These results suggest that while a
significant number of individuals experience mild symptoms, only a small subset exhibit
severe symptoms. Overall, the severity levels observed in our study align with those
reported in previous population-based research, highlighting the representative nature of
our misophonia sample.
4.3. Physiological Correlates of Misophonia
The most significant finding of this study was the significantly reduced mean ampli-
tude of the auditory N1 and N2 waves in individuals with misophonia compared to the
control group. This reduction in N1 amplitude was observed solely in response to deviant
stimuli, with no significant differences for standard stimuli. Consequently, the derived ∆N1
and MMN response amplitudes, calculated from the N1 amplitudes, were also significantly
diminished in the misophonia group.
These findings suggest that misophonia may involve irregular processing of specific
auditory stimuli, particularly those perceived as deviant or unexpected. Our study aligns
with Schröder et al. [ 8], who also observed a reduction in the N1 amplitude in response to
oddball tones in individuals with misophonia. In their study, regularly repeated 1000 Hz

Biology 2025 ,14, 238 15 of 19
tones were interspersed with deviant 250 Hz and 4000 Hz tones. Similarly, we found
no significant differences in the P1 and P2 components elicited by oddball tones, and
the latencies of these ERP components were unaffected, mirroring Schröder et al.’s [ 8]
findings. Furthermore, our study provides additional evidence that, in individuals with
misophonia, not only is the N1 amplitude diminished in response to deviant tones, but
the N2 component is also reduced. This further supports the notion that misophonia may
involve altered neural processing of unexpected auditory stimuli.
Schröder et al. [8] proposed two possible explanations for the reduced N1 amplitude
observed in individuals with misophonia: increased mood disturbance and psychiatric
comorbidities. Misophonia patients in their study reported significantly higher mood dis-
turbance scores, suggesting a state of general hyperarousal. This heightened arousal could
potentially diminish attention to sounds, explaining the reduction in N1 amplitude. They
also considered the influence of psychiatric comorbidities and psychotropic medication,
factors not assessed in our study, which may have impacted the N1 response (and possibly
N2) in the misophonia group. The N1 component is crucial in studies of auditory attention,
particularly in disorders like schizophrenia, where attenuated N1 responses have been
frequently observed. N1 and N2 is believed to serve as a marker for early attention to
sensory changes [ 41] and may help identify significant auditory events [ 42]. However, our
study found no behavioral evidence of attention deficits in misophonia participants, as
assessed by the flanker task. This suggests that attentional impairments in misophonia, if
present, might be too subtle to detect through behavioral measures.
Additionally, since the flanker task primarily assesses visual attention, it may not
be sensitive enough to detect auditory attention deficits specific to misophonia. A task
designed to assess auditory attention would likely provide better insight into the attentional
mechanisms involved in misophonia. Regarding ERP component latencies, no significant
group differences were observed, consistent with Schröder et al. [ 8]. These findings suggest
that misophonia may not be associated with alterations in the timing of neural responses
as measured by ERP components. However, Aryal and Prabhu [ 43] reported shortened
latencies of early ERP components, particularly P1 and N1, in misophonia patients, sug-
gesting increased activity in subcortical auditory structures. Our study did not observe this
shortening, which may be attributed to methodological differences. Specifically, while we
used an oddball paradigm, Aryal and Prabhu [ 43] employed a standard 500 Hz tone burst
stimulus, which could explain the discrepancy in latency findings.
In summary, our findings contribute to the growing body of research on misopho-
nia’s neurophysiological mechanisms, particularly its impact on the processing of deviant
auditory stimuli. Further research is needed to explore the potential role of subcortical
auditory structures and refine our understanding of how misophonia affects attention and
sensory processing.
4.4. No Evidence of Perceptual Deficits in Misophonia
In our study, speech perception abilities were similar across participant groups, and
misophonia was not found to be associated with deficits in speech perception in noise.
This lack of association could be explained by two possibilities. First, the altered cortical
functions associated with misophonia may not significantly impact the ability to perceive
speech in noisy environments. This would suggest that the neural mechanisms involved
in misophonia are separate from those involved in speech processing in noise. Second,
the speech task used in this study may not have been sensitive enough to detect more
subtle perceptual deficits in individuals with misophonia. The SRM task might not have
adequately challenged participants or captured the specific auditory processing issues
that individuals with misophonia experience. To our knowledge, no study has systemati-

Biology 2025 ,14, 238 16 of 19
cally evaluated the effect of misophonia on speech perception. This underscores the need
for further research to explore the potential impact of misophonia on speech perception
abilities, particularly under varied listening conditions. A conference proceeding by investi-
gated speech perception in noise among individuals with misophonia and reported deficits
in noisy environments [ 44]. However, detailed methodological information (e.g., stimuli
used, severity of misophonia, comorbid status of the participants) is lacking, making it
challenging to directly compare their findings with ours. These discrepancies in method-
ological parameters across studies could contribute to differences in outcomes regarding
the relationship between misophonia and speech perception abilities. Therefore, further
research with well-defined methodologies and comprehensive assessments is needed to
better understand the impact of misophonia on speech perception.
5. Limitations
While this study offers valuable insights into the potential impact of misophonia on
auditory function, it is important to acknowledge several limitations that could affect the
interpretation of the findings. Firstly, the relatively small sample size of 33 participants
(17 misophonics, 16 control subjects) raises concerns about the generalizability of the
results. A larger and more diverse sample could enhance the statistical power of the study,
allowing for more robust conclusions and better detection of subtle differences between
groups. Secondly, the study exclusively focused on college students, which may not
accurately represent the broader population affected by misophonia. Misophonia can affect
individuals of all ages and backgrounds, and limiting the study to this demographic may
restrict the applicability of the findings to other age groups or populations. Furthermore, the
study did not account for potential comorbid conditions that could influence physiological
measurements. Misophonia often coexists with other psychiatric or neurological disorders,
such as anxiety or obsessive–compulsive disorder, which could confound the results.
Future research should consider controlling these comorbidities to better isolate the effects
of misophonia on auditory function. Similarly, another limitation of this study is that we
neither asked participants nor explicitly screened for the presence of tinnitus or hyperacusis.
As these conditions could influence auditory cortical potentials and confound the findings
in the misophonia group, this should be considered when interpreting the results. Future
studies should account for these factors to more accurately isolate the neural and perceptual
effects of misophonia.
Another key limitation of the present study is that cognitive status was assessed
solely with the flanker task, which, while informative, does not provide a comprehen-
sive evaluation of overall cognitive function. Therefore, conclusions about participants’
general cognitive status cannot be made based on this test alone. Similarly, ERP anal-
ysis focused only on cortical responses to standard and deviant tones, specifically the
P1-N1-P2-N2 components. This limits the scope of the findings, as it does not include the
brainstem or other auditory and cognitive potentials that may provide a fuller picture of
misophonia-related neural processes. Future research should include a wider range of
neurophysiological measures for a more complete understanding of the neural mechanisms
involved in misophonia.
Lastly, the use of the A-MISO-S questionnaire as the primary measure of misophonia
severity relies on self-reporting, which introduces the possibility of response bias or inaccu-
rate reporting. Individuals may under-report or over-report their symptoms, leading to
potential inaccuracies in the assessment of misophonia severity. Supplementing self-report
measures with objective measures of misophonia, such as physiological assessments or
behavioral observations, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the con-
dition. Future research with larger and more diverse samples, consideration of comorbid

Biology 2025 ,14, 238 17 of 19
conditions, and incorporation of objective measures of misophonia could further advance
our understanding of this complex disorder.
6. Conclusions
The results of this study suggest selective deficits in cortical event-related ERPs in
individuals with misophonia, specifically reduced amplitudes of the N1 and N2 compo-
nents in response to deviant stimuli, compared to the control group. While these findings
provide an electrophysiological basis for misophonia, no perceptual consequences were
observed, particularly in terms of speech perception or cognitive function. Despite the
altered cortical processing associated with misophonia, participants did not exhibit signifi-
cant differences in hearing thresholds, speech perception abilities, or cognitive function
compared to controls. These results indicate that while misophonia may involve distinct
neurophysiological changes, it does not necessarily lead to perceptual deficits in speech
perception or cognitive function, suggesting that the disorder primarily affects neural
processing without significantly impacting perceptual outcomes.
