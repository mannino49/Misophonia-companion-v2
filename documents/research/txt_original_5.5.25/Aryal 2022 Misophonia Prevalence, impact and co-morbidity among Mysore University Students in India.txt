Abstract: Misophonia is a sound tolerance d isorder in which certain sounds trigger an intensely 
emotional or physiological response caused by an increased autonomic nervous system reaction to 
the triggers. Misophonia is a relatively new condition, and the assessment and management of this 
condition  are not known yet. The epidemiological data of misophonia in the Indian scenario is 
unknown, without which better planning evaluation and management is not possible. Hence, our 
study aims to determine the prevalence of misophonia and its impact and co -morbidity among 
Mysore university students in India. A descriptive cross -sectional study was conducted on 172 
students of Mysore University between the age ranges of 18 to 30 years through an online survey 
mode. The Amsterdam Misophonia Questionnaire (A -MISO-S) and Misophonia Assessment 
Questionnaire (MAQ) have been used to find the prevalence and severity of misophonia. Statistical 
analyses were carried out using SPSS 25.0 software. Data were analy sed using descriptive statistics 
and a chi -square test to de termine the variables' association. The prevalence of misophonia among 
Mysore university students has been documented. Almost 48.27% of participants reported 
misophonia symptoms , and 23.28% reported clinically significant misophonia. The result showed 
that misophonia could occur in isolation or with a co -morbid condition such as tinnitus and 
hyperacusis. Statistical analysis showed no association between gender and the occurrence of 
misophonia. Misophonia is a prevalent neurophysiological condition with a s ignificant impact on the 
quality of life of the sufferers. This is the first study of this kind in an Indian scenario and can be a 
guiding tool for researchers to know about the prevalence of misophonia, its impact, and co -
morbidity among the sufferers.

1.0  INTRODUCTION  
Misophonia  is derived from the Greek word misos (hate) 
and phone (voice), which means hatred of sound. 
Misophonia or sound selectivity syndrome is a sound tolerance disorder in which certain sounds trigger an 
intensely emotional or physiological response caused by 
an increased autonomic nervous system reaction to 
such triggers ( Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014 ). The  OPEN ACCESS  | RESEARCH NOTES                                                ISSN: 2576 -828X

NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH NOTES | 20 22 | VOLUME 5 | ISSUE 4 | ARTICLE 161  | PAGE 2 aversive triggers can be the sound made by humans , like 
chewing, lip -smacking, breathing  and swallowing,  or 
they  can also be the sounds produced by human s but 
not directly related to the human body , like pen clicking, 
rustling, and typing ( Jastreboff et al., 2001 ). When 
exposed to specific auditory triggers; people with 
misop honia show different physiological and emotional 
reactions like increased heart rate, sweating, anxiety, 
anger, irritation, and disgust.  
 
The adverse emotional reaction in the misophonic 
individual created by different triggers may be 
connected to a specif ic person making the sounds 
(Schröder et al., 2013 ). This type of connection may 
affect the interpersonal relationship with friends, family 
members, and relatives, which may impact the quality 
of life of sufferers. Also, th e sufferers are never sure 
when the trigger sound might be heard and live in a 
perceptual state of anxiety. Due to this reason, they may 
start avoiding people, places, and situations that they 
think will cause the trigger sounds. Overall, the quality 
of life of the sufferers gets affected due to the physical 
and emotional discomfort they face daily.  
 
Misophonia is a condition that can occur in isolation or 
conjunction with other psychiatric disorders such as 
obsessive -compulsive disorders (OCD), attenti on deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  and mood disorders . 
Furthermore, misophonia frequently coexists with 
related sound disorders such as tinnitus, hyperacusis, 
and phonophobia, which must be distinguished 
(Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014 ). Tinnitus is the 
perception of sound in the absence of acoustic 
stimulation, which is  mainly associated with hearing loss 
(Waechter, 2021 ). On the other hand, hyperacusis is the 
increased sensitivity to the sounds, which results in pain 
or the sufferers feeling uncomfortable and related to 
the intensity ( Tyler et al., 2014 ). However, misophonia 
is distinct from these disorders, although there is some 
overlap in  symptoms, and an individual may present 
with more than one condition ( Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 
2001 ; Jastreboff & Hazell, 2004 ). 
 
Evidence shows that misophonia  is associated with the 
enhanced auditory, limbic and autonomic nervous 
system s (Jastreboff & Hazell, 2004 ). Jastreboff & 
Jastreboff ( 2002 ) described misophonia using the 
neurophysiolo gical model as the dislike/hatred of 
sound , which reflects abnormally strong reactions of the 
autonomic and limbic systems. This results  enhanced 
connections between the auditory, limbic and 
autonomic systems or enhanced reactivity of the limbic 
and autonom ic system s to sound. The neurophysiological structure involved in processing the 
sounds at the higher auditory level may be affected due 
to the nature of misophonia ( Moeller, 2011 ). 
 
The  onset  of  the  problem  in  misophonia   patients has  
been reported variably across the literature. Few 
studies have reported that the onset is during 
adolescence ( Palumbo et al., 2018 ) or adulthood 
(Sanchez & Silva, 2018 ). Some studies report no age 
criteria for misophonia , as it can happen at any age 
(Potgieter et al., 2019 ). Very few studies have been 
reported regarding the prevalence of misophonia. The 
prevalence of misophonia in non -clinical populations is 
not known. A case study by Hadjipavlou et al. ( 2008 ) 
reported that the prevalence of misophonia is between  
10-60% in patients with tinnitus. In a study conducted 
by  Naylor et al. ( 2021 ), clinically significant misophonia 
was found in 49.1% of the study sample population of 
UK undergraduate medical students. Similarly, Wu et al. 
(2014 ) used an online questionnaire survey to find that 
19.9% of 483 US undergraduate students had 
misophonia. Misophonia was shown to be prevalent in 
20% of 415 Chinese graduates , as reported by Zhou et 
al. (2017 ). Hence, it can be stated that the prevalence of 
misophonia does not differ by age, gender or ethnicity.  
 
In India, no investigation has been  conducted to 
determine the prevalence of misophonia. This will be 
the first study of its kind  and will be extremely useful in 
demonstrating the prevalence of misophonia in the 
Indian context and motivating professionals to develop 
assessment and management procedures. The aim s of 
this study include : 1.) To determine the prevalence of 
misophonia among Mys ore university students. 2.) To 
provide descriptive information regarding the 
symptoms of misophonia (frequency and severity of 
symptoms) 3.) Discuss misophonia co -morbidity with 
other auditory and psychiatric disorders; 4.) To describe 
the impact of misop honia on daily life, and 5.) To focus 
the discussion on raising misophonia awareness among 
the general audience.  
 
2.0  MATERIALS  AND METHODS  
A descriptive cross -sectional study was undertaken 
among Mysore University's undergraduates and post -
graduate students. Data was obtained from 172 
participants who were literate and had good English 
language competency. The study was conducted over a 
perio d of three months, from October 2021 to 
December 2021. The participants were all between 18 
and 30 years, with a mean age of 22 years and a 
standard deviation of 2.5 years. The study comprised 
participants from various educational fields such a s law,

NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH NOTES | 20 22 | VOLUME 5 | ISSUE 4 | ARTICLE 161  | PAGE 3 business, medicine, audiology, and speech -language 
pathology.  
 
2.1  Design of the Questionnaire  
A survey questionnaire was prepared regarding the 
prevalence, impact, and co -morbidity of misophonia. 
Amsterdam Misophonia Questionnaire ( Schröder et al., 
2013 ) and Misophonia assessment questionnaire ( Wu 
et al., 2014 ) were adopted to find the severity of the 
misophonia. Amsterdam Misophonia Questionnaire is 
the first questionnaire designed for a ssessing 
misophonia by Schröder et al. ( 2013 ). Translation and 
validation of this questionnaire are done in several 
languages, such as English  and Turkish,  to determine its 
reliability and validity ( Naylor et al., 2021 ; Sarigedik & 
Gulle, 2021 ). In the UK population, where the native 
language is English, this questionnaire has been found 
to be reliable, with Chronbach's alpha value of 0.8 14 
(Naylor et al., 2021 ). 
 
Similarly, Johnson developed the Misophonia 
Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ) and revised Dozier to 
evaluate the severity of misophonia in the adult 
population ( Dozier, 2015 ). Recently, this questionnaire 
has been validated in the Turkish language and found to 
be reliable, with Chronbach's alpha value of 0.94 ( Altın, 
2021 ). There is a lack of misophonia questionnaires in 
the native Indian la nguage, so the English version of 
these two questionnaires was used in the study. The 
survey questionnaire was written in English and 
included sections on consent and demographic 
information, hearing issues, sound disorders, the A -
MISO -S questionnaire, the  Misophonia evaluation 
questionnaire, co -morbidity, and coping strategies. A 
total of 48 questions make up the survey. The first five 
questions dealt with the patient demographics, and the 
next ten were related to hearing issues and the 
presence of other s ound disorders , such as 
tinnitus/hyperacusis. It also had six questions of the A -
MISO -S scale, 21 questions from MAQ and the final six 
were related to co -morbidity of other health problems, 
misophonic sound coping strategies, and patient 
motivation  to learn  about misophonia.  
 
At the Amsterdam Medical Centre, the Amsterdam 
Misophonia Questionnaire (A -MISO -S) scale was 
created to determine the severity of misophonia. The 
questionnaire comprises six questions with a score 
range of 0 to 24. The scale measures ho w much time an 
individual spends occupied by misophonic sounds, how 
much misophonic sounds interfere with the individual's 
work and social functioning, the individual's level of 
anger in response to sounds, level of resistance to the impulse, level of cont rol over thoughts and anger, and 
how much time an individual spends avoiding 
misophonia situations. Subclinical misophonic 
symptoms are rated 0 –4, mild symptoms are rated 5 –9, 
moderate symptoms are rated 10 –14, severe symptoms 
are rated 15 –19, and extreme symptoms are rated 20 -
24. 
 
The Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ) is a 
21-item questionnaire with a four -point Likert -type 
rating scale that assesses the impact of misophonia in a 
person's life. This questionnaire has a score range of 0 -
63, with 0 -11 indicating subclinical symptoms, 12 -24 
mild, 25 -37 moderate, 38 -50 severe, and 51 -63 extreme 
misophonia.  
 
The researchers distributed the final version of the 
questionnaire as an e -survey in the form of Google 
forms to university students using various s ocial 
platforms , such as WhatsApp, and Gmail, using 
convenient sampling methods. A brief description of 
misophonia was included in the Google form. The poll 
received responses from 172 Mysore university 
students aged 18 to 30. Because two participants 
refus ed to consent, they were removed from the study, 
and only 170 participants were considered for analysis.  
 
2.2  Statistical analysis  
The investigator analy sed the questionnaire responses 
and converted them to numbers using Microsoft Excel. 
Statistical progr am for social science (SPSS Version 25.) 
software was used to analy se the data collected. The 
sort of issues being addressed determined the use of 
descriptive statistical approaches such as frequency and 
percentages. A non -parametric Chi -square test was 
done to check the association among different 
variables.  
 
2.3  Informed Consent and Ethical Guidelines  
The study followed the ethical principles established by 
the All India  Institute of Speech and Hearing (AIISH) in 
Mysore. All participants gave their informed consent by 
answering a question on the google form. The study 
omitted those participants who did not complete the 
survey.  
 
3.0  RESULTS  
3.1  Descriptive  characteristics of participants  
Data were analy sed using descriptive statistics. Among 
170 participants included in the study, 32 (18.8%) were 
male, and 138 (81.2%) were female. All the participants 
were literate with the minimum qualification of 
undergra duate. Out of 170 participants who were taken

NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH NOTES | 20 22 | VOLUME 5 | ISSUE 4 | ARTICLE 161  | PAGE 4 randomly for the study, only 9 (5.29%) participants 
reported having an ear -related problem like Eustachian 
tube dysfunction, tympanic membrane perforation  and 
reduced hearing sensitivity . Most of the particip ants, 
62.94%, reported that they have a habit of listening to 
music at a loud volume. Only 4 (2.4%) participants 
reported the problem of hearing loss. The descriptive 
characteristics of all the participants are shown in Table 
1.

3.2  Tinnitus, Hyperacusis, and Misophonia  
Among 170 participants who responded to the survey, 
81 (47.6%) reported having misophonia based on their 
subjective experience. Among 81 (47.6%) participants 
who reported misophonia, 13 (16.05%) were male, and 
68 (83.95%) were female. Similarly, 38 out of 170 
participants (22.4%) reported having tinnitus, and 30 
out of 170 (17.6%) reported having hyperacusis. After 
detailed analysis, the result showed that 21 participants 
out of 81 (25.93%) reporting misophonia also reported 
tinnitus as a co -morbid conditio n. Similarly, 22 out of 81 
(27.16%) reporting misophonia also reported 
hyperacusis as a co -morbid condition. The results 
indicate that misophonia can occur in isolation or with 
other associated auditory disorders , such as tinnitus and 
hyperacusis. However, these data on tinnitus and 
hyperacusis are entir ely based on the subjective 
description of the participants based on the single 
questions used in the survey. No separate 
questionnaires were used to assess tinnitus and 
hyperacusis in an individual with mi sophonia. There is a 
need to assess the association between tinnitus, hyperacusis and misophonia using separate 
questionnaires to validate the findings. This data also 
shows that misophonia is a more common disorder ; 
many are unaware of this condition and are not seeking 
professional help.  
 
3.3  Triggers of Misophonia  
All the participants who reported the problem of 
misophonia responded to the Amsterdam Misophonia 
Questionnaire (A -MISO -S) and listed all the sounds that 
trigger misophonia . 
 
Out of 81 (47.6%)  participants who reported a problem 
of irritation with the sounds, most of the participants 
reported multiple sounds as a trigger. A total of 133 
triggers were reported by 81 participant s, and a few 
reported common triggers. After analysis, the result 
showed that individuals with misophonia reported 30 
different triggers . Most participants, 30 (37.04%), 
reported chalk scratching as the trigger, followed by 
loud sounds 15 (18.52%) and chewing 12 (14.81%). The 
details about all the triggers reported by all the 
participants are shown in Table 2 . 
 
3.4  Severity of Misophonia  
All 81 (48.27%) participants who reported misophonia 
symptoms answered all the Amsterdam Misophonia  
Scale Questionnaire questions. The severity of the 
misophonia was assessed by calculating the total scores 
obtained by each participant. The maximum score 
obtained was 14, and the minimum was one with a 
mean score of 5.36 and a standard deviation (SD) of 
3.16. The score of 33 (19.41%) participants ranges from 
0-4 and is classified as subclinical misophonia, the score 
of 38 (22.35%) participants ranges from 5 -9 and is 
classified as Mild misophonia and the score of 10 
(5.88%) participants ranges from 10 -14 a nd classified as 
Moderate Misophonia. These scores showed that even 
though 81 (48.27%) among 170 participants reported 
misophonia symptoms, only 48 (23.28%) reported 
clinically significant misophonia that warrants 
treatment.  
 
Misophonia assessment Question naire was also 
administered among 81 participants who reported 
misophonia symptoms. The maximum score obtained 
was 42, and the minimum was 0, with a mean score of 
3.09 and a standard deviation (SD) of 7.18. The score of 
65 participants (38.25%) ranged from  0-11 and were 
classified as having subclinical misophonia. The score of 
10 participants (5.88%) ranged from 12 -24 and were 
classified as having mild misophonia.  Four participants

(2.35%)  had a  score  from  25-37 and were classified as 
having moderate misophonia.  The score of two 
participants (1.18%) ranged from 38 -50 and were 
classified as severe misophonia.  The score obtained 
from the Misopho nia assessment questionnaire showed 
that 9.41% of participants among 170 participants had 
clinically significant misophonia, which warrants 
treatment. The difference in the prevalence percentage 
among the administration of the Amsterdam 
Misophonia Scale Qu estionnaire and Misophonia 
Assessment questionnaire may be due to the pattern of 
the questionnaire and the different scoring systems 
used in the questionnaire. Table 3  shows t he comparison of  the severity  of the misophonia  between  
the two questionnaire s. 
 
3.4 Co -morbidities of misophonia with other disorders  
Out of 81 participants who reported misophonia 
symptoms, only 10 (12.35%) reported having additional 
health problems like headaches, migraines, 
hypothyroidism  and asthma . Regarding th e 
psychological issues, 16 participants (19.75%) reported 
they have psychological co -morbidities like anxiety, 
depression  and mood disorders  and 14 (17.28%) 
participants reported balance problems like dizziness, 
giddiness, vertigo  and motion sickn ess.

Regarding family history, seven participants (8.64%) 
reported having other family members and suffering 
from misophonia. The rest of the participants did not 
have any family history of misophonia.  
 
3.6  Coping strategies and motivation to learn about 
their problems  
Out of 81 participants who reported misophonia, 10 
participants (12.35%) reported using coping strategies 
to get rid of misophonia. Most of the participants 
reported using multiple coping strategies in different 
situations. Altogether 42 copi ng strategies were 
reported by 10 participants, and few coping strategies 
are common among the participants. After analysis, the 
results showed that individuals with misophonia report 
ten different coping strategies . Most participants, 8 
(80%), reported av oiding people, situations, and places 
as the coping strategy, followed by Sleep, as reported 
by 60% of participants. The details of the coping 
strategies used by participants are shown in Table 4. 
 
Among 170 participants who responded to the survey 
through various platforms, 87 participants (51.2%) 
reported they wanted to know about misophonia. Most 
participants wanted  to know misophonia aetiology, 
mechanism, assessment, and treatment .

4.0  DISCUSSION  
Misophonia  is a condition that borders psychology and 
audiology. In psychology, researchers are trying to 
explain misophonia as a psychiatric disorder ( Schröder 
et al., 2013 ). They try to assess and treat the patient 
with misophonia using the psychiatric approach. 
However, in audiology, misophonia is less explored and 
is a relatively new term. Nevertheless, the prevalence of 
misophonia is increasing with time, and many 
misoph onia patients seek professional help ( Zhou et al., 
2017 ; Wu et al., 2014 ). 
 
Naylor et al. (2021 ) reported clinically significant 
misophonia in 49.1% of the study sample population 
among UK undergraduate medical student s. Similarly, a 
study done by Wu et al. ( 2014 ) reported a prevalence of 
misophonia at 19.9 % in  the sample of 483 US 
undergraduate students using an online questionnaire 
study. Another study by Zhou et al. ( 2017 ) found the 
prevalence of misophonia to be 20% among 415 
Chinese graduates. Comparable to these studies, our 
study found the prevalence of misophonia to be 23.28% 
among 170 graduate stude nts at Mysore University.  
 
Jastreboff & Jastreboff ( 2002 ) reported that misophonia 
triggers need not be only related to the human body. 
The sound produced by people but not directly related 
to the human body, for example , pen clicking, rustling  
and tapping , can also trigge r misophonia. Similar results 
were observed in the present study. Various triggers 
related to the human body, both directly and indirectly, 
have been noted. A chalk scratching sound, a sound not 
directly related to the human body, is the most common 
trigger reported by our study participants , as reported 
by 37.04 % of participants. Our findings are contrary to 
the findings of Jastreboff & Jastreboff ( 2014), who 
reported that most aversive triggers are the sounds Coping strategies used by individuals

and breathing sounds. Brout et al. ( 2018 ) reported that 
acoustic characteristics of sounds do not impact  
emotional arousal. However, the impact of acoustical 
characteristics of the triggers on emotional arousal has 
not been explored, and there is a need to carry out such 
a study using the neurophysiological measure in the 
future.  
 
Misophonia is a condition t hat occurs in isolation a nd 
with other psychiatric and auditory disorders. In our 
study, we found that among 47.6 % of participants 
reporting misophonia symptoms, almost one -fourth of 
the participants (25.93%) reported tinnitus in 
association, similar to t he findings of Kochkin et al. 
(2011 ). Misophonia is a condition that can occur in 
isolation as a separate disorder. Misophonia also occurs 
in association with other psychiatric conditions like 
obsessive -compulsive disorders (OCD), attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  and mood disorders . 
Schröder et al. ( 2013 ) proposed diagnostic criteria 
stating that misophonia is a separate psychiatric 
disorder due to the high occurrence of misop honia with 
psychiatric co -morbidities. In our study, among 81 
participants reporting misophonia symptoms, only 
19.75% of participants reported having psychiatric 
issues. These data show that misophonia does not 
always occur with psychiatric disorders, even  though it 
can be a symptom of psychiatric disorders. However, 
the findings of our study about psychiatric co -
morbidities are based on the subjective explanation of 
the participants based on the single question used in the 
survey. There is a need to carry out a more focused 
study using separate questionnaires related to 
psychiatric illness to validate the findings.  
 
Edelstein et al. ( 2013 ) have reported that misophonia is 
a hereditary problem , as they found a family history in 
misophonic individuals. However, in our study, only 
8.64% of participants reported having a family history of 
misophonia. These contradictory findings may be due to 
inadequate sample size, lack of a separate standardi sed 
questionnaire to assess the aetiology of the misophonia, 
and participants' lack of awareness about the 
misophonia. This result showed a need to explore the 
aetiology of misophonia, considering a larger sample 
size and using a focused methodology.  
 
The literature states  that the prevalence of misophonia 
is not associated with gender ( Zhou et al., 2017 ; Wu et 
al., 2014 ). Results from our study also showed no 
association between gender a nd the occurrence of 
misophonia supporting these findings. However, the lack of association might be due to fewer male subjects 
participating in the study than  female participants. T o 
validate the conclusion, there  is a need to survey the 
future with equal distribution of males and females .  
 
There are few questionnaires developed for the 
assessment of misophonia. The Amsterdam misophonia 
scale (A -MISO -S) checklist developed by Schröder et al. 
(2013) and the Misophonia  assessment questionnaire 
(MAQ) developed by Wu et al.  (2014 ) is the two most 
commonly used. However, the psychometric properties 
of these questionnaires are not known much. In our 
study, the prevalence of misophonia is found to  be 
significantly different among A -MISO -S and MAQ, which 
may be due to different scoring criteria or the  poor 
psychometric properties of the questionnaire. Hence, 
there is a need to develop a standardi sed questionnaire 
in the native Indian language for as sessing misophonia, 
which is lacking in the current scenario. In addition, we 
have to rule out the other diagnostic measures that may 
account for sound sensitivity by administering major 
diagnostic tools that may be necessary.  
 
Various audiological and psy chological approaches , 
such as tinnitus retraining therapy and Cognitive 
Behaviour Therapy , are used to manage misophonia. 
This study suggests that most individuals do not know 
about misophonia management and do not opt for 
management from professionals. How ever, they have 
been affected in their daily lives due to misophonia. Few 
participants reported using coping strategies for 
misophonia , and n one of the participants reported that 
they were taking treatment from the concerned health 
professionals. This suggests  that people are unaware of 
the effect of misophonia and do not see it as a 
significant concern, even though it impacts  their daily 
lifestyle. This may be due to the hidden nature of the 
disorder and lack of awareness about misophonia 
among the general pub lic. Hence, it is essential to carry 
out awareness programs about misophonia and its 
consequences among the general public.  
 
5.0  CONCLUSIONS  
Even though significant progress has been made in the 
field of misophonia, it is not regarded as a separate 
disord er by any official diagnostic system, either by the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
Fifth Edition (DSM -V) or the International Classification 
of Diseases, Eleventh Edition (ICD -11). The result of our 
study showed that the prevalence of mi sophonia is high 
among Mysore university students. However , little  
research has been done on misophonia, exploring 
pathophysiology, assessment, and management.

NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH NOTES | 20 22 | VOLUME 5 | ISSUE 4 | ARTICLE 161  | PAGE 8 People are unaware of misophonia management and  
are not seeking professional help. Th erefore, it can be 
hypothesi sed that highlighting more epidemiological 
data will help recogni se misophonia as a separate and 
genuine disorder. This would provide a path for 
investigating and managing misophonia using a team 
approach, including audiologists . 
 
There is a shortage of studies on the epidemiological 
data on misophonia in the Indian context a nd 
worldwide, as this is a relatively new condition. As this 
is the first study of this kind in the Indian context, it can 
be a guiding tool f or future researchers about the 
prevalence of misophonia, its impact, and co -morbidity 
among the sufferers. The sample size of our study is not 
adequate. Therefore, there is a need to carry out further 
studies in the future, considering the appropr iate 
sample size. There are no questionnaires on misophonia 
developed and standardi sed in the Indian languages. 
This study was conducted by administering the English 
version of the misophonia questionnaire to the Indian 
population, which is the study's limitation . Hence, there 
is a need to develop the questionnaire in the native 
Indian language in the future, and more research has to be carried out using the questionnaires developed in 
the native language to replicate the findings. This study 
considered only young  adults from Mysore University 
for participation. Future studies can further look into 
various age groups, compare the prevalence in all those 
age groups, and compare the awareness in different 
geographical areas across India so that appropriate 
awareness -generating programs about misophonia 
could be planned better.
