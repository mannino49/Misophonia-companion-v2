ABSTRACT
The Veterans Affairs (VA) Rehabilitation Research & Devel-
opment (RR&D) National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research
(NCRAR) was ﬁrst funded by the RR&D Service in 1997 and has beenfunded continuously since that time. The overall purpose of the
NCRAR is to “improve the quality of life of Veterans and others
with hearing and balance problems through clinical research, technolo-gy development, and education that leads to better patient care” ( www.
ncrar.research.va.gov ). An important component of the research con-
ducted at the NCRAR has been a focus on clinical and rehabilitativeaspects of tinnitus. Multiple investigators have received grants to
conduct tinnitus research and the present article provides an overview
of this research from the NCRAR’s inception through 2021.THIEME

KEYWORDS: tinnitus, assessment, intervention, research, review
The National Center for Rehabilitative
Auditory Research (NCRAR) was established
in 1997 at the Veterans Affairs (VA) PortlandHealth Care System (VAPORHCS) in Port-
land, Oregon. The NCRAR is one of 13
research centers supported by the VA Rehabili-tation Research & Development (RR&D) Ser-
vice. Each of the RR&D centers focuses on a
speciﬁc health condition that is of relevance tothe U.S. military Veterans. The NCRAR is the
only RR&D center that focuses on auditory and
vestibular research. Most of the research hasbeen of a clinical nature involving human
participants. The NCRAR does not directly
conduct animal research.
The purpose of this article is to summarize
the tinnitus research that has been conducted by
NCRAR investigators. The amount and scopeof the research is substantial; descriptions of the
different studies are accordingly brief, while key
ﬁndings are highlighted.
The genesis of tinnitus research at the
NCRAR traces back to James Henry being
hired by John McDermott in 1987 as a researchaudiologist at the VAPORHCS. Being in-
volved in research inspired Henry to return to
school to earn a PhD, and he enrolled in theBehavioral Neuroscience doctoral program at
Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)
in 1988. He spent the next 6 years in thatprogram while working half-time for McDer-
mott and Stephen Fausti. His doctoral training
laboratory was the Oregon Hearing ResearchCenter (OHRC). The OHRC, which is the
research arm of the Department of Otolaryn-
gology—Head and Neck Surgery at OHSU,housed the OHSU Tinnitus Clinic.
1The di-
rector of the OHRC was Jack Vernon who
pioneered tinnitus research and developed themasking technique for tinnitus intervention.
2
The OHRC had other tinnitus researchers,including Mary Meikle who was Henry’s re-search advisor. Under Meikle’s tutelage, Henry
completed a master’s degree in behavioral neu-
roscience, which involved a project to comparepulsed versus continuous tones for assessment
of tinnitus loudness.
3His doctoral dissertation
addressed the question of whether loudnessrecruitment was responsible for the paradoxi-
cally small size of tinnitus loudness matches.4
These projects set the stage for Henry to further
pursue tinnitus psychoacoustic assessment,
resulting in his ﬁrst research grant fromRR&D in 1995. Hence, tinnitus research was
already underway at the VAPORHCS when
the NCRAR was ﬁrst funded. Tinnitus re-search at the NCRAR has been ongoing since
then, and numerous other NCRAR investiga-
tors have conducted their own studies, includ-ing (in alphabetical order) Kathleen Carlson,
Robert Folmer, Erin Martz, Candice Quinn,
Kelly Reavis, Sarah Theodoroff, and TaraZaugg. Each of these investigators has received
grant funding to conduct tinnitus research
under the auspices of the NCRAR. Manymore individuals, both internal and external
to the NCRAR, have contributed to the differ-
ent tinnitus studies. Their names appear ascoauthors on the publications that are cited
throughout this article.
TINNITUS ASSESSMENT
“Diagnosing” tinnitus relies entirely on apatient’s self-report—objective detection of
the tinnitus sensation (the sound itself) is not
usually possible.
5,6Further, perceiving a phan-
tom sound does not determine how a person’s
life may be affected by that perception. Chronic
tinnitus is experienced by 10 to 15% of alladults.
7Only about one in ﬁve of those, how-
ever, will seek professional services.8For the
remainder, the sensation is most likely ignoredmost of the time.
For individuals with bothersome tinnitus,
available interventions are intended to mitigatethe sensation of tinnitus and/or the effects of
tinnitus. The sensation of tinnitus is often asses-
sed using rating scales and psychoacoustic testingmethods.
5,6A number of questionnaires have
been developed and validated for assessing effects
of tinnitus (e.g., concentration difﬁculties, sleepdisturbance, emotional distress, feelings of intru-
siveness, and reduced sense of control).HISTORY OF TINNITUS RESEARCH AT THE VA NCRAR/ HENRY ET AL 5

Psychoacoustic Assessment
Tinnitus psychoacoustic research has been a
mainstay at the NCRAR throughout its history.Henry and colleagues developed computer-au-
tomated methods to perform tinnitus psycho-
acoustic assessment.
9,10The idea of using
computer automation to conduct this testing
originated from Stephen Fausti, founder and
previous director of the NCRAR. This line ofresearch has been near-continuous since 1995,
with seven successive grants funded by RR&D
and 15 peer-reviewed articles published to date.In 2009, we received the Technology Innovation
Award from OHSU for our work on the com-
puter-automated Tinnitus Evaluation System(TES). In 2015, the TES was patented and
the rights to its commercial production were
licensed. TES research is currently funded byRR&D through 2024 to obtain normative tin-
nitus psychoacoustic data, which are essential for
standardization of these measures.
The TES has been shown to (1) obtain
measures of tinnitus loudness and pitch that are
comparable to the same measures obtained byan audiologist using a clinical audiometer
11; (2)
obtain reliable hearing thresholds with 1-dB
resolution in normal-hearing and cochlear-im-paired listeners
12,13; (3) obtain reliable tinnitus
loudness matches with 1-dB resolution across
the test-frequency range (0.25–16 kHz)14
(loudness matches were equally reliable at all
frequencies, including at the tinnitus pitch-
matched frequency); (4) obtain reliable measu-res of tinnitus noise-matching, minimum mas-
king levels, and residual inhibition (RI;
temporary suppression of tinnitus followingcertain sound stimulation)
15; (5) enable efﬁ-
cient patient control of stimulus parameters
during testing16; and (6) conduct tinnitus pitch
matching using Bayesian methodology to
improve precision of the measures.17Other
ﬁndings using the TES include the following:(1) psychoacoustic testing was not shown to be
useful for detecting tinnitus malingering
18–20;
(2) comparing measures of tinnitus loudness(loudness matching, constrained loudness scal-
ing, and a numeric rating scale [NRS]) revealed
only weak-to-moderate correlations
21; and (3)
psychoacoustic measures of tinnitus appear
unrelated to the impact of tinnitus, as assessed
by a subjective outcome instrument.22Theselatter two studies were published by Quinn
(formerly Manning) who was a postdoctoral
researcher at the NCRAR from 2015 to 2021.
A tinnitus assessment often includes test-
ing loudness discomfort levels (LDLs) due to
hyperacusis (decreased loudness tolerance) be-ing commonly comorbid with tinnitus. Zaugg
and colleagues conducted a study showing that
LDLs show a low correlation with subjectivereports of loudness tolerance problems in daily
life.
23Also pursuing this avenue of research,
Theodoroff investigated an alternative ap-proach to measuring loudness perception that
does not require presenting high intensities
with the risk of exacerbating hyperacusis.
24
Results of this pilot study demonstrated it
was possible to characterize deviations in loud-
ness perception using low-to-moderate inten-sity levels that represent the majority of sounds
encountered in everyday life.
Tinnitus Questionnaires
For people seeking clinical care for tinnitus, oneof the ﬁrst steps is to complete a tinnitus
questionnaire. The questionnaire provides an
overall score (an “index score”) that indicateshow much the tinnitus is responsible for causing
negative reactions and adversely affecting
patients’ quality of life.
TINNITUS FUNCTIONAL INDEX
Henry and Folmer collaborated with Meikle onan application to the Tinnitus Research Con-
sortium (TRC—a funding agency for tinnitus
research supported by private philanthropy).The application was made in response to the
TRC’s request for proposals to develop a new
tinnitus questionnaire, which they named theTinnitus Functional Index (TFI). The TRC
announcement explained that none of the exis-
ting questionnaires (at least nine at the time)adequately addressed the different dimensions
for which tinnitus could affect a person. The
announcement also noted that the existingquestionnaires differed in many respects (such
as formatting, scaling of responses, and word-
ing). Also, none of the questionnaires wasdesigned and tested speciﬁcally to maximize
sensitivity to changes in effects of tinnitus that
may result from therapy (i.e., “responsiveness”).6 SEMINARS IN HEARING/VOLUME 45, NUMBER 1 2024 #2023. THE AUTHOR(S).

It was therefore stipulated by the TRC how the
TFI would be constructed, and that it would be
validated for detecting responsiveness to changeas a result of intervention for tinnitus.
Developing the TFI required 4 years of
effort involving ﬁve clinical (audiology) sitesand 20 investigators around the country, and
almost 700 patients from the audiology cli-
nics.
25Its development involved iteratively
selecting and reﬁning items and outcomes.
The ﬁnal TFI version, which contains 8 dimen-
sions and 25 items, was published in 2012 in thejournal Ear and Hearing .
26In 2013, the journal
announced that the publication received its
Editor’s Award for Outstanding Research inAudiology and Hearing Science.
The TFI was copyrighted by OHSU,
which has received numerous requests to usethe instrument both for clinical and research
purposes. As a result, the TFI received the Top
Copyright License Award by OHSU in 2019.OHSU also receives requests to translate the
TFI, with translations thus far into more than
20 languages.
Because of its responsiveness to treatment-
related change, as well as its other properties,
the TFI has the potential to become a standardfor evaluating effects of tinnitus, both with
clinical patients and in research studies. Most
of the credit, of course, goes to Mary Meikle,the main author and driver of the project from
start to ﬁnish.
27,28
TINNITUS AND HEARING SURVEY
A key concern when conducting a tinnitus
evaluation is determining whether the tinnitusis bothersome.
29It would seem that a tinnitus
questionnaire such as the TFI would be sufﬁ-
cient to make such a determination. The con-cern, however, is that people who have both
tinnitus and hearing difﬁculty often blame the
tinnitus for the hearing problem.
30When this
occurs, responses to questions asking about
effects of tinnitus can instead reﬂect primarily
the hearing problem. Such a result then artiﬁ-cially elevates the tinnitus questionnaire’s over-
all (index) score. This concern led to our
development of the Tinnitus and HearingSurvey (THS).
31
The THS is a one-page instrument con-
taining 10 items. The ﬁrst four items (SectionA) inquire about common tinnitus problems
that would not be caused by a hearing problem
(difﬁculty falling asleep, difﬁculty concentrat-ing on reading in a quiet room, etc.).
The second four items (Section B) address
common hearing problems that would not becaused by tinnitus (e.g., understanding speech
in noisy situations). Combined with results
from an audiologic evaluation, responses tothese eight items provide information that
can be valuable in counseling patients regarding
differences between hearing loss and tinnitus.The information helps the clinician and patient
to collaboratively reach agreement on whether
clinical services for tinnitus and/or hearing lossmight be needed. The ﬁnal two items on the
THS (Section C) probe for a sound tolerance
problem (which can be any combination ofhyperacusis, misophonia, noise sensitivity, and
phonophobia).
32Our continued use of the
THS, and its use by clinicians and other resear-chers, has led to our recommendation to use this
instrument as part of a standard audiologic
assessment of patients who complain of tinnitusand to screen candidates for tinnitus interven-
tion trials.
33
TINNITUS SCREENER
We also created the Tinnitus Screener, a six-
item algorithm for categorizing tinnitus withrespect to its temporal characteristics.
34Such
categorization is essential to promote standard-
ization of tinnitus deﬁnitions and facilitatemore precise estimates of the prevalence of
tinnitus. This need became evident when star-
ting our epidemiology study (described later)because it often was not clear what a person
meant when stating they “have tinnitus.”
With the Tinnitus Screener, individuals
are categorized as having “constant” tinnitus
(always or usually heard in a quiet room),
“intermittent” tinnitus (lasting /C213 minutes
and occurring at least weekly), “occasional”
tinnitus (lasting /C213 minutes but experienced
less than weekly), “temporary” tinnitus (causedby a recent event, then resolving), or “no”
tinnitus (individuals experiencing only transient
ear noise
35or sudden brief unilateral tapering
tinnitus36are included in the no-tinnitus
category).34Table 1 shows, for each category,
the frequency of tinnitus occurrence,HISTORY OF TINNITUS RESEARCH AT THE VA NCRAR/ HENRY ET AL 7

symptoms, length of symptoms, and clinical
implications. The Tinnitus Screener also cap-tures tinnitus duration (acute/recent-onset <6
months vs. chronic/persistent /C216 months).
29
This instrument provides a method of stan-
dardizing categories of primary tinnitus, and
can improve the quality and consistency of
future tinnitus research by enabling directcomparison between studies and between
clinics.
TINNITUS MAGNITUDE INDEX
As noted earlier, psychoacoustic measures of
tinnitus appear unrelated to the impact oftinnitus as assessed by a subjective outcome
instrument.
22We conducted a study to provide
preliminary evidence of a unique “tinnitusmagnitude” domain describing intensity of tin-
nitus perception that would be independent ofreactions to tinnitus.
37Such a measure could
enable researchers to study this magnitudedomain of tinnitus separately from domains
of psychological distress, cognitive impact,
and quality of life. For this study, potentialtinnitus magnitude items were selected from
three items used for TFI development (percent
of time aware of tinnitus, strength or loudnessof tinnitus, and severity of tinnitus) that had the
least overlap with tinnitus reactions. These
items were analyzed retrospectively to assessdiscriminant validity, internal consistency, test–
retest reliability, and between-group differen-
ces. Results of the analysis suggested thatdevelopment of a Tinnitus Magnitude Index
is feasible for obtaining reliable and valid mea-
sures of tinnitus magnitude that are not con-founded by measures of cognitive, behavioral,
and emotional tinnitus reactions.

Review of Tinnitus Questionnaires
Theodoroff joined the NCRAR in 2007. Her
research is focused on the poorly understoodperceptual consequences of noise exposure—
speciﬁcally tinnitus, hyperacusis, and noise sen-
sitivity. She reviewed factors that would beimportant to consider when selecting a tinnitus
questionnaire for research purposes or for clini-
cal care.
38The review included suggestions for
how to select among tinnitus questionnaires for
intake assessment versus assessment of outco-
mes following an intervention. A checklist wasprovided to systematically evaluate and compare
between instruments.
Ecological Momentary Assessment
When conducting tinnitus clinical trials, assess-ment of outcomes has historically been limited
to the use of questionnaires that retrospectively
assess emotional and functional effects of tin-nitus. Through the use of ecological momentary
assessment (EMA), recall biases are circum-
vented because individuals are asked about theircurrent experiences in real time. Our group was
the ﬁrst to explore the feasibility of using EMA
methods to assess within- and between-dayeffects of tinnitus by conducting a pilot study.
39
Personal digital assistants (PDAs) were pro-grammed to perform the real-time assessmentsfour times each day for 14 days, and were used
by 24 participants. (At the time the study was
conducted, smartphones were not available forthis purpose.) Results of the study revealed high
compliance with the protocol and positive
feedback from participants. It was also shownthat performing the EMA protocol did not
increase participants’ reactions to tinnitus rela-
tive to results of a pre- and post-protocoltinnitus outcome questionnaire. It was conclud-
ed that EMA methodology is a feasible method
to obtain real-time tinnitus outcome data.
Standardizing Audiologic Assessment
In 2019, Quinn received a VA Innovators
Network “Spark” Award for prototype devel-
opment of a VA Tinnitus Care Plan. Theobjective was to promote standardization of
VA audiologic tinnitus care by using a web-
based application, housed on a tablet, to guideprocedures during an audiology appointment.
The application provides tinnitus questionnai-
res (including the TFI, THS, and TinnitusScreener) and educational materials for patients
while in the waiting room, audiologic input
sections for the clinician during the appoint-ment, and a ﬁnal summary screen that recom-
mends an individualized Tinnitus Care Plan.
Information collected from VA audiologistsand Veteran participants provided preliminary
evidence to support the feasibility of a tablet
system in a clinical setting, and insight intoVeteran satisfaction of system deliverables.
Quinn is applying for the next level of VA
Innovators Network funding, the “Seed”Award, to continue development of this versa-
tile application within the clinical setting.
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND SURVEY
STUDIES
Noise Outcomes in Service Members
Epidemiology (NOISE) StudyDue to concerns about noise exposure in the
military and its relationship with hearing loss
and tinnitus, the U.S. Congress directed thenational academies to investigate these issues as
stipulated in the Veterans Beneﬁts Act of 2002
(P.L. 107–330). The Institute of Medicine ofthe National Academies convened a committee,
which was given the charge to review factors
bearing on noise hazards in the military andtheir effects on tinnitus and hearing loss. The
committee published its ﬁndings along with
recommendations for needed research.
40We
assembled a team of audiology, epidemiology,
and health services researchers to address the
following committee recommendation: “ Estab-
lish cohorts of military veterans with various
documented noise exposures, immediately on dis-
charge, and survey them periodically for ototoxicexposures, subsequent nonmilitary noise exposures,
and hearing function, as well as presence and
severity of tinnitus, in order to determine whetherthere is a delay in the effects of military noise
exposure. These cohorts will need to be followed
through the remainder of members’ lifetimes, butthis longitudinal study will reveal elements of the
natural history of noise-induced hearing loss and
tinnitus that otherwise will not be determined ” (p.HISTORY OF TINNITUS RESEARCH AT THE VA NCRAR/ HENRY ET AL 9

10). Following up on this recommendation, the
multisite Noise Outcomes in Service members
Epidemiology (NOISE) study began in 2013 asa joint effort between the Department of De-
fense (DoD) and the VA.
The NOISE study design is to enroll a
cross-sectional sample of Service members and
Veterans and to follow them over time at
regular intervals. This longitudinal panel designenables the following: (1) cross-sectional as-
sessment of baseline associations between expo-
sures and outcomes; (2) capturing exposuresand changes in symptoms that occur between
assessment intervals; and (3) analysis of why
some participants experience changes in symp-toms while others do not.
Data collection is comprehensive, includ-
ing 15 questionnaires and an audiologic assess-ment (pure tone air and bone conduction
thresholds 0.25–16 kHz, speech reception
threshold, word recognition testing) at base-line.
41Questionnaires are completed every year
thereafter, and audiologic testing is repeated
every 5 years. The Tinnitus Screener is admin-istered at baseline and at all follow-ups to
determine if a participant should be placed in
the “tinnitus” (constant or intermittent tinni-tus) or “no tinnitus” (occasional, temporary,
spontaneous/none) category (a participant’s
category can change over time).
34Participants
who are placed in the “tinnitus” category com-
plete tinnitus psychoacoustic testing in addition
to the audiologic testing at 5-year intervals, andcomplete three additional questionnaires every
year that they screen positive for tinnitus.
Participants are, on average, relatively
young. For the ﬁrst 1,022 participants (643 at
the NCRAR and 379 at the Hearing Center of
Excellence [HCE]), the mean ages of Veteransand Service members were 34.4 and 34.5 years,
respectively.
42At their baseline assessment, the
majority of participants had normal hearingthresholds ( /C2020 dB HL) in the conventional
frequency range (0.25–8 kHz). Furthermore,
41% of Service members and 62% of Veteranswere identiﬁed with the Tinnitus Screener as
having intermittent or constant tinnitus—
placing them in the “tinnitus” category.
The extensive amount of data collected
with the NOISE study enables numerous com-
parisons and analyses between the differentmeasures. Tinnitus analyses that have been
completed and published include: documenting
predictive validity for the Tinnitus Screener,
34
reporting audiologic data and temporal charac-
teristics of tinnitus,41providing data revealing
the adverse effects of tinnitus on active-dutyService members,
43showing an association
between blast exposure and decreased sound
tolerance (hyperacusis),44providing deﬁnitions
and assessment tools to promote standardiza-
tion and data that are comparable between
studies,8and reporting notable ﬁndings from
the ﬁrst 690 participants enrolled in the NOISE
study.42
With continued effort for 20 years or more,
the NOISE study will obtain data that will
increasingly help explain the degree to which
exposures in the military affect auditory func-tioning in Service members and Veterans—
speciﬁcally risk factors for tinnitus onset and
the longitudinal trajectory of tinnitus. Theseﬁndings will inform prevention and manage-
ment strategies for Service members and Veter-
ans who are at risk for hearing loss and tinnitus,ultimately leading to improvements in their
functioning and quality of life.
Characteristics of Patients with
TinnitusCarlson is an NCRAR investigator as well as a
core investigator for the Health Services Re-
search & Development (HSR&D) Center ofInnovation (COIN), the Center to Improve
Veteran Involvement in Care (CIVIC) at the
VAPORHCS. She was trained in injury epi-demiology. In addition to her collaboration on
the NOISE study, she has led her own studies
related to traumatic brain injury (TBI), tinni-tus, and auditory health. One of her studies
examined associations between tinnitus sever-
ity and mental health symptoms.
45This study
was a population-based survey of 1,800 VA
healthcare-using Veterans who were diag-
nosed with tinnitus. This stratiﬁed randomsample of Veterans was assessed for tinnitus
severity using the TFI, and for mental health
symptoms using clinical screening instru-ments. Results of the analyses revealed a
strong association between tinnitus severity
and the likelihood of screening positive for10 SEMINARS IN HEARING/VOLUME 45, NUMBER 1 2024 #2023. THE AUTHOR(S).

depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress
disorder. In almost a dose–response fashion,
the observed associations were robust evenafter using multivariable models that con-
trolled for potentially confounding variables.
This work suggests that VA clinical care forVeterans with functionally limiting tinnitus
would be improved by greater collaboration
between audiology and mental health services.
Another study conducted by Carlson and
colleagues investigated Veterans with and with-
out tinnitus who receive VA health care.
46Ten
percent of Veteran users of VA healthcare
between 2011 and 2016 were randomly sampled,
and 3.8% of the resulting sample (617,534eligible Veterans) were found to have been
diagnosed two or more times with tinnitus.
Results of the analysis revealed the following:(1) Tinnitus diagnoses were associated with
Veterans’ age, race, sex, marital status, and status
with respect to having a service-connected dis-ability(s). (2) Hearing loss and TBI were often
diagnosed along with tinnitus. (3) Veterans
diagnosed with tinnitus used healthcare servicesmore frequently than those not diagnosed with
tinnitus. (4) Veterans with tinnitus were more
often diagnosed with mental health disorders,including depression, anxiety, and substance use
disorders, than those not diagnosed with tinni-
tus. These ﬁndings suggest the need for coordi-nated tinnitus services in the VA system of care
that include behavioral healthcare.
Comorbidities of Tinnitus
NCRAR investigator Folmer was previouslythe OHSU Tinnitus Clinic’s Chief of ClinicalServices. While there, he conducted numerous
studies of tinnitus patients that identiﬁed
comorbidities contributing to the negative im-pact of tinnitus on quality of life. For example, a
study of 350 patients indicated that difﬁculty
sleeping was positively correlated with tinnitusseverity.
47A study of 436 patients indicated
that depression was positively correlated with
tinnitus severity.48Reavis, another investigator
at the NCRAR, similarly found that tinnitus
was associated with depression symptoms and
anxiety symptoms among community-dwellingadults.
7Because subsequent investigations
revealed a similar relationship between anxiety
and tinnitus severity, Folmer and colleaguespublished the “vicious circle” of symptoms
diagram in 2001 (Fig. 1).
49In this model,
tinnitus that has been present for a year ormore is likely to persist. For some patients,
tinnitus can exacerbate co-symptoms of anxiety,
depression, or insomnia. Conversely, these co-symptoms can affect the severity of tinnitus.
Effective treatment of anxiety, depression, or
insomnia should decrease the severity of tinni-tus and improve the patient’s quality of life.
Effective management of tinnitus should re-
duce the impact of associated co-symptoms.Additional investigations described: (1) the
characteristics of chronic tinnitus resulting
from head or neck injuries
50; (2) chronic tinni-
tus resulting from cerumen removal procedu-
res51; (3) associations between tinnitus and
obsessive-compulsiveness52; and (4) tinnitus
that resulted from electroconvulsive therapy.53
Further studies of Folmer’s, both at OHSU
and the NCRAR, focused on the epidemiologyof tinnitus and hearing loss

gists.58–62The 2011 study54used National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) data to estimate the prevalenceof hearing loss and tinnitus among 2,174 Veter-
ans and 4,995 non-Veterans. Pure tone thres-
holds did not differ signiﬁcantly betweenVeterans and non-Veterans for most audiomet-
ric frequencies tested (500–8,000 Hz). The
overall prevalence of tinnitus was greater forVeterans (11.7%) than for non-Veterans (5.4%;
p<0.001), with statistically signiﬁcant diffe-
rences in the 50–59 and 60–69 age groups.
Patient Factors
Theodoroff and colleagues conducted a study to
evaluate patient factors that may be associated
with outcomes of tinnitus intervention, includ-ing demographics, audiometric data, tinnitus
characteristics, psychoacoustic tinnitus measu-
res, and physical and emotional health.
63Veter-
ans ( n¼89) who completed outcome measures
at baseline and 12 months, including the Tin-
nitus Handicap Inventory (THI),64were iden-
tiﬁed as either responders or nonresponders to
intervention, that is, showing, respectively, a
minimum 20-point reduction on the THI, ornot achieving a 20-point improvement. In
general, responders (1) were younger; (2) had
better low-frequency hearing; (3) reportedgreater hearing difﬁculties; (4) had shorter-
duration tinnitus; and (5) localized their tinni-
tus as “in the head” rather than “in the ears.”These ﬁndings revealed that relationships be-
tween characteristics of patients and outcomes
of intervention they receive for tinnitus can beidentiﬁed, which would contribute toward dif-
ferentially predicting outcomes for individual
patients and leading to more targeted andeffective therapy.
Provider Surveys
Progressive tinnitus management (PTM) is a
stepped-care, interdisciplinary method ofproviding tinnitus clinical services.
65PTM
was endorsed by national VA audiology
leadership in 2009 and has been shown tobe effective in two randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) described further below.66,67
Clinical implementation of PTM across the
VA was assessed using an anonymous, web-
based survey targeting audiology and behav-
ioral health leaders at 144 major VA hospi-tals.
68,69The study addressed a gap in
knowledge of PTM clinical implementation,
focusing on factors that facilitated or hin-dered its implementation, and whether sites
using PTM had developed adaptations to the
methodology.
We explored PTM program implementa-
tion both quantitatively and qualitatively. The
goal of the quantitative analysis was to estimatelevels of PTM program implementation in VA
audiology and behavioral health clinics.
69Sur-
vey responses were received from 87 audiolo-gists and 66 behavioral health clinicians. Data
analysis revealed that the majority (44 audiolo-
gists and 60 behavioral health clinicians) did notoffer PTM (categorized as “no PTM”) or they
offered “partial PTM” (17 audiologists and one
behavioral health clinician). “Full PTM” wasoffered by 26 audiologists and ﬁve behavioral
health clinicians. In addition to the noted wide
variation in tinnitus clinical services, resultsrevealed the need for behavioral health provi-
ders to be more engaged in tinnitus care, and a
clear interest by both audiologists and behav-ioral health providers in receiving tinnitus-
related training.
69Future research should ad-
dress these barriers to PTM implementation inVA clinics.
The qualitative analysis focused on identi-
fying facilitators and barriers to the implemen-tation of PTM across VA sites.
68To obtain
these qualitative data, 21 audiology and behav-
ioral health clinicians and service chiefs across aVA regional service network were interviewed.
Prioritizing the implementation of PTM was
found to be rare overall, with providers citinglack of capacity as well as other challenges. At
sites where PTM was prioritized and delivered,
providers noted its unique value, their personalexperience of tinnitus, a good ﬁt of PTM with
their skills, and leadership support. PTM was
frequently adapted by providing intervention toindividuals rather than in group settings and
reducing the number of intervention sessions.
Important next steps are to identify and develop12 SEMINARS IN HEARING/VOLUME 45, NUMBER 1 2024 #2023. THE AUTHOR(S).

clinician champions who can facilitate PTM
implementation, and research the impact of
adaptations to PTM on patient outcomes.
Tinnitus and Suicide
This project was conducted by NCRAR inves-
tigator Martz to explore the potential association
between chronic tinnitus and suicide in Veteransand whether comorbid depression and anxiety
strengthen this putative association.
70Of
769,934 Veterans receiving VA healthcare be-tween January 2002 and December 2011, 15%
had a tinnitus diagnosis. In this retrospective
study of VA data, suicide rates were observed tobe lower for Veterans diagnosed with tinnitus
than for those who had not been diagnosed with
tinnitus. Furthermore, comorbid mental healthconditions were not found to signiﬁcantly in-
crease the risk of suicide for Veterans diagnosed
with tinnitus. Although the study did not con-ﬁrm anecdotal reports from clinicians in the ﬁeld
that tinnitus is related to suicide in Veterans, it
emphasized the need for healthcare providers tobe aware that tinnitus and mental health condi-
tions are often comorbid, and to be prepared to
address the psychological needs of Veterans whoexperience bothersome tinnitus.
CLINICAL TRIALS
Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
Stimulation
Folmer and colleagues conducted the ﬁrst trial
in the United States using repetitive transcra-nial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat
bothersome tinnitus.
71In this pilot study, a
reduction in the perceived loudness of tinnituswas reported by the majority of participants
after receiving a brief session of rTMS. A larger,
placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical tri-al of rTMS for tinnitus was then conducted by
Folmer et al
72(Fig. 2). Results of the trial
revealed 56% of the active-rTMS participantswere considered to be responders to the treat-
ment based on reductions in scores on the TFI,
while only 19% of the placebo-rTMS partici-pants were considered to be responders using
the same criteria. Responders to treatment had
sustained improvement at the 26-week follow-up assessment. This treatment method will
require additional trials with larger numbers
of participants before it can be implementedclinically. A follow-up imaging study revealed
that, due to individual asymmetries and other
systematic differences in anatomy, optimumTMS coil placement over the primary auditory
cortex might necessitate using a method guided
by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
73
Pharmaceutical TreatmentsEnbrel (etanercept) is a Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA)-approved drug for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasisthat is currently being studied in a clinical trial
by Folmer and colleagues as an off-label treat-
ment of tinnitus. In this DoD-funded trial (PI:Jinsheng Zhang for the multisite project), study
participants will receive weekly injections for 12
consecutive weeks—half receive the Enbrel and
Figure 2 Dr. Robert Folmer administers repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to a study
participant.HISTORY OF TINNITUS RESEARCH AT THE VA NCRAR/ HENRY ET AL 13

the other half (placebo group) receive saline. It
is hypothesized that Enbrel’s anti-inﬂammato-
ry action will result in a signiﬁcant reduction oftinnitus perception and/or severity for the
treatment group but not for the placebo group.
Folmer and colleagues are also collaborating
with a research group at Columbia University to
conduct a clinical trial of the drug ketamine for
the treatment of tinnitus. Ketamine is anNMDA receptor antagonist in the brain and is
used clinically as a surgical anesthetic. It is also
used to treat severe depression in patients who donot respond to other medications or behavioral
therapy. MRI is performed on all participants at
baseline and posttreatment. It is hypothesizedthat the ketamine will reduce tinnitus perception
and/or reduce its negative functional and emo-
tional effects for participants in the treatmentgroup.
Tinnitus Retraining Therapy and
Tinnitus Masking
Tinnitus masking is an intervention that usessound for the purpose of providing immediate
relief from tinnitus.
74Patients treated with
tinnitus masking are ﬁt with ear-level devi-ces—“maskers” or hearing aids with built-in
maskers (or streaming capability). Sound from
the device is adjusted to the level that induces asense of relief. With tinnitus retraining therapy
(TRT), the goal is to achieve habituation from
both the awareness of, and reactions to, thetinnitus.
75,76Intervention with TRT involves a
combination of structured counseling and
sound therapy, with the counseling being themost important component. For sound therapy,
patients are advised to “enrich their sound
environment 24/7.” Those with more severetinnitus often use ear-level sound generators
with instructions to use the devices in a very
speciﬁc fashion—unlike masking, which allowspatients ﬂexibility in adjusting the output level.
TRT VERSUS MASKING
The comparative efﬁcacy of masking versus
TRT for Veterans with bothersome tinnitus
was evaluated in a controlled clinical study.77,78
Participants ( n¼123) were allocated by alter-
nating assignment to masking or TRT and
followed up for 18 months. Both groups sho-wed signiﬁcant improvement overall, with mas-
king showing improvement that leveled off at
6 months, while TRT effects continued toimprove (mostly with participants who reported
a “very big” tinnitus problem at baseline). This
trial demonstrated that sound can be used indifferent ways to achieve the same therapeutic
objectives for tinnitus management. It also
demonstrated the importance of counseling.It cannot be known how much of the observed
beneﬁt for each method was due to the sound
therapy versus the counseling that wasemployed.
GROUP TRT COUNSELING
The essential component of intervention with
TRT is its structured counseling. We hypothe-
sized that administering TRT counseling togroups of Veterans with bothersome tinnitus
would be an effective and efﬁcient intervention.
An RCT with three groups (TRT counseling:[n¼94]; traditional tinnitus support group
[n¼84]; and wait-list control [ n¼91]) was
conducted to test the hypothesis.
79TRT and
support-group participants attended four week-
ly sessions. Outcome questionnaires, including
the tinnitus severity index (TSI)80were admin-
istered at baseline and at 1, 6, and 12 months.
TSI results revealed the TRT counseling group
showed signiﬁcantly more beneﬁt than theother two groups, presumably because the
TRT group followed the recommendation to
“enrich their sound environment 24/7” to facil-itate habituation to tinnitus. This was a
counseling-only study, and it was evident that
outcomes would have been improved if parti-cipants had received a hearing evaluation, and
hearing aids as necessary, prior to receiving the
counseling. Hence, lessons learned from thisstudy include the importance of audiologic care
as the ﬁrst stage of tinnitus management, and
more broadly to use a stepped-care approach toprovide only the services required for each
individual.
TRT VERSUS MASKING VERSUS TINNITUS
EDUCATION
This multisite (four VA medical centers) RCT
was conducted to assess the effectiveness of
masking and TRT when performed by VA
audiologists.81At each site, participants were14 SEMINARS IN HEARING/VOLUME 45, NUMBER 1 2024 #2023. THE AUTHOR(S).

randomized into one of four groups, TRT,
masking, or one of two control groups: one
that received tinnitus educational counseling onusing sound to reduce the impact of tinnitus
(and hearing aids if needed for a hearing
problem) (referred to as “TED”) and a wait-list control group. A total of 148 Veterans were
enrolled across the four sites. Tinnitus severity
was measured using the THI.
82All three of the
active interventions (masking, TRT, and TED)
provided effectiveness that was relatively similar
through 6 months and beyond.
Implications for tinnitus clinical manage-
ment derived from this study include the fol-
lowing: (1) Educational counseling on usingsound for tinnitus can be as effective as sound-
based therapy for which ear-level devices are
issued. (2) It is important to provide compre-hensive training to clinicians. (3) Individuals
who do not beneﬁt from initial intervention
should receive more intensive services. Further,the educational counseling protocol created for
the TED group led to the development of
numerous concepts, techniques, and tools forusing therapeutic sound that are described as
part of the PTM educational counseling.
83–85
Development of PTM
Conducting these early trials ﬁrst led to ourdevelopment of Audiologic Tinnitus Manage-
ment (ATM), which was a structured protocol of
both assessment and intervention to be conductedby audiologists.
86,87T h ei d e ao fas t e p p e d - c a r e
(progressive) method of tinnitus management
was ﬁrst introduced by our group in 2005.88
That led to ATM being modiﬁed to become
Progressive Audiologic Tinnitus Management
(PATM).85,89–91We soon realized that the in-
tervention level (Level 3) of PATM should
include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) be-
cause CBT had the strongest scientiﬁc evidencefor tinnitus intervention.
92Adding CBT to the
protocol made the method multidisciplinary (au-
diology and behavioral health). The method wasrenamed PTM so that the title would not suggest
the method was conducted only by audiologists.
65
PTM was endorsed for VA-wide use by the
VA Audiology and Speech Pathology (ASP)
Program Ofﬁce in 2009. Numerous materialswere developed to support PTM in the clinic,
including books, videos, brochures, and online
training.65,83,93
PTM Multisite RCTWe completed an RCT with 300 Veterans who
were randomized into either PTM or wait-list
control across two VA sites (a “clinically em-bedded” study).
67Participants in the PTM
group attended Level 3 Skills Education, which
involved two sessions of sound therapy self-careeducation and three sessions of CBT (Fig. 3).
Analyses of this ﬁrst RCT for PTM revealed
signiﬁcant improvement for the PTM group forall outcome measures, including the TFI. The
improvement was signiﬁcantly better for the
PTM group versus the wait-list control group,though observed effect sizes were small ( d¼
0.36 for the TFI).
94
Tele-PTM
We developed and pilot tested a protocol forproviding tinnitus services to Veterans who had
experienced a TBI.
95PTM counseling was
adapted to create an individualized, telephone-based intervention, and administered to Veter-
ans with and without symptoms of TBI located
throughout the United States. This telephoneversion of PTM is now referred to as Tele-PTM,
which has expanded to include other telehealth
modalities. All groups in this pilot study showedsimilar improvement in outcomes, with moder-
ate to large effect sizes. This study demonstrated
feasibility and efﬁcacy of providing tinnituscounseling by telephone to Veterans both with
and without a history of TBI.
Tele-PTM, as developed for patients with
TBI in the pilot study (earlier), was further
reﬁned, and an RCT was completed with 205
participants to evaluate its efﬁcacy relative towait-list control.
66Recruitment took place na-
tionwide at primarily VA and military hospitals.
Analyses showed a signiﬁcant change frombaseline to 6 months for the Tele-PTM group
compared with waitlisted controls, with large
effect sizes
94observed for the primary outcomes
(d¼1.06 at 3 months, and 1.20 at 6 months for
the TFI).HISTORY OF TINNITUS RESEARCH AT THE VA NCRAR/ HENRY ET AL 15

Hearing Aids for Tinnitus Management
Hearing aids have often been reported to
provide secondary beneﬁt for tinnitus manage-
ment.96–101The ﬁrst hearing aids to incorporate
built-in sound generators intended to provide
relief from tinnitus were called “combination
instruments,” though most hearing aids nowemploy Bluetooth streaming of sound ﬁles
from mobile phones. Studies had failed to
demonstrate combination instruments weremore effective than hearing aids alone for tinni-
tus management.
102We conducted a small RCT
to address this question.103Thirty qualiﬁed
hearing aid candidates who also had bothersome
tinnitus were enrolled and randomized to receive
either hearing aids or combination instruments(all devices supplied by Starkey Hearing Tech-
nologies). Participants, who were all new users of
hearing aids, wore the devices for 3 months and
completed the TFI before and after the inter-vention period. Both groups showed signiﬁcant
improvement, as indicated by reductions in their
TFI scores. Neither outperformed the other,suggesting that both hearing aids and combina-
tion instruments are effective in managing reac-
tions to tinnitus.
We conducted another RCT to evaluate
the relative efﬁcacy of ear-level devices provided
by Phonak, LLC: conventional hearing aids,combination instruments, and extended-wear,
deep ﬁt hearing aids (Lyric), to provide relief
from tinnitus.
104Fifty-ﬁve hearing aid
Figure 3 Five stepped-care levels of PTM. Level 1: Referral is for properly routing patients who complain of
tinnitus. Level 2: Audiologic evaluation is the basic assessment level conducted by audiologists for any patient
with chronic/persistent tinnitus. Level 3: Skills education is the ﬁrst intervention level, and normally addressesthe needs of patients requiring intervention for their bothersome tinnitus. If Level 3 is insufﬁcient, then Level
4: Interdisciplinary evaluation is recommended, involving in-depth assessment by both an audiologist and a
psychologist. Level 5: Individualized support provides options for intervention, including extending the Level 3intervention, focusing just on sound therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy, or providing a completely
different form of intervention.16 SEMINARS IN HEARING/VOLUME 45, NUMBER 1 2024 #2023. THE AUTHOR(S).

candidates with bothersome tinnitus who were
not already using hearing aids were randomized
to use one of these three types of devices(bilaterally) for 4 months. Nearly all partici-
pants had a reduction in tinnitus symptoms
during the study. Signiﬁcant improvement onthe TFI was observed for all three groups, but
there were no signiﬁcant differences between
groups.
Both the Starkey and Phonak studies con-
cluded that although all of the devices provided
improvement in the functional effects of tinni-tus, there was no evidence that any of these
devices offered greater relief from tinnitus than
any other one tested.
We were aware of numerous reports from
audiologists successfully providing hearing
aids with low-gain ampliﬁcation on patientswith bothersome tinnitus who were not oth-
erwise hearing aid candidates. This nontra-
ditional ﬁtting practice had not been formallyevaluated, and Zaugg (principal investigator)
and Quinn (co-investig ator) were funded to
conduct a pilot study designed to lay thegroundwork for a future full RCT to study
this approach. For the pilot study, which is
currently underway, 20 Veterans with normalhearing thresholds and bothersome tinnitus
will be ﬁt with hearing aids programmed to
provide a low level of ampliﬁcation. Out-comes will be assessed with the TFI, Hearing
Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA),
64
and the Quick Speech in Noise (QuickSIN)
test105following 3 months of hearing aid use.
Participants will also be interviewed at the
last visit to determine their self-perceived
beneﬁt and potential barriers from using
the hearing aids.
This pilot study will also involve inter-
views of VA clinical audiologists who will be
identiﬁed via an email survey as providing
low-gain ampliﬁcation for bothersome tinni-
tus to their patients with normal hearing.
The interviews will determine, for this non-
traditional practice, th ese audiologists’ ratio-
nale, ﬁtting procedures, and criteria for
identifying suitable candidates. Outcomes
from this pilot study will determine if a fullRCT is warranted to assess the efﬁcacy of this
practice.Sound Therapy
COMMERCIAL DEVICE FOR USE DURING SLEEP
An RCT was conducted to determine if an
acoustic stimulus that was customized and
delivered from the Otoharmonics in-ear LevoSystem during sleep is beneﬁcial for reducing
the impact of tinnitus.
106Sixty participants
(N¼60) with bothersome tinnitus were en-
rolled and randomized to one of three groups:
(1) Levo programmed according to manufac-
turer instructions to produce a tinnitus-matched sound; (2) Levo programmed to serve
as a control stimulus by being programmed to
play a broadband noise that was not chosen bythe participant; and (3) a bedside sound gener-
ator. Outcomes were assessed with the TFI, a
NRS of tinnitus loudness, and a tinnitus loud-ness match. All groups showed improvements
after 3 months and all appeared to offer promise
for reducing the impact of bothersome tinnitus.The bedside sound generator group showed a
mean reduction on the TFI of /C2415 points. Both
Levo groups showed approximately 5 pointsgreater reduction on the TFI compared with the
bedside sound generator group.
ACOUSTIC COORDINATED RESET
NEUROMODULATION
Acoustic coordinated reset (CR) neuromodu-
lation is a sound-based therapy intended to
disrupt pathological neural synchrony thought
to underlie primary tonal tinnitus.107The Des-
yncra device was created to use the acoustic CR
neuromodulation computational algorithm to
deliver sequences of tones centered around thetinnitus pitch-matched frequency. It was theo-
rized that any increased synchronized neuronal
activity associated with the tinnitus wouldbecome desynchronized, thus reducing tinnitus
symptoms.
108An RCT was conducted to test
this premise.109Participants ( N¼61) were
stratiﬁed based on whether or not they were
hearing aid users at baseline, and randomized to
receive either Desyncra or CBT. Participantsattended 7 to 12 intervention visits, based on
their randomization. Outcomes were assessed
with the Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ).
110
Mean TQ scores decreased from 5 to 15 points
across treatment arms and strata. In theHISTORY OF TINNITUS RESEARCH AT THE VA NCRAR/ HENRY ET AL 17

no-hearing-aid stratum, model-based results
revealed that the difference between using Des-
yncra and CBT showed, on average, greaterimprovement by 2 to 3 TQ points using the
Desyncra device. These ﬁndings suggested
Desyncra is at least as effective as CBT inreducing tinnitus distress.
NOTCHED NOISE THERAPY
In 2020, Quinn was awarded a VA RR&D
Career Development Award-2 (CDA-2) to
continue her dissertation ﬁndings focused onnotched noise therapy (NNT) for suppression
of tinnitus. For NNT, broadband noise is
presented with the individual’s tinnitus fre-quency region notched out of the stimulus. It
is theorized that by eliminating (notching)
acoustic energy in the tinnitus frequency region,lateral inhibition is distributed into the associ-
ated tonotopic region in the auditory pathways,
suppressing neural activity thought to cause thetinnitus percept.
111The study will involve an
RCT to systematically evaluate the utility of
functional, psychoacoustic, and electrophysio-logic measures to reveal the whole-health im-
pact of NNT in Veterans with bothersome
tinnitus. At the completion of this CDA-2program, the expected outcome is to demon-
strate if NNT is a viable therapy for tinnitus and
the contributions that it may have on tinnitusperception.
PILOT STUDIES
Commercial Tinnitus Relief Sounds
Sound therapy is often limited to the use of
broadband noise. For this pilot study, it was
hypothesized that the effectiveness of soundtherapy can be improved by expanding the
auditory-stimulus options available to
patients.
112Commercially available sounds
that were designed to promote tinnitus relief
were evaluated to that end by 21 participants
who compared the customized sounds to whitenoise. In a sound booth, participants listened to
white noise and to custom sounds that were
available commercially and intended to providetinnitus relief. The different sounds included
three from the Dynamic Tinnitus Mitigation
(DTM-6a) system (Petroff Audio Technolo-gies, Inc.) and seven from the Moses/Lang
CD7 system (OHRC at OHSU). Across parti-
cipants, all of the sounds resulted in a signiﬁcantreduction in tinnitus annoyance. Also, two of
the sounds from the DTM-6a system were
judged signiﬁcantly more effective than theother sounds. These ﬁndings suggested that
specially designed “dynamic” tinnitus-relief
sounds may be more effective than the use ofbroadband or ﬁltered bands of noise.
Notched versus Matched Noise
A small RCT was conducted to evaluate two
types of sound therapy theorized to suppress thetinnitus percept.
113The sound therapies in-
cluded broadband noise (1–12 kHz) that was
notched over a 1-octave range centered aroundthe tinnitus pitch match frequency, and a 1-
octave-wide band of noise centered around the
pitch match frequency. A control group listenedto a band of low-frequency noise (250–700 Hz).
Thirty participants (10 per group) with bother-
some tinnitus listened to the acoustic stimulusfor 2 weeks (6 hours per day). This study
showed improvement on the TFI for all of
the groups, providing further support thatmany types of sound therapy are beneﬁcial for
relieving effects of tinnitus. Suppressing the
tinnitus percept was not conclusively demon-strated, and these results can serve as prelimi-
nary evidence for a larger study to more fully
investigate that theory.
Smartphone App for Tinnitus
Management
A study was conducted to develop and evaluate
a smartphone app that would teach coping skillsthat are used with PTM Level 3 Skills Educa-
tion.
114A prototype app was developed and
usability testing was conducted. The prototypeapp was evaluated by two focus groups contai-
ning members who represented potential users
of the app. Lastly, a ﬁeld study was conductedwith three successive groups of participants to
evaluate the app. Participants in the focus
groups and ﬁeld studies responded favorablyto the app content. Some features, however,
were deemed too complex for routine use. The
use of smartphone apps has the potential to18 SEMINARS IN HEARING/VOLUME 45, NUMBER 1 2024 #2023. THE AUTHOR(S).

increase access to coping skills education for
people with bothersome tinnitus.
Pilot Study of Group Interventions
This pilot study was a small RCT led by Martzto compare outcomes from three brief group
interventions and a wait-list control group.
115
The interventions were based on CBT, accep-
tance and commitment therapy (ACT), and
coping effectiveness training (CET). Although
ACT and CBT focus primarily on managingunwanted thoughts and emotions, CET tea-
ches skills not explicitly taught by ACT or
CBT, including a range of coping strategiesto more effectively manage stressors that both
can and cannot be changed. Coping factors
were assessed with the brief COPE scale
116
pre- and post-intervention, and 4 weeks fol-
lowing intervention. Forty participants were
randomized into one of the four groups. Sig-niﬁcant group differences were observed on the
social support coping factor, with the CET
group scores being signiﬁcantly higher thanthe wait-list group. Future research should
involve a larger sample and outcome instru-
ments that measure the impact of tinnitus.Different delivery formats should also be eval-
uated for the interventions.
Residual Inhibition
The NCRAR provided seed funding toQuinn to investigate the effects of an acoustic
stimulus customized to maximize RI (the
temporary suppression or elimination of tin-nitus that is usually observed following ap-
propriate auditory stimulation).
117The study
adapted a new method to induce RI thatinvolves presenting repeated 3-second bursts
of sound separated by short intervals of
silence (1 second) to determine the minimumresidual inhibition level (MRIL).
118This
technique was adapted by assessing and de-
livering noise at the MRIL through hearingaids. Fifteen participants with bothersome
tinnitus completed the protocol. Results
were promising and the plan is to use thesepilot data to support a fully powered RCT of
the technique.NARRATIVE PUBLICATIONS
Coping with Tinnitus
A narrative article was published addressing
coping with tinnitus.
119Perspectives about
deﬁning and categorizing coping were discus-sed. A summary of the empirical research on
coping with tinnitus was provided, with a focus
on how coping with tinnitus has been measuredand trends that had been discovered in relevant
research on coping with tinnitus. The problems
relating to this type of research were highlight-ed. Suggestions were offered on how to improve
research on coping with tinnitus.
Tinnitus Mechanisms
NCRAR investigators have published articlesaddressing theorized underlying neural mecha-
nisms of tinnitus. Henry and Theodoroff collab-
orated with others to write an article reviewingneurophysiological changes in the auditory sys-
tem that were thought to be responsible for
tinnitus.
120Henry has also addressed tinnitus
mechanisms elsewhere,121,122while Theodoroff
has written about the role of the brainstem in
generating and modulating tinnitus.123Folmer
and colleagues conducted a functional MRI
(fMRI) study of tinnitus patients to elucidate
the neural mechanisms associated with tinnitusperception and severity.
124Results indicated that
neural activity in auditory cortex was associated
with tinnitus perception, while activity in theputamen and posterior cingulate regions was
associated with differences in tinnitus severity.
Sound Therapy
Henry and Quinn reviewed the NCRAR’sRCTs that showed beneﬁt for different
methods of sound therapy, including hearing
aids (both with and without a sound generator),masking, TRT, PTM, and specialized sound
therapy devices.
2In addition to these trials,
many studies over the past 50 years support theeffectiveness of sound therapy in general.
125For
example, Folmer and Carroll61conducted a
retrospective study of 150 tinnitus patients:50 patients purchased and used hearing aids;
50 patients purchased and used in-the-earHISTORY OF TINNITUS RESEARCH AT THE VA NCRAR/ HENRY ET AL 19

sound generators for an average of 18 months
after their initial tinnitus clinic appointment; 50
patients did not use ear-level devices. At follow-up, all three groups of patients exhibited signif-
icant reductions in TSI
126scores and self-rated
tinnitus loudness. Patients who used ear-leveldevices reported greater improvement than
patients who did not use hearing aids or sound
generators.
Although systematic reviews have not
recommended sound therapy, it is known that
sound has been used to obtain relief fromtinnitus for hundreds of years.
60,127These
articles emphasize that considerable evidence,
from both clinical and research studies, supportsthe effectiveness of sound therapy for tinnitus
management.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
In 2014, the American Academy of Otolaryn-gology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation
(AAO-HNSF) published “the ﬁrst evidence-
based clinical guideline developed for theevaluation and treatment of chronic tinnitus”
(p. S3).
29Following a systematic review, the
only intervention the AAO-HNSF recommen-ded for bothersome tinnitus was CBT. Simi-
larly, between 2007 and 2016, four separate
tinnitus clinical guidelines were published inEurope, which, together with the AAO-HNSF
guideline, were summarized by Fuller et al.
128
All of these guidelines agreed that CBT had the
strongest evidence of beneﬁt and was therefore
the only method recommended for tinnitus
intervention.
The NCRAR has collaborated on numer-
ous publications focusing on CBT for tinnitus
management.109,129,130CBT is normally deliv-
ered by behavioral health providers (counselors,
social workers, psychologists). Unfortunately,
relatively few behavioral health providers offerCBT speciﬁcally for tinnitus, and it can be
difﬁcult if not impossible to ﬁnd one in any
given geographical area. Audiologists typicallyprovide tinnitus services, and recent studies
have suggested that audiologists can provide
CBT, or at least support internet-basedCBT.
131–134This has been a controversial
topic, and we recently published an article
addressing this controversy.135DISCUSSION
Since 2007, tinnitus has been the most com-
monly awarded service-connected disability forVeterans.
46The tinnitus services that Veterans
receive in VA clinics are mostly delivered by
audiologists, behavioral/mental health provi-ders (usually psychologists), and otolaryngolo-
gists. Results of a survey targeting audiology
and behavioral health leaders at the majority ofVA medical centers suggested “wide variation
in services provided, a need for greater engage-
ment of mental health providers in tinnituscare, and an interest among both audiologists
and mental health providers in receiving tinni-
tus-related training” (p. 2).
69Considering the
existing scientiﬁc literature covering tinnitus
research, it is reasonable to conjecture that these
same conclusions would apply in non-VAsettings.
NCRAR investigators have a long history
of conducting research projects focusing onunderstanding the distribution and determi-
nants of tinnitus as well as the clinical manage-
ment of tinnitus. This line of research has itsorigin in the world-renowned OHSU Tinnitus
Clinic that was founded and directed by Jack
Vernon. The tinnitus research at the NCRARis speciﬁcally targeted to improving tinnitus
care for Veterans, but anything accomplished
has wider application to individuals everywherewho must cope with chronic intrusive tinnitus.
Since 1995, our group has had continuous
funding of projects that investigated variousaspects of tinnitus epidemiology and clinical
management. The NCRAR is the VA’s only
research ﬁeld center that is dedicated to sup-porting clinical research pertaining to hearing
loss, tinnitus, and balance problems.
Overall, NCRAR investigators have been
funded to conduct more than 40 tinnitus pro-
jects, including 20 controlled trials that have
focused on intervention and rehabilitation forbothersome tinnitus. These trials have identi-
ﬁed procedures that are the most efﬁcacious,
and efﬁcient, for clinical application. Many ofthese efforts led to the development of PTM, an
interdisciplinary, stepped-care program that
combines elements of sound therapy and CBT.

offering training seminars, NCRAR investiga-
tors are fulﬁlling the mission of the NCRAR,20 SEMINARS IN HEARING/VOLUME 45, NUMBER 1 2024 #2023. THE AUTHOR(S).

which is “to improve the quality of life of
Veterans and others with hearing and balance
problems through clinical research, technologydevelopment, and education that leads to better
patient care.” As mentioned, NCRAR investi-
gators focus mostly on clinical methodologiesand only have ancillary involvement in basic
science, wet laboratory, and mechanisms
studies.
Perspectives on Tinnitus Intervention
Trials
As reviewed earlier, clinical trials at the
NCRAR that evaluated methods of tinnitusintervention showed similar positive outcomes.
Every intervention studied showed improve-
ment on most outcome measures. These resultsare typical of tinnitus intervention studies that
almost universally produce positive results.
Some comment is warranted to properly inter-pret this body of literature.
The “best scientiﬁc evidence” for interven-
tions addressing any health disorder comesfrom systematic reviews, which critically ana-
lyze pertinent clinical trials that meet certain
criteria to be included in the review.
136,137Each
trial is assessed for risk of bias, which refers to
“risk of error in the study data, analysis, or
conclusions” compared with a “perfectly con-trolled trial.”
138
The Cochrane Collaboration produces sys-
tematic reviews with what many consider to bethe highest scientiﬁc integrity.
139The Coch-
rane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions ( https://training.cochrane.org/
handbook ) describes the assessment of risk of
bias criteria for the various forms of bias. One of
those risk of bias criteria that is pertinent totinnitus clinical trials is blinding. Blinding is
done to ensure that both study clinicians and
participants (double blinding) remain unawareof the intervention being implemented to avoid
creating expectations of potential outcomes,
leading to biased results. With drug trials,blinding and placebo control (inert treatment)
are straightforward as long as side effects do not
cue participants that an active drug is beingtaken. (An “active placebo” can be used that
mimics the side effects of the active drug.
Inducing side effects, however, raises ethicalconcerns.) TMS for tinnitus also enables blind-
ing and placebo control by using a sham stimu-
lation protocol for a control group.
72,140,141
Most controlled trials that have been con-
ducted for tinnitus involve some form of
counseling and/or sound therapy. In thesecases, it is usually impossible either to blind
researchers and participants to study group
assignment or to conceive of a true placebocontrol intervention.
138Counseling, including
CBT, cannot be administered in a blinded
fashion, as both clinician and participant areaware that counseling is being administered.
Participants could, however, be blinded (single
blinding) if comparing different methods ofcounseling and participants do not know the
difference. Additionally, researchers adminis-
tering outcome assessments may be keptblinded to group assignments (if stafﬁng
allows). A true placebo control would require
making the placebo similar in all respects to thecounseling method being studied, which is not
feasible.
With respect to psychotherapy in general
(of which CBT is one form), there are hundreds
of methods that each have their own theory and
working hypothesis.
142Numerous reviews of
the different methods have concluded they all
work fairly well with little differences between
them. It was even observed that random assign-ment did not make any difference in effective-
ness.
143Furthermore, one study showed that
inexperienced therapists obtained the sameresults as professional therapists.
144Tinnitus
is still an emergent ﬁeld and not enough studies
have been done to reach these same kinds ofconclusions.
With sound therapy, double blinding can
be accomplished if the experimental soundtherapy is compared with a sham treatment
(using an identical device that delivers a sound
that is completely different from the experi-mental sound, to have no chance of creating a
similar therapeutic effect). Or, as for counsel-
ing, different methods of sound therapy can becompared in a double-blinded protocol. The
only way to create a placebo control for sound
therapy is to devise a procedure whereby theparticipant thinks that sound therapy is being
delivered but it really is not. Possibly the only
study that has attempted such an approachHISTORY OF TINNITUS RESEARCH AT THE VA NCRAR/ HENRY ET AL 21

involved ﬁtting the placebo-control participants
with ear-level devices that initially produced
sound when ﬁrst turned on, but then the soundgradually faded to silence within the ﬁrst 40
minutes.
145
Because of the inability to create a true
placebo control group (for either sound therapy
or counseling), tinnitus clinical trials can at best
be double blinded to compare the effectivenessof different forms of therapy rather than a
placebo, which is an inactive treatment meant
to have no effect. Any variation of soundtherapy or counseling, however, has the poten-
tial to produce beneﬁcial effects, and no single
method has been proven to be more effectivethan any other.
2,138Any form of sound therapy
or counseling used as a control could produce
effects that are as effective as the investigationaltherapy. These concerns should be considered
when interpreting the results of clinical trials
and how reviewing the scientiﬁc evidence fac-tors into the decision-making process about
clinical care for patients with tinnitus.
Future Directions
Future directions for tinnitus research at theNCRAR will continue to focus on validating
and improving existing methodologies, devel-
oping new methodologies for clinical tinnitusmanagement, and documenting the natural
history and progression of tinnitus. Some areas
of particular interest include (1) sound therapystudies, such as notched noise, matched noise,
and RI that have potential for suppressing the
tinnitus percept beyond the stimulation period;(2) more efﬁcient methods for clinical assess-
ment of tinnitus; (3) developing special treat-
ments for tinnitus that can be somaticallymodulated, i.e., “somatosensory” tinnitus; (4)
further research on rTMS as a treatment meth-
od; and (5) risk factors leading to tinnituspercept onset, tinnitus changes over time, and
the role of tinnitus in multimorbidity. Accessi-
bility and efﬁcacy of these methods for variouspopulation subgroups will also be a focus (e.g.,
gender, race, and ethnicity subgroups that are
minorities in the Veteran population; peoplewith other impairments such as vision and
mobility limitations), as these groups may
have been underrepresented and underexami-ned in study samples and analyses in the past.
Future research on PTM has moved into the
realm of implementation science. There is stillmuch to be learned about adaptations made to
PTM in the ﬁeld, and barriers to more wide-
spread implementation of PTM within the VA.Analysis of clinical data will be essential to
address these questions.
CONCLUSION
Although other researchers are focusing onﬁnding a cure for tinnitus (permanent elimina-
tion or reduction of the tinnitus sensation), the
NCRAR’s focus has been on developing andtesting different methods of tinnitus clinical
management with the overall purpose of vali-
dating clinical methodologies for routine appli-cation. Much more has been accomplished than
has been described here, including the develop-
ment of numerous materials for both cliniciansand patients to be used as part of clinical care.
An online training course, consisting of six
separate training modules, has been developedand efforts are underway to update all of our
materials and to develop new ones. We are part
of the DoD/VA Tinnitus Working Group,which develops clinical tools for tinnitus man-
agement at both the DoD and VA. This
summary and review should leave no doubtthat the VA and DoD have substantially sup-
ported tinnitus research for many years, and
continue to do so. These efforts have beneﬁttedVeterans, Service members, and civilians who
suffer from chronic tinnitus, as well as clinicians
who strive to help them.
