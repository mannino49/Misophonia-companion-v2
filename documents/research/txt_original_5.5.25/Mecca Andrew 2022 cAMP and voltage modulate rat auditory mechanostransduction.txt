Hair cells of the auditory and vestibular systems transform mechanical input into elec-
trical potentials through the mechanoelectrical transduction process (MET). De ﬂection
of the mechanosensory hair bundle increases tension in the gating springs that open
MET channels. Regulation of MET channel sensitivity contributes to the auditory sys-tem ’s precision, wide dynamic range and, potentially, protection from overexcitation.
Modulating the stiffness of the gating spring modulates the sensitivity of the MET pro-
cess. Here, we investigated the role of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in rat
outer hair cell MET and found that cAMP up-regulation lowers the sensitivity of thechannel in a manner consistent with decreasing gating spring stiffness. Direct measure-
ments of the mechanical properties of the hair bundle con ﬁrmed a decrease in gating
spring stiffness with cAMP up-regulation. In parallel, we found that prolonged depolar-ization mirrored the effects of cAMP. Finally, a limited number of experiments impli-
cate that cAMP activates the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP to mediate
the changes in MET sensitivity. These results reveal that cAMP signaling modulatesgating spring stiffness to affect auditory sensitivity.

Hair cells of the auditory and vestibular systems convert mechanical input from sound
and head movement into an electrical current through a process termed mechanoelectrical
transduction (MET). At the apical surface of each hair cell is a specialized mechanosensi-
tive organelle called the hair bundle, composed of a collection of actin- ﬁlled stereocilia
arranged in graded height. The tips of the shorter rows house MET channels (1), nonspe-
ciﬁc cation channels hypothesized to be comprised of TMC1/2, TMIE, and a number of
other accessory proteins (2 –4). MET channels are gated by a tension force imparted by a
gating spring, which is part of or connected with the ﬁlamentous tip links that span adja-
cent rows of stereocilia (5 –9). Positive stimuli directed along the sensitive axis of the hair
bundle (10) result in displacement toward the tallest row and increase tension in the gat-
ing spring, increasing the open probability of the MET channel.
Mechanisms that regulate the sensitivity of the MET channel are hypothesized to con-
tribute to the wide dynamic range and frequency selectivity of the auditory system, with
MET adaptation being the most widely studied (11 –14). Based on the gating spring the-
ory, changes in gating spring stiffness alter the setpoint and the sensitivity of the MET
channel (5, 6). The second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) has been
proposed to modulate the sensitivity of the MET channel in turtle and bullfrog hair cells.
In turtle auditory hair cells, cAMP shifts the operating point of the MET channel after aperiod of minutes, extending the dynamic range of the channel (15). In bullfrog hair
cells, pharmacological up-regulation of cAMP reduced the frequency of spontaneous hair
bundle oscillations (16). Furthermore, in humans, a loss of function mutation in adenylyl
cyclase 1 ( ADCY1, an enzyme that catalyzes cAMP production) is associated with hearing
loss (17) and zebra ﬁsh carrying an equivalent mutation ( adcy1b morphants) exhibited sig-
niﬁcantly reduced FM1-43 dye uptake in lateral line hair cells, indicating dysfunctional
MET. These studies indicate a potential role for cAMP in modulating MET channel
sensitivity in mammals.
In this study, we determine the mechanism of cAMP modulation of the MET chan-
nel in a mammalian cochlear hair cell model. We ﬁrst characterized the cAMP effect in
rat outer hair cells (OHCs). Second, we describe a long depolarization manipulation
(LDM), which we found mirrored the effects of cAMP up-regulation. Third, by mea-
suring the mechanical changes of the hair bundle, we con ﬁrmed that cAMP and long
depolarization-induced effects on channel sensitivity are due to a reduction in gating
spring stiffness. Finally, we ﬁnd that cAMP targets the exchange protein directly acti-
vated by cAMP (EPAC) rather than protein kinase A (PKA) for modulating MET sen-
sitivity. This cAMP regulation of gating spring stiffness provides a cell signaling means
for controlling the sensitivity of MET channels.Signiﬁcance
Regulation of auditory sensitivity
contributes to the precision,dynamic range, and protection ofthe auditory system. Regulation ofthe hair cell mechanotransductionchannel is a major contributor to
controlling the sensitivity of the
auditory transduction process.The gating spring is a critical pieceof the mechanotransductionmachinery because it opens andcloses the mechanotransductionchannel, and its stiffness regulatesthe sensitivity of the
mechanotransduction process. In
the present work, we characterizethe effect of the second-messenger signaling moleculecyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP) and identify that it reducesgating spring stiffness likelythrough an exchange protein
directly activated by cAMP (EPAC)-
mediated pathway. This is aunique physiologic mechanism toregulate gating spring stiffness.

Results
cAMP Regulation of Mammalian MET. To characterize the
cAMP effect in rat OHCs, we recorded MET currents and hair
bundle displacements in response to a family of ﬂuid-jet (FJ)
force steps and generated activation curves before and afterbath application (10 min) of hydrolysis-resistant cAMP analogs(0.1 mM 8-Bromoadenosine 3
0,50-cyclic monophosphate, 8-BrcAMP,
or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate, dbcAMP) (Fig. 1 A
andB). In rat OHCs, 8-BrcAMP produced both a rightward shift
in the half activation (from 25.1 ±6.3 nm to 38.6 ±5.4 nm,
n=6,P=0.0033, paired ttest) (Fig. 1 C)a n di n c r e a s e dw i d t h
(from 53.6 ±13.3 nm to 76.2 ±20.8 nm, P=0.0025, paired
ttest) (Fig. 1 D) of the activation curve. To further support a
cAMP pathway-speci ﬁc effect, we repeated these experiments
using 0.1 mM dbcAMP. Consistent with the results from8-BrcAMP, 0.1 mM dbcAMP produced a rightward shift in thehalf-activation (from 27.3 ±4.8 nm to 56.6 ±18.7 nm, n=9,
P=0.0011, paired ttest) (Fig. 1 C) and increased width (from
66.5±13.9 nm to 97.6 ±20.1 nm, P=0.0057, paired ttest)
(Fig. 1 D) of the activation curve.
Consistent with a right-shifted activation curve, resting open
probability measurements from cells treated with 8-BrcAMP anddbcAMP were signi ﬁcantly decreased (8-BrcAMP: from 5.3 ±
1.1% to 3.7 ±0.9%, P=0.0025, paired ttest; dbcAMP: from
5.1±0.9% to 2.6 ±1.2%, P=0.00025, paired ttest) (Fig. 1 E).It is important to note that we also observed that in our control
condition (Norm Ext), the resting open probability showed astatistically signi ﬁcant decrease (Norm Ext: from 5.0 ±1.0% to
4.0±0.9%, n=8,
P=0.043, paired ttest) (Fig. 1 E). How-
ever, one-way ANOVA analysis with Tukey –Kramer post hoc
test for multiple comparisons revealed that the change in resting
open probability between the two time points was signi ﬁcantly
different for control and dbcAMP, but not between control and8-BrcAMP ( P=0.014 for control vs. dbcAMP, P=0.42 for
control vs. 8-BrcAMP, P=0.28 for 8-BrcAMP vs. dbcAMP)
(SI Appendix ,F i g .S 1 D), suggesting a true effect of dbcAMP on
resting open probability beyond the decrease we observed in the
control condition. Furthermore, we performed one-way ANOVA
analyses for the other summary data presented in Fig. 1. All one-way ANOVA with post hoc comparisons were consistent with astatistically signi ﬁcant effect of dbcAMP vs. the control ( SI
Appendix ,F i g .S 1 ).
Adaptation of the MET process is hypothesized to extend the
dynamic range and increase the frequency selectivity of the hair
cell (11 –13). Experimentally, adaptation manifests as a decay of
the MET current in response to a constant stimulus and a right-ward shift of the activation curve. We analyzed the amountof MET current decay in response to cAMP analogs before andafter applying either 8-BrcAMP or dbcAMP. We observed anonstatistically signi ﬁcant trend toward increased adaptation
with 0.1 mM 8-BrcAMP (from 21.4 ±8.9% to 29.1 ±13.2%,

P=0.11, paired ttest) (Fig. 1 F). However, dbcAMP produced
a statistically signi ﬁcant increase in adaptation magnitude (from
33.0±9.8% to 60.9 ±7.8%, P=0.00011, paired ttest) (Fig.
1F). When using FJ stimulation, we previously determined that a
single exponential provided the best ﬁt to the MET current decay,
with time constants on the order of tens of milliseconds consistentwith slow adaptation (18, 19). In response to 8-BrcAMP applica-tion, the adaptation time constant was unchanged (from 22.8 ±
10.1 ms to 26.7 ±30.4 ms, P=0.67, paired ttest) (Fig. 1 G), but
was signi ﬁcantly decreased when dbcAMP was used (from 20.4 ±
4.7 ms to 12.8 ±5.2 ms, P=0.017, paired ttest) (Fig. 1 G).
The results from experiments with cAMP analogs suggest that
cAMP can regulate the MET process. However, these experi-
ments do not provide evidence of a physiologically relevantmechanism, such that cAMP can be endogenously generatedwithin the hair cell to regulate MET. Therefore, we performed
similar experiments with 0.1 mM forskolin, a pharmacological
stimulator of endogenous adenylyl cyclases that increases theintracellular concentration of cAMP. Adenylyl cyclase isoforms
1, 6, and 9 have been shown to be expressed in the rat organ of
Corti, with some evidence of adenylyl cyclase 1 and 6 localizing tothe stereocilia of both inner hair cells (IHC) and OHCs
(17, 20 –22). We found that forskolin produced similar results as
the cAMP analogs on the activation curve [Half-Act, from 28.8 ±
7.3 nm to 54.5 ±10.3 nm, n=8,P=0.0025, paired ttest (Fig.
1C); width, from 64.3 ±25.0 nm to 94.5 ±19.9 nm, P=0.040,
paired ttest (Fig. 1 D); resting open probability, from 4.5 ±0.64%
to 2.5 ±0.62%, P=0.00058, paired ttest (Fig. 1 E
)] and slow
adaptation (magnitude, from 38.9 ±16.6% to 68.4 ±10.8%,
P=0.0041, paired ttest) (Fig. 1 F). Although the resting open
probability was signi ﬁcantly decreased in the 0.1% DMSO control
condition (from 4.4 ±1.1% to 3.4 ±1.1%, n=7,P=0.0014,
paired ttest) (Fig. 1 E), the magnitude of the change in resting
open probability between DMSO and forskolin was signi ﬁcantly
different ( P=0.028, unpaired, unequal variance ttest) ( SI
Appendix ,F i g .S 1 D). The adaptation time constant was not signi ﬁ-
cantly different for 0.1% DMSO ( P=0.29, paired ttest) (Fig.

the most consistent effects, we predominantly used these com-pounds in subsequent experiments in this study.
Long Depolarization and cAMP Have Similar Effects on MET.
Previously, we reported that depolarizing a hair cell to +76 mV
produces a transient increase in MET channel resting open proba-
bility that subsequently decays over a period of several seconds
(23, 24). In this previous work, we attributed the increase in rest-ing open probability, which has a time course exceeding 100 ms,to a mechanism involving the lipid membrane, but we did not
investigate the decay in resting open probability. Here, we describe
the effect of the decay in resting open probability at depolarizedpotentials that occurs during a depolarization of ∼10 s or longer,
which we term “long depolarization modulation ”or LDM.
We subjected OHCs to LDM, and using a stiff probe, we eli-
cited MET current families to generate activation curves at varioustime points during the depolarization ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 2 ). We
observed that during the prolonged depolarization, the activation
curve shifted rightward and became less sensitive, which remainedupon repolarization. To compare the effect before and afterLDM, we performed experiments using the FJ that were similar
to our experiments with cAMP analogs (Fig. 2 Aand B,b l a c k
and gray traces). The activation curve as measured with the FJ(Fig. 2 B) exhibited both a signi ﬁcant rightward shift (Fig. 2 C)
(Half-Act, from 32.8 ±14.7 nm to 59.8 ±17.7 nm, P=2.0E-
5, paired ttest) and increased width after depolarization (Fig. 2 C)
(Width
10–90,f r o m7 0 . 8 ±19.7 nm to 95.1 ±26.2 nm,
P=0.039, paired ttest). Resting open probability was similarly
decreased (Fig. 2 E)( R e s t i n g Popen,f r o m4 . 7 ±1.9% to 1.6 ±
1.0%, P=1.3E-5, paired ttest), while peak current was
unchanged (Fig. 2 D)( f r o m0 . 7 5 ±0.08 nA to 0.73 ±0.11 nA,
P=0.37, paired ttest). To determine the effect of LDM on
MET adaptation, we ﬁrst examined the effect on fast adaptation
using stiff probe stimuli before and after LDM and found no
effect on fast adaptation ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 3 ).
Next, we investigated the effect of LDM on slow adaptation.
Using 50-ms step-like FJ stimuli (Fig. 2 A), we found that follow-
ing LDM the adaptation magnitude was signi ﬁcantly increased
(Fig. 2 E) (Adaptation %, from 32.8 ±21.4% to 70.9 ±9.0%,
n=15,P=5.5E-7, paired ttest) and adaptation time constants
were signi ﬁcantly decreased (Fig. 2 E)(τA,from 20.1 ±9.1 ms to
9.7±2.6 ms, P=4.0E-4, paired ttest). All of the LDM effects
mirrored the cAMP up-regulation effects, raising the possibilitythat these two manipulations activate a similar mechanism.
cAMP and LDM Are Not Additive. We hypothesized that cAMP
and depolarization operate through or engage a common mecha-
nism regulating the MET channel in hair cells. Therefore, we
predicted that activation of the cAMP pathway prior to LDM
would prevent any further change to MET. Indeed, we foundthat in OHCs exposed to 0.1 mM dbcAMP, activation curve
width, resting open probability, slow adaptation magnitude, and
slow adaptation time constant were not signi ﬁcantly different
after LDM (dbcAMP, Width
10–90,P=0.97; Resting Popen,
P=0.23; % Adaptation, P=0.58; τA,P=0.23; n=12,
paired ttests) (Fig. 2 C–E). In dbcAMP-treated cells, activation
curve half activation was slightly right-shifted after depolariza-
tion (Fig. 2 C) (from 46.7 ±14.8 nm to 55.7 ±12.3 nm,
P=0.038, paired ttest), but the magnitude of the shift was sig-
niﬁcantly smaller from that in control cells ( P=0.0044,
unpaired ttest). With multiple methods to affect the resting
open probability and magnitude of adaptation, we observed a
negative linear correlation between the resting open probability
and the magnitude of slow adaptation that a cell exhibited ( r=
/C00.62, P=2.89E-16) (Fig. 2 F). These data suggest that in rat
OHCs, the resting open probability can predict the amount of
slow adaptation the cell will exhibit when stimulated with 50-ms
duration FJ step stimuli. Together, these data demonstrate that
cAMP and LDM are not additive, supporting the hypothesis
that LDM and cAMP modulate the same mechanism.
cAMP Reduces the Stiffness of the Hair Bundle. The rightward
shift and increased width of the activation curve are consistent
with a decrease in gating spring stiffness. The total stiffness of the
hair bundle ( kHB) is dictated by at least two structural compo-
nents that exert forces with opposite vectors: the stiffness of gating
springs ( kGS), which exerts a force in the negative direction, pull-
ing the hair bundle in the direction of the shortest row of stereoci-
lia, and the stiffness of stereocilia pivots ( kSP), which imposes a
resistive force in the opposite direction of the gating spring force.
According to gating spring theory (6), a decrease in gating spring
stiffness increases the width of the activation curve and wouldresult in a movement of the hair bundle toward the tallest row of
stereocilia (Fig. 3 AandC). As the contributions of k
GS(Fig. 3 A)
andkSP(Fig. 3 B) to the total hair bundle stiffness ( kHB) decreases
or increases, we can identify relative movements of the hair bun-
dle and changes in kHB. Importantly, only changes to the gating

spring stiffness would result in changes in the activation curve
since changes to kSPdo not modify gating (Fig. 3 C) (5, 6, 25).
To further support the hypothesis that the gating spring stiff-
ness is decreased with cAMP up-regulation and LDM, we mea-
sured the relative change in total hair bundle stiffness with FJ
hair bundle stimulation and high-speed imaging at 5 min afterentering whole-cell mode (control) followed by 10 min of
0.2 mM dbcAMP application (dbcAMP) (Fig. 3 D). In these
experiments, extreme care was used to ensure that the positionof the FJ in relation to the hair bundle (in X,Y,a n d Z)w a sc o n -
sistent between the 5-min and 10-min postdrug conditions so
that the force from the FJ on the hair bundle remained consis-tent between the two time points. This allowed us to use the
driving voltage command to the FJ piezo as a proxy for the rela-
tive force on the hair bundle. These values only apply to a givencell and cannot be compared across different cells due to the dif-ferent hair bundle morphologies and characteristics and position-
ing of the FJ in each given hair cell; therefore, we normalized
the stiffness values against the control condition for each cell.We plotted driver voltage against the hair bundle displacement
at the end of the 50-ms FJ step, where the displacement is more
stable, and ﬁt this with a linear equation (forced through the ori-
gin). The relative stiffness of the hair bundle was unchanged
when no drug was present (Fig. 3 EandG)( 1 1±30%, n=7)
but signi ﬁcantly decreased when 0.2 mM dbcAMP was perfused
(Fig. 3 FandH)(/C013±12%, n=11). To gain some insight
into the size of the change, we estimated the total hair bundle
stiffness in the control conditions by calibrating the FJ force(26). We found a hair bundle stiffness of 6.3 ±1.3 mN/m
(n=6), similar to previous results (26, 27). With the observed
13% decrease in stiffness with cAMP up-regulation, the hair
bundle stiffness would decrease to 5.5 mN/m.
We also assayed the effect of LDM on total hair bundle stiff-
ness using the same method as in Fig. 3 D–H. We found that
LDM signi ﬁcantly decreased the total stiffness of the hair bundle
in control cells ( /C022±15%, n=15) but had no effect in
dbcAMP-treated cells (2 ±19%, n=12) (Fig. 3 I), which fur-
ther supports that the two manipulations are not additive. With
these changes in total hair bundle stiffness, it was surprising not
to see any consistent effects on the kinetics of the hair bundle
movement ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 4 ). It could be that the changes
in hair bundle mechanics were not large enough to elicit a suf ﬁ-
cient change in the movement kinetics. In summary, these data
demonstrate that after cAMP up-regulation or LDM, hair bun-
dle stiffness decreased, consistent with a decrease in kGSorkSP.
To delineate between an effect on kGSorkSP,w et e s t e d
whether the changes in hair bundle stiffness were correlated with
changes in the activation curve. The inverse of the width of the
activation curve is linearly related to kGS(SI Appendix ,Materials
and Methods ). We indeed found that kGSand 1/width are corre-
lated (Fig. 3 J)(r=0.57, P=4.6E-5). These data suggest that
gating spring stiffness is decreased upon cAMP up-regulation orLDM.
LDM Results in Decreased Gating Spring Stiffness. The shorter
timescale of the LDM process allows continuous monitoring of

change in width ( P=0.97, paired ttest). ( D) Peak MET current size was unchanged after depolarization for both control and cAMP-treated cells ( Imax, control,

course of minutes precludes accurate resting position measure-ments because the movement noise is too high on that timescale.With the shorter activation time of LDM over the time course of
∼10 s, we designed an experiment to monitor the changes in the
stiffness of the hair bundle, the resting position of the hair bun-dle, and the change in the activation curve simultaneously (Fig.

(19), we subjected rat OHCs to intermittent sine wave stimuli ofthe same ﬂuid drag force during LDM. Upon depolarization to

of 23.3 ±12.1% (Fig. 4 G)(ΔPopen+76 mV,/C028.1±10.4%).
This decrease in resting open probability indicates the rightward
shift of the activation curve. Concurrently, the hair bundleunderwent mechanical changes that developed over a time course
similar to the decline in resting open probability during the depo-
larization (Fig. 4 E). In response to sine wave stimulations of iden-
tical driver voltage, the resting position of the hair bundle movedforward (Fig. 4 D,E,a n d H)(Δx
rest/C084 mV, 27.3±30.4 nm), and
the normalized displacement of the hair bundle increased (Fig.
4D,E,a n d I)(xpk-pkend/xpk-pkstart, 1.20 ±0.16), indicating that
total hair bundle stiffness decreased, which is consistent with our
previous observations (Fig. 3 H). We observed a small increase in
hair bundle stiffness immediately upon depolarization ( ﬁrst+76 mV,
3.6±7.2%), which differed from a previous report (27). Simi-
lar observations on resting position and total hair bundle stiff-
ness were made when 10 mM intracellular BAPTA was used(SI Appendix ,F i g .S 5 A–D). The observation that the resting
position increases with a decrease in total hair bundle stiffness
is only consistent with the hypothesis that LDM decreases k

control experiments to ensure that the mechanical changes observedwere not an artifact. First, we performed the same mechanical pro-tocol but did not depolarize the cell (Fig. 4 F–I,b r o w nc i r c l e s )
(“/C084 mV Control ”). Next, the effects of depolarization on resting
open probability and hair bundle mechanics only occur for haircells that have not been recently depolarized, since after inducingLDM, the cell requires time (on the order of minutes) to returnfrom the effects of LDM with the rate depending on the intracellu-
lar BAPTA concentration ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 5 E–G). Therefore,
subsequent depolarizations delivered immediately following the ini-tial depolarization have little to no effect (Fig. 4 A,B,a n d D,g r a y )
(“2
nd+76 mV ”). Third, cells that were treated with either 0.1 mM
dbcAMP or forskolin did not exhibit the increase in resting openprobability, change in resting open probability during the depolari-zation, or changes in hair bundle mechanics (Fig. 4 D,r e d )

(“1stPresentation w/cAMP ”), and appeared like a cell that was
already subjected to LDM (Fig. 4 B,F–I, comparing gray and red)
(Max Popen+76 mV,P=0.65;ΔPopen+76 mV,P=0.27;Δxrest/C084 mV,
P=0.95; xpk-pkend/xpk-pkstart,P=0.40, Tukey –Kramer post hoc
test). This observation also supports that the activation of the cAMP
pathway and LDM function through the same mechanism.
Finally, we repeated these experiments after calcium-chelator
treatment (EDTA) via iontophoresis to sever tip links and, there-fore, the gating springs (18, 26, 28). Hair bundles that lack tip
links only have k
SPcontributing to the hair bundle stiffness and
should not exhibit any of the mechanical changes in response toLDM that modulates gating springs. EDTA-treated hair bundles
exhibited neither the positive change in resting position nor the
increase in displacement size after depolarization (Fig. 4 H–I,c o m -
paring black to blue) ( Δx
rest/C084 mV,P=0.0055; xpk-pkend/xpk-pkstart,
P=0.00017, Tukey –Kramer post hoc test). This experiment also
indicates that in the absence of tip links, LDM does not change
hair bundle stiffness, suggesting that LDM does not affect kSP.
One-way ANOVA analysis revealed statistical signi ﬁcance for all
measured parameters (Fig. 4 F–I), indicating that the experimental
condition of LDM was different from the control conditions.Together, these control experiments provide evidence that the
mechanical changes we observed are real, thus indicating that
LDM causes a decrease in gating spring stiffness.
In all experiments performed in Fig. 4, we observed a negative
correlation between the maximum resting open probability thata cell exhibited during the depolarization (typically occurring in
theﬁrst second (Fig. 4 D, black) and the amount of adaptation
that the cell exhibited before being depolarized. In other words,OHCs that exhibited smaller magnitudes of slow adaptation
before being depolarized typically displayed higher maximum
resting open probability values upon depolarization (Fig. 4 J)
(r=/C00.66, P=5.62E-9). Higher maximum resting open prob-
ability suggested that the cell was further from the LDM state,
consistent with a lower adaptation magnitude. This ﬁnding sup-
ports that cells may exist in a continuum of states where LDM
moves the cell toward exhibiting a larger slow adaptation magni-
tude and lower maximum resting open probability.
cAMP and LDM Decrease the Contribution of the Gating
Springs to Total Hair Bundle Stiffness. A third method to con-
ﬁrm a change in kGSwas to measure the contribution of kGSto
kHBby disrupting tip links. We performed experiments where
hair cells were either depolarized or treated with 0.2 mM
dbcAMP, and we measured hair bundle displacements beforeand after severing tip links with iontophoresis of the calcium-
chelator EDTA (26, 28). Assuming the stiffness of the hair bun-
dle after EDTA treatment is only comprised of k
SP, we can then
calculate the contribution of kGStokHB(see SI Appendix ,
Materials and Methods for calculation). If LDM and cAMP
decrease kGS,t h e nw ew o u l de x p e c t kGS/kHBto decrease after
LDM or cAMP up-regulation. Hair bundle displacements were
measured in response to nonsaturating sinusoidal FJ stimulation
before and after a 7-s iontophoretic application of EDTA (Fig.5B,D,a n d G). In all experiments, patch-clamp recording of the
MET current was used to ensure near-complete tip-link break-
age, as measured by MET currents in response to saturating FJstimuli after the iontophoresis protocol (Fig. 5 B,C,a n d F).
Cells with >75 pA of MET current remaining after EDTA
treatment were not included for analysis. Consistent with ourhypothesis, we found that LDM or dbcAMP treatmentcaused a decreased k
GS/kHBcompared with controls (Fig.
5E) (IHCs, control, 0.58 ±0.067, depolarized, 0.49 ±0.10,
P=0.042) (Fig. 5 F)( O H C s ,c o n t r o l ,0 . 5 6 ±0.06,dbcAMP, 0.42 ±0.13, P=0.011, unpaired, unequal variance t
tests). Together, both depolarization in IHCs, and dbcAMP treat-
ment in OHCs, reduced the contribution of the gating springs to
the total stiffness of the hair bundle, indicating that both manipu-lations decreased the stiffness of the gating springs.

cAMP Modulates MET through EPAC, Not PKA. The classic down-
stream target of cAMP is PKA, also known as the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. cAMP promotes the dissociation of theregulatory and catalytic subunits of PKA to allow phosphorylation
of proteins via the catalytic subunit (29). To determine if the
effects we observed with cAMP pharmacology were a result ofdownstream activation of PKA, we inhibited PKA activity whilesimultaneously activating the cAMP pathway. Using two differentPKA inhibitors, H89 and PKI, we tested if PKA inhibition couldprevent the changes in the activation curve observed with cAMPactivation. H89 inhibits PKA by competing for the ATP bindingsite on the catalytic subunit (29). We used H89 at 10 μM, over
200 times its K
i(30) and 10 times greater than the concentration
used in IHCs to inhibit PKA modulation of potassium currents(31). At this concentration, data were similar to that using anactivator alone (Fig. 6 C–G, blue) (Half-Act: from 29.1 ±9.7 nm
to 55.0 ±34.4 nm, P=0.013; Width
10–90:f r o m6 5 . 1 ±15.0 nm
to 96.8 ±50.0 nm, P=0.038; Resting Popen:f r o m4 . 9 ±0.8% to

±23.5%, P=0.0021; τA:f r o m2 8 . 9 ±47.5 ms to 12.9 ±5.9 ms,
P=0.23; paired ttest). PKI is also an inhibitor of the catalytic sub-
unit of PKA by binding to the substrate-binding pocket whileunable to be phosphorylated (29). PKI has a K
iof 1.7 nM according
to the manufacturer, and we used PKI intracellularly at 1 μMa n d5
μM and did not observe any difference. Data with PKI corroborated
the data with H89 and were also similar to data with activator alone(Fig. 6 C–G, purple) (Half-Act: from 29.1 ±9.0 nm to 60.1 ±
19.8 nm, P=0.0013; Width
10–90:f r o m7 3 . 7 ±10.1 nm to
90.6±22.7 nm, P=0.048; Resting Popen:f r o m5 . 0 ±1.1% to

to 54.1 ±28.6%, P=0.0080; τA: from 31.6 ±50.6 ms to 15.8 ±
12.6 ms, P=0.41; paired ttest). Unexpectedly, these data indicate
that PKA is not responsible for the rightward shift and increasedwidth of the activation curve observed with cAMP activation.
Another potential cAMP signaling pathway is through the
EPAC (32, 33). To test whether EPAC activation can recapitulatethe cAMP effect, we used the EPAC-speci ﬁc agonist 8-(4-Chloro-
phenylthio)-2
0-O-methyladenosine-30,50-cyclic monophosphate
(8-CPT). 8-CPT is a potent and selective superagonist of EPACover PKA (34). 8-CPT can be used up to about 10 μM, where
there is about 20% activation of PKA and near 100% activation ofEPAC (34). When 8-CPT was included in the intracellular solu-tion at 1 μMa n d5 μM, hair cells behaved similarly to when the
cAMP pathway is activated with dbcAMP or forskolin with a right-ward shift of the activation curve and increase in adaptation magni-t u d eo v e rt i m e( F i g .6 ,g r e e n )( H a l f - A c t :f r o m3 8 . 9 ±1.9 nm to

48.7±23.9%, P=0.0035; τA: from 22.6 ±15.3 ms to 20.2 ±
12.1 ms, P=0.71; paired ttest). The results from all three phar-
macological manipulations (H89, PKI, and 8-CPT) are consistentwith the cAMP effect being mediated by EPAC. We also testedwhether there was a baseline level of cAMP activity by using thecAMP inhibitor Rp-cAMPS at 0.1 mM, near the IC
50for EPAC1
(35). We found that there was no effect with Rp-cAMPS on thehair cell activation curve ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 6 ). Taken together,
these data suggest that cAMP functions through an EPAC medi-ated pathway, not PKA, to decrease gating spring stiffness.
Discussion
Regulation of hair cell MET is critical to our auditory system ’s
high precision and wide dynamic range (11 –13). Growingevidence indicates the existence of other mechanisms that mod-
ulate the activity of the MET channel apart from the classic
adaptation processes (24, 36). The present study expands on
early work from turtle and bullfrog hair cells (15, 16) and dem-onstrates that up-regulation of the second messenger cAMP, aswell as LDM, modulates the MET channel by decreasing the
gating spring stiffness. Data are also consistent with the cAMP
effect occurring through activation of EPAC and not the classicPKA mediated pathways.
In this study, we ﬁrst demonstrated that in rat OHCs, phar-
macological agents that increased intracellular cAMP signalingreduced the sensitivity of the MET channel (Fig. 1). We subse-quently characterized another manipulation, LDM. Previously,
we characterized the changes that occur during depolarization,
where there is initially an increase in the resting open probabil-ity followed by a subsequent decrease in open probability (24).The increase in resting open probability involved the lipid
bilayer and is a separate mechanism from the LDM described
here. LDM results in a decline in resting open probability andalters MET properties similarly to cAMP up-regulation ( SI
Appendix , Figs. S2 and S3 ). We also hypothesize that hair cells
exist in a continuum of states where the MET channel resting
open probability and the magnitude of slow adaptation are
inversely related. Further experiments demonstrated that cAMPup-regulation combined with LDM did not affect MET or hairbundle mechanics in an additive manner, suggesting that the
two manipulations act at a common end effector site (i.e.,
gating spring) to modulate MET (Fig. 2), potentially through dif-ferent signaling cascades. Both manipulations resulted in decreasedMET channel sensitivity, consistent with a decrease in gating spring
stiffness (6).
To test the hypothesis of reduced gating spring stiffness, we
performed experiments that allowed us to quantify mechanical
changes in the hair bundle. In a simplistic view, the stiffness of
the hair bundle consists of the contributions of the stiffnesses ofthe gating springs ( k
GS) and stereocilia pivots ( kSP), which
encompasses contributions by other interstereociliary links as
well. The gating springs can contribute ∼50% of the total hair
bundle stiffness (18, 26). At rest, the hair bundle position isdetermined by the tension in the tip link pulling the hair bundlein the negative direction and the resistive force of the stereocilia
pivots. Alterations in k
GS, but not kSP, are associated with
changes in the activation curve (Fig. 3 A–C). We ﬁrst found that
cAMP up-regulation and LDM were associated with a decreasein hair bundle stiffness, which was correlated with a widening ofthe activation curve (Fig. 3 J), all being consistent with an effect
onk
GS. Next, we found that in response to LDM, the hair bun-
dle exhibited a positive change in the resting position (towardthe tallest row of stereocilia) and an increase in the displacementsize (Fig. 4), which is consistent with a gating spring stiffness
decrease, not a decrease in stereocilia pivot stiffness (Fig. 3 AandB).
Additionally, LDM in the absence of tip links did not change thestiffness of the hair bundle, indicating no effect on k
SP.
Finally, using an iontophoresis technique to sever tip links,
we could estimate the change in the stiffness of the gatingsprings in response to either cAMP analogs or depolarization bymeasuring the displacement of the hair bundle in response to a
FJ stimulus of the same ﬂuid drag force before and after severing
the tip-links. We found that both cAMP and depolarizationdecreased the contribution of the gating springs to the total hairbundle stiffness (Fig. 5). The gating spring theory posits that
changes in gating spring stiffness will result in a change in the
MET channel sensitivity (6). With cAMP up-regulation usingdbcAMP, we observed a 47% average increase in the width of

the activation curve (Fig. 1 D). According to the gating spring
theory, this would be the result of a 32% decrease in gating
spring stiffness. When combining the measured changes in kHB
(Fig. 3 H)a n d kGS/kHB(Fig. 5 I), we estimate a 34% decrease in
kGSon average upon cAMP pathway activation. These two val-
ues, which are calculated based on different experimental meas-
ures, are consistent with each other, suggesting that kGSchanges
can account for most of the stiffness changes we observed. Thesedata indicate that cAMP and LDM modulate hair cell MET by
decreasing gating spring stiffness.
Knowing that the gating spring is the target of cAMP activa-
tion, we sought to determine the signaling pathway. PKA is the
classic cAMP target; however, two speci ﬁc PKA inhibitors were
unable to block the cAMP effect (Fig. 6 C–G, blue and purple).Instead, we found that cAMP functions through EPAC to
mediate the decrease in gating spring stiffness by using an
EPAC-speci ﬁc activator (Fig. 6, green). Failure of PKA-speci ﬁc
inhibitors to block the cAMP effect along with the speci ﬁc
EPAC activator (8-CPT) mimicking the cAMP effect stronglysuggests the EPAC pathway mediating the decreased gating
spring stiffness. Ideally, inhibition of the EPAC pathway would
help to further support the pathway, however, current inhibi-tors of the EPAC pathway, like ESI-09 and HJC0197, have
general protein denaturing capabilities and may not be compet-
itive inhibitors of EPAC (37). Further experiments are stillrequired to identify an appropriate inhibitor of the pathway,
but current data are supportive of an EPAC pathway regulating

Implications for Auditory Function. cAMP signaling is a ubiq-
uitous pathway in many cell types and serves a variety of differ-
ent cellular functions. Although the effect of cAMP on MET wasdocumented over two decades ago, the mechanism of action and sig-
naling pathway has not been elucidated until now. These ﬁndings
provide a potential mechanism for G protein-coupled receptors(GPCRs) to modulate gating spring stiffness and the sound trans-duction process.
A potential function of the cAMP pathway in hair cells is to
provide some level of protection during levels of high-intensitystimulation. cAMP could be up-regulated to decrease MET
sensitivity to protect against damage. Another potential path-
way could operate through GPCRs and downstream activationof G
sαto stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity to modulate MET
activity, but the participation of GPCRs in hair cell MET regu-
lation is yet to be explored.
A resting level of cAMP could allow for bidirectional control
of gating spring stiffness, hence hair cell sensitivity. This has
been demonstrated to modulate spontaneous oscillation fre-
quency in bullfrog saccular hair cells (16). However, in mamma-lian hair cells, there does not appear to be a resting level of
cAMP activity since Rp-cAMPS, which inhibits both PKA and
EPAC (to a lesser extent) activation (35, 38), did not cause aleftward shift in the activation curve ( SI Appendix ,F i g .S 6 ). This
result argues against cAMP levels being the determinant of
where a given hair cell sits on the continuum of states shown bythe resting open probability and baseline level of slow adaptation
(Figs. 2 Fand 4 J); however, this hypothesis cannot be fully ruled
out since further experiments using higher concentrations ofRp-cAMPS and different EPAC inhibitors are required.
Potential Molecular Mechanisms of Modulating Gating Spring
Stiffness. The molecular and structural composition of the gating
springs is still debated (36). The tip link was originally thought to
be the gating spring (6), however, electron microscopy and molec-ular dynamics simulations later suggest that the tip link itself may
not be the gating spring due to its rigidity (39, 40). Even more
recent data have revived the suggestion that the tip link could con-tribute to the gating spring (41, 42). Even if the tip link contrib-utes to the gating spring stiffness through the structure of its
extracellular domains, it is unlikely to be the target of the cAMP
effect since the EPAC signaling pathway is likely restricted tointracellular targets. In addition to the tip link, gating spring stiff-
ness may arise from any component in series with the tip link.
Potential elements could be the myosin motors (like myosin VIIa)or their adapter proteins at the upper tip-link insertion point
(9, 43, 44), as well as other components at the lower tip-link
insertion important for MET, such as CIB2, TMIE, LHFPL5,or TMC1 (2, 3, 45 –48). The gating spring stiffness may also
potentially arise from its interaction with the lipid bilayer of the
stereocilia membrane, where the upper and lower ends of thetip link insert before being anchored to the f-actin core (49).Any of these components could be the target of the EPAC-
mediated regulation.
EPAC acts as a guanine exchange factor for the Rap1 and
Rap2 small GTPases. Rap has many potential downstream effec-
tor pathways, which could lead to modulating gating spring stiff-
ness (33). A notable pathway is one that down-regulates the RhoAsignaling pathway to increase smooth muscle relaxation (50) andcould target the actin cytoskeleton in hair bundles. More detailed
studies are required to elucidate the complete signaling pathway.A recent study has localized both EPAC1 and EPAC2 to haircells in both auditory and vestibular hair cells (51). Only oneother study has investigated EPAC in hair cells, where EPAC1was up-regulated in hair cells following noise exposure and pro-moted the loss of hair cells (52). Our observations on decreasing
gating spring stiffness appear opposite to the effect observed in
this study, since decreasing the sensitivity would likely be a pro-tective mechanism to help prevent excitotoxicity of the hair cell.Reconciling these ﬁndings may lie in the timescale of effects
since our study looked at the effect on the minute timescale,whereas the other study looked at effects on the timescale ofdays. Nonetheless, these published studies con ﬁrm the presence
of EPAC in hair cells.
A recent study demonstrated that the diffusivity of the lipid
membrane is correlated with the resting P
open of the MET
channel; manipulations that decrease membrane diffusivityincrease the resting P
openof the channel (53). Importantly, dur-
ing a long depolarization (i.e., LDM), the membrane diffusivityincreased, suggesting that in the LDM state, membrane diffu-sivity is increased. It is reasonable to hypothesize that lipid dif-fusivity may contribute to gating spring stiffness by alteringhow rigidly the tip link is held in place within the membrane(at either the upper or lower tip-link insertion) or the compli-
ance of the membrane surrounding the channel if MET chan-
nels are gated via the lipid membrane itself. Further work isnecessary to determine if cAMP/EPAC signaling also increasesmembrane diffusivity.
In summary, our ﬁndings demonstrate that cAMP and long
depolarization both modulate the activity of auditory MET bydecreasing the stiffness of the gating springs that gate the METchannel. These results demonstrate cAMP regulation of the
MET process in mammalian hair cells and introduce a poten-
tial mechanism for GPCR regulation of hair cell function.
Methods Summary
Animals were killed using methods approved by the University of Colorado Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Patch-clamp electrophysiology,
mechanical stimulation, and high-speed imaging of hair bundles are similar to
previously described methods on rat cochlear hair cells (18, 19, 24). Iontophore-sis was performed using an MVCS 02 (NPI Electronic). Hair bundle stiffness
estimates were performed similarly to the methods previously described (26).
Data were analyzed using jClamp (SciSoft Company), MATLAB (MathWorks), andExcel (Microsoft). Data are presented as mean ±SD unless otherwise noted.
