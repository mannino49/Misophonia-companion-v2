Imagine opening your sock drawer and \nfinding a pineapple inside. How surprised should you be? Under normal circumstances, you would expect to see socks, but if your four-year-old niece is visiting, you might adjust your expectations \nto suit a more volatile environment, thereby lessening any surprise. \nHowever, overestimating how volatile your bedroom is may result in compromised learning of the association between the cue (sock drawer) and outcome (socks) in the first place. In other words,  \naberrant representation of volatility may impair the dynamic  \nformation of appropriate prior expectations, thereby rendering both the pineapple and the socks mildly surprising. Bayesian theories of perception in people with ASD (although we abide by the terminology  \nof the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth \nEdition  (DSM-5), we wish to acknowledge that the term ‘autistic \nperson’ is preferred by many people on the spectrum)\n1 propose that \nreduced weighting of prior expectations relative to sensory inputs leads to the perceptual atypicalities associated with the condition\n2–7; \nhowever, no studies to date have actually quantified the learning  \ndynamics by which sensory expectations are formed in ASD.  \nHere we sought to empirically address whether volatility learning is compromised in ASD\n6,7.\nComputationally, the amount of weight given to a surprising event \nis determined by its precision (inverse variance, proportional to \nlearning rate α), with α determining the rate of integration over past \nevents to predict future outcomes. Although computational studies \nof decision-making regarding rewards and punishments have shown that participants adapt their rate of learning about action–outcome contingencies in response to changes in environmental volatility\n8–10, \nthese models do not fit individual differences in volatility learning. However, knowing whether to disregard an unexpected outcome \nor to take it seriously (i.e., whether to adopt a high or low learn -\ning rate about cue–outcome probabilities) depends on the preci -\nsion of one’s beliefs about environmental change (i.e., whether one \nadopts a high or low learning rate regarding volatility). The recent \napplication of hierarchical learning models has allowed for the  \nquantification of individual learning about both probabilistic relation -\nships and how these relationships change over time (volatility)\n11–14, \nbut no studies have applied these models to understand learning about \nuncertainty in ASD.\nIn a state in which uncertainty about one’s beliefs is high (for exam -\nple, in volatile conditions), top-down prior expectations should be suppressed relative to new bottom-up sensory evidence, to promote new learning about the current environmental context\n15. With their \nbroad distribution and extensive connectivity, neuromodulatory sys -\ntems are ideally positioned to facilitate the widespread changes in \nneural gain necessary to support such a function16. Noradrenaline \n(NA), in particular, is thought to signal contextual change, thus lead -\ning to enhanced bottom-up, thalamocortical transmission of sensory information\n17–19. Recent neurocomputational accounts of autism have \nproposed that aberrant signaling of volatility may result in pathologi -\ncal neural gain consistent with the cognitive and perceptual profile of autism, such as enhanced perceptual functioning, sensory overload \nand context insensitivity\n4–6,20.\nHere, we tested these computational and neurobiological hypothe -\nses by examining how adults with ASD responded to experimentally \n1Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London, London, UK. 2Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, London, UK. \n3Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. 4Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati (SISSA), Trieste, Italy. 5Max Planck  \nUCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing, University College London, London, UK. 6Translational Neuromodeling Unit, Institute for Biomedical \nEngineering, University of Zurich and Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.

To do so, we used a hierarchical Bayesian \nmodel that allowed us to characterize each participant’s learning \n‘fingerprint’ , specifically the simultaneous learning about multiple different sources of environmental uncertainty\n11. We hypothesized \nthat adults with ASD would show reduced behavioral and neuro -\nphysiological responses in statistical contrasts of ‘unexpected’ (UE) \nand ‘expected’ (E) trials based on the experimental ‘ground truth’ \n(for example, reduced surprise when surprise would be expected for neurotypical (NT) individuals). This hypothesis is in line with results of previous studies showing a decreased distinction between \nrepeated and novel stimuli in ASD\n21–23. However, we hypothesized \nthat computational modeling of the actual learning process for each \nindividual would demonstrate an increased tendency to represent \nand respond to environmental volatility in ASD, thus compromising  \nlearning about probabilistic relationships in the environment. \nAccordingly, we hypothesized that adults with ASD would show increased sensitivity of the pupil dilatory response to computational \nmetrics of prediction error, which estimate when each individual \nis actually surprised.\nRESULTS\nWe used a modified version of a common probabilistic associative \nlearning task\n24 to test the effects of learned expectations and sensory \nnoise on behavior (reaction times (RT), error rates) and indices of \nphasic NA function (pupillometry)25 in adults with ASD ( n = 24) \nand age- and intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched NT adults ( n = 25) \n(Online Methods).\nParticipants performed binary classification of images as either \nfaces or houses, and images had high, medium or no noise added.  \nA tone preceding each image was highly, weakly or not predictive of a given outcome, and these image–tone associations changed across time \n(Fig. 1), such that trials could be categorized as E, UE or neutral (N).  \nThis process created a ground-truth structure in the environment \nthat participants had to implicitly learn. In contrast to reinforcement-learning\n26,27, implicit-motor-learning28 and serial-reaction-time29 \ntasks that have examined sensitivity to probability manipulations in ASD, this task addresses perceptual associative learning and explicitly  \nmanipulated three different forms of uncertainty (categorical sensory  \nuncertainty, probabilistic uncertainty and environmental uncertainty).  \nWhen a participant received an unexpected outcome, the outcome might have reflected a probabilistically aberrant event, or it might have \nsignaled that the environmental context had changed. To quantify  \nindividual learning about these different forms of uncertainty, RTs \nwere modeled with a Bayesian belief-update scheme\n11 (Online \nMethods). The model implied each participant’s beliefs about these quantities, as reflected in the sequence of cue–outcome associations \nreceived by each participant and their trial-by-trial responses and \nresponse times.\nBehavior\nFirst, we examined behavioral responses, and E and UE trials were \ncategorized according to the ground truth.\nReaction times.  Reaction times (RTs) were subjected to a 3 × 3 \nmixed ANOVA with within-subject factors of expectedness (E, N \nand UE), noise (high, medium or none) and a between-participant \nfactor of group (ASD and NT). There was a significant main effect of expectedness ( F(2,94) = 25.48, P < 0.001) and noise ( F(2,94) = 13.60, P < 0.001), thus indicating that RTs were slower for UE and \nhigh-noise stimuli relative to E and low-noise stimuli. A significant main effect of group ( F(1,47) = 4.83, P = 0.03) indicated that, in  \ngeneral, the participants with ASD were slower to respond than the \nNT participants. Crucially, only the expectedness × group interaction \nwas significant in this analysis ( F(2,94) = 4.47, P = 0.014; Fig. 2 a). \nThe noise × group ( F(2,94) = 0.06, P = 0.94), noise × expectedness \n(F\n(4,188) = 0.47, P = 0.76) and expectedness × noise × group interac -\ntions were not significant ( F(4,188) = 1.31, P = 0.28). These results \nsuggested that for both groups, increasing sensory noise resulted \nin slower RT ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), but adults with ASD showed \nreduced modulation of RT as a function of learned expectations.  \nThis result was consistent with a decreased influence of prior infor -\nmation on perception and action in ASD2, although future studies \nshould explore how learned expectations affect perceiving structure \nin true noise or 50/50 composite images in which reliance on prior \nbeliefs should be greater.\nThe results were unchanged when the identical analysis was carried \nout on log reaction times ( Supplementary Table 1 ).\nSubtracting the RTs to E outcomes from the RTs to UE outcomes \nprovided a low-level index of ‘surprise’ , which was significantly greater \nthan zero in both groups (ASD, t(23) = 4.66, P < 0.001; NT, t(24) = 7.25, \nP < 0.001) but was attenuated in the ASD group relative to the NT group \n(t(47) = 3.51, P = 0.001; Fig. 2 b). These results suggested less distinction \nbetween UE and E outcomes in ASD, though this effect was conditioned \nupon adequate learning of the ground truth.\nTo ensure that the group difference in UE – E RT persisted over and \nabove participants’ mean ‘baseline’ RT and error rates, we conducted a \nlinear regression to predict UE – E RT with group (ASD and NT), mean \nRT and mean errors as predictors. This model was significant overall \n(F(3,48) = 5.58, P = 0.002), and the only significant predictor of the UE \n– E RT difference was group ( t = −2.87, P = 0.008). Mean RT ( t = −1.08. \nP = 0.28) and mean error ( t = 1.06, P = 0.29) were not significant predic -\ntors.

We do, however, recognize \nthat the slower overall responses (and higher accuracy) in the ASD group may indicate a tendency to manage uncertainty with increased response thresholds, which could be tested with drift diffusion mod -\nels\n30,31 in future studies in which error rates are higher by design.\nError rates.  The same analysis as above was conducted for error rates. \nThere was a significant main effect of expectedness ( F(1.5,70.5) = 11.71,  \nP < 0.001) and a significant group × expectedness interaction ( F(2,94) = 6.34,  \nP = 0.003), thus indicating that the NT group made more errors in \nUE relative to E trials, whereas the ASD group did not ( Fig. 2 c).  \nThe main effect of noise was not significant in this analysis ( F(1.7,78.8) \n= 0.08, P = 0.92), and neither were the noise × group ( F(2,94) = 0.29,  \nP = 0.75), noise × expectedness ( F(4,188) = 0.76, P = 0.55) and expect-\nedness × noise × group interactions ( F(4,188) = 1.28, P = 0.28).\nThe results were very similar when the identical analysis was car -\nried out on log error rates ( Supplementary Table 1 ).\nSubtracting the percentage errors to E outcomes from those to \nUE outcomes provided a low-level index of surprise, which was sig -\nnificantly greater than zero in only the NT group (ASD, t(23) = 1.11,  \nP = 0.28; NT, t(24) = 3.65, P = 0.001) and was attenuated in the ASD \ngroup relative to the NT group ( t(33.4) = 2.83, P = 0.007; Fig. 2 d).\nRelation to symptoms.  To explore the relationship between behav -\nioral surprise and ASD symptom severity we conducted a multiple \nlinear regression predicting the UE – E RT measure with the Autism \nDiagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS-2) communication, social reciprocal interaction scores and IQ as predictors. This model was significant ( F(3,23) = 3.28, P = 0.04), and communication score \nwas the only significant predictor ( t = −2.57, P = 0.018; Fig. 3). IQ  \n(t = 1.45, P = 0.16) and social reciprocal interaction scores ( t = 0.95, \nP = 0.35) did not predict behavioral surprise.\nA second regression model that also contained baseline RT as a \npredictor narrowly missed the overall significance threshold ( F(6,23) \n= 2.41, P = 0.07), and communication score was once again the only \nsignificant predictor ( t = −2.81, P = 0.012). A third regression model, in \na reduced sample size (Online Methods), additionally included sensory sensitivity scores as a predictor of UE – E RT. This model was not sig -\nnificant ( F\n(4,21) = 1.28, P = 0.32), and the only predictor approaching \nsignificance was, again, communication score (t  = −1.89, P = 0.076).\nCommunication, as measured by the ADOS-2, predominantly \nweights stereotyped and repetitive speech and conversational reciproc -\nity, which arguably necessitate reflexive behavioral responses to change. Future studies should examine the specificity of this link between gen-eral behavioral adaptations to learned expectations and communica -\ntion abilities, especially as measured by different instruments.\nNonclinical replication. Beyond the range of clinical phenotypes seen \nin people diagnosed with ASD, a wider continuum of social-communi -\ncative ability is expressed as autistic traits in the general population\n32. \nEncouragingly, the relationship between our behavioral measure of sur -\nprise (UE – E RT) and autistic tendency was replicated in an independ -\nent nonclinical sample ( n = 57) of participants characterized according \nto expression of autistic traits ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). This result not only bolsters confidence in our clinical finding but additionally sup -\nports generalization of our findings to the broader autism spectrum in \nthe wider population.\nResponses to different stimulus types.  Finally, control analyses indi -\ncated that there were no group differences in response time or accu -\nracy across the face and house stimuli ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ).\nComputational modeling\nTo investigate learning about distinct kinds of uncertainty in ASD, we adopted a participant-specific Bayesian model to track the role of \nuncertainty on behavior (log RTs). In the hierarchical Gaussian filter \n(HGF)\n11, beliefs are updated via prediction errors, with dynamic learn -\ning rates ( α) at each level ( i) influenced by uncertainty about the accu -\nracy of current beliefs and environmental volatility ( Fig. 4 a). In the \nversion of the HGF used here (introduced in ref. 33), learning occurs \nsimultaneously on three coupled levels of an uncertainty hierarchy (x\n1, x2 and x3). Level 1 ( x1) addresses uncertainty about outcomes \n(face or house), level 2 ( x2) addresses uncertainty about probabilities \n(cue–outcome contingencies), and level 3 ( x3) addresses uncertainty \nabout environmental change (volatility). Additional model details can be found in Online Methods and Supplementary Table 2 .\nModel validation.  First, to ensure that the HGF performed well \nas a model describing the behavior of our participants, we fit three alternative learning models to the data and compared them to the \nHGF with random-effects Bayesian-model selection (BMS).

Importantly, BMS evaluates the relative \nplausibility of competing models in terms of their log evidences by \nquantifying the trade-off between the accuracy (fit) and complexity of a model, and it accounts for the possibility that the observed vari -\nability in log model evidence could be due to chance. Additionally, the three-level HGF model simulations captured the principal group differences in the behavioral effect of expectation on RT (Online Methods and Supplementary Fig. 7 ).\nPredicting diagnostic status.  A summary of group differences in each \nof the estimated model parameters is presented in Supplementary \nFigure 8 . A binary logistic regression model predicting group status \n(ASD = 1, NT = 0), with all eight model parameters as predictors was \nsignificant (\nχ2 = 26.83, P = 0.001), and the overall prediction success \nwas 81.6% (76% ASD, 88% NT), with cross-validated prediction success  \nof 68%. The Wald statistic demonstrated that outcome uncertainty ( β2,  \nP = 0.043), phasic volatility ( β4, P = 0.006) tonic volatility at the third \nlevel (ω3, P = 0.024) and baseline log RT ( β0, P = 0.007) made a significant  \ncontribution to prediction ( Fig. 4 b).\nInterestingly, these significant predictors predominantly per -\ntained to the third level of the HGF, i.e., learning about environ -\nmental volatility. ω3 can be understood as capturing ‘metavolatility’ \n(i.e., the tonic volatility of the phasic volatility, and the higher values \nin the ASD group indicated a belief in a world in which instabil -\nity itself is instable ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ). β4 captures the modu -\nlation of log RT in response to phasic volatility; here, the smaller (negative) values in the NT group ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ) indicated  \nthat when beliefs about volatility increased, participants became more attentive and responded faster. In contrast, the larger (positive) values in the ASD group ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ) indicated that increased \nbeliefs about volatility led to a slower reaction time. In general, these \nfindings indicated difficulties in representing and responding to \nenvironmental change in ASD, specifically an increased tendency to expect the unexpected.\nLearning-rate update in response to volatility.  From the HGF, we \ninferred the trialwise rate of learning about two different sources of \ninformation: probabilistic outcomes (\nα2) and the rate of learning \nabout environmental change ( α3). When the environment is vola -\ntile, people should give more weight to recent sensory outcomes in \nbuilding expectations about what they will see next (for example, \nadopt a high α); in contrast, they should give information from \nthe distant past more weight when the environment is stable (for example, adopt a low \nα)8,9. To test the hypothesis that individuals \nwith ASD have difficulties in flexibly updating their rate of learning (i.e., precision weighting) in response to environmental change, we \nexamined the change ( ∆) in \nα2 (probability) and α3 (environment) \nwhen switching from stable (violet in Fig. 1) to volatile (green in \nFig. 1) periods of the task. We compared the change in α2 and α3 \nbetween these two periods, across the groups. This analysis revealed \na trend toward a main effect of group ( F(1,47) = 0.26, P = 0.061), \na significant main effect of α type ( F(1,47) = 6.07, P = 0.017) and \ncrucially an α type × group interaction ( F(1,47) = 9.80), P = 0.003). \nFollow-up with independent-sample t tests revealed that the ASD \ngroup did not update α2 as much as the NT group ( t(47) = −2.37,  \nP = 0.02), whereas the ASD group updated α3 more than the NT \ngroup ( t(47) = 3.16, P = 0.03; Fig. 4 c).Average learning rates.  To examine learning overall, we calculated \naverage values for α2 and α3 for each participant. This analysis \nrevealed no main effect of α type ( F(1,47) = 2.61, P = 0.11), no main \neffect of group ( F(1,47) = 2.01, P = 0.16) and no group × α type  \ninteraction ( F(1,47) = 2.54, P = 0.12), thus suggesting that, in general, \nboth groups were able to learn this task equally well.\nPredicting learning-rate update from tonic volatility.  Finally, because \nthe HGF estimation does not fit α2 and α3 directly, we ran two linear \nregression models separately predicting ∆α2 and ∆α3 to determine which \nof the two ω parameters drove these differences in learning rate. In each \ncase, the model was significant ( ∆α2, F(2,48) = 68.94, P < 0.001, R2 = 0.75; \n∆α3, F(2,48) = 102.53, P < 0.001, R2 = 0.82). The results indicated that \n∆α2 was positively predicted by ω2 (t = 2.72, P = 0.009), thus suggesting \nthat a tendency to believe that cue–outcome associations were unstable \nwas associated with a larger update in ∆α2 when switching from stable \nto volatile phases of the task. Interestingly, ω3 negatively predicted ∆α2  \n(t = −8.89, P > 0.001), thus indicating that a tendency to believe that  \ninstability was unstable drove a smaller update in α2 in response to vola -\ntility. This result was consistent with our finding that the participants with ASD, who tended to have smaller ∆\nα2 (Fig. 4 c), showed reduced \nbehavioral surprise (Fig. 2 b) and also larger ‘metavolatility’ estimates \n(Fig. 4 b). For the model predicting ∆α3, both of the ω parameters were \nsignificant positive predictors ( ω2, t = 7.88, P < 0.001; ω3, t = 14.24,  \nP < 0.001). For the participants with ASD, who, on average, showed larger \n∆α3, this result was consistent with a tendency toward beliefs in the insta -\nbility of both cue–outcome associations and instability itself.\nPupillometry\nPredictive coding descriptions of ASD depart from normative Bayesian theories in that they make explicit predictions about the neurobio -\nlogical basis of precision, namely the action of neuromodulators \nsuch as NA, which control the gain on cortical responses (prediction \nerrors)\n3,4,6. Increased NA signaling in ASD has been suggested by \nelevated blood plasma levels34 and increased arousal, i.e., heart rate \nvariability35, but no studies have examined phasic NA function in the \ncontext of learning about uncertainty in ASD. To do so, we acquired concurrent pupillometry in a reduced subset of the sample (Online \nMethods). The phasic pupil response to surprising outcomes (ground \ntruth contrast of UE – E trials) revealed a significant increase in pupil size in NT participants ( Fig. 5 a), which was consistent with findings \nfrom many previous studies\n25. In agreement with the behavioral data \n(Fig. 2b ,d), the ASD group did not show this distinction between UE \nand E trials ( Fig. 5 a).

Here, the learning rate \nα3 depended on the precision weight on the PE and was propor -\ntional to the update of environmental volatility (Online Methods). \nAs such, ε3 is a model-based measure of high-level surprise that \nis formally related to the dynamic learning about environmental change, in which we observed group differences ( Fig. 4 c). Applying \nmultiple regression across every trial and every time point in the pupil time trace, we found a sustained positive relationship between pupil size and precision-weighted PEs (\nε3) in the participants with \nASD ( Fig. 5 b), and this relationship was significantly different from \nthat in the NT group and from zero. Furthermore, these strong \neffects persisted when we controlled for the UE – E ground-truth \ncontrast, trialwise differences in fixation compliance, mean RT and outcome image type (face/house), all of which were included in the model as covariates (Online Methods). Additional analyses \nrevealed that the volatility learning rate (\nα3) and the probability \nlearning rate ( α2) were not encoded in the pupil response in either \ngroup ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ; analysis examining the relationship \nbetween precision-weighted PEs in specific (volatile/stable) phases of the experiment in Supplementary Fig. 10 ).\nPupillometry control analyses.  Given the possibility that people with \nASD might look at face stimuli differently from people without ASD\n38, \nthe stimulus duration was purposefully made short (150 ms) to prevent \nsaccades. Nonetheless, to ensure that there were no differences between \nthe groups in fixation compliance across the stimulus types (faces and \nhouses), we conducted a repeated-measures ANOV A on the mean absolute deviation (MAD) from fixation (in degrees of visual angle) across outcome image type (face and house) with a between-subject \nfactor of group. All main effects and interactions in this analysis were \nnonsignificant ( Supplementary Table 1 ).\nTo examine group differences in tonic pupil size (thought to be a \nmeasure of general noradrenergic tone\n39), we compared the average of \nthe z-scored pupil measurement across all trials with an independent-  \nsamples t test. The results demonstrated no group differences in tonic \npupil size in this sample ( t(23) = 0.36, P = 0.72).\nFinally, control analyses revealed that there were no group dif -\nferences in fixation compliance across conditions ( Supplementary  \nFig. 11 ) or the relationship between pupil size and simple behavior, \nsuch as trialwise RT ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ). Raw pupil traces for \neach group are shown in Supplementary Figure 13 .\nDISCUSSIONIn this study, behavioral (RT/error rates) and pupillometric results \nbased on the experimental ground truth converged on the finding  \nof a decreased distinction between unexpected and expected \noutcomes in ASD ( Figs. 2 and 5a), in agreement with the results \nof many previous studies across a range of methods reporting \ndecreased surprise in ASD21,23,36,37. Crucially, however, this  \nlow-level notion of E and UE trials assumed optimal or at least adequate learning of the ground truth. However, the statistical \nregularities that underlie the sensory world and shape expectations \nare changeable, and humans must learn about different kinds of uncertainty to adaptively adjust the weighting of prior expectations and sensory inputs. Knowing whether to disregard an unexpected \noutcome or to take it seriously (i.e., whether to adopt a high or \nlow learning rate about cue–outcome probabilities (\nα2)) depends \non the precision of one’s beliefs about environmental change (i.e., whether a high or low learning rate about volatility (\nα3) is \nadopted). The present data extend previous work by specifically demonstrating that overestimating volatility in the face of environ -\nmental change—at the expense of learning about probabilistically aberrant events—characterizes the behavior of adults with ASD during perceptual inference ( Fig. 4 c).\nFurthermore, computational pupillometry analyses indicated \nheightened encoding of trialwise surprise in phasic noradrenergic responses in ASD ( Fig. 5 b). Thus, under the assumption that pupil \nsize is an index of NA release from the locus coruleus\n40, these results \nsuggested increased phasic neuromodulatory signaling in ASD.

Here, our computational pupillom -\netric analysis indicated a strong relationship between noradrenergic \nresponsivity and precision-weighted prediction errors in partici -\npants with ASD. In agreement with our other model-based results  \n(Fig. 4b ,c), these findings again supported over-reactivity to environ -\nmental change in ASD, but in the context of physiological measures \nthat index phasic neuromodulatory function. The NA system’s sign -\naling more high-level surprise in ASD may suggest atypical cortical \ngain during sensory processing, thus resulting in a state of dispro -\nportionate receptiveness to sensory inputs. Aberrant phasic NA (i.e., \nprecision on prediction errors4,6) may alter the signal-to-noise ratio \nof cortical responses41,42, broaden the tuning functions of sensory \nresponses and subsequently improve discrimination behavior43. Thus, \naberrant NA function may offer a neurobiological perspective on the profile of sensory-processing strengths and weakness experienced by \npeople on the spectrum.\nImportantly, these findings provide preliminary empirical evidence \nfor neurobiologically informed Bayesian accounts of autism that \nemphasize aberrant representation of volatility and consequently inap -\npropriate setting of gain (precision) on cortical responses (prediction errors)\n4,6 under conditions of uncertainty. A recent pharmacological \nstudy using the HGF has indicated that noradrenaline antagonism selectively impairs volatility learning\n13, in agreement with the raised \npupillometric response to surprise about volatility reported here in the adults with ASD ( Fig. 5 b). We hypothesize that the noradrenergic \nlocus coruleus and its coupling with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)\n8,10 ratifies estimated volatility and that the downstream gain \nmodulations act on the precision of cortical responses that are behav -\niorally relevant to the task at hand. Atypical social prediction error \nprocessing in the gyral surface of the ACC has recently been reported \nin autism44, but whether differences in processing in the ACC region \nextend to nonsocial tasks with explicit computational models and manipulations of volatility remains to be seen. Carefully designed \nneuroimaging and neuropharmacology studies will be necessary to \nlink these (presumed) noradrenergic effects, and the mathematical anatomy of uncertainty\n11, to hierarchical processing in the brain12. Additionally, although we emphasize the role of noradrenaline here, we also acknowledge the likely importance of its direct precursor, dopamine, and the complementary relationship with acetylcholine and the signaling of expected uncertainty\n15. All three of these neuro -\nmodulators are likely candidates in the neurobiological mechanisms underlying responses to environmental change in ASD.\nFrom a Bayesian perspective, the simplest way in which persistent \noverweighting of all sensory inputs (relative to prior expectations) might occur would be a generally larger outcome \nα, reflecting chronic \nand inflexible overweighting of recent, relative to past, sensory his -\ntory. Such an explanation is implied by conservative interpretations \nof nonhierarchical Bayesian accounts of ASD2 and predictive process -\ning accounts that emphasize ‘uniform’ inflexibly high precision in \nsensory processing3. However, by logical extension, beyond a single \nambiguous sensory event, all Bayesian accounts suggest that dynamic learning about structural regularities (i.e., the formation of priors) \nis probably compromised in ASD\n2–7. Under the aberrant precision \naccount of ASD, problems with processing volatility under condi -\ntions of sensory ambiguity are hypothesized to underlie the difficul -\nties faced by people on the spectrum4–6. For this reason, we designed a \ntask to capture behavior under orthogonal manipulations of expecta -\ntions and sensory noise and built a model equipped with the ability \nto reveal learning about volatility.\nThe recent proposal that nonhierarchical reinforcement-learning \nmodels can directly address predictive coding theories of ASD3 is per -\nhaps too simplistic, not least because predictive coding is largely regarded \nas a neural-process theory, and therefore behavioral or modeling results \nin the absence of a proxy for brain function can only speak to such an \naccount but are not truly able to test it. Motivated by these claims, a rela-tively recent study has found no differences in learning-rate malleability in autistic children during a reward-learning task modeled with a delta \nlearning rule\n45. Notably, however, that study found no group differences \nin simple behavior in that task. Here, we made a specific behavioral pre -\ndiction on the basis of previous research (reduced surprise in ASD) and a specific computational prediction to explain this behavior (aberrant \nlearning about volatility). We therefore designed a model sufficiently complex to address simultaneous hierarchical learning. Using Bayesian-model comparison, we found ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ) that the simplest \nlearning model (similar to that used previously in the context of reward learning\n45) performs most poorly in explaining participant behavior. \nNonetheless, if it is the case that learning in the face of volatility is com -\npromised in adults with autism (as reported here under conditions of \nsensory noise) but not children (as indicated previously in the context \nof reward learning45), this would be an important discovery. It will be \ncrucial for future studies to use the same computational models and behavioral paradigms in adults and children to inform understanding of \nhow autism affects cognition across the lifespan, especially because some \nfeatures of the disorder can become more severe with age\n46.\nConclusion\nThe surprise that you might experience after finding a pineapple in \nyour sock drawer depends on the strength of your prior expectation to see socks. The results of this study suggest that adults with autism show a tendency to overestimate the volatility of the sensory environ -\nment, at the expense of learning to build stable expectations that lead to adaptive surprise. In other words, adults with autism may be mildly surprised by both the pineapple and the socks. Heightened encoding of prediction errors in pupil-size measures is consistent with neurobio -\nlogically focused Bayesian accounts of autism that emphasize neural-  \ngain impairments due to aberrant neuromodulatory funcion\n4–6.

Two adults with ASD did not complete this test, owing to time \nconstraints or an inability to tolerate the sounds and/or to focus adequately \non the test. After data examination, participants with more than 20% over -\nall errors or mean reaction times (RTs) >2 s.d. from their respective group-\nmean RT were excluded from subsequent analysis to ensure the validity \nof the Bayesian modeling, thus yielding 24 participants in the ASD group  \n(18 males and 6 females; mean age, 35.5 years; age range, 20–61 years) and 25 participants in the NT group (16 males and 9 females; mean age, 36 years; age range, 19–62 years). The ASD and NT groups were matched according to age ( t(47) = 0.54, P = 0.87).\nParticipants with ASD had previously been diagnosed by an independent clini -\ncian, according to the DSM-IV\n51 or ICD-10 criteria52 (19 with Asperger syndrome; \n3 with autistic disorder; 1 with high-functioning autism; and 1 with atypical autism). The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (W AIS, third edition, UK) had previously \nbeen administered to assess IQ\n53, and participants were matched on the basis of \nfull-scale scores (ASD mean, 117; ASD range, 80–142; NT mean, 120; NT range, \n99–145; t(47) = −0.93, P = 0.36). The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule \n(second edition)54 assessment was completed by a qualified administrator to assess \nsymptom severity in the participants with ASD. The mean ADOS total score was \n9.9 (range 4–19). The mean scores for the communication and reciprocal social \ninteraction subscores were 3.3 (range, 0–7) and 6.6 (range, 4–12), respectively.\nAn additional 57 NT volunteers were studied as part of a replication of our \nkey behavioral results (25 males and 32 females; mean age, 27.1 years; age range, \n19–50 years) and additionally completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) \nquestionnaire, a 50-item self-reported measure of autism traits32,55. The mean AQ \nscore was 18.43 (median, 17; range, 5–45). All participants had normal or cor -\nrected-to-normal vision and provided written informed consent. We performed a median split on the data, such that participants were divided into high-AQ  \n(n = 26) and low-AQ ( n = 31) groups. The AQ score was significantly higher in the \nhigh-AQ group (mean, 27; s.d., 6.4; range, 18–45) relative to the low-AQ group (mean, 11.5; s.d., 3.4; range, 5–17; t(55) = 11.28, P < 0.001). The distribution \nof scores in the low-AQ group was almost exclusively below the mean range of \nneurotypical scores reported in a recent meta-analysis of 73 studies administering \nthe AQ\n56. Importantly there was considerable overlap between the scores in the \nhigh-AQ group and the range reported, on average, for those with a diagnosis of ASD\n56, even though these participants do not present with any clinical need.\nNo randomization was used to assign subjects or conditions. All participants \nprovided written informed consent and were compensated financially for their \ntime and travel expenses. The study was approved by the UCL Graduate School \nEthics Committee (4357/001).\nStimuli. Auditory cues were either 330-Hz or 660-Hz pure tones generated in \nMATLAB R2012b (Mathworks) and presented with the Cogent toolbox ( http: //\nwww.vislab.ucl.ac. uk/cogent_graphics.p hp/), via Sennheiser HD 201 headphones. \nOutcome images were either faces or houses. These stimuli were grayscale and comprised six different face identities (three male and female) or six different images of houses, masked by an ellipse and luminance matched with the SHINE toolbox\n57. Either medium or high Gaussian noise, with a mean of zero and a \nvariance of 0.05 and 0.1, respectively, was added to outcome images by using \nthe image processing toolbox (MATLAB R2012b). Example stimuli can be see \nin Figure 1. The face in this image shows the likeness of author R.P .L. The actual \nstimuli used in the experiment were taken from the Nim Stim Face Identity Set (http://www .macbrain.org/resources.ht m).\nProcedure.  Participants sat on a chair with their heads in a chin rest at a viewing \ndistance of 80 cm. An example trial can be seen in Figure 1. Each trial began \nwith the 300-ms presentation of a pure tone that was either high or low in pitch. After 200 ms, either a face or a house image was presented for 150 ms, to prevent \nsaccades. The participants were told simply to respond to the image and indicate \nwhether it was a face or a house (via left/right button press), and to be ‘as fast and \naccurate as possible, trying to respond on every trial’ . A variable response time \nof 1,500–1,800 ms followed the image, such that trials lasted 1,950–2,250 ms.  \nParticipants were instructed that the tone preceding each image was probabil -\nistically associated with the likelihood of seeing a face or house and that these probabilities would change over time. The probabilistic associations between \nthe tones and the outcomes were highly predictive (\nP = 0.84), weakly predictive  \n(P = 0.16) or nonpredictive ( P = 0.5), and changed pseudorandomly across trials \nin blocks of 12, 36 or 72 trials ( Fig. 1). All participants completed 456 trials over \neight miniblocks with optional periods of rest between.\nTo ensure that participants’ responses were not biased by learned expectations \nabout the relative frequencies of the visual stimuli, the task was designed such that \nthe marginal probabilities of faces and houses were identical at any point in time \n(Fig. 1), and each block contained equal numbers of randomly intermixed high- \nand low-tone trials. As with designs of previous studies12,24, our design ensured \nthat the a priori probability of a face (or house) occurring was always 50% in any \ngiven trial, before the tone was presented. Thus, any expectations about the visual \nstimulus could depend on only the preceding tone. Additionally, and uniquely to \nthis study, equal numbers of high-, medium- and no-noise stimuli appeared in \neach of 12, 36 or 72 blocks of trials and across each cue type.\nData collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of \nthe experiment.\nPupillometry.  To ensure fixation and to measure neuromodulatory responses, \ngaze direction and pupil size were measured with an infrared eye tracker \n(Cambridge Research Systems) tracking the left eye at 200 Hz. Calibration \nof the eye tracker was unsuccessful in all participants wearing glasses, and  \nthe eye tracker suffered a fatal technical failure before testing was completed; \ntherefore, eye-tracking data are available for only 14 NT subjects and 11 subjects \nwith ASD.\nHierarchical gaussian filter.  In the version of the HGF used here (introduced in \nref. 33), learning occurs simultaneously on three coupled levels of an uncertainty \nhierarchy. The first level of the HGF ( x1) constitutes the outcome of any given \ntrial (for example, face or house), the second level ( x2) represents the probabilistic \nassociations between the tones and the outcomes (for example, the probability of \nseeing a house given that a high tone has just been heard), and the third level ( x3) \nquantifies the volatility of the probabilities (for example, the changeability of the \nenvironment). In each trial, the model provides an estimate for each level, before \nthe outcome is seen, and the estimate updated accordingly. Predictions at each \nlevel are represented by a Gaussian distribution, described by its mean ˆmi, and \nvariance ˆsi. The variance ˆsi represents the uncertainty of the estimate at each \nlevel. Updates of beliefs at each level occur via prediction errors that propagate \nupward and are precision weighted according to the ratio of the uncertainty of \nthe level that generated them to the uncertainty of the level being updated. The \nmanipulation of perceptual noise (for example, no, medium or high noise) is \ncaptured trial by trial as a fixed parameter representing the variance of the noise \non the inputs.\nFor each participant, the perceptual-model parameters ω2 and ω3, the learn -\ning rates α2 and α3, and the response model parameters ( β0,…,4 ) were estimated \nfrom the trialwise log RT measures by using variational Bayes, as implemented \nin the HGF toolbox ( http://www.tr anslationalneuromode ling.org/tapas /). The \nω values are the tonic log volatilities at their respective levels, according to the \ngenerative model \nx s xt t\n1 2()( )() ~( )Bernoulli\nx x xt t t\n2 21\n3 2() −()()+( )( )   N~ , exp w\nx xt t\n3 31\n3() −()( )( )    N~ , exp w\nwith s x xt t\n2 21 1( ) ( ): / exp( ) + −( )( ) = . Thus, the basic step size of the random walks \nin x2 and x3 is determined without taking into account phasic modulation by \nhigher levels of the hierarchy.

This parameter is the irre -\nducible uncertainty associated with any kind of probabilistic prediction, which is \nreferred to as risk in the economics literature. Uncertainty at the second level is \nthe posterior variance σ2 of the belief on x2, expressed at the outcome level (hence \nthe multiplication with the derivative of s taken at the current mean µ2 of the \nbelief on x2; details on this transformation to the first level have been described \nin the supplementary material of ref. 12. This parameter is the informational \nuncertainty, so called because it quantifies the lack of information about the quantity (here x2) governing outcome probabilities. Volatility is the exponential \nof the phasic log volatility µ3, which is also expressed at the outcome level.\nThe choice of these models was hypothesis driven. The reason for choosing \nthe HGF as the learning model was twofold. First, because it reflects the hier -\narchical nature of changing environments in that it allows for volatility that is \nitself volatile, this model allowed us to test the hypothesis that participants with \nASD differ from NT participants in how they address a hierarchy of uncertain -\nties and specifically address learning about volatility. The response model was \nchosen because the log RTs followed an approximately Gaussian distribution, \nand a linear model allowed for the straightforward identification of the effects \nof all hypothesized modulating factors.\nThere were several reasons that we chose to fit reaction time over trialwise \nerrors. First, reaction times are a sensitive behavioral-response measure that can have a range of values across trials, from fast to slow, and that empirically have \nbeen shown to vary with the uncertainty of participant responses in both detec -\ntion and discrimination experiments\n58. Second, reaction times have previously \nbeen used in the application of Bayesian learning models to behavioral tasks \nvery similar to ours, so modeling RT here increased the comparability across \nstudies24,59. Third, error rates were very low in this study (~3% overall), and \nany logistic model attempting to explain such a small incidence of states coded as 1 (relative to 0) would require more trials than were performed in this study (increasing as a function of the explanatory variables in the model\n60). Fourth (and \nmost pragmatically), some participants did not make any errors at all, so modeling \nRT maximized the number of participants included in the analysis. Finally, the \ngroup × probability interaction for percentage errors was not significant in our \nhigh- and low-AQ replication ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ,d), and so in modeling RT, \nwe modeled the effect most comparable across both experiments in this work.\nSample size.  In our NT participants, we sought a conceptual replication of the \nstudy by Den Ouden et al.24, albeit with a modified design. We calculated a mini -\nmum sample size a priori on the basis of the low-probability minus high-probabil -\nity RT difference previously reported (32 ms) and an assumed variance (actual s.d. \nnot reported) of the same. This analysis indicated that we would need a minimum \nof 14 participants to achieve 95% power to detect a similar ( α = 0.05; two tailed) \neffect in the NT group. Given that initial effect sizes are often inflated61 and that we \nsought power to detect a difference between two groups, we doubled this estimate \nand aimed to test ~28 participants in each group, with some attrition expected.\nBecause there is no prior precedent for detecting between-group differences \nin this specific task, we additionally assessed the required sample size to detect \na medium effect size for a between-subject ANOV A with three levels and a \nbetween-subject factor of group. The results indicated that a total sample size \nof 48 participants would be necessary to have at least 90% power to detect an \nF-test effect size of 0.25.\nFor the pupil-size regression, in which it was not possible to calculate power \na priori, the sample sizes and effect sizes ( β values) reported for this particu -\nlar analysis were in line with those reported in previous studies using the same  \nmethods9. Post hoc  power calculations indicated that with 11 participants with \nASD included in the actual analysis, we had 86% power to detect the mean positive \nβ (slope = 0.72) that we observed in these participants ( α = 0.05; two tailed).\nStatistics.  Behavioral data.  All statistical analyses of behavioral data were per -\nformed in MATLAB (Mathworks) and PASW Statistics 22 (SPSS/IBM). For the \nanalysis of RTs, responses that were too fast or too slow (<100 or >1,000 ms) were \nexcluded, and, including missing responses, there was no significant difference \nbetween the groups in the overall percentage of missing data (1.9% ASD, 2.3% \nNT, t(47) = 0.45, P = 0.65). To maximize the trial numbers per condition, we col -\nlapsed across face/house trials and, for correct trials only, subjected RTs to a mixed \nANOV A with within-subject factors of expectedness (UE, N and E) and stimulus \nnoise (high, medium and no noise), and a between-subject factor of group. We \nalso quantified a behavioral measure of surprise, defined as the difference in RT \nbetween UE and E outcomes, on the basis of the ground truth, and compared this \nmeasure between the groups by using independent-sample t tests. An equivalent \nanalysis was conducted for error rates and log transforms of both these measures. \nPercentage errors were calculated for each condition separately. Data distributions \nwere assumed to be normal, but this assumption was not formally tested. When \nassumptions of heterogeneity of covariance were violated, the number of degrees \nof freedom was corrected with the Greenhouse–Geisser approach.\n© 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

All statistical analyses of eye-tracking data were performed \nin MATLAB (Mathworks) Only trials in which 80% or more of the samples were  \nsuccessfully tracked were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference  \nin the mean number of included trials between the groups (mean good trials  \nASD = 298; NT = 261; t(23) = 0.803, P = 0.43). For pupil data, blinks were treated \nwith linear interpolation, and the resulting pupil traces were low-pass-filtered and \nsmoothed according to the conventions outlined in ref. 62. To explore phasic pupil \nresponses for correct trials, traces were baseline corrected to the average response \nduring the 500 ms preceding the outcome image. T onic pupil responses were deter -\nmined as the average of the z-scored pupil measurement across all trials. z-scoring \naccounts for individual differences in baseline pupil size and has previously been \nused in the literature63,64. The MAD from fixation (in degrees of visual angle) across \ngroups and conditions was used to assess fixation compliance in each trial65.\nRegression analyses were conducted to examine the effects of surprise on the \nbasis of the ground truth and volatility surprise ( ε3, trialwise precision-weighted \nprediction errors) on pupil dilation after outcome presentation. A similar approach \nhas been used in recent studies examining the relationship between pupil dilation \nand computational-model parameters that vary across trials9. The postoutcome \nperiod for each trial was sampled with 370 5-ms bins. Regression analyses were  \nconducted for each individual time bin, with HGF estimates of precision-\nweighted prediction errors ( ε3) and the ground-truth contrast of unexpected (1) \nminus expected (–1) included as regressors of interest, and the trial type (0 = face,  \n1 = house), fixation compliance (MAD) and RT for each trial entered as control \nregressors. The resultant time series of β weights (in other words, multiple regres -\nsion conducted at every time point) provided estimates of the effects of ground-\ntruth surprise and volatility surprise on the basis of pupil dilation across all trials.\nAt the group level, we then conducted t tests for the positive or negative effects \nof the regressors of interest, and the independent-samples difference between \ngroups, corrected for multiple comparisons with a cluster-based permutation \napproach at 2,000 permutations (FWE α = 0.05, two tailed)66. This procedure \nallowed us to assess when our surprise metrics were significantly encoded in the pupil time series. This approach protected against false positives across correlated \nmeasurements (i.e., it maximized temporal sensitivity).\nLearning-rate data.  To test the hypothesis that individuals with ASD have dif -\nficulties in flexibly updating their rate of learning (precision weighting) in response to environmental change, we examined the change ( ∆) in \nα2 (probability) and α3 \n(environment) during switching from stable to volatile periods of the task. W e used \nthe dynamic α trajectories estimated on the basis of all trials, but specifically inter -\nrogated a period of 72 trials (green in Fig. 1) in which the probabilistic association \nbetween tones and outcomes remained fixed and was followed by a period of 72 \ntrials (violet in Fig. 1) in which the outcome probabilities switched three times. \nWe compared the change in average α2 and α3 between these two periods, across \nthe groups. Previous studies have examined learning about how reward probability changes in response to volatility in NT volunteers\n8,10 and also in aversive environ -\nments9. In these studies, the participant responses were fit with a simple delta \nlearning rule (i.e., Rescorla–W agner67) separately in volatile and stable task phases, \nthereby annulling the elegance of the generative-model approach by imposing knowledge of the task structure. In contrast, we fit subject RTs across all 456 trials \nby using the HGF , and the two learning rates (\nα2 and α3) dynamically varied as a \nfunction of each participant’s inferred beliefs about cue–outcome informativeness \nand changes in these associations over time. Whereas simpler models approximate participant outcome probability estimates, assuming that the participants are ‘ideal’ \nBayesian observers, the HGF addresses what kind of Bayesian observer each par -\nticipant actually is, thus making this method a more sensitive means of capturing \nindividual differences in learning about uncertainty (additional information can be found in the ‘HGF model validation’ section; comparisons between the HGF \nand simpler reinforcement learning models can be found in Fig. 3 c).\nBayesian-model selection.  To disambiguate alternative explanations (models) \nfor the participants’ behavior, we used BMS. BMS evaluates the relative plausibil -\nity of competing models in terms of their log evidences, quantifying the tradeoff \nbetween the accuracy (fit) and complexity of a model. Here, we used a recently \nupdated random-effect BMS method to account for potential interindividual \nvariability in our sample, quantifying the protected posterior probabilities of \nfour competing models\n68. The protected exceedance probabilities quantify the \nprobability that any one model is more frequent than the others and also accounts \nfor the possibility that the observed variability in (log) model evidences could \nbe due to chance68.Regression analyses.  To examine the relationship between the primary behav -\nioral measure of surprise (UE – E RT) and the severity of autism symptoms, we \nconducted a multiple linear regression with ADOS-2 scores for communication \nand reciprocal social interaction, and IQ as predictors. A secondary regression \nmodel was also conducted in which a sensory sensitivity score (as measured on \nthe basis of the adult sensory questionnaire69) was also included as a predictor. \nSensory scores were available for only 21 of 24 participants with ASD; therefore, \nthis analysis was conducted with a reduced sample size. In response to a reviewer request, we also conducted a third regression to predict UE – E RT that included \nbaseline RT as an additional predictor. Because both communication scores  \n(r = −0.421, P = 0.04) and mean RT ( r = −0.341, P = 0.017) correlated with the \nUE – E RT difference in the participants with ASD, we created centered versions of these variables and their interaction effect in the regression model.\nTo assess the validity of the HGF-model parameters in predicting group status \n(ASD = 1, NT = 0) we conducted binary logistic regression (method = enter) in \nSPSS. The predictor variables in this analysis were the eight free parameters esti -\nmated by the HGF , namely the five response-model \nβ values (β0…4 plus decision \nnoise (ζ) and the two omega parameters from the perceptual model ( ω2 and ω3). \nAdditionally, we recreated this analysis in R and used the cv.glm function in the boot package to perform leave-one-out cross-validation.\nA Life Sciences Reporting Summary  for this paper is available.\nCode availability.

We calculated a minimum sample size a priori on the basis of the low probability minus high probability RT difference that they report (32 ms) and an assumed variance (actual SD not reported) of the same.

Data exclusions\nDescribe any data exclusions. Two adults with ASD did not complete this test owing to time constraints or an \ninability to tolerate the sounds and/or focus adequately on the test. Following data examination, participants with more than 20% overall errors or mean reaction times (RT’s) > 2 standard deviations from their respective group mean RT were excluded from subsequent analysis to ensure the validity of the Bayesian modeling\n3.   Replication\nDescribe whether the experimental findings were reliably reproduced.We replicated our primary behavioral results in a separate group of neurotypical \nvolunteers (n=57) characterized according to high and low autistic traits. The results of this replication are presented in Supplemental Figure S4.\n4.   Randomization\nDescribe how samples/organisms/participants were allocated into experimental groups.No randomization was used to assign subjects or conditions. \n5.   Blinding\nDescribe whether the investigators were blinded to \ngroup allocation during data collection and/or analysis.Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the \nexperiment.\nNote: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were us ed."

Description of human research participants\nDescribe the covariate-relevant population \ncharacteristics of the human research participants.29 adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 26 neurotypical volunteers \n(NTs) came to the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience as part of a testing day involving different researchers. Two adults with ASD did not complete this test owing to time constraints or an inability to tolerate the sounds and/or focus adequately on the test. Following data examination, participants with more than 20% overall errors or mean reaction times (RT’s) > 2 standard deviations from their respective group mean RT were excluded from subsequent analysis to ensure the validity of the Bayesian modelling. This left 24 participants in the ASD group (18 males; mean age: 35.5, age range: 20-61) and 25 in the NT group (16 males; mean age: 36, age range: 19-62). The ASD and NT groups were matched on age (t(47)=0.54, P=0.87).  ASD participants had previously been diagnosed by an independent clinician, according to the DSM-IV51 or ICD-10 criteria52 [19 Asperger Syndrome, 3 Autistic Disorder, 1 High Functioning Autism, 1 Atypical Autism]. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS 3rd edition UK) had previously been administered to assess IQ 53 and participants were matched on full-scale scores (ASD mean: 117; range: 80-142; NT mean: 120, range: 99-145; t(47)=-0.93, P=0.36) The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (2nd edition) 54 assessment was completed by a qualified administrator to assess symptom severity in the ASD participants. Mean ADOS total score was 9.9 (range 4-19). The mean scores for the communication and reciprocal social interaction sub scores were 3.3 (range: 0-7) and 6.6 (range 4-12), respectively.  An additional 57 NTs were studied as part of a replication of our key behavioural result (25 male, 32 female; mean age: 27.1, age range: 19–50) and additionally completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) questionnaire; a 50-item self-report measure of autistic traits 32,55. Mean AQ score was 18.43 (median: 17, range: 5-45). All participants had normal or corrected to normal vision and gave written informed consent. We performed a median split on the data such that participants were divided into high AQ (n=26) and low AQ (n=31) groups. AQ score was significantly higher in the in the high AQ group (mean=27, SD=6.4, range=18-45), relative to the low AQ group (mean=11.5, SD=3.4, range=5-17; t (55) = 11.28, P<0.001). The distribution of scores the low AQ group falls almost exclusively below the mean range of neurotypical scores reported in a recent meta-analysis of 73 studies administering the AQ 56. Importantly there is considerable overlap between the scores in the high AQ group and the range reported, on average, in those with a diagnosis of ASD 56 – even though these participants do not present with any clinical need.  No randomisation was used to assign subjects or conditions. All participants provided written informed consent and were compensated financially for their time and travel expenses. The study was approved by the UCL Graduate School Ethics Committee (4357/001)"
