Decreased sound \ntolerance is more prevalent in certain neurodevelopmental disorders \n(e.g. autism spectrum disorder; Ren et al., 2021 ; Williams, et al. \n2021 ) even where there is no reason to suspect audiological prob -\nlems as a root cause, and decreased sound tolerance may also be \ncomorbid with psychological problems (e.g. anxiety), which poten -\ntially have an exacerbating effect (e.g. Andermane et al., 2023a ).\nThe term ‘hyperacusis’ has historically been used as a general \numbrella term to denote lower tolerance to sounds, across multiple \npossible aetiologies. Patients with hyperacusis typically report \neveryday sounds as feeling too loud, and when presented with \npure tones, judge them to be uncomfortable at a lower loudness \nlevel than people without hyperacusis (Aazh and Moore 2017 ). \nICD-10 describes hyperacusis as ‘an abnormally disproportionate \nincrease in the sensation of loudness in response to auditory stim -\nuli of normal volume.’ (World Health Organization 1993 ). Some \npeople with hyperacusis also report that sounds induce pain, \nalthough this is neither a universal nor defining characteristic \n(Williams, Suzman, and Woynaroski 2021 ). Questionnaires such \nas the Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ) have been developed as a \nself-report measure of the symptomatology of sound tolerance and the extent to which sound intolerance affects daily living, as an \nindicator of clinical severity (Khalfa et al. 2002 ). Despite the name, \nhowever, we suggest that the HQ should today be considered as a \nmeasure of a mixed class of sound intolerances, including – but \ncrucially not limited to – hyperacusis. We show how the HQ \nassesses both hyperacusis and another condition, misophonia, and \nsuggest this has arisen simply from a historical shift in the seman -\ntic boundaries of the word ‘hyperacusis’.\nThere has been significant recent interest in the idea that \ndecreased sound tolerance can be subdivided into distinct types, \nsuch that the term hyperacusis has recently come to be restricted \nto one profile with a second profile (misophonia) alongside \n(Swedo et al. 2022 ). Notably, Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2002 ) pro-\nposed the term misophonia to denote decreased tolerance to spe-\ncific trigger sounds, largely eating sounds such as chewing and \nrepetitive sounds such as tapping. In this conceptualisation, hyper -\nacusis is essentially the residual sounds outside this category, \nmuch broader in nature, but largely sounds with high amplitude \nor frequency, and easily construed as ‘too loud’. A recent Delphi \nconsensus definition of misophonia described it as ‘a disorder of \ndecreased tolerance to specific sounds or stimuli associated with \nsuch sounds. These stimuli, known as “triggers”, are experienced \nas unpleasant or distressing and tend to evoke strong negative \nemotional, physiological, and behavioural responses that are not \nseen in most other people. Misophonic responses do not seem to \nbe elicited by the loudness of auditory stimuli, but rather by the \nspecific pattern or meaning to an individual.’ (Swedo et al. 2022 ). \nCONTACT Jamie Ward \n jamiew@sussex.ac.uk \n School of Psychology, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton, BN1 9QH, UK \nSupplemental data for this article can be accessed online at https://doi.org/10.1080/14992027.2024.2419558. \nß!2024 The Author(s).

      "text": "Several questionnaires have been developed to diagnose misopho -\nnia (Rosenthal et al. 2021 ; Simner, Rinaldi, and Ward 2024 ; Wu \net al. 2014 ). However, the extent to which they may also assess \nhyperacusis is unknown. Similarly, measures such as the HQ \n(Hyperacusis Questionnaire) were developed before the concept of \nmisophonia became accepted and it is uncertain whether the HQ \nassess hyperacusis as a distinct entity in the more recent sense, or \nwhether it assesses a generic sound intolerance (akin to the more \nhistorical interpretation of the term). A recent scoping definition \nof hyperacusis in its contemporary restrictive sense, formed by \nreviewing the extant literature, defined it as ‘everyday sounds feel \noverwhelming, loud, intense, or painful that do not bother other \npeople in the same way’ (Fackrell et al. 2017 ). In the present study, \nthis definition served as a ‘ground truth’ with which to assess the \nperformance of other measures. But it is worth noting that a \nDelphi consensus definition of hyperacusis provided a much \nbroader conceptualisation: ‘A reduced tolerance to sound(s) that \nare perceived as normal to the majority of the population or were \nperceived as normal to the person before their onset of hyperacu -\nsis’ (Adams et al. 2021 ). This consensus definition, produced \namongst clinicians, is similar to its historical meaning and does \nnot straightforwardly capture a distinction between hyperacusis \nand misophonia.\nThe aim of our study was to take a measure of misophonia \n(the Sussex Misophonia Scale, SMS; Simner, Rinaldi, and Ward \n2024 ) and a measure of hyperacusis (based on the scoping review \ndefinition) and to determine the extent to which other measures \n(such as the HQ) differentially assess hyperacusis or misophonia. \nOur sample was recruited from a previous study of participants \nwith misophonia with a range of severities, who were also asked \nabout hyperacusis (reporting it to various degrees based on the \nscoping review definition). To pre-empt our findings, we show \nthat some items on the HQ are indicative of misophonia severity \nand others of hyperacusis. Similarly, some trigger sounds are \nmore indicative of misophonia (e.g., swallowing, chewing) and \nothers are more indicative of hyperacusis (e.g. barking). These \ndouble dissociations across several measures provide compelling \nevidence that these two clinical constructs have distinct features.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants with complete datasets comprised 119 adults aged 18- \n70years (mean age 44.8, S.D. 14.3; 79.0% female, 18.5% male, \n2.5% non-binary). All had self-identified as having misophonia \nand had been recruited and tested for misophonia as part of previ -\nous research (Andermane et al., 2023a ), as detailed below. \nSpecifically, they had joined our participant pool following a BBC \nradio interview on misophonia was aired on May 18, 2021, during \nwhich listeners were invited to contact us. All participants agreed \nthat the following statement applied to them ‘Misophonia: When \nsounds (e.g. crunching) consistently cause extreme emotions \nlike anger or disgust which does not bother other people in the \nsame way.’ They were heterogeneous in terms of severity of miso -\nphonia as indicated by the total score on the SMS (mean 83.7, \nS.D. 23.1, range 37-139) where a score of F50.5 is an opti-\nmised cut-off for binary classification (Simner, Rinaldi, and Ward \n2024 ). For the hyperacusis screener (see below), 47% (66/119) of \nour sample reported that this applied to them (N26 ‘definitely \ndoes apply’, N40 ‘may apply’, N27 ‘don’t think it applies’, \nN26 ‘definitely does not apply’). The participants did not under -\ntake an audiological assessment but they were required to indicate that they had no known hearing loss as this was an exclusion cri-\nterion for the study.\nThe study was approved by the Sciences and Technology \nCross-Schools Research Ethics and Governance Committee of \nthe University of Sussex (reference: ER/JAMIEW/32).\nMaterials and procedure\nOur initial assessment of misophonic participants used the \nSussex Misophonia Scale, SMS, and a hyperacusis screener (see \nAndermane et al. 2023a ). This latter was based on the definition \nof hyperacusis arising from the scoping review: ‘Hyperacusis: \nWhen everyday sounds feel overwhelming, loud, intense, or \npainful that do not bother other people in the same way’. \nParticipants indicated their level of agreement with this state -\nment on a four-point Likert scale (‘This definitely does NOT \napply to me’, ‘I don’t think this applies to me’, ‘This may apply \nto me’, ‘This definitely DOES apply to me’). The SMS is a two- \npart questionnaire, firstly presenting 48 specific triggers for miso -\nphonia (e.g. chewing sounds) with a checkbox judgement and, \nsecondly, 39 Likert-type questions about the associated experien -\nces of people with misophonia (e.g., feelings, behaviours, life \nconsequences) (Simner, Rinaldi, and Ward 2024 ). The 48 poten -\ntial triggers for misophonia are grouped into eight categories \n(e.g. ‘I hate … the sound of people eating’) followed by sub-cat -\negory items (e.g. ‘crunchy foods (e.g. apples)’, ‘crispy snacks’, \n‘chewing’ etc.). In creating the SMS, three sounds that were ini-\ntially included (‘car engines’, ‘house and car alarms’, and ‘sirens \n(e.g. ambulance)’) were discarded as they were assumed to reflect \nhyperacusis. Here we test that assumption because the current \nparticipants had these extra items included. The 39 Likert-type \nitems (e.g. ‘I avoid going to work because of difficulties with \nsounds’) are rated on a five-point Likert scale and coded from \n0–4 (Never, Hardly Ever, Sometimes, Often, Always), with the \ntotal score ranging from 0–156. Simner, Rinaldi, and Ward \n(2024 ) showed that a cut-off value of 50.5 on the SMS has \n‘excellent’ discriminative ability between misophonics and non- \nmisophonics (area-under-curve, AUC 0.91). The SMS also has \nstrong convergent validity, with scores being correlated with \nthose for other misophonia questionnaires such as the MQ \n(r0.78), DVMSQ (r0.85), and AMISO-S (r0.81) – see \nSupplementary Material.\nTwo further questionnaires relating to hyperacusis were \nadministered 18months later, using Qualtrics (Provo, UT) and \ntaking around 30minutes to complete. The 18month time lag \nmeans that any association between our initial assessment of \nhyperacusis and misophonia and these later measures presum -\nably reflects enduring traits. Both later measures purport to \nmeasure hyperacusis. However, the first (HQ; Khalfa et al. 2002 ) \nwas created before the narrowing of its definition. The HQ con-\nsists of 14 items answered on a four-point Likert scale (No, Yes \na little, Yes quite a lot, Yes a lot) and the individual items are \nshown in Table 1. Total scores are calculated by summing across \nitems (coded from 1 to 4) although here we also analyse at the \nitem level. We also used relevant items from a second, more \nrecent hyperacusis questionnaire. The CORDS (Coordination of \nRare Diseases at Sanford) hyperacusis questionnaire, reported by \nWilliams et al. (2021 ), contains various items related to hyper -\nacusis and loud sound exposure. There is no known way of col-\nlapsing items (e.g. into factors or total scores) and so we analyse \nthem separately. The following items were used noting that we \nchanged the subject from ‘the participant’ to ‘you’ (e.g. the word -\ning of the original question was ‘Are everyday sounds unbearably 2\n R.

In our case, we are comparing the correlations between \nitems on the hyperacusis measures (HQ, CORDS) against the \nSMS (r12) and hyperacusis screener (r13), where r23 is the correl -\nation between SMS total and hyperacusis screener itself. The t- \nand p-values were obtained using the Excel calculator of Zaiontz \n(2014 ), shared in Supplementary Material, and can also be \nobtained in R using the r.test function in the Psych package \n(Revelle 2017 ).\nResults\nWe remind the reader that our participants were all self-declared \nmisophonics, additionally screened by the SMS (misophonia \nscale), a hyperacusis screener (based on the scoping definition), \nand two other measures of hyperacusis (HQ; CORDS).\nOverall HQ\nThe mean HQ total score for our misophonic group was 24.3 (± \n7.2) which compares against published population norms of 15.0 \n(± 6.7) from Khalfa et al. (2002 ). This corresponds to a signifi -\ncant difference (t11.67, p D.001) and a large effect size \n(Hedge’s g1.35). Using Khalfa et al.’s (2002 ) threshold (F28 \nscore): 30% of our misophonic sample would be classified as \nhaving hyperacusis (36/119), if we were to base this classification \nsolely on the HQ. Applying Meeus et al.’s (2010 ) slightly more \nlenient threshold (F26 score) would raise the percentage classi -\nfied as having hyperacusis to 39.5% (47/119). The correlation \nbetween the HQ total and the SMS total was a moderate and sig-\nnificant (r0.49, p D.001). Nonetheless, we remind the reader \nthat the HQ was devised before the refinement of the historical \nterm ‘hyperacusis’ into two sub-classes of misophonia and (mod -\nern-use) hyperacusis. As such, it is not surprising that a high \nportion of misophonics score highly on the HQ.\nThe correlation between the HQ total and scores for the \nhyperacusis screener question was moderate and significant \n(r0.41, p D.001), while the correlation between scores for the \nhyperacusis screener question and the SMS total score was weak \nand not significant (r0.13, p0.177).\nItem-level HQ correlations\nThe correlations between responses to individual items on the \nHQ (HQ1 to HQ14) and (a) level of agreement with the hyper -\nacusis screening question and (b) the total SMS score were deter -\nmined. Our aim was to determine the extent to which individual \nquestions in the older HQ tapped into (modern uses of the terms \nfor) hyperacusis and misophonia. The difference between these \ncorrelations was therefore used to determine whether the items \ncorrelated significantly more highly with one construct than \nanother. The results are shown in Table 1. Scores for three items \nwere correlated with hyperacusis significantly more than with \nmisophonia (H!M), and scores for five items were correlated \nsignificantly more with misophonia than hyperacusis (M !H). \nScores for two items were significantly correlated with hyperacu -\nsis but not misophonia, although the difference in correlations was not significant (HFM). There were four items for which \nmisophonia and hyperacusis could not be discriminated \n(MH): scores for two items correlated with both, and scores \nfor two were correlated with neither. In summary, whilst the \ntotal HQ score does not reliably distinguish between hyperacusis \nand misophonia individual items showed differential sensitivity. \nHyperacusis questions were related more to sound-based distrac -\ntion and background noise, whereas misophonia questions were \nrelated more to social impacts of sound. Most significant differ -\nences between correlations survived correction for multiple com -\nparisons using the False Discovery Rate (only HQ3 did not).\nOther hyperacusis questions\nThe questions taken from Williams et al. (2021 ) were analysed in \nthe same way. The results are shown in Table 2. Scores for one \nquestion were more sensitive to hyperacusis than misophonia \n(everyday sounds being loud), scores for two were equally related \nto hyperacusis and misophonia (pain, ear protection) and scores \nfor the others were not significantly related to either. The SMS \ncontains four questions relating to pain, but the association \nbetween misophonia severity and reports of pain in the last \n12months from CORDS remained significant (r0.21, p \n.021) when these items were dropped.\nCategorical dependent variables were analysed with chi-square \ntaking a binary split of participants into misophonics with and \nwithout hyperacusis (as determined by the hyperacusis screening \nquestion). Figure 1shows the level of endorsement for the \nCORDS trigger sounds contrasting misophonics with and with -\nout hyperacusis. There were 13 sounds (/20) that significantly \ndistinguished between these groups, and in all cases this reflected \ngreater levels of endorsement by those who reported hyperacusis. \nHowever, when considering a wider pool of triggers (those used \nin the SMS) there were some sounds that were more strongly \nendorsed as triggers by those reporting misophonia without \nhyperacusis (see below).\nThose with hyperacusis were significantly less likely to have \nattended many loud concerts (v2(1) 5.73, p0.017) suggesting \nthat hyperacusis modified behaviour in this sample (as opposed \nto hyperacusis being caused by loud concerts). Those with hyper -\nacusis were significantly more likely to report sensitive teeth \n(v2(1) 7.08, p0.008). The fact that we found group differen -\nces in both directions argues against a simple response bias \n(over-reporting across all questions). The level of endorsement of \nthese statements is shown in Figure 2\nSMS trigger profile\nOur earlier research included the hyperacusis screener question \ntogether with 51 triggers in the SMS: 48 were assumed to be \nrelated to misophonia and three to hyperacusis (Andermane \net al., 2023a ). Figure 2shows the level of endorsement for differ -\nent triggers ranked by group difference. Some triggers were sig-\nnificantly more endorsed by those reporting both misophonia \nand hyperacusis (N5, house and car alarms, car engines, \nrepetitive barking, typing, sirens) and other triggers were signifi -\ncantly more endorsed by those reporting misophonia without \nhyperacusis (N3, lip smacking, swallowing, chewing). Thus, \nthere was a double dissociation across trigger sounds. A similar \npattern was found in a reanalysis of the full dataset reported by \nAndermane et al. (2023a ) as reported in the supplementary \nmaterial.4\n R. SMEES ET AL."

      "text": "Discussion\nThe term hyperacusis was historically applied to all forms of \ndecreased sound tolerances, across a range of aetiologies (with or \nwithout known hearing disorders) and presenting characteristics. \nThe term misophonia was later introduced to designate a sub-\ntype linked to specific sound triggers, irrespective of loudness (e.g., chewing). Although this has been hypothesised for two dec-\nades, quantitative evidence for this distinction is extremely \nsparse. Current consensus definitions of hyperacusis, from \nclinicians, do not make a clear delineation between hyperacusis \nand misophonia (Adams et al. 2021 ) and some commonly used \nmeasures such as the HQ (Hyperacusis Questionnaire) were not \ndesigned with these subtypes in mind (Khalfa et al. 2002 ).

      "text": "determine which of these two independent variables predicts per-\nformance on the HQ, as well as endorsement of sound triggers \nand other characteristics (e.g. sound-induced pain, and pain- \nrelated conditions). Participants’ level of agreement to a \nresearcher-derived definition of hyperacusis from a scoping \nreview (Fackrell et al. 2017 ) was used as a ground truth. \nResponses to this single-item question are associated with other \ncharacteristics of (narrowly defined) hyperacusis, independently \nof misophonia, even when assessed 18months later. For miso -\nphonia, we used a validated questionnaire (Simner, Rinaldi, and \nWard 2024 ) which has good convergent validity, scores being \ncorrelated with other recently developed measures of misopho -\nnia. Although the total score for the HQ was correlated with \nboth our measure of hyperacusis and our measure of misopho -\nnia, at the item level, there were double dissociations, some items \ntracking misophonia severity and others tracking hyperacusis. \nMisophonia was linked more to the social impacts of sounds, \nand hyperacusis more to the impact of noisy surroundings (e.g. \non concentration). These aversions were both linked to avoid -\nance behaviours: misophonics were more likely to report turning \ndown social invitations because of the sounds (reported on the \nHQ), and those with hyperacusis were less likely to attend loud \nconcerts (reported on the CORDS questions). Sound-induced \npain was linked to both misophonia and hyperacusis, although \npeople with hyperacusis reported more sensitive teeth. Tooth \nsensitivity is conventionally defined as brief episodes of sharp \nwell-localized pain when teeth are subjected innocuous stimuli \nsuch as cold, air-currents or probing with a metallic instrument \n(Markowitz and Pashley 2008 ). Another candidate hearing dis-\norder linked to jaw pain is Tensor Tympani Syndrome (Westcott \net al. 2013 ).\nOne possible way of conceptualising the difference between \nmisophonia and hyperacusis is that misophonia is narrow in \nterms of the range of sounds that elicit it and hyperacusis is \nbroad (perhaps encompassing all sounds if they are loud \nenough). However, this idea remains largely untested, and our \nevidence suggests that the difference could also relate to the \nnature of the sounds themselves (rather than the number of \nsounds that typically act as triggers). There were some sounds \n(lip smacking, swallowing, chewing) that bothered people with \n‘pure misophonia’ (i.e. without hyperacusis) more than those \nwho had both. And there were other sounds that were linked to \nhyperacusis more than misophonia. These latter included proto -\ntypically loud sounds (e.g. sirens, power tools, lawnmowers) but \nalso sounds that might not be considered so (e.g. typing on a \nkeyboard). Note that responses to played sounds of typing were \nalso predictive of hyperacusis, independently of misophonia, in a \nseparate study (Andermane et al. 2023b ). Research is needed that \npresents some of these sounds at different loudness levels to \nunderstand the relative contribution of these factors. Do sirens \nbother people with hyperacusis more than other people even \nwhen presented at a low level? Is the nature of the response (e.g. \npain, anxiety) different? Is this the case for all sounds or are \nsirens and certain other sounds special in some way?\nThe status of painful responses to sound in hyperacusis and \nmisophonia is also uncertain. Although pain has often been \nlinked to hyperacusis, it is not considered a defining property. \nOur research suggests that the same may also apply to misopho -\nnia. In the present study reports of pain were correlated both \nwith misophonia severity and hyperacusis (the correlations did \nnot differ significantly in magnitude from each other). The same \nheld true when a small number of items in the misophonia ques -\ntionnaire that explicitly mentioned pain were dropped (e.g. ‘It hurts when I hear certain sounds, even if it doesn’t hurt other \npeople’). Although pain appeared as a separate factor in the SMS \nquestionnaire, the association with more conventional factors \n(e.g. intersocial reactivity) was strong (Simner, Rinaldi, and \nWard 2024 ). Individual differences in responses to these pain \nquestions are partially separable from the overall misophonia \nseverity and hyperacusis status based on the ratings of sounds \n(Andermane et al. 2023b ). Our speculation is that painful \nresponses to sounds can be linked to both hyperacusis and miso -\nphonia and need not reflect one more than the other. Whether \nthe presence of pain is simply related to severity or to some add-\nitional variable remains for future research to determine.\nThere are a number of limitations to be recognised. As partic -\nipants were self-selected they may not be representative of \ndecreased sound tolerances within either the general population \nor those recruited as a result of clinical diagnosis. Of course the \nlatter group may themselves have distinct characteristics (e.g., \nco-comorbidities) that drives treatment seeking. Further studies \nshould seek to replicate findings in opportunistic samples as well \nas contrasting against clinically diagnosed samples. Moreover, \nthere are many definitions and ways of assessing both misopho -\nnia and hyperacusis and the extent to which the patterns \nobserved here are tied to the specific measures used is uncertain. \nFor example, hyperacusis could be measured in terms of lower \nloudness discomfort thresholds and other audiological assess -\nments (e.g. speech-in-noise) may be informative. Definitions of \nthese conditions are likely to evolve in light of new evidence, just \nas the original definition of hyperacusis was changed to recog -\nnise previously unclassified heterogeneity (now classified as \nmisophonia).\nMoving forwards, researchers interested in measuring hyper -\nacusis (as distinct from misophonia) may use the subset of ques -\ntions identified in the HQ rather than the entire scale (these are \nlisted again in the Supplementary Material). Secondary datasets \nwhere the HQ can be split could also be reanalysed in light of \nthe present results. Other measures are available that have been \ndeveloped that target hyperacusis as a distinct entity to misopho -\nnia and are broadly in line with the research presented here (e.g. \nAazh et al., 2022 ). This latter measure, the HIQ (Hyperacusis \nImpact Questionnaire), contains eight items. None relate specif -\nically to the social impact of sounds but tend to relate to the \nability to function (concentrate, relax, etc.) in noisy places.\nIn summary, the study provide evidence that misophonia and \nhyperacusis are at least partially dissociable entities with distinct \nprofiles relating to trigger sounds and effects on real-world \nbehaviour.\nAcknowledgements\nJW and JS are funded by the Misophonia Research Fund of the \nReam Foundation.
