E-mail: audiopedagog.eirinkrog@gmail.com\nINTRODUCTION\nMisophonia is a term ﬁrst coined by Jastreboff and\nJastreboff ( 2001 ), and the disorder has been de ﬁned and\ncharacterized differently since then (Brout, Edelstein, Erfanian,et al.,2018 ). However, a recent publication by Swedo, Baguley,\nDenys, et al.(2022 ) has aimed to establish a consensus de ﬁnition\nto enhance the understanding of the disorder and facilitate thedevelopment of effective treatments. They described misophoniaas a disorder of decreased tolerance to speci ﬁc sounds, known as\n“triggers. ”The triggers are often sounds made by other human\nbeings and repetitive in nature (e.g., eating sounds or the clickingof a pen). When individuals with misophonia detect triggeringstimuli, they often ﬁnd it challenging to shift their attention away\nfrom them. This can lead to unpleasant and distressing\nexperiences, eliciting negative emotional, physiological, andbehavioral responses. These trigger stimuli can evoke a range ofnegative reactions, including anger, irritation, disgust, and anxiety,and induce increased muscular tension, heart rate, and sweating(Swedo, Baguley, Denys, et al.,2022 ). Misophonia signi ﬁcantly\ndisrupts the lives of those affected, as it often leads tomaladaptive behaviors and avoidance patterns that interfere with\ntheir ability to perform tasks at work or in academics, and results\nin notable impairment in their interpersonal relationships (Brout,Edelstein, Erfanian, et al .,2018 ; Ferrer-Torres & Gim /C19enes-\nLlort, 2022 ).\nWhile there is currently no universally agreed-on procedure for\nassessing the disorder, use of clinical interviews and othermeasures, such as self-report questionnaires, has been suggested(Wiese, Wojcik & Storch, 2021 ). There are multiple self-report\nquestionnaires available for assessing misophonia. Each onecaptures speci ﬁc aspects of the disorder, although they may not\nnecessarily measure the same constructs or dimensions due to\nvariations in the de ﬁnition of misophonia (Swedo, Baguley,\nDenys, et al .,2022 ). Questionnaires that have undergone\npsychometric analyses include the Misophonia Questionnaire(MQ; Wu, Lewin, Murphy & Storch, 2014 ), MisoQuest (Siepsiak,\n/C19Sliwerski & Dragan, 2020 ), the Selective Sound Sensitivity\nSyndrome Scale (S-Five; Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes &Gregory, 2021 ), the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ;\nRosenthal, Anand, Cassiello-Robbins, et al .,2021 ), the\nDuke-Vanderbilt Misophonia Screening Questionnaire (DVMSQ;Williams, Cascio & Woynaroski, 2022 ), the Misophonia Response\nScale (MRS; Dibb, Golding & Dozier, 2021 ), the Misophonia\nImpact Questionnaire (MIQ; Aazh, Moore, Scaglione &Remmert, 2023 ), and the Berlin Misophonia Questionnaire\nRevised (BMQ-R; Remmert, Schmidt, Mussel, Hagel &\n© 2024 The Author(s).

Utilizing psychometrically sound assessment\ninstruments is imperative for comprehensively understanding thenature and severity of misophonia and for effectively evaluatingtreatment outcomes by assessing changes in symptom severity\nand degree of distress (Fackrell & Hoare, 2018 ).\nIn Norway, the MQ has undergone preliminary psychometric\nanalyses (i.e., MQ-NOR by Larsen, Hovland, Nielsen &Larsen, 2022 ), providing valuable insights into its measurement\nproperties, which were reported to be good. However, despitethese positive ﬁndings, the MQ-NOR is limited in its brevity and\ninsufﬁcient coverage of key aspects of misophonia. Although\ndemonstrating promising initial psychometric properties,\nuncertainties persist regarding the MQ ’s ability to accurately\nmeasure misophonia and its generalizability to the broaderpopulation of misophonia sufferers. These uncertainties stem fromits validation against a questionnaire assessing general soundsensitivity and its usage of a university sample. Furthermore, theuse of a single self-reported severity item limits suf ﬁcient\npsychometric evaluation. Given its development prior to theestablishment of core de ﬁnitions regarding misophonia, there is a\npotential need for re ﬁnement to better align with current\nunderstandings of the disorder (Rosenthal, Anand, Cassiello-Robbins, et al.,2021 ; Siepsiak, /C19Sliwerski & Dragan, 2020 ). The\nBMQ-R was validated against two misophonia questionnaires andadditional measures to suf ﬁciently validate all symptom-oriented\nsubscales. Data collection involved both a university sample andparticipants recruited through online posts on social media.Additionally, the BMQ-R aligns with the scienti ﬁc consensus on\nthe de ﬁnition of misophonia. Furthermore, it has undergone a\nrevision, which ensures that the questionnaire has incorporatedupdated conceptualizations and improvements based on analysesof the previous version (Remmert, Jebens, et al.,2022 ; Remmert,\nSchmidt, et al .,2022 ). The BMQ-R was chosen for its\nsymptom-oriented construction rationale and comprehensivecoverage of misophonic symptoms. Additionally, its alignmentwith the consensus and the recent revision underscores its\nsuitability. Our aim was to provide clinicians with an exhaustive\nand improved instrument for assessing misophonia that ensuredboth validity and reliability.\nThe present study\nThe present study aimed to conduct an initial validation of a\nNorwegian version of the Berlin Misophonia Questionnaire\nRevised (i.e., BMQ-R-NOR), a multidimensional diagnostic\ninstrument that measures a wide range of misophonic symptoms(Remmert, Jebens, et al.,2022 ; Remmert, Schmidt, et al.,2022 ).\nTo evaluate translation equivalence, it was hypothesized that\nthe translated version of the BMQ-R-NOR would maintain theoriginal meaning and intention of each item. This hypothesis wasbased on the importance of ensuring consistency in theinterpretation of questionnaire items across languages and\ncultures. The forward and back translation procedure was\nemployed as a widely accepted method for assessing translationequivalence. An expert panel, consisting of bilingual individualswith expertise in both the source and target languages, assessedthe translation against the original to ensure semantic equivalencein each subscale. Consensus among the experts was sought to\nconﬁrm the accuracy of the translation process.\nSimilarly, a hypothesis regarding cultural equivalence posited\nthat the translation would be culturally adapted to ensureunderstanding and relevance for the Norwegian population. This\ncriterion was based on the recognition of the in ﬂuence of cultural\nfactors on the interpretation of questionnaire items. Pre-testingwith potential participants was conducted to assess questioncomprehension and identify any cultural misunderstandings orsensitivities. This step aimed to ensure that the translatedquestionnaire resonated with the cultural context of the targetpopulation.\nTo assess convergent validity, both indirect and direct methods\nwere employed. Indirectly, intercorrelations between the\nsymptom-oriented subscales and the General Sound IntoleranceSymptoms (GSIS) subscale were utilized, aligning with theindirect validation approach employed by Remmert, Schmidt,et al ., (2022 ) and Remmert, Jebens, et al (2022 ). It was\nanticipated that all subscales within each content area would\ndemonstrate high positive correlations. Additionally, it wasexpected that the GSIS would exhibit moderate to high\ncorrelations with misophonic symptoms. Directly, correlations\nwere calculated between all subscales from the BMQ-R-NOR andthe MQ-NOR Emotions and Behaviors Scale, as well as betweenthe MQ-NOR Severity Scale and selected subscales from theBMQ-R-NOR. The MQ-NOR Symptom Scale, a triggerfrequency scale, closely aligns with the sound classes outlined inthe condition part of the BMQ-R-NOR. Consequently, no speci ﬁc\nanalyses were conducted on these sound classes, as their primary\nfunction is to provide an overview of the most disturbing sounds\nexperienced by an individual. The MQ-NOR measures someaspects of misophonia, encompassing broad symptoms associatedwith the disorder. It was hypothesized that certain subscales fromthe BMQ-R-NOR would show moderate to high correlations withthe MQ-NOR Emotions and Behaviors Scale, which can becategorized descriptively into avoidance items, emotionalreactions items, one distress item, and dysregulation items.\nSpeci ﬁcally, it was anticipated that subscales aligning with the\ndescriptive content of the MQ-NOR Emotions and BehaviorsScale (Anger Present, Irritation Present, Anxiety Present,Behavioral Dysregulation, Emotional Dysregulation, ReactiveAvoidance, Anticipatory Avoidance, and Distress) woulddemonstrate higher correlations. Conversely, it was hypothesizedthat subscales not aligning with the MQ-NOR Emotions andBehaviors Scale on a descriptive content level would correlate\nmoderately. The MQ-NOR Severity Scale was correlated with the\nsubscales in the content areas of Dysregulation, AvoidanceBehavior, and Clinical Signi ﬁcance (refer to the Measures section\nfor an extensive list of content areas and subscales). It washypothesized that these subscales would demonstrate moderate tohigh correlations with the MQ-NOR Severity Scale, which is inline with current literature (Guzick, Cervin, Smith, et al.,2023 ;\nJager, de Koning, Bost, Denys & Vulink, 2020 ;M€ollmann,\nHeinrichs, Illies, Potthast & Kley, 2023 ).\nLast, regarding reliability, it was hypothesized that the\ntranslated version of the BMQ-R-NOR would maintain thereliability of the measurements. This hypothesis was based on theassumption that the translation process did not introduce\n© 2024 The Author(s).

To evaluate reliability, internal\nconsistency (i.e., omega and alpha) were calculated for thetranslated version and compared with those of the original versionto ensure comparable reliability. Test –retest reliability was also\nevaluated by assessing the consistency of responses between two\ntesting points. The intraclass correlation coef ﬁcient (ICC) was\ncalculated to quantify the degree of agreement between the testresults from the two time points, providing an estimate of thestability of the measurements over time.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nProcedure and participants\nData were collected through Nettskjema, an online service provided by the\nUniversity of Oslo for creating, storing, and managing surveys and data\ncollection, which is connected to the secure IT platform TSD (Tjeneste for\nSensitive Data) (Nettskjema, n.d.). Participants were recruited by\nexperienced educational audio therapists through four audiology clinics, aswell as through social media groups and posts. No ﬁnancial or other\nsupport was provided. To meet the inclusion criteria for participation in\nthe study, individuals had to be between the ages of 18 and 67 years andreport a current or suspected complaint of misophonia. Participantsreceived comprehensive information about the study, which included a\nthorough explanation of misophonia experience and symptoms, aiming to\nestablish consistent comprehension of the term (i.e., “Do you experience\nanger or irritation when someone else eats, slurps or breathes loudly? Do\nyou avoid meals with friends and family? Do you lose concentration when\nexposed to repetitive sounds? ”). All participants were required to provide\ninformed consent and answer all questions before submitting thequestionnaire. The data were collected between February and April 2023.\nParticipants were asked to respond to the survey on two occasions,\napproximately two weeks apart. These time points were labeled T1 andT2, respectively. The study was approved by Sikt —Norwegian Agency for\nShared Services in Education and Research, which allowed us to handle\npersonal data. Ethics approval from the Regional Committees for Medical\nand Health Research Ethics (REK) was not required, as the primary focusof this study was to adapt and validate the BMQ-R-NOR.\nAt T1, a total of 82 participants completed the survey (85.4% female).\nAt T2, 53 participants completed the survey (79.2% female). The meanage was M=37.7 ( SD=12.33). Of all participants, 74.7% obtained\ninformation about the study through social media, 21.7% acquired it from\npersonal acquaintances, and 3.6% received it through educational audio\ntherapists. To prevent any potential interference caused by treatmenteffects, 12 participants who were receiving treatment for misophonia at T1and/or T2 were excluded from the test –retest analyses.\nTranslation\nThe translation of the BMQ-R was based on the guidelines outlined in the\n“WHODAS 2.0 Translation package (version 1.0): Translation and\nLinguistic Evaluation Protocol and Supporting Material ”(World Health\nOrganization [WHO], n.d.). This process involved a forward- and\nback-translation procedure aimed at achieving cross-cultural andconceptual equivalence (WHO, n.d.). Although the guidelines are\nspeciﬁcally tailored for the translation of WHODAS, they outline the\nstandard WHO method, which we followed for the translation andadaptation of the BMQ-R. Initially, permission was granted from thedevelopers of the BMQ-R to adapt the questionnaire into Norwegian.\nNext, a professional translator was engaged to create a forward-translation.\nAn expert panel was assembled to review the translation, consisting of twoNorwegian-German bilinguals, one educational audio therapist with\nclinical expertise in misophonia, and one psychologist with expertise in\nfamily con ﬂicts. The two bilingual experts compared the\nforward-translation with the original version and provided suggestions forimprovements in cases where the translation was unclear or inaccurate.Afterward, two professionals from different backgrounds reviewed both\nthe forward-translation and the suggestions provided by the bilingualexperts. The professional experts provided feedback on the suggestions,\noften concurring with them, but occasionally proposing their modi ﬁcation\nbased on their expertise in the ﬁeld. Any discrepancies were discussed and\nresolved by the ﬁrst and last author. A second translator was engaged to\nproduce a back-translation of selected items from the ﬁnal reviewed\nforward-translation. The Department of Special Needs Education at theUniversity of Oslo was responsible for engaging the translators. One ofthe developers compared the back-translation with the original version and\nevaluated the selected items, providing comments on which items were\nequivalent in translation and which ones may have changed in meaning oritem dif ﬁculty. Due to time constraints, the pre-testing of the questionnaire\nand the main data collection were conducted before a review of the\nback-translation in comparison with the original version could take place.\nThe Norwegian instrument was pre-tested by four individuals whoself-reported having misophonia. They offered feedback on items thatwere dif ﬁcult to understand or unclear, and this resulted in minor\nadjustments to the wording of three items and the inclusion of examples\nfor the sound classes.\nMeasures\nNorwegian version of the Berlin Misophonia Questionnaire\n(BMQ-R-NOR). The questionnaire comprises a condition part and a\nsymptom part (Remmert, Jebens, et al .,2022 ; Remmert, Schmidt,\net al.,2022 ). The condition part includes the General Sound Intolerance\nSymptoms (GSIS) subscale and 20 items that measure the extent of\ndisturbances related to externally and internally produced sound classes.\nThe GSIS consists of four items that are rated on a six-point scale rangingfrom 0 ( not at all agree )t o5( completely agree ). The sound classes are\nrated on a six-point scale ranging from 0 ( not disturbing at all )t o5\n(maximally disturbing ). The symptom part consists of 73 items organized\ninto 20 subscales across six criteria-oriented content areas: (1) AversiveReactions to the Presence of Sounds and (2) Anticipation of Sounds,encompassing the subscales Anger, Irritation, Disgust, Anxiety, and\nPhysical Reactions, in response to both the presence and anticipation; (3)\nDysregulation, encompassing General, Behavioral, Cognitive, andEmotional Dysregulation; (4) Clinical Insight, consisting of the subscalesRecognition of Disproportionality and Excess; (5) Avoidance Behavior,\nincluding the two subscales Reactive and Anticipatory Avoidance; and (6)\nClinical Signi ﬁcance, consisting of Distress and Functional Impairment\n(Remmert, Jebens, et al .,2022 ; Remmert, Schmidt, et al .,2022 ).\nRespondents rate each item on a six-point scale ranging from 0 ( not at all\nagree )t o5( completely agree ).\nNorwegian version of the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ-NOR;\nLarsen, Hovland, Nielsen & Larsen, 2022 ).The MQ-NOR is a\nself-report questionnaire for assessing misophonia, consisting of three\nsubscales. The Misophonia Symptom Scale (omega =0.71) comprises\nseven items and is rated on a ﬁve-point scale ranging from 0 ( not at all\ntrue)t o4( always true ). The Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors Scale\n(omega =0.81) consists of 10 items and is rated on a ﬁve-point scale\nranging from 0 ( never )t o4( always ). The Total Score Scale is calculated\nby summing the scores from these two subscales. The MisophoniaSeverity Scale is a single-item 16-point rating scale ranging from 0 ( not\nsound sensitive )t o1 5( very severe ).\nStatistical analyses\nThe internal consistency of the BMQ-R-NOR was assessed with\nMcDonald ’s omega and Cronbach ’s alpha coef ﬁcients, which were\nclassi ﬁed based on established cutoff values: 0.70 –0.79 reliable, 0.80 –0.90\nhighly reliable, and >0.90 very highly reliable (Cohen, Manion &\nMorrison, 2018 ). Omega is the estimate utilized by the developers of the\nBMQ-R, and it is particularly advantageous for use with non-normally\ndistributed data (Trizano-Hermosilla & Alvarado, 2016 ). Alpha estimates\nwere included to facilitate comparability with results from studies, as\n© 2024 The Author(s).

      "text": "many older studies only provide estimates of alpha. Following Remmert,\nSchmidt, et al (2022 ) and Remmert, Jebens, et al (2022 ), con ﬁdence\nintervals for omega and alpha were computed using bias-corrected and\naccelerated bootstrapping with a bootstrapping sample size B =1,000\n(Kelley, 2023 ; R Core Team, 2023 ). The interpretation of the correlation\ncoefﬁcients followed the rule of thumb proposed by Hinkle, Jurs, and\nWiersma ( 2003 ). Convergent validity was indirectly evaluated by\ncalculating correlations between the symptom-oriented subscales and theGSIS subscale. In addition, all subscales from the BMQ-R-NOR werecorrelated with the MQ-NOR Emotions and Behaviors Scale, and selected\nsubscales from the BMQ-R-NOR were correlated with the MQ-NOR\nSeverity Scale, to further examine convergent validity. Subscale scores ofthe BMQ-R-NOR were computed by calculating the mean score of allitems within each subscale. The correlation analyses were performed using\nSpearman ’s rho correlation coef ﬁcients due to non-normality in the data,\nas determined by the Shapiro –Wilk test. Test –retest reliability was\nexamined using four methods. Three methods were used for categoricalvariables (i.e., individual items), which included (1) exact agreement\nbetween items at T1 and T2, (2) difference of one point or less in response\nbetween T1 and T2, and (3) Cohen ’s weighted kappa (Landis &\nKoch, 1977 ). The fourth method was used for continuous variables (i.e.,\nBMQ-R-NOR subscales), which involved intraclass correlations (ICCs).\nICC estimates and their 95% con ﬁdent intervals were based on a single\nrater/measurement, absolute-agreement, two-way mixed model (Koo &Li,2016 ). The criteria for Cohen ’s weighted kappa ratings were as\nfollows: 0.21 –0.40 for fair agreement, 0.41 –0.60 for moderate agreement,\n0.61–0.80 for substantial agreement, and 0.81 –1 for almost perfect\nagreement (Landis & Koch, 1977 ). ICC values were interpreted according\nto the following criteria: <0.50 were considered poor reliability, 0.50 –0.75\nwere moderate reliability, 0.75 –0.90 were good reliability, and >0.90 were\nexcellent reliability (Koo & Li, 2016 ). The statistical analyses were\nconducted using IBM SPSS (Version 29), Jamovi (Version 2.2.5), and R\nStatistical Software (Version 4.9.3; R Core Team, 2023 ) with the package\nMBESS (Kelley, 2023 ).\nRESULTS\nDescriptive statistics\nOf the participants, 67.1% had the highest GSIS sum score of 20.\nT h em e a nG S I Ss u ms c o r ew a s M=19.12 ( SD=1.69). Notably,\nwhen applying the same cutoff scores as utilized by Remmert,\nSchmidt, et al (2022) and Remmert, Jebens, et al (2022), where\npotentially affected individuals are identi ﬁed by a sum score greater\nthan 12, only one participant in this sample scored below thisthreshold. Based on these results, it can be inferred that the majorityof the sample primarily consisted of individuals who may beaffected by the disorder. The three sound classes that participantswere most disturbed by were “people eating ”(M=4.32,\nSD=1.05), “throat and mouth sounds ”(M=3.60, SD=1.32), and\n“people drinking ”(M=3.41, SD=1.39). The least disturbing\nsound class was “animal sounds ”(M=0.96, SD=1.19).\nThe 20 symptom-oriented subscales had means and standard\ndeviations ranging from M=3.7 ( SD=3.84) to M=18.4\n(SD=2.88). The Anticipation Anxiety Reactions subscale had\nthe lowest mean, and the Present Irritation Reactions subscale hadthe highest. Please see Table 3for an overview of the means and\nstandard deviations of all subscales.\nConvergent validity\nIntercorrelations between the symptom-oriented subscales and the\nGSIS subscale can be found in Table 1. The average correlationamong all subscales within Aversive Reactions to the Presence of\nSounds is moderate and positive ( r\ns=0.52), and in Aversive\nReactions to the Anticipation of Sounds, it is similar ( rs=0.51).\nWithin the Dysregulation domain, the average correlation alsoleans toward a moderate and positive association ( r\ns=0.41).\nRegarding the Clinical Insight and Clinical Signi ﬁcance content\nareas, high positive correlations were observed with the subscalesin each content area, as hypothesized, speci ﬁcally, the subscales\nDisproportionality and Excess ( r\ns=0.75) and Distress and\nFunctional Impairment ( rs=0.78). Additionally, within\nAvoidance Behavior, the subscales Reactive Avoidance andAnticipatory Avoidance displayed moderate positive correlations(r\ns=0.63). In the Presence of Sounds content area, the highest\ncorrelation is found between the subscales Irritation and Anger,\nIrritation and Disgust, and Anxiety and Physical ( rs=0.59),\nwhereas the lowest correlation is between Anxiety and Disgust(r\ns=0.38). Within the Anticipation of Sounds domain, the\nhighest correlation is observed between the subscales Disgust andIrritation ( r\ns=0.67), with the lowest observed between Anxiety\nand Anger ( rs=0.26). The GSIS displayed an average moderate\npositive correlation, with the highest correlation observed with the\nsubscale Irritation Present ( rs=0.55), and the lowest correlation\nwas found with Anxiety Present ( rs=0.16), indicating a non-\nsigniﬁcant correlation. These ﬁndings deviate from the initial\nhypotheses, as it was expected that all subscales within eachcontent area would demonstrate high positive correlations, andthat the GSIS would exhibit moderate to high correlationswith misophonic symptoms, contrasting notably with theintercorrelations observed in the original BMQ-R dataset.\nTo assess convergent validity, all symptom-oriented subscales\nwere correlated with the MQ-NOR Emotions and Behaviors Scale.Furthermore, speci ﬁc subscales such as General, Behavioral,\nCognitive and Emotional Dysregulation, Reactive and AnticipatoryAvoidance, and Distress and Functional Impairment were correlatedwith the MQ-NOR Severity Scale (see Table 2). The correlations\nbetween the BMQ-R-NOR subscales and the MQ-NOR Emotionsand Behaviors Scale ranged from descriptively low positive\ncorrelation ( r\ns=0.36, Cognitive Dysregulation) to high positive\ncorrelation ( rs=0.74, Anger Present). The correlations between the\nselected subscales from the BMQ-R-NOR and the MQ-NORSeverity Scale ranged from descriptively non-signi ﬁcant correlation\n(r\ns=0.17, Behavioral Dysregulation) to moderate positive\ncorrelation ( rs=0.57, Anticipatory Avoidance). These results\ndeviate from the initial hypotheses.\nInternal consistency\nThe internal consistency for the 21 subscales ranged from reliable\n(omega =0.72) to very highly reliable (omega =0.93).

      "text": "Impairment (0.93). The con ﬁdence intervals for omega overlap for\nmost of the subscales between the original BMQ-R and itsNorwegian adaptation, except for ﬁve subscales, namely Present\nAnger Reactions, Anticipation Disgust Reactions, BehavioralDysregulation, Recognition of Excess, and Distress. For anoverview of the reliability estimates for each subscale, please referto Table 3.\nTest–retest reliability\nExamining both exact agreement and agreement with a difference\nof one grade or less, the agreement for individual items on theBMQ-R-NOR ranged from poor to very good. Weighted kappas\nwere in the fair to almost perfect agreement range with valuesranging from 0.23 (G3) to 0.81 (BD03) (see SupplementaryAppendix S1). The ICCs ranged from 0.53 (GSIS) to 0.92\n(Functional Impairment), indicating moderate to excellent\nagreement, except for Present Irritation Reactions, which showed\npoor agreement (ICC =0.35) (see Table 4).\nDISCUSSION\nThe aim of this study was to perform a preliminary evaluation of\nthe BMQ-R-NOR, a Norwegian version of the BMQ-R(Remmert, Jebens, et al.,2022 ; Remmert, Schmidt, et al.,2022 ),\nby examining its psychometric properties. The main objective was\nto introduce a second, more comprehensive misophoniaassessment tool speci ﬁcally designed for the Norwegian context.\nThis evaluation signi ﬁes notable progress in research and clinical\npractices in the ﬁeld of misophonia within the Norwegian\npopulation.\nIt was hypothesized that the translated version would accurately\npreserve the original meaning and intent of each item while being\nculturally adapted to the Norwegian population. However, due to\ntime constraints, the back-translated items were not reviewed priorto questionnaire testing, potentially resulting in changes inwording that could alter the intended measurement, reduceextremity, or deviate from the original meaning of certain items.Comments from the developer of the BMQ-R suggested thatcertain items may indeed have changed in terms of meaningduring the translation process, particularly within the subscales\nBehavioral Dysregulation, Disproportionality, and Distress. In the\nBehavioral Dysregulation subscale, one item has been modi ﬁed to\nhave less extreme wording compared with the original version,using get furious (“bli rasende ”) instead of freak out (“ausrasten ”)\nin the Norwegian translation. This change potentially affects theitem ’s alignment with the intended construct of behavioral\ndysregulation, as it may now load onto the factor of angerreactions instead. Another item in the Behavioral Dysregulation\nsubscale also has less extreme wording in the translated version,\npotentially altering the perception of control over unsolicitedcomments. These modi ﬁcations were made to better align with\nthe Norwegian language and culture. The item in the subscaleDisproportionality was unintentionally modi ﬁed by adding a\nmoral component resulting in the statement I shouldn ’t react like\nthat...(“Egentlig bør jeg ikke reagere s /C23ann...”) instead of the\noriginal, which stated I should not have to react to ...(“Eigentlich\nm€\nusste ich gar nicht so ...”). This change was prompted by\nuncertainty regarding the correct interpretation of the originalitem, as one of the bilingual experts found it to be ambiguous.Ultimately, the modi ﬁed version was chosen to ensure better\nalignment with the remaining items in the same subscale.Additionally, within the subscale Distress, the Norwegian versionused less extreme wording compared with the original version,using terms such as emotionally stressed (“emosjonelt stresset ”)\nand stressed (“stresset ”) instead of emotionally burdened\n(“emotional belastet ”) and bothered (“belasten ”). The choice of\nterminology was based on feedback from the bilingual expertsand the desire to maintain coherence throughout the questionnaire.Furthermore, in the Anxiety Present subscale, termed Fear PresentTable 2.

      "text": "in Norwegian to avoid confusion with the clinical diagnosis of\nanxiety, one item was adjusted accordingly. For instance,Sometimes I experience intense anxiety or panic (“Noen ganger\nføler jeg intens angst eller panikk ...”) was translated as\nSometimes I experience intense fear or panic (“Noen ganger føler\njeg intens frykt eller panikk ...”) to better re ﬂect the intended\nconstruct in the Norwegian context.\nThe intercorrelations between the symptom-oriented subscales\nexhibit signi ﬁcant positive correlations within their respective\ncontent area, although consistency across different domainsvaries. While some correlations were indeed high and positive, itis noteworthy that not all correlations aligned descriptively withthe hypothesis of high positive correlations. In comparison withthe original BMQ-R (Remmert, Jebens, et al.,2022 ; Remmert,\nSchmidt, et al .,2022 ), the BMQ-R-NOR demonstrates lower\noverall correlations. The observed discrepancies may stem from\nsampling variations, wherein homogeneity of the participantgroup could in ﬂuence the observed correlations, or the translation\nprocess, which could potentially lead to inaccurately translateditems (Beaton, Bombardier, Guillemin & Ferraz, 2000 ; Cohen,\nManion & Morrison, 2018 ). Additionally, the use of summed\nscores may have contributed to the overall lower correlationsobserved in our study. Notably, the GSIS displays moderate to\nlow, and in two cases non-signi ﬁcant, correlations with the\nrespective symptom-oriented subscales. This observation isparticularly noteworthy and not in line with the initial hypothesis.However, it may be explained by the low variance of the GSIS.The relatively low and non-signi ﬁcant correlation between theGSIS and the Anxiety subscales (Present and Anticipation) could\nbe attributed to the possibility that the scale does not captureprimary reactions but rather secondary emotions in response tosounds. Individuals with misophonia may not identify panic orfear as their primary reactions to sounds. Instead, they mayinitially respond with anger, followed by a sense of panic(Vitoratou, Uglik-Marucha, Hayes & Gregory, 2021 ).\nThe correlation analyses conducted between all BMQ-R-NOR\nsubscales and the MQ-NOR Emotions and Behaviors Scale, aswell as between selected BMQ-R-NOR subscales and theMQ-NOR Severity Scale, provide support for the hypothesis thatthe BMQ-R-NOR subscales measure conceptually relatedconstructs. Notably, a descriptively higher correlation wasobserved between the MQ-NOR Emotions and Behaviors Scaleand the BMQ-R-NOR ’s Anger Present subscale compared with\nIrritation Present, a pattern similarly observed in the Anticipation\ndomain. This difference in correlation strengths may be attributedto the composition of the MQ-NOR subscale, which comprisescomposites of various symptoms. For instance, within theEmotions and Behaviors Scale, four out of ten items re ﬂect anger\nsymptoms, while only one item represents irritation. Thisdiscrepancy in item representation could potentially in ﬂuence the\nstrength of correlations observed between speci ﬁc subscales.\nContrary to our hypothesis, regarding the correlations with the\nMQ-NOR Severity Scale, the selected BMQ-R-NOR subscalesdid not exhibit descriptively high correlations with the MQ-NORSeverity Scale. However, all but one scale showed signi ﬁcant and\ndescriptively low to moderate positive correlations. The absenceTable 3.

      "text": "of a signi ﬁcant correlation between the Behavioral Dysregulation\nsubscale and the Severity Scale raises concerns regardingconvergent validity. While it is expected that behavioral\ndysregulation and symptom severity are closely related constructs,\nthis observed discrepancy prompts further examination. Theseresults provide preliminary empirical support for the validity ofthe BMQ-R-NOR as a measure for assessing misophonia. Toestablish construct validity, the original BMQ-R underwentcomprehensive evaluations using various instruments thatassessed constructs similar to the different symptom-orientedscales (Remmert, Jebens, et al .,2022 ; Remmert, Schmidt,\net al.,2022 ).\nThe ﬁndings regarding internal consistency offer valuable\ninsights into the measurement properties of the BMQ-R-NOR.The analyses indicate satisfactory internal consistency across allsubscales, suggesting that items within each subscale are coherentand measure the same underlying concept. However, whenexamining the Dysregulation domain, all subscales showed highto very high reliability except the Behavioral Dysregulation\nsubscale, which exhibited only reliable indices. This discrepancy\ncould be attributed to some items loading onto the factor of anger,as previously stated. Moreover, upon comparing the con ﬁdence\nintervals of the reliability estimates between our sample and theoriginal sample, it is evident that most subscales exhibit\noverlapping con ﬁdence intervals, indicating statistically indifferent\nestimates. However, there were notable exceptions where theconﬁdence intervals did not overlap, speci ﬁcally in ﬁve subscales.\nThese discrepancies suggest potential differences in reliability\nbetween our sample and the original sample. Nonetheless, these\nresults tentatively suggest that the translation of the BMQ-R tothe BMQ-R-NOR appears to be appropriate.\nAt the descriptive level, the test –retest analyses revealed that\nthe mean exact agreement across all items was 49% (i.e., 77 itemsby 41 participants). Additionally, the mean difference of onegrade or less across all items was 80.6%. These ﬁndings indicate\nthat the majority of the changes in responses from T1 to T2 were\nminor, with only one grade or less difference. However, there\nwere variations in responses, raising questions about the stabilityof the questionnaire. Based on the statistical test –retest analyses,\nthe indices using Cohen ’s weighted kappa revealed moderate to\nalmost perfect agreement for 65 items, while 12 itemsdemonstrated fair agreement. This suggests that there is a certainlevel of agreement between the items, but there is still room forimprovement, and the questionnaire should undergo further\npsychometric evaluations. The indices using ICCs indicated poor\nagreement for only one subscale, Irritation Present. The observedvariations may be attributed to respondent fatigue as the length ofthe questionnaire could potentially impact participants ’level of\nengagement and attention (Cohen, Manion & Morrison, 2018 ).\nAnother factor that could contribute to the variations in responsesis the potential differences in the experience of misophoniasymptoms between T1 and T2. It is known that misophonia\nsymptoms can change over time (Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ) and\nmay potentially be in ﬂuenced by factors such as stress levels\n(Frank & McKay, 2019 ). These factors could have contributed to\nthe observed discrepancies in participants ’responses, which are\nalso evident in the statistical analyses, including Cohen ’s\nweighted kappa and ICCs. This study is the ﬁrst to examine the\ntest–retest reliability of the BMQ-R. The results suggest that the\nBMQ-R-NOR demonstrates adequate test –retest reliability,\nindicating its potential for reliable use over time.\nBased on our ﬁndings, the questionnaire has potential\napplications across various domains including clinical practiceand research in the ﬁeld of misophonia. Clinically, it can be\nutilized for diagnosing misophonia, assessing the severity ofsymptoms, tailoring treatment plans, and evaluating theeffectiveness of interventions/treatment. In research, it can be avaluable instrument for investigating prevalence, risk factors, and\noutcomes related to misophonia.\nLimitations\nWhen interpreting the study ﬁndings, it is important to consider\nseveral limitations. First, the sampling method, which involvedrecruiting participants from social media and clinics, may limitthe generalizability of the results to the broader Norwegian\npopulation. Second, the study had a lower-than-expected number\nof participants, which hindered the execution of con ﬁ\nrmatory\nfactor analyses and limited the ability to compare the results withthe original BMQ-R study by Remmert, Schmidt, et al (2022 ) and\nRemmert, Jebens, et al (2022 ).

Third, the samplepredominantly consisted of females, with only a small proportionof male participants (14.6%). While this gender imbalance may\nnot have directly in ﬂuenced the study ’sﬁndings, it affects the\ncomparability of results between genders. Last, the utilization ofthe MQ-NOR as the sole instrument for validation raises concernsabout its appropriateness for assessing the BMQ-R-NOR.Although our ﬁndings provide initial evidence for valid\nconclusions regarding broader misophonic symptoms, it isimportant to acknowledge that the MQ-NOR may not be theoptimal instrument for this purpose. Hence, future research should\nconsider incorporating a broader range of convergent measures to\nfurther validate the BMQ-R-NOR and ensure its robustness acrossvarious contexts and populations. Particularly, efforts to recruitparticipants from clinical settings alongside those from socialmedia platforms could enhance the representativeness of thesample and strengthen the generalizability of ﬁndings.\nAdditionally, inclusion of a control group in future studies wouldprovide valuable comparative data, allowing for more rigorous\nexamination of the speci ﬁcity and sensitivity of the BMQ-R-NOR\nin distinguishing misophonia from other disorders.\nCONCLUSION\nThe present study has demonstrated that the BMQ-R-NOR\nexhibits overall satisfactory psychometric properties, includingadequate internal consistency and test –retest reliability.\nAdditionally, most subscales of the BMQ-R-NOR have\ndemonstrated moderate to high correlations with the MQ-NOR,indicating initial evidence of convergent validity. The non-signiﬁcant correlation of the subscale Behavioral Dysregulation\nand the MQ-NOR Severity Scale questions the convergentvalidity. The BMQ-R-NOR serves as a valuable tool for assessingvarious aspects of misophonia in Norway, providing a morecomprehensive questionnaire option.
