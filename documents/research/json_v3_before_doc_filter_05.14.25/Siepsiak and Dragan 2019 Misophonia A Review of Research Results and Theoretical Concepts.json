Among the most frequent \naversive triggers are the sounds of eating, breathing, or typing. The experience of misophonia \nis associated with suffering and a significant decrease in quality of life. The phenomenon was \nfirst described in 2002. Since then, numerous case studies and data from psychophysiological \nand neurological and survey research on this phenomenon have been published. These data \nindicate that misophonia is a consistent phenomenon and preliminary identification is pos-\nsible. The most recent results show that misophonia occurs independent of other disorders. \nThere are still, however, many questions regarding the definition and diagnostic criteria to be \nanswered. The most important diagnostic issues that are faced during clinical work with people \nwith misophonia are described in this article. Furthermore, the main theoretical concepts and \nresearch on misophonia are reviewed and analyzed.\nKey words: misophonia, decreased sound tolerance\nIntroduction\nMisophonia (from the Greek misos – ‛hate’, phonia – ‛sound’) is a form of de-\ncreased sound tolerance [1, 2]. Its literal translation is misleading, because the essence \nof the condition is selective sound aversion, not a  hypersensitivity to all kinds of sounds. \nSome authors [3] include reactions evoked by visual triggers in misophonia. However, \nbecause of the predominance of data on sound triggers and sparse evidence for other \ntriggers, this article will be consistent with the main subject literature and assume that \nmisophonic reactions are related to sounds.\nMisophonia was first described in 2002 by Paweł Jastreboff, who, when working \nwith patients with tinnitus, noticed a group of people displaying a set of symptoms"

In 1990, Marsha Johnson, \nan audiologist, observed the same specific intolerance for certain sounds during her \nclinical work, calling it 4 S – Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome [4]. Both terms \nfor this condition are present in the literature, however, ‛misophonia’ is more common.\nIn recent years, a growing interest in this condition among researchers has con-\ntributed to new knowledge and awareness of this extremely disruptive affliction. \nThe scientific work performed to date has identified new areas for future research and \nprovided clinicians with the fundamentals to take into consideration this currently \nmarginalized phenomenon. Though the problem of misophonia has already been \naddressed by Polish authors [5, 6], there has been no systematic theoretical review on \nthis phenomenon in the Polish language.\nMisophonia – general characteristics\nMisophonia is a set of symptoms which some people experience when exposed \nto certain sounds. Strong emotions such as anger, irritation, disgust, or anxiety are \nevoked immediately when people with misophonia hear particular sounds [7–11]. \nSomatic responses are also present – pressure in the chest, arms, head, or the whole \nbody, as well as increased heart rate, increased body temperature, physical pain, or \ndifficulties with breathing [8]. Dozier [3, 12], based on research conducted by his \ngroup, postulates the inclusion of muscle constriction (varying between individuals) \nas one of the main symptoms of misophonia, in addition to unpleasant emotional \nreactions. Sufferers consider these difficult emotions to be unwanted, uncontrolled, \nand excessive [10]. These feelings are often accompanied by a desire to violate the \n‛source’ of the sound and various thoughts such as “I hate this person” [8]. Sometimes, \na strong uncontrolled emotional experience leads to verbal and physically aggressive \noutbursts [8, 10]. These are, however, rare cases. Jastreboff and Jastreboff [7] claim \nthat the reaction is influenced by one’s history, subjective assessment of the sound, \nbeliefs about possible danger, psychological profile, and the context in which the sound \nappears. This opinion is consistent with the results of Edelstein et al. [8] which found \nthat the majority of subjects said that their reactions tend to be limited to members of \ntheir family or coworkers, and that they do not experience misophonic reactions if the \nsound is made by a child or an animal.\nIt is not known what fraction of the population suffers from misophonia (all the \nmore so, given that there is no agreement on what misophonia really is), but it is \npossible to infer that the number is significant. An estimate based on data gathered \nby the Emory Tinnitus and Hyperacusis Center shows that around 3% can have \nmisophonia [2]. It is possible, however, that the numbers are even higher. The data \non decreased sound tolerance (including misophonia) shows a prevalence of up to \n15% [13]. Additionally, according to Jastreboff and Jastreboff [2], 92% of people \nwith decreased sound tolerance have misophonia. The suggestion that there is \na large number of people with misophonia is supported by data from research on"

Over the course of 5 years, almost 500 people with misophonia \ncontacted a clinic in Amsterdam [9]. Almost 20% of 483 American students of psy-\nchology [14] and 17% of 415 Chinese students [15] declared they suffered negative \nconsequences from misophonic symptoms in their daily lives (the questionnaire used \nin this research is described below). Therefore, it seems that misophonia might be \na significant social problem.\nDifferential diagnosis and comorbidity with other disorders\nDespite the disagreements among researchers about the specifics of misophonia, \npreliminary identification is possible in both research as well as in clinical practice as \nthe differences in the proposed diagnostic criteria are not very significant. Misophonia \nis not included in any diagnostic classification and in spite of growing knowledge \non this phenomenon it is still not defined enough to include it soon in any of them. \nIn 2013, based on the available research data, Schröder et al. [10] defined misophonia \nas follows:\nA. The presence or anticipation of a specific sound, produced by a human be-\ning (e.g., eating sounds, breathing sounds) provokes an impulsive aversive \nphysical reaction which starts with irritation or disgust that instantaneously \nbecomes anger.\nB. This anger initiates a profound sense of loss of self-control with rare but po-\ntentially aggressive outbursts.\nC. The person recognizes that the anger or disgust is excessive, unreasonable, or \nout of proportion to the circumstances or the provoking stressor.\nD. The individual tends to avoid the misophonic situation, or if he/she does not \navoid it, endures encounters with the misophonic sound situation with intense \ndiscomfort, anger or disgust.\nE. The individual’s anger, disgust or avoidance causes significant distress (i.e., \nit bothers the person that he or she has the anger or disgust) or significant \ninterference in the person’s day-to-day life. For example, the anger or disgust \nmay make it difficult for the person to perform important tasks at work, meet \nnew friends, attend classes, or interact with others.\nF. The person’s anger, disgust, and avoidance are not better explained by another \ndisorder, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (e.g., disgust in someone \nwith an obsession about contamination) or post-traumatic stress disorder (e.g., \navoidance of stimuli associated with a trauma related to threatened death, \nserious injury or threat to the physical integrity of self or others).\nIn 2017, Dozier et al. [12] proposed another set of criteria for misophonia:\nA. The presence or anticipation of a specific sensory experience such as a sound, \nsight, or other stimulus (e.g., eating sounds, breathing sounds, machine \nsounds, leg movement, vibration), provokes an impulsive, aversive physical"

The stimulus elicits an immediate physical reflex response (skeletal or internal \nmuscle action, sexual response, warmth, pain, or other physical sensation). \nNote the physical response cannot always be identified, but the presence of \nan immediate physical response may be used to more clearly identify the \ncondition as misophonia.\nC. A moderate duration of the stimulus (e.g., 15 s) elicits general physiological \narousal (e.g., sweating, increased heart rate, muscle tension).\nD. Dysregulation of thoughts and emotions with rare but potentially aggressive \noutbursts. Aggressive outbursts may be frequent in children.\nE. The negative emotional experience is later recognized as excessive, unrea-\nsonable, or disproportionate to the circumstances or the provoking stressor.\nF. The individual tends to avoid the misophonic situation, or if he/she does \nnot avoid it, endures the misophonic stimulus situation with discomfort or \ndistress.\nG. The individual’s emotional and physical experience, avoidance, and efforts \nto avoid cause significant distress or significant interference in the person’s \nlife. For example, it is difficult for the person to perform tasks at work, attend \nclasses, participate in routine activities, or interact with specific individuals.\nAlthough both suggested criteria were based on research results and case studies \nof people with misophonia, neither was entirely verified empirically. The criteria \nproposed by Dozier undoubtedly indicate a new perspective in misophonia research. \nDozier emphasizes that misophonia should be seen as a multi-sensory phenomenon, \nas the trigger stimuli are not necessarily sounds but can also be, for example, another \nperson’s movement or a  vibration. However, because of limited data, these suggestions \nshould be treated as a hypothesis to verify.\nThere are currently no published, validated questionnaires for detecting misophonia \nbased on the proposed criteria. There are, however, some other unvalidated scales and \nquestionnaires for assessing it.\nSchröder’s research group [10] created a scale to measure the intensity of miso-\nphonia, the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S), which was adapted from the \nobsessive-compulsive disorders assessment scale (Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive \nScale – Y-BOCS). It consists of 6 questions related to time taken up by misophonia \nduring the day, influence on social functioning, anger intensity, efforts to inhibit the \nimpulse, control over the anger, as well as thoughts and time spent on avoiding miso-\nphonia-related situations. There are 5 levels of misophonia intensity, based on score.\nAnother questionnaire (Misophonia Questionnaire – MQ) for identifying miso-\nphonia and assessing its intensity was created by Wu et al. [14]. It consists of 3 scales:\n1) the Misophonia Symptom Scale, which includes sounds made by people, sounds \nfrom one’s surroundings as well as repetitive and once-off sounds;"

Psychometric analysis showed that the tool \nhas high internal consistency. The questionnaire has some limitations. The authors as-\nsessed its psychometric properties on the research group and the external validity was \ncorrelated with questionnaires that assess general sensory sensitivity (including sound \nsensitivity), but not misophonia. However, better assessment of the external validity \nwas not possible as the study had been performed before the first paper with criteria \nfor misophonia was published. Moreover, among the sounds classified as misophonic \nwere repetitive sounds (repeated many times over a longer period of time), which are \nnot included in either criteria proposed by Schröder et al. [10] or Dozier et al. [12] \n(the misophonic reaction should be immediate, impulsive, and not evoked only if the \nsound does not fade). The analysis also included sounds made by things (non-human \nsounds), which are still a controversial issue. Additionally, some people with hypera-\ncusis might be misclassified as having misophonia.\nMisophonic reaction is selective and is not related to hearing impairment [7]. \nIt should be differentiated from hyperacusis, however, those two condition can exist \ntogether. People with hyperacusis exhibit aversive reactions towards sounds character -\nized by certain physical properties, such as volume or frequencies, and their emotional \nresponses are consistent, not dependant on social situations. Audiological assessment \nshows that these patients usually have a lower loudness discomfort level (LDD) [16]. \nIn misophonia, there is an unnaturally strong, negative emotional reaction to specific \nsounds, unique to each individual. The acoustic features of the triggers may vary, but \nthey tend to be rather soft and low [7]. Therefore misophonia is not an intolerance \nof loud sounds or noise. It is critical to assess what kind of sounds are aversive to \nthe individual and what kind of sounds are tolerated. Importantly, misophonia and \nhyperacusis can be present together [2, 7]. Jastreboff and Jastreboff [2] claim that the \nemotions which are experienced by individuals when exposed to aversive triggers \nare identical in both misophonia and hyperacusis. However, this has not yet been \nconfirmed empirically.\nSince research began on misophonia, one of the main areas of interest has been its \ncomorbidity with other disorders. In 2013, Schröder et al. [10] suggested that misopho-\nnia could be included in the obsessive-compulsive disorder spectrum because of the \ncharacteristic obsessionality, impulsivity and compulsivity associated with misophonia. \nSome comorbid disorders were identified among the patients examined by Schröder \n– obsessive-compulsive personality (over 50%), mood disorders, Tourette syndrome, \nADHD, trichotillomania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and hypochondria. One ob-\njection against the data gathered by Schröder is the recruitment of an unrepresentative \ngroup of patients with psychiatric disorders [2]. In 2014, Wu [14] assessed 483 students"

Analysis of the data showed moderate, significant correla -\ntion of the intensity of misophonia with OCD and depression. Interestingly, anxiety \n(assessed with the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 – DASS-21) was a mediator \nbetween misophonia (measured with the Misophonia Symptom Scale ) and aggressive \noutbursts (assessed with the Rage Outbursts and Anger Rating Scale – ROARS) evoked \nby exposure to aversive triggers.\nA recent study by Rouw and Erfanian [18], on the other hand, did not show \nan increased occurrence of any particular disorder among people with misophonia. \nInstead, a higher intensity of symptoms of misophonia in people with post-traumatic \nstress disorder was found in comparison to people with other disorders. McKay et al. \n[19] assessed a non-clinical group with a battery of many tests to measure various \npsychological disorders and traits potentially related to misophonia. They found three \ndistinct profiles, of which only one differentiated between people with and without \nmisophonia (barely accounting for 11% of the total variance). The profile was related \nto lower results on the scales of neutralizing, washing, and general symptoms of OCD \n(the Obsessive Compulsive Inventory–Revised was used [20]) as well as higher results \non ordering and harm avoidance scales (the Obsessive-Compulsive Trait Core Dimen-\nsions Questionnaire was used [21]). The authors came to the conclusion that in spite of \nthe previously mentioned relations with OCD, 70% of the variance in the model was \nexplained by two profiles that did not differentiate between people with and without \nmisophonia; therefore it is reasonable to claim that misophonia is not unambiguously \nbound to any other pathology, but is rather a unique set of symptoms.\nIt is characteristic for people with misophonia to experience sudden, uncontrol -\nlable, strong emotions together with a tendency to avoidance. Therefore, it could be \nmisdiagnosed with a  specific phobia. Nevertheless, the reaction cannot be classified as \na phobia because the dominant emotion in misophonia is anger, rather than fear [10]. \nThe term ‛phonophobia’ describes the condition where one is afraid of certain sounds \n[17]. However, this phenomenon is not well documented yet. Symptoms of people with \nmisophonia may also be similar to symptoms of social phobia. However, the reason \nfor avoiding other people by people with misophonia is not fear of judgment, but the \ndesire to protect themselves from the sounds that they make. It is important to take \ninto account the fact that no particular cognitive issues are reported among people with \nmisophonia, which differentiates it from dissociative and somatomorphic disorders. \nPeople with misophonia are aware of the fact that their reactions are exaggerated [10]. \nResearch shows [26] that people with misophonia process aversive sounds differently \nin their neurological connections. Despite the fact that it is not known whether this is \na cause or consequence of misophonia, for the purposes of research we can discuss \nit as a neurological correlates of the specific emotional reaction in people with miso-\nphonia. However, as already said, it is not unusual for misophonia to be present with \nother disorders [10, 14, 19]. It is worth mentioning that the literature also contains \ncase studies of people with misophonia and eating disorders [22]."

      "text": "453 Misophonia – a review of research results and theoretical concepts \nThe lack of diagnostic criteria for misophonia and validated questionnaires \nto detect and measure its intensity makes it difficult to compare the results from \nthe various research groups and make diagnoses in clinical work. The participants \nwho took part in published studies were recruited according to different theoretical \napproaches, and mostly did not go through a full psychiatric and audiological as-\nsessment. In many works only the self-report of the symptoms was used, therefore \nthe conclusions drawn from this data might have limited credibility and the results \ncannot be generalized to the whole population of people with a potential diagnosis \nof misophonia [23, 24].\nDispute about the nature of the aversive sounds\nIn the literature, there is disagreement over what kind of sounds should be cate -\ngorized as misophonic, a point which can impact the validity of a diagnosis and lead \nto different diagnoses being made by different specialists. Some authors [7, 25] claim \nthat any sound can be misophonic, regardless of its source – therefore including sounds \nmade by people, such as eating sounds, breathing, or snoring, and other sounds, for \nexample, a clock ticking, a toilet flushing, a vacuum cleaner working, a school bell \nringing, a pen tapping, or typing on a keyboard, etc. Other researchers consider only \nsounds made by people to be misophonic.\nIn an experiment conducted by Edelstein et al. [8] that measured skin galvanic \nreaction, among other things, the most aversive sounds were found to be those made by \npeople, e.g., eating and crunching sounds as well as snoring (11 people). Only 2 people \nindicated that the sounds they found most aversive were a pen clicking and a clock \nticking. Among the other subjects, the most common (but less unpleasant) aversive \nsounds were pen clicking, the sound of steps, typing, the sound of plastic bags, and \nrepetitive dog barking. For 6 people, the ‛s’ sound was unpleasant.\nThe results of Kumar’s work [26] also indicate that the strongest negative reactions \nare evoked by specific soft sounds made by humans. The analysis showed statistically \nsignificant differences in emotional arousal (measured with a galvanometer) and in \nheart rate (HR) between the following conditions: sounds of breathing and eating, \na woman screaming and a baby crying, and sounds made by non-humans – raining \nand a kettle whistling. The most aversive triggers were the sounds of breathing and \neating. The analysis of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data showed \nthat the sounds of eating and breathing greatly activated the anterior insular cortex, \nwhich is related to emotional regulation and the detection of signals that are important \nfor the individual from the surroundings.\nDescribing the characteristics of misophonic sounds seems to be crucial to un-\nderstanding the mechanism of misophonia, the data is increasingly showing that \nmisophonic trigger sounds are very individualized and dependent on personal history \nand social context."

      "text": "Marta Siepsiak, Wojciech Dragan454\nDeterminants of misophonia\nThe mechanisms underlying misophonia are still unknown [27]. That there is \na greater prevalence of decreased sound tolerance among people with genetic disorders \nsuggests the possibility of it having a genetic basis. In the study of Levitin et al. [28], \nincluding 118 people with Williams syndrome, 90.6% showed increased sensitivity \nto certain sounds, of which 14% were aversive towards the sounds made by people \nor animals. The same kind of sound intolerance was present in 27% of people with \nautism, 7% of people with Down syndrome, and 2% of people in the control group. \nThe authors, in order to distinguish aversiveness towards particular, selective sounds \nfrom the category of general sensitivity to sounds, created a category that they called \n‛auditory allodynia’. It was not named misophonia, maybe because at this time the \nterm ‛misophonia’ was not yet widely used, and apart from theoretical papers (e.g., \nJastreboff and Jastreboff [1]), no empirical studies on misophonia existed. The existence \nof decreased sound tolerance in the population of people with Williams syndrome is \nindicated, for example, by the results of the study conducted by Bloomberg et al. [29]. \nTo date, no genetic analyses concerning decreased sound tolerance have been conducted \non a population of people without additional disorders and illnesses.\nJastreboff and Jastreboff [7] claim that misophonia is related to a dysfunction of \nthe central auditory pathways. According to these authors, people with misophonia \nhave enhanced neural connections between the auditory and limbic systems for certain \nsounds. The previously mentioned research by Kumar et al. [26], published in 2017, \nseems to confirm the theory postulated by Jastreboff and Jastreboff [7]. It showed a dif-\nference in the processing of certain aversive sounds in functional neural connections \nbetween the anterior insular cortex and the regions related to emotional regulation as \nwell as greater myelination in the prefrontal cortex among people with misophonia. \nEarlier, Schröder et al. [30] published a study where they were the first to show the \nneurobiological mechanisms of misophonia. Using the event-related potential (ERP) in \nthe oddball paradigm, they showed a difference in N1 mean peak amplitude, a bioelec-\ntrical brain response related to early processing. People with misophonia had a lower \naverage mean peak than people from the control group.\nEdelstein et al. [8] notice a similarity between misophonia and synesthesia. They \npostulate that in the same way that sound can be associated with color, in misophonia, \ncertain sounds could be associated with a certain emotional reaction. Dozier instead \nproposed a theory saying that misophonia is formed by a process of classical condi-\ntioning [25], suggesting in the case studies that this reflex reaction might have been \ncreated, for example, by a quarrel while eating, or issues with sleeplessness which \nwere accompanied by a breathing sound. However, this has yet to be demonstrated. \nThe data on the causes of misophonia are still insufficient to determine whether it is \ninnate or acquired and the role of neurobiological and cognitive factors."

Comments on misophonia-related websites and forums \nindicate that misophonia often leads to social isolation, family conflicts, absconding \nfrom family meals and interactions with friends, or even separations and divorces. \nOne of the most frequently mentioned problems on internet forums is the lack of \nsupport among those closest to the person suffering from misophonia – their parents \nor partner. People with misophonia describe experiencing psychological abuse from \nfamily members – being called ‛mentally ill’, ‛crazy’, accusations of manipulation \nand ‘making up’ problems in order to attract attention or to distress other family \nmembers. Some people with misophonia also mention a fear of having children (they \nare afraid that their child might make aversive sounds). The experience of miso-\nphonia is linked to suffering and a significant decrease in quality of life [8, 10, 12]. \nIt is also known that the phenomenon is not a particularly rare problem [2, 14, 15]. \nTherefore, it seems that the issue of exploration of misophonia by both researchers \nand practitioners is a big challenge for contemporary psychology, psychiatry, audi-\nology, and other disciplines.\nDirections for further research\nMisophonia has become a more active area of research in recent years. However, \nthis phenomenon is still little known in the Polish scientific literature. Taylor [31] \nprioritizes the analysis of misophonia in the context of other sensory sensitivities, not \nonly auditory ones. Further exploration of its comorbidity with other disorders seems \nto be important as well. Rare reactions to trigger sounds, such as the experience of \nwarmth, pain, and sexual arousal [12], are another interesting avenue of investigation. \nOne of the lesser known, but more controversial, aspects are the mechanisms underlying \nmisophonia. Brout et al. [27] suggest avoiding preliminary classification of misophonia \nas a phenomenon dependent on genetics vs. a conditioned one. According to them, \nthis attitude can have a negative impact on the diagnosis and therapy of misophonia. \nIt seems important that tools for the diagnosis and measurement of the severity of miso-\nphonia be developed and validated. Detailed multidisciplinary diagnoses of research \nparticipants and the use of objective measurement tools (in contrast to self-descriptive \nquestionnaires) in our opinion is crucial for further research on misophonia. Only this \nwill allow the comparison of analyses from different research groups.\nConclusions\nIn spite of the lack of official diagnostic criteria for misophonia and the conten -\ntion around its definition, in light of the discussed research results it is reasonable to"
