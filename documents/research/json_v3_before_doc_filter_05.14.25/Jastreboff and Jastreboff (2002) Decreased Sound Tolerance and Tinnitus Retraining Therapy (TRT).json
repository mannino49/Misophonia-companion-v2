      "text": "74 Decreased Sound Tolerance and Tinnitus \nRetraining Therapy (TRT) \nMARGARET M. JASTREBOFF AND PAWEL J. JASTREBOFF \nEmory Univ~rsity School of Medicine, Atlanta, USA \nThe main objective of Tinnitus Retraining Therapy \n(TRT) is habituation of activation of the autonomic \nnervous system, evoked by signals present in the \nauditory pathways. Sound therapy aims at decreasing \nthe strength of these signals. The same systems in the \nbrain are involved in tinnitus and decreased sound \ntolerance, and the same basic neurophysiological \nmechanisms are utilised for decreasing the tinnitus­\nrelated neuronal activity and, in case of hyperacusis, \nabnormally enhanced activity induced by external \nsounds. The similarity of TRT treatment between \ntinnitus and misophonia is even closer, as in both \nsituations the goal is to achieve extinction of \nfunctional connections between the auditory and the \nlimbic and autonomic nervous systems. The increased \ngain within the auditory pathways that are presum­\nably responsible for hyperacusis could enhance the \ntinnitus signal, thus it is possible to expect coexis­\ntence of tinnitus and hyperacusis, and the predisposi­\ntion of hyperacusis patients to develop tinnitus. As \nsuch, for some patients tinnitus and hyperacusis may \nbe considered the double manifestation of the same \ninternal phenomenon. \nTinnitus perception is not governed by the \nsame principles as perception of external \nsounds. Its suppression is not frequency \ndependent and does not show presence of the \ncritical band, with contralateral suppression \nfrequently being at least as effective as ipsilat­\neral (Feldmann, 1971, 1988). It is impossible \nto observe beats of tinnitus with external \ntones, and to re-synthesise tinnitus by any \ncombination of external sounds (Penner, \n1993). These observations yielded a postulate that tinnitus is a phantom auditory perception \n(i.e., it is a real perception of a sound for which \nthere is no corresponding physical correlate) \n(Jastreboff, 1990). \nClinically-significant tinnitus (i.e., creating \nproblems to an extent that subjects are seeking \nprofessional help) involve a number of systems \nin the brain. Since patients perceive tinnitus as \na sound, therefore the tinnitus-related neuronal \nactivity is present within the auditory path­\nways. The symptoms which patients experi­\nence (anxiety, annoyance , strong emotional \nreactions), strongly suggest that the limbic and \nautonomic nervous systems are involved as \nwell, and that activation of these systems is \nresponsible for tinnitus becoming clinically­\nsignificant. Recent studies, using variety of \ntechniques, strongly supported this postulate \n(Lockwood et aI., 1996; Lockwood et aI., \n1998; Langner & Wallhdusser-Franke, 1999; \nAndersson et aI., 2000; Mirz et aI., 2000; \nLockwood et aI., 2001). \nThese concepts were developed in the 80s, \npublished in 1990 (J astreboff, 1990), and are \npresently known as the neurophysiological \nmodel of tinnitus. The model postulates the \ninvolvement of both auditory and non-auditory \nsystems in cases of clinically-significant tinni­\ntus. In these cases, the focus of attention is \npredominantly on the neurophysiology of the \nlimbic and autonomic nervous systems, with \nthe auditory system playing only secondary \nrole in reactions to tinnitus. Part of the model is \ndevoted to neurophysiological mechanisms, \nCorrespondence and reprint requests: Pawel J.

There is a consensus \nthat auditory systems display an automatic gain \ncontrol mechanism, and its sensitivity depends \non the average environmental sound level. \n. Experimental results have shown that the sensi-\ntivity of the single neurons and their assembles \nin the auditory pathways indeed increases \nwhen sound level is low, when conductive \nhearing loss is induced, and finally when the \ncochlea is partially or totally damaged \n(Gerken, 1979; Sasaki et al., 1980; Gerken et \naI., 1984; Gerken et aI., 1985; Gerken et al., \n1986; Salvi et aI., 1992; Salvi et aI., 1996). \nOn the other hand, the observation that \n94% of subjects developed tinnitus when \nstaying in the anechoic chamber for few \nminutes (Heller & Bergman, 1953), collabo­\nrated the possibility that enhanced sensitivity \nof the peripheral and central part of the \nauditory system could contribute to tinnitus \n(lastreboff, 1990). It is possible to envision, \nthat in some cases tinnitus and decreased \nsound tolerance are two manifestations of the \nsame internal phenomenon of increased gain \nwithin the auditory pathways (Jastreboff, \n1990; lastreboff & Hazell, 1993b). This \nhypothesis yielded in tum a prediction that \nsubstantial proportions of tinnitus patients \nshould exhibit decreased sound tolerance as \nwell. This postulate was in contrast to litera­\nture stating that only 0.1 % of tinnitus \npatients showed symptoms of hyperacusis \n(Vernon, 1987). This was rather surprising, \nas analysis of physiological mechanisms of \nthe neurophysiological model of tinnitus \nsuggested that the same ne(works are \ninvolved in tinnitus and some components of \ndecreased sound tolerance. \nThe only approach to test if these theoreti­\ncal predictions were correct was by evaluat­\ning tinnitus patients for their sound tolerance . \nWhile there is no consensus regarding a \nprotocol for the evaluation of decreased \nsound tolerance, there is a general agreement \nthat pure tone loudness discomfort level (LDL) provides a reasonable estimation of \nthe problem. From 1990, both at University \nof Maryland at Baltimore and at Emory \nUniversity in Atlanta, we were routinely \nevaluating LDL in all new patients, and \nduring some follow-up visits. High preva­\nlence of decreased sound tolerance was \nevident from the results of the first group of \npatients (Jastreboff et aI., 1994) and \nindicated that it might affect about 40% of \ntinnitus patients, with approximately 30% \nrequiring specific treatment for hyperacusis \n(Jastreboff et aI., 1999; lastreboff & lastre­\nboff 2000; lastreboff & lastreboff, 2002). \nThis observation has been confirmed by \nother centers (Coles & Sood, 1988; Hazell & \nSheldrake 1992; Lux-Wellenhof, 1999; \nFabijanska et al.; 1999; Gold et aI., 1999; \nPilgrarnrn et aI., 1999; Gold et aI., 2002). \nDecreased sound tolerance can have an \nextremely strong impact on patients' lives. It \ncan prevent pe9ple from working, social \ninteraction, or participating in variety of \npleasant life activities. In extreme cases, \ndecreased sound tolerance can totally control \npatients' lives. Some patients do not even \nleave their homes. Not only their lives, but \nalso their families' are totally controlled by \nthe issue of avoidance of sound. \nThe most recent results from a group of \n149 consecutive patients seen at Emory \nTinnitus and Hyperacusis Center in Atlanta \nconfirmed high level of prevalence of \ndecreased sound tolerance in tinnitus \npatients. For each patient, during the initial \nvisit the pure tone LDL were evaluated for \nboth ears, for frequencies 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, \n12 kHz. The average value of LDL for all \nfrequencies and both ears, was calculated for \neach patient. The mean LDL value for all \npatients was 88.66 dB HL with standard \ndeviation equal to 17.85 dB. \nThe cumulative distribution of the data \n(Figure 1) provides more insight into the \npatients' status: 62.4% of all patients have an \naverage LDL value below 100 dB HL, \n58.4% below 95 dB HL, 38.3% below 90 dB \nHL, and 22.8% below 80 dB HL.

These data \nare consistent with our past results where \nthe average level below 100 dB HL was \nsuggested as a indicator of potential problems \n(Jastreboff & Hazell, 1993a), while an average \nvalue below 90 dB HL indicates the need \nfor a specific treatment because of decreased \nsound tolerance. \nWhile average values of LDL provide some \nguideline for diagnosis, individual data show \nlarge variability, and patients' complaints \ndo not simplistically correlate with values \nof LDL. Some patients with normal values \nof LDL exhibit strong reactions to everyday \nsounds (acceptable by others in their \nsurrounding), which significantly affect their \nlife. Other patients, with LDL in the range of \n90 dB HL, do not report any noticeable \nimpact on life by these sounds. Another \ngroup may have LDL in the range of 20-40 \ndB HL but, while reporting the problem of \nthe decreased sound tolerance, nevertheless they are able to tolerate some louder than \nindicated by LDL sounds (e.g., normal level \nof speech). Many patients exhibit a different \nlevel of tolerance to various sounds, which \ndoes not correspond to physical characterisa­\ntion of these sounds (i.e., their spectrum and \noverall intensity). \nThe simplest assumption that patients have \nphonophobia was difficult to accept. The \nmajority 'of these patient~ do not show \nelements of a classical phobia, and further­\nmore they are not afraid of sound but rather \nexpress negative feelings and dislike of \nsound. The analysis of potential neurophysi­\nological mechani~ms underlying reactions of \npeople to sound, resulted in the conclusion \nthat the same systems in the brain are \ninvolved in tinnitus and in decreased sound \ntolerance (see Figure 2). \nConsidering potential neurophysiological \nmechariisms involved in processing of signals \nwithin the auditory pathways, and interaction \nof the auditory with other systems in the brain, \nwe proposed that decreased sound tolerance \nactually consists of two components: (a) \nhyperacusis which reflects abnormally strong \nreactivity of the auditory pathways to sound, \nI Auditory & Other Cortical Areas I Perception & Evaluation (Consciousness, Memory, Attention) \n:t · . · . 1 ~ \nAuditory ~ Limbic System . : :'l Reactions I Subconscious Emotions \nDetection / Processing : ! \nII · . · . · : .: \nl~uditOry periPhe~1 I Autonomic Nervous System I .

JASTREBOFF \nfor proper treatment of patients with tinnitus \nand decreased sound tolerance it is important \nto identify and characterise the hyperacusis \ncomponent, as it has to be treated first. \nThere are several variations of clinical \nprotocols for establishing LDLs with various \nstimuli (e.g., continuous or pulsed, beeps of \nsound, pure tones or narrow band noise) \n(Ricketts & Bentler, 1996; Cox et aI., 1997). \nThe approach we advocate incorporates \nmodifications of standard procedures aimed \nat decreasing the effects of misophonic and \nphonophobic components to a minimum. To \nminimise the impact of these components, \nand to assess as closely as possible the \npresence and the extent of hyperacusis, \ntesting is conducted in such a manner that the \npatients are aware that they have real full \ncontrol over the maximal sound level to \nwhich they will be exposed. Moreover, \ntesting is performed in a manner allowing \npatients to become familiar with the proce­\ndure and consequently decrease the anxiety \nand concerns patients may have regarding \nLDL evaluation . Therefore, we introduced \nseveral modifications to standard LDL \nprocedure aimed at decreasing the impact of \nthe misophonic component on LDL values. \nEvery patient is getting a very specific set \nof instructions regarding testing procedure, \nand sound level when response is expected. \nThe measurements of LDL are performed \nusing short pure tones, with the initial level \nbelow threshold of hearing and increased in \n5 dB (or 1 dB -typically) increments. \nTesting is performed at the previously \nmentioned frequencies, and all frequencies \nare tested twice (i.e., after performing testing \nfor all frequencies the testing is repeated). \nOnly the second set is recorded on an audio­\ngram. It is common for misophonic patients \nto have the first set of measurements 10-15 \ndB lower than the second set. While this \nprotocol does not assure total removal of \nthe misophonic component, it decreases its \nimpact on final LDL. As a' result the \nmeasurements are more stable, and there is \nhigh test-retest repeatability. In the presented group of patients, 65.8% \nreported some problem with sound tolerance \n(average LDL = 81.7 dB HL), and 66.4% \nwere diagnosed with decreased sound toler­\nance (LDL = 82.2 dB HL). However, only \n32.9% of all patients were diagnosed with \nhyperacusis requiring specific treatment \n(average LDL = 73.5 dB HL). While 57.0% \nwere diagnosed with misophonia (LDL = \n81.9 dB HL), only 28.9% had pure misopho­\nnia without hyperacusis (LDL = 92.8 dB HL). \nFinally, 2.7% had only decreased sound toler­\nance and no tinnitus (LDL = 85.0 dB HL) \n(see Table 1). \nPatients with significant hyperacusis \ntypically develop misophonia as well. Since \nLDLs represent an estimation of a sum of \nhyperacusis and misophonia, as expected the \naverage LDLs for patients with hyperacusis, \nsome of whom have misophonia as well, was \nthe lowest. Note, that all LDLs values tend to \nbe around 80 dB HL, for patients exhibiting \nsome problems with decreased sound toler­\nance, suggesting 80-85 dB HL as an indica­\ntor of the need for sound tolerance treatment. \nIt is important to recognise, that neither \nhyperacusis, misophonia nor phonophobia \nhave any relation to hearing thresholds, and \nTABLE I \nDecreased Sound Tolerance and LDL in Discussed \nPatients' Population \nSubgroups % of LDL \npopulation (dB HL) \nSubjective DST 65.8 81.7 \nDiagnosed DST 66.4 82.2 \nDiagnosed with misophonia \n(with or without hyperacusis) 57.0 81.9 \nDiagnosed with misophonia \n(no hyperacusis) 28.9 92.8 \nDiagnosed with hyperacusis \n(with or without misophonia) 32.9 73.5 \nDiagnosed with hearing loss \nand hyperacusis 17.4 75.6 \nDiagnosed with DST \n(no tinnitus) 2.7 85.0 \nNote: Data from 149 consecutive patients.

These \nphenomena are not related to recruitment. \n/ Recruitment results from the elevated thresh­\nold of hearing, and is governed by purely \nperipheral mechanisms resulting from loss of \nouter hair cells (OHC) in the cochlea. On the \nother hand the mechanisms of hyperacusis \ncan be peripheral, central, or mixed, and \nmisophonia always involves only central \nmechanisms. Potential peripheral mecha­\nnisms of hyperacusis might involve dysfunc­\ntion of the mechanisms controlling decrease \nof the OHC produced amplification with the \nincrease of a sound level or abnormally high \nainplification provide by OHC. Indeed, in \nsome patients there is an indication of \ninappropriate functioning of OHC system, as \nevaluated by distortion product otoacoustic \nemission. Central mechanisms of hyperacu­\nsis might involve the increase of the sensitiv­\nity of neurons in the central auditory \npathways after decreased auditory input \n(dorsal cochlear nuclei, inferior colliculi) \n(Gerken, 1979; Sasaki, Kauer, & Babitz, \n1980; Gerken, Saunders, & Paul, 1984; \nGerken, Simhadri-Sumithra, & Bhat, 1986; \nSalvi, Wang, & Powers, 1996). \nPotential mechanisms of misophonia might \ninvolve an abnormally strong functional \nconnection between the limbic system and \nthe auditory system, or abnormally high \ntonic activation of the limbic system. Most \nfrequently, significantly decreased sound \ntolerance results from a combination of \nhyperacusis and misophonia. \nOur data confirm a lack of relationship \nbetween decreased sound tolerance and \nhearing. There is rather common opinion that \nhyperacusis is presented only, or predomi­\nnantly in people with normal hearing. \nContrary to this belief, our results show that \n55.5% of patients requiring treatment for \nhyperacusis had hearing loss as well. \nAt the same time, in the population of \npatients with hearing loss (91 subjects) \n62.6% reported decreased sound tolerance, \n57.0% were diagnosed with misophonia, and \n29.7% with hyperacusis. 72.5% had high frequency hearing loss, 5.5% conductive and \n22.0% other type. \nAt this moment, it appears to be a consen­\nsus that decreased sound tolerance affects a \nsignificant proportion of tinnitus patients and \nof the general population . In this study \n65.8% of tinnitus patients exhibited some \ndegree of decreased sound tolerance, with \n32.9% requiring specific treatment for hyper­\nacusis. Therefore, assuming that approxi­\nmately 30% of tinnitus patients require \ntreatment for hyperacusis, considering that \n86% of hyperacusis patients reported tinnitus \n(Anari et aI., 1999), and accepting that about \n4% of general population have clinically \nsignificant tinnitus, it is possible to extrapo­\nlate that significant hyperacusis probably \nexists in at least 1.4% of the general popula­\ntion, and decreased sound tolerance affects a \nproportion twice as large. \nData from an epidemiological study \nperformed in Poland on 10,349 subjects \nstrongly suggest that this assessment might \nbe highly conservative, as 15.2% of subjects \nreported decreased sound tolerance (Fabijan­\nska, Rogowski, Bartnik, & Skarzynski, \n1999). Notably, tinnitus data from the same \npopulation are in agreement with findings \nfrom other studies (i.e., 20.1 % of subjects \nexperienced tinnitus lasting more than 5 \nminutes, 5.4% reported clinically-significant \ntinnitus for which they seek professional help \nand 40% of tinnitus patients reported hypera­\ncusis as well). \nIn the majority of cases the etiology of \nhyperacusis is unknown. Hyperacusis has been \nlinked to sound exposure (particularly short, \nimpulse noise), head injury, stress, medica­\ntions, and a number of medical conditions \nsuch as tinnitus, Bell's palsy, Lyme Disease, \nWilliams Syndrome, Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, \nfailed stapedectomy, perilymphatic fistula, \nhead injury, migraine, depression, withdrawal \nfrom benzodiazepines, increased Cerebral \nSpinal Fluid (CSF) pressure and Addison's \ndisease (Katznell & Segal, 2001; J astreboff & \nJastreboff, 2002).

Sound therapy for treatment of hyperacu­\nsis has several differences, as compared with \nsound therapy used for tinnitus. Avoidance of \nsilence and continued exposure to background \nsound is even more important than for tinnitus \npatients. The sound level from sound genera­\ntors needs to be closer monitored (which \nresults in standard for recommendation using \nsound generators), and may require modifica­\ntion during the treatment. \nThe desensitisation approach has been \npromoted for some time with a variety of \nprotocols and types of sounds utilised; such \nas the recommendation of using sound with \ncertain frequencies removed , short exposures \nto moderately loud sound, or prolonged \nexposures to low level sounds (Vernon & \nPress, 1998). According to principles of the \nneurophysiological model of tinnitus, desen­\nsitisation is recommended and it is used as a \npart of TRT (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2000). \nBoth theory and our results of treatment of \nhyperacusis were presented already (Jastre­\nboff et aI., 1996a; Jastreboff et aI., 1996b; \nJastreboff et aI., 1998; Jastreboff 1998). \nHowever , the misophonic component \ncannot be removed by desensitisation and a \nseparate approach needs to be implemented. \nRecognising the similarity of neural networks \ninvolved in tinnitus and misophonia and the \ninvolvement of conditioned reflexes we \npromote a method based on active extinction \nof conditioned reflexes (Konorski, 1948; \nKonorski, 1967), which involves systematic \nexposure of patients to sounds associated \nwith a pleasant situation, with gradually \nincreasing sound levels. A handout with \nprotocol for misophonia, as given to patients, \nis shown in the Appendix. Both, desensitisation and active extinction \nprocess produce effects relatively fast and, \ntypically , patients with decreased sound \ntolerance show fast recovery, with a number \nof them reaching the maximal levels of \nsound allowed for testing LDLs without \nexperiencing discomfort. Effectively, it is \npossible to achieve not only improvement, \nbut a cure for decreased sound tolerance in a \nsignificant proportion of patients. If only \nhyperacusis is treated without recognising \nand treating misophonia results are unpre­\ndictable and recovery might take a long time, \nor even treatment might be unsuccessful. \nAs most frequently significantly decreased \nsound tolerance results from a combination \nof hyperacusis and misophoniaJphonophobia, \nit. is important to assess the presence and the \nextent of both hyperacusis and rnisophonia in \neach patient (Jastreboff, Jastreboff, & \nSheldrake, 1999; Jastreboff & Jastreboff, \n2000), as they need to be treated using differ­\nent methods (J astreboff & J as treb off, 2001; \nJastreboff & Jastreboff, 2002). After a \ndetailed interview and audiological testing, a \nmedical evaluation is advisable to rule out \nmedical conditions, which might be related \nto tinnitus or decreased sound tolerance. \nIn conclusion , several issues are worth \npointing out. The same systems in the brain \nare involved in tinnitus and decreased sound \ntolerance, and the neurophysiological model \nof tinnitus provides theoretical guidance for \ntreatment of both conditions. Basically, the \nmain difference between tinnitus and \nmisophonia is that in the case of tinnitus \nthere is no external sound, and the tinnitus \nsignal is stable. However , for both phenom­\nena, the same neuronal pathways are \nactivated, with the final product being activa­\ntion of the sympathetic part of the autonomic \nnervous system, which in tum is responsible \nfor behaviourally observed problems . \nAnalysis of the neural mechanisms respon­\nsible for hyperacusis and misophonia \nsuggests specific clinical approaches aimed \nat removing these problems. In the case of \npure hyperacusis , where the problem is \nconstrained to the auditory pathways and"

This \napproach would not work for misophonia \nwhere conditioned reflexes linking the \nauditory with the limbic and autonomic \nnervous systems play a cr~cial role. In the \ncase of misophonia the reflexes are the same, \nwith substitution of an internally generated \nsignal (tinnitus) by a variety of external \nsounds (misophonia). \nFor both tinnitus and hyperacusis, part of \nthe problem arises from the presence of \nunusual activity within the auditory \npathways: for tinnitus -an abnormal, \ntypically weak neuronal activity; for pure \nhyperacusis -abnormally enhanced \nneuronal activity induced by external sounds. \nFor both tinnitus and hyperacusis, the \nproblem arises from overactivation of the \nautonomic nervous system by these signals. \nIn the case of misophonia, the activity within \nthe auditory system is normal, but it causes \nabnormal activation of the limbic and \nautonomic nervous systems. \nTRT is aimed at habituation of activation of \nautonomic nervous system evoked by the \nsignal present in the auditory pathways, and a \npart of protocol (sound therapy) aims at \ndecreasing the strength of this signal. In the \ncase of tinnitus, the strength of the tinnitus­\nrelated neuronal activity is directly decreased \nby increasing background neuronal activity. \nThis is accomplished by exposing the patient to \nadditional external sounds. Sounds used to \nprovide this additional auditory background \nshould not induce annoyance or aIlY other \nnegative reactions. These sounds decrease the \noverall gain of the auditory system as well. In \nthe case of hyperacusis, a partial decrease of \nthe signal strength is achieved immediately, \ndue to the same principle of difference with \nbackground. For example, measurements of \nLDLs, while the patient is provided with sound \nfrom sound generators, -result in higher values \nof LDLs. It is common for hyperacusis patients \nto note immediate protective properties of \nsound from sound generators . We recommend increasing the sound level of sound generators \nwhen patients expect to be in a louder environ­\nment. As amplification of the sound-induced \nneuronal activity in the case of significant \nhyperacusis appears to be relatively large, the \nmain effect of desensitisation is a gradual \ndecrease of this gain, typically achieved in a \nspan of several weeks or months. \nNevertheless, for both tinnitus and hypera­\ncusis the aim of TR T is to decrease the \nstrength of neuronal activity within auditory \npathways and to eliminate activation of the \nautonomic nervous system. The similarity of \nTRT treatment between tinnitus and \nmisophonia is even closer. In both cases, the \nsignal coming from the auditory system to \nthe limbic and autonomic nervous systems is \nweak (in case of tinnitus), or normal (for \nmisophonia). However, abnormal amplifica­\ntion of these signals, occurring at the connec­\ntions between the auditory, the limbic and \nautonomic nervous systems, is responsible \nfor the problem. TRT is aimed at elimination \nof these functional connections, that is, an \nextinction of conditioned reflexes linking \nthese systems (habituation of reactions). The \nmain difference between tinnitus and \nmisophonia is that we can manipulate exter­\nnal sounds (but not tinnitus). Therefore, it is \npossible to implement a more powerful \nmethod of active extinction of these condi­\ntioned reflexes by associating sounds with \npositive reward. This is impossible in the \ncase of tinnitus where the more cumbersome \nmethod of possible extinction is utilised. \nNevertheless, the basics of the methods are \nidentical for tinnitus and misophonia. \nAn interesting aspect of decreased sound \ntolerance is that affected subjects typically \nhave a tendency to notice, and to be aware of \nsomatosounds (e.g., swallowing, chewing, \njaw movements), as well as external sounds, \nwith patients concentrating on all sounds. \nThis is tum, causes patients to avoid sound, \nenhances tendency to remain in silence, and \noverprotect their ears. All these factors, \nresult in further enhancement of misophonia, \nhyperacusis, and tinnitus. TRT results in \nhabituation of perception of these sounds \n81"

JASTREBOFF \nAPPENDIX \nTREATMENT OF MISOPHONIA \nMisophonia (dislike of sound) is treated by training involving engagement in \nactivities which you enjoy, and which have sound as an inevitable component. \nThe main concept is to create association of sound with a pleasant situation. \nThis can be achieved by engaging in activities which you like, and which have \nsound as an indispensable part, such as listening to music, shopping in a mall, \ngoing to parties, restaurants and so forth. You should always have a full control \nover the situation and to be able to discontinue sound exposure at any time, if you \nwould like to (for example, listening to music at home but not going to a concert). \nThe most common method is to listen to music at home. In this case, you \nshould select your most favourite type of music and listen to it attentively once I \ntwice every single day for 20-40 minutes. The music should have reasonably \nstable level without going from very quiet to very loud. \nThe treatment consists of 3-week cycles, repeated as many times as it is \nneeded. \nFor the first week, the sound volume should be set every day for the most \ncomfortable level. \nFor the second week, the level should be increased by one just noticeable step \nlouder than the most comfortable level for a given day. \nFor the third week, sound volume should be increased by another step, that is, \nsound is initially set at most comfortable level and then increased by two just \nnoticeable steps louder. \nThen this 3-week cycle is repeated."
