Future interdisciplinary \nwork should clarify the mechanisms of misophonia, establish evidence-based treatments, and extend these \nfindings to randomly sampled and more culturally diverse populations.   \n1.Introduction \nMisophonia is characterized by strong, unpleasant emotional re-\nactions to certain sounds and associated visual stimuli (Lewin et al., \n2021 ; Potgieter et al., 2019 ; Rosenthal et al., 2021 ; Swedo et al., 2022 ). \nAlthough not a formal diagnosis in the DSM-5 or ICD-11, misophonia has \nbeen increasingly studied and recognized in clinical practice since it was \nfirst described in the early 2000's by audiologists treating individuals \nwith decreased sound tolerance (Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2000 ; Pot-\ngieter et al., 2019 ; Swedo et al., 2022 ). Misophonia symptoms can arise \nat any age, though most retrospective studies of adults with misophonia \nsuggest onset during childhood or adolescence (Claiborn et al., 2020 ; \nJager et al., 2020 ; Potgieter et al., 2019 ). Unfortunately, there is minimal research on misophonia across the lifespan, but especially \namong youth. Without systematic data on the clinical presentation of \nmisophonia in children and adolescents, researchers and clinicians will \nbe unable to develop an understanding of this condition and its \ntreatment. \nAdults with misophonia experience disturbing and often intense \nemotional reactions to sound triggers including annoyance, disgust, \nanger, hatred, panic, and aggression (Claiborn et al., 2020 ; Jager et al., \n2020 ; Potgieter et al., 2019 ; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ). Physical re-\nactions may include muscle tension, heavy breathing, as well as physical \nor verbal outbursts (Claiborn et al., 2020 ; Jager et al., 2020 ; Potgieter \net al., 2019 ; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ).

Almost all affected individuals report severe irritation or anger \nwith triggers and hyper-focus on sounds, with less common emotional \nresponses including disgust and panic (Jager et al., 2020 ). Many others \nexperience feelings of powerlessness and loss of control (Jager et al., \n2020 ). \nFour studies have investigated comorbid psychiatric diagnoses; in \none clinic-based study, 28 % of 575 adults with misophonia experienced \na comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, most commonly mood (10 %) and \nanxiety disorders (9 %), as well as higher-than-expected rates of ADHD \n(5 %) (Jager et al., 2020 ). Erfanian et al. (2019) found that among 52 \nadults with misophonia, 40 % experienced a psychiatric disorder, most \ncommonly posttraumatic stress disorder (15 %), OCD (11 %), and \nanorexia (10 %). In another study, individuals with misophonia had \nsignificantly higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity than adults with \ngeneral non-misophonic auditory over-responsivity and healthy adults, \nwith 71 % of those with misophonia experiencing a comorbid psychi -\natric disorder, most commonly panic disorder (19 %), generalized anx-\niety disorder (15 %), social anxiety disorder (13 %), and major \ndepressive disorder (12 %) (Siepsiak et al., 2022 ). Finally, a study with \n207 adults with misophonia, the most common comorbidities were \nanxiety disorders (57 %), major depressive disorder (50 % lifetime; 7 % \ncurrent), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (15 %), and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (16 %) (Rosenthal et al., 2022 ).The most \ncommon psychiatric symptoms in adults with misophonia include mood, \nanxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms or \nobsessive-compulsive personality disorder traits (Claiborn et al., 2020 ; \nJager et al., 2020 ). \nCase series data among children with misophonia suggest this syn-\ndrome often presents with co-occuring psychiatric disorders, though \nthese studies are limited by very small samples (Dover and McGuire, \n2021 ; McGuire et al., 2015 ; Muller et al., 2018 ; Reid et al., 2016 ; Sar-\nigedik and Yurteri, 2021 ). Rinaldi et al. (2022a) identified 15 children \nwith elevated misophonia symptoms through population screening \nrather than self-identification or presentation for treatment. In this \nsample, 9 participants were female with a mean age of 11.7 years and 6 \nparticipants were male with a mean age of 11 years (Rinaldi et al., \n2022a ). These children showed poorer health-related quality-of-life than \npeers and higher traits associated with anxiety and OCD (Rinaldi et al., \n2022a ) as well as autistic traits across several social-cognitive domains, \nincluding attention-switching, communication, social skills, attention to \ndetail, and imagination (Rinaldi et al., 2022b ). \nTo address the absence of data describing misophonia in youth, this \nstudy evaluated clinical data from a sample of 102 children and ado-\nlescents meeting the proposed diagnostic criteria for misophonia (Swedo \net al., 2022 ). First, the study aimed to describe the clinical phenome -\nnology of youth with misophonia, including age, gender distribution, \ntypes and frequency of misophonia triggers, misophonia-related emo-\ntions, frequency of aggression responses, avoidance behaviors, and areas \nand degree of impairment. It was expected that anger and irritability \nwould be the most common emotional experiences, eating and breathing \nthe most common trigger sounds, and that the majority of the sample \nwould be female. Second, the study evaluated associations between \nmisophonia severity and psychiatric symptoms as well as quality of life. \nIt was expected that this sample of children and adolescents with \nmisophonia would have high rates of comorbid mood, anxiety, and \nobsessive-compulsive disorders as well as elevated autism spectrum \nsymptoms based on strong associations between misophonia and psy-\nchiatric symptoms in existing reports on misophonia in children and \nadolescents as well as those in adults (Cusack et al., 2018 ; Erfanian et al., \n2019 ; Jager et al., 2020 ; Rinaldi et al., 2022a ; Rinaldi et al., 2022b ). \nExploratory analyses investigated whether youth with misophonia differed significantly in these factors compared to youth with anxiety \ndisorders. \n2.Methods \n2.1. Procedures \nYouth with suspected misophonia were recruited via online adver -\ntisements, misophonia/anxiety-focused social media pages, as well as \nclinical and professional networks. Youth with suspected anxiety dis-\norders were also recruited to serve as a non-misophonia clinical com-\nparison group, as these disorders are also characterized by heightened \nemotional reactivity to specific stimuli. The majority of participants \nwere recruited via online advertisements. \nParticipants and their parents assented/consented to participate in \nthe study during an initial video call. Inclusion criteria for both samples \nwere: 1) being 8–17 years, 2) parent willingness to participate, 3) En-\nglish fluency. For the misophonia group, an additional criterion was: \nclinically significant misophonia symptoms based on a score of at least \n10 on the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S), indicating at least \nmoderate misophonia (Schroder et al., 2013 ). For the anxiety group, \nadditional inclusion criteria were: 1) a Parent-report Multidimensional \nAnxiety Scale for Children (MASC) T-Score of at least 60, 2) an anxiety \ndisorder diagnosis on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview \nfor Children and Adolescents (MINI-KID), and 3) a score of ≼4 on the A- \nMISO-S, corresponding with subclinical misophonia symptoms. \nAfter consent and screening, participants were scheduled for a \nseparate assessment video that included online questionnaires and a \nclinical interview which included the Misophonia Assessment Interview \n(MAI) (Lewin, 2020 ; Lewin et al., 2021 ) and the MINI-KID (Sheehan \net al., 2010 ) Interviewers were research coordinators with a bachelor's \ndegree in psychology or a related field (e.g., neuroscience) or doctoral \nstudents in professional psychology. Training included didactic pre-\nsentations on the MINI-KID and MAI, observation and co-rating of as-\nsessments with a trained rater, and weekly supervision with a licensed \npsychologist to ensure validity and reliability of assessments. \nThe Institutional Review Board at Baylor College of Medicine \napproved the study. All portions of the study were completed virtually. \n2.2. Participants \nOne-hundred and twelve youth with suspected misophonia and 140 \nyouth with suspected anxiety disorders were recruited. Of the 112 youth \nin the misophonia group, 102 were included in analyses; of the 140 in \nthe anxiety group, 94 were included. Reasons for exclusion in the \nmisophonia group included too mild misophonia symptoms (Amsterdam \nMisophonia Scale [A-MISO-S] score D10), n 5 (5 %), or failed at-\ntempts to schedule an assessment visit after the initial informed consent \nvideo call, n 5 (5 %). Reasons for exclusion in the anxiety group \nincluded: MASC score below the clinical cutoff, n 26 (19 %), A-MISO-S \nscore too high, 9 (6 %), no anxiety disorder as assessed on the MINI-KID, \nn 9 (6 %), and failed attempts to schedule an assessment visit after the \ninitial informed consent video call, n 2 (1 %). \n2.3. Measures \n2.3.1. Misophonia characteristics \nThe Misophonia Assessment Interview (Lewin, 2020 ) is a series of \nquestions evaluating symptoms of sound sensitivity, enhanced \nemotional and physical reactions to sound triggers, and degrees of \navoidance or interference with daily activities. Based on the initially \nproposed diagnostic criteria for misophonia by Schroder et al. (2013) , it \nasks about specific sound triggers, emotional responses, and avoidance \nbehaviors. It was developed to follow the format of a commonly used \ndiagnostic interview using the proposed diagnostic criteria of miso-\nphonia for an ongoing randomized clinical trial separate from this study A.G.

Responses to items on the MAI are presented \ndescriptively to characterize the presentation of misophonia in youth. \n2.3.2. Misophonia severity \nThe A-MISO-S, adapted from the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive \nScale (Y-BOCS) (Goodman, 1989 ; Goodman et al., 1989 ), is a commonly \nused measure of misophonia severity (Schroder et al., 2013 ) that has \nshown strong psychometric properties as a self-report measure in college \nstudents, including good internal consistency and a single-factor struc-\nture that explained 45 % of the variance in item responses (Naylor et al., \n2021 ). It includes six 0–4 Likert scale items assessing time taken by \nsymptoms, functional impairment, emotional distress, resistance against \nsymptoms, control over symptoms, and avoidance. It was administered \nas a child-report measure in this study, which has showed adequate \npsychometric properties in youth with misophonia, including a clear \nsingle-factor structure as well as adequate convergent validity and in-\nternal consistency (Cervin et al., 2022 ). Because it was developed for \nadults, to administer the measure in a developmentally-tailored manner, \nthe measure was presented to youth with a trained assessor present to \nprovide additional clarifications on items when youth had questions. \nItem 4 was not included in the total score because this item does not \ncontribute to overall severity and the measure has been shown to be \nmore internally consistent without it (Cervin et al., 2022 ); in this sam-\nple, internal consistency was α 0.68 with all 6 items and α 0.76 with \n5 items, so the 5-item version was used. The MAQ aids in measuring \nmisophonia severity by evaluating the negative impact of misophonia \nsymptoms on an individual's activities, thoughts, and emotions (Dozier, \n2015 ; Johnson and Dozier, 2013 ). It includes 21 items scored on a 0–3 \nLikert scale and has also shown strong psychometric properties for both \nthe child-reported (C-MAQ) and parent-reported (P-MAQ) versions, \nincluding strong internal consistency and convergent validity (Cervin \net al., 2022 ). The overall MAQ misophonia scale was used in the present \nstudy and showed high internal consistency in this sample; C-MAQ: α \n0.94; P-MAQ: α 0.93. \n2.3.3. Psychiatric diagnoses \nPsychiatric diagnoses were assessed with the MINI-KID, a commonly \nused and well-validated psychiatric interview based on DSM-5 and ICD- \n11 criteria. The MINI-KID has shown strong psychometric properties in \ngeneral and clinical populations (Boyle et al., 2017 ; Duncan et al., 2018 ; \nSheehan et al., 2010 ). It is designed to be a streamlined diagnostic \ninterview that can be administered by raters with a range of training \nunder the supervision of an experienced clinician (Sheehan et al., 2010 ). \n2.3.4. Emotional and behavioral functioning \nThe parent-report Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and child-report \nYouth Self Report (YSR) are well-validated, broadband measures of \nchildhood psychopathology that include 112 0–2 Likert scale items \n(Achenbach and Rescorla, 2001 ). The CBCL/YSR generates internalizing \nand externalizing scales that correspond to mood/anxiety symptoms and \ndisruptive behavior symptoms, respectively (Achenbach and Rescorla, \n2001 ). Both subscales across child- and parent-report showed high in-\nternal consistency in this sample; CBCL-externalizing: α 0.89; CBCL- \ninternalizing: α 0.89; YSR-externalizing: α 0.83; YSR- \ninternalizing: α 0.90. \n2.3.5. Autism spectrum features \nThe Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition (SRS-2) is a \ncommonly used, well-validated evaluation of autism features that in-\ncludes 65 items scored on a 0–3 Likert scale (Bruni, 2014 ; Constantino \nand Gruber, 2012 ). It contains sub-domains scoring social communica -\ntion and interaction (SRS-SCI) as well as restricted or repetitive behavior \n(SRS-RRB) corresponding with the symptom domains of autism spec-\ntrum disorder described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of \nMental Disorders (Constantino and Gruber, 2012 ). The SRS-2 shows strong psychometric properties and high internal consistency in this \nsample, SRS-SCI: α 0.92; SRS-RRB: α 0.82. \n2.3.6. Quality of life \nPQLES-Q. The pediatric version of the Short Form of the Quality of \nLife Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire is a self-report ques-\ntionnaire with items scored on a 1–5 Likert scale that assesses quality of \nlife among children and adolescents (Endicott et al., 2006 ). It has shown \nstrong internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and concurrent val-\nidity among both children and adolescents (Endicott et al., 2006 ). In-\nternal consistency in this sample was α 0.89. \n2.4. Analysis plan \nFirst, data were evaluated for patterns of missingness and conformity \nto normal distribution assumptions. Missing data were rare (two YSR, \none CBCL-Internalizing subscale, one parent-report MAQ, one SRS- \nRRB), and thus completer-only analyses were conducted. Data were \nnot found to show significant skewness or kurtosis, with all skewness \nand kurtosis statistics falling within \u00002 and 2, suggesting they would \nbe appropriate for parametric analyses (George and Mallery, 2010 ). \nTo evaluate the clinical characteristics of youth with misophonia, \ndescriptive information from the Misophonia Assessment Interview \nwere presented, including frequencies of different trigger sounds, \navoidance behaviors, aggression responses, and emotional responses. \nDemographic information was also presented. To evaluate the psychi -\natric morbidity of the sample, frequencies of different psychiatric di-\nagnoses were presented as well as norm referenced scale scores on the \nCBCL, YSR, and SRS-2. One-sample t-tests comparing mean t-scores for \neach subscale with a population mean of 50 were conducted to estimate \nsignificant differences with typical populations. Independent samples t- \ntests evaluated differences in CBCL, YSR, and SRS-2 scores between the \nmisophonia and anxiety groups. Recruitment targets were based on a \npower analysis for a cluster analysis (in preparation). For this study, \ngiven power 0.80, alpha 0.01 (for all analyses, p D.01 was inter-\npreted as significant to minimize family-wise error), and sample sizes of \n102 and 94, this study was powered to detect a medium between-group \neffect of d 0.48. Within the misophonia sample, partial correlations \ncontrolling for age and gender (male vs. non-male) between misophonia \nsymptom severity (using the A-MISO-S and MAQ) and psychiatric \nsymptom scales (CBCL and YSR), quality of life (PQ-LES-Q), and autistic \nfeatures (SRS-2) were conducted. With 102 participants, given power \n0.80 and alpha 0.01, this study was powered to detect small-to- \nmedium correlations (r 0.33). \n3.Results \n3.1. Sample demographics \nThe majority of the misophonia sample identified as White (87 %) \nand female (68 %). The mean age of the sample was 13.7 years (SD \n2.5) and the mean age of misophonia onset was 8.8 years (SD 3.0). The \nmajority of the anxiety sample also identified as White (71 %) and fe-\nmale (57 %), with a mean age of 12.4 years. The misophonia group was \nsignificantly older and had a significantly higher proportion of partici -\npants who identified as White (see Table 1). A summary of demographic \ninformation is presented in Table 1. \n3.2. Clinical characteristics of misophonia in youth \nAmong youth with misophonia, the most common trigger sounds \nincluded: eating sounds (people eating/chewing/swallowing/lip \nsmacking/slurping/teeth tapping), n 98 (96 %), breathing sounds \n(people breathing/sniffing/exhaling/inhaling/yawning), n 86 (84 %), \nthroat noises (people making throat clearing sounds/coughing), n 67 \n(66 %), tapping (people tapping with hands, feet, or object), n 55 (54 A.G.

See Fig. 1 \nfor a summary. \nMost youth with misophonia reported experiencing annoyance/ \nirritation, n 99 (97 %) or anger, n 97 (95 %) when hearing (or \nanticipating hearing) trigger noises. Other emotional responses or \nanticipatory emotions were also frequently endorsed, including a gen-\neral feeling of distress, n 95 (93 %), worry/anxiety, n 81 (79 %), \ndisgust, n 69 (68 %), and sadness/depression, n 44 (43 %). \nImportantly, emotional responses were assessed as in response to or in anticipation of hearing triggers without specifically distinguishing be-\ntween them. A high portion also endorsed a history of aggressive re-\nsponses, most frequently verbal aggression, n 87 (85 %), though \nphysical aggression was also common (including aggressive outbursts or \ndamage to objects/property), n 51 (50 %). Avoidance of specific sit-\nuations was common as well, most frequently family members, n 82 \n(80 %), and meals, n 77 (76 %). Most of the sample endorsed specific \nmodifications, anticipatory avoidance, or reactive avoidance behaviors, \nmost commonly covering ears with hands, n 94 (92 %), using pro-\ntective equipment like headphones, n 93 (91 %), or eating privately or \nwith special arrangements (e.g., apart from siblings), n 86 (84 %). A \nsummary of these data is presented in Fig. 2. \n3.3. Psychiatric morbidity \nPsychiatric morbidity in the misophonia sample was high, with 81 \nparticipants (79 %) meeting criteria for at least one psychiatric diag-\nnosis. Almost half of the sample experienced a major depressive disorder \n(current or past), n 48 (47 %), with 15 (15 %) experiencing a current \ndepressive episode at the time of assessment. Nearly half were experi -\nencing a current anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder, n 46 (45 \n%); the most commonly anxiety disorders were social anxiety disorder, \nn 31 (30 %) and generalized anxiety disorder n 27 (27 %). \nObsessive-compulsive disorder occurred in 8 participants (8 %). Other \ncommon diagnoses included attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, n \n21 (21 %) and chronic tic disorders, n 13 (13 %). Please see Fig. 3 for \na summary of non-misophonia primary and total psychiatric diagnoses \nin the sample. \nYouth were found to have clinically elevated internalizing symptoms \nper both youth and parent-report, YSR-Internalizing M (SD) 67.1 \n(14.2); CBCL-Internalizing M (SD) 69.8 (16.5).

Clinical correlates \nWithin the misophonia sample, when controlling for age and gender, \nboth the P-MAQ and C-MAQ were associated with a number of other \nclinical measures, including the YSR-Internalizing subscale, the YSR- \nExternalizing subscale, the CBCL-Internalizing subscale, the MASC, \nand the P-QLES-Q. The A-MISO-S was not significantly associated with \nany of the tested variables, though was modestly associated with the \nfollowing variables at a trend level: YSR-Internalizing, CBCL-External -\nizing, SRS-RRB, and PQLES-Q. See Table 2 for a summary. \n4.Discussion \nThis study described the clinical presentation of misophonia in a \nlarge cohort of children and adolescents. Consistent with studies in \nadults (Claiborn et al., 2020 ; Jager et al., 2020 ; Rouw and Erfanian, \n2018 ; Wu et al., 2016 ), the most prevalent trigger noises included those \nrelated to eating, breathing, or making throat noises, though other \ntriggers were common as well (e.g., tapping, paper rustling). The most \ncommon emotional responses were anger and annoyance/irritation, \nthough there was a significant mix of emotional responses, with par-\nticipants also describing anxiety, disgust, and sadness as well in reaction \nto or in anticipation of trigger noises. Avoidance behaviors were nearly \nubiquitous, with the most frequently endorsed behaviors including \ncovering ears (with hands or noise-blocking devices such as head-\nphones), avoiding places involving eating, and avoiding specific people, \nmost commonly family members. Nearly all youth had become verbally \naggressive in response to trigger noises at some point, and half had \nengaged in physical aggression. Interference with family life was re-\nported in nearly every participant, though interference with social life \noutside the family was also present in over half the sample, and inter-\nference with various other areas of life were also commonly endorsed (e. \ng., school, learning/homework). Misophonia severity was associated \nwith poorer quality of life, which was reported at similar levels as youth \nwith anxiety disorders, a population who consistently report poorer \nquality of life compared with typically developing youth (Bastiaansen \net al., 2004 ; Ramsawh and Chavira, 2016 ). Also consistent with reports \nin adults (Claiborn et al., 2020 ; Jager et al., 2020 ; Rouw and Erfanian, \n2018 ), most participants were female, although the self-referred nature \nof the sample warrants caution in interpreting this trend. The age-of- onset was just younger than 9, which aligns with the lower end of the \nestimates that have been reported in adults (Claiborn et al., 2020 ; Jager \net al., 2020 ; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ), as would be expected in a study \nfocused on youth. \nHigh rates of psychiatric comorbidity were noted in this sample, with \n79 % meeting criteria for at least one disorder. The most common psy-\nchiatric diagnoses were social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety \ndisorder, major depressive disorder, and specific phobias. Anecdotally, \nduring interviews, participants frequently described feeling depressed \nbecause of the isolation and distress caused by misophonia. It is possible \nthere is a similar causal pathway with social anxiety in severe cases of \nmisophonia, as social avoidance and interference was very commonly \nreported in this sample. Significant, medium-to-large associations be-\ntween the parent- and child-report MAQ (assessing misophonia symp -\ntoms) and anxiety, internalizing symptoms, quality of life, and \nexternalizing symptoms were found, further supporting a link between \nmisophonia and psychiatric symptoms. It is worth noting more consis -\ntent and larger associations between psychiatric symptom measures and \nthe MAQ relative to the A-MISO-S, whose items assess the impact of \nmisophonia (e.g., “My sound issues currently make me unhappy; ” “My \nsound issues currently interfere with my social life”), relative to items \nmore directly assessing misophonia severity on the A-MISO-S (e.g., \n“How much distress do the misophonic triggers cause you”?). Reliability \nwas also higher on the MAQ, which may have contributed to differential \nassociations. This highlights the need for rigorous psychometric testing \nand refinement of misophonia assessments in youth, which are only \nbeginning to be conducted (Cervin et al., 2022 ; Rinaldi et al., 2022a ). \nThese comorbidity findings were consistent with two studies in \nadults (Rosenthal et al., 2022 ; Siepsiak et al., 2022 ), though contrasted \ntwo others that recruited patients as part of clinic flow, which found \nlower rates of comorbidity (Erfanian et al., 2019 ; Jager et al., 2020 , \nthough higher-than-expected depression and ADHD were noted in Jager \net al., 2020 ). It is possible this discrepancy is due to the recruitment \nmethods for these different studies; the current study and the similar \nadult studies used primarily online and community-based recruitment \nwhereas Erfanian et al. (2019) included both psychiatry and audiology \nclinic referrals, the latter of which may be less psychiatrically affected. \nJager et al. (2020) may have also had referral patterns that resulted in a \ndifferent clinical presentation. \nResults support conceptualizing misophonia as a disorder on the \ninternalizing spectrum, with high rates of negative-valence emotional \nresponses to sound triggers, significant associations with co-occurring \ninternalizing symptoms, and high comorbidity with mood and anxiety \ndisorders. Further, despite frequently reported anger outbursts and \nfamily conflict tied to misophonia, externalizing symptoms were not \nsignificantly different from youth with anxiety disorders, and similar to \nwhat might be expected in a normative sample (Merikangas et al., \n2010 ), suggesting it is likely more an “internalizing ” than “external -\nizing ” problem. That said, the anxiety disorder group reported higher \ninternalizing symptoms than the misophonia group. Although this \nfinding may be related to a measurement artifact (i.e., anxiety is more \nTable 2 \nCorrelations between misophonia severity and psychiatric symptoms (controlling for age and gender).   \nYSR-Internalizing YSR-Externalizing CBCL-Internalizing CBCL-Externalizing SRS-2-SCI SRS-2-RRB MASC PQLES-Q \nA-MISO-S  .22.19  .15  .23.16  .21.12  \u0000.26\nP-MAQ  .39**  .28*  .26*  .13  .18  .20  .28*  \u0000.32* \nC-MAQ  .56**  .41**  .30*  .15  .24.22.38**  \u0000.52** \nA-MISO-S Amsterdam Misophonia Scale; C-MAQ Child-report Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire; CBCL Child Behavior Checklist; MASC Multidimen -\nsional Anxiety Scale for Children; P-MAQ Parent-report Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire; P-QLES-Q: Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire; \nSRS-2-RRBSocial Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition-Repetitive Behaviors and Restricted Interests Subscale; SRS-2-SCISocial Responsiveness Scale, Second \nEdition-Social Communication Impairment Index; YSR Youth Self-Report. \np D.05. \n*p D.01. \n**p D.001.

One \npsychological dimension that may be implicated across these disorders \nis sensory dysregulation, which should be more thoroughly investigated \nin follow-up work (Harrison et al., 2019). Further research should seek \nto better understand comorbidity in misophonia, as co-occurring psy-\nchiatric diagnoses likely exist due to shared predispositions (e.g., ge-\nnetics, neurobiology, behavioral patterns) as well as causal pathways (e. \ng., misophonia-related isolation causing depression and social anxiety). \nIt is worth noting that the anxiety sample reported significantly \nhigher autistic characteristics than the misophonia sample, and further, \nthat misophonia symptoms were not correlated with autism character -\nistics, consistent with a large study in adults (Jager et al., 2020). Autism \nfeatures have been found to be elevated in youth with misophonia \nrelative to non-misophonia controls in prior work (Rinaldi et al., 2022b); \nit is plausible that some may consider this finding reflective of some \nspecific relationship between autism and misophonia, particularly when \nconsidering the phenomenological similarities in sound sensitivity in \nthese syndromes, which are rarely seen in other populations. When \ncomparing with a relevant psychiatric control in this study, the autism- \nmisophonia connection appears less specific and further supports the \nnotion that there may be other underlying dimensions across these \nconditions (e.g., emotional and sensory hyperreactivity), rather that \nmisophonia reflecting a feature of autism. \nA clear understanding of the clinical presentation of misophonia in \nyouth provides a much-needed foundation for interdisciplinary work \ninvestigating the mechanisms of this disorder, which will inform inno-\nvative treatment development. For example, avoidance behavior was \nvery commonly reported in this sample, both in anticipation of and in \nresponse to trigger noises (e.g., using headphones, avoiding family \nmembers, avoiding meals). Behavioral and emotional avoidance is \nconsidered to play a central role in the development and maintenance of \nmood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorders in youth, and thus \nhas become a key treatment target of cognitive-behavioral therapies, \nand it is reasonable to expect it would play a similar role in misophonia \n(Chu, 2013; Kennedy and Ehrenreich-May, 2017). \nThis study had several limitations. First, participants primarily \nidentified as White and English speaking; further work is needed to \nunderstand misophonia in culturally diverse populations. The compar -\nison anxiety group was significantly younger and less frequently iden-\ntified as White; although age-corrected scores were used in comparison \nanalyses and the pattern of results did not change when statistically \ncontrolling for race, results should be considered within this possible \nlimitation. Similarly, the misophonia sample was recruited predomi -\nnantly from online support communities, and may reflect youth with \nmore severe, primary misophonia. Results may be less generalizable to \nyouth with misophonia sampled from the general population, or youth \nwith misophonia as a secondary diagnosis. Another limitation of this \nstudy was the use of misophonia assessments with only preliminary \npsychometric validation; unfortunately no validated assessments were \navailable when this study began and thus we adapted measures from the \nadult literature to draw conclusions. Rigorous development of psycho -\nmetrically validated assessment for misophonia severity and diagnosis \nare needed in the future. Further, only auditory triggers were assessed in \nthis study despite an increasing appreciation of visual triggers in the \nclinical presentation of misophonia (Swedo et al., 2022). Further \nresearch is also needed to understand clinical features of misophonia from interdisciplinary perspectives (e.g., audiological and neurobio -\nlogical evaluations were not included in this study) and in comparison \nwith other populations (e.g., autistic youth). \nThis study provided foundational data on the clinical presentation of \nmisophonia in youth, confirming a highly impairing clinical presenta -\ntion that is congruent with reports in adults while adding an important \ndevelopmental perspective. Further research is needed to understand \nthe mechanisms of this disorder to inform treatment development. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nAndrew G.
