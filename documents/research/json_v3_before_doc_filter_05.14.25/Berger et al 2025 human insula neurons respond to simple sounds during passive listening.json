      "text": "external to the body and not associated with interoceptive signals, remains scant, 37 \nalthough there is some limited evidence implicating the insula in auditory processing. 38 \nCase reports have shown that damage to the insula region can cause alterations in 39 \nauditory perception [10-13], even without apparent damage to auditory cortex. 40 \nAdditionally, studies in animals [14-18], human neuroimaging using functional magnetic 41 \nresonance imaging (fMRI) [19-22] and electrophysiology [23-29], suggest that activity 42 \nwithin the insula may be modulated by sound, particularly when it is emotionally 43 \narousing (e.g. music) or behaviorally relevant (e.g. detection of an odd tone), while 44 \nrecent intracranial local field potential data highlight that posterior insula represents 45 \nphonological features during both speech production and perception [30]. In 46 \nmisophonia, a condition characterized as an intense emotional reaction to sounds of a 47 \nparticular nature (e.g. chewing), the anterior insula is hyperactivated and 48 \nhyperconnected when listening to trigger sounds [31]. This finding has been interpreted 49 \nwithin the context of social cognition and interoceptive awareness [32, 33]. The insula 50 \nhas also been implicated in auditory hallucinations [34], and intracranial stimulation of 51 \nthis region can produce auditory sensations [35-37], although not always [38]. However, 52 \nelectrophysiological and imaging data have almost always been obtained in behaviorally 53 \nsalient contexts, such as music or speech, while lesion studies may not always be 54 \nspecifically localized to insula exclusively, and there are currently no reports of single 55 \nneuron responses recorded in the human insula. 56 \nPrior studies also do not address whether there is any tuning to basic acoustic sound 57 \nattributes in the insula [39]. For example, neurons in primary auditory cortex are tuned 58 \nto specific spectral and temporal features of acoustic stimuli [40-42]. Can activity of 59 \nindividual neurons in the insula also be modulated according to these fundamental 60 \nacoustic properties even when stimuli are not behaviorally relevant? If so, what are the 61 \nlatencies and tuning properties of these neurons, and where are these located? 62 \nWe addressed this gap in knowledge by recording extracellular single neuron activity 63 \nfrom the insula in eleven humans and comparing these recordings to those obtained 64 \nfrom the adjacent posteromedial portion of Heschlâ€™s gyrus (HGPM), corresponding to 65 \nprimary auditory cortex [43]. Data were collected while participants passively listened to 66 \nauditory stimuli consisting of short click trains and pure tones of various frequencies. 67 \nThis allowed us to determine (1) the extent of insula neurons that are responsive to 68 \nauditory stimulation; (2) whether these neurons showed frequency tuning; (3) the spatial 69 \ndistribution of responsive neurons across posterior and anterior insula (InsP and InsA, 70 \nrespectively); and (4) the latencies, magnitudes, and durations of these responses 71 \ncompared to HGPM. Knowledge about the neuronal properties of this brain area in 72 \nresponse in audition is important for understanding how the human brain processes 73 \nsounds. This knowledge has additional relevance to auditory hallucinations and 74 \ndisorders such as tinnitus [44]. 75 \n 76 \n 77 .

InsA responses were even more transient (median 139 \n= 41 ms, IQR = 58.5), though there was no significant difference overall between the 140 \nresponse durations of InsP and InsA neurons ( p = 0.276). Modulated neurons were 141 \ndistributed throughout each subregion of insula, though there was an absence of 142 \nmodulation in the most ventral aspects of InsA (see Supplementary Figure 2).  143 \nFigure 3 shows the response properties of the different regions for tones. Approximately 144 \none third of InsP were modulated by tones (30.8% total; 28.8% increasing, 1.92% 145 \ndecreasing).

      "text": "Discussion 172 \nOur results demonstrate that neurons in the human insula significantly modulate their 173 \nactivity in response to auditory stimuli that are passively presented, in the absence of 174 \nany obvious behavioral or emotional salience. Responses in insula had similar latencies 175 \nand bandwidths to HGPM, but were more transient. The highest proportion of these 176 \nresponses were in InsP, though a smaller minority of neurons in InsA were also 177 \nmodulated, albeit more weakly. Overall, these results suggest that processing of basic 178 \nproperties of acoustic stimuli contribute to the postulated role of the insula. 179 \nThe insula, particularly InsA, is known to be part of a salience network [49, 50] which 180 \ndetects and marks how behaviorally relevant the stimulus/events in the environment 181 \nare. Depending on the degree of saliency, the insula mediates further processing by 182 \ndirecting attention or allocating working memory by coordinating between different brain 183 \nnetworks (e.g. activating a fronto-parietal network for attention and deactivating the 184 \nâ€˜mind wanderingâ€™ default mode network for a highly salient event). How does InsA 185 \nreceive sensory inputs for marking their saliency? Theoretical models of insula function 186 \n[1, 50, 51] suggest that InsP receives sensory inputs which  are then re-represented in 187 \nInsA. There is now ample evidence to support the idea that interoceptive signals from 188 \nthe body do indeed reach InsP [1]. Whether this is also the case for exteroceptive 189 \nsignals such as auditory, however, has historically been less certain. Our high spatial- 190 \ntemporal resolution single neuron data recorded from the insula highlights that â€“ like 191 \nsignals from the body â€“ auditory signals from the external environment are received in 192 \nInsP . It should be noted that in the saliency model of insula function, stimuli need not be 193 \nsalient or behaviorally relevant to reach InsP , and they were not in the case of the 194 \npresence study. The saliency of the stimuli is proposed to be marked in InsA. This 195 \nmodel may then explain why in our data the proportion of modulated neurons is less in 196 \nInsA compared to that in InsP when passively listening to sounds, as these sounds were 197 \nnot required to be salient. 198 \nEvidence showing that insula activity is modulated even during passive listening may 199 \nexplain â€“ at least in part â€“ why lesions to the insula can cause altered auditory 200 \nprocessing, such as in cases of acquired amusia, temporal processing deficits or 201 \nhyperacusis after a stroke [52, 53]. The results of the current study are also consistent 202 \nwith neuroanatomical studies showing that the insula receives direct projections from 203 \nauditory cortex [54, 55] and medial geniculate body [56], although as highlighted by 204 \nRemedios et al. [14], anatomical results do not give insight into the nature of the 205 \ninvolvement of the insula in auditory processing without corresponding physiological 206 \ndata, which we have provided here. 207 \nThese results may also explain why stimulation of insula can produce auditory 208 \nperceptual experiences [35-37].

In the current study, our electrode locations were confirmed to 212 \nbe in the insula based on individual participantsâ€™ MRIs, as well as plotted on a template 213 \nusing MNI coordinates. While it is plausible that some studies may have stimulated 214 \nregions adjacent to the insula to produce auditory perceptual experiences, another 215 \npossibility is that an absence of behavioral response may be due to the still relatively 216 \nsmall fraction of neurons in this region being involved in auditory processing (about 1/3 217 \nin the current study). Thus, if particular neurons were not stimulated by electrodes within 218 \nthe insula, then an auditory percept would likely not be produced. Further studies 219 \nutilizing both stimulation mapping and auditory  presentation in the same neurons would 220 \nbe invaluable for elucidating the dynamics of these auditory-responsive insula neurons. 221 \nReports of the tuning properties of single neurons in HGPM are rare, with only a handful 222 \nstudies to date examining this [57-59]. In the first systematic study of individual neurons 223 \nin human auditory cortex, the bandwidth measured in a similar manner to the current 224 \nmanuscript was at least 1 octave [58], consistent with what we found here. Contrastingly 225 \nthough, the bandwidth of neuronal responses to tones here was considerably larger 226 \nthan what was demonstrated previously when using an approach that estimates based 227 \non spectro-temporal receptive fields derived from random-chord stimuli [59]. It is 228 \ntherefore likely that basic tonal stimuli â€“ although widely used historically to study the 229 \nfunction of the auditory system [60] â€“ do not reveal the full extent of the precision of 230 \nstimulus encoding, and future studies should examine this with refined stimuli for both 231 \nthe HGPM and the insula. Moreover, while this study represents a rich and unique 232 \ndataset, the spatial extent of electrode coverage was still somewhat limited, as 233 \ndetermined solely by the clinical needs of the patients. This work lays the foundation for 234 \nfurther, more comprehensive, studies aimed at understanding the full extent of auditory- 235 \nrelated single neuron activation throughout the insula.   236 .

Research was conducted under approval of the University of 241 \nIowa Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from all 242 \nparticipants prior to data collection. Recordings were made while subjects were reclined 243 \nin a hospital bed, in a custom-designed dedicated electromagnetically-shielded facility 244 \nwithin the University of Iowa Clinical Research Unit.  245 \n 246 \nElectrodes and recording system 247 \nStereo electroencephalography (sEEG) depth electrodes (Ad-Tech Medical, Oak Creek, 248 \nWI) were placed in brain locations based solely on a clinical need to identify seizure foci 249 \n[61]. For the purposes of recording single neurons, sEEG electrodes included here in 250 \nthe insula and HGPM were of a hybrid design [62]. These consisted of eight 39 Âµm 251 \ndiameter platinum-iridium high-impedance microwires that were insulated plus one 252 \nuninsulated microwire. These microwires protruded from the end of the macro recording 253 \nprobe and were prepared with a cut length between 2 to 4 mm, depending on the 254 \ndistance of the most distal macro contact to the appropriate brain target. Each of these 255 \nmicrowires was individually separated in a splay pattern in the operating room 256 \nimmediately prior to implantation. Electrode locations were confirmed based on post- 257 \noperative MRI scans, preprocessed using Freesurfer [63] (see below for further details). 258 \nAll neurophysiological data were recorded using a Neuralynx Atlas System (Neuralynx, 259 \nBozeman, MT). High impedance recordings were first passed through a preamplifier 260 \nlocated on top of the patientâ€™s head (ATLAS-HS-36-CHET-A9, Neuralynx, Bozeman, 261 \nMT) prior to interfacing with the ATLAS acquisition system. These were subsequently 262 \nrecorded with a 32000 Hz sampling rate, filtered between 0.1 â€“ 8000 Hz and referenced 263 \nonline to the uninsulated microwire. 264 \n 265 \nStimuli and procedure 266 \nExperimental stimuli were trains of acoustic clicks (used previously in [64]) and pure 267 \ntones (used previously in [65]). Clicks were digitally generated as rectangular pulses 268 \n(0.2 ms duration) and were presented in trains of five at a rate of 100 Hz (train duration 269 \n40 ms, 2 s inter-train interval). Tones were presented at six frequencies between 250 270 \nand 8 kHz in 1-octave steps (300 ms duration, 5 ms riseâ€“fall time, 2 s interstimulus 271 \ninterval). The six tones were presented 50 times each in a random order. The stimuli 272 .

Stimuli were delivered to both ears via insert earphones (ER4B, Etymotic 274 \nResearch, Elk Grove Village, IL) that were integrated into custom-fit earmolds or foam 275 \near tips (for two participants). In each participant, the intensity difference between click 276 \ntrains and pure tones was within 20 dB and varied depending on comfort. Inter-stimulus 277 \nintervals were chosen randomly within a Gaussian distribution (mean interval 2 s; SD = 278 \n10 ms) to reduce heterodyning in the recordings secondary to power line noise. 279 \nStimulus delivery was controlled by a TDT RP2.1 and RZ2 real-time processor (Tucker 280 \nDavis Technologies, Alachua, FL). 281 \n 282 \nImaging 283 \nA T1-weighted structural MRI scan of the brain was conducted for each participant both 284 \nbefore and after the implantation of electrodes. The images were captured using a 3T 285 \nSiemens TIM Trio scanner and a 12-channel head coil. MPRAGE images had a spatial 286 \nresolution of 0.78 Ã— 0.78 mm, a slice thickness of 1.0 mm, and utilized a repetition time 287 \n(TR) of 2.53 s and an echo time (TE) of 3.52 ms. To locate the recording positions on 288 \nthe preoperative structural MRI scans, these images were aligned with post- 289 \nimplantation structural MRIs. This alignment was achieved using a 3D linear registration 290 \nalgorithm (Functional MRI of the Brain Linear Image Registration Tool; [66]) and custom- 291 \nwritten MATLAB scripts (MathWorks, Natick, MA). Included microwire bundles were 292 \nverified to be within gray matter for either the insula or HGPM. Electrode locations were 293 \nco-registered for each participant to a template brain, in order to derive MNI coordinates 294 \nfor the purposes of visualization. Coordinates of microwire locations were then 295 \nvisualized on an fsaverage MRI template showing the insula and neighboring region of 296 \nHGPM, using custom-written MATLAB scripts.  297 \n 298 \nData processing and analysis 299 \nData from high impedance electrodes localized to the insula or HGPM were first 300 \nextracted using Matlab and denoised with an implementation of the demodulated band 301 \ntransform [67]. These data were downsampled to 12 kHz and common average re- 302 \nreferenced to all high impedance contacts on the same assembly prior to spike sorting. 303 \nSpike sorting was performed using an automated procedure with manual curation, 304 \nutilizing an algorithm implementing high-order spectral decomposition to aid in pattern 305 \nrecognition and identify individual features [68]. Briefly, filters were estimated for 306 \npotential candidate single neuron waveforms for each channel through a process 307 \nrelated to blind deconvolution. Extracted features were clustered using a gaussian 308 \nmixture model in Matlab (R2022a, Mathworks Inc) and spike times from these clustered 309 .

      "text": "features were used to plot separate candidate waveforms. Single neurons were then 310 \nmanually curated and defined based on classical waveform shapes, uniformity of 311 \nwaveforms across different spike times for each cluster, and interspike interval 312 \ndistributions that did not violate refractory periods (<1% of interspike intervals occurring 313 \nwithin 1 ms). See Supplementary Figure 1  for summarized curation details. Putative 314 \nsingle neuron spike times were then epoched around the stimuli for each trial (500 ms 315 \nbefore stimulus onset to 1000 ms post-stimulus onset). Raster plots were created to 316 \nshow neuronal activity for each trial and spike density functions were estimated by 317 \nconvolving single neuron spike times with a gaussian kernel (1 ms resolution, generally 318 \n5 ms standard deviation, though a standard deviation of 15 ms was used for display 319 \npurposes in Figure 1 ). 320 \n 321 \nStatistical analysis 322 \nSingle neuron modulation to auditory stimuli was determined using a two-tailed paired t - 323 \ntest against baseline, wherein spike rates across trials between 0 to 350 ms post- 324 \nstimulus were compared to baseline firing rates from a pre-stimulus window of the same 325 \nduration (-400 to -50 ms). This was only considered for neurons that had a mean firing 326 \nrate â‰¥1 Hz across the baseline and post-stimulus windows. The p -value alpha for this 327 \ntest was set at 0.05 for click stimuli and Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) 328 \ncorrection [69, 70]  was applied to tonal response p-values to account for multiple 329 \ncomparisons (based on the six different tone frequencies presented). Magnitudes for all 330 \nresponses were determined by averaging the z-scored firing rate across the post- 331 \nstimulus window. The latency of significantly modulated neurons was then determined 332 \naccording to the first peak in the baseline z-scored spike density function from 10 ms to 333 \n350 ms post-stimulus, wherein this peak was a minimum value of half of the maximum 334 \npeak within this time window. For neurons that suppressed their activity in response to 335 \nauditory stimuli, spike density functions were first inverted prior to finding the peak. For 336 \ntone stimuli, the best frequency of each neuron was defined as the tone that elicited the 337 \nmaximum absolute value of the z-scored average, wherein this response was 338 \nsignificant. Bandwidth in octaves was determined based on the full width at half 339 \nmaximum of this frequency, which was obtained after interpolation of both frequencies 340 \nand magnitudes to create 10000 discrete sampling points. Where the lowest or highest 341 \nfrequencies were the maximum absolute value (i.e. showed the strongest modulation), 342 \nthese were taken as the low or high cutoff for this calculation, respectively. Response 343 \ndurations were determined based on the time after the first peak wherein the spike 344 \ndensity function was reduced to 5% of the maximum peak value. Regional differences in 345 \nresponse properties were examined using a linear mixed effects modeling approach. 346 \nOutput (response magnitude, latency or duration) was modeled using region of interest 347 .
