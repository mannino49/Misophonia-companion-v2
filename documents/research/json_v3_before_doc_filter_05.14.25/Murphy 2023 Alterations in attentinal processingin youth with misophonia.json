Trigger sounds are common sounds generated \nby other people during processes such as breathing, eating, or moving. \nThese can include chewing, rasping or rattling of breath during \nbreathing, clicking or tapping of fingers/joints, or interaction with me-\nchanical objects that results in clicking, tapping, crunching sounds. The etiology of misophonia is poorly understood, however, the presentation \nis distinct from sensory conditions such as hyperacusis and phonopho -\nbia, which refer to sound level specific reactions and general fear re-\nsponses respectively (Jager et al., 2020 ; Swedo et al., 2022 ). Misophonia \noften causes great distress to affected individuals and their families, with \ndetrimental effects on quality of life and everyday functioning (Guzick \net al., 2023 ). Misophonia typically onset during childhood or adoles -\ncence, but the mechanisms of its prodromal development and subse -\nquent maintenance remain unknown. This adds to the confusion of how \nto best classify misophonia and making it unclear if this is best \n*Corresponding author. \nE-mail address: nicholas.murphy@bcm.edu (N.

Accordingly, no pharmacological intervention is currently avail-\nable to alleviate misophonia symptoms, and psychological treatments \n(e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) are just beginning to emerge \n(Rappoldt et al., 2023 ). A better understanding of the key neuro -\ncognitive mechanisms involved in the onset and maintenance of miso-\nphonia is needed to identify clinical targets and to design and \npersonalize interventions. Our aim in this study is to identify affected \nelements of attentional processing that are distinct to misophonia in a \nyouth population. \nEarly studies of misophonia identified physiological responses such \nas heightened galvanic skin response (Edelstein et al., 2013 ), increased \nheart rate (Grossini et al., 2022 ), and muscular tension (Dozier et al., \n2020 ) in response to certain auditory stimuli. These responses imply the \npossibility of elevated vigilance of the autonomic nervous system. \nChanges to vigilance, even when temporary or contextual, can impair \ncognitive functions across neuropsychological domains, including \nworking memory (Berryman et al., 2017 ; MacNamara et al., 2019 ), set- \nshifting (Coifman et al., 2018 ), and cognitive control (Crane et al., \n2016 ), which in turn can result in impaired social functioning and poor \nquality of life (Bar-Tal et al., 2013 ; Guzick et al., 2023 ; Rinaldi et al., \n2022 ). In misophonia, heightened vigilance in anticipation of miso-\nphonic triggers would at least partially explain the altered sensitivity to \nsound stimuli, as well as the mood disturbances typical for the condition \n(Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ; Siepsiak et al., \n2022 ). \nNeuroimaging studies support the notion of a heightened state of \nvigilance in misophonia, pointing to altered attribution of processing \nresources within the salience network (Kumar et al., 2017 ; Schroder \net al., 2019 ). Findings from multivariate functional imaging suggest that \naudio-visual misophonic trigger stimuli, but not generally aversive or \nneutral stimuli, may be associated with enhanced hemodynamic \nresponse in the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and superior temporal \ncortex in individuals with misophonia relative to controls (Schroder \net al., 2019 ). Moreover, these stimuli elicited intense feelings of disgust, \nanger, and sadness, emphasizing the distorted salience these stimuli \nhold in affected individuals. Individuals with misophonia, but not con-\ntrols, have also demonstrated elevated heart rate during both miso-\nphonic and generally aversive conditions (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; \nSchroder et al., 2019 ). What the combination of these findings imply is \nthat individuals affected by misophonia exhibit a heightened level of \narousal that lowers the detection threshold for potentially aversive \nstimuli. This form of systemic biasing towards certain sensory stimuli \ncan be observed by examining response inhibition with a modified \nStroop task, where higher levels of vigilance make it easier for sensory \nstimuli to override cognitive processes (Daniels et al., 2020 ). In this \ninstance, misophonic trigger sounds, but not universally unpleasant \nsounds, increased the Stroop effect in participants with higher trait \nanxiety (Daniels et al., 2020 ). \nThe effect of symptom provocation on attentive processes is a key \nelement in the hypervigilance/arousal model of misophonia etiology. \nHowever, the functional imaging data to date only present a macro-level \npicture of how this aspect of misophonia is organized. This was \naddressed by Frank et al. (2020) using a modified version of the \nAttention Network Task (ANT) designed to assess neurocognitive pro-\ncesses associated with three independent attention networks: alerting \nattention, orienting attention, and executive attention (Frank et al., \n2020 ). Importantly, each of these attentional networks overlap with the \ncircuits described by Schroder et al. (2019) and Kumar et al. (2017) . The \nauthors identified differences between misophonia patients and controls \nin alerting attention while orienting and executive attention were not \ndifferent between the groups. Alerting attention is related to neural \nactivity in a network of frontal and parietal regions, which exhibits \ncontrol over the initiation and maintenance of an attentive response \n(Posner and Petersen, 1990 ). To address the importance of sound pro-\ncessing on attention components, the task had been modified to include misophonic sound presentations in certain blocks. Interestingly, there \nwas no interaction with the sound condition, suggesting that the alter-\nations to alerting attention exist as part of broader alterations in atten -\ntional processing, which is in line with previous functional imaging \nstudies suggesting that misophonia is associated with an altered func-\ntional state characterized by heightened levels of arousal. \nFor understanding misophonia etiology, it is important to break \ndown the manner in which hypervigilance impacts different cognitive \ndomains and computational processes. In the ANT study, individuals \nwith misophonia did not display difficulties related to orienting atten -\ntion (Frank et al., 2020 ), a finding presumably at odds with behavioral \ntraits observed in misophonia, for example, escape/avoidance behavior \n(Guzick et al., 2023 ), and strategic delaying of responses (Eijsker et al., \n2019 ). A promising avenue to further explore the computational prop-\nerties of attention in misophonia is to use the Immediate Memory Task \n(IMT). The IMT was adapted from the Continuous Performance Task \n(CPT (Klee and Garfinkel, 1983 ), a task used to measure discriminability \nand impulsive regulation by contrasting correct detections with com-\nmission errors (responses to non-target stimuli (Dougherty et al., 2003 )). \nIn the IMT, the goal is to select if a cue and target stimulus (5 number \nsequence) match or not. Non-matching trials can be commission errors \n(1 digit different in the target stimulus), random errors (neither cue nor \ntarget match), or filler errors (cue and target are two halves of a ten-digit \nsequence). See Fig. 1 for a description of the task. This design distin -\nguishes random and/or impulsive incorrect responses from incorrect \nanticipatory responses (commission errors), providing a more nuanced \napproach to estimating both response sensitivity and response bias (e.g., \nthe cognitive strategy for response making) (Dougherty et al., 2000 ). \nSignal detection theory can be used to resolve the degree of response \nsensitivity and bias during the IMT (Dougherty et al., 2003, 2000 ; Pas-\ntore and Scheirer, 1974 ) and might help to shed light upon cognitive \nprocesses related to orienting and executive attention in misophonia \n(Frank et al., 2020 ). \nModeling of reaction times (RT) during the IMT is another approach \nthat can help explain variability in the allocation of resources to atten -\ntive processes. In particular, ex-Gaussian modeling of RTs, which ac-\ncounts for the non-parametric distribution of timings, has been shown to \nbe a sensitive indicator of fluctuating attention (Schumacher et al., \n2019 ) (Schumacher et al., 2019 ). The ex-gaussian distribution has three \ncomponents: mu, sigma, and tau, which represent the mean, standard \ndeviation, and exponent respectively. Studies in attention deficit hy-\nperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Galloway-Long and Huang-Pollock, \n2018 ), aging (Schumacher et al., 2019 ), and working memory (Shahar \net al., 2014 ) have helped to provide a theoretical description of the ex- \ngaussian parameters. The gaussian parameters of mu and sigma relate to \nthe general accuracy of performance, whereas the tau parameter relate \nto the allocation of resources and maintenance of task-appropriate \nattention (Ratcliff, 1979 ). Previous work has identified that dysfunc -\ntional aging such as in dementia (Schumacher et al., 2019 ), and devel -\nopmental difficulties with hyperactivity such as in ADHD (Galloway- \nLong and Huang-Pollock, 2018 ) are associated with larger tau compo -\nnents in RT distributions, indicating less precise allocation of attentional \nresources. \nThe aim of the present study is to explore attentional processes in \nchildren and adolescents with misophonia. To distinguish processes \nspecific for misophonia, we will include a clinical comparison group of \nyouth with anxiety disorders, another condition characterized by al-\nterations in attentional processing (Pacheco-Unguetti et al., 2010 ), \nmaking it possible to distinguish mechanisms specific for misophonia. \nBased on the arousal model of misophonia described above, we hy-\npothesize that the ex-gaussian tau property of RT distributions might be \na strong computational marker of misophonia pathology. We further \nhypothesize that if misophonia patients exhibit a functional difference \nthat renders them in a hypervigilant state, they will have greater \nresponse sensitivity and a more liberal response bias. As an exploratory \nmeasure, we will examine response rates for different cue conditions and N. Murphy et al."

Participants \nWe drew data from a broader project that included 102 children and \nadolescents (13.69 ±2.51 years) (67.6 % female) who met the proposed \ndiagnostic criteria for Misophonia and 94 children and adolescents with \nanxiety disorders (12.41 ±2.55 years) (57.4 % female). The complete \ndemographic profiles of these samples have been previously described \n(Guzick et al., 2023 ). Using the completion of the online IMT task as an \nentry requirement for the present study, 72 misophonia (13.74 ±2.44 \nyears) (64 % female) and 89 anxiety patients (12.35 ±2.57 years) (58.4 \n% female) were included in the IMT analysis. \n2.2. Immediate memory task \nIn the IMT, we used 5-digit sequences of numbers as the cue and \ntarget stimuli (see Fig. 1). The objective of the task is to make a response \nusing one of the two button options provided to indicate if the target \nstimulus was identical to the cue stimulus. Participants were presented \nwith a fixation cross (1000 ms) followed by the cue stimulus (500 ms) \nand then the target stimulus (500 ms). After the target stimulus had \ndisappeared, participants were presented with a blank screen (1000 ms). \nAt the presentation of the target stimulus, participants could respond as \nto whether it matched (1) or not (0) the cue stimulus. The IMT consisted \nof 4 trial types: 1) Match: cue and target arrays were identical; 2) Catch: target array was different from the cue array by 1 digit (e.g., Cue \n46,781 and Target 46,782); 3) Random: target array and cue array \nwere completely different (e.g., Cue 16,093 and Target 27,515); 4) \nFiller: cue and target array were two parts of a ten digit sequence (e.g., \nCue 12,345 and Target 56,789). Trials were presented in a random \norder for each participant with an inter-stimulus interval of 500 ms \npreceding the end of the response period and the start of the next fixa-\ntion period. Each condition consisted of N 25 trials for a total of N \n100 trials. A brief run of 11 practice trials were presented beforehand to \nreduce random error. The total experiment time was 5 min and 55 s. The \nexperiment was created using Gorilla Experiment Builder (Anwyl-Irvine \net al., 2021, 2018 ). \n2.3. Clinical and behavioral measures \nTo evaluate the influence of self-reported symptom domains on task \nperformance, we used the following clinical ratings to characterize: 1) \nMisophonia : the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S) (Cervin et al., \n2023 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ), the Misophonia Inventory of Sound Trig-\ngers (MIST), a trigger list that was developed for this study, which was \nsummed to create a total trigger count, the Misophonia Assessment \nQuestionnaire (MAQ) (Cervin et al., 2023 ; Johnson and Dozier, 2013 ), \nand the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ) (Robertson and Sim-\nmons, 2013 ); 2) Anxiety: the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Chil-\ndren (MASC) (March, 1997 ), the Behavioral Inhibition-Activation Scales \n(BIS/BAS) (Carver and White, 1994 ); and 3) Other emotional symptoms \nand mechanisms : Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory (CASI-5) \n(Gadow and Sprafkin, 2013 ), Cognitive Emotion Regulation Question -\nnaire (CERQ) (Garnefski et al., 2001 ), Youth Self Report (YSR) \nFig. 1.Schematic depiction of the IMT paradigm.

Response accuracy and signal detection \nThe primary analysis of the IMT task involved extracting response \naccuracy and reaction times per condition. Response accuracy was used \nto the hit rate and false alarm rate that act as the base for estimating \nsignal detection measures: Sensitivity (d prime, d′), bias (c). \nTo estimate these measures, we first calculated the hit and false \nalarm rates for the IMT. Hit rate (HR) refers to the ratio of correct \nmatches in the “Match ” condition (hit) to the total number of “Match ” \ntrials (N). Similarly, the false alarm rate (FR) refers to the number of \ncommission errors made relative to the total number of trials in the catch \ntrials. \nHR⋃hit0B5\nN1  \nFR⋃false alarm0B5\nN1  \nd′ was then measured as the difference between the normalized HR and \nFR, where normalization was performed by estimating the percent point \nfunction.

Reaction times \nWe modeled the ex-Gaussian reaction times for the IMT task using \nthe DISTRIB (Lacouture and Cousineau, 2008 ) toolbox for Matlab. \nDISTRIB estimates the ex-Gaussian function through the multiplication \nof the cumulative density of the Gaussian function for the reaction time \ndata by an exponential function. The fit is optimized by using a \nparameter search algorithm to maximize the representation of the data \nin the distribution (Lacouture and Cousineau, 2008 ). Ex-Gaussian pa-\nrameters were estimated using all correct trials with a latency F200 ms \n(collapsing across conditions). \n2.5. Statistics \nWe evaluated the effect of misophonia pathology on our data using a \ntwo-part strategy. In part one; standard comparisons of the behavioral \ndata were performed. IMT response accuracy by trial type were analyzed \nusing repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Signal detection \nmeasures and ex-gaussian parameters were compared between groups \nusing independent samples t-tests. Correlations between significant \nexperimental measures and clinical ratings were estimated using boot-\nstrapped Pearson ’s r. To perform correlations, the database was split and \nthe analyses were run for misophonia and anxiety patients separately. \nCorrelations were Bonferonni corrected to adjust for multiple compari -\nsons within measurement (Misophonia, Anxiety, and Other emotional \nsymptoms/mechanisms measures) families (Misophonia [p .008] , \nAnxiety [p D.008], Other emotional symptoms /mechanisms [p < .0125] ). \nIn part two, we measured the contributions of age and biological sex to \nthe variance within the data using a three-block linear regression. In \nblock one the experimental group was used as the only coefficient. In \nblock two age was added, and in block three biological sex was added. \nThe contributions of additional coefficients were evaluated using the F \nchange statistic. Sex distributions were compared between the groups \nusing the chi squared test of independence. 3.Results \n3.1. IMT performance \nOur ANOVA showed a significant main effect of condition (F \n124.64, df 3, p D.001, η2 0.44) but not group (F 2.06, df 1, p D\n.15, η2 0.01) or group*condition (F 0.74, df 3, p D.53, η2 \n0.005). IMT task performance was associated with reduced accuracy \nduring catch trials relative to other conditions, but performance was not \naffected by group membership. See Table 1 and (Fig. 2). \n3.2. Signal detection \nd′ was statistically significantly greater in Misophonia patients \ncompared to anxiety patients (t \u00002.12, df 159, p .036, d \n\u00000.336, CI \u00000.65 to \u00000.02), indicating a higher rate of “hits” to “false \nalarms. ” c was not significantly different between groups (t 0.47, df \n159, p .64, d 0.07, CI \u00000.24 to 0.38). Means are displayed in \nTable 2. In Misophonia patients, d′ was significantly correlated with the \nMIST-C (r 0.33, p .005) and the CERQ total score (r 0.31, p \n.008). No other clinical variables were significantly associated with d′ or \nc scores (Fig. 3). \n3.3. Reaction times \nMu (t \u00000.46, df 159, p .65, d \u00000.07, CI \u00000.38 to 0.24), \nsigma (t 0.49, df 159, p .63, d 0.08, CI \u00000.23 to 0.39), and tau \n(t \u00001.09, df 159, p .27, d \u00000.17, CI \u00000.48 to 0.14) parameters \nwere not significantly different between groups. Means are displayed in \nTable 3 and (Fig. 4). \n3.4. Contributions of developmental biology \nAfter identifying that signal detection was significantly different \nbetween the groups, we used linear regression to model the contribu -\ntions of age and biological sex. In the baseline model, group was a sig-\nnificant predictor of d′ (R2 0.02, F 4.49, p .036), where group had \na beta value of β 0.16 (p .036). The addition of age (β 0.335, p D\n.001) significantly altered the model (R2 change 0.105, F change \n19.13, p ≼0.001), reducing the beta value for group to β 0.079 (p \n.302), implying a positive influence of age on d′ present in both groups. \nConversely the addition of sex (Male B \u00000.1, p 55, Female β \u00000.1, \np .52) did not present any additional alterations to the model (R2 \nchange 0.002, F change 0.207, p .81). \n3.5. Sex distribution \nSex distributions were not significantly different between the groups \n(χ2 1.7, df 2, p .043). In the anxiety group N 30 reported male, \nN 53 reported female, and N 6 reported not identifying with either. \nIn the misophonia group N 22 reported male, N 48 reported female, \nand N 2 reported not identifying with either. \n4.Discussion \nCurrently the diagnosis and treatment of misophonia is suffering due \nto a lack of understanding of its underlying neurobiological mecha -\nnisms. In this study, we used the IMT to investigate neurocognitive \nproperties of attention in misophonia that have previously been linked \nto arousal (Frank et al., 2020 ). Using a two-step analysis of the IMT, we \nfirst demonstrated differences in response sensitivity (dprime, d′) be-\ntween the groups, indicating heightened stimulus discriminability in \nmisophonia patients relative to anxiety patients. In the second stage of \nour analysis we used linear modeling to identify the contributions of age \nand biological sex to the variance in d′. Linear modeling demonstrated a \nmoderate contribution of age, but not biological sex, which in turn N. Murphy et al."

The effect of age on d′ could suggest that there \nis the possibility of misophonia specific differences in attention during \nearly development but that these become less substantial in line with natural cognitive development. Conversely, poorer attention in early \nage might simply be related to less developed executive functions. \nFurther work is needed to elucidate the trajectory of misophonia specific \ndifferences in attention. \nExisting work in the neuroscientific sphere has largely sought to \ncharacterize the functional architecture but has not yet identified a \nmechanism by which pathology leads to the core symptoms of the dis-\norder. Current hypotheses point to a state of hyper-arousal influencing \nresource allocation during sensory processing (Daniels et al., 2020 ; \nEdelstein et al., 2013 ; Frank et al., 2020 ; Neacsiu et al., 2022 ; Schroder \net al., 2019 ). Because both misophonia and anxiety disorders are char-\nacterized by attentional impairments, and a healthy control group was \nnot included in our design, we performed follow-up analysis of the \nrelationship of d′ to misophonic trigger information.

This finding is in line with previous accounts of \nincreased alerting of attention in misophonia patients during the ANT \n(Frank et al., 2020 ) and might imply that perceptual and attentional \nsystems in misophonia are tuned to be more alert for the purpose of \nidentifying and avoiding trigger sounds. However, for the purpose of \nidentifying this earlier in development this hypothesis should be con-\ntrasted with the alternate hypothesis that heightened alertness precedes \nmisophonia development and represents a potential risk factor. More \nspecific developmental research will be necessary to determine the na-\nture of this hypothesis. Accordingly, behavioral performance in terms of \nresponse accuracy and reaction times were not significantly different \nfrom youth with anxiety disorders, implying that pathology in miso-\nphonia might differentially affect the systems for arousal and cognitive \nfunction. This would track with previous reports implicating hypervig -\nilance and anticipatory anxiety as core to the clinical presentation of \nmisophonia in youth and adults (Jager et al., 2020 ; Swedo et al., 2022 ). \nIn our study the ex-gaussian distribution was used as it has previously \nbeen linked to learning effects within a task (Schmiedek et al., 2007 ). \nThe shape of the exponential distribution has been linked to resource \nallocation and might be affected by arousal such as seen in attention \ndeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Hwang Gu et al., 2013 ). In our \nresults the lack of significant differences in the ex-gaussian parameters \nsuggests that the mechanism of resource allocation for task learning is not different in anxiety or misophonia. \nThe lack of significant differences between misophonia and anxiety \ngroups on other IMT performance outcomes may indicate that there are \nnon-specific disruptions in other attentional processes across youth with \nboth misophonia and anxiety disorders (e.g. (Najmi et al., 2012 )), as \nyouth with anxiety disorders have been shown to experience deficits in \nother attentional domains (Sylvester et al., 2016 ). The lack of a non- \npsychiatric comparison groups does not enable this study to make \nthese conclusions definitively, though given prior work on this topic, it is \na possibility that youth with misophonia might also experience im-\npairments in these attentional domains, reflecting transdiagnostic defi-\ncits associated with psychopathology more broadly. \n5.Limitations and future directions \nThe present study has several limitations. First is the lack of a healthy \ncontrol group. In our study it is difficult to discern the extent to which \nthe lack of distinctions between misophonia and anxiety constitute a \nlack of behavioral deficits. Second, our test uses numeric stimuli for the \nmatching conditions, restricting our ability to draw conclusions about \nbroader perceptual processes. This experiment was conducted across \nmultiple years coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, certain \nelements of the experiment were limited to what could be conducted \nvirtually. Due to the strict requirements for auditory processing studies, \nsuch as volume control and sound presentation, a visual numeric format \nof the experiment was used as it could be easily recreated on a variety of \nmonitors without affecting task performance. Future work should \naddress this by implementing a multivariate format of the experiment, \nincluding an auditory discrimination task. Third, although the IMT \nprovides a means of testing the properties of decision-making and how \nthey are affected by arousal, it does not describe detailed neurophysi -\nological processes constructing the functional architecture in which this \noccurs. In future work it is critical to address how properties of attention \nare related to the parameters of excitation and inhibition balance that \ncan be described using electroencephalography. Finally, the relationship \nbetween d′ and misophonic trigger information warrants further inves -\ntigation, as this might indicate a first step for exploring neurocognitive \nassessments as part of clinical practice for misophonia. In our study it is a \nFig. 3.Comparison of signal detection theory measures between groups (across all trial types).  \nTable 3 \nComparison of ex-Gaussian parameters between groups. 0 Anxiety, 1 \nMisophonia.  \nMeasure Group N Mean SD SE Coefficient of \nvariation \nMu Anxiety (0)  89  414.18  288.53  30.58  0.69 \nMisophonia \n(1)  72  433.51  237.78  28.02  0.55 \nSigma Anxiety (0)  89  86.15  75.99  8.06  0.88 \nMisophonia \n(1)  72  80.5  68.73  8.1  0.85 \nTau Anxiety (0)  89  114.12  91.88  9.74  0.81 \nMisophonia \n(1)  72  129.34  81.74  9.63  0.63  N.

These individuals are used to being \nalert to stimuli indicating that a trigger might occur, therefore putting \nthem in a state where it is natural to pick up on subtle differences in \nstimuli that others might not notice. Ultimately the etiology of miso-\nphonia is unknown and future research must address practical designs in \nthe tests use to study properties such as arousal and hypervigilance so \nthat causal effects can be identified. \n6.Conclusions \nAlterations in cognitive systems, through which attentional re-\nsources are directed towards the identification and avoidance of trigger \nsounds, may be an avenue for future work to refine neurocognitive \nmarkers for misophonia in children and adults. Approaches based on \nsignal detection theory provide a complimentary perspective to existing \nfunctional imaging studies by summarizing the computational proper -\nties of targeted systems. In this study, we observed a dimensional rela-\ntionship between misophonic trigger load and response sensitivity. \nHowever, it still remains unclear how bottom-up sensory gating pro-\ncesses might interact with higher-order cognitive processes associated with the complex patterns of behavior (Guzick et al., 2023 ) and aberrant \nneural connectivity (Neacsiu et al., 2022 ) seen in misophonia. Future \nresearch should examine the exact influence of auditory stimuli on \nattentional processing and how interventions can integrate findings \nfrom experimental research to improve effects of treatment. \nAuthor statement \nThis research was funded by The REAM Foundation (Misophonia \nResearch Fund, Study: Deep Phenotypic Characterization of Misophonia \nin Children and Adolescents).
