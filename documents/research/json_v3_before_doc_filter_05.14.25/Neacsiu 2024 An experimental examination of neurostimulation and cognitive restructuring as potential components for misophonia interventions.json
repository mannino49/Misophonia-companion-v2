When presented with \nthose sounds, individuals with misophonia experience intense distress \nassociated with heightened physiological reactions such as increased \nheart rate or skin conductance and have trouble disengaging from the \ntrigger (Kumar et al., 2017 ). While the prevalence of misophonia is \nestimated at 5–12 % of the population (Wu et al., 2014 ), this condition is \nstill not well understood, and the first consensus on a standardized definition was published only recently (Swedo et al., 2022 ). Current \nmisophonia treatment approaches have limited existing evidence and \ninclude lifestyle modification, cognitive behavioral therapy, and audi-\nological treatment (Potgieter et al., 2019 ). However, since the mecha -\nnisms underlying misophonia are unknown, the current treatments do \nnot have clear targets for change; limited evidence exits on the benefits \nof any interventions; and misophonic patients report limited satisfaction \nwith many common approaches (Smith et al., 2022 ). \nEmerging neuroscientific findings suggest that misophonia may be \nan independent disorder (Neacsiu et al., 2022a ), characterized by hy-\nperactivity of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) in response to misophonic \n*Corresponding author at: Duke University Medical Center (102505), Durham, NC 27710, USA. \nE-mail addresses: andrada.neacsiu@duke.edu (A.D.

The anterior insula is \ncentral to subjective emotional experience, awareness of sensory \nperception, and higher-level integration of salient cues for emotional \nprocessing (Craig, 2009 ). Therefore, these findings suggest enhanced \nsalience of and difficulty disengaging from misophonic sounds. Quali -\ntative studies report that the misophonic experience contains intense \nemotions of anxiety, anger, and disgust, among other emotions (Brout \net al., 2018 ; Swedo et al., 2022 ; Remmert et al., 2022 ; Rosenthal et al., \n2021 ), as well as difficulties with emotional regulation (Guetta et al., \n2022 ; Rinaldi et al., 2022 ). Thus, examinations of emotional dysregu -\nlation and comparisons with clinical populations who have difficulty \nwith their arousal and regulation are warranted. Although several \ncandidate networks are at play in this complex disorder (e.g., sensory, \nauditory, or even motor (Kumar et al., 2021 )), examining the similarities \nand differences of misophonia with other emotional disorders holds \npromise because of the wealth of existing interventions for emotional \ndysregulation across psychopathology (Mennin, 2006 ; Neacsiu et al., \n2014 ; Gross, 2013 ). \nIn the present study, we compared transdiagnostic clinical adults \nwho report high emotional dysregulation with adults with moderate to \nsevere misophonia using multimethod assessment. We examined dif-\nferences in the response and regulation of aversive sounds to test broad \nemotional dysregulation in misophonia. Furthermore, we tested how \nclinical controls respond to and regulate emotions associated with \ntrigger sounds to clarify the unique features of misophonia. \nIn addition, we aimed to investigate whether a bottom-up versus a \ntop-down approach is best suited for a misophonia intervention. Using \nrepetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS; see Supplement) (Hoogendam \net al., 2010 ), we examined whether inhibiting insula activity with low- \nfrequency mPFC stimulation or enhancing regulation with high- \nfrequency dlPFC stimulation during the presentation of misophonic \nsounds leads to larger reductions in misophonic distress when compared \nto listening to trigger sounds without any intervention. Diffusion tensor \nimaging data in humans have shown direct anatomical connections \nbetween the insula and both the mPFC and dlPFC (Ghaziri et al., 2017 ). \nThe mPFC is thought to engage in automatic, implicit emotional pro-\ncessing, while the dlPFC is associated with conscious, effortful emotion \nregulation (Etkin et al., 2015 ). Therefore, low-frequency mPFC stimu -\nlation and high-frequency dlPFC stimulation allowed us to examine \ndifferential responses to inhibition of emotional reactivity versus \naugmentation of cognitive emotional control, respectively. We also \nwanted to compare the use of cognitive restructuring (an emotional \nregulation skill), with neurostimulation, and with skill use plus neuro -\nstimulation as different avenues for treatment development using a \nwithin-subject design. Our goal was to answer several questions to \naccelerate the development of treatments for misophonia. \nWe trained all participants to use cognitive restructuring (CR) to \nunderstand whether skills training could be as effective for misophonic \nadults as it is for clinical emotional dysregulation (Neacsiu et al., 2014 ). \nEffective use of reappraisal during an emotion regulation task increases \nhigh-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) (Denson et al., 2011 ), a \nmarker of effective emotion regulation (Butler et al., 2006 ; Di Simplicio \net al., 2012 ). HF-HRV has not yet been investigated in misophonia. \nRather, changes in skin conductance level (SCL) and response (SCR) \nwere identified as potential psychophysiological markers of misophonic \ndistress (Kumar et al., 2017 ). There have been few examinations of the \neffect of emotion regulation tasks on SCL, with one study showing no \ndifferences in SCL between effective and maladaptive regulation stra-\ntegies (Campbell-Sills et al., 2006 ). Therefore, one aim of this study was \nto test differences between adults with misophonia and clinical controls \non HF-HRV, SCL, SCR, and self-reported distress (SUDS) during passive \nlistening and regulation of aversive and misophonic sounds. \nThe second aim was to examine whether potential misophonia in-\nterventions should target reduction to sound reactivity or improvement \nin emotion regulation as the primary mechanism of change. To this aim, we chose to apply excitatory neurostimulation over a node of the \nemotion regulation network (HF-rTMS over the right dlPFC) and \ninhibitory neurostimulation targeted towards the reactivity network \n(LF-rTMS over a prefrontal node functionally connected to the insula). \nGiven the consistent finding that the insula is hyperactive in the pres-\nence of trigger sounds in misophonia (Neacsiu et al., 2022a ), we hy-\npothesized that one avenue towards intervention is to inhibit insula \nactivity in the presence of sounds. Stimulation of the insula directly is \ndifficult; nevertheless, connectivity based stimulation has been shown to \nsuccessfully reach deeper brain structures (Beynel et al., 2021 ). There -\nfore, we used connectivity analyses to find a node in the mPFC func-\ntionally connected to the insula, and administered stimulation over this \nnode with the aim of inhibiting activation in the entire network. \nFurthermore, we examined whether neurostimulation, cognitive \nrestructuring, or their combination offers the most promise for a novel \nintervention. \nWe hypothesized that when compared to controls, participants with \nmisophonia will exhibit (H1) higher distress (as measured with SUDS, \nSCL, and SCR) when listening to misophonic trigger sounds; (H2) lower \ndistress when listening to aversive sounds; and (H3) lower HF-HRV \nduring the regulation of misophonic sounds. We expected that both \nLF-rTMS (H4) and HF-rTMS (H5) stimulation will reduce distress \nsignificantly more than sham stimulation during the presentation of \nmisophonic cues in the misophonia group. We expected HF-rTMS \nstimulation to lead to lower distress and higher regulation (HF-HRV) \nin both groups when compared to sham stimulation during the presen -\ntation and regulation of aversive sounds (H6). We planned to explore \ndifferences between the use of CR, LF-rTMS, HF-rTMS, and their com-\nbination (i.e., CR HF-rTMS; CR LF-rTMS) within and across groups, \nexpecting combined interventions to lead to more reductions in arousal \nthat each component alone (H7). \n2.Methods \n2.1. Participants and procedures \nThis study was pre-registered under the Clinical Trials ID \n(NCT04348591) and ran between October 2020 and May 2022. The \nstudy was powered based on expected effect sizes derived from Kumar \net al. [2], The CONSORT diagram (Fig. 1) and the Supplement contain \nadditional details regarding power analyses, participants, and study \nenrollment. Participants received a maximum compensation of $250. \nThe study was approved by the Duke University Health System Institu -\ntional Review Board and it study conforms to the provisions of the \nDeclaration of Helsinki. Fig. 2 depicts the study design. \n2.2. Intake session \nAfter providing voluntary, written informed consent, participants \ncompleted diagnostic assessments (SCID-5, SCID-PD), a verbal intelli -\ngence test (Dunn, 1981 ), and a questionnaire packet [see Supplement]. \n2.3. Sound task \nQualifying participants completed an in-person task where they \nheard 101 pre-selected sounds: 31 aversive, 40 misophonic, and 30 \nneutral sounds. Each stimulus presentation was followed by valence and \narousal ratings. Participants in the misophonia group alone were also \nasked whether the sound was a misophonic trigger for them (yes/no). \nBased on this task (see Supplement for details), for each participant, \npersonalized sets of 12 aversive, 12 misophonic, and 12 neutral sounds \nwere selected for the neurostimulation and neuroimaging sessions. \n2.4. Neuroimaging sessions \nParticipants completed an imaging session (Fig. 2B) on average 9.83 A.D. Neacsiu et al."

Following stan-\ndardized training, participants moved into a research-dedicated GE HD \n3.0 T MRI scanner. The scan included an anatomical image and four runs \nof EPI functional images acquired while participants experienced and \ndownregulated emotions related to personalized sounds (task-related \nacquisition: four runs). See Supplement for details. \nFMRI analyses were performed immediately after the MRI session to \ndefine the individualized stimulation target. Structural and functional \ndata were first examined with MRIQC and then preprocessed with \nfMRIprep v1.1.4 (Esteban et al., 2019 ). A psychophysiological interac -\ntion (PPI) analysis was also conducted to measure functional connec -\ntivity with the left insula while listening to misophonic vs. neutral \nsounds. Connectivity with the left insula only was chosen because we \naimed to find an mPFC target on the right hemisphere (to keep consis -\ntent with the dlPFC targeting) and other research shows contralateral \nconnectivity tends to be strongest between limbic and prefrontal regions \n(Banks et al., 2007 ), and, finally, when affective processing is lateralized \nto one side of the insula, it tends to be the left side (Duerden et al., 2013 ). \nThe statistical maps for the contrasts of interest (“downregulate vs. \nlisten to a misophonic sound ”, and “PPI: listen to misophonic vs. neutral \nsound ”) were transferred to native space (Avants et al., 2011 ), and \noverlaid onto the anatomical image in neuronavigation software \n(BrainSight, Rogue Research, Canada). For each participant, the cluster \nwithin the right dlPFC showing the strongest positive z-statistic value for \nthe “Downregulate ” contrast was defined as the dlPFC target (average \nzdlPFC_stimulation_site 2.74, SD 0.73). The cluster within the right mPFC \nshowing the strongest positive z-value above a threshold of z 1.96 for \nthe PPI-“Listen ” contrast was defined as the AIC functional connectivity \ntarget(average zmPFC_stimulation_site 3.03, SD 1.50). See Fig. 3A-B for a \nvisual depiction of the personalized targeting procedure and Supple -\nment for additional details. \n2.5. Neurostimulation experimental session \nParticipants returned for the 3.5-hour skills training/neuro -\nstimulation session (Fig. 2C) on average 14.11 days after the MRI session \n(SD 12.57). The first 45 min were spent on skills training, one-on-one \nwith the first author, a clinical psychologist with expertise in cognitive behavioral therapy. The session focused on in-depth learning and \npractice of CR (See Supplement). Next, the participant ’s resting motor \nthreshold (rMT) was established using standard procedures (Rossi et al., \n2021 ). \nPsychophysiological measurements were collected continuously \nduring the experiment using the BIOPAC MP150 recording system \n(Goleta, CA) via GSR and HR electrodes. Active and sham rTMS were \nperformed with a figure-8 coil (A/P Cool-B65) and a MagPro X100 \nstimulator (MagVenture, Denmark) set up to deliver biphasic pulses. Ten \nHz rTMS over the personalized right dlPFC target (HF-rTMS) was per-\nformed using 5 s of stimulation and 15 s of an inter-train interval (ITI) at \n120 % rMT. One Hz rTMS over the personalized mPFC-AIC-connectivity \ntarget (LF-rTMS) was performed using one pulse per second continu -\nously at 90 % rMT (Balconi and Bortolotti, 2012 ). Sham stimulation was \napplied using the same intensity setting but with the coil in placebo \nmode (Smith and Peterchev, 2018 ). Coil position and orientation were \ncontinually monitored through a stereotaxic neuro-navigation system \n(Brainsight, Rogue Research, Canada). \nAll participants received the three interventions. Each neuro -\nstimulation experimental session was conducted by the first author \n(AN), with the assistance of a TMS technician. AN, who was blinded to \nthe stimulation condition, led the participant through the session and \ndecided on dose adjustments and course of action for any protocol de-\nviations. The experimental session (Fig. 2C-D) is detailed in the \nSupplement. \nHigh-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), skin conductance \nresponse (SCR), and skin conductance level (SCL) were used as in-\ndicators, respectively, of emotion regulation, peak emotional arousal, \nand average arousal. HF-HRV and SCL were extracted within each sound \ntask block (120 s). SCR and change in SUDS were examine for each \nsound presentation (30s; see Fig. 2E for a visual depiction). \n2.6. Statistical analyses \nWe conducted four analyses examining ΔSUDS, SCR, SCL, and HF- \nHRV (see Fig. 2E). See Supplement for details. To account for multiple \ncomparisons, we used a Bonferroni correction and reduced the alpha \nthreshold to D0.0125. Planned covariates for all analyses included coil- \nFig. 3.A.

Data-driven \ncovariates such as the incidence of headaches post-stimulation were \nalso examined and added as needed. Effect sizes were computed by using \nFeingold ’s formula (Feingold, 2009 ) and interpreted using Cohen ’s \nspecifications (Cohen, 1977 ). The distribution of HF-HRV was trans -\nformed to normal using the function lg10 (HF-HRV*1000000). All other \ndata were normally distributed. \n3.Results \n3.1. Feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, compliance, and blinding \nefficacy \nOverall participants in both groups reported reduced stress at the end \ncompared to the beginning of each experimental session \n(Δaverage_intake_change \u00000.56, SD 1.53; Δaverage_MRI_change \u00000.31, SD \n1.22; Δaverage_TMS_change \u00000.48, SD 0.89). These results suggest \nthat the experimental tasks were feasible and acceptable to our partic -\nipants. Following the sham stimulation, 26 participants (48.15 %) re-\nported some headache, compared to 40 participants (74.07 %) after the \nHF-rTMS trial, and 34 (62.96 %) after the LF-rTMS trial, a significant \ndifference (χ2[2] 7.73, p .02). Because of the higher incidence of \nheadache in the active stimulation conditions, we included this variable \nas a data-driven covariate in analyses. There was no difference in \nguessing active versus sham assignments between types of neuro -\nstimulation received (Msham 5.72, SD 2.27; MHF-rTMS 6.74, SD \n2.07; MLF-rTMS 6.43, SD 2.18) or between groups (F [2, 151] \n11.05, p .09), according to a multivariate ANOVA controlling for \nracial background (F [1, 151] 0.06, p .44). See Supplement for \nadditional findings. \n3.2. Preliminary analyses examining confounds \nThere were significantly more participants belonging to racial or \nethnic minority groups in the emotional dysregulation condition \n(Table 1). Therefore, racial/ethnic background was recoded as 0 (non- \nwhite) or 1 (white) and co-varied in subsequent analyses. A more \nnuanced covariate was not possible given that the misophonia group \nwas 96.5 % white. \nSignificant differences were found between experimental conditions \n(sham vs. active rTMS) during the habituation period (i.e., when neu-\nrostimulation alone was administered at rest). At rest, HF-rTMS \nadministered over the right dlPFC enhanced HF-HRV (F [2, 90.49] \n6.63, p .002), SCR (F [2, 90.76] 14.27, p D.001), and SCL (F [2, \n96.22] 27.17, p D.001) significantly more than sham neuro -\nstimulation (ΔHF-HRV 0.12, SE 0.03; ΔSCR 2.84, SE 0.54; ΔSCL \n1.76, SE 0.24). LF-rTMS over the right mPFC did not significantly \naffect HF-HRV, but significantly increased SCR (ΔSCR 1.72, SE 0.52) \nand SCL (ΔSCL 0.72, SE 0.23) when compared to sham. Participants \nexperienced significantly higher tonic arousal (SCL) during HF-rTMS \nthan during LF-rTMS (ΔSCL 1.05; SE 0.24, p D.001). As planned, \nbecause of these observed differences, habituation values for outcomes \nvariables replaced task baseline values as co-variates in main analyses. \nEffect sizes were computed by using Feingold ’s formula (Feingold, \n2009 ) and interpreted using Cohen ’s specifications (Cohen, 1977 ). The \nSD for HF-HRV (0.59), SCR (4.26), and SCL (3.60) during the session \nbaseline, and for ΔSUDS post-pre session baseline (0.58) were used to \ncompute the effect sizes. \n3.3. The effect of neurostimulation and cognitive restructuring on \nreactivity and regulation \nTable 2 includes EMMs for main and interaction effects across all \noutcome analyses. 3.3.1. Self-report results (SUDS) \nThe MMANOVA analysis of SUDS used a Toeplitz covariance struc-\nture (see the syntax in Supplement) and found a significant main effect \nof experimental neurostimulation (F[2, 373.52] 19.50, p D\n.000000001). Pairwise comparisons between the three neurostimulation \nconditions demonstrated that SUDS ratings were significantly lower \nwhen HF-rTMS over the dlPFC was administered than when either LF- \nrTMS over the mPFC (p < .00001, Cohen ’s d 1.0) or sham (p D\n.000000001, d 1.58) were administered. See supplement for addi-\ntional results for main effects. \nA significant interaction was found between experimental neuro -\nstimulation, experimental instruction, and group (F[22, 705.00] \n18.36, p D.000000001). The interaction revealed that participants in \nthe misophonia group experienced significantly more distress than \ncontrols when listening (Δ 1.91, SE 0.32, p D.001, d 3.34) and \nwhen downregulating (Δ 1.93, SE 0.32, p D.001, d 3.34) miso-\nphonic sounds across all experimental conditions, a finding that sup-\nports H1. In addition, participants in the misophonia group reported \nsignificantly less distress than participants with emotion dysregulation \nwhen listening to aversive sounds (Δ 1.76, SE 0.32, p D.001, d \n3.04), a finding that supports H2. In the sham condition alone, partici -\npants with emotional dysregulation reported more distress when \ndownregulating aversive sounds than participants with misophonia (Δ Table 1 \nDemographics and clinical descriptive by group.   \nEmotion \ndysregulation (n \n30) Misophonia \n(n 29) Statistical \ndifference \nMean age (SD) 27.07 (8.28) 29.59 (9.79) t (57) \n\u00001.07, p \n.29 \nFemale gender identity \n(%) 86.67 89.66 χ2[4] 2.98, \np .56 \nLatinx background (%) 23.33 3.45 χ2[1] 4.98, \np .03 \nRacial background (%)   χ2[5] \n13.68, p .02 \nAsian/Asian American 30.0 3.45  \nBlack/African \nAmerican 3.33 0.00  \nNative American, \nAmerican Indian, or \nAlaskan Native 3.33 0.00  \nWhite/Caucasian 56.67 96.55  \nMiddle Eastern 6.66 0.00  \nOn psychotropic \nmedications: 40.00   \nRecent psychotherapy: 50.00   \nTotal # of diagnoses, \ncurrent (SD) 1.97 (1.38) 1.52 (1.83) t (57)1.07, \np .29 \nTotal # of diagnoses, \nlifetime (SD) 4.07 (2.12) 3.00 (2.32) t (57) 1.85, \np .07 \nCurrent disorders (%)    \nMood disorders 30.00 13.80  \nAnxiety disorders 83.30 69.00  \nObsessive compulsive \ndisorders 16.70 6.90  \nStress disorders 10.00 10.30  \nImpulse control \ndisorders 6.70 6.90  \nEating disorders 0.00 3.40  \nLifetime disorders (%)    \nMood disorders 83.30 69.00  \nAnxiety disorders 93.30 75.90  \nSubstance use disorders 26.70 27.60  \nObsessive compulsive \ndisorders 23.30 10.30  \nStress disorders 31.00 20.70  \nEating disorders 13.30 13.80  \nAny pd.

During dlPFC and mPFC stim-\nulation, this difference between groups was no longer significant, sug-\ngesting that neurostimulation normalized the regulation of aversive \nsounds for controls. \nGroup-specific results were as follows: for participants with emotion \ndysregulation, confirming H6, HF-rTMS decreased SUDS more than \nsham when participants were asked to listen to neutral (ΔSHAM-HF-rTMS \n0.92, p .004, d 1.59), aversive sounds (ΔSHAM-HF-rTMS 0.97, p D\n.001, d 1.68), or misophonic sounds (ΔSHAM-HF-rTMS 1.50, p D.001, \nd 2.59). HF-rTMS also enhanced the downregulation of aversive (ΔSHAM-HF-tTMS 1.15, p D.001, d 1.99) and misophonic (ΔSHAM-HF- \nrTMS 1.51, p D.001, d 2.59) sounds, which supports H6. LF-rTMS did \nnot outperform sham stimulation in this group (Fig. 4). \nFor participants with misophonia, unlike patients with emotion \ndysregulation, the rTMS effect was specific for the misophonic sounds. \nContrary to H6, there were no differences between both active and sham \nneurostimulation when participants listened to neutral or aversive \nsounds or when they downregulated aversive sounds. This is likely \nbecause participants with misophonia reported relatively low distress \nwhen listening to aversive sounds (EMM 1.55, SE 0.34). Never -\ntheless, the distress produced by a misophonic sound was significantly \nlower in the HF-rTMS condition when compared to sham when partic -\nipants were instructed to listen (ΔSHAM-HF-rTMS 0.92, p .001, d \n1.59) or to downregulate (ΔSHAM-HF-rTMS 1.02, p D.001, d 1.76), \nwhich supports H5. LF-rTMS was marginally superior to sham during \nlistening (ΔSHAM-LF-tTMS 0.58, d 1.00, Bonferroni corrected p .16), \nor downregulation of misophonic sounds (ΔSHAM-LF-rTMS 0.64, d \n1.11, Bonferroni corrected p .12). Thus, H4 was not supported. There \nwas no difference between the two active rTMS conditions (p F.05). \nTo examine the effects of implementing a behavioral skill alone, we \nexamined differences within the sham condition only. Instructions to \ndownregulate led to significantly less distress than instructions to listen \nto aversive (Δ 1.88, SE 0.39, p D.001, d 3.25) and misophonic (Δ \n2.12, SE 0.33, p D.001, d 3.66) sounds across groups. Thus, in \nboth conditions, excitatory neurostimulation as well as implementation \nof an emotion regulation skill individually reduced emotional distress, \nand therefore are promising interventions for both emotional dysregu -\nlation and misophonia. \nTo examine across groups whether neurostimulation alone was su-\nperior to behavioral skill implementation, we compared the change in \ndistress when listening to aversive or misophonic sounds while receiving \nHF-rTMS with changes during sham while participants were engaged in \nCR. We also compared the combination of neurostimulation with CR \nwith either intervention alone. Utilizing a behavioral skill was superior \nto neurostimulation alone (paversive 0.001, d 2.31; pmisophonic 0.012, \nd 1.57) in reducing distress induced by aversive sounds. The combi -\nnation of neurostimulation and skill use led to significantly lower \ndistress at the end of the sound presentation for both misophonic and \naversive sounds when compared to either intervention modality alone \n(ps D0.001, ds F2.90). Therefore, in line with H7, the combined \nintervention leads to the highest reduction in distress, followed by uti-\nlizing only behavioral skills, followed by neurostimulation alone. \n3.3.2. Peak arousal (SCR) results \nA MMANOVA analysis using a Toeplitz covariance structure found a \nmain effect of baseline (F[1, 674.27] 33.99, p D.00000001), the time \nduring the block (F[3, 99.85] 48.86, p D.001), and headache (F[1, \n668.90] 15.22, p D.001). There was also a marginally significant main \neffect for coil-to-cortex distance (F[1, 717.11] 5.06, p .03). Higher \nbaseline SCR (i.e., during habituation; parameter estimate [PE] 0.17, \nSE 0.03), lower coil-to-cortex distance (PE \u00000.12, SE 0.03), and \npresence of head discomfort (PE \u00000.82, SE 0.21) led to higher SCR \nduring individual sound presentations. SCR decreased significantly over \ntime within each block (ps D0.03). A significant main effect of experi -\nmental neurostimulation was also found (F[2, 587.82] 6.98, p .001), \nbut pairwise comparisons only found a marginally significant difference \nbetween sham and the LF-rTMS conditions (Δ 0.35, SE 0.16, p \n.03). There was no significant main effect for group, instructions pro-\nvided, or racial background (ps F0.05). The interaction effect between \nexperimental neurostimulation, instruction provided and experimental \ngroup was marginally significant, and as a result, was not investigated \nfurther (F[22, 1262.55] 1.65, p .03). Therefore, the SCR results did \nnot support any of our hypotheses. \n3.3.3.

Tonic arousal was significantly higher in the \nsham condition when compared to either active stimulation condition (p \nHF_rTMS 0.001; pLF_rTMS 0.002; ds 0.14), with no difference between \nactive conditions (p F.05) suggesting that both types of neuro -\nstimulation reduced tonic arousal. Higher SCL at baseline (i.e., during \nhabituation) led to higher SCL during the experimental runs (F[1, \n57.77] 2488.10, p D.001). There was also a significant effect of time \nduring the experimental run, with earlier blocks having significantly \nhigher SCL than later blocks (ps D0.001). Thus, SCL decreased over time \nduring the run independent of the experimental condition. There was no \nsignificant main effect for the experimental group, instructions pro-\nvided, headache, racial background, or coil-to-cortex distance (ps F\n0.05). Therefore, the SCL results did not support H1 and H2. \nA significant interaction was found between experimental neuro -\nstimulation, instruction provided, and group (F[22, 111.50] 2.69, p D\n.0005, Fig. 5). There were no significant differences between groups, \nand therefore we examined this interaction within each group. \nFor clinical control patients with emotion dysregulation, when \nlistening to neutral (ΔSHAM-HF-rTMS 0.63, p .004; ΔSHAM-LF-rTMS \n0.67, p .002) or misophonic sounds (ΔSHAM-LF-tTMS 0.811, p D.001, \nd 0.23; ΔSHAM-HF-rTMS 0.59, SE 0.203, p .004, d 0.16), both \nHF-rTMS and LF-rTMS decreased tonic arousal when compared to sham \nstimulation, with no difference between the two stimulation conditions. \nTherefore, SCL results support H6. LF-rTMS alone reduced SCL signifi -\ncantly more when listening to an aversive sound when compared to \nsham (ΔSHAM-LF-rTMS 0.69, p .002, d 0.19). There were no sig-\nnificant differences between experimental neurostimulation conditions \nduring the regulation blocks. \nFor patients with misophonia, and supporting H5 and H6, HF-rTMS \nreduced SCL significantly more than sham when listening to either \naversive (ΔSHAM-HF-tTMS 0.63, p .009, d 0.18) or misophonic \nsounds (ΔSHAM-HF-tTMS 0.56, p .009, d 0.16) and when down -\nregulating misophonic sounds (ΔSHAM-HF-tTMS 0.73, p .006, d \n0.20). The lowest SCL when exposed to misophonic sounds in the \nmisophonia group was during the combination of behavioral skill uti-\nlization and HF-rTMS stimulation. H4 was not supported. \nTo investigate the effects of using only behavioral skills, we exam -\nined differences within the sham condition and found no significant \nreduction in SCL when implementing CR alone (i.e., sham stimulation \nduring listening was not significantly different from sham stimulation \nduring downregulation; ps F0.35). Thus, in both groups, excitatory \nneurostimulation alone reduced emotional distress. \nWe also aimed to examine differences across groups in SCL after \nreceiving different intervention approaches while listening to and \ndownregulating aversive and misophonic sounds. Therefore, we \ncompared tonic arousal across three conditions: when participants were \ndownregulating sounds in the sham condition; when participants were \nlistening to sounds and receiving HF-rTMS; when participants were \ndownregulating emotions associated with sounds while receiving HF- \nrTMS. For both aversive and misophonic sounds, neurostimulation \nalone (paversive 0.014; pmisophonic 0.014) or in combination with \ncognitive restructuring (paversive 0.017; pmisophonic 0.001) led to less \narousal than CR alone. There was no significant difference between \nneurostimulation alone and the combined approach (ps F0.10). \nTherefore, H7 was partially supported. There was also no difference \nbetween groups in response to these different interventions. This sug-\ngests that a neurostimulation-based treatment might be optimal for \nintervention for misophonia as well as emotional dysregulation. \n3.3.4. High-Frequency Heart Rate Variability (HF-HRV) results \nA MMANOVA analysis using an unstructured covariance structure \ndid not reveal any main effect of group, instruction provided, headache, \nor racial background (ps F0.05). Therefore, H3 was not supported. \nHowever, we found significant main effects of experimental neuro -\nstimulation type (F[2, 86.03] 6.37, p .003). Contrary to our expectations in H6, across both groups and all trials, HF-HRV was \nsignificantly higher in the sham condition when compared to either \nactive stimulation condition (pHF_rTMS 0.008; p LF_rTMS 0.001, ds \n0.10). In the same analysis, there was a significant main effect of HF- \nHRV value during habituation (F[1, 67.58] 1088.48, p D\n.00000001) and of coil-to-cortex distance (F[1, 121.62] 11.71, p D\n.0009), with lower coil-to-cortex distance (PE \u00000.02, SE 0.01) and \nhigher HF-HRV values during habituation (PE 0.82, SE 0.03) \nleading to higher HF-HRV values during experimental trials. Finally, \nonly a marginally significant interaction was found between experi -\nmental neurostimulation, instruction, and experimental group (F[22, \n130.82] 1.84, Bonferroni corrected p .076), and therefore the \ninteraction was not investigated further. \nIn sum, when controlling for the increase in HF-HRV induced by \nneurostimulation or sham alone, participants have higher HF-HRV \nduring the sham experimental trials than during the active stimulation \ntrials. Raw means of HF-HRV across groups are higher for active than for \nsham neurostimulation (MHF-rTMS 0.000186; MLF-rTMS 0.000166; \nMsham 0.000153), which is aligned with H6. \n3.4. Exit interview \nParticipants perceived response to neurostimulation varied; some \ncommented that neurostimulation either made them more numb to their \nfeelings while others commented that neurostimulation led them to feel \nthings more deeply. Participants with misophonia also described a sense \nof overwhelming hope, as well as wanting to laugh during the presen -\ntation of misophonic triggers because they were much less aversive than \nwhen experiencing these stimuli in the absence of neurostimulation. \nAll participants indicated an above-average willingness to engage in \nneurostimulation enhanced behavioral treatment to help reduce mental \nhealth distress (M 6.13, SD 2.64, range 0 –unwilling – 9 – extremely \nwilling; pgroup_difference 0.39). All participants found CR training very \nhelpful (M 7.59, SD 1.83, Range: 0–9; pgroup_difference 0.56), the \ncombined procedures highly acceptable Macceptability 8.13, SD 1.03, \nRange 0–9; pgroup_difference 0.68) and reported high likelihood to \nrecommend this treatment to a friend (M 74.98 %, SD 19.89, range \n0–100 %; pgroup_difference 0.88). \n4.Discussion \nEmerging research highlights that misophonia is a serious disorder \nthat significantly impairs the quality of life and functioning (Swedo \net al., 2022 ). Several studies have characterized misophonia across \nbehavioral and biological domains (Neacsiu et al., 2022a ; Brout et al., \n2018 ; Siepsiak et al., 2022 ); nevertheless, given the intense emotional \nreaction to specific sounds, it is yet unclear whether misophonia should \nbe considered a unique disorder under the purview of any particular \nclinical discipline. Furthermore, how to best intervene for those who \nmeet criteria for this disorder continues to be unclear (Palumbo et al., \n2018 ). Therefore, in this study, we compared adults with moderate and \nsevere misophonia severity to a transdiagnostic sample of adults who \nmeet criteria for a DSM-5 disorder and who self-report clinically high \ndifficulties with regulating emotions. We also examined whether in-\nterventions should aim to reduce sound reactivity or improve emotion \nregulation and whether neurostimulation, cognitive restructuring, or \ntheir combination offers the most promise to intervene on this disorder. \nThis study demonstrates that there are few psychophysiological \ndifferences in the response and regulation of distress related to sounds \nbetween clinical emotional dysregulation and misophonia. Prior pre-\nliminary studies did show psychophysiological differences (especially in \nSCR) between adults with misophonia and non-clinical controls (Kumar \net al., 2017 ). Our findings highlight that when confronted with trigger \nsounds, adults with misophonia are similar to adults who have signifi -\ncant difficulties regulating emotions with a range of DSM-5 disorders in \nphysiological reactivity and arousal.

Dialectical behavior therapy skills training \n(Neacsiu et al., 2014), adaptations of the unified protocol (Lewin et al., \n2021), or neurostimulation-augmented emotion regulation training may \nreduce emotion dysregulation across clinical samples (Neacsiu et al., \n2022b; Neacsiu et al., 2021; Neacsiu et al., 2021) and, therefore, may be \npromising approaches for new interventions for misophonia. \nSignificant differences were found in participants’ self-report of \ndistress and regulation. Specifically, clinical controls were more both-\nered by aversive sounds than those with misophonia; misophonic adults \nwere more upset when compared to controls following triggers and \nwhile trying to downregulate emotions induced by trigger sounds. In \nlight of the physiological findings, we interpret this as sensitization: the \nsounds that one finds most aversive (misophonic for participants with \nmisophonia and aversive for participants with emotional dysregulation) \nlead to heightened subjective experience of distress which doesn’t \nnecessarily mirror the psychophysiological response. In other words, if \none is bothered by a specific sound (i.e., is sensitized to it), hearing it \nmay lead to higher perception of distress than the body actually expe-\nriences. An alternative interpretation could be that SCL/SCR/HF-HRV \nare not appropriate measures to capture the difference in response be-\ntween groups and other objective measures should be tested to differ -\nentiate misophonia from clinical distress. Nevertheless, until a different \nmeasure is identified, interventions intended to change misophonic \ndistress should focus on self-reported distress as a unique differentiator \nfrom other clinical conditions. \nWe also examined whether the best way to approach intervention for \nmisophonic distress was to change top-down versus bottom-up pro-\ncesses. Using a functional imaging paradigm, we identified specific \nfunctionally connected regions in the anterior insular cortex and medial \nprefrontal cortex that were more engaged during the presentation of \nmisophonic versus neutral sounds. We examined whether intervening \nusing a bottom-up process, by inhibiting reactivity with the use of \nneurostimulation, was a potential intervention for misophonia. We also \nidentified the region in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that was \nmost active during regulation when compared to just listening to \nmisophonic sounds. We examined whether a top-down intervention, \nsimulated in the study by enhancing regulation with neurostimulation \nand/or the use of an emotion regulation skill, could be beneficial for \nmisophonia. Our design allowed us to compare both approaches. We \nfound clear superiority across both self-report and tonic arousal mea-\nsures for the top-down approach. Participants with misophonia experi -\nenced significantly less distress in the presence of misophonic triggers \nwhen their regulation network was engaged via either excitatory rTMS \nover the right dlPFC or the use of an emotion regulation skill. This \nfinding strongly suggests that interventions aimed towards emotion \nregulation have promise for misophonia. \nThere have been few neuroimaging findings for misophonia that \nhighlight dlPFC dysfunction (Neacsiu et al., 2022a). In one study, \nhealthy controls alone evidenced increased activity in the dlPFC when \nsuccessfully inhibiting behavior during a stop signal task. Participants \nwith misophonia did not display dlPFC changes during inhibition suc-\ncess (Eijsker et al., 2019). Our findings align with this study, given that \ninhibition during a stop signal task involves regulation. The lack of \nactivation in the dlPFC during regulation suggests that participants with \nmisophonia recruit other brain regions for regulation, which may lead to \na less efficient process. Promoting dlPFC activity during regulation, \nmay, therefore, restore a faulty process. It is important to highlight that \nthe majority of imaging studies with misophonia thus far have not \nincluded regulation paradigms (Neacsiu et al., 2022a). Therefore, the \nrole of the dlPFC in misophonia needs additional exploration. \nIn the last two decades, neurostimulation has accumulated exciting \nnew evidence that supports its potential for intervention (Lepping et al., \n2014). There are currently five neurostimulation-based protocols that \nare FDA approved for the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and smoking (Cohen et al., 2022), although research continues \nto be needed to validate these treatments and clarify long- and short- \nterm effects (Kumar et al., 2022). While initially neurostimulation was \nreserved for treatment-resistant cases, the evidence suggests that non- \ntreatment-resistant adults can benefit from this treatment (Voigt et al., \n2019), which opens up this approach to any condition as a candidate \nnovel intervention. In the case of misophonia, no clear pathway for \nintervention exists yet. Nevertheless, some findings suggest that cogni -\ntive behavioral therapy (Jager et al., 2021; Cecilione et al., 2022) and \nthe use of emotion regulation skills (Lewin et al., 2021; Tonarely-Busto \net al., 2022) can offer promise for misophonia. We, therefore, wanted to \ncompare whether neurostimulation alone, emotion regulation alone, or \ntheir combination lead to the biggest decrease in distress. \nFirst, it is important to highlight that engaging in either cognitive \nregulation or neurostimulation alone reduced distress when compared \nto no intervention for both misophonic and emotionally dysregulated \nadults. Thus, both neurostimulation and emotion regulation training \nshould be considered important options for future misophonia in-\nterventions. Second, the combined intervention on both misophonic and \naversive sounds led to significantly less self-reported distress and lower \ntonic arousal when compared to implementing the emotion regulation \nskill alone. Self-report results showed the superiority of the behavioral \nintervention alone versus the neurostimulation alone, while the finding \nwas reversed for the tonic arousal measure. Therefore, if the intended \noutcome is a reduction in physiological arousal, neurostimulation out-\nperforms behavioral skills. Nevertheless, when it comes to perceived \ndistress, behavioral intervention reduces this perception more so than \nneurostimulation alone. Given that we found differences primarily in \nself-reported distress, these findings suggest that a combination of \nneurostimulation and emotion regulation training is a promising avenue \nfor a misophonia intervention. If a combined treatment is not possible, a \nbehavioral intervention focused on emotion regulation holds more \npromise than exposing participants to sounds alone. \nThere were some key differences between our study and prior \nstudies. First, in our prior examination of psychophysiology during \nneurostimulation, we found no difference between active and sham \nrTMS in heart rate variability and indices of arousal (Neacsiu et al., \n2022b; Neacsiu et al., 2021). In this study, HF-rTMS increased HF-HRV \nsignificantly more than sham during the habituation period, and both \ntypes of stimulation increased arousal more than sham. This difference \nmay be due to the procedures employed. This study employed an \nenhanced stimulation regimen with shorter ITT (15 vs. 26 s) and more \npulses administered in a shorter amount of time (3 vs 10 min). More \nintensive excitatory neurostimulation may lead to more effect on HF- \nHRV, and the shorter duration may not allow sufficient time for \nbehavioral regulation alone to happen. Furthermore, across all experi -\nmental conditions, HF-HRV ended up being higher in sham than in \nactive neurostimulation conditions when controlling for the enhanced \neffect of neurostimulation alone on this measure during habituation. \nThis would suggest that rTMS does not enhance regulation, but rather it \nfacilitates a faster regulation process. Indeed, in our prior trial, where \nparticipants regulated for 10 min, the sham condition “caught up” and \nshowed similar HF-HRV towards the end of the regulation period, but \nwas significantly different at the beginning of the regulation period \n(Neacsiu et al., 2022b). \nAs in other studies (Stokes et al., 2005; Neacsiu et al., 2022b), we \nfound that coil-to-cortex distance was a significant covariate; a larger \ndistance predicted less efficacy of neurostimulation for several out-\ncomes. Greater distance means that the strength of the electric field \ninduced by neurostimulation is reduced by the time it reaches the \ncortical target, and, therefore, the efficacy of neuromodulation de-\ncreases. Furthermore, the presence of headaches increased skin response \nduring experimental trials. Therefore, future research should control for \nthese variables when interpreting outcomes. \nOur findings also are relevant to the development of emotion regu-\nlation interventions in people without misophonia.

In other words, \nadults with emotion dysregulation may need additional support to \nimplement emotion regulation skills successfully. Furthermore, as with \nmisophonia, the combination of behavioral skills and neuromodulation \nled to the least distress, suggesting that future interventions should focus \non this combined approach for maximum benefit. This finding aligns \nwell with research that highlights the superiority of behavioral therapy \nin tandem with neurostimulation when compared to behavioral therapy \nalone (Neacsiu et al., 2022b; Kozel et al., 2018). The hypothesized \nmechanism is that neurostimulation facilitates neural processing in \nlocalized cortical regions via inducing Hebbian-like plasticity (Stefan \net al., 2000) which may have therapeutic effects and may remediate \ndeficits in affected neural networks (Luber et al., 2008). \nThese results should be considered in light of several key limitations. \nWhile the study was adequately powered, the sample size was small and \nlacked racial and ethnic diversity across groups. Results should be \nreplicated with a larger sample size and better representation of \nminoritized populations. A full factorial design could have clarified \nwhether the stimulation intensity or brain region stimulated was the \nactive ingredient for the results we found. Future replications should \nconsider executing a complete stimulation by region and by group \nexperimental design (HF vs. LF, insula vs. dlPFC, misophonia vs control). \nLF-rTMS was applied at 90 % MT and HF-rTMS was applied at 120 % MT \nper existing protocols at the time when the study was designed. The \nsuperiority of HF-rTMS may be due to the higher stimulation intensity. \nHigher LF-rTMS intensity and alternative ways to target the anterior \ninsula should be investigated before completely discounting the viability \nof targeting with neurostimulation the anterior insula via its functional \nconnectivity with the mPFC to treat misophonia or emotional dysregu -\nlation. Despite our efforts to control for cumulative effects, lingering \nrTMS effects may have also influenced the results. A between-subjects \ndesign would be ideal for a replication study to rule out the influence \nof cumulative effects, although here we controlled for task order and \npresented experimental conditions in a randomized order. Lastly, there \nwere several protocol deviations engaged that may confound study re-\nsults. We included all data available and described our study deviations \nbecause the problems we encounter mimic real-world issues and solu-\ntions that would need to be implemented in a community practice \nshould an intervention emerge from our protocol. \nAlternative neurostimulation techniques, such as the use of trans -\ncranial electrical stimulation, may also be important lines of research for \nfuture intervention development. For example, tinnitus symptoms were \nshown to be modulated by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) \n(Vanneste et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2018). Transcranial alternating \ncurrent stimulation (tACS) may facilitate improvement in cognition as \nwell as in depressive symptoms, with mixed results associated with \namelioration of schizophrenia symptoms (Lee et al., 2022). Both non- \ninvasive electrical neurostimulation modalities are safe and well- \ntolerated (Matsumoto and Ugawa, 2016). The precision of targeting is \nreduced with these alternative methods when compared to rTMS \nalthough these methods are less costly and may lead to more scalable \ninterventions. Therefore, conduction of blinded, randomized placebo- \ncontrolled trials would be needed to evaluate its clinical application \nand efficacy. \nTaken together, these findings highlight that neurostimulation and \ncognitive restructuring are promising avenues of intervention for \nmisophonia, with their combination showing the most promise. \nEngaging in regulation may lead to more reduction in misophonic \ndistress than attempting to inhibit reactivity to sounds. Adults with \nmisophonia have similar psychophysiological responses to stress and \ntriggers as adults with clinical emotional dysregulation, although self- \nreported distress differentiates groups. This highlights the conclusion that misophonia may be a disorder comparable to other DSM disorders \nand that additional biomarkers that capture the unique misophonic \ndistress are still needed. It is important to highlight that our study \nsampled different approaches for intervention, but did not test an \nintervention per se. Future studies should examine the short and long- \nterm effects of neurostimulation, emotion regulation, or their combi -\nnation for misophonia. \nFunding sources \nThis research and the completion of the manuscript were supported \nby a Misophonia Fund award granted to the first author by the REAM \nFoundation. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nAndrada D.
