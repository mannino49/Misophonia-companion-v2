  "abstract": "This article presents a historical review of society's changed perceptions of the values of childhood from the 1st century A.D. to the present. Factors that have influenced the responsibilities subsequently placed on the mother because of her \"natural and instinctual\" abilities are discussed. Until the 20th century, children received little attention from the scientific community. There is now much empirical evidence to guide practitioners in addressing the physical and psychological needs of children. However, assumptions are made by clinicians that the primary, if not critical, responsibility for the child's growth, development, and behavior should be placed on the mother. This can result in mothers being blamed for the behavioral errors and problems of their children first.",
