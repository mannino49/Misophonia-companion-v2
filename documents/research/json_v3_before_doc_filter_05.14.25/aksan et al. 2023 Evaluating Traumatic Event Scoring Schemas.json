Prospective, comprehensive \nstudies of childhood trauma are needed to understand the pathways of \nadjustment after exposure to better delineate risk for and resiliency \nagainst psychopathology. \nAmong the central issues in understanding the impact of trauma in \npediatric populations is relying on a measurement framework that as-\nsesses clinical outcomes broadly rather than narrowly. Studies that have \nprospectively examined trauma-affected youth have adopted a limited \noutcome measurement framework. Typically, clinical evaluation is \nlimited to symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder \n(PTSD) (e.g., Kennedy et al., 2009, 2010), ratings of broad spectrum \nexternalizing and internalizing symptoms (e.g., Briggs et al., 2021; Kisiel \net al., 2014; Hogdon et al., 2019). This is informative but not a substitute \nfor standard clinical interviews that can evaluate whether criteria are \nmet for a broad array of diagnoses beyond those most commonly seen \nfollowing trauma. \nAnother central issue in understanding the impact of childhood \ntrauma concerns how best to summarize responses from trauma expo-\nsure checklists to facilitate an understanding of the clinical sequelae. \nRasmussen et al. (2020) noted a simple count of event types from trauma \nscreening checklists captures variety rather than actual count of trau-\nmatic events. Although event count and variety counts are intercorre -\nlated, variety-based scores appear to show stronger associations with \nsymptoms of PTSD. Reliance on cumulative trauma scores is common (e. \ng., Alisic et al., 2014) but this approach has garnered criticism because it \nassumes each traumatic experience contributes similarly to outcomes. \nCumulative trauma counts can obscure identification and delineation of \nemotional and behavioral concerns specific to certain types of trauma \n(Briggs et al., 2021; Kulkarni et al., 2011; Putnam et al., 2020). Simi-\nlarly, complex trauma presentations demonstrate the unique sympto -\nmology tied to chronic trauma and/or multiple trauma exposures rather \nthan certain types of traumas (Maercker et al., 2022). \nStudies examining domains of trauma have shown factor analytic \nsupport for distinctions among trauma events. For example, the initial \nACEs proposal for distinguishing household dysfunction (e.g., parental \nmental illness) and maltreatment (e.g., abuse) factors (Felitti et al., \n1998; Negriff, 2020) were supported by follow-up psychometric studies \n(Afifi et al., 2020; Mersky et al., 2016). Others have supported correlated \nbut distinct physical and sexual abuse factors (Ford et al., 2014) or that \nparental loss/separation emerges as a distinct factor (Green et al., 2010; \nMersky et al., 2016). Samples drawn from treatment-seeking youth in \nsocial service settings, the National Child Traumatic Stress Network \n(NCTSN) core data, have pointed to five domains: 1) maltreatment \n(neglect, emotional abuse, impaired caregiver, domestic violence, \nphysical abuse), 2) acute trauma (injury, illness, traumatic loss/sepa -\nration, natural disaster), 3) community trauma (war/political violence \nin the U.S., school violence, community violence), 4) assault (sexual \nassault/rape, sexual abuse, physical assault), and 5) trauma based in \ninternational war contexts (Pynoos et al., 2014). The only other youth \nsample to our knowledge that examined factor structure in ACEs sup-\nported the original two factor solution among adolescents (Afifi et al., \n2020). \nStudies that capture traumatic burden in different domains have \nshown differential associations with mental health outcomes. For \nexample, youth exposed to interpersonal traumas (i.e. sexual, physical \nabuse) had increased odds of major depressive, substance use, PTSD \ndiagnoses and were also more likely to endorse delinquency and asso-\nciation with delinquent peers compared to youth exposed to accidents/ \ndisasters and community violence (Ford et al., 2010). Several findings \nfrom the NCTSN also support complexity in clinical profiles of exposure \nto interpersonal traumas that include maltreatment, physical, sexual \nabuse compared to trauma burden in the acute domain or household \ndysfunction (Dierkhising et al., 2013; Hodgdon et al., 2019; Kisiel et al., \n2014). For example, interpersonal traumas were associated with PTSD, \nexternalizing, and internalizing symptoms while household dysfunction \nwas associated with externalizing only, acute trauma with internalizing only, and trauma from violence in the community was associated with \nPTSD and externalizing (Hogdon et al., 2019). These findings suggest \ndomain-specific characterization of trauma may improve specificity in \nunderstanding risk and resiliency pathways. \n1.1. Present study \nAmong the central limitations of the evidence to date is that findings \nprimarily reflect samples that are receiving social services/treatment or \nare recruited from populations with exposure to specific traumas. \nOutcome assessments often lack standardized comprehensive screening \nfor clinical diagnoses. Our goal in this study is to report baseline data \nfrom the Texas Childhood Trauma Research Network (TX-CTRN) which \nwas designed to address these limitations. TX-CTRN was established in \n2020 as a multi-site collaboration to develop a state-wide registry of \nchildren and youth (8–20 years of age) who have experienced a trau-\nmatic lifetime event. Recruitment is broad and includes trauma centers, \nemergency departments, pediatric and primary care clinics, and other \ncommunity settings. The goal of the registry is to inform trajectories of \nmental health and to develop models of risk and resilience after trauma. \nTo that end, standard clinical interviews of the child are conducted at \nbaseline to capture both trauma exposure and clinical diagnoses. As-\nsessments are repeated every 6 months for 2 years to prospectively \ncapture trajectories of both symptoms and additional traumas. \nGiven the overarching goal of TX-CTRN, the study protocol relied on \na comprehensive instrument, the Traumatic Event Screening Inventory \n(TESI-C; Ford et al., 2000) to assess history of witnessed and directly \nexperienced 20 trauma types shown in Table 1. For each trauma item, \nTESI-C captures simple exposure, exposures that meet DSM-5 Criterion- \nA, and frequency of exposure to each type of event. Given the clinical \nsequelae of bullying in youth (Wagner, 2018; Winding et al., 2020), two \nsimple exposure items were added regarding in-person and cyberbul -\nlying (Table 1). \nOur first aim was to examine how the item-content of TESI-C may be \norganized with respect to ‘domains’ of trauma relying on confirmatory \nfactor analysis of the frequency ratings of 20 items. We adopted a \nconceptually agnostic, item-content driven lens to ask the following \nquestions: a) are typically intentional/interpersonal harms (physical, \nsexual abuse) distinct from typically unintentional harms (accidents, \nmedical trauma, loss); b) are distinctions between witnessing vs directly \nexperiencing harms supported; and c) does the context and manner of \nintentional/interpersonal harms produce additional distinctions in the \nlatent factor structure? For example, we asked if bullying items and the \nsingle sexual abuse item were best thought of as distinct ‘domains’ of \nintentional/interpersonal traumas from the items that assess threatened \nor actual physical harms (i.e. item 2.1 through 2.4 in Table 1). We also \nasked whether witnessing violence in the home versus in the community \nwere distinct. \nOur second aim was to rely on the domains identified in the factor \nanalytic setting to generate various ‘scoring schemas’ and examine \nwhich schemas provided the ‘best’ prediction for concurrent diagnostic \nprofiles from clinical interviews. Scoring schemas included both cu-\nmulative count and domain-specific counts of trauma burden (e.g., \nintentional/interpersonal harms). We further differentiated scoring \nschemas by counting only those exposures that met PTSD Criterion-A \nand counting all endorsed exposures irrespective of Criterion-A. In \naddition, responses to “who was involved” follow-up query to TESI-C \nevents (e.g., parent/caregiver, other family members) were included \nas predictors. Higher levels of parental or family involvement in the \n‘worst’ events across all interpersonal harms would be a marker of risk \nfor persistent trauma whereas higher levels of non-family involvement \nmay lack that persistency across time and context. We evaluated the \nstrength of concurrent prediction in the following three settings: a) \nwhich schema distinguishes children without any diagnosis from those \nwho have at least one; b) which schema predicts broad categories of \ndisorders such as PTSD, depressive episodes/ disorders, suicidality N.

Sample \nRecruitment for TX-CTRN occurred across 12 academic medical \ncenters in Texas, including University of Texas (UT) Southwestern \nMedical Center, Baylor College of Medicine, UT-Rio Grande Valley, UT- \nHealth Science Center at Tyler, UT-Health Science Center at Houston, \nTexas Tech University Health Science Center Lubbock, UT-Austin Dell \nMedical School, UT-Health Science Center at San Antonio, University of \nNorth Texas Health Science Center, Texas A&M Health Science Center, \nTexas Tech University Health Science Center El Paso, UT-Medical \nBranch. \nInclusion criteria included: 1) youth have a history of trauma expo-\nsure that fulfills DSM-5 Criterion-A for PTSD, and/or have experienced \nless severe but persistent forms of childhood trauma including bullying; \n2) between 8 and 20 years of age; 3) able to provide consent for 18–20 \nyear-olds, assent for those under 18 with parental consent; 4) able to \nspeak and read English or Spanish; 5) function at a level that allows \naccurate completion of the assessment instruments; 6) willing to dedi-\ncate appropriate time to complete scheduled study assessments. Exclu -\nsion criteria included either the child or the consenting parent being: a) \nintoxicated; b) not alert/ oriented/ or coherent/ or medically unstable; \nc) exhibiting psychotic symptoms; or d) the child had pervasive devel -\nopmental disorder/ moderate intellectual disability. \nRecruitment and follow-up assessments are ongoing at the time of \nthe current report. For the current report, only the baseline data were \nextracted. 1289 participants completed the baseline assessments. \nBecause 403 youth were older than 18 years and did not have a \nparticipating parent, we do not have information on parental/family \nincome or parental age from this subsample. Among those who partic -\nipated with a parent, 854 parents indicated a mean age of 43.5 years (SD \n8.9 years) and the distribution of parental/family income for the 859 \nparents who reported it were as follows: 20.2 % D$25,000, 21.6 % \nbetween $25,000 –$49,999, 27.6 % between $50,000 –$99,999, 17 % \nbetween $100,000 –$199,999, 7.9 % F$200,000, and 5.6 % indicated \nthey did not know income. The participants were compensated $100 at \nbaseline. \n2.2. Measures \nIn the current report, we utilized the TESI-C (Ford et al., 2000 ), and \ntwo well-established interviews to characterize children's clinical diag-\nnostic profile: MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Chil-\ndren and Adolescents MINI-KID (Sheehan et al., 2010 ) and Clinician- \nAdministered PTSD Scale for DSM-5, Child/Adolescent Version (CAPS- \nCA-5; Pynoos et al., 2015 ). The MINI-KID is a well-established structured \ndiagnostic interview used to assess the presence of several DSM-child \nand adolescent psychiatric disorders and risk of suicide. CAPS-CA-5 is \na semi-structured interview to measure severity of PTSD symptoms. \nAll three instruments were administered by trained research assis-\ntants. Shahidullah et al. (2023) described the training and certification \nprocess for research assistants across the clinical sites. The interrater \nreliabilities were excellent. Median Kappa for TESI-C items was 0.79, \nmedian weighted Kappa for CAPS-CA-5 was 0.71. The major depressive \nepisode and PTSD modules were evaluated for interrater reliability due \nto their clinical relevance in childhood trauma; the median Kappa was \n0.71 and 0.91 respectively on the MINI-KID. \n2.2.1. TESI-C \nTESI-C is a clinician-administered interview that assesses a child's \nexperience of potential traumatic events, including injuries, hospitali -\nzations, domestic violence, community violence, disasters, accidents, \nphysical and sexual abuse. It is widely used with individuals aged 6–18 \n(e.g., Choi et al., 2019 ). At the baseline visit it is used to identify lifetime \ntraumatic experiences.

When the participant endorsed the type of event described, \nthey were asked to think of the worst instance of that type of event and \ndescribe details. Descriptions were systematically queried for ‘who was \ninvolved ’ (e.g., parent/caregiver, family, non-family) and responses to \nthese follow-up questions were counted across all TESI-C items as \nparent/caregiver, family members, and non-family members as three \nseparate variables in the predictive analyses of aim-2. \n2.2.2. Data reduction for clinical/ diagnostic profile \nSeveral specific categories within the MINI-KID were combined to \nform larger clinical/ diagnostic profiles to facilitate robust inference \nwith respect to clinically distinct problems of interest in trauma-exposed \npopulations and reduce type-I error rate. Specifically, PTSD diagnosis \nfrom either the CAPS-CA-5 or the MINI-KID were pooled into a binary \noutcome of PTSD versus not, anxiety disorders from the MINI-KID were \npooled into a binary outcome of anxiety-related disorders (i.e., gener -\nalized anxiety, separation anxiety, simple phobia, social phobia, panic \ndisorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, agoraphobia) versus not, and \ndistinctions among depressive episodes and/or disorders (i.e., major \ndepressive disorder, recurrent, current etc.) were combined into a single \ncategory of depressive versus not. Similarly, four additional binary \noutcomes were formed by combining specific MINI-KID categories \nrelevant to suicidality/ suicide behavior disorder versus not, external -\nizing disorders (i.e., oppositional defiant, conduct disorder, attention- \ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder) versus not, substance misuse (i.e., \nalcohol and substance use disorders) versus not, and serious mental \nillness (e.g., various bipolar disorders, manic/hypomanic episodes, and/ \nor psychotic disorders) versus not. Respondents who did not meet \ncriteria for any of the specific diagnoses were pooled into a binary \noutcome of no diagnosis versus at least one diagnosis. Finally, we \nformed a binary comorbid outcome contrasting those with any single \ndisorder with those who met criteria for at least two. In specifying \nchildren who had no diagnoses and those who were comorbid, addi-\ntional specific diagnostic categories such as eating disorders, Tic/Tour -\nette's were also taken into consideration. \n2.3. Analytic plan \nData cleaning and predictive analyses were carried out in STATA \nversion 16.1 (StataCorp, 2019 ) and confirmatory factor analyses were \ncarried out in Mplus 8.8 (Muth ˘en and Muth ˘en, 1998-2017 ). For the first \naim, identifying domains of trauma from the frequency ratings for 20 \nevent types, we relied on confirmatory factor analytic methods. Because \nthe distribution of the frequency ratings from the TESI-C were generally \nskewed, robust maximum likelihood was used and comparison of nested \nmodels relied on Satorra-Bentler scaling of chi-square. The scales of the \nlatent factors were defined by fixing the respective latent factor vari-\nances to one, each of the 20 items were only allowed to load on their \nrespective factor in a given model and no residual correlations among \nthe items were permitted. Following Kaplan (2001) , we examined ab-\nsolute and relative model fit in the following ways: a) comparing \nimprovement in fit among nested models with chi-square difference \ntests, b) Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Compar -\native Fit Index (CFI), Information Criteria (Akaike, AIC and Bayesian, \nBIC), and standardized root mean square error (SRMR). Latent factor \ncorrelations exceeding 1 or negative residual error variances were \nconsidered indications of a poor model and eliminated from further \nconsideration. The CFA models began with a single-factor model and \nincreased in complexity to address the questions raised in the \nintroduction. \nGuided by the results of the CFA for domains of trauma, we con-\nstructed observed sums that could be readily computed in clinical set-\ntings using binary endorsement of specific items, either simple exposure \nor DSM-5 PTSD Criterion-A to generate each ‘schema. ’ There were a total of six scoring schemas: 1) Domain-specific counts of individual \nitems where Criterion-A was met; 2) domain specific counts of in-\ndividuals items where simple exposure was endorsed; 3) count of all \nitems where Criterion-A was met; 4) count of all simple exposures \nendorsed; 5) count of the number of domains where at least one item met \nCriterion-A and 6) count of the number of domains where at least one \nsimple exposure item was endorsed. A series of logistic regressions then \nexamined the concurrent predictive value of each schema along with the \nthree subtotals for ‘who was involved ’ (parents/caregivers, other family, \nnon-family) for broad diagnostic outcomes. We examined the relative \nperformance of each ‘schema ’ in predicting: a) respondents who had no \ndiagnoses from those who had at least one disorder, b) predicting broad \ncategories of disorders among those who had at least one disorder, and \nc) comorbidity status among those who had at least one disorder. The \ncriteria for selecting the best ‘schema ’ relied chiefly on information \ncriteria (AIC), as different ‘schemas ’ had varying degrees of freedom. \nFinally, for the best schema, we examined whether the predictive value \nof the TESI-C scores were robust to statistical controls for demographic \nvariables with an additional set of logistic regressions. \n3.Results \nTable 2 shows distributions for demographic and outcome variables \nand Table 3 shows the distribution of TESI-C items, and proportion of \ncases that met Criterion-A.

Because model M3 failed due to latent factor correlations \nexceeding 1, we also fit a simplified model M4 where the distinction \nbetween witnessed versus experienced were only applied to intentional/ \ninterpersonal harm items. As indicated in the introduction, we also \ntested distinctions within intentional interpersonal experienced harms \nbased on context and manner of harm (models M5, M6, M7). Nested \nmodel comparisons relied on Satorra-Bentler scaling of chi-square which \nare shown with reference to model numbers and the associated p-value. \nThe best fitting model, M6, was consistent with a domain structure \nwhere intentional harms differed by both the manner and the context of \nharm. For example, witnessed intentional harms differed depending on the context: inside the home versus not. Among experienced intentional \nharms, bullying was distinct from other harms that included sexual \nabuse, physical assault/ attacks/ mugging/ kidnapping, and verbal \nthreat of physical harms. We did not have sufficient evidence to support \nthe distinctiveness of sexual abuse from other intentional experienced \nphysical harms, and hence we accepted the five-factor model as the best \nand parsimonious option. The final retained factors included: 1) inten -\ntional experienced harms (e.g., sexual and physical abuse), 2) bullying, \n3) intentional harms witnessed outside the home (e.g., witnessing \ncommunity violence), 4) intentional harms witnessed inside the home \n(e.g., witnessing domestic violence), and 5) unintentional harms (e.g., \naccidents, illness). In all models, two items, being involved in an acci-\ndent and being hospitalized, did not load significantly to the uninten -\ntional harm latent factor. (TableS1). \n3.2. Aim-2: evaluating concurrent predictive value of TESI-C scoring \nschemas \nGuided by the results of the CFA, we constructed observed summary \nscores for six ‘scoring schemas. ’ These were: 1) Domain-specific counts \nof individual items where PTSD Criterion-A was met; 2) domain specific \ncounts of individuals items where simple exposure was endorsed; 3) \ncount of all items where Criterion-A was met; 4) count of all simple \nexposures endorsed; 5) count of domains within which at least one item \nmet Criterion-A and 6) count of domains within which at least one \nsimple exposure item was endorsed. The first part of Table 5 shows the \nunivariate sample statistics for these summary scores. The maximum \nSpearman-rank correlation among the domain-specific ‘scoring schema ’ \nvariables was 0.41 with Criterion-A totals and 0.46 with simple exposure \ntotals which support specificity among trauma domains. The second half \nof Table 5 addresses the second aim: which scoring schema provides the \n‘best ’ concurrent predictive value for particular diagnostic profiles with \na series of logistic regressions. In addition to AIC, Table 4 also reports the \nproportion of TESI-C predictors that significantly contributed to pre-\ndiction. Scoring schemas with the lowest AIC for the given outcome are \nbolded. (See TableS2 for full results). \nResults show that in distinguishing respondents who had no di-\nagnoses at baseline from those with at least one diagnosis, scoring \nschema#1 has the lowest AIC. In addition, for scoring schema#1, three \nout of five PTSD Criterion-A trauma domain predictors were significant \nand one out of 3 predictors on ‘who was involved ’ were significant. \nScoring schema#1 also had the lowest AIC for five out of eight di-\nagnoses: PTSD, depression, suicidality, substance misuse, and comor -\nbidity. Importantly, for outcomes where the scoring schema associated \nwith the lowest AIC were different than schema#1 (i.e., schema #2 \nthrough #6), two things were noteworthy. First the TESI-C trauma \ndomain predictors were not significant for externalizing and second the \ndifference in the AIC associated with the scoring schema #1 and the \nlowest AIC for a different scoring schema were small for anxiety (0.10). \nOnly in the case of serious mental illness, schema#2, domain-specific \nsimple exposure count produced a notably smaller AIC. \nCollectively, these findings supported scoring schema#1, the sum of \nall items in each trauma domain separately where the incident described \nby the respondent meets Criterion-A, as the best performing schema \namong the six evaluated. Table 6 shows the results of the final set of \nlogistic regressions for each of nine outcomes, along with odds ratios \nwhile controlling for demographic variables. The findings showed that \nboys were more likely to have no diagnosis, and less likely to meet \ncriteria for PTSD, other anxiety, depression, suicidality, and more likely \nto meet criteria for externalizing. Older respondents were less likely to \nhave no diagnosis, more likely to meet criteria for PTSD, depression, and \nsubstance use diagnoses, less likely to meet criteria for externalizing, \nand more likely to have comorbidities. Respondents with minoritized \nstatus were more likely to meet criteria for PTSD and less likely to meet \ncriteria for substance misuse.

Interpersonal experienced traumas \nincluding sexual abuse were associated with greater odds of each diag-\nnostic outcome we examined except substance misuse. Unintentional \nharms were associated with lower odds of depression. Interpersonal \nwitnessed harms at home were associated with greater odds of PTSD and \nsuicidality. Bullying was associated with greater odds of depression, \nsuicidality, externalizing, serious mental illness, and comorbid status. \nThe follow-up items concerning who was involved in these events pro-\nvided additional predictive power. Parental involvement was associated \nwith lower odds of depression but greater odds of serious mental illness. \nNonfamily involvement was associated with greater odds of substance \nmisuse. \n4.Discussion \nThe findings from this TX-CTRN report were consistent with others \nfrom the literature despite fundamental differences in measurement \nframework, sample characteristics, and analytic methods used. We \ndiscuss consistencies with prior works concerning both trauma domains \nand associations with outcomes and point out novel added value of this \nreport to the evidence base. \nThe specific domains that were supported in this report aligned with \nnotable prior findings despite lack of ‘alignment ’ in item content of \ntraumas from one study to another. For example, principal component \nanalyses from the NCTSN supported an acute trauma dimension that \naligned with what we labeled ‘unintentional harms ’ (Pynoos et al., \n2014 ). Sexual abuse did not separate out in our sample from exposure to \nother intentional, interpersonal and physically abusive traumas. This is consistent with Putnam et al. (2020) who found sexual abuse to pair up \nwith other intentional interpersonal experienced harms in person- \ncentered analyses of the NCTSN core data. Findings on distinctive as-\nsociations of community and family violence (e.g., Kennedy et al., 2009, \n2010 ; Kulkarni et al., 2011 ; Hogdon et al., 2019) align with the \ndistinction we observed in intentional witnessed harms in the home \nversus outside the home. \nResults showed that adopting a domain-based approach to exposure \ncharacterization was superior in concurrent prediction of interview- \nbased clinical profiles. Findings also supported reliance on whether \nthe event met DSM-5 PTSD Criterion-A when generating domain- \nspecific trauma burden scores as opposed to simple endorsement. An \nimportant strength of this report relative to prior studies concerned the \nbreadth of the predictive validity we demonstrated for domain-specific \ntrauma burden scores. Most prior works had examined predictions of \ntrauma burden in relation to a limited set of outcomes such as PTSD, \ndepression, internalizing, and externalizing ratings. We cast a wider net \nthat included PTSD, anxiety disorders, depression, suicidality, exter -\nnalizing, substance misuse, and serious mental illness. With the excep -\ntion of externalizing diagnoses, burden in trauma domains and who was \ninvolved contributed to the prediction of these diagnoses. Domain- \nspecific trauma burden scores also distinguished those without any \ndiagnosis from those with at least one diagnosis and distinguished those \nwith a single diagnosis from those with comorbidities. These predictions \nheld above and beyond child age, gender and minority status. Results \nshowed that exposure to intentional, interpersonal and directly experi -\nenced traumas predicted every outcome except substance misuse. \nExposure to intentional, interpersonal but witnessed traumas in the \nhome, also added uniquely to PTSD, suicidality, and comorbidity.

Limitations \nWe relied on retrospective assessment of lifetime trauma from chil-\ndren and youth at baseline. The design of TX-CTRN will remedy this \nspecific limitation of the current report as follow-up prospective data \ncollection includes exposure to additional traumas and repeated as-\nsessments of clinical symptoms every six months. An important limita -\ntion of our assessments was that we were unable to obtain assessments of \n‘neglect. ’ Neglect, whether emotional or with respect to basic needs, \nwere not part of the TESI-C items, and should be included in future work. \nIt is likely however that many children who experienced neglect also \nendorsed instances of interpersonal experienced and witnessed harms in \nthe home and/or community as prior research has shown neglect to co- \noccur with these intentional harms in both variable-centered and \nperson-centered analyses (e.g., Brown et al., 2019 ; Pynoos et al., 2014 ). \nFinally, although our outcome measurement framework is broader in \nbreadth than prior works, we pooled across granular distinctions among \nMINI-Kid diagnoses to create clinically distinct problems to facilitate \nrobust inference. Future work will remedy this limitation as more \nfocused questions are posed of this registry. \n4.2. Conclusions \nThe current study addressed several limitations of prior research in \nlaying the groundwork for prospectively charting pathways of adjust -\nment following traumatic exposure. A broad base recruitment strategy \nof children, youth and their caregivers allowed us to sample a broad \nrange of traumatic exposures. Both the screening for traumas and clin-\nical diagnoses were done with standardized clinical interviews. Findings \nlargely aligned with earlier studies on the relative importance of \nintentional interpersonal traumas and suggested bullying maybe an \nimportant source of traumatic stress that independently adds to pre-\ndiction of several diagnoses. \nCRediT authorship contribution statement \nDJN, KDW, CBM, JS responsible for study design and measurement \nprotocol; JDS responsible for training of research interviewers; JR \nresponsible for setting up the RedCap database for all instruments across \nmultiple sites; AGG, LT, RR, IL, JC,CG, CGD, JC, SLC, PJR, responsible \nfor critical review of write-up and assistance in literature review, NA \nresponsible for analyses, write-up and posing the questions addressed in \nthis report.
