Houghton \nIntroduction \nObsessive-compulsive related disorders (OCRDs) are generally con­\nceptualized as fear-based and impulse-control disorders, in which the \npathology is attributed to maladaptive cognitions, diﬃculty regulating \nemotions, and impaired self-control. These “top-down ” conceptualizations \ndominate most theoretical models of OCD. However, potentially impor­\ntant “bottom-up ” processes have been identiﬁed, which may help inform \nneurodevelopmental models of OCD. From as far back as 1903, Pierre \nJanet ’s early account of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) described \nthe foundation of the illness as a psychasthenic state characterized by \nfeelings of ‘incompleteness ’ (Pitman, 1987). Janet depicted incompleteness \nas a chronic sense of perceptual unease in which the imperfections of the \nworld feel intolerable and states of uniformity and order are constantly \nsought. While Janet ’s model fell out of favor among theorists for nearly a \ncentury, ﬁndings from recent research warrant reconsideration. A growing \nbody of research has indeed documented abnormal sensory phenomena in \nOCRDs including OCD as well as chronic tic disorder (CTD), body-\nfocused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs) (e.g., trichotillomania, excoriation \ndisorder), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), and health anxiety disorder \n(HAD). Evidence suggests these experiences are not epi-phenomenal, but \nrather that dysregulation of sensory and perceptual processes may precede \nthe clinical onset of OCRDs, have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on symptom \nexpression, and therefore may represent a key neurodevelopmental com­\nponent of OCRD etiology. \nPremonitory urges \nAlthough many compulsive behavior symptoms of OCRDs are preceded \nby cognitive or aﬀective events, some are completed without any explicit \nreason or justiﬁcation.

This \nis most clearly seen in CTD, as tics are purposeless behaviors that lack \nobsessional precursors. Persons with CTDs frequently describe “pre­\nmonitory urges ” that precede tics and are temporarily alleviated upon tic \nexecution (Banaschewski et al., 2003; Leckman et al., 1993). Accordingly, \ntheorists posited that premonitory urges may act as negative reinforcers \nand represent a key factor maintaining tic symptoms. Since the identiﬁca­\ntion of premonitory urges as potentially important aspects of CTDs, \nresearch has likewise identiﬁed similar premonitory urge phenomena in \nother OCRDs. These will be discussed in the following sections. \nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) \nMany individuals with OCD report experiencing abnormal sensory phe­\nnomena and premonitory urges that instigate symptoms. In fact, even \n“cognitive ” obsessions in OCD are known to often contain rich sensory \nfeatures (Porth & Geller, 2018), such as in cases where contamination \nfears and washing compulsions are brought on, owing to physical sensa­\ntions that one’s hands are “dirty” or “greasy ” (Lapidus et al., 2014; Ola­\ntunji et al., 2007; Shapira et al., 2003; Stein et al., 2001). Explicit sensory \nexperiences and urges that occur outside of cognitive obsessions are \ndescribed in a variety of ways, including “not just right” experiences \n(Coles et al., 2003; Diniz et al., 2006; Ecker & Gönner, 2008; Ghisi et al., \n2010; Leckman et al., 1994; Lee et al., 2009; Moretz & McKay, 2009; \nSummers et al., 2014), feelings of “incompleteness ” (Ecker & Gönner, \n2008; Ghisi et al., 2010; Pietrefesa & Coles, 2009; Pitman, 1987; Sum­\nmerfeldt, 2004), and somatic urges for action (da Silva Prado et al., 2008; \nFerrao et al., 2012; Miguel et al., 2000). “Not just right” experiences \n(NJREs) reﬂect an inner feeling that something is wrong, uncertain, or not \nunder control, which must be corrected. “Incompleteness ” experiences are \nsimilar to NJREs, often reﬂecting an inner feeling that something is wrong \nand that one must perform a compulsion or ritual until achieving a sense \nof completion (Pietrefesa & Coles, 2009; Pitman, 1987). Premonitory \nurges in OCD come in many forms and resemble those from CTDs, \nhaving been described as aversive bodily sensations (e.g., tension) or \nenergy surges (da Silva Prado et al., 2008; Ferrao et al., 2012; Miguel et \nal., 2000; Rosario et al., 2009). These diﬀerent types of sensory and/or \nurge phenomena are often referred to interchangeably. Although NJREs \nare common among non-clinical, healthy individuals (Coles et al., 2003; \nGhisi et al., 2010) and are found in non-OCRD pathologies such as \nanxiety disorders (Fergus, 2014), most evidence suggests a strong rela­\ntionship between NJREs and OCD (Cervin et al., 2020; Coles et al., 2003; \nSica et al., 2015; Summers et al., 2014). Indeed, one study found that \nNJREs were the strongest feature diﬀerentiating youth with OCD from"

There is mixed data \nregarding the prevalence of NJREs and similar sensory phenomena in \nadult OCD patients (Ghisi et al., 2010; Leckman et al., 1994; Shavitt et \nal., 2014; Sibrava et al., 2016). However, some evidence suggests NJREs \nare more common in childhood OCD than adult-onset OCD (Ferrao et \nal., 2012). It is important to note that OCD patients are signiﬁcantly \nbothered by sensory-related obsessions and premonitory urges, as many \nreport greater distress and impairment from these experiences as com­\npared to cognitive obsessions and compulsive behaviors (da Silva Prado et \nal., 2008; Ferrao et al., 2012). \nChronic Tic Disorders (CTD) \nAs previously mentioned, premonitory urges are widely recognized as impor­\ntant contributors to CTDs. Evidence shows that most CTD patients (~90 \npercent) report some type of premonitory urge experience, however children \nreport urges less frequently (Leckman et al., 1993) and the prevalence of urges \nincreases with age (Sambrani et al., 2016) (discussed later in Chapter). The \nurge often occurs in the same body area as the tic it precedes, but they can be \nfelt as generalized across the whole body (Miguel et al., 1995). A signiﬁcant \nportion of persons with CTDs also report NJREs and feelings of incomple­\nteness, with estimates ranging between 30–90 percent (Leckman et al., 1994; \nMiguel et al., 2000; Neal & Cavanna, 2013). \nBody-Focused Repetitive Behaviors (BFRBs) \nTracing back to early behavior analytic studies in youth, BFRBs have \nlong been understood to be trigge red by sensory experiences and \nmaintained by sensory feedback (Miltenberger et al., 1998; Rapp et \nal., 1999; Williams et al., 2007). Sensory cues for hair pulling and \nskin picking include visual and tactile sensations, such as undesired \ncolors (e.g., coarse hairs, blemishes) or other aesthetic qualities (e.g., \nrough skin imperfections or “out of place ” hair) (Grant et al., 2007; \nMansueto et al., 1997; Snorrason et al., 2015; Snorrason et al., 2019; \nSnorrason et al., 2010; Wilhelm & Margraf, 1993). Additionally, a \nrecent study documented heightene d incompleteness experiences in \npersons with skin picking disorder (Ricketts et al., 2021). Upon \nsymptom completion, most individuals report experiencing a sense of \npleasure, gratiﬁcation, or relief (Bohne et al., 2005; Christenson et al., \n1991; Keuthen et al., 2000; Meunier et al., 2009; Tucker et al., 2011; \nWoods et al., 2006). Our understanding of premonitory urge phe­\nnomena in BFRBs is limited, particularly in children. However, case \nreports show that aﬀected youth experience urge phenomena (Pinto et \nal., 2017; Swedo & Rapoport, 1991), and the incidence of aﬀected \nyouth reporting urge phenomena appears to increase with age (Panza"

BDD typically onsets during \nearly adolescence (Phillips et al., 2005), coinciding with devel­\nopmentally appropriate increases in interest toward sexual attraction \nand body aesthetics. Urges to engage in appearance checking or mod­\niﬁcation have not been identiﬁed in BDD, but persons with BDD do \nexhibit visual abnormalities related to distortions of self-perception (Li \net al., 2013). BDD has also been associated with NJREs and feelings \nof incompleteness. A study by Summers and colleagues found that (a) \npersons with BDD experience more severe NJREs than healthy indivi­\nduals; (b) there is a positive correlation between severity of incomple­\nteness/NJREs and BDD symptoms; and (c) physiological reactivity in \nresponse to a task designed to elicit body concerns was positively cor­\nrelated with incompleteness severity (Summers et al., 2017). Further­\nmore, that research group found that individuals with BDD exhibit \ngreater discomfort than healthy controls when exposed to appearance-\nrelated (i.e., drawing of a man with crooked facial features) and non­\nappearance-related visual NJRE stimuli (i.e., a cluttered table). \nHealth Anxiety Disorder \nHealth anxiety disorder (HAD) is characterized by persistent preoccupa­\ntion with bodily sensations, which are deemed abnormal or pathogenic, \nand a resulting conviction that one has or might have a serious medical \nproblem. Very little research has been conducted on HAD in youth, but \nthe disorder certainly aﬀects persons across the lifespan (Wright & \nAsmundson, 2003). Urge phenomena have not been documented in HAD. \nHowever, studies have consistently linked HAD to excessive focus on and \nmisinterpretation of bodily sensations, with aﬀected persons experiencing \nnormal body sensations as more intense or more aversive than healthy \nindividuals (Barsky & Klerman, 1983). Theorists have speculated that the \nsomatic ampliﬁcation of body signals in BDD is due to misattribution (i. \ne., stomach tension being misinterpreted as pain), or cognitive biases \ntoward illness. However, there may also be some perceptual abnormality \nthat supports ampliﬁcation of body signals in HAD."

      "text": "Sensory Dysregulation in Obsessive-Compulsive-Related Disorders 83 \nAltered Sensation and Perception in OCRDs \nInteroception \nInteroception refers to the process by which one detects, integrates, and \ninterprets internal body sensations (Craig, 2002; Khalsa et al., 2018; Tsakiris \n& Critchley, 2016). Appropriate awareness of body sensations is critical for \nmaintaining homeostasis as well as selecting and executing adaptive beha­\nviors. Indeed, interoceptive dysfunction is thought to exert widespread nega­\ntive eﬀects on a variety of psychological processes such as attention, decision-\nmaking, and emotion (Craig, 2002). In children, abnormally increased car­\ndiac sensitivity has been linked to anxiety symptoms (Eley et al., 2004), while \ndecreased cardiac sensitivity has been linked to obesity and picky eating \n(Koch & Pollatos, 2014; Mata et al., 2015). Research has furthermore docu­\nmented a range of abnormal interoceptive processes across psychiatric \npopulations that overlap and co-occur with OCRDs, including autism spec­\ntrum disorder, attention-de ﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder, feeding and eating \ndisorders, and oppositional deﬁant disorder (Brewer et al., 2021; Gourley et \nal., 2013; Pollatos et al., 2008). \nIn OCRDs, a vast majority of research has been conducted in adults, but \ninteroceptive abnormalities have been reported consistently. Objective \ninvestigations using heartbeat detection tasks and similar methods have \nconsistently found reduced interoceptive accuracy across OCRDs (Barsky et \nal., 1995; Demartini et al., 2021; Ganos et al., 2015; Krautwurst et al., 2014; \nKrautwurst et al., 2016; Kunstman et al., 2016; Lazarov et al., 2014; Pile et \nal., 2018; Pratt, 2014; Rae et al., 2019; Schultchen et al., 2019; Tyrer et al., \n1980). Obsessive-compulsive traits in non-clinical populations have also \nbeen linked to reduced propensity to utilize interoceptive signals to gauge \narousal (Lazarov et al., 2010), suggesting OCRDs may be associated with \ndeﬁcient interoceptive accuracy and increased reliance on external proxies. \nIn contrast, research generally indicates that persons with OCRDs appraise \nbodily sensations as overly intense or threatening (Deacon & Abramowitz, \n2006; Eng et al., 2020), with self-report studies documenting perceived \nincreases in interoceptive sensitivity in OCD (Eng et al., 2020; Jokic´ & Puric´, \n2021), CTD (Eddy et al., 2014; Rae et al., 2019), BFRBs (Teng et al., 2002; \nWoods et al., 1996), BDD (Grunewald et al., 2023), and HAD (Krautwurst \net al., 2016). These ﬁndings suggest that certain, danger-related interoceptive \nsignals may be exaggerated in OCRDs, owing possibly to hyperarousal and/ \nor fear-related attentional bias. \nExteroception \nThe perception of environmental stimuli, or exteroception, has received \nless attention than interoception for its role in OCRDs and other child \npsychopathologies. Still, extant data generally indicate that some children"

However, there is \nat least one conﬂicting report showing no association between childhood \nsensory abnormalities and psychopathology (Van Hulle et al., 2012). \nSimilar to ﬁndings related to self-reported interoception, research has \nconsistently revealed self-reported increases in sensitivity to external sti­\nmuli in OCRDs including OCD (Ben-Sasson & Podoly, 2017; Cervin, \n2023; Dar et al., 2012; Lewin et al., 2015; Rieke & Anderson, 2009), \nCTDs (Cohen & Leckman, 1992; Isaacs et al., 2020; Ludlow & Wilkins, \n2016; Soler et al., 2019), BFRBs (Falkenstein et al., 2018; Houghton et \nal., 2018), and HAD (Barsky & Wyshak, 1990; Barsky et al., 1990). To \nmy knowledge, no study has examined external sensory sensitivity in \nBDD, but there is evidence of enhanced aesthetic sensitivity and atten­\ntion to detail (Kaplan et al., 2013; Madsen et al., 2013). There also \nappears to be a high degree of overlap between emergent conditions \ncharacterized by sensory intolerance (e.g., Misophonia, “Sensory Proces­\nsing Disorder ”) and OCRDs, as studies have documented elevated rates \nof OCRDs among samples of patients with sensory intolerance (Smith et \nal., 2022; Taylor et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014), including among child­\nhood samples (Van Hulle et al., 2019). Yet, investigations of external \nsensory sensitivity utilizing objective measurement tools largely mirror \nthose from investigations of interoceptive sensitivity. Several studies \nfound no evidence of abnormal sensory thresholds in OCRDs (Barsky et \nal., 1995; Belluscio et al., 2011; Güçlü et al., 2015; Haenen et al., 2010; \nPuts et al., 2015) or altered pain thresholds/tolerance (Blum et al., 2017; \nGrant et al., 2017; Lautenbacher et al., 1998). However, a minority of \nstudies have reported anomalous ﬁndings such as decreased tactile \ndetection thresholds in BFRBs (Houghton et al., 2019) and HAD (Rodic \net al., 2016), poor olfaction in OCD (Segalas et al., 2011) and CTD \n(Kronenbuerger et al., 2018), as well as increased physiologic reactivity \nand slow habituation to aversive external stimulation in OCD (Janik et \nal., 2018; Podoly et al., 2022). \nModels of sensory dysregulation in OCRDs \nCurrently available evidence shows that symptoms of OCRDs are fre­\nquently maintained by sensory phenomena such as premonitory urges, \nthat persons with OCRDs perceive themselves to be abnormally sensitive \nto interoceptive and exteroceptive signals, but that there is little evidence \nfor objective physiological sensory abnormalities.

However, there are several promising explanations for various \nsensory phenomena in OCRDs, which collectively point to disruptions in \nsensory processing and integration between top-down cognitive inﬂuences \nand bottom-up sensory aﬀerents. \nSensory Gating \nAlthough few studies have identiﬁ ed objective sensory abnormalities in \nOCRDs such as reduced detection thresholds or heightened interoceptive \nawareness, research has consistently identiﬁ ed one objective sensory deﬁcit \namong OCRDs. Sensory gating is an adaptive process in which some \nsensory information is selectively inhibited before reaching conscious \nawareness, which is believed to sharpen perception, conserve attentional \nresources, and enhance focus on relevant sensory information while miti­\ngating background noise. Indeed, the peripheral nervous system has an \nimmense sum of sensory receptors that are rarely, if ever, at complete rest, \nmeaning they are constantly conveying aﬀerent sensory messages to the \nbrain. The brain then must decipher information from torrents of aﬀerent \nsensory inputs that occur in complex temporal patterns. If some ﬁltering \nof sensory inputs did not occur, one would be overwhelmed with cascades \nof mostly irrelevant information, which would likely impede perception, \nattention, cognitive operations, and adaptive behavior. Furthermore, \nadaptive sensory gating appears to mature as children age (Davies et al., \n2009), suggesting that developmental adversities may hinder gating eﬃ­\nciency and increase risk for psychopathology. \nFaulty sensory gating has been closely tied to psychotic-spectrum dis­\norders (McGhie & Chapman, 1961; Patterson et al., 2008), attentional \ndisorders (Micoulaud-Franchi et al., 2019; Micoulaud-Franchi et al., \n2015), as well as “sensory processing disorders” (SPDs) (Davies et al., \n2009). SPDs are a purported childhood-onset disorder characterized by \nexcessive (or reduced) exteroceptive sensitivity (Houghton et al., 2020) \n(discussed below). Reduced gating has also been documented in OCRDs, \nincluding OCD (Hashimoto et al., 2008; Rossi et al., 2005; Xiao et al., \n2010), CTDs (Castellanos et al., 1996; Swerdlow et al., 2001; Zebardast \net al., 2013), BFRBs (Houghton et al., 2019), and BDD (Giannopoulos \net al., 2021; Kapsali et al., 2020). No research has yet linked sensory \ngating to HAD, but experts have posited a role for deﬁcient gating \namong persons with HAD and similar somatoform disorders (Boutros & \nPeters, 2012). Impaired sensory gating may contribute to symptoms of \nOCRDs by allowing excessive irrelevant sensory aﬀerent information to \nreach conscious awareness, which results in feelings of over-inundation (i. \ne., hypersensitivity) and diﬃculty habituating to stimulation. Over-\nstimulation does tend to elicit compensatory behaviors designed to"

Indeed, Jackson and colleagues \ndemonstrated that neural substrates of premonitory urges in CTDs align \nclosely with those of normal urges for action from our everyday lives (e.g., \nurge to yawn). The role of the insula in generating urges for action, as well \nas pathological urges to engage in compulsive behavior, was most clearly \ndemonstrated in a study that found insula lesions among nicotine addicts \nwere associated with a complete elimination of the urge to smoke (Naqvi \n& Bechara, 2009; Naqvi et al., 2007). Unfortunately, this neurobiological \naccount for premonitory urges fails to explain the development of pre­\nmonitory urges in OCRDs. \nBehavioral models of the development of premonitory urges are gen­\nerally based on the notion that tension reduction, or negative reinforce­\nment, maintains the urge-tic relationship. This is generally supported by \nreinforced tic suppression studies in which tic rate increases when urges \nare strong, urge strength increases during tic suppression, and urge \nstrength attenuates during free-to-tic conditions (Brandt et al., 2016; \nHoughton et al., 2014; Langelage et al., 2022). However, the negative \nreinforcement hypothesis does not account for the fact that premonitory \nurges are not always present when tics ﬁrst emerge in childhood (Sam­\nbrani et al., 2016; Woods et al., 2005). Tic typically onset around ages 6– \n7, whereas awareness of premonitory urges can emerge up to three years \nafter tic onset (Banaschewski et al., 2003; Leckman et al., 1993). Woods \nand colleagues proposed that urges may be present in young children with \nCTDs, but that younger children cannot reliably notice and describe the \nurge experience (Woods et al., 2005). This is supported by research \nshowing that interoceptive abilities typically do not fully develop until the \nages of 5.8–7.8 years (Sigmundsson et al., 2000). Indeed, recent ﬁndings \nsuggest that 80–95 percent of children with CTDs experience some degree \nof a premonitory urge experience (Openneer et al., 2020). Because sensory \nexperiences can be made conscious or more salient through learning \n(Cameron, 2001), perhaps the sequelae of tics (e.g., change in proprio­\nception, distraction, pain, teasing) provide the feedback necessary to \nincrease awareness toward private sensations that precede tics. Upon \nbecoming aware that some internal sensation exists prior to the tic, the \nurge then transitions from a benign experience with no functional sig­\nniﬁcance to one that is functionally linked to the tic and tic-related"

Finally, just as other \nbenign stimuli can acquire aversive valence when such stimuli predict a \nnegative outcome (Kamin et al., 1963; Rescorla & Solomon, 1967), the \nurge then acquires an aversive valence, and escape from the urge becomes \nreinforcing. This conceptualization is supported by studies showing that \npremonitory urges are associated with neural activation of regions \ninvolved in negative aﬀect and punishment-based learning (Wang et al., \n2011), as well as data showing that urge severity is associated with indices \nof functional and social impairment (Woods et al., 2005) and peer victi­\nmization (Zinner et al., 2012). \nTaken together, premonitory urges for compulsive behaviors may be \nuniversally present as signals of impending action, but as compulsive \nbehavior symptoms become intrusive and individuals attempt to predict \nand suppress such actions, urges acquire aversive valence and become \nfunctionally tied to symptoms. Premonitory urges can thus be considered \n“normal ”, in that they mirror common urges for action, but only because \nthey signal the emergence of undesired symptoms do they acquire aversive \nvalence. In the next section, the process through which benign inter­\noceptive signals can intensify and become aversive is discussed. \nThe “alliesthesia” and somatosensory ampliﬁcation models \nSome have suggested that abnormal sensory experiences in OCRDs could \nbe caused by a pathogenic integration between higher-order cognitive \nprocesses and lower-order perceptual aﬀerents (Paulus & Stein, 2010). \nSpeciﬁcally, Paulus and Stein argued that fear-based disorders (e.g., anxi­\nety, OCD, BDD, HAD) are characterized by negatively biased internal \ncognitive models that facilitate hypervigilance to potential threats (Stein & \nNesse, 2011), translating to hyper-attention toward sensory stimuli that \nmay signal danger. Similarly, persistent hypervigilance to threat appears \nto be tied to evolutionary processes related to early threat detection and \nprecautionary responses. By means of a process known as alliesthesia \n(Cabanac, 1971), the internal condition of an individual is intertwined \nwith external stimuli that impact the internal environment, causing stimuli \nto acquire an emotional signiﬁcance based on their perceived pleasantness \nor unpleasantness. The central and peripheral nervous systems of the \nbody continuously transmit a stream of noisy and unclear sensory inputs \nthat require integration and interpretation. Individuals who are vigilant \nfor threats tend to perceive stimuli with negative emotional impact as \nmore intense, as these stimuli could potentially indicate danger. Coupled \nwith faulty sensory gating and an increase in the amount of irrelevant \ninformation reaching conscious awareness, aﬀected persons may con­\nstantly struggle to interpret the threat relevance of various ambiguous \nsuprathreshold stimuli. Consequently, ambiguous stimuli have the poten­\ntial to trigger anxious catastrophizing, whereby a seemingly harmless"

Indeed, arguments have been made \nfor the role of alliesthesia, threat prediction, and reward anticipation in \nsimilar compulsive behavior disorders, drug addiction. Paulus and Stew­\nart (Paulus & Stewart, 2014) argued that persons with substance use \ndisorders encounter an “embodied ” experience, similar to craving, that is \nsubserved by frequent errors between their predicted versus actual body \nstate (e.g., “elated ” versus “tense”). Furthermore, an innovative study \nutilizing a bayesian computational model of neurophysiological data \nfrom individuals with various psychopathologies (i.e., anxiety, depression, \nsubstance use disorders, and eating disorders) found increased inter­\noceptive error rates across all pathologies as compared to controls during \ninteroceptive challenge (a combined breath-holding and heartbeat-count­\ning task) (Smith et al., 2020). It could therefore be that compulsive tics \nand BFRBs are associated with a similar interoceptive reward-prediction \nerror, speciﬁcally related to proprioceptive, visceral, and dermatological \nsensations. \nUnfortunately, the models proposed by Paulus and colleagues have been \nconcerned with interoception and do not deliver an account of exter­\noceptive hypersensitivity. Yet, from the perspective of health anxiety and \nsimilar unexplained medical symptom disorders (i.e., conversion disorder, \nsomatization disorders, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures), experts have \nexplored how the intensity of both internal and external sensory experi­\nences can be ampliﬁed, even in the absence of objective diﬀerences in \nsensory thresholds (Barsky & Wyshak, 1990; Köteles & Witthöft, 2017). \nSomatosensory ampliﬁcation refers to the notion that a combination of \nbody hypervigilance and strong emotional reactivity to sensation can \nresult in the intensi ﬁcation of certain sensory experiences. This concept \nshares many similarities with other models of medically unexplained \nsymptoms such as central sensitization in chronic pain. Because external \nstimuli can aﬀect the internal milieu, it stands to reason that certain \nenvironmental exposures (i.e., a strange smell) can trigger health worries \nand undergo ampliﬁcation. This has important theoretical implications for \nemerging conditions that overlap with OCRDs, namely SPDs and “idio­\npathic environmental intolerances ” (IEI). As has been discussed in other \nreviews (Houghton et al., 2020), children with sensory processing disorders \nalmost universally express elevated symptoms of OCRDs and anxiety, \nthus suggesting that environmental hypersensitivity in sensory processing \ndisorders could result from top-down ampliﬁcation of sensory inputs. \nLikewise, controversial conditions characterized by IEI such as mis­\nophonia (selective sound sensitivity), multiple chemical (olfactory)"

Sup­\nport for this notion comes from data indicating that top-down belief sys­\ntems signiﬁcantly inﬂuence IEI symptom expression. For example, in \npersons with purported electromagnetic sensitivity, their actual exposure to \nelectromagnetism does not inﬂuence symptom severity (Rubin et al., \n2010), but perceived electromagnetism exposure does inﬂuence symptoms \n(Szemerszky et al., 2015; Witthöft & Rubin, 2013) \nIssues for further investigation \nThis chapter has provided evidence for premonitory urge phenomena as \nwell as subjective increases in sensitivity to interoceptive and exteroceptive \nstimuli. I also discussed several preliminary models for sensory dysregula­\ntion in OCRDs. Yet, this area of research is still early stages, with many \nunanswered questions and untested assumptions. The following sections \nwill detail several important avenues for further research. \nSensory processing disorders? \nAs discussed previously and in other reports (Houghton et al., 2020), \nresearchers and clinicians have increasingly argued for the existence of \nSPDs. These conditions are not recognized by DSM-5 and ICD-11, and it \nis presently unclear whether these conditions represent valid diagnoses or \nare best conceptualized as symptom clusters that often co-occur with \nanxiety-related pathologies and autistic traits. For instance, many children \nexhibit select hypersensitivities and strong responses to certain stimuli (e. \ng., food textures, smells, clothing material), which do not necessarily \nimpair functioning and may vanish with age. However, there is some evi­\ndence that children with SPDs have objective sensory abnormalities (Bar-\nShalita et al., 2009; McIntosh et al., 1999; Schaaf et al., 2003), potentially \nsupporting the validity of SPD as a unique pathology. However, other \nresearch points to symptoms of SPDs in children as representing early risk \nfactors for anxiety disorders and related pathologies (Carpenter et al., \n2019). For example, a longitudinal twin study in 1,613 children found that \nthe number of tactile or auditory sensory over-responsivity symptoms was \npositively correlated with likelihood of OCD diagnoses (Van Hulle et al., \n2019). \nIn order to signiﬁcantly advance research on SPDs and their relation­\nships with OCRDs, future studies ought to take certain steps to maximize \nimpact and interpretability. First, it is crucial that scientists establish \nconsensus in deﬁning the core constructs of sensory psychopathology. \nOnce clear deﬁnitions of pathological sensory constructs (e.g., “sensory \nover-responsivity ”) and the diagnostic validity of sensory processing dis­\norders have been established, researchers can develop psychometrically"

Relatedly, future studies ought to utilize both \nsubjective and objective assessment methods and clearly diﬀerentiate \nbetween the two processes. Objective measures of sensory function some­\ntimes align with self-reported perception (Bar-Shalita et al., 2009), but \nthis is not always the case (Kozak & Miller, 1982). Careful attention to \nboth components of the large sensory processes apparatus should enable \nmore precise conclusions regarding the interplay between conscious feel­\ning states, beliefs, physiological responses to stimulation, and behavior. \nFinally, the neurophysiological deﬁcits that purportedly underlie SPDs may \ninteract signiﬁcantly with various environmental factors and comorbidities, \nsuch as physical health (e.g., nutrition), neuroendocrine/hormonal processes, \nmotor development, and cognitive and social experiences (i.e., exposure to \ndiverse, highly stimulating environments). \nTreatment \nWhile sensory dysregulation has garnered attention as a potential OCRD \nmechanism, there is little empirical guidance on eﬀective treatments, and \nthe limited but existing evidence suggests the need for further reﬁnement \nof existing treatments. There are behavioral treatment strategies aimed at \nchildren with purported sensory processing disorders, such as “sensory \nintegration therapy ”. Unfortunately, sensory integration therapy has not \nundergone rigorous clinical trials, and existing evidence points to ques­\ntionable eﬃcacy (Complementary et al., 2012). Cognitive-behavioral \ntherapies for OCRDs, which boast considerable empirical support, have \nbeen investigated regarding eﬀects on patients who exhibit sensory dysre­\ngulation. A meta-analysis of CBT for incompleteness symptoms in OCD \nfound that incompleteness was modestly improved over the course of \ntreatment, with stronger eﬀect sizes noted for treatments that explicitly \ntargeted incompleteness (Schwartz, 2018). In contrast, other studies have \nshown that NJREs and incompleteness symptoms are associated with \npoor OCD treatment outcomes (Cervin & Perrin, 2021; Nissen & Parner, \n2018). Given these data, there is a clear need to further investigate the \neﬃcacy of CBT-based interventions for sensory components of OCRDs. \nThere is perhaps room for innovative new treatment methodologies \nthat are agnostic to diagnosis but instead aim directly at sensory dysre­\ngulation. One example of such an approach is known as Flotation-REST \n(Reduced Environmental Stimulation Therapy), which involves using \nsensory deprivation in a saltwater ﬂoatation chamber to encourage \nmindfulness meditation and relaxation. Early data point to robust \nanxiolytic eﬀects of Flotation-REST (Feinstein et al., 2018), as well as \nimprovements in interoceptive awareness (Feinstein et al., 2018) and \ndecreased functional connectivity within somatomotor and default mode \nnetworks (Al Zoubi et al., 2021). Other potential treatment avenues \ninclude non-invasive neuromodulation, particularly targeting the insula"

However, preliminary investigation of insular \nneuromodulation via transcranial magnetic stimuli showed treatment-\nrelated decreases in interoceptive accuracy but increases in perceptual \nconﬁdence (Pollatos et al., 2016). It is currently unclear how such treat­\nment eﬀects would translate into OCRD patients and whether approa­\nches that are suitable for adults would exhibit similar eﬃcacy in youth. \nSummary \nResearch reviewed in the current chapter demonstrates that symptoms of \nmany OCRDs are instigated by sensory phenomena, aﬀected individuals \nexhibit subjective sensory abnormalities, but that sensory abnormalities \nare not necessarily caused by objective sensory deﬁcits. However, there is \nevidence for more subtle sensory gating abnormalities and disrupted sen­\nsory integration processes in OCRDs. Taken together, this evidence shows \nthat sensory dysregulation is a potentially important component of OCRD \npsychopathology. It is therefore unsurprising that research in this area is \ngrowing at a rapid pace, and hopefully we will receive signiﬁcant new \ninsights that will help develop a more comprehensive understanding of \nhow sensory dysregulation interacts with other risk factors and etiological \nmechanisms. Within these eﬀorts, there is a clear need for additional \nresearch on targeted and innovative treatment approaches for sensory \naspects of OCRDs. Such research would signiﬁcantly advance our ability \nto provide comprehensive care for individuals with OCRDs and may also \nhave signiﬁcant implications for conditions similar to OCRDs that also \nexhibit similar sensory abnormalities (Khalsa et al., 2018). \nReferences \nAl Zoubi, O., Misaki, M., Bodurka, J., Kuplicki, R., Wohlrab, C., Schoenhals, W . \nA., Refai, H.
