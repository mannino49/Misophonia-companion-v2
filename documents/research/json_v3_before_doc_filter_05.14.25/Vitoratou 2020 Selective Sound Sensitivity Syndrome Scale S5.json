      "text": "Introduction  \nMisophonia is a condition characterised by a  decreased tolerance to specific stimuli, resulting in an \nintense  physiological and affective  response (Jatreboff & Jatreboff , 2001; Schröder  et al. , 2013; \nEdelstein, Brang  et al. , 2013). Stimuli typically include repetitive sounds produced by humans  (Jager, \nde Koning et al, 2020) , but individuals also report decreased tolerance to environmental  and \nmechanical sounds  (Edelstein et al 2013; Hansen et al, under review) , as well as hypersensitivity to \nvisual , tactile  and olfactory stimuli  (Wu, Lewin et al 2014) . Individuals with misophonia report impair ed \nfunctioning  in work, study,  leisure and relationships (Edelstein et al., 2013;  Jastreboff & Jastreboff, \n2002; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018 ; Schröder  et al., 2013; Wu, Lewin, Murphy, & Storch, 2014).  \nIndividuals with misophonia have describ ed experiencing sounds as invasive, offensive and  insulting . \nQualitative data has identified appraisals directed at the source of the sound, such as rudeness or \nthoughtlessness , feelings of shame and embarrassment at the ir own react ion to sounds  and a sense \nof failure and sadness about the i mpact of the condition on their lives (Edelstein et al 2013; Rouw and \nErfanian, 2018 ). Perceived loss of control (Jager et al 2020)  and a fear of physical outbursts (Reid, \nGuzick et al ., 2016) have also been r eported . Further research is warranted to explore the frequency \nof these appraisals and whether they are associated with misophonia severity and behavioural \nresponse.  Improved understanding of appraisals may shed light on the relevance of context to the \nmisophonic response, for example a more intense reaction towards close family members or the \nabsence of a response to sounds when made by animals or children (Edel stein  et al 2013; Jager et al \n2020) . \nCoping strategies for misophonia include avoidance and leaving situations, blocking sounds with music \nor earplugs, anticipating sounds, and verbal aggression ( Edelstein et al 2013; Jager et al 2020 ; Rouw  \nand Erfanian 2017 ). Jager et al (2020) reported that aggressive outbursts were mild relative to the \naggressive nature of thoughts experienced during a misophonic reaction. Two studies (Wu et al 2014; \nZhou, Wu et al 2017)  found that the positive correlatio n between anger outbursts and misophonia \nseverity was significantly mediated by anxiety , with outbursts  measured by the Rage Outbursts and \nAnger Rating Scale ( ROARS), which is not specific to the context of misophonia. Misophonic subjects \nhave been found to have higher self -reported anxiety sensitivity ( McKay, Kim et al 2018)  and higher \nawareness of internal body states (Kumar et al 2017) than non -misophonic controls . Further research \nis needed to build on these finding s and to establish whether trea tments targeting interoceptive and \nanxiety sensitivity could reduce outbursts in misophonia. Such research would benefit from a measure \nof outbursts specific to misophonia.  \nJastreboff and Jastreboff (200 2) proposed that the misophonic response is the result of heightened \nconnectivity between the auditory, limbic and autonomic systems.  Edelstein et al. (2013) us ed skin \nconductance response (SCR)  to measure  sympathetic nervous system activation whilst listening to \nmisophoni c “trigger” sounds. They found a positive correlation between subjective aversiveness and \nSCR in both the misophonic and control  groups. The two groups were similar in their reports of which \nsounds they found avers ive and non -aversive, with a heightened subjective aversion rating and SCR in \nthe misophonia group.  Kumar et al (2017)  also found a heightened physiological response in a \nmiso phonic  group compared to controls, as measured using heart rate and galvanic skin response \n(GSR). In a mediation analysis, t hey found that the relation  between group status (i.e. misophonia or \ncontrol) and physiological response t o trigger sounds was mediated by  brain activity in the anterior \ninsula cortex (AIC) , an area of the brain that is key in the processing the salience of internal bodily \nstates ( interocepti on). This study, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), found that the \nheightened AIC ac tivity was present with misophonic sounds (e.g. eating) but not “unpleasant sounds ” \n(e.g. person screaming). They also found increased functional connectivity between the AIC and core"

This connectivity may provide a brain basis representation of the \nsubjective reports of the relevance of context in response to  sounds  (Edelstein et al 2013; Jager et al \n2020) . Vivid memories of childhood misophonic episodes have been reported (Rouw and Erfanian, \n2018 ) and further research is warranted to explore whether memories could be targeted using \nimagery rescripting (ImRs) as a means of reducing the misophonic response , as is increasingly used as \na therapeutic technique in anxiety and obsessive compulsive and related disorders (Arntz, 2012).  The \nresults of t hese neurophysiological studies were in line with a subsequent imagi ng study (Schroeder , \nvan Wingen et al, 2019) , which also reported a subjective increase in the emotions of anger, disgust \nand sadness in response to misophonic sounds  by misophonic participants compared with controls.  \nTaken together, these studies indicated that the subjective emotional response and higher \nphysiological response to misophonic triggers could in part be the result of the meaning applied to \ntrigger sounds  and to interoceptive experiences in re sponse to sounds.  An appropriate measure of the \n“meaning” behind sounds and the misophonic response would be useful for future research . \nThere is no formally agreed categorisation nor diagnostic criteria for misophoni a. A recent literature \nreview highlighted the challenge of effectively categorising this phenomenon (Brout et al 2018). \nHypersensitivity to auditory stimuli occurs in numerous disorders within multiple disciplines  including \ntinnitus, hyperacusis ( Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2001; 2002), autism spectrum disorder, sensory \nprocessing disorders (Tavassoli, et al., 2017), and post -traumatic stress disorder (Morgan & Grillon, \n1999). Misophonia has been found to co-occur with obsessive -compulsive personality  disorder \n(Schröder  et al., 2013; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018), obsessive -compulsive disorder ( Schröder  et al., 2013; \nEdelstein et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014), mood disorders, anxiety disorders (Wu et al., 2014; Rouw & \nErfanian, 2018), post -traumatic stress diso rder, attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder (Rouw & \nErfanian, 2018), and eating disorders (Kluckow, Telfer, & Abraham, 2014; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018) , \nraising the question as to whether this is a transdiagnostic phenomenon  or a stand -alone condition .  \nSchröder  et al. (2013) suggested that misophonia be categorised as a discrete psychiatric condition  \nand proposed diagnostic criteria, which were recently revised by the research team  following an \nobservational study of 779 subjects with suspected misophonia  (Jager et al 2020) . Considering that \nthese criteria were developed from observations of individuals referred to a psychiatric  outpatient \nclinic , it is likely premature to adopt the psychiatric categorisation until similar studies have been \ncompleted in other settings where individuals may present with misophonia, e.g. audiology clinics or \neducational settings , and repeated on samples representative of the general population . Robust \npsychometric measures of misophonia are needed for use in large scale studies and to identify suitable \nparticipants for structured clinical interview to support the categorisation of misophonia.  \nThe recent rapid increase in misophonia research has highlighted the impor tance of a robust \nmultidimensional scale for measuring misophonia.  A number of questionnaires have been developed \nfor use in misophonia research, though none of these have been subjected to rigorous psychometric \nanalysis  using up to date scientific approac hes. The two used most frequently in the misophonia \nliterature are the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014 ) and the Amsterdam Misophonia \nScale (A -MISO -S; Schr öder et al, 2013 ), which  are intended to  measure the presence and severity of \nmisophonia symptoms.  Additional questionnaires in use include the recently published MisoQuest \n(Siepsiak et al., 2020), the Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ; Johnson, 2014) and two \nsingle item scales, The Misophonia Activation Scale (MAS -1; Fitzmau rice, 2010)  and the  Misophonia \nPhysical Response Scale (MPRS; Bauman, 2015) . A recent scoping review (Potgieter , MacDonald et al, \n2019) identified other questionnaires for which there was no information available about the scale"

The MQ Total score (Chronbach’s alpha = .89) \nis calculated by combining the first two sections of the questionnaire, the 7-item Misophonia \nSymptom Scale (MSS;  = 0.86), assess ing the presence of specific triggers , and the 10-item \nMisophonia Emotions and Behaviours Scale (MEBS;  = 0.86) . Items are rated on a five -point ordinal \nscale, ranging from 0  (Not at all True / Never ) to 4 ( Always True / Always ), with a total score of 0-68. \nExploratory factor analysis identified a three -factor solution, with factors one and two made up of the \nMSS and MEBS items, respectively , and the third factor consisting of  items cross -loading on the first \ntwo factors.  The third section  of the MQ , the Misophonia Severity Scale, was adapted for misophonia \nfrom the NIMH Global Obsessive -Compulsive Scale (NIMH GOCS; Murphy, Pickar & Alterman, 1982; \nWu et al., 2014) . It is a single item rating the severity of sound sensitivity on a scale from 1  (minim al) \nto 15  (Very severe sound sensitivities), with a score greater than or equal to 7 indicating clinically \nsignificant symptoms. The initial psychometric assessment found satisfactory internal consistency and \nappropriate convergent and discriminant validit y (Wu et al., 2014). Satisfactory internal consistency \nfor the MQ was also found in a study  of 415 students from two universities in China  (Zhou, Wu, & \nStorch, 2017).  The authors acknowledge that further psychometric testing would be required for use \nin ot her populations (Wu et al, 2014).  In a clinical setting, the MSS in particular may be limited in its \ncapacity to capture meaningful chang e. The section asks  “In comparison to other people, I am sensitive \nto the sound of…” before listing the 7 trigger sound s. A respondent whose sound sensitivity had \nreduced , but remained above average , may still consider it to be “always true” that they are sensitive \nin comparison to other people , and thus the clinical improvement in symptoms may not be captured \nby these items . \nThe A-MISO -S (Schröder et al, 2013) was adapted from the Yale-Brown Obsessive  Compulsive Scale  \n(YBOCS) , an established clinician -rated tool for measuring severity of OCD symptoms . The A -MISO -S \nhas 6 questions which address different aspect of misophonia, including time spent occupied by \nmisophonia,  impact on functioning, distress, attempts to resist , perceived control over sounds and \nthoughts, and avoidance. The questions are discussed with the patient and the interviewer uses \nclinical judgemen t to rate each item from 0 to 4 , with a total possible score of 24. Schr öder et  al (2013) \nused the A -MISO -S as a clinician -rated  tool, but it has also been used as a self -report tool in some \nresearch ( Ci Quek, Ho et al, 2018) , To our knowledge, the psychometric properties of the A -MISO -S \nhave not been published.  \nA recently published questionnaire, MisoQuest (Siepsiak et al., 2020), was developed based on the \nproposed diagnostic criteria outlined by Schröder et al. (2013). The initial pool of 60 items was used \nfor the first sample (N = 383) which was reduced to 21 items for the second sample ( N = 315). \nExploratory Factor Analysis found the best fit was a single factor  and g raded response IRT models \nstudied the discrimination ability of the items . The final version of MisoQuest contained 14 items and \nshowed good internal consistency , test -retest reliability and preliminary confirmation of criterion -\nrelated validity.  The tool is intended to screen for the presence  of misophonia rather than as a \nmeasure of symptom severity.  As it is based on the Schröder (2013) diagnostic criteria, it is a reliable \nand valid tool for circumstances where those criteria are being used. The authors acknowledge that \nthis means it may no t effectively screen those who do not have anger as their immediate and core \nemotional reaction  (for example, those who primarily experience disgust or feelings of panic ). \nThe MAQ ( Johnson, 2014)  is a 63-items  questionnaire  with a 4-point scale,  ranging  from 0 (not at all ) \nto 3 (almost all of the time ). Questions focus on the emotional, social and functional impact of sound"

The MAS -1 (Fitzmaurice, 2010) and the MPRS (Bauman, 2015) are both single item tools rating \nmisophonia severity and intensity of physical reactions, respectively, from 0 to 10. Rouw and Erfanian \n(2018) found level 9 to be the most common reported rating on  the MAS -1, a score that indicates \nextreme panic or rage with a conscious decision not to use violence, and level 8 on the MPRS, denoting \na physical sensation equating to emotional pain. The psychometric properties for the MAQ, MAS -1 \nand the MPRS have not been published.  \nMisoQuest Siepsiak et al, 2020) is the only published misophonia questionnaire to have been through \nrigorous psychometric testing . It is appropriate for use as a screening tool where the Schröder (2013) \ndiagnostic are being applied. The two  most used  measures for misophonia severity have not been \nsubject to sufficient psychometric testing to be routinely used in research.  \nWith misophonia research on the rise, it is vital to have a multidi mensional, psychometrically sound \ntool for measuring the condition  in both research and clinical settings . The aim of the present study \nwas to develop  a robust psychometric scale  for misophonia , the Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrom e \nScale (S -Five) . This study  examines whether the emotions , behaviours , experiences  and appraisals of \nindividuals with misophonia  are reliable and valid manifestations  of the condition . A scale that \neffectively measures misophonia will allow for vast improvements in the capacity to report on the \ncondition methodolo gically, to test hypotheses of differences between groups, and to examine \ncorrelations with other traits and co -occurring diagnoses . It will also serve as a clinical tool, assessing \nthe severity for individual s and measuring progress of the misophonic expe rience  over time  and in \nresponse to intervention . The S -Five uses a reflective latent variable model, where each question is an \nindicator of the assumed underlying misophonia, in a consistent, methodological manner.  \nMethods  \nSampling  \nThree waves of data collection  were conducted between January 2019 and March 2020. At each wa ve \nwe turned to the community of people identifying as having Misophonia and asked for their help to \ndevelop the S -Five. We posted to closed Misophonia Facebook groups (specifica lly UK Misophonia \nSupport Group, Misophonia: Coping and Solutions, Misophonia Support Group for Adults only, \nMisophonia Support Group, Misophonia Treatment Tracker, Misophonia International Support Group, \nMisophonia: Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome (4 S), Misophonia & Misokinesia Support Group, \nMisophonia Treatment and Management,  Misophonia Support Group Australia, Misophonia Research \nNetwork, Misophonia -Research -Keeping up ) and Reddit group  (namely r/misophonia ). We also posted \nto KCL-related and the researchers’ personal social media to recruit individuals who do not necessarily \nidentify or are aware of misophonia.  At the final , third wave , we used the Prolific .com site to recruit \n800 individuals , representative of the UK general population.  Inclusio n criteria included being 18+ \nyears old and fluent in English and exclusion criteria included diagnosis of severe intellectual/learning \ndisability.  \nPsychometric analyses   \nAt the first stage of the psychometric evaluation pilot data were analysed to trace p roblematic items \nin terms of face validity, test -retest reliability and internal consistency. When required, certain items \nwere rephrased, or omitted. New items were also added under the consultation of the clinical \npsychologist who joined the team (JG).  \nDuring the second wave of sampling, trigger endorsement  was studied using  the two parametric \nlogistic item response theory model ( 2PL-IRT; Baker , 2001 ) to evaluate the properties of the trigger \nendorsement.  That is, we estimated each trigger’s difficulty, discrimination ability and information."

The general population and the misophonia specific \nsamples were randomly divided in two split halves, one to be used in EFA and one in CFA  when both \nmethods were used .  \nFull reliability and validity assessment were conducted within each (potential) dimension and for the \ntotal scale. With respect to reliability, internal consistency was evaluated using classical test theory \nmethods (alpha, alpha if item deleted, item total  correlations, item rest correlations). Convergent \nconcurrent validity was tested using the Misophonia Questionnaire and the Amsterdam Misophonia \nScale.  \nResults  \nData collection waves and S-Five versions  \nThe initial pool of items used to construct the S -five is presented in Vitoratou et  al.

The triggers  version included 36 sounds \nwhose effect on the individual with misophonia was measured  on a 6-point ordinal  scale. The first \nwave  of data collection (January -March 2019) resulted in a misophoni a specific sample of 853 \nindividuals.  Based on the preliminary analyses from the first wave data,  participants’ feedback  (see \nsummary Table A1 and A2 in Appendix)  and experts ’ advice  (JG), 32 item s were rephrased,  and 71 \nstatements and  12 trigger sounds were added  in both triggers and statement sections .   \nThe second  wave  of data collection (June -November 2019) resulted to  202 responses from the \ngeneral population and 613 responses of people identifying as having misophonia  (hereafter referred \nto as misophonia sample ). Full psychometric assessment was conducted in the misophonia sample. \nWith respect to the triggers section, Item Response Theory (IRT) models were used to estimate the \nseverity ( difficulty) and the ability of each trigger to discriminate between people with higher or lower \nmisophonic complaint. The information (reliability) of each trigger was also estimated along with the \ninformation provided  by the entire section. Test -retest re liability estimations concluded that all trigger \nitems are stable in time. With respect to the statements’ section, exploratory factor analysis revealed \nthat there is a five-factor  structure , with strong internal consistency within each factor. Items were \nthen removed based on the strength of their association with their assigned factor. Items  which \nloaded less than 0.5 with their factor were omitted. Items that cross -loaded in two or more factors \n(secondary loading(s) at least 0.3 ) were omitted. Items that  did not have strong loadings to any of the \nfactors were omitted. Items which correlated to high (higher than 0.8) with other items were also \ncommitted. Reliability analysis indicated that statements  were stable in time (two weeks test -retest). \nBased on these analyses , 63 items were omitted . Results were replicated  in the general populations \nsample. Furthermore, based on the feedback of the responders and expert opinion on the factors,  13 \nitems were added,  and 18 items were rephrased , giving a total of 68  items in the statement section  of \nthe questionnaire . In the trigger version, 6 items were rephrased, 3 items were added, a nd 1 item was \nomitted, which g ave a total of 37  trigger  items .  \nThose changes were incorporated to the third wave  of data collection (January -March 2020) .

Information about familial experience of misophonia, the developmental history of the \nparticipants’ misophonia , and its impact on impaired functioning measured by the Work and Social \nAdjustment Scale (WSAS;  Mundt e t al., 2002)  were also  collected  for those identify  as having \nMisophonia (Appendix 1.C).  \nThe S -Five items followed ( trigger section  presented in Appendix 2.E.i and  statement section  \npresented in Appendix 2.E.ii).  \nAt the end of the survey, the Patient Heal th Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9; Kroenke et al., 2001 ), General \nAnxiety Disorder -7 questionnaire (GAD -7; Spitzer et al., 2006 ), and Bryant and Smith Aggression \nQuestionnaire (AQ ; Bryant & Smith, 2001 ) were administered.  The first two scales are standardised \nscreening tools and symptom severity me asures for depression and anxiety disorders, respectively. \nBS-AQ is a shorter 12 -item version of the original 29-item Aggression Questionnaire (Buss & Perry, \n1992) , which measure s aggression on four dimensions: physical aggression, verbal aggression, \nhostility, and anger. This completes the obligatory part of the survey.  \nParticipants were then asked whether they want to participate in a retest study in two weeks' time . \nSubsequently, i n the misophonia population sampling, participants were given an option to either \ncomplete more questionnaires or finish the survey. Those who decided to continue were randomly \npresented with  twelve additional questionnaires . An estimation o f the time required to complete each \nquestionnaire was given beforehand and  people were informed that they can stop the survey at any \npoint and all the data they had given thus far will be included in the study.

      "text": "collection, par ticipants were randomly assigned to one of two blocks of q uestionnaires , each \nconsisting by  6 measures.  The twelve measures are listed below.  \n1. The Beliefs about Emotions Scale  (BES; Rimes & Chalder, 2010 ) is a 12 -item questionnaire on  \nbeliefs  regarding the inability to accept negative emotions , and the adverse consequences of \nexperiencing and expressing those emotions.  Items are rated on a 7 -point Likert scale , \nspecifying level of agreement or disagreement.  \n2. The Mindful  Attention Awareness Sca le (MAAS ; Brown & Ryan, 2003 ) assesses a receptive \nstate of mind, which is a core feature of mindfulness.  MAAS contains 15 items measured on a \n6-point  ordinal scale  ranging from ‘almost always’ to ‘almost never’.  \n3. The Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response  (ASMR -15; Roberts et al., 2019 ) is a \nquestionnaire  assessing altered state of consciousness phenomena, namely autonomous \nsensory meridian response (ASMR) , which is ch aracterised by pleasurable tingling sensation \nin response to certain audio -visual stimuli , causing relaxation and euphoria. The 15 -item scale  \nis rated on a scale from 1, ‘completely untrue for me’ to 5, ‘completely true for me’ , and \nconsists of four subscales: a ltered consciousness, sensation, relaxation and affect.  \n4. The reduced -item  Disgust Propensity and Sensitivity Scale -Revised  (DPSS -R; Fergus & \nValentiner, 2009 ) consists of 12 items  on a 5 -point response scale  that assess  how easily one \nis disgusted, known as disgust propensity, and how bother ed a person is by their disgust , \nwhich is described as disgust sensitivity , both of which contribute to disgust reactions.  \n5. The Anxiety Sensitivity Index  (ASI-3; Taylor et al., 2007 ) is a shorter 18-item version of the \noriginal Anxiety Sensitivity  Index ( Peterson & Reiss, 1992 ). It assesses anxiety sensitivity  \nconceptualised as  one’s considerations regarding misinterpretations of anxiety -related \nsensations. The scale mea sures anxiety sensitivity on  physical, cognitive, and social \ndimensions.  \n6. The Adult Eating Behaviour Questionnaire  (AEBQ; Hunot et al., 2016 ) is a 35 -item measure \nthat assesses appetitive traits in adulthood.  AEBQ consists of 8 subscales; however, for the \npurpose of this study only ‘food fussiness’ subscale was implemented, which consists of 5 \nitems measured on a 5 -point Likert scale ranging fr om ‘strongly disagree’ to ‘strongly agree’.  \n7. The Temperament Evalua tion of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San  Diego  - autoquestionnaire  \n(TEMPS -A; Akiskal et al., 2005 ) measures temperamental variations based on diagnostic \nclassifications for affective temperaments, namely cyclothymic, dysthymic, irritable, \nhyperthymic, and anxious , and has five subscales named as such . The scale is a yes -or-no type \nquestionnaire and consists of 39 items . \n8. The Big Five Inventory  (BFI; John & Srivastava, 1999 ) is a 44 -item questionnaire  with a 5 -point \nLikert agreement scale , which measures one’s personality  on the Big Five  Factors of \npersonality : extraversion vs introversion, agreeableness vs antagonism, conscientiousness vs \nlack of direction, neuroticism vs emotional stability, openness  vs closedness to experience . \nThose factors  are further separated  into personality dimensions.  \n9. The Leahy Emotional Schema Scale II  (LESS II ; Leahy, 2012 ) is a 28-item measure with a 6 -\npoint ordinal response scale  that determines beliefs and attributions about emotions . The \nscale is divided into fourteen dimensions: invalidation, incomprehensibility, guilt, simplistic \nview of emotion, devalued, loss of control,  numbness, overly rational, duration, low \nconsensus, non-acceptance of feelings, rumination, low expression, and blame.  \n10. The Body Consciousness Questionnaire  (BCQ; Miller et al., 1981 ) contains 15 items with a 5 -\npoint Likert scale  and assesses inner bodily awareness, which is subdivided into three \nsubscales, namely private body, public body, and body competence."

      "text": "11. The Misophonia Questionnaire  (MQ; Wu et al., 2014)  is a 34-item scale consisting of 3 \nsections that assesses misophonia regarding  the presence of specific trigger s, emotional and \nbehavioural responses and its severity. The first two sections, Misophonia Symptom Scale and \nMisophonia Emotions and Behaviours scale,  are rated on a 5 -point ordinal scale , whilst the \nthird section,  Misophonia Severity Scale, measures one’s severity of sound sensitivity on a 1 \nto 15 -point scale with 1 suggesting minimal sound sensitivity and 15 indicating very severe \nsensitivity.  \n12. The Amsterdam Misophonia Scale  (A-MISO -S; Schröder  et al., 2013 ) is a 6 -item scale that \nmeasures different facets of misophonia, namely time consumed by the condition, its impact \non one’s functioning, level of distress, level of resistance, perceived control over thoughts, \nand avoidance behaviours.  \n \nPermission  to use the above measures were granted after communication with t he intellectual \nproperty rights holders.  \nFinal S -Five  \nThe 25 -items 5 -factors solution had the closest fit across 4 different samples ( EFA, CFA, general \npopulation , and individuals who identify with misophonia  samples). The final statement items and \ntheir assignment to factors are presented in Table 1 below. The copyright of the scale belongs to Dr \nVitoratou and King’s College London1 and can be used freely for non -commercial , education al and \nresearch purposes, provided that  the developers are  informed and acknowledged . Please contact Dr \nVitoratou for advice on the administration of the scale.  \nThe five factor emerging were:   internalising  appraisals (e.g. “Sometimes I think that I am cra zy \nbecause of the way I feel when I hear certain sounds”), externalising  appraisals (“I get angry at other \npeople because of how disrespectful they are with the noises they make”), perceived threat  and \navoidance behaviour (“If I can't get away from certain  noises, I am afraid I might panic or feel like I'll \nexplode”), outbursts  (“Some sounds are so unbearable that I will shout at people to make them stop”) \nand impact  on functioning (“I don't meet friends as often as I'd like to because of the noises they \nmake”).  Reliability indices were excellent within each factor. Strong correlations emerged with other \nmisophonia scales. There was evidence that the five factors and the trigger endorsement were related \nto Depression and Anxiety. Age and gender had mild effe cts on the S -Five scores.   The trigger section \nof 37 sounds remained unaltered.  \nDetailed information on the psychometric properties (endorsement, norms, reliability, stability, \nvalidity) will be presented in a peer reviewed journal article currently under  preparation.  \n  \n \n1 Copyright © 2020 King’s College London All rights reserved.

If they've been informed and do it more because \nit amuses them to watch me squirm and get upset, then it's likely that \nwe're not going to be associating for much longer  \nWhen subjected to sounds of eating I fe el that the person making the \nsound is being selfish and uncaring  \nI find the sounds even more \nannoying if I am distressed or \nanxious  Definitely mood, stress levels and how tired I am has a major impact \nof the reaction to certain noises.  \n  \nThere are certa in sounds that I \ncannot bear to the degree that I \nmay become aggressive towards \npeople so they stop making them  Some of us feel the need to run and withdraw when the panic sets in \nwith the trigger sounds and not get aggressive  \n  \nYou are using the term \"aggressive\" but not distinguishing between \nverbal aggression and physical aggression. I often feel on the brink of \nverbal aggression and can sometimes become verbally aggressive but \nhave not become physically aggressive  \nI would only be verbally agg ressive, i.e. snapping at someone. I've \nnever and feel no urge, to be physical with someone. It's true rage - \nbut I would never act on it.  \nIn some cases, where I can't escape a certain sound, I've become \nviolent. However, this violence is targeted at mys elf; I'll punch a wall, \nor in the past I would have cut myself or forced myself to throw up  \nI am too embarrassed to let others \nknow that I can’t stand the noises \nthey make  It’s not that I’m embarrassed to let people know how bad my reaction \nis to certain sounds, but it’s been used against me before, to provoke \na reaction. I hide it to the best of my ability."

      "text": "People think misophonia is made up, therefore I can't explain I have \nmisophonia to some people as they won't believe me or they will \npurposely trigger me thinking it's funny.  \nMost times I’m not embarrassed to tell people their sounds or actions \nbother me, I’m embarrassed at the way I tell them, because it always \ncomes out in anger.  \nI am not embarrassed to let others know, I am cauti ous because in my \nexperience their reaction will be one of the following: 1. Ridicule or \ndismissive 2. Call me crazy - not a normal person 3. Offended think I’m \nmaking it up to hurt them. 4. Torture me with the sounds that they \nnow know hurt me.  \nSometimes in response to sounds I \nfell rage that is difficult to control  It isn't rage I feel it’s more extreme distress and intense anxiety and \npanic...a need to escape or to make the sound stop  \nI can feel physical pain if I cannot \navoid a sound  In regards to the question about feeling \"physical pain\", I'm not sure \nit's actual physical pain I feel but I do feel intense emotional pain  \nI wouldn’t classify the physical reaction as pain, but it is horribly \nunpleasant. Almost like being tickled to the point you can hardly \nbreath. It’s a twisting nervy sensation.  \nWhen people make certain sounds \nI feel like I almost hate them, even \nif this is not true at all  Most of the worst triggers are from the people you love the most. I \nhate the trigger but not the person. Hard t o distinguish sometimes.  \nPeople I just met do not bother me as much versus someone I have \nknown for a longer period of time.  \nTo make people understand how \nannoying are the sounds they \nmake, I mimic them, exaggerating \nthe sounds  I do mimic people’s sounds and movements, and in an exaggerated \nway, but it is to sooth my internal pain response, not to let them know \nit is bothering me.  \nThere is another reason for mimicking the sound - something to do \nwith control or reclaiming it, not just to show someone how annoying \nit is. I often repeat or mimic as a coping strategy or reaction  \nWhen I mimic the sound it's to relieve my own feelings not others. If I \ncannot mimic the sound the negative feelings become more intense. I \nhave become aware over many years that some of my triggers are \nspecific to certain people and they are more often than not people \nwho I see regular or live with.  \nI don’t like myself because of my \nresponses to certain sounds  I don't dislike myself consistently. I don’t like  myself in the moments \nof my reactions to sound.  \nSome sounds have caused me use \nviolence towards myself or others  I use violence more towards myself, as the rage and inability to stop a \nsound will make me feel suicidal  \nI have never been violent towards others. Only myself. Distinguishing \nthis in the question would help.  \nI have never been violent toward others but I do scratch/punch myself \nor dig my nails into my neck if I cannot avoid a trigger  \n  \n Table A2. Comments from the second wave of data collection  \nItem  Comment  \nSound of biting/picking/cutting nails or \nskin You have too many trigger sounds that are different grouped into \none question. E.g. fingernail  biting and nail clipping. Different \nsounds that are grouped on one question. Cutlery on plates and \nteeth grouped onto one question. Very different sound. I am \ntriggered by nail biting not nail clipping. And triggered by cutlery on \nteeth not plates.  Cutlery noises, e.g. scraping utensils on \nplate or teeth  \nMechanical sounds like engines revving  It's worse when the sounds are unexpected or uncontrollable. I \nwish the questions were a little clearer or there was a way to \nspecify things like distance/dur ation/intensity. Sudden loud engine \nrevving noises are a lot more upsetting than a car driving by"

Listening to a car with loud distorted bass parked outside \nfor 15 minutes is worse than hearing one just drive down the block. \nA baby crying across the street is a little distracting, but one crying \nin the same room can be almost unbearable. Etc...  \nI didn't know if the question about car engines was all engines or \njust loud engines. Loud engines and motorcycles are triggering \nnoises, but quiet engin es are fine. Emergency vehicles sirens are \nalso unbearable.  \nI am afraid that people will see me \nlose my temper in response to noise, \nand they will think I'm not the kind or \ncalm person they thought I was  The question that assumes people are kind and would lose that \nstatus if they exploded is a poor question. It is assuming that all \npeople who suffer from Misophonia are kind or label themselves as \nkind outside of their suffering.  \nI would change jobs if I could not stand \nthe sounds made in the work \nenvironment  The statements are regarding hypothetical \"can happen\" \nsituations, but in my case it already \"happened\". Example: \"I would \nchange jobs if I could not stand the sounds\" - I am not even looking \nfor a job anymore. My career (and life) is completely r uined . \nI am cautious when telling people that \nthe sounds they make are unbearable \nin fear of offending them  Even if something bothers me profoundly I'm not inclined to say \nanything because other people get angry. So I can't say I'd leave a \njob or alienate  myself. But I may cry or have an anxiety attack in \nprivate.  \nThe way I react to certain triggering \nsounds makes others dislike me  In question 13 about \"The way I react to certain triggering sounds \nmakes others dislike me\" it is hard to say since I’ve rare ly \nconfronted anybody with my problem. But the few times I’ve done \nwith people close to me, I have felt ashamed as I’ve felt them being \ndisappointed that I could get upset about something \"so small\"  \nI avoid visiting friends' houses as I \nworry that I will have to bear horrible \nsounds which they and their families \nmake  The verbiage can create skewed answers. Some questions use the \nwords “horrible sounds”. It could be worded better to not invoke \nunrelated emotions.  \nI don't have any friends that trigger me as that's a selection criteria \nI use for friends.  \nThis one was interesting because for me if someone makes horrible \nsounds I would just not be their friend.  \nI feel embarrassed by the way I tell \npeople I don't lik e the noises they \nmake, because it usually comes out \nwhen I'm already angry or upset  I did not answer \"I feel embarrassed by the way I tell people I don't \nlike the noises they make, because it usually comes out when I'm \nalready angry or upset\" because I ne ver told anyone when being \nangry or upset I did not answer \"I get angrier when triggering \nsounds are made by people who I think should know better\" \nbecause I did not understand.  \n\"Embarrassed\" isn't the right word, but I usually don't tell other \npeople ab out miso because it's more trouble than it's worth. I'm \nworried about how they'll respond, I don't like trying to explain \nmyself, worry about their reaction, etc.  \nI take it as a personal insult when \npeople make certain sounds in my \npresence  \"I take it as a personal insult when people make certain sounds in \nmy presence\" depends if they know I have some certain triggers but \ndisregards it. if they do not have any idea it is not their fault at all \nand I don’t feel it is an insult . \nSounds that ar e made by animals or \nchildren are less triggering because \nthey don’t realise that they are making \nthem  My reaction to animals is different from my reaction to children. I \nfind babies and children completely intolerable. Most sounds from \npets are fine inclu ding eating sounds. Repetitious barking from my \nneighbour’s dogs builds my bad reaction over a few minutes and \ndoes not prevent me from having dogs of my own that I take care \nof and train so that they don't develop such bad habits. On the \nother hand, a chi ld or baby screaming or crying sends me into hell \nimmediately. I want nothing to do with them and refuse to ever \nhave any of my own. Children are not allowed in my home, but pets \nare welcome."
