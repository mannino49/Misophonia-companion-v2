Introduction\nIt has long been appreciated that sounds can evoke emotions\nthat help prepare individuals to cope with potential negative and\npositive environmental scenarios e.g. survival threats and repro-\nduction [1].\nMusic, frequently the most sought after sound, has the ability to\n‘stir the emotions’ and give considerable pleasure. However, there\nis debate whether music evokes a primary emotional response\n(emotivist position) or whether listeners perceive emotions\nexpressed by the music (cognitivist position) [2].\nEmotions can be triggered by all our sensory systems, but most\nearly work on the link between emotional and physiological\nresponses has been carried out on the visual modality. Bradley\nand Lang [3]have been major authors in the study of physiological\nresponses, subjective assessment and behavioural reactions associ-\nated with processing emotional images and sounds. They found\nreliable patterns of physiological change in visceral, somatic and\ncentral systems including heart rate variation, changes in muscletone and skin conductance measures in response to sound stimuli\nwith different emotional and arousal content [3].The application of soundscapes in community noise evaluation\nis attempting to provide practical data that can be applied by archi-\ntects and designers to create pleasing acoustical environments [4].\nHowever, soundscapes provide complex auditory experiences\nand there are limited tools available to investigate their relative\nbeneﬁts.\nTherefore, recording objective physiological responses in asso-\nciation with subjective assessments of individual sounds could\nindicate meaningful patterns of response and provide a starting\npoint for a more complete objective assessment of soundscapes.\nThis approach of investigating various soundscapes by means of\nphysiological recordings in association with subjective assess-\nments does not seem to have been applied before.\nIn the recent interdisciplinary project Positive Soundscape Pro-\nject[5]the relationship between the emotional response to sound\nelements and simple physiological responses e.g. heart rate was\nexplored.\nThe primary goal of this study was to investigate the response\nof three simple physiological measures Heart Rate (HR), Respira-tion Rate (RR) and muscle tone (via EMG) to 18 relatively common\nsounds extracted from recorded soundscapes. While at the same\ntime assessing their pleasantness and arousal. There were three\nspeciﬁc questions posed:\nIs there a change in recorded physiology (HR, RR and EMG) in\nresponse to soundscape elements?\n0003-682X/$ - see front matter /C2112011 Elsevier Ltd.

      "text": "Is there a relationship between the pattern of the physiological\nchanges and the subjective assessment of pleasantness and\narousal of the sound?\nIs there a gender effect in any response?\n2. Method\n2.1. Subjects\nSubjects were 80 unpaid volunteers (44 males), aged 18–25 and\nall undergraduate students at Manchester Metropolitan University.\nThey were selected opportunistically within the University cam-\npus. Approximately 1 in 4 students approached agreed to take part\nand were then initially screened with four simple questions to ﬁt\nthe criteria:\n/C1518–25.\n/C15Undergraduate student.\n/C15No reported hearing difﬁculties.\n/C15No reported health condition which could affect results or be a\nsafety issue for themselves.\nEthical procedures were followed throughout including a\nscripted detailed introduction explaining the exact procedures\nbefore signed consent was taken.\n2.2. Stimulus material\nA key design objective in the present study was that the whole\nrecording procedure should take less than 20 min for each subject,\nthus avoiding motivational, compliance and recruitment issues.\nAlso, the physiological measures should be easy to capture, with\nminimal inconvenience to the subject, provide robust signals with\nsimple and well accepted methods of analysis.\nAuditory stimuli consisted of 18 sound-clips, each of 8 s dura-\ntion. Table 1 gives full track listings in running order of the\nsound-clips.\nAn issue in selecting sound-clip duration with this type of re-\nsearch relates to the ‘startle reﬂex’ [6]in response to a sudden loudnoise (e.g. a pistol shot) which can be clearly detected in physiolog-\nical responses (e.g. an eye-blink) to this type of auditory stimulation\nbut at much earlier latencies of about 40–100 ms. Such minor po-\ntential contamination should not affect our results as the sound-\nclips were not very loud and gathered from 8 s i.e. 8000 ms. The\n8 s sound-clips are similar in length to the 6 s used in the previous\nmajor work in this area [3]. In addition, there was no relationship\nbetween the sound levels of the clips and the physiological\nmeasures which ruled out this potential confounding issue.\nThe sound-clips were normalised using ‘Audacity’ software,\ncompiled onto one track which was played to each subject from\nthe same CD via the same headphones (Coby Digital (R) CV-100).\nQuasi-randomization of the sound-clips was carried out to\navoid the sounds occurring in sequence in similar categories e.g.\nhuman sounds. The content of the clips were selected from mate-rial provided by other researchers in the Positive Soundscape\nProject (see this Journal issue) with the intention of evoking a\nbroad range of rated arousal and pleasure estimates.\n2.3. Subjective responses\nImmediately following each sound-clip subjects made two sub-\njective responses concerning the sound just heard. The Pleasant-\nness and Arousal evoked by the sound were rated, using prepared\nresponse sheets with 9-point numerical scales as seen below:\n2.4. Physiological measurements\nThree physiological measurements were recorded on software\nChart 5 using PowerLab\n/C210link to a PC:\n/C15Heart Rate (HR) expressed as beats per minute.\n/C15Respiration Rate (RR) expressed as breaths per minute.\n/C15Electromyography (EMG) expressed as the Root Mean Squared\n(RMS) of the amplitude in microvolts.\nHeart rate was measured via an electrocardiogram (ECG) apply-\ning standard procedures with electrodes placed on the upper rightand left side of the chest and on the wrist of the non-dominant\nhand [4].\nRespiration rate was measured using a respiration belt wired to\nPowerLab\n/C210that recorded breathing movements. The belt was\nplaced around the lower chest/abdomen although needed to be\nlowered around the abdomen in some subjects. It was ﬁtted se-\ncurely yet without restricting normal breathing and could be\nplaced over light clothing. The sensitivity was altered for each sub-\nject as necessary.\nElectromyography was measured using EMG electrodes\nplaced on the forehead over the corrugator muscles. A self-\nadhesive electrode was placed over each eyebrow at the nasion\nend, the leads and electrodes were secured with micropore\ntape.\n2.5. Measurement recording software\nAll of the physiological recordings were stored in LabChart. The\nphysiological responses to the sound-clips were determined by\nanalyzing 8s of silence before the sound and 8s during the sound.Table 1\nThe content of the 18 sound-clips and the sound number in running order.\nSound number Sound content\n1 Horses hooves on road\n2 Kids playing clapping game in schoolyard3 Female coughing + trafﬁc noise4 2x Fox screams + quiet hum in background\n5 Fireworks\n6 Sound of jet plane ﬂying overhead7 Waves plus hum of electricity8 Vomiting + trafﬁc noise9 Child giggling plus trafﬁc sounds\n10 Jackhammer + trafﬁc noise\n11 Man hiccupping + trafﬁc noise\n12 Evening birdsong, some trafﬁc sounds\n13 Football crowd chanting and cheering14 Fountain, kids playing, some laughter and yelling15 Footsteps, sound of clock tower bells ringing16 Fire engine siren + trafﬁc noise17 String quartet, some trafﬁc and chatter18 Church bells chiming, trafﬁc noise, some chatter\n276 K.

      "text": "By using the Datapad facility on LabChart, the mean measures were\ncalculated from the required 8 s sections.\nAny recording comments were added and labelled at the start of\nevery sound. Any recording artefacts due to movement could be\ndeleted after noting which data points they affected. The datapad\nthen contained all of the data which could be copied into the main\ndatabase for further analysis.\n2.6. Experimental procedure\nGeneral introductory statements were made to potential\nsubjects, which explained the basic aim and method of the exper-\niment, and the time involved, which was approximately 15–20 min\nper subject. When the equipment was fully attached including\nheadphones they were seated facing a blank wall with their\nresponse sheet and pen in a small sound-attenuated laboratory.\nA small desk lamp gave sufﬁcient light for the subject to see their\nresponse sheet.\nEach sound-clip was edited to 8 s, interspersed with 20 s of\nsilence. The ﬁrst 12 s of the silence period was allocated for subjec-\ntive response time when the subject rated the sound-clip (see\nabove) and the last 8s of silence was designated as base-line for\nphysiological comparison with the next sound-clip.\nA test track of 1 sound-clip and silence was played before the\nmain track sequence to allow subjects to relax, eliminating\nresponses due to anticipation, also giving opportunity to check full\nunderstanding of the instructions and to check the viability of the\nphysiological recordings.\n3. Results\n3.1. Data analysis\nAny outlying data which appeared clearly erroneous\n(HR < 45 bpm and RR < 6 bpm) were removed. The data were ana-\nlysed via a linear mixed model ANOVA using restricted maximum\nlikelihood estimation.\n3.2. Subjective estimates\nThe mean pleasure and arousal ratings for each sound are pre-\nsented in Fig. 1 . The scatter plot indicates that the sounds with\nsimilar emotional content are grouped together in the same affec-tive space as one might predict. For example, for low arousal and\nhigh pleasantness, the sounds are waves, evening birdsong and\nchurch bells. It also reveals that the mean rated pleasantness of\nthe sounds ﬁlled most of the range of this affective dimension\nwhile the arousal range is more restricted.\nThe least pleasant sound, with a mean of 1.2, was vomiting\n(sound 8). The most pleasant sound, with a mean of 7.1, was even-\ning bird song (sound 12). On the other hand, the least arousing\nsound with a mean of 3.4 was horse’s hooves on road (sound 1).\nWhile the most arousing sound with a mean of 6.5 was ﬁreworks\n(sound 5).\n3.3. Physiological responses\nThe mean HR for both the silence before and during the sound-\nclips are shown in Fig. 2 . This indicates that the effect of sound fol-\nlowing silence lowered HR in all cases but to varying degrees. A\ntrend for HR to increase over the duration of the experimental ses-\nsion in both silence before and during sound-clips was identiﬁed.\nThe various ‘‘peaks’’ and ‘‘dips’’ in the HR-during plot ( Fig. 2 )\nindicate a relationship with the perceived pleasantness of the\nsound-clip. For example, at sound No.4, there is a distinct ‘‘dip’’\nin the mean HR during this sound-clip of ‘‘2 Fox Screams’’ which\nwas ranked 4th most unpleasant .An example of a ‘‘peak’’ is seen\nat sound No. 9 ‘‘Child Giggling’’ which is ranked 16th out of 18,\nindicating that it is one of the most pleasant sounds amongst par-\nticipants. The critical measure is the change between the HR before\nand the HR during the sound-clip which appears to be determined\nby the pleasantness of the sound-clip.\nThe trend is repeated at sound No. 11 with a ‘‘dip’’ in HR during,\nwhich is of a ‘‘man hiccupping’’ which is ranked 5th most unpleas-\nant. Another ‘‘peak’’ in the graph is seen at sound No. 12 ‘‘evening\nbirdsong’’ which was ranked as the most pleasant sound. This pat-\ntern clearly suggests that the degree of reduction in HR from the\nsilence (HR before) condition depends directly on how unpleasant\nthe sound-clip was considered to be.\nA signiﬁcant interaction was found between the measure of HR\nand sound-clip, F(1, 17) = 2.252, p= 0.002 Indicating HR is inﬂu-\nenced by sound-clips.\nFig. 1.

The pleasantness scores were\ncondensed into 3 groups in which Group 1 contained scores 1, 2\nand 3 i.e. the most unpleasant, Group 2 included scores 4, 5 and6 i.e. neutral and Group 3 contained 7, 8 and 9 i.e. the most pleas-\nant.Fig. 3 a clearly shows that the more unpleasantly scored sound-\nclips gave the largest HR falls and the most pleasant gave the least\nHR fall.\nWhen the subjective assessments of pleasantness and the vari-\nous physiological measures were compared a signiﬁcant difference\nwas revealed for HR during sound-clip playback means and pleas-\nantness, F= 2.153, p= 0.029.3.5. Gender differences\nSigniﬁcant gender differences were found in the results for HR.\nIt is well known that females have a higher resting HR than males\nof about 5–10 bpm.

Respiration rate responses (RR)\nThe mean RR for both the silence before and during the sound-\nclips in the order that they were presented are shown in Fig. 4 .

Muscle tone responses (EMG)\nThe mean EMG (measured in RMS microvolts) for both the\nsilence before and during the sound-clips in the order that they\nwere presented, are shown in Fig. 6 . This indicates that the effect\nof sound following silence was to raise EMG noticeably for 5\nsound-clips (Numbers 3, 4, 8, 11 and 14). There was no general\nseparation between silence and sound-clip that was observed in\nthe previous HR and RR results.

Discussion\nIn terms of the aims of this study many consistent and signiﬁ-\ncant results have been realised which were in good general agree-\nment with the ﬁndings of a previous pilot experiment [7]\nparticularly as in the current study, the sound-clips were more\necologically valid in terms of approximating more to real environ-\nmental soundscapes. In essence the results showed that HR was\nlowered while RR was raised by listening to a sound-clip and the\neffects were greater with unpleasant sounds and for males. On\nthe other hand, EMG showed no gender effect and was increasedwith unpleasant sound-clips.\nThere was a highly signiﬁcant but small deceleration of the HR\nin response to unpleasant sounds of about 2 beats per minute. This\nagrees with previous major work [3]where Bradley and Lang\nfound the largest reduction in HR of 2.83 bpm was for a ‘human\nscream’ sound stimulus that was delivered for 6 s.\nHowever, some other work [8], which used longer stimulus\npresentations (30 s), showed an increase in HR associated with in-\ncreased arousal ratings. A potential problem with longer response\nwindows is that it gets more difﬁcult to be sure what aspect of the\nstimulus is being centrally processed by the brain and this makes\ninterpretation more difﬁcult.\nSome authors consider that the Startle response is the early\ncomponent of the Orienting physiological responses [9]which\nhas the ability to stop ongoing central processing and direct atten-\ntion at a novel stimulus. This process must be occurring in our sub-\njects as they attend to the new sound-clip following silence, but\nthe signiﬁcance of this effect in our experiments is considered mar-\nginal as our subjects knew that a series of auditory stimuli would\nbe delivered at a set frequency through their headphones. So\nfollowing the initial trial there was little orientation to be done just\na repetitive simple listening task to attend to the sound-clip and\nmake two assessments of its pleasantness and arousal.\nIt was a pleasing outcome in this research that relatively low\ntechnical and cost equipment can give results similar to results\nachieved by high technical laboratories on focused research\nprojects. This indicates the relative ease of achieving signiﬁcant\nﬁndings in this area and may have application to further work on\nthe relative physiological health effects of different soundscapes.\nIt is considered that the relatively short duration of testing\n(<20 min) per subject avoided many potential problems e.g. bore-\ndom and the lack of attention to task.\nIt is well established that the normal resting HR for females is\nabout 5–10 bpm higher than for males. This was clearly reﬂected\nin our results with gender differences in HR in silence before the\nsound-clip and in response to the sound-clip with more signiﬁcant\naffects of sounds from males. Such gender differences for HR\nresponse to sounds are not clearly stated in the literature.\nIt was disappointing that we were not able to achieve a fuller\nrange of subjective estimates of arousal with our sound-clips\nwhich limited the conclusions that can be drawn about the affect\nof this subjective dimension on the physiological measures\nrecorded. It could be argued that it is generally easier to assess\nthe pleasantness of a sound than its arousal promoting features\nand as this latter concept is more cognitively complex to grasp in\nour group of students. It may have been the explanation for the\nmore restricted range for this dimension in the subjective\nresponses, as seen in Fig. 1 . Bradley and Lang [3]were able to\nachieve a fuller range of subjective emotions including arousal\nbut they used more extreme sound material such as screams,\nerotica and bomb-blasts.There was a small but highly signiﬁcant increase of the RR in\nresponse to sounds of about 1 breath per minute. The size of the\nincrease in RR depended on the subjective pleasantness of the\nsound-clip, such that, the more pleasant the sound-clip was per-\nceived to be, the greater was the RR increase. There was a clear\ngender affect with this result, in which the increase in RR was far\nmore apparent in males than females.\nThe EMG showed a marked elevation in level for some sound-\nclips compared with prior silence. Comparison of the EMG eleva-\ntion with the subjective pleasantness of the sound-clip revealed\ngreater elevation for more unpleasant sounds. However, unlike\nthe RR results, there was no gender affect revealed for the EMG\nresults.\nBradley and Lang [3]who have carried out major work in this\narea, did not record RR but they did record EMG and found that lis-tening to unpleasant sounds caused more corrugator EMG activity\nand HR deceleration, our results agree with these authors.\nGomez and Danuser [7]investigated physiological responses,\nincluding RR, and corresponding subjective estimates of pleasant-\nness to environmental noises and music. These authors found\nbreathing accelerated with decreases in pleasantness. These results\nare opposite to ours but they used longer stimulus presentations\n(30 s) and they only used the last 15 s of the stimulus period for\ncomparison, which makes direct comparison impossible.\n5. Conclusions\nOur results indicate an interesting proﬁle of signiﬁcant simple\nphysiological measures in response to presentation of a sound-clip\nthat is considered unpleasant, there is a clear tendency for HR to\nfall, RR to show a small increase and EMG to rise. Compared with\npleasant sounds which cause minimal HR falls, clear RR rises and\nthe EMG is relatively unchanged. A clear gender effect was\nobserved with males showing larger HR and RR responses.\n5.1. Future work\nThere are a number of ways that this approach could be devel-\noped in future research to assess more real-life scenarios and\nsoundscapes:\n/C15The duration of a single sound-clip could be increased to inves-\ntigate habituation and within sound analysis could be\nemployed, plus longer sound-clips would allow techniques\nwhich could indicate the sympathetic-parasympathetic balance\nin the autonomic nervous system’s response.\n/C15The inﬂuence of context could be investigated by having ‘‘con-\ntextually supportive’’ sounds e.g. wind in trees background with\nbird noise added and ‘‘contextually incongruence sounds’’ sea\nwaves background with short periods of city trafﬁc.\n/C15Another contextual theme could be to have ‘‘contextually sup-\nportive’’ visual images to accompany sounds compared with\n‘‘contextually disparate’’ visual images.\n/C15It would be interesting to record physiological measures while\ninspecting architectural models, real or virtual, with corre-\nsponding soundscapes to gain information on the objective\nresponses to such complex stimulus ﬁelds.\nAcknowledgements\nStephanie Bent, Leanne Waite and Michael Aylmer for help with\ndata collection.\nNeil Bruce & Amy Irwin for help with preparation of the sound-\nclips.280 K.
