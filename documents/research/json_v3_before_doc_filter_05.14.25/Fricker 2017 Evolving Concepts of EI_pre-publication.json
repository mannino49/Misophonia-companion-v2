      "text": "Evolving Concepts of Epistemic Injustice  \n \nWhat does the concept of epistemic injustice do for us? What should we want it to \ndo? If meaning is use, then there is no point trying to put precise boundaries on the \nconcept in advance; indeed its use has already evolved, spreading slightly more \nwidely than originally intended, and for good reason. My chief purpose in invoking \nthe label was to delineate a distinctive class of wrongs, namely those in which \nsomeone is ingenuously downgraded and/or disadvantaged in respect of their status as \nan epistemic subject. A first point to make is that this kind of epistemic injustice is \nfundamentally a form of (direct or indirect) discrimination. The cause of testimonial \ninjustice is a prejudice through which the speaker is misjudged and perceived as \nepistemically lesser (a direct discrimination). This will tend to have negative effects \non how they are perceived and treated non-epistemically too —secondary aspects of \nthe intrinsic wrong. The cause of a hermeneutical injustice is a background inequality \nof hermeneutical opportunity —specifically, hermeneutical marginalisation in relation \nto some area of social experience. This puts them at an unfair disadvantage in \ncomprehending and/or getting others to comprehend an experience of that kind (a \nsomewhat indirect discrimination). It might therefore be a good idea to explicitly label \nboth these phenomena as forms of ‘discriminatory epistemic injustice’; f or as David \nCoady (2010; and this volume) has rightly emphasized, we should leave room for \nsomething called ‘ epistemic injustice ’ that is primarily a distributive injustice —\nsomeone’s receiving less than their fair share of an epistemic good, such as education , \nor access to expert advice or information.1 In this kind of epistemic injustice too, after \n                                                 \n1 The distinction between ‘discriminatory’ and ‘distributive’ is not intended as a deep \nand/or exclusive demarcation of course, since most cases of one will have aspects of"

      "text": "2 all, someone is indeed wronged in their capacity as an epistemic subject and so it fits \nthe generic definition originally given (Fricker 2007).  \n \nBut following on the heels of this welcome broadening of the remit of ‘epistemic \ninjustice’ in general, I would like to advocate continued strictness with regard to the \nremit of (what I am now labelling) ‘discriminatory epistemic injustice ’, for I believe \nthe category will only be useful if it remains bounded and specific, not relaxing \noutwards to embrace the generality of unfair interpersonal manipulations or, again, \nsystemic riggings of the epistemic economy. The many and various forms of these \nthings will tend to merit their own classifications, and that is how we will best \ncontinue the business of bringing to light the different ethical and political dimensions \nof our epistemic lives.2  \n \nTheorising the Unintend ed \nStrictness in what respect? Essentially I have in mind the question of intention, or \nrather its absence. In testimonial injustice the absence of deliberate, conscious \nmanipulation is definitive, at least in my conception. I was trying to bring out a \nphenomenon that is easy to miss, and in need of a name. In this kind of epistemic \ninjustice, the hearer makes a special kind of misjudgemen t of the speaker’s \ncredibility —one actually clouded by prejudice. And this is importantly different from \n                                                                                                                                            \nthe other. Not getting your fair share of a good will often be the cause and/or the \nresult of discrimination of some kind.  \n2 See, for instance, Fricker (2016) ‘Epistemic Injustice and the Preservation of \nIgnorance’, in which I argue that for the most part Charles Mills’ category ‘white \nignorance’ is I believe designed to distinguish an importantly different cat egory from \n‘hermeneutical injustice’; though I also argue that the two phenomena overlap \nwherever white ignorance comes in the form of a poverty of shared concepts or social \nmeanings, as opposed to non-sharedness of beliefs and priorities of epistemic \nattention. I take both to be important phenomena meriting their own categorisation."

      "text": "3 any deliberate misrepresentation of someone’s true or reasonable beliefs as false or \nrationally unfounded, for when that happens the perpetrator herself need not misjudge \nthe other’s epistemic status at all. Precisely not —rather she sees that he knows, or has \nreasons, but she intends to cause others to doubt these things, and to downgrade his \nepistemic status in their eyes. Testimonial injustice by contrast happens by way of a \ndiscriminatory but ingenuous misjudgement; and it will, I believe, be useful to \ncontinue keeping this separate from the closely related kind of injustice that involves \nthe deliberate manipulation of others’ judgements of credibility .  \n \nThis is in no measure to downplay the importance of deliberate interpersonal \nmanipulations of credibility relations. On the contrary, it is a pervasive epistemic, \nethical, and political phenomenon —political not only with a small ‘p’ but with a \ncapital too, for manipulating credibility relations is the stock in trade of professional \npolitical campaigns, in which one side will try to get the electorate to think the other \nside doesn’t have a clue, or cannot be trusted, or both. Furthermore, such deliberate \nmanipulations of credibility relations will often be causally connected with the \nmechanism of a testimonial injustice. Looking to the movie of The Talented Mr \nRipley, for example, if we consider again for a moment the testimonial injustice which \nI argued (Fricker 2007) Greenleaf senior does to Marge Sherwood in misperceiving \nher as a hysterical lovelorn woman whose ‘female intuition’  that Ripley is Dickie’s \nkiller is evidentially unfounded, then we confront a telling example. Here Ripley has \ndeliberately manipulated the sexist prejudices of the day in order to induce in \nGreenleaf a certain misperception of Marge and her suspicions, and the result is that \nRipley successfully causes Greenleaf to do Marge a grave testimonial injustice. Thus \nwe see that the deliberate manipulation of others ’ prejudices is likely to be an"

      "text": "4 effective way of producing an authentic testimonial injustice —a way of inducing in \nanother a prejudiced judgement of credibility in respect of a speaker. Ripley’s \nrepeated dismissive or faux sympathetic remarks to Greenleaf about Marge do the \ntrick very nicely, and they are deliberately designed to cause Greenleaf to be \nimpervious to the rationality of Marge’s suspicions, thereby doing her  a testimonial \ninjustice . But we don’t want our concept  of testimonial injustice to blur what Ripley \ndoes and what Greenleaf does, because the point of the concept was to bring into \nfocus a certain class of epistemic misjudgements, and Ripley does not epistemically \nmisjudge Marge at all. For this reason I would advocate continued strictness about \n‘testimonial injustices ’ being unintentional: a species of ingenuous epistemic \nmisjudgement. (We perhaps need another label for Ripley ’s wicked puppetry— a \nthird-personal intentional gaslighting.3)  \n \nSecond, and in the case of hermeneutical injustice now, the hearer who cannot \nunderstand because she lacks sufficiently shared concepts with the speaker might be \ntrying in earnest to understand, but is unable because of an objective difficulty. She is \nnot deliberately manipulating, concealing, or blanking anything. Again, I think it is \nworth emphasising this, simply because otherwise one walks away with the \nimpression that so long as we all make reasonable efforts and avoid bad faith no one \nwill suffer a hermeneutical injustice. Not so, for the cause of the injustice is \nstructural —the background hermeneutical marginalization —and so the injustice will \ntend to persist regardless of individual efforts. Hermeneutical injustice is the \nactualization of unequal hermeneutical opportunity, which can be somewhat mitigated \n                                                 \n3 In this connection, see Rachel McKinnon (this volume), who shows how there can \nalso be gaslighting that is unintentional, even specifically well-meaning, and which \ncan constitute a form of testimonial injustice."

Any such virtuous listening will somewhat erode hermeneutical \nmarginalisation, because the more actively a hearer listens the more the spea ker’s \nhermeneutical marginalization is thereby eroded —they are thereby enabled to \ncontribute more than before to the shared hermeneutical resource. But insofar as \nhermeneutical marginalisation is a product of social powerlessness (and is a form of \nit), the actual eradication of this kind of injustice will require significantly more than \nsuch slight interpersonal hermeneutical empowerments; it will require sufficient \nsocial equality in general, to ensure that new areas of hermeneutical marginalization \ndo not keep re-emerging with new patterns of unequal power. \n \nQuick on the heels of emphasizing the non-deliberate nature of both these kinds of \nepistemic injustice, however, I would also like to join others in emphasizing the \nimportance of recognizing the role of our agency in sustaining them, and to point out \nthat non-deliberateness does not entail non-culpability. (On the contrary, in \nconnection with testimonial injustice I assume prejudiced thinking is almost always \nculpable in some degree —it’s just also very ordinary.)  And there are many intriguing \ninterim cases where it is unclear, even indeterminate, how far the hearer in a moment \nof either testimonial or hermeneutical injustice may be colluding with the forces of \nprejudice or of hermeneutical marginalization to prevent the speaker ’s word being \nproperly received. The slippery slope to bad faith and self-interested or plain lazy \ndenial is an ever-present factor in situations where the nascent content of the \nattempted communication is potentially challenging to the hearer’s status or , for \nwhatever other reason, outside of their epistemic comfort zone. A number of authors \nhave rightly emphasized and explored this point in illuminating ways (Medina 2012"

But I trust it is compatible with \ntheir developments of this aspect that discriminatory epistemic injustice might remain \na normative concept that carves out a space in which people are wronged in their \nstatus as a knower without that ever being a wrong done simply on purpose. The \ninteresting thing about denial, or other kinds of motivated or wilful ignorance or non-\nknowing is of course that it is not quite on purpose, or not in the normal conscious \nway. If, on the other hand, a hearer really does straightforwardly dissemble, \npretending not to understand when in fact she understands perfectly well, then that is \na closely related but distinct injustice from hermeneutical injustice.  \n \nIn thinking about the point of the concepts of epistemic injustice, it might help to \nglance briefly back to the aetiology of the concepts of testimonial and hermeneutical \ninjustice: what were these categories a response to? Through the nineties feminist \nphilosophy was a developing field of energised contention between two intellectual \ninheritances. The first was Marxism —much of feminist consciousness and the \nwomen’s movement , after all, had grown out of class consciousness and socialist \npolitics.4 This critical theoretical store supplied invaluable bold abstractions such as \nideology, false consciousness, and particularly the concept (from Lukà cs 19715) of a \nstandpoint (of the proletariat) which was epistemically privileged —this standpoint \nbeing a position or role in the relations of production which made available, false \nconsciousness notwithstanding, an epistemically privileged viewpoint on the social \nworld. The general idea was that the more hands-on involvement someone had in the \n                                                 \n4 With reference to the UK women’s movement and its roots in socialism, see Sheila \nRowbotham, Woman’s Consciousness, Man’s World  (London: Pelican, 1973). \n5 See the section entitled ‘The Standpoint of the Proletariat’ in Luk àcs 1971; pp. 149-\n209."

Postmodernism \nwas taking hold in the humanities, and many feminist theorists saw in it an ally. The \nphilosophical aspects of this culture-wide movement originated in various sources, \nand took different forms, but its philosophical notes included most sonorously \nFoucault’s refusal to separate power and truth, the exhilarating ring of which \nharmonised with Lyotard’s (1984) definitive postmodernist claim that ‘grand \nnarratives’ had had their day , so that projects of ‘legitimation’ were over and there \nwas consequently now only de facto legitimation of knowledge.

As regards Marxism, for my purposes the \nmonolithic social ontology of class —or its gender or race counterparts —remained at \nthat time riskily insensitive to other dimensions of difference, even if it was \nrecognized to be an abstraction rather than an empirical generalization.7 And as \nregards Foucault, on whose conception of power I explicitly drew, the reductionist \ndrift that inevitably attends any view characterised by a refusal to separate truth from \npower (though I would not read Foucault as positively committed to any bald \nreductionism on this score), made it unhelpfully provocative in its rhetoric: i f there is \nno separation between truth and power, then it at least sounds like you are saying \nthere is nothing more to knowledge than having the power to count as having \nknowledge; but if that were so then there could never be any injustice in being \ndeemed not to know. On such a reductionist view there could be no distinctively \nepistemic injustice, for there could be no contrast between the way power deems \nthings to be and how they are. ( On Foucault’s actual view see Allen this volume). \nSomehow the reductionist challenge, essentially frivolous though it always was, had \nestablished itself as a benchmark of politically conscious intellectual activity , its \nbogus radical rhetoric enjoying some considerable sway at the time. \n \nWhat was needed, I believed, was something much more easily recognisable as \nmaking sense of the lived experience of injustic e in how a person’s beliefs, reasons \nand social interpretations were received by others, even conscientious well-meaning \nothers.

Start with the experience of powerlessness and \nshow that it raises philosophical questions. That was the primary phenomenological \ndrive behind the notion of epistemic injustice, and it is why I continue to think it \nimportant in any broadly social philosophy to build up slowly from an account of \nwhat goes on at the interpersonal level.8 In this sense the interpersonal is political. \n \nAll this, moreover, is entirely compatible with the thought that there might be forms \nof testimonial injustice that are not interpersonal —not, as Elizabeth Anderson has \nhelpfully labelled it, ‘transactional’—but rather ‘structural’ (Anderson 2012). In \nmaking the distinction between transactional and structural testimonial injustice \nAnderson elaborates the following imagined example of structural testimonial \ninjustice. We imagine a list of expert witnesses that no one has refreshed for a good \nwhile, so that (through no one’s fault, let us add) the same old white male witnesses \ntend to be drawn on time and time again, and all those whose names would have made \nit onto the list if any official had been keeping more of a vigilant eye on updating it \nare effectively silenced. They are, perhaps unwittingly, on the receiving end of what I \ncall ‘pre-emptive testimonial injustice ’ (Fricker 2 007, ch. 6). Their views are not \nsought, and this is owing to a structural prejudice (the un-refreshed list). It is worth \nnoting that any such structural testimonial injustice would have to be pre-emptive, for \nas soon as anyone actually said anything (perhaps they speak uninvited and formally \nout of turn in the courtroom), it would become transactional as well as structural, \nsince there would be a speaker whose word was prejudicially received by another \n                                                 \n8 See Jeremy Wanderer (this volume)."

We cannot really get a grip on the phenomenon of testimonial injustice without \nanchoring it in transactional possibilities; but the extension of the idea of testimonial \ninjustice to structural forms is very helpful.  \n \nThe Interpersonal Is Political \nThere are two immediate upshots of starting one’s philosophical thinking  from the \n(partly imagined) experience of marginalization or powerlessness. The first is that the \ninitial focus is bound to be interpersonal, or transactional. The experiences in question \nare concrete, tending to involve individuals reacting to one another, standing in \nrelations of power to one another. To focus on such experiences is to bring into view \nall the micro aggressions and injustices that instantiate and indicate more structural, \nmacro formations of power. The second is that the initial focus is also bound to be on \ndysfunction rather than well-functioning, failures of justice or of reason rather than \nsuccesses.  \n \nTaking the first upshot first, around the same time that Foucault was writing about \nmicro power, feminists were declaring ‘the personal is political ’. They were both \nright. If you want to identify the operations of power in, say, practices through which \npeople attempt to put their beliefs, knowledge, opinions, and interpretations into the \nshared pool of ideas, then you should look to the micro, the transactional. The \ninterpersonal pushes and pulls in daily life encode the larger social structures one \nhopes to understand, and while I would not commit to the (perhaps Foucauldian) idea \nthat the micro is always prior, certainly it can be.

Start thought from marginalized lives. \n \nTaking the second upshot second, the idea that it might be philosophically fruitful to \nfocus on dysfunction rather than well-functioning has become increasingly popular, \nespecially with the help of the independent and more general notion of non-ideal \ntheory. Sometimes, as back-up to the general idea that the dysfunctional is interesting, \ninstructive, and ripe for theorising, authors offer the well-known, striking opening \nsentence of Tolstoy ’s Anna Karenina: ‘All happy families are alike; each unhappy \nfamily is unhappy in its own way’.  But I believe the real lesson from starting \nphilosophy with the dysfunctional is precisely not that the functional forms of \ninstitutions, practices, or experiences, or indeed families, are blandly the same as one \nanother. Quite the opposite. The lesson, rather, is that the functional forms of things \nneed to be seen as successfully staving off or coping with endemic problems and \ndifficulties. The real difference between a happy family and an unhappy one is that \nthe happy family has found a way to cope with its tensions and difficulties, at least not \nletting them eclipse family life, whereas the unhappy one has not. And the difference \nbetween a functional epistemic practice and a dysfunctional one is that the functional \npractice contains certain counter-pressures or mechanisms by which to stave off anti-\nveridical forces of various kinds, such as prejudice, for example. The interest in the \ndysfunctional and the non-ideal need not stem from an intrinsic interest in these things \n(though they are indeed interesting); rather it may stem simply from a realistic interest \nin how to achieve functionality in any given practice. Thus a philosopher who only \naimed to understand and represent epistemic practices in their most functional forms, \nperhaps even in some notionally ideal form, would still need to do so by looking first"

Their aim is to open up ‘an epistemic space for the lived \nexperience of illness’ (Carel & Kidd 2016; p. 16 .

In ‘Epistemic Injustice in Assessment of Delusions’ (Kyratsous & \nSanati 2015) they argue that sometimes in diagnosing a patient as delusional, a \nprejudicial stereotype of delusional persons as generally irrational can lead to an over-\ngeneralisation. In effect their delusionality is seen as affecting all their cognitive \nbehaviour rather than just affecting more local regions of it. By way of two case \nstudies they show that this all-too-easy prejudicial over-generalisation can lead to \nsecondary concrete unfair disadvantages for the person diagnosed, such as being \n‘treated in a coercive manner’ (p. 5).

Most ill persons are \ncapable of describing their experiences in non-expert terms, but such \nexperiences are (a) largely considered inappropriate for public discussion and \n(b) play little or no role in clinical decision making (Carel & Kidd 2015; p. \n13).  \nSo ill people tend to be hermeneutically marginalised in the sense that the non-expert \nterms in which they naturally and effectively understand their experiences of illness \nare not sufficiently shared across social space as regards the decision-making of the \nprofessionals whose judgements they rely on. When a resultant failure of shared \nintelligibility takes place, a hermeneutical injustice occurs and the pati ent’s \nperspective goes missing from the process of care itself. (See also Carel & Kidd this \nvolume.) \n \nThese new applications of the concepts of testimonial and hermeneutical injustice \nexemplify the ground-up energies that will no doubt somewhat evolve the concepts \nthemselves, perhaps ultimately broadening them out in unforeseen ways. The use-\ndriven evolution of the concepts will I hope continue to be fuelled by these sorts of \nreal interests in explaining the experiences of those on the less powerful end of \nvarious relationships. If so, that will reflect a widening commitment to the usefulness \nof starting philosophical thinking from experiences of powerlessness, chiefly because \nthat is a good way to arrive ultimately at a philosophical account of how things should"
