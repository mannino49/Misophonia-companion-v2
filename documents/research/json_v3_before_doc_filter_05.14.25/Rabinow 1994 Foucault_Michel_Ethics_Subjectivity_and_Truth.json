      "text": "SERIES PREFACE \nMichel Foucault provides a splendid definition of work: \"That which is \nsusceptible of introducing a significant difference in the field of knowl­\nedge, at the cost of a certain difficulty for the author and the reader, \nwith, however, the eventual recompense of a certain pleasure, that is \nto say of access to another figure of truth.\"1 Diverse factors shape \nthe emergence, articulation, and circulation of a work and its effects. \nFoucault gave us intellectual tools to understand these phenomena. In \nMichel Foucault: Essential Works, we use these very tools to understand \nhis own work. Though he intended his books to be the core of his intel­\nlectual production, he is also well known for having made strategic use \nof a number of genres-the book and the article to be sure, but also \nthe lecture and the interview. Indeed, few modern thinkers have used \nsuch a wide array of forms in so skillful a fashion, making them an \nintegral component in the development and presentation of their work. \nIn this light, our aim in this series is to assemble a compelling and rep­\nresentative collection of Foucault's written and spoken words outside \nthose included in his books. \nFoucault died on June 25, '1984, at age fifty-seven, of AIDS, just days \nafter receiving the first reviews of the second and third volumes of The \nHistory if Sexuality in the hospital. A year previous to his death, when \nhe was showing no signs of illness, he had written a letter indicating \nthat he wanted no posthumous publications; through the course of com­\nplex negotiations between those legally responsible to him, intellectu­\nally engaged with him, and emotionally close to him, it was decided \nthat this letter constituted his will. He left behind, as far as we know, \nno cache of unpublished texts; we must conclude, then, that his papers \nwere \"in order.\" Ten years later, Editions Gallimard published Dits et \necrits, well over three thousand pages of texts, organized chronologi­\ncally. The editors sought to collect all Foucault's published texts (pref­\naces, introductions, presentations, interviews, articles, interventions, \nlectures, and so on) not included in his books. We have made a selec­\ntion, eliminating overlapping or repetition of different versions of sim­\nilar materials. Likewise, a number of the lectures and courses will in \ntime be published separately in English."

We have organized them thematically. Selecting from this cor­\npus was a formidable responsibility that proved to be a challenge and \na pleasure. Many of these texts were previously unavailable in English. \nIn broad lines, the organization of the series follows one proposed by \nFoucault himself when he wrote: \"My objective has been to create a \nhistory of the different modes by which, in our culture, human beings \nare made subjects. My work has dealt with three modes of objectifi­\ncation which transform human beings into subjects.\"2 In Volume One, \nfollowing his course summaries from the College de France, which pro­\nvide a powerful synoptic view of his many unfinished projects, the texts \naddress \"the way a human being turns him-or herself into a subject.\"5 \nVolume Two is organized around Foucault's analysis of \"the modes of \ninquiry which try to give themselves the status of the sciences.\"4 Sci­\nence, for Foucault, was a domain of practices constitutive of experience \nas well as of knowledge. Consequently, this volume treats the diverse \nmodes of representations, of signs, and of discourse. Finally, Volume \nThree contains texts treating \"the objectivizing of the subject in divid­\ning pratices,\"5 or, more generally, power relations. \nNOTES \nI Foucault, \"Des Travaux,\" in Dits et ecrits (Paris: Gallimard, 1994), vol. 4, p. 367. \n2 Foucault, \"The Subject and Power,\" in Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics, \n2d ed., Hubert Dreyfus and Paul Rabinow (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983), p. 208. \n3 Idem. \n4 Idem. \n5 Idem."

      "text": "THE HISTORY OF SYSTEMS OF THOUGHT \nMichel Foucault delivered his first lecture at the College de France, \nFrance's most prestigious academic institution, on December 2, 1970, \nat the age of forty-four. I He named his chair at the College \"The His­\ntory of Systems of Thought.\" \"Systems of thought,\" he wrote, \"are the \nforms in which, during a given period of time, knowledges [savoirs] \nindividualize, achieve an equilibrium, and enter into communication.\"* \nFoucault divided his work on the history of systems of thought into \nthree interrelated parts, the \"re-examination of knowledge, the con­\nditions of knowledge, and the knowing subject.\"2 Faithful to the broad \ncontours of this program, he moved increasingly in the last decade or so \nof his life toward an emphasis on the third term, the knowing subject. \nAs part of his application to the College de France, Foucault had sub­\nmitted a project of instruction and research, on \"the knowledge [savoir] \nof heredity\" as a system of thought. The choice of heredity as a research \ntopic is fully in line with the work he had carried out in cooperation \nwith Georges Canguilhem, the historian and philosopher of the life \nsciences with whom he was working during this period. The project's \ngoal was to expand the analYSis of natural history and biology, which \nFoucault had undertaken in The Order if Things. How did it happen, he \nasked, that a nonprestigious set of knowledges, such as those surround­\ning breeding, eventually took the form and function of a science-une \nconnaissance scientifique-as important as genetics? In what specific \nfashion did this particular science \"take up\" more general historical \nevents and enter into relations with other structures? The answers to \nthese questions, Foucault held, would require philosophical concepts \nand detailed empirical inquiry. He wrote that, whenever possible, he \nwould employ \"a concrete example\" to \"serve as a testing ground for \nanalysis.\" This deceptively simple rule of thumb provided him with \na powerful means to counterbalance the weaknesses and to multiply \nthe strengths of standard historical and philosophical approaches. \nHe drew on existing resources, putting them to new uses. From the \ngreat French tradition of the Annales school of historical analysis, he \n*See p. 5 of this volume. Hereafter, all page citations given in parentheses are to this \nvolume."

One could say, to simplify, that he sought to work \nat the nexus where the history of practices met the history of concepts. \nIn 1966, Foucault had ended his most famous book, The Order of \nThings, impatiently awaiting the dispersal of the episteme of Man, \nthinking he discerned glimmers of an imminent reassemblage of lan­\nguage into a new form. In his inaugural lecture at the College, \"The \nOrder of Discourse,\" he looked back to the sixth century B.C. For him, \nit had been a time of \"Greek poets [speaking] true discourse ... inspir­\ning respect and terror ... meting out justice, weaving into the fabric of \nfate,\" before the tragic rupture, \"a century later [when] Truth moved \nfrom the ritualized act-potent and just-to settle on what was enun­\nciated: its meaning, its form, its object, and its relation to what it \nreferred to.\"3 He solemnly announced that his project-and the goal \nof his work-was \"to question our will to truth, to restore to discourse \nits character as an event; to abolish the sovereignty of the signifier.\"4 \nHowever, he would shortly abandon this nostalgia for a union of power, \njustice, and discourse. In order to rethink the goal of overcoming the \nwill to truth, he would abandon his attempt to look back to the time \nof the Greek poets-just as he would foresake his state of alert, ever­\nattentive to signs of a coming episteme. Nevertheless, he continued to \nthink about how to move beyond sovereign regimes of power and dis­\ncourse to question the will to truth. \nEarlier in the inaugural lecture, Foucault wondered, \"what has been, \nwhat still is, throughout our discourse, this will to truth which has sur­\nvived throughout so many centuries of our history; or if we ask what \nis, in its very general form, the kind of division governing our will to \nknowledge\"? He answered, \"we may discern something like a system \nof exclusion (historical, modifiable, institutionally constraining) in the \nprocess of development.\"5 This formulation is vintage Foucault. From \nhis earliest publications, he had identified and analyzed the functions \nof systems of exclusions variously linked to scientific categorizations. \nHe continued to produce analyses of the will to knowledge, but they \ngradually came to be situated within a different framework. The will to \ntruth, on the other hand, maintains a rather obscure presence through­\nout his work. At times, he strongly contrasts the will to truth with the"

Apparently, at this point, as he entered \nthe College de France, Foucault had not established an adequate con­\nceptual framework within which to develop this opposition. \nThe Courses \nThe submission of \"course summaries\" was one of the few bureaucratic \nrequirements at the College. The summaries Foucault submitted are \nremarkably straightforward, even didactic. The courses themselves \nshared this pedagogical quality, although they were often presented \nwith exuberant humor and theatrical flair. They provide a series of pre­\nliminary sketches of extraordinary vitality and lucidity. It is essential \nto emphasize that the courses at the College were works in progress­\nphilosophical-historical expeditions in search of new objects and new \nways of relating to things. The courses can best be seen as exercises, \nnot final performances. \nHis inaugural course was entitled \"The Will to Knowledge\" (p. ll). \nHe promised to explore, \"fragment by fragment,\" the \"morphology of \nthe will to knowledge,\" through alternating historical inquiries and the­\noretical questioning. The first year's course would provide an initial test \nof the place and role played by the will to knowledge in the history of \nthe systems of thought. He began by attempting to clarify a set of dis­\ntinctions: \"between knowledge [savoir] and learning [connaissance]; \nthe differences between the will to knowledge [savoir] and the will to \ntruth [verite]; the position of the subject, or subjects, in relation to that \nwill.\" His reference to \"that will\" is mysterious, given that he has just \ndistinguished two types. Although grammatically the referent is \"the \nwill to truth,\" Foucault immediately turned the course to \"the will \nto knowledge.\"6 \nThis condensation of the two \"wills\" arises in part from the figures \nFoucault chose to compare, Aristotle and Nietzsche, and the manner \nin which he cast the comparison, as exemplars, extreme and opposed \ncases. Foucault interpreted Aristotle as representing the universal and \nnaturalistic pole. For Aristotle, there is an essential pregiven harmony \nbetween sensation, pleasure, knowing, and truth. Our perceptual appa­\nratus is constituted in such a way that it establishes a link of pleasure \nand of (above all visual) knowledge, even when such a link serves no \ndirect utilitarian purpose. The same economy extends all the way up"

He offers \nNietzsche's The Gay Science, on the other hand, as a total contrast to \nAristotle's naturalism. Nietzsche's knowledge (connaissance) is not \nan appropriation of universals but an invention that masks the basest \ninstincts, interests, desires, and fears.7 There is no preestablished \nharmony of these drives and the world-just the contingent, tempo­\nrary, and malicious products of deceitful wills, striving for advantage, \nfighting for survival and engaged in a ceaseless effort to forcefully \nimpose their will on each other. Knowledge is not a natural faculty \nbut a series of struggles, a weapon in the universal war of domination \nand submission. Knowledge is always secondary to those more primary \nstruggles. It is linked not to pleasure in flourishing but harnessed to \nhatred and struggle. Truth is our longest lie, our most intimate ally \nand enemy. \nThe interpretation Foucault gives of both thinkers at this moment, \nbecause it provides such an absolute contrast, does not allow for a fruit­\nful distinction between the will to knowledge and the will to truth. He \nseems to affirm their functional identity in Western history, a distinc­\ntion without a difference. Had Foucault chosen Aristotle's Ethics rather \nthan his Metaphysics as his paradigmatic text, these same relations of \npleasure, knowledge, and the body would have been present, but they \nwould have taken a different form. Over the course of the next decade, \nhe would reexamine the elements of his interpretation of both Aristotle \nand Nietzsche and recombine them differently. Later on Foucault would \nindeed come a good deal closer to posing the relations of pleasure, \nfriendship, and practices of truth as a problem, in a way reminiscent \nof the Ethics, although he would never adopt Aristotle's answers, or \nhis metaphysics. \nThe Move Toward Power \nDuring the early seventies, for reasons his biographers have sought to \nexplain in terms of his personal life, Foucault began to move away from \nthese philosophical themes as well as the project on heredity. Rather, \nhe devoted his courses to material directly related to technologies of \npower. These themes will be treated more fully in Volume Three of this"

In 1975-76, he entitled \nhis course \"Society Must Be Defended\" (p. 59). The course began with \na despondent, almost despairing apology for what he characterized as \nhis thinking's directionless drift. While he had intended to bring the \nwork of recent years to completion in his current lectures, he was at a \nloss on how to do so. He lamented that \"[t]hough these researches were \nvery closely related to each other, they have failed to develop into any \ncontinuous or coherent whole.\"8 This confession seems severe given the \npublication of Discipline and Punish in 1975 and in 1976 The History \nof Sexuality, vol. 1. \nObliged to continue teaching, Foucault decided to take up the ques­\ntion of power relations. According to him, we lacked an adequate under­\nstanding of power as something other than a reflection of economic \nstructures. Two alternatives were available: one that equates mecha­\nnisms of power with repression, another that locates \"the basis of the \nrelationship of power in the hostile engagement of forces .... For con­\nvenience, I shall call this Nietzsche's hypothesis.\"9 The first model, \nassociated with the eighteenth-century philosophes and their precur­\nsors, proceeds from the social contract in which individuals give up \ntheir natural rights to a sovereign in a contractual agreement for peace \nand prosperity. The model contains explicit normative limits; when the \nsovereign extends his power beyond the contractual stipulations, then \nhis use of power can be called oppression. Legitimate power is finite.lO \nIn the contrastive model (the couplet war-domination), power is under­\nstood as a perpetual relationship of force whose only goal is submis­\nsion, the norm of power has no internal limitation: power seeks only \nvictory. \"It is obvious,\" Foucault told his audience, \"that all my work \nin recent years has been couched in terms of\" the second model. How­\never, \"I have been forced to reconsider [it] both because it is insuffi­\ncient\" and because its key notions \"must be considerably modified if \nnot ultimately abandoned.\" This forced reconsideration follows from \nthe conclusion that \"it is wholly inadequate to the analysis of the mech­\nanisms and effects of power that it is so pervasively used to character­\nize today.\" 11 \nA problem was coming into focus. By the end of the year, Foucault \nsubmitted a crisp course summary: \"In order to pursue the concrete \nanalysis of power relations one must abandon the juridical model of \nsovereignty; a model that assumes the individual as the subject of nat-"

Foucault never seriously enter­\ntained a view of the individual as bearer of natural rights. There is an \nanalogy between the figure of the individual endowed with primitive \npowers and the Nietzschean subject Foucault had invoked as the con­\ntrastive and polar opposite to Aristotle in his first year of lectures at the \nCollege. To the extent that the Nietzschean subject had itself been insuf­\nficiently submitted to genealogical scrutiny, it needed to be rethought. \nThe questions Foucault posed in his 1975-76 lectures lend support \nto this reexamination. How and when, Foucault asked, did we mod­\nerns begin to interpret (dechiffrer) power relations as examples of \nwarfare? Is warfare the general model for all social relations? How \ndid an interpretation emerge that viewed the subject as endowed with \nprimitive powers of antagonism, proclivities for war, mutual antago­\nnism? When and where did a historico-political discourse of war sub­\nstitute for a philosophico-juridical discourse of sovereignty? How is \nit that truths came to function as arms? How did it come to be that \nwithin such a discourse, there emerged a subject for whom universal \ntruth and natural law (droit general) came to be seen as illusions or \nsnares? How did this somber, critical, and intensely mythical form of \nself-understanding and practice emerge? Under what conditions did \nthis figure arise who refuses the role of mediator, of neutral arbiter, \na role philosophers have assigned to themselves from Solon to Kant \nto Habermas? How should we analyze a principle of interpretation \nthat proceeds from violence, hatred, passions, revenge, that makes \nbrute givens such as vigor, physique, force, and temperament the \nunderpinnings of thought; that views history as a series of chance \nevents? What has been the trajectory of such a historical discourse \nthat can be advanced both by bearers of aristocratic nostalgia as well \nas popular revenge? Pursuing this line of inquiry would make it pos­\nsible not only to answer the question of how von Clausewitz became \npossible but, more unexpectedly, to pose the question of how Nietzsche \nbecame possible. \nBy the publication of \"The Will to Knowledge\" in 1976, Foucault \nhad reshaped his understanding of power relations. He was also on the \nroad to transforming his understanding of knowledge and the subject. \nFoucault coined the phrase the \"speaker's benefit\" for those who com­\nbined \"a discourse in which sex, the revelation of truth, the overturning \nof global laws, the proclamation of a new day to come, and the prom­\nise of a certain felicity are linked together. \"12 Foucault's sarcasm about"

Although the main target of the speaker's benefit was the reign­\ning militant orthodoxy in France, Foucault was equally looking back \nover a path he himself had traveled. His true problem, he began to \nthink, was \"the subject\" and its relations to the will to truth. \nOver the next four years, Foucault carried out a major recasting and \nconsolidation of his core conceptual tools. The details of this complex \nrethinking will receive extended treatment in the introduction to Vol­\nume Three of this series. Nevertheless, it is again crucial to underline a \ncentral shift in his views on power relations, for it situates the problems \nthat his later thought sought to address. During the courses of the late \nseventies, Foucault further refined his view of power relations. Simply \nand schematically, he concluded: \"It seems to me we must distinguish \nbetween power relations understood as strategic games between liber­\nties-in which some try to control the conduct of others, who in turn \ntry to avoid allowing their conduct to be controlled or try to control the \nconduct of others-and the states of domination that people ordinar­\nily call 'power.' And between the two, between games of power and \nstates of domination, you have technologies of government-under­\nstood, of course, in a very broad sense .... \" To denote this broad under­\nstanding of government, Foucault used the term govern mentality. It \nimplies, he continued, \"the relationship of the self to itself, and ... \n[covers] the range of practices that constitute, define, organize and \ninstrumentalize the strategies which individuals in their freedom can \nuse in dealing with each other. I believe that the concept of govern­\nmentality makes it possible to bring out the freedom of the subject and \nits relationship to others-which constitutes the very stuff [matiere] of \nethics.\" Beginning from this premise, Foucault understands thought as \nthe exercise of freedom. 14 \nSIGNS OF EXISTENCE \nIn 1979, Foucault reviewed The Era of Ruptures by his friend Jean \nDaniel, the editor of a Parisian weekly, Le Nouvel observateur, to \nwhich Foucault had regularly contributed political commentary.

Foucault set \nforth several guiding principles and themes, to which he would return \nincessantly in the remaining years of his life, albeit in different con­\ntexts and using different forms (see, for example, \"What is Enlighten­\nment?\" p. 505). He began by invoking a question posed in 1784 by the \nBerlinische Monatsschrift to a number of leading Aujkliirer, includ­\ning Kant: \"What is Enlightenment?\" The question, as well as Kant's \nresponse, would preoccupy Foucault over the next several years. These \nreflections provided him with a starting point from which to transform \nthe newspaper's question and Kant's answer into a different question­\n\"What is modernity?\"-or, as he posed it in his book review, \"who are \nwe in the present, what is this fragile moment from which we can't \ndetach our identity and which will carry that identity away with itself?\" \nGood journalism required a passion for stalking the elusive singu­\nlarity of the present. More challenging yet was the task of observing \noneself, with a certain distance, in the process of practicing this metier, \nmidst the hurly-burly of everyday events, crises, deadlines, and myr­\niad pressing demands. Foucault was intrigued by the fact that some \njournalists were better suited than philosophers and political activists \nfor the task of sustaining a supple, yet critical, stance in the swirl of \npassing scenes, of resisting the temptation to always have a \"position.\" \nFoucault praised Jean Daniel for his deft handling of this ever-renewed \ndemand on the left to have a firm, well-defended, vantage point for \nanchoring one's analysis. Vantage point, after all, is a military term \nconnoting an overall perspective from afar, the proverbial bird's-eye­\nview-but strategic advantage, however, does not necessarily provide \nunderstanding. For Foucault, in order to establish the right relationship \nto the present-to things, to others, to oneself-one must stay close to \nevents, experience them, be willing to be effected and affected by them. \nFoucault was not singing the praises of vacillation and indecision, or \nof a total refusal of perspective. Banality of thought, resolute oppor­\ntunism, or a program of deconstruction and transgression as ends in \nthemselves all seemed to him to be equally dubious. \"The demand \n[ex(genceJ for an identity,\" he insisted, \"and the injunction to break \nthat identity, both feel, in the same way, abusive.\"16 Such demands are"

He \nsought not so much to resist as to evade this installed dichotomy. One \nmight say he refused the blackmail of having to choose between a uni­\nfied, unchanging identity and a stance of perpetual and obligatory trans­\ngression. \"One's way [faqonJ of no longer remaining the same,\" he \nwrote, \"is, by definition, the most singular part of who I am.\" However, \nthat singularity was never a blanket negation: if one knew in advance \nthat everything, including one's self and the current state of affairs, was \nbad, what would there be to learn? What would be the sense of act­\ning? Why think? A life without the possibility of error would not be \nconceivable. One migHt say, following Georges Canguilhem, such a life \nwould not be alive. . \nWho one is, Foucault wrote, emerges acutely out of the problems \nwith which one struggles. In the review, he phrased his approach in a \nmanner so as to distance it from Sartre and his version of the commit­\nted intellectual: \"Experience with ... rather than engagement in ... \" \nPrivileging experience over engagement makes it increasingly difficult \nto remain \"absolutely in accord with oneself,\" for identities are defined \nby trajectories, not by position taking. Such an attitude is an uncom­\nfortable one insofar as one risks being mistaken and is vulnerable to \nthe perfect hindsight of those who adopt firm positions (especially after \nevents have passed) or who speak assuredly of universals as though the \nsingular were secondary. To that extent, one could say, adopting a dis­\ntinction Foucault developed in his work leading up to the second vol­\nume of The History of Sexuality, The Uses of Pleasure, that this attitude \nis rooted in an ethics and not a morality, a practice rather than a van­\ntage point, an active experience rather than a passive waiting. \nThe challenge is not to replace one certitude (evidence) with another \nbut to cultivate an attention to the conditions under which things become \n\"evident,\" ceasing to be objects of our attention and therefore seem­\ningly fixed, necessary, and unchangeable. A few pages later in the \nreview, Foucault approvingly invoked Maurice Merleau-Ponty's defini­\ntion of the task of philosophy, \"to never consent to be completely at ease \nwith what seems evident to oneself.\" What seems so new, if we are \nattentive, often can be seen to have been around, at the back of our \nminds, at the corner of our vision, at the edge of things we almost, but \nnever quite, saw or said. \"The most fragile of passing moments has its \nantecedents. There is a whole ethics of an alert certitude [evidence]"

Quite the contrary, \nhe insisted: it is a propitious time. \"There is an overabundance of things \nto be known: fundamental, terrible, wonderful, funny, insignificant, and \ncrucial at the same time. And there is an enormous curiosity, a need, \na desire to know .... Curiosity is seen as futility. However, ... it evokes \n\"care\"; it evokes the care one takes of what exists and what might exist; \na sharpened sense of reality, but one that is never immobilized before \nit; a readiness to find what surrounds us strange and odd; a certain \ndetermination to throw off familiar ways of thought and to look at the \nsame things in a different way; a passion for seizing what is happen­\ning now and what is disappearing; a lack of respect for traditional hier­\narchies of what is important and fundamental. I dream of a new age \nof curiosity. We have the technical means; the desire is there; there is \nan infinity of things to know; the people capable of doing such work \nexist\" (p. 521). Curiosity: a simple little thing. \nAt this time, one of Foucault's cherished projects was to create a \ndifferent kind of publishing in France. After Editions Gallimard, the \nprestigious house that published his major books in huge print runs, \nrefused his offer to edit a small series of books, Foucault (along with \nPaul Veyne and Fran<;;ois Wahl) succeeded in convincing another dis­\ntinguished Parisian publisher, Les Editions du Seuil, to initiate a series \nentitled \"Works\" (Des Travaux). The purpose of the series was to \n/ publish works that might be considered too long and difficult-hence \nlacking an immediate audience-but that over time would show their \nimportance, short pieces outlining the main points of future work to \nbe developed over time, and translations of important foreign works \nwith no large market in France. Foucault and friends provided a trench­\nant definition of \"work\" as \"that which is susceptible of introducing a \nmeaningful difference in the field of knowledge, albeit with a certain \ndemand placed on the author and reader, but with the eventual rec­\nompense of a certain pleasure, that is to say of an access to another \nfigure of truth. \"18 \nArenas: Iran, Poland, USA \n\"Where are we today?\" Foucault asked his readers to ask themselves in \n1979.19 At a moment of the globalization ofthe economy? \"Certainly.\" At \na moment of global geopolitics as well.

It seemed to him that the answer was \nno: he discerned no indications of an emergent universal philosophy \nor political consciousness. In France, in his view, this contradictory \nconjuncture had yielded a stifling combination of ever-more empty \nrhetorical allegiance to the receding utopia of a universal revolution, \naccompanied by a pervasive social conservatism. How then, to \"tear \noneself away from\" that predicament? His almost vis~eral rejection of \nFrench bourgeois moeurs was a long-standing one that he shared with \nother French writers he admired, such as Flaubert. A young Canadian \ninterviewer's assertion that France held an enduring attraction for \nNorth Americans elicited this retort: \"Yes, but now I don't think they \ncome to Paris any longer for freedom. They come to have a taste of an \nold traditional culture. They come to France as painters went to Italy \nin the seventeenth century, to see a dying civilization\" (p. 163). That \nis why, he explained, he had lived in Sweden, in Poland, in Germany, \nin Tunisia, and in the United States and had made repeated trips to \nBrazil and Japan. \nDuring the late seventies and early eighties, Foucault's main areas \nof political and social activity were outside France. He went to Iran for \nan Italian newspaper as an eyewitness to the period leading up to the \nfall of the Shah and the triumph of the Khomeini regime. Surely he \nhad in mind a maxim he had applied approvingly to Jean Daniel's \nwork, that of not giving \"our unhesitant support [confiance] to any rev­\nolution, even if one can understand each revolt. \"20 He was fascinated \nby the type of political action taking place, the massive presence of an \nunderarmed populace in the streets facing a police force and army \namong the world's most brutal and omnipresent. A revolution was tak­\ning place, but it was one that made the European Left uneasy. It was \nhard to identify class dynamics, social divisions, a vanguard party, or \npolitical ideology as the driving force; these \"lacks\" intrigued Foucault. \nHe was intrigued by the question of the role of religion in political life, \nof the unexpected and resurgent role it was playing. He reminded his \nEuropean readers that the sentence . preceding Marx's famous phrase \nabout religion being the opium of the people, spoke of \"the spirit of a \nworld without spirit.\" He saw or felt-or thought he saw-hints of such \na spirit, and of a possible role it might have in forming the self in a \ndifferent relationship to politics. \nFoucault mused that until his visit to Iran he had only read about \nthe collective will.

He wondered \nwhat to make of \"the vocabulary, the ceremonial, the timeless drama \ninto which one could fit the historical drama of a people that pitted its \nvery existence against that of the sovereign. \"21 Foucault was fascinated, \nperhaps above all, by what he saw as a demand for a new subjectivity. \nHe felt he discerned an imperative that went beyond overthrowing yet \nanother corrupt, Western-supported authoritarian regime, an impera­\ntive he formulated thus: \"above all we have to change ourselves. Our way \nof being, our relationships with others, with things, with eternity, with \nGod. \"22 He grappled with this intuition, repeating a similar hypothe­\nsis on several occasions. \"What is the meaning for these people, to seek \nout, at the price of their lives, that thing whose very possibility we Euro­\npeans have forgotten at least since the Renaissance and the period of \nthe great crises of Christianity-a spirituality. I can hear the French \nlaughing at these words, but they are making a mistake.\"23 Foucault \nintended to examine this issue of political spirituality and its changing \nrelationships with self-fashioning as soon as he finished the seemingly \ninterminable rewriting of the \"Greek and Christian books.\" In the early \neighties, he proposed a two-pronged research project with colleagues \nand students at Berkeley-on political spirituality and self-fashioning \nin the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and the arts of socialist govern­\nmentality in the twenties. \nThe latter project was linked to a dialogue he had undertaken with \nrepresentatives of the main noncommunist labor union, the Confede­\nration Franc;;aise des Travailleurs Democratique (CFDT), on such mat­\nters as the future of the social security system. He was intrigued by the \nspirit of the seemingly futile efforts of Solidarity in Poland, which he \nactively supported and with whom the CFDT forged close ties. Foucault \nwent to Poland on a number of occasions, not just to meet and discuss \nthe situation with various participants but to seek out rather humble \nwork as a bookkeeper. When mmtiallaw was imposed in December \n1981, France's Socialist government made only perfunctory protests. \nFoucault, like many others, took to the streets. And as Iran faded from \nWestern public attention, and Poland endured in the gray night of mar­\ntial law, Foucault seriously considered working anonymously with the \nhumanitarian group Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Bor­\nders), or of retiring to the countryside to practice spiritual exercises and \ntend his garden. Although he did not pursue either of these escape fan­\ntasies, his increasing preoccupation with the theme of \"the care of the"

Until the late seventies, he had been openly, if discreetly, homo­\nsexual in the then current French style.z4 In the context of his work on \nthe care of the self, though, he began to rethink publicly homosexual and \nhomosocial relationships, embarking on a distinctive series of explo­\nrations and reflections on emergent forms of pleasure, sociality, and \nthought. In California, his explorations and reflections on gay life in \nSan Francisco are well known; less has been made of the fact that, \nwhen in California, he spent his days at the University of California in \nBerkeley, working in the libraries, talking with colleagues, holding sem­\ninars, and meeting students. It seems fair to say that Foucault was \nexperimenting in his own life with the twin imperatives to \"know thy­\nself\" and to \"care for thyself.\" \nA MODERN ETHOS \nMax Weber, Foucault argued, had placed the following question on the \nhistorical, sociological, and ethical agenda: \"If one wants to behave \nrationally and regulate one's action according to true principles, what \npart of one's self should one renounce? What is the ascetic price of rea­\nson?\" He continued, \"For my part, I have posed the opposite question: \nHow have certain kinds of interdictions become the price required for \nattaining certain kinds of knowledge [savoir] about oneself? What must \none know [connaitre] about oneself in order to be willing to accept such \nrenunciation?\" The latter formulation is a guiding thread in Foucault's \nhistorical work in the second and third volumes of The History if Sex­\nuality, as well as in the unpublished fourth volume, Confessions of the \nFlesh. Despite his reformulation of Weber's question, Foucault's core \nconcern applies equally well to Foucault himself-what is the place of \nasceticism in a philosophic life? If asceticism is taken as \"exercise\" and \nnot as renunciation (and this is precisely how Foucault takes it up in \nhis later work), then the question becomes: How is reason exercised? \nHow is reason practiced? \nOne of the main themes Foucault explored in the early eighties was \n\"the care of the self.\" The nearly complete uncoupling of this impera­\ntive from its twin, \"know yourself,\" is an essential element of his diag­\nnosis of modernity, in which the latter imperative was gradually to"

From Descartes to Husserl, \nthe imperative to \"know thyself\" increasingly predominated over that to \n\"take care of thyself.\" As the \"care of the self\" had traditionally passed \nthrough or entailed relationships with others, this disproportionate \nweighting of knowledge has contributed to the \"universal unbrotherli­\nness\" that caused Weber so much pain and which he lacked the tools to \ndo more than decry. For Foucault the equation of philosophical askesis \nwith renunciation of feeling, solidarity, and care for one's self and for \nothers-as the price of knowledge-was one of our biggest wrong turn­\nings. However, reversing such a course is not merely a matter of will­\ning or desiring it to be otherwise. What could be more self-delusional \nthan the recent heralding of a reenchantment of the world, or that we \nhave actually never been modem? As this trajectory became clearer to \nhim, Foucault aimed at rethinking this separation. Rather than seek to \nforce a reconciliation, he focused on whether the \"universal unbroth­\nerliness\" produced by the will to knowledge, which had previously \nseemed like a necessary component of modernity-the price to be paid \nfor knowledge and ethics-might well be more contingent than Weber \nhad thought. He began thinking his way around this culturally coher­\nent but humanly intolerable outcome by radically recasting what Weber \nwould have called \"a vocation\"-something that Foucault called an \n\"ethics\" understood as an ethos. \nCare of the Self \nIn an interview published as \"The Ethic of the Concern for the Self as \na Practice of Freedom\" (p. 281), Foucault provides an unusually unqual­\nified formulation of his philosophical and ethical work. He reiterates \nthat his project has always been to untangle the relations between the \nsubject and truth. Although his argument is not presented as a set of \nworking premises, it is convenient and plausible to view it this way. \nPremise one: \"what is ethics, if not the practice of liberty, the consid­\nered [rijlechie] practice of liberty\" (p. 281). \"Freedom is the ontologi­\ncal condition of ethics. But ethics is the considered fonn that freedom \ntakes\" (p. 281). Thus, a condition of liberty is the ontological starting \npoint. Premise two: In the Western tradition, \"taking care of oneself \nrequires knowing [connaitre] oneself\" (p. 281). \"To take care of the self \nis to equip oneself with these truths\" (p. 281). It is through these tools \nand this conceptual linkage that \"ethics is linked to the game of the"

Hence, the problem \nis to give \"liberty the form of an ethos\" (p. 281). Premise four: the sub­\nject \"is not a substance. It is a form, and this form is not primarily or \nalways identical to itself\" (p. 281). \"Self\" is a reflexive pronoun, and \nit has two meanings. Auto means \"the same,\" but it also conveys the \nnotion of identity. The latter meaning shifts the question from \"What \nis this self?\" to \"What is the foundation on which I shall find my iden­\ntity?\" (p. 281). Premisefive: The central arena of inquiry is the histori­\ncal constitution of these forms and their relation to \"games of truth.\" \n\"A game of truth is a set of procedures that lead to a certain result, \nwhich, on the basis of its principles and rules of procedures, may be \nconsidered valid or invalid\" (p. 281). \"[W]hy truth? ... And why must \nthe care of the self occur only through the concern for truth? [This is] \nthe question for the West. How did it come about that all of Western \nculture began to revolve around this obligation of truth ... ?\" (p. 281). \nGiven these premises, one must conclude equally that \"one escaped \nfrom a domination of truth\" only by playing that game differently \n(p. 281). Premise sir: \"the relationship between philosophy and poli­\ntics is permanent and fundamental\" (p. 281). By \"politics\" Foucault \nmeans both power relations and the life of the city as understood in \nthe ancient world, the modern equivalent being \"governmentality.\" \nPremise seven: Philosophy, understood as a practice and a problem, \nis a vocation. The manner in which liberty is taken up by the philos­\nopher is distinctive, differing in intensity and zeal from other free \ncitizens (p. 281). \nSince the Enlightenment, while demand for an ethics has been in­\ncessant, the philosophical fulfillment of that demand has been notably \nscarce. This impasse has led to many fundamentalist projects, none of \nwhich has achieved any general acceptance, even among the philoso­\nphers and moralists. Such a meager harvest has also led to the cate­\ngorical or partial rejection of such projects. Foucault himself argued in \nThe Order of Things that there could be no moral system in moder­\nnity, if by \"moral system\" one meant a philosophical anthropology that \nproduced firm foundations concerning the nature of Man and, thereby, \na basis for human action. Ultimately, though, Foucault may well be \nremembered as one of the major ethical thinkers of modernity. \nFoucault sets up two \"ideal\" types of moral systems: one that empha­\nsizes the moral code, and another that emphasizes ethical practices."

In the second ideal-typical form, which Foucault \nassociated with the ancient world, it is the \"mode of subjectivation\"­\nthe way a subject freely relates to himself-that receives greater elab­\noration. In this type of system, the codes and explicit rules of behavior \nmay be rudimentary, while greater attention is paid to the methods, \ntechniques, and exercises directed at forming the self within a nexus \nof relationships. In such a system, authority would be self-referential \nand might take a therapeutic or philosophical form. He stressed that, in \npractice, these forms were not wholly distinct-subject-oriented prac­\ntices have been widespread in Christianity, just as there were moral \nprohibitions in the ethical practices of the ancient world. Nonetheless, \nthe contrast is an instructive one. \nIn Volumes Two and Three of The History of Sexuality, Foucault \nundertook a restorative historical analysis of the place of the self­\nformation as an \"ethical subject\" in the ancient world. He describes \nthis process as one in which \"the individual delimits that part of him­\nself that will form the object of his moral practice, defines his position \nrelative to the precept that he will follow, and decides on a certain \nmode of being that will serve his moral goal. \"26 His goal in this analy­\nsis was not to \"return\" to some archaic mode of social order but, rather, \nto make visible a bygone way of approaching the self and others which \nmight suggest possibilities for the present. He was seeking not to denat­\nuralize the \"subject of desire,\" not to invent a philosophic system per \nse, but to contribute to a mode of living. He thought that elements of \nthat possible mode of living were already in existence: he sought to \nlearn from and strengthen these, not to discover or \"invent\" others. In \nthat spirit, it seems worthwhile to tum his ethical categories onto his \nown thought-something he himself did not do-in order to identity \nand illuminate his singular enterprise. \nThe Ethical Fouifold \nFoucault saw ethical analysis as the free relationship to the self (rap­\nport a sOl)-a relationship that could be examined through four basic \ncategories: ethical substance, mode of subjectivation, ethical work, and \ntelos.

In his genealogy of the subject of \ndesire, he gives us historical examples of how such an analytics of eth­\nics had been elaborated, of the internal systematicity, and of the differ­\nential mode of alteration over time. His goal in these historical analyses \nwas to loosen the grip of our self-understanding as \"subjects of desire,\" \nso as to make possible a different relationship to our thought, ourselves \nand others, as well as to our pleasures. \nHowever, as he was wont to say, there is more. What if one was \nundertaking not only a history of sexuality but also a genealogy of eth­\nics? How, then, would one cast the analytics of a free relationship to \nthe self that a life of thinking entailed? In an interview in Berkeley \n(\"On the Genealogy of Ethics,\" p. 253), he was asked why he was not \nintending to talk more about friendship in his forthcoming books. He \nresponded, \"don't forget L'Usage des plaisirs is a book about sexual eth­\nics; it's not a book about love, or about friendship, or about reciproc­\nity .... Friendship is reciprocal and sexual relations are not reciprocal\" \n(p. 253). \"What I want to ask is: Are we able to have an ethics of acts \nand their pleasures which would be able to take into account the plea­\nsure of the other?\" (p. 253). \nThere are two important points here. First, Foucault makes it clear \nthat the content of the ethical discussion he provides in Volumes Two \nand Three of The History of Sexuality follow from the subject matter \nunder discussion. As we shall see, the general categories of ethics he \nprovides can be elaborated differently in the context of a different gene­\nalogy. At the end of the Archaeology cif Knowledge, he stated that it \nwould have been perfectly possible to construct other archaeologies of \nother objects, and that he was never talking about the spirit of an age \nor a unified understanding of being. Second, he is very clear that he is \nnot advocating a \"return\" to the Greek model of sexual or human rela­\ntions. Ancient Greek society was characterized by essential inequalities \nand nonreciprocities that modems can only find intolerable. Conse­\nquently, what he identifies in the ancient world is a problematic, a \nway of thinking about ethical issues, and a form of practice-askesis­\nintegrally linked to that thought. \nIt should be stressed again, though, that when in 1984 Foucault was \nasked if he found the ancient Greeks admirable, he answered: \"Not \nvery ....

The way that the \nindividual has to constitute this or that part of himself as the prime \nmaterial if his moral conduct- Foucault 28 \nFor Foucault as a thinker, the ethical substance, the prime material \nof moral conduct, is the \"will to truth.\" As we have seen, in the course \nsummary of his first year at the College, he summarized his comparison \nbetween Aristotle and Nietzsche, discussed archaic practices of estab­\nlishing the truth in the context of justice, and elucidated the general \ngoal of his work. The primary, perhaps ultimate, task he had set for \nhimself was to establish \"the distinction between the will to knowledge \n[savoir] and the will to truth [verite]; the position of the subject and sub­\njects in relation to this will\" (p. n). The lion's share of Foucault's work \ncentered on \"[t]he historical analysis of this rancorous will to knowl­\nedge. \"29 He did not abandon his attention to the dangers of knowledge­\npower complexes, even as he cautiously moved away from a central \nfocus on the \"will to knowledge.\" He categorically refused appeals to \n\"science, religion, or law\" as the basis upon which a free person could \nshape his life. For him, whatever we were to become, it could not be \nlegitimated by the will to knowledge. Still, of the will to truth he said \nvery, very little. In his 1971 essay, \"Nietzsche, Genealogy, History,\" he \noffered an utterly bleak picture of modernity: \"[T]he will to truth ..."

(p. 253) \nFor Foucault, the challenge of the mode of subjectivation is not to base \none's subjectivity, that multidimensional relationship (to others, to \nthings, and to ourselves) on any science, nor on any previously estab­\nlished doctrine. In \"What is Enlightenment?\" he wrote: \"I wonder \nwhether we may not envisage modernity as an attitude rather than as \na period of history. And by 'attitude,' I mean a mode of relating to con­\ntemporary reality; a voluntary choice made by certain people; in the \nend, a way of thinking and feeling; a way, too, of acting and behaving \nthat at one and the same time marks a relation of belonging and pres­\nents itself as a task\" (p. 303). This \"belonging\" is relation to thesoci­\nety in its historical and political determinations, with its embedded and \nembodied strictures, its sedimented orders of thought. The \"task\" is \nto determine what must be shown to be contingent, and what can be \nshown to be truly singular in the present. An essential aspect of doing \nthis work is to take up a stylized relationship to things, to oneself, and \nto others. The question is, What form should such a relationship take? \nIn \"What is Enlightenment?\" Foucault presents two exemplary \nmodes of subjectivation, one personified by Kant, the other by Baude­\nlaire. Kant took up this question in an original way, by transforming it \nfrom an issue of epochs or of pure reason into a question of the thinker's \nrelationship to the present-to temporality understood as memory.37 \nFoucault restates Kant's question thus: \"What difference does today \nintroduce with respect to yesterday?\" (p. 303). What difference does \nthe present make to our thinking? For Kant, addressing this question \nput one on the road from an \"immature\" state marked by a lack of \nthought, or reflection upon dependency toward \"maturity.\" Kant prob­\nlematized the relationship between the will, authority, and reason. For \nhim, thinking about the relationship of these terms was not only a pro­\ncess but, equally, a task and an obligation. We are responsible for our \nown maturity. Consequently, it is through the obligation to work on \nourselves that we may discover the way to a proper relationship to the \nEnlightenment-we will \"dare to know.\" Kant proposed a political con­\ntract with the \"rational despot\" Frederick II: an exchange of political"

However, this con­\ntract was not something Foucault was willing to endorse. \nBaudelaire also privileged a particular relationship to temporality­\ncharacterized by keen attentiveness to the passing moment. However, \nhe transformed the Enlightenment attitude into one of \"modernity.\" \nIn his now-classic manifesto, The Painter of Modern Life, Baudelaire \nidentified the modern artist's challenge as one of seizing the eternal \nwithin the \"contingent, fleeting, volatile\" present. What he sought \nwas not behind or beyond the present but within it. The artist had not \nmerely to observe the carnival parading in front of him with the disin­\nterested, ironic, blase attitude of the jllmeur but rather to heroize the \npresent by \"taking hold\" (prendre) of it. For Baudelaire, the artist has \n\"no right to despise the present\"; hence, it is his business-through \nan act of will-to seize hold of it. \nThis is only half the story, though. The point of seizing hold of the \npresent is to transfigure it. As Foucault understands it, Baudelaire's \n\"transfiguration entails not the annulling of reality but a difficult inter­\nplay between the truth of what is real and the exercise of freedom\" \n(p. 303). Transfiguration is not transgression; transgression is a word \nFoucault does not employ in his later work. 38 Rather, Foucault sought \nin Baudelaire the means to invent a different attitude toward the world \nand the self, one more respectful and ultimately more difficult to \nachieve. Just as he drew from Kant an attention to the historical sin­\ngularity of reason as a practice, so, in a parallel way-and one closer \nto the original text he was interpreting-he drew from Baudelaire a \nstylization of the self as an exercise \"in which extreme attention to what \nis real is confronted with the practice of a liberty that simultaneously \nrespects this reality and violates it\" (p. 303). \nBaudelaire gives form to the self in art. He never imagined, Foucault \ninsists, that such stylization could operate on \"society itself or on the \nbody politic\" (p. 303). Foucault proposes a stylization of the practices and \nexercises of the self taken as an attitude-a relationship-that clearly \ndraws from the models of Kant and Baudelaire. However,\\ unlike Kant, \nFoucault does not accept social and political conformity as the trade­\noff for freedom of thought; equally, he refuses Baudelaire's restriction \nof a modern ethos to the arena of art~ Rather, Foucault hopes to invent \na mode of subjectivation in which this ethos would be a practice of \nthought formed in direct contact with social and political realities. \"Yet \nif we are not to settle for the affirmation or the empty dream of free-"

Not surprisingly, he differentiated his approach from phe­\nnomenological or existential approaches based on the subject and its \n\"primary experience.\" Rather, Foucault located experience (and the \nsubject) within a complex site comprising \"a domain of knowledge \n[savoir], a type of normativity, and a mode of relation to the self.\" \nThus, he addressed experience as a historical product that emerges \nwithin a \"field of knowledge [connaissance] ... a collection of social \nrules ... and a mode of relation between the individual and himself.\" \nFoucault identified this overall project as a nominalist philosophic an­\nthropology, explicitly rejecting any basis in pregiven essence or nature. \nWithout rejecting the possibility that some such constants can be found, \nhe interprets experiences, such as those of sexuality, within the par­\nticular historical fields that shaped them, to which they were in part a \nreaction, and which both created and limited the form those experi­\nences could take at a given historical moment. \nMany analytical, political, and ethical problems could be developed \nfrom this nominalist understanding of experience, thought, and the \nsubject. Foucault made this constellation the privileged domain of the \nhistory of thought. To do so, he provides a rich, if idiosyncratic defini­\ntion of \"thought\": \"By 'thought,' I mean what establishes, in a variety \nof possible forms, the play of true and false, and consequently consti­\ntutes the human being as a knowing subject [connaissance] ... as social \nand juridical subjects ... and as an ethical subject.\" This definition estab­\nlishes a terrain for the history of thought which is far broader than the \nhistory of scientific disciplines or philosophic systems. It posits all forms \nof experience as potential objects of thought, and thus of the history \nof thought. The task of the history of thought is to identify and delimit \nthe development and transformation of these domains of experience; \nas these domains and these experiences are diverse, it follows that so, \ntoo, are modes of thought. \nFoucault's definition of thought as a modem practice is so broad that \nit comes close to equating thought not only with experience but with"

Since thought is \na defining aspect of any historically singular complex-a vital aspect \nof its singularity-an analysis of such complexes is always possible for \na history of thought. But that does not mean that thought (or power \nrelations, which are also an unsurpassable part of such historical sin­\ngularities) is totally coextensive with the object of analysis.

As a thinker, \nthe work Foucault performs \"to transform himself into an ethical sub­\nject of one's behavior\" is a distinctive form of intellectual practice, a \nsingular form of critical thought. He writes: criticism is \"a historical \ninvestigation into the events that have led us to constitute ourselves \nand to recognize ourselves as subjects of what we are doing, thinking, \nsaying.

That is why it is both potentially and obligatorily-pouvant \net devant-available for thought. As Foucault insisted, thought does not \nreside in the practices giving them their meaning; it is always a prac­\ntice of freedom that could have taken (or could take in the future) a dif­\nferent form. Problematizations and practices can and must be thought \nvis-a.-vis experience insofar as they concern our freedom. Ethical work \nmakes them available in that form. \nIn an interview entided \"Friendship as a way of life,\" Foucault presents \na quasi manifesto of what he sees as his own ethical task, cast as the \nwork of thought, pleasure, and invention. Interviewed by several young \nFrench editors of a gay journal Gai pied, he is especially crisp in his \nformulations, speaking as a member of the community. The problem \nfor gays now, he told his young interviewers, was not to uncover the \ntruth of homosexual desire but to make homosexuality desirable; \"Sex \nis not a fatality; it's a possibility for creative life\" (p. 135). The search \nshould be not for the secret of one's identity but for how to invent new \nmodes of relationship and a new way of life. How, that is, to become \nhomosexual rather than affirming that one already is so. \"I am not sure \nwe should create our own culture. We have to create a culture\" (p. 135). \nCould such a quest lead to a way of life not based on social class and \nother existing divisions? One that could be shared among individuals \nof different ages, statuses, and so on? One that could \"reopen affec­\ntive and relational virtualities\" and invent \"the instruments for poly­\nmorphic, varied, and individually modulated relationships\" (p. 135)? \nHe thought this was possible; what needed to be problematized was the \nwhole tissue of sociality.

Ascesis is \"the work that one \nperforms on oneself in order to transform oneself or make the self \nappear which, happily, one never attains. Can that be our problem \ntoday?\" (p. 135). To make the self a continuous creative task, a social \nexperience? For gays, the problem might be how \"to make ourselves \ninfinitely more susceptible to pleasure [plaisirs]. We must escape and \nhelp others to escape the two readymade formulas of the pure sexual \nencounter and the lovers' fusion of identities\" (p. 135). Or, he asked \nin the same interview, \"What is friendship?\" His answer: \"the sum of \nall those things through which [people] can reciprocally give each other \npleasure\" (p. 135). A provocative answer, no doubt, but what he means \nby pleasure is not very well spelled out. A few things, however, can be \nsaid about his use of the term. First, he is opposing pleasure to desire, \nas surface to depth, as the body to the person. He is seeking to break \nopen the equation of the forms of pleasure one enjoys and one's sup­\nposed identity. Second, his attention to pleasure does not entail embrac­\ning the doctrine of hedonism: pleasure is neither the unique nor the \nhighest good but, rather, an accompaniment to other activities. Fou­\ncault's pleasure is embedded in a practice, an askesis. One might say, \nit supervenes on other practices. For him, pleasure seems to function \nas a kind of ethical heuristic, in the sense that he suggests that where \none encounters pleasures, one will be in the vicinity of experiences wor­\nthy of further reflection, experimentation, and reformulation. 42 \nIn another interview for a gay audience, Foucault insisted that gays \nshould not privilege the model of individual rights or heterosexual mar­\nriage (that is, rights to inheritance and so on). As important as the \nstruggles to obtain basic rights and legal protections for homosexuality \nwere, Foucault argued, the real target was the general impoverishment \nof social relationships in contemporary society. Instead of treating the \ntask as one of normalizing homosexuality in the heterosexual model, \nhe urged his readers to try to invent something else. Such work, while \narising within gay relationships, might be partially transposable to oth­\ners, albeit with some imagination and tenacity.

The difficulties of finding a correct translation for the \nphrase indicates some of the ambiguities that surround it. A falsely lit­\neral translation would be \"to untake oneself, oneself\"; but not only is \nthis phrasing alien to English (and French), but if the goal were to \n\"untake\" oneself, how exactly had one previously \"taken\" (prendre) \noneself? What self had one taken? And who had been doing the tak­\ning? The dictionary translation of se de prendre is to \"free oneself,\"44 \nwhich captures the dimension of releasing oneself from a material \nentanglement. But \"to free\" obviously carries inappropriate philosophic \nbaggage, for it implies a preexistent, essential, or true self already there \nto be freed. Another possibility might be \"detaching oneself from one \nself.\" Although \"detachment\" can suggest (as it does for the Stoics) an \nemotional distancing from the things of the world, in English the phrase \nconnotes an affectless noninvolvement. And, in fact, Foucault is pointing \nto a certain self-distancing, and he advocated an exercise of detaching \nand examining parts that need to be cared for and ultimately repaired \nor replaced. Thus, the most adequate (or least inadequate) rendering \nmight well be \"to disassemble the self, oneself\" -a phrasing that high­\nlights the material and relational aspects of this exercise, and intro­\nduces a notion of the self as a form-giving practice that operates with \nand upon heterogeneous parts and forms available at a given point \nin history. \nFoucault reiterated that the goal~the mode of being-of ethics, as \nhistorically constrained, practical assembly and disassembly, when he \nasked: \"But what then is philosophy-philosophical activity I mean-if \nit is not the critical work that thought brings to bear on itself?

I would like it to be an elaboration of the self by the self, a stu­\ndious transformation, a slow and arduous transformation through a \nconstant care for the truth. \"47 Of course, the constant focus on the self, \nthe care for the truth, and its reflectiveness separates Foucault's ethics \nfrom the cultural constructions of the handyman. \nBut if we can indicate the way in which this activity should be en­\ngaged, the question of why we should do so remains. If Foucault was \nstingy in his explanations of the place and meaning of the \"will to \ntruth,\" he is only slightly more generous in providing material about \nthe telos of his own thinking. There are, however, some scattered and \nsuggestive indications.

A. M. Sheridan Smith [New York: Pantheon, 1972]) and The Order if Things \n(trans. Alan Sheridan [New York: Pantheon, 1976]), both of which preceded his nomination and \nelection to the College de France. At the time of his lectures at the College, he was finishing \n\"Nietzsche, Genealogy, History\" (in The Foucault Reader, Rabinow, ed. [New York: Pantheon, \n1984]), an important statement of his understanding of these topics. \n5 Foucault, \"The Order of Discourse,\" trans. Ruper Swyer, appendix to The Archaeology if Knowl­\nedge (New York: Pantheon, 1972), p. 229. \n4 Idem. \n5 Ibid., p. 217. \n6 His use of savoir and connaissance also seems to be inconsistent in this text. \n7 Again, Foucault at times distinguishes between savoir and connaissance, but he seems not to \ndo so with any great consistency. \n8 Foucault, \"Two Lectures,\" in Colin Gordon, ed., Power/Knowledge (New York: Pantheon, 1972), \nP·78. \n9 Ibid., p. 91. \n10 Idem.

A few were originally published in English. ,Sev­\neral others have already been translated into English. The majority, \nhowever, appear in English here for the first time. The last category, \nwhich includes all the course summaries, and \"Self Writing\" are due \nto Robert Hurley, a distinguished translator of twentieth-century French \nsocial thought and the translator in particular of the second and third \nvolumes of Foucault's History if Sexuality. \nAs a matter of principle, the editorial hand has been exercised lightly. \nTexts originally in English are accordingly subject to mechanical, but \nonly to the most compelling stylistic, emendations. Translations are \nanother, and more complex, matter. With only a few exceptions, extant \ntranslations have proved to be of sufficient quality to merit reprinting. \nEven so, they vary in any number of ways with their translators. Even \nthe most polished of translations is, moreover, far from timeless. Cer­\ntain words and phrases become standard at the cost that others become \nmisleading or seem strange. Certain early words or phrases, certain \nearly lexical distinctions emerge as crucial only in the light of the later \noeuvre. Initially unexceptionable glosses emerge as controversial only \nin the light of retrospective discussion and debate. \nJames Faubion's review of the available translations was undertaken \nwith such problems in mind. His emendations are of several different \nsorts. The first sort seeks to highlight or clarify Foucault's usage by \ninserting French terms in brackets after their English glosses (when the \ntranslator has not himself or herself inserted them). Such terms are rel­\natively rare, but worth noting in advance. One is epistime. It appears \nin English as \"episteme\"-an inevitable coinage, but a misleading one \ninsofar as it conjures associations with such apparent cognates as \"pho­\nneme\" or \"lexeme.\" Epistime is rather a transliteration of the Greek \nem crn'lpn, \"science\" or \"systematic understanding\" of a conceptual \ndomain, or of an art or craft. The least troublesome of them is savoir, \nwhich can usually be glossed straightforwardly as \"knowledge\" (or in \nits verbal form, \"to know\"). Much more troublesome is connaissance \nand its related verb connaltre. Connaissance can also frequently be"

English has no consistent way of \nregistering the difference between that sort of knowledge that derives \nfrom \"acquaintance\" or familiarity with someone or something (connais­\nsance) and that which is, or may be, purely \"theoretical\" or abstract \n(savoir). The lack of a register is all the more troublesome because \nFoucault's usage sometimes suggests that the distinction between con­\nnaissance and savoir is analytically pivotal. A more extended discussion \nof the distinction must, however, be reserved for Faubion's introduc­\ntion to the second volume of the series. \nFaubion has also undertaken a variety of more direct editorial inter­\nventions, more or fewer from one available translation to the next. In \nsome cases, he corrects what seems to be an obvious error. In many \nothers, however, he merely seeks to render more literally or more to \nthe letter what the translator has rendered more freely or inventively. \nIn general, his corrections have the purpose of clarifying the semantic \ncontent-in some cases, the semantic ambiguity-of assertions that \nallow of diverse English representations. In a few cases, he has ap­\npended footnotes (marked by lower-case Roman letters) that elaborate \nupon the context of some remark or allusion. Finally, he has standard­\nized the gloss and the spelling of a few words and phrases that take \non special thematic significance as Foucault's thought unfolds. Foucault \nhimself sometimes writes of problimisation, sometimes of problimati­\nsation, but with no alteration of meaning from one instance to the next. \nTranslations preserve the variation in English. In this volume, however, \nwe render both terms throughout as problematization (after problem­\natic). Especially in early translations, asujettissement is often brought \ninto English as \"subjugation,\" and its related verb, asujettir, as \"to sub­\njugate.\" Here, however, we opt for a neologism that signals Foucault's \ntechnical, and more positive, usage. Hence, asujettissement consistently \nappears as \"subjectivation\"; and asujettir, as \"to subjectify.\" Le souci \nde soi might be-and has been-translated into English as \"concern \nfor\" or \"concern with the self,\" or as \"self-concern.\" In this volume, \nhowever, it has consistently been rendered as \"the care of the self.\" \nFaubion has made virtually no changes to Robert Hurley'S own trans­\nlations. He was, however, able to review a draft of those translations, \nand to provide a list of questions and annotations that Hurley consid­\nered in the course of making revisions. Hurley reciprocally provided \nFaubion with linguistic analyses and editorial advice. It is hoped that"

A knowledge \nof this sort is manifested, of course, in the medical theories that name \nand classify the different pathological types and attempt to explain \nthem; one also sees it appearing in phenomena of opinion-in that old \nfear which madmen give rise to, in the operation of the credulities that \nsurround them, in the way they are depicted in the theater or in liter­\nature. Here and there, analyses done by historians could serve me as \nguides. Yet one dimension appeared to be unexplored: I needed to try \nto discover how the mad were recognized, set apart, excluded from \nsociety, interned, and treated; what institutions were assigned to re­\nceive and hold them-care for them at times; what authorities decided \nabout their madness, and according to what criteria; what methods \nwere employed to constrain them, punish them, or cure them; in short, \nin what network of institutions and practices the madman was both \nenmeshed and defined. Now, this network appears very coherent and \nwell adapted to its purpose when one looks at its functioning and the \njustifications it was given at the time: a whole exact and articulated \nknowledge was involved in it. So an object took shape for me: the knowl­\nedge invested in complex institutional systems.

Subjectivity and Truth \nArchives Nationales that I undertook the analysis of a knowledge whose \nvisible body is not theoretical or scientific discourse, nor literature \neither, but a regulated, everyday practice. The example of madness \nappeared to me, however, to be insufficiently topical; in the seventeenth \nand eighteenth centuries, psychopathology was still too rudimentary for \none to be able to distinguish it from a mere elaboration of traditional \nopinions; it seemed to me that clinical medicine at the time of its birth \nposed the problem in more rigorous terms; indeed, at the beginning \nof the nineteenth century it was connected with constituted sciences \nor ones in the process of being constituted, such as biology, physiol­\nogy, and pathological anatomy; but it was also connected with a set of \ninstitutions such as hospitals, welfare services, and teaching clinics, as \nwell as with practices such as administrative surveys. I wondered how, \nbetween these two reference points, a knowledge could have come into \nbeing, transformed itself and developed, offering to scientific theory \nnew fields of observation, fresh problems, and objects unperceived until \nthen; but how, on the other hand, scientific knowledge [des connais­\nsances scientifiques] had been introduced into it, had taken on a pre­\nscriptive value and become a source of ethical standards. The practice \nof medicine is not limited to combining a rigorous science and an uncer­\ntain tradition to form an unstable blend; it is built as a knowledge sys­\ntem that has its own balance and coherence. \nSo one could grant the existence of domains of knowledge that were \nnot exactly identifiable with sciences yet were not just mental habits \neither. Thus, in Les Mots et les chosesb I tried an opposite experiment: \nneutralize the whole practical and institutional side but without giving \nup the idea of going back to it one day; consider, for a given period, \nseveral of these domains of knowledge (natural classifications, general \ngrammar, and the analysis of wealth in the seventeenth and eighteenth \ncenturies) and examine them in tum to define the type of problems they \nraise, of concepts they bring into play, the theories they put to the test. \nNot only could one define the internal \"archaeology\" of each of these \ndomains taken one by one, but from one to the other there were dis­\ncernible identities, analogies, sets of differences that must be described. \nAn overall configuration emerged. To be sure, it was far from charac­\nterizing the classical mind in general, but it organized in a coherent way \na whole area of empirical knowledge. \nI was thus presented with two very distinct groups of results: on the \none hand, I had established the specific and relatively autonomous"

A clari­\nfication became necessary. I outlined it in L'Archeologie du savoir C: \nbetween opinion and science [connaissance scientifique] one can rec­\nognize the existence of a particular level that we may call the level of \nknowledge [savoir]. This knowledge is embodied not only in theoret­\nical texts or empirical instruments but also in a whole set of practices \nand institutions; however, it is not the pure and simple result, the half­\nconscious expression, of these. In point of fact, it comprises rules that \nproperly belong to it, characterizing its existence, its operation, and its \nhistory. Some of these rules are peculiar to a single domain; others are \ncommon to several; and there are rules that may be general to a whole \nepoch. Finally, the development of this knowledge [savoir] and its \ntransformations involve complex relations of causality. \nTEACHING PROJECT \nThe work to come is subject to two imperatives: never lose sight of the \nreference of a concrete example that may serve as a testing ground for \nthe analysis; frame the problems that I have come across or will no \ndoubt encounter. \n1. The sector chosen as a privileged example, which I will adhere to \nfor a certain time, is the knowledge of heredity. It developed through­\nout the nineteenth century, starting from breeding techniques, on \nthrough attempts to improve species, experiments with intensive cul­\ntivation, efforts to combat animal and plant epidemics, and culminat­\ning in the establishment of a genetics whose birth date can be placed \nat the beginning of the twentieth century. On the one hand, this knowl­\nedge responded to quite particular economic needs and historical con­\nditions. Changes in the dimensions and forms of cultivation of rural \nproperties, in the equilibrium of markets, in the required standards of \nprofitability, and in the system of colonial agriculture deeply trans­\nformed this knowledge; they altered not only the nature of its informa­\ntion but also its quantity and scale. On the other hand, this knowledge \nwas receptive to new developments in sciences such as chemistry or \nplant and animal physiology. (Witness the use of nitrate fertilizer or the \ntechnique of hybridization, which had been made possible by the the­\nory of plant fertilization, defined in the eighteenth century.)

It gave rise both to adapted techniques (such as those of \nVilmorin for species improvement) and epistemologically productive \nconcepts (such as that of hereditary trait, explained in detail if not \ndefined by Naudin). Darwiri was not mistaken when he found in this \nhuman practice the model enabling him to understand the natural evo­\nlution of species. \n2. As for the theoretical problems that will have to be worked out, \nit seems to me that they can be assembled into three groups. \nIt will be necessary first to try to assign a status to this knowledge: \nwhere to place it, between what boundaries, and what tools to select \nfor describing it. (In the example I've put forward, one sees that the \nmaterial is enormous, going from almost silent habits transmitted by \ntradition to duly transcribed experimentations and precepts.) It will \nalso be necessary to try to identify its instruments and its channels of \ndissemination, and to see whether it spread evenly through all the \nsocial groups and all the areas. Lastly, it will be necessary to try to \ndetermine the different levels of such a knowledge, its degrees of con­\nsciousness, its possibilities of adjustment and correction. Thus, the the­\noretical problem that appears is that of an anonymous social knowledge \n[savoir] which does not take individual conscious learning [connais­\nsance] as a model or foundation. \nAnother group of problems has to do with the elaboration of this \nknowledge into a scientific discourse. In a sense, these crossings, these \ntransformations, and these thresholds constitute the genesis of a sci­\nence. But instead of seeking-as was done in certain projects of the \nphenomenological type-the primary origin of a science, its fundamen­\ntal project, and its root conditions of possibility, I will try to witness \nthe insidious and manifold beginnings of a science. It is sometimes pos­\nsible to rediscover and date the decisive text that constitutes a science's \nbirth certificate and its initial charter, so to speak (in the domain that \nI will use as my example, the texts of Naudin, Mendel, De Vries, or \nMorgan may claim this role by turns); but the important thing is to \ndetermine what transformation must have been carried out prior to \nthem, around them, or in them for a knowledge to be able to take on \nthe status and function of a science. In short, this is the theoretical \nproblem of the constitution of a science when one aims to analyze it \nnot in transcendental terms but in terms of history. \nThe third group of problems concerns causality in the order of knowl­\nedge.

(We know, for ex­\nample, how important the great plant epidemics of the nineteenth cen­\ntury were in the study of varieties, of their adaptive capacity and their \nstability.) But we need to determine much more precisely how-by \nwhat channels and according to what codes-knowledge registers (not \nwithout choice or modification) phenomena that had remained exte­\nrior to it up to that point; how it becomes receptive to processes that \nare foreign to it; how, finally, an alteration that occurred in one of \nits areas or at one of its levels can be transmitted elsewhere and take \neffect there. \nThe analysis of these three groups of problems should bring knowl­\nedge to light in its threefold appearance: it characterizes, groups to­\ngether, and coordinates a set of practices and institutions; it is the \nconstantly shifting locus of the constitution of sciences; it is the con­\nstituent element of a complex causality in which the history of science \nis caught up. To the extent that, in a given period, it has clearly speci­\nfied forms and domains, it can be broken down into several systems \nof thought. Obviously, it is by no means a matter of determining the \nsystem of thought of a particular epoch, or something like its \"world­\nview.\" Rather, it is a matter of identifying the different ensembles that \nare each bearers of a quite particular type of knowledge; that connect \nbehaviors, rules of conduct, laws, habits, or prescriptions; that thus \nform configurations both stable and capable of transformation. It is also \na matter of defining relations of conflict, proximity, or exchange.

Today, the his­\ntory of thought requires, perhaps, a readjustment of the same order: \nbetween the constituted sciences (whose history has often been written) \nand the phenomena of opinion (which historians know how to deal \nwith), it would be necessary to undertake the history of systems of \nthought.

One cannot \nreduce these transformations to a precise individual discovery; and \nyet one cannot merely characterize them as an overall change of out­\nlook [mentaliti], of collective attitude or state of mind. The transfor­\nmation of a discursive practice is tied to a whole, often quite complex \nset of modifications which may occur either outside it (in the forms of \nproduction, in the social relations, in the political institutions), or \nwithin it (in the techniques for determining objects, in the refinement \nand adjustment of concepts, in the accumulation of data), or along­\nside it (in other discursive practices).

In Aristotle, the \ndesire to know presupposes and transposes the prior relationship of \nknowledge, truth, and pleasure. \nIn The Gay Science, Nietzsche defines an altogether different set of \nrelations: \n• knowledge is an \"invention\"3 behind which there is something quite \ndistinct from it: an interplay of instincts, impulses, desires, fear, \nwill to appropriation. It is on the stage where they clash that knowl­\nedge comes into being; \n• it arises not as an effect of their harmony, of their successful equi­\nlibrium, but of their hatred, of their dubious and provisional com­\npromise, of a fragile pact they are always prepared to betray. It is \nnot a permanent faculty; it is an event or at least a series of events; \n• it is always servile, dependent, alert to advantages (not to its own, \nbut to what might interest the instinct or instincts that dominate it); \n• and if it professes to be a knowledge of the truth, this is because it \nproduces the truth through the action of a primordial and renewed \nfalsification that establishes the distinction between the true and \nthe untrue. \nInterest is thus posited radically prior to the knowledge that it sub­\nordinates as a mere instrument; the dissociated knowledge of pleasure \nand happiness is linked to strife, aversion, and malevolence exerted \nagainst themselves to the point of renouncing themselves through a \nsupplement of strife, aversion, and malevolence; its original link to \ntruth is undone, since in it truth is only an effect-an effect, moreover, \nof a falsification that calls itself opposition of the true and the untrue. \nThis model of a fundamentally interested knowledge, produced as an \nevent of the will and determining the effect of truth through falsifica­\ntion, is doubtless as far as it could be from the postulates of classical \nmetaphysics. It is the one that has been freely adapted and used, in this \nyear's course, with regard to a series of examples."

That \nstudy itself fits within a broader project, outlined the previous year: to \ntrace the formation of certain types of knowledge [savoir] out of the \njuridico-political matrices that gave birth to them and act as their sup­\nport. The working hypothesis is this: power relations (together with the \nstruggles that traverse them or the institutions that maintain them) do \nnot simply playa facilitating or obstructing role with respect to knowl­\nedge; they do not merely encourage or stimulate it, distort or restrict \nit; power and knowledge are not bound to each other solely through \nthe action of interests and ideologies; so the problem is not just to \ndetermine how power subordinates knowledge and makes it serve its \nends or how it superimposes itself on it, imposing ideological contents \nand limitations. No knowledge is formed without a system of commu­\nnication, registration, accumulation, and displacement that is in itself \na form of power, linked in its existence and its functioning to other \nforms of power. No power, on the other hand, is exercised without the \nextraction, appropriation, distribution, or restraint of a knowledge.

For one thing \nis certain: detention and imprisonment do not form part of the Euro­\npean penal system before the great reforms of the years 1780-1820. The \njurists of the eighteenth century are unanimous on this point: \"Prison \nis not regarded as a penalty according to our civil law ... although the \nprinces, for reasons of State, sometimes go so far as to inflict this pen­\nalty, these are decisive blows, and civil courts do not make use of these"

Prison prevents judicial authority from supervising and verifying \nthe application of penalties. The law does not penetrate into the pris­\nons, said Decazes in 1818. \n2. Prison, by intermingling convicts who are both different and iso­\nlated, forms a homogeneous community of criminals who become com­\nrades in confinement and who will remain such on the outside. Prison \nmanufactures a veritable army of domestic enemies. \n3.

To this criticism there were three successive replies: \n• imagine an alternative to prison which retains its positive effects \n(the segregation of criminals, their removal from circulation in soci­\nety) and eliminates its dangerous consequences (their return to cir­\nculation).

This is the goal that was pointed to \nthroughout Europe as \"penitentiary reform.\" We can give as chron­\nological markers for it the Lessons on Prisons by Julius (18'28),6 on \nthe one hand, and on the other the Brussels Conference in 1847. \nThis reform includes three main aspects: complete or partial iso­\nlation of prisoners inside the prisons (debates about the systems of \nAuburn and Pennsylvania); moral reform of convicts through work, \ninstruction, religion, rewards, sentence reductions; development of \nparapenal institutions of prevention, or cooptation, or supervision. \nNow, these reforms, which the revolutions of 1848 put an end to, \ndid not have the slightest effect on the prison dysfunctions that \nwere denounced in the preceding period; \n• finally, give an anthropological status to the carceral circle; replace \nthe old project of Julius and of Charles Lucas 7 (to establish a \"sci­\nence of prisons\" capable of giving the architectural, administrative, \nand pedagogical principles of a \"correctional\" institution) with a \n\"science of criminals\" that would be able to characterize them in \ntheir specificity and define the modes of social reaction suited to \ntheir case.

One might think, in fact, that prison \nwas indeed denounced, and very early on, in its practical consequences, \nbut that it was so firmly tied to the new penal theory (the one presid­\ning over the drafting of the nineteenth-century code) that it had to be \naccepted along with the theory; or, further, that this theory would have \nto be reworked, from top to bottom, if one aimed to formulate a radi­\ncal prison policy. \nNow, from this viewpoint, an examination ofthe penal theories ofthe \nsecond half of the eighteenth century yields rather surprising results. \nNone of the great reformers, whether they were theoreticians like \nBeccaria, jurists like Servan, legislators like Le Peletier de Saint­\nFargeau, or both at the same time like Brissot, recommend prison as \na universal or even a major penalty. In a general way, in all these for­\nmulations, the criminal is defined as society's enemy. In this respect, \nthe reformers take up and transform what had been the result of a \nwhole political and institutional evolution since the Middle Ages: the \nreplacement of litigation settlement by public prosecution. By interven­\ning, the king's prosecutor designates the infraction not just as an attack \non a person or a private interest but as an attempt upon the king's sov­\nereignty. Commenting on the English laws, Blackstone said that the \npublic prosecutor defends both the sovereignty of the king and the \ninterests of society. 8 In short, a large majority of the reformers, starting \nwith Beccaria, sought to define the notion of crime, the role of the pub­\nlic party, and the necessity of punishment solely on the basis of the \ninterest of society or the need to protect it. The criminal injures soci­\nety first of all; breaking the social compact, he sets himself up in soci­\nety as a domestic enemy.

Since the punishment does not derive from the \ntransgression itself but from the harm caused to society or from the \ndanger to which it exposes society, the weaker the society is, the more \nmindful of its security it will have to be, and the more severe it will \nneed to show itself. Hence, no universal model of penal practice, and \nan essential relativity of penalties. \n2. If the penalty were expiation, there would be no harm in its being \ntoo harsh; in any case, it would be difficult to establish a just propor­\ntion between it and the crime. Yet if it is a matter of protecting society, \none can calculate it in such a way that it ensures exactly that function: \nany additional severity becomes an abuse of power. The justice of the \npenalty is in its economy. \n5. The role of the penalty is entirely oriented toward the exterior and \ntoward the future: to prevent crime from recommencing. Logically, a \ncrime that one knew for certain to be the last would not need to be pun­\nished. Hence, make the guilty incapable of further harm and dissuade \nthe innocent from any similar infraction. Here, the certainty of the pen­\nalty, its inevitability, more than any severity, constitutes its effectiveness. \nNow, from such principles it is not possible to deduce what will \nactually come to pass in penal practice, namely, the universalization of \nprison as the general form of punishment.

Dishonor is a perfect penalty, since it is the immediate and \nspontaneous reaction of society itself; it varies with each society; it \nis graduated according to the harmfulness of each crime; it can be \nrevoked by a public rehabilitation; lastly, it affects only the guilty \nperson. It is therefore a penalty that is adjusted to the crime with­\nout having to go by way of a code, without having to be applied by \na court, and without risk of being misused by a political power. It \nis exactly attuned to the principles of penal practice. \"The triumph \nof a good legislation is when public opinion is strong enough to \npunish offenses by itself .... Fortunate is the people in whom the \nsense of honor can be the only law. It has little need of legislation. \nDishonor, there is its penal code\";9 \n• another model employed in the plans for reform is that of retalia­\ntion.

And, provided the \nlatter is quick and inevitable, it almost automatically nullifies the \nadvantages expected by the lawbreaker, rendering the crime use­\nless. The benefit of the offense is abruptly brought back to zero. \nDoubtless, the retaliation model was never proposed in a detailed \nform; but it often enabled one to define some types of punishment. \nBeccaria, for example: \"Attacks against persons ought to be pun­\nished by corporal penalties\"; \"personal injuries against honor ought \nto be pecuniary.\" One also finds it in the form of a \"moral retalia­\ntion\": punish the crime not by turning its effects around but by turn­\ning back toward the beginnings and the vices that are its cause. 10 Le \nPeletier de Saint-Fargeau recommends to the National Assembly \n(21 May 1791): physical pain to punish heinous crimes; hard labor \nto punish crimes originating in idleness; and dishonor to punish \ncrimes inspired by an \"abject and degraded\" soul; 11 \n-lastly, a third model, enslavement for the benefit of society. Such \na penalty can be graduated, in its intensity and duration, accord­\ning to the harm done to the community. It is connected with the \ntransgression through that damaged interest. Beccaria, apropos of \nthieves: \"Temporary slavery places the labor and the person of the \nguilty individual in the service of society so that this state of total \ndependence compensates it for the unjust despotism that he prac­\nticed by violating the social compact. \"12 Brissot: \"By what should the \ndeath penalty be replaced? By slavery which makes the guilty inca­\npable of harming society; by labor which makes him useful; by \nlong and continuous suffering which frightens those who might be \ntempted to imitate him.\"!3 \nOf course, in all these plans, prison often figures as one of the pos­\nsible penalties: either as a condition of forced labor, or as a retaliation \npenalty for those who have interfered with the liberty of others. But it \ndoes not appear as the general form of penality, nor as the condition \nfor a psychological and moral transformation of the delinquent. \nIt is in the first years of the nineteenth century that one will see \nthe theoreticians grant this role to prison. \"Imprisonment is the pre­\neminent penalty in civilized societies.

Rossi, 1829).14 But dur­\ning this period the prison will already exist as a major instrument of \npenality. Prison as a place of improvement is a reinterpretation of a \npractice of imprisonment that had spread in the preceding years. \nThus, prison practice was not implied in penal theory. It was born else­\nwhere and was formed for other reasons. And it was imposed from the \noutside, as it were, on penal theory, which would be obliged to justify \nit after the fact. For example, this is what Livingston would do, in 1820, \nwhen he said that the prison penalty had the fourfold advantage of \nbeing divisible into as many degrees as there were degrees of serious­\nness in the offenses; of preventing recurrence; of enabling correction; \nof being mild enough so that juries would not hesitate to punish and \nthe people would not rebel against the law.15 \nTo understand how prison really functioned, beneath its apparent \ndysfunction, and how deeply successful it was beneath its surface fail­\nures, we must go back, no doubt, to those parapenal agencies of control \nin which it figured, as we have seen, in the seventeenth and especially \nthe eighteenth centuries. \nIn those instances, confinement plays a role that includes three dis­\ntinct features. \n• It intervenes, in the spatial distribution of individuals, through \nthe temporary imprisonment of beggars and vagabonds. No doubt, \nordinances (end of seventeenth and eighteenth century) sentence \nthem to the convict ships, at least in the case of repeat offenses; but \nconfinement remains in fact the most frequent punishment. Now, \nif they are confined, it is not so much to keep them where they are \nheld as to move them: make the cities off-limits to them, send them \ninto the countryside, or also prevent them from roaming in an area, \nforce them to go where they can be given work. This is at least a \nnegative way of controlling their location relative to the apparatus \nof farm and factory production; a way of acting upon the popula­\ntion flow, taking into account the needs of production and of the \njob market. \n• Confinement also intervenes at the level of individual conduct. It \npenalizes at an infrapenal level ways of living, types of discourse, \npolitical projects or intentions, sexual behaviors, rejections of author-"

An analysis of the lettres de cachet \n(of both their functioning and their motivation) shows that the great \nmajority of them were solicited by family men, by minor notables, \nby local, religious, and professional communities against individu­\nals who in their estimation cause disturbance and disorder. The \nlettre de cachet rises from the bottom to the top (in the form of a \nrequest) before going back down the power apparatus in the form \nof an order bearing the royal seal. It is the instrument of a local and, \nso to speak, capillary control. \nA similar analysis could be done concerning associations in England \nfrom the end of the seventeenth century onward. Often led by \"dissi­\ndents,\" they aim to denounce, exclude, and bring action against indi­\nviduals for delinquencies, refusals of work, and everyday disorders. \nBetween this form of control and that ensured by the lettres de cachet \nthe differences, obviously, are enormous.

In France, by contrast, the forms of control were closely con­\nnected with a state apparatus that had organized Europe's first great \npolice force, which the Austria of Joseph II, then England, undertook \nto imitate.

The work and \nthe person of Colquhoun are at the center of this process. \nWhat transformed penality at the tum of the century was the adjust­\nment of the judicial system to a mechanism of oversight and control. \nIt is their joint integration into a centralized state apparatus-but also \nthe establishment and development of a whole series of (parapenal and \nat times nonpenal) institutions-that serves the main apparatus as a \npoint of support, as forward positions, or reduced forms. A general sys­\ntem of oversight and confinement penetrates all layers of society, tak­\ning forms that go from the great prisons built on the panopticon model \nto the charitable societies, and that find their points of application not \nonly among the delinquents, but among abandoned children, orphans, \napprentices, high school students, workers, and so on.

But that is another story. \nThese few notations may help us to understand the position of the \nmadman and the psychiatrist in the space of the asylum. \nThere is doubtless a historical correlation between two facts: before \nthe eighteenth century, madness was not systematically interned; and \nit was considered essentially as a form of error or illusion. At the begin­\nning of the Classical age, madness was still seen as belonging to the \nworld's chimeras; it could live in the midst of them, and it didn't have"

The therapeutic places that were rec­\nognized were in nature, first of all, since nature was the visible form \nof truth; it held the power to dissipate error, to make the chimera melt \naway. So the prescriptions given by doctors were apt to be travel, rest, \nwalking, retirement, breaking with the artificial and vain world of the \ncity. Esquirol will remember this when, in planning a psychiatric hos­\npital, he will recommend that each courtyard open expansively onto a \ngarden view. The other therapeutic place put to use was the theater, \nnature's opposite: the patient's own madness was acted out for him on \nthe stage; it was lent a momentary fictive reality; one pretended, with \nthe help of props and disguises, as if it were true, but in such a way \nthat, caught in this trap, the delusion would finally reveal itself to the \nvery eyes of its victim. This technique had not completely disappeared, \neither, in the nineteenth century; Esquirol, for example, would recom­\nmend that proceedings be instituted against melancholics to stimulate \ntheir taste for fighting back. \nThe practice of internment at the beginning of the nineteenth cen­\ntury coincides with the moment when madness is perceived less in \nrelation to delusion than in relation to regular, normal behavior; when \nit appears no longer as disturbed judgment but as a disorder in one's \nway of acting, of willing, of experiencing passions, of making decisions, \nand of being free; in short, when it is no longer inscribed on the axis \ntruth-error-consciousness but on the axis passion-will-freedom-the \nmoment of Hoffbauer and Esquirol. \"There are madmen whose delir­\nium is scarcely visible; there are none whose passions, whose moral \naffections are not confused, perverted, or reduced to nothing ....

What is the process of recovery in fact? \nThe movement by which the delusion is dissipated and the truth is \nnewly brought to light? Not at all; rather, \"the return of the moral affec­\ntions within their proper bounds, the desire to see one's friends, one's \nchildren, again, the tears of sensibility, the need to pour out one's heart, \nto be in the midst of one's family again, to resume one's habits.\"2 \nWhat might be the role of the asylum, then, in this new orientation \ntoward regular behaviors?

And this occurs in a process revolving around the inflated \npower of the physician. Charcot, the miracle worker of hysteria, is un­\ndoubtedly the figure most highly symbolic of this type of functioning. \nNow, this heightening occurs at a time when medical power finds \nits guarantees and its justifications in the privilege of expertise [con­\nnaissance]; the doctor is qualified, the doctor knows the diseases and \nthe patients, he possesses a scientific knowledge that is of the same \ntype as that of the chemist or the biologist, and that is what authorizes \nhim to intervene and decide. So the power that the asylum gives to the \npsychiatrist will have to justify itself (and mask itself at the same time \nas a primordial superpower) by producing phenomena that can be inte­\ngrated into medical science. One understands why the technique of \nhypnosis and suggestion, the problem of simulation, and diagnosis dif­\nferentiating between organic disease and psychological disease were, \nfor so many years (from 1860 to 1890 at least), at the center of psychi­\natric theory and practice.

Instead of trying to produce the truth of ill­\nness theatrically, it would be better to try to reduce it to its strict real­\nity, which is often nothing more than the capacity for letting itself be \ndramatized-pithiatism. Henceforth, not only will the relation of dom­\nination by the doctor over the patient lose none of its rigor, but its rigor \nwill be directed toward reducing the illness to its strict minimum: the \nsigns necessary and sufficient for it to be diagnosable as a mental ill­\nness, and the techniques absolutely necessary in order for these mani­\nfestations to disappear. \nThe object is to Pasteurize the psychiatric hospital, as it were, to \nobtain the same simplification effect for the asylum that Pasteur had \nforced upon the hospitals: link diagnosis and therapy, knowledge of the \nnature of the illness and the suppression of its manifestations, directly \nto one another. The moment of testing, when the illness appears in \nits truth and is fully expressed, no longer must figure in the medical \nprocess; the hospital can become a silent place where the form of \nmedical power is maintained in its strictest aspect, but without its hav­\ning to encounter or confront madness itself. Let us call this \"aseptic\" \nand \"asymptomatic\" form of depsychiatrization \"zero-production psy­\nchiatry.\" Psychosurgery and pharmacological psychiatry are its most \nnotable forms. \n2. Another form of depsychiatrization, the exact opposite of the pre­\nceding one. Here it is a matter of making the production of madness \nin its truth as intense as possible, but in such a way that the power rela­\ntions between doctor and patient are invested exactly in that produc­\ntion; they remain adequate to it and do not allow themselves to be \noverrun by it, and they keep control of it. \nThe first condition for this maintenance of \"depsychiatrized\" medi­\ncal power is the discrediting of all the effects peculiar to the space of \nthe asylum. Above all, one must avoid the trap into which Charcot's \nthaumaturgy fell: one must make sure that hospital allegiance does not \nmock medical authority and that, in this place of collusions and obscure \ncollective knowledge [savoirs], the physician's sovereign science does \nnot get caught up in mechanisms that it may have unintentionally pro­\nduced.

The notion of trans­\nference, as a process essential to the treatment, is a way of conceptu­\nalizing this adequation in the form of knowledge [connaissance]; the \npayment of money, the monetary counterpart of transference, is a way \nof preventing the production of truth from becoming a counterpower \nthat traps, annuls, overturns the power of the physician. \nThese two great forms of depsychiatrization-both of which are \npower-conserving, the first because it annuls the production of truth, \nthe second because it tries to ensure an exact fit between truth produc­\ntion and medical power-become the target of anti psychiatry.

Obviously, everything is a mat­\nter of power; subdue the power of the madman, neutralize the external \npowers that may be brought to bear on him; establish a power of ther­\napy and rectification-of \"orthopedics\"-over him. Now, it is clearly \nthe institution-as a place, a form of distribution, and a mechanism of \nthese power relations-that antipsychiatry attacks. Beneath the ration­\nale of an internment that would make it possible, in a purified place, \nto determine what's what and to intervene when, where, and however \nnecessary, it gives rise to the relations of domination that characterize \nthe institutional setup: \"The sheer power of the doctor increases,\" says \nBasaglia, observing the effects of Esquirol's prescriptions in the twen­\ntieth century, \"and the power of the patient diminishes at the same \nvertiginous rate; the patient, from the mere fact that he is interned, \nbecomes a citizen without rights, delivered over to the arbitrariness of \nthe doctor and the orderlies, who can do what they please with him \nwithout any possibility of appeal.\"7 It seems to me that one could situ­\nate the different forms of anti psychiatry according to their strategies \nwith respect to these institutional power games: escape from them in \nthe form of a two-party contract freely agreed to by both sides (Szasz 8); \narrange a privileged place where they must be suspended or rooted \nout if they manage to reconstitute themselves (Kingsley Hallg); iden­\ntify them one by one and gradually destroy them inside an institution \nof the classic type (Cooper, at Villa 2110); connect them to other power \nrelations outside the asylum which may have already brought about \nthe segregation of an individual as a mental patient (Gorizia ll). Power \nrelations constituted the a priori of psychiatric practice. They condi­\ntioned the operation of the mental institution; they distributed relation­\nships between individuals within it; they governed the forms of medical \nintervention. The characteristic reversal of antipsychiatry consists in \nplacing them, on the contrary, at the center of the problematic field and \nin questioning them in a primary way. \nNow, what was essentially involved in these power relations was the \nabsolute right of nonmadness over madness.

It places sexuality, or at \nleast the sexual use of one's own body, at the origin of an indefinite \nseries of physical disorders that may make their effects felt in all forms \nand at all ages of life. Sexuality's limitless etiological power, at the level \nof bodies and diseases, is one of the most constant themes not only in \nthe texts of that new medical ethics but also in the most serious works \nof pathology. If the child thus becomes responsible for his own body \nand his own life, in the \"abuse\" he makes of sexuality, the parents are \ndenounced as the real culprits: lack of supervision, neglect, and, above \nall, lack of interest in their children, their children's bodies, and their \nconduct, which leads them to entrust their children to wet nurses, \ndomestic servants, tutors, all those intermediaries regularly denounced \nas initiators into vice (Freud will take up this theme in his first theory \nof \"seduction\"). What emerges through this campaign is the impera­\ntive of a new parents-children relationship, and more broadly as a new \neconomy of intrafamilial relations: a solidification and intensification \nof father-mother-children relations (at the expense of the multiple \nrelations that characterized the large \"household\"); a reversal of the \nsystem of family obligations (which formerly went from children to par­\nents but now tend to make the child the primary and ceaseless object \nof the duties of the parents, who are assigned complete moral and \nmedical responsibility for their progeny); the emergence of the health \nprinciple as a basic law governing family ties; the distribution of the \nfamily cell around the body-and the sexual body-of the child; the \norganization of an immediate physical bond, a body-to-body relation­\nship of parents and children, knitting together desire and power in a \ncomplex way; the necessity, finally, for a control and an external med­\nical knowledge to arbitrate and regulate these new relations between \nthe parents' obligatory vigilance and the children's ever so fragile, irri­\ntable, and excitable body. The crusade against masturbation reflects \nthe setting-up of the restricted family (parents, children) as a new \nknowledge-power apparatus. The questioning of the child's sexuality, \nand of all the anomalies it was thought to be responsible for, was one of \nthe means by which this new contrivance [dis-posit!!] was put together. \nThe little incestuous family, the tiny, sexually saturated familial space \nin which we were raised and in which we live, was formed there."

In actual fact, the three figures of the monster, the incorrigible, \nand the onanist will not exactly merge together.

That model pre­\nsupposes the individual as a subject of natural rights or original pow­\ners; it aims to account for the ideal genesis of the state; and it makes \nlaw the fundamental manifestation of power. One would have to study \npower not on the basis of the primitive terms of the relation but starting \nfrom the relation itself, inasmuch as the relation is what determines \nthe elements on which it bears: instead of asking ideal subjects what \npart of themselves or what powers of theirs they have surrendered, \nallowing themselves to be subjectified [se laisser assujettir], one would \nneed to inquire how relations of subjectivation can manufacture sub­\njects. Similarly, rather than looking for the single form, the central \npoint from which all the forms of power would be derived by way of \nconsequence or development, one must first let them stand forth in \ntheir multiplicity, their differences, their specificity, their reversibility: \nstudy them therefore as relations of force that intersect, interrelate, \nconverge, or, on the contrary, oppose one another or tend to cancel \neach other out. Finally, instead of privileging law as a manifestation of \npower, it would be better to try and identify the different techniques \nof constraint that it brings into play. \nIf it is necessary to avoid reducing the analysis of power to the scheme \nsuggested by the juridical constitution of sovereignty, if it is necessary \nto think about power in terms of force relations, must it be deciphered, \nthen, according to the general form of war?

How was \nwar perceived in the background of peace? Who looked in the din and \nconfusion of war, in the mud of battles, for the principle of intelligibil­\nity of order, institutions, and history? Who first thought that politics \nwas war pursued by other means? \nA paradox appears at a glance. With the evolution of states since the \nbeginning of the Middle Ages, it seems that the practices and institu­\ntions of war pursued a visible development. Moreover, they tended to \nbe concentrated in the hands of a central power that alone had the right \nand the means of war; owing to that very fact, they withdrew, albeit \nslowly, from the person-to-person, group-to-group relationship, and a \nline of development led them increasingly to be a state privilege. Fur­\nthermore and as a result, war tends to become the professional and \ntechnical prerogative of a carefully defined and controlled military \napparatus.

This \ndiscourse appeared shortly after the end of the wars of religion and at \nthe beginning of the great English political struggles of the seventeenth \ncentury. According to this discourse, which was illustrated in England \nby Coke or Lilburne, in France by Boulainvilliers and later by Du Buat­\nNanr,;ay,l it was war that presided over the birth of states: not the ideal \nwar imagined by the philosophers of the state of nature but real wars \nand actual battles; laws are born in the middle of expeditions, con­\nquests, and burning cities; but war also continues to rage within the \nmechanisms of power-or, at least, to constitute the secret driving force \nof institutions, laws, and order. Beneath the omissions, illusions, and \nlies that make us believe in the necessities of nature or the functional \nrequirements of order, we are bound to reecounter war: it is the cipher \nof peace. It continuously divides the entire social body; it places each \nof us in one camp or the other. And it is not enough to find this war \nagain as an explanatory principle; we must reactivate it, make it leave \nthe mute, larval forms in which it goes about its business almost with­\nout our being aware of it, and lead it to a decisive battle that we must \nprepare for if we intend to be victorious. \nThrough this thematic, which I have characterized loosely thus far, \none can understand the importance of this form of analysis. \n1. The subject who speaks in this discourse cannot occupy the posi­\ntion of the universal subject. In that general struggle of which he \nspeaks, he is necessarily on one side or the other; he is in the battle, \nhe has adversaries, he fights for a victory. No doubt, he tries to make \nright prevail, but the right in question is his particular right, marked \nby a relation of conquest, domination, or antiquity: rights of trium­\nphant invasions or millennial occupations. And if he also speaks of \ntruth, it is that perspectival and strategic truth that enables him to \nwin the victory. So, in this case, we have a political and historical dis­\ncourse that lays claim to truth and right, while explicitly excluding \nitself from juridico-philosophical universality. Its role is not the one \nthat lawmakers and philosophers dreamed of, from Solon to Kant: to \ntake a position between the adversaries, at the center of and above the \nconflict, and impose an armistice, establish an order that brings rec­\nonciliation.

For the subject who \nspeaks this sort of discourse, universal truth and general right are illu­\nsions and traps. \n2. We are dealing, moreover, with a discourse that turns the tradi­\ntional values of intelligibility upside down. An explanation from below, \nwhich is not the simplest, the most elementary, the clearest explana­\ntion but, rather, the most confused, the murkiest, the most disorderly, \nthe most haphazard. What is meant to serve as a principle of decipher­\nment is the confusion of violence, passions, enmities, revenges; it is \nalso the web of petty circumstances that decide defeats and victories. \nThe dark, elliptical god of battles must illuminate the long days of \norder, labor, and peace. Fury must account for harmonies. Thus, at \nthe beginning of history and law one will posit a series of brute facts \n(physical vigor, force, character traits), a series of chance happenings \n(defeats, victories, successes or failures of conspiracy, rebellions or \nalliances). And only above this tangle will a growing rationality take \nshape, that of calculations and strategies-a rationality that, as one \nrises and it develops, becomes increasingly fragile, more and more \nspiteful, more closely tied to illusion, to fancy, to mystification. So \nwe have the complete opposite of those traditional analyses which \nattempt to rediscover, beneath the visible brutality of bodies and pas­\nsions, a fundamental, abiding rationality, linked by nature to the just \nand the good. \nThis type of discourse develops entirely within the historical dimen­\nsion. It undertakes not to measure history, unjust governments, abuses, \nand acts of violence with the ideal principle of a reason or a law but, \nrather, to awaken, beneath the form of institutions or laws, the forgot­\nten past of real struggles, of masked victories or defeats, the dried blood \nin the codes. It takes as its field of reference the undefined movement \nof history. But at the same time it is possible for it to draw support from \nthe traditional mythical forms (the lost age of great ancestors, the immi­\nnence of new times and millennial revenge, the coming of a new king­\ndom that will wipe out the ancient defeats): it is a discourse that will \nbe able to carry both the nostalgia of decaying aristocracies and the \nardor of popular revenges. \nIn summary, as against the philosophico-juridical discourse organ­\nized in terms of the problem of sovereignty and law, this discourse \nwhich deciphers the continued existence of war in society is essentially"

One must first set aside some false paternities-that of Hobbes, \nin particular. What Hobbes calls the \"war of all against all\" is not in \nany way a real historical war but a game of representations by which \neach measures the danger that each represents for him, estimates the \n. others' will to fight, anti. calculates the risk he himself would be tak­\ning if he resorted to force. Sovereignty-whether it involves a \"com­\nmonwealth by institution\" or a \"commonwealth by acquisition\"-is \nestablished not by an act of bellicose domination but, rather, by a cal­\nculation that allows war to be avoided.

In England, first, in \nthe parliamentary opposition and among the Puritans, with the idea \nthat English society, since the eleventh century, was a society of con­\nquest: monarchy and aristocracy, with their characteristic institutions, \nwere seen as Norman imports, while the Saxon people preserved, not \nwithout difficulty, a few traces of their original freedoms. Against this \nbackground of martial domination, English historians such as Coke or \nSelden 4 restored the chief episodes of England's history; each of these \nis analyzed either as a consequence or as a resumption of that histori­\ncally primary state of war between two hostile races with different insti­\ntutions and interests.

A transition from a \n\"territorial state\" to a \"population state\"? No, one would have to say, \nbecause what occurred was not a replacement but, rather, a shift of \naccent and the appearance of new objectives, and hence of new prob­\nlems and new techniques. \nTo follow that genesis, we took up the notion of government as our \nleading thread. \n1. One would need to do an in-depth inquiry concerning the history \nnot merely of the notion but even of the procedures and means em­\nployed to ensure, in a given society, the \"government of men.\" In a very \nfirst approach, it seems that for the Greek and Roman societies the \nexercise of political power did not involve the right or the possibilities \nof a \"government\" understood as an activity that undertakes to conduct \nindividuals throughout their lives by placing them under the authority \nof a guide responsible for what they do and for what happens to them. \nFollowing the indications furnished by Paul Veyne, it seems that the \nidea of a pastor-sovereign, a king or judge-shepherd of the human \nflock, is rarely found outside the archaic Greek texts or except in cer­\ntain authors of the imperial epoch. On the other hand, the metaphor \nof the shepherd watching over the sheep is accepted when it comes to \ncharacterizing the activity of the educator, the doctor, the gymnastics \nteacher. An analysis of the Politics would confirm this hypothesis. \nIt was in the East that the theme of pastoral power was fully devel-"

A certain number of traits mark \nthis theme: the shepherd's power is exercised not so much over a fixed \nterritory as over a multitude in movement toward a goal; it has the role \nof providing the flock with its sustenance, watching over it on a daily \nbasis, and ensuring its salvation; lastly, it is a matter of a power that \nindividualizes by granting, through an essential paradox, as much value \nto a single one of the sheep as to the entire flock. It is this type of power \nthat was introduced into the West by Christianity and took an insti­\ntutional form in the ecclesiastical pastorate: the government of souls \nwas constituted in the Christian Church as a central, knowledge-based \nactivity indispensable for the salvation of each and every one. \nNow, the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries saw a general crisis of the \npastorate open up and develop, but in a much more complex fashion: \na search for other modes (and not necessarily less strict ones) of spir­\nitual direction and new types of relations between pastor and flock; but \nalso inquiries concerning the right way to \"govern\" children, a family, \na domain, a principality. The general questioning of government and \nself-government, of guidance and self-guidance, accompanies, at the \nend of feudalism, the birth of new forms of economic and social rela­\ntions and new political structurations. \n2. We next analyzed some aspects of the formation of a political \n\"governmentality\": that is, the way in which the behavior of a set of \nindividuals became involved, more and more markedly, in the exercise \nof sovereign power. This important transformation is expressed in the \ndifferent \"arts of governing\" that were written at the end of the six­\nteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth. No doubt, it is \nlinked to the emergence of the \"reason of state.\" One goes from an art \nof governing whose principles were borrowed from the traditional vir­\ntues (wisdom, justice, liberality, respect for divine laws and human \ncustoms) or from the common abilities (prudence, thoughtful deci­\nsions, taking care to surround oneself with the best adviser) to an art \nof governing whose rationality has its principles and its specific domain \nof application in the state. The \"reason of state\" is not the imperative \nin the name of which one can or must upset all the other rules; it is \nthe new matrix of rationality according to which the prince must exer­\ncise his sovereignty in governing men. One is far from the virtue of \nthe sovereign of justice-far, too, from that virtue which is proper to \nMachiavelli's hero. \nThe development of the reason of state is correlative with the fad-"

A new his­\ntorical perception takes form; it is no longer polarized around the end \nof time and the consolidation of all the particular sovereignties into the \nempire of the last days; it is open to an indefinite time in which the \nstates have to struggle against one another to ensure their own survival. \nAnd more than the problems of a sovereign's legitimate dominion over \na territory, what will appear important is the knowledge and develop­\nment of a state's forces: in a space (European and global at once) of \ncompetition between states, very different from that in which dynastic \nrivals confront each other, the major problem is that of a dynamic of \nthe forces and the rational techniques which enable one to intervene \nin those forces. \nThus, the reason of state, apart from the theories that formulated \nand justified it, takes shape in two great ensembles of political knowl­\nedge and technology: a diplomatico-military technology that consists \nin ensuring and developing the forces of a state through a system of \nalliances, and the organizing of an armed apparatus. The search for a \nEuropean equilibrium, which was one of the guiding principles of the \ntreaties of Westphalia, is a consequence of this political technology. \nThe second is constituted by \"policy\" [police], in the sense given to the \nword then: that is, the set of means necessary to make the forces of \nthe state increase from within. At the junction point of these two great \ntechnologies, and as a shared instrument, one must place commerce \nand monetary circulation between the states: enrichment through com­\nmerce offers the possibility of increasing the population, the manpower, \nproduction, and export, and of endowing oneself with large, power­\nful armies. During the period of mercantilism and cameralistics, the \npopulation-wealth pair was the privileged object of the new govern­\nmental reason. \n3. The working-out of this population-wealth problem (in its dif­\nferent concrete aspects: taxation Lfiscalite], scarcity, depopulation, \nidleness-beggary-vagabondage) constitutes one of the conditions of \nformation of political economy. The latter develops when it is realized \nthat the resources-population relationship can no longer be fully man­\naged through a coercive regulatory system that would tend to raise the \npopulation in order to augment the resources. The physiocrats are not \nantipopulationist in opposition to the mercantilists of the preceding \nepoch; they frame the population problem in a different way.

But this \ndependence can be rationally analyzed, in such a way that the popula­\ntion appears as \"naturally\" dependent on multiple factors that may be \nartificially alterable. So there begins to appear, branching off from the \ntechnology of \"policy\" and in correlation with the birth of economic \nthought, the political problem of population. The latter is not conceived \nas a collection of legal subjects, nor as a mass of human arms intended \nfor labor; it is analyzed as a set of elements that, first, is connected with \nthe general system of living beings (population in this sense falls in the \ncategory of \"the human race\" [l'espece humaine]; the notion, new at \nthe time, is to be distinguished from \"mankind\" [Ie genre humain]) \nand, second, may offer a purchase for concerted interventions (through \nlaws, but also through changes of attitude, of ways of acting and living \nthat can be obtained through \"campaigns\"). \nSEMINAR \nThe seminar was devoted to a few aspects of what the Germans, in the \neighteenth century, called Polizeiwissenschafl-that is, the theory and \nanalysis of everything '~that tends to affirm and increase the power of \nthe state to make good use of its forces, to obtain the welfare of its sub­\njects,\" and, above all, \"the maintenance of order and discipline, the reg­\nulations that tend to make their lives comfortable and to provide them \nwith the things they need for their livelihood.\" \nWe tried to show what problems this \"policy\" was meant to address; \nhow the role it was assigned was different from the one that would later \ndevolve upon the police institution; what results were expected of it \nin order to bring about the growth of the state, and this in terms of two \nobjectives-enable it to mark out and improve its position in the game \nof rivalry and competition between European states, and to guarantee \ninternal order by ensuring the \"welfare\" of individuals.

The development, starting in the \nsecond half of the eighteenth century, of what was called medizinische \nPolizei, public health, or social medicine, must be written back into \nthe general framework of a \"biopolitics\"; the latter tends to treat the \n\"population\" as a mass of living and coexisting beings who present par­\nticular biological and pathological traits and who thus come under spe­\ncific knowledge and technologies.

The theme addressed \nwas \"biopolitics.\" By that I meant the endeavor, begun in the eighteenth \ncentury, to rationalize the problems presented to governmental prac­\ntice by the phenomena characteristic of a group of living human beings \nconstituted as a population: health, sanitation, birthrate, longevity, \nrace ...

Liberalism is to be analyzed, then, as a principle \nand a method of rationalizing the exercise of government, a rationali­\nzation that obeys-and this is its specificity-the internal rule of maxi­\nmum economy. While any rationalization of the exercise of government \naims at maximizing its effects while diminishing, as far as possible, its \ncost (understood in the political as well as the economic sense), lib­\neral rationalization starts from the assumption that government (mean­\ning not the institution \"government,\" of course, but the activity that \nconsists in governing human behavior in the framework of, and by \nmeans of, state institutions) cannot be its own end. It does not have \nits reason for being in itself, and its maximization, even under the best \npossible conditions, should not be its regulative principle. On this point, \nliberalism breaks with that \"reason of state\" which, since the end of \nthe nineteenth century, had sought, in the existence and strengthening \nof the state, the end capable both of justifying a growing governmen­\ntality and of regulating its development. The Polizeiwissenschaft devel­\noped by the Germans in the eighteenth century-either because they \nlacked a large state form, OJ;\" also because the narrowness of their ter­\nritorial partitions gave them access to much more easily observable \nunits, given the technical and conceptual tools of the time-always \nsubscribed to the principle: One is not paying enough attention, too \nmany things escape one's control, too many areas lack regulation and \nsupervision, there's not enough order and administration. In short, one \nis governing too little. Polizeiwissenschaft is the form taken by a gov­\nernmental technology dominated by the principle of the reason of state, \nand'it is in a \"completely natural way,\" as it were, that it attends to \nthe problems of population, which ought to be the largest and most \nactive possible-for the strength of the state. Health, birthrate, sanita­\ntion find an important place in it, therefore, without any problem. \nFor its part, liberalism resonates with the principle: \"One always \ngoverns too much\"-or, at any rate, one always must suspect that one \ngoverns too much. Governmentality should not be exercised without a \n\"critique\" far more radical than a test of optimization. It should inquire \nnot just as to the best (or least costly) means of achieving its effects but \nalso concerning the possibility and even the lawfulness of its scheme \nfor achieving effects.

But, as \nP. Rosanvallon's important book has confirmed, liberalism is neither \nthe consequence nor the development of these;! rather, the market \nplayed, in the liberal critique, the role of a \"test,\" a locus of privileged \nexperience where one can identify the effects of excessive governmen­\ntality and even weigh their significance: the analysis of the mechanisms \nof \"dearth\" or more generally, of the grain trade in the middle of the \neighteenth century, was meant to show the point at which governing \nwas always governing too much.

At \nthe intersection of neo-Kantian philosophy, Husserl's phenomenology, \nand Weber's sociology, on certain points close to the Viennese econo­\nmists, concerned about the historical correlation between economic \nprocesses and juridical structures, men like Eucken, W.

There, too, distinctions must be made. \nRecognizing that one has committed sins is an obligation laid either \non catechumens who are candidates for baptism or on Christians who \nhave been prone to a few lapses. To the latter, the Didascalia prescribes \nthat they perform the exomologesis of their sins to the congregation. z \nNow, this \"confession\" seems not to have taken, at the time, the form of \na detailed public statement of the transgressions committed but, rather, \nof a collective rite in the course of which each individual acknowledged \nin his heart that he was a sinner before God. It was concerning seri­\nous offenses-in particular, idolatry, adultery, and homicide, as well as \non the occasion of persecutions and apostasy-that the specific charac­\nter of the exomologesis of wrongs was manifested: it became a condition \nfor reinstatement, and it was connected with a complex public ritual. \nThe history of penitential practices from the second to the fifth cen­\nturies shows that exomologesis did not have the form of a verbal con­\nfession examining the different offenses along with their circumstances, \nand that it did not obtain remission from the fact that it was enacted \nin the canonical form before the person who had received the author­\nity to remit them. Penance was a state into which one entered after a \nritual, and it was ended (sometimes on the deathbed) after a second \nceremonial. Between these two moments, the penitent did the exo­\nmologesis of his faults through his mortifications, his austerities, his \nway of living, his garments, his manifest attitude of repentance-in \nshort, through a whole dramaticity in which the verbal expression did \nnot have the main role, and in which the analytical statement of spe­\ncific wrongs seems to have been absent. It may be that before the rec­\nonciliation a special rite took place, and that the term exomologesis was \napplied to it more particularly. Yet even in that case it was still a mat-"

Verbalization of \nthe confession of sins in canonical penance will be done systematically \nonly later-first with the practice of penance at a price, then from the \ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries onward, when the sacrament of pen­\nance would be organized. \nIn the monastic institutions, the practice of confession took quite dif­\nferent forms (which did not exclude recourse to forms of exomologesis \nin front of the assembled community when the monk had committed \ntransgressions of a certain importance). To study these confessional \npractices in monastic life, we resorted to a more detailed study of \nCassian's Coriferences and Institutes of the Cenobites':' with a view to \nthe techniques of spiritual direction. Three aspects in particular were \nanalyzed: the mode of dependence with respect to the elder or teacher, \nthe way of conducting the examination of one's own conscience, and the \nobligation to describe one's mental impulses in a formulation that aims \nto be exhaustive-the exagoreusis. Considerable differences appear on \nthese three points, in comparison with ancient philosophy. Schemati­\ncally, we can say that in the monastic institution the relation to the \nteacher takes the form of an unconditional and steadfast obedience that \nconcerns every aspect of life and, in principle, does not leave the nov­\nice any margin of initiative; that while the value of this relationship \ndepends on the teacher's qualification, it is nonetheless true that by \nitself the form of obedience, whatever its object, holds a positive value; \nand finally, that while obedience is absolutely necessary for the nov­\nices and, as a rule, the teachers are elders, the age differential is not \nsufficient in itself to justify such a relationship-both because the abil­\nity to direct is a charisma and the obedience must constitute, in the \nform of humility, a permanent relationship with oneself and others. \nThe examination of conscience is also very different from the one \nrecommended in the philosophical schools of antiquity. Like the lat­\nter, of course, it comprises two great forms: the evening recollection \nof the day gone by and continual vigilance concerning oneself. It is this \nsecond form that is most important in the monasticism described by \nCassian. Its procedures show clearly that it is not a matter of deciding \nwhat must be done to keep from committing a transgression or even \nto recognize whether one may have committed a transgression in what"

It is a matter of taking hold of the thought occurrence \n(cogitatio = /ogismos), of probing rather deeply in order to grasp its \norigin and determine where it comes from (from God, from oneself, \nfrom the Devil) and do a sorting-out (which Cassian describes by using \nseveral metaphors, the most important of which is that of the money­\nchanger who inspects the coins). Cassian devotes one of the most inter­\nesting Conferences to \"inconstancy of the mind\"-relating the views \nof Abbot Serenus-which forms the domain of a self-examination \nthat dearly has the role of making possible the unity and continuity \nof contemplation. 4 \nAs for the confession prescribed by Cassian, it is not simply a state­\nment of wrongs committed, nor a general exposition of the state of \none's soul; it must tend toward the continuous verbalization of all the \nimpulses of thought. This confession enables the director to give coun­\nsel and render a diagnosis: Cassian thus relates examples of consulta­\ntion; sometimes several elders take part and give their opinions. But \nverbalization also involves intrinsic effects which it owes simply to \nthe fact that it transforms the impulses of the mind into statements \naddressed to another. In particular, the \"sorting-out,\" which is one of \nthe aims of the examination, is performed through verbalization with \nthe help of a threefold mechanism of shame that makes one blush at \nexpressing any bad thought, the material realization of what is hap­\npening in the mind through the words spoken, and the incompatibil­\nity between the Devil, who tempts and deceives while hiding in the \nrecesses of consciousness, and the light that exposes them to view. \nHence, understood in this way, confession involves a continuous exter­\nnalization through words of the \"arcana\" of consciousness. \nUnconditional obedience, uninterrupted examination, and exhaus­\ntive confession form an ensemble with each element implying the other \ntwo; the verbal manifestation of the truth that hides in the depths of \noneself appears as an indispensable component of the government of \nmen by each other, as it was carried out in monastic-and especially \nCenobitic-institutions beginning in the fourth century. But it must be \nemphasized that this manifestation was not for the purpose of estab­\nlishing one's sovereign mastery over oneself; what was expected, rather, \nwas humility and mortification, detachment toward oneself and the \nconstitution of a relation with oneself tending toward the destruction \nof the form of the self. \nThis year's seminar was devoted to certain aspects of liberal thought"

How were the experience that one \nmay have of oneself and the knowledge that one forms of oneself organ­\nized according to certain schemes? How were these schemes defined, \nvalorized, recommended, imposed? It is clear that neither the recourse \nto an original experience nor the study of the philosophical theories of \nthe soul, the passions, or the body can serve as the main axis in such \nan investigation. The guiding thread that seems the most useful for this \ninquiry is constituted by what one might call the \"techniques of the \nself,\" which is to say, the procedures, which no doubt exist in every civi­\nlization, suggested or prescribed to individuals in order to determine \ntheir identity, maintain it, or transform it in terms of a certain number \nof ends, through relations of self-mastery or self-knowledge. In short, \nit is a matter of placing the imperative to \"know oneself\" -which to us \nappears so characteristic of our civilization-back in the much broader \ninterrogation that serves as its explicit or implicit context: What should \none do with oneself? What work should be carried out on the self? \nHow should one \"govern oneself\" by performing actions in which one \nis oneself the objective of those actions, the domain in which they are \nbrought to bear, the instrument they employ, and the subject that acts?"

The series of studies that can be envisaged start­\ning from there could form a history of the \"care of oneself,\" understood \nas an experience, and thus also as a technique elaborating and trans­\nforming that experience. Such a project is at the intersection of two \nthemes treated previously: a history of subjectivity and an analysis of \nthe forms of \"governmentality.\" The history of subjectivity was begun \nby studying the social divisions brought about in the name of madness, \nillness, and delinquency, along with their effects on the constitution of \na rational and normal subject. It was also begun by attempting to iden­\ntify the modes of objectification of the subject in knowledge disciplines \n[dans ses savoirsJ such as those dealing with language, labor, and life. As \nfor the study of \"governmentality,\" it answered a dual purpose: doing \nthe necessary critique of the common conceptions of \"power\" (more \nor less confusedly conceived as a unitary system organized around a \ncenter that is at the same time its source, a system that is driven by its \ninternal dynamic always to expand); analyze it rather as a domain of \nstrategic relations focusing on the behavior of the other or others, and \nemploying various procedures and techniques according to the case, the \ninstitutional frameworks, social groups, and historical periods in which \nthey develop.

And in this way one \ncould take up the question of governmentality from a different angle: \nthe government of the self by oneself in its articulation with relations \nwith others (such as one finds in pedagogy, behavior counseling, spir­\nitual direction, the prescription of models for living, and so on)."

And a limitation \nof domain: these techniques of living were considered only in their \napplication to that type of act which the Greeks called aphrodisia, and \nfor which our notion of \"sexuality\" obviously constitutes a completely \ninadequate translation. The problem raised was the following, then: \nHow did the philosophical and medical techniques of living, on the eve \nof Christianity's development, define' and regulate the practice of sex­\nual acts-the khresis aphrodision? One sees how far one is from a his­\ntory of sexuality organized around the good old repressive hypothesis \nand its customary questions (how and why is desire repressed?). It is \na matter of acts and pleasures, not of desire. It is a matter of the forma­\ntion of the self through techniques of living, not of repression through \nprohibition and law. We shall try to show not how sex was kept in \ncheck but how that long history began which, in our societies, binds \ntogether sex and the subject. \nIt would be completely arbitrary to connect a particular moment in \ntime to the emergence of the \"care of oneself\" in regard to sexual acts; \nbu t the proposed demarcation (around the techniques of the self in the \ncenturies immediately preceding Christianity) has its justification. In \nfact, it is certain that the \"technology of the self\" -reflection on modes \nof living, on choices of existence, on the way to regulate one's behav­\nior, to attach oneself to ends and means-experienced an extensive \ndevelopment in the Hellenistic and Roman period, to the point of hav­\ning absorbed a large portion of philosophical activity. This develop­\nment cannot be dissociated from the growth of urban society, from the \nnew distribution of political power, or from the importance assumed \nby the new service aristocracy in the Roman Empire. This government \nof the self, with the techniques that are peculiar to it, takes its place \n\"between\" pedagogical institutions and the religions of salvation. This \nshould not be taken to mean a chronological succession, even if it is \ntrue that the question of the education of future citizens seems to have \noccasioned more interest and reflection in classical Greece, and the \nquestion of an afterlife and a hereafter caused more anxiety in later \nperiods.

The fact remains that \nthe technology of the self intended for the adult can be analyzed in the \nspecificity and breadth it took on during this period, provided it is \npulled out of the retrospective shadow cast on it by pedagogical insti­\ntutions and the salvation religions. \nNow, this art of self-government as it developed in the Hellenistic \nand Roman period is important for the ethic of sexual acts and its his­\ntory. Indeed, it is there-and not in Christianity-that the principles \nof the famous conjugal arrangement, whose history has been so long, \nwere formulated: the exclusion of any sexual activity outside the rela­\ntion between spouses, the procreative purpose of these acts, at the \nexpense of pleasure as an end, the emotional function of sexual rela­\ntions in the marriage partnership. But that is not all; it is also in this \ntechnology of the self that one observes the development of a form of \nuneasiness about sexual acts and their effects, an uneasiness whose ori­\ngin is too readily attributed to Christianity (when it is not attributed to \ncapitalism or \"bourgeois morality\"!). Of course, the question of sexual \nacts was far from having the importance then that it would subsequently \nhave in the Christian problematic of the flesh and its lusts; the ques­\ntion, for example, of anger or reversal of fortune undoubtedly looms \nlarger than sexual relations for the Hellenistic and Roman moralists; \nbut even if the place of sexual relations in the order of concerns is \nrather far from being the first, it is important to note the way in which \nthese techniques of the self connect the order of sexual acts to the \nwhole of existence. \nIn this year's course we focused on four examples of these techniques \nof the self in their relation with the regimen of the aphrodisia. \n1. The interpretation of dreams. Artemidorus's Oneirocritica/) in \nBook One, Chapters 78-80, constitutes the basic text in this area. The \nquestion raised there does not directly concern the practice of sexual \nacts but, rather, the use to be made of the dreams in which they are \nrepresented. In this text, it is a matter of determining the prognostic \nvalue they should be given in everyday life: what auspicious or inaus­\npicious events may one expect according to whether the dream has \npresented this or that type of sexual relation?

The medical regimens. These aim directly to assign a \"measure\" \nto sexual acts. It is noteworthy that this measure almost never concerns \nthe form of the sexual act (natural or not, normal or not), but its fre­\nquency and its moment. Quantitative and circumstantial values are all \nthat is taken into consideration. A study of Galen's great theoretical edi­\nfice shows clearly the connection established in medical and philosoph­\nical thought between sexual acts and the death of individuals. (Because \neach living being is destined to die, but the species must live eternally, \nnature invented the mechanism of sexual reproduction.) It also clearly \nshows the connection established between the sexual act and the sub­\nstantial, violent, paroxysmal, and dangerous expenditure of the vital \nprinciple that it involves. A study of regimens properly speaking (in \nRufus of Ephesus, Athenaeus, Galen, Soranus) shows, through the end­\nless precautions they recommended, the complexity and tenuousness \nof the relations established between sexual acts and the life of the indi­\nvidual: the sexual act's extreme sensitivity to all external and inter­\nnal circumstances that might make it harmful; the immense range of \neffects of every sexual act on all parts and components of the body. \n3. Married life. The treatises on marriage were quite numerous in \nthe period under study. What remains of the work of Musonius Rufus, \nAntipater of Tarsus, or Hierocles, as well as the works of Plutarch, \nshows not only the valorization of marriage (which seems to corres­\npond to a social phenomenon, according to the historians) but also a \nnew conception of the marital relationship: added to the traditional \nprinciples of the complementarity of the two sexes necessary for the \norder of the \"household\" is the ideal of a dual relation, involving every \naspect of the life of the two partners, and establishing personal emo­\ntional ties in a definitive way. Sexual acts must find their exclusive \nplace inside this relationship (a condemnation of adultery therefore, \nunderstood, by Musonius Rufus, no longer as an infringement on a hus­\nband's privileges but as a breach of the marriage tie, which binds the \nhusband as well as the wife4). So they must be directed toward pro­\ncreation, since that is the end given by the nature of marriage. And, \nfinally, they must comply with an internal regulation required by mod­\nesty, mutual affection, and respect for the other (Plutarch offers the \nmost numerous and valuable indications on this last point)."

The object was not just to study it in its theo­\nretical formulations but to analyze it in relation to a set of practices that \nwere very important in classical and late antiquity. These practices had \nto do with what was often called in Greek epimeleia heautou, and in \nLatin cura sui. This principle that one needs to \"attend to oneself,\" \nto \"take care of oneself,\" is doubtless obscured by the radiance of the \ngnothi seauton. Yet, one must bear in mind that the rule of having to \nknow oneself was regularly associated with the theme of care of the \nself. Through all the culture of antiquity it is easy to find evidence of \nthe importance given to \"concern with oneself\" and its connection with \nthe theme of self-knowledge. \nTo start with, in Socrates himself. In the Apology, one sees Socrates \npresenting himself to his judges as the teacher of self-concern.! He is \nthe man who accosts passersby and says to them: You concern your­\nself with your wealth, your reputation, and with honors, but you don't \nworry about your virtue and your soul. Socrates is the man who takes \ncare that his fellow citizens \"take care of themselves.\" Now, concern­\ning this role, Socrates says three important things, a little farther on in \nthis same Apology: it is a mission that was conferred on him by the \ndeity, and he will not give it up before his last breath; it is a disinter­\nested task for which he doesn't ask any payment, he performs it out \nof pure benevolence; and it is a useful service to the city-state, more \nuseful even than an athlete's victory at Olympia, for by teaching citi­\nzens to attend to themselves (rather than to their possessions), one also"

Instead of sentencing him, his judges would do better to reward \nSocrates for having taught others to care for themselves. \nEight centuries later, the same notion of epimeleia heautou appears \nwith an equally important role in Gregory of Nyssa. He applies this \nterm to the impulse that moves one to renounce marriage, detach one­\nself from the flesh, and, through the virginity of one's heart and body, \nregain the immortality from which one had fallen. In another passage \nof the Treatise on Virginity he makes the parable of the lost drachma \nthe model of the care of the self:2 for a lost drachma one must light \nthe lamp, ransack the house, explore every nook, until one sees the \nmetal of the coin shining in the darkness; in the same way, in order to \nrediscover the effigy that God imprinted on our soul and that the body \nhas covered with grime, one must \"take care of oneself,\" lighting the \nlamp of reason and exploring all the recesses of the soul. So it is clear \nthat Christian asceticism, like ancient philosophy, places itself under \nthe sign of the care of the self and makes the obligation to know one­\nself one of the elements of this essential care. \nBetween these two extreme references-Socrates and Gregory of \nNyssa-one can ascertain that the care of the self constituted not just a \nprinciple but a constant practice. We can consider two other examples, \nvery far apart this time in their way of thinking and their type of ethic. \nAn Epicurean text, the Letter to Menoeceus, begins in this way: \"Let \nno one when young delay to study philosophy, nor when he is old grow \nweary of his study. For no one can come too early or too late to secure \nthe health of his soul.\"3 Philosophy is assimilated to the care of the soul \n(the term is quite precisely medical: hugiainein), and this care is a task \nthat must be carried on throughout one's life. In the treatise On the \nContemplative Life, Philo thus designates a certain practice of the \nTheraputae as an epimeleia of the soul. 4 \nWe cannot stop there, however. It would be a mistake to think that \nthe care of the self was an invention of philosophical thinking and that \nit constituted a precept peculiar to the philosophical life. It was actu­\nally a precept of living that, in a general way, was very highly valued \nin Greece. Plutarch cites a Lacedaemonian aphorism that is very sig­\nnificant in this regard. 5 One day Anaxandrides was asked why his fel­\nlow countrymen, the Spartans, entrusted the cultivation of their lands \nto slaves instead of reserving this activity for themselves. This was the \nresponse: \"It was by not taking care of the fields, but of ourselves, that"

The \nadvantage afforded by wealth, status, and birth is expressed by the fact \nthat one has the possibility of attending to oneself. We may note that \nthe Roman concept of the otium has some relation to this theme: the \n\"leisure\" designated by the word is, above all, the time that one spends \nattending to oneself. In this sense, philosophy, in Greece as in Rome, \nhas only incorporated into its own requirements a much more wide­\nspread social ideal. \nIn any case, even after becoming a philosophical principle, the care \nof the self remained a form of activity. The very term epimeleia does \nnot merely designate an attitude of awareness or a form of attention \nthat one would focus on oneself; it designates a regulated occupation, a \nwork with its methods and objectives. Xenophon, for example, employs \nthe word epimeleia to designate the work of the master of the house­\nhold who supervises its farming. It is a word also used to designate the \nritual respects that are paid to the gods and to the dead. The activity \nof the sovereign who looks after his people and leads the city-state is \ncalled epimeleia by Dio of Prusa. It should be understood, then, that \nwhen the philosophers and moralists will recommend care of oneself \n(epimeleisthai heauttJ) they are not advising simply to pay attention to \noneself, to avoid mistakes or dangers or to stay out of harm's way; they \nare referring to a whole domain of complex and regulated activities. \nWe may say that in all of ancient philosophy the care of the self was \nconsidered as both a duty and a technique, a basic obligation and a set \nof carefully worked-out procedures. \nThe quite natural starting point for a study focused on the care of the \nself is the Alcibiades. 6 Three questions appear in it, relating to the \nconnection of the care of the self with politics, pedagogy, and self­\nknowledge. A comparison of the Alcibiades with the texts of the first \nand second centuries reveals several important transformations. \n1. Socrates advised Alcibiades to take advantage of his youth to look \nafter himself: \"At fifty you would be too old.\" But Epicurus said: \"When \nyoung one must not hesitate to study philosophy, and when old, one \nmust not hesitate to study philosophy. It is never too early or too late \nto take care of one's soul.\" It is this principle of constant care through­\nout life that clearly prevails. Musonius Rufus, for example: \"One must"

Epictetus, \nwho ran a school, had students who were still quite young, but he, too, \noccasionally challenged adults-and even \"statesmen\"-to turn their \nattention back to themselves. \nAttending to oneself is therefore not just a momentary preparation \nfor living; it is a form of living. Alcibiades realized that he must take \ncare of himself if he meant to attend to others. Now it becomes a mat­\nter of attending to oneself, for oneself: one should be, for oneself and \nthroughout one's existence, one's own object. \nHence the idea of conversion to oneself (ad se convertere), the idea of \nan existential impulse by which one turns in upon oneself (eis heauton \nepistrephein). Of course, the theme of the epistrophe is a typically Pla­\ntonic one. But, as one may have already seen in the Alcibiades, the \nimpulse by which the soul turns to itself is an impulse by which one's \ngaze is drawn \"aloft\" -toward the divine element, toward the essences \nand the supracelestial world where they are visible. The turning that \nSeneca, Plutarch, and Epictetus urge people to accomplish is a kind of \nturning in place: it has no other end or outcome than to settle into one­\nself, to \"take up residence in oneself\" and to remain there. The final \nobjective of the conversion to oneself is to establish a certain number \nof relations with oneself. These relations are sometimes conceived on \nthe jurido-political model: to be sovereign over oneself, to exert a per­\nfect mastery over oneself, to be completely \"self-possessed\" (fled suum, \nSeneca often says). They are also often represented on the model of \npositive enjoyment: to enjoy oneself, to take one's pleasure with one­\nself, to delight in the self alone. \n2. A second major difference concerns pedagogy. In the Alcibiades, \ncare of the self was essential because of the deficiencies of education; \nit was a matter of perfecting the latter or of taking charge of it one­\nself-in any case, of providing a \"formation.\" \nFrom the moment that applying oneself to oneself became an adult"

It is not simply a matter of shap­\ning a man of valor for the future. The individual must be given the \nweapons and the courage that will enable him to fight all his life. \nWe know how frequently two metaphors appeared: that of the ath­\nletic contest (in life one is like a wrestler who has to dispose of his \nsuccessive opponents and who must be training when he is not fight­\ning) and that of warfare (the mind must be deployed like an army \nthat an enemy is always liable to attack). \nc) But, above all, this self-cultivation has a curative and therapeu­\ntic function. It is much closer to the medical model than to the \npedagogical model. Of course, one must bear in mind certain facts \nthat are very ancient in Greek culture: the existence of a notion such \nas pathos, which denotes both mental passion and physical illness; \nthe breadth of a metaphorical field that allows one to apply to the \nbody and the mind expressions such as \"nurse,\" \"heal,\" \"amputate,\" \n\"scarify,\" \"purge.\" One should also recall the principle-familiar to \nthe Epicureans, the Cynics, the Stoics-that philosophy's role is to \nheal the diseases of the soul. Plutarch was able one day to declare \nthat philosophy and medicine constituted mia khora, a single area, \na single domain. Epictetus did not want his school to be regarded \nmerely as a place of education but also as a \"medical clinic,\" an \niatreion; he intended it to be a \"dispensary for the soul\"; he wanted \nhis students to arrive thinking of themselves as patients: \"One man \nhas a dislocated shoulder, another an abcess, another a headache.\" \n3. In the first and second centuries, the relation to the self is always \nconsidered as needing to rely on the relation to a teacher, to a direc­\ntor, or in any case to another person. Yet this presupposed a growing \nindependence from the love relation. \nIt was a generally accepted principle that one could not attend to \noneself without the help of another. Seneca said that no one was ever \nstrong enough on his own to get out of the state of stultitia he was in:"

This \nprinciple is true for beginners but also for what follows, and even to \nthe end of one's life. Seneca's attitude, in his correspondence with \nLucilius, is characteristic: no matter that he is aged, having given up \nall his activities, he gives counsel to Lucilius but asks him for advice in \nreturn and is thankful for the help he finds in this exchange of letters. \nWhat is remarkable in this soul practice is the variety of social rela­\ntions that can serve as its support. \n• There are the strictly educational organizations: Epictetus's school \ncan serve as an example. Temporary auditors were given a place \nnext to students who remained for a longer course of study; but \ninstruction was also given to those who aspired to become philos­\nophers and soul directors themselves. Some of the Discourses col­\nlected by Arrian are technical lessons for future practitioners of \nself-cultivation. 7 \n• One also finds private counselors, especially in Rome: installed in \nthe entourage of a great personage, being part of his group of clien­\ntele, they would give political opinions, supervise the education of \nthe young people, and provide assistance in the important circum­\nstances of life. For example, Demetrius in the entourage of Thrasea \nPactus; when the latter was led to take his own life, Demetrius \nserved him as a kind of suicide counselor and braced his final \nmoments with a discourse on immortality. \n• But there are many other forms in which this soul direction is car­\nried out. The latter joins and animates a whole set of other rela­\ntions: family relations (Seneca writes a consolation to his mother \non the occasion of his own exile); relations of protection (the same \nSeneca looks after both the career and the soul of the young Serenus, \na provincial cousin newly arrived at Rome); relations of friendship \nbetween two persons rather close in age, culture, and situation \n(Seneca with Lucilius); relations with a highly placed personage to \nwhom one pays homage by offering him useful advice (thus Plu­\ntarch with Fundanus, to whom he rushes the notes he himself has \ntaken concerning the tranquility of the soul)."

The correspondence of Marcus Aurelius with Fronto can serve \nas an example of that intensity and complexity. \nThis cultivation of the self comprised a set of practices designated by \nthe general team askesis. It is appropriate first to analyze its objectives. \nIn a passage cited by Seneca, Demetrius resorts to the very common \nmetaphor of the athlete; the athlete does not learn all the possible \nmoves, he does not attempt to do useless feats; he practices the few \nmoves that he needs to triumph over his opponents in the wrestling \nmatch. In the same way, we do not have to perform feats on ourselves \n(philosophical ascesis looks with suspicion on those figures who point \nto the marvels of their abstinences, their fasts, their foreknowledge of \nthe future). Like a good wrestler, we must learn only what will enable \nus to bear up against events that may occur; we must learn not to let \nourselves be thrown by them, and not to let ourselves be overwhelmed \nby the emotions they may give rise to in ourselves. \nNow, what do we need in order to keep our control in the face of \nthe events that may take place?

The question of their nature. There were numerous discussions \non this point between the philosophical schools and within the same \ncurrents. The main controversy had to do with the need for theoreti­\ncal knowledge. On this point, the Epicureans were all in agreement: \nknowing the principles that govern the world, the nature of the gods, \nthe causes of the wonders, the laws of life and death, and so on is \nabsolutely necessary, in their view, if one is to prepare for the possible \nevents of existence.

Seneca's Letters 90-91 layout the opposing arguments very \nclearly. 8 What should be noted here is that those true discourses we \nneed relate only to what we are in our connection with the world, in \nour place in the natural order, and in our dependence or independence \nwith respect to the events that occur. They are in no way a decipher­\nment of our thoughts, our representations, our desires. \n2. The second question raised concerns how these true discourses \nexist inside us. To say that they are necessary for our future is to say \nthat we must be able to have recourse to them when the need is felt. \nWhen an unforeseen event or misfortune presents itself, we must be \nable to call upon the relevant true discourses in order to protect our­\nselves; they must be at our disposal within us. The Greeks have a com­\nmon expression for this, prokheiron ekhein, which the Latins translate \nas habere in manu, in promptu habere-to have near at hand. \nOne needs to understand that this involves something very different \nfrom a simple memory that would be recalled when the occasion arose. \nPlutarch, for example, calls on several metaphors to characterize the \npresence in us of these true discourses. He compares them to a medi­\ncine (pharmakon) we should be supplied with for protection against \nall the vicissitudes of existence. (Marcus Aurelius compares them to the \ninstrument kit that a surgeon must always have near at hand.) Plutarch \nalso speaks of them as being like those friends \"the surest and best of \nwhich are those whose useful presence in adversity lends assistance to \nus.\" Elsewhere he evokes them as an inner voice that insists on being \nheard when the passions stir: these discourses must be in us \"like a \nmaster whose voice is enough to hush the growling of the dogs.\" In a \npassage of the De Benificiis, one finds a gradation of this sort, going \nfrom the instrument at one's disposal to the automatism of a discourse \nthat would speak within us of its own volition. 9 Concerning advice \ngiven by Demetrius, Seneca says that one must \"grasp it with both \nhands\" (utraque manu) and never let go; but also \"cling\" to it, attach \n(adfigere) it to one's mind, \"making it a part of oneself\" (partem sui \nfacere), and finally, \"by daily meditation reach the point where these \nwholesome maxims occur of their own accord.\" \nHere we see a movement very different from the one prescribed by \nPlato when he asks the soul to turn back on itself to rediscover its true \nnature.

In a practice such as this, \none does not rediscover a truth hidden deep within oneself through an \nimpulse of recollection; one internalizes accepted texts through a more \nand more thorough appropriation. \n3. So a series of technical questions crops up concerning the meth­\nods of this appropriation. Obviously, memory plays a large role in it­\nthough not in the Platonic form of the soul rediscovering its original \nnature and its homeland but, rather, in the form of progressive exer­\ncises of memorization. I would merely like to indicate some of the \nsalient points in this \"ascesis\" of truth: \n• the importance of listening. Whereas Socrates questioned people \nand tried to get them to say what they knew (without knowing that \nthey knew it), for the Stoics or the Epicureans (as in the Pythago­\nrean sects) the disciple must at first keep silent and listen. One \nfinds in Plutarch, or in Philo of Alexandria, a whole set of rules for \nproper listening (the physical posture to take, how to direct one's \nattention, the way to retain what has been said); \n• the importance, too, of writing. In this period, there was a cultiva­\ntion of what might be called \"personal writing\": taking notes on \nthe readings, conversations, and reflections that one hears or has \nor does; keeping notebooks of one sort or another on important \nsubjects (what the Greeks called hupomnemata), which must be \nreread from time to time in order to reactualize what they contain; \n• and the importance of habitual self-reflection, but in the sense of \nexercises for committing to memory the things that one has learned. \nThat is the exact technical meaning of the expression anakhoresis \neis heauton, as Marcus Aurelius uses it: to come back inside one­\nself and examine the \"riches\" that one has deposited there; one \nmust have within oneself a kind of book that one rereads from time \nto time. This corresponds to the practice of the arts of memory that \nFrances Yates has studied. \nSo we have a whole set of techniques whose purpose is to link to­\ngether truth and the subject. But there should be no misunderstanding: \nit is not a matter of uncovering a truth in the subject or of making the \nsoul the place where truth resides, through an essential kinship or an"

We are still very far from what would be a herme­\nneutic of the subject. The object, rather, is to arm the subject with a \ntruth it did not know, one that did not reside in it; what is wanted is \nto make this learned, memorized truth, progressively put into practice, \na quasi subject that reigns supreme in us. \nOne can distinguish between those exercises carried out in a real situ­\nation, which basically constitute training in endurance and abstinence, \nand those which constitute training in thought by means of thought. \n1. The most famous of these thought exercises was the praemeditatio \nma/orum, a meditation on future ills. It was also one of the most dis­\nputed: the Epicureans rejected it, saying that it was useless to suffer \nin advance ills that had not yet come to pass, and that it was better to \npractice calling up the memory of past pleasures as a protection against \npresent ills. The strict Stoics, such as Seneca or Epictetus, but also men \nlike Plutarch, whose attitude toward Stoicism is very ambivalent, prac­\ntice the praemeditatio ma/orum assiduously. One needs to be clear \nabout what it consists in: it appears to be a somber, pessimistic antici­\npation of the future. In reality, it is something quite different. \nIn the first place, it is a matter not of visualizing the future as it is \nlikely to be but, rather, very systematically imagining the worst that \nmight happen, even if it is not at all likely to happen. Seneca says con­\ncerning a fire that h&d destroyed the town of Lyons: this example ought \nto teach us to regard the worst as always certain. \n• Further, these things should not be considered as a possibility in the \nrelatively distant future, but envisioned as already present, already \noccurring. Let us imagine, for example, that we are already exiled, \nalready subjected to torture. \n• Finally, if one pictures them in their actuality, this is not in order \nto experience beforehand the pain or suffering they would cause \nus but to persuade ourselves that they are not in any sense real \ntroubles, and that only the opinion we have of them lets them be \ntaken for true misfortunes. \nClearly then, this exercise consists not in contemplating a possible \nfuture of real evils, as a way of getting used to it, but in neutraliz-"

The future, since one envisions it as \nalready given in an extreme actuality; the evil, since one practices no \nlonger thinking of it as such. \n2. At the other end of these exercises, one finds those carried out in \nreality. These exercises had a long tradition behind them: they were \npractices of abstinence, privation, or physical resistance. They could \nhave a purificatory value or attest the \"demonic\" strength of the per­\nson who practiced them. Yet in the cultivation of the self, these exer­\ncises have another meaning: it is a matter of establishing and testing \nthe individual's independence relative to the external world. \nTwo examples. The first in Plutarch, On the Daemon of Socrates. 10 \nOne of the speakers alludes to a practice, whose origin, moreover, he \nattributes to the Pythagoreans: first, one engages in athletic activities \nthat whet the appetite; then one takes his place before tables laden with \nthe most savory dishes; and, after gazing upon them, one gives them \nto the servants while taking the simple and frugal nourishment of a \npoor man for oneself. \nIn Letter 18, Seneca relates that the whole town is getting ready for \nthe Saturnalia. He plans, for reasons of expediency, to take part in the \nfestivities, at least after a fashion; but his preparation will for several \ndays consist in wearing a coarse cloak, sleeping on a pallet, and nour­\nishing himself only with hard bread. This is not in order to build an \nappetite for the feasts-it is to establish both that poverty is not an evil \nand that he is fully capable of bearing it. Other passages, in Seneca \nhimself or in Epicurus, evoke the usefulness of these short periods of \nvoluntary trials. Musonius Rufus also recommends periods spent in \nthe country where one lives like the peasants, devoting oneself to farm \nwork as they do. \n3. Between the pole of the meditatio, where one practices in thought, \nand the pole of the exercitatio, where one trains in reality, there is a \nwhole series of other possible practices designed for proving oneself. \nIn particular, Epictetus gives examples of these in the Discourses. \nThey are interesting because quite similar ones will be found again in \nChristian spirituality. They are especially concerned with what one \nmight call the \"control of representations.\" \nEpictetus insists that one must be in an attitude of constant super­\nvision over the representations that may enter the mind. He expresses \nthis attitude in two metaphors: that of the night watchman who does \nnot let just anyone come into the town or the house; and that of the"

In Epictetus something else \nis at issue: one needs to determine whether or not one is affected or \nmoved by the thing that is represented, and what reason one has for \nbeing or not being affected in that way. \nWith this in view, Epictetus recommends to his students an exer­\ncise of control inspired by the Sophistic challenges that were so highly \nregarded in the schools; but instead of tackling one or another of the \nquestions difficult to resolve, one will address types of situations that \ndemand a reaction: \"Someone's son has died.-Respond: That is be­\nyond our power, so it is not an evil.-Someone's father has disinherited \nhim. What do you think about it?-It is beyond our power, it is not an \nevil ... -He was distressed about it.-That does concern us, it is an \nevil.-He bore it courageously.- That concerns us, it is a good.\" \nOne can see that this control of representations is not aimed at \nuncovering, beneath appearances, a hidden truth that would be that of \nthe subject itself; rather, it finds in these representations, as they pre­\nsent themselves, the occasion for recalling to mind a certain number of \ntrue principles-concerning death, illness, suffering, political life, and \nso on; and by means of this reminder one can see if he is able to respond \nin accordance with such principles-if they have really become, accord­\ning to Plutarch's metaphor, that voice of the master which is raised as \nsoon as the passions growl and is able to silence them. \n4.

In Letter 12, he \nsays: \"Let us go to our sleep with joy and gladness; let us say; I have \nlived.\" It is this same type of exercise that Marcus Aurelius was think­\ning of when he wrote that \"moral perfection requires that one spend \neach day as if it were the last\" (7.69). He would even have it that every \naction he performed be done \"as if it were the last\" (2.5). \nWhat accounts for the particular value of the death meditation is \nnot just the fact that it anticipates what is generally held to be the \ngreatest misfortune; it is not just that it enables one to convince one­\nself that death is not an evil; it offers the possibility of looking back, in \nadvance as it were, on one's life. By thinking of oneself as being about \nto die, one can judge each action that one is performing in terms of \nits own value.

As for the person answering the ques­\ntions, he too exercises a right that does not go beyond the discussion \nitself; by the logic of his own discourse, he is tied to what he has said \nearlier, and by the acceptance of dialogue he is tied to the questioning \nof the other.

On prin­\nciple, he possesses rights authorizing him to wage war and making that \nstruggle a just undertaking; the person he confronts is not a partner \nin the search for the truth but an adversary, an enemy who is wrong, \nwho is harmful, and whose very existence constitutes a threat. For him, \nthen, the game consists not of recognizing this person as a subject hav­\ning the right to speak but of abolishing him, as interlocutor, from any \npossible dialogue; and his final objective will be not to come as close \nas possible to a difficult truth but to bring about the triumph of the just \ncause he has been manifestly upholding from the beginning. The polem­\nicist relies on a legitimacy that his adversary is by definition denied. \nPerh~ps, someday, a long history will have to be written of polem­\nics, polemics as a parasitic figure on discussion and an obstacle to the \nsearch for the truth. Very schematically, it seems to me that today we \ncan recognize the presence in polemics of three models: the religiOUS \nmodel, the judiciary model, and the political model. As in heresiology, \npolemics sets itself the task of determining the intangible point of \ndogma, the fundamental and necessary principle that the adversary has \nneglected, ignored, or transgressed; and it denounces this negligence \nas a moral failing; at the root of the error, it finds passion, desire, inter­\nest, a whole series of weaknesses and inadmissible attachments that \nestablish it as culpable. As in judiciary practice, polemics allows for no \npossibility of an equal discussion: it examines a case; it isn't dealing \nwith an interlocutor, it is processing a suspect; it collects the proofs of \nhis guilt, designates the infraction he has committed, and pronounces \nthe verdict and sentences him. In any case, what we have here is not \non the order of a shared investigation; the polemicist tells the truth \nin the form of his judgment and by virtue of the authority he has con­\nferred on himself. But it is the political model that is the most power­\nful today. Polemics defines alliances, recruits partisans, unites interests \nor opinions, represents a party; it establishes the other as an enemy, \nan upholder of opposed interests against which one must fight until the \nmoment this enemy is defeated and either surrenders or disappears. \nOf course, the reactivation, in polemics, of these political, judiciary, \nor religious practices is nothing more than theater.

And how could it be otherwise, given \nthat here the interlocutors are incited not to advance, not to take more \nand more risks in what they say, but to fall back continually on the \nrights that they claim, on their legitimacy, which they must defend, and \non the affirmation of their innocence?

It is true that my attitude isn't a result of the form \nof critique that claims to be a methodical examination in order to reject \nall possible solutions except for the one valid one. It is more on the \norder of \"problematization\"-which is to say, the development of a \ndomain of acts, practices, and thoughts that seem to me to pose prob­\nlems for politics. For example, I don't think that in regard to madness \nand mental illness there is any \"politics\" that can contain the just and \ndefinitive solution. But I think that in madness, in derangement, in \nbehavior problems, there are reasons for questioning politics; and poli­\ntics must answer these questions, but it never answers them completely. \nThe same is true for crime and punishment: naturally, it would be \nwrong to imagine that politics has nothing to do with the prevention \nand punishment of crime, and therefore nothing to do with a certain \nnumber of elements that modify its form, its meaning, its frequency; \nbut it would be just as wrong to think that there is a political formula \nlikely to resolve the question of crime and put an end to it. The same \nis true of sexuality: it doesn't exist apart from a relationship to politi­\ncal structures, requirements, laws, and regulations that have a primary \nimportance for it; and yet one can't expect politics to provide the forms \nin which sexuality would cease to be a problem. \nIt is a question, then, of thinking about the relations of these differ­\nent experiences to politics, which doesn't mean that one will seek in \npolitics the main constituent of these experiences or the solution that \nwill definitively settle their fate. The problems that experiences like \nthese pose to politics have to be elaborated. But it is also necessary to \ndetermine what \"posing a problem\" to politics really means. Richard \nRorty points out that in these analyses I do not appeal to any \"we\"-to \nany of those \"wes\" whose consensus, whose values, whose traditions \nconstitute the framework for a thought and define the conditions in \nwhich it can be validated.

Laing, Cooper, Basaglia, and I had no community, nor any \nrelationship; but the problem posed itself to those who had read us, \nas it also posed itself to some of us, of seeing if it were possible to estab­\nlish a \"we\" on the basis of the work that had been done, a \"we\" that \nwould also be likely to form a community of action. \nI have never tried to analyze anything whatsoever from the point of \nview of politics, but always to ask politics what it had to say about the \nproblems with which it was confronted. I question it about the posi­\ntions it takes and the reasons it gives for this; I don't ask it to deter­\nmine the theory of what I do. I am neither an adversary nor a partisan \nof Marxism; I question it about what it has to say about experiences \nthat ask questions of it. \nAs for the events of May 1968, it seems to me they depend on another \nproblematic. I wasn't in France at that time; I only returned several \nmonths later. And it seemed to me one could recognize completely con­\ntradictory elements in it: on the one hand, an effort, which was very \nwidely asserted, to ask politics a whole series of questions that were \nnot traditionally a part of its statutory domain (questions about women, \nabout relations between the sexes, about medicine, about mental ill­\nness, about the environment, about minorities, about delinquency); \nand, on the other hand, a desire to rewrite all these problems in the \nvocabulary of a theory that was derived more or less directly from Marx­\nism. But the process that was evident at that time led not to taking over \nthe problems posed by the Marxist doctrine but, on the contrary, to a \nmore and more manifest powerlessness on the part of Marxism to con­\nfront these problems. So that one found oneself faced with interroga­\ntions that were addressed to politics but had not themselves sprung \nfrom a political doctrine. From this point of view, such a liberation of \nthe act of questioning seemed to me to have played a positive role: \nnow there was a plurality of questions posed to politics rather than \nthe reinscription of the act of questioning in the framework of a politi­\ncal doctrine. \nP.R.

No doubt one could say that in some sense I try to analyze the \nrelations among science, politics, and ethics; but I don't think that \nwould be an entirely accurate representation of the work I set out to \ndo. I don't want to remain at that level; rather, I am trying to see how \nthese processes may have interfered with one another in the formation \nof a scientific domain, a political structure, a moral practice. Let's take \npsychiatry as an example: no doubt, one can analyze it today in its epis­\ntemological structure-even if that is still rather loose; one can also \nanalyze it within the framework of the political institutions in which it \noperates; one can also study it in its ethical implications, as regards the \nperson who is the object of the psychiatry as much as the psychiatrist \nhimself. But my goal hasn't been to do this; rather, I have tried to see \nhow the formation of psychiatry as a science, the limitation of its field, \nand the definition of its object implicated a political structure and a \nmoral practice: in the twofold sense that they were presupposed by the \nprogressive organization of psychiatry as a science, and that they were \nalso changed by this development. Psychiatry as we know it couldn't \nhave existed without a whole interplay of political structures and with­\nout a set of ethical attitudes; but inversely, the establishment of mad­\nness as a domain of knowledge [savoir] changed the political practices \nand the ethical attitudes that concerned it. It was a matter of determin­\ning the role of politics and ethics in the establishment of madness as a \nparticular domain of scientific knowledge [connaissance], and also of \nanalyzing the effects of the latter on political and ethical practices. \nThe same is true in relation to delinquency. It was a question of \nseeing which political strategy had, by giving its status to criminality, \nbeen able to appeal to certain forms of knowledge [savoir] and certain \nmoral attitudes; it was also a question of seeing how these modalities \nof knowledge [connaissance] and these forms of morality could have \nbeen reflected in, and changed by, these disciplinary techniques. In \nthe case of sexuality it was the development of a moral attitude that \nI wanted to isolate; but I tried to reconstruct it through the play it \nengaged in with political structures (essentially in the relation between \nself-control [maitrise de SOlJ and domination of others) and with the \nmodalities of knowledge [connaissance] (self-knowledge and knowl­\nedge of different areas of activity). \nSo that in these three areas-madness, delinquency, and sexuality­\nI emphasized a particular aspect each time: the establishment of a cer­\ntain objectivity, the development of a politics and a government of the"

And if each of these examples emphasizes, in a certain way, one \nof these three aspects-since the experience of madness was recently \norganized as primarily a field of knowledge [savoir], that of crime as \nan area of political intervention, while that of sexuality was defined as \nan ethical position-each time I have tried to show how the two other \nelements were present, what roles they played, and how each one was \naffected by the transformations in the other two. \nP.R. You have recently been talking about a \"history of problemat­\nics.\" What is a history of problematics? \nM.F. For a long time, I have been trying to see if it would be pos­\nsible to describe the history of thought as distinct both from the his­\ntory of ideas (by which I mean the analysis of systems of representation) \nand from the history of mentalities (by which I mean the analysis of \nattitudes and types of action [schemas de comportement]). It seemed \nto me there was one element that was capable of describing the history \nof thought-this was what one could call the element of problems or, \nmore exactly, problematizations. What distinguishes thought is that it \nis something quite different from the set of representations that under­\nlies a certain behavior; it is also something quite different from the \ndomain of attitudes that can determine this behavior. Thought is not \nwhat inhabits a certain conduct and gives it its meaning; rather, it is \nwhat allows one to step back from this way of acting or reacting, to \npresent it to oneself as an object of thought and to question it as to its \nmeaning, its conditions, and its goals. Thought is freedom in relation \nto what one does, the motion by which one detaches oneself from it, \nestablishes it as an object, and reflects on it as a problem. \nTo say that the study of thought is the analysis of a freedom does \nnot mean one is dealing with a formal system that has reference only \nto itself. Actually, for a domain of action, a behavior, to enter the field \nof thought, it is necessary for a certain number of factors to have made \nit uncertain, to have made it lose its familiarity, or to have provoked a \ncertain number of difficulties around it.

In the same way, a \nwhole group of solutions was proposed for the difficulties encountered \nin the second half of the eighteenth century by penal practice.

It is problematization that responds to these difficulties, \nbut by doing something quite other than expressing them or manifest­\ning them: in connection with them, it develops the conditions in which \npossible responses can be given; it defines the elements that will con­\nstitute what the different solutions attempt to respond to.

I was actually in a position \nbetween the staff and the patients, and it wasn't my merit, it wasn't \nbecause I had a special attitude-it was the consequence of this ambi­\nguity in my status which forced me to maintain a distance from the \nstaff.

It was only a few years later when I \nstarted writing a book on the history of psychiatry that this malaise, \nthis personal experience, took the form of a historical criticism or a \nstructural analysis."

It was one of the best in Paris. No, \nit was not terrible.

I also remember refugees from Spain arriving in Poitiers. I re­\nmember fighting in school with my classmates about the Ethiopian \nWar. I think that boys and girls of this generation had their childhood \nformed by these great historical events. The menace of war was our \nbackground, our framework of existence. Then the war arrived. Much \nmore than the activities of family life, it was these events concerning \nthe world which are the substance of our memory. I say \"our\" because \nI am nearly sure that most boys and girls in France at this moment had \nthe same experience. Our private life was really threatened.

We did not \nknow when I was ten or eleven years old whether we would become \nGerman or remain French. We did not know whether we would die \nor not in the bombing and so on. When I was sixteen or seventeen, I \nknew only one thing: school life was an environment protected from \nexterior menaces, from politics. And I have always been fascinated by \nliving protected in a scholarly environment, in an intellectual milieu. \nKnowledge is for me that which must function as a protection of indi­\nvidual existence and as a comprehension of the exterior world. I think \nthat's it. Knowledge as a means of surviving by understanding. \nS.R. Could you tell me a bit about your studies in Paris? Is there any­\none who had a special influence upon the work that you do today or \nany professors you are grateful to for personal reasons? \nM.F. No, I was a pupil of Althusser, and at that time the main phil­\nosophical currents in France were Marxism, Hegelianism, and phenom­\nenology. I must say, I have studied these but what gave me for the first \ntime the desire of doing personal work was reading Nietzsche. \nS.R. An audience that is non-French is likely to have a very poor \nunderstanding of the aftermath of the May rebellion of '68, and you \nhave sometimes said that it resulted in people being more responsive \nto your work. Can you explain why? \nM.F. I think that before '68, at least in France, you had to be as a \nphilosopher a Marxist, or a phenomenologist or a structuralist, and I \nadhered to none of these dogmas. The second point is that at this time \nin France studying psychiatry or the history of medicine had no real \nstatus in the political field. Nobody was interested in that. The first \nthing that happened after '68 was that Marxism as a dogmatic frame­\nwork declined and new political, new cultural interests concerning per­\nsonal life appeared. That's why I think my work had nearly no echo, \nwith the exception of a very small circle, before '68. \nS.R. Some of the works you refer to in the first volume of The His­\ntory of Sexuality, such as the Victorian book My Secret Life, are filled \nwith sexual fantasies. It is often impossible to distinguish between fact \nand fantasy. Would there be a value in your focusing explicitly upon \nsexual fantasies and creating an archaeology of them rather than one \nof sexuality? \nM.F. [Laughs] No, I don't try to write an archaeology of sexual fan­\ntasies.

That's the point. It's not a problem of fan­\ntasy; it's a problem of verbalization. \nS.R. Could you explain how you arrived at the idea that the sex­\nual repression that characterized eighteenth- and nineteenth-century \nEurope and North America, and which seemed so well documented \nhistorically, was in fact ambiguous, and that there were beneath it \nforces working in the opposite direction? \nM.F. Indeed, it is not a question of denying the existence of repres­\nsion. It's one of showing that repression is always a part of a much \nmore complex political strategy regarding sexuality. Things are not \nmerely repressed. There is about sexuality a lot of defective regula­\ntions in which the negative effects of inhibition are counterbalanced by \nthe positive effects of stimulation. The way in which sexuality in the \nnineteenth century was both repressed but also put in light, underlined, \nanalyzed through techniques like psychology and psychiatry shows very \nwell that it was not simply a question of repression. It was much more \na change in the economics of sexual behavior in our society. \nS.R. In your opinion, what are some of the most striking examples \nthat support your hypothesis? \nM.F. One of them is children's masturbation. Another is hysteria \nand all the fuss about hysterical women. These two examples show, of \ncourse, repression, prohibition, interdiction, and so on; but the fact \nthat the sexuality of children became a real problem for the parents, \nan issue, a source of anxiety, had a lot of effects upon the children and \nupon the parents. To take care of the sexuality of their children was \nnot only a question of morality for the parents but also a question of \npleasure. \nS.R. A pleasure in what sense? \nM.F. Sexual excitement and sexual satisfaction. \nS.F. For the parents themselves? \nM.F. Yes. Call it rape, if you like. There are texts that are very close \nto a systemization of rape. Rape by the parents of the sexual activity of \ntheir children. To intervene in this personal, secret activity, which mas­\nturbation was, does not represent something neutral for the parents. \nIt is not only a matter of power, or authority, or ethics; it's also a plea­\nsure.

It was also a reason for the intensi­\nfication of this activity, for mutual masturbation and for the pleasure \nof secret communication between children about this theme. All this \nhas given a certain shape to family life, to the relationship between chil­\ndren and parents, and to the relations between children. All that has, \nas a result, [brought about] not only repression but an intensification \nboth of anxieties and of pleasures. I don't want to say that the pleasure \nof the parents was the same as that of the children, or that there was \nno repression. I tried to find the roots of this absurd prohibition. \nOne of the reasons why this stupid interdiction of masturbation was \nmaintained for such a long time was because of this pleasure and anx­\niety and all the emotional network around it. Everyone knows. very well \nthat it's impossible to prevent a child from masturbating. There is no \nscientific evidence that it harms anybody. [Laughs] One can be sure \nthat it is at least the only pleasure that really harms nobody. Why has \nit been forbidden for such a long time then? To the best of my knowl­\nedge, you cannot find more than two or three references in all the \nGreco-Latin literature about masturbation. It was not relevant. It was \nsupposed to be, in Greek and Latin civilization, an activity either for \nslaves or for satyrs. [Laughs] It was not relevant to speak about it for \nfree citizens. \nS.R. We live at a point in time when there is great uncertainty about \nthe future. One sees apocalyptic visions of the future reflected widely \nin popular culture. Louis Malle's My Dinner with Andre, for example. \nIsn't it typical that, in such a climate, sex and reproduction come to \nbe a preoccupation and thus writing a history of sexuality would be \nsymptomatic of the time? \nM.F. No, I don't think I would agree with that. First, the preoccu­\npation with the relationship between sexuality and reproduction seems \nto have been stronger, for instance, in the Greek and Roman societies \nand in the bourgeois society of the eighteenth and nineteenth centu­\nries. No. What strikes me is the fact that now sexuality seems to be a \nquestion without direct relation with reproduction. It is your sexuality \nas your personal behavior which is the problem. \nTake homosexuality, for instance. I think that one of the reasons \nwhy homosexual behavior was not an important issue in the eighteenth \ncentury was due to the view that if a man had children, what he did \nbesides that had little importance.

It is very interesting to see \nthat, before the nineteenth century, forbidden behavior-even if it \nwas very severely judged-was always considered to be an excess, a \n\"libertinage,\" as something too much. Homosexual behavior was only \nconsidered to be a kind of excess of natural behavior, an instinct that \nis difficult to keep within certain limits. From the nineteenth century \non, you see that behavior like homosexuality came to be considered \nan abnormality. When I say that it was libertinage, I don't say that it \nwas tolerated. \nI think that the idea of characterizing individuals through their sex­\nual behavior or desire is not to be found, or very rarely, before the nine­\nteenth century. \"Tell me your desires, I'll tell you who you are.\" This \nquestion is typical of the nineteenth century. \nS.R. It would not seem any longer that sex could be called the secret \nof life. Has anything replaced it in this respect? \nM.F. Of course it is not the secret of life now, since people can show \nat least certain general forms of their sexual preferences without being \nplagued or condemned. But I think that people still consider, and are \ninvited to consider, that sexual desire is able to reveal what is their deep \nidentity. Sexuality is not the secret, but it is still a symptom, a mani­\nfestation of what is the most secret in our individuality. \nS.R. The next question I would like to ask may at first seem odd, \nand if it does I'll explain why I thought it was worth asking. Does \nbeauty have special meaning for you? \nM.F. I think it does for everyone. [Laughs] I am nearsighted but not \nblind to the point that it has no meaning for me. Why do you ask? I'm \nafraid I have given you proof that I am not insensitive to beauty. \nS.R. One of the things about you that is very impressive is the sort \nof monachal austerity in which you live.

While in Toronto during the past month \nyou have on several occasions worn clothes as simple as white pants, a \nwhite T-shirt and a black leather jacket. You suggested that perhaps the \nreason you like the color white so much is that in Poitiers during the \nthirties and forties it was impossible for the exterior of houses to be \ngenuinely white.

Yes, sure. Of course French culture gives no place to music, or \nnearly no place. But it's a fact that in my personal life music played a \ngreat role. The first friend I had when I was twenty was a musician. \nThen afterward, I had another friend who was a composer and who is \ndead now. Through him I know all the generation of Boulez. It has \nbeen a very important experience for me. First, because I had contact \nwith the kind of art which was, for me, really enigmatic. I was not com­\npetent at all in this domain; I'm still not. But I felt beauty in something \nthat was quite enigmatic for me. There are some pieces by Bach and \nWebern I enjoy, but what is, for me, real beauty is a \"phrase musicale, \nun morceau de musique,\" that I cannot understand, something I can­\nnot say anything about.

Is there a special kinship between your kind of philosophy and \nthe arts in general? \nM.F. Well, I think I am not in a position to answer.

There­\nfore, we have to work at becoming homosexuals and not be obstinate \nin recognizing that we are. The development toward which the prob­\nlem of homosexuality tends is the one of friendship. \nQ. Did you think so at twenty, or have you discovered it over the \nyears? \nM.F. As far back as I remember, to want guys [gar~ons] was to want \nrelations with guys. That has always been important for me.

Between a man and a younger woman, \nthe marriage institution makes it easier: she accepts it and makes it \nwork. But two men of noticeably different ages-what code would allow \nthem to communicate?

The institution is caught in \na contradiction; affective intensities traverse it which at one and the \nsame time keep it going and shake it up. Look at the army, where love \nbetween men is ceaselessly provoked [appete] and shamed. Institutional \ncodes can't validate these relations with multiple intensities, variable \ncolors, imperceptible movements and changing forms. These relations \nshort-circuit it and introduce love where there's supposed to be only \nlaw, rule, or habit. \nQ. You were saying a little while ago: \"Rather than crying about \nfaded pleasures, I'm interested in what we ourselves can do.\" Could \nyou explain that more precisely? \nM.F. Asceticism as the renunciation of pleasure has bad connota­\ntions. But ascesis is something else: it's the work that one performs on \noneself in order to transform oneself or make the self appear which, \nhappily, one never attains. Can that be our problem today? We've rid \nourselves of asceticism. Yet it's up to us to advance into a homosexual \nascesis that would make us work on ourselves and invent-I do not say \ndiscover-a manner of being that is still improbable. \nQ. That means that a young homosexual must be very cautious in \nregard to homosexual imagery; he must work at something else? \nM.F. What we must work on, it seems to me, is not so much to lib­\nerate our desires but to make ourselves infinitely more susceptible to \npleasure [plazSirs]. We must escape and help others to escape the two \nreadymade formulas of the pure sexual encounter and the lovers' fusion \nof identities. \nQ. Can one see the first fruits of strong constructive relationships in \nthe United States, in any case in the cities where the problem of sex­\nual misery seems under control? \nM.F. To me, it appears certain that in the United States, even if the \nbasis of sexual misery still exists, the interest in friendship has become \nvery important; one doesn't enter a relationship simply in order to be \nable to consummate it sexually, which happens very easily. But toward \nfriendship, people are very polarized. How can a relational system be \nreached through sexual practices? Is it possible to create a homosex­\nual mode oflife? \nThis notion of mode of life seems important to me.

It seems to me that a way of life can yield a culture \nand an ethics.

Yes, like the great myth of saying: There will no longer be any \ndifference between homo-and heterosexuality. Moreover, I think that \nit's one of the reasons that homosexuality presents a problem today. \nMany sexual liberation movements project this idea of \"liberating your­\nself from the hideous constraints that weigh upon you.\" Yet the affir­\nmation that to be a homosexual is for a man to love another man-this \nsearch for a way of life runs counter to the ideology of the sexual lib­\neration movements of the sixties.

Let me begin by asking you to respond to John Boswell's recent \nbook on the history of homosexuality from the beginning of the Chris­\ntian era through the Middle Ages.! As an historian yourself, do you find \nhis methodology valid? To what extent do you think the conclusions \nhe draws contribute to a better understanding of what homosexuality \nis today? \nM.F. This is certainly a very important study whose originality is \nalready evident from the way in which it poses the question. Methodo­\nlogically speaking, the rejection by Boswell of the categorical opposition \nbetween homosexual and heterosexual, which plays such a significant \nrole in the way our culture conceives of homosexuality, represents an \nadvance not only in scholarship but in cultural criticism as well. His \nintroduction of the concept of \"gay\" (in the way he defines it) provides \nus both with a useful instrument of research and, at the same time, a \nbetter comprehension of how people actually conceive of themselves \nand their sexual behavior. On the level of investigative results, this \nmethodology has led to the discovery that what has been called the \n\"repression\" of homosexuality does not date back to Christianity prop­\nerly speaking but developed within the Christian era at a much later \ndate. In this type of analysis it is important to be aware of the way in \nwhich people conceived of their own sexuality.

It is in this sense that I think the concept \"gay\" con­\ntributes to a positive (rather than a purely negative) appreciation of the \ntype of consciousness in which affection, love, desire, sexual rapport \nwith people have a positive significance. \nJ.O'H. I understand that your own recent work has led you to a study \nof sexuality as it was experienced in ancient Greece. \nM.F. Yes, and precisely Boswell's book has provided me with a guide \n. for what to look for in the meaning people attached to their sexual \nbehavior. \nJ.O'H. Does this focus on cultural context and people's discourse \nabout their sexual behavior reflect a methodological decision to bypass \nthe distinction between innate predisposition to homosexual behavior \nand social conditioning?

Of course, \nthis aspect of their collective consciousness changes over time and \nvaries from place to place. It has, for instance, on different occasions \ntaken the form of membership in a kind of secret society, membership \nin a cursed race, membership in a segment of humanity at once privi­\nleged and persecuted-all kinds of different modes of collective con­\nsciousness, just as, incidentally, the consciousness of unskilled laborers \nhas undergone numerous transformations. It is true that more recently \ncertain homosexuals have, following the political model, developed or \ntried to create a certain class consciousness. My impression is that this \nhasn't really been a success, whatever the political consequences it may \nhave had, because homosexuals do not constitute a social class. This \nis not to say that one can't imagine a society in which homosexuals \nwould constitute a social class. But in our present economic and social \nmode of organization, I don't see this coming to pass. \nAs for the political goals of the homosexual movement, two points \ncan be made. First, there is the question of freedom of sexual choice \nwhich must be faced. I say \"freedom of sexual choice\" and not \"free­\ndom of sexual acts\" because there are sexual acts like rape which \nshould not be permitted whether they involve a man and a woman or \ntwo men. I don't think we should have as our objective some sort of \nabsolute freedom or total liberty of sexual action. However, where free­\ndom of sexual choice is concerned, one has to be absolutely intransi­\ngent. This includes the liberty of expression of that choice. By this I \nmean the liberty to manifest that choice or not to manifest it. Now, \nthere has been considerable progress in this area on the level of legis­\nlation, certainly progess in the direction of tolerance, but there is still \na lot of work to be done. \n;Second, a homosexual movement could adopt the objective of pos­\ning the question of the place in a given society which sexual choice, sex­\nual behavior, and the effects of sexual relations between people could \nhave with regard to the individual. These questions are fundamentally \nobscure. Look, for example, at the confusion and equivocation that \nsurround pornography, or the lack of elucidation which characterizes \nthe question of the legal status that might be attached to the liaison \nbetween two people of the same sex.

I take it, then, your point is that the homosexual movement \nshould not only give itself the goal of enlarging legal permissiveness \nbut should also be asking broader and deeper questions about the stra­\ntegic roles played by sexual preferences and how they are perceived. \nIs it your point that the homosexual movement should not stop at lib­\neralizing laws relating to personal sexual choice but should also be pro­\nvoking society at large to rethink its own presuppositions regarding \nsexuality? In other words, it isn't that homosexuals are deviants who \nshould be allowed to practice in peace but, rather, that the whole con­\nceptual scheme that categorizes homosexuals as deviants must be dis­\nmantled. This throws an interesting light on the question of homosexual \neducators. In the debate that arose in California, regarding the right \nof homosexuals to teach primary and secondary school, for example, \nthose who argued against permitting homosexuals to teach were con­\ncerned not only with the likelihood of homosexuals constituting a threat \nto innocence, in that they may be prone to seducing their students, but \nalso that they might preach the gospel of homosexuality. \nM.F. The whole question, you see, has been wrongly formulated. \nUnder no circumstances should the sexual choice of an individual \ndetermine the profession he is allowed, or forbidden, to practice. Sex­\nual practices simply fall outside the pertinent factors related to the \nsuitability for a given profession. \"Yes,\" you might say, \"but what if \nthe profession is used by homosexuals to encourage others to become \nhomosexual ?\" \nWell, let me ask you this: Do you believe that teachers who for years, \nfor decades, for centuries, explained to children that homosexuality is \nintolerable; do you believe that the textbooks that purged literature and \nfalsified history in order to exclude various types of sexual behavior, \nhave not caused ravages at least as serious as a homosexual teacher \nwho speaks about homosexuality and who can do no more harm than \nexplain a given reality, a lived experience? \nThe fact that a teacher is a homosexual can only have electrifying \nand intense effects on the students to the extent that the rest of society \nrefuses to admit the existence of homosexuality. A homosexual teacher \nshould not present any more of a problem than a bald teacher, a male \nteacher in an all-female school, a female teacher in an all-male school, \nor an Arab teacher in a school in the 16th district in Paris."

There is a growing tendency in American intellectual circles, \nparticularly among radical feminists, to distinguish between male and \nfemale homosexuality. The basis of this distinction is twofold. If the \nterm homosexuality is taken to denote not merely a tendency toward \naffectional relations with members of the same sex but an inclination \nto find members of the same sex erotically attractive and gratifying, \nthen it is worth insisting on the very different physical things that hap­\npen in the one encounter and the other. The second basis for the dis­\ntinction is that lesbians seem in the main to want from other women \nwhat one finds in stable heterosexual relationships: support, affection, \nlong-term commitment, and so on. If this is not the case with male \nhomosexuals, then the difference may be said to be striking, if not fun­\ndamental.

Yes, I don't think it makes much sense to talk about a homosex­\nual style. Even on the level of nature, the term homosexuality doesn't \nhave much meaning. I'm reading right now, as a matter of fact, an \ninteresting book that came out recently in the U.S. called Proust and \nthe Art if Love.3 The author shows us how difficult it is to give mean­\ning to the proposition \"Proust was a homosexual.\" It seems to me that \nit is finally an inadequate category-inadequate, that is, in that we can't \nreally classify behavior, on the one hand, and the term can't restore a \ntype of experience, on the other. One could perhaps say there is a \"gay \nstyle,\" or at least that there is an ongoing attempt to recreate a certain \nstyle of existence, a form of existence or art of living, which might be \ncalled \"gay.\" \nIn answer to the question about dissimulation, it is true that, for \ninstance, during the nineteenth century it was, to a certain degree, \nnecessary to hide one's homosexuality. But to call homosexuals liars is \nequivalent to calling the resisters under a military occupation liars. It's \nlike calling Jews \"moneylenders,\" when it was the only profession they \nwere allowed to practice. \nJ .O'H. Nevertheless, it does seem evident, at least on a sociological \nlevel, that there are certain characteristics one can discern in the gay \nstyle, certain generalizations which (your laughter a moment ago not­\nwithstanding) recall such stereotypifications as promiscuity, anonym­\nity between sexual partners, purely physical relationships, and so on. \nM.F. Yes, but it's not quite so simple. In a society like ours, where \nhomosexuality is repressed, and severely so, men enjoy a far greater \ndegree of liberty than women. Men are permitted to make love much \nmore often and under less restrictive conditions. Houses of prostitu­\ntion exist to satisfy their sexual needs. Ironically, this has resulted in a \ncertain permissiveness with regard to sexual practices between men. \nSexual desire is considered more intense for men and therefore in \ngreater need of release; so, along with brothels, one saw the emer­\ngence of baths where men could meet and have sex with each other. \nThe Roman baths were exactly this, a place for heterosexuals to engage \nin sexual acts. It wasn't until the sixteenth century, I believe, that these \nbaths were closed as places of unacceptable sexual debauchery. Thus, \neven homosexuality benefited from a certain tolerance toward sexual \npractices, as long as it was limited to a simple physical encounter. And"

The effect has \nbeen that homosexuals now have the luxury of knowing that in a certain \nnumber of countries-Holland, Denmark, the United States, and even \nas provincial a country as France-the opportunities for sexual encoun­\nters are enormous.

If Rieff means that the restrictions should \nbe clear and well defined, I agree. \nJ .O'H. Actually, Rieff would argue that a true culture is one in which \nthe essential truths have been sunk so deep in everyone that there would \nbe no need to articulate them. Clearly, in a society of law, one would \nneed to make explicit a great variety of things that were not to be done, \nbut the main credal assumptions would for the most part remain in­\naccessible to simple articulation. Part of the thrust of Riefrs work is \ndirected against the idea that it is desirable to do away with credal \nassumptions in the name of a perfect liberty, and also the idea that \nrestrictions are by definition what all must aim to clear away. \nM.F.

At the end of one of his dialogues, for instance, \nhe evokes a scene where a man approaches a boy, puts his hand on the \nboy's knee, slides his hand under his tunic and caresses the boy's chest; \nthen the hand moves down to the boy's stomach and suddenly the text \nstops there. Now, I would attribute this prudishness, which generally \ncharacterizes homosexual literature in ancient times, to the greater free­\ndom then enjoyed by men in their homosexual practices. \nJ . 0' H. I see. So the more free and open sexual practice is, the more \none can afford to be reticent or oblique in talking about it. This would \nexplain why homosexual literature is more explicit in our culture than \nheterosexual literature. But I'm still wondering how one could use this \nexplanation to account for the fact that the former manages to achieve \nthe same effect in the imagination of the reader as the latter achieves \nwith the exact opposite tools. \nM.F. Let me try to answer your question another way. The experi­\nence of heterosexuality, at least since the Middle Ages, has always con­\nsisted of two axes; on the one hand, the axis of courtship in which the \nman seduces the woman; and, on the other hand, the axis of sexual \nact itself. Now, the great heterosexual literature of the West has had to \ndo essentially with the axis of amorous courtship, that is, above all, with \nthat which precedes the sexual act. All the work of intellectual and cul­\ntural refinement, all the aesthetic elaboration of the West, were aimed \nat courtship. This is the reason for the relative poverty of literary, cul­\ntural, and aesthetic appreciation of the sexual act as such. \nIn contrast, the modern homosexual experience has no relation at \nall to courtship. This was not the case in ancient Greece, however. For \nthe Greeks, courtship between men was more important than between \nmen and women. (Think of Socrates and Alcibiades.) But in Christian \nculture of the West, homosexuality was banished and therefore had to"

Homosexuals were \nnot allowed to elaborate a system of courtship because the cultural \nexpression necessary for such an elaboration was denied them. The \nwink on the street, the split-second decision to get it on, the speed with \nwhich homosexual relations are consummated: all these are products \nof an interdiction. So when a homosexual culture and literature began \nto develop it was natural for it to focus on the most ardent and heated \naspect of homosexual relations. \nJ.O'H. I'm reminded of Cassanova's famous expression that \"the best \nmoment in life is when one is climbing the stairs.\" One can hardly \nimagine a homosexual today making such a remark. \nM.F. Exactly. Rather, he would say something like: \"the best moment \nof love is when the lover leaves in the taxi.\" \nJ.O'H. I can't help thinking that this describes more or less precisely \nSwann's relations with Odette in the first volume of Proust's great \nnovel. \nM.F. Well, yes, that is true. But though we are speaking there of \na relationship between a man and a woman, we should have to take \ninto account in describing it the nature of the imagination that con­\nceived it. \nJ.O'H. And we would also then have to take into account the patho­\nlogical nature of the relationship as Proust himself conceives it. \nM.F. The question of pathology I would as well omit in this context. \nI prefer simply to return to the observation with which I began this part \nof our exchange, namely, that for a homosexual, the best moment of \nlove is likely to be when the lover leaves in the taxi. It is when the act \nis over and the guy [garqon] is gone that one begins to dream about \nthe warmth of his body, the quality of his smile, the tone of his voice. \nIt is the recollection rather than the anticipation of the act that assumes \na primary importance in homosexual relations. This is why the great \nhomosexual writers of our culture (Cocteau, Genet, Burroughs) can \nwrite so elegantly about the sexual act itself, because the homosexual \nimagination is for the most part concerned with reminiscing about the \nact rather than anticipating it. And, as I said earlier, this is all due to \nvery concrete and practical considerations and says nothing about the \nintrinsic nature of homosexuality. \nJ.O'H. Do you think this has any bearing on the so-called prolifera­\ntion of perversions one sees today? I am speaking of phenomena like \nthe S&M scene, golden showers, scatological amusements, and the like."

I would say they are much more widely practiced also. \nJ. 0' H. Do you think this general phenomenon and the fact that \nhomosexuality is \"coming out of the closet,\" making public its form of \nexpression, have anything to do with each other? \nM.F. I would advance the following hypothesis: In a civilization that \nfor centuries considered the essence of the relation between two people \nto reside in the knowledge of whether one of the two parties was going \nto surrender to the other, all the interest and curiosity, the cunning and \nmanipulation of people was aimed at getting the other to give in, to \ngo to bed with them. Now, when sexual encounters become extremely \neasy and numerous, as is the case with homosexuality nowadays, com­\nplications are introduced only after the fact. In this type of casual en­\ncounter, it is only after making love that one becomes curious about the \nother person. Once the sexual act has been consummated, you find \nyourself asking your partner, \"By the way, what was your name?\" \nWhat you have, then, is a situation where all the energy and imagi­\nnation, which in the heterosexual relationship were channeled into \ncourtship, now become devoted to intensifying the act of sex itself. A \nwhole new art of sexual practice develops which tries to explore all the \ninternal possibilities of sexual conduct. You find emerging in places like \nSan Francisco and New York what might be called laboratories of sexual \nexperimentation. You might look upon this as the counterpart of the \nmedieval courts where strict rules of proprietary courtship were defined. \nIt is because the sexual act has become so easy and available to homo­\nsexuals that it runs the risk of quickly becoming boring, so that every \neffort has to be made to innovate and create variations that will enhance \nthe pleasure of the act. \nJ.O'H. Yes, but why have these innovations taken the specific form \nthey have? Why the fascination with excretory functions, for instance? \nM.F. I find the S&M phenomenon in general to be more surprising \nthan that. That is to say, sexual relations are elaborated and developed \nby and through mythical relations. S&M is not a relationship between \nhe (or she) who suffers and he (or she) who inflicts suffering, but be­\nIween the master and the one on whom he exercises his mastery. What \ninterests the practitioners of S&M is that the relationship is at the same \nI ime regulated and open. It resembles a chess game in the sense that \none can win and the other lose. The master can lose in the S&M game"

This mixture of \nrules and openness has the effect of intensifying sexual relations by \nintroducing a perpetual novelty, a perpetual tension and a perpetual \nuncertainty, which the simple consummation of the act lacks. The idea \nis also to make use of every part of the body as a sexual instrument. \nActually this is related to the famous phase animal triste post coitum. \nSince in homosexuality coitus is given immediately, the problem be­\ncomes \"what can be done to guard against the onset of sadness?\" \nJ.O'H. Would you venture an explanation for the fact that bisexuality \namong women today seems to be much more readily accepted by men \nthan bisexuality among men? \nM.F. This probably has to do with the role women play in the imagi­\nnation of heterosexual men. Women have always been seen by them as \ntheir exclusive property. To preserve this image, a man had to prevent \nhis woman from having too much contact with other men, so women \nwere restricted to social contact with other women and more tolerance \nwas exercised with regard to the physical rapport between women. By \nthe same token, heterosexual men felt that if they practiced homo­\nsexuality with other men this would destroy what they think is their \nimage in the eyes of their women. They think of themselves as existing \nin the minds of women as master. They think that the idea of their \nsubmitting to another man, of being under another man in the act of \nlove, would destroy their image in the eyes of women. Men think that \nwomen can only experience pleasure in recognizing men as masters. \nEven the Greeks had a problem with being the passive partner in a love \nrelationship.

Sure, there were some \nscattered medical reports and the like, but the practice of incest didn't \nreally seem to pose a problem at the time. \nIt is perhaps true that in intellectual circles these things are talked \nabout more openly, but that is not necessarily a sign of greater toler­\nance.

The literature of the early Christian Church also did not oppose gay behavior. But hos­\ntility to the sexuality of gay people became more evident at the time of the dissolution of the \nRoman state and its urban centers. The eleventh century brought a renaissance of urban life \nand with it the reappearance of a more visible gay culture, which was only to be threatened a \ncentury later by theological and legal prejudices. The intolerance of the late Middle Ages con­\ntinued to have an effect on European culture for centuries to come. To understand the nature \nof gay relationships, Boswell insists that they must be studied within temporal houndaries \naccording to the customs of their day. \n2 See Standard Edition of the Complete P~ychological Works of Sigmund Freud, trans . .James \nStrachey (London: Hogarth Press, 1955), vol. 2."

There can be discrimination \nagainst homosexuals even if such discriminations are prohibited by law. \nIt is therefore necessary to struggle to establish homosexual lifestyles, \nexistential choices [des choir d'existence] in which sexual relations with \npeople of the same sex will be important. It's not enough as part of a \nmore general way of life, or in addition to it, to be permitted to make \nlove with someone of the same sex. The fact of making love with some­\none of the same sex can very naturally involve a whole series of choices, \na whole series of other values and choices for which there are not yet \nreal possibilities.

The essential question is that of supports, because the relations \nexist-or at least they try to exist. The problem comes because certain \nthings are decided not by law-making bodies but by executive order. \nIn Holland, certain legal changes have lessened the power of families \nand have permitted the individual to feel stronger in the relations he \nwishes to form.

Right now I'm fascinated by the Hellenistic and Roman \nworld before Christianity. Take, for example, relations of friendship. \nThey played an important part, but there was a supple institutional \nframework for them-even if it was sometimes constraining-with a \nsystem of obligations, tasks, reciprocal duties, a hierarchy between \nfriends, and so on. I don't think we should reproduce that model. But \nyou can see how a system of supple and relatively codified relations \ncould exist for a long time and support a certain number of important \nand stable relations, which we now have great difficulty defining. When \nyou read an account of two friends from the period, you always won­\nder what it really is. Did they make love together? Did they have com­\nmon interests? No doubt, it's neither of those things, or both. \nG.B. In Western societies, the only notion upon which legislation is \nbased is that of the citizen, or of the individual. How do we reconcile \nthe desire to validate relations which have no legal sanction with a \nlaw-making body which confirms that all citizens have equal rights? \nThere are still questions with no answers-that of the single person, \nfor example. \nM.F. Of course. The single person must be recognized as having rela­\ntions with others quite different from those of a married couple, for \nexample.

And a utopia \nin the dangerous sense, not because it promised good relations with \nwomen but because it was at the expense of monosexual relations. In \nthe often-negative response some French people have toward certain \ntypes of American behavior, there is still that disapproval of mono­\nsexuality. So occasionally we hear: \"What? How can you approve of \nthose macho models? You're always with men, you have mustaches and \nleather jackets, you wear boots, what kind of masculine image is that?\" \nMaybe in ten years we'll laugh about it all.

We have to admit this is all something very new and practically \nunknown in Western societies. The Greeks never admitted love be­\ntween two adult men. We can certainly find allusions to the idea of love \nbetween young men, when they were soldiers, but not for any others. \nG.B. This would be something absolutely new? \nM.F. It's one thing to be permitted sexual relations, but the very rec­\nognition by the individuals themselves of this type of relation, in the \nsense that they give them necessary and sufficient importance-that \nthey acknowledge them and make them real-in order to invent other \nways of life, yes, that's new. \nG.B. Why has the idea of a relational right, stemming from \"gay \nrights,\" come about first in Anglo-Saxon countries? \nM.F. That's linked to many things, certainly to the laws regarding \nsexuality in Latin countries. We see for the first time a negative aspect \nof the Greek heritage, the fact that the love of one man for another is \nonly valid in the form of classic pederasty. We should also take into con­\nsideration another phenomenon: in countries that are largely Protes­\ntant, associative rights were much more developed for obvious religious \nreasons. I would add, however, that relational rights are not exactly \nassociative rights-the latter are an advance of the late nineteenth cen­\ntury. The relational right is the right to gain recognition in an institu­\ntional sense for the relations of one individual to another individual, \nwhich is not necessarily connected to the emergence of a group. It's \nvery different. It's a question of imagining how the relation of two indi­\nviduals can be validated by society and benefit from the same advan­\ntages as the relations-perfectly honorable-which are the only ones \nrecognized: marriage and the family."

My view is that we should understand it in the reverse way: \nthe world regards sexuality as the secret of the creative cultural life; it \nis, rather, a process of our having to create a new cultural life under­\nneath the ground of our sexual choices. \nQ. Practically speaking, one of the effects of trying to uncover that \nsecret has meant that the gay movement has remained at the level of \ndemanding civil or human rights around sexuality. That is, sexual lib­\neration has remained at the level of demanding sexual tolerance. \nM.F. Yes, but this aspect must be supported. It is important, first, \nto have the possibility-and the right-to choose your own sexuality. \nHuman rights regarding sexuality are important and are still not re­\nspected in many places. We shouldn't consider that such problems are \nsolved now. It's quite true that there was a real liberation process in \nthe early seventies. This process was very good, both in terms of the \nsituation and in terms of opinions, but the situation has not definitely \nstabilized. Still, I think we have to go a step further. I think that one \nof the factors of this stabilization will be the creation of new forms \nof life, relationships, friendships in society, art, culture, and so on \nthrough our sexual, ethical, and political choices. Not only do we have \nto defend ourselves, not only affirm ourselves, as an identity but as a \ncreative force. \nQ. A lot of that sounds like what, for instance, the women's move­\nment has done, trying to establish their own language and their own \nculture. \nM.F. Well, I'm not sure that we have to create our own culture. We \nhave to create culture. We have to realize cultural creations. But, in \ndoing so, we come up against the problem of identity. I don't know \nwhat we would do to form these creations, and I don't know what \nforms these creations would take. For instance, I am not at all sure that \nthe best form of literary creations by gay people is gay novels. \nQ. In fact, we would not even want to say that. That would be based \non an essentialism that we need to avoid. \nM.F. True. What do we mean for instance, by \"gay painting\"? Yet, \nI am sure that from the point of departure of our ethical choices, we \ncan create something that will have a certain relationship to gayness. \nBut it must not be a translation of gayness in the field of music or paint­\ning or what have you, for I do not think this can happen. \nQ.

I am thinking, obviously, of the salient aspects of what we call \nthe ghetto-porn movies, clubs for S&M or fistfucking, and so forth. \nIs this merely an extension into another sphere of the general prolif­\neration of sexual discourses since the nineteenth century, or do you \nsee other kinds of developments that are peculiar to this present his­\ntorical context? \nM.F. Well, I think what we want to speak about is precisely the inno­\nvations those practices imply. For instance, look at the S&M subcul­\nture, as our good friend Gayle Rubin would insist. I don't think that \nthis movement of sexual practices has anything to do with the disclo­\nsure or the uncovering of S&M tendencies deep within our uncon­\nscious, and so on. I think that S&M is much more than that; it's the \nreal creation of new possibilities of pleasure, which people had no idea \nabout previously. The idea that S&M is related to a deep violence, that \nS&M practice is a way of liberating this violence, this aggression, is stu­\npid. We know very well what all those people are doing is not aggres­\nsive; they are inventing new possibilities of pleasure with strange parts \nof their body-through the eroticization of the body. I think it's a kind \nof creation, a creative enterprise, which has as one of its main features \nwhat I call the desexualization of pleasure. The idea that bodily plea­\nsure should always come from sexual pleasure as the root of all our pos­\nsible pleasure-I think that's something quite wrong. These practices \nare insisting that we can produce pleasure with very odd things, very \nstrange parts of our bodies, in very unusual situations, and so on. \nQ. So the conflation of pleasure and sex is being broken down. \nM.F. That's it precisely. The possibility of using our bodies as a \npossible source of very numerous pleasures is something that is very \nimportant. For instance, if you look at the traditional construction of \npleasure, you see that bodily pleasure, or pleasures of the flesh, are \nalways drinking, eating, and fucking. And that seems to be the limit \nof the understanding of our body, our pleasures. What frustrates me, \nfor instance, is the fact that the problem of drugs is always envisaged \nonly as a problem of freedom and prohibition. I think that drugs must \nbecome a part of our culture. \nQ. As a pleasure? \nM.F. As a pleasure. We have to study drugs. We have to experience \ndrugs. We have to do good drugs that can produce very intense pleasure. \nI think this puritanism about drugs, which implies that you can either"

The point is to experiment with pleasure and its possibilities. \nM.F. Yes. Pleasure also must be a part of our culture. It is very inter­\nesting to note, for instance, that for centuries people generally, as well \nas doctors, psychiatrists, and even liberation movements, have always \nspoken about desire, and never about pleasure. \"We have to liberate \nour desire,\" they say. No! We have to create new pleasure. And then \nmaybe desire will follow. \nQ. Is it significant that there are, to a large degree, identities form­\ning around new sexual practices, like S&M? These identities help in \nexploring such practices and defending the right to engage in them. But \nare they also limiting in regards to the possibilities of individuals? \nM.F. Well, if identity is only a game, if it is only a procedure to have \nrelations, social and sexual-pleasure relationships that create new \nfriendships, it is useful. But if identity becomes the problem of sexual \nexistence, and if people think that they have to \"uncover\" their \"own \nidentity,\" and that their own identity has to become the law, the prin­\nciple, the code of their existence; if the perennial question they ask is \n\"Does this thing conform to my identity?\" then, I think, they will turn \nback to a kind of ethics very close to the old heterosexual virility. If we \nare asked to relate to the question of identity, it must be an identity to \nour unique selves.

But you are quite right in underlining that \nwe always have to be quite careful and to be aware of the fact that we \nmust move on to something else, that we have other needs as well. The \nS&M ghetto in San Francisco is a good example of a community that \nhas experimented with, and formed an identity around, pleasure. This \nghettoization, this identification, this procedure of exclusion and so \non-all of these have, as well, produced their countereffects. I dare not \nuse the word dialectics-but this comes rather close to it. \nQ. You write that power is not just a negative force but a productive \none; that power is always there; that where there is power, there is \nresistance; and that resistance is never in a position of externality vis­\na-vis power. If this is so, then how do we come to any other conclu­\nsion than that we are always trapped inside that relationship-that we \ncan't somehow break out of it. \nM.F. Well, I don't think the word trapped is a correct one. It is a \nstruggle, but what I mean by power relations is the fact that we are in \na strategic situation toward each other. For instance, being homosexu­\nals, we are in a struggle with the government, and the government is in \na struggle with us. When we deal with the government, the struggle, \nof course, is not symmetrical, the power situation is not the same; but \nwe are in this struggle, and the continuation of this situation can influ­\nence the behavior or nonbehavior of the other. So we are not trapped. \nWe are always in this kind of situation. It means that we always have \npossibilities, there are always possibilities of changing the situation. We \ncannot jump outside the situation, and there is no point where you are \nfree from all power relations. But you can always change it. So what I've \nsaid does not mean that we are always trapped, but that we are always \nfree-well, anyway, that there is always the pOSSibility of changing. \nQ. So resistance comes from within that dynamic? \nM.F. Yes. You see, if there was no resistance, there would be no \npower relations. Because it would simply be a matter of obedience. \nYou have to use power relations to refer to the situation where you're \nnot doing what you want. So resistance comes first, and resistance re­\nmains superior to the forces of the process; power relations are obliged \nto change with the resistance. So I think that resistance is the main \nword, the key word, in this dynamic."

Politically speaking, probably the most important part of looking \nat power is that, according to previous conceptions, \"to resist\" was \nsimply to say no. Resistance was conceptualized only in terms of nega­\ntion. Within your understanding, however, to resist is not simply a \nnegation but a creative process; to create and recreate, to change the \nsituation, actually to be an active member of that process. \nM.F. Yes, that is the way I would put it. To say no is the minimum \nform of resistance. But, of course, at times that is very important. You \nhave to say no as a decisive form of resistance. \nQ. This raises the question of in what way, and to what degree, can \na dominated subject (or subjectivity) actually create its own discourse. \nIn traditional power analysis, the omnipresent feature of analysis is the \ndominant discourse, and only as a subsidiary are there reactions to, \nor within, that discourse. However, if what we mean by resistance in \npower relations is more than negation, then aren't some practices like, \nsay, lesbian S&M, actually ways for dominated subjects to formulate \ntheir own languages? \nM.F. Well, you see, I think that resistance is a part of this strategic \nrelationship of which power consists. Resistance really always relies \nupon the situation against which it struggles. For instance, in the gay \nmovement the medical definition of homosexuality was a very impor­\ntant tool against the oppression of homosexuality in the last part of the \nnineteenth century and in the early twentieth century. This medicali­\nzation, which was a means of oppression, has always been a means of \nresistance as well-since people could say, \"If we are sick, then why \ndo you condemn us, why do you despise us?\" and so on. Of course, \nthis discourse now sounds rather naIve to us, but at the time it was \nvery important. \nI should say, also, that I think that in the lesbian movement, the fact \nthat women have been, for centuries and centuries, isolated in society, \nfrustrated, despised in many ways, and so on, has given them the real \npossibility of constituting a society, of creating a kind of social relation \nbetween themselves, outside the social world that was dominated by \nmales. Lillian Faderman's book Surpassing the Love of Men is very \ninteresting in this regard. It raises the question: What kind of emo­\ntional experience, what kind of relationships, were possible in a world \nwhere women in society had no social, no legal, and no political power? \nAnd she argues that women used that isolation and lack of power. \nQ.

To what degree \ncan such practices and identities be seen as challenging the dominant \ndiscourse? \nM.F. What I think is interesting now, in relation to lesbian S&M, is \nthat they can get rid of certain stereotypes of femininity which have \nbeen used in the lesbian movement-a strategy that the movement has \nerected from the past. This strategy has been based on their oppres­\nsion. But now, maybe, these tools, these weapons are obsolete. We can \nsee that lesbian S&M tried to get rid of all those old stereotypes of fem­\nininity, of antimale attitude and so on. \nQ. What do you think we can learn about power and, for that mat­\nter, about pleasure from the practice of S&M-that is, the explicit \neroticization of power? \nM.F. One can say that S&M is the eroticization of power, the erotici­\nzation of strategic relations. What strikes me with regard to S&M is \nhow it differs from social power. What characterizes power is the fact \nthat it is a strategic relation which has been stabilized through insti­\ntutions. So the mobility in power relations is limited, and there are \nstrongholds that a:r:e very, very difficult to suppress because they have \nbeen institutionalized and are now very pervasive in courts, codes, \nand so on. All this means that the strategic relations of people are \nmade rigid. \nOn this point, the S&M game is very interesting because it is a stra­\ntegic relation, but it is always fluid. Of course, there are roles, but \neverybody knows very well that those roles can be reversed. Some­\ntimes the scene begins with the master and slave, and at the end the \nslave has become the master. Or, even when the roles are stabilized, \nyou know very well that it is always a game. Either the rules are trans­\ngressed, or there is an agreement, either explicit or tacit, that makes \nthem aware of certain boundaries. This strategic game as a source of \nbodily pleasure is very interesting. But I wouldn't say that it is a repro­\nduction, inside the erotic relationship, of the structures of power. It is \nan acting-out of power structures by a strategic game that is able to give \nsexual pleasure or bodily pleasure. \nQ.

It is not the first time \nthat people have used strategic relations as a source of pleasure. For \ninstance, in the Middle Ages there was the institution of \"courtly love,\" \nthe troubadour, the institutions of the love relationships between the \nlady and the lover, and so on. That, too, was a strategic game. You even \nfind this between boys and girls when they are dancing on Saturday \nnight. They are acting out strategic relations. What is interesting is that, \nin this heterosexual life, those strategic relations come before sex. It's \na strategic relation in order to obtain sex. And in S&M those strategic \nrelations are inside sex, as a convention of pleasure within a particu­\nlar situation. \nIn the one case, the strategic relations are purely social relations, and \nit is your social being that is involved; while, in the other case, it is your \nbody that is involved.

Do you think what frightens people is the unknown potential of \ngay relations, or would you suggest that these relations are seen as pos­\ning a direct threat to social institutions? \nM.F.

There were also economic and social implications \nto these relationships-they were obliged to help their friends, and \nso on. I think that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, we see \nthese kinds of friendships disappearing, at least in the male society. \nAnd friendship begins to become something other than that. You can \nfind, from the sixteenth century on, texts that explicitly criticize friend­\nship as something dangerous. \nThe army, bureaucracy, administration, universities, schools, and so \non-in the modern senses of these words-cannot function with such \nintense friendships.

For instance, you could study the strategy of \nJesuit institutions about this theme of friendship, since the Jesuits knew \nvery well that it was impossible for them to suppress this. Rather, they \ntried to use the role of sex, of love, of friendship, and at the same time \nto limit it. I think now, after studying the history of sex, we should try \nto understand the history of friendship, or friendships. That history is \nvery, very important. \nAnd one of my hypotheses, which I am sure would be borne out if we \ndid this, is that homosexuality became a problem-that is, sex between \nmen became a problem-in the eighteenth century. We see the rise of \nit as a problem with the police, within the justice system, and so on. I \nthink the reason it appears as a problem, as a social issue, at this time \nis that friendship had disappeared. As long as friendship was some­\nthing important, was socially accepted, nobody realized men had sex \ntogether. You couldn't say that men didn't have sex together-it just \ndidn't matter. It had no social implication, it was culturally accepted. \nWhether they fucked together or kissed had no importance. Absolutely \nno importance. Once friendship disappeared as a culturally accepted \nrelation, the issue arose: \"What is going on between men?\" And that's \nwhen the problem appears. And if men fuck together, or have sex to­\ngether, that now appears as a problem. Well, I'm sure I'm right, that \nthe disappearance of friendship as a social relation and the declara­\ntion of homosexuality as a social/political/medical problem are the \nsame process. \nQ. If the important thing now is to explore anew the possibilities of \nfriendships, we should note that, to a large degree, all the social insti­\ntutions are designed for heterosexual friendships and structures, and \nthe denial of homosexual ones. Isn't the real task to set up new social \nrelations, new value structures, familial structures, and so on? One of \nthe things gay people don't have is easy access to all the structures and \ninstitutions that go along with monogamy and the nuclear family. What \nkinds of institutions do we need to begin to establish, in order not just \nto defend ourselves but also to create new social forms that are really \ngoing to be alternative? \nM.F.

I think that one of the great experiences we've had since the \nlast war is that all those social and political programs have been a great \nfailure. We have come to realize that things never happen as we expect \nfrom a political program, and that a political program has always, or \nnearly always, led to abuse or political domination from a bloc-be it \nfrom technicians or bureaucrats or other people. But one of the devel­\nopments of the sixties and seventies which I think has been a good \nthing is that certain institutional models have been experimented with \nwithout a program.

For instanc~, in France there has been a lot of crit­\nicism recently about the fact that there are no programs in the various \npolitical movements about sex, about prisons, about ecology, and so \non. But in my opinion, being without a program can be very useful \nand very original and creative, if it does not mean without proper \nreflection about what is going on, or without very careful attention to \nwhat's possible. \nSince the nineteenth century, great political institutions and great \npolitical parties have confiscated the process of political creation; that \nis, they have tried to give to political creation the form of a political \nprogram in order to take over power. I think what happened in the six­\nties and early seventies is something to be preserved. One of the things \nthat I think should be preserved, however, is the fact that there has \nbeen political innovation, political creation, and political experimenta­\ntion outside the great political parties, and outside the normal or ordi­\nnary program. It's a fact that people's everyday lives have changed from \nthe early sixties to now, and certainly within my own life.

One morning he placed Mr. A., his patient, in a shower \nroom. He makes him recount in detail his delirium. \"But all that,\" said \nthe doctor, \"is nothing but madness. Promise me not to believe in it \nanymore.\" The patient hesitates, then promises. \"That is not enough,\" \nreplies the doctor. \"You have already made me similar promises and \nyou haven't kept them.\" And he turns on the cold shower above the \npatient's head. \"Yes, yes! I am mad!\" the patient cries. The shower is \nturned off; the interrogation is resumed. \"Yes. I recognize that I am \nmad,\" the patient repeats. \"But,\" he adds, \"I recognize it because you \nare forcing me to do so.\" Another shower. \"Well, well,\" says Mr. A., \n\"I admit it. I am mad, and all that was nothing but madness.\" \nTo make somebody suffering from mental illness recognize that he \nis mad is a very ancient procedure in traditional therapy. In the works \nof the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, one finds many examples \nof what one might call \"truth therapies.\" But the technique used by \nLeuret is altogether different. Leuret is not trying to persuade his \npatient that his ideas are false or unreasonable. What happens in the \nhead of Mr. A. is a matter of perfect indifference to Leuret. The doc­\ntor wishes to obtain a precise act, the explicit affirmation: \"I am mad.\" \nSince I first read this passage of Leuret, about twenty years ago, I kept \nin mind the project of analyzing the form and the history of such a \nbizarre practice. Leuret is satisfied when and only when his patient"

The affir­\nmation destroys in the speaking subject the reality that made the same \naffirmation true. What conception of truth of discourse and of subjec­\ntivity is taken for granted in this strange and yet widespread practice? \nIn order to justify the attention I am giving to what is seemingly so spe­\ncialized a subject, let me take a step back for a moment. In the years \nthat preceded the Second World War, and even more so after the war, \nphilosophy in continental Europe and in France was dominated by the \nphilosophy of subject. I mean that philosophy took as its task par excel­\nlence the foundation of all knowledge and the principle of all signifi­\ncation as stemming from the meaningful subject. The importance given \nto this question was due to the impact of Husserl, but the centrality of \nthe subject was also tied to an institutional context, for the French uni­\nversity, since philosophy began with Descartes, could only advance in \na Cartesian manner. But we must also take into account the political \nconjunct. Given the absurdity of wars, slaughters, and despotism, it \nseemed to be up to the individual subject to give meaning to his exis­\ntential choices. With the leisure and distance that came after the war, \nthis emphasis on the philosophy of subject no longer seemed so self­\nevident. Hitherto-hidden theoretical paradoxes could no longer be \navoided. This philosophy of consciousness had paradoxically failed to \nfound a philosophy of knowledge, and especially of scientific knowl­\nedge. Also, this philosophy of meaning had failed to take into account \nthe formative mechanisms of signification and the structure of systems \nof meaning. \nWith the all too easy clarity of hindsight-of what Americans call the \n\"Monday-morning quarterback\"-let me say that there were two pos­\nsible paths that led beyond this philosophy of subject. The first of these \nwas the theory of objective knowledge as an analysis of systems of \nmeaning, as semiology. This was the path of logical positivism. The \nsecond was that of a certain school of linguistics, psychoanalysis, and \nanthropology-all grouped under the rubric of Structuralism. These \nwere not the directions I took. Let me announce once and for all that \nI am not a structuralist, and I confess, with the appropriate chagrin, \nthat I am not an analytic philosopher. Nobody is perfect. But I have \ntried to explore another direction. I have tried to get out from the phi-"

That, of course, is politically important. One can \nproceed with this general project in two ways. In dealing with mod­\nern theoretical constructions, we are concerned with the subject in gen­\neral. In this way, I have tried to analyze the theories of the subject as a \nspeaking, living, working being in the seventeenth and eighteenth cen­\nturies. One can also deal with the more practical understanding found \nin those institutions where certain subjects became objects of knowl­\nedge and of domination: asylums, prisons, and so on. \nI wished to study those forms of understanding which the subject \ncreates about himself. But since I started with this last type of prob­\nlem, I have been obliged to change my mind on several points. Let me \nintroduce a kind of auto-critique. It seems, according to some sugges­\ntions of Jiirgen Habermas, that one can distinguish three major types \nof technique: the techniques that permit one to produce, to transform, \nto manipulate things; the techniques that permit one to use sign sys­\ntems; and finally, the techniques that permit one to determine the con­\nduct of individuals, to impose certain ends or objectives. That is to say, \ntechniques of production, techniques of signification or communication, \nand techniques of domination. But I became more and more aware that \nin all societies there is another type of technique: techniques that per­\nmit individuals to effect, by their own means, a certain number of oper­\nations on their own bodies, their own souls, their own thoughts, their \nown conduct, and this in a manner so as to transform themselves, mod­\nify themselves, and to attain a certain state of perfection, happiness, \npurity, supernatural power. Let us call these techniques \"technologies \nof the self.\" \nIf one wants to analyze the genealogy of the subject in Western civi­\nlization, one must take into account not only techniques of domination \nbut also techniques of the self. One must show the interaction between \nthese types of technique. When I was studying asylums, prisons, and \nso on, I perhaps insisted too much on the techniques of domination. \nWhat we call \"discipline\" is something really important in this kind \nof institution; but it is only one aspect of the art of governing people \nin our societies. Having studied the field of power relations taking tech­\nniques of domination as a point of departure, I would like, in the years \nto come, to study power relations starting from the techniques of the \nself. In every culture, I think, this self technology implies a set of truth"

All these are considered important either for the constitu­\ntion of, or the transformation of, the self. \nNow, what about truth as a duty in our Christian societies? As every­\nbody knows, Christianity is a confession. This means that Christianity \nbelongs to a very special type of religion-those which impose obliga­\ntions of truth on the practitioners. Such obligations in Christianity are \nnumerous. For instance, there is the obligation to hold as truth a set \nof propositions that constitute dogma, the obligation to hold certain \nbooks as a permanent source of truth, and obligations to accept the \ndecisions of certain authorities in matters of truth. But Christianity \nrequires another form of truth obligation. Everyone in Christianity has \nthe duty to explore who he is, what is happening within himself, the \nfaults he may have committed, the temptations to which he is exposed. \nMoreover, everyone is obliged to tell these things to other people, and \nthus to bear witness against himself. \nThese two ensembles of obligation-those regarding the faith, the \nbook, the dogma, and those regarding the self, the soul, and the heart­\nare linked together. A Christian needs the light of faith when he wants \nto explore himself, Conversely, his access to the truth can't be conceived \nof without the purification of his soul. The Buddhist, too, must go to \nthe light and discover the truth about himself; but the relation between \nthese two obligations is quite different in Buddhism and in Christianity. \nIn Buddhism, it is the same type of enlightenment which leads you to \ndiscover what you are and what is the truth. In this simultaneous en­\nlightenment of yourself and the truth, you discover that your self was \nonly an illusion. I would like to underline that the Christian discovery \nof the self does not reveal the self as an illusion. It gives place to a task \nthat cannot be anything else but undefined. This task has two objec­\ntives. First, there is the task of clearing up all the illusions, tempta­\ntions, and seductions that can occur in the mind, and of discovering \nthe reality of what is going on within ourselves. Second, one must get \nfree from any attachment to this self, not because the self is an illu­\nsion but because the self is much too real. The more we discover the \ntruth about ourselves, the more we must renounce ourselves; and the \nmore we want to renounce ourselves, the more we need to bring to \nlight the reality of ourselves. That is what we would call the spiral of \ntruth formulation and reality renouncement which is at the heart of \nChristian techniques of the self."

      "text": "Sexuality and Solitude 179 \nRecently, Professor Peter Brown stated to me that what we have to \nunderstand is why it is that sexuality became, in Christian cultures, the \nseismograph of our subjectivity. It is a fact, a mysterious fact, that in \nthis indefinite spiral of truth and reality in the self sexuality has been \nof major importance since the first centuries of our era. It has become \nmore and more important. Why is there such a fundamental connec­\ntion between sexuality, subjectivity, and truth obligation? This is the \npoint at which I met Richard Sennett's work. \nOur point of departure in the seminar has been a passage of St. \nFran~ois de Sales. Here is the text in a translation made at the begin­\nning of the seventeenth century: \"I will tell you a point of the elephant's \nhonesty. An elephant never changes his mate. He loves her tenderly. \nWith her he couples not, but from three years to three years. And that \nonly for five days, and so secretly that he is never seen in the act. But \nthe sixth day, he shows himself abroad again, and the first thing he \ndoes is to go directly to some river and wash his body, not willing to \nreturn to his troupe of companions till he be purified. Be not these \ngoodly and honest qualities in a beast by which he teaches married folk \nnot to be given too much to carnal and sensual pleasures?\"b \nEverybody may recognize here the pattern of decent sexual behav­\nior: monogamy, faithfulness, and procreation as the main, or maybe the \nsingle, justification for the sexual acts-sexual acts that remain, even \nin such conditions, intrinsically impure. Most of us are inclined, I think, \nto attribute this pattern either to Christianity or to modern Christian \nsociety as it developed under the influence of capitalist or so-called \nbourgeois morality. But what struck me when I started studying this \npattern is the fact that one can also find it in Latin and even Hellenistic \nliterature. One finds the same ideas, the same words, and eventually \nthe same reference to the elephant. It is a fact that the pagan philoso­\nphers ;in the centuries before and after the death of Christ proposed a \nsexual ethics that was very similar to the alleged Christian ethics. In \nour seminar, it was very convincingly stressed that this philosophical \npattern of sexual behavior, this elephant pattern, was not at that time \nthe only one to be known and put into practice; it was in competition \nwith several others. Yet this pattern soon became predominant because \nit was related to a social transformation involving the disintegration of \nthe city-states, the development of the imperial bureaucracy, and the \nincreasing influence of the provincial middle class. \nDuring this period, we may witness an evolution toward the nuclear"

The philosophical campaign in favor of the ele­\nphant pattern was both an effect and an adjunct of this transformation. \nIf these assumptions are correct, we must concede that Christianity did \nnot invent this code of sexual behavior. Christianity accepted it, rein­\nforced it, and gave it a much larger and more widespread strength than \nit had before. But the so-called Christian morality is nothing more than \na piece of pagan ethics inserted into Christianity. Shall we say then that \nChristianity did not change the state of things? Early Christians intro­\nduced important changes, if not in the sexual code itself, at least in the \nrelationships everyone has to his own sexual activity. Christianity pro­\nposed a new type of experience of oneself as a sexual being. \nTo make things clearer, I will compare two texts-one written by \nArtemidorus, a pagan philosopher of the third century, and the other \nthe well-known fourteenth book of The City of God by Augustine. \nArtemidorus wrote a book about the interpretation of dreams in the \nthird century after the death of Christ, but he was a pagan. Three chap­\nters of this book are devoted to sexual dreams. What is the meaning, \nor, more precisely, what is the prognostic value, of a sexual dream? It \nis significant that Artemidorus interpreted dreams in a way contrary \nto Freud, and gives an interpretation of sexual dreams in terms of eco­\nnomics, social relations, success and reverses in political activity and \neveryday life. For instance, if you dream that you have sex with your \nmother, that means that you will succeed as a magistrate, since your \nmother is obviously the symbol of your city or country. \nIt is also significant that the social value of the dream depends not on \nthe nature of the sexual act but mainly on the social status of the part­\nners. For instance, for Artemidorus it is not important in your dream \nwhether you had sex with a girl or with a boy. The problem is to know \nif the partner was rich or poor, young or old, slave or free, married or \nnot. Of course, he takes into account the question of the sexual act, but \nhe sees it only from the point of view of the male. The only act he \nknows or recognizes as sexual is penetration. For him, penetration is \nnot only a sexual act but part of the social role of a man in a city. I \nwould say that for Artemidorus sexuality is relational, and that sexual \nrelations cannot be dissociated from social relations. \nNow let us turn to Augustine's text, whose meaning is the point at \nwhich we want to arrive in our analysis. In The City if God, and later \non in the Contra Julian, Augustine gives a rather horrifying descrip-"

All \nthe body, says Augustine, is shaken by terrible jerks; one entirely loses \ncontrol of oneself. \"This sexual act takes such a complete and passion­\nate possession of the whole man, both physically and emotionally, that \nwhat results is the keenest of all pleasures on the level of sensations, \nand at the crisis of excitement it practically paralyzes all power of delib­\nerate thought.\" It is worthwhile to note that this description is not an \ninvention of Augustine: you can find the same in the medical and pagan \nliterature of the previous century. Moreover, Augustine's text is almost \nthe exact transcription of a passage written by the pagan philosopher, \nCicero, in the Hortensius. \nThe surprising point is not that Augustine would give such a classi­\ncal description of the sexual act, but the fact that, having given such a \nhorrible description, he then admits that sexual relations could have \ntaken place in Paradise before the Fall. This is all the more remark­\nable since Augustine is one of the first Christian Fathers to admit the \npossibility. Of course, sex in Paradise could not have the epileptic form \nthat we unfortunately know now. Before the Fall, Adam's body, every \npart of it, was perfectly obedient to the soul and the will. If Adam \nwanted to procreate in Paradise, he could do it in the same way and \nwith the same control as he could, for instance, sow seeds in the earth. \nHe was not involuntarily excited. Every part of his body was like the \nfingers, which one can control in all their gestures. Sex was a kind of \nhand gently sowing the seed. But what happened with the Fall? He rose \nup against God with the first sin; he tried to escape God's will and to \nacquire a will of his own, ignoring the fact that the existence of his own \nwill depended entirely on the will of God. As a punishment for this \nrevolt, and as a consequence of this will to will independently from \nGod, Adam lost control of himself. He wanted to acquire an auton­\nom01.is will and lost the ontological support for that will. That then \nbecame mixed in an indissociable way with involuntary movements, \nand this weakening of Adam's will had a disastrous effect. His body, \nand parts of his body, stopped obeying his commands, revolted against \nhim, and the sexual parts of his body were the first to rise up in this \ndisobedience. The famous gesture of Adam covering his genitals with \na fig leaf is, according to Augustine, due not to the simple fact that \nAdam was ashamed of their presence but to the fact that his sexual \norgans were moving by themselves without his consent.

His uncon­\ntrolled sex is exactly the same as what he himself has been toward \nGod-a rebel. \nWhy have I insisted so much on what may be nothing more than one \nof those exegetic fantasies of which Christian literature has been so \nprodigal? I think this text bears witness to the new type of relationship \nwhich Christianity established between sex and subjectivity. Augustine's \nconception is still dominated by the theme and form of male sexual­\nity. But the main question is not, as it was in Artemidorus, the prob­\nlem of penetration-it is the problem of erection. As a result, it is not \nthe problem of a relationship to other people but the problem of the \nrelationship of oneself to oneself, or, more precisely, the relationship \nbetween one's will and involuntary assertions. \nThe principle of autonomous movements of sexual organs is called \nlibido by Augustine. The problem of libido, of its strength, origin, and \neffect, thus becomes the main issue of one's will. It is not an external \nobstacle to the will; it is a part, an internal component, of the will. And \nit is not the manifestation of petty desires. Libido is the result of one's \nwill when it goes beyond the limits God originally set for it. As a con­\nsequence, the means of the spiritual struggle against libido do not con­\nsist, as with Plato, in turning our eyes upward and memorizing the \nreality we have previously known and forgotten; the spiritual struggle \nconsists, on the contrary, in turning our eyes continuously downward \nor inward in order to decipher, among the movements of the soul, \nwhich ones come from the libido. The task is at first indefinite, since \nlibido and will can never be substantially dissociated from one another. \nAnd this task is not only an issue of mastership but also a question of \nthe diagnosis of truth and illusion. It requires a permanent hermeneu­\ntics of oneself. \nIn such a perspective, sexual ethics imply very strict truth obligations. \nThese consist not only in learning the rules of a moral sexual behavior \nbut also in constantly scrutinizing ourselves as libidinal beings. Shall \nwe say that, after Augustine, we experience our sex in the head? Let \nus say at least that, in Augustine's analysis, we witness a reallibidini­\nzation of sex. His moral theology is, to a certain extent, a systemat­\nization of a lot of previous speculation, but it is also an ensemble of \nspiritual techniques. \nWhen one reads the ascetic and monastic literature of the fourth and \nfifth centuries, one cannot but be struck by the fact that these tech-"

There is little mention of homosexual relations, in spite of the \nfact that most ascetics lived in permanent and numerous communities. \nThe techniques were mainly concerned with the stream of thoughts \nflowing into consciousness, disturbing by their multiplicity the neces­\nsary unity of contemplation and secretly conveying images or sugges­\ntions from Satan. The monk's task was not the philosopher's task: to \nacquire mastership over oneself by the definitive victory of the will. It \nwas perpetually to control one's thoughts, examining them to see if they \nwere pure, whether something dangerous was not hiding in or behind \nthem, if they were not conveying something other than what primarily \nappeared, if they were not a form of illusion and seduction. Such data \nhave always to be considered with suspicion; they need to be scrutinized \nand tested. According to Cassian, for instance, one must be toward one­\nself as a moneychanger, who must try the coins he receives. Real purity \nis not acquired when one can lie down with a young and beautiful boy \nwithout even touching him, as Socrates did with Alcibiades. A monk \nwas really chaste when no impure image occurred in his mind, even \nduring the night, even during dreams. The criterion of purity does not \nconsist in keeping control of oneself even in the presence of the most \ndesirable people; it consists in discovering the truth in myself and de­\nfeating the illusions in myself, in cutting out the images and thoughts \nmy mind continuously produces. Hence the axis of the spiritual struggle \nagainst impurity. The main question of sexual ethics has moved from \nrelations to people, and from the penetration model to the relation to \noneself and to the erection problem: I mean to the set of internal move­\nments that develop from the first and nearly imperceptible thought to \nthe final but still solitary pollution. However different and eventually \ncontradictory they were, a common effect was elicited: sexuality, sub­\njectivity, and truth were strongly linked together.

Cassian emphasizes the fact that the vices do \nnot exist in isolation, even though an individual may be particularly \naffected by one vice or another. 5 There is a causal link that binds them \nall together. It begins with greed, which arises in the body and inflames \nthe spirit of fornication; these two engender avarice, understood as an \nattachment to worldly wealth, which in turn leads to rivalries, quarrel­\ning, and wrath. The result is despondency and sorrow, provoking the \nsin of accidie and total disgust with monastic life. Such a progression \nimplies that one will never be able to conquer a vice unless one can \nconquer the one on which it leans: \"The defeat of the first weakens the \none that depends on it; victory over the former leads to the collapse \nof the latter without further effort.\" As with the others, the greed­\nfornication pair, like \"a huge tree whose shadow stretches afar,\" has \nto be uprooted. Hence the importance for the ascetic of fasting as a way \nof conquering greed and suppressing fornication.

The pureness \nwhich has been making him so self-assured begins to worry him, and \nin the midst of his spiritual well-being he finds himself faltering.\"8 \nWhen the soul has only itself to combat, the wheel comes full circle, \nthe battle begins again, and the prickings of the flesh are felt anew, \nshowing the inevitable continuance of the struggle and the threat of a \nperpetual recurrence. \nFinally, fornication has, as compared with other vices, an ontologi­\ncal particularity that gives it a special ascetic importance. Like greed, \nit is rooted in the body and impossible to beat without chastisement. \nWhile wrath or despondency can be fought only in the mind, fornica­\ntion cannot be eradicated without \"mortifying the flesh, by vigils, fasts \nand back-breaking labor.\"9 This does not exclude-on the contrary­\nthe battle the mind has to wage against itself, since fornication may be \nborn of thoughts, images, and memories. \"When the Devil, with sub­\ntle cunning, has insinuated into our hearts the memory of a woman, \nbeginning with our mother, our sisters, or certain pious women, we \nshould as quickly as possible expel these memories for fear that, if we \nlinger on them too long, the tempter may seize the opportunity to lead \nus unwittingly to think about other women.\" 10 Nevertheless, there is \none fundamental difference between fornication and greed. The fight \nagainst the latter has to be carried on with a certain restraint, since \none cannot give up all food: \"The requirements of life have to be pro­\nvided for ... for fear lest the body, deprived through our own error, may \nlose the strength to carry out the necessary spiritual exercises. \"11 This \nnatural propensity for eating has to be kept at arm's length, treated \nunemotionally, but not abolished. It has its own legitimacy; to repudi­\nate it totally, that is to say, to the point of death, would be to burden \none's soul with a crime. On the other hand, there are no holds barred \nin the fight against the spirit of fornication; everything that can direct \nour steps to it must be eradicated, and no call of nature can be allowed \nto justify the satisfaction of a need in this domain.

Of the eight sins, fornication is the only one that is \nat once innate, natural, physical in origin, and needing to be as totally \ndestroyed as the vices of the soul, such as avarice and pride. There \nmust be severe mortification therefore, which lets us live in our bod­\nies while releasing us from the flesh. \"Depart from this flesh while liv­\ning in the body.\" 12 It is into this region beyond nature, but in our earthly \nlives, that the fight against fornication leads us. It \"drags us from the \nslough of the earth.\" It causes us to live in this world a life that is not \nof this world. Because this mortification is the harshest, it promises the \nmost to us in this world below: \"rooted in the flesh,\" it offers \"the cit­\nizenship which the saints have the promise of possessing once they are \ndelivered from the corruption of the flesh. \"13 \nThus, one sees how fornication, though just one of the elements in \nthe table of vices, has its own special position, heading the causal chain, \nand is the sin chiefly responsible for backsliding and battles, at one of \nthe most difficult and decisive points in the struggle for an ascetic life. \nIn his fifth Conference, Cassian divides fornication into three varie­\nties. The first consists of the \"joining together of the two sexes\" (com­\nmixtio sex us utriusque); the second takes place \"without contact with \nthe woman\" (absque femineo tactu)-the damnable sin of Onan; the \nthird is \"conceived in the mind and the thoughts. \"14 Almost the same \ndistinction is repeated in the twelfth Conference: \"carnal conjuncti0n\" \n(carnalis commixtio), which Cassian callsfornicatio in its restricted \nsense; next uncleanness, immunditia, which takes place without con­\ntact with a woman, while one is either sleeping or awake, and which \nis due to \"the negligence of an unwatchful mind\"; finally there is libido, \nwhich develops in \"the dark corners of the soul\" without \"physical pas­\nsion\" (sine passione corporis). 15 These distinctions are important, for \nthey alone help one to understand what Cassian meant by the general \ntermfornicatio, to which he gives no definition elsewhere; but they are \nparticularly important for the way he uses these three categories-in \na way that differs so much from what one finds in earlier texts. \nThere already existed a traditional trilogy of the sins of the flesh: \nadultery, fornication (meaning sexual relations outside marriage), and \n\"the corruption of children.\" At least these are the three categories to \nbe found in the Didache: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt \nnot commit fornication; thou shalt not seduce young boys.\" 16 And these \nare what we find in the \"Epistle of Saint Barnabas\": \"Do not commit"

Nowhere in the various texts in which he speaks of the \nbattle for chastity does he refer to actual sexual relations. Nowhere are \nthe various sins set out dependent on actual sexual relations-the part­\nner with whom it was committed, his or her age, or possible degree \nof consanguinity. Not one of the categories that in the Middle Ages \nwere to be built up into a great code of sins is to be found here. Doubt­\nless, Cassian, who was addressing an audience of monks who had taken \nvows to renounce all sexual relations, felt he could skip these prelim­\ninaries. One notices, however, that on one very important aspect of \ncelibacy, where Basil of Caesarea and Chrysostom had given explicit \nadvice,2o Cassian does make discreet allusion: \"Let no one, especially \nwhen among young folk, remain alone with another, even for a short \ntime, or withdraw with him or take him by the hand. \"21 He carries on \nhis discussion as if he is only interested in his last two categories (about \nwhat goes on without sexual relationship or physical passion), as if he \nwas passing over fornication as a physical union of two individuals and \nonly devoting serious attention to behavior which up until then had \nbeen severely censured only when leading up to real sexual acts. \nYet even though Cassian's analysis ignores physical sex, and its sphere \nof action is quite solitary and secluded, his reasoning is not purely neg­\native. The whole essence of the fight for chastity is that it aims at a \ntarget which has nothing to do with actions or relationships; it concerns \na different reality than that of a sexual connection between two indi­\nviduals. A passage in the twelfth Conference reveals the nature of this \nreality: in it Cassian describes the six stages that mark the advance \ntoward chastity. The object of the description is not to define chastity \nitself but to pick out the negative signs by which one can trace prog­\nress toward it-the various signs of impurity that disappear one by"

He \ncan stop thinking about things that have arisen in his mind involuntar­\nily and in spite of himself.22 \nThird stage: When a glimpse of the world outside can no longer \narouse lustful feelings, and one can look upon a woman without any \nfeeling of desire. \nFourth stage: One no longer in one's waking hours feels any, even \nthe most innocent, movement of the flesh. Does Cas sian mean that \nthere is no movement of the flesh, and that therefore one has total con­\ntrol over one's own body? Probably not, since elsewhere he often insists \non the persistence of involuntary bodily movements. The term he uses, \npeiferre, signifies no doubt that such movements are not capable of \naffecting the mind [arne], which thus does not suffer from them. \nFifth stage: \"If the subject of a discourse or the logical consequence \nof a reading involves the idea of human procreation, the mind does not \nallow itself to be touched by the remotest thought of sexual pleasure, \nbut contemplates the act in a mood of calmness and purity, as a simple \nfunction, a necessary adjunct to the prolongation of the human race, \nand departs no more affected by the recollection of it than if it had been \nthinking about brickmaking or some other trade.\" \nFinally, the last stage is reached when our sleep is not troubled by \nthe vision of a seductive woman. Even though we may not think it a \nsin to be subject to such illusions, it is however a sign that some lust­\nful feeling still lurks in the depths of our being.23 \nAmid all this description of the different symptoms of fornication, \ngradually fading out as one approaches the state of chastity, there is no \nmention of relationships with others, no acts, not even any intention \nof committing one. In fact, there is no fornication in the strict sense of \nthe word. This microcosm of the solitary life lacks the two major ele­\nments on which is centered not only the sexual ethic of the philoso­\nphers of the ancient world but also that of a Christian like Clement of \nAlexandria (at least in Epistle 2 of his Pedagogus), namely, the sexual"

Cassian is interested in the movements of the body and the mind \n[arne], images, feelings, memories, faces in dreams, the spontaneous \nmovements of thoughts, the consenting (or refusing) will, waking and \nsleeping. And two poles are sketched out which, it must be stressed, \ndo not coincide with the body and soul. They are, first, the involun­\ntary pole, which consists either of physical movements or of feelings \nevoked by memories and images that survive from the past and ferment \nin the mind, besieging and enticing the will; and, second, the pole of \nthe will itself, which accepts or repels, averts its eyes or allows itself \nto be ensnared, holds back or consents. On the one side, then, bodily \nand mental reflexes that bypass the mind [arne] and, becoming infected \nwith impurity, may proceed to corruption [pollution], and on the other \nside, an internal play of thoughts. Here we find the two kinds of \"for­\nnication\" as broadly defined by Cassian, to which he confines the whole \nof his analysis, leaving aside the question of physical sex. His theme is \nirnrnunditia, something that catches the mind [arne], waking or sleep­\ning, off its guard and can lead to pollution, without any contact with \nanother; and the libido, which develops in thE: dark comers of the mind \n[arne]. In this connection, Cassian reminds us that libido has the same \norigin as libet (\"it pleases\") .24 \nThe spiritual battle and the advance toward chastity, whose six stages \nare described by Cassian, can thus be seen as a task of dissociation. We \nare now far away from the rationing of pleasure and its strict limita­\ntion to permissible actions; far away, too, from the idea of a separation \nas drastic as possible between mind [arne] and body. But what does con­\ncern us is a never-ending struggle over the movements of our thoughts \n(whether they extend or reflect those of our body, or whether they \nmotivate them), over its simplest manifestations, over the factors that \ncan activate it. The aim is that the subject should never be affected in \nhis effort by the obscurest or the most seemingly \"unwilled\" presence \nof will. The six stages that lead to chastity represent steps toward the \ndisinvolvement of the will. The first step is to exclude its involvement \nin bodily reactions; then exclude it from the imagination (not to linger \non what crops up in one's mind); then exclude it from the action of \nthe senses (cease to be conscious of bodily movements); then exclude it \nfrom figurative involvement (cease to think of things as possible objects \nof desire); and, finally, oneiric involvement (the desires that may be \nstirred by images that appear, albeit spontaneously, in dreams).

It is \nagainst this that spiritual combat-and the effort at dissociation, at \ndisimplication that it pursues-is turned. \nHere is the reason why, all through this battle against the spirit of \nfornication and for chastity, the sole fundamental problem is that of \npollution-whether as something that is subservient to the will and a \npossible form of self-indulgence, or as something happening spon­\ntaneously and involuntarily in sleep or dreams. So important is it that \nCassian makes the absence of erotic dreams and nocturnal pollution a \nsign that one has reached the pinnacle of chastity. He often returns to \nthis topic: \"The proof that one has achieved this state of purity will be \nthat no apparition will beguile us when resting or stretched out in \nsleep\"25; or again, \"This is the sum of integrity and the final proof: \nthat we are not visited by voluptuous thoughts during sleep and that \nwe should be unaware of the pollutions to which we are subjected by \nnature. \"26 The whole of the twenty-second Conference is devoted to the \nquestion of \"nocturnal pollutions\" and \"the necessity of using all our \nstrength to be delivered from them.\" And on various occasions, Cassian \ncalls to mind holy characters like Serenus, who had attained such a \nhigh degree of virtue that they were never troubled by inconveniences \nof this kind. 27 \nObviously, in a rule of life where renunciation of all sexual rela­\ntions was absolutely basic, it was quite logical that this topic should \nassume such importance. One is reminded of the importance, in groups \ninspired by Pythagorean ideas, accorded the phenomena of sleep and \ndreams for what they reveal about the quality of existence, and to the \nself-purification that was supposed to guarantee its serenity. Above all, \none must realize that nocturnal pollution raised problems where rit­\nual purity was concerned, and it was precisely these problems which \nprompted the twenty-second Conference: can one draw near to the \n\"holy altars\" and partake of the bread and wine when one has suffered \nnocturnal defilement?28 But even if all these reasons can explain such \npreoccupations among the theoreticians of monastic life, they cannot \naccount for the absolutely central position occupied by the question of \nvoluntary/involuntary pollution in the whole discussion of the battle \nfor chastity. Pollution was not simply the object of a stricter ban than \nanything else, or harder to control. It was a yardstick [analyseur] of \nconcupiscence, in that it helped to decide-in the light of what formed"

The monk concentrates his whole energy on never letting \nhis will be involved in this reaction, which goes from the body to the \nmind [arne] and from the mind [arne] to the body, and over which the \nwill may have a hold, either to encourage it or halt it through mental \nactivity. The first five stages of the advance toward chastity constitute \nincreasingly subtle disengagements of the will from the increasingly \nrestricted reactions that may bring on this pollution. \nThere remains the final stage, attainable by holiness: absence of \n\"absolutely\" involuntary pollutions during sleep. Again, Cassian points \nout that these pollutions are not necessarily all involuntary. Overeating \nand impure thoughts during the day all show that one is willing, if not \nintending, to have them. He makes a distinction between the type of \ndream that accompanies them and the images' degree of impurity. Any­\none who is taken by surprise would be wrong to blame his body or \nsleep: \"It is a sign of the corruption that festers within, and not just a \nproduct of the night. Buried in the depth of the soul, the corruption \nhas come to the surface during sleep, revealing the hidden fever of pas­\nsions with which we have become infected by glutting ourselves all day \nlong on unhealthy emotions. \"29 Finally, there is the pollution that is \ntotally involuntary, devoid of the pleasure that implies consent, with­\nout even the slightest trace of a dream image. Doubtless this is the goal \nattainable by the ascetic who has practiced with sufficient rigor; the pol­\nlution is only a \"residue\" in which the person concerned plays no part. \n\"We have to repress the reactions of our minds and the emotions of our \nbodies until the flesh can satisfy the demands of nature without giv­\ning rise to any pleasurable feelings, getting rid of the excess of our bod­\nily humors without any unhealthy urges and without having to plunge \nback into the battle for our chastity. \"30 Since this is a supranatural phe­\nnomenon, only a supranatural power can give us this freedom, spiritual \ngrace. This is why nonpollution is the sign of holiness, the stamp of \nthe highest chastity possible, a blessing one may hope for but not attain. \nFor his part, man must do nothing less than remain in relation to \nhimself in a state of perpetual vigilance even as far as the least impulses \nthat might be produced in his body or his soul are concerned.

This is not the way \nthe question should be framed. \nThe organization of monasticism and the dimorphism that de­\nveloped between monastic and secular life brought aqout important \nchanges in the problem of sexual renunciation.

In the mystique of virginity which developed after the thir­\nteenth century, the rigor of this renunciation (in line with the theme, \nalready found in Tertullian, of union with Christ) transforms the neg­\native aspect of continence into the promise of spiritual marriage.

This subjectivation is \nlinked with a process of familiarization which makes the obligation \nto seek and state the truth about oneself an indispensable and perma­\nnent condition of this asceticism; and if there is subjectivation, it also \ninvolves an indeterminate objectivization of the self by the self-inde­\nterminate in the sense that one must be forever extending as far as pos­\nsible the range of one's thoughts, however insignificant and innocent \nthey may appear to be. Moreover, this subjectivation, in its quest for \nthe truth about oneself, functions through complex relations with oth­\ners, and in many ways. One must rid oneself of the power of the Other, \nthe Enemy, who hides behind seeming likenesses of oneself, and eter­\nnal warfare must be waged against this Other, which one cannot win \nwithout the help of the Almighty, who is mightier than he.

Nor did I intend to analyze \nreligious, moral, medical, or biological ideas about sexuality. Not that \nsuch inquiries should be considered illegitimate, impossible, or ster­\nile; plenty of work has proved otherwise.

In this sense, thought is understood as the very \nform of action-as action insofar as it implies the play of true and false, \nthe acceptance or refusal of rules, the relation to oneself and others. \nThe study of forms of experience can thus proceed from an analysis of \n\"practices\" -discursive or not-as long as one qualifies that word to \nmean the different systems of action insofar as they are inhabited by \nthought as I have characterized it here. \nPosing the question in this way brings into play certain altogether \ngeneral principles. Singular forms of experience may perfectly well \nharbor universal structures; they may well not be independent of the \nconcrete determinations of social existence. However, neither those \ndeterminations nor those structures can allow for experiences (that is, \nfor understandings of a certain type, for rules of a certain form, for cer­\ntain modes of consciousness of oneself and of others) except through \nthought. There is no experience that is not a way of thinking and can­\nnot be analyzed from the viewpoint of the history of thought; this is \nwhat might be called the principle of irreducibility of thought. Accord­\ning to a second principle, this thought has a historicity which is proper \nto it. That it should have this historicity does not mean it is deprived \nof all universal form but, rather, that the putting into play of these \nuniversal forms is itself historical. And that this historicity should be \nproper to it means not that it is independent of all the other historical \ndeterminations (of an economic, social, or political order) but that it \nhas complex relations with them, which always leave their specificity \nto the forms, transformations, and events of thought. This is what could \nbe called the principle of singularity of the history of thought: there are \nevents of thought. There is a third and final principle implied by this \nenterprise: an awareness that criticism-understood as analysis of the \nhistorical conditions that bear on the creation of links to truth, to rules, \nand to the self-does not mark out impassable boundaries or describe \nclosed systems; it brings to light transformable singularities. These \ntransformations could not take place except by means of a working of \nthought upon itself; that is the principle of the history of thought as \ncritical activity.

It is easy to see how the reading of Nietzsche \nin the early fifties has given access to these kinds of questions, by break­\ning with the double tradition of phenomenology and Marxism. \nI know this rereading is schematic: things did not really unfold so \nneatly, and there were many obscurities and hesitations along the way. \nBut in Madness and Civilization I was trying, after all, to describe a \nlocus of experience from the viewpoint of the history of thought, even \nif my usage of the word \"experience\" was very floating.

It is also these three axes and the play between \ntypes of understanding [savoir], forms of normality, and modes of rela­\ntion to oneself and others which seemed to me to give individual cases \nthe status of significant experiences-cases such as those of Pierre \nRiviere or Alexina B.-and to assign a like importance to that perma­\nnent dramatization of family affairs which one finds in the lettres de \ncachet (whereby people committed their relatives to asylums) in the \neighteenth century. \nYet the relative importance of these three axes is not always the same \nfor all forms of experience. And, moreover, it was necessary to elabo­\nrate the analysis of each a little more precisely, starting with the prob­\nlem of the formation of domains of knowledge [savoir].

Then, once scientific knowledge [savoir] was endowed with \nits own rules for which external determinations could not account-its \nown structure as discursive practice-I tried to show what common, \nbut transformable, criteria-what epistemes [ipistemes]-governed \nthose bodies of knowledge which, from the seventeenth to the early \nnineteenth centuries, had been charged with explaining certain aspects \nof human activity or existence: the wealth men produce, exchange, and \ncirculate; the linguistic signs they use to communicate; and the collec­\ntivity of living things to which they belong. \nIt is the second axis-the relation to rules-that I wanted to explore \nusing the example of punitive practices. It was a matter not of study­\ning the theory of penal law itself, or the evolution of such and such \npenal institution, but of analyzing the formation of a certain \"punitive \nrationality\" whose appearance might seem that much more surprising \nin that it offered, as its principal means of action, a practice of impris­\nonment which had long been and still was criticized at the time. Instead \nof seeking the explanation in a general conception of the law, or in the \nevolving modes of industrial production (as Rusche and Kirchheimer \ndid), it seemed to me far wiser to look at the workings of power. I was \nconcerned not with some omnipresent power, almighty and above all \nclairvoyant, diffusing itself throughout the social body in order to con­\ntrol it down to the tiniest detail, but with the refinement, the elab­\noration, and the installation since the seventeenth centu ry of techniques \nfor \"governing\" individuals-that is, for \"guiding their conduct\"-in \ndomains as different as the school, the army, and the workshop.

In this sense, \nit has a role very close to that of confession to the director, about which \nJohn Cassian will say, in keeping with Evagrian spirituality, that it must \nreveal, without exception, all the impulses of the soul (omnes cogi­\ntationes). Finally, writing about inner impulses appears, also accord­\ning to Athanasius's text, as a weapon in spiritual combat. While the \nDevil is a power who deceives and causes one to be deluded about one­\nself (fully half of the Vita Antonii is devoted to these ruses), writing \nconstitutes a test and a kind of touchstone: by bringing to light the \nimpulses of thought, it dispels the darkness where the enemy's plots \nare hatched. This text-one of the oldest that Christian literature has \nleft us on the subject of spiritual writing-is far from exhausting all the \nmeanings and forms the latter will take on later. But one can focus on \nseveral of its features that enable one to analyze retrospectively the role \nof writing in the philosophical cultivation of the self just before Chris­\ntianity: its close link with companionship, its application to the impulses \nof thought, its role as a truth test.

In any case, the \ntexts from the imperial epoch relating to practices of the self placed a \ngood deal of stress on writing.

Yet one \nalso sees that writing is associated with the exercise of thought in two \ndifferent ways. One takes the form of a linear \"series\": it goes from \nmeditation to the activity of writing and from there to gumnazein, that \nis, to training and trial in a real situation-a labor of thought, a labor \nthrough writing, a labor in reality. The other is circular: the medita­\ntion precedes the notes which enable the rereading which in turn re­\ninitiates the meditation.

Thus, when Fundamus \nrequests advice for struggling against the agitations of the soul, Plutarch \nat that moment does not really have the time to compose a treatise \nin the proper form, so he will send him, in their present state, the \nhupomnemata he had written himself on the theme of the tranquil­\nity of the soul; at least this is how he introduces the text of the Peri \neuthumias. 5 Feigned modesty? Doubtless this was a way of excusing the \nsomewhat disjointed character of the text, but the gesture must also be \nseen as an indication of what these notebooks were-and of the use to \nmake of the treatise itself, which kept a little of its original form. \nThese hupomnemata should not be thought of simply as a memory \nsupport, which might be consulted from time to time, as occasion arose; \nthey are not meant to be substituted for a recollection that may fail. \nThey constitute, rather, a material and a framework for exercises to be \ncarried out frequently: reading, rereading, meditating, conversing with \noneself and with others.

Inside a culture strongly stamped \nby traditionality, by the recognized value of the already-said, by the \nrecurrence of discourse, by \"citational\" practice under the seal of antiq­\nuity and authority, there developed an ethic quite explicitly oriented by \nconcern for the self toward objectives defined as: withdrawing into \noneself, getting in touch with oneself, living with oneself, relying on \noneself, benefiting from and enjoying oneself. Such is the aim of the \nhupomnemata: to make one's recollection of the fragmentary logos, \ntransmitted through teaching, listening, or reading, a means of estab­\nlishing a relationship of oneself with oneself, a relationship as adequate \nand accomplished as possible. For us, there is something paradoxical \nin all this: how could one be brought together with oneself with the \nhelp of a timeless discourse accepted almost everywhere? In actual fact, \nif the writing of hupomnemata can contribute to the formation of the \nself through these scattered logoi, this is for three main reasons: the \nlimiting effects of the coupling of writing with reading, the regular \npractice of the disparate that determines choices, and the appropria­\ntion which that practice brings about. \n1.

This practice can be con­\nnected to a very general theme of the period; in any case, it is common \nto the moral philosophy of the Stoics and that of the Epicureans-the \nrefusal of a mental attitude turned toward the future (which, due to its \nuncertainty, causes anxiety and agitation of the soul) and the positive \nvalue given to the possession of a past that one can enjoy to the full and \nwithout disturbance. The hupomnemata contribute one of the means \nby which one detaches the soul from concern for the future and redi­\nrects it toward contemplation of the past. \n2. Yet while it enables one to counteract dispersal, the writing of the \nhupomnemata is also (and must remain) a regular and deliberate prac­\ntice of the disparate. It is a selecting of heterogeneous elements. In this, \nit contrasts with the work of the grammarian, who tries to get to know \nan entire work or all the works of an author; it also conflicts with the \nteaching of professional philosophers who subscribe to the doctrinal \nunity of a school. It does not matter, says Epictetus, whether one has \nread all of Zeno or Chrysippus; it makes little difference whether one \nhas grasped exactly what they meant to say, or whether one is able to \nreconstruct their whole argument. 9 The notebook is governed by two \nprinciples, which one might call \"the local truth of the precept\" and \n\"its circumstantial use value.\" Seneca selects what he will note down \nfor himself and his correspondents from one of the philosophers of \nhis own sect, but also from Democritus and Epicurus. 10 The essential \nrequirement is that he be able to consider the selected sentence as a \nmaxim that is true in what it asserts, suitable in what it prescribes, and \nuseful in terms of one's circumstances. Writing as a personal exercise \ndone by and for oneself is an art of disparate truth-or, more exactly, \na purposeful way of combining the traditional authority of the already­\nsaid with the singularity of the truth that is affirmed therein and the \nparticularity of the circumstances that determine its use. \"So you should \nalways read standard authors; and when you crave a change, fall back \nupon those whom you read before.

This deliberate heterogeneity does not rule out unification. But the \nlatter is not implemented in the art of composing an ensemble; it must \nbe established in the writer himself, as a result of the hupomnemata, \nof their construction (and hence in the very act of writing) and of their \nconsultation (and hence in their reading and their rereading). Two \nprocesses can be distinguished. On the one hand, it is a matter of uni­\nfying these heterogeneous fragments through their subjectivation in the \nexercise of personal writing. Seneca compares this unification, accord­\ning to quite traditional metaphors, with the bee's honey gathering, or \nthe digestion of food, or the adding of numbers forming a sum: \"We \nshould see to it that whatever we have absorbed should not be allowed \nto remain unchanged, or it will be no part of us. We must digest it; \notherwise it will merely enter the memory and not the reasoning power \n[in memoriam non in ingenium].

And this body should be understood not as a body of doctrine but, \nrather-following an often-evoked metaphor of digestion-as the very \nbody of the one who, by transcribing his readings, has appropriated \nthem and made their truth his own: writing transforms the thing seen \nor heard \"into tissue and blood\" (in vires et in sanguinem). It becomes \na principle of rational action in the writer himself. \nYet, conversely, the writer constitutes his own identity through this \nrecollection of things said. In this same Letter 84-which constitutes \na kind of short treatise on the relations between reading and writing­\nSeneca dwells for a moment on the ethical problem of resemblance, \nof faithfulness and originality. One should not, he explains, reshape \nwhat one retains from an author in such a way that the latter might be \nrecognized; the idea is not to constitute, in the notes that one takes and \nin the way one restores what one has read through writing, a series of \n\"portraits,\" recognizable but \"lifeless\" (Seneca is thinking here of those"

It is. one's own \nsoul that must be constituted in what one writes; but, just as a man \nbears his natural resemblance to his ancestors on his face, so it is good \nthat one can perceive the filiation of thoughts that are engraved in his \nsoul. Through the interplay of selected readings and assimilative writ­\ning, one should be able to form an identity through which a whole spir­\nitual genealogy can be read. In a chorus there are tenor, bass, and \nbaritone voices, men's and women's tones: \"The voices of the individ­\nual singers are hidden; what we hear is the voices of all together ... I \nwould have my mind of such a quality as this; it should be equipped \nwith many arts, many precepts, and patterns of conduct taken from \nmany epochs of history; but all should blend harmoniously into one.\" n \nCORRESPONDENCE \nNotebooks, which in themselves constitute personal writing exercises, \ncan serve as raw material for texts that one sends to others. In return, \nthe missive, by definition a text meant for others, also provides occa­\nsion for a personal exercise. For, as Seneca points out, when one writes \none reads what one writes, just as in saying something one hears one­\nself saying it. The letter one writes acts, through the very action of writ­\ning, upon the one who addresses it, just as it acts through reading and \nrereading on the one who receives it. In this dual function, correspon­\ndence is very close to the hupomnemata, and its form is often very simi­\nlar. Epicurean literature furnishes examples of this. The text known as \nthe \"Letter to Pythocles\" begins by acknowledging receipt of a letter \nin which the student has expressed his affection for the teacher and \nhas made an effort to \"recall the [Epicurean] arguments\" enabling one \nto attain happiness; the author of the reply gives his endorsement: the \nattempt was not bad; and he sends in return a text-a summary of \nEpicurus's Peri phuseos-that should serve Pythocles as material for \nmemorization and as a support for his meditation. 14 \nSeneca's letters show an activity of direction brought to bear, by a \nman who is aged and already retired, on another who still occupies \nimportant public offices. But in these letters, Seneca does not just give \nhim advice and comment on a few great principles of conduct for his \nbenefit.

The advice he gives in Letter 7 \nconstitutes a description of his own relations with Lucilius. There he \ncharacterizes the way in which he occupies his retirement with the two­\nfold work he carries out at the same time on his correspondent and on \nhimself: withdrawing into oneself as much as possible; attaching one­\nself to those capable of having a beneficial effect on oneself; opening \none's door to those whom one hopes to make better-\"The process is \nmutual; for men learn while they teach.\" 15 \nThe letter one sends in order to help one's correspondent-advise \nhim, exhort him, admonish him, console him-constitutes for the writer \na kind of training: something like soldiers in peacetime practicing the \nmanual of arms, the opinions that one gives to others in a pressing sit­\nuation are a way of preparing oneself for a similar eventuality. For \nexample, Letter 99 to Lucilius: it is in itself the copy of another mis­\nsive that Seneca had sent to Marullus, whose son had died some time \nbefore. 16 The text belongs to the \"consolation\" genre: it offers the cor­\nrespondent the \"logical\" arms with which to fight sorrow. The inter­\nvention is belated, since Marullus, \"shaken by the blow,\" had a moment \nof weakness and \"lapsed from his true self\"; so, in that regard, the let­\nter has an admonishing role. Yet for Lucilius, to whom it is also sent, \nand for Seneca who writes it, it functions as a principle of reactiva­\ntion-a reactivation of all the reasons that make it possible to overcome \ngrief, to persuade oneself that death is not a misfortune (neither that \nof others nor one's own). And, with the help of what is reading for the \none, writing for the other, Lucilius and Seneca will have increased their \nreadiness for the case in which this type of event befalls them. The \nconsolatio that should assist and correct Marullus is at the same time \na useful praemeditatio for Lucilius and Seneca. The writing that aids \nthe addressee arms the writer-and possibly the third parties who \nread it. \nYet it also happens that the soul service rendered by the writer to \nhis correspondent is handed back to him in the form of \"return advice\"; \nas the person being directed progresses, he becomes more capable, in \nhis turn, of giving opinions, exhortations, words of comfort to the one \nwho has undertaken to help him. The direction does not remain one­\nway for long; it serves as a context for exchanges that help it become \nmore egalitarian.

The \nletter makes the writer \"present\" to the one to whom he addresses it. \nAnd present not simply through the information he gives concerning \nhis life, his activities, his successes and failures, his good luck or mis­\nfortunes; rather, present with a kind of immediate, almost physical \npresence. \"I thank you for writing to me so often; for you are revealing \nyourself to me [te mihi ostendzS] in the only way you can.

Through the missive, one opens oneself \nto the gaze of others and puts the correspondent in the place of the \ninner god. It is a way of giving ourselves to that gaze about which we \nmust tell ourselves that it is plunging into the depths of our heart (in \npectis intimum introspicere) at the moment we are thinking. \nThe work the letter carries out on the recipient, but is also brought \nto bear on the writer by the very letter he sends, thus involves an \"intro­\nspection\"; but the latter is to be understood not so much as a deci­\npherment of the self by the self as an opening one gives the other onto \noneself. Still, we are left with a phenomenon that may be a little sur­\nprising, but which is full of meaning for anyone wishing to write a his­\ntory of the cultivation of the self: the first historical developments of \nthe narrative of the self are not to be sought in the direction of the \"per­\nsonal notebooks,\" the hupomnemata, whose role is to enable the for­\nmation of the self out of the collected discourse of others; they can be \nfound, on the other hand, in the correspondence with others and the \nexchange of soul service. And it is a fact that in the correspondence of \nSeneca with Lucilius, of Marcus Aurelius with Fronto, and in certain \nof Pliny's letters, one sees a narrative of the self develop that is very \ndifferent from the one that could be found generally in Cicero's letters \nto his acquaintances: the latter involved accounting for oneself as a sub­\nject of action (or of deliberation for action) in connection with friends \nand enemies, fortunate and unfortunate events. In Seneca and Marcus \nAurelius, occasionally in Pliny as well, the narrative of the self is the \naccount of one's relation to oneself; there one sees two elements stand \nout clearly, two strategic points that will later become the privileged \nobjects of what could be called the writing of the relation to the self: \nthe interferences of soul and body (impressions rather than actions), \nand leisure activity (rather than external events); the body and the days. \n1.

For example, the long and important \nLetter 78 to Lucilius: it is devoted for the most part to the problem of \nthe \"good use\" of illnesses and suffering; but it opens with the recol­\nlection of a grave illness that Seneca had suffered in his youth, which \nwas accompanied by a moral crisis. Seneca relates that he also experi­\nenced, many years before, the \"catarrh,\" the \"short attacks of fever\" \nLucilius complains of: \"I scorned it in its early stages. For when 1 was \nstill young, 1 could put up with hardships and show a bold front to ill­\nness. But 1 finally succumbed, and arrived at such a state that 1 could \ndo nothing but snuffle, reduced as 1 was to the extremity of thinness. \n1 often entertained the impulse of ending my life then and there; but \nthe thought of my kind old father kept me back.\" And what cured him \nwere the remedies of the soul. Among them, the most important were \nhis friends, who \"helped me greatly towards good health; 1 used to be \ncomforted by their cheering words, by the hours they spent at my bed­\nside, and by their conversation. \"23 It also happens that the letters retrace \nthe movement that has led from a subjective impression to an exercise \nof thought. Witness that meditation walk recounted by Seneca: \"I found \nit necessary to give my body a shaking up, in order that the bile which \nhad gathered in my throat, if that was the trouble, might be shaken out, \nor, if the very breath [in my lungs] had become, for some reason, too \nthick, that the jolting, which 1 have felt was a good thing for me, might \nmake it thinner. So 1 insisted on being carried longer than usual, along \nan attractive beach, which bends between Cumae and Servilius Vatia's \ncountry house, shut in by the sea on one side and the lake on the other, \njust like a narrow path. It was packed under foot, because of a recent \nstorm .... As my habit is, 1 began to look about for something there that \nmight be of service to me, when my eyes fell upon the villa which had \nonce belonged to Vatia. \"24 And Seneca tells Lucilius what formed his \nmeditation on retirement-solitude and friendship. \n2. The letter is also a way of presenting oneself to one's correspon­\ndent in the unfolding of everyday life. To recount one's day-not because \nof the importance of the events that may have marked it, but precisely \neven though there was nothing about it apart from its being like all the \nothers, testifying in this way not to the importance of an activity but to \nthe quality of a mode of being-forms part of the epistolary practice:"

I shall keep watching myself continually, and-a most \nuseful habit-shall review each day.\" Indeed, Seneca evokes this spe­\ncific day that has gone by, which is at the same time the most ordi­\nnary of all. Its value is owing to the very fact that nothing has happened \nwhich might have diverted him from the only thing that is important \nfor him: to attend to himself. \"Today has been unbroken; no one has \nfilched the slightest part of it from me.\" A little physical training, a bit \nof running with a pet slave, a bath in water that is barely lukewarm, a \nsimple snack of bread, a very short nap. But the main part of the day­\nand this is what takes up the longest part of the letter-is devoted to \nmeditating on the theme suggested by a Sophistic syllogism of Zeno's, \nconcerning drunkenness. 25 \nWhen the missive becomes an account of an ordinary day, a day to \noneself, one sees that it relates closely to a practice that Seneca dis­\ncreetly alludes to, moreover, at the beginning of Letter 85, where he \nevokes the especially useful habit of \"reviewing one's day\": this is \nthe self-examination whose form he had described in a passage of the \nDe lra.26 This practice-familiar in different philosophical currents: \nPythagorean, Epicurean, Stoic-seems to have been primarily a men­\ntal exercise tied to memorization: it was a question of both constituting \noneself as an \"inspector of oneself,\" and hence of gauging the common \nfaults, and of reactivating the rules of behavior that one must always \nbear in mind. Nothing indicates that this \"review of the day\" took the \nform of a written text. It seems therefore that it was in the epistolary \nrelation-and, consequently, in order to place oneself under the other's \ngaze-that the examination of conscience was formulated as a written \naccount of oneself: an account of the everyday banality, an account of \ncorrect or incorrect actions, of the regimen observed, of the physical or \nmental exercises in which one engaged. One finds a notable example \nof this conjunction of epistolary practice with self-examination in a let­\nter from Marcus Aurelius to Franto. It was written during one of those \nstays in the country which were highly recommended as moments of \ndetachment from public activities, as health treatments, and as occa­\nsions for attending to oneself.

There \nis a very significant difference between interdictions about sexuality and \nother forms of interdiction. Unlike other interdictions, sexual inter­\ndictions are constantly connected with the obligation to tell the truth \nabout oneself. \nTwo facts may be raised against me: first, that confession played an \nimportant part in penal and religious institutions for all offenses, not \nonly in sex. But the task of analyzing one's sexual desire is always more \nimportant than analyzing any other kind of sin. \nI am also aware of the second objection: that sexual behavior more \nthan any other was submitted to very strict rules of secrecy, decency, \nand modesty so that sexuality is related in a strange and complex way \nboth to verbal prohibition and to the obligation to tell the truth, of \nhiding what one does and of deciphering who one is. \n*This text derives from a seminar Foucault gave at the University of Vermont in Octo­\nber 1982. It appears here amended for style and clarity; it has been supplemented with \nnotes to correspond to the text in Dils el ecrils."

The theme of the renunciation of the \nflesh was linked to the confession of the monk to the abbot, to the \nmonk confiding to the abbot everything that was on his mind. \nI conceived of a rather odd project: not the study of the evolution of \nsexual behavior but of the historical study of the link between the obli­\ngation to tell the truth and the prohibitions weighing on sexuality. I \nasked: How had the subject been compelled to decipher himself in \nregard to what was forbidden? It is a question that interrogates the \nrelation between asceticism and truth. \nMax Weber posed the question: If one wants to behave rationally and \nregulate one's action according to true principles, what part of one's \nself should one renounce? What is the ascetic price of reason? To what \nkind of asceticism should one submit? I posed the opposite question: \nHow have certain kinds of interdictions required the price of certain \nkinds of knowledge about oneself? What must one know about one­\nself in order to be willing to renounce anything? \nThus, I arrived at the hermeneutics of technologies of the self in \npagan and early Christian practice. I encountered certain difficulties \nin this study because these practices are not well known. First, Chris­\ntianity has always been more interested in the history of its beliefs than \nin the history of real practices. Second, such a hermeneutics was never \norganized into a body of doctrine like textual hermeneutics. Third, \nthe hermeneutics of the self has been confused with'theologies of the \nsoul-concupiscence, sin, and the fall from grace. Fourth, a herme­\nneutics of the self has been diffused across Western culture through \nnumerous channels and integrated with various types of attitudes and \nexperience, so that it is difficult to isolate and separate it from our own \nspontaneous experiences. \nContext if Study \nMy objective for more than twenty-five years has been to sketch out a his­\ntory of the different ways in our culture that humans develop knowledge \nabout themselves: economics, biology, psychiatry, medicine, and penol­\nogy.

Among the Greeks, these \npractices took the form of a precept: epimeleisthai sautou, \"to take care \nof yourself,\" to take \"care of the self,\" \"to be concerned, to take care \nof yourself. \" \nThe precept of the \"care of the self\" [soud de SOl] was, for the Greeks, \none of the main principles of cities, one of the main rules for social \nand personal conduct and for the art of life. For us now, this notion is \nrather obscure and faded. When one is asked \"What is the most impor­\ntant moral principle in ancient philosophy?\" the immediate answer is \nnot \"Take care of oneself\" but the Delphic principle, gnothi seauton \n(\" Know yourself\"). \nWithout doubt, our philosophical tradition has overemphasized the \nlatter and forgotten the former. The Delphic principle was not an ab­\nstract one concerning life; it was technical advice, a rule to be observed \nfor the consultation of the oracle. \"Know yourself\" meant \"Do not sup­\npose yourself to be a god.\" Other commentators suggest that it meant \n\"Be aware of what you really ask when you come to consult the oracle.\" \nIn Greek and Roman texts, the injunction of having to know one­\nself was always associated with the other principle of the care of the \nself, and it was that need to care for oneself that brought the Delphic \nmaxim into operation. It is implicit in all Greek and Roman culture \nand has been explicit since Plato's Alcibiades 1.1 In the Socratic dia­\nlogues, in Xenophon, Hippocrates, and in the Neoplatonist tradition \nfrom Albinus on, one had to be concerned with oneself. One had to \noccupy oneself with oneself before the Delphic principle was brought \ninto action. There was a subordination of the second principle to the \nformer. I have three or four examples of this. \nIn Plato's Apology, 2ge, Socrates presents himself before his judges \nas a master of epimeleia heautou. 2 You \"preoccupy yourselves without \nshame in acquiring wealth and reputation and honors,\" he tells them, \nbut you do not concern yourselves with yourselves, that is, with \"wis­\ndom, truth and the perfection of the soul.\" He, on the other hand, \nwatches over the citizens to make sure they concern themselves with \nthemselves. \nSocrates says three important things with regard to his invitation to"

(2) For this task he demands no reward; he is disinter­\nested; he performs it out of benevolence. (3) His mission is useful for \nthe city-more useful than the Athenians' military victory at Olympia­\nbecause, in teaching people to occupy themselves with themselves, he \nteaches them to occupy themselves with the city. \nEight centuries later, one finds the same notion and the same phrase \nin Gregory of Nyssa's treatise, On Virginity, but with an entirely dif­\nferent meaning. Gregory did not mean the movement by which one \ntakes care of oneself and the city; he meant the movement by which \none renounces the world and marriage as well as detaches oneself from \nthe flesh and, with virginity of heart and body, recovers the immortal­\nity of which one has been deprived. In commenting on the parable of \nthe drachma (Luke 15.8-10), Gregory exhorts man to light his lamp \nand turn the house over and search, until gleaming in the shadow he \nsees the drachma within. In order to recover the efficacy that God has \nprinted on the human soul and the body has tarnished, man must take \ncare of himself and search every corner of his soul. '\\ \nWe see that Christian asceticism and ancient philosophy are placed \nunder the same sign: that of the care of the self. The obligation to know \noneself is one of the central elements of Christian asceticism. Between \nthese two extremes-Socrates and Gregory of Nyssa-taking care of \noneself constituted not only a principle but also a constant practice. \nI have two more examples. The first Epicurean text to serve as a \nmanual of morals was the Letter to Menoeceus. 1 Epicurus writes that \nit is never too early, never too late, to occupy oneself with one's soul. \nOne should philosophize when one is young and also when one is old. \nIt is a task to be carried on throughout life. Precepts governing every­\nday life are organized around the care of the self in order to help every \nmember of the group with the common task of salvation. \nAnother example comes from an Alexandrian text, On the Contem­\nplative Life, by Philo of Alexandria. He describes an obscure, enigmatic \ngroup on the periphery of Hellenistic and Hebraic culture called the \nTherapeutae, marked by its religiosity. It is an austere community, \ndevoted to reading, to healing meditation, to individual and collective \nprayer, and to meeting for a spiritual banquet (agape, \"feast\").

I would like to analyze the relation between \nthe care of the self and knowledge of the self, the relation found in \nGreco-Roman and Christian traditions between the preoccupation an \nindividual has with himself and the too-well-known principle \"Know \nyourself.\" Just as there are different forms of care, there are different \nforms of self. \nSummary \nThere are several reasons why \"Know yourself\" has obscured \"Take \ncare of yourself.\" First, there has been a profound transformation in the \nmoral principles of Western society. We find it difficult to base rigor­\nous morality and austere principles on the precept that we should give \nmore care to ourselves than to anything else in the world. We are more \ninclined to see taking care of ourselves as an immorality, as a means \nof escape from all possible rules. We inherit the tradition of Christian \nmorality which makes self-renunciation the condition for salvation. To \nknow oneself was, paradoxically, a means of self-renunciation. \nWe also inherit a secular tradition that sees in external law the basis \nfor morality. How then can respect for the self be the basis for moral­\nity? We are the inheritors of a social morality that seeks the rules for \nacceptable behavior in relations with others. Since the sixteenth cen­\ntury, criticism of established morality has been undertaken in the name \nof the importance of recognizing and knowing the self. Therefore, it is \ndifficult to see the care of the self as compatible with morality. \"Know \nthyself\" has obscured \"Take care of yourself\" because our morality, a \nmorality of asceticism, insists that the self is that which one can reject. \nThe second reason is that, in theoretical philosophy from Descartes \nto Husserl, knowledge of the self (the thinking subject) takes on an \never-increasing importance as the first step in the theory of knowledge. \nTo summarize: There has been an inversion in the hierarchy of the \ntwo principles of antiquity, \"Take care of yourself\" and \"Know your­\nself.\" In Greco-Roman culture, knowledge of oneself appeared as the \nconsequence of the care of the self. In the modern world, knowledge \nof oneself constitutes the fundamental principle. \nII \nThe first philosophical elaboration of the concern with taking care of \noneself that I wish to consider is found in Plato's Alcibiades /.

They wanted to transform Plato's dialogues into a \npedagogical tool, to make them the matrix for encyclopedic knowledge. \nThey considered Alcibiades to be the first dialogue of Plato-the first \nto be read, the first to be studied. It was the arkhe. In the second cen­\ntury, Albinus said that every gifted young man who wanted to stand \napart from politics and practice virtue should study the Alcibiades. 6 It \nprovided the point of departure and a program for all Platonic philos­\nophy. \"Taking care of oneself\" is its first principle. I would like to ana­\nlyze the care of self in the Alcibiades I in terms of three aspects. \n\"1. How is this question introduced into the dialogue? What are the \nreasons Alcibiades and Socrates are brought to the notion of the care \nof the self? \nAlcibiades is about to begin his public and political life. He wishes \nto speak before the people and be all-powerful in the city. He is not \nsatisfied with his traditional status, with the privileges of his birth and \nheritage. He wishes to gain personal power over all others both inside \nand outside the city. At this point of intersection and transformation, \nSocrates intervenes and declares his love for Alcibiades. Alcibiades can \nno longer be the beloved; he must become a lover. He must become \nactive in the political and the love game. Thus, there is a dialectic \nbetween political and erotic discourse. Alcibiades makes his transition \nin specific ways in both politics and love. \nAn ambivalence is evident in Alcibiades' political and erotic vocab­\nulary. During his adolescence, Alcibiades was desirable and had many \nadmirers, but now that his beard is growing, his suitors are disappear­\ning. Earlier, he had rejected them all in the bloom of his beauty because \nhe wanted to be dominant, not dominated. He refused to let himself \nbe dominated in youth, but now he wants to dominate others. This is \nthe moment Socrates appears, and he succeeds where the others have \nfailed: he will make Alcibiades submit, but in a different sense. They \nmake a pact-Alcibiades will submit to his lover, Socrates, not in a \nphysical but in a spiritual sense. The intersection of political ambition \nand philosophical love is \"the care of the self.\" \n2. In such a relationship, why should Alcibiades be concerned with"

Socrates asks Alcibiades about his personal capacities and the \nnature of his ambition. Does he know the meaning of the rule of law, \nof justice or concord? Alcibiades clearly knows nothing. Socrates calls \nupon him to compare his education with that ofthe Persian and Spartan \nkings, his rivals. Spartan and Persian princes have teachers in wisdom, \njustice, temperance, and courage. By comparison, Alcibiades' educa­\ntion is like that of an old, ignorant slave: he doesn't know these things, \nso he can't apply himself to knowledge. But, says Socrates, it is not too \nlate. To help him gain the upper hand-to acquire tekhne-Alcibiades \nmust apply himself, he must take care of himself. But Alcibiades does \nnot know to what he must apply himself. What is this knowledge he \nseeks? He is embarrassed and confused. Socrates calls upon him not \nto lose heart. \nIn 127d of the Alcibiades we find the first appearance of the phrase \nepimeleisthai sautou. Concern for self always refers to an active politi­\ncal and erotic state. Epimeleisthai expresses something much more seri­\nous than the simple fact of paying attention. It involves various things: \ntaking pains with one's holdings and one's health. It is always a real \nactivity and not just an attitude. It is used in reference to the activity \nof a farmer tending his fields, his cattle, and his house, or to the job \nof the king in taking care of his city and citizens, or to the worship of \nancestors or gods, or as a medical term to signify the fact of caring. It \nis highly significant that the concern for self in Alcibiades I is directly \nrelated to a defective pedagogy, one that concerns political ambition \nand a specific moment of life. \n3. The rest of the text is devoted to an analysis of this notion of \nepimeleisthai, \"taking pains with oneself.\" It is divided into two ques­\ntions: What is this self of which one has to take care, and of what does \nthat care consist? \nFirst, what is the self (12gb)? Selfis a reflexive pronoun, and it has \ntwo meanings. Auto means \"the same,\" but it also conveys the notion of \nidentity. The latter meaning shifts the question from \"What is this self?\" \nto \"Departing from what ground shall I find my identity?\" Alcibiades \ntries to find the self in a dialectical movement. When you take care of \nthe body, you do not take care of the self. The self is not clothing, tools, \nor possessions; it is to be found in the principle that uses these tools, \na principle not of the body but of the soul. You have to worry about your \nsoul-that is the principal activity of caring for yourself. The care of the"

Of what does this care consist? One must know \nof what the soul consists. The soul cannot know itself except by looking \nat itself in a similar element, a mirror. Thus, it must contemplate the \ndivine element. In this divine contemplation, the soul will be able to \ndiscover rules to serve as a basis for just behavior and political action. \nThe effort of the soul to know itself is the principle on which just polit­\nical action can be founded, and Alcibiades will be a good politician \ninsofar as he contemplates his soul in the divine element. \nOften the discussion gravitates around and is phrased in terms of the \nDelphic principle \"Know yourself.\" To take care of oneself consists of \nknowing oneself. Knowing oneself becomes the object of the quest of \nconcern for self. Being occupied with oneself and political activities are \nlinked. The dialogue ends when Alcibiades knows he must take care \nof himself by examining his soul. \nThis text, one of Plato's first, illuminates the historical background \nof the precept \"taking care of oneself\" and sets out four main problems \nthat endure throughout antiquity, although the solutions offered often \ndiffer from those in Plato's Alcibiades. \nFirst, there is the problem of the relation between the care of the \nself and political activity. In the later Hellenistic and imperial periods, \nthe question is presented in an alternative way: When is it better to \nturn away from political activity to concern oneself with oneself? \nSecond, there is the problem of the relationship between the care \nof the self and pedagogy. For Socrates, occupying oneself with oneself \nis the duty of a young man, but later in the Hellenistic period it is seen \nas the permanent duty of one's whole life. \nThird, there is the problem of the relationship between the care of \nthe self and the knowledge of oneself. Plato gave priority to the Delphic \nmaxim \"Know yourself.\" The privileged position of \"Know yourself\" \nis characteristic of all Platonists. Later, in the Hellenistic and Greco­\nRoman periods, this is reversed: the accent was not on the knowledge \nof self but on the concern with oneself. The latter was given an auton­\nomy and even a preeminence as a philosophical issue. \nFourth, there is the problem of the relationship between the care of \nself and philosophical love, or the relation to a master. \nIn the Hellenistic and imperial periods, the Socratic notion of \"the \ncare of the self\" became a common, universal philosophical theme."

      "text": "Ethics: Subjectivity and Truth \n\"Care of the self\" was accepted by Epicurus and his followers, by the \nCynics, and by such Stoics as Seneca, Rufus, and Galen. The Pythag­\noreans gave attention to the notion of an ordered life in common. This \ntheme of the care of the self was not abstract advice but a widespread \nactivity, a network of obligations and services to the soul. Following \nEpicurus himself, the Epicureans believed that it is never too late to \noccupy oneself with oneself. The Stoics say you must attend to the self, \n\"retire into the self and stay there.\" Lucian parodied the notion'? It \nwas an extremely widespread activity, and it brought about competi­\ntion between the rhetoricians and those who turned toward themselves, \nparticularly over the question of the role of the master. \nThere were charlatans, of course, but certain individuals took it seri­\nously. It was generally acknowledged that it was good to be reflective, \nat least briefly. Pliny advises a friend to set aside a few moments a day, \nor several weeks or months, for a retreat into himself. This was an \nactive leisure-to study, to read, to prepare for misfortune or death. It \nwas a meditation and a preparation. \nWriting was also important in the culture of the care of the self. One \nof the tasks that defines the care of the self is that of taking notes on one­\nself to be reread, writing treatises and letters to friends to help them, \nand keeping notebooks in order to reactivate for oneself the truths one \nneeded. Seneca's letters are an example of this self-exercise. \nIn traditional political life, oral culture was largely dominant, and \ntherefore rhetoric was important. Yet the development of the adminis­\ntrative structures and the bureaucracy of the imperial period increased \nthe amount and role of writing in the political sphere. In Plato's writ­\nings, dialogue gave way to the literary pseudodialogue. By the Hel­\nlenistic age, though, writing prevailed, and real dialectic passed to \ncorrespondence. Taking care of oneself became linked to constant writ­\ning activity. The self is something to write about, a theme or object \n(subject) of writing activity. That is not a modern trait born of the Ref­\normation or of Romanticism; it is one of the most ancient Western tra­\nditions. It was well established and deeply rooted when Augustine \nstarted his Confessions. 8 \nThe new care of the self involved a new experience of self. The new \nform of the experience of the self is to be seen in the first and second \ncenturies, when introspection becomes more and more detailed.

My talk was this: \"What do you think \nmy Fronto is now doing?\" Then she: \"And what do you think my Gratia is \ndoing?\" Then I: \"And what do you think our little sparrow, the wee Gratia, \nis doing?\" Whilst we were chattering in this way and disputing which of \nus two loved the one or other of you two the better, the gong sounded, an \nintimation that my father had gone to his bath. So we had supper after we \nhad bathed in the oil-press room; I do not mean bathed in the oil-press \nroom, but when we had bathed, had supper there, and we enjoyed hearing \nthe yokels chaffing one another. After coming back, before I turn over and \nsnore, I get my task done and give my dearest of masters an account of the \nday's doings, and if I could miss him more, I would not grudge wasting \naway a little more. Farewell, my Fronto, wherever you are, most honey­\nsweet, my love, my delight. How is it between you and me? I love you and \nyou are away.9 \nThis letter presents a description of everyday life.

For \nthe Stoics, the body was not so important, but Marcus Aurelius speaks \nof himself, his health, what he has eaten, his sore throat. That is quite \ncharacteristic of the ambiguity about the body in this cultivation of the \nself. Theoretically, the cultivation of the self is soul-oriented, but all \nthe concerns of the body take on a considerable importance. In Pliny \nand Seneca, hypochondria is an essential trait. They retreat to a house \nin the countryside. They have intellectual activities but rural activities as \nwell. They eat and participate in the activities of peasants. The impor­\ntance of the rural retreat in this letter is that nature helps put one in \ncontact with oneself. \nThere is also a love relationship between Aurelius and Fronto, one \nbetween a twenty-four-year-old and a forty-year-old man. Ars erotica \nis a theme of discussion. Homosexual love was important in this period \nand carried over into Christian monasticism. \nFinally, in the last lines, there is an allusion to the examination of \nconscience at the end of the day. Aurelius goes to bed and looks in the \nnotebook to see what he was going to do and how it corresponds to \nwhat he did. The letter is the transcription of that examination of con­\nscience. It stresses what the individual did, not what he thought. That \nis the difference between practice in the Hellenistic and imperial peri­\nods and later monastic practice. In Seneca, too, there are only deeds, \nnot thoughts; but it does prefigure Christian confession. \nThis genre of epistles shows a side apart from the philosophy of the \nera. The examination of conscience begins with this letter-writing. \nDiary-writing comes later. It dates from the Christian era and focuses \non the notion of the struggle of the soul. \nIII \nIn my discussion of Plato's Alcibiades, I have isolated three major \nthemes: (1) the relation between care of the self and care for the polit­\nicallife; (2) the relation between the care of the self and defective edu­\ncation; and (3) the relation between the care of the self and knowing \noneself. Whereas we saw in the Alcibiades the close relation between \n\"Take care of yourself\" and \"Know yourself,\" taking care of yourself \neventually was absorbed in knowing yourself."

      "text": "Technologies if the Self \nWe can see these three themes in Plato, also in the Hellenistic period, \nand four to five centuries later in Seneca, Plutarch, Epictetus, and the \nlike. If the problems are the same, the solutions and themes are quite \ndifferent and, in some cases, the opposite of the Platonic meanings. \nFirst, to be concerned with self in the Hellenistic and Roman peri­\nods is not exclusively a preparation for political life. Care of the self \nhas become a universal principle. One must leave politics to take bet­\nter care of the self. \nSecond, the concern with oneself is not just obligatory for young \npeople concerned with their education; it is a way of living for every­\nbody throughout their lives. \nThird, even if self-knowledge plays an important role in the care of \nthe self, it involves other relationships as well. \nI want to discuss briefly the first two points: the universality of the \ncare of the self independent of political life, and the care of the self \nthroughout one's life. \n1. A medical model was substituted for Plato's pedagogical model. \nThe care of the self isn't another kind of pedagogy; it has to become \npermanent medical care. Permanent medical care is one of the central \nfeatures of the care of the self. One must become the doctor of oneself. \n2. Since we have to take care throughout life, the objective is no \nlonger to get prepared for adult life, or for another life, but to get pre­\npared for a certain complete achievement of life. This achievement is \ncomplete at the moment just prior to death. This notion of a happy \nproximity to death-of old age as completion-is an inversion of the \ntraditional Greek values on youth. \n3. Lastly, we have the various practices to which cultivation of self \nhas given rise and the relation of self-knowledge to these. \nIn Alcibiades I, the soul had a mirror relation to itself, which relates \nto the concept of memory and justifies dialogue as a method of dis­\ncovering truth in the soul. Yet from the time of Plato to the Hellenistic \nage, the relationship between care of the self and knowledge of the self \nchanged. We may note two perspectives. \nIn the philosophical movements of Stoicism in the imperial period, \nthere is a different conception of truth and memory, and another \nmethod of examining the self. First, we see the disappearance of dia­\nlogue and the increasing importance of a new pedagogical relation­\nship-a new pedagogical game where the master-teacher speaks and \ndoes not ask questions, and the disciple does not answer but must lis-"

In Pythagorean cultivation, disciples kept silent for five years \nas a pedagogical rule. They did not ask questions or speak up during \nthe lesson, but they developed the art of listening. This is the posi­\ntive condition for acquiring truth. The tradition is picked up during \nthe imperial period, where we see the beginning of the cultivation of \nsilence and the art of listening rather than the cultivation of dialogue \nas in Plato. \nTo learn the art of listening, we have to read Plutarch's treatise on \nthe art of listening to lectures, Peri tou akouein. 10 At the beginning of \nthis treatise, Plutarch says that, following schooling, we must learn to \nlisten to logos throughout our adult life. The art of listening is crucial \nso that you can tell what is true and what is dissimulation, what is rhe­\ntorical truth and what is falsehood in the discourse of the rhetoricians. \nListening is linked to the fact that the disciple is not under the control \nof the masters but must listen to logos. One keeps silent at the lecture; \none thinks about it afterward. This is the art of listening to the voice \nof the master and the voice of reason in the self. \nThe advice may seem banal, but I think it is important. In his trea­\ntise On the Contemplative Life, Philo of Alexandria describes banquets \nof silence, not debauched banquets with wine, boys, revelry, and dia­\nlogue. There is instead a teacher who gives a monologue on the inter­\npretation of the Bible and a very precise indication of the way people \nmust listen.ll For example, they must always assume the same posture \nwhen listening. The morphology of this notion is an interesting theme \nin monasticism and pedagogy henceforth. \nIn Plato, the themes of contemplation of self and care of self are \nrelated dialectically through dialogue. Now in the imperial period, we \nhave the theories of, on one side, the obligation of listening to the truth \nand, on the other side, of looking and listening to the self for the truth \nwithin. The difference between the one era and the other is one of the \ngreat signs of the disappearance of the dialectical structure. \nWhat was an examination of conscience in this culture, and how \ndoes one look at oneself? For the Pythagoreans, the examination of con­\nscience had to do with purification. Since sleep was related to death \nas a kind of encounter with the gods, one had to purify oneself before \ngoing to sleep. Remembering the dead was an exercise for the mem­\nory. But in the Hellenistic and the early imperial periods, you see this \npractice acquiring new values and signification. There are several rel-"

I) \nSeneca's De Ira (Book Three) contains some traces of the old tradi­\ntion.14 He describes an examination of conscience. The same thing was \nrecommended by the Epicureans, and the practice was rooted in the \nPythagorean tradition. The goal was the purification of the conscience \nusing a mnemonic device. Do good things, have a good examination \nof the self, and a good sleep follows together with good dreams, which \nis contact with the gods. \nSeneca seems to use juridical language, and it seems that the self is \nboth the judge and the accused. Seneca is the judge and prosecutes the \nself so that the examination is a kind of trial. Yet if you look closer, it is \nrather different from a court: Seneca uses terms related not to juridical \nbut to administrative practices, as when a comptroller looks at the books \nor when a building inspector examines a building. Self-examination is \ntaking stock. Faults are simply good intentions left undone. The rule is \na means of doing something correctly, not judging what has happened \nin the past. Later, Christian confession will look for bad intentions. \nIt is this administrative view of his own life much more than the \njuridical model that is important. Seneca is not a judge who has to pun­\nish but a stock-taking administrator. He is a permanent administrator \nof himself, not a judge of his past. He sees that everything has been \ndone correctly following the rule but not the law. It is not real faults \nfor which he reproaches himself but, rather, his lack of success. His \nerrors are of strategy, not of moral character. He wants to make adjust­\nments between what he wanted to do and what he had done, and to \nreactivate the rules of conduct, not excavate his guilt. In Christian con­\nfession, the penitent is obliged to memorize laws but does so in order \nto discover his sins. \nFor Seneca, the problem is not that of discovering truth in the sub­\nject but of remembering truth, recovering a truth that has been forgot­\nten. Second, the subject does not forget himself, his nature, origin, or \nhis supernatural affinity, but the rules of conduct, what he ought to have \ndone. Third, the recollection of errors committed in the day measures \nthe distinction between what has been done and what should have been \ndone. Fourth, the subject is not the operating ground for the process \nof deciphering but the point where rules of conduct come together in \nmemory.

A retreat into the country becomes a spiritual retreat into one­\nself. It is a general attitude and also a precise act every day; you retire \ninto the self to discover-but not to discover faults and deep feelings, \nonly to remember rules of action, the main laws of behavior. It is a \nmnemotechnical formula. \nIV \nI have spoken of three Stoic technologies of the self: letters to friends \nand disclosure of self; examination of self and conscience, including a \nreview of what was done, of what should have been done, and com­\nparison of the two. Now I want to consider the third Stoic technique, \naskesis, not a disclosure of the secret self but a remembering. \nFor Plato, one must discover the truth that is within one. For the \nStoics, truth is not in oneself but in the fogoi, the teachings of the mas­\nters. One memorizes what one has heard, converting the statement one \nhears into rules of conduct. The subjectivation of truth is the aim of \nthese techniques. During the imperial period, one could not assimilate \nethical principles without a theoretical framework such as science, as \nfor example in Lucretius's De Rerum natura. 15 There are structural \nquestions underlying the practice of the examination of the self every \nnight. I want to underscore the fact that in Stoicism it is not the deci­\nphering of the self, not the means to disclose secrecy, which is impor­\ntant; it is the memory of what one has done and what one has had to do. \nIn Christianity, asceticism always refers to a certain renunciation of \nthe self and of reality because most of the time the self is a part of that \nreality that must be renounced in order to gain access to another level \nof reality. This move to attain the renunciation of the self distinguishes \nChristian asceticism. \nIn the philosophical tradition inaugurated by Stoicism, askesis means \nnot renunciation but the progressive consideration of self, or mastery \nover oneself, obtained not through the renunciation of reality but \nthrough the acquisition and assimilation of truth. It has as its final \naim not preparation for another reality but access to the reality of this"

It \nis a set of practices by whicp one can acquire, assimilate, and trans­\nfonn truth into a pennanent principle of action. Aletheia becomes ethos. \nIt is a process of the intensification of subjectivity. \nWhat are the principal features of askesis? They include exercises \nin which the subject puts himself in a situation in which he can verify \nwhether he can confront events and use the discourses with which he \nis anned. It is a question of testing the preparation. Is this truth assim­\nilated enough to become ethics so that we can behave as we must when \nan event presents itself? \nThe Greeks characterized the two poles of those exercises by the \nterms melete and gymnasia. Melete means \"meditation,\" according to \nthe Latin translation, meditatio. It has the same root as epimeleisthai. \nIt is a rather vague term, a technical term borrowed from rhetoric. \nMelete is the work one undertakes in order to prepare a discourse or \nan improvisation by thinking over useful terms and arguments. It is a \nmatter of anticipating the real situation through dialogue in one's \nthoughts. The philosophical meditation is this kind of meditation: it \nis composed of memorizing responses and reactivating those memo­\nries by placing oneself in a situation where one can imagine how one \nwould react. One judges the reasoning one should use in an imaginary \nexercise (\"Let us suppose ... \") in order to test an action or event (for \nexample, \"How would I react?\"). Imagining the articulation of possible \nevents to test how one would react-that is meditation. \nThe most famous exercise of meditation is the praemeditatio mal­\norum as practiced by the Stoics. It is an ethical, imaginary experience. \nIn appearance, it is a rather dark and pessimistic vision of the future. \nYou can compare it to what Husserl says about eidetic reduction. \nThe Stoics developed three eidetic reductions of future misfortune. \nFirst, it is not a question of imagining the future as it is likely to turn \nout but to imagine the worst that can happen, even if there is little \nchance that it will turn out that way-the worst as certainty, as actual­\nizing what could happen, not as calculation of probability. Second, one \nshould not envisage things as possibly taking place in the distant future \nbut as already actual and in the process of taking place. For example, \nimagining not that one might be exiled but rather that one is already \nexiled, subjected to torture, and dying.

It consists of having at the same time the future \nand the present event. The Epicureans were hostile to it because they \nthought it was useless: they thought it was better to recollect and mem­\norize past pleasures in order to derive pleasure from present events. \nAt the opposite pole is gymnasia (\"to train oneself\"). While meditatio \nis an imaginary experience that trains thought, gymnasia is training in \na real situation, even if it has been artificially induced. There is a long \ntradition behind this: sexual abstinence, physical privation, and other \nrituals of purification. \nThose practices of abstinence have other meanings than purification \nor witnessing demonic force, as in Pythagoras and Socrates. In the cul­\nture of the Stoics, their function is to establish and test the indepen­\ndence of the individual with regard to the external world. For example, \nin Plutarch's On the Daemon if Socrates, one gives oneself over to very \nhard sporting activities. Or one tempts oneself by placing oneself in \nfront of many tantalizing dishes and then renouncing them; then one \ncalls his slaves and gives them the dishes, and takes the meal prepared \nfor the slaves. 16 Another example is Seneca's Letter 18 to Lucilius: he \nprepares for a great feast day by acts of mortification of the flesh in \norder to convince himself that poverty is not an evil, and that he can \nendure itY \nBetween these poles of training in thought and training in reality, \nmelete and gymnasia, there are a whole series of intermediate pos­\nsibilities. Epictetus provides the best example of the middle ground \nbetween these poles. He wants to watch perpetually over representa­\ntions, a technique that will find its apogee in Freud. There are two \nmetaphors important from his point of view: the night watchman, who \nwill not admit anyone into town if that person cannot prove who he is \n(we must be \"watchmen\" over the flux of thought), 18 and the money­\nchanger, who verifies the authenticity of currency, looks at it, weighs \nand assures himself of its worth. We have to be moneychangers of our \nown representations, of our thoughts, vigilantly testing them, verify­\ning them, their metal, weight, effigy.19 \nThe same metaphor of the moneychanger is found in the Stoics \nand in early Christian literature, but with different meanings.

The \nfirst are exercises borrowed from school, question-and-answer games. \nThis must be an ethical game; that is, it must teach a morallesson. 21 \nThe second are ambulatory exercises. In the morning you go for a walk, \nand you test your reactions to that walk. The purpose of both exercises \nis control of representations, not the deciphering of truth. They are \nreminders about conforming to the rules in the face of adversity. A pre­\nFreudian machine of censorship is described word for word in the tests \nof Epictetus and Cassian. For Epictetus, the control of representations \nmeans not deciphering but recalling principles of acting, and thus see­\ning, through self-examination, if they govern one's life. It is a kind of \npermanent self-examination. One must be one's own censor. The medi­\ntation on death is the culmination of all these exercises. \nIn addition to letters, examination, and askesis, we must now evoke \na fourth technique in the examination of the self, the interpretation of \ndreams.

Most Stoics are critical and skeptical about such interpretation; \nbut there is still the popular and general practice of it. There were \nexperts who were able to interpret dreams, including Pythagoras and \nsome of the Stoics, and some experts who wrote books to teach people \nto interpret their own dreams. There were huge amounts of literature \non how to do it, but the only surviving dream manual is The Interpre­\ntation of Dreams by Artemidorus (second century A.D.).22 Dream inter­\npretation was important because, in antiquity, the meaning of a dream \nwas an announcement of a future event. \nI should mention two other documents dealing with the importance \nof dream interpretation for everyday life. The first is by Synesius of \nCyrene in the fourth century A.D.23 He was well known and cultivated. \nEven though he was not a Christian, he asked to be a bishop.

Each person has the duty to know who he is, that is, to try to \nknow what is happening inside him, to acknowledge faults, to recog­\nnize temptations, to locate desires; and everyone is obliged to disclose \nthese things either to God or to others in the community and, hence, \nto bear public or private witness against oneself.

Access \nto truth cannot be conceived of without purity of the soul. Purity of the \nsoul is the consequence of self-knowledge and a condition for under­\nstanding the text: quis fadt veritatem (to make truth in oneself, to get \naccess to the light), in Augustine. \nI would like to analyze the ways by which, in order to get access to \nthe light, the Church conceived of illumination: the disclosure of the \nself. The sacrament of penance and the confession of sins are rather \nlate innovations. Christians of the first centuries had different forms \nfor discovering and deciphering truth about themselves. One of the \ntwo main forms of these discourses can be characterized by the word \nexomologesis, or \"recognition of fact.\" Even the Latin fathers used this \nGreek term with no exact translation. For Christians, it meant to rec­\nognize publicly the truth of their faith or to recognize publicly that they \nwere Christians. \nThe word also had a penitential meaning. When a sinner seeks pen­\nance, he must visit the bishop and ask for it. In early Christianity, pen­\nitence was not an act or a ritual but a status imposed on somebody who \nhad committed very serious sins. \nExomologesis was a ritual of recognizing oneself as a sinner and pen­\nitent. It had several characteristics. First, you were a penitent for four \nto ten years, and this status affected your life. There was fasting, and \nthere were rules about clothing and prohibitions about sex; the indi­\nvidual was marked so he could not live the same life as others. Even \nafter his reconciliation, he suffered from a number of prohibitions; for \nexample, he could not marry or become a priest. \nWithin this status you find the obligation of exomologesis. The sin­\nner seeks his penance. He visits the bishop and asks the bishop to \nimpose on him the status of a penitent. He must explain why he wants \nthe status, and he must explain his faults. This was not a confession; it \nwas a condition of the status. Later, in the medieval period, exomolo­\ngesis became a ritual that took place at the end of the period of pen­\nance, just before reconciliation. This ceremony placed him among the \nother Christians. Of this recognition ceremony, Tertullian says that \nwearing a hair shirt and ashes, wretchedly dressed, the sinner stands \nhumbled before the church. Then he prostrates himself and kisses the \nbrethren's knees. 25 Exomologesis is not a verbal behavior but the dra­\nmatic recognition of one's status as a penitent. Much later, in the Epistles"

People \nwept with her, lending drama to her public chastisement. \nRecognition also designates the entire process that the penitent expe­\nriences in this status over the years. He is the aggregate of manifested \npenitential behavior, of self-punishment as well as of self-revelation. \nThe acts by which he punishes himself are indistinguishable from the \nacts by which he reveals himself: self-punishment and the voluntary \nexpression of the self are bound together. This link is evident in many \nwritings; Cyprian, for example, talks of exhibitions of shame and mod­\nesty. Penance is not nominal but theatrical.27 \nTo prove suffering, to show shame, to make visible humility and \nexhibit modesty-these are the main features of punishment. Peni­\ntence in early Christianity is a way of life acted out at all times by \naccepting the obligation to disclose oneself. It must be visibly repre­\nsented and accompanied by others who recognize the ritual. This \napproach endured until the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. \nTertullian uses the term publicatio sui to characterize exomologesis. \nPublicatio sui is related to Seneca's daily self-examination, which was, \nhowever, completely private. For Seneca, exomologesis or publicatio sui \ndoes not imply verbal analysis of deeds or thoughts; it is only a soma,tic \nand symbolic expression. What was private for the Stoics was public \nfor the Christians. \nWhat were its functions? First, this publication was a way to rub out \nsin and to restore the purity acquired by baptism. Second, it was also to \nshow a sinner as he is. That is the paradox at the heart of exomologesis: \nit rubs out the sin and yet reveals the sinner. The greater part of the \nact of penitence was not in telling the truth of sin but in showing the \ntrue sinful being of the sinner; it was not a way for the sinner to explain \nhis sins but a way to present himself as a sinner. \nWhy should showing forth efface the sins? Expose is the heart of \nexomologesis. In the Christianity of the first centuries, Christian authors \nhad recourse to three models to explain the relation between the par­\nadox of rubbing out sins and disclosing oneself. \nThe first is the medical model: one must show one's wounds in \norder to be cured. Another model, which was less frequent, was the \ntribunal model of judgment: one always appeases one's judge by con­\nfessing faults. The sinner plays devil's advocate, as will the devil on the \nDay of Judgment."

The theories and prac­\ntices of penance were elaborated around the problem of the man who \nprefers to die rather than to compromise or abandon the faith; the way \nthe martyr faces death is the model for the penitent. For the relapsed \nto be reintegrated into the Church, he must expose himself voluntarily \nto ritual martyrdom. Penance is the affect of change, of rupture with \nself, past, and world. It is a way to show that you are able to renounce \nlife and self, to show that you can face and accept death. Penitence of \nsin does not have as its target the establishing of an identity but, instead, \nserves to mark the refusal of the self, the breaking away from self: ego \nnon sum, ego. This formula is at the heart of publicatio sui. It repre­\nsents a break with one's past identity. These ostentatious gestures have \nthe function of showing the truth of the state of being of the sinner. \nSelf-revelation is at the same time self-destruction. \nThe difference between the Stoic and Christian traditions is that in \nthe Stoic tradition examination of self, judgment, and discipline show \nthe way to self-knowledge by superimposing truth about self through \nmemory, that is, by memorizing the rules. In exomologesis, the penitent \nsuperimposes truth about self by violent rupture and dissociation. It is \nimportant to emphasize that this exomologesis is not verbal. It is sym­\nbolic, ritual, and theatrical. \nVI \nDuring the fourth century, we find a very different technology for the \ndisclosure of the self, exagoreusis, much less famous than exomologesis \nbut more important. This one is reminiscent of the verbalizing exer­\ncises in relation to a teacher-master of the pagan philosophical schools. \nWe can see the transfer of several Stoic techniques of the self to Chris­\ntian spiritual techniques. \nAt least one example of self-examination, proposed by Chrysostom, \nwas exactly the same form and the same administrative character as that \ndescribed by Seneca in De Ira. In the morning, we must take account \nof our expenses, and in the evening we must ask ourselves to render \naccount of our conduct of ourselves, to examine what is to our advan­\ntage and what is prejudicial against us, with prayers instead of indis­\ncreet words. 28 That is exactly the Senecan style of self-examination. \nIt is also important to note that this self-examination is rare in Chris­\ntian literature."

      "text": "Ethics: Subjectivity and Truth \nThe well-developed and elaborated practice of the self-examination \nin monastic Christianity is different from the Senecan self-examination \nand very different from Chrysostom and from exomologesis. This new \nkind of practice must be understood from the viewpoint of two prin­\nciples of Christian spirituality: obedience and contemplation. \nIn Seneca, the relationship of the disciple with the master was im­\nportant, but it was instrumental and professional. It was founded on \nthe capacity of the master to lead the disciple to a happy and autono­\nmous life through good advice. The relationship would end when the \ndisciple gained access to that life. \nFor a long series of reasons, obedience has a very different charac­\nter in monastic life. It differs from the Greco-Roman type of relation \nto the master in the sense that obedience is not based just upon a need \nfor self-improvement but must bear on all aspects of a monk's life. \nThere is no element in the life of the monk which may escape from \nthis fundamental and permanent relation of total obedience to the \nmaster. Cas sian repeats an old principle from the oriental tradition: \n\"Everything the monk does without permission of his master consti­\ntutes a theft. \"29 Here, obedience is complete control of behavior by the \nmaster, not a final autonomous state. It is a sacrifice of the self, of the \nsubject's own will. This is the new technology of the self. \nThe monk must have the permission of his director to do anything, \neven die. Everything he does without permission is stealing; there is \nnot a single moment when the monk can be autonomous. Even when \nhe becomes a director himself, he must retain the spirit of obedience. \nHe must keep the spirit of obedience as a permanent sacrifice of the \ncomplete control of behavior by the master. The self must constitute \nitself through obedience. \nThe second feature of monastic life is that contemplation is consid­\nered the supreme good. It is the obligation of the monk to turn his \nthoughts continuously to that point which is God and to make sure that \nhis heart is pure enough to see God. The goal is permanent contem­\nplation of God. \nThis new technology of the self, which developed from obedience \nand contemplation in the monastery, presents some peculiar charac­\nteristics. Cassian gives a rather clear exposition of this technology of \nthe self, a principle of self-examination which he borrowed from the \nSyrian and Egyptian monastic traditions. \nThis technology of self-examination of oriental origins, dominated"

With Cassian, \nthe object is not past actions of the day-it is the present thoughts. \nSince the monk must continuously turn his thoughts toward God, he \nmust scrutinize the actual course of this thought. This scrutiny thus has \nas its object the permanent discrimination between thoughts which lead \ntoward God and those which don't. This continual concern with the \npresent is different from the Senecan memorization of deeds and their \ncorrespondence with rules. It is what the Greeks referred to with a \npejorative word: logismoi, \"cogitations, reasoning, calculating thought.\" \nThere is an etymology of logismoi in Cassian, but I do not know if it is \nsound: co-agitationes. The spirit is polukinetos, \"perpetually moving.\"3o \nIn Cassian, perpetual mobility of spirit is the spirit's weakness. It dis­\ntracts one from contemplation of GOd.31 \nThe scrutiny of conscience consists of trying to immobilize conscious­\nness, to eliminate movements of the spirit which divert one from God. \nThat means we must examine any thought that presents itself to con­\nsciousness to see the relation between act and thought, truth and real­\nity, to see if there is anything in this thought which will move our spirit, \nprovoke our desire, turn our spirit away from God. The scrutiny is \nbased on the idea of a secret concupiscence. \nThere are three major types of self-examination: (1) self-examination \nwith respect to thoughts in correspondence to reality (Cartesian); (2) \nself-examination with respect to the way our thoughts relate to rules \n(Sene can) ; (3) the examination of self with respect to the relation \nbetween the hidden thought and an inner impurity. At this moment \nbegins the Christian hermeneutics of the self with its deciphering of \ninner thoughts. It implies that there is something hidden in ourselves \nand that we are always in a self-illusion that hides the secret. \nIn order to make this kind of scrutiny, Cassian says we must care \nfor ourselves, to attest to our thoughts directly. He gives three analo­\ngies. First is the analogy of the mill. 32 Thoughts are like grains, and \nconsciousness is the mill store: it is our role as the miller to sort out \namong the grains those which are bad and those which can be admitted \nto the mill store to give the good flour and good bread of our salvation. \nSecond, Cassian makes military analogies. 33 He uses an analogy of \nthe officer who orders the good soldiers to march to the right, the bad \nto the left. We must act like officers who divide soldiers into two files, \nthe good and the bad."

      "text": "Ethics: Subjectivity and Truth \nThird, he uses the analogy of a moneychanger. 34 Conscience is the \nmoneychanger of the self. It must examine coins, their effigy, their \nmetal, where they came from. It must weigh them to see if they have \nbeen ill used. As there is the image of the emperor on money, so must \nthe image of God be on our thoughts. We must verify the quality of \nthe thought: This effigy of God, is it real? What is its degree of purity? \nIs it mixed with desire or concupiscence? Thus, we find the same image \nas in Seneca, but with a different meaning. \nSince we have as our role to be a permanent moneychanger of our­\nselves, how is it possible to make this discrimination and recognize if \na thought is of good quality? How can this \"discrimination\" actively be \ndone? There is only one way: to tell all thoughts to our director, to be \nobedient to our master in all things, to engage in the permanent verba­\nlization of all our thoughts. In Cassian, self-examination is subordinated \nto obedience and the permanent verbalization of thoughts. Neither is \ntrue of Stoicism. By telling himself not only his thoughts but also the \nsmallest movements of consciousness, his intentions, the monk stands \nin a hermeneutic relation not only to the master but to himself. This \nverbalization is the touchstone or the money of thought. \nWhy is confession able to assume this hermeneutic role? How can \nwe be the hermeneuts of ourselves in speaking and transcribing all of \nour thoughts? Confession permits the master to know because of his \ngreater experience and wisdom and therefore to give better advice. \nEven if the master, in his role as a discriminating power, does not say \nanything, the fact that the thought has been expressed will have an \neffect of discrimination. \nCassian gives an example of the monk who stole bread. At first he \ncannot tell. The difference between good and evil thoughts is that evil \nthoughts cannot be expressed without difficulty, for evil is hidden and \nunstated. Because evil thoughts cannot be expressed without difficulty \nand shame, the cosmological difference between light and dark, be­\ntween verbalization and sin, secrecy and silence, between God and the \nDevil, may not emerge. Then the monk prostrates himself and con­\nfesses. Only when he confesses verbally does the Devil go out of him. \nThe verbal expression is the crucial moment. 35 Confession is a mark \nof truth. This idea of the permanent verbal is only an ideal: it is never \ncompletely possible. But the price of the permanent verbal was to make \neverything that could not be expressed into a sin. \nIn conclusion, in the Christianity of the first centuries, there are two"

The \nfirst is exomologesis, or a dramatic expression of the situation of the \npenitent as sinner which makes manifest his status as sinner. The sec­\nond is what was called in the spiritual literature exagoreusis. This is \nan analytical and continual verbalization of thoughts carried on in the \nrelation of complete obedience to someone else; this relation is mod­\neled on the renunciation of one's own will and of one's own self. \nThere is a great difference between exomologesis and exagoreusis; \nyet we have to underscore the fact that there is one important element \nin common: you cannot disclose without renouncing. In exomologesis, \nthe sinner must \"kill\" himself through ascetic macerations. Whether \nthrough martyrdom or through obedience to a master, disclosure of self \nis the renunciation of one's own self. In exagoreusis, on the other hand, \nyou show that, in permanently verbalizing your thoughts and perma­\nnently obeying the master, you are renouncing your will and yourself. \nThis practice continues from the beginning of Christianity to the sev­\nenteenth century. The inauguration of penance in the thirteenth cen­\ntury is an important step in its rise. \nThis theme of self-renunciation is very important. Throughout Chris­\ntianity there is a correlation between disclosure of the self, dramatic or \nverbalized, and the renunciation of self. My hypothesis, from looking at \nthese two techniques, is that it is the second one, verbalization, that be­\ncomes the more important. From the eighteenth century to the present, \nthe techniques of verbalization have been reinserted in a different con­\ntext by the so-called human sciences in order to use them without renun­\nciation of the self but to constitute, positively, a new self. To use these \ntechniques without renouncing oneself constitutes a decisive break. \nNOTES \n1 Plato, Alcibiade, trans. M. Croiset (Paris: Belles Lettres, 1925) [Plato, Alcibiades, trans. W R.

I must confess that I am much more interested in problems \nabout techniques of the self and things like that than sex ... sex is boring. \nQ. It sounds like the Greeks were not too interested either. \nM.F. No, they were not much interested in sex. It was not a great \nissue. Compare, for instance, what they say about the place of food and \ndiet. I think it is very, very interesting to see the move, the very slow \nmove, from the privileging of food, which was overwhelming in Greece, \nto interest in sex. Food was still much more important during the early \nChristian days than sex. For instance, in the rules for monks, the prob­\nlem was food, food, food. Then you can see a very slow shift during \nthe Middle Ages, when they were in a kind of equilibrium ... and after \nthe seventeenth century it was sex. \nQ. Yet Volume Two of The History 0/ Sexuality, L'Usage des plaisirs \n[The Uses 0/ Pleasure]' is concerned almost exclusively with, not to put \ntoo fine a point on it, sex. \n*The following is the result of a series of working sessions with Michel Foucault con­\nducted by Paul Rabinow and Hubert Dreyfus at Berkeley in April 1983. Although we \nhave retained the interview form, the material was jointly reedited.

One of the numerous reasons I had so much trouble with \nthat book was that I first wrote a book about sex, which I put aside. \nThen I wrote a book about the self and the techniques of the self; sex \ndisappeared, and for the third time I was obliged to rewrite a book in \nwhich I tried to keep the equilibrium between one and the other. \nYou see, what I wanted to do in Volume Two of The History if Sex­\nuality was to show that you have nearly the same restrictive, the same \nprohibitive code in the fourth century B.C. and in the moralists and doc­\ntors at the beginning of the empire. But I think that the way they inte­\ngrate those prohibitions in relation to oneself is completely different. \nI don't think one can find any normalization in, for instance, the Stoic \nethics. The reason is, I think, that the principal aim, the principal tar­\nget of this kind of ethics, was an aesthetic one. First, this kind of eth­\nics was only a problem of personal choice. Second, it was reserved for \na few people in the population; it was not a question of giving a pat­\ntern of behavior for everybody. It was a personal choice for a small elite. \nThe reason for making this choice was the will to live a beautiful life, \nand to leave to others memories of a beautiful existence. I don't think \nthat we can say that this kind of ethics was an attempt to normalize \nthe population. \nThe continuity of the themes of this ethics is something very strik­\ning, but I think that behind, below this continuity, there were some \nchanges, which I have tried to acknowledge. \nQ. So the equilibrium in your work has shifted from sex to tech­\nniques of the self? \nM.F. I wondered what the technology of the self before Christianity \nwas, or where the Christian technology of the self came from, and what \nkind of sexual ethics was characteristic of the ancient culture. And then \nI was obliged after I finished Les Aveux de la chair [\"Confessions of \nthe Flesh,\" as yet unpublished], the book about Christianity, to reex­\namine what I said in the introduction to L'Usage des plaisirs about the \nsupposed pagan ethics, because what I had said about pagan ethics \nwere only cliches borrowed from secondary texts. And then I discov­\nered, first, that this pagan ethics was not at all liberal, tolerant, and so \non, as it was supposed to be; second, that most of the themes of Chris­\ntian austerity were very clearly present nearly from the beginning, but \nthat also in pagan culture the main problem was not the rules for aus­\n.terity but much more the techniques of the self. \nReading Seneca, Plutarch, and all those people, I discovered that"

What is the title? \nM.F. Le Souci de soi [The Care of the Selfl So in the series about \nsexuality: the first one is L'Vsage des plaisirs, and in this book there \nis a chapter about the technology of the self, since I think it's not pos­\nsible to understand clearly what Greek sexual ethics was without relat­\ning it to this technology of the self. Then, a second volume in the same \nsex series, Les Aveux de la chair, deals with Christian technologies of \nthe self. And then, Le Souci de soi, a book separate from the sex series, \nis composed of different papers about the self-for instance, a commen­\ntary on Plato's Alcibiades in which you find the first elaboration of the \nnotion of epimeleia heautou, \"care of the self,\" about the role of read­\ning and writing in constituting the self, maybe the problem of the med­\nical experience of the self, and so on .... \nQ.

For instance, what \nhappens to us after death? What are the gods? Do they intervene or \nnot?-these are very, very unimportant problems for them, and they are \nnot directly related to ethics, to conduct. The second thing is that eth­\nics was not related to any social-or at least to any legal-institutional \nsystem. For instance, the laws against sexual misbehavior were very few \nand not very compelling. The third thing is that what they were wor­\nried about, their theme was to constitute a kind of ethics which was \nan aesthetics of existence. \nWell, I wonder if our problem nowadays is not, in a way, similar to \nthis one, since most of us no longer believe that ethics is founded in \nreligion, nor do we want a legal system to intervene in our moral, per­\nsonal, private life.

I am struck \nby this similarity of problems. \nQ. Do you think that the Greeks offer an attractive and plausible \nalternative? \nM.F. No! I am not looking for an alternative; you can't find the solu­\ntion of a problem in the solution of another problem raised at another \nmoment by other people. You see, what I want to do is not the history \nof solutions-and that's the reason why I don't accept the word alter­\nnative.

If everything is dangerous, \nthen we always have something to do. So my position leads not to apa­\nthy but to a hyper-and pessimistic activism. \nI think that the ethico-political choice we have to make every day is \nto determine which is the main danger. Take as an example Robert \nCastel's analysis of the history of the antipsychiatry movement [La \nGestion des risques]. I agree completely with what Castel says, but \nthat does not mean, as some people suppose, that the mental hospi­\ntals were better than antipsychiatry; that does not mean that we were \nnot right to criticize those mental hospitals. I think it was good to do \nthat, because they were the danger. And now it's quite clear that the \ndanger has changed. For instance, in Italy they have closed all the men­\ntal hospitals, and there are more free clinics, and so on-and they have \nnew problems. \nQ. Isn't it logical, given these concerns, that you should be writing \na genealogy ofbio-power? \nM.F. I have no time for that now, but it could be done. In fact, I have \nto do it. \nWHY THE ANCIENT WORLD WAS NOT A GOLDEN \nAGE, BUT WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM IT ANYWAY \nQ.

So the women were d,ominated, but surely homosexual love was \nbetter than now? \nM.F. It might look that way. Since there is an important and large \nliterature about loving boys in Greek culture, some historians say, \"Well, \nthat's the proof that they loved boys.\" But I say that proves that loving \nboys was a problem. Because if there were no problem, they would \nspeak of this kind of love in the same terms as love between men and \nwomen. The problem was that they couldn't accept that a young boy \nwho was supposed to become a free citizen could be dominated and \nused as an object for someone's pleasure. A woman, a slave, could be \npassive: such was their nature, their status. All this reflection, philos­\nophizing about the love of boys-with always the same conclusion: \nplease, don't treat a boy as a woman-is proof that they could not inte­\ngrate this real practice in the framework of their social selves. \nYou can see through a reading of Plutarch how they couldn't even \nimagine reciprocity of pleasure between a boy and a man. If Plutarch \nfinds problems in loving boys, it is not at all in the sense that loving \nboys was antinatural or something like that. He says, \"It's not possible \nthat there could be any reciprocity in the physical relations between a \nboy and a man.\" \nQ. There seems to be an aspect of Greek culture that we are told \nabout in Aristotle, that you don't talk about, but that seems very im­\nportant-friendship. In classical literature, friendship is the locus of \nmutual recognition. It's not traditionally seen as the highest virtue, but \nboth in Aristotle and in Cicero, you could read it as really being the \nhighest virtue because it's selfless and enduring, it's not easily bought, \nit doesn't deny the utility and pleasure of the world, but yet it seeks \nsomething more. \nM.F. But don't forget L'Usage des plaisirs is a book about sexual eth­\nics; it's not a book about love, or about friendship, or about reciproc­\nity. And it's very significant that when Plato tries to integrate love for \nboys and friendship, he is obliged to put aside sexual relations. Friend­\nship is reciprocal, and sexual relations are not reciprocal: in sexual rela­\ntions, you can penetrate or you are penetrated. I agree completely with \nwhat you say about friendship, but I think it confirms what I say about \nGreek sexual ethics: if you have friendship, it is difficult to have sex­\nual relations.

You \nfind in Xenophon, in the Banquet, Socrates saying that between a man \nand a boy it is obvious that the boy is only the spectator of the man's \npleasure. What they say about this beautiful love of boys implies that \nthe pleasure of the boy was not to be taken into account; moreover, that \nit was dishonorable for the boy to feel any kind of physical pleasure in \na relation with a man. \nWhat I want to ask is: Are we able to have an ethics of acts and their \npleasures which would be able to take into account the pleasure of the \nother? Is the pleasure of the other something that can be integrated in \nour pleasure, without reference either to law, to marriage, to I don't \nknow what? \nQ. It looks like nonreciprocity was a problem for the Greeks all right, \nbut it seems to be the kind of problem that one could straighten out. \nWhy does sex have to be virile? Why couldn't women's pleasure and \nboys' pleasure be taken account of without any big change to the gen­\neral framework? Or is it that it's not just a little problem, because if \nyou try to bring in the pleasure of the other, the whole hierarchical, \nethical system would break down? \nM.F. That's right. The Greek ethics of pleasure is linked to a virile \nsociety, to dissymmetry, exclusion of the other, an obsession with pen­\netration, and a kind of threat of being dispossessed of your own energy, \nand so on. All that is quite disgusting! \nQ. OK, granted that sexual relations were both nonreciprocal and a \ncause of worry for the Greeks, at least pleasure itself seems unprob­\nlematic for them. \nM.F. Well, in L'Usage des plaisirs I try to show, for instance, that \nthere is a growing tension between pleasure and health. When you take \nthe physicians and all the concern with diet, you see first that the main \nthemes are very similar during several centuries. But the idea that sex \nhas its dangers is much stronger in the second century A.D. than in \nthe fourth century B.C. I think that you can show that, for Hippocrates, \nthe sexual act was already dangerous, so you had to be very careful with \nit and not have sex all the time, only in certain seasons and so on. But \nin the first and second centuries it seems that, for a physician, the sex­\nual act is much closer to pathos. And I think the main shift is this one: \nthat in the fourth century B.C., the sexual act was an activity, and for"

You have a very interesting analysis by \nAugustine which is, I think, quite typical concerning the problem of \nerection. The erection was, for the Greek of the fourth century, the sign \nof activity, the main activity. But since, for Augustine and the Chris­\ntians, the erection is not something voluntary, it is a sign of a passiv­\nity-it is a punishment for the first sin. \nQ. So the Greeks were more concerned with health than with \npleasure? \nM.F. Yes, about what the Greeks had to eat in order to be in good \nhealth, we have thousands of pages. And there are comparatively few \nthings about what to do when you have sex with someone. Concerning \nfood, it was the relation between the climate, the seasons, the humid­\nity or dryness of the air and the dryness of the food, and so on. There \nare very few things about the way they had to cook it; much more about \nthese qualities. It's not a cooking art; it's a matter of choosing. \nQ. So, despite the German Hellenists, classical Greece was not a \ngolden age. Yet surely we can learn something from it? \nM.F. I think there is no exemplary value in a period that is not our \nperiod ... it is not anything to get back to. But we do have an example of \nan ethical experience which implied a very strong connection between \npleasure and desire. If we compare that to our experience now, where \neverybody-the philosopher or the psychoanalyst-explains that what \nis important is desire, and pleasure is nothing at all, we can wonder \nwhether this disconnection wasn't a historical event, one that was not \nat all necessary, not linked to human nature, or to any anthropologi­\ncal necessity. \nQ. But you already illustrated that in The History of Sexuality by \ncontrasting our science of sexuality with the oriental ars erotica. \nM.F. One of the numerous points where I was wrong in that book \nwas what I said about this ars erotica. I should have opposed our sci­\nence of sex to a contrasting practice in our own culture. The Greeks \nand Romans did not have any ars erotica to be compared with the \nChinese ars erotica (or at least it was not something very important in \ntheir culture). They had a tekhne\"tou biou in which the economy of \npleasure played a very large role. In this \"art of life,\" the notion of exer­\ncising a perfect mastery over oneself soon became the main issue.

What I want to show is that the general Greek problem was \nnot the tekhne of the self, it was the tekhne of life, the tekhne tou biou, \nhow to live. It's quite clear from Socrates to Seneca or Pliny, for instance, \nthat they didn't worry about the afterlife, what happened after death, \nor whether God exists or not. That was not really a great problem for \nthem; the problem was: Which tekhnedo I have to use in order to live \nwell as I ought to live? And I think that one of the main evolutions in \nancient culture has been that this tekhne tou biou became more and \nmore a tekhne of the self. A Greek citizen of the fifth or fourth century \nwould have felt that his tekhne for life was to take care of the city, of \nhis companions. But for Seneca, for instance, the problem is to take \ncare of himself. \nWith Plato's Alcibiades, it's very clear: you have to take care of your­\nself because you have to rule the city. But taking care of yourself for \nits own sake starts with the Epicureans-it becomes something very \ngeneral with Seneca, Pliny, and so on: everybody has to take care of \nhimself. Greek ethics is centered on a problem of personal choice, of \nthe aesthetics of existence. \nThe idea of the bios as a material for an aesthetic piece of art is \nsomething that fascinates me. The idea also that ethics can be a very \nstrong structure of existence, without any relation with the juridical per \nse, with an authoritarian system, with a disciplinary structure. All that \nis very interesting. \nQ. How, then, did the Greeks deal with deviance? \nM.F. The great difference in sexual ethics for the Greeks was not \nbetween people who prefer women or boys or have sex in this way or \nanother, but was a question of quantity and of activity and passivity. \nAre you a slave of your own desires or their master? \nQ. What about someone who had sex so much he damaged his health? \nM.F. That's hubris, that's excess. The problem is not one of deviancy \nbut of excess or moderation. \nQ. What did they do with these people? \nM.F. They were considered ugly; they had a bad reputation. \nQ. They didn't try to cure or reform such people? \nM.F. There were exercises in order to make one master of oneself. \nFor Epictetus, you had to be able to look at a beautiful girl or a beauti­\nful boy without having any desire for her or him.

Gide in Greece would have been an aus­\ntere philosopher. \nQ. In the name of a beautiful life they were austere, and now in the \nname of psychological science we seek self-fulfillment. \nM.F. Exactly. My idea is that it's not at all necessary to relate ethical \nproblems to scientific knowledge. Among the cultural inventions of \nmankind there is a treasury of devices, techniques, ideas, procedures, \nand so on, that cannot exactly be reactivated but at least constitute, or \nhelp to constitute, a certain point of view which can be very useful as \na tool for analyzing what's going on now-and to change it. \nWe don't have to choose between our world and the Greek world. \nBut since we can see very well that some of the main principles of our \nethics have been related at a certain moment to an aesthetics of exis­\ntence, I think that this kind of historical analysis can be useful.

But if one is to create oneself without recourse to knowledge or \nuniversal rules, how does your view differ from Sartrean existentialism? \nM.F. I think that from the theoretical point of view, Sartre avoids the \nidea of the self as something that is given to us, but through the moral \nnotion of authenticity, he turns back to the idea that we have to be \nourselves-to be truly our true self. I think that the only acceptable \npractical consequence of what Sartre has said is to link his theoretical \ninsight to the practice of creativity-and not that of authenticity. From \nthe idea that the self is not given to us, I think that there is only one \npractical consequence: we have to create ourselves as a work of art. In \nhis analyses of Baudelaire, Flaubert, and so on, it is interesting to see \nthat Sartre refers the work of creation to a certain relation to oneself­\nthe author to himself-which has the form of authenticity or inauthen­\nticity. I would like to say exactly the contrary: we should not have to \nrefer the creative activity of somebody to the kind of relation he has to \nhimself, but should relate the kind of relation one has to oneself to a \ncreative activity. \nQ.

Three domains of genealogy are possible. First, a historical \nontology of ourselves in relation to truth through which we constitute \nourselves as subjects of knowledge; second, a historical ontology of \nourselves in relation to a field of power through which we constitute \nourselves as subjects acting on others; third, a historical ontology in \nrelation to ethics through which we constitute ourselves as moral agents. \nSo, three axes are possible for genealogy.

The power axis was studied in Discipline and Punish, and the \nethical axis in The History of Sexuality. \nThe general framework of the book about sex is a history of morals. \nI think, in general, we have 10 distinguish, where the history of mor­\nals is concerned, acts and moral code. The acts [conduites] are the real \nbehavior of people in relation to the moral code [prescriptions] im­\nposed on them. I think we have to distinguish between the code that \ndetermines which acts are permitted or forbidden and the code that \ndetermines the positive or negative value of the different possible \nbehaviors-you're not allowed to have sex with anyone but your wife, \nthat's an element of the code. And there is another side to the moral \nprescriptions, which most of the time is not isolated as such but is, I \nthink, very important: the kind of relationship you ought to have with \nyourself, rapport a soi, which I call ethics, and which determines how \nthe individual is supposed to constitute himself as a moral subject of \nhis own actions. \nThis relationship to oneself has four major aspects. The first aspect \nanswers the question: Which is the aspect or the part of myself or my \nbehavior which is concerned with moral conduct? For instance, you can \nsay, in general, that in our society the main field of morality, the part \nof ourselves which is most relevant for morality, is our feelings. (You \ncan have a girl in the street or anywhere, if you have very good feel­\nings toward your wife.) Well, it's quite clear that from the Kantian \npoint of view, intention is much more important than feelings. And \nfrom the Christian point of view, it is desire-well, we could discuss \nthat, because in the Middle Ages it was not the same as the seven­\nteenth century .... \nQ. But, roughly, for the Christians it was desire, for Kant it was \nintentions, and for us now it's feelings? \nM.F. Well, you can say something like that. It's not always the same \npart of ourselves, or of our behavior, which is relevant for ethical judg­\nment. That's the aspect I call the ethical substance [substance ethique]. \nQ. The ethical substance is like the material that's going to be worked \nover by ethics? \nM.F. Yes, that's it. And, for instance, when I describe the aphrodisia \nin L'Usage des plaisirs, it is to show that the part of sexual behavior \nwhich is relevant in Greek ethics is something different from concu­\npiscence, from flesh. For the Greeks, the ethical substance was acts \nlinked to pleasure and desire in their unity. And it is very different from"

I cannot answer because all that can only be analyzed through \na precise inquiry. Before I studied Greek or Greco-Roman ethics, I \ncouldn't answer the question: What exactly is the ethical substance of \nGreco-Roman ethics? Now I think that I know, through the analysis of \nwhat they mean by aphrodisia, what the Greek ethical substance was. \nFor the Greeks, when a philosopher was in love with a boy, but did \nnot touch him, his behavior was valued. The problem was: Does he \ntouch the boy or not? That's the ethical substance: the act linked with \npleasure and desire. For Augustine, it's very clear that when he remem­\nbers his relationship to his young friend when he was eighteen years \nold, what bothers him is what exactly was the kind of desire he had \nfor him. So you see that the ethical substance has changed. \nThe second aspect is what I call the mode of subjectivation [mode \nd'assujettissement], that is, the way in which people are invited or \nincited to recognize their moral obligations. Is it, for instance, divine \nlaw that has been revealed in a text? Is it natural law, a cosmological \norder, in each case the same for every living being? Is it a rational rule? \nIs it the attempt to give your existence the most beautiful form possible? \nQ. When you say \"rational,\" do you mean scientific? \nM.F. No, Kantian, universal. You can see, for instance, in the Stoics, \nhow they move slowly from an idea of an aesthetics of existence to the \nidea that we must do such and such things because we are rational \nbeings-as members of the human community, we must do them. For \nexample, you find in Isocrates a very interesting discourse, which is \nsupposed to be held with Nicocles, who was the ruler of Cyprus. There \nhe explains why he has always been faithful to his wife: \"Because I am \nthe king, and because as somebody who commands others, who rules \nothers, I have to show that I am able to rule myself.\" And you can see \nthat this rule of faithfulness has nothing to do with the universal and \nStoic formulation: \"I have to be faithful to my wife because I am a \nhuman and rational being.\" In the former case, it is because I am \nthe king! And you can see that the way the same rule is accepted by \nNicocles and by a Stoic is quite different. And that's what I call the \nmode d'assujettissement, the second aspect of ethics. \nQ.

That's the mode d'assujettissement, the \nsecond aspect of ethics. \nThe third one is: What are the means by which we can change our­\nselves in order to become ethical subjects? \nQ. How we work on this ethical substance? \nM.F. Yes. What are we to do, either to moderate our acts, or to deci­\npher what we are, or to eradicate our desires, or to use our sexual \ndesire in order to obtain certain aims such as having children, and so \non-all this elaboration of ourselves in order to behave ethically? In \norder to be faithful to your wife, you can do different things to the self. \nThat's the third aspect, which I call the self-forming activity [pratique \nde sal] or l'ascetisme-asceticism in a very broad sense. \nThe fourth aspect is: Which is the kind of being to which we aspire \nwhen we behave in a moral way? For instance, shall we become pure, \nor immortal, or free, or masters of ourselves, and so on? So that's what \nI call the telos [tileologie].

Which are all independent? \nM.F. There are both relationships between them and a certain kind \nof independence. For instance, you can very well understand why, if \nthe goal is an absolute purity of being, then the type of techniques of \nself-forming activity, the techniques of asceticism you are to use, are \nnot exactly the same as when you try to be master of your own behav­\nior.

First, if we take the code-what is forbid­\nden and what is not-you see that, at least in the philosophical code \nof behavior, you find three main prohibitions or prescriptions. One \nabout the body-that is, you have to be very careful with your sexual \nbehavior since it is very costly, so do it as infrequently as possible. The \nsecond is: When you are married, please don't have sex with anybody \nelse but your wife. And with boys-please don't touch boys.

Some of those interdictions changed; some of the prohibitions are \nmuch stricter and much more rigorous in Christianity than in the Greek \nperiod. But the themes are the same. So I think that the great changes \nthat occurred between Greek society, Greek ethics, Greek morality, and \nhow the Christians viewed themselves are not in the code but in what \nI call the \"ethics,\" which is the relation to oneself. In L'Usage des plai­\nsirs, I analyze those four aspects of the relation to oneself, through the \nthree austerity themes of the code: health, wives or women, and boys. \nQ. Would it be fair to say that you're not doing the genealogy of mor­\nals because you think the moral codes are relatively stable, but that \nwhat you're doing is a genealogy of ethics? \nM.F. Yes, I'm writing a genealogy of ethics. The genealogy of the \nsubject as a subject of ethical actions, or the genealogy of desire as an \nethical problem. So, if we take ethics in classical Greek philosophy or \nmedicine, what is the ethical substance? It is the aphrodisia, which are \nat the same time acts, desire, and pleasure. What is the mode d'assujet­\ntissement? It is that we have to build our existence as a beautiful exis­\ntence; it is an aesthetic mode. You see, what I tried to show is that \nnobody is obliged in classical ethics to behave in such a way as to be \ntruthful to their wives, to not touch boys, and so on. But if they want to \nhave a beautiful existence, if they want to have a good reputation, if they \nwant to be able to rule others, they have to do this. So they accept those \nobligations in a conscious way for the beauty or glory of existence. The \nchoice, the aesthetic choice or the political choice, for which they decide \nto accept this kind of existence-that's the mode d'assujettissement. It's \na choice, it's a personal choice. \nIn late Stoicism, when they start saying, \"Well, you are obliged to \ndo that because you are a human being,\" something changes. It's not \na problem of choice; you have to do it because you are a rational being. \nThe mode d'assujettissement is changing. \nIn Christianity, what is very interesting is that the sexual rules for \nbehavior were, of course, justified through religion. The institutions \nby which they were imposed were religious institutions. But the form \nof the obligation was a legal form. There was a kind of the internal \njuridification of religious law inside Christianity. For instance, all the \ncasuistic practice was typically a juridical practice. \nQ. After the Enlightenment, though, when the religious drops out, \nis the juridical what's left?"

Yes, after the eighteenth century, the religious framework of \nthose rules disappears in part, and then between a medical or scien­\ntific approach and a juridical framework there was competition, with \nno resolution. \nQ. Could you sum this up? \nM.F. Well, the substance ethique for the Greeks was the aphrodisia; \nthe mode d'assujettissement was a politico-aesthetic choice; the form \nd'asd:se was the tekhne that was used-and there we find, for ex­\nample, the tekhne about the body, or economics as the rules by which \nyou define your role as husband, or the erotic as a kind of asceticism \ntoward oneself in loving boys, and so on-and the te!eologie was the \nmastery of oneself. So that's the situation I describe in the two first \nparts of L'Usage des plaisirs. \nThen there is a shift within this ethics. The reason for the shift is the \nchange of the role of men within society, both in their homes toward \ntheir wives and also in the political field, since the city disappears. So, \nfor those reasons, the way they can recognize themselves as subjects of \npolitical, economic behavior changes. We can say roughly that along with \nthese sociological changes something is changing also in classical eth­\nics-that is, in the elaboration of the relationship to oneself. But I think \nthat the change doesn't affect the ethical substance: it is still aphrodisia. \nThere are some changes in the mode d'assujettissement, for instance, \nwhen the Stoics recognize themselves as universal beings. And there are \nalso very important changes in the asceticism, the kind of techniques \nyou use in order to recognize, to constitute yourself as a subject of eth­\nics. And also a change in the goal. I think that the difference is that in \nthe classical perspective, to be master of oneself meant, first, taking into \naccount only oneself and not the other, because to be master of oneself \nmeant that you were able to rule others. So the mastery of oneself was \ndirectly related to a dissymmetrical relation to others. You should be \nmaster of yourself in a sense of activity, dissymmetry, and nonreciprocity. \nLater on, due to the changes in marriage, society, and so on, mas­\ntery of oneself is something that is not primarily related to power over \nothers: you have to be master of yourself not only in order to rule oth­\ners, as it was in the case of Alcibiades or Nicocles, but you have to be \nmaster of yourself because you are a rational being. And in this mas­\ntery of yourself, you are related to other people, who are also masters \nof themselves. And this new kind of relation to the other is much less \nnonreciprocal than before."

      "text": "Ethics: Subjectivity and Truth \nSo those are the changes, and I try to show those changes in the \nthree last chapters, the fourth part of L'Usage des plaisirs. I take the \nsame themes-the body, wives or women, and boys-and I show that \nthese same three austerity themes are linked to a partially new ethics. \nI say \"partially\" because some of the parts ofthis ethics do not change: \nfor instance, the aphrodisia. On the other hand, others do: for instance, \nthe techniques. According to Xenophon, the way to become a good hus­\nband is to know exactly what your role is inside your home or outside, \nwhat kind of authority you have to exercise on your wife, what are your \nexpectations of your wife's behavior, and so on. All this calculation gives \nyou the rules for behavior, and defines the way you have to be toward \nyourself. But for Epictetus, or for Seneca, for instance, in order to be \nreally master of yourself, you don't have to know what your role in \nsociety or in your home is, but you do have to do some exercises like \ndepriving yourself of eating for two or three days, in order to be sure \nthat you can control yourself. If one day you are in prison, you won't \nsuffer from being deprived of food, and so on. And you have to do that \nfor all the pleasures-that's a kind of asceticism you can't find in Plato \nor Socrates or Aristotle. \nThere is no complete and identical relation between the techniques \nand the tele. You can find the same techniques in different tele, but \nthere are privileged relations, some privileged techniques related to \neach telos. \nIn the Christian book-I mean the book about Christianity!-I try \nto show that all this ethics has changed. Because the telos has changed: \nthe telos is immortality, purity, and so on. The asceticism has changed, \nbecause now self-examination takes the form of self-deciphering. The \nmode d'assujettissement is now divine law. And I think that even the \nethical substance has changed, because it is not aphrodisia, but desire, \nconcupiscence, flesh, and so on. \nQ. It seems, then, that we have a grid of intelligibility for desire as \nan ethical problem? \nM.F. Yes, we now have this scheme. If, by sexual behavior, we under­\nstand the three poles-acts, pleasure, and desire-we have the Greek \n\"formula,\" which ·is the same at the first and at the second stage. In \nthis Greek formula what is underscored is \"acts,\" with pleasure and \ndesire as subsidiary: acte-plaisir-[desir]. I have put desire in brack­\nets because I think that in the Stoic ethics you start a kind of elision of \ndesire; desire begins to be condemned."

Acts have to become something neutral; you have to act only \nto produce children or to fulfill your conjugal duty. And pleasure is both \npractically and theoretically excluded: [desir}-acte-[plaisir]. Desire \nis practically excluded-you have to eradicate your desire-but theo­\nretically very important. \nAnd I could say that the modern \"formula\" is desire, which is theo­\nretically underlined and practically accepted, since you have to liber­\nate your own desire.

What is the care of the self which you have decided to treat sepa­\nrately in Le Soud de soi? \nM.F. What interests me in the Hellenistic culture, in the Greco­\nRoman culture, starting from about the third century B.C. and continu­\ning until the second or third century after Christ, is a precept for which \nthe Greeks had a specific word, epimeleia heautou, which means tak­\ning care of one's self. It does not mean simply being interested in one­\nself, nor does it mean having a certain tendency to self-attachment or \nself-fascination. Epimeleia heautou is a very powerful word in Greek \nwhich means \"working on\" or \"being concerned with\" something. For \nexample, Xenophon used epimeleia heautou to describe agricultural \nmanagement. The responsibility of a monarch for his fellow citizens \nwas also epimeleia heautou. That which a doctor does in the course of \ncaring for a patient is epimeleia heautou. It is therefore a very power­\nful word; it describes a sort of work, an activity; it implies attention, \nknowledge, technique. \nQ. But isn't the application of knowledge and technology to the self \na modern invention? \nM.F.

So theoretical understanding, scientific understanding, was sec­\nondary to, and guided by, ethical and aesthetic concerns? \nM.F. Their problem and their discussion concerned what limited \nsorts of knowledge were useful for epimeleia. For instance, for the Epi­\ncureans, the general knowledge of what is the world, of what is the \nnecessity of the world, the relation between world, necessity, and the \ngods-all that was very important for the care of the self. Because it \nwas first a matter of meditation: if you were able exactly to understand \nthe necessity of the world, then you could master passions in a much \nbetter way, and so on. So, for the Epicureans, there was a kind of ade­\nquation between all possible knowledge and the care of the self. The \nreason that one had to become familiar with physics or cosmology was \nthat one had to take care of the self. For the Stoics, the true self is \ndefined only by what I can be master of. \nQ. So knowledge is subordinat~d to the practical end of mastery? \nM.F. Epictetus is very clear on that. He gives as an exercise to walk \nevery morning in the streets looking, watching. And if you meet a con­\nsular figure you say, \"Is the consul something I can master?\" No, so I \nhave nothing to do. If I meet a beautiful girl or beautiful boy, is their \nbeauty, their desirability, something that depends on me, and so on? \nFor the Christians, things are quite different; for Christians, the possi­\nbility that Satan can get inside your soul and give you thoughts you can­\nnot recognize as satanic, but might interpret as coming from God, leads \nto uncertainty about what is going on inside your soul. You are unable \nto know what the real root of your desire is, at least without herme­\nneutic work. \nQ. So, to what extent did the Christians develop new techniques of \nself-mastery? \nM.F. What interests me about the classical concept of care of the self \nis that we see here the birth and development of a certain number of \nascetic themes ordinarily attributed to Christianity. Christianity is \nusually given credit for replacing the generally tolerant Greco-Roman \nlifestyle with an austere lifestyle marked by a series of renunciations, \ninterdictions, or prohibitions.

In the name of what does one choose to impose this lifestyle \nupon oneself? \nM.F. In antiquity, this work on the self with its attendant austerity \nis not imposed on the individual by means of civil law or religious obli­\ngation, but is a choice about existence made by the individual. People \ndecide for themselves whether or not to care for themselves. \nI don't think it is to attain eternal life after death, because they were \nnot particularly concerned with that. Rather, they acted so as to give \nto their life certain values (reproduce certain examples, leave behind \nthem an exalted reputation, give the maximum possible brilliance to \ntheir lives). It was a question of making one's life into an object for a \nsort of knowledge, for a tekhne-for an art. \nWe have hardly any remnant of the idea in our society that the prin­\ncipal work of art which one must take care of, the main area to which \none must apply aesthetic values, is oneself, one's life, one's existence. \nWe find this in the Renaissance, but in a slightly academic form, and yet \nagain in nineteenth-century dandyism, but those were only episodes. \nQ. But isn't the Greek concern with the self just an early version of \nour self-absorption, which many consider a central problem in our \nsociety? \nM.F. You have a certain number of themes-and I don't say that you \nhave to reutilize them in this way-which indicate to you that in a cul­\nture to which we owe a certain number of our most important constant \nmoral elements, there was a practice of the self, a conception of the \nself, very different from our present culture of the self. In the Cali­\nfornian cult of the self, one is supposed to discover one's true self, to \nseparate it from that which might obscure or alienate it, to decipher \nits truth thanks to psychological or psychoanalytic science, which is sup­\nposed to be able to tell you what your true self is. Therefore, not only \ndo I not identiry this ancient culture of the self with what you might call \nthe Californian cult of the self, I think they are diametrically opposed. \nWhat happened in between is precisely an overtuning of the classi­\ncal culture of the self. This took place when Christianity substituted \nthe idea of a self that one had to renounce, because clinging to the self \nwas opposed to God's will, for the idea of a self that had to be created \nas a work of art. \nQ.

First, to bring out a certain number of historical facts that are \noften glossed over when posing this problem of writing, we must look \ninto the famous question of the hupomnemata. Current interpreters see \nin the critique of the hupomnemata in the Phaedrus a critique of writ­\ning as a material support for memory. Now, in fact, hupomnemata has \na very precise meaning: it is a copybook, a notebook. Precisely this type \nof notebook was coming into vogue in Plato's time for personal and \nadministrative use. This new technology was as disrupting as the intro­\nduction of the computer into private life today. It seems to me the ques­\ntion of writing and the self must be posed in terms of the technical and \nmaterial framework in which it arose. \nSecond, there are problems of interpretation concerning the famous \ncritique of writing as opposed to the culture of memory in the Phaedrus. \nIf you read the Phaedrus, you will see that this passage is secondary \nwith respect to another one, which is fundamental and in line with the \ntheme that runs throughout the end of the text. It does not matter \nwhether a text is written or oral-the problem is whether or not the \ndiscourse in question gives access to truth. Thus, the written/oral ques­\ntion is altogether secondary with respect to the question of truth. \nThird, what seems remarkable to me is that these new instruments \nwere immediately used for the constitution of a permanent relation­\nship to oneself-one must manage oneself as a governor manages the \ngoverned, as a head of an enterprise manages his enterprise, a head \nof household manages his household. This new idea that virtue con­\nsists essentially in perfectly governing oneself, that is, in exercising \nupon oneself as exact a mastery as that of a sovereign against whom \nthere would no longer be revolts, is something very important that we \nwill find, for centuries-practically until Christianity. So, if you will, \nthe point at which the question of the hupomnemata and the culture \nof the self come together in a remarkable fashion is the point at which \nthe culture of the self takes as its goal the perfect government of the \nself-a sort of permanent political relationship between self and self. \nThe ancients carried on this politics of themselves with these notebooks \njust as governments and those who manage enterprises administered \nby keeping registers. This is how writing seems to me to be linked to \nthe problem of the culture of the self. \nQ. Can you tell us more about the hupomnemata?"

In the technical sense, the hupomnemata could be account \nbooks, public registers, individual notebooks serving as memoranda. \nTheir use as books of life, guides for conduct, seems to have become a \ncurrent thing among a whole cultivated public. Into them one entered \nquotations, fragments of works, examples, and actions to which one \nhad been witness or of which one had read the account, reflections or \nreasonings one had heard or had come to mind. They constituted a \nmaterial memory of things read, heard, or thought, thus offering these \nas an accumulated treasure for rereading and later meditation. They \nalso formed a raw material for the writing of more systematic treatises \nin which were given arguments and means by which to struggle against \nsome defect (such as anger, envy, gossip, flattery) or to overcome some \ndifficult circumstance (a mourning, an exile, downfall, disgrace). \nQ. But how does writing connect up with ethics and the self? \nM.F. No technique, no professional skill can be acquired without \nexercise; neither can one learn the art of living, the tekhne tou biou, \nwithout an askesis which must be taken as a training of oneself by one­\nself: this was one of the traditional principles to which the Pythag­\noreans, the Socratics, the Cynics had for a long time attributed great \nimportance. Among all the forms this training took (which included \nabstinences, memorizations, examinations of conscience, meditations, \nsilence, and listening to others), it seems that writing-the fact of writ­\ning for oneself and for others-came quite late to playa sizable role. \nQ. What specific role did the notebooks play when they finally be­\ncame influential in late antiquity? \nM.F. As personal as they were, the hupomnemata must nevertheless \nnot be taken for intimate diaries or for those accounts of spiritual expe­\nrience (temptations, struggles, falls, and victories) which can be found \nin later Christian literature. They do not constitute an \"account of one­\nself\"; their objective is not to bring the arcana conscientiae to light, the \nconfession of which-be it oral or written-has a purifying value. The \nmovement that they seek to effect is the inverse of this last one: the \npoint is not to pursue the indescribable, not to reveal the hidden, not \nto say the nonsaid, but, on the contrary, to collect the already-said, to \nreassemble that which one could hear or read, and this to an end which \nis nothing less than the constitution of oneself. \nThe hupomnemata are to be resituated in the context of a very sen­\nsitive tension of that period.

Such is the objective of the \nhupomnemata: to make of the recollection of the fragmentary logos \ntransmitted by teaching, listening, or reading a means to establish as \nadequate and as perfect a relationship of oneself to oneself as possible. \nQ. Before we tum to the role of these notebooks in early Christianity, \ncould you tell us something about how Greco-Roman austerity differs \nfrom Christian austerity? \nM.F. One thing that has been very important is that in Stoic ethics \nthe question of purity was nearly nonexistent or, rather, marginal. It was \nimportant in Pythagorean circles and also in the Neoplatonic schools \nand became more and more important through their influence and also \nthrough religious influences. At a certain moment, the problem of an \naesthetics of existence is covered over by the problem of purity, which \nis something else, and requires another kind of technique. In Chris­\ntian asceticism, the question of purity becomes more and more impor­\ntant; the reason why you have to take control of yourself is to keep \nyourself pure. The problem of virginity, this model of feminine integ­\nrity, becomes much more important in Christianity. The theme of vir­\nginity has nearly nothing to do with sexual ethics in Greco-Roman \nasceticism; there the problem is a problem of self-domination. It was \na virile model of self-domination, and a woman who was temperate \nwas as virile to herself as a man. The paradigm of sexual self-restraint \nbecomes a feminine paradigm through the theme of purity and virgin­\nity, based on the model of physical integrity. Physical integrity rather \nthan self-regulation became important. So the problem of ethics as an \naesthetics of existence is covered over by the problem of purification. \nThis new Christian self had to be constantly examined because in \nthis self were lodged concupiscence and desires of the flesh. From that \nmoment on, the self was no longer something to be made but something \nto be renounced and deciphered. Consequently, between paganism and \nChristianity, the opposition is not between tolerance and austerity but \nbetween a form of austerity linked to an aesthetics of existence and \nother forms of austerity linked to the necessity of renouncing the self \nand deciphering its truth. \nQ.

Yes, I think he has given mistaken credit to Christianity, given \nwhat we know about the evolution of pagan ethics from the fourth cen­\ntury B.C. to the fourth century after. \nQ. How was the role of the notebooks transformed when the tech­\nnique of using them to relate oneself to oneself was taken over by the \nChristians? \nM.F. One important change is that the writing down of inner move­\nments appears, according to Athanasius's text on the life of Saint \nAnthony, as an arm in spiritual combat: while the demon is a force \nthat deceives and makes one be deceived about oneself (one great half \nof the Vita Antonii is devoted to these ploys), writing constitutes a \ntest and something like a touchstone: in bringing to light the move­\nments of thought, it dissipates the inner shadow where the enemy's \nplots are woven. \nQ. How could such a radical transformation take place? \nM.F. There is indeed a dramatic change between the hupomnemata \nevoked by Xenophon, where it was only a question of remembering \nthe elements of a diet, and the description of the nocturnal temptations \nof Saint Anthony. An interesting place to look for a transitional set of \ntechniques seems to be the description of dreams. Almost from the \nbeginning, one had to have a notebook beside one's bed upon which \nto write one's dreams in order either to interpret them oneself the next \nmorning or to-show them to someone who would interpret them. By \nmeans of this nightly description, an important step is taken toward the \ndescription of the self. \nQ. But surely the idea that the contemplation of the self allows the \nself to dissipate shadows and arrive at truth is already present in Plato? \nM.F. Yes, but this is an ontological and not a psychological form of \ncontemplation. This ontological knowledge of the self takes shape, at \nleast in certain texts and in particular in the Alcibiades, in the form of \nthe contemplation of the soul by itself in terms of the famous meta­\nphor of the eye. Plato asks, \"How can the eye see itself?\" The answer \nis apparently very simple, but in fact it is very complicated. For Plato, \none cannot simply look at oneself in a mirror; one has to look into \nanother eye, that is, one in oneself, however in oneself in the shape of \nthe eye of the other. And there, in the other pupil, one will see one­\nself: the pupil serves as a mirror. And, in the same manner, the soul"

When grasp­\ning the mode of being of your soul, there is no need to ask yourself \nwhat you have done, what you are thinking, what the movements of \nyour ideas or your representations are, to what you are attached. That's \nwhy you can perform this technique of contemplation using as your \nobject the soul of an other. Plato never speaks of the examination of \nconscience- never! \nQ. It is a commonplace in literary studies that Montaigne was the \nfirst great autobiographer, yet you seem to trace writing about the self \nto much earlier sources. \nM.F. It seems to me that in the religious crisis of the sixteenth cen­\ntury-the great rejection of the Catholic confessional practices-new \nmodes of relationship to the self were being developed. We can see the \nreactivation of a certain number of ancient Stoic practices. The notion, \nfor example, of proofs of oneself seems to me thematically close to what \nwe find among the Stoics, where the experience of the self is not a \ndiscovering of a truth hidden inside the self but an attempt to deter­\nmine what one can and cannot do with one's available freedom. Among \nboth the Catholics and Protestants, the reactivation of these ancient \ntechniques in the form of Christian spiritual practices is quite marked. \nLet me take as an example the walking exercise recommended by \nEpictetus. Each morning, while taking a walk in the city, one should try \nto determine with respect to each thing (a public official or an attrac­\ntive woman), one's motives, whether one is impressed by or drawn to \nit, or whether one has sufficient self-mastery so as to be indifferent. \nIn Christianity one has the same sort of exercises, but they serve to test \none's dependence on God. I remember having found in a seventeenth­\ncentury text an exercise reminiscent of Epictetus, where a young semi­\nnarist, when he is walking, does certain exercises that show in what \nway each thing shows his dependence vis-a.-vis God-which permit \nhim to decipher the presence of divine providence. These two walks \ncorrespond to the extent that you have a case with Epictetus of a walk \nduring which the individual assures himself of his own sovereignty \nover himself and shows that he is dependent on nothing, while in the \nChristian case the seminarist walks and before each thing he sees, says,"

Techniques of the self, I believe, can be found \nin all cultures in different forms. Just as it is necessary to study and \ncompare the different techniques of the production of objects and the \ndirection of men by men through government, one must also question \ntechniques of the self. What makes the analysis of the techniques of \nthe self difficult is two things. First, the techniques of the self do not \nrequire the same material apparatus as the production of objects; there­\nfore they are often invisible techniques. Second, they are frequently \nlinked to the techniques for the direction of others. For example, if we \ntake educational institutions, we realize that one is managing others \nand teaching them to manage themselves. \nQ. Let's move on to the history of the modern subject.

We can see, therefore, a reappearance, up to a certain point, not \nof the culture of the self, which had never disappeared, but a reaffir­\nmation of its autonomy. \nIn the Renaissance, you also see-and here I refer to Burckhardt's \ntext on the famous aesthetics of existence-the hero as his own work of \nart. The idea that from one's own life one can make a work of art is an \nidea that was undoubtedly foreign to the Middle Ages, and reappears \nat the moment of the Renaissance. \nQ. So far you have been treating various degrees of appropriation of \nancient techniques of self-mastery. In your own writing, you always \nshow a big break between the Renaissance and the classical age. Was \nthere an equally significant change in the way self-mastery was related \nto other social practices? \nM.F. That is very interesting, but I won't answer you immediately. Let \nus start by saying that the relationship between Montaigne, Pascal, and \nDescartes could be rethought in terms of this question. First, Pascal was \nstill in a tradition in which practices of the self, the practice of asceti­\ncism, were tied up with the knowledge of the world. Second, we must \nnot forget that Descartes wrote \"meditations\"-and meditations are a \npractice of the self. But the extraordinary thing in Descartes's texts is \nthat he succeeded in substituting a subject as founder of practices of \nknowledge for a subject constituted through practices of the self. \nThis is very important. Even if it is true that Greek philosophy \nfounded rationality, it always held that a subject could not have access \nto the truth if he did not first operate upon himself a certain work that"

You also \nhave the theme of the Stoic exercise by which a subject first ensures \nhis autonomy and independence-and he ensures it in a rather com­\nplex relationship to the knowledge of the world, since it is this knowl­\nedge which allows him to ensure his independence, and it is only once \nhe has ensured it that he is able to recognize the order of the world as \nit stands. In European culture up to the sixteenth century, the problem \nremains: What is the work I must effect upon myself so as to be cap­\nable and worthy of acceding to the truth? To put it another way: truth \nalways has a price; no access to truth without ascesis. In Western cul­\nture up to the sixteenth century, asceticism and access to truth are \nalways more or less obscurely linked. \nDescartes, I think, broke with this when he said, \"To accede to truth, \nit suffices that I be any subject that can see what is evident.\" Evidence \nis substituted for ascesis at the point where the relationship to the self \nintersects the relationship to others and the world. The relationship to \nthe self no longer needs to be ascetic to get into relation to the truth. \nIt suffices that the relationship to the self reveals to me the obvious \ntruth of what I see for me to apprehend the truth definitively. Thus, \nI can be immoral and know the truth. I believe this is an idea that, \nmore or less explicitly, was rejected by all previous culture. Before \nDescartes, one could not be impure, immoral, and know the truth. \nWith Descartes, direct evidence is enough. After Descartes, we have a \nnonascetic subject of knowledge. This change makes possible the insti­\ntutionalization of modern science. \nI am obviously schematizing a very long history, which is, however, \nfundamental. After Descartes, we have a subject of knowledge which \nposes for Kant the problem of knowing the relationship between the \nsubject of ethics and that of knowledge. There was much debate in the \nEnlightenment as to whether these two subjects were completely dif­\nferent or not. Kant's solution was to find a universal subject that, to the \nextent it was universal, could be the subject of knowledge, but which \ndemanded, nonetheless, an ethical attitude-precisely the relationship \nto the self which Kant proposes in The Critique of Practical Reason. \nQ. You mean that once Descartes had cut scientific rationality loose \nfrom ethics, Kant reintroduced ethics as an applied form of procedural \nrationality? \nM.F. Right. Kant says, \"I must recognize myself as universal subject,"

In my lectures at the College de France, I \ntried to grasp it in terms of what may be called a practice of the self; \nalthough this phenomenon has not been studied very much, I believe \nit has been fairly important in our societies ever since the Greco-Roman \nperiod. In the Greek and Roman civilizations, such practices of the self \nwere much more important and especially more autonomous than they \nwere later, after they were taken over to a certain extent by religious, \npedagogical, medical, or psychiatric institutions. \nQ. Thus there has been a sort of shift: these games of truth no \nlonger involve a coercive practice, but a practice of self-formation of \nthe subject. \nM.F. That's right. It is what one could call an ascetic practice, tak­\ning asceticism in a very general sense-in other words, not in the sense \nof a morality of renunciation but as an exercise of the self on the self \nby which one attempts to develop and transform oneself, and to attain \nto a certain mode of being. Here I am taking asceticism in a more gen­\neral sense than that attributed to it by Max Weber, for example, but \nalong the same lines. \nQ. A work of the self on the self that may be understood as a cer­\ntain liberation, as a process of liberation? \nM.F. I would be more careful on that score. I have always been some­\nwhat suspicious of the notion of liberation, because if it is not treated \nwith precautions and within certain limits, one runs the risk of falling \nback on the idea that there exists a human nature or base that, as a con­\nsequence of certain historical, economic, and social processes, has been \nconcealed, alienated, or imprisoned in and by mechanisms of repres­\nsion. According to this hypothesis, all that is required is to brea~ these \nrepressive deadlocks and man will be reconciled with himself, redis­\ncover his nature or regain contact with his origin, and reestablish a full \nand positive relationship with himself. I think this idea should not be \naccepted without scrutiny. I am not trying to say that liberation as such, \nor this or that form of liberation, does not exist: when a colonized people \nattempts to liberate itself from its colonizers, this is indeed a practice \nof liberation in the strict sense.

This \nis why I emphasize practices of freedom over processes of liberation; \nagain, the latter indeed have their place, but they do not seem to me \nto be capable by themselves of defining all the practical forms of free­\ndom. This is precisely the problem I encountered with regard to sexu­\nality: does it make any sense to say, \"Let's liberate our sexuality\"? Isn't \nthe problem rather that of defining the practices of freedom by which \none could define what is sexual pleasure and erotic, amorous and pas­\nsionate relationships with others? This ethical problem of the defini­\ntion of practices of freedom, it seems to me, is much more important \nthan the rather repetitive affirmation that sexuality or desire must \nbe liberated. \nQ. But doesn't the exercise of practices of freedom require a certain \ndegree of liberation? \nM.F. Yes, absolutely. And this is where we must introduce the con­\ncept of domination. The analyses I am trying to make bear essentially \non relations of power. By this I mean something different from states \nof domination. Power relations are extremely widespread in human \nrelationships. Now, this means not that political power is everywhere, \nbut that there is in human relationships a whole range of power rela­\ntions that may come into play among individuals, within families, in \npedagogical relationships, political life, and so on. The analysis of \npower relations is an extremely complex area; one sometimes encoun­\nters what may be called situations or states of domination in which the \npower relations, instead of being mobile, allowing the various partic­\nipants to adopt strategies modifying them, remain blocked, frozen. \nWhen an individual or social group succeeds in blocking a field of \npower relations, immobilizing them and preventing any reversibility of \nmovement by economic, political, or military means, one is faced with \nwhat may be called a state of domination. In such a state, it is certain \nthat practices of freedom do not -exist or exist only unilaterally or are \nextremely constrained and limited. Thus, I agree with you that libera­\ntion is sometimes the political or historical condition for a practice of \nfreedom. Taking sexuality as an example, it is clear that a number of \nliberations were required vis-a-vis male power, that liberation was \nnecessary from an oppressive morality concerning heterosexuality as \nwell as homosexuality.

Can't liberation itself be a mode or form of practice of the freedom? \nM.F. Yes, in some cases. You have situations where liberation and \nthe struggle for liberation are indispensable for the practice of free­\ndom. With respect to sexuality, for example-and I am not indulging \nin polemics, because I don't like polemics, I think they are usually \nfutile-there is a Reichian model derived from a certain reading of \nFreud. Now, in Reich's view the problem was entirely one of liberation. \nTo put it somewhat schematically, according to him there is desire, \ndrive, prohibition, repression, internalization, and it is by getting rid \nof these prohibitions, in other words, by liberating oneself, that the \nproblem gets resolved.

It is inter­\nesting to see that, in our societies on the other hand, at a time that is \nvery difficult to pinpoint, the care of the self became somewhat suspect. \nStarting at a certain point, being concerned with oneself was readily \ndenounced as a form of self-love, a form of selfishness or self-interest \nin contradiction with the interest to be shown in others or the self­\nsacrifice required.

But in Christianity, salvation \nis attained through the renunciation of self. There is a paradox in the \ncare of the self in Christianity-but that is another problem. To come \nback to the question you were talking about, I believe that among the \nGreeks and Romans-especially the Greeks-concern with the self and \ncare of the self were required for right conduct and the proper prac­\ntice of freedom, in order to know oneself [se connaitre]-the familiar \naspect of the gnothi seauton-as well as to form oneself, to surpass one­\nself, to master the appetites that threaten to overwhelm one. Individual \nfreedom was very important for the Greeks-contrary to the common­\nplace derived more or less from Hegel that sees it as being of no impor­\ntance when placed against the imposing totality of the city. Not to be a \nslave (of another city, of the people around you, of those governing you, \nof your own passions) was an absolutely fundamental theme. The con­\ncern with freedom was an essential and permanent problem for eight \nfull centuries of ancient culture. What we have here is an entire ethics \nrevolving around the care of the self; this is what gives ancient ethics \nits particular form. I am not saying that ethics is synonymous with the \ncare of the self, but that, in antiquity, ethics as the conscious practice \nof freedom has revolved around this fundamental imperative: \"Take \ncare of yourself\" [soucie-toi de toi-meme]. \nQ. An imperative that implies the assimilation of the logoi, truths. \nM.F. Certainly. Taking care of oneself requires knowing [connaitre] \noneself. Care of the self is, of course, knowledge [connaissance] of the \nself-this is the Socratic-Platonic aspect-but also knowledge of a num­\nber of rules of acceptable conduct or of principles that are both truths \nand prescriptions. To take care of the self is to equip oneself with these \ntruths: this is where ethics is linked to the game of truth. \nQ. You are saying that it involves making this truth that is learned, \nmemorized, and progressively applied into a quasi subject that reigns \nsupreme in yourself. What is the status of this quasi subject? \nM.F. In the Platonic current of thought, at least at the end of the \nAlcibiades, the problem for the subject or the individual soul is to turn \nits gaze upon itself, to recognize itself in what it is and, recognizing \nitself in what it is, to recall the truths that issue from it and that it has \nbeen able to contemplate; I on the other hand, in the current of think­\ning we can broadly call Stoicism, the problem is to learn through the \nteaching of a number of truths and doctrines, some of which are fun-"

I would like to come back to the question of the relationship be­\ntween freedom and ethics. When you say that ethics is the reflective \npart [ta partie rijIechie] of freedom, does that mean that freedom can \nbecome aware of itself as ethical practice? Is it first and always a free­\ndom that is, so to speak, \"moralized,\" or must one work on oneself to \ndiscover the ethical dimension of freedom? \nM. F. The Greeks problematized their freedom, and the freedom of \nthe individual, as an ethical problem. But ethical in the sense in which \nthe Greeks understood it: ethos was a way of being and of behavior. It \nwas a mode of being for the subject, along with a certain way of act­\ning, a way visible to others. A person's ethos was evident in his cloth­\ning, app-earance, gait, in the calm with which he responded to every \nevent, and so on. For the Greeks, this was the concrete form of free­\ndom; this was the way they problematized their freedom. A man pos­\nsessed of a splendid ethos, who could be admired and put forward as \nan example, was someone who practiced freedom in a certain way. I \ndon't think that a shift is needed for freedom to be conceived as ethos; \nit is immediately problematized as ethos. But extensive work by the \nself on the self is required for this practice of freedom to take shape \nin an ethos that is good, beautiful, honorable, estimable, memorable, \nand exemplary. \nQ. Is this where you situate the analysis of power? \nM.F. I think that insofar as freedom for the Greeks signifies non­\nslavery-which is quite a different definition of freedom from our \nown-the problem is already entirely political. It is political in that \nnonslavery to others is a condition: a slave has no ethics. Freedom is \nthus inherently political.

As you have stated, care of the self is in a certain sense care for \nothers. In this sense, the care of the self is also always ethical, and eth­\nical in itself. \nM.F. What makes it ethical for the Greeks is not that it is care for \nothers. The care of the self is ethical in itself; but it implies complex \nrelationships with others insofar as this ethos of freedom is also a way \nof caring for others. This is why it is important for a free man who con­\nducts himself as he should to be able to govern his wife, his children, \nhis household; it is also the art of governing. Ethos also implies a rela­\ntionship with others, insofar as the care of the self enables one to occupy \nhis rightful position in the city, the community, or interpersonal rela­\ntionships, whether as a magistrate or a friend. And the care of the self \nalso implies a relationship with the other insofar as proper care of the \nself requires listening to the lessons of a master. One needs a guide, a \ncounselor, a friend, someone who will be truthful with you. Thus, the \nproblem of relationships with others is present throughout the devel­\nopment of the care of the self. \nQ. The care of the self always aims for the well-being of others; it aims \nto manage the space of power that exists in all relationships, but to \nmanage it in a nonauthoritarian manner. What role could a philosopher \nplay in this context, as a person who is concerned with care for others? \nM.F. Let's take Socrates as an example. He would greet people in \nthe street or adolescents in the gymnasium with the question: Are you \ncaring for you~self? For he has been entrusted with this mission by a \ngod and he will not abandon it even when threatened with death. He \nis the man who cares about the care of others; this is the particular \nposition of the philosopher. But let me simply say that in the case of \nthe free man, I think the postulate of this whole morality was that a \nperson who took proper care of himself would, by the same token, be \nable to conduct himself properly in relation to others and for others. \nA city in which everybody took proper care of himself would be a city \nthat functioned well and found in this the ethical principle of its per­\nmanence. But I don't think we can say that the Greek who cares for \nhimself must first care for others. To my mind, this view only came \nlater. Care for others should not be put before the care of oneself. The \ncare of the self is ethically prior in that the relationship with oneself is \nontologically prior."

A conversion, yes. In fact, it is a way of limiting and control­\nling power. For if it is true that slavery is the great risk that Greek free­\ndom resists, there is also another danger that initially appears to be the \nopposite of slavery: the abuse of power. In the abuse of power, one \nexceeds the legitimate exercise of one's power and imposes one's fan­\ntasies, appetites, and desires on others. Here we have the image of the \ntyrant, or simply of the rich and powerful man who uses his wealth and \npower to abuse others, to impose an unwarranted power on them. But \none can see-in any case, this is what the Greek philosophers say-that \nsuch a man is the slave of his appetites. And the good ruler is precisely \nthe one who exercises his power as it ought to be exercised, that is, \nsimultaneously exercising his power over himself. And it is the power \nover oneself that thus regulates one's power over others. \nQ. Doesn't the care of the self, when separated from care for oth­\ners, run the risk of becoming an absolute? And couldn't this \"absoluti­\nzation\" of the care of the self become a way of exercising power over \nothers, in the sense of dominating others? \nM.F. No, because the risk of dominating others and exercising a ty­\nrannical power over them arises precisely only when one has not taken \ncare of the self and has become the slave of one's desires. But if you \ntake proper care of yourself, that is, if you know ontologically what you \nare, if you know what you are capable of, if you know what it means for \nyou to be a citizen of a city, to be the master of a household in an oikos, \nif you know what things you should and should not fear, if you know \nwhat you can reasonably hope for and, on the other hand, what things \nshould not matter to you, if you know, finally, that you should not be \nafraid of death-if you know all this, you cannot abuse your power over \nothers. Thus, there is no danger. That idea will appear much later, when \nlove of self becomes suspect and comes to be perceived as one of the \nroots of various moral offenses. In this new context, renunciation of self \nwill be the prime form of care of the self. All this is evident in Gregory \nof Nyssa's Treatise on Virginity, which defines the care of the self, the \nepimeleia heautou, as the renunciation of all earthly attachments. It is \nthe renunciation of all that may be love of self, of attachment to an \nearthly self.:; But I think that in Greek and Roman thought the care of \nthe self cannot in itself tend toward so exaggerated a form of self-love \nas to neglect others or, worse still, to abuse one's power over them."

He who takes care of himself to the point of \nknowing exactly what duties he has as master of a household and as a \nhusband and father will find that he enjoys a proper relationship with \nhis wife and children. \nQ. But doesn't the human condition, in terms of its finitude, playa \nvery important role here? You have talked about death: if you are not \nafraid of death, then you cannot abuse your power over others. It seems \nto me that this problem of finitude is very important; the fear of death, \nof finitude, of being hurt, is at the heart of the care of the self. \nM.F. Of course. And this is where Christianity, by presenting salva­\ntion as occurring beyond life, in a way upsets or at least disturbs the \nbalance of the care of the self. Although, let me say it again, to seek \none's salvation definitely means to take care of oneself. But the condi­\ntion required for attaining salvation is precisely renunciation. Among \nthe Greeks and Romans, however, given that one takes care of oneself \nin one's own life, and that the reputation one leaves behind is the only \nafterlife one can expect, the care of the self can be centered entirely \non oneself, on what one does, on the place one occupies among oth­\ners. It can be centered totally on the acceptance of death-this will \nbecome quite evident in late Stoicism-and can even, up to a point, \nbecome almost a desire for death. At the same time, it can be, if not a \ncare for others, at least a care of the self which will be beneficial to oth­\ners. In Seneca, for example, it is interesting to note the importance of \nthe theme, let us hurry and get old, let us hasten toward the end, so \nthat we may thereby come back to ourselves. This type of moment \nbefore death, when nothing more can happen, is different from the \ndesire for death one finds among the Christians, who expect salvation \nthrough death.

But you have always \"forbidden\" people to talk to you about the \nsubject in general? \nM.F. No, I have not \"forbidden\" them. Perhaps I did not explain \nmyself adequately. What I rejected was the idea of starting out with a \ntheory of the subject-as is done, for example, in phenomenology or \nexistentialism-and, on the basis of this theory, asking how a given \nform of knowledge [connaissance] was possible. What I wanted to try \nto show was how the subject constituted itself, in one specific form or \nanother, as a mad or a healthy subject, as a delinquent or nondelinquent \nsubject, through certain practices that were also games of truth, prac­\ntices of power, and so on. I had to reject a priori theories of the sub­\nject in order to analyze the relationships that may exist between the \nconstitution of the subject or different forms of the subject and games \nof truth, practices of power, and so on. \nQ. That means that the subject is not a substance. \nM.F. It is not a substance. It is a form, and this form is not prima­\nrily or always identical to itself. You do not have the same type of rela­\ntionship to yourself when you constitute yourself as a political subject \nwho goes to vote or speaks at a meeting and when you are seeking to \nfulfill your desires in a sexual relationship. Undoubtedly there are rela­\ntionships and interferences between these different forms of the sub­\nject; but we are not dealing with the same type of subject. In each case, \none plays, one establishes a different type of. relationship to oneself."

But the mad, the ill, the delinquent subject-and perhaps even \nthe sexual subject-was a subject that was the object of a theoretical \ndiscourse, let us say a \"passive\" subject, while the subject you have been \nspeaking about over the past two years in your lectures at the College \nde France is an \"active,\" a politically active subject. The care of the self \nconcerns all the problems of political practice and government, and so \non. It would seem, then, that there has been a change for you, a change \nnot of perspective but of problematic. \nM.F. If it is indeed true that the constitution of the mad subject may \nbe considered the consequence of a system of coercion-this is the pas­\nsive subject-you know very well that the mad subject is not an unfree \nsubject, and that the mentally ill person is constituted as a mad sub­\nject preCisely in relation to and over against the one who declares him \nmad. Hysteria, which was so important in the history of psychiatry and \nin the asylums of the nineteenth century, seems to me to be the very \npicture of how the subject is constituted as a mad subject. And it is cer­\ntainly no accident that the major phenomena of hysteria were observed \nprecisely in those situations where there was a maximum of coercion \nto force individuals to constitute themselves as mad. On the other hand, \nI would say that if I am now interested in how the subject constitutes \nitself in an active fashion through practices of the self, these practices \nare nevertheless not something invented by the individual himself. They \nare models that he finds in his culture and are proposed, suggested, \nimposed upon him by his culture, his society, and his social group. \nQ. It would seem that there is something of a deficiency in your \nproblematic, namely, in the notion of resistance against power. Which \npresupposes a very active subject, very concerned with the care of itself \nand of others and, therefore, competent politically and philosophically. \nM.F. This brings us back to the problem of what I mean by power. I \nscarcely use the word power, and if I use it on occasion it is simply as \nshorthand for the expression I generally use: relations if power. But \nthere are readymade models: when one speaks of power, people imme­\ndiately think of a political structure, a government, a dominant social \nclass, the master and the slave, and so on. I am not thinking of this \nat all when I speak of relations of power.

So I am speaking of \nrelations that exist at different levels, in different forms; these power \nrelations are mobile, they can be modified, they are not fixed once and \nfor all. For example, the fact that I may be older than you, and that you \nmay initially have been intimidated, may be turned around during the \ncourse of our conversation, and I may end up being intimidated before \nsomeone precisely because he is younger than I am. These power rela­\ntions are thus mobile, reversible, and unstable. It should also be noted \nthat power relations are possible only insofar as the subjects are free. \nIf one of them were completely at the other's disposal and became his \nthing, an object on which he could wreak boundless and limitless vio­\nlence, there wouldn't be any relations of power. Thus, in order for power \nrelations to come into play, there must be at least a certain degree of \nfreedom on both sides. Even when the power relation is completely out \nof balance, when it can truly be claimed that one side has \"total power\" \nover the other, a power can be exercised over the other only insofar as \nthe other still has the option of killing himself, of leaping out the win­\ndow, or of killing the other person. This means that in power relations \nthere is necessarily the possibility of resistance because if there were \nno possibility of resistance (of violent resistance, flight, deception, strat­\negies capable of reversing the situation), there would be no power rela­\ntions at all. This being the general form, I refuse to reply to the question \nI am sometimes asked: \"But if power is everywhere, there is no free­\ndom.\" I answer that if there are relations of power in every social field, \nthis is because there is freedom everywhere. Of course, states of dom­\nination do indeed exist. In a great many cases, power relations are fixed \nin such a way that they are perpetually asymmetrical and allow an \nextremely limited margin of freedom. To take what is undoubtedly a \nvery simplified example, one cannot say that it was only men who \nwielded power in the conventional marital structure of the eighteenth \nand nineteenth centuries; women had quite a few options: they could \ndeceive their husbands, pilfer money from them, refuse them sex. Yet \nthey were still in (!. state of domination insofar as these options were \nultimately only stratagems that never succeeded in reversing the situ­\nation. In such cases of domination, be they economic, social, institu­\ntional, or sexual, the problem is knowing where resistance will develop. \nFor example, in a working class that will resist domination, will this \nbe in unions or political parties; and what form will it take-a strike,"

In such a sit­\nuation of domination, all of these questions demand specific answers \nthat take account of the kind.and precise form of domination in ques­\ntion. But the claim that \"you see power everywhere, thus there is no \nroom for freedom\" seems to me absolutely inadequate. The idea that \npower is a system of domination that controls everything and leaves no \nroom for freedom cannot be attributed to me. \nQ. You were talking before about the free man and the philosopher \nas two different modes· of the care of the self. The care of the self of \nthe philosopher would have a specificity that cannot be confused with \nthat of the free man. \nM.F. I would say that these figures represent two different places in \nthe care of the self, rather than two forms of care of the self. I believe \nthat the form of such care remains the same, but in terms of intensity, \nin the degree of zeal for the self, and, consequently, also for others, the \nplace of the philosopher is not that of just any free man. \nQ. Is there a fundamental link we can make at this point between \nphilosophy and politics? \nM.F. Yes, certainly. I believe that the relationship between philosophy \nand politics is permanent and fundamental. It is certain that if one takes \nthe history of the care of the self in Greek philosophy, the relationship \nwith politics is obvious. And it takes a very complex form: on the one \nhand, you have, for example, Socrates as well as Plato in the Alcibiades4' \nand Xenophon in the Memorabilia 5-greeting young men, saying to \nthem: \"You want to become a politician, to govern a city, to care for \nothers, and you haven't even taken care of yourself. If you do not care \nfor yourself you will make a poor ruler.\" From this perspective, the care \nof the self appears a pedagogical, ethical, and also ontological condition \nfor the development of a good ruler. To constitute oneself as a govern­\ning subject implies that one has constituted oneself as a subject who \ncares for oneself. Yet, on the other hand, we have Socrates saying in the \nApology that he approaches everyone because everyone has to take care \nof himself;6 but he also adds, \"In doing so, I am performing the highest \nservice for the city, and instead of punishing me, you should reward \nme even more than you reward a winner in the Olympic Games.\"7 \nThus we see a very strong connection between philosophy and politics, \nwhich was to develop further when the philosopher would care not only \nfor the soul of the citizen but for that of the prince. The philosopher \nbecomes the prince's counselor, teacher, and spiritual adviser."

Could the problematic of the care of the self be at the heart of a \nnew way of thinking about politics, of a form of politics different from \nwhat we know today? \nM.F. I admit that I have not got very far in this direction, and I would \nvery much like to come back to more contemporary questions to try to \nsee what can be made of all this in the context of the current political \nproblematic. But I have the impression that in the political thought of \nthe nineteenth century-and perhaps one should go back even farther, \nto Rousseau and Hobbes-the political subject was conceived of essen­\ntially as a subject of law, whether natural or positive. On the other \nhand, it seems to me that contemporary political thought allows very \nlittle room for the question of the ethical subject. I don't like to reply \nto questions I haven't studied. However, I would very much like to \ncome back to the questions I examined through ancient culture. \nQ. What is the relationship between the path of philosophy, which \nleads to knowledge of the self, an~ the path of spirituality? \nM.F. By spirituality I mean-but I'm not sure this definition can hold \nfor very long-the subject's attainment of a certain mode of being and \nthe transformations that the subject must carry out on itself to attain \nthis mode of being. I believe that spirituality and philosophy were iden­\ntical or nearly identical in ancient spirituality. In any case, philosophy's \nmost important preoccupation centered around the self, with knowl­\nedge [connai5sance] of the world coming after and serving, most often, \nto support the care of the self.· Reading Descartes, it is remarkable to \nfind in the Meditations this same spiritual concern with the attainment \nof a mode of being where doubt was no longer possible, and where one \ncould finally know [connai't].B But by thus defining the mode of being \nto which philosophy gives access, one realizes that this mode of being \nis defined entirely in terms of knowledge, and that philosophy in turn \nis defined in terms of the development of the knowing [connaissant] \nsubject, or of what qualifies the subject as such. From this perspective, \nit seems to me that philosophy superimposes the functions ofspiritu­\nality upon the ideal of a grounding for scientificity. \nQ. Should the concept of the care of the self in the classical sense \nbe updated to confront this modern thought? \nM.F. Absolutely, but I would certainly not do so just to say, \"We have \nunfortunately forgotten about the care of the self; so here, here it is, \nthe key to everything.\" Nothing is more foreign to me than the idea \nthat, at a certain moment, philosophy went astray and forgot something,"

I feel that all such forms of analysis, whether \nthey take a radical form and claim that philosophy has from the outset \nbeen a forgetting, or whether they take a much more historical view­\npoint and say, \"Such and such a philosopher forgot something\"­\nneither of these approaches is particularly interesting or useful. Which \ndoes not mean that contact with such and such a philosopher may not \nproduce something, but it must be emphasized that it would be some­\nthing new. \nQ. This leads me to ask: Why should one have access to the truth \ntoday, to truth in the political sense, in other words, in the sense of a \npolitical strategy directed against the various \"blockages\" of power in \nthe system of relations? \nM.F. This is indeed a problem. After all, why truth? Why are we con­\ncerned with truth, and more so than with the care of the self? And why \nmust the care of the self occur only through the concern for truth? I \nthink we are touching on a fundamental question here, what I would \ncall the question for the West: How did it come about that all of West­\nern culture began to revolve around this obligation of truth which has \ntaken a lot of different forms? Things being as they are, nothing so far \nhas shown that it is possible to define a strategy outside of this con­\ncern. It is within the field of the obligation to truth that it is possible \nto move about in one way or another, sometimes against effects of \ndomination which may be linked to structures of truth or institutions \nentrusted with truth. To greatly simplify matters, there are numerous \nexamples: there has been a whole so-called ecological movement-a \nvery ancient one, by the way, that did not just start in the twentieth \ncentury-that was often in opposition, as it were, to a science or, at \nleast, to a technology underwritten by claims to truth. But this same \necology articulated its own discourse of truth: criticism was authorized \nin the name of a knowledge [connaissance] of nature, the balance of \nlife processes, and so on. Thus, one escaped from a domination of truth \nnot by playing a game that was totally different from the game of truth \nbut by playing the same game differently, or playing another game, \nanother hand, with other trump cards. I believe that the same holds \ntrue in the order of politics; here one can criticize on the basis, for \nexample, of the consequences of the state of domination caused by \nan unjustified political situation, but one can only do so by playing a \ncertain game of truth, by showing its consequences, by pointing out"

With regard to the question of games of truth and games of power, \ndon't you think that there can be found in history evidence of a partic­\nular kind of these games of truth, one that has a particular status in \nrelation to all other possible games of truth and power, and is marked \nby its essential openness, its opposition to all blockages of power­\npower here meaning domination/subjugation? \nM.F. Yes, absolutely. But when I talk about power relations and games \nof truth, I am absolutely not saying that games of truth are just con­\ncealed power relations-that would be a horrible exaggeration. My \nproblem, as I have already said, is in understanding how truth games \nare set up and how they are connected with power relations. One can \nshow, for example, that the medicalization of madness, in other words, \nthe organization of medical knowledge [savoir] around individuals \ndesignated as mad, was connected with a whole series of social and \neconomic processes at a given time, but also with institutions and prac­\ntices of power. This fact in no way impugns the scientific validity or \nthe therapeutic effectiveness of psychiatry: it does not endorse psychi­\natry, but neither does it invalidate it. It is also true that mathematics, \nfor example, is linked, albeit in a completely different manner than psy­\nchiatry, to power structures, if only in the way it is taught, the way in \nwhich consensus among mathematicians is organized, functions in a \nclosed circuit, has its values, determines what is good (true) or bad \n(false) in mathematics. This in no way means that mathematics is only \na game of power, but that the game of truth of mathematics is linked \nin a certain way-without thereby being invalidated in any way-to \ngames and institutions of power. It is clear that in some cases these \nconnections are such that one could write the entire history of mathe­\nmatics without taking them into account, although this problematic is \nalways interesting and even historians of mathematics are now begin­\nning to study the history of their institutions. Finally, it is clear that the \nconnection that may exist between power relations and games of truth \nin mathematics is totally different from what it is in psychiatry; in any \ncase, one simply cannot say that games of truth are nothing but games \nof power. \nQ.

For, in games of truth, \none can play at speaking the truth: there is a game, one plays at truth \nor truth is a game. \nM.F. The word \"game\" can lead you astray: when I say \"game,\" I \nmean a set of rules by which truth is produced. It is not a game in the \nsense of an amusement; it is a set of procedures that lead to a certain \nresult, which, on the basis of its principles and rules of procedure, may \nbe considered valid or invalid, winning or losing. \nQ. There remains the problem of \"who\": Is it a group, a body? \nM.F. It may be a group or an individual. Indeed, there is a problem \nhere. With regard to these multiple games of truth, one can see that \never since the age of the Greeks our society has been marked by the \nlack of a precise and imperative definition of the games of truth which \nare permitted to the exclusion of ali others. In a given game of truth, \nit is always possible to discover something different and to more or less \nmodify this or that rule, and sometimes even the entire game of truth. \nThis has undoubtedly given the West possibilities for development not \nfound in other societies. Who speaks the truth? Free individuals who \nestablish a certain consensus, and who find themselves within a cer­\ntain network of practices of power and constraining institutions. \nQ. So truth is not a construction? \nM.F. That depends. There are games of truth in which truth is a con­\nstruction and others in which it is not. One can have, for example, a \ngame of truth that consists of describing things in such and such a way: \na person giving an anthropological description of a society supplies not \na construction but a description, which itself has a certain number of \nhistorically changing rules, so that one can say that it is to a certain \nextent a construction with respect to another description. This does not \nmean that there's just a void, that everything is a figment of the imag­\nination. On the basis of what can be said, for example, about this trans­\nformation of games of truth, some people conclude that I have said that \nnothing exists-I have been seen as saying that madness does not exist, \nwhereas the problem is absolutely the converse: it was a question of \nknowing how madness, under the various definitions that have been \ngiven, was at a particular time integrated into an institutional field that \nconstituted it as a mental illness occupying a specific place alongside \nother illnesses. \nQ.

I do not know whether \nor not that practice was more effective; it was unquestionably more \nentertaining. \nIn any event, in line with this custom, in November 1784 a German \nperiodical, Berlinische Monatschrifi, published a response to the ques­\ntion: Was ist Aujkliirung? And the respondent was Kant. \nA minor text, perhaps. But it seems to me that it marks the discreet \nentrance into the history of thought of a question that modern philos­\nophy has not been capable of answering but has never managed to get \nrid of either. And one that has been repeated in various forms for two \ncenturies now. From Hegel through Nietzsche or Max Weber to Hork­\nheimer or Habermas, hardly any philosophy has failed to confront this \nsame question, directly or indirectly. What, then, is this event that is \ncalled the Aujkliirung and that has determined, at least in part, what \nwe are, what we think, and what we do today? Let us imagine that \nthe Berlinische Monatschrift still exists and that it is asking its ~eaders \nthe question: What is modern philosophy? Perhaps we could respond \nwith an echo: modern philosophy is the philosophy that is attempt-\n*This translation, by Catherine Porter, has been amended."

      "text": "Ethics: Subjectivity and Truth \ning to answer the question raised so imprudently two centuries ago: \nWas ist Aufkliirung? \nLet us linger a few moments over Kant's text. It merits attention for \nseveral reasons. \n1. To this same question, Moses Mendelssohn had also replied in \nthe same journal, just two months earlier. But Kant had not seen Men­\ndelssohn's text when he wrote his. To be sure, the encounter of the \nGerman philosophical movement with the new development of Jew­\nish culture does not date from this precise moment. Mendelssohn had \nbeen at that crossroads for thirty years or so, in company with Lessing. \nBut up to this point it had been a matter of making a place for Jewish \nculture within German thought-which Lessing had tried to do in Die \nJuden-or else of identifying problems common to Jewish thought \nand to German philosophy; this is what Mendelssohn had done in his \nPhiidon; oder, iiber die Unsterblichkeit der Seele. With the two texts \npublished in the Berlinische Monatschrift, the German Aufkliirung and \nthe Jewish Haskala recognize that they belong to the same history; they \nare seeking to identify the common processes from which they stem. \nAnd it is perhaps a way of announcing the acceptance of a common \ndestiny-we now know to what drama that was to lead. \n2. But there is more. In itself and within the Christian tradition, \nKant's text poses a new problem. \nIt was certainly not the first time that philosophical thought had \nsought to reflect on its own present. But, speaking schematically, we \nmay say that this reflection had until then taken three main forms . \n• The present may be represented as belonging to a certain era of \nthe world, distinct from the others through some inherent charac­\nteristics, or separated from the others by some dramatic event. \nThus, in Plato's The Statesman the interlocutors recognize that \nthey belong to one of those revolutions of the world in which the \nworld is turning backward, with all the negative consequences that \nmay ensue . \n• The present may be interrogated in an attempt to decipher in it the \nheralding signs of a forthcoming event. Here we have the princi­\nple of a kind of historical hermeneutics of which Augustine might \nprovide an example."

      "text": "What is Enlightenment? \n• The present may also be analyzed as a point of transition toward \nthe dawning of a new world. That is what Vico describes in the last \nchapter of La Scienza nuova; what he sees \"today\" is \"a complete \nhumanity ... spread abroad through all nations, for a few great mon­\narchs rule over this world of peoples\"; it is also \"Europe ... radiant \nwith such humanity that it abounds in all the good things that make \nfor the happiness of human life.\" I \nNow, the way Kant poses the question of Aujkliirung is entirely dif­\nferent: it is neither a world era to which one belongs, nor an event \nwhose signs are perceived, nor the dawning of an accomplishment. \nKant defines Aujkliirung in an almost entirely negative way, as an \nA llsgang, an \"exit,\" a \"way out.\" In his other texts on history, Kant \noccasionally raises questions of origin or defines the internal teleology \nof a historical process. In the text on Aujkliirung, he deals with the \nquestion of contemporary reality alone. He is not seeking to understand \nthe present on the basis of a totality or of a future achievement. He is \nlooking for a difference: What difference does today introduce with \nrespect to yesterday? \n3. I shall not go into detail here concerning this text, which is not \nalways very clear despite its brevity. I should simply like to point out \nthree or four features that seem to me important if we are to under­\nstand how Kant raised the philosophical question of the present day \n[du present]. \nKant indicates right away that the \"way out\" which characterizes \nEnlightenment is a process that releases us from the status of \"imma­\nturity.\" And by \"immaturity,\" he means a certain state of our will which \nmakes us accept someone else's authority to lead us in areas where the \nuse of reason is called for. Kant gives three examples: we are in a state \nof \"immaturity\" when a book takes the place of our understanding, \nwhen a spiritual director takes the place of our conscience, when a doc­\ntor decides for us what our diet is to be. (Let us note in passing that \nthe register of these three critiques is easy to recognize, even though the \ntext does not make it explicit.) In any case, Enlightenment is defined \nby a modification of the preexisting relation linking will, authority, and \nthe use of reason. \nWe must also note that this way out is presented by Kant in a rather \nambiguous manner. He characterizes it as a phenomenon, an ongoing \nprocess; but he also presents it as a task and an obligation. From the"

Thus, it has to be supposed that he will be able to \nescape from it only by a change that he himself will bring about in him­\nself. Significantly, Kant says that this Enlightenment has a Wahlspruch: \nnow, a Wahlspruch is a heraldic device, that is, a distinctive feature by \nwhich one can be recognized, and it is also a motto, an instruction that \none gives oneself and proposes to others. What, then, is this instruc­\ntion? Aude sapere: \"dare to know,\" \"have the courage, the audacity, to \nknow.\" Thus, Enlightenment must be considered both as a process in \nwhich men participate collectively and as an act of courage to be accom­\nplished personally. Men are at once elements and agents of a single \nprocess. They may be actors in the process to the extent that they par­\nticipate in it; and the process occurs to the extent that men decide to \nbe its voluntary actors. \nA third difficulty appears here in Kant's text, in his use of the word \n\"mankind,\" Menschheit. The importance of this word in the Kantian \nconception of history is well known. Are we to understand that the \nentire human race is caught up in the process of Enlightenment? In \nthat case, we must imagine Enlightenment as a historical change that \naffects the political and social existence of all people on the face of the \nearth. Or are we to understand that it involves a change affecting what \nconstitutes the humanity of human beings? But the question then arises \nof knowing what this change is. Here again, Kant's answer is not with­\nout a certain ambiguity. In any case, beneath its appearance of simplic­\nity, it is rather complex. \nKant defines two essential conditions under which mankind can \nescape from its immaturity. And these two conditions are at once spir­\nitual and institutional, ethical and political. \nThe first of these conditions is that the realm of obedience and the \nrealm of the use of reason be clearly distinguished. Briefly character­\nizing the immature status, Kant invokes the familiar expression: \"Don't \nthink, just follow orders\"; such is, according to him, the form in which \nmilitary discipline, political power, and religious authority are usually \nexercised. Humanity will reach maturity when it is no longer required \nto obey, but when men are told: \"Obey, and you will be able to reason \nas much as you like.\" We must note that the German word used here \nis riisonieren; this word, which is also used in the Critiques, refers not \nto just any use of reason but to a use of reason in which reason has no \nother end but itself: riisonieren is to reason for reasoning's sake.

Yet \nit is here that Kant brings into play another distinction, and in a rather \nsurprising way. The distinction he introduces is between the private \nand public uses of reason. Yet he adds at once that reason must be free \nin its public use and must be submissive in its private use. Which is, \nterm for term, the opposite of what is ordinarily called freedom of \nconscience. \nBut we must be somewhat more precise. What constitutes, for Kant, \nthis private use of reason? In what area is it exercised? Man, Kant says, \nmakes a private use of reason when he is \"a cog in a machine,\" that \nis, when he has a role to play in society and jobs to do: to be a soldier, \nto have taxes to pay, to be in charge of a parish, to be a civil servant, \nall this makes the human being a particular segment of society; he finds \nhimself thereby placed in a circumscribed position, where he has to \napply particular rules and pursue particular ends. Kant asks not that \npeople practice a blind and foolish obedience but that they adapt the \nuse they make of their reason to these determined circumstances; and \nreason must then be subjected to the particular ends in view. Thus, \nthere cannot be, here, any free use of reason . \n.on the other hand, when one is reasoning only in order to use one's \nreason, when one is reasoning as a reasonable being (and not as a \ncog in a machine), when one is reasoning as a member of reasonable \nhumanity, then the use of reason must be free and public. Enlighten­\nment is thus not merely the process by which individuals would see \ntheir own personal freedom of thought guaranteed. There is Enlight­\nenment when the universal, the free, and the public uses of reason are \nsuperimposed on one another. \nNow this leads us to a fourth question that must be put to Kant's text. \nWe can readily see how the universal use of reason (apart from any pri­\nvate end) is the business of the subject himself as an individual; we can \nreadily see, too, how the freedom of this use may be assured in a purely \nnegative manner through the absence of any challenge to it; but how"

Enlightenment, as we see, \nmust not be conceived simply as a general process affecting all human­\nity; it must not be conceived only as an obligation prescribed to indi­\nviduals: it now appears as a political problem. The question, in any \nevent, is that of knowing how the use of reason can take the public form \nthat it requires, how the audacity to know can be exercised in broad \ndaylight, while individuals are obeying as scrupulously as possible. And \nKant, in conclusion, proposes to Frederick II, in scarcely veiled terms, \na sort of contract-what might be called the contract of rational des­\npotism with free reason: the public and free use of autonomous rea­\nson will be the best guarantee of obedience, on condition, however, that \nthe political principle which must be obeyed itself be in conformity with \nuniversal reason. \nLet us leave Kant's text here. I do not by any means propose to con­\nsider it as capable of constituting an adequate description of Enlighten­\nment; and no historian, I think, could be satisfied with it for an analysis \nof the social, political, and cultural transformations that occurred at the \nend of the eighteenth century. \nNevertheless, notwithstanding its circumstantial nature, and with­\nout intending to give it an exaggerated place in Kant's work, I believe \nthat it is necessary to stress the connection that exists between this brief \narticle and the three Critiques. Kant, in fact, describes Enlightenment \nas the moment when humanity is going to put its own reason to use, \nwithout subjecting itself to any authority; now, it is precisely at this \nmoment that the critique a is necessary, since its role is that of defin­\ning the conditions under which the use of reason is legitimate in order \nto determine what can be known [connaitre], what must be done, and \nwhat may be hoped. Illegitimate uses of reason are what give rise to \ndogmatism and heteronomy, along with illusion; on the other hand, it \nis when the legitimate use of reason has been clearly defined in its \nprinciples that its autonomy can be assured. The critique is, in a sense, \nthe handbook of reason that has grown up in Enlightenment; and, \nconversely, the Enlightenment is the age of the critique. \nIt is also necessary, I think, to underline the relation between this \ntext of Kant's and the other texts he devoted to history.

It is a reflection by Kant on the contemporary status of his own \nenterprise. No doubt, it is not the first time that a philosopher has given \nhis reasons for undertaking his work at a particular moment.

It is in the reflection on \"today\" as dif­\nference in history and as motive for a particular philosophical task that \nthe novelty of this text appears to me to lie. \nAnd, by looking at it in this way, it seems to me we may recognize \na point of departure: the outline of what one might call the attitude \nof modernity. \nII \nI know that modernity is often spoken of as an epoch, or at least as a \nset of features characteristic of an epoch; situated on a calendar, it \nwould be preceded by a more or less naive or archaic premodernity, \nand followed by an enigmatic and troubling \"postmodernity.\" And then \nwe find ourselves asking whether modernity constitutes the sequel to \nthe Enlightenment and its development, or whether we are to see it \nas a rupture or a deviation with respect to the basic principles of the \neighteenth century. \nThinking back on Kant's text, I wonder whether we may not envis­\nage modernity as an attitude rather than as a period of history. And by \n\"attitude,\" I mean a mode of relating to contemporary reality; a vol­\nuntary choice made by certain people; in the end, a way of thinking \nand feeling; a way, too, of acting and behaving that at one and the same \ntime marks a relation of belonging and presents itself as a task.

Modernity is often characterized in terms of consciousness of the \ndiscontinuity of time: a break with tradition, a feeling of novelty, a \nvertigo in the face of the passing moment. And this is indeed what \nBaudelaire seems to be saying when he defines modernity as \"the \nephemeral, the fleeting, the contingent.\"2 But, for him, being modern \ndoes not lie in recognizing and accepting this perpetual movement; on \nthe contrary, it lies in adopting a certain attitude with respect to this \nmovement; and this deliberate, difficult attitude consists in recapturing \nsomething eternal that is not beyond the present instant, nor behind \nit, but within it. Modernity is distinct from fashion, which does no \nmore than call into question the course of time; modernity is the atti­\ntude that makes it possible to grasp the \"heroic\" aspect of the present \nmoment. Modernity is not a phenomenon of sensitivity to the fleeting \npresent; it is the will to \"heroize\" the present. \nI shall restrict myself to what Baudelaire says about the painting \nof his contemporaries. Baudelaire makes fun of those painters who, \nfinding nineteenth-century dress excessively ugly, want to depict noth­\ning but ancient togas. But modernity in painting does not consist, for \nBaudelaire, in introducing black clothing onto the canvas. The modern \npainter is the one who can show the dark frock-coat as \"the necessary \ncostume of our time,\" the one who knows how to make manifest, in \nthe fashion of the day, the essential, permanent, obsessive relation that \nour age entertains with death. \"The dress-coat and frock-coat not only \npossess their political beauty, which is an expression of universal equal­\nity, but also their poetic beauty, which is an expression of the public \nsoul-an immense cortege of undertaker's mutes (mutes in love, polit­\nical mutes, bom:geois mutes ... ). We are each of us celebrating some \nfuneral.\"3 To designate this attitude of modernity, Baudelaire some­\ntimes employs a litotes that is highly Significant because it is presented \nin the form of a precept: \"You have no right to despise the present.\" \n2. This heroization is ironic, needless to say. The attitude of mod­\nernity does not treat the passing moment as sacred in order to try to \nmaintain or perpetuate it.

The jlaneur, the idle, strolling spec­\ntator, is satisfied to keep his eyes open, to pay attention and to build \nup a storehouse of memories. In opposition to the jlaneur, Baudelaire \ndescribes the man of modernity: \"Away he goes, hurrying, searching .... \nBe very sure that this man ... this solitary, gifted with an active imagi­\nnation, ceaselessly journeying across the great human desert-has an \naim loftier than that of a mere jlaneur, an aim more general, some­\nthing other than the fugitive pleasure of circumstance. He is looking for \nthat quality which you must allow me to call 'modernity.' ... He makes \nit his business to extract from fashion whatever element it may con­\ntain of poetry, within history.\" As an example of modernity, Baudelaire \ncites the artist Constantin Guys. In appearance a spectator, a collector \nof curiosities, he remains \"the last to linger wherever there can be a \nglow of light, an echo of poetry, a quiver of life or a chord of music; \nwherever a passion can pose before him, wherever natural man and \nconventional man display themselves in a strange beauty, wherever the \nsun lights up the swift joys of the depraved animal.\"4 \nBut let us make no mistake. Constantin Guys is not ajlaneur; what \nmakes him the modern painter par excellence in Baudelaire's eyes is \nthat, just when the whole world is falling asleep, he begins to work, \nand he transfigures that world. His transfiguration entails not an annul­\nling of reality but a difficult interplay between the truth of what is real \nand the exercise of freedom; \"natural\" things become \"more than nat­\nural,\" \"beaut~ful\" things become \"more than beautiful,\" and individ­\nual objects appear \"endowed with an impulsive life like the soul of \n[their] creator.\"5 For the attitude of modernity, the high value of the \npresent is indissociable from a desperate eagerness to imagine it, to \nimagine it otherwise than it is, and to transform it not by destroying it \nbut by grasping it in what it is. Baudelairean modernity is an exercise \nin which extreme attention to what is real is confronted with the prac­\ntice of a liberty that simultaneously respects this reality and violates it. \n3. However, modernity for Baudelaire is not simply a form of rela­\ntionship to the present; it is also a mode of relationship that must be \nestablished with oneself. The deliberate attitude of modernity is tied \nto an indispensable asceticism. To be modern is not to accept oneself \nas one is in the flux of the passing moments; it is to take oneself as \nobject of a complex and difficult elaboration: what Baudelaire, in the \nvocabulary of his day, calls dandysme.

Humanism serves to color and to justify the conceptions of man \nto which it is, after all, obliged to take recourse. \nNow, in this connection, I believe that this thematic, which so often \nrecurs, and always depends on humanism, can be opposed by the prin­\nciple of a critique and a permanent creation of ourselves in our auton­\nomy: that is, a principle at the heart of the historical consciousness that \nthe Enlightenment has of itself. From this standpoint, I am inclined to \nsee Enlightenment and humanism in a state of tension rather than \nidentity. \nIn any case, it seems to me dangerous to confuse them; and further, \nit seems historically inaccurate. If the question of man, of the human \nspecies, of the humanist, was important throughout the eighteenth cen­\ntury, this is very rarely, I believe, because the Enlightenment consid­\nered itself a humanism. It is worthwhile, too, to note that throughout \nthe nineteenth century, the historiography of sixteenth-century human­\nism, which was so important for people like Saint-Beuve or Burckhardt, \nwas always distinct from, and sometimes explicitly opposed to, the \nEnlightenment and the eighteenth century. The nineteenth century had \na tendency to oppose the two, at least as much as to confuse them. \nIn any case, I think that, just as we must free ourselves from the \nintellectual blackmail of \"being for or against the Enlightenment,\" we \nmust escape from the historical and moral confusionism that mixes the"

An anal­\nysis of their complex relations in the course of the last two centuries \nwould be a worthwhile project, an important one if we are to bring \nsome measure of clarity to the consciousness that we have of ourselves \nand of our past. \nPositively \nYet while taking these precautions into account, we must obviously give \na more positive content to what may be a philosophical ethos consisting \nin a critique of what we are saying, thinking, and doing, through a his­\ntorical ontology of ourselves. \n1. This philosophical ethos may be characterized as a limit-attitude. \nWe are not talking about a gesture of rejection. We have to move beyond \nthe outside-inside alternative; we have to be at the frontiers. Criticism \nindeed consists of analyzing and reflecting upon limits. But if the Kant­\nian question was that of knowing [savoir] what limits knowledge [con­\nnaissance] must renounce exceeding, it seems to me that the critical \nquestion today must be turned back into a positive one: In what is given \nto us as universal, necessary, obligatory, what place is occupied by what­\never is singular, contingent, and the product of arbitrary constraints? \nThe point, in brief, is to transform the critique conducted in the form \nof necessary limitation into a practical critique that takes the form of a \npossible crossing-over Lfranchissement]. \nThis entails an obvious consequence: that criticism is no longer going \nto be practiced in the search for formal structures with universal value \nbut, rather, as a historical investigation into the events that have led \nus to constitute ourselves and to recognize ourselves as subjects of \nwhat we are doing, thinking, saying. In that sense, this criticism is not \ntranscendental, and its goal is not that of making a metaphysics pos­\nsible: it is genealogical in its design and archaeological in its method. \nArchaeological-and not transcendental-in the sense that it will not \nseek to identify the universal structures of all knowledge [connaissance] \nor of all possible moral action, but will seek to treat the instances of \ndiscourse that articulate what we think, say, and do as so many histor­\nical events. And this critique will be genealogical in the sense that it \nwill not deduce from the form of what we are what it is impossible \nfor us to do and to know; but it will separate out, from the contin­\ngency that has made us what we are, the possibility of no longer being,"

Yet if we are not to settle for the affirmation or the empty dream \nof freedom, it seems to me that this historico-critical attitude must also \nbe an experimental one. I mean that this work done at the limits of our­\nselves must, on the one hand, open up a realm of historical inquiry and, \non the other, put itself to the test of reality, of contemporary reality, \nboth to grasp the points where change is possible and desirable, and \nto determine the precise form this change should take. This means that \nthe historical ontology of ourselves must turn away from all projects that \nclaim to be global or radical. In fact, we know from experience that the \nclaim to escape from the system of contemporary reality so as to pro­\nduce the overall programs of another society, of another way of think­\ning, another culture, another vision of the world, has led only to the \nreturn of the most dangerous traditions. \nI prefer the very specific transformations that have proved to be pos­\nsible in the last twenty years in a certain number of areas which con­\ncern our ways of being and thinking, relations to authority, relations \nbetween the sexes, the way in which we perceive insanity or illness; I \nprefer even these partial transformations, which have been made in the \ncorrelation of historical analysis and the practical attitude, to the pro­\ngrams for a new man that the worst political systems have repeated \nthroughout the twentieth century. \nI shall thus characterize the philosophical ethos appropriate to the \ncritical ontology of ourselves as a historico-practical test of the limits \nwe may go beyond, and thus as work carried out by ourselves upon our­\nselves as free beings. \n3. Still, the following objection would no doubt be entirely legit­\nimate: If we limit ourselves to this type of always partial and local \ninquiry or test, do we not run the risk of letting ourselves be deter­\nmined by more general structures of which we may well not be con­\nscious and over which we may have no control? \nTo this, two responses. It is true that we have to give up hope of ever \nacceding to a point of view that could give us access to any complete \nand definitive knowledge [connaissancel of what may constitute our \nhistorical limits.

These are indicated by what might be called \"the par­\nadox of the relations of capacity and power.\" We know that the great \npromise or the great hope of the eighteenth century, or a part of the \neighteenth century, lay in the simultaneous and proportional growth of \nindividuals with respect to one another. And, moreover, we can see that \nthroughout the entire history of Western societies (it is perhaps here \nthat the root of their singular historical destiny is located-such a pecul­\niar destiny, so different from the others in its trajectory and so univer­\nsalizing, so dominant with respect to the others), the acquisition of \ncapabilities and the struggle for freedom have constituted permanent \nelements. Now, the relations between the growth of capabilities and \nthe growth of autonomy are not as simple as the eighteenth century \nmay have believed. And we have been able to see what forms of power \nrelation were conveyed by various technologies (whether we are speak­\ning of productions with economic aims, or institutions whose goal is \nsocial regulation, or of techniques of communication): disciplines, both \ncollective and individual, procedures of normalization exercised in the \nname of the power of the state, demands of society or of population \nzones, are examples. What is at stake, then, is this: how can the growth \nof capabilities [capacites] be disconnected from the intensification of \npower relations? \nHOMOGENEITY. This leads to the study of what could be called \n\"practical systems.\" Here we are taking as a homogeneous domain of \nreference not the representations that men give of themselves, not the \nconditions that determine them without their knowledge, but rather \nwhat they do and the way they do it. That is, the forms of rationality \nthat organize their ways of doing things (this might be called the tech­\nnological aspect) and the freedom with which they act within these \npractical systems, reacting to what others do, modifying the rules of \nthe game, up to a certain point (this might be called the strategic side \nof these practices).

Do we still need them, these unan­\nswerable questions, these silences before the unknowable? \nM.F. What is philosophy if not a way of reflecting, not so much on \nwhat is true and what is false, as on our relationship to truth? People \nsometimes complain that there is no dominant philosophy in France. \nSo much the better for that! There is no sovereign philosophy, it's true, \nbut a philosophy or rather philosophy in activity. The movement by \nwhich, not without effort and uncertainty, dreams and illusions, one \ndetaches oneself from what is accepted as true and seeks other rules­\nthat is philosophy. The displacement and transformation of frameworks \nof thinking, the changing of received values and all the work that has \nbeen done to think otherwise, to do something else, to become other \nthan what one is-that, too, is philosophy. From this point of view, the \nlast thirty years or so have been a period of intense philosophical activ­\nity. The interaction between analysis, research, \"learned\" or \"theoret­\nical\" criticism, and changes in behavior, in people's real conduct, their \nway of being, their relation to themselves and to others has been con­\nstant and considerable. \nI was saying just now that philosophy was a way of reflecting on our \nrelationship to truth. It should also be added that it is a way of inter­\nrogating ourselves: If this is the relationship that we have with truth, \nhow must we behave? I believe that a considerable and varied amount \nof work has been done and is still being done that alters both our rela­\ntion to truth and our way of behaving. And this has taken place in a \ncomplex situation, between a whole series of investigations and a whole \nset of social movements. It's the very life of philosophy. \nIt is understandable that some people should weep over the present \nvoid and hanker instead, in the world of ideas, after a little monarchy. \nBut those who, for once in their lives, have found a new tone, a new \nway of looking, a new way of doing, those people, I believe, will never \nfeel the need to lament that the world is error, that history is filled with"
