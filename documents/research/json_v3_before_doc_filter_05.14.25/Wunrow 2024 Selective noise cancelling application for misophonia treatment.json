Research into treatment for misophonia is limited, primarily consisting of case studies applying common methods of therapy.

To apply audiological treatment to misophonia, selective noise cancelling must be used to control specific trigger sounds. In this research, a basic selective noise cancelling algorithm was developed using a convolutional neural network and was evaluated using a survey.

The misophonic reactions to selectively cancelled sounds were significantly less than to trigger sounds. This shows that selective noise cancelling could be used to apply audiological treatments to misophonia.",

      "text": "1 CHAPTER I  \nCOMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW OF TREATMENTS AVAILABILE  \nFOR MISOPHONIA  \n1.1 Introduction  \nMisophonia is a disorder that has generally been characterized by decreased tolerance and \nextreme reactions to specific stimuli, normally specific sounds or their associated stimuli  (Brout \net al., 2018; Cavanna & Seri, 2015; Edelstein et al., 2013; Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; \nM. M. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2002; Potgieter et al., 2019; Yilmaz & Hocaoglu, 2021) . The most \ncommon reported “trigger sounds” that cause these reactions  include eating -related sounds such \nas chewing and crunching, repetitive sounds such as clicking, picking, and tapping, and other \nmouth and nose sounds like breathing, sniffing and coughing, drinking, and swallowing \n(Cecilione et al., 2022; Dover & McGuire, 2021; T. H. Dozier, 2015c; Karalis et al., 2022; \nRosenthal et al., 2021; Schneider & Arch, 2017) . In addition to auditory triggers, those with \nmisophonia can also experience similar reactions to visual stimuli – jaw movement, repetitive \nmotions, leg swinging, and hair twirling  – that may or may not be related to auditory triggers \n(Cavanna & Seri, 2015; Edelstein et al., 2013; A. Schröder et al., 2013) . The reactions to these \ntriggers can range from disgust to rage to loss of control to severe anxiety and  are generally \ndirected toward the source of the trigger. In 2022, Swedo et al.  employed the Delphi method to \ndevelop an official consensus definition for misophonia."

      "text": "2 “Misophonia is a disorder of decreased tolerance to specific sounds or stimuli… that tend \nto evoke strong negative emotional, physiological, and behavioral responses that are not seen in \nmost other people. Misophonic responses do not seem to be elicited  by the loudness of auditory \nstimuli, but rather by the specific pattern or meaning to an individual... who may have difficulty \ndistracting themselves from the stimulus and may experience suffering, distress, and/or \nimpairment in social, occupational, and academic functioning.” (Swedo et al., 2022b)  \nMisophonia is often discussed in conjunction with similar auditory -based disorders like \ntinnitus and hyperacusis under the umbrella of decreased sound tolerance (Aazh et al., 2019; \nHenry et al., 2022; M. M. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2002; P. J. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014; P. \nJastreboff & Jastreboff, 2015; Meltzer & Herzfeld, 2014; Raj -Koziak et al., 2021) . Chronic \ntinnitus is often defined as an auditory perception that has no physical acoustic source, leading to \nphysiological problems such as discomfort, anxiety, or stress (Bhatt et al., 2017; Czornik et al., \n2022; Stobik et al., 2005) . Hyperacusis can be defined as the perception of everyday sounds as \nunusually or overwhelmingly loud or intense (Auerbach et al., 2014; Baguley, 2003) , also \ndefined as unusually high auditory gain (Henry, 2022) . These disorders are different, but they \nshare many  similar characteristics, such as an abnormal sensitivity to auditory stimuli, unusual \nand extreme reactions to auditory stimuli, and drastic impact of the lives of people with these \ndisorders.  \nTreatments for these other auditory disorders are well researched and draw tools from a \nvariety of fields , including psychology , audiology , engineering , and  physiology. Traditional \ntherapies like cognitive behavioral  therapy (CBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), \nand tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) have been successfully used  to reduce long term disability \nof both hyperacusis and tinnitus (Czornik et al., 2022; Fackrell et al., 2017; Henry, 2022; Holmes"

Clinicians and \nresearchers have used auditory methods like hearing aids and sound masking with noise \ngenerators to reduce the short -term affect of these conditions and aid in long -term treatment \nplans (Fackrell et al., 2017; Henry, 2022; Holmes & Padgham, 2011; Kalle et al., 2018; \nSearchfield et al., 2017) . Some investigation has also been made into pharmacological treatments \n(Czornik et al., 2022; Fackrell et al., 2017; Holmes & Padgham, 2011) , surgery (Czornik et al., \n2022; Fackrell et al., 2017; Searchfield et al., 2017) , and alternative medicine such as  \nacupuncture and ginkgo biloba (Holmes & Padgham, 2011) . Researchers have demonstrated  \neffectiveness when  using multimodal approaches to treating disorders like hyperacusis and \ntinnitus , such as combining elements of CBT and more sound based therapies  (Baguley & Hoare, \n2018; F Cima et al., 2012; Nolan et al., 2020) . More comprehensive reviews of the available and \nresearched treatments for these disorders are available.  \nResearch into misophonia is relatively new and the condition itself has not been officially \nclassified as a psychological disorder (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; M. M. Jastreboff & \nJastreboff, 2002; Yilmaz & Hocaoglu, 2021) . Research into treatments is experimental, focused \nprimarily on a few select  types of treatment, and generally tested in small samples or single case \nstudies. The goal of this review  is two-fold: first, to comprehensively determine the current state \nof research into treatments for misophonia ; and second,  to identify areas of future research into \ntreatments for misophonia.  \n1.1.1 Contributions  \n• First comprehensive literature review focusing specifically on the researched \ntreatments of misophonia  \n• Identified lack of standardized model for understanding mechanics of misophonia"

The 2022 review by  Ferrer -Torres and Gim énez-Llort , as the most recent ly published \nreview on misophonia literature at the time, served as both an outline for the categorization of \ntreatments and as a sanity check to ensure that the literature review was of sufficient scope. \nEligibility criteria were established, the databases  and search strategy for each source was \ndefined, and the selection and collection processes were conducted  according to the defined \ncriteria. Finally, the information was collected and aggregated into categories based on treatment \ntypes.  \n1.2.1 Eligibility Criteria  \nRecords were immediately excluded if they were not peer -reviewed, not in English, or \ndid not make any mention of misophonia.

The reviewers \nalso captured a summary of the treatment(s) described in the record, the outcomes and \neffectiveness of the treatment(s ), notes on particularly interesting sections or sentences, and any \nmention of technology in relation to the treatment of misophonia. After the individual review, the \nresearchers discussed their conclusions and found that a consensus  existed on the data extracted \nfrom the records.

Meltzer and Herzfeld \n(2014) developed a toolbox of potential  treatments designed specifically for audiologists; this \ntoolbox focused on tinnitus but could be applied to hyperacusis and misophonia. Most \nimportantly, Smith et al. (2022) investigated the perception of individuals with misophonia \ntowards various treatm ents, including medication, lifestyle modifications, relaxation techniques, \npsychological treatment, audiologic treatments, and neuromodulation. Smith’s study  provided a \nframework for understand ing what the current categories of treatment were for this current \nresearch .  \n1.4.1 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  \nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is one of the most studied behavior therapies to \ndate. CBT focuses on negative mental patterns that lead to emotional distress and undesired \nbehaviors (Hofmann et al., 2012) . CBT is also the most researched treatment for Misophonia and \nthe only treatment to have clinical trials performed. In general, the case studies and trials using \nCBT have proven effective in reducing misophonic symptoms (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, \n2022; Potgieter et al., 2019; Yilmaz & Hocaoglu, 2021)  and papers discussing possible"

In each of these case studies, a patient visited a clinician with misophonic symptoms, \nsometimes comorbid with OCD -like symptoms or other disorders. The authors conducted a \nseries of CBT sessions with the patient, focusing on the mindset behind the react ions to triggers \nand the cognitive processes that were related to the negative emotions. In a few cases, the authors \nalso attempted exposure and response prevention (ERP), which only showed success in \ncombination with CBT treatment (Cecilione et al., 2022; Dover & McGuire, 2021; Reid et al., \n2016; Roushani & Mehrabizadeh Honarmand, 2021) . Specifically worth noting is a comment \nmade by Cecilione et al. : exposures must be performed in combination with the correct \natmosphere, support, and relaxation and mental processes to be effective. In each case study, the \nauthors measured the severity of the patient’s Misophonia, normally using AMISOS  and \ncomplementary scales . From the measurements, they  saw a decrease in the severity of \nMisophonia, ranging from somewhat improved to almost complete reduction. At the end of each \ncase study, as is common, the authors noted the necessity for more controlled trials to validate \nthe effectiveness of this treatm ent. I. Jager et al. (2022)  do describe a treatment protocol for \ngroup CBT to treat  Misophonia. However, they were only able to test the protocol on a single \nindividual, with results similar to the other case studies. Lewin et al. (2021)  also give an outline \nfor potential  treatment protocols, with some success in phase 1 pilot trials."

(2017)  published the first true study of CBT treatment for patients \nwith misophonia, pulling from patients referred to the University of Amsterdam’s Academic \nMedical Center (AMC). While the study had some limitations and was not a randomized \ncontrolled trial (RC T), it still showed that CBT was effective in treating the symptoms of \nmisophonia for around half of the patients. In 2021, the AMC published the first RCT using CBT \nto treat misophonia. Using a highly controlled treatment protocol, a control group on a tr eatment \nwaiting list, and multiple measures including a 1 -year follow -up, the authors showed a clinical \nimprovement in almost three quarters of the treated patients. Also in 2021, Roushani & \nMehrabizadeh Honarmand (2021)  used CBT on three randomly selected female students at \nShahid Chamran University in Iran. The authors specifically focused on the effect of treatment \non anger as a symptom . The study showed substantial improvement  in two students and small \nimprovement in a third student using the Novaco Anger Scale. To varying degrees, these three \ntrials confirm the conclusions of the published case studies ; CBT is helpful in reducing the \nimpacts of misophonia.  \n1.4.2 Acceptance and Commitment Therapy  \nAcceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is part of the third wave of behavior therapy \ntreatments and  focuses  more on the individual’s relationship to psychological events while \napplying an understanding of the mechanics of the events and their context (Hayes et al., 2006) . \nACT targets six core processes to allow the individual to build a healthier  relationship with \nthemselves and their circumstances: acceptance, cognitive defusion, contact with the present, self \nas context, values, and committed action (a more detailed description of ACT can be found in"

Two reports found in the literature review discussed case studies using ACT \nin patient treatment.  \nPetersen and Twohig (2022)  applied ACT with principles from dialectical behavior \ntherapy (DBT) to the treatment of the misophonia of a 12 -year-old female (pseudonym “Kelly” \nin the report). In the treatment, Kelly attended sixteen  weekly, 50 -minute sessions, each focusing \non aspects of her experience and introducing ACT principles to be applied in her daily life. The \nfirst sessions focused on basic education and mindfulness; the treatment then moved to engaging \nin more understandin g with the condition and separating  Kelly from her mi sophonia without \nsuppressing or denying it; the final sessions introduced specific activities to engage with herself \nand others with compassion and empathy. The authors used the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale \n(AMISOS) (A. Schröder et al., 2013)  to provide a baseline score for Kelly’s misophonia and \nmeasure improvement over time. Kelly’s AMISOS scores decreased  over the treatment period. \nThis, along with testaments from the patient and her mother, suggests  that ACT was successful \nin reducing the symptoms of misophonia and increasing the ability to tolerate the condition. This \nstudy was the first use of ACT to treat  misophonia in a child and therefore while it is useful in \nshowing the value of ACT in a case study, it does not provide a systematic or controlled \nexperiment for this treatment. The authors also note that controlled exposure was not used but  \ncould have shown positive results. In addition, they suggest that while earplugs or headphones \ncan have har mful audiological effects and lead to avoidance  behavior , they can also be useful in \nspecific situations. Finally, the authors stress that research concerning treatment and diagnosis of \nmisophonia is limited and so any treatment must be presented with full transparency.  \nSchneider and Arch (2017)  used ACT to treat a 17 -year-old male, pseudonym “Michael”. \nIn the treatment, Michael attended 10 50 -minute sessions following a similar procedure as the"

The authors again used the AMISOS scale, and \nMichael’s responses show a decrease over the sessions and into the 6 -month follo w-up. It is \nworth nothing that Michael reported subthreshold symptoms of obsessive -compulsive  disorder \n(OCD), which shares with misophonia unwanted thoughts and compulsive behaviors and is a \ncommon candidate for ACT use. The authors specifically state that  because misophonia is not \nwell studied they did not apply a strict curriculum for ACT or DBT but  pulled principles from \nboth treatments based on the situation. The authors also experimented with physical relaxation in \nresponse to triggers, which has been studied in multiple case reports (T. Dozier, 2022; T. H. \nDozier, 2015b, 2015c) .  \nBoth these case studies provide evidence for the effectiveness of ACT and DBT in the \ntreatment of misophonia. The focus on accepting situations, separating from the symptoms \nwithout suppressing them, and more active engagement with the symptoms and situati ons gave \nthe patients tools to actively address their misophonia and triggering situations instead of \ndefaulting to the inflexible routine of anger or anxiety in response to trigger sounds. A larger, \ncontrolled, and systematic study is needed to validate t he effectiveness of ACT in treating \nmisophonia. Schneider and Arch  (2015 ) suggest that because misophonia involves emotional \nresponses that are harder to habituate through exposure, these methods of acceptance and \nengagement with misophonia may be particularly effective.  \n1.4.3 Counterconditioning and Neural Repatterning Technique  \nThe counterconditioning technique, often also referred to as the neural repatterning \ntechnique (NRT) by papers, is built on the five -phase model of Misophonia developed by Dozier \nand Mitchell (2022) .

There are other phases to this \nmodel of Misophonia, but the physical reflex is the primary concern of the counterconditioning \ntreatment.  \nIn Dozier’s method of counterconditioning, the patient is exposed to a mild form of a \nknown trigger , which will cause the physical reflex. At the same time, the patient is exposed to a \ncounterconditioning stimulus, often music, which  should elicit a positive response. This \ncombination allows the patient to focus on relaxing their physical reflex without experiencing  the \nemotional response to the trigger. Over time, the physical reflex can be controlled and reduced, \nwhich reduces the emotional response and t he rest of the phases in the five -phase model. (T.

Follow -ups 6 and 12 months after \ntreatment showed that her response to the treated triggers remained low, but the response to non-\ntreated triggers remained or grew stronger. The author notes that the NRT treatment did not \neliminate the trigger response, but merely  lessened it; he therefore suggests that NRT could be \nused in conjunction with other therapies like CBT to better treat a patient. In the discussion \nsection, the author mentions another patient who used white noise and open ear headphones to \nreduce her responses to triggers based on  the MAQ , showing the same results with simple white \nnoise that the complex counterconditioning treatment showed . This reinforces that while the \ntreatment in this case worked, the measurements used are not validated.  \nThe second case study in 2015 focused on a 48-year-old female ( pseudonym  Sarah), \nwhose most extreme triggers were caused by her husband. Again, the self -reported MAQ was the \nprimary assessment tool to measure success of treatment.

The author notes \nthat while the assessment scores provide empirical support for thi s treatment, they do not prove \ngeneralized effectiveness; in addition, the response severity could also have been produced by \navoiding triggering situations and implementing other coping techniques that occurred in tandem \nto counterconditioning treatment.  \nThe final case study was published in 2022 and covers the treatment of a 47-year-old \nfemale (pseudonym Olivia), diagnosed with bipolar II and self -reporting Misophonia (T. Dozier, \n2022) . Her Misophonia and other conditions were extreme enough to lead to consistent \nwithdrawal and avoidance, spending about 95% of her time alone. The MAQ was used \nthroughout the course of treatment to measure progress, and the AMISOS was used prior to \ntreatm ent and concluding treatment to provide a validated measure of treatment success. Over 13 \nweeks, the counterconditioning treatment was taught and applied, beginning by identifying \nphysical reflexes to triggers, then using PMR to relax the reflex with recor ded triggers in \ncombination with positive stimuli.

Each of the \nreports is briefly described below.  \nThe first miscellaneous report used conventional behavioral treatment on a patient with \nmisophonia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The authors used behavioral therapy instead of \nCBT because of the lack of strong verbal communicative skills in the patie nt that are necessary \nfor the application of CBT. Using an ABA -based treatment showed success in reducing the \nsound -based problem behaviors in the patient. The authors do note that their research is difficult \nto generalize, a common problem in treatment of  individuals with ASD.  \nCowan et al. (2022)  introduced a model for misophonia building on the Pavlo vian \nconditioning theory developed by M. M. Jastreboff & Jastreboff (2002) . The authors point out \nthat the Jastreboff  model does not account for the initial unconditioned response that leads to \nanger as a conditioned response to specific sounds. In response, the authors suggest that rigidity \ntoward a specific sound made by a specific person could start the cycle of incre ased awareness to \nsounds, distress from sounds, and expanding triggers in new situations. Based on this model, \nthey introduce a theoretical treatment framework termed experiential acceptance and stimulus \nengagement (EASE).

(2022):  \n“Misophonia is a disorder of decreased tolerance to specific sounds or stimuli… that tend \nto evoke strong negative emotional, physiological , and behavioral responses that are not seen in \nmost other people. Misophonic responses do not seem to be elicited by the loudness of auditory \nstimuli, but rather by the specific pattern or meaning to an individual... who may have difficulty \ndistracting th emselves from the stimulus and may experience suffering, distress, and/or \nimpairment in social, occupational, and aca demic functioning.” (Swedo et al., 2022b)  \n \nFigure 2.1  Simplified visualization of the mechanics of Misophonia ."

      "text": "24 The specific point of the definition is that the strong negative reactions occur in the \npresence of specific  stimuli; that is, a stranger on the street eating noisily may not have the same \neffect as a close family member eating in the same manner. The most common specific stimuli, \nor “triggers”, include eating -related sounds such as chewing and crunching, repetitive sounds \nsuch as clicking, picking, and tapping, and other mouth and nose sounds like breathing, sniffing \nand coughing, drinking, and swallowing (Cecilione et al., 2022; Dover & McGuire, 2021; T. H. \nDozier, 2015c; Karalis et al., 2022; Rosenthal et al., 2021; Schneider & Arch, 2017) . Other non -\nauditory triggers can be developed as well, such as jaw movement, leg swinging, and repetitive \nmotions that may or may not be linked to auditory triggers (Cavanna & Seri, 2015; Edelstein et \nal., 2013; A. Schröder et al., 2013) .  \nAnecdotal reports show that the strong negative emotional, physiological, and behavioral \nresponses often include outbursts of anger, extreme panic attacks, self -isolation, and in some \ncases self -harm behaviors. Those suffering from misophonia express feeli ngs of intense, \nuncontrollable rage which can then lead to guilt, especially if the anger is directed towards a \nloved one. Others mention panic attacks so severe that radical self -isolation seems to be the only \nresponse. Most people with misophonia have id entified significant detriment to their \nrelationships, work lives, and mental and emotional health .  \n2.1.2 Current  State of Research  \nAs the date of the official definition suggests, research into this condition is limited and \nrecent. Estimates of the pervasiveness of misophonia suggest that somewhere around 5% or 6 % \nof the population suffers from misophonia severe enough to inhibit their daily lives  (Jakubovski \net al., 2022; X. Zhou et al., 2017) . This is similar to  the prevalence of tinnitus, a well -researched \nauditory disorder with somewhere between 5% and 10% of the population showing tinnitus"

However, \ndespite the prevalence of misophonia, the research conducted specifically concerning the \ntreatment of misophonia consists primarily of psychiatric case studies  (Cavanna & Seri, 2015; \nFerrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Potgieter et al., 2019; Yilmaz & Hocaoglu, 2021) , with a \nfew large studies using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)  (I. J. Jager et al., 2021; Roushani & \nMehrabizadeh Honarmand, 2021; A. E. Schröder et al., 2017) . This dearth of research into \ntreatments for misophonia is unacceptable given the prevalence  of the condition.  \nThe initial research into misophonia compared it to other sensory conditions, specifically \ntinnitus and hyperacusis  (Aazh et al., 2019; Henry et al., 2022; M. M. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, \n2002; P. J. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014; P. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2015; Meltzer & Herzfeld, \n2014; Raj -Koziak et al., 2021) . Both these conditions have decades of research into possible \ntreatments, ranging from psychiatric to pharmacological to physical sound masking and hearing \naids to alternative medicines and surgeries  (Auerbach et al., 2014; Baguley, 2003; Baguley & \nHoare, 2018; Bhatt et al., 2017; Czornik et al., 2022; F Cima et al., 2012; Fackrell et al., 2017; \nHenry, 2022; Holmes & Padgham, 2011; Kalle et al., 2018; Michiels et al., 2016; Nolan et al., \n2020; Searchfi eld et al., 2017; Stobik et al., 2005; Zachriat & Kröner -Herwig, 2004) . Because \nthe symptoms and triggers for these conditions are similar to misophonia, Jastreboff and \nJastreboff (2014) suggest that tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) could be applied to hyperacusis, \nmisophonia, and similar conditions with decreased sound tolerance.  From their example , future \nresearch into misophonia could  be concentrated on these already validated methods of treatment \nto evaluate  their effectiveness with misophonia treatment."

The Jastreboffs and others suggest that using noise cancelling or masking in a \nstructured manner with psychiatric treatments could be beneficial for misophonia as it is for \ntinnitus and hyperacusis  (Bernstein et al., 2013; T. H. Dozier, 2015a; Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -\nLlort, 2022; I. Jager et al., 2022; P. J. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014; Petersen & Twohig, 2022; \nSmith et al., 2022) . In this type of treatment (hereafter termed audiological treatment), \nspecifically designed noise cancelling or masking is used to slowly introduce sounds to the \npatient with therapy sessions, with full control over the sounds in the hands of the clinician or \npatient. The objective is to give the patient the tools to manage  the sounds in a controlled \nenvironment, so as they experience sounds in an uncontrolled environment,  they are able to cope \nproperly. Figure 2.2  shows how the applications for this type of treatment with tinnitus and \nhyperacusis can reveal a potential application for misophonia.  \n \nFigure 2.2  Potential  application of audiological treatment for misophonia using specific \ncontrol of types of sounds ."

Hyperacusis treatment uses noise cancelling or noise masking \nwith adjustable volumes to control the loudness of sounds. Because misopho nia deals with \nspecific types of sounds (as seen in the definition and examples), the type of noise cancelling or \nmasking needed for misophonia treatment is selective noise cancelling, where the volume of \nspecific noises can be controlled. This will allow control over when trigger sounds are \nexperienced and how extreme they are, which will give clinicians the opportunity to teach proper \ncoping mechanisms to patients in a controlled environment and allow patients to practice those \ncoping mechanisms with cont rol over their environments .  \n2.1.3 Problem  Statement  \nThe aim of this research is to investigate the potential of using selective noise cancelling \nin a similar setting to the audiological treatments mentioned above . The hypothesis is that audio \nclips with trigger sounds cancelled using selective noise cancelling will elicit a lower misophonic \nresponse from a person with misophonia than a trigger sound without selective noise cancelling. \nValidating this hypothesis will allow for further investigation into using selective noise \ncancelling with forms of audiologi cal treatment for a more holistic approach to misophonia \ntreatment.  \n2.1.4 Contributions  \n• Developed convolutional neural network capable of identifying trigger sounds in \naudio  \n• Validated the potential of using selective noise cancelling to apply a form of \ntinnitus retraining therapy to misophonia"

The remaining valid responses were cleaned \naccording to the processes in Section 2.3.5 . Eight participants rated one or more of the cont rol \nsounds as triggers, and 17 participants rated one or more of the trigger sounds as a control sound; \nthese responses were removed from the data. After the initial data validation and cleaning, there \nwere 89 valid responses to the survey .  \nParticipants were predominately female (6 3 female, 19 male, 5 non-binary / third gender, \n2 prefer not to say)  and between 18 and 77 years old  (39.2 ± 15.5). The average age of onset was \n12.7 ± 8.8  years  old, and the average length of time having misophonia at the point the survey \nwas taken was 26.5 ± 15.9 years . Out of the 89 participants, 36 selected that they were currently \nreceiving or had received treatment ( therapy = 2 4, counseling = 14, audiological treatment = 8, \npharmacological treatment = 7, other = 10); Table 2.4 . The self -rating on the Misophonia \nActivation Scale revealed that almost all of the participants had a misophonia rating of at least 4 \n(6.4 ± 1.9). Figure 2.11  shows the misophonia severity, age of onset, and age of the participants. \nA few participants reported the age of onset as below 5; these responses were not removed \nbecause there is support for infants and toddlers exhibiting misophonic symptoms (Sanchez & \nSilva, 2018; Siepsiak et al., 2023)."

H. Dozier, 2015a; Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; \nI. Jager et al., 2022; P. J. Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014; Petersen & Twohig, 2022; Smith et al., \n2022) . The results in Figure 2.12  and Table 2.6  show that in the data collected, trigger sounds are \nrated significantly higher (eliciting a more extreme reaction) than control sounds, which \nvalidates the measure being used in the study (Swedo et al., 2022) ."

      "text": "51 In addition, the results in  Figure 2.12  and Table 2.6  show that trigger sounds that have \nbeen modified using selective noise cancelling elicit a significantly lower misophonia response \nthan trigger sounds that have not been selectively noise cancelled. This means that selective \nnoise cancelling is effective for lowering the misophonic reaction to trigger sounds; or in other \nwords, removing the trigger sound with selective noise cancelling removes the reaction to the \nsound, as  the Jastreboffs and others have suggested.  \n2.5.2 Further Analyses  \n2.5.2.1  Data Cleaning and Processing  \nAs expected, some participants responded that sounds classified as trigger sounds in the \nstudy did not trigger them and that some control sounds did trigger them. This is because triggers \nare unique for each individual and cannot be fully generalized for a population of this size. The \nreactions from those specific participants for those sounds were removed.  This removal of data \ndid not affect the  outcome of the study because for each sound there were still more responses \nthan the required amount.  \nFurther investigation into the reaction rating data revealed outliers, both extremely low \nresponses for trigger sounds and extremely high responses for control and cancelled sounds. \nFigure 2.14 a visually shows the amount of outliers for each category , where the width of the \nviolin plot  indicates the number of data points at that reaction rating. Figure 2.14 b shows the \nactual responses of an individual participant  as an example ; the first trigger sound has three \nresponses that are high, as expected, and then a fourth response that is close to zero but not zero.  \nThe most likely explanation for these outliers is that triggers are highly unique  and often people \nwith misophonia will be triggered by specific instances of a type of sound and not other \ninstances; to reference the definition of misophonia, it is the specific pattern of sound that is"

Further exploration in Section 2.4.2.3  \ndemonstrated that , while selective noise cancelling significantly lowered the reactions to all \ntrigger sounds tested, chewing and crunching were more affected than pen clicking and sniffing. \nThis is primarily because pen clicking and sniffing are less common or less severe triggers than \nchewing and crunching (Claiborn et al., 2020; Swedo et al., 2022) . \n2.5.2.3  Impact of Demographics  \nNone of the demographics had a  significant effect on the results, showing that selective \nnoise cancelling is effective regardless of variables like age, severity of misophonia, and gender ."

A preliminary question asking if the participant was in a quiet room with \nearbuds was used in an attempt to mitigate this issue. However, differences in types of earbuds or \nheadphones, volume of the device, environmental sound, and other factors could have introduced \nconfounding factors  that affected the results, especially with the demographic findings.  \nIn addition, while the captured demographics showed no significant effect on the results, \nother demographics that were not captured, like nationality, could affect  the results of the study.  \nAnother limitation was the recruitment process. Most larger studies screen participants \nwho have comorbid disorders (I. J. Jager et al., 2021; A. E. Schröder et al., 2017) , while the \nscreening in this study was limited to requiring the participant to be over 18 and be self -\ndiagnosed or professionally diagnosed with misophonia.

The effectiveness of selective noise \ncancelling on the misophonic reaction to other types of trigger sounds , especially less common \nor less severe trigger sounds,  remains an unknown .  \n2.5.4 Future Research  \nBecause of these limitations, more research should be performed with more controlled \nenvironments, stricter screening, and a broader range of trigger sounds. This will strengthen the \nconclusions drawn from this first step in the research. Experts in misophonia treatment , \nespecially those who have performed large studies,  could be consulted on how to improve the \ntesting process and environment to reduce the limitations of this study. Additional measures, \nsuch as physiological metrics or brain scans, could al so be used to measure the severity of the \nmisophonic reaction to sounds more accurately . \nThis survey design could also be applied in other ways. It could be used as a more \nverifiable method of identifying people with misophonia, as opposed to a questionnaire where \nthe patient must recall their perceptions of their reactions to sounds. Ideally the patient would be \nremoved entirely from the process of diagnosing misophonia, but using this survey would still \nget closer to the actual reactions of the patient as opposed to their perceptions. Alternatively, the \nsurvey could be used to investigate and assess potential treatme nts in an A -B style study where \nthe participant takes the survey before and after applying treatment and the effects of the \ntreatment can be measured more empirically than a self -reporting questionnaire."

      "text": "56 In addition, the neural network design could be refined. More testing should be \nperformed with the parameters of spectrogram generation, dataset creation, and length of audio \nclips. Experimentation with fuzzy logic to allow users to customize the aggressiv eness of the \nnetwork would further validate the intended use case. Further investigation into the more \ncomplex architectures detailed in Section 2.2.1  is also needed.  \nFinally, development and testing of a near real -time algorithm would allow for more \ntesting in the intended environment. This research was conducted using an offline algorithm that \nanalyzed and selectively cancelled sounds prior to the participant listening to them. Because of \nthe design of the selective noise cancelling, real -time performance is impossible with current \ntechnology; however,  near real -time performance could likely be achieved with a latency of less \nthan a quarter second. This could potential ly be applied in treatment settings and everyday use . \nFor instance, one of the main difficulties  with current treatment of misophonia is a patient \nanticipating a trigger sound and therefore experiencing the trigger whether they can actually hear \nit or not. Using a near real -time version of selective noise cancelling could allow a clinician to \nexpose the patient to a video of someone performing a trigger and use the selective noise \ncancelling to remove the trigger sounds, allowing the patient to reduce their  anticipatory \nreactions over time. Another application could be for video or audio streaming, where the output \ncan be lagged slightly to match the latency of the selective noise cancelling system.  \n2.6 Conclusions  \nThe current research into misophonia treatment is limited and primarily comprised of \ncase studies and proposed treatments applying therapy techniques often used for anxiety and \nbehavioral disorders. However, research into treatments for similar sensory disorders such as \ntinnitus and hyperacusis shows  that a holistic approach, utilizing audiological treatments and"

The purpose of this research was to \ninvestigate the feasibility of using selective noise cancelling to control and reduce the \nmisophonic reactions to trigger noises  as a first step in applying audiological treatments to \nmisophonia.  \nA basic prototype of selective noise cancelling was designed and applied to four types of \ntrigger sounds. The effectiveness of the selective noise cancelling was evaluated  in an online \nsurvey with 89 participants. The participants self -rated their reactions to the cancelled trigger \nsounds , un-cancelled trigger sounds , and non -trigger sounds to function as  a control group.  \nThe results showed that trigger sounds  that had been selectively noise cancelled elicited a \nsignificantly lower misophonic reaction than trigger sounds  that were not selectively cancelled. \nThis means that selective noise cancelling can be applied to triggers to control misophonic \nreactions , allowing clinicians and patients to apply the audiological methods of treatment that are \nalready validated  for tinnitus and hyperacusis.  \nFuture research should investigate the effectiveness of selective noise cancelling on more \ntypes of trigger sounds in a more controlled environment , as well as more robust and real -time \ndesigns for the selective noise cancelling."
