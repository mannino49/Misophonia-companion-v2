When anticipating or perceiving so-called \n“trigger” sounds or stimuli (e.g., eating or mouth sounds), \nindividuals with misophonia experience immediate and \nstrong physiological and emotional reactions, which are often difficult to control, along with behavioral reactions \n[1, 3–5]. Situations with potential triggers are commonly \navoided, escaped, or encountered with anticipation anxiety \n[1, 3]. Misophonia typically develops during childhood or \nearly adolescence [5 –8], and is associated with reduced qual-\nity of life and considerable educational, social and relational \nimpairment in youth [6 , 9].\nWhile consensus on the definition of misophonia was \nrecently reached by an international interdisciplinary group \nof experts through a Delphi-method [2 ], consensus regard-\ning diagnostic criteria for misophonia is still lacking. As a \ndisorder of decreased sound tolerance, misophonia might \nbe understood in the context of audiology (by contrasting \nits features with audiological disorders such as hyperacusis \nand tinnitus; [10– 13]); and/or psychiatry (by contrasting its \nfeatures with psychiatric disorders; [8 , 14]). The absence of \nunified diagnostic guidelines complicates the research into \netiology, assessment tools and treatment of misophonia, \nessentially leading to a vicious cycle.\nAs a first step in addressing this problem, several research \ngroups have proposed diagnostic criteria for misophonia [1 , \n14–16]. The Amsterdam UMC misophonia research group Nienke C. C. Vulink, Elisabeth M. W. J. Utens are shared last \nauthorship.\n * Lotte R. Rappoldt \n l.r.rappoldt@amsterdamumc.nl\n * Nienke C. C.

      "text": "Child Psychiatry & Human Development\nwas the first to propose diagnostic criteria for misophonia \nas a psychiatric disorder [ 14], and published revised criteria \nin 2020 after a follow-up study of 575 adult patients with \nmisophonia (full criteria in [1 ]). These Amsterdam UMC \n2013/2020 criteria have been criticized for being too restric-\ntive (e.g., children might not recognize that their feelings are \nexcessive; [8 , 16]), and for their assumption of psychiatric \netiology and the absence of differentiation from hyperacusis, \nwhich according to Jastreboff and Jastreboff [13] might lead \nto biased samples of patients with misophonia. While it is \nimportant to consider these and other criticisms in the ongo-\ning field of misophonia research, the proposed Amsterdam \nUMC 2020 criteria largely reflect the consensus definition \nof misophonia [2 ] and form an important starting point for \nharmonization and comparison of future international miso-\nphonia studies [17]. For instance, in the current absence of \nunified diagnostic guidelines, the Amsterdam UMC 2020 \ncriteria might serve as a basis for development of question-\nnaires, which allows for a more straightforward and cross-\ncultural comparison between different misophonia studies.\nExisting Questionnaires Measuring Misophonia \nin Adults\nBased on the Amsterdam UMC criteria, the Amsterdam \nresearch team developed two questionnaires to assess sever -\nity of misophonia in adults: the Amsterdam Misophonia \nScale (A-MISO-S; [14]), an adaptation of the Yale-Brown \nObsessive–Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) [18, 19], and its \nrevised version the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale—Revised \n(AMISOS-R; [1 ]). Both questionnaires are internationally \nwidely used in research and practice [4 , 20–25], although \nthey have not been validated yet by the authors. Validated \nquestionnaires for adults based on the Amsterdam UMC cri-\nteria include the Berlin Misophonia Questionnaire Revised \n(BMQ-R; [17, 26]), MisoQuest [27], and Duke-Vanderbilt \nMisophonia Screening Questionnaire (DVMSQ; [28, 29]).\nOther questionnaires for measuring misophonia in adults \nwere developed on a different basis, namely of expert and \npatient statements, literature search and/or an item pool of \nprevious questionnaires. One advantage of this procedure of \nquestionnaire development is the reflection of a variety of \npatient experiences. Examples include the New York Miso-\nphonia Scale (NYMS; [30]), Decreased Sound Tolerance \nScale (DSTS-S, to distinguish between misophonia, hyper -\nacusis and phonophobia; [31]), Sussex Misophonia Scale \n(SMS; [32]), Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ, [33]), \nand Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Scale (S-Five, \n[34, 35]).Measuring Misophonia in Youth\nUnfortunately, for children and adolescents, there is still \na lack of validated questionnaires to measure misophonia \n[6, 7, 9, 20]. In the current study, we make the distinc-\ntion between screening questionnaires, and questionnaires \nassessing misophonia severity. First, screening question-\nnaires are used for early detection of misophonia symp-\ntoms in the general population. Without adequate screen-\ning, misophonia in children might be overlooked by (para)\nmedical professionals [ 9]. Timely screening might limit \nthe risk of educational, social and relational impairment \nassociated with misophonia [6 ].\nSecond, questionnaires assessing misophonia severity  \nare important, because misophonia symptoms might vary \non a continuum ranging from mild to severe impairment \n[2]. Since misophonia is often reported to be far more \ndebilitating than mere irritation, the Amsterdam UMC cri-\nteria (2020) state that the proposed “diagnosis” of miso-\nphonia should only be provided when it leads to significant \ndistress or impairment in daily life [1 ], similar to psy -\nchiatric diagnoses stated in the Diagnostic and Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; [ 36]). Determin -\ning a cutoff point on a misophonia severity questionnaire \ncan support identification of misophonia, and reduce the \nstigma and misunderstanding many children currently \nexperience (e.g., “Everyone dislikes these sounds, get \nover it!”). Moreover, questionnaires assessing misophonia \nseverity are essential in studies investigating the effective -\nness of misophonia treatment for youth, which are now \nbeing conducted [37, 38]. Therefore, questionnaires sensi-\ntive to change in severity are needed.\nExisting Questionnaires Measuring Misophonia \nin Youth\nTo the best of our knowledge, only four questionnaires \nassessing misophonia in youth have been (preliminarily) \nevaluated: the parent-reported version of the Misophonia \nImpact Questionnaire (MIQ-P; [39]), Sussex Misophonia \nScale for Adolescents (SMS-Adolescent; [9 ]), A-MISO-S \n[14], and Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ; \n[40]).\nThe parent-reported version of the 8-item MIQ (MIQ-\nP; [39]), is developed solely for assessing the impact of \nmisophonia, by assessing the frequency of experienced \nproblems (over a 2-week period) due to hearing trigger \nsounds. The items are primarily based on patient experi -\nences. While excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s \nalpha = 0.92) was found in the study of Aazh et al. [39], \nthis outcome can only be regarded as preliminary evidence"

Importantly, questions about triggers contain the \nphrase “I hate…” (e.g., “I hate the sound of people eating”). \nWhile “miso”- “phonia” literally translates as hatred (miso-) \nof sounds (-phonia), the prefix “miso” was only used for \nnaming purposes, and might not imply that hatred is the core \ncharacteristic of misophonia [13]. Furthermore, as the SMS-\nAdolescent was validated for adolescents (aged 10–14 years) \non a small sample of 15 children with misophonia, identified \nthrough screening from the general population, and 127 chil-\ndren as controls, only preliminary evidence of its convergent \nand divergent validity for youth exists [9 ].\nThe 6-item A-MISO-S [14] (also mentioned before) was \ndeveloped to assess misophonia severity in adults. While \nnot being validated for adults by the authors themselves, \nthis questionnaire was validated by Cervin et al. [20] in a \nsample of 102 children (aged 8–17), with misophonia being \nconfirmed by the Misophonia Assessment Interview (MAI; \n[41, 42]), which is based on the Amsterdam UMC 2013 cri-\nteria and consensus definition of Swedo et al. [2 ]. Further -\nmore, the A-MISO-S was validated in general population \nsamples of high school/college students (15  + years) [ 23, \n24]. Although the A-MISO-S displayed good internal con-\nsistency and adequate convergent validity as unidimensional \nmeasure [20, 23, 24], not all items were considered develop-\nmentally sensitive for use in a youth population [ 20]. Moreo -\nver, a parallel parent-report version needed to be developed.\nLastly, the 21-item clinician-developed MAQ [40] meas-\nures misophonia symptoms on a 0–3 type Likert-scale. \nImportant advantages include the availability of parallel \nchild- and parent-reported versions, and the good to excel-\nlent internal consistency and convergent validity reported \nfor all four factors found in the validation study of Cervin \net al. [20]. However, as mentioned by Cervin et al. [20], this \nquestionnaire primarily assesses negative impact and expe-\nriences of misophonia rather than misophonia severity  per \nse. Furthermore, the questions are aimed at “sound issues”, \nwhich could also point to hyperacusis or other related condi-\ntions. In its updated version [ 43], the term “sound issues” \nis replaced with “misophonia”, however this version is not \nvalidated yet. Importantly, none of the existing measure -\nments combine instruments for explicitly the screening and \nthe assessment of misophonia severity, or specify cutoff  \ncriteria for misophonia identification in youth based on a \nReceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, \nwhich is a widely used and effective method for determin-\ning an optimal cutoff [44].The Current Study\nThe current study aims to address previous limitations by \npresenting an extensive iterative validation study of two \nnewly developed questionnaires, containing parallel child- \nand parent-reported versions: the Misophonia Screening \nList—Child and Youth, to screen for misophonia symptoms \nin the general youth population, and the Amsterdam Miso-\nphonia Scale—Youth (AMISOS-Y), to assess misophonia \nseverity in children/adolescents with misophonia symp-\ntoms identified through screening. Both questionnaires \nwere developed specifically for children and adolescents \nin a wide age range (8–18 years). The questionnaires are \nbased on the adult questionnaire AMISOS-R (a revision of \nthe A-MISO-S; [1 ]) and on the proposed Amsterdam UMC \n2020 diagnostic criteria of misophonia [1 ], largely reflect-\ning the consensus definition of misophonia [2 ]. Items were \ncritically assessed and revised for use in a youth population \nby an expert team of psychiatrists, clinical psychologists \nand behavioral therapists (N = 5; RvH, MvdP, CdW, NV, \nEU) with extensive clinical and research experience. After \nthree revision and discussion rounds by the team, fine-tuning \nof both questionnaires was completed. The questionnaires \nwere evaluated in a clinical sample of 95 children/adoles-\ncents (aged 8–18) with misophonia and their parents, and a \ngeneral population sample of 197 children/adolescents (aged \n8–18) without misophonia and their parents (N = 56) as con-\ntrol group (See: Participants).\nMethods and results are described separately for both \nquestionnaires. After instrument refinement, statistical \nanalyses included ROC curve, reliability and principal com-\nponent analyses, followed by the assessment of concurrent, \nconvergent and divergent validity. As evidence of convergent  \nvalidity, we expected to find significant moderate to large \npositive correlations between the parallel child- and parent-\nreported versions of our misophonia questionnaires [45, 46]. \nAs evidence of divergent validity, we expected to find a sig-\nnificant small to moderate positive correlation between total \nscores on our misophonia questionnaires and (for detailed \nquestionnaire information, see Methods):\n• total scores on the Dutch ADHD questionnaire (in Dutch: \nADHD-vragenlijst; AVL) [47], and Attention Prob-\nlems subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) \nand Youth Self Report (YSR) [48, 49], since previous \nresearch indicates increased rates of ADHD symptoma-\ntology in children/adolescents with misophonia [6 ],\n• the Internalizing problem scale (total and subscale \nscores) of the CBCL and YSR [48, 49], since previous \nresearch indicates a relationship between misophonia and \ninternalizing problems [6 , 7, 9, 50–53],\n• the Sensory Sensitivity subscale of the Adolescent/Adult \nSensory Profile—NL (AASP-NL) [54], considering pre-"

In a previous study of \n102 children/adolescents with misophonia, externalizing \nproblem scores remained on average in the non-clinical \nrange, and did not significantly differ from youth with \nanxiety disorders (N = 94) [6 ]. In our clinical experi-\nence, although children with misophonia might engage \nin aggressive (verbal) outbursts when triggered, other \naggressive/rule-breaking behavior is not commonly \nobserved. Therefore, we expected to find no correlation \nwith externalizing problems;\n• the CBCL/YSR Social Problems subscale [48, 49]. Previ-\nous research [7 ], combined with our clinical experience, \ndoes not provide an indication of increased social prob-\nlems in children/adolescents with misophonia.\nMaterials and Methods\nProcedures\nClinical Sample\nIncluded were children/adolescents (in short: children) who \nwere recruited during a large randomized controlled trial \n(RCT) testing the effectiveness of CBT/PMT group treat-\nment for misophonia. The inclusion/exclusion criteria and \nprocedures were therefore based on suitability for group \ntreatment. Full details can be found in a previous trial design \npaper [38].\nIn short, we included children who: (1) were aged \nbetween 8 and 18 years, (2) were referred by their general \npractitioner to our academic center for assessment and treat-\nment of misophonia before January 2023, (3) provided writ -\nten informed consent (children 12+, together with both par -\nents). Excluded were children who (1) presented primarily \nwith symptoms or a diagnosis different from misophonia \n(i.e., misophonia symptoms were not the main problem) dur -\ning screening or intake (as mentioned by the child/parent, \nor assessed during intake by trained psychologists/psychia-\ntrists); (2) displayed comorbid psychiatric symptoms that \nhindered group functioning since the RCT encompassed \ngroup treatment, or required adjustment of treatment proto-\ncol (e.g., symptoms of autism spectrum disorder; as assessed \nduring intake); (3) had received cognitive behavioral therapy \nfor misophonia in the past year; (4) displayed self-injurious behavior (i.e., auto-mutilation) at present or in the past \nyear; (5) had an estimated IQ below 85 (as assessed during \nintake); (6) were unable to read or write Dutch; (7) had seri-\nous family problems (e.g., divorcing parents), which could \nhinder adjustment to treatment protocol (since parents were \nactively involved in treatment; as assessed during intake). \nImportantly, in the exclusion criteria no cutoff scores on the \nMisophonia Screening List—Child and Youth and AMISOS-\nY were specified, considering the current validation study. \nHowever, all children included in this study, or their parents, \nexpressed serious suffering and/or impairment of daily life \nduring intake.\nAll children were first screened by a telephone call for \ninitial eligibility, and thereafter received an extensive intake \ntogether with their parents, with trained expert psychiatrists/\npsychologists at our academic center. After intake, we per -\nformed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 disor -\nders in children and adolescents (SCID-5 Junior) [56] with \nchildren and parents to serve as final check of our exclusion \ncriteria. After inclusion and randomization (for the RCT), \nchildren and their parents completed all measures used in \nthis study (see: Measures) as baseline assessment. The RCT \nwas approved by the Medical Ethics Committee AMC.\nControl Group\nIncluded were children from the general population (i.e., the \nsame group for the Misophonia Screening List—Child and \nYouth and the AMISOS-Y) who: (1) were aged between 8 \nand 18 years, (2) provided written informed consent (chil -\ndren 12+ and parents of children < 16). Exclusion criteria \nwere: (1) meeting criteria for misophonia on a clinically sig-\nnificant level (see Statistical analyses), (2) having received \ntreatment for misophonia in the past year, (3) estimated IQ \nbelow 85, (4) inability to read or write Dutch. The parents \nof the children were asked to fill in in the parent-reported \nversions of both questionnaires.\nRecruitment took place in primary and secondary (includ-\ning vocational) schools, from rural and urban regions in the \nNorth and South of the Netherlands, by trained research \ninterns (university students of Psychology and Child Devel-\nopment and Education, receiving ongoing supervision by \nthe principal investigators of this study) using standardized \ndata gathering protocols. Informed consents were either \nhanded out by teachers or by the research assistants, and \ncollected afterwards by the research assistants (or by e-mail). \nChild-reported questionnaires were assessed on paper in the \nclassroom (only for children (12+) and parents who had pro-\nvided written informed consent). Parent-reported question-\nnaires were taken home in a closed envelope and could be \nreturned to school or by e-mail. Questionnaires were marked \nwith a unique code (parallel for each child and parent cou-\nple) instead of a name, which ensured privacy protection."

Higher scores indicate a higher symptom frequency \n[47]. In the current study, the AVL total scale displayed \nexcellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.92).\nThe Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self \nReport (YSR) [48, 49] are parallel parent- and child-reported \n(11+) questionnaires assessing emotional and behavio-\nral problems in children. The questionnaires consist of a \nTotal, Internalizing (i.e., Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn/\nDepressed, Somatic Complaints) and Externalizing (i.e., \nRule-Breaking Behavior, Aggressive Behavior) prob-\nlem scale, and of the separate subscales Social Problems, \nThought Problems and Attention Problems. Higher scores \nindicate more problems. The total scales of the CBCL (Cron-\nbach’s alpha = 0.94) and YSR (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.93) dis-\nplayed excellent internal consistency.\nThe Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile—NL (AASP-NL) \n[54] assesses sensory processing, and was completed in the \ncurrent study by children aged 11 and older.2 Total quad-\nrant scores were used (quadrants: Low Registration, Sensa-\ntion Seeking, Sensory Sensitivity and Sensation Avoiding). \nHigher quadrant scores correspond to behavior more indica-\ntive of the measured construct (e.g., higher scores on the \nSensory Sensitivity quadrant indicate a stronger response \nto sensory information; [54]). Quadrant Cronbach’s alphas \nwere respectively 0.81, 0.72, 0.79, and 0.80.\nParticipants\nClinical Sample\nOur clinical sample consisted of 95 participants with miso-\nphonia aged 8–18 years old (M = 13.2 years, SD = 2.4, 76.8% \ngirls, Table  1) and their parents (N = 95; Misophonia Screen-\ning List—Child and Youth: 74.7% mothers, 21.1% fathers, \n4.2% both parents; AMISOS-Y: 76.8% mothers, 18.9% \nfathers, 4.2% both parents).

While the initial \nsample of the control group (N = 256) did not display signifi-\ncant age-related differences with the clinical group, after the \niterative process (see: Statistical analyses), our final included \ncontrol group (N = 197) consisted of significantly older chil-\ndren (M = 14.3, SD = 3.5; t (254.41) = -3.16, p = 0.002) and \nrelatively more boys (36.0%; χ2 (1) = 17.56, p < 0.001) than \nour clinical group (age: M = 13.2, SD = 2.4; boys: 23.4%).\nThe parent-reported version was completed by 56 par -\nents of controls (87.5% mothers, 10.7% fathers, 1.8% other \ncaregivers).

A subsample of 192 participants without \nmisophonia aged 8–18 years old (M = 14.3, SD = 3.5; 64.6% \ngirls) was included for validation of the child-reported ver -\nsion (Table  1). After the iterative process, our control group \nconsisted of significantly older children (M = 14.3, SD = 3.5; \nt (254.51) = − 2.89, p = 0.004) and relatively more boys \n(35.4%; χ2 (1) = 15.47, p < 001) than our clinical group (age: \nM = 13.2, SD = 2.4; boys: 23.4%).\nThe parent-reported version was completed by 55 parents \nof controls (85.5% mothers, 12.7% fathers, 1.8% caregiv -\ners).

All statistical analyses \nwere performed on the combined data (i.e., clinical sample \nand control group combined), unless explicitly mentioned \nbelow.\nMisophonia Screening List—Child and Youth (Child \nand Parent Versions)\nPhase 1: Instrument Refinement\n1. An initial reliability analysis (Cronbach’s alpha) was \nperformed for instrument refinement. Items that contributed \nnegatively to reliability (i.e., after item removal, Cronbach’s \nalpha of the total scale would be higher than its initial Cron-\nbach’s alpha) were removed from the questionnaire;\nPhase 2: Selection of Final Control Group and \nSensitivity/Specificity\n2.

The reliability analysis (Cronbach’s alpha) was \nrepeated, to assess internal consistency within the combined \nsample (with the items from step 1 and the participants from \nstep 2 removed) as well as the clinical sample only;\n4. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) with Direct \nOblimin rotation were performed to assess the factor struc-\nture of the questionnaire. Suitability of the data was assessed \nby inspection of the correlation matrix (coefficients > 0.30), \nthe Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) value (≥ 0.60) [58, 59], and \nBartlett’s test of sphericity (p < 0.05) [60]. The number of \nfactors was not predetermined and was extracted based on \nKaiser’s criterion (eigenvalues ≥ 1) [61], Cattell’s screetest \n[62], and Horn’s parallel analysis [63].\n5. The concurrent validity (a type of criterion validity) \nwas determined by assessing the point-biserial correlation \nbetween total scores on the misophonia questionnaires and \nthe criterion of misophonia “diagnosis” (0 = participants \nwith misophonia; 1 controls).\n6. The convergent and divergent (discriminant) validity \nwere determined by assessing the correlation between the \nparallel child- and parent-reported versions of our miso-\nphonia questionnaires (convergent validity), and between \ntotal scores on the misophonia questionnaires and scores \non the following questionnaires (divergent validity; only \navailable of the clinical sample, hypotheses described in \nmore detail in Introduction): Dutch ADHD questionnaire \n(in Dutch: ADHD-vragenlijst; AVL) [47] (total and subscale \nscores); CBCL and YSR [48] (total and subscale scores); \nand AASP-NL [54] (quadrant scores). Since the outcome of a questionnaire is influenced by the informant (e.g., par -\nent or child), and outcomes of questionnaires filled in by \nparents might inherently differ from questionnaires filled in \nby children [ 45, 46] for the scope of this paper we only com -\npared the parent-reported misophonia questionnaires with \nthe parent-reported AVL and CBCL, and the child-reported \nmisophonia questionnaires with the child-reported YSR and \nAASP-NL. If underlying assumptions (with regards to outli-\ners, normality and equality of variances) were violated, we \nreported Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients (according \nto Mukaka: [64]). Strength of the correlation was interpreted \nusing Cohen’s guidelines (small r = 0.10-0.29; moderate \nr = 0.30-0.49; large r = 0.50–1.0) [65].\nAMISOS‑Y (Child and Parent Versions)\nFor validation of the AMISOS-Y, we followed the same \nphases and steps as for the validation of the Misophonia \nScreening List—Child and Youth (see: above), with two \nexceptions. First, there was no phase 2 (selection of final \ncontrol group). The control group of the AMISOS-Y con-\nsisted of a subsample of participants scoring below the cut-\noff for clinically significant misophonia on the Misophonia \nScreening List—Child and Youth (selected separately for \nchild- and parent version). Second, we did not perform a \nROC curve analysis, since the AMISOS-Y is not intended \nas a screening instrument.\nResults\nScreening Instrument: Misophonia Screening List—\nChild and Youth\nTable  1 presents descriptive statistics of the clinical, initial \nand final control group.\nPhase 1: Instrument Refinement\nThe initial reliability analysis suggested high internal \nconsistency on the child-reported (α = 0.941) and parent-\nreported (α  = 0.953) version (detailed item characteristics: \nsee Appendix B).

From the initial control group, \n59 participants scored equal to or higher than the cutoff of \n10 (indicating possible false negatives). They were therefore \nremoved from further analyses, resulting in the final control \ngroup of N = 197 youth.\nFor the parent-report version, excellent differentiat-\ning properties were also found, with area under the curve \n(AUC) = 0.990 (SD = 0.005, 95% CI = 0.980–1.000).

For the child-reported version, the first com-\nponent explained 71.2% of the variance, with factor load-\nings ranging from 0.77 to 0.91. For the parent-reported \nversion, this was 70.3%, with factor loadings from 0.73 \nto 0.91. The unidimensional structure was further sup-\nported by the results of parallel analysis (according to \nHorn [63], only the first component eigenvalue exceeded \nthe corresponding randomly generated value in a matrix of \nrespectively 11 variables × 291 respondents, and 11 vari-\nables × 151 respondents).\nConcurrent Validity The point-biserial correlation between \ntotal scores and misophonia “diagnosis” was large and sig-\nnificant, with higher scores for participants with misopho-\nnia (0) compared to controls (1): child-report:  rpb = − 0.90 \n(p < 0.001); parent-report:  rpb = − 0.86 (p < 0.001).\nFig. 1  Misophonia Screening List—Child and Youth: ROC curves. a Child-report version. b Parent-report version"

      "text": "Child Psychiatry & Human Development\nEvidence of concurrent and convergent validity was pro-\nvided by the large correlations between total scores on our \nmisophonia questionnaires and misophonia “diagnosis”, and \nbetween the child- and parent-report versions of our ques-\ntionnaires. Furthermore, our hypotheses regarding divergent \n(discriminant) validity were mostly supported. We found \nsmall-to-moderate positive correlations between our miso-\nphonia questionnaires and measures of attention problems, \ninternalizing problems, and sensory sensitivity, which sug-\ngests that these are related, but distinct constructs, and pro-\nvides evidence that our instruments are able to discriminate \nwell between these constructs. The finding that misophonia \nappears to be a distinct construct, does not imply correla-\ntions with other constructs need to be zero.\nHowever, (partially) in contrast to our hypotheses, we \nonly found significant correlations between total scores on our misophonia questionnaires and the Attention Deficit \nsubscale (and not the total scale) of the Dutch ADHD ques -\ntionnaire (AVL).

Importantly, the AVL does not fully represent the DSM-5 \nADHD diagnosis, as it is a parent-reported questionnaire (as \nopposed to a multi-informant questionnaire or clinical inter -\nview), and as some items are categorized differently than in \nthe DSM-5 (e.g., \"being easily distracted\" is categorized as \nhyperactivity in AVL, and as attention deficit in DSM-5) \n[47, 66].

      "text": "Child Psychiatry & Human Development \nFurthermore, contrary to our hypothesis, the (parent-\nreported) CBCL-Internalizing subscale Somatic Com-\nplaints (measuring physical problems without known medi-\ncal cause; [ 48]) was not significantly correlated with our \nparent-reported misophonia questionnaires. In contrast, in \nprevious research increased parent-reported psychosomatic \ncomplaints were found in children with misophonia com-\npared to peers [7 ]. This discrepancy might be due to the \ncurrent study measuring broad psychosomatic complaints \n(e.g., nightmares, eye/skin problems, different types of pain), \nand the Siepsiak et al. [ 7] study measuring only psycho -\nsomatic pains (i.e., stomach pain, back pain, pain in other \nparts of the body), and excluding “physiological components \nof emotions” (e.g., stomach pains right before an exam). \nPossibly, our broad measurement of psychosomatic com-\nplaints might have resulted in different correlational pat-\nterns. Indeed, closer inspection of our Somatic Complaints \nscale revealed highest scores for the items ‘Headaches’ and \n‘Stomachaches’. These findings suggest a potential relation-\nship between (psychosomatic) pain and misophonia symp-\ntoms, which might be reflective of the distress caused by the \ndisorder, as well as of the tendency of children to express \npsychological symptoms in a somatic manner [67].\nWhile, contrary to our hypothesis, we found a significant \n(small) correlation between the (parent-reported) CBCL-\nExternalizing total problem scale and the parent-reported \nMisophonia Screening List—Child and Youth, this was not \nfound for specific CBCL-Externalizing subscales, nor for \nthe YSR-Externalizing problem scale and the other miso-\nphonia questionnaires. Possibly, this discrepancy might be \ndue to increased rates of verbal and physical aggression in \nresponse to triggers found in younger children (7–12 years) \ncompared to older children (13–18 years) [7 ], considering \nthat the CBCL was filled in by parents for all participat-\ning children in this study, and the YSR only by children \nin the older age range (11+). Furthermore, in contrast to \nour hypothesis, we found (small) significant correlations \nbetween both child-reported misophonia questionnaires \nand the (child-reported) YSR-Social Problems scale, which \nimplies that children reporting higher presence and severity \nof misophonia symptoms also report more social problems. \nThis discrepancy might be attributed to the definition of \nsocial problems: these might imply difficulty in social skills, \nbut also negative social consequences of misophonia symp-\ntoms (e.g., YSR-item 12: I feel lonely). In our hypothesis, \nwe mainly focused on difficulty in social skills, however the \nsocial impairment caused by misophonia [6 , 53, 68] might \nbe reflected in our findings.\nIn short, the newly developed Misophonia Screening \nList—Child and Youth and AMISOS-Y (parallel child- and \nparent-reported versions) are easy-to-use and efficient ques-\ntionnaires with excellent psychometric properties, with sup -\nport for concurrent, convergent and divergent validity. In clinical practice, both questionnaires might be incorporated \nas part of a larger diagnostic process of screening, (differen-\ntial) diagnostics, and severity assessment (e.g., according to \nRegier et al. [69]). First, the 11-item Misophonia Screening \nList—Child and Youth could be administered as standard-\nized screening tool for use in general or potential at-risk \npopulations, such as in children with autism spectrum dis-\norder [70]. Scores above the cutoff (i.e., 10 for child report \nand 9 for parent report) indicate the presence of misophonia \nsymptoms. Second, a clinical interview or evaluation should \nbe performed, ideally by a team of medical professionals \nsuch as otolaryngologists, audiologists [16] and psychia-\ntrists [31], to differentiate misophonia from related condi-\ntions (e.g., hyperacusis; [12, 13]) and provide a misophonia \n“diagnosis” (e.g., by assessment of proposed Amsterdam \nUMC 2020 criteria, in absence of unified diagnostic crite-\nria). Third, (parents of) children with misophonia might then \ncomplete the AMISOS-Y to establish baseline misophonia \nseverity, which could be compared to the norm group scores \nprovided in this study (Table  1), or to the individual scores \nover time to assess natural course or treatment response.\nStrengths of this study include our extensive valida-\ntion process, resulting in two questionnaires with excellent \npsychometric properties and with clearly defined practical \nuse. By comparing a carefully included group of clinically \nreferred children/adolescents (with misophonia as main \n“diagnosis”, confirmed during an extensive intake pro-\ncess with expert psychiatrists/psychologists) with a control \ngroup, we were able to develop an innovative screening \ntool, with clear cutoff scores for parallel child- and parent-\nreported versions, which was not available until now. Fur -\nthermore, as measure of severity, the AMISOS-Y captures \nthe multidimensional nature of misophonia symptoms by \nmeasuring a wide variety of triggers, emotional/behavioral \nresponses and consequences of misophonia.\nSeveral limitations should be considered. First, these \nquestionnaires focus on misophonia per se, and do not \nincorporate questions assessing symptoms of related disor -\nders (e.g., hyperacusis), and visual triggers or physiologi-\ncal responses to triggers (e.g., muscle tension), which are \ncommonly reported in misophonia and mentioned in the \nconsensus definition [2 ]. We recommend to screen for these \nsymptoms in a clinical diagnostic interview instead (which \nwas also our procedure). Second, the answer option ‘I don’t \nknow/not applicable’ on the parent-reported versions was \ncalculated by person-mean imputation, which could have \nresulted in inflated reliability coefficients [71]. However, \nsince this answer option was used occasionally in our study \n(for < 20% of the items and respondents), the negative conse-\nquences of person-mean imputation can be considered neg -\nligible [71]. Interestingly, this answer option was used spar -\ningly even in the control group (in which reporting of ‘Not \napplicable’ might have been expected). This might indicate"

Therefore, future repli-\ncating studies might consider removing this answer option \nfrom the parent-reported versions (and the parallel ‘Not \napplicable’ from the child-reported versions), which would \nresult in a more straight-forward scoring of both question-\nnaires. Third, in the clinical group our misophonia question-\nnaires were assessed online (as part of the large RCT), and \nmostly at home, whereas in the control group assessment \ntook place through paper-and-pencil questionnaires in the \nclassroom. The latter might be associated with perception of \nreduced confidentiality, which could arguably lead to under -\nreporting of symptoms in the control group. We aimed to \nminimize consequences by explicitly stating (verbal and on \npaper) in both groups that coded answers were only visible \nto the research team. In previous research, mode of admin-\nistration did generally not influence questionnaire outcomes \n[72, 73], 74. Fourth, in the current study we did not include \nother (preliminarily validated) measures of misophonia in \nyouth, such as the SMS-Adolescent [9 ], for validity assess-\nment, however this might be an important topic for further \ninvestigations. Last, while our clinical sample may also be \nconsidered a strength, we employed strict in- and exclusion \ncriteria and included only Dutch referred  children/adoles -\ncents, which is not representative for the general popula -\ntion of children/adolescents with misophonia. Future stud-\nies should incorporate larger and more diverse population \nsamples to increase generalizability and include different \nnorm groups.\nTo conclude, this study presents two newly developed \nparallel child- and parent-reported questionnaires for screen-\ning and severity assessment of misophonia in children/ado-\nlescents, with sound psychometric properties. In the future, \nthe misophonia research field should collaboratively estab-\nlish diagnostic guidelines, in which these and additional \nquestionnaires can be incorporated.\nSummary\nThis paper presents an extensive iterative validation process \nof two innovative (parallel child-/parent-reported) question-\nnaires specifically designed to assess misophonia in youth: \nthe Misophonia Screening List – Child and Youth for screen-\ning, and the AMISOS-Y to assess misophonia severity. On \na large combined clinical and general population sample of \nchildren (aged 8-18) and parents, we performed reliability \nand principal component analyses, revealing a one-factor \nsolution and excellent psychometric properties for both \nquestionnaires. Screening cutoff scores were identified using \nROC curve analyses. Evidence for concurrent, convergent, \nand divergent validity was found, with both questionnaires differentiating well between misophonia and related con-\nstructs. While future replication studies in community and \nclinical samples are needed, our results support incorpora-\ntion of these new questionnaires for youth within a unified \ndiagnostic framework\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplemen-\ntary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s10578- 024- 01781-4.\nAcknowledgements We gratefully thank all participating children, \nparents and caregivers, as well as involved teachers and school boards. \nWe thank Nick Goddard and Marlon Schotel for their valuable English \ntranslation of both misophonia questionnaires.\nAuthor’s Contribution  CRediT Author statement file  Lotte R.
