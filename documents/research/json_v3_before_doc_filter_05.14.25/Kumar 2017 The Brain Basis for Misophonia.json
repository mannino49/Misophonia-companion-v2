The commonplace nature of these sounds (often referred to as “trigger sounds”) makes misophonia a devastating disorder for sufferers and their families, and yet nothing is known about the underlying mechanism. Using functional and structural MRI coupled with physiological measurements, we demonstrate that misophonic subjects show specific trigger-sound-related responses in brain and body. Specifically, fMRI showed that in misophonic subjects, trigger sounds elicit greatly exaggerated blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the anterior insular cortex (AIC), a core hub of the “salience network” that is critical for perception of interoceptive signals and emotion processing. Trigger sounds in misophonics were associated with abnormal functional connectivity between AIC and a network of regions responsible for the processing and regulation of emotions, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posteromedial cortex (PMC), hippocampus, and amygdala. Trigger sounds elicited heightened heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) in misophonic subjects, which were mediated by AIC activity. Questionnaire analysis showed that misophonic subjects perceived their bodies differently: they scored higher on interoceptive sensibility than controls, consistent with abnormal functioning of AIC. Finally, brain structural measurements implied greater myelination within vmPFC in misophonic individuals.

The commonplace nature of these sounds\n(often referred to as ‘‘trigger sounds’’) makes miso-phonia a devastating disorder for sufferers and theirfamilies, and yet nothing is known about the under-lying mechanism. Using functional and structuralMRI coupled with physiological measurements, we\ndemonstrate that misophonic subjects show speciﬁc\ntrigger-sound-related responses in brain and body.Speciﬁcally, fMRI showed that in misophonic sub-jects, trigger sounds elicit greatly exaggeratedblood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responsesin the anterior insular cortex (AIC), a core hub ofthe ‘‘salience network’’ that is critical for perceptionof interoceptive signals and emotion processing.\nTrigger sounds in misophonics were associated\nwith abnormal functional connectivity betweenAIC and a network of regions responsible for theprocessing and regulation of emotions, includingventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posterome-dial cortex (PMC), hippocampus, and amygdala.Trigger sounds elicited heightened heart rate (HR)and galvanic skin response (GSR) in misophonic sub-\njects, which were mediated by AIC activity. Question-\nnaire analysis showed that misophonic subjectsperceived their bodies differently: they scored higheron interoceptive sensibility than controls, consistentwith abnormal functioning of AIC. Finally, brain struc-tural measurements implied greater myelinationwithin vmPFC in misophonic individuals. Overall,our results show that misophonia is a disorder in\nwhich abnormal salience is attributed to particular\nsounds based on the abnormal activation and func-tional connectivity of AIC.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nfMRI data were acquired in 20 misophonic and 22 age- and sex-\nmatched controls while they listened to a set of three sounds:trigger sounds (which evoke a misophonic reaction in miso-\nphonic individuals; e.g., eating, breathing sounds), unpleasant\nsounds (which are perceived to be annoying by both groupsbut do not evoke misophonic distress; e.g., baby cry, a person\nscreaming), and neutral sounds (e.g., rain). After listening to\neach sound, subjects rated (1) how annoying the sound was(both groups) and (2) how effectively the sound triggered atypical misophonic reaction (misophonic group only) or how anti-\nsocial (in the sense the subject would not like to be in the environ-\nment in which the sound is produced) the sounds were (controlgroup only). Behavioral responses, galvanic skin response\n(GSR) and heart rate (HR), were acquired during the acquisition\nof fMRI data (see Figure 1 A for a schematic of the paradigm).\nWhole-brain structural MRI data were acquired as multi-param-\neter maps (MPMs) [ 9] to measure myelination content, water,\nand iron levels.\nBehavioral data ( Figure 1 B) showed that trigger sounds\nevoked misophonic distress in misophonic subjects, whereas\nthe unpleasant sounds, although annoying, did not produce a\nmisophonic reaction. There was no difference between the miso-phonic distress ratings of trigger sounds by the misophonic\ngroup and annoyance ratings of unpleasant sounds by the con-\ntrol group. It is likely, however, that the two groups used differentsubjective scales while rating the sounds. Random-effects anal-\nysis of fMRI data using the general linear model (GLM) [ 10] with\ngroup (two levels) and sound types (three categories) as factorsdemonstrated an interaction in the anterior insular cortex (AIC)\nbilaterally ( Figure 2 A; further regions are listed in Table S1 ).\nFurther analysis showed that the interaction in AIC was drivenby greater activation in misophonic subjects compared to con-trol subjects in response to trigger sounds (see Figure 2 B and\nFigure S1 for conﬁrmatory plots; see also Figure S2 ). Signiﬁcant\nactivation differences between misophonic and control subjectsdid not occur to unpleasant or neutral sounds. Activity in both the\nleft and right AIC varied linearly with the subjective rating of\nmisophonic distress in the misophonic group, as shown in conﬁr-matory plots in Figure 2 C. A large body of evidence [ 11] impli-\ncates AIC in subjective feelings associated with emotions,\nincluding anger.

Speciﬁc\nhyperactivity in AIC to trigger sounds supports the hypothesis\nthat misophonic subjects assign aberrantly higher salience tothese sounds.\nHaving identiﬁed AIC as a key region that differentiates trigger\nsounds in misophonic participants, we sought to explore its\nstimulus-dependent connectivity proﬁle to establish whetherthere are alterations at the network level that are speciﬁc to\nmisophonia. Using left AIC as a seed region, we analyzed its\nstimulus-dependent connectivity in the two groups. Greaterfunctional connectivity of AIC for misophonic subjects was\nobserved in a network of brain regions comprising the ventrome-\ndial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posteromedial cortex (PMC; pos-terior cingulate and retrosplenial cortex), hippocampus, and\namygdala ( Figure 3 A). This increased functional connectivity\nwas speciﬁc to trigger sounds: no signiﬁcant differences in con-nectivity were observed for unpleasant sounds. Importantly, thefunctional connectivity pattern between the two groups for the\nsame sounds was not only different quantitatively but also qual-\nitatively: whereas the connectivity to vmPFC is positive (withrespect to connectivity for neutral sounds) in misophonic sub-\njects, the connectivity for controls for the same set of sounds\nis negative. Analysis of functional connectivity of right AIC alsoshowed trigger-sound-speciﬁc increased connectivity to vmPFC\nand PMC ( Figure S3 A; functional connectivity to amygdala and\nhippocampus was also observed but at a slightly relaxed\nthreshold). The vmPFC and PMC together form core parts of\nthe default mode network (DMN) [ 13] (see Figure S3 B for overlap\nbetween the DMN and the functional connectivity network ofAIC), which is activated when subjects are engaged in internally\ndirected thoughts and retrieval of memories [ 14] and is deacti-\nvated when attention is directed to external stimuli. Greatercoupling of AIC with the DMN suggests that misophonic sub-\njects, on hearing trigger sounds, are unable to ‘‘disengage’’\nAIC from the DMN, which entails memories and contextual asso-ciations of trigger sounds to bear on the activation of AIC. This is\nalso consistent with a recent study [ 15] using multivariate pattern\nclassiﬁcation, which showed that patterns of activity in vmPFCand PMC were most informative in distinguishing different types\nof emotions. Distinct functional connectivity of AIC to vmPFC\nand PMC in misophonics and controls for the same sounds sug-gests that these regions play a crucial role in instantiatingdifferent emotional responses for the trigger sounds in the two\ngroups. This atypical functional connectivity could, therefore,\nunderlie the abnormal activation of AIC and the aberrant salienceassigned to trigger sounds by the misophonic group.\nBecause misophonia symptoms start early in life (mean age of\nonset is /C2412 years and can be as early as 5 years [ 1]), we also\nFigure 1. Experimental Paradigm and Subjective Ratings\n(A) fMRI paradigm: a standard block design was used in which sounds were presented for 15 s. After every sound, subjects gave two ratings on a scale from 1 to 4\nwith a button press for (1) how annoying the sound was and (2) how effective the sound was in triggering misophonic reaction (misophonia group) or how an tisocial\nthe sound was (control group). fMRI data were acquired continuously with a repetition time (TR) of 3.12 s. GSR and HR were also monitored throughout theexperiment.(B) Subjective ratings: (i) misophonic distress rating of three types of sounds by misophonic group; (ii) antisocialness rating of sounds (control s ubjects); and (iii)\nannoyance rating of sounds by both groups. Misophonic subjects rated the trigger sounds as evoking greater misophonic reaction compared to unpleasa nt (p <\n0.001) and neutral sounds (p < 0.001). Unpleasant sounds were still perceived to be annoying (p < 0.001 compared to neutral sounds) by the misophonic su bjects,\ndemonstrating a dissociation between general annoyance and misophonic reaction.

Trigger sounds evoked greater GSR and HR responses\nin misophonic subjects than control subjects ( Figure 4 A). Physi-\nological responses were sustained throughout the duration of\nsound presentation and were speciﬁc to trigger sounds, with\nno difference in GSR or HR response between the two groupsfor unpleasant and neutral sounds. The heightened trigger-spe-ciﬁc autonomic responses we observed are consistent with the\nstrong tendency of misophonic subjects to escape from the envi-\nronment of trigger sounds [ 1, 2] or experience strong anxiety and\nanger if unable to escape (ﬁght/ﬂight response).\nWhat is the brain source(s) of these heightened autonomic re-\nsponses in misophonia? To answer this, we used mediationanalysis [ 16], which aims to test whether a relation from variable\nX (group membership; i.e., misophonic or control) to Y (GSR or\nHR) could be explained (mediated) by a third variable, M (brainactivation). A signiﬁcant mediation implies that there is an indi-rect path to Y (X to M to Y) and would show brain activity (M)\nthat can mediate the observed GSR/HR (Y) over and above\nwhat is explained by group membership (X). We ran the whole-brain mediation analysis separately for GSR and HR. We found\nthat activity in AIC mediated both the heightened GSR and HR\n(Figure 4 B) in misophonic subjects.\nOver the last decade, there has been a growing recognition\nthat interoception (perception of internal bodily states) can inﬂu-\nence the salience and experience of emotions associated with astimulus [ 17–20 ]. Interestingly, AIC is the key brain structure that\nintegrates ascending visceral inputs from the body with external\nsensory inputs. In accordance with this, atypical interoceptionand activation in AIC have been shown to underlie a number ofsocial-emotional disorders [ 21, 22 ]. Recently, there has been a\ngrowing interest in extending prediction-based hierarchical\nBayesian inference as a model of interoception [ 19, 23 ]. In this\nmodel, interoception involves inferring causes of interoceptive\nsignals by combining bottom-up interoceptive signals with prior\nbeliefs (predictions) of their causes. In this multi-level and hierar-chically organized inference scheme, AIC is at the top of the hi-\nerarchy and is suggested to infer the overall state of the body\n[24]. Evaluation of subjective beliefs about body perception us-\ning the Body Consciousness Questionnaire [ 25] showed that mi-\nsophonics report greater awareness of internal sensations ( Fig-\nure S4 ) compatible with altered interoceptive sensibility [ 22]i n\nmisophonics. Given the role of AIC in representing bodily states,the questionnaire data are also consistent with abnormal AIC\nfunctioning in misophonia.\nConclusions\nOverall, our data show that for misophonics, trigger sounds causehyperactivity of AIC and an abnormal functional connectivity of\nthis region with medial frontal, medial parietal, and temporal re-\ngions; that there is abnormal myelination in medial frontal cortexthat shows abnormal functional connectivity to AIC; and that theaberrant neural response mediates the emotional coloring and\nphysiological arousal that accompany misophonic experiences.\nTogether, our data suggest that abnormal salience attributed tootherwise innocuous sounds, coupled with atypical perception\nof internal body states, underlies misophonia. With the available\ndata, it is not possible to decide whether misophonia is a causeor consequence of atypical interoception, and further work is\nneeded to delineate the relation between the two.\nMisophonia does not feature in any neurological or psychiatric\nclassiﬁcation of disorders; sufferers do not report it for fear of thestigma that this might cause, and clinicians are commonly un-\naware of the disorder. This study deﬁnes a clear phenotype\nbased on changes in behavior, autonomic responses, and brainactivity and structure that will guide ongoing efforts to classifyand treat this pernicious disorder.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nSupplemental Information includes Supplemental Experimental Procedures,\nfour ﬁgures, one table, and one questionnaire and can be found with this articleonline at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.12.048 .\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nS.K., O.T.-H., W.S., J.S.W., and T.D.G. designed the experiments; S.K. and\nO.T.-H. collected the data; S.K., with help from W.S., J.S.W., M.F.C., andT.D.G., analyzed the data; S.K., O.T.-H., W.S., J.S.W., M.F.C., M.A., T.E.C.,P.E.G., D.-E.B., and T.D.G. wrote the paper; and T.D.G. supervised all aspectsof the work.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nT.D.G. would like to thank the Wellcome Trust for the ﬁnancial support of this\nproject (grants WT091681MA and WT106964).
