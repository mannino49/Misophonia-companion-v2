Affective signals are inherently multimodal, allowing us to experience  \nemotions in richer, mo re nuanced ways.  The interplay between auditory and visual  modalities \ncan influence the affective response. For instance, harsh sounds can amplify feelings of \ndiscomfort, regardless of the accompanying visual, such as  simultaneously hearing and seeing a \nchair scraping across the floor. This study aims to explore the physiological correlates of \naffective signals associated with naturalistic audiovisual clips and their auditory and visual \ncomponents, which we will refer to as the three modalities: audiovi sual, auditory, and visual.    \nFluctuations in affective states are accompanied by changes in sympathetic and \nparasympathetic systems reflected in physiological responses.  Heart rate (HR) has been \nassociated with both valence and arousal. It has been shown that initial heart rate deceleration \nwas sensitive to various aversive stimuli, such as pictures  (Lang et al, 1993; Bradley et al., 2001; \nGomez et al., 2016) , sounds  (Bradley & Lang, 2000; Coutinho & Cangelosi, 2011) , films \n(Baldaro et al., 2004; Bradley et al., 2001; Palomba et al., 2000)  and aversive environments \ndesigned to elicit fear and pain  (Vowles et al., 2006) . Facial electrom yography ( EMG ) measured \nover the brow (corrugator supercilii ) has been shown to increase with negative  valence for \npicture  (Cacioppo et al., 1986; Greenwald et al., 1989; Kim & Wedell, 2016; Lang et al., 1993; \nLarsen et al., 2003 ; Tan et al., 201 2), sound (Bradley & Lang, 2000; Jäncke et al., 1996;  Kim et \nal., 2019; Larsen et al., 2003) , word (Larsen et al., 2003)  and film (Sato et al., 2020; Sato & \nKochiyama, 2022)  stimuli . EMG over the cheek (zygomaticus major ) has been shown to increase \nwith intensity of both positive  and negative valence  (Bernat et al., 2006; Bradley & Lang, 2000; \nCodispoti et al., 2008; Dellacherie et al., 2011; Grewe et al., 2007; Lang et al., 1993; Larsen et Journal Pre-proof"

One study identified a positive relationship with zygomaticus major potentiation , but \nnot for corrugator supercilii potentiation for videos (Gjoreski et al., 2022) , while  another  study \nfound no relationship  with arousal  for picture  stimuli  (Tan et al., 2012) . Heightened \nelectrodermal  activity ( EDA ) has been shown to be sensitive to emotionally arousing picture  \n(Amrhein et al., 2004; Bradley & Lang, 2000; Bradley et al., 2001 ; Kim & Wedell, 2016; Lang \net al., 1993) , sound  (Bradley & Lang, 2000; Greco et al., 2017) , and film (Sato et al., 2020; Sato \n& Kochiyama, 2022)  stimuli . Decreased nose-tip skin temperature ( SKT ) has been associated \nwith increased arousal for picture (Salazar -López et al., 2015)  and film stimuli (Sato et al., 2020; \nSato & Kochiyama, 2022) . Thus, auditory and visual affective stimuli have both been shown to \nelicit physiological responses that can be measured using vari ous physiological channel s \n(Bradley & Lang, 2000; Lang & Bradley, 2010) . \nMost of the aforementioned  studies included erotic or comed ic (Amrhein et al., 2004; \nBradley et al., 2001; Gomez et al., 2016; Salazar -López et al., 2015; Sato & Kochiyama, 2022) , \ngore or accident -related  (Amrhein et al., 2004; Bradley et al., 2001; Gjoreski et al., 2022; Gomez \net al., 2016; Larsen et al., 2003; Salazar -López et al ., 2015; Tan et al., 2012)  stimuli  that tend to \nelicit strong affective responses .

This study \nmakes two important contributions. First, it  examines physiological responses to  aversive and \nnon-aversive  audiovisual clips and their auditory and visual components within the same study. \nSecond, it uses stimuli that may be encountered in everyday life that hold relevan ce for clinical \napplications. We record ed five physiological measures  that have been shown to be sensitive to \naffect : electrocardiogr am (ECG), EMG for zygomaticus major and corrugator supercili i muscles, \nEDA, and SKT  and investigat ed how they change as a function of aversiveness for audiovisual \nstimuli  and their auditory and visual components . We formulated four hypotheses. First,  we \nhypothesized that since facial EMG measures have been  shown to be sensitive  to valence, they \nshould be sensitive to aversive ness. The EMG signals would be higher for aversive compared to \nnon-aversive stimuli  (Bradley & Lang, 2000; Lang et al., 1993; Larsen et al. , 2003) , although \nmixed results have been shown for EMG Z (Bernat et al., 2006; Codispoti et al., 2008) . Second, \nwe expected HR deceleration to be greater and EDA to be higher for the aversive condition. \nNegative high -arousal stimuli typically elicit larger deceleration of HR (Bradley et al., 2001) and \nlarger EDA responses (Bradley & Lang, 2006; Bradley et al., 2001; Bradley & Lang, 2000)  as do \nlosses versus gains in choice experiments (Crone et al., 2004; Hayes & Wedell, 2020) .

Only EDA was  sensitive to the visual \ncomponent . SKT was not sensitive to the aversiveness manipulation for any modality . The \nsensitivity of HR and EMG C to aversiveness remained significant  after controlling for arousal.  \nThe enhancement effect was observed in our ratings on valence and in the HR, EMG C, and \nEMG Z responses. Four of our measures ( HR, EMG Z, EDA, SKT) were sensitive to modality, \nwhich may reflect valence and arousal differences across modalities.  We discuss these findings \nbelow  starting with the four hypotheses that we formulated . \nIn support of our first hypothesis, both EMG C and EMG Z showed greater potentiation to \naversive audiovisual stimuli. ( Bradley & Lang, 2000; Höfling et al., 2020; Larsen et al., 2003; \nNeta et al., 2009; Sato & Kochiyama, 2022)  Our second hypothesis  was partially supported. The Journal Pre-proof"

Our third hypothesis that aversiveness sensitivity would occur across \nmodalities was partially supported. Valence and arousal ratings differed between aversive and \nnon-aversive conditions  across all three modalities. HR deceleration and EMG C potentiation \nwere greater for aversive  compared to non -aversive stimuli  for the audiovisual and auditory \nmodali ties, but not for the visual modality.  In contrast, EDA signal was greater for aversive  \ncompared to non -aversive  stimuli for  the visual modality only.  EMG Z did not  show greater \npotentiation  to aversive compared to non -aversive stimuli  in either unimodal condition.  The \nfourth hypothesis that self-report  and physiological sensitivity to aversiveness differences should \nbe larger for the audiovisual modality was partially supported.  Results from HR, EMG C, EMG Z \nand valence rating were consistent with a n enhancement effect, i.e., amplification of the affective \nresponse s when unimodal information is integrated  (Gao et al., 2018a, Gao et al., 2018b) . \nHowever, the enhancement effect was no t observed in other channels  (EDA, SKT) .(Bradley & \nLang, 2000; Š olcová & Lačev, 2017; Salazar -López et al., 2015; Sato & Kochiyama, 2022)   \nThe robust relationship between EMG C and aversiveness is in line with previous evidence \nthat it responds stronger for negative valence (Bradley & Lang, 2000; Höfling et al., 2020; \nLarsen et al., 2003; Neta et al., 2009; Sato & Kochiyama, 2022) . It may seem odd that EMG Z \nalso showed greater potentiation for aversive stimuli. Literature about the relationship between \nzygomaticus major and valence is mixed . Some previous findings suggest that zygomaticus \nmajor muscle is an indicator of pleasantness (Baur et al., 2015; Lang et al., 1993, Sato et al., \n2008) . Other findings suggest there is a quadratic relationship between zygomaticus major \npotentiation and valence (Kappas & Pecchinenda, 1998; Larsen et al., 2003;  Menne & Schwab, \n2018) .

Previous findings have found heightened EMG Z \npotentiation when processing disgusting pictures (Lang et al., 1993)  and dynamic video s (De \nJong et al., 2002) . Another possible interpretation is that zygomatic muscles control multiple \nmouth movement angles that allow for diverse facial expressions, including lip corner puller \n(Action Unit 12; zygomaticus major) and nasolabial deepener (Action Unit 11; zygomaticus \nminor), the two action units related to  hedonic valence . Tan et al. (2012)  pointed out the \npossibility of the influence of cross talk from multiple muscles adjacent to the zygomaticus \nmajor. A future study can include measurement of both zygomaticus major and minor to better \nunderstand their roles in responding  to aversiveness .  \nWe found heightened HR deceleration following the stimulus presentation to aversive \nversus non -aversiv e conditions for both the audiovisual  stimuli and their auditory component s. \nThese results are in line with previous findings that initial heart rate dec eleration was related to \naversiveness perception  across various contexts  (Bradley et al., 2001; Bradley & Lang, 2000; \nGomez et al., 20 16; Lang et al, 1993; Palomba et al., 2000 ). Surprisingly, the significant HR \ndifference between aversive and non -aversive stimuli  found for audiovisual  and audio  \npresentations was not absent in  the visual modality. As shown in the line graphs (Figure 3 ), there \nwas a sharp HR deceleration for aversive visual stimuli that was as strong or stronger than that \nfor the aversive audiovisual and auditory presentations. However, non -aversive visual stimuli \nalso showed a prominent deceleration (0 -5s), rather than  the slight initial deceleration (0 -1s), \nsubsequent acceleration (1 -3s), and later deceleration (3 -5s) pattern found for non -aversive \naudiovisual and auditory stimuli. The HR acceleration phase occurring 2 -3s after stimuli \npresentation has been shown to be  a characteristic feature of both pleasant sounds  (Bradley & \nLang, 2000 ) and pictures  (Bradley et al, 2001 ; Lang et al., 1993 ).

Bradley et al. (2001 ) suggested that the HR accelerat ion in response to appetitive \nstimuli may indicate the “success of a recognition -encoding process”, with more readily \nidentifieable stimuli (e.g., food and nature) eliciting greater acceleration compared to stimuli \nrequiring more sustained processing (e.g. , families or sports scenes with novel individuals). A \nrecent review (Skora et al., 2022) proposes that HR deceleration is associated with enhanced \nattention to external stimuli, while HR aceleration is associated with enhanced action tendencies \nand behavi oral readjustment. One potential explanation for the strong HR deceleration observed \nfor non -aversive visual stimuli in our study is that identifying videos without sound may \ngenerally demand greater attentional resources compared to audiovisual clips and sounds alone.  \nOur results on EDA only showed that it was sensitive to aversiveness for the visual \ncomponent. This may suggest an effect of arousal, instead of valence. There are m any studies \nthat has shown a reliable relationship between  EDA  and arousal  (e.g., Lang et al., 1993; Sato et \nal., 2020; Sato & Kochiyama, 2022) . In partial support of this interpretation, o ur EDA results \nwere no longer significant once arousal was accounted for.  \nBecau se we focused on aversiveness in naturalistic stimuli, valence and arousal were \ninherently confounded (Kuppens et al., 2013) , unlike controlled stimuli that are specifically \ndesigned to be balanced in terms of both valence and arousal. This natural overlap between \nvalence and arousal in rea l-world stimuli makes it challenging to isolate the individual \ncontributions of each factor with stimulus manipulation.  To better understand our  significant  \nresults of aversiveness sensitivity , we regressed out the effect of arousal to statistically isolate the \neffect of valence  using re sidualized ANOVA. Our results revealed that the sensitivity of heart Journal Pre-proof"

This \nsuggests that valence is the primary contributor  to the  physiological processes observed in our \nstudy.  \nMany real -life scenarios involve sounds that carry emotional weight, such as the sounds \nof honking horns on a busy street. Our stimuli emphasize sensory sensitivity to sound, while \nvisual components tend to be less emotionally evocative. For example, it is  the jarring noise of a \nchair scraping across the floor that creates an aversive reaction, rather than the visual of the \nscene itself. Thus, it  is unsurprising for  our stimuli set that the aversiveness was detectable in \nheart rate  and corrugator supercilii  signals for auditory component, and not for the visual \ncomponent. These results highlight the powerful role that sound plays in shaping emotional \nexperiences .  \nOur study extended previous research regarding the effects of presentation modality  by \ncomparin g naturalistic audiovisual clips to their isolated unimodal components.  This approach \nallowed us to examine  the enhancement effect across modalities more directly while controlling \nfor content differences. Our self-report  data replicated the enhancement effect, in which the \ndifference in valence for aversive versus non -aversive stimuli was greater for the combined \naudiovisual stimuli than for either modality separately (Baumgartner et al., 2006; Gao, Wedell, \nGreen, et al., 2018; Gao, Wedell, Kim, et al., 2018) . The observed interaction of aversiveness \nand modality for H R and  EMG C also supported this effect  in physiological data . \nThere are a number of limitations in the current study. Our participants were \npredominantly female  college students , reflecting student composition of the psychology \nparticipant pool. Thus, we were not able to examine the effects of age and gender (Burriss et al., \n2007)  on physiological responses to aversiveness. Also,  we used a fairly short stimuli Journal Pre-proof"

However, p ast research in our lab  has identified valence and arousal \nfrom  fMRI  (Kim et al., 2016, 2017)  and physiologica l (Kim & Wedell, 2016)  signals using 4s, \n5s, and 8s presentation intervals.  Although  the naturalistic stimuli , like the ones used in this \nstudy,  have the advantage of increased ecological validity, they lack control over lower -level \nauditory and visual features that may contribute to physiological responses (Coutinho & \nCangelosi, 2011 ; Delpl anque et al., 2007 ). In addition, the direct comparison with prior research \nis limited given no extreme content (e.g. mutilation, erotica themes) or food related themes that \npreviously elicited  strong cardiac responses (Bradley et al., 2001) were used in the present study. \nFinally, by  comparing aversive and non -aversive stimuli,  we are adopting a bipolar \nrepresentation of valence and cannot test for effects that may emerge from bivalent approach.  \nFurther studies could address some of these lim itations.  \nIn conclusion, t he present study isolated the unimodal audi tory and visual components \nfrom naturalistic audiovisual clips to examine physiological responses as a function of \naversiveness and presentation modality. We found that heart rate  and corrugator supercilii \npotentiation were consistently sensitive to aversiveness across audiovisual and auditory \nmodalities. Electrodermal activity and zygomaticus major signals were less reliably related to \naversiveness. Overall, physiological signals for the visual components were less differentiated. In \naddition, our results showed partial support for an emotional enhancement effect for cross -modal \nintegration in both p hysiological activity and affective ratings. These findings extended previous \nresearch on psychophysiological audiovisual pairing and provide insights for future studies that \nmay sample from clinical populations.    \n \nFunding  Journal Pre-proof"
