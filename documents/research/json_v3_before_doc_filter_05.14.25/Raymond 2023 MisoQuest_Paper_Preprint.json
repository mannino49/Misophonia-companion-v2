      "text": "4 Misophonia is a psychologically distressing experience involving an extreme aversion to 71 certain ordinary sounds. The clinical presentation of misophonia was first described by Jastreboff 72 & Jastreboff in 2001 and has since garnered increasing awareness among clinicians and 73 researchers. Despite researcher consensus that misophonia is a discrete disorder, there remains a 74 lack of consensus regarding how misophonia should be characterized and assessed (Swedo et al., 75 2022).  76  77 Misophonia Characterization 78 Misophonia is a decreased sound tolerance disorder involving an aversion to specific 79 “trigger” sounds (Siepsiak, Śliwerski, et al., 2020). Any sound can be a trigger for someone with 80 misophonia, but common triggers are human-produced, repetitive sounds like chewing and 81 breathing (Claiborn et al., 2020; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018). When someone with misophonia 82 hears a trigger sound, it elicits a physiological stress response and feelings of intense anger, 83 anxiety, and/or disgust (Edelstein et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2017; Schröder et al., 2013) 84 Variation in emotional responses to sound is normal, but misophonic reactions can be 85 functionally impairing and clinically significant. Some individuals affected by misophonia 86 describe experiencing pain, suicidal ideation, and/or an inability to enjoy life because of their 87 ongoing symptoms (Alekri & Al Saif, 2019; Hocaoglu, 2018). In addition, behavioral studies 88 demonstrate that people with misophonia experience impaired attention and memory in the 89 presence of trigger sounds when compared to healthy controls (Daniels et al., 2020; Frank et al., 90 2020; Seaborne & Fiorella, 2018; Silva & Sanchez, 2019) These trigger-specific cognitive 91 deficits represent functional impairments that are central to the conceptualization of misophonia. 92"

      "text": "5 Accordingly, validated assessments for misophonia should produce scores that are meaningfully 93 associated with these deficits. 94 Evidence-based clinical assessments and interventions are imperative to the management 95 and treatment of misophonia. However, misophonia is not currently listed in psychiatric 96 diagnostic manuals such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM; 97 Gold, 2014). As a result, individuals with misophonia are often misdiagnosed and left without 98 evidence-based treatment options (Brout et al., 2018; Claiborn et al., 2020; Potgieter et al., 2019) 99 This is especially concerning because misophonia has been estimated to affect a staggering 15-100 20% of individuals (Naylor et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017). This point 101 prevalence is alarmingly high given the potential severity of misophonia; however, these 102 estimates were not derived from agreed upon diagnostic criteria. Rather, the prevalence of 103 misophonia has been estimated using self-report measures that do not have rigorously validated 104 clinical cut-offs (Naylor et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017). Thus, while 15-20% of 105 the population may experience misophonia symptoms, clinically significant cases are likely rarer. 106 Regardless, the misophonia literature is sparse (<100 empirical articles published as of 2022; 107 Swedo et al., 2022), suggesting that little is known about a condition that potentially affects 108 many. Validated measures for misophonia are therefore crucial for accurately capturing 109 prevalence, improving clinical practice, and advancing the limited field of research. 110  111 Misophonia Assessment 112         The most widely used self-report measures for misophonia are the Amsterdam 113 Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S; Schröder et al., 2013) and the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; 114 Wu et al., 2014). The popularity of these measures likely reflects the fact that they were the first 115"

Both the A-MISO-116 S and MQ were adapted from scales designed to measure Obsessive-Compulsive behaviors, but 117 the conceptualization of misophonia as an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has since been 118 criticized. Rather, scientific evidence suggests that while misophonia is highly comorbid with 119 OCD, it is similarly comorbid with other psychological disorders, including mood disorders, 120 anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 121 (Claiborn et al., 2020; Jager et al., 2020; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018). In addition, the symptoms 122 captured by OCD measures do not appear to correlate with misophonia-related impairment 123 (Remmert et al., 2022). The psychometric evidence supporting the A-MISO-S and MQ is also 124 incomplete, and comprises data collected exclusively from high school and undergraduate 125 samples (Naylor et al., 2021; Sarıgedik & Gulle, 2021; Wu et al., 2014). Thus, the 126 generalizability of these measures for use with diverse age groups is unclear. 127 To address the absence of a well-validated measure for misophonia, Siepsiak and 128 colleagues (2020a) developed a new self-report measure for misophonia; the MisoQuest is a 129 unidimensional scale comprising 14 Likert-rated items that tap a single underlying construct: 130 misophonia severity. The MisoQuest was shown to have strong internal consistency (Cronbach’s 131 alpha = 0.95) and scores were highly stable over a period of five weeks (interclass correlation 132 coefficient = 0.84; (Siepsiak et al., 2020a). In addition, these psychometric data were acquired 133 from a more diverse sample, providing greater generalizability (Siepsiak et al., 2020a). A 134 receiver operating characteristic analysis of the data provided by Siepsiak and colleagues (2020a) 135 indicated that a cut-off score of 61 resulted in the highest overall accuracy at separating controls 136 (MisoQuest scores between 14-60) from people with misophonia (MisoQuest scores ≥ 61; Enzler 137 et al., 2021).

These include the Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Scale 145 (S-Five; Vitoratou et al., 2021), the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ; Rosenthal et al., 146 2021), and the Berlin Misophonia Questionnaire Revised (BMQ-R; Remmert et al., 2022), which 147 also have promising psychometric properties. However, in comparison to these other measures, 148 the MisoQuest has fewer items and may be particularly useful as a rapid screening tool.  149 Overall, the MisoQuest appears to be a reliable and valid measure for identifying 150 misophonia. However, the MisoQuest was written in Polish and validated in Polish-speaking 151 samples before being translated into English by the research team alongside other researchers 152 and interpreters. Several studies have since used the English language MisoQuest to assess 153 misophonia severity (Bagrowska et al., 2022; Enzler et al., 2021; Savard et al., 2022); however, a 154 cross-cultural validation study had yet to be conducted and the properties of the English-155 translated MisoQuest remain unknown. 156   157 The Present Study 158 The goal of this study was to advance the characterization and assessment of misophonia 159 by tackling the following aims: 1) evaluate the psychometric properties (factor structure, internal 160 consistency, and test-retest reliability) of the English language MisoQuest; 2) establish 161"

Both tasks have been used to identify trigger-specific 168 cognitive deficits in those with misophonia (Daniels et al., 2020; Seaborne & Fiorella, 2018), but 169 are considered to assess different cognitive processes. The Stroop task is used widely throughout 170 psychology research as an indicator of cognitive control and selective attention (Bugg, 2012), 171 whereas reading comprehension is an indicator of sustained attention and memory-related 172 processes (Palladino et al., 2001). By using both tasks, the current study will evaluate the type of 173 cognitive deficits that are associated with MisoQuest scores. 174         In accordance with the psychometric data supporting the original, Polish version of the 175 MisoQuest, we hypothesized that the English language MisoQuest would have a unidimensional 176 factor structure with strong internal consistency and test-retest reliability after five weeks. Next, 177 we hypothesized that scores on the MisoQuest would be strongly correlated with scores on 178 another misophonia measure (the S-Five) but only weakly or moderately correlated with scores 179 on measures for anxiety (the General Anxiety Disorder scale [GAD-7]) and sensory 180 hypersensitivity (the Sensory Hyperactivity Scale [SHS]). We hypothesized that individuals 181 scoring 61 or greater on the  MisoQuest (the previously identified cutoff score for clinically 182 relevant misophonia)would perform worse than control participants on the Stroop and reading 183 comprehension tasks in the presence of trigger sounds.

To minimize environmental 238 variability, participants were asked to dim their lights, turn up the brightness on their computer 239 screen, minimize distractions, and adjust their computer volume to a level that was loud but not 240 uncomfortable. Participants then completed three blocks of their assigned task, each presented in 241 a different background sound condition: in silence; in the presence of a generally aversive sound 242 (baby crying); or in the presence of a common misophonic trigger sound (a person chewing). The 243 three sound conditions were presented to participants in a random order and were 244 counterbalanced across participants to control for order effects.

Participants completed one block of 30 practice trials, followed by 320 three blocks of 72 experimental trials, each presented in one of the three sound conditions. 321 Within each experimental block , participants were presented with 36 congruent trials and 36 322 incongruent trials (in random order) with a 500 ms interval between trials. 323 The Stroop effect was quantified as the difference between a participant’s mean reaction 324 time on congruent trials and incongruent trials. Only trials where the participant responded 325 correctly were included in this analysis.

In addition to replicating the analyses of Siepsiak & 546 colleagues (2020a), we sought to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the 547 MisoQuest. We demonstrated that MisoQuest scores are strongly associated with scores on 548 another measure for misophonia and only moderately associated with scores on measures for 549 anxiety and general sensory hypersensitivity. Misophonia severity is known to be associated with 550 the severity of anxiety (Bagrowska et al., 2022; Schadegg et al., 2021) and sensory 551 hypersensitivity symptoms (Wu et al., 2014), so moderate associations between these measures 552 likely reflect the comorbidity between these constructs.

Overall, the psychometric 555 evidence presented here grants researchers and clinicians improved confidence in their ability to 556 accurately assess misophonia severity in English-speaking individuals, and will strengthen the 557 claims of previous and future research studies using the MisoQuest.

However, these results largely failed to reach statistical significance and should be 570 interpreted accordingly. The MisoQuest cut-off score used to divide participants with and 571 without clinically significant misophonia yields high diagnostic accuracy (Enzler et al., 2021) but 572 sacrifices sensitivity (Siepsiak et al., 2020b), meaning that some individuals with misophonia 573 were likely not captured using this cut-off. The categorical approach to misophonia assessment 574 may therefore make it challenging for researchers to recruit large enough misophonia samples to 575 power their desired analyses. 576 Our dimensional analyses revealed that in the presence of trigger sounds, individuals with 577 higher MisoQuest scores had poorer reading comprehension accuracy. These results suggest that 578 misophonia symptom severity is associated with the magnitude of trigger-specific deficits. In 579 addition, MisoQuest scores were found to predict reading comprehension accuracy independent 580 from general anxiety, sensory hypersensitivity, and education level. However, contrary to 581 previous studies (Daniels et al., 2020; Silva & Sanchez, 2019), MisoQuest scores did not predict 582 an increased Stroop effect when the trigger sound condition was considered in isolation. This 583 suggests that misophonia-specific factors captured by the MisoQuest, such as aversive emotional 584 reactions to trigger sounds, may be related to deficits in working memory and sustained 585 attention, but not selective attention. Importantly, impairments in sustained attention are 586 clinically relevant; previous research in clinical populations has shown that deficits in sustained 587 attention are better predictors of distress and social impairment than deficits in selective attention 588 (Andrade et al., 2009).

The finding that trigger-specific cognitive 593 deficits scale with MisoQuest scores contradicts that claim and suggests that the MisoQuest may 594 be used as a dimensional measure. By treating misophonia as a dimensional construct, 595 researchers can capture a wider range of variability, more effectively power their analyses, 596 achieve greater flexibility in statistical modeling, and develop a more nuanced interpretation of 597 individual differences. Despite these advantages, categorical approaches remain relevant to 598 certain research questions (e.g., regarding the prevalence and onset of misophonia) as well as 599 clinical decision-making.

The recall questions were expected to discriminate 620 between those with and without a strong understanding of the stories but have not been formally 621 evaluated. Finally, while the MisoQuest showed strong convergent validity with the S-Five, there 622 is currently no consensus ‘gold-standard’ diagnostic tool against which the MisoQuest could be 623 compared against. Future studies may opt to include interview-based assessments (e.g., the Duke 624 Misophonia Interview; Guetta et al., 2022), which might further inform the validity of the 625 MisoQuest. 626  627 Constraints on Generality 628 The sample recruited in the current study comprised a sample of 139 participants, 629 including 44 people with misophonia and 95 controls (96 female, 34 male, 9 transgender/non-630 binary/non-conforming/agender; 90 White/Caucasian, 10 Black/African Descent, 10 East Asian, 631 10 South Asian, 3 Middle Eastern/Arab, 3 Latinx/Hispanic, and 13 people from mixed ethnic 632 backgrounds). Thus, while this sample was age and socioeconomically diverse, it was 633 predominantly composed of white females. It is unclear if there are discernable differences in the 634 presentation of misophonia among genders and ethnicities, meaning that these results may not 635"

Thus, the results presented here represent a step towards 636 validating the English-translated MisoQuest, but do not indicate that the MisoQuest is validated 637 for use with all English-speaking individuals.  638   639 Conclusion 640 People with misophonia struggle with aversive reactions to everyday sounds in a modern 641 world that is filled with noise. This experience can be psychologically distressing, socially 642 isolating, and since misophonia is not yet recognized in diagnostic manuals, difficult to identify 643 and manage. The results of this work will therefore not only serve to improve misophonia 644 assessment but also better understand misophonia as a clinical phenomenon and shape the 645 classification process. 646   647"
