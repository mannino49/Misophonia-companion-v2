Although there is a growing body of literature on the characteristics of the\ndisorder, the prevalence in the general population is still relatively unknown. This study therefore aims at\ndetermining the prevalence and symptom severity of misophonia in a large and representative general\npopulation sample in Germany.\nMethods\nTo examine the prevalence of misophonic sounds, misophonic reactions and misophonia severity, a\ncross-sectional population representative survey in Germany has been conducted. Participants (N = \n2.522) were questioned retrospectively about misophonic symptoms using the Amsterdam Misophonie\nScale – Revised (AMISOS-R).\nResults\nOverall 33.3% reported to be sensitive to at least one speci\u0000c misophonic sound. Within the total sample,\nsubthreshold symptoms were reported by 21.3%, mild symptoms were reported by 9.9%, moderate to\nsevere symptoms were reported by 2.1%, and severe to extreme symptoms were reported in 0.1% of\nparticipants.\nConclusion\nBased on the diverging presentations and prevalence rates of misophonic sounds, reactions and\nsymptoms according to the severity, it seems worthwhile to conceptualize misophonia as a continuous\nspectrum disorder (subthreshold, mild, moderate to severe) instead of a categorical diagnosis.\nBackground\nMisophonia is typically described as a distinct clinical syndrome of decreased tolerance for speci\u0000c\nauditory stimuli resulting in speci\u0000c physiological and emotional reactions (e.g. anger, disgust) upon\nexposure to such sounds. These misophonic sounds (often referred to as “misophonic triggers”) mostly\ninclude sounds which are directly or indirectly made by other people (e.g. chewing or scratching). These\nrepeatedly occurring sounds are usually not excessively loud [1] and are especially considered as a\ntrigger, when made by a person one knows well (e.g. a spouse) [2]. Misophonia can result in signi\u0000cant\nimpairment of daily functioning [3] as well as a decrease in quality of life [4]."

      "text": "Page 3/14Misophonia is a relatively new conceptualization of a disorder as research on this phenomenon has been\nconducted for fewer than 20 years. The disorder has not yet been classi\u0000ed as a mental, neurological or\nauditory disorder. There is, however, a strong and growing interest in misophonia among psychologists\nand psychiatrists. Especially due to the high rates of psychiatric comorbidity [5], several researchers have\nmade a case for misophonia to be classi\u0000ed as a mental disorder [6]. Although scholars agree that\nmisophonia has unique clinical characteristics with an underlying neurophysiological mechanism [3], the\ndisorder has been de\u0000ned by different criteria with heterogeneous methods and assessment tools. The\nmost prominent and often discussed sets of criteria were proposed by two different working groups. The\n\u0000rst proposed criteria [2, 7] are mostly based on observations and clinical interviews with large clinical\nsamples in the Netherlands. These criteria are frequently assessed in the literature with the validated\nassessment tool “Amsterdam Misophonia Scale” (AMISOS-S [7]; revised version: AMISOS-R [8]) which\nhas already been translated into several languages [9]. The second proposed criteria [10] were developed\nwith a small sample of adults with self-identi\u0000ed misophonia who were interviewed via teleconferencing.\nCommonalities of the proposed criteria are that both groups included angry outbursts or loss of control\nupon exposure with misophonic triggers, and that patients with misophonia view their symptoms as\nunreasonable, excessive or unappropriated. However, both common criteria have already been criticized\nbased on clinical observations [11]. In order to bring more cohesion to the growing \u0000eld of researchers\nand clinicians who are interested in getting a better understanding of misophonia, a very recent Delphi\nstudy, with a systematic literature review and a rigorous consensus-building process, including an expert\ncommittee (15 members), ought to synthesize the current \u0000ndings and compile a de\u0000nition of the\ndisorder which includes both previous conceptualizations. Their consensus de\u0000nition includes a general\ndescription of the disorder, as well as a description of the speci\u0000c triggers and reactions to misophonic\ntriggers, the in\u0000uences on misophonic reactions and the functional impairment due to the disorder.\nHowever, this new de\u0000nition and the Delphi process itself have already been criticized by another scholar\nin the \u0000eld [12].\nThe prevalence rates of misophonia have mostly been described in college student [13] and clinical\nsamples [14] or with online surveys in the general population [15]. Throughout these studies, misophonic\ntriggers and symptoms were assessed inconsistently with different assessment tools, with\nheterogeneous underlying concepts of the disorder, resulting in very differing prevalence rates [16]. For\nexample, a study in China reported misophonic symptoms in 6% of their college student sample [17],\nwhereas another study in the US reported clinically signi\u0000cant misophonia symptoms in nearly 20% of\nthe students [18], and in a study with undergraduate students in the UK even 49.1% of the participants in\ntheir online survey reported misophonic symptoms (AMISO-S questionnaire; [13]) .\nTo date, little is known about the prevalence of misophonia triggers and symptoms in the general\npopulation. To our knowledge, there are only three population based studies on the prevalence of\nmisophonia worldwide, which were conducted in Ankara, Turkey [11], in the UK [19] and in Germany [20].\nThe authors in the study in Turkey developed a misophonia interview and assessed N = 541 residents as\na representative and randomized community sample. The proposed diagnostic criteria diagnosed 12.8%\nof their participants with misophonia. They found that several variables such as female gender, being"

In the study conducted\nin UK, participants of the third wave (N = 800) were recruited via the platform “proli\u0000c.com” and\nconstituted a representative sample of the UK general population. The authors used their own measure\nbased on the misophonia criteria by Schröder et al (2013) [7] and reported a prevalence of 18% of\nbothersome misophonia in their sample. Lastly, the German study [20], which is also the most recent\nstudy (data was collected between December 2020 and March 2021), found a prevalence of participants\nwith clinically relevant scores in the AMISOS-R of 5.9% (caution: the clinical cut-off score was self-\ndeveloped, there is currently no validated score). Additionally, 2.2% of individuals ful\u0000lled the cut-off\npoints in both their measures. In sum, these \u0000rst population-based studies report quite diverse prevalence\nrates, probably due to the different measures and recruitment strategies, which signi\u0000cantly limit their\ncomparability. As a next step in the \u0000eld, we need to better understand different degrees of symptom\nseverity in the general population, instead of just cut-offs, and conduct replication studies with the\nmeasures that had been used so far.\nStudy Aim\nThe aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and degrees of severity of misophonia in a large\nand representative general population sample in Germany, using the most frequently used assessment\ntool AMISOS-R to allow for comparisons with other population-based studies, as well as with student and\nconvenience samples. Additionally, this study aims at determining prevalence differences of the\nmisophonic symptoms with regard to sociodemographic (e.g. gender, age) and psychosocial (e.g.\nmigration background) variables, and potential differences in symptoms of depression and anxiety\nregarding misophonia severity in an exploratory manner. Finally, the study will explore potential\npsychosocial and demographic factors which might in\u0000uence misophonia severity in an exploratory\nmanner. Hence, with the results of this study, we would like to contribute to our current understanding of\nmisophonia and stimulate more epidemiological research on the distribution of the disorder in the general\npopulation.\nMethods\nProcedure and Sample.\nIn cooperation with a professional demographics research institute (USUMA) a representative sample of\nthe German population (age 16–96) was collected employing a random route approach. In a \u0000rst step,\n258 German regional areas were prede\u0000ned using the reference system for representative studies in\nGermany provided by the “ADM-Sampling- System”. Next, the target households within these regional\nareas were selected according to a random route procedure. For multi-person households, one person\nwas randomly selected using the Kish selection grid technique. The population-based survey was\nconducted in the period from 3th March to 26th May 2022.

Misophonia symptoms were measured using the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale ‐ Revised\n(AMISOS ‐ R: [2]). The \u0000rst section of the questionnaire assesses speci\u0000c misophonic triggers (e.g. eating\nsounds, nasal sounds, throat sounds, etc.) and the emotions which might be evoked when hearing the\nsounds (irritation, anger, disgust, or other) via two checklists. This part of the questionnaire is an addition\nto the former AMISO-S [7]. The second section of the AMISOS-R consists of 10 items (assessment period:\n3 last 3 days) using a 4-point Likert scale with the anchors: 0 = “not”, 1 = “mild”, 2 = “moderate”, 3 =\n“severe”, 4 = “extreme” for 8 items. The range of the total scale of the AMISOS-R is 0–40, where higher\nscores indicate more severe symptoms: 0–10 = “normal to subclinical misophonia”; 11–20 = “mild\nmisophonia”; 21–30 = “moderate to severe misophonia”; 31–40 = “severe to extreme misophonia”. The\nitems in the AMISOS-R have been modi\u0000ed compared to the AMISO-S (total of 6 items) and possible\nscores in the AMISO-S range from 0 to 24 (with higher scores also indicating more severe misophonia).\nThe reliably of the AMISOS-R in the current sample was good ( α  = .89).\nPHQ-4. The Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), consisting of the subscales PHQ-2 and GAD-2, is a\nwidely used screening instrument for depressive and anxiety symptoms in the last two weeks, and is\nimplemented in clinical settings and in epidemiological studies [21]. THE PHQ-4 consists of 4 items using\na 4-point Likert scale with the anchors: 0 = “not at all”, 1 = “several days”, 2 = “more than half the days”, 3\n= “nearly every day”. The range of the total scale of the PHQ-4 is 0–12, where higher scores indicate more\nanxiety and depression symptoms (95%-thresholds at a score of 6–7). The range of the GAD-2 and PHQ-\n2 is 0–6, with 95%-thresholds at a score of 3–4 respectively [21]. The reliably of the total scale in the\ncurrent sample was good for the PHQ-4 ( α  = .88), the GAD-2 ( α  = .83) and the PHQ-2 ( α  = .79)."

This difference can be explained by the vast number of potential misophonic sounds in the Ankara\nstudy (51 sounds), compared with only seven categories of sounds in our study. In line with a study by\nJager et al. (2020) [2], with subjects with misophonia symptoms who were referred to mental health\nservices, the most frequent misophonic sounds were eating, nasal and repetitive clicking/ tapping\nsounds. The dominance of these sound categories has also been seen in online surveys with non-clinical\nsamples [10, 15, 22]. The most frequently reported misophonic emotional reaction was irritation and to a\nlesser extent anger and disgust, which are also speci\u0000cally named in the misophonia criteria by Jager et\nal (2020) [2] and the Delphi de\u0000nition [23]."

Mean scores in the\nAMISOS-R in the previous German population-based study, which has used almost the same data\ncollection strategy and a very similar population, were also higher compared with our sample. However,\nthe study by [20] did not report the speci\u0000c mean score of participants who report misophonic sounds,\nwhich makes comparability more di\u0000cult.\nIn the general population, subthreshold misophonia was reported by 21.3%, to a much lesser extend mild\n(9.9%) or moderate to extreme symptoms (2.3%). This result is similar to the reported prevalence rate of\nclinically relevant symptoms in the previous German study (5-5.8%) which found signi\u0000cantly lower\nmisophonia rates compared with the studies conducted in Turkey and UK. Although only a very small rate\nof participants actually report clinically relevant symptoms (2.3%), about every tenth person reports\nmisophonic symptoms. Furthermore, in our subsample with misophonic sounds, prevalence rates on\ndifferent severity degrees are much higher with 37.3% reporting at least mild symptoms of misophonia.\nInterestingly, only 39.8% of participants who reported misophonic triggers spend any time thinking or\navoiding these sounds, indicating that participants with misophonic triggers who do not avoid the\ntriggers might also not suffer from any impairment during the day. Taken together, the results of this\nstudy highlight the need to look at different symptom severity groups more closely, instead of simple cut-\noff scores, as this might explain the differences in prevalence rates in previous population-based studies.\nFuture research should investigate the different groups more closely regarding potential comorbid\npsychiatric symptoms or general sociodemographic characteristics to better understand the misophonia\nsymptom pro\u0000les and their treatment altogether. Ultimately, this new direction in misophonia research\ncould head towards are more dimensional, instead of a categorical, understanding of the disorder.\nRegarding psychiatric comorbidity, we found that participants reporting misophonia symptoms report\nhigher levels of depression and anxiety, which is in line with previous studies on psychiatric comorbidities\nof misophonia [18, 24], indicating higher vulnerability for psychiatric symptoms in patients with\nmisophonia.\nThe multiple linear regression model was signi\u0000cant but the sociodemographic and psychosocial factors\nexplained only a very small amount of variance of the misophonia symptom severity in our sample,\nwhich is similar to the previous German based study (R2 = .18; [20] ). The only signi\u0000cant predictors were\nage and household net-income, but also with very small effects. Therefore, we conclude that misophonia\nsymptoms show no substantial association with the tested sociodemographic and psychosocial factors\nand can therefore be seen as a universal phenomenon that permeates all levels of society. This \u0000nding\nalso raises the question on whether misophonia might instead have a potential genetic or even epigenetic\npathomechanism.\nLimitations And Future Research"

Since\nmisophonia has been described as a long-lasting disorder [3], future population based studies might\nconsider including a longer time period. Secondly, although the questionnaire assesses the most\nprominently described misophonic triggers, more elaborate trigger lists [8] might be used in future\nresearch to better understand the frequency and combinations of speci\u0000c sounds, and to help\ndiscriminate those sounds with misophonic reactions from those without misophonic reactions. Thirdly,\ndue to the study design and assessment, only participants age 16 and older were included in this study,\nwhich is also the case in the study by Jakubovsky et al., 2022 [20]. Especially since the onset of\nmisophonia is most often in childhood/ adolescence [7, 15, 22], and there are only limited studies with\nchildren and adolescents on their misophonia symptoms [4], future research needs to include children\nand adolescents in population based surveys to better describe the phenomenology and clinical\ncorrelates of misophonia in children and adolescents. This might be especially important, as there is\nalready some evidence that children with misophonia report poorer well-being and life satisfaction,\ncompared with children without misophonia [4]. Fourthly, when this study was conducted, the Delphi\npaper has not yet been published so we decided to use the measures AMISOS-R, which is most often\nused in the current literature to increase comparability with other studies. Future studies might assess\nmisophonia in light of the newly proposed criteria in the Delphi process, though. Future steps after the\nDelphi process will be to discuss these new criteria within the scienti\u0000c community and to then develop\nand validate a measure based on the \u0000nal criteria. Lastly, since misophonia is a rather new discovered\nphenomenon, it might be helpful for the \u0000eld to gather more qualitative data on the patient’s experiences\nand learn from their individual perspective on the symptomatology. Within quantitative research, (semi-\nstructured) interviews might provide the \u0000eld with a more thorough description of the symptoms,\ncompared with standardized questionnaires [11].\nConclusions\nIn the absence of a common understanding of the disorder, resulting in different diagnostic criteria and\nassessment tools, this epidemiological study might shed more light on misophonic sounds and\nsymptoms in the general population and stimulate more population-based surveys in other countries to\nbetter understand different cultural and societal in\u0000uences on the disorder. Based on the diverging\nprevalence rates of misophonia triggers and symptom severity scores in this study, and the comparably\nlow percentage of people spending time to avoid misophonic triggers at all, it seems worthwhile to\nconsider misophonia as a somewhat dimensional disorder after all, instead of a categorical discrete\ndisorder based on a cut-off score.\nAbbreviations\nAMISOS-S=Amsterdam Misophonia Scale\nAMISOS-R= Amsterdam Misophonia Scale Revised"
