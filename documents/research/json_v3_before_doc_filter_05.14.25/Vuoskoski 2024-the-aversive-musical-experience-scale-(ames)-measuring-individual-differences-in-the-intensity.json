      "text": "2 Psychology of Music 00(0)\nMusic plays an important role in many people’s emotional lives. In fact, music’s emotional \neffects are often cited as one of  the most common reasons for people to engage with music in the first place (Juslin & Sloboda, 2010). An impressive number of  empirical studies have demon-strated that music-evoked emotions can be highly pleasurable and musical engagement has been shown to entail many positive and even therapeutic dimensions (Baltazar & Saarikallio, 2019; Eerola & Vuoskoski, 2013; Koelsch, 2018; MacDonald et al., 2012; Sloboda & Juslin, 2010). Because of  this positive emphasis on emotional wellbeing, music and ill-being has gained very little scientific attention until quite recently .\nAlthough music can help an individual to dispel negative emotions and feelings of  aggres-\nsion, it also has the potential to promote or intensify adverse affective states (Wölfl, 2019). According to preliminary evidence, disliked music can evoke strong physical reactions and negative emotions, which can lead to aggression, anxiety , or paralyzing feelings, depending on the listener (Peltola & Vuoskoski, 2022). Furthermore, since musical preferences build heavily on aesthetic value judgments, they have an inherent social dimension that encompasses learned ideals and beliefs. Thus, disliked music can function as a tool for discriminating the “out-group” from the “in-group,” which is likely to promote the cohesion between people who share certain musical preferences; at the same time, the listeners of  “the other music” can be discriminated against (Ackermann & Merrill, 2022). Music that violates a person’s aesthetic or moral ideals can be associated with people who listen to this music. Involuntary engagement with this kind of  music can, in the worst case, lead to aggressive behavior toward the associated people or the (sub)culture they are thought to represent (Frank, 2007; Peltola & Vuoskoski, 2022). These kinds of  aversive responses to disliked music can lead to listeners’ own conceptu-alizations of  aversive music. Aversive music consists of  complex layers of  meaning, encompass-ing physical responses to musical sounds, music preference, and cultural and social connotations associated with disliked music, and the definitions of  the specific attributes of  any of  these lay-ers depend on the individual listener. We use the concepts aversive music and musical aversion when referring to strongly disliked music and music-evoked aversive experiences, respectively .\nAlthough musical aversion seems to be a serious and even adverse experience to some indi-\nviduals, not all listeners react to music as strongly . In our previous study (Peltola & Vuoskoski, 2022), we identified two listener types: one with a strong negative attitude toward aversive music and another with a more neutral attitude. Because of  the qualitative research approach adopted in the study in question, we could not identify background variables that would poten-tially explain these differences between the respondents. Thus, a more generalizable scientific investigation exploring the various aspects of  aversive music engagement is necessary , since we do not quite understand when, how, or why music can have such strong, negative effects on some listeners. Furthermore, existing scales aiming to measure individual differences in music preferences and affective responses to music, such as the Short Test Of  Music Preferences (STOMP; Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003), the Healthy-Unhealthy Music Scale (HUMS; Saarikallio et al., 2015), or the Music Use and Background Questionnaire (MUSEBAQ; Chin et al., 2017) do not capture aversive reactions to music. To address this gap, the present study aims to inves-tigate individual differences in the intensity of  music-evoked aversion and proposes the Aversive Musical Experience Scale (AMES) for further measuring these experiences.\nEmotional contagion and music\nAs briefly mentioned earlier, there is a substantial degree of  variability in how individuals respond to music. Research aiming to explain interindividual variability in emotional responses to music has discovered a number of  individual difference variables, such as trait empathy and"

Emotional conta-gion is a phenomenon where an individual “catches” the emotional state of  another spontane-ously (often without conscious awareness), resulting in emotional “convergence” between individuals (e.g., Hatfield et al., 1993). Emotional contagion can occur between individuals, within large groups, and even between music and the listener (e.g., Egermann & McAdams, 2012; Juslin & Västfjäll, 2008; Vuoskoski & Eerola, 2012).\nEmotional contagion often involves unconscious mimicry of  others’ facial expressions, body \npostures, and body and speech gestures, and internal feedback from the activated muscles is thought to lead to changes in subjective emotional experience (Hatfield et al., 1993). More rel-evantly for music listening, this motor mimicry can also take the form of  embodied simulation of  emotion concepts, where congruent facial expressions can be elicited by exposure to words with emotional connotations, for example (Niedenthal et al., 2009). Indeed, music listening has also been shown to elicit facial muscle activations that are congruent with the music’s emotional expression in the absence of  any visual information about the performers’ facial expressions (e.g., Lundqvist et al., 2009). However, it should be noted that since music listening is also able to activate premotor areas related to vocal sound production (Koelsch et al., 2006) as well as larger-scale motor circuits (e.g., Alluri et al., 2012; Koelsch, 2011) in the absence of  overt singing or movement, it is possible that music listening also involves some degree of  inter -\nnal simulation of  actual motor actions/gestures perceived in the music.\nWhile experiencing contagious positive emotions may be desirable, being susceptible to neg-\native emotional contagion can sometimes have adverse effects on wellbeing: High emotional contagion has been associated with heightened stress, depression, and risk of  burnout when exposed to stressful situations or environments (Petitta & Jiang, 2020; Prikhidko et al., 2020). In the context of  music listening, those with a heightened tendency to experience emotional contagion across a variety of  situations have been shown to experience more intense sadness in response to sad music (Eerola et al., 2016; Vuoskoski and Eerola, 2017). Thus, it is possible that those prone to experiencing emotional contagion may sometimes experience music expressing strong negative emotions (such as anger or aggression; see Thompson et al., 2019) as aversive due to the contagion of  these negative emotions. It may also be that listeners with high emo-tional contagion may be more sensitive to music that involves unpleasant visual or semantic content (e.g., lyrics) or musical cues that are expressive of  emotions that the listener finds unpleasant to experience.\nSensitivity to sounds\nIt has been proposed that aversion to musical sounds is at least partially context-dependent, since exposure and familiarization to certain frequencies and high volume within a specific musical genre, for instance, can modify listeners’ perception of  them (e.g., Dermott, 2012). Nevertheless, musical sounds are sounds with specific physical and acoustic qualities, with concomitant effects on the listener. Some people are more sensitive to sounds in general, having a decreased sound tolerance, which can have multiple negative effects on their everyday lives (Baguley , 2003; Jastreboff  & Jastreboff, 2015). Although no systematic evidence has yet been documented between sound-sensitivity and the enjoyment/dislike of  music, individual differ -\nences at the neural level might partly explain why some listeners react more strongly to music compared with others.\nAccording to Sachs et al. (2016), people who experience more intense emotions in response to \nmusic have stronger white matter connectivity between neural regions involved in sensory and"

The most visible reactions to music are musical chills, or fris-\nson (Sloboda, 1991), which is a psychophysiological phenomenon that has gained plenty of  sci-\nentific interest. According to Goldstein’s (1980) definition, the experience of  frisson consists of  a pleasurable tingling sensation in the area of  the upper spine and back of  the neck; it can spread upward over the scalp, outward over the shoulders, arms, and down the spine. Frisson can be accompanied by evident “goose bumps,” especially on the arms. Other physical reactions, such as tears, lump-in-the-throat, and muscle tension/relaxation can co-occur with or be included in fris-son (see Harrison & Loui, 2014). Although music seems to be the most common frisson-produc-ing stimulus (Goldstein, 1980; Grewe et al., 2007; Guhn et al., 2007; Panksepp, 1995), other sounds, social interaction, and visual stimuli can also cause aesthetic chills. For instance, experi-enced beauty within the contexts of  nature, art, film, poetry , and religion can elicit frisson as a part of  private or shared experiences associated with peak pleasure and being moved (Bannister, 2019; Goldstein, 1980). Chills can be also induced through other tactile and gustatory stimula-tion, and even by mental self-stimulation without any external stimulus (Grewe et al., 2011).\nIn addition to frisson, other types of  bodily reactions to sounds can feel pleasurable. \nAutonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a term that has gone viral on social media among people who report experiencing pleasurable bodily feelings and “tingling” feelings in response to “triggering” sounds and/or visual stimuli. Typical ASMR triggers include whisper -\ning, lip smacking, speaking softly , “crisp sounds,” tapping on different kinds of  surfaces, and slow hand movements (del Campo & Kehle, 2016; McGeoch & Rouw, 2020; Poerio et  al., 2018; Tuuri & Peltola, 2019). Despite the fact that ASMR and frisson seem to be somewhat distinct experiences (Fredborg et al., 2018; Roberts et al., 2020), they share similarities when it comes to physiological and psychological mechanisms. According to neuroscientific evi-dence, both ASMR and frisson show some similar neural activation patterns, specifically increased activation of  the insula and anterior cingulate cortex, which are involved in detect-ing and selecting emotionally relevant information (Blood & Zatorre, 2001; Lochte et  al., 2018). Both frisson and ASMR have been associated with specific personality traits, especially openness to experience, although, simultaneously , ASMR is also associated with neuroticism (Colver & El-Alayli, 2016; Fredborg et al., 2017). Poerio et al. (2022) proposed that similarly to intense emotional responses to music, ASMR may also be associated with individual differ -\nences in how sensory inputs and emotional experiences are integrated at the neural level. In their recent study , Poerio et al. (2022) found connections between ASMR and the heightened sensitivity to sensory and environmental stimuli (including external and internal cues; the social environment, e.g., other people’s moods; and responses to aesthetic stimuli), further suggesting that ASMR and strong emotional responses to music might indeed be connected.\nA third phenomenon that shares similarities with frisson and ASMR is misophonia, which \ncan be defined as “aversive reactions to particular sounds and the events that generate those sounds” that are not commonly considered to be negative or aversive to the general population (Mednicoff  et al., 2022). Although misophonia seems quite in contrast to the pleasurable sen-sations of  ASMR, they are often experienced by the same individuals, which suggests that they both might be underpinned by a heightened sensitivity to external sensory stimuli, particularly sounds (Poerio et al., 2022). Furthermore, they can both be triggered by similar stimuli, typi-cally repetitive, human-made sounds (McGeoch & Rouw, 2020; Mednicoff  et al., 2022) that can evoke pleasure in some listeners and aversion in others (del Campo & Kehle, 2016). Unlike hyperacusis, which is often defined as a disorder of  loudness perception or heightened noise sensitivity , misophonic reactions can be triggered by both loud and very soft everyday sounds (Baguley , 2003; Baliatsas et  al., 2016; Jastreboff  & Jastreboff, 2015). Misophonia has been linked to autistic traits and poorer emotion regulation abilities; Rinaldi et al. (2023) propose"

Misophonia seems to be associated with heightened neural activity similar to that associated with frisson and ASMR (Kumar et al., 2017; Schröder et al., 2019), and all three phenomena have been associated with increased skin conductance and heart rate (see Mednicoff  et al., 2022). Since both ASMR and misophonia triggers bear a resemblance to certain qualities asso-ciated with aversive singing voices (Ackermann & Merrill, 2022; Peltola & Vuoskoski, 2022), it can be postulated that these two phenomena might also be linked with increased sensitivity to aversive musical experiences.\nThe present study\nPrevious studies on aversive and disliked music have relied on qualitative research approaches and limited samples of  participants. Although these studies have provided valuable descrip-tions of  listeners’ experiences, more generalizable approaches are needed for investigating indi-vidual differences potentially predicting strong aversion to disliked music. The main aim of  this study was to explore these individual differences using a wider and more diverse sample of  participants. With this goal in mind, we set out to develop a standardized questionnaire to measure the intensity of  aversive musical experiences. Furthermore, in order to explore the hypothesized predictors and potential underlying mechanisms of  music-induced aversion—such as emotional contagion and a general sensitivity to sounds—we also measured trait emo-tional contagion, misophonia, proneness to ASMR and frisson, and personality . We hypothesized that emotional contagion, sensitivity to sounds (misophonia and proneness to ASMR and fris-son), and personality traits associated with negative emotionality (i.e., neuroticism) would be positively associated with the intensity of  music-evoked aversion.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA total of  354 participants completed an online survey hosted on the Qualtrics platform. Native \nEnglish speakers living in the United Kingdom were recruited via the Prolific participant recruit-ment service. In addition, native Finnish speakers were recruited via both Prolific and social media channels (Twitter and Facebook). The Prolific participants were paid £2.50 for complet-ing the survey , and the participants that were recruited via social media channels were entered into a lottery for a gift card worth 100 €. To filter out poor quality data, mean interrater correla-tions were calculated for each participant (separately for the English and Finnish language responses). Participants with mean interrater correlations more than 2 SD below average were removed from the data, resulting in the removal of  16 participants. The final sample consisted of  338 participants (232 British and 106 Finnish) aged 16–87 (M = 40.32, SD = 13.55), out of  \nwhom 218 were female, 117 male, and 3 non-binary .\nThe AMES\nThe development of  a preliminary selection of  items for measuring aversive musical experi-ences was informed by the qualitative data of  our previous study (Peltola & Vuoskoski, 2022).

The free descriptions of  102 \nFinnish participants were used as the starting point for formulating statements about the experience of  listening to aversive music. We aimed to maintain a balance between statements describing strong, negative experiences and those with a more neutral tone. The original list of  statements in Finnish was reviewed by both authors and a research assistant, who were all native Finnish speakers. After removing items with too much overlap, the preliminary version of  the AMES comprised 46 statements, 5 of  which were reversely scored. These statements were independently translated into English by the first author and a research assistant, both proficient in English, and discrepancies between the translations were discussed and adjusted. Finally , the translated items were reviewed by a native English speaker and the suggested minor edits were reviewed and approved by the first author. Rather than merely translating the final scale to English, our aim was to develop both Finnish and English versions of  the AMES concurrently , ensuring that the most consistent and reliable items across translations and samples would get included in the final scale. Full versions of  all 46 items, as well as the final AMES scale in both Finnish and English, can be found in the supplementary materials (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF .IO/VRNF A). In the scale instructions, aversive music was defined as “strongly disliked music.” Each of  the statements were rated on a 5-point Likert scale, where 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = somewhat disagree, 3 = neither agree nor disagree, 4 = some-\nwhat agree, and 5 = strongly agree.\nSurvey\nParticipants completed the survey online using the Qualtrics platform. In addition to the pre-liminary version of  AMES, participants completed a set of  standardized questionnaires meas-uring personality traits and other individual differences:\nMisophonia.  The Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014) is a 17-item questionnaire \nmeasuring the symptoms, emotions, and behaviors related to misophonia. The MQ comprises \ntwo subscales: the Misophonia Symptom Scale, and the Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors Scale. In the present study , the combined score was used.\nEmotional contagion.  The Emotional Contagion Scale (ECS; Doherty , 1997) has 15 items that tap \ninto the susceptibility to “catch” others’ emotions, and measures the tendency to experience \nhappiness, sadness, fear, anger, and love through contagion. In the present study , the combined score was used.\nPersonality.  The Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI; Gosling et al., 2003) is a very short meas-\nure of  the Big Five personality traits: extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientious-\nness, and openness to experience (2 items each).\nASMR.  The experience of  ASMR was measured using a question developed by Rouw and \nErfanian (2018), which was slightly modified for the present study to include the word \n“relaxing”:\nDo you ever experience a relaxing, pleasurable tingling sensation in the head, scalp, back, or peripheral \nregions of  the body (e.g., hands and/or feet) in response to visual, auditory , tactile, olfactory , or cognitive stimuli? (for example, experiencing a strong, desirable tingling sensation when someone is \nwhispering in your ear or rubbing fingers on a rough surface)."

The tendency to experience music-induced chills was measured using two \nquestions modified from Bannister (2020): “Do you ever experience pleasurable chills (shivers \ndown the spine, gooseflesh and/or tingling sensations) when listening to music? (Yes/No).” If  participants responded “Yes,” the question was followed by: “How often do you experience these music-induced chills? (every few months/monthly/weekly/daily/every time I listen to music).” The responses were coded 0 for “No,” and 1–5 for the different frequency options.\nDemographics.  We also included questions about the participants’ age, gender (male/female/\nother), and musical expertise. Musical expertise was measured using one question from the Ollen \nMusical Sophistication Index (Ollen, 2006): “Which title best describes you? (nonmusician/music-loving nonmusician/amateur musician/serious amateur musician/semi-professional musician/professional musician),” which has been validated as a single-item measure of  musical expertise (Zhang & Schubert, 2019). The response options were scored on a scale from 1 to 6.\nAnalysis\nFor all analyses, the British data was combined with the Finnish data. The aim of  this decision was to facilitate the selection of  the most consistent and reliable items across translations and samples. The ratings on reverse-scored items were converted before analysis. As a first step in item selection, an exploratory factor analysis was carried out to explore item covariances and the underlying dimensionality of  the data. Items were selected for further analysis based on factor loadings and interpretability . To enable the cross-validation of  the factor structure using confirmatory factor analysis (CF A), the data were split into two random samples of  n = 169 (from here on Subsamples 1 and 2). Subsample 1 was used for exploratory factor analysis, and Subsample 2 for CF A. Finally , predictors of  individual differences in the final AMES scores were explored in the entire sample using regression analyses. The data were preprocessed in MATLAB, and statistical analyses were carried out in JASP (version 0.16.3; JASP Team 2022), MATLAB, and SPSS Statistics (version 29). Data and supplementary materials are provided in the OSF repository; https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF .IO/VRNF A.\nResults\nExploratory factor analysis\nAn exploratory factor analysis was carried out on the responses of  Subsample 1 to the 46 AMES \nitems, using principal component analysis with Promax rotation as the extraction method. An oblique rotation method was selected because the components were expected to be correlated. The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measure of  sampling adequacy was .87, well above the threshold of  .60 required for a good factor analysis (see Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). The number of  compo-nents to be retained in the model was determined using parallel analysis. The analysis yielded six components explaining 53% of  the variance (see Figure 1 for the scree plot). Since the num-ber of  items is positively related to the (future) reliability of  a factor, components with fewer than six items satisfying the initial retention criteria (factor loading >.4 and cross-loadings <.4) were discarded from further consideration (see e.g., Worthington and Whittaker, 2006)."

There was no significant difference in \nSocial scores. Next, we explored whether those who reported experiencing ASMR also reported experiencing more intense musical aversion compared with those who do not experience ASMR. Independent samples t -tests did not reveal any significant differences in total AMES scores or its \nsubscales. We further explored whether ASMR experiences are related to sensitivity/reactions to sounds more generally (i.e., misophonia and music-induced chills). Independent samples t -tests \nrevealed significant differences in both misophonia, t (336) = −3.36, p < .001, d = −0.38 and the \nfrequency of  music-induced chills, t (336) = −2.21, p = .028, d = −0.25, with those who experi-\nence ASMR scoring higher. The distributions of  the scores are shown in Figure 3.\nUsing multiple regression analysis, we explored predictors of  interindividual differences in \nthe intensity of  aversive musical experiences. Furthermore, this enabled us to investigate the convergent validity of  the AMES in comparison to the Misophonia Questionnaire. As a first step, we explored Pearson correlations between the AMES scales (AMES total, Sensations, Social, and Features) and misophonia (MQ), emotional contagion (ECS), personality traits (TIPI), age, musical expertise, and the frequency of  music-induced chills (see Table 3 for the correlations with AMES scales, and Table S2 in the supplementary material for the intercor -\nrelations between all variables). Since the correlation coefficients serve a descriptive purpose here (i.e., significant predictors of  AMES will be tested in subsequent regression analyses), we have not adjusted the p -values for multiple tests. Misophonia had the highest correlations with \nthe total AMES (r  = .54) and all its subscales (r s = .39 to .47), followed by emotional contagion \n(rs = .13 to .34) and neuroticism (r s = .16 to .27). Since the Features subscale had the lowest \ninternal consistency , we also investigated Spearman correlations between individual differ -\nence variables and the individual items (see Table S3 in the supplementary material for the coefficients). Misophonia correlated significantly with all six individual items, ECS with four, and neuroticism with three out of  six items.\nWe proceeded by carrying out four stepwise regression analyses to explore the best unique \npredictors of  AMES and its three subscales based on purely mathematical criteria. As predic-tors, we entered personality traits (extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientious-ness, and openness to experience), emotional contagion, misophonia, musical expertise, frequency of  music-induced chills, and age. The explanation rates (adjusted R\n2) in the four \nmodels ranged from 20% to 35% and the number of  significant predictors from 3 to 5. Misophonia, emotional contagion, age, neuroticism, and openness to experience explained 35% of  the variance in total AMES scores. Misophonia emerged as the best predictor for all subscales, followed by emotional contagion (with the exception of  the Social subscale). The \nmodel summaries are presented in Table 4.\nSince stepwise regression analysis is prone to Type I errors, we also carried out confirmatory \nregression analyses using the Enter-method, including dummy-coded variables for gender and ASMR experiences (dummy-coded variables could not be included in the stepwise models). The model summaries are presented in Table 5. Misophonia and emotional contagion remained the most significant predictors also in the confirmatory regression analyses that included all pre-dictors. Age remained a significant predictor of  total AMES and Features scores, and musical expertise remained a significant predictor of  Sensations scores. Personality traits remained sig-nificant predictors of  Social (neuroticism and agreeableness) and Features (agreeableness, open-\nness to experience, and extraversion) scores, but not of  global AMES scores.

(Continued)\nopenness to experience were significant predictors of  global AMES in the stepwise regression \nmodel (but not in the Enter model), while extraversion was not a significant predictor of  Features scores in the stepwise regression model. Additionally , ASMR experiences emerged as a signifi-cant (negative) predictor of  total AMES, Social, and Features scores, and female gender emerged as a significant (negative) predictor of  Social scores.\nDiscussion\nThis study set out to develop a new measure of  individual differences in the intensity of  music-induced aversion, the AMES, and to explore the predictors of  these individual differences. Based on the results of  exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses a final 18-item version of  AMES was constructed. The global AMES comprises three subscales: Sensations, Social, and Features. The Sensations subscale taps into feelings and bodily sensations evoked by aversive music, while \nthe Social subscale measures reactions and attitudes related to people that are somehow associ-\nated with aversive music. Finally , the Features subscale taps into specific musical and acoustic \nfeatures that are experienced as aversive.\nMisophonia emerged as the strongest predictor of  global AMES and its three subscales, \nexplaining 9%–19% (adj. R\n2 change) of  the interindividual variance in the scales in the step-\nwise regression models. This can be considered a large effect in the context of  individual dif-ferences research, where effects above r  = .30 (i.e., R\n2 = .09) are considered large (e.g., Gignac \n& Szodorai, 2016). The finding is in line with our hypothesis on general sound sensitivity at least partially explaining the susceptibility to music-evoked aversion. However, proneness to ASMR or chills experiences were not significantly associated with AMES or its subscales in the t-test or stepwise regression analysis (respectively). In the confirmatory regression analy-\nsis (where all predictor variables were included in the model), ASMR actually emerged as a negative predictor of  global AMES and the Social and Features subscales. The frequency of  \nchills experiences did correlate positively with the Sensations subscale (r  = .14, p < .01), but \ndid not emerge as a significant predictor in the regression models, potentially due to overlap-ping variance explained by better predictors such as emotional contagion, misophonia, and"

Since misophonia by definition relates to aversive reactions to sounds, \nand ASMR and chills are typically defined as pleasurable experiences, it appears that aversive responses to music are specifically associated with a sensitivity to sound-evoked aversion rather than a general responsivity to sounds.\nIn line with our hypothesis, emotional contagion also emerged as a significant predictor of  \nAMES and two of  its subscales, accounting for 2%–4% of  unique variance (in the stepwise regression models) in global AMES, Sensations, and Features scores. It is possible that those scor -\ning high in emotional contagion have difficulties in regulating or inhibiting the contagion of  negative emotions from music, and thus can experience music expressing strong negative emo-tions as aversive. This interpretation is in line with the findings of  Thompson et al. (2019), who found that empathic concern—a facet of  trait empathy that is strongly correlated with trait emotional contagion (e.g., Lo Coco et al., 2014)—was a negative predictor of  positive emotions (power and joy) evoked by violent death metal music. In contrast, power and joy were the strongest emotions experienced by fans of  death metal (Thompson et al., 2019).\nThe personality traits of  agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness to experience emerged \nas significant predictors of  aversive musical experiences in both the stepwise and enter regression models. Agreeableness and openness to experience were significant (negative) pre-dictors of  Features scores (accounting for 1% and 3% of  the variance in the stepwise regres-sion model, respectively), while neuroticism was a positive and agreeableness a negative predictor of  Social scores (each accounting for 1% of  variance). Neuroticism is typically defined as the tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety , worry , and tension (e.g., Reisenzein & Weber, 2009) and thus in the present study we hypothesized that neuroti-cism would also be associated with the intensity of  aversive musical experiences. However, although neuroticism correlated positively with total AMES and all its subscales, it only emerged as a significant predictor of  Social scores, potentially due to overlapping variance explained by misophonia and emotional contagion. Agreeableness, on the contrary , is a prosocial trait characterized by kindness, tender-mindedness, and a tendency to be less anger-prone (e.g., Kuppens, 2005), while openness to experience is understood as the tendency to be imaginative and curious, to have wide interests, and to appreciate aesthetic experiences (e.g., John & Srivastava, 1999).\nIn line with the findings of  the present study , Thompson and colleagues (2019) found that, \nin addition to empathic concern, also neuroticism was inversely (and openness to experience positively) associated with the feelings of  power and joy elicited by violent death metal, suggest-ing that listeners scoring high in neuroticism may also experience music that expresses strong negative emotions as aversive. Agreeableness was a negative predictor of  Features and Social scores, suggesting that listeners scoring high in agreeableness experience less intense music-induced aversion and less aggression toward people associated with aversive music. These find-ings are in line with studies linking agreeableness to the tendency to be less anger-prone and to control negative emotions in communication situations (Kuppens, 2005; Tobin et al., 2000). Finally , openness to experience has previously been associated with a preference for diverse and complex music styles (Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003), as well as for music expressing negative emo-tions (such as sadness and fear; Vuoskoski & Eerola, 2011). Our findings support the view of  openness to experience as a trait associated with wide interests and curiosity that also extend to the musical domain.\nIn addition to specific trait measures and variables related to sound-sensitivity , we also \nexplored the relations between demographic variables and music-induced aversive experiences. Age was a significant positive predictor of  global AMES and Features scores, suggesting that music-induced aversive experiences become more intense with increasing age. Age has"

Based on these findings, our results could potentially be explained by an overall decrease in music-evoked enjoyment associated with age and/or an increasing discrep-ancy between one’s musical preferences and mainstream popular music typically played in public places. While we found significant differences between males and females with respect to global AMES, Sensations, and Features scores (with females scoring higher than males), female gender only emerged as a significant (negative) predictor of  Social scores when other individual \ndifference variables were accounted for. This suggests that, with the exception of  Social scores, surface-level gender differences in aversive musical experiences are accounted for by better pre-dictors such as misophonia and/or emotional contagion. Finally , musical expertise was a sig-nificant predictor of  Sensations scores, suggesting that those with more musical training experience more intense bodily sensations and negative feelings in response to aversive music.\nLimitations, implications, and future directions\nThe current study has some limitations that are worth acknowledging and discussing. First, the scale development was based on a qualitative dataset collected from a somewhat homoge-neous sample of  WEIRD (see Henrich et al., 2010) Finnish participants. Due to voluntary participation, the sample may have been biased and thus not representative of  the phenom-enon in the general population, which may have further skewed the results of  our previous qualitative analysis and the selection of  statements for the present study . However, the sam-ple size was rather large for a qualitative study (> 100 participants), which provides broader \ninsights into the phenomenon compared with the more limited samples of  informants that are typical in studies that use qualitative inquiry for scale development. Furthermore, we aimed to limit the sample selection bias in our present study by offering remuneration for participation and by combining two samples collected in two languages from two different countries. Nevertheless, we ended up with a somewhat imbalanced gender distribution in our sample (64.5% female), which has some implications for the generalizability of  findings. Participant remuneration may also have implications for data quality , since some partici-pants may complete the survey quickly and superficially only to receive the monetary reward. In the present study , data quality was screened using mean interrater correlations. Furthermore, data collected via the Prolific platform (which were used in the present study to recruit most of  the participants) have been shown to have better quality compared with other online platforms (e.g., Douglas et al., 2023; Eyal et al., 2022).\nSecond, the factor structure of  the final AMES bears resemblance to some of  the final themes \nof  our previous qualitative analysis (“Material,” “Embodied experience,” and “ Autobiographical aspects,” see Peltola & Vuoskoski, 2022). Although this might raise critical questions concern-ing circular argumentation and logical fallacy , we interpret the findings in the context of  a cir -\ncular reasoning process (Park et al., 2020), which entails building up a strategic sequence of  complementary research methodologies for more robust findings. Moreover, the results of  the factor analysis are also in line with the findings of  Ackermann and Merrill (2022), further sug-gesting that there may be conceptual similarities between the expressions that people use to describe aversive musical experiences, even when they speak different languages.\nFinally , since our participants were retrospectively reporting their experiences, it might have \naffected their evaluations concerning the intensity of  their experiences.

In the future, such research designs could be used to evaluate the predictive utility of  the AMES with respect to physiological indices of  music-induced stress responses.\nWe aimed to explain individual differences in the intensity of  music-induced aversion, but it \nis possible that in addition to personality traits, misophonia, ASMR, and frisson, other traits or tendencies might have explained further interindividual variance in the phenomenon. For instance, general irritability , which is a trait associated with lowered thresholds for temper loss and a tendency to experience anger and negative moods (e.g., Deveney et al., 2019), may also be associated with the intensity of  music-evoked aversive experiences. Irritability is often con-sidered as one of  the subcomponents of  neuroticism (e.g., DeYoung et al., 2007), and in the present study neuroticism emerged as a significant predictor of  AMES Social scores. However, since personality was here measured using the brief  TIPI (Gosling et al., 2003), we were unable to explore how the various sub-facets of  neuroticism relate to aversive musical experiences. Future studies should ideally utilize longer and more reliable measures of  the Big Five personal-ity traits to further investigate these aspects. Furthermore, Poerio et al. (2022) recently found that interoceptive sensitivity and bodily awareness predicted ASMR intensity , and that people with these kinds of  sensory sensitivities were also more likely to be classified as highly sensitive persons (HSP). Although in our study ASMR emerged as a negative predictor, interoceptive sensitivity , bodily awareness, and HSP could be interesting traits to look into when exploring strong aversive music experiences further, since sensitive individuals are more reactive to both positive and negative aspects of  their environment (Poerio et al., 2022).\nFuture studies on music-evoked aversive experiences should also investigate individual dif-\nferences in musical reward sensitivity (see, for example, Belfi & Loui, 2020; Mas-Herrero et al., 2012). The lack of  a negative correlation between AMES scores and the tendency to experience pleasurable music-induced chills suggest that the intensity of  music-evoked aversive experience is not related to musical anhedonia (i.e., a lack of  pleasure from music; Belfi & Loui, 2020), but this should be directly investigated in future studies. For instance, it could be that specific kinds of  musical reward—as measured by the Barcelona Musical Reward Questionnaire (BMRQ; Mas-Herrero et al., 2012), for example—could be associated with the intensity of  music-evoked aversion. Similarly , the positive association between musical expertise and AMES Sensations scores suggests that amusia (i.e., selective difficulties in music processing; Peretz, 2016) is unlikely to offer a viable explanation for aversive musical experiences, but this possibility can-not be ruled out without direct investigation.\nFindings of  this study provide a novel perspective on music-evoked emotional responses, \nwhich is relevant for various fields and future research. Studying aversive responses to music is crucial for gaining a holistic understanding of  the range of  affective effects that music has on people. In the future, the AMES could be used to investigate whether the people who report experiencing strong musical aversion also experience more arousal and stress at the physiologi-cal level when hearing aversive music. Moreover, the potential implications of  music-evoked aversion for eliciting antisocial attitudes and/or behaviors (such as withdrawal or aggression) should be addressed in future studies using experimental and survey methods. This line of  work would be important for gaining a better understanding of  the potentially stress-inducing and socially destructive qualities of  background music in public places, for instance. Although we did not investigate participants’ mental health in the present study , it is possible that those who are sensitive to music-evoked aversion have a higher risk for anxiety or depression, for example, since previous studies have found a positive association between misophonia and these mental health disorders (e.g., Beutel et  al., 2016; Erfanian et  al., 2019; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018;"

In the future, the potential links between sensitivity to music-evoked \naversion and mental health should be investigated more thoroughly , especially since intense and frequent experiences of  musical aversion may contribute to social isolation. These future studies could also shed light on the applicability of  the AMES as a screening tool for identifying individuals who are at risk for mental health disorders. Nevertheless, it is important to recog-nize that, in addition to the numerous benefits for individuals’ wellbeing, music can also have adverse effects on some listeners.\nFurthermore, since misophonia has some links to autistic traits (Rinaldi et al., 2023), it is \npossible that the same also applies to musical aversion. Although not all autistic people have misophonia, and not all people with misophonia are autistic, the links between these two neurally-based phenomena should be further studied. Investigating whether aversive responses to music are more common among neurodivergent listeners compared with more neurotypical ones could provide important insights into both the musical experiences and the wellbeing of  neurodivergent people.\nConclusion\nThis study developed a new tool for measuring individual differences in the intensity of  music-evoked aversion: the AMES, measuring the feelings, bodily sensations, social experiences, and musical features associated with aversive musical experiences. Misophonia and sensitivity to emotional contagion emerged as the strongest predictors of  interindividual differences in the intensity of  music-evoked aversion, followed by personality , age, and musical expertise. Aversive responses to music appear to be specifically associated with a susceptibility to sound-evoked aversion rather than a general responsivity to sounds.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or \npublication of this article: This work was partially supported by the Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence scheme, project number 262762.\nORCID iDs\nJonna K.
