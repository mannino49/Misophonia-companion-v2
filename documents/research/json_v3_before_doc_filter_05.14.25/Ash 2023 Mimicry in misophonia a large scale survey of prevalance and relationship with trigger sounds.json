  "abstract": "Background Misophonia is often referred to as a disorder that is characterized by excessive negative emotional responses, including anger and anxiety, to 'trigger sounds' which are typically day-to-day sounds, such as those generated from people eating, chewing, and breathing. Misophonia (literally 'hatred of sounds') has commonly been understood within an auditory processing framework where sounds cause distress due to aberrant processing in the auditory and emotional systems of the brain. However, recent evidence from brain imaging showing involvement of the motor system while listening to trigger sounds suggests that it is the perception of action (e.g., mouth movement) of the trigger person, and not the sounds per se, that drives the distress in misophonia. Since observation or listening to sounds of actions of others are known to prompt automatic mimicry/imitations in perceivers, we hypothesized that mimicking the action of the trigger person may be prevalent in misophonia. Apart from a few case studies and anecdotal information, a relation between mimicking and misophonia has not been systematically evaluated. Method In this work, we addressed this limitation by collecting data on misophonia symptoms and mimicry behaviour using online questionnaires from 676 participants. Results Analysis of these data shows that (i) the tendency to mimic varies in direct proportion to misophonia severity assessed using a self-reported questionnaire, (ii) compared to other human and environmental sounds, trigger sounds of eating and chewing are more likely to trigger mimicking, and (iii) the act of mimicking provides relief from distress to most people with misophonia. Conclusion This study shows that mimicry is widely prevalent in misophonia and is elicited by the most common trigger sounds of eating and chewing.

The data provides support to the model that \nmisophonia is not a disorder of sound -processing but rather its basis lies in social perception.  \n \n \nKeywords  \nmisophonia, mimicry, social cognition  \n \nIntroduction  \nMisophonia, literally ‘hatred of sounds’, is a disorder characterized by strong negative \nbehavioral and physiological emotional responses to certain specific sounds which we come \nacross frequently in our day -to-day life  (Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2001; Kumar et al., 2014; \nBrout et al., 2018; Swedo et al., 2022) . In typical cases of misophonia, these ‘trigger sounds’ \ntend to be sounds of eating, drinking, breathing, and chewing produced by other people. The \nemotional respons e to trigger sounds includes feelings of anger, irritation, anxiety, and disgust \naccompanied by a strong urge to escape from the situation in which trigger sounds are \nproduced. Since trigger sounds are common and almost inescapable in social situations, \nmisophonia has debilitating effects on occupational, family, and social life. A person with \nmisophonia , for example, might not have a meal or share a common space with other family \nmembers, avoid using public transport for travel, and will tend to avoid soci al situations at their \nworkplace. This social isolation, particularly in severe cases of misophonia, has a high impact \non mental health , and cases of suicide or suicide attempts have been reported in the academic \nliterature (Siepsiak et al., 2022)  and media (Nauman, 201 7), with up to 20% of people with \nmisophonia  indicating they have had thoughts of suicide  (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018) . Although \nthe exact prevalence of misophonia is not kno wn due to a lack of any comprehensive \nepidemiological study, a few studies (Wu et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017; Naylor et al., 2021)  \ntargeting specific populations (i.e., students) have reported a  prevalence of anywhere between \n5 and 20%.  \n \nThe mechanism of misophonia remains largely unknown. A dominant paradigm to understand \nmisophonia currently  is the ‘auditory processing framework’, in which misophonia is \nconsidered a disorder of sound processing  (Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2001; Jastreboff a nd \nJastreboff, 2015) .In this framework, trigger sounds cause aberrant processing in the"

      "text": "auditory/emotion processing parts of the brain which subsequently drives the emotional \nresponse in those with misophonia  (via a currently unknown mechanism). The fact that  many  \ntypical trigger sounds are generated by other people, is completely ignored in the auditory \nframework , as is the fact  that the context in which trigger sounds are produced is largely social , \nand that people with misophonia can be  triggered by particular  individuals  (e.g., close family \nmembers or someone familiar) but not by others. In other words, the current auditory -focussed \nmodel of misophonia employs a ‘detached’ framework where sounds are isolated from the \nsocial context in which they typically occur. There is now  overwhelming evidence that the brain \nprocesses social signals in a different way to non -social signals (for reviews see (Adolphs, \n2010; Molapour et al., 2021) ). For example, brain imaging in social cognitive neuroscience \nhas shown that specialized cognitive processes implemented in dedicated brain structures are \nemployed to extract socially relevant information such as faces (Kanwisher et al., 1997) , \nvoices (Belin et al., 2000) , the body as a whole (de Geld er et al., 2010) , and other ‘higher \norder’ social information such as mental states of other people (Frith and Frith, 2006) . In other \nwords, these brain structures become active only in response to  sensory stimulation in social \nsituations and they work differently or are ‘silent’ when dealing with non -social sensory input. \nThis has important implications for misophonia: emphasis only on the auditory/sound \ndimension while completely ignoring or delin king the ‘social’ aspect of misophonia may hinder \nprogress in understanding the perceptual/ cognitive processes and underlying brain \nmechanisms.  \n \nUsing an  integrated ‘framework ’, where both trigger sound s and their social  source are \nconsidered together, a d ifferent picture of misophonia emerges. Since the trigger sounds, for \nexample someone eating/chewing, are associated with an action (e.g., orofacial movement) \nof another person, it could be the case that misophonic distress is due to the perceived action \nof others and not due to the sound per se, which is a by -product of that action . In social \ncognition and neuroscience, it is well known that mere observation or hearing the sounds of \nactions of other leads to ‘mirroring’ or ‘mimicking’ of the same actions b y the perceiver without \nany intention or awareness to do so (Chartrand and van Baaren, 2009; Heyes, 2011; \nChartrand and Lakin, 2013) . The mechanism behind mimicry is commonly understood within \nthe framework of a ‘perception -action’ link, which posits that perceiving the action of others \nautomatically activates representations of that action in the perceiver which, in turn, executes \nmovements that are congruent to the perceived actions. With respect to brain function, the \n‘perception -action’ link is instantiated as communication between sensory areas and the motor \nareas of the brain. With emphasis on action of the trigger -person, coul d it be that the \nperception -action link is relatively stronger in misophonia which is activated by the sight or \nsounds of action? Initial evidence for activation of the perception -action link and ‘mirroring’ of"

An implication of the \nstronger resting state connectivity is that the orofacial motor cortex may be ‘primed ’ to respond \nstrongly to auditory and visual stimulation arising from the (orofacial) actions of others. This \nwas supported by the study showing that activation of the orofacial motor cortex was stronger , \nspecifically for trigger sounds (mostly orofacial i n nature) in misophonia.   \n \nOne implication of the evidence from our neuroimaging data is that mimicry should be widely \npresent in the misophonia population. With respect to misophonia, there are anecdotal reports \nof people mimicking the actions of the trig ger person , but the effect has not attracted much \nattention within misophonia research , except for a couple of case reports.  In a report of two \nmisophonia subjects (Hadjipavlou et al., 2008) , one subject who had eating /chewing sounds \nas triggers had urges to mimic the sounds by moving their lips and mouth. In another study , \nEdelstein et al. (2013)  reported 6 out of 11 subjects (55%) having a tendency to mimic the \nsounds. W ithin the ‘auditory framework’ mimicry is difficult to explain , whereas the \nsocial/action framework suggests mimicry would be present in people with misophonia .  \n \nTo address the relation between misophonia and mimicry, we asked more than 600 \nparticipants to complete online questionnaires relating to their misophonia severity and their \ntendency to mimic the sounds/action of the trigger person. More spec ifically we explored the \nfollowing: (i) with increasing misophonia severity, how likely people with misophonia  are to \nmimic, (ii) whether the act of mimicking relates to a particular set of trigger sounds (i.e., social), \nand (iii) what effect mimicking has  on individuals with misophonia . Our data suggest that the \ntendency to mimic is associated with misophonia severity and that the act of mimicking \nprovides relief. The current data, along with results from our neuroimaging study, provide \nsupport for a socia l cognition -based model of misophonia.  \n \nMethod  \nParticipants  \nParticipants for the study were recruited either by advertisements on internet websites/social \nmedia platforms that served the purpose of being misophonia support groups: ‘sounds like \nmisophonia’  (https://soundslikemisophonia.com/ ); ‘Allergic to Sound’"

A total of 816 participants took part in \ncompleting the online questionnaire. However, in guidance with exclusion criteria, participants \nwere removed from analysis if they: (i) did not give informed consent ( n = 20), (ii) were under \nthe age of 18 years ( n = 106), or (iii) if the data were duplicated ( n = 14). Data from a final total \nof 676 participants (505 (74.7%) females, 166 (24.6%) males and 5 (0.7%) ‘other’/ ‘preferred \nnot to disclose gender’) were entered into t he analysis. Participants were aged between 18 \nand 81 years ( mean = 38.39 years, SD = 16.10). Participants were asked if they had any other \nneurological/psychological disorder besides misophonia, 453 (67%) reported ‘no’, 203 (30%) \nreported ‘yes’, and 20 (3 %) ‘preferred not to say’. Meaning over half of the participants did not \nindicate having any other neurological/psychological disorders outside of their misophonia. An \nincentive was offered to participants where they could enter a prize draw to win one of three \n£20 Amazon vouchers for their participation.  \n \nMaterials  \nA set of questionnaires using Google forms were created and an online link to these was made \navailable on internet websites/social media or by email. As part of a larger research program \nto coll ect behavioural symptoms in people with misophonia, subjects completed a range of \nquestionnaires designed to assess social, emotional, and physiological impacts of \nmisophonia.  In the current study, data from only two questionnaires, (i) Misophonia \nQuestio nnaire (MQ)  (Wu et al., 2014)  and (ii)  a newly developed Iowa Mimicry Questionnaire \n(IMQ), is analysed and reported.  \n \nThe MQ consists of three parts, the first part  being the Misophonia Symptom Scale which is \ndesigned to examine the specific sound categories that a person with misophonia is sensitive \nto, for example, eating, repetitive tapping and throat sounds, among others. The second part \nis the Misophonia Emotion s Scale, which examines the emotional and behavioural responses \nassociated with misophonia symptoms. Each question in these two parts is scored on a 5 -\npoint Likert scale from ‘Not true at all’ (0) to ‘Always true’ (4). The third and final part is the \nMisop honia Severity Scale, which allows participants to provide a rating of their overall \nsensitivity to sounds on a scale from 0 to 15 (please note that the original questionnaire in Wu \net al (2014), used a scale from 1 to 15. We included ‘0’ in the scale to i ndicate ‘no sensitivity \nat all’). A brief description of what numbers from 0 to 15 is meant to represent in relation to \nseverity was given to help inform participants how to rate their sound sensitivity. For example, \n‘0 to 3; Minimal within range of normal  or very mild sound sensitivities ( “I spend little time \nresisting or being affected by my sound sensitivities. Almost no or no interference in daily \nactivity ”)."

To assess this, we used a \nmultivariable logistic regression with mimicking (yes/no) as a response variable and the \ndistress experienced on 7 different sound categories (people eating, repetitive tapping, \nrustling, nasal sounds, thro at sounds, consonant/vowels, environmental sounds) as \nexplanatory variables."

This finding is consistent with results from a recent \nneuroimaging study from our group (Kumar et  al, 2021), which for the first time hypothesized \nthe role of ‘mirroring’ the action, and not the sounds per se, as the primary driving factor in \nmisophonia. The neuroimaging study, by showing stronger resting state connectivity between \nauditory and visual  cortex and the pre -motor area of the brain in misophonia, argued that \nwatching or hearing action sounds (e.g., orofacial movement for eating/ chewing sounds) of \nthe trigger -person results in driving the same part of the motor cortex that is involved in \ngenerating the perceived action. The current study, based on self -reported measures of how \npeople with misophonia respond to and cope with triggers in daily life, provides support to the \n‘hyper -mirroring’ hypothesis of misophonia.   \n \nThe phenomenon of mimicr y is ubiquitous in social interactions and has been a well -\nresearched topic in social psychology and neuroscience (Prochazkova  and Kret, 2017; Arnold \nand Winkielman, 2020; Palagi et al., 2020) . Mimicry can be broadly divided into two categories: \nintentional and spontaneous. Intentional mimicry (sometimes also called imitation or \nemulation) involves expli cit intention to copy and reproduce somebody else’s actions. In a \nmisophonia context, this would be the case when a person with misophonia, on seeing/hearing \nthe actions (e.g., orofacial movement for eating/chewing sounds) of the trigger -person, \ndeliberate ly repeats the observed action. Spontaneous mimicry, on the other hand, is the \nautomatic reproduction of another individual’s motor movements, behaviour, or facial \nexpression without explicit intention or awareness to do so. For example, in a seminal study  \n(Chartrand and Bargh, 1999)  demonstrating spontaneous mimicry, a confederate manipulated \nher actions while interacting with participants: in different sessions, she either touched her \nface or shook her leg while both the confederate and participants were involved in an irrelevant \ntask of describing pictures to each other. Analysis of video recording of the interaction showed \nthat participants touched their face more in the presence of a face -touching confederate and \nwiggled their foot more in the presence of a foot -shaking confederate . Debriefing after the \nexperiment showed that participants did not notice any ‘odd’ behaviour of the confederate and \nwere not aware of their mimicking of the actions of the confederate implying that reproduction \nof the actions was implicit and unintentiona l. With respect to misophonia, spontaneous mimicry \nwould occur if mere observation or listening to the trigger sounds of action automatically elicits \na corresponding action (e.g., orofacial movements for eating/chewing sounds) in a person with"

Although not within the misophonia \ncontext, spontaneous mimicry has been shown in the domain of eating behaviour: people are \nmore likely to take a bite of food or sip of a drink when their companion does so (Larsen et al., \n2010; Hermans et al., 2012; Bell et al., 2019) . Even the sounds of eating alone can elicit eating \nmimicry in the listener (Zin et al., 2015) .  \n \nHow does misophonia relate to mimi cry? The basic premise of our argument is that \nmisophonia is a result of increased spontaneous mimicry in response to the actions (e.g., \norofacial movement) of the trigger -person that produce trigger sounds (e.g., eating/chewing \nsounds). The excessive spon taneous mimicry, which possibly arises due to the failure of \ncontextual modulation (either amplified in excess or not suppressed enough by the \ncontextual/situational settings) is then perceived  as inappropriate in terms of interfering in a \nperson’s current  goals and actions. This strong drive, initiated by an external source, to repeat \nthe actions can be felt as violating or invading personal space or can lead to a sense of loss \nof self -control. This is consistent with people with misophonia describing thei r experience of \ntrigger sounds as ‘invasive’, ‘intrusive’, ‘insulting’, ‘violating’ and ‘offensive’ (Rouw and \nErfanian, 2018) . There is also evidence that trigger sounds are perceived  as interfering in \none’s c urrent goals. In a study using a Stroop task, Daniels et al (2020)  showed that people \nwith misophonia are impaired in maintaining the current goals of the task specifically in the \npresence of t rigger sounds. Since perceived  interference, particularly when it is attributed to \nanother social agent, can be a cause of anger (Izard, 1991) , this also explains why anger, and \nin extreme c ases, aggression could be a dominating emotional response in misophonia. One \npossible way to counter the covert drive for spontaneous mimicry is to overtly mimic the action \nof the trigger -person (e.g., orofacial movements in response to sounds of eating/ch ewing). \nThe overt mimicry, in contrast to implicit and unintentional spontaneous mimicry, is intentional \nand done voluntarily as a coping mechanism to ‘cancel out’ the trigger sound. The reason why \novert mimicry in misophonia can ‘dampen’ the response to t he external trigger is that self -\nexecuted movement alone (with or without any sound generation, e.g. orofacial movement) \ndone in synchrony with external movements can lead to predictions about  the upcoming \nstimulus, much like an efference copy or corollar y discharge making a prediction of the \nsensory consequences of self -generated actions (Blakemore et al., 2000) , which is then \ncompared with the actual stimulus and the discrepancy betwee n the two (prediction error) is \nprocessed further. The amount of dampening of the trigger stimulus would depend on how \naccurately the self -action can predict the stimulus: the higher the accuracy of prediction, the \nlower the prediction error and thus the g reater the relief provided by the overt mimicry. \nMoreover, the overt mimicry can provide an increased sense of self -control: rather than being \na ‘passive’ recipient of the excessive drive to spontaneously mimic the actions of the trigger -"

      "text": "person, the person  with misophonia can now do the same action which is under their control. \nThis is in agreement with subjective reports of several people with misophonia who describe \ntheir act of deliberate mimicking as a means of ‘gaining control over the situation’ (as t old to \nthe senior author in personal communication/discussion).  \n \nOur data show that the probability of mimicking increases with misophonia severity (Figure 1). \nWhen asked about the type of mimicry, 50.5 % (sum of ‘sometimes’, ‘often’ and ‘always’, \nFigure 4(i)) described their mimicry to be spontaneous and out of their control. About 80% \n(Figure 4(ii)) of people who reported mimicking, described their act as deliberate and \nvoluntarily driven. As predicted by our model, intentional mimicry provides relief (r eported by \n68%, Figure 4(iii)) and makes the person feel under control (60.4 %, Figure 4(iv)).  \n \nAnalysis using multivariable logistic regression showed that, out of all the different types of \nsound categories examined, sensitivity to eating sounds was the  strongest predictor of mimicry \n(Table 1 and Figure 2). Multivariate analysis using PCA showed that eating/nasal/throat \nsounds and mimicry loaded onto the same component with high positive loadings implying a \npositive association between the component and these variables. The eating/nasal/throat \nsounds are orofacial (face/mouth) sounds involving movement of orofacial muscles and these \nsounds happen to be the dominant trigger sounds in misophonia (Schröder et al., 2013; Kumar \net al., 2014; Jager et al., 2020) . We understand there are trigger sounds which are of non -\norofacial origins (Hansen et al., 2021)  such as pen clicking, keyboard typing, and other \nenvironmental sounds. Although the questionnaire did not  have mention of these specific \nsounds, it did include ‘environmental sounds’ as one of the categories and no mimicking effect \nwas observed using either logistic regression or PCA. However, this category is very broad \nand whether mimicking is restricted to  a specific example of this category needs further \ninvestigation. The questionnaire also contained a ‘repetitive tapping sound’ which is the \nclosest possible to clicking pen/keyboard typing but no mimicking effect was observed. \nAlthough we did not find evi dence of mimicking for non -orofacial sounds, the question remains \nopen. One explanation is likely due to the under -representation of triggers of non -orofacial \norigin in the current sample size given the high prevalence of orofacial sounds as triggers. \nThis would require a further study which balances representation of different trigger types in \nthe sample. Interestingly, logistic regression analysis also showed consonant/vowel sounds \nsignificantly correlated with mimicry. Whether these sounds trigger reacti on because of the \nspeech/linguistic content or because these sounds are mouth sounds is not clear and their \nrelation to mimicry needs further investigation."

      "text": "What is the brain mechanism of excessive spontaneous mirroring in misophonia? There is \nevidenc e that a ‘mirror neuron system’ (MNS) which contains ‘mirror -neurons’ may underly \nmimicry in humans (Buccino et al., 2001; Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004) . Mirror neurons fire \nnot only when the subject executes an action but also when the subject sees or hears the \naction performed by another individual, thereby creating a ‘perception -action’ link. In our recent \nstudy (Kumar et al., 2021) , based on the findings of stronger coupling between auditory (and \nvisual) c ortex and orofacial motor cortex in people with misophonia, we argued for ‘hyper -\nmirroring’ as the basis of misophonia. This means that the perception of seeing or hearing \nanother individual producing eating/chewing sounds is ‘mirrored’ in the orofacial mo tor cortex \nto a greater degree in people with misophonia compared to control participants. This hyper -\nmirroring then reproduces the action which manifests as (spontaneous) mimicry. Our brain \nmodel of ‘hyper -mirroring’ and prevalence of spontaneous mimicry in the current work are \ntherefore consistent with each other.   \n  \nIn summary, our current work shows that mimicry is widely prevalent in misophonia and is \nelicited by the most common trigger sounds of eating and chewing. These data reinforce the \nidea of hy per-mirroring in misophonia proposed in our earlier work (Kumar et al., 2021) . This \nidea proposed that it was the action of the trigger -person and not the sounds per se as the \ndriving factor of distress in misophonia. By emphasizing the action of another social agent and \nnot the sounds which are only a by -product of that action, th e hyper -mirroring model \nrecommends that misophonia should be understood within the framework of social perception \nand cognition, and not within an auditory framework that only considers the sound and ignores \nthe social source from which it originates. Thes e data thus have crucial implications for how \nwe treat and interpret misophonia moving forward."
