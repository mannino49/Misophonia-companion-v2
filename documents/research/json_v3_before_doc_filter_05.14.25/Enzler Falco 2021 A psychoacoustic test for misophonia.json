Noreña1*\nMisophonia is a condition where a strong arousal response is triggered when hearing specific human \ngenerated sounds, like chewing, and/or repetitive tapping noises, like pen clicking. It is diagnosed \nwith clinical interviews and questionnaires since no psychoacoustic tools exist to assess its presence. \nThe present study was aimed at developing and testing a new assessment tool for misophonia. \nThe method was inspired by an approach we have recently developed for hyperacusis. It consisted \nof presenting subjects (n = 253) with misophonic, pleasant, and unpleasant sounds in an online \nexperiment. The task was to rate them on a pleasant to unpleasant visual analog scale. Subjects were \nlabeled as misophonics (n = 78) or controls (n = 55) by using self-report questions and a misophonia \nquestionnaire, the MisoQuest. There was a significant difference between controls and misophonics \nin the median global rating of misophonic sounds. On the other hand, median global rating of \nunpleasant, and pleasant sounds did not differ significantly. We selected a subset of the misophonic \nsounds to form the core discriminant sounds of misophonia  (CDSMiso). A metric: the CDS score, was \nused to quantitatively measure misophonia, both with a global score and with subscores. The latter \ncould specifically quantify aversion towards different sound sources/events, i.e., mouth, breathing/\nnose, throat, and repetitive sounds. A receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the \nmethod accurately classified subjects with and without misophonia (accuracy = 91%). The present \nstudy suggests that the psychoacoustic test we have developed can be used to assess misophonia \nreliably and quickly.\nMisophonia, literally hatred of  sound1, is a condition where subjects experience negative emotional reactions \n(e.g., irritation, anger and/or disgust)2,3 and a strong autonomic arousal response when hearing specific “trigger” \n sounds4,5. These triggers most often contain human generated mouth sounds (e.g., chewing and slurping), breath-\ning and nose sounds (e.g., heavy breathing and sniffing), throat sounds (e.g., swallowing and throat clearing), \nbut also repetitive sounds of objects operated by humans (e.g., pen clicking and keyboard typing)2–4. In some \ncases, visual repetitive stimuli, like leg-rocking or finger tapping, can act as misophonic triggers, a phenomenon \nknown as “misokinesia”2–4.\nThe physical characteristics of sounds (e.g., intensity and frequency) only partially influence the reaction of \nmisophonics to triggers, rather it is their psychological profile, previous experience, and the context in which \ntriggers are experienced that are the most  important1,4,6,7. For instance, experiencing triggers when one cannot \nescape from the situation (e.g., plane trip) worsens negative  reactions4. Also, eating and chewing sounds are less \nannoying when originating from babies or animals, as it is “not their fault” if they are generating  them4. Similarly, \nan individual’s own chewing sounds do not trigger a reaction and are often used as a coping mechanism to “cancel \nout” incoming  triggers3,4. Other coping mechanisms include listening to music, walking away, avoiding social \nsituations, using earplugs/headphones, and asking the originator of the trigger to  stop2–4.\nPrevalence reports of misophonia show large variability and range from 6% to 49.1%8–10. These differ con-\nsiderably due to the different assessment methods and criterion that were used to define misophonia. Besides, \nmisophonia severity varies: Naylor et al.10 found that 37%, 12% and 0.3% of medical students had mild, moder -\nate, and severe symptoms, respectively. They suggested that misophonia affects many people mildly, but only a \nfew severely.\nMisophonia can be accompanied by different comorbidities such as obsessive–compulsive personality traits, \ndepression, and  anxiety2,3,8,11.  Perfectionism2,  neuroticism2,3,12, difficulties with emotion  regulation12, and high \ninteroceptive  sensibility5 are also observed. Generally, no audiological problems are detected (e.g., audiogram, \nloudness discomfort levels, and speech audiometry)2,3, and cases of tinnitus and hyperacusis are scarce (2% and OPEN\n1Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Aix-Marseille University, Laboratory of Cognitive Neurosciences, \n3 Place Victor Hugo, 13003 Marseille, France. 2University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France. *email: \narnaud.norena@univ-amu.fr"

Misophonia has a significant impact on the quality of  life2,8,9 and causes daily stress because \nof anticipation of encounters with misophonic  triggers3.\nAn fMRI study showed greater activation of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) in misophonics compared to \ncontrols when presented with trigger  sounds5. The AIC is involved in the “salience network” which is critical in \ninteroceptive signals and emotion processing (including anger). Increased functional connectivity of the AIC with \ncore parts of the DMN (Default Mode Network), hippocampus, and amygdala, were also found in response to \ntrigger  sounds5. Two later trigger-exposure fMRI studies further supported involvement of the “salience network” \nin  misophonia13,14. One of them also showed an increased synchronization of the premotor, mid-cingulate, and \norbitofrontal cortices in subjects with  misophonia14.\nMisophonia is most commonly diagnosed through clinical psychological interviews and/or with \n questionnaires15. Schröder et al.3 described what criteria should be present to diagnose misophonia and they \nsuggested the A-MISO-S questionnaire to assess them. These have later been reviewed by the same  group2, and \nform the basis of the revised version of the A-MISO-S: the AMISOS-R. Diagnostic criteria include: Feelings of \nirritation, anger, and/or disgust towards specific oral or nasal human generated sounds, loss of self-control (due \nto impulsive physical reactions), avoidance behaviors, significant impact on the quality of life, and indications \nthat these behaviors are not better explained by other disorders (e.g., autism or attention deficit hyperactivity \ndisorder). Other questionnaires include the Misophonia  Questionnaire8 and the  MisoQuest16. The latter is the \nonly one that has been fully validated. To date, none of these have been translated and validated in French.\nTo our knowledge, no psychoacoustic test exists for misophonia. While questionnaires’ performance in diag-\nnosing misophonia and its associated distress is reasonably good, they are based on the subjects’ recollection of \ntheir experience when faced with misophonic sounds. The true lived experience of the misophonic sounds is \nmissing. We believe that measuring this subjective experience is important in estimating the aversion of subjects \nwhen faced with triggers. Such a test would also reveal for what kind of sounds a patient presents strong feel-\nings and/or reactions. Moreover, estimates of the unpleasantness of misophonic sounds could be used as in situ \noutcome measures when evaluating potential misophonia treatments.\nIn a previous  study17, we designed a psychoacoustic test for the diagnosis of hyperacusis by using the ratings \nof natural sounds on a pleasant to unpleasant V AS (Visual Analog Scale). In this study, we propose using a similar \napproach but adapted to misophonia using misophonic sounds. The task was completed online by 253 subjects. \nOur goals were to: (i) Identify which trigger sounds were rated as most unpleasant, (ii) select an optimal subset \nof these to create a new assessment tool for misophonia, and (iii) further validate the use of ratings of natural \nsounds as a novel approach for sound-based pathologies assessment and diagnosis.\nMethods\nSubjects. Subjects were recruited through mailing lists and social networks. Notable Facebook groups \nwere “Misophonie/Misokinésie—1er groupe de France” , “Misophonie/Misokinésie—2ème groupe de France” , \n“Misophonia without Borders” , “Misophonia Treatment and Management” , “Misophonia International Sup-\nport Group” , “Western and Pacific Misophonia Support Group” , “CAA tinnitus and hyperacusis Special Interest \ngroup” , and “Orthophonie et Audiologie Québec” . 253 subjects took part in the study (median age = 33 years; \nMedian Absolute Deviation (MAD) = 7 years). The only inclusion criterion was to be at least 18 years old.\nThe ethics committee of Aix-Marseille University approved this study (reference number: 2020-10-08-001). \nThe study was performed in accordance with institutional guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki, and com-\nplied with national regulations. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nOnline task. The first page included a detailed description of the task, our contact information, and a request \nto do the experiment in a calm environment. No identifying information was collected, only the age. A list of \nquestions, with explanations (shown here in brackets), was asked: (1) Do you have hearing issues (you ask others \nto repeat, you have problems understanding speech in noise)? (2) Do you have tinnitus (ear whistling)? (3) Do you \nhave auditory hypersensitivity (are some sounds loud or painful at modest intensities for you when they do not cause \nany reaction in others)? (4) How disabled are you by this hypersensitivity? (5) Are there any particular sounds that \ntrigger very intense reactions in you such as anger, disgust…? Those that responded “yes” to the last question, were \nasked to name what sounds trigger these reactions. Explanations could be seen by hovering the mouse over an \ninformation bubble. Questions 1, 2, 3, and 5 could be answered with “yes” , “no” , or “I don’t know” . Question 4 \ncould be answered with “not at all” , “a little” , “moderately” , or “a lot” . For the remaining of the paper, questions 1, \n2, 3, and 5 will be referred to as self-report questions for hearing issues, tinnitus, hyperacusis, and misophonia, \nrespectively. Caution should be taken when examining our results on the self-report of hyperacusis. Reasons for \nthis will be addressed in the discussion.\nSubjects were requested to complete the  MisoQuest16. We chose this questionnaire as it is, to the best of our \nknowledge, the only fully validated misophonia questionnaire. It contains 14 items. Each item is given a score \nfrom 1 to 5: (1) I completely disagree, (2) I disagree, (3) Neither agree nor disagree, (4) I agree, (5) I completely \nagree. The total score is obtained by summing the scores for each item, it ranges from 14 to 70. A total score \nabove (or equal to) 61 suggests misophonia  diagnosis18. Siepsiak et al.18 chose this cut-off by subtracting one \nstandard deviation (SD = 4.3) from the mean total score of misophonics (mean = 65.72). To verify this cut-off, we \nperformed a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)19 analysis of data from Siepsiak et al.16 (Supplementary \nData “raw_data2.csv”) and found that a cut-off of 61 was optimal (highest overall classification accuracy) in \nseparating MisoQuest total scores of controls (n = 254) from scores of misophonics (n  = 61).\nSubjects were first presented with white noise and were asked to adjust a volume slider until sound was at a \ncomfortable listening level. Subjects then trained with the rating of test sounds that are not part of the experimen-\ntal sounds (“marimba” and “squeaking door”). This was also the opportunity to readjust the volume if necessary."

All subsequent sounds were thus presented at individual comfortable levels.\nTwenty-eight sounds were repeated three times at random and each sound had to be assessed on a V AS rang-\ning from \"very pleasant\" (far left) to \"very unpleasant\" (far right). The words \"very pleasant\" and \"very unpleasant\" \nwere coloured respectively in green and red to avoid any confusion. Subjects were instructed that sounds are not \nnecessarily very pleasant or very unpleasant and that the pleasantness/unpleasantness of sounds are variable. As \nsuch, they were requested to use the full length of the scale. If the sounds were neither pleasant nor unpleasant, \nthen the subject was instructed to respond in the middle of the scale (“neutral”). Subjects could replay the sound \nas many times as necessary before finalizing the answer with a button.\nThe test was available in English or in French and was accessible via a computer or a smartphone. It took \nabout 20 min to complete. The MisoQuest was translated into French by the authors.\nLabeling subjects. Subjects were labeled as misophonics (n = 78; median age = 32, MAD = 8) if they self-\nreported misophonia and if their MisoQuest score was above (or equal to) 61. Subjects were labeled as controls \n(n = 55; median age = 33, MAD = 5) if they had a MisoQuest score below 61, did not self-report hearing issues, \ntinnitus, hyperacusis and misophonia (answered “no” or “I don’t know”), and indicated no impact of hyperacusis \non their lives (answered “not at all”).\nSounds. Sixteen misophonic sounds were selected based on previous reports of misophonia triggers in the \n literature2,3. We selected mouth, breathing, nasal, and throat sounds as well as repetitive sounds (keyboard typ-\ning and pen clicking). Six unpleasant and six pleasant sounds were also selected. These were rated as such by \ncontrols in a previous  study17.\nSound files were retrieved from  publications17,20, and from online sources. These are detailed in Table  1. \nSound duration ranged from 0.9 s to 2.8 s (mean = 2.1 s, SD = 0.4 s).  All sounds had the same root-mean-square \nsound pressure.\nStatistical analysis. Sound ratings’ analysis was first attempted with a linear mixed-effects model. How-\never, the distribution of its residuals did not fulfill assumptions of linearity or homoscedasticity. Together with \nobservations of sound ratings’ distributions, it was clear that our data did not show gaussian distributions (this \nwas also confirmed with Lilliefors tests). We thus used non-parametric tests. When testing the null hypothesis \nthat two samples were equal, we used the Wilcoxon non-parametric two-tailed rank test. When multiple com-\nparisons were performed, α was corrected with the Bonferroni correction. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient \n(ICC) estimates and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated based on a mean-rating (across repetitions, \nk = 3), absolute agreement, 2-way mixed-effects model (i.e. ICC(2,3)). ICC values range between 0 and 1. Values \nbelow 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and above 0.9 indicate poor, moderate, good, and excel-\nlent reliability,  respectively21. Statements on ICC reliability were made with respect to 95% confidence intervals. \nTo compute effect sizes between median sound ratings for two groups, we used the r effect  size22. Values of r \nnear 0.5, 0.3 or 0.1 indicate, respectively, large, medium, and small effect sizes. To compare the performance of \nclassifiers, we used ROC  curves19. These allow comparison of specificity (proportion of negatives (e.g., controls) \ncorrectly identified as negatives) and sensitivity (proportion of positives (e.g., misophonics) correctly identified \nas positives) of classifiers for different cut-off values. The higher the AUC (Area Under Curve) of these curves, \nthe better the classifier. The maximum possible AUC is 1, which would indicate a perfect classifier. The Wilson \nscore with continuity  correction23 was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals for accuracy, specificity, and \nsensitivity results. For correlations, Spearman’s ρ (rho) was used. To test the effect of repetition on sound ratings, \nwe built a zero–one inflated beta model using R (R Core Team 2021) and the brms  package24,25.All other above \ncomputations and following figures were done with MATLAB 2019a.Table 1.

Some subjects reported \nseveral sounds within the same category. The most common trigger type reported by misophonics was mouth \nsounds: 91% reported at least one type of mouth sound, with 54% naming specifically chewing sounds, and 42% \nreporting general mouth sounds. 65% reported at least one type of repetitive sound, with 22%, 19%, and 19%, \nnaming specifically pen click, keyboard typing, and footsteps, respectively. 45% and 31% reported at least one \ntype of breathing/nose, and throat sound, respectively. Detailed values for each sound and category are shown \nin Supplementary Table S2.\nSome responses were very specific, for instance: “bare feet walking on floors covered with a plastic layer, \nwhich creates a sort of suction sound” , “headphone friction on my ears” , “voice of my partner when singing” , and \n“repetitive words such as “um” and “like”” .\nSome sounds might be more associated to symptoms of hyperacusis than of misophonia, for instance loud \ntraffic noises or high-pitched  sounds26,27. Only one subject mentioned hyperacusis as a reason for the presence of \ntwo sounds: birds, and cymbal. This subject also reported high-pitched sounds like screams, squeaking sounds, \nand instruments (e.g., violin). (S)he did not specify if the latter were due to hyperacusis or misophonia.\nSound ratings. The V AS positions were mapped to ratings that went from 0 (highly pleasant) to 100 (highly \nunpleasant), where 50 was neither pleasant nor unpleasant.\nFor each subject and sound, we computed the standard deviation (SD) of ratings across three repetitions. \nFor each subject, we averaged SDs across all sounds. This gives a general measure of how reliable (mean of SDs) \neach subject is across repetitions (low values indicate good reliability). The mean and SD of these values were \n5.7 and 2.4, respectively. Subjects with their mean SDs above 10.8 (mean + 2SD) were excluded (n = 9). Three \nhad been labeled as misophonics and one had been labeled as control. Following results on sound ratings are \ntherefore based on 75 misophonics (median age = 32, MAD  = 8) and 54 controls (median age  = 33, MAD  = 5).\nTo test the effect of repetition on sound ratings (from misophonics and controls with reliable ratings), we \nbuilt a zero–one inflated beta model with group and repetition as fixed effects, and subject and sound as random \neffects. For the mean of ratings, the model revealed a significant effect of group (95% Credible Interval (CrI): \n[0.033, 0.085]), but not of repetition (95% CrI for 2nd vs 1st, 3rd vs 2nd, and 3rd vs 2nd repetitions were, respec-\ntively, [-0.0064, 0.0092], [-0.0015, 0.014], and [-0.0015, 0.014]). For each subject and sound, we thus averaged \nratings across their three repetitions.\nICCs(2,3) were computed for each sound (for subjects with reliable ratings) and showed good to excellent \nreliability between repetitions. Mean ICC(2,3) across all sounds was 0.93. 16 sounds (out of 28) had excellent \nreliability. Full ICC(2,3) details are shown in Supplementary Table S3.\nFigure  3 compares the median ratings of each sound for the controls and misophonics. For each subject, we \ncomputed the median of their sound ratings for each category. The median for each sound category was then \ncalculated across subjects for each group (control and misophonic). The difference of medians between the \nmisophonic and control groups (i.e., y–x coordinates of diamond symbols in Fig.  3) was markedly larger for miso-\nphonic sounds (difference  = 18.3) than for unpleasant (difference  = − 1) or pleasant sounds (difference  = − 5.5). \nRank tests were used to evaluate the null hypothesis that median ratings for sounds with the same category were \nthe same for the two groups. Misophonic sounds’ medians were significantly different between both groups \n(p = 5.3·10−9 ; r = 0.51). Unpleasant and pleasant sounds’ medians did not show significant differences (p = 0.75, \nand p  = 0.50, respectively; r = − 0.03, and − 0.06, respectively).\nFigure 3.  Misophonic vs Control median ratings for each sound. Ratings vary between 0 (Pleasant) and \n100 (Unpleasant). Each dot represents the median rating of a sound for the control (x-axis) group and the \nmisophonic (y-axis) group. Sounds are colored and grouped as misophonic (magenta), unpleasant (red), and \npleasant (green), as determined initially during the choice of the stimuli (Table 1 ). The median of individual \nmedians of sound ratings within the same category is shown as a diamond. As a visual reference, the y=x line \nis drawn in dotted black.

Figure  4 shows the ratings \nof controls and misophonics, and the effect size, for each sound. The effect size allows us to determine the most \ndiscriminant sounds, i.e., those that can best separate control from misophonic ratings. In accordance with Fig.  3, \nmisophonic sounds had the highest effect sizes, while unpleasant and pleasant sounds had low effect sizes. Mouth \nand repetitive sounds had the highest mean effect size: 0.66 and 0.52, respectively. “Chewing 1” , “Chewing 2” , \n“Slurping” , “Sniffing” , “Throat Clearing” , and “Pen Click” , had large effect sizes (r > 0.5): 0.74, 0.73, 0.53, 0.62, and \n0.57, respectively. “Vomit” had a low effect size (− 0.08) and was rated as very unpleasant for both groups. This \nsuggests that it was wrongfully categorized as a misophonic trigger sound.\nCore discriminant sounds. To create a new assessment tool, we wanted to select the sounds with the most \ndiscriminative power whilst keeping in mind clinical practicalities. This tool should not be too time-consuming \n(not too many sounds), and it should capture the main complaints of misophonics. As shown in Fig.  2, several \ncategories of sounds were considered as triggers. Moreover, some subjects would report mouth sounds as trig-\ngers, and not mention any repetitive sounds. The contrary was seen too. Hence, the final choice of sounds should \nassess these putative dimensions of misophonia. As in Enzler et  al.17 for hyperacusis, the optimal subset of \nsounds to assess misophonia were called Core Discriminant Sounds (CDS). For clarity, the first will be referred \nto as  CDSHyp and the latter as  CDSMiso.\nAs seen in Figs.  3 and 4 , misophonic sounds discriminate best misophonic from control ratings. As such, the \n CDSMiso were selected within these. We wanted to keep sounds from each subcategory of misophonic sounds, \nto assess the unpleasantness of each in the  CDSMiso. To identify what sounds were the most important in dis -\ncriminating controls from misophonics in each subcategory, we first defined a metric that could measure this: \nthe CDS score. Second, we computed this metric for different choices of CDS and compared their performance \nusing ROC  curves19.\nTo compute the CDS score, we took an approach similar to the definition of dB HL, where 0 dB HL is defined \nas a normalized value i.e., a value that represents the behavior of a control population. Positive values are deemed \ndifferent than normal when crossing a chosen threshold (usually 20 dB HL). Our goal was to create a metric that \nevaluates how different subjects’ ratings are from a given threshold. We set a threshold for each sound at the 75% \nquantile of the control group’s distribution. For a given subject, a given sound ( s∈CDS ={1, 2, 3, ...,|CDS| } \nwhere each index represents one of the CDS  and |CDS | is the number of elements within this set), we compute \nthe distance, in percentage, of this sound’s rating ( Ratings ) from its respective 75% quantile (  Quantile .75,s):\nFigure 4.  Ratings and effect sizes for each sound. Each sound is shown on the x axis.

The CDS score expresses how high a given subject’s ratings are \nrelative to the quantiles. For a given set of sounds (the CDS), the CDS score is computed by averaging the dis-\ntances of sound ratings within that set and whose quantiles are below 100. This subset of sounds is defined as: \ns_valid ={s∈CDS |Quantile .75,s<100}  . Indeed, for sounds with a 75% quantile ( Quantile .75,s ) equal to 100, \ntheir Distance s becomes zero. However, we do not want to include this null distance in our average. In this study, \nno sound had their 75% quantile of control ratings equal to 100. The CDS score is defined as:\nwhere |s_valid | is the number of sounds in the CDS with a 75% quantile below 100.\nFor each CDS score, we computed the cut-off value that best separates misophonic scores from control scores \ni.e. the value where scores above (or equal to) this cut-off indicate misophonia and scores below this cut-off  \nindicate no misophonia. The cut-off values were obtained by maximizing classification accuracy. Accuracy was \ncalculated by dividing the sum of true positives (misophonics with a score above (or equal to) the cut-off) and \ntrue negatives (controls with a score below the cut-off) by the total number of subjects (75 misophonics + 54 \ncontrols  = 129 subjects).\nFor each subcategory, we tested every combination of k sounds possible, with k ranging from 1 to n , where \nn is the number of sounds within that subcategory. In other words, we tested CDS that contained 1 to n  sounds, \nand for each number of sounds (k), we tested all the possible ways we could select k sounds from n  sounds.\nFor each k, we selected the combinations of CDS that gave the highest accuracy. Figure  5 shows the highest \naccuracy, for each k, and for each subcategory. The best subset of sounds for mouth sounds,  CDSMouth , were \n“Chewing 1” , “Chewing 2” , and “Slurping” . For breathing/nose sounds, maximum accuracy was the same for \nk = 2, 3, and 4. Maximum AUC for these were 0.870, 0.873, and 0.860, respectively. As such, the most accurate \ncombination of three sounds was chosen for  CDSBreathing/Nose . They contained one breathing sound and two nose \nsounds: “Breath Running” , “Sniffing” , and “Snoring” . The  CDSRepetitive  were “Pen Click” , and “Keyboard” . The \n CDSThroat  were “Throat Clearing” , and “Swallowing” . These sounds form the  CDSMiso (n = 10).\nRatings of the  CDSMiso for both groups are shown in Fig.  6. Two example subjects (one control and one miso-\nphonic) are also shown with their respective CDS scores. For each subcategory, we computed their CDS score. \nWe also computed a global score, CDS Score Total , which is computed by including all sounds from the  CDSMiso. \nOptimal cut-off values, computed with ROC analysis, are indicated next to each score in brackets.

In Table  4, we identified such patterns by counting misophonic subjects that had the \nsame subcategories’ CDS score above (or equal to) their respective cut-offs.

This result is interesting as it suggests that subjects \nmay confuse hyperacusis and misophonia. See the next section for a discussion on the self-report of hyperacusis..\nDiscussion\nSummary of the findings. With this study we wanted to create a tool that could assess misophonia by \ndirectly confronting subjects with trigger sounds. First, we found that misophonics’ unpleasantness towards \nsounds was specifically higher for misophonic sounds, while general pleasant or unpleasant sounds were not \ndifferent from control ratings. Second, we identified a subset of sounds, the  CDSMiso, that could be used to assess \nmisophonia. They could also evaluate potential subcategories of misophonia. A metric, the CDS score, was used \nto quantify misophonia and its subcategories.\nQuestionnaire data on hearing. Previous  studies2,3 have found audiological problems to be rare in miso-\nphonics. In our study, 22% of misophonics self-reported hearing issues. It is unclear whether our findings suggest \nthat hearing issues are missed by clinical measures in misophonics, or if the validity of online questionnaire data \nis to be questioned. Jager et al.2 had 109 misophonics (randomly selected from 575 misophonics) perform an \naudiogram (air and bone conduction thresholds from 0.25 to 8 kHz, and from 0.25 to 2 kHz, respectively, both \nin octave steps). 97% (n = 106) had bilateral normal hearing. However, they did not perform speech discrimina-\ntion measures. Schröder et al.3 had only five subjects (out of 42) undergo hearing tests (pure tone, speech audi-\nometry, and loudness discomfort levels). One patient showed conductive hearing loss. The other four showed \nno audiological abnormalities. Findings might have been different if the remaining 37 subjects had been tested. \nOur question on hearing issues indicates two examples in its explanation: “you ask others to repeat” (eventually \nhearing loss), and “you have problems understanding speech in noise” (speech in noise issues). Given results on Table 4.

Still, Jager et al.2 \ndid not test high frequencies (above 8 kHz).\n71% of misophonics reported hyperacusis. This prevalence is much higher than the 1% found by Jager et al.2 \nor of the 25% found by Sanchez and  Silva28. We believe the high prevalence of hyperacusis in misophonics in our \nstudy should be taken with caution. Indeed, no diagnostic measure of hyperacusis was used, only one self-report \nquestion. Most importantly, the question on hyperacusis ( “do you have auditory hypersensitivity?” ) might have \nbeen wrongfully interpreted as positive for misophonics, even though no hyperacusis was present. Explanation \n(i.e., definition of hyperacusis) for that question (“are some sounds loud or painful at modest intensities for you \nwhen they do not cause any reaction in others”) was only shown when hovering over an information bubble. \nSubjects might have missed this. For future online studies, better care should be taken to word this question.\n19% of misophonics reported tinnitus. Our results are higher than those by Jager et al.2, where only 2% of \nmisophonics had tinnitus. However, the latter had only been diagnosed as such prior to the study. It is not stated \nwhether all subjects had undergone screening for tinnitus (and hyperacusis) prior to the study or not. On the \nother hand, Sanchez and  Silva28 reported that 50% of misophonics self-reported tinnitus. Furthermore, with our \ndata, we cannot be sure that tinnitus was chronic.\nResult discrepancies indicate that a putative link between tinnitus, hyperacusis, hearing loss, and misophonia \nis unclear.\nThe MisoQuest and misophonic sounds. Siepsiak et al.18 found that the MisoQuest was very specific \nand not very sensitive: 96% and 66%, respectively. They compared MisoQuest scores to face-to-face interview \ndiagnosis using the diagnostic criteria by Schröder et al.3. We found similar results: 99% specificity and 45% \nsensitivity, when comparing MisoQuest scores with self-diagnosis. 55% of subjects self-diagnosing misophonia \nwere not diagnosed as such by the MisoQuest. This highlights the putative variability in misophonia diagnosis \n(and severity). This echoes the rather high prevalence rates of misophonia found by Wu et al.8 (20%) and Nay-\nlor et al.10 (49.1%). The latter have stated that only 0.3% had severe cases of misophonia, and that misophonia \nseemed to affect many people mildly, but only a few severely. As discussed by Edelstein et al.4, controls and \nmisophonics find similar sounds to be aversive, but the degree of aversion experienced by misophonics is higher, \nwhich is in broad agreement with our findings (Fig.  4). The line between slightly abnormal annoyance towards \nspecific sounds and its significant impact on the quality of life is what makes misophonia a serious condition.\n91%, 65%, 44%, and 31% of misophonics reported at least one mouth, repetitive, breathing/nose, and throat \nsound, respectively, as a trigger (Fig.  2). These are similar proportions than those shown by Jager et al.2 : 96%, \n74%, 85%, and 69% for eating, repetitive tapping, breathing/nose, and mouth/throat sounds, respectively. Inquir -\ning trigger sounds with an open question might explain lower percentages in our study. Indeed, subjects might \nnot have taken the time to think of every sound that could be considered as a trigger, and rather focused on \nthe first, and probably main, ones that came to mind. One subject wrote: “so many I can’t even think of more \nright now but mostly human related noises… ” . In Jager et al.2, a readymade list of trigger sounds was prepared. \nNevertheless, chewing and mouth sounds were the most reported both in this study and in previous  ones2–4,29.\nBesides, differences in category percentages also depend on how sounds are attributed. For instance, we \nattributed “Swallowing” as a throat sound (focusing on the location of the sound source), whereas Jager et al.2, \nhad it in the eating category. Also, we could have eventually assigned some animal sounds to “Repetitive sounds” \ninstead of “Environmental” . However, from subjects’ descriptions it was not clear if it was the repetitive nature of \nthe sound (e.g., continuous dog barking) that was the trigger or not. It would be of interest to have misophon -\nics categorize sounds, instead of researchers. Also, it could be interesting for future research to have a large set \nof triggers (similar to those self-reported in Fig.  2) rated by misophonics, and then to extract, through factor \nanalysis, empirical categories of misophonic triggers.\nSound ratings and misophonia. Misophonics had significantly higher ratings than controls for miso-\nphonic sounds, while pleasant and unpleasant sounds did not show significant differences (Figs.  3 and 4). As \nexpected, misophonics show high levels of unpleasantness towards specific human generated  sounds2–4, even at \ncomfortable listening levels. The latter supports previous suggestions that physical characteristics of sounds are \nless detrimental in sound aversion, rather that it is the previous experiences and associations with triggers that \nmake them  unpleasant1,6. These results emphasize the differences between misophonia and hyperacusis.\nIn this study, subjects could decide when the next sound would play. They were given more control than what \nthey usually have over daily situations. Indeed, the context in which sounds are experienced makes the triggers \nmore, or less, uncomfortable. For instance, Edelstein et al.4 reported that discomfort was worse when subjects \nfelt they could not escape the situation (e.g. plane trip), which is their main coping  mechanism2,4. Besides, lack \nof control of neighborhood sounds makes them more unpleasant, even in the case of non-misophonics30. Hence, \neven in a controlled situation, ratings by misophonics where higher than for controls. This suggests that context \nis not solely necessary for misophonic aversion, and that underlying emotional and memory associations with \nsound are sufficient to generate abnormal aversion. Still, as shown recently by Edelstein et al.7, context may \nmodulate the severity of such aversion.\nOur V AS might measure a mixture of emotion and memory associations related to sounds. For instance, \nkeyboard typing and pen clicking sounds were rated as high even though the sound stimuli were short. This \ncould be explained by two possibilities: a short repetitive stimulus is sufficient to directly induce aversion, and/\nor it is the memory associations with this type of sound that influenced the rating. These sounds are thought \nto be annoying because of their repetitive and unpredictable  nature29, and because of the context in which they \nare experienced: misophonics do not understand why the originators of the sound do not stop making these \nrude  sounds4. In the task, the repetitions (e.g., number of pen clicks) were limited because of the short stimulus"

Whatever the reasons behind the ratings are, if they \nare higher than those of controls, it still indicates an abnormal relationship towards sound.\nBesides, memory associations of sounds are what are measured with questionnaires. Hence, the advantage \nof a psychoacoustic assessment is that a mixture of past associations and immediate aversion (lived experience) \ntowards sound is being measured. This measure is also more ecological as it is assessed with actual triggers.\nThe pathophysiological mechanisms of misophonia are unclear. Trigger sounds have been shown to involve \na large network including the anterior insular cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala in misophonic subjects. \nThis network is thought to play a critical role in processing interoceptive signals and  emotions5. One notes that \nmisophonia has been suggested to be a psychiatric  disorder29.\nFinally, misophonia may have, at least in part, an anthropological and/or sociological origin. For instance, \nwestern culture tends to eliminate or “deodorize” body  odors31. Similarly, western culture tends to eliminate body \nsounds. It is, for instance, impolite and rude to make sounds when eating, and children are taught to chew with \ntheir mouth closed. The sound of chewing may be interpreted as an equivalent of body odor. Like odors, body \nsounds such as chewing may be used to build the concepts of “oneness” and “otherness” . Besides, like perfume to \nfoul odor, music or other (natural) sounds may be used as a way to mask unwanted  sounds32 in a social environ-\nment. However, the western standards are not necessarily shared by other cultures. Customs regarding eating can \nbe different from one part of the world to  another33,34. It is unclear whether this cultural aspect may modulate \nmisophonia development, symptoms, and impairment. Misophonia was assessed in  Chinese9 and  American8 \nstudents using the same misophonia and impairment questionnaires. Average annoyance ratings of misophonic \nsound categories (e.g., eating, throat, nasal, repetitive sounds) and misophonia prevalence were similar between \nboth studies. However, correlations between misophonia symptoms and functional impairment were lower in \nthe Chinese students than in the American students. It would be of interest to investigate this question of the \ncultural aspect of misophonia by using our test in different countries.\nThe core discriminant sounds as a diagnostic tool for misophonia. With the  CDSMiso, we selected \nthe most discriminant misophonic triggers, while maintaining sounds from four main subcategories (mouth, \nbreathing/nose, throat, and repetitive sounds), each of which were often reported as triggers in Fig.  2. This \nsuggests that the ratings collected in the task and the method used to select the  CDSMiso accurately represent \nmisophonic complaints.\nWe showed that the CDS Score Total classified misophonics and controls with 91% accuracy. Each subcategory \nof the  CDSMiso can be used to have a detailed assessment of misophonia and could potentially be used to identify \nsubtypes of misophonia. CDS Score Mouth  had the highest classification accuracy of all subscores (Table  3). This \nhighlights the strong specificity that misophonia has with chewing and eating sounds, which are the most often \nreported as  triggers2–4,29.\nIn Table  4, we attempted to identify potential subtypes of misophonia by using the CDS scores of each subcat-\negory of the  CDSMiso. Most subjects (55%) had scores from each subcategory above (or equal to) their respective \ncut-offs. This is not surprising as cut-offs were selected to maximize classification accuracy of our subjects. It \nwould be of interest to test such an approach on another cohort of subjects. Interestingly, cut-off values were \ncomputed with rather severe cases of misophonia (high MisoQuest scores). Patterns might emerge in mild to \nmoderate cases of misophonia.\nIt would also be of interest to correlate CDS scores with precise severity scales of misophonia (e.g., “mild” , \n“moderate” , or “severe”) to accurately define cut-offs for each severity, for instance using the AMISOS-R2.\nThe  CDSMiso were selected based on misophonics identified by the MisoQuest. It would be interesting to \nverify that correlation found between the CDS Scores and the MisoQuest, is also found with other measures of \nmisophonia, like the  MQ8 and the AMISOS-R2.\nOther limits. Identification of sound seems to influence pleasantness-unpleasantness  ratings35. In this study, \nsounds were presented without any text or image identification. Most misophonic sounds are easy to identify \nwith sound alone. However, this might not have been the case for other sounds. Several misophonics mentioned \nnail sounds as triggers (Fig.  2). In our task, “Fingernails on Chalkboard” was not rated higher by misophonics \nthan controls. This could be because the sound was not recognized and therefore not associated with a visual \nor tactile perception, or with a past experience. It could be of interest to add information from other sensory \nmodalities, like vision, to the stimuli. Besides, having a subpart of the experiment solely with visual stimuli (e.g., \nleg rocking) could potentially be used to measure cases of misokinesia.\nCut-offs for each of the CDS scores might have to be reassessed by future studies. Indeed, those shown in \nTable  3, were computed to optimally classify “clean” subjects. The distribution of CDS scores might not be the \nsame for other cohorts, especially if severity of misophonia is different. This should also be considered if the task \nis used in a different setting than an online task. It is possible that ratings may slightly differ in a clinical setting \nthan in an online situation. Besides, further validation of the task in a clinical setting, where potential psychi -\natric and/or audiological comorbidities may be evaluated by the clinician, is important. Furthermore, having a \npsychoacoustic test only with triggers (e.g., the  CDSMiso), might change the dynamic of V AS responses, as such \ncut-offs might also have to be reassessed for this reason.\nFuture assessment of test–retest reliability of the  CDSMiso is important to confirm its viability as a novel \nassessment tool for misophonia.\nThe V AS measures the pleasantness-unpleasantness of sound. However, misophonics may experience a variety \nof emotions that could potentially modulate rated unpleasantness, for instance anger, disgust, stress, or  anxiety4. \nIt might be of interest to have the  CDSMiso evaluated with V AS for each of these."

We further validated a method previously used \nfor hyperacusis  assessment17, and successfully applied it to another condition (misophonia) and setting (online). \nWe showed that misophonics had higher ratings than controls for misophonic triggers, and not for pleasant or \nunpleasant sounds, thus further showing that misophonia is specific to certain sounds. The CDS scores can be \nused to assess misophonia globally, but also to identify potential subcategories of misophonia with a score for \neach subcategory of the  CDSMiso.\nThis psychoacoustic tool, the first that has been developed to assess misophonia, could motivate other studies \non conditions where relation to sound is abnormal. For instance, decreased sound tolerance (mainly hyperacusis, \nbut also misophonia) is present in  autism36,37. A different set of CDS could be more adequate to assess hyperacusis \nand misophonia in such population.\nUsing the  CDSHyp and the  CDSMiso together in one experiment, with controlled levels, could potentially serve \nas a novel tool to assess both conditions at once. Tyler et al.38 suggested four main types of hyperacusis: loud-\nness, annoyance, fear, and pain. The  CDSHyp probably measure loudness-, and eventually pain-  hyperacusis17. \nThe  CDSMiso most probably measure annoyance hyperacusis, at least annoyance that is specific to the definition \nof misophonia.\nThe  CDSMiso could potentially be used as an outcome measure over the course of misophonia management. It \noffers the advantage of directly assessing aversion to triggers at the time they are presented, unlike questionnaire \nthat may not have the proper temporal resolution to assess quick and subtle changes in the lived experience. On \nthe other hand, questionnaires may be more adequate to assess the impact of misophonia on the quality of life, \nwhich typically requires extended time to realize if any progress or worsening has been achieved.\nData availability\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article’s supplementary informa-\ntion files.\nReceived: 31 January 2021; Accepted: 4 May 2021\nReferences\n 1.
