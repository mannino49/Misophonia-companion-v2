  "abstract": "Background Hyperacusis can be defined as an intolerance of certain everyday sounds, which are perceived as too loud or uncomfortable and which cause significant distress and impairment in the individual’s day-to-day activities. It is important to assess symptoms of sound intolerance and their impact on the patient’s life, so as to evaluate the need for treatment and to assess the effectiveness of treatments. Purpose The aim was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Hyperacusis Impact Questionnaire (HIQ), and the Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire (SSSQ). The 8-item HIQ focuses on assessing the impact of hyperacusis on the patient, while the 5-item SSSQ is designed to assess the type and severity of sound intolerance symptoms. Research Design This was a retrospective cross-sectional study. Study Sample In total, 266 consecutive patients who attended a Tinnitus and Hyperacusis Therapy Clinic in the United Kingdom within a 6-month period. Fifty-five percent were female. The average age was 54 years (standard deviation = 16 years). Data Collection and Analysis Data were collected retrospectively from the records of patients held at the audiology department. Audiological measures were pure-tone audiometry and Uncomfortable Loudness Levels (ULLs). Questionnaires administered in addition to the HIQ and SSSQ were: Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ), and Screening for Anxiety and Depression in Tinnitus. Results Exploratory factor analysis suggested one-factor solutions for both the HIQ and SSSQ. Multiple-causes multiple-indicators (MIMIC) models showed some small influences of gender but negligible effects of age for both the HIQ and SSSQ. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis showed no significant effects of covariates on the ROC curves. Cronbach’s α was 0.93 for the HIQ, and 0.87 for the SSSQ, indicating high internal consistency. Convergent validity was supported by moderate correlations between HQ and HIQ scores and between SSSQ scores and ULLs. Conclusion The HIQ and SSSQ are internally consistent questionnaires that can be used in clinical and research settings.",

      "text": "Hyperacusis can be de ﬁned as an intolerance of certain\neveryday sounds, which are perceived as too loud or uncom-fortable and which cause signi ﬁcant distress and impairment\nin the individual ’s day-to-day activities. There are other def-\ninitions of hyperacusis but most of them are largely in agree-ment with the de ﬁnition proposed here, with some differences\nin details.\n1,2Based on the de ﬁnition proposed here, hyper-\nacusis may be diagnosed if: the patient ’s sound intolerance is\nrelated to the level of certain everyday sounds; the patient\nexperiences signi ﬁcant distress as a result of their sound\nintolerance; sound intolerance signi ﬁcantly affects their day-\nto-day activities; the patient ’s sound intolerance is not better\nexplained by another disorder (e.g., hearing loss, post-trau-\nmatic stress disorder, depression, social phobia, or psychosis).This does not mean that hyperacusis cannot be present in\ncombination with other disorders. However, it is important to\ndetermine whether the main source of sound-induced distressis hyperacusis, other disorders, or a combination of them.\nIt is important to assess symptoms of sound intolerance and\ntheir impact on the patient ’s life to assess the need for treatment\nand assess the improvement produced by a treatment. According\nto the World Health Organization ’s International Classi ﬁcation of\nFunctioning, Disability and Health, the severity of symptoms of a\ncondition is different from the impact of the condition on the\npatient ’sl i f e .\n3Although the severity of symptoms is often corre-\nlated with the impact of the condition on the patient ’s life, they\nare not the same construct. For example, two individuals with the\nsame moderate degree of hearing loss may experiencedifferent degrees of dif ﬁculty in their day-to-day life. There are\nvarious personal and environmental factors that can in ﬂuence the\nimpact of an impairment on the patient ’sl i f e .\n4,5Therefore, it is\nimportant to be able to measure the severity of symptoms and\nimpact separately, to guide the rehabilitation process.\nHyperacusis is often assessed using questionnaires. Vali-\ndated questionnaires in English are the Hyperacusis Ques-\ntionnaire (HQ)6and the Inventory of Hyperacusis Symptoms\n(IHS).7,8The HQ has 14 items covering: the symptoms of\nhyperacusis and hearing loss, the types of sounds that can\ntrigger hyperacusis, and the impact of hyperacusis on the\npatient ’s life. The IHS has 25 items that mainly focus on\nassessing the impact of hyperacusis on the patient ’sl i f e ,b u t\nsome of the items assess the severity of symptoms of hyper-\nacusis. Thus, total scores for both the HQ and the IHS re ﬂecttwo different constructs, making it dif ﬁcult to distinguish\nthe severity and type of symptoms of hyperacusis from theimpact of the hyperacusis.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric\nproperties of two new short questionnaires that were devel-oped for clinical use at the Tinnitus and Hyperacusis Therapy\nSpecialist Clinic (THTSC), Royal Surrey Foundation Trust\n(RSFT), United Kingdom, namely the Hyperacusis ImpactQuestionnaire (HIQ) and the Sound Sensitivity Symptoms\nQuestionnaire (SSSQ). The items in the HIQ were chosen to be\nlargely consistent with some of items in the HQ and IHS thatsolely focus on assessing the impact of hyperacusis on the\npatient. In contrast, the SSSQ was designed to assess the type\nand severity of sound intolerance symptoms, based on thecategories of hyperacusis described by Tyler et al.\n9\nMaterials and Methods\nEthical Approval\nThe study was registered and approved as a clinical audit by\nthe Quality Governance Department at the RSFT. Further\nanalysis of the data was approved by the South West-Corn-wall and Plymouth Research Ethics Committee and the\nResearch and Development department at the RSFT.\nStudy Design and Patients\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted at the\nRSFT. Data were included for 226 consecutive patients whoattended the THTSC within a 6-month period and who had\ncompleted the HIQ and SSSQ. Demographic data for the patients,\nthe results of their audiological investigations, and theirresponses for other self-report questionnaires (described below)\nwere imported from their records held at the Audiology De-\npartment. All questionnaires were completed prior to the startof any treatment, at each patient ’sﬁrst visit to the clinic. Patients\ncompleted the questionnaires in the clinic waiting area in pen\nand paper format without involvement of their audiologist.\nAudiological Measures\nAudiological measures were:\n1. Pure-tone audiogram measured using the procedure rec-\nommended by the British Society of Audiology,10but within addition to the HIQ and SSSQ were: Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, Hyperacusis\nQuestionnaire (HQ), and Screening for Anxiety and Depression in Tinnitus.Results Exploratory factor analysis suggested one-factor solutions for both the HIQ\nand SSSQ.

The across-frequency average (0.25, 0.5, 1,2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz) ULL for the ear with lower average ULL\nis denoted ULLmin. When ULLmin was /C2077 dB HL, sound\nintolerance was deemed to be present.\n13\nInstruments and Procedures\nIn addition to the new questionnaires, the HIQ and SSSQ\n(►Tables 1 and 2), participants completed several validated\nquestionnaires, namely the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory(THI),\n14the Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ),15and the\nScreening for Anxiety and Depression in Tinnitus (SAD-\nT).16As this was a retrospective study based on routine\nclinical data, not all of the patients completed all of themeasures. The number of patients with complete data for\neach analysis is reported when appropriate. All question-naires used are described below.\nHyperacusis Impact Questionnaire\nThe HIQ has eight items that ask respondents to rate how\noften (in number of days) over the past 2 weeks each of\nseveral situations occurred because of certain environmentalsounds that seemed too loud to the respondent, but that\nother people could tolerate well. The items were developed\nbased on common complaints of hyperacusis patients in theclinic and the items are broadly consistent with certain items\nfrom the HQ and IHS that exclusively focus on the impact of\nhyperacusis on the patient. Scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 areassigned for frequencies of 0 to 1 day, 2 to 6 days, 7 to\n10 days, and 11 to 14 days, respectively. The response choices\nwere chosen to be in keeping with response choices for\ncommonly used psychological questionnaires in the UK ’s\nNational Health Service, namely the Patient Health Ques-tionnaire (PHQ-9)\n17and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n(GAD-7).18Those questionnaires also ask “over the last\n2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by the followingproblems? ”The response choices in the PHQ-9 and GAD-7Table 1 Hyperacusis Impact Questionnaire (HIQ)\nPlease answer each item to the best of your abi lity as close to your experience as possible.\nOver the last 2 weeks, how often would you say each of the following has occurred because of certain environmental sounds that\nseemed too loud to you but that people around you could tolerate well?\n1.

The method of scoring isthe same as for the HIQ.\nHyperacusis Questionnaire\nThe HQ has 14-items, each rated on a 4-point Likert scale\nfrom “no”to“yes, a lot ”15.C r o n b a c h ’sαfor the English\nversion of the HQ is 0.88.19The overall score ranges from 0\nto 42. Scores of 22 or more were taken as indicating the\npresence of hyperacusis.13\nTinnitus Handicap Inventory\nThe THI has 25 items, each rated for its impact using a three-\npoint scale: “yes”(four points), “sometimes ”(two points) and\n“no”(zero points). Cronbach ’sαfor the THI is 0.93.20The\noverall score ranges from 0 to 100.\nScreening for Anxiety and Depression in Tinnitus\nThe SAD-T contains four items that match those for the\nphysical health questionnaire (PHQ-4).21Each item is rated\non a four-point Likert scale. Two items relate to experiences\nof anxiety and worry and two items relate to the experience\nof anhedonia and feeling down, depressed or hopeless.Cronbach ’sαfor the SAD-T, based on responses from a\ntinnitus and hyperacusis clinical population, is 0.85. This\nwas calculated but not reported during a study on the\nacceptability and relevance of psychological questionnaires\nin the assessment of patients with tinnitus and/or hyper-acusis.\n16The overall score ranges from 0 to 12. Scores of 4 or\nmore indicate symptoms of anxiety and/or depression.\nData Analysis\nPsychometric Analysis\nLatent variables for the HIQ and SSSQ were evaluated sepa-rately by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) for categorical\nitems, using the weighted least squares mean and varianceadjusted estimator (WLSMV).\n22Eigenvalues above 1 were\nused to identify the most suitable model ﬁt( G u t t m a n - K a i s e r\ncriterion).23,24\nTo further test the number of factors to be retained for the\nHIQ and SSSQ, parallel analysis, based on minimum rank\nfactor analysis (PA-MRFA), was conducted.25Toﬁrst check if\nit was appropriate to use polychoric correlation, the skew-\nness and kurtosis for each item of the scale were calculated;\nvalues above one were considered to indicate that it wasappropriate for polychoric correlation to be used.\n26,27The\nPA-MRFA method compares the real-data percentage of\ncommon variance and the 95thpercentile of the randompercentage of variance based on 500 PA-MRFA random data-\nsets. For a dimension to be retained, the real-data percentageof common variance must be greater than the 95\nthpercentile\nof the random percentage.\nThe identi ﬁed factor structures were evaluated by meas-\nures of absolute and relative ﬁt. Absolute ﬁt measures were\nthe relative Chi-square ( χ2/df: values close to 2 indicate a\nclose ﬁt28), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation\n(RMSEA: values less than 0.05 are required for a close\nﬁt29), and the Standardized Root Mean Residual (SRMR:\nvalues below 0.05 suggest a close ﬁt30). Two measures of\nrelative ﬁt were used, the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI: values\nhigher than 0.9 are required for a close ﬁt31)a n dt h e\nComparative Fit Index (CFI: values higher than 0.95 arerequired for a close ﬁt\n29). The range of communalities, i.e.,\nthe proportion of each variable ’s values that is explained by\nthe latent factor, was calculated for all items; high commu-nalities are required and low communalities (0.0 –0.4) are\nindicative of items that may require removal.\n32\nPotential effects of gender and age were assessed using\nmultiple indicator multiple cause (MIMIC) models.33,34\nMIMIC is a method for assessing if an item in a questionnaireis biased in the sense that responses to that item differ forindividuals with different demographic characteristics (e.g.,\nage or gender), irrespective of the differences in the severity\nof their hyperacusis symptoms or its impact on their lives.\n35\nThe standardized model coef ﬁcients for direct effects were\nconsidered; values below 0.36 are considered small in\nmagnitude.36\nLogistic Regression and Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic (ROC) Curves\nLogistic regression models were used to assess the odds of\nhyperacusis having a signi ﬁcant impact (for the HIQ) and of\nexperiencing sound sensitivity symptoms (for the SSSQ)\nbased on several predictive measures. The analyses were\nbased on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves,which are plots of sensitivity (the proportion of positive\ncases that are classi ﬁed as positive) against (1 —speci ﬁcity)\n(where speci ﬁcity is the proportion of negative cases that are\nclassi ﬁed as negative). Unfortunately, there are no widely\naccepted “gold standards ”for assessing the impact of hyper-\nacusis or for assessing the severity of systems of hyperacusis.Hence, the ROC analyses were based on imperfect standards,\nwhich we refer to in this paper as “bronze standards. ”For the\nHIQ, the bronze standard for classifying a case as positive(hyperacusis having a signi ﬁcant impact vs. non-signi ﬁcant\nimpact) was a score /C2122 on the HQ.\n13For the SSSQ, the\nbronze standard for classifying a case as positive (experienceof abnormal sound sensitivity vs. no abnormal sound sensi-\ntivity) was ULL min /C2077 dB HL.\n13\nArea under the ROC curve (AUC) values were assessed as\nexcellent for values from 0.9 to 1, good for values from 0.8 to\n0.9, and fair for values from 0.7 to 0.8. The Youden J37\ncriterion was used to choose a cut-off point on each ROC\ncurve giving an appropriate balance between sensitivity and\nspeci ﬁcity, where J¼sensitivity /C0(1/C0speci ﬁcity).

      "text": "agreement in classi ﬁcation based on scores for the new\nquestionnaire compared with those for previously validatedmeasures.\n39\nBefore the optimal cut-off points for the HIQ and SSSQ were\nestablished, the Stata command rocreg40,41was used to test for\nthe presence of signi ﬁcant covariates affecting the ROC curve.\nThe ROC curve can be in ﬂuenced by covariates in two ways.\nFirst, a signi ﬁcant covariate can affect the discriminatory\naccuracy of a measure, i.e., the ability to discriminate between\ncases and controls at each level of a covariate. The presence of\nsuch covariates was assessed through testing of the nullhypothesis that the covariate coef ﬁcient was equal to 0\n(with probability p/C200.05), by bootstrapping to produce a\n95% con ﬁdence interval of the covariate coef ﬁcient. Covariate-\nspeciﬁc ROC curves are produced for each level of a signi ﬁcant\ncovariate. For example, if gender was a signi ﬁcant covariate,\nthen a male-speci ﬁc ROC curve and a female-speci ﬁcR O C\ncurve would be produced. Second, the questionnaire score can\nbe affected by a covariate, such as gender, as well as by the\nlatent variable. In this case, signi ﬁcant covariates would be\nidenti ﬁed by a signi ﬁcant t-test result ( p/C200.05). When signi ﬁ-\ncant covariates are identi ﬁed, a ROC regression model with the\ncovariates is used to provide a covariate-adjusted ROC curve.\nReliability and Validity\nThe reliability of each scale was assessed using Cronbach ’s\nα,42the value of αif an item is deleted (AID), and the item\ntotal correlation values (ITC)43. To conclude that a measure is\nreliable, αis required to be greater than 0.7 and the AID lower\nthan the αvalue.\nConcurrent validity was established by calculating the\ncorrelations between HIQ/SSSQ scores and score for previ-ously validated measure of hyperacusis, and also by compar-\ning HIQ and SSSQ scores with ULLs. Discriminant validity was\nexplored by calculating correlations between HIQ and SSSQ\ntotal scores and PTA values for the better ears. PTA values\nhave been found not to be related to hyperacusis,\n13,44,45so\nwe expected small correlations of PTA values with HIQ and\nSSSQ scores. The non-parametric Spearman ’s correlation\ncoefﬁcient (rho, ρ) was used to assess validity, due to the\nskewness of the data. A value of ρ/C210.7 is considered as\nstrong, 0.4 /C20ρ/C200.6 is considered as moderate, and ρ/C200.3 is\nconsidered as weak.46\nThe Mplus software47was used for the EFA and MIMIC\nanalysis, parallel analysis was performed using a freeware\nprogram called FACTOR,48and the statistical software SPSS\nversion 25.0 (IBM)49and STATA (version 13)50were used for\nthe rest of the analysis.\nResults\nSample Characteristics\nOf the 266 participants, 120 (45%) were male and 146 (55%)were female. Their ages ranged from 17 to 97 years with a\nmean of 54 years (standard deviation, SD ¼16 years). The\ngrand mean PTA across ears was 22.4 dB HL (SD ¼15 dB)\n(n¼253). The PTA did not signi ﬁcantly differ between gen-\nders ( p¼0.5). The grand mean PTA was 19 dB HL (SD ¼13 dB)for the better ear and 26 dB HL (SD ¼18.9 dB) for the worse\near. Based on the PTA for the better ear, 64% of the partic-ipants had no hearing loss, 29% had mild hearing loss, and 7%\nhad moderate hearing loss.\nAll patients had tinnitus. ULLmin values were 77 dB HL or\nbelow, indicating sound intolerance, for 30% of patients (60 out\nof 198 patients with available ULLmin values). The average\nvalue of ULLmin was 80.2 dB HL (SD ¼6.9) for the men ( n¼84)\nand 75.8 dB HL (SD ¼10.4) for the women ( n¼114), and this\ndifference was signi ﬁcant ( t¼3.33, df ¼196, p¼0.001). The\nmean SAD-Tscore was 3.6 (SD ¼3.8) for the men ( n¼117) and\n4.6 (SD ¼4.2) for the women ( n¼142) and the difference\napproached but did not reach signi ﬁcance ( p¼0.06). Of 248\nparticipants who answered the questions about their mentalhealth history, 116 (47%) reported a past mental illness and 98\n(40%) were under mental health care.\nPsychometric Analysis\nThis was an exploratory factor analysis.\nHIQ\nEFA for the 8-item HIQ was based on scores for 232 partic-\nipants and was performed using Oblimin rotation. Oneeigenvalue above 1 (6.092) was produced by the sample\ncorrelation matrix, which according to the Guttman-Kaiser\ncriterion supports a one-factor model for the data.

These effects are considered to be of small magnitude.\nAdjusted for gender, signi ﬁcant effects of age were found\nfor two items. The expected scores for HIQ3 and HIQ4\ndecreased with increasing age, but only by /C00.008 and\n/C00.009 units per year, respectively, which can be considered\nnegligible.\nIn summary, there was a small effect of gender and a\nnegligible effect of age.\nSSSQ\nAdjusted for age, for a given sound sensitivity score, the\nexpected score for item SS1 (sounds “too loud ”) was higher\nfor women than for men by 0.306 units on the 0 to 3 scale.\nThere were no effects of gender or age for the four remaining\nitems. As there was an effect of gender for only one item, andthe effect had a small magnitude, the overall score for the\nSSSQ can be considered as unaffected by gender or age.\nLogistic Regression\nThe odds of receiving a diagnosis of an impact of hyperacusis\nbased on an HQ score /C2122 increased signi ﬁcantly with\nincreasing HIQ score, each one-unit increase in HIQ score\ngiving a 15% increase in the odds of a positive diagnosis of\nhyperacusis impact based on the HQ score ( ►Table 4 ).\nThe odds of receiving a diagnosis of having abnormal\nsound sensitivity based on ULLmin /C2077 dB HL increased\nsigniﬁcantly with increasing SSSQ score, each one-unit in-\ncrease in SSSQ score giving a 12% increase in the odds of a\npositive diagnosis of abnormal sound sensitivity based on\nULLmin ( ►Table 4 ).ROC Curves\nGiven that small effects of gender and age were found in the\nway that participants responded to certain items on the HIQand SSSQ, ROC regression analysis was performed to deter-\nmine whether covariate-adjusted or covariate-speci ﬁcR O C\ncurves should be created. The analysis showed that age andgender did not have signi ﬁcant covariate effects upon the\nROC curves, on either their performance or their discrimina-\ntory ability, for the HIQ or SSSQ ( p>0.05 in all cases). Thus, it\nwas not necessary for covariate-adjusted or covariate-spe-\nciﬁc ROC curves to be created.\nHIQ\nUsing HQ scores as a reference, the AUC for the HIQ was 0.77,\nwhich is considered as fair ( ►Fig. 1 ,►Table 5 ).

      "text": "imperfect indicators of sound sensitivity. The highest value\nof J[sensitivity /C0(1/C0speci ﬁcity)] was only 0.268\n(►Appendix 1, Table A2 ), and this occurred for a score of 8\non the HIQ, for which sensitivity was 0.52 and speci ﬁcity was\n0.75. Cohen ’s Kappa was 0.27 for agreement between diag-\nnosis using the SSSQ and using ULLmin when a cut-off point\nof 8 was used, which is only fair ( ►Table 6 ). However, as can\nbe seen in ►Fig. 2 , the ROC curve for the SSSQ is somewhat\njagged. Assuming that the underlying distributions are nor-\nmal, an AUC of 0.67 corresponds to a discriminability index, d\n′, of 0.511. For this value of d ′, a better balance between\nsensitivity and speci ﬁcity is obtained using a cut-off score of\napproximately 4.7, for which sensitivity is 0.60 and speci ﬁc-\nity is also 0.60. Since scores can only take integer values, in\npractice scores above 4 would be taken as indicating thepresence of sound sensitivity. Cohen ’s Kappa for an SSSQ cut-\noff score of 4 was 0.22.\nReliability\nCronbach ’sαwas 0.93 for the HIQ and 0.87 for the SSSQ,\nindicating good internal consistency for both questionnaires.No problematic items were found, since αdid not increase\nwhen any single item was deleted and the ITC values were\nneither too high nor too low (range: HIQ, 0.64 –0.82; SSSQ,\n0.57 –0.77).\nThe internal consistency of the SAD-T was replicated in\nthis sample, with a satisfactory Cronbach ’sαof 0.91. Cron-\nbach ’sαwas not increased by the deletion of any item and the\nITC values were between 0.76 and 0.84, which is satisfactory.\nValidity\nAge was not signi ﬁcantly correlated with HIQ score but it was\nsigniﬁcantly negatively correlated with SSSQ score(►Table 7 ). Scores for the SAD-T and THI were moderately\ncorrelated with scores for the HIQ and the SSSQ, providing\nevidence for construct validity. Evidence for concurrent\nconvergent validity was provided by moderate correlationsbetween HIQ and SSSQ scores and HQ scores, as well as a\nmoderate correlation between SSSQ scores and ULLmin\nvalues. The correlations between HIQ scores and ULLminand PTA values of the better ear and between SSSQ scores and\nPTA values of the better ear were weak, indicating discrimi-\nnant validity of the HIQ and SSSQ.\nDiscussion\nIn this study we evaluated the psychometric properties of the\nHIQ, which is designed to assess the impact of hyperacusis on\na patient ’s life, and the SSSQ, which is designed to assess\nsymptoms of abnormal sound sensitivity, in a clinical sample\nof patients with tinnitus of whom approximately 30% alsohad hyperacusis. Both questionnaires were found to be\ninternally consistent, with Cronbach ’sαof 0.93 for the HIQ\nand 0.87 for the SSSQ.\nEFA showed that both the HIQ and the SSSQ are one-factor\nquestionnaires. The one-factor nature for the HIQ may indi-\ncate that the psychological and functional components ofhyperacusis are not separable. This is consistent with the\ndeﬁnition of hyperacusis, which is deemed to be present only\nif the sound intolerance causes signi ﬁcant distress in a\npatient ’s life, affecting their day-to-day activities and/or\nmood.\nTo the authors ’knowledge the MIMIC model has not\npreviously been used to evaluate any of the questionnaires\navailable for assessment of hyperacusis. MIMIC is a method\nfor assessing differential item functioning (DIF). When asigniﬁcant DIF occurs for a speci ﬁc questionnaire item, this\nindicates a bias for that item, in that responses to that item\ndiffer for individuals with different demographic character-istics (e.g., age or gender), irrespective of the differences on\nthe variable under study.\n35For example, DIF is present if men\nand women, or young and old people, or Back and WhiteTable 5 AUC values for the HIQ and SSSQ, with standard errors\nin parentheses, together with 95% con ﬁdence intervals (CI)\nMeasure AUC (SE) 95% CI\nHyperacusis\nHIQ 0.77 (0.07) 0.64 –0.91\nSSSQ 0.67 (0.04) 0.59 –0.75\nAbbreviations: HIQ, Hyperacusis Impact Questionnaire; SSSQ, Sound\nSensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire.\nTable 6 Cohen ’s Kappa (with p-values in parentheses) for\ndiagnosis agreement using a cut-off score of 11.5 for the HIQ\na n dc u t - o f fs c o r e so f4a n d8f o rt h eS S S Q\nCohen ’sK a p p a( p)\nHQ ULL category\nHIQ 0.49 ( <0.001)\nSSSQ (4) 0.22 (0.001)\nSSSQ (8) 0.26 ( <0.001)\nAbbreviations: HIQ, Hyperacusis Impact Questionnaire; SSSQ, Sound\nSensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire.\nFig. 2 Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the Sensi-\ntivity Symptoms Questionnaire (SSSQ).

      "text": "people, with a given severity of the impact of hyperacusis\nrespond differently to an item on HIQ. It is important to\nminimize such biases to ensure that a questionnaire is validfor a range of demographic characteristics.\nIn this study, a MIMIC model for the HIQ showed that for a\ngiven level of the impact of hyperacusis, after adjusting forage, gender affected the scores for items HIQ3 (lack of\nconcentration), HIQ4 (unable to relax), and HIQ8 (tire quick-\nly) by 0.197, 0.238, and 0.282 units, respectively, withwomen scoring higher. Similarly, for the SSSQ, for a given\nsound sensitivity, the score for item SS1 (sounds “too loud ”)\nwas higher for women than for men by 0.306 units. Theseeffects of gender may be related to the fact that on average\nwomen had signi ﬁcantly lower ULLmin values than men.\nItems similar to HIQ3, HIQ4, and HIQ8 are used in the IHS and\nHQ, so it is important for future studies to explore if similar\neffects of gender occur for those questionnaires and howthey can be minimized. Future studies using larger samples\nshould also use the MIMIC model or other methods for\ntesting DIF\n35to assess whether there are biases for items\nin the HIQ and SSSQ linked to demographic factors that were\nnot included in this study.\nTo sum up, there were minor effects of gender on scores\nfor a few items of the HIQ and SSSQ. However, the ROC\nregression analyses showed that age and gender did not have\nsigniﬁcant covariate effects upon the ROC outcome, on either\nits performance or its discriminatory ability, for the HIQ or\nSSSQ. Thus, the scores are largely invariant with respect to\nage and gender. It is important that future studies explore theimpact of measurement bias both in clinical practice and\nresearch.\nThe total scores for the HIQ and SSSQ were moderately\ncorrelated with total HQ score. This indicates that the HIQ\nand SSSQ are measuring related things to the HQ but are not\nmeasuring an identical construct. A strong correlation wasnot expected, because these new questionnaires were\ndesigned speci ﬁcally to assess separately the impact of\nhyperacusis and severity of its symptoms, while the HQassesses the severity of symptoms of hyperacusis combined\nwith its impact. In addition some of the items of the HQ do\nnot appear to assess hyperacusis-related constructs.\n19For\nexample, item 5 of the HQ is about “Difﬁculty listening to\nconversations in noise, ”which is probably more related to\nhearing loss than to hyperacusis. In addition, scores for item1o ft h eH Q “Use earplugs or earmuffs to reduce noise ”are\nonly weakly correlated with scores for other items of the HQ,\nindicating that scores for this item may not be related tohyperacusis or its impact.\n19Scores for both the HIQ and the\nSSSQ were moderately correlated with scores for the SAD-T\nand THI. This shows that they are measuring different butrelated constructs. The close relationship between hyper-\nacusis, tinnitus, and mental health is well known.\n8,51\nSSSQ scores were moderately correlated with ULLmin\nvalues but HIQ scores were only weakly correlated with\nULLmin values. This is as expected, since the HIQ is notintended to measure severity of the symptoms of hyper-\nacusis, while ULLmin values do partly re ﬂect the severity of\nhyperacusis. As expected, the correlations between HIQ andSSSQ scores and PTA values of the better ear were very small.\nThis is consistent with past studies that suggest that hyper-\nacusis is not related to audiometric thresholds.\n13,15,52\nAs noted earlier, there is no widely accepted gold standard\nfor the assessment of the impact of hyperacusis. The HIQ was\nintended to remedy this gap by solely assessing the impact ofhyperacusis, without dilution or contamination by other\nconstructs such as hearing dif ﬁculty and severity of sound\nsensitivity symptoms. Therefore, we did not expect to obtainhigh sensitivity and speci ﬁcity when using the HQ as a\nreference for determining a cut off value for the HIQ. Future\nstudies should further examine how the severity of theimpact of hyperacusis should be classi ﬁed based on HIQ\ntotal score.\nThe SSSQ included items intended to assess different\ntypes of sound sensitivity, ranging from various forms of\nhyperacusis (items 1, 2, 3, and 5) to misophonia (item 4).\nGiven that there is no gold standard for assessing the type orTable 7 Spearman ’s correlation coef ﬁcients (with p-values in parentheses) between scores for the HIQ and SSSQ and other\nvariables, speci ﬁcally age, PTA of the better ear, scores for the SAD-T, HQ, and THI, ULLmin values, and hyperacusis category based\non ULLmin\nHIQ SSSQ\nMeasure n ρ(p) N ρ(p)\nAge 233 /C00.07 (0.233) 245 /C00.20 (0.001)\nPTA of better ear 225 0.18 (0.008) 237 0.06 (0.33)SAD-T 229 0.64 ( <0.001) 243 0.47 ( <0.001)\nHQ 67 0.59 ( <0.001) 71 0.68 ( <0.001)\nTHI 66 0.54 ( <0.001) 70 0.56 ( <0.001)\nHyperacusis category based on ULLmin 175 0.19 (0.011) 184 0.27 ( <0.001)\nULLmin 175 /C00.22 (0.003) 184 /C00.33 (<0.001)\nNote.

There areseveral studies that suggest that ULLmin values /C2077 dB HL\nare associated with the experience of hyperacusis.\n13,53,54\nULLs may also be reduced among patients with misophonia,\nand Jastreboff and Jastreboff55reported that misophonia is\nalmost always present in cases of severe hyperacusis. Severe\nhyperacusis is also characterized by reduced ULLs mainly athigher frequencies.\n56So, it seemed reasonable here to use\nULLmin values as a reference, even though they are an\nimperfect measure of the severity of sound sensitivitysymptoms.\n57Future studies should further explore how to\nclassify sound sensitivity symptoms into different categories\nof severity based on the SSSQ total score.\nConclusions\nIn this paper we introduced two new brief questionnaires:\nthe HIQ, which assesses the impact of hyperacusis on a\npatient ’s life, and the SSSQ, which assesses the types and\nseverity of symptoms of sound intolerance. Both question-\nnaires were found to have high internal consistency. The HIQ\nand SSSQ can be used to assist audiologists and otherclinicians in making a diagnosis of hyperacusis. A cut-off\npoint of 11/24 for the HIQ gave a sensitivity of 0.74 and a\nspeci ﬁcity of 0.8 in the diagnosis of hyperacusis, using\ndiagnosis based on HQ scores as a reference. For the SSSQ,\na cut-off point of 4.7 gave a sensitivity of 0.60 and a\nspeci ﬁcity of 0.60 in diagnosing sound tolerance problems,\nusing ULLmin values as a reference.\nMIMIC models revealed biases for certain items in the HIQ\nand SSSQ, although the biases were small. These items havealso been used in some other hyperacusis questionnaires.\nTherefore, future research should explore this further, not\nonly for the questionnaires tested here but also for other\ncommonly used hyperacusis questionnaires.\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors would like to thank the members of the\nTinnitus & Hyperacusis Therapy Specialist Clinic at theRoyal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust, Guildford, United\nKingdom, for their help in data collection.
