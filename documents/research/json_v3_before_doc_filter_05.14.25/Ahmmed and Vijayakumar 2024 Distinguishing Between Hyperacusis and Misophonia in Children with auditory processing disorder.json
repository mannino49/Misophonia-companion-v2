  "abstract": "Objectives: Decreased sound tolerance (DST) is common in children with auditory processing disorder (APD). This study aimed to differentiate between hyperacusis and misophonia in children with APD. Design: A retrospective study evaluating outcomes of structured history and co-morbidity following Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. Misophonia was considered as oversensitivity to eating/chewing sounds and hyperacusis as oversensitivity to other sounds. Study sample: Two hundred and seventy-nine children (160 males; 119 females), 6-16 year-olds with NVIQ ≥80, diagnosed with APD between January 2021 and December 2022. Results: One hundred and forty-three out of 279 children with APD had DST, of which 107 had hyperacusis (without misophonia) and 36 had misophonia. Misophonia co-existed with hyperacusis in 35 children (97%), and in one child misophonia occurred without hyperacusis. Misophonia was prevalent in older children, in females, and those with tinnitus. Fear and being upset were predominant emotional response in hyperacusis (without misophonia) while disgust and verbal abuse were prevalent in misophonia (with or without hyperacusis). Compared to children without DST, the hyperacusis (without misophonia) and misophonia (with or without hyperacusis) groups had significantly higher prevalence of ADHD, anxiety, and language impairment. Educational difficulties were similar in APD irrespective of the presence or absence of DST. Despite higher tinnitus prevalence in misophonia (with or without hyperacusis) along with similar co-morbidities and educational difficulties in both hyperacusis (without misophonia) and misophonia (with or without hyperacusis), the misophonia (with or without hyperacusis) group surprisingly had less support at school which was reflected in fewer Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP). Conclusions: In APD misophonia mostly co-exists with hyperacusis, with differences in emotional responses, tinnitus prevalence, and gender distribution when compared to hyperacusis (without misophonia). Increase in awareness about misophonia is needed, as children with misophonia may have unidentified needs. Larger scale prospective study is required to clarify if misophonia evolves from hyperacusis, and to explore the factors underlying ‘misophonia with hyperacusis’ and ‘misophonia without hyperacusis’. For clarity, DST studies need to specify if hyperacusis or misophonia co-existed when referring to hyperacusis or misophonia.",

Introduction  \nChildren with oversensitivity to sounds or decreased sound tolerance (DST) , that mainly \nrelates  to hyperacusis and misophonia,  makes up a significant proportion of referrals to \npaediatric audiology clinics . Differentiating between hyperacusis and misophonia is \nimpo rtant for appropriate management, which has been difficult due to lack of consensus \non the definition, similarities in presentation, and descriptions that are based on diverse \npopulations in different studies [1-4].  Hyperacusis and misophonia not only  co-exist with \neach other [1] but also with other conditions. Overlapping co -morbidities is a recognised \nfeature of neurodiverse and mental health conditions [5]. A diagnostic approach involving \ndetailed clinical history [6] and evaluation of symptoms  related to functional connectivity of \nrelated neural networks in identifying unique characteristics as well as features common to \nother co -morbid conditions in a specific population would be helpful. The Research Domain \nCriteria (RDoC) frame work is such an approach  that has been  recommended to be utilized \nin evaluating DST  [2].  \n \n Swedo and colleagues (2022)  suggested that misophonia is associated with impaired \nauditory processing, emotional regulation, and learning  [3]. Association between a uditory  \nprocessing disorder  (APD)  and hyperacusis has been reported , both in children  [7] and \nadults [8]. Not much is known about misophonia in APD . RDoC framework is already in \nclinical  use to evaluate APD  [9,10]  which  enquires about different aspects of DST in addition \nto relevant co -morbidities and educational concerns .  \n \nCurrent definitions of hyperacusis and misophonia lack clarity [1]. Hyperacusis is seen as \nDST related to the physical characteristics of sound such as loudness, but misophonia has \nJournal Pre-proof"

Both \nmisophonia and hyperacusis are associated with strong emotional responses , arising from \nprimary or secondary activation of the limbic system.  Additionally , hyperacusis and \nmisophonia have been reported to co -exist  [1] but the extent of overlap is not known. \nTherefore it is not clear how to differentiate between hyperacusis and misophonia based on \nthe physical characteristics of sound or specific emotional r esponse s. To ensure clarity, the \ncurrent study simply defined misophonia as over -sensitivity to sound of eating/chewing, the \npredominant trigger  [11-13], and hyperacusis as oversensitivity to other sounds . Such  \ndefinition s were felt as a good starting po int to develop our understanding of misophonia \nand hyperacusis , with the scope to add additional characteristics based on the outcome of \ninitial comparison.
