  "abstract": "Misophonia has been characterized as intense negative reactions to specific trigger sounds (often orofacial sounds like chewing, sniffling, or slurping). However, recent research suggests high-level, contextual, and multisensory factors are also involved. We recently demonstrated that neurotypicals' negative reactions to aversive sounds (e.g., nails scratching a chalkboard) are attenuated when the sounds are synced with positive attributable video sources (PAVS; e.g., tearing a piece of paper). To assess whether this effect generalizes to misophonic triggers, we developed a Sound-Swapped Video (SSV) database for use in misophonia research. In Study 1, we created a set of 39 video clips depicting common trigger sounds (original video sources, OVS) and a corresponding set of 39 PAVS temporally synchronized with the OVS videos. In Study 2, participants (N = 34) rated the 39 PAVS videos for their audiovisual match and pleasantness. We selected the 20 PAVS videos with best match scores for use in Study 3. In Study 3, a new group of participants (n = 102) observed the 20 selected PAVS and 20 corresponding OVS and judged the pleasantness or unpleasantness of each sound in the two contexts accompanying each video. Afterward, participants completed the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ). The results of Study 3 show a robust attenuating effect of PAVS videos on the reported unpleasantness of trigger sounds: trigger sounds were rated as significantly less unpleasant when paired with PAVS than OVS. Moreover, this attenuating effect was present in nearly every participant (99 out of 102) regardless of their score on the MQ. In fact, we found a moderate positive correlation between the PAVS-OVS difference and misophonia severity scores. Overall our results provide validation that the SSV database is a useful stimulus database to study how misophonic responses can be modulated by visual contexts. Here, we release the SSV database with the best 18 PAVS and 18 OVS videos used in Study 3 along with aggregate ratings of audio-video match and pleasantness (https://osf.io/3ysfh/). We also provide detailed instructions on how to produce these videos, with the hope that this database grows and improves through collaborations with the community of misophonia researchers.",

Sound-Swapped Video Database for Misophonia\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the early 2000’s, Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ (2001) coined\nmisophonia as “the hatred of sound, ” where some individuals\nhave intense emotional and physical reactions to speciﬁc trigger\nsounds. Everyday sounds, such as chewing, breathing, drinking,\nnasal sounds, or ﬁnger tapping, can act as triggers to people\nwith misophonia (Edelstein et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014).\nAlthough many people might ﬁnd the sound of slurping at\nthe dinner table rude or annoying, individuals with misophonia\nmay respond to that trigger sound with extreme, immediate\nemotional, physical, behavioral, and cognitive responses ranging\nfrom feelings of disgust, anxiety, and anger to an uncontrollable\ndesire to physically harm the person producing it (Edelstein\net al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014; Swedo et al., 2021). The misophonic\ntrigger reaction is one of heightened autonomic arousal and\nphysiological responses, such as tightened muscles or pressure in\none’s chest, arms, head, or across the body (Edelstein et al., 2013;\nBrout et al., 2018). At times, individuals with misophonia may\nsuﬀer functional impediments in their occupational, academic,\nand social lives (Schröder et al., 2013; Webber and Storch,\n2015) as a result of their emotional, cognitive, physiological, or\nbehavioral responses to trigger sounds, including avoiding or\nleaving situations.\nMisophonia was initially considered to be an audiological\ndisorder, but recent research has found that individuals’ trigger\nreactions are not tied to speciﬁc physical characteristics of the\nsound like pitch, timbre, or volume (Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ,\n2014). More recently, interdisciplinary perspectives have brought\nto light a more holistic understanding of the misophonic\nexperience. Recently, a cohort of experts has established a\nconsensus deﬁnition for misophonia that takes these diﬀerent\nfactors into consideration. According to Swedo et al. (2021),\nmisophonia is “a disorder of decreased tolerance to speciﬁc\nsounds or stimuli associated with these sounds” associated with\n“the speciﬁc pattern or meaning to an individual” (p. 22).\nThe misophonic trigger response is idiosyncratic and tied to\nindividual diﬀerences (Brout et al., 2018), with growing evidence\nthat contextual factors, such as an individual’s perceived level of\ncontrol, the context where a trigger stimulus is experienced, and\nthe interpersonal relationships involved, all modulate the trigger\nresponse (Edelstein et al., 2020; Swedo et al., 2021).\nImportantly, the trigger response may be inﬂuenced by higher-\norder contexts learned alongside trigger sounds. Edelstein et al.\n(2020) found that contextual information that is presented\nalongside a sound can change the way it is perceived. In their\nexperiment, they asked control participants and participants\nwith misophonia to rate the aversiveness of sounds from\nthree categories: human eating sounds (a common misophonic\ntrigger), animal eating sounds, or no eating sounds. They found\nthat participants with misophonia rated human eating sounds\nthat they incorrectly identiﬁed as animal eating sounds or as\nnon-eating sounds as less aversive compared to when they\ncorrectly identiﬁed them as human eating sounds. Their ﬁndings\nsuggest that the attributed source of a sound inﬂuences its\nperceived aversiveness.\nNeuroimaging work by Kumar et al. (2017) found that\nwhen individuals with misophonia perceive trigger sounds,their anterior insular cortex has increased activity, resulting in\nheightened salience and emotional response and interoception\nin response to trigger sounds. However, in more recent work,\nKumar et al. (2021) propose that this increased response\nis not a response to sound itself, but a result of “hyper-\nmirroring” in higher-order motor systems tied to the perception\nand production of trigger sounds. They found that compared\nto controls, the misophonia group had stronger connectivity\nbetween (1) the auditory, visual, and ventral premotor cortex\nresponsible for orofacial movements, (2) the auditory cortex and\norofacial motor areas during sound perception generally, and\n(3) stronger activation in the orofacial motor area in response\nto trigger sounds. They propose the sound and visual cues tied\nto the sound are not the cause of increased responses. Rather,\nthey are the medium through which the motor action of a\nsound-maker is mirrored by an individual with misophonia,\ndriving increased arousal responses. Their ﬁndings implicate\nthe mirror neuron system in the experience of misophonia.\nWhen an individual with misophonia hears or sees another\nperson doing a triggering action, auditory and visual mirroring\nprocesses allow them to create a representation of these actions\n(Rizzolatti et al., 1996; Aglioti and Pazzaglia, 2010), including\ntheir behavioral intentions in social interactions (Gallese, 2009).\nThe motor basis for misophonia supports the hypothesis that\nhigh-level contexts, including the interpretation of social intent\nof the trigger producer, may play a role in the experience of\nmisophonic trigger responses.\nAs such, we hypothesize that individuals with misophonia\nmay have learned negative associations between trigger sounds\nand their source, which are predominantly orofacial sounds\nproduced by others during eating or during repetitive movements\n(Jager et al., 2020). We propose that if we can disrupt this\nassociation by providing a plausible alternative visual source,\nindividuals with misophonia may experience an alleviated\nmisophonic trigger response. Past research supports the role\nthat visual capture has on the experience of sounds. Cox (2008)\nfound that the concurrent presentation of an image associated\nwith a horrible sound resulted in participants perceiving the\nsound more horribly than when it was presented with an\nunassociated or control image. Thus, a new association provided\nby static visual cues aﬀected people’s response to horrible sounds.\nMoreover, we know that visual-auditory integration can be\nstrengthened by temporal synchronization , such as in the McGurk\neﬀect : making ambiguous auditory information like phonemes\ndiﬀerentially discernable depending on mouth shape paired with\nit (/ba/perceived as/da/when participants view lips creating/ga/;\nMcGurk and MacDonald, 1976).\nRecently, Samermit et al. (2019) expanded on the role\nof synchronized audio-visual integration in the perception\nof aversive sounds. In that study, we presented neurotypical\nobservers with a set of aversive sounds (e.g., sound of nails\nscratching on a chalkboard) synced with either the Original Video\nSource (OVS; e.g., a video of someone dragging nails down a\nchalkboard) or a Positive Alternative Video Source (PAVS; e.g., a\nvideo of someone playing the ﬂute). Participants provided ratings\nofdiscomfort (how comfortable or uncomfortable the sound\nmade them feel), unpleasantness (how pleasant or unpleasant\nthe sound was), and bodily sensations (the intensity of any\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 890829"

Across\nall three measures, we found that the cross-sensory temporal\nsyncing of aversive sounds to positive alternative video sources\n(PAVS) attenuated the negative responses compared to the\npresentation of sounds with the original video source (OVS).\nWe hypothesize that the ﬁndings of Samermit et al. (2019)\nwill extend to modulate misophonic trigger reactions: pairing a\nmisophonic trigger sound with a PAVS will reduce the negative\nresponse to the sound. Testing this hypothesis experimentally\nrequired us to develop a novel database of misophonic trigger\nstimuli: Trigger sounds along with their OVS that produced the\ntrigger sound, and the same trigger sounds synched with PAVS\nthat could feasibly have produced those sounds. In order for the\ntemporal synchronization of visual and auditory cues to have any\npotential eﬀect on misophonic trigger reactions, we needed to\nensure that our stimuli (1) had well-matched audio and visual\nsynchronization, and (2) that the PAVS were actually perceived\nmore positively than OVS.\nHere we present our 3-part methodology for the development\nand evaluation of a Sound-Swapped Video (SSV) database for\nmisophonia, which we release for use in research. The database\nincludes 20 pairs of PAVS and OVS videos along with the original\ntrigger sound audio ﬁles, and aggregate ratings of each of the\nstimuli. In Study 1, we present the process we developed to\ngenerate and evaluate these audio-visual stimuli.\nIn Study 1, we conducted an idea-generation study to identify\nexamples of alternative videos to create. In Study 2, we present\nthe validation of 39 PAVS stimuli to identify a subset of stimuli\nthat are perceived as relatively pleasant and have adequate audio-\nvideo match. In Study 3, we presented individuals with the 20\nbest PAVS and their associated OVS, to identify whether trigger\nsounds paired with PAVS are perceived as more pleasant than\nthe same sounds paired with OVS. Although we recruited a\ngeneral population for these studies, we collected responses on\nMisophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014) allowing us\nto relate participants’ responses to these sounds to their self-\nreported sensitivity to misophonic triggers.\nThe validated Sound-Swapped Video (SSV) database for\nmisophonia is available on OSF1for use and collaboration by\nmisophonia researchers.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nHere we present the methodologies for Study 1 (Generation and\nEvaluation of Audio-Visual Stimuli), Study 2 (Evaluation of 39\nPAVS stimuli), and Study 3 (Evaluation of the best 20 PAVS and\n20 OVS stimuli).\nStudy 1: Generation and Evaluation of\nAudio-Visual Stimuli\nStimuli\nBased on an analysis of the 80 interviews, we generated a list\nof commonly reported trigger sounds and grouped them into\n1See https://www.ipr.edu/blogs/sound-design-for-visual-media/foley-sound-\neﬀects-sound-designfor more information on Foley Sound Design/the following ten categories: crunchy chewing, wet chewing,\nslurping, swishing, sniﬄing, gulping, drumming, scraping,\nclicking, and squeaking.\nInterview Process\nWe identiﬁed each individual’s top three triggers from a set of\nsemi-structured interviews with 80 participants with misophonia.\nThese interviews were part of a longer-term project to explore\nhow diﬀerent high-level contexts such as one’s social environment\nand social interactions, attention, visual cues, or experience of\nagency and control may be related to participants’ misophonic\nresponses. As such, these interviews were designed to be\nidiographic (Molenaar, 2004; Barlow and Nock, 2009) and\nunderstand in-depth an individual participant’s relationship with\ntheir misophonic trigger sounds and reactions.\nParticipants were recruited from the greater Bay Area,\nCalifornia and Santa Cruz, California through the psychology\ndepartment’s undergraduate participant pool, by word of mouth,\nand through the use of recruitment ﬂyers on social media. Prior\nto the core interview, participants completed a pre-screen phone\ncall with one of the researchers to conﬁrm their experiences\nwith trigger sounds were consistent with existing descriptions of\nmisophonic trigger reactions.\nBefore participating in the interview, participants completed\na consent form and the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu\net al., 2014). The MQ consists of three sections, including the\nMisophonia Symptom Scale (where participants were asked to rate\nhow sensitive they are to a category of sound compared to other\npeople), the Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors Scale (where\nparticipants rate their reactions associated with misophonia\nsymptoms), and the Misophonia Severity Scale . The ﬁrst section,\nthe Misophonia Symptom Scale, consists of 7 items, where\nparticipants can indicate speciﬁc sound sensitivities. Participants\nrespond to items like “Nasal sounds” or “People eating” between\n0 (Not at all True) to 4 (Always True). The second section, the\nMisophonia Emotions and Behaviors Scale, assesses emotional\nand behavioral responses to trigger sounds, and consists of 10\nitems (e.g., “physically aggressive” or “leave environment”) with\nthe same response scale as section one. These ﬁrst two sections\nare summed into a total MQ Sensitivity Score, which ranges\nfrom 0 to 68 points.\nThe ﬁnal section, the Misophonia Severity Scale, consists\nof a single question where participants rate the severity\nof their sensitivity from 0 (minimal) to 15 (very severe).\nA score above 7 on this scale indicates clinically signiﬁcant\nmisophonic reactions. For participants in this interview about\ntheir misophonic experiences, the mean Misophonia Sensitivity\nScore (combined score on the ﬁrst two sections; maximum 68)\nwas 36.1 ( SD: 10.5) and the mean Severity Score (maximum\n15) was 5.5 ( SD: 2.2). This is consistent with existing research\nwhere Wu et al. (2014) found a clinical population had a\nmean Misophonia Sensitivity Score of 31.21 ( SD: 7.64), and\nZhou et al. (2017) found a clinical population of students\nin China had a mean Misophonia Sensitivity Score of 33.1\n(SD: 10.73).

Sound-Swapped Video Database for Misophonia\nScale, and 0.843 for the Total score (the combination of\nthese two parts).\nThe interview examined participants’ experiences with\nmisophonia including questions on their trigger sounds and\ntrigger reactions, the relationship between social experiences and\ntheir trigger reactions, and how other multimodal experiences,\nsuch as seeing the source of a sound, may be related to their\ntrigger reactions. Each semi-structured interview was conducted\non Zoom with an average length of 65 min. Participants were\nasked 32 primary questions and were asked follow up questions\nat the interviewer’s discretion. The interview was split into six\nsections:\n1. Characterization of trigger sounds and trigger reactions,\ne.g., “What are your 3 worst trigger sounds? Why are they\nthe worst?”\n2. Personal and family history of misophonic experiences,\ne.g., “How old were you when you ﬁrst experienced a\nmisophonic response to a sound?”\n3. Contextualizing trigger reactions, e.g., “Is there anything\nthat makes your trigger sounds more tolerable for you? If\nso, how/why?”\n4. Top-down eﬀects and contexts associated with trigger\nreactions, e.g., “Has there ever been a time when the\npresence of trigger sounds aﬀected your ability to focus\non your goals?”).\n5. Dynamic factors associated with trigger reactions, e.g., “Do\nyou notice any diﬀerence in how you react to trigger sounds\nwhen you haven’t slept enough?”\n6. Multisensory experiences similar to trigger reactions, e.g.,\n“Have you ever SEEN anything that makes you feel the\nsame as when you hear a trigger sound?”\nWe categorized the top 3 trigger sounds into high level\ncategories, and used these categories as seed ideas for our stimuli.\nVideo generation process: For each trigger category, we\nconstructed a number of audiovisual stimuli including OVS of the\ntriggers (e.g., a video recording of a person chewing chips) and\nPAVS of the triggers (e.g., a video recording of a person tearing\na piece of paper, in sync with the sound of chewing chips). This\nwas done in 4 stages, which we describe below. A more detailed\nmanual with step-by-step instructions is available here: (see text\nfootnote 2).\nStage 1: Generating Ideas for Positive Attributable\nVideo Sources\nTo generate ideas for what alternative sources might map\nwell with each trigger sound, we used a combination of two\napproaches: (1) brainstorming sessions among the researchers\nand (2) collecting behavioral responses from naïve participants to\nthe sounds. In the brainstorming sessions, researchers listened to\nor talked about the categories of trigger sounds determined from\nparticipants’ interviews, such as slurping or crunchy chewing, and\nimagined alternative sources that might create a similar sound.\nFor example, for the sound of someone slurping, alternative\nsources included shuﬄing a deck of cards, ﬂipping through pages\nof a book, and raising blinds.One limitation to the brainstorming session was the possibility\nof functional ﬁxation (Maier, 1931; Duncker and Lees, 1945)\non the part of the researchers, who had prior knowledge about\nthe true source of the sound. To overcome this, we conducted\na remote behavioral study that presented 16 naïve participants\nwith several 3-second-long audio clips of trigger sounds, such as\nthe sound of someone slurping or chewing something crunchy,\nand asked them to try to identify each sound. The sounds and\nquestionnaire were presented using an online survey platform,\nand participants documented what they thought the sound could\nbe in an open-ended text box. We examined incorrect guesses\nas potential candidates for alternative sources as they were\nreasonably mistaken for the source sound. For example, the\nsound of ﬁnger drumming was once misidentiﬁed as “a rubber\nball rapidly bouncing on the ﬂoor” and as “a plastic bottle rolling\non a desk.”\nStage 2: Video-Recording the Positive Attributable\nVideo Sources\nThe idea generation stage led to a collection of about 3–5 ideas\nof alternative sources for each of the ten trigger sound categories.\nTwo research assistants then began the process of constructing\neach pair of PAVS and OVS stimuli.\nThe ﬁrst step was to record a roughly 15-second audio-video\nclip of the Positive Attributable Video Source (PAVS). The reason\nthat the PAVS was recorded ﬁrst is that since most triggers are\nhuman-made orofacial sounds, it is relatively easy to generate\nthose sounds to match the rhythm of a pre-existing PAVS. In\ncontrast, we found it was more diﬃcult to generate a PAVS to\nmatch the rhythm of a pre-existing OVS. For instance, it was\neasier to produce chewing sounds in the rhythm of a person\nwalking on snow, compared to trying to walk in the rhythm of a\nperson chewing. Our process is similar to Foley Sound Design2,\nwhere sound designers will watch footage from a TV show or\nmovie and produce sound eﬀects post-production in sync with\nwhat is occurring visually. In this case, it is the reverse—we\nproduce videos that match up with an existing sound.\nPAVS were self-recorded by research assistants with the\nuse of a tripod and a smartphone with an auxiliary shotgun\nmicrophone that directly targets the sound of the action and\nreduces unwanted low gain background noise. Smartphones with\nsimilar video capabilities and resolution were used to capture\nthe action of both the PAVS and the OVS stimuli. Most PAVS\nstimuli involved an agent (for instance a person hammering a\nstake into the ground or walking on snow), while some PAVS\nstimuli involved agent-less environmental sources, such as water\nrunning down a creek.\nStage 3: Recording the Original Video Sources\nThe next step was to record the OVS stimulus, which always\ninvolved a human actor/agent. OVS videos were also self-\nrecorded by research assistants with the use of a tripod and a\nsmartphone with an auxiliary shotgun microphone. The goal of\nthe OVS recording was to create something roughly synchronized\nto the already recorded PAVS and capture the trigger sound\n2https://osf.io/3ysfh/\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 890829"

Therefore the OVS recording process involved the actor\nattempting to synchronize the trigger action (e.g., chewing) while\ncarefully watching and listening to the previously recorded PAVS\n(e.g., walking). To aid in this synchronization, the PAVS audio\nwas played through headphones while the video was displayed\nin Adobe Premiere, allowing the actor to use both visual and\nauditory cues to determine the rhythm of the to-be-produced\nOVS. Special consideration was given to recording the audio\nto match the cadence and dynamics to the video component\nof the PAVS. The camera was often focused on the orofacial\naction, which featured the lower half or full face of the human\nagent. After a successful attempt at creating an OVS, both\nvideos were evaluated to check for the viability of the temporal\nmatch. If the video pair was reasonably well synchronized,\nthe raw audio and video were cataloged for further editing.\nOtherwise, the OVS recording process continued until a good\nmatch was achieved.\nStage 4: Audio Editing and Normalization\nBefore the audio was edited, the OVS and PAVS videos were\nroughly matched on a timeline in Adobe Premiere. A 12-second\nclip was then selected representing the best matched section\nthat excludes loud noises associated with the beginning and\nending of the original recordings. The audio components of\nthe OVS and PAVS were then exported to Audition where the\nclips were normalized to \u00003 db. This step raised the volume of\nquiet parts and lowered the volume of louder parts of the audio\nwaveforms. In some circumstances, additional distracting noises\nwere removed from the waveform with dynamics processing\nto lower amplitudes of speciﬁc frequencies, for instance, a low\nfrequency air conditioning noise that added white noise to the\nvideo. This tool was used sparingly as it could end up removing\nfrequencies that are essential to the sound of the OVS.\nStage 5: Video Editing\nWith the audio now normalized, the corresponding video tracks\nwere edited in Adobe Premiere. Due to the prior audio editing\nand video recording process, the audio waveforms should already\nbe aligned and similar in amplitude, frequency, and height.\nThe two normalized audio and video pairs were then placed\non the timeline to ﬁnd the best ﬁt. The PAVS video was then\noverdubbed with the OVS sound. However, after an initial\nplayback, additional unwanted sounds may need to be edited\nout from the audio that aﬀect the believability of the audio-\nvideo match. The sounds that were generally removed were\nnot representative of the OVS triggers themselves. For instance,\ndistracting breathing sounds may be spliced out of a chewing\nsound since they might aﬀect how plausible the match will turn\nout with PAVS. Additionally, some sections of the OVS audio may\nbe slowed down (up to 85%) or sped up (up to 120%) to create a\nbetter match with the PAVS video.\nOnce these 5 stages were complete, we ended up with two\naudiovisual stimuli corresponding to a particular trigger sound:\nthe OVS with the original triggering audio and video, and the\nPAVS with a positive attributable video source dubbed with the\ntriggering OVS sound. In addition, we also cataloged the originalsound ﬁles as well as the PAVS with its original (non-trigger)\nsound for potential use in future work.\nStudy 2: Evaluation of 39 Positive\nAttributable Video Sources Stimuli\nStimuli\nThe stimuli for Study 2 were the 39 PAVS stimuli constructed as\ndescribed above. The stimuli contained non-trigger video sources\n(e.g., someone stepping on snow) paired with trigger sounds (e.g.,\nchewing). The 39 trigger sounds included several examples of the\nten categories described earlier.\nParticipants\nWe recruited 34 naïve participants (26 women, 6 men; ages 18–\n28) from the University of California Santa Cruz participant pool\nwho received course credit for their participation. Participants\ncompleted a questionnaire viaQualtrics where they watched each\nof the 39 12-second PAVS stimuli in a random order.\nProcedure\nAfter watching each video, participants provided ratings of how\npleasant or unpleasant the video clip was, and how well the sound\nand video matched. The pleasantness scale used the following\nresponse scale: 1 (Very unpleasant), 2 (Somewhat unpleasant),\n3 (Neither pleasant nor unpleasant), 4 (Somewhat pleasant), or\n5 (Very pleasant). The sound-video match question used the\nfollowing response scale: 1 (Not a good match), 2 (Slightly good\nmatch), 3 (Moderately good match), 4 (Very good match), or 5\n(Extremely good match).\nStudy 3: Evaluation of the Best 20\nPositive Attributable Video Sources and\n20 Original Video Sources Stimuli\nStimuli\nBased on the results of Study 2, we selected the best 20 PAVS\nstimuli based on the reported quality of the sound-video match,\nalong with the corresponding 20 OVS stimuli. The resulting\n40 stimuli were presented to a new group of observers in two\npossible pseudo-random orders. In both presentation orders, half\nof the trigger sounds appeared once in the ﬁrst half and once\nin the second half, paired with either a PAVS or an OVS video\nsource. The counterbalancing allowed us to collect ratings for\neach PAVS-OVS pair in two diﬀerent orders across participants.\nFor half of the participants, “odd” PAVS videos and “even” OVS\nvideos were played ﬁrst, and “even” PAVS videos and “odd” OVS\nvideos were played second. For the other half of the participants,\nit was the other way around. Having these two presentation\norders allowed us to analyze responses by order (i.e., by whether\nthe PAVS video was presented before or after the OVS video).\nParticipants\nWe recruited 102 naïve participants (65 women, 33 men, and 4\nnon-binary; ages 18–29) from the University of California, Santa\nCruz Psychology participant pool who received course credit\nfor their participation.

The primary diﬀerence here is that\nin Study 3 we asked about the pleasantness or unpleasantness\nof the sound itself, whereas in Study 2, we asked about the\npleasantness or unpleasantness of the PAVS video clip as a\nwhole. After viewing and rating all 40 stimuli, participants then\ncompleted the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ) and answered\nseveral demographic questions.\nRESULTS\nStudy 1\nWe produced 39 pairs of PAVS/OVS stimuli, resulting in 78\naudio-video ﬁles in total. Based on the results of Studies 2\nand 3, we release a subset of the best 18 PAVS and the\ncorresponding 18 OVS (in folders titled “PAVS videos” and “OVS\nvideos, ” respectively) as open-source downloads viaOSF (see\ntext footnote 2).\nStudy 2\nOverall, the 39 PAVS videos received mean ratings of 2.36 ( SD:\n0.96) on the 5-point sound-video match scale, and 2.67 ( SD: 0.60)on the pleasantness scale, although there were large diﬀerences\nacross the videos Each of the PAVS video’s mean ratings for\nsound-video match and pleasantness across 34 observers are\nshown in Figure 1 .\nOverall, participants provided a wide range of sound-video\nmatch ratings of the PAVS videos. Many stimuli ended up with\nratings of “slightly good” or below, making them unviable for\nfurther use. Many of these videos were excluded due to the video\nand audio being oﬀ sync or, more commonly, due to perceptual\ndiﬀerences between the sound quality (timbre) and the material\nfrom the visual source (e.g., a hollow bouncing sound could not\nreasonably originate from a ball lightly hitting a shag carpeted\nﬂoor). For Study 2, we selected the best 20 PAVS videos based on\nthe sound-video match rating, with a cutoﬀ value of 2.15 in the\n5-point sound-video match scale.\nStudy 3\nWe ﬁrst examined ratings of the audio-visual match of the\n20 PAVS and 20 OVS stimuli. Match ratings for the PAVS\nvideos closely mirrored the results from Study 2 restricted\nto the best 20 stimuli. The mean rating of sound-video\nmatch across the 20 PAVS stimuli was 2.66 ( SD: 0.91). As\nexpected, match ratings for PAVS videos were consistently\nlower than those for corresponding OVS videos (mean:\n4.15, SD: 0.65). Nevertheless a majority (15 of 20) of the\nPAVS stimuli obtained match ratings of slightly good or\nabove.

Separate analyses of\nPAVS and OVS ratings revealed that this relationship was driven\nby individuals with higher severity scores rating OVS as more\nunpleasant than individuals with lower severity scores; there was\nno diﬀerence between how these groups rated the PAVS-paired\nsounds.

Sound-Swapped Video Database for Misophonia\nthe modulating eﬀect of PAVS is substantial and works across\nparticipants regardless of their reported misophonia severity\nscores. In fact, individuals who reported higher severity scores\non the MQ rated the OVS-paired sounds as less pleasant than\nthose with lower severity scores, making the attenuation eﬀect\nstronger for these individuals. This suggests that future studies\ncould evaluate if the comparison between PAVS and OVS stimuli\nmay have a therapeutic eﬀect for misophonia suﬀerers if an\nextension of our previous work (Samermit et al., 2019) were to be\napplied to participants with misophonia. Those with more severe\nsymptoms may therefore stand to beneﬁt from a dedicated PAVS-\nbased intervention that trains them to associate triggering sounds\nto non-trigger visual sources. Future research on the short-\nand long-term eﬀects of sound-swapped videos on misophonic\ntrigger responses should be explored.\nFurther, we found an order eﬀect that suggests there is learning\ninvolved in the perception of misophonic trigger sounds, where\nthe pleasantness ratings for PAVS-paired sounds were lower if the\ncorresponding OVS videos were presented ﬁrst. This indicates it\nmay be harder to associate a trigger sound with a PAVS once the\nexact sound has already been heard in the original OVS context.\nThis result is in line with Kumar et al. (2021), where the visual or\nauditory cue may act as a medium for understanding the action\nthat resulted in the sound. If an individual with misophonia\nhears a sound and maps it onto the action of someone chewing\non chips, and then sees as PAVS attempting to remap it, that\nrepresentation may have already been learned and diﬃcult to\nremap. This suggests that for maximum eﬀectiveness, PAVS-\npaired sounds should be presented ﬁrst to establish a stronger\nassociation, prior to presenting the sound in the OVS context.\nHowever, we note that despite the order eﬀect, PAVS-paired\nsounds still were rated as more pleasant than OVS-paired sounds,\neven when the OVS-paired sounds were presented ﬁrst. We\nalso note that in a therapeutic context, PAVS-paired sounds\nwould be presented repeatedly under diﬀerent circumstances\nand in diﬀerent contexts, over an extended period of time. It\nremains an empirical question whether this intervention will\nsigniﬁcantly reduce the severity of misophonia symptoms or\nassociated functional impairment.\nAnother line of work aims to understand intersections\nbetween misophonia and other psychiatric disorders or\nsyndromes. Clinical researchers have found that those with\nmisophonia report comorbidities with other psychiatric\ndisorders such as obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,\nmood disorders, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder\n(Jager et al., 2020), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a\nnovel audio-visual phenomena called the autonomous sensory\nmeridian response, or ASMR (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018).\nEven with these comorbidities, it is unlikely misophonia\ncan be fully explained by an underlying psychological disorder\n(Schröder et al., 2013; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018). However,\nthe emotional regulation and dysregulation associated with\npsychiatric disorders have been found to mediate trigger\nresponses (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020). Speciﬁcally,\nmisophonia has been found to be associated with anxiety,\ndepression, and personality disorder symptoms, with anxiety\nas a mediator between personality disorder symptoms andmisophonia (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2021). As such, diﬀerent\nforms of cognitive behavioral therapy, including transdiagnostic\nand counterconditioning approaches (Schröder et al., 2017;\nLewin et al., 2021), and inhibitory learning approaches (Frank\nand McKay, 2019) that address emotional responses and\ncontextual factors around a trigger stimulus-response pairing\nhave shown some promising results. As the ﬁeld continues\nto learn more about misophonia, it is possible that these\nclinical approaches may be complemented by the cross-sensory\nremapping approach we introduced here.\nExisting research has already begun exploring how stimuli\nmanipulation can be used in cognitive behavioral therapy\n(CBT) to alleviate misophonic trigger reactions. Schröder\net al. (2017) conducted group CBT sessions with four main\ntherapeutic exercises, including stimuli manipulation and\ncounterconditioning where participants manipulated aspects of\ntheir own trigger sounds such as the pitch, duration of sound,\nand associations with visual stimuli. As part of this exercise,\nparticipants combined trigger sounds with pleasant stimuli,\nand were tasked with decreasing avoidant coping strategies\nwhen listening and watching their own stimuli at home. The\nresearchers found that stimulus manipulation “helped to decrease\nthe uncontrollability over misophonic triggers” and that the\nstimulus-grounded practice resulted in participants “feeling less\noverwhelmed by misophonic sounds” (Schröder et al., 2017,\np. 292). We see our work as complementary to Schröder\net al. (2017)’s CBT practice, and believe the Sound-Swapped\nVideo Database provides researchers an opportunity to scale\na stimulus-grounded intervention for counterconditioning with\nlarger populations.\nOur ﬁndings should be considered in light of some limitations\nin our studies. First, we did not conﬁrm post hoc whether\nparticipants knew or suspected that they had listened to the\nsame sounds twice. As such, we were unable to conﬁrm\nwhether the order eﬀect we identiﬁed was driven by this\nconscious knowledge or association. Additionally, the study\nwas conducted remotely and we did not include any tasks to\nstandardize the volume of diﬀerent sounds across participants.\nThus we do not know how soft or loud participants set\ntheir volume to, whether they changed the volume over\nthe course of the study, or whether they were listening\nwith headphones or on a device’s speaker. As such, future\nremote studies should consider using a volume check task or\nrequest for participants to report their device setup to account\nfor potential variability in sound delivery. Replicating these\nexperiments in the lab under controlled auditory presentation\nconditions would be important for future research. Finally,\nby asking participants to attend to the goodness of the\nmatch between the sound and video of each clip, we may\nhave caused an ironic eﬀect where mismatches between the\naudio and video were made more salient, potentially reducing\nbeneﬁts of PAVS.\nWe also presented participants with decontextualized\nexamples of trigger stimuli: 12 s videos with an unknown\nactor. Our 12-second clips were produced to be long enough\nto provide stimuli for researchers conducting psychological or\nneuroimaging research (e.g., fMRI) on misophonia, but may\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 10 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 890829"

Future\nstimuli development may also consider developing longer videos,\nincluding ones in more naturalistic contexts.\nExisting research suggests that misophonic trigger responses\nare susceptible to contextual factors, such as the meaning tied\nto the sound, social control, or social relationships (Schröder\net al., 2013; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018). Our stimuli lacked\nsocial contexts and, more speciﬁcally, any necessary or imposed\ninteractions between the participant and the producer of the\nsound. By stripping the clips of these higher-level contexts, we\nare unable to make claims on the generalizability of these results\nto other examples or situations. Future research may beneﬁt from\nexploring the role of social context and controllability as a factor\nthat may potentially interact with PAVS-based attenuation of\nmisophonic responses.\nThe evaluation of our stimuli in Studies 1 and 2 was\nbased on a neurotypical population, and we did not screen\nfor participants with misophonia. Even though we observed a\nrange of misophonia sensitivity and severity scores using the\nMisophonia Questionnaire (Wu et al., 2014) within our sample,\nwe did not include enough participants with high sensitivity or\nseverity scores to examine the robustness of these eﬀects for these\nindividuals. However, 14 of the participants had a severity score\nof 7 or higher, qualifying them as having clinically signiﬁcant\nmisophonic reactions. This lends credibility to the potential\neﬃcacy of our PAVS as it relates to misophonia: The mean\ndiﬀerence for these participants was driven by a lower baseline for\ntheir OVS scores, rather than an increase in pleasantness from the\nPAVS. In ongoing work, we are examining how individuals with\nmisophonia from the 80 interviews conducted in Study 1 respond\nto sounds presented in the context of OVS and PAVS. This\nongoing work, we hope, will help us identify whether cross-modal\nremapping of misophonic trigger sounds to plausible, positive\nalternative video sources might be a viable therapeutic method.\nCONCLUSION\nWe hope that by releasing our initial set of OVS and PAVS\nstimuli, along with aggregate ratings and video production\nmethodology, a collaborative eﬀort across multiple research\ngroups can contribute to and reﬁne the database. It is our hope\nthat our work can inspire and encourage broader brainstorming\non plausible alternative sources of trigger sounds. Experiencedsound and video editors should be able to produce even better\nmatched videos and produce more examples of each trigger\nsound and PAVS source.
