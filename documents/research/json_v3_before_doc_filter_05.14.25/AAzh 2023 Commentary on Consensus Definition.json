  "abstract": "There are different types of sound intolerance ranging from misophonia and hyperacusis to noise sensitivity. This commentary discusses the consensus definition of misophonia developed by Swedo et al. (2022) using a modified Delphi method. The commentary evaluates the methodology and outcomes, outlining benefits such as achieving a foundational consensus and limitations including literature search constraints, committee representativeness, and the nature of consensus itself. The definition characterizes misophonia by decreased tolerance to specific sounds producing disproportionate emotional, physiological, and behavioral reactions leading to distress and functional impairments. The paper also discusses the controversies about whether misophonia should be classified as a disorder or a natural human variation, and the importance of distinguishing misophonia from hyperacusis and noise sensitivity. It calls for future research to further clarify definitions and underlying mechanisms.",

The focus of this paper is on misophonia. There are conﬂicting\nresults about the prevalence of misophonia ranging from 5 to 49.1% ( Wu et al., 2014 ;\nSiepsiak et al., 2020 ;Naylor et al., 2021 ;Jakubovski et al., 2022 ). There are also debates\naboutthemechanismofmisophoniainﬁeldsofpsychiatry,neurology,andneuroscience\n(Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2003 ;Cavanna and Seri, 2015 ;Erfanian et al., 2019 ). For\nexample, some researchers classify misophonia as a psychiatric illness ( Schroder et al.,\n2013) and others as a neurodevelopmental disorder ( Cavanna and Seri, 2015 ). In the\nﬁeld of audiology, misophonia is often considered as a subtype of hyperacusis rather\nthan a distinct disorder ( Tyler et al., 2014 ). Therefore, most research studies in the ﬁeld\nof audiology have not distinguished misophonia from hyperacusis ( Fackrell et al., 2015 ;\nSheldrake et al., 2015 ;Zaugg et al., 2016 ;Aazh et al., 2017 ).Tyler et al. (2014) described\nfourcategoriesofhyperacusiscomprising(1)loudnesshyperacusis,(2)fearhype racusis,\n(3)painhyperacusis,and(4)annoyancehyperacusiswhichoverlapswithmisophonia.\nRecently, the Milken Institute Center for Strategic Philanthropy through a gra nt\nfrom The REAM Foundation’s Misophonia Research Fund, assembled a group\nof scientiﬁc researchers and clinicians with expertise in misophonia and related\ntopics in order to develop a consensus deﬁnition for misophonia ( Swedo et al.,\n2022). To raise awareness about this consensus deﬁnition among audiologists and\nto promote its future reﬁnements, the REAM Foundation and Milken Institute’s\nCenter for Strategic Philanthropy have commissioned this commentary. The aim\nof this commentary is to independently review the methodology and outcome\nof the paper by Swedo et al. (2022).

Each section starts by discussing the beneﬁts of the\nconsensus followed by reviewing its limitations and oﬀering\ndirectionsforfuturework.\nDiscourse on the method\nSwedo et al. (2022) used a modiﬁed Delphi method to\ndeveloptheconsensus.Thismethodhasbeenusedinhealthcare\nfor ﬁve decades ( Gustafson et al., 1973 ). The main aim is to\ngatherexperts’opinionsinasystematicmannerintheabsenceof\nresearch evidence and/or widely agreed theoretical frameworks\non a particular topic. Using the Delphi method, Swedo et al.\n(2022) structured the communication process among a group\nof experts and facilitated achieving a consensus deﬁnition for\nmisophonia.However,becausetheconsensushasbeenachieved\nitdoesn’tmeanthattherightdeﬁnitionformisophoniahasbeen\nproduced. Therefore, it is important to discuss strengths and\nweaknesses of the methods used as well as analyze the outcome\ninordertogivedirectionstofutureworkonthistopic.\nBeneﬁts\nThisistheﬁrstsystematicprojectthatachievedaconsensus\non a foundational deﬁnition for misophonia. As the study was\nmainly an internet-based inquiry, it is consistent with e-Delphi\nmethod ( Donohoe et al., 2012 ). Use of e-Delphi methodology\nprovided the researchers with several beneﬁts comprising: (1)\naccess to a wide range of experts from diﬀerent locations,\n(2) cost-eﬀectiveness, (3) good response and retention rates,\nand (4) oﬀering equal opportunity to the committee members\nto express their opinions ( Gordon and Pease, 2006 ). This e-\nDelphiinvolvedasystematicreviewoftheliteratureandseveral\nrounds of discussion and independent voting ( viainternet)\nby a committee of 15 invited experts and facilitated by the\nstaﬀ at Milken Institute. The committee included clinicians\nandresearchersfromdiﬀerentdisciplinescomprisingaudiology,\nneuroscience, psychology, neuropsychology, and psychiatry.\nBased on the review of literature the facilitators created a list of\npossibledeﬁnitionsformisophoniaanditsdomainswhichwent\nthrough the process of discussion and voting. “Consensus” was\nconsideredas80%agreementofallcommitteememberspresent\nwhen a given vote was conducted. The voting was anonymous\nwhichenabledthecommitteememberstoendorsethedeﬁnition\nthat they approved without problems associated with face-to-\nface disagreements. Using this systematic process by Swedo\net al.(2022) was beneﬁcial because it allowed for a group of\nexperts with diverse professional background to examine the\nempirical studies on misophonia, discuss their agreements and\ndisagreements and to achieve a consensus. They included input\nof all committee members which minimized some of the biases\narisingfromunbalancedinputofafewparticipants.Limitations\nLiterature search\nThe search strategy did not identify some of the studies\non relevant topics (e.g., hyperacusis, noise sensitivity/noise\nannoyance, sensory processing disorders and autism spectrum\ndisorder) in which some of the characteristics of misophonia\nin contexts of audiology, psychoacoustics, developmental\npsychology and environmental noise and health have been\ndiscussed ( Bregman and Pearson, 1972 ;Guski et al., 1999 ;\nAazh and Moore, 2017 ,2018;Aazh et al., 2018 ;Danesh\net al., 2021 ;Enzler et al., 2021 ). Reviewing such studies can\nimprove our knowledge about possible underlying mechanisms\nof misophonia. Consistent with this, Brout(2022) challenged\ntheoverallliteraturereviewstrategyintheconsensuspaperand\nhighlighted its limitation as being too focused on observable\nbehaviorsandleavingoutpostulatedmechanisms.Shesuggested\nthat principles of Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) ( Sanislow\net al., 2010 ) should be used. RDoC promotes research that\nfocuses on investigating the biological, physiological, and\nbehavioralelementsthatcompriseanillnessratherthanfocusing\non symptom-based diagnosis ( Sanislow et al., 2010 ). It is worth\nmentioningthatthemembersoftheconsensuscommitteewere\npioneers in misophonia research and have conducted many\nresearch studies consistent with RDoC principles. However,\ntheir conclusion was that as the underlying mechanism of\nmisophonia is not fully understood, the inclusion of postulated\nmechanismstothedeﬁnitionwasnotjustiﬁed.\nCommittee members bias\nOnerecognizedlimitationinDelphimethodisitrelianceon\nthe opinion of experts on a topic. The individual experts can be\nsensitive about the topic, have conﬂicting theoretical positions,\nor be inﬂuenced by various professional or political agendas.\nTherefore, the data collected from experts may knowingly or\nunknowinglybebiased( TuroﬀandLinstone,2002 ).\nRepresentativeness of the committee\nThe committee did not include non-professionals\nor individuals who themselves suﬀer from misophonia.\nInvolvement of individuals with misophonia could challenge\nsome of the concepts agreed by the professionals within the\nDelphi process and minimize the so called inbreeding of the\nviewpoints( Linstone,2002 ).\nAnonymity\nThe discussion round was not anonymous, and\nthe committee members took part in a meeting via\nvideo for exchange of ideas. This can produce some\nlimitations as the less conﬁdent members may be\nFrontiersin Neuroscience /zero.tnum/two.tnum frontiersin.org"

In other words,\nconﬁdence, deference, and shyness could have inﬂuenced\nsome of the conclusions drawn ( McKenna, 1994 ). This\ncan damage the integrity of the data ( Chou, 2002 ).\nHowever, Swedo et al. (2022)’s study had 4 rounds of\nanonymous voting which is likely to have provided the\ncommittee members with plenty of opportunity to express\ntheirviews.\nAccountability\nAlthough anonymity is an important principle in Delphi\nmethod, it can impact on accountability ( McKenna, 1994 ). In\nthe misophonia study, the rounds of voting were completely\nanonymous.Therefore,anindividualcommitteemembercould\nhave provided unjustiﬁed answers as their response will never\nbeattributedtothem.Accountabilitycanbeimprovedbyasking\nfollow-upquestionsinordertogetclariﬁcationandjustiﬁcation\nonwhyaparticularanswerwasgiveninakeyroundofvotes.\nDiscourse on the results\nBeneﬁts\nThe e-Delphi study achieved consensus on describing\nmisophonia and factors related to it. The work conducted by\nSwedo et al. (2022) is beneﬁcial to healthcare professionals as\nit confers validity and speciﬁcity to misophonia. The result\nfrom the e-Delphi study (summarized in Table1) is beneﬁcial\nto patients too because it helps to understand their uniqueexperienceofmisophonia,appreciatethenatureoftheproblem\nthat aﬀects them and the relational eﬀects on families and\ncommunities. Swedo et al. (2022)’s work takes us closer to the\ntruth which subsequently can facilitate future treatments and\nsupportforthispopulation.\nAs shown in Table1, the consensus produced one general\ndescription for misophonia and ﬁve domains comprising: (1)\nmisophonic triggers, (2) reactions to misophonic triggers, (3)\ninﬂuences on reaction, (4) functional impairments, and (5)\nrelationshiptootherconditions/disorders.\nThe general description of misophonia emphasizes that\nthe main characteristic of misophonia is decreased tolerance\nto speciﬁc sounds leading to disproportionate reactions. The\nconsensus covers a wide range of common misophonic triggers\nand the suﬀerer’s reaction to them. They also elaborate that\nthe individual’s reaction is not always disproportionate, and it\ndepends on the context and the source of the trigger. Swedo\net al.(2022) described that misophonia can limit individuals’\nactivities, restrict their participation in social and familial life,\nandimpactontheirpsychologicalwellbeing.Finally,theyagreed\nthat other comorbid disorders with misophonia need to be\ninvestigatedandtreatedwhenneeded.\nLimitations and future directions\nMisophonia: A “disorder” or a less common\npresentation of natural human variation?\nSwedo et al.

As the underlying\nmechanism of misophonia is not fully understood, classifying it\nas a disorder at this stage may be premature. Moreover, Naylor\net al.(2021) conducted an online survey completed by medical\nstudents at University of Nottingham in the UK. They found\nthat 49.1% of 336 respondents had misophonia as measured\nby the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S) ( Schroder\net al., 2013 ). Although this high prevalence may be as the result\nof their survey method or characteristics of their participants,\nit would be unreasonable to suggest that about 50% of this\nsample had a “disorder.” It is possible that misophonia has\na spectrum and on the extreme end it can be a debilitating\ndisorder and on the other end it may represent a less common\npresentation of natural human variation. This is consistent\nwith the concept of neurodiversity ( Blume, 1998 ). According to\nneurodiversity principles, classifying misophonia as a disorder\ncan be stigmatizing and results in a focus on dysfunctions\nand impairments as opposed to focusing on understanding\nthe diﬀerences between people ( Kapp et al., 2013 ). Instead,\nmisophonia can be described as an “experience”. This shifts the\nbalancefromconsideringitasa“disorder”thatisdysfunctional\nand should be cured to promoting accommodation/adjustment\nin work place, school, and other public places in order to\nimprove quality of life for people who experience misophonia\n(Porcaro et al., 2019 ). To sum up, more research is needed\nto explore misophonia phenomenon and to understand if it is\nindeed a disorder. In the meantime, clinicians can beneﬁt from\nthe consensus deﬁnition ( Table1) as a guide that highlights\nfactors that they need to explore with their patients in order\nto fully understand their experience of misophonia and to\nappreciate the nature of the problems faced by them, its\nrelationaleﬀectontheirfamiliesandtoformulateindividualized\ntreatmentplanandcare.\nDistinguishing misophonia from hyperacusis\nand noise sensitivity\nIt can be important to diﬀerentiate misophonia from\nother types of sound intolerance (e.g., hyperacusis and noise\nsensitivity/noise annoyance). Hyperacusis is deﬁned as an\nintolerance of certain everyday sounds, which are perceived\nas too loud or uncomfortable and which cause signiﬁcant\ndistressandimpairmentintheindividual’sday-to-dayactivities\n(Aazh et al., 2022b ). For an individual with hyperacusis,\ncertain everyday sounds, such as kitchen noises, bangs, music,\nslamming doors, water running, cutlery on plates, traﬃc noise,hair dryers, and hand dryers, are perceived as too loud,\nuncomfortable,orpainful.Noisesensitivityisapersonalitytrait\nabout attitudes toward noise in general ( Baliatsas et al., 2016 ).\nA person with high noise sensitivity may perceive noise caused\nby neighbors, nearby factories, workshops, farms, radiators,\nair conditioning, and background music as disruptive and\ndistressing( Weinstein,1978 ).Futuredeﬁnitionsformisophonia\nmay include statements excluding the possibility of hyperacusis\nand/or noise sensitivity. For example, to exclude hyperacusis,\nthis statement can be used: “The person’s primary reaction to\nsounds is not aural pain or physical discomfort in their ears\ndue to excessive loudness of the sounds.” To exclude noise\nsensitivity, this statement can be used: “The person’s sound\nintolerance is not better explained by their general attitude\ntoward noise and environmental noise pollution (e.g., noise\nfrom neighbors, nearby airports, traﬃc, workshops, internal\nplumbing, or air conditioning).” These are just examples\nand adoption of such statements needs to be supported by\nempiricalevidence.\nHow to establish if symptoms of misophonia\nare better explained by any co-occurring\ndisorders?\nAccording to the consensus deﬁnition, misophonia\nis present if its symptoms are not better explained by\nsomething else. In other words, an individual who exhibits\na disproportionate emotional, physiological, or behavioral\nreaction when exposed to misophonic triggers may not\nnecessarily have misophonia. Their symptoms may be better\nexplainedbyaco-occurringdisorder.Inthissection,thefocusis\nto discuss how symptoms of co-occurring disorders (excluding\nhyperacusis and noise sensitivity which have already been\ndiscussed in the previous section) can be misinterpreted as\nmisophonia. To make this matter clearer several examples are\ngiven here: (1) Schroder et al. (2013) explained that although\nan individual might feel distressed when exposed to certain\noral/nasaltriggers,theirreactionmayberelatedtotheirgeneral\nobsession about contamination and to an underlying anxiety\ndisorder, as opposed to misophonia. (2) Cavanna and Seri\n(2015) reported that in certain individuals, behavioral reactions\nto misophonic triggers such as mimicking or reproducing the\ntriggers can be related to an underlying tic disorder as opposed\nto misophonia. (3) In the Third International Conference\non Hyperacusis, Hashir Aazh discussed a case study of a\npatient whose main reason for feeling anxious and angry\nwhen exposed to the trigger sounds was her magical thinking\n(Dubal and Viaud-Delmon, 2008 ), visual hallucinations and an\nunderlying psychosis as opposed to misophonia or hyperacusis\n(Aazh et al., 2018 ). (4) Some individuals with tinnitus might\nexhibit adverse reaction to certain misophonic triggers,\nbecause they may be afraid that certain sounds can make\ntheir tinnitus worse ( Aazh et al., 2022a ).

(2022)forthemisophonia\ndeﬁnition was an established method in health and social\ncare to gather experts’ opinions and to achieve a consensus\nin the absence of complete empirical evidence or widely\nagreed theories. The combination of the reliable techniques\nand the systematic process utilized in this e-Delphi is likely\nto have minimized the risk for bias as much as it was\npossible. However, consensus is a viewpoint ( Vernon, 2009 ),\ntherefore it should not be misinterpreted as literal fact. To\nfurther improve representativeness of the committee, future\nstudies should involve patients with a variety of misophonia\nsymptoms and severity. It may be premature to consider\nmisophonia as a disorder given the lack of empirical evidence\nregarding any possible underlying pathology on one hand and\ndue to its seemingly high prevalence among the population\non the other.
