The \nfindings of Cusack et al. support the link \nbetween misophonia and OCD,24 with \nthe authors suggesting misophonia car -\nries more of the obsessive than compul -\nsive traits of OCD. When assessing three \nindividuals with misophonia, Natalini et \nal.25 found that levels of perfectionism \nwere elevated, consistent with an ob -\nsessive-compulsive personality disorder. \nIn the same vein, Jager et al.26 reported \nthat 26% of the a misophonic sample \npresented with obsessive-compulsive \npersonality traits, speculating that there \nis some connection between misophonia \nand obsessive-compulsive symptoms. \nNeurologically speaking, some research -\ners believe misophonia and OCD may \nshare related neurocircuitry, that is, im -\npairments in limbic structures such as \nthe amygdala and basal ganglia,10 where -\nas others believe the overlap between the \ntwo disorders is due to dysfunction of \nthe serotonergic and dopaminergic neu -\nral systems.27 Specifically, both OCD \nand misophonia exhibit hyperactivity in \nthe insula and amygdala when exposed \nto triggers.23 Hyperactivity in the ACC \nhas also been implicated in both OCD \nand misophonia, specifically in an error-processing task and trigger sound expo -\nsure, respectively.23\nAlthough the findings of these stud -\nies point out overlapping features, hall -\nmark traits of OCD, such as compul -\nsions and transdiagnostic factors, such \nas disgust sensitivity and intolerance \nof uncertainty (IU), have not been ob -\nserved to be significantly associated with \nmisophonia. Further, recent neuroimag -\ning studies confirm the unique profile of \nmisophonia, further supporting the dis -\ntinction between OCD and misophonia. \nActivation of the midcingulate cortex \n(MCC) and the supplementary motor \narea (SMA) differs between the disor -\nders. More specifically, the MCC, in -\nvolved in motor and cognitive control,28 \nhas been found to be hyperactive in the \npresence of triggers in misophonia, as \nmisophonic response to triggers is au -\ntonomically driven, which may translate \nto reactionary behaviors.29 Conversely, \nin OCD, hypoactivity in the MCC was \nobserved during symptom provocation, \nwhich some researchers speculate oc -\ncurs as a way to decrease anxiety.12 Dif-\nferences have also been observed in the \nSMA, which is associated with motor \ninitiation/planning and inhibitory con -\ntrol.30 While hyperactivation has been \nreported in misophonia upon subjection \nto triggers,29 hypoactivation has been \nfound in OCD during error-processing \ntasks.23 Therefore, while misophonia \nshares common psychological and neu -\nrological traits with OCD, there are \nsubstantial differences that warrant the \ndistinction between the two.\nDisgust sensitivity has been reported \nin both OCD31,32 and misophonia.33,34 \nDefined as a negative emotion that leads \nto repulsion and/or behavior avoidance,35 \ndisgust has come to be understood in the \ncontext of three domains: (1) pathogen-\nbased disgust (aversion toward patho -\ngens/contaminants), (2) moral disgust \n(aversion toward moral offenses), and \n(3) sexual disgust (aversion toward in -\nappropriate sexual behaviors).36 While,"

Pathogen-based disgust has \nlong been studied in OPD;37,38 however, \nmoral disgust and sexual disgust have \nbeen understudied. In terms of miso -\nphonia, although disgust sensitivity was \nfound to be associated with emotional \nreactivity, no relation was found with \npathogen-based disgust.33 The domains \nof moral or sexual disgust may be asso -\nciated with misophonia due to the po -\ntential association with mental contami -\nnation. As such, the domains of disgust \nmay serve as a way to differentiate the \ntwo disorders.\nIntolerance of uncertainty may also \nserve as a way to distinguish misophonia \nfrom OCD. IU refers to the aversion to \nuncertain situations that are character -\nized by negative emotional, cognitive, \nand behavioral reactions.39 IU has been \nimplicated in various anxiety disorders \nsuch as social and general anxiety,40 as \nwell as mood disorders such as depres -\nsion.41 In the context of OCD, IU is \nconsidered the predictor of OC symp -\ntoms42 and influences symptom sever -\nity,43 making it an important factor to \nconsider when discussing OCD traits. \nIU has yet to be explored in misopho -\nnia, but we do not anticipate those with \nmisophonia to exhibit IU as strongly as \ndo individuals with OCD because, al -\nthough people with misophonia may ex -perience immediate distress in response \nto specific triggers, this distress would \nnot be marked by preemptive anxiety or \nworry, as experienced by individuals with \nOCD. Thus, aversion would occur upon \nrealizing the trigger, rather than antici -\npating one.\nSTUDY OBJECTIVE AND \nHYPOTHESES\nWith consideration of the findings \nmentioned, we aimed to determine \nwhich factors could help differentiate \nmisophonia from OCD. We hypoth -\nesized that IU and disgust sensitivity \n(pathogen, sexual, moral) would be dif -\nferentially associated with and predict \nOCD and misophonia symptoms.

Pathogen-based disgust is char -\nacterized by statements such as “Stand -\ning close to a person who has body odor.” \nSexual disgust is characterized by state -\nments such as “Bringing someone you \njust met back to your room to have sex.” Moral disgust is characterized by state -\nments such as “Forging someone’s signa -\nture on a legal document.” Participants \nwere asked to respond on a seven-point \nLikert scale ranging from 0 = not at all \ndisgusting to 6 = extremely disgusting. \nThe TDDS was found to have accept -\nable reliability.44 In the current study, \nthe Cronbach’s a for pathogen-based \ndisgust, sexual disgust, and moral disgust \nwere found to be 0.77, 0.80, and 0.86, \nrespectively.\nIntolerance of Uncertainty Scale.

The \nNew York Misophonia Scale (NYMS) \nis composed of two parts—the first as -\nsessing emotional distress to misophonic \ntriggers, and the second assessing aggres -\nsive and nonaggressive responses to trig -\ngers.33 The first part consists of 25 miso -\nphonic triggers (eg, chewing loudly), and \nparticipants are asked to indicate how \naversive each trigger is using a five-point \nLikert scale ranging from 0 = doesn’t \nbother me to 4 = disgusting. The second \npart consists of 13 behavior-based reac -\ntions (eg, I cover my ears).

The odds ratios of the predictors \nare displayed in Table 4.  \nDISCUSSION\nConsistent with our hypotheses, IU \nand moral disgust scores were able to pre -\ndict OCD and misophonia, respectively. \nOur findings support the distinction \nbetween these disorders while lending \ncredence to existing neuroscientific lit -\nerature underpinning the processes that \ncharacterize IU and moral disgust. IU, \ninitially thought to be a defining feature \nof generalized anxiety disorder,49 has \nsince been found to play a role in various \nanxiety disorders, including OCD40,50,51 \nand posttraumatic stress disorder.52,53 Of \nthe studies examining the neural corre -\nlates of IU, there seems to be a pattern \nin brain area involvement, with literature \nimplicating the insula, amygdala, OFC, \nACC, vmPFC, and DLPFC in IU. In -\nterestingly, significant overlap exists \nbetween the areas implicated in IU and \nin OCD, providing a neurological back -\ning to the existing body of psychologi -\ncal literature supporting the relationship \nbetween IU and OCD. Further, IU has \nbeen found to positively correlate with striatal volume, particularly in the puta -\nmen,54 as found in OCD,55 suggesting \nthere is a link on not only a functional \nlevel but a structural level as well. IU has \nbeen especially noted in compulsions or \nritualistic behavior,50,51,56 as heightened \nconnectivity of the vmPFC and DLPFC \nresults in impaired safety signaling, thus \nexacerbating compensatory behaviors. If \na person fears they forgot to lock their \nfront door before going to sleep, they \nmay repeatedly check to make sure the \ndoor is locked. Thus, they respond to their fear of the uncertain (ie, whether \nthe door is locked) by carrying out a \ncompulsion, in this case the repeated \nchecking of the lock, in an attempt to \nmitigate the anxiety and promote feel -\nings of safety.

As mentioned, we believed \npeople with misophonia would not ex -\nperience distress prior to encountering \ntheir triggers. This belief was supported \nby neuroimaging studies showing ACC \nactivation only in the presence of trig -\ngers. Because the ACC deals with an -\nticipating aversive events,58,59 ACC ac -\ntivation exclusively in the presence of \nspecific misophonic triggers23 is not at \nall consistent with OCD, as there is no \nanticipation of the triggers or hyperac -\ntive resting state, as found in OCD.60\nDisgust sensitivity is another fac -\ntor that emerged as significant when \nattempting to distinguish the two dis -\norders. The three domains of disgust \nare extremely understudied in neuro -\nscientific literature, and thus, literature \nsurrounding the distinct neural regions \neach domain activates is scarce. How -\never, the research that does exist sug -\ngests that pathogen disgust and moral \ndisgust have distinct neural activation. \nIn a study conducted by Schaich Borg \net al., when processing pathogen-based \ndisgust stimuli, the main areas of activa -\ntion included the left amygdala and the \nventral orbito-frontal cortex.61 Because \nboth areas have been thought of as cen -\ntral players in OCD pathophysiology, \nthe neural correlates of disgust line up \nwith those found in OCD. Additionally, \nas contamination OCD is one of the \nmore prevalent OCD subtypes, it is rea -\nsonable that pathogen disgust emerged \nas significant, since the fear/avoidance of \npathogens defines the subtype.62,63 An-\nother explanation for OCD response to \npathogen disgust may be derived from \nthe concept of overestimation of threat, \nwhich is a key cognitive process in OCD \nin which individuals with OCD overes -\ntimate the potential for danger.64,65 As a \nresult, when these individuals are faced \nwith situations such as stepping in dog \nfeces, they may believe they have some -\nhow exposed themselves to contamina -\ntion, thus cycling into compulsions to offset the anxiety associated with the \ncontamination-based obsession. People \nwith misophonia do not exhibit the same \noverestimation of threat tendencies or \nworry-oriented mindsets that individu -\nals with OCD do, perhaps explaining \nwhy pathogen disgust did not emerge \nas a significant predictor of misophonia. \nThat is, misophonic triggers do not cen -\nter around the potential danger posed to \nthe individual but rather around the an -\nger felt toward the perpetrator of the ac -\ntion, as anger is a defining characteristic \nof misophonia.66\nWhen disgust stimuli of moral con -\ntent were processed, significant areas of \nactivation included the medial prefrontal \ncortex and the areas around the tempo -\nro-partial junction, which are regions \ninvolved in the processing of moral \nstimuli61,67,68 and in the pathophysiology \nof misophonia.69 While there has not \nbeen a proposed neurological link be -\ntween moral disgust and misophonia, we \nspeculate that the feeling of disgust in \nthose with misophonia may stem from \nanger, rather than worry, as observed in \nOCD. Participants in Edelstein et al.’s \nstudy reported that their triggers did not \nmake them feel anxious; however, they \ndid report they felt offended by trigger -\ning sounds, which would give rise to sen -\ntiments such as “I hate this person.”16 In \nthis way, it is probable that moral disgust \nemerged as significant since misophonic \nresponses to triggers include negative \nfeelings toward the source of the trigger, \nrather than toward the trigger itself.\nAlthough moral disgust has been ob -\nserved to play a role in OCD (mental \ncontamination),70 we speculate it is not \nas significant a predictor as pathogen \ndisgust since morality in OCD generally \nrelates to the experience of the individ -\nual, rather than the judgment of others, \nwhere the individual often casts doubt \non their own morality instead of passing \njudgment on the actions of others—an \nimportant defining characteristic be -\ntween OCD and misophonia. It may also be that morality underscores the \npathogen-based and sexual domains in \nmisophonia as well, since the nature of \nthe triggers may fall under a pathogenic \nor sexual label; however, the overall reac -\ntion has less to do with the stimuli and \nmore to do with the perceived morality \nof the source of the trigger.\nCONCLUSION AND \nRECOMMENDATIONS\nThe findings of the current study call \nattention to several issues. First, the data \ncollected from participants was self-re -\nported. Although screening was imple -\nmented to reach the target demographic, \nself-report measures are not sufficient to \nconclude the distinction between these \ndisorders. The sample of this study was \nsmall, meaning more participants are \nneeded to confirm the relationship be -\ntween IU, disgust sensitivity, OCD, and \nmisophonia. Additionally, studies of the \nthree domains of disgust and misopho -\nnia are few, especially in the field of neu -\nroscience, suggesting a need for more \nresearch on the subjects.\nFuture research may attempt to fur -\nther describe the relationship between \nOCD and misophonia, so the classifi -\ncation of misophonia may be solidified. \nIt is also worth noting that use of the \nTDDS limited our scope of pathogen, \nmoral, and sexual disgust. Specifically, \nthe statements describing moral disgust \nwere limited to the immorality of others, \nleaving us unable to explore the possi -\nbility of mental contamination in OCD. \nAs such, a different direction to explore \nmay examining OCD in the context \nof self-morality and misophonia in the \ncontext of the morality of others.\nThe neuroscience themes described \nin this article inform treatment planning \nfor patients with OCD. The study results \nsupport recent literature71,72 detailing \ntreatment possibilities for OCD that \nstray away from the conventional drug \nand behavioral treatment routes and \nmove in the direction of translating ad -"
