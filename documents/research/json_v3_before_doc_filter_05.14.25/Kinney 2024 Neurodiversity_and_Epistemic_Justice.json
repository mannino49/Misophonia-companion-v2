      "text": "1 \nCHAPTER I: OVERVIEW \nIntroduction: Neurodiversity and Epistemic Ambiguity \nThe neurodiversity concept was originated by Judith Singer (2017) in 1997 to \nspeculate that a natural neurological diversity among humans might maintain a rich and \nhealthy social ecosystem in an analogous way to the role of biodiversity in maintaining \noptimal planetary health (Blume, 1999; Doyle, 2020). The construct has been used to \npush back on the “abnormal psychology” perspective on diagnoses such as autism \nspectrum disorder (ASD) or attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as outlined \nby the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM 5-TR), seeing them not as diseases to be \ncured, but as emergent neurological proﬁles with valid ways of being and knowing in the \nworld to be valued, included and respected (Armstrong, 2010; Doyle, 2020; Priscott & \nAllen, 2021; J. Singer, 2017). There are a variety of perspectives on the relationship of \nthese diagnoses to the neurodiversity concept: some characterize neurodiversity as part \nof the normal distribution of human traits that can lead to unique proﬁles of struggle \neither in the extreme or under duress (Oller, 2019); others emphasize the mental health \nchallenges of neurodiversity as coexisting among underexplored strengths and \ncontributions (Armstrong, 2010); still others emphasize the more heightened proﬁle of \ntrade-oﬀs between cognitive strengths and vulnerabilities as forms of cognitive \nspecialization (Doyle, 2020). Currently the term is epistemically ambiguous, \npredominantly deﬁned by a resistance to the traditional medical framing of mental \nhealth psychopathology. ASD and ADHD are frequently centered in such conversations, \nbut the list can range from learning disorders such as dyslexia or dyspraxia, to mental"

Each conception shares a \nresistance to the deﬁcit-based understanding of neurodiverse people as problems to be \nsolved, and there is typically broad agreement that the problem is not reductive to \nindividuals, but the absence of an accommodating society (i.e., the social model of \ndisability; Armstrong, 2010; Chapman & Carel, 2021; Meadows, 2020; J. Singer, 2017; \n2021). \nHowever, while the individual frame is often etiologically resisted among \nneurodiversity advocates, few express skepticism that it is the best way to understand \nneurodiversity, with little discussion given to exploring what neurodiversity is outside of \nits association with pathological diagnoses, and a seeming widespread assumption that \nthey are in fact one in the same even among advocates. For instance, autism, or \nautistics, are assumed to be the meaningful unit of understanding that “corner” of \nneurodiversity, and not some underlying diﬀerences of sub-clinical temperament, \npersonality or neurological traits that are widely distributed and functional, of which \nautism or autistics would only be considered within as an emergent clinical \nmanifestation of a deeper, normative logic. In fact, this framing is exactly what may \ncharacterize the conceptual topography of neurodiversity (Del Giudice, 2018; Oller, \n2019). Some actively resist further eﬀorts at scientiﬁc understanding for fear it would \nserve to reify social hierarchies and social Darwinist assumptions of intrinsic inequities \n(Chapman, 2021b; 2021c; Stenning & Rosqvist, 2021).

In other words, as \nChapman and Carel (2021) pointed out, it is not the autism that causes pain or suﬀering, \nbut how people think of autism that shapes a marginalizing, silencing and high-barrier \nenvironment for autistics; as well as how this “overproliferation of neurotypical \nsignposts” (p. 14) inﬂuence how autistics think of themselves. This position considers the \nlack of well-framed information as preventing neuromajorities from understanding how \nthey should relate to, and position themselves, regarding the neurominorities. It also \nconsiders how neurominorities should position themselves psychosocially in \nepistemically “hostile” environments, as both dimensions lead to disempowering social \ndynamics among the neurodiverse that might help provide the context for why \nneurodiversity might be associated with widespread mental health problems. \nEpistemic Injustice \nMiranda Fricker (2007) introduced the term epistemic injustice to address a \nunique form of disempowerment to epistemic agents in their capacity as “knower” [of \nthe world] and [as someone who is] “known.” That is, marginalized communities may \nface two kinds of injustice. Testimonial injustice is where certain identities are silenced \nby working from a credibility deﬁcit that makes their knowledge, motives and authority \nsuspect. Hermeneutical injustice is where the ability to be known and understood is \nconstrained by the lack of hermeneutic (interpretive) understanding of a minoritized \nexperience both by the minoritized group and the majority. The latter form of injustice \nworks in part by creating a lack of resistance to oppression because words to describe"

With regard to hysteria, \nwhich was thought to be synonymous with female sexuality while being treated like a \ndisease (Maines, 2001), feminist scholars now consider the condition to be both a \nreaction to, and reﬂection of, the oppressive social roles and station of women in the \nnineteenth century (Devereux, 2014; Gilman et al., 1993). In each example, the \nmarginalized community is actively misunderstood and silenced by the pathological \nlabel: there is an inability by the marginalized group to shape the language to be true to \ntheir own experience (hermeneutical injustice) which leaves members unable to justify \ntheir suﬀering and distress to themselves and others; the imposition of a pathological \nunderstanding of this distress by the majority community is met without resistance by \nthose who cannot articulate it to themselves, and the testimony of the marginalized \ngroup is discredited as impaired and suspect (testimonial injustice). Both hermeneutical \nand testimonial injustice can work together to perpetuate the dynamic, particularly as \nimposed knowledge is inherited by a disempowered minority as truthful and comes to \nreinforce the marginalized groups’ own questionable credibility and low station to \nthemselves. Elsewhere, this dynamic has been called internalized oppression, a key \nfactor in what makes oppressive systems work, which is inclusive of a variety of"

Thus, Fricker (2007) characterized multiple barriers in \nthe dynamic of epistemic justice that a marginalized person or group must face to rise \nabove its self-reinforcing nature: a) the inability to shape language in hermeneutical \ninjustice creates a systematic barrier to self-understanding and self-knowledge by the \nminority community, and b) self-knowledge cannot spread when all members of the \nmarginalized group suﬀer from poor testimonial credibility. When we add the dynamic \nof internalized oppression - that a dominant group can impose negative beliefs about a \nminoritized group that are adopted, internalized and accepted by the marginalized \ngroup (Rosenwasser, 2002) - then overcoming these dynamics involves at least three \noverwhelming eﬀorts: recognizing the dynamic, ﬁghting for others in the minority to \nhear and believe narratives of mistreatment, and then persisting until both the minority \nand majority to reevaluate their mutually-reinforcing beliefs despite strong investment \nin the existing social order. \nMental health ﬁelds may unwittingly have a history of policing such barriers \namong marginalized groups of class, gender, sexuality, race, and now, neurodiversity, \nhaving been noted by sociologists that medicalization inherently carries these social \ncontrol features, i.e. policing deviations from cultural norms (Conrad, 1992; Correia, \n2017). For instance, when social issues are reframed as individual problems, individuals \nbecome scapegoats for larger issues (David & Derthick, 2013; Ratts, 2009).

Said diﬀerently, people \ncan “stop making sense” within a cultural frame when the dominant social narrative \ncreates expectations that cannot be fulﬁlled by a particular subgroup, yet the reasons for \nfailing to meet those expectations are also unjustiﬁable from within the narrative; some \nalternative and more stigmatizing explanation is usually oﬀered instead - moral defects, \nsocial judgments, inferiority narratives, and so forth - which is internalized and accepted \nby all. \nScholars have found that the bioreductive assumptions of the medical model of \npsychopathology not only promotes such stigma among suﬀerers and neutral third \nparties (Lebowitz & Appelbaum, 2019; Rüsch et al., 2010a), it does so among mental \nhealth professionals as well (Larkings & Brown, 2018).

Mental pain is inherently diﬃcult to \narticulate, understand and causally-attribute, nor is it intuitively clear what a social \nthreat is or why they may prove unsustainable to mental well-being (Johnstone & Boyle, \n2018). A person or group that is discredited as a knower, or has no publicly-accessible \nnarrative with which to articulate their position, is vulnerable to disempowerment, \nmarginalization and helplessness as they can easily be targeted for their seemingly \nirrational behavior such as avoiding abstract social threats or idiosyncratic attempts to \ncope, which might creep across various roles, contexts and intersectional identities \n(Johnstone & Boyle, 2018; D.

Testimonial injustice is \nwhere certain identities are silenced by working from a credibility deﬁcit that makes \ntheir knowledge, motives and authority suspect. Hermeneutical injustice is where the \nability to be known and understood is constrained by the lack of hermeneutic \n(interpretive) understanding of a minoritized experience both by the minoritized group \nand the majority. The latter creates a lack of resistance to oppression because words to \ndescribe the injustice do not exist and when they come into existence, they are not \nshared reference points by those in the majority and may even be constrained within the \nmarginalized group. \nIn lieu of meaningful self-knowledge or self-story, both forms of epistemic \ninjustice lead to epistemic violence, whereby a discourse is imposed on a subordinated, \nsilenced group, which may facilitate more overt forms of violence or oppression \n(Johnstone & Boyle, 2018; Spivak, 1988). Epistemic inequality is where one’s knowledge \nof one’s experience is discredited or dismissed by an agent or agents who presume \nthemselves to be “epistemically superior,” who then recharacterize the “epistemically \ninferior” to themselves in a paternalistic and/or stigmatizing way without being"

Let us review several of them. \nThe medical model may represent misframing the problem of mental illness by \nsolving the problem “at the wrong level.” By reducing mental health issues to individual \nproblems, stigma is created as an externality by implying causality at the individual level \n(Lebowitz & Appelbaum, 2020). A similar insight was used in forming the science of \nsecond-order cybernetics, which assumes that observers are not neutral observers, but \npart of the system they are observing (Heylighen & Joslyn, 2003). When problem-solvers \ndeploy an intuitive framing of a given problem - for example, “I don’t like this behavior \nin my spouse, so I will ﬁght all signs of it” - they are more likely to maintain the problem \nat a higher level by creating a new problem instead - in this case, excessive conﬂict with \nthe spouse, which may depletes positive relational inﬂuence as a motivator for behavior \nchange - and this may only make the original problem worse (see: second order change ; \nFraser & Solovey, 2007). Sometimes a less intuitive solution is needed, but harder to see. \nFor the medical model’s part, framing individual problems has created unintended \nconsequences by blaming individuals for their suﬀering, and also obscured social \netiologies like unsustainable or oppressive social systems (Ratts, 2009). \nThere is also the possibility that blaming the individual is not unintended at all. \nSystems justiﬁcation is the premise that blaming disadvantaged groups for their \nproblems, or the problems of an entire system, has the beneﬁt of allowing advantaged \ngroups to maintain the status quo that beneﬁts them.

Singer’s \nneurodiversity drew on two predominant inﬂuences, the social model of disability, \nwhich advocated that the challenges of disability lay in the systemic barriers and \nexclusionary attitudes of an inhospitable society, and the biodiversity concept of the life \nsciences, which documented the necessity of a rich and diverse biome to maintain \ncritical ecosystems for planetary health (Doyle, 2020). Like the social model of disability \nin Britain in the 1970’s, neurodiversity eschewed diagnoses like autism (since rebranded \nas ASD) and ADHD as diseases to be eradicated, and saw them as positive identities with \nunique contributions of thought and agency to be valued, included and respected \n(Armstrong, 2010; Doyle, 2020; Priscott & Allen, 2021; J.

Importantly, the \nnature of these “strengths-based perspectives” can themselves be controversial (see: \nMeadows, 2020) and may even seem pollyannaish, in part because they are poorly \nunderstood and are often provided by eclectic studies that merely link a diagnosis to a \nvalued trait like creativity, enthusiasm or intelligence in a clinical population (Armstrong, \n2010).

Singer diﬀerentiated between \nneurotypicals -– those who were considered a neuromajority with the cultural privilege \nof being deemed “normal” -– and the neurodivergent, which included a variety of \nneurominorities on one or more spectrums of neurodivergent thought, but are most \nprominently associated with medical diagnoses such as ASD and ADHD (Priscott & Allen, \n2021).

They looked at leading \npathology gene candidates - the DRD4, 5-HTTLPR and MAOA genes - to explore \ncorrelations under not just negative gene-environment interactions, but also positive \nones. Among the ﬁndings, children who were disposed to antisocial treatment after \nbeing exposed to childhood mistreatment while possessing a less sensitive MAOA allele, \nwere less disposed to antisocial behavior when not exposed to mistreatment (Caspi et \nal., 2002).

The same gene variant was disposed to negative emotionality at 6 months of age \nwhen paired with insensitive parenting and childcare, but was less negative than \ncontrols with high-quality parenting and childcare (Pluess & Belsky, 2009; 2010).

From the groups’ perspective, however, \nharmony is most strategic especially in the face of well-organized rival groups, and \nmoral systems often culturally evolve to subvert excessive individual self-interest and \nsocial friction (i.e., cheating, greed or conﬂict), which impair the group’s ability to \neﬀectively organize to counter rivals. \nSocio-cultural evolution solved both dilemmas in shaping moral aﬀective \nresponses to generally solve social challenges with prosocial decision-making emerging \ndeep in the intuitive subconscious.

On both counts the conceptual \nframe is uniquely well-suited to being modeled as an evolutionary social niche which \nserves as the meta-regulator of biopsychospiritual well-being.

In \nthe case of organisms, the teleonomic meta-goal is self-maintenance , or self-\npropagation of one’s own life process across time and space, and this organizes a variety \nof adaptive sub-goals: for instance, resource pursuit and threat avoidance. \nUltimately, then, purposive agency requires a goal of goals, a meta-goal that \norganizes all sub-goals strategically and eﬃciently, and that process is one of niche \nconstruction . Niche construction is the ultimate co-regulator of sustainable self-\nmaintenance, where an organisms’ adaptive tool kit is maximally synergistic with one’s \nenvironment. In the case of humans, one’s individual niche is social, made up of other \nsocial agents and symbiogenic cooperators networked into a higher agency, or super-\nagent - i.e., the agency of an emergent team, tribe or society. In summary, the ultimate \nteleonomic or purposive meta-goal of a relational agent is to seek a social niche-of-ﬁt, \nwhich engages the individual in soliciting ongoing feedback about their success or failure \nto steer toward this progress. Humans have evolved the hard-wiring to register this \nfeedback along a variety of key social substrates, registering success as subjectively \nmeaningful, rewarding and sustaining; while set-backs and failures are demoralizing,"

When one wins or rises in social \nstatus, one is decisive, conﬁdent, calm, deliberate and focused, even as stress levels \ndecline. When one suﬀers a loss, pain centers of the brain are activated, aﬀect is \ndepressed, further competitive or status-primed scenarios are avoided. Serotonin is a \nbioenergetic resource associated with social wins – the “winning eﬀect” – that are not \nonly necessary to get more wins, but that predict doing so. Serotonin makes gains in \nesteem through wins of competition or role-performance more likely, and helps \nconsolidate the competencies of self-eﬃcacy. \nSerotonin confers resilience. When one has the positive aﬀect of an assuaged \nserotonergic system, one can inhibit stress and negative aﬀect – volatility, impulsivity, \nreactivity, and aggression – which then positions one to use more prosocial, long-term, \nsublimated coping strategies and embodied strengths. The “winning eﬀect” suggests \nthis state is not only necessary to beget further wins, it predicts it, which by deﬁnition, \ncreates a resilience to conﬂict or threats of loss."

Related challenges include the traumatic stress of multiple defeats (Hollis & \nKabbaj, 2014), the vicarious defeat of watching another person be defeated (Carnevali et \nal., 2020), or the anticipatory anxiety of competitive and status-primed environments. \nThere are a variety of levels to the phenomenon of social defeat that combine to \ncreate the experience of feeling subordinated against one’s will, which cannot be"

A complimentary frame for defeat is as a form of conﬂict stress, where the \ncommunicated social information is about who is the victor or loser in a competition, \ntypically where the loser’s submission signals fail to end aggression from the victor (see: \narrested ﬂight and suppressed anger ; Björkqvist, 2001; Gilbert, 2001a; Gilbert & Allan, \n1998). In animals, defeat has been studied in the “resident intruder” paradigm, where \nan animal is let into the cage of another and allowed to dominate the latter in a period \nof non-lethal conﬂict; the resulting biopsychosocial consequences for the loser have \nbeen mapped onto the bullying literature in humans where there are striking parallels \nbetween human bullying and social defeat in macaques, baboons, rats and pigs \n(Björkqvist, 2001). A single defeat experience can result in profound bodily changes \nfrom elevated heart rate and blood pressure, stress-promoting adrenocorticotropin \nhormone and hyperthermia, other lingering eﬀects: changes to body temperature \nrhythms, retarded growth, sensitization to stressors more broadly, reduced \ntestosterone and increased anxiety (Hollis & Kabbaj, 2014). Chronic defeat (4-10 days of \ndefeat encounters) adds layers of marked biobehavioral changes: anhedonia, social \navoidance, submissiveness, hyperphagia (insatiable hunger), reduced exploration, \nlocomotion, and sexual behavior; changes to thermoregulation, immune system \nfunctioning, cardiac and circadian rhythms, serotonin metabolism and receptor binding,"

Authors have noted that symptoms of defeat are \na near match for major depressive disorder (Hollis & Kabbaj, 2014), and the subjective \nexperience of defeat is a more powerful predictor of depression than hopelessness \n(Gilbert & Allan, 1998). In humans, a variety of cognitive, behavioral and social \nconsequences commingle in people who feel defeated: loneliness, depression, high \nanxiety, reduced self-esteem, increased submissiveness, social withdrawal, unpopularity \namong peers, feelings of being a failure, feeling wrongfully unintelligent and ugly (i.e., \npotent self-criticism), poor academic achievement, a subjective feeling of \nmaladjustment, and grave dissatisfaction with school and peer relations (Björkqvist, \n2001; Gilbert, 1992b). \nSocial defeat as a social cause of depression is related to abuses of power, or loss \nof status and respect, in the face of futile defenses; this leads to dysregulated defenses, \nmotivation, self-esteem, communication and help-seeking behavior (Gilbert, 2001a). In \nother words, defeat is a depression from the presence of adverse conditions (signals \nmay include an absence of respect) rather than a lack of supportive factors, though \ndefeat is made considerably worse in the absence of social support (see: social \nbuﬀering; Björkqvist, 2001; Carnevali et al., 2020; Crockford et al., 2017).

Mental defeat is the injured ability to coregulate the vertical \nrelationships in one’s life, which disrupts psychological resources like conﬁdence and \nself-esteem; it is both caused by an absence of healthy social conﬂict and protections on \nsocial positions, and prevents one from creating such conditions.

For a social species, protective factors against \ntraumatic stress come from meaningful social conditions such as relationships built on \nmutual reliance, social purpose and a sense of importance – and so social animals are \nalso the most traumatized when these factors are threatened or lost (Bryant, 2016; \nCharuvastra & Cloitre, 2009; Junger, 2016). The perspective emphasizes trauma risk and \nrecovery as social phenomena, and explains paradoxical observations about trauma and \nrecovery. For instance, the social deterioration model of trauma holds that trauma \nshatters one’s ability to feel supported and disrupts social support systems; as \nindividuals reduce expectations of support, they hurt their support relationships, which \nworsens their traumatic stress response and prolongs recovery (Barrera, 1988; Bryant, \n2016; Wheaton, 1985).

Consequently, it can be traumatic to attack one’s social survival \nbecause one is attacking an individual’s sense that they are safe within an ingroup \nwhere subjective safety and threat insensitivity are tied to one’s security in the group, \nand danger is less about objective events, and more how dangerous events can feel if \none feels they are outside the protective context of normal social living (J.

Modern environments need not be overtly \nagonistic to trigger agonic mode because as traumatic stress illustrates, both stressors \nand the loss of psychosocial resources carry trauma risk, so it may be that the subjective \nratio of stressors to energetic resources is suﬃcient to signify threat. The perception of \nwhether an environment feels dangerous may simply be an internal calculation of \nwhether stress feels acute or chronic, and whether stressors feel manageable within \none’s existing mental and social resources. Given that excess stress over-utilizes \nneurotransmitters and can “burn through” them under chronic duress (Gilbert, 1992b), it \nis likely that the subjective qualia of feeling “stressed out” is eﬀectively synonymous \nwith an inability to feel one’s subjective energetic resources which in turn ampliﬁes \nperceived stress in their absence. A similar mechanism has been implicated in \nneurodiverse burnout, where there is an overproliferation of stressors and lack of \nsupport, which fails to provide enough energy to meet social expectations (Raymaker et \nal., 2020); i.e. burnout is about a lack of social energy as resources. Therefore, any path \nthat takes one to an insuﬃcient ratio of stressors to resources–- either due to too many \nstressors or too few resources–- may sensitize agonic mode in the body.

The natural coupling of social stressors with social \nsoothers shows a corollary of this mechanism that is highly relevant to therapy today–- \nwhen encountering stressors in isolation, people naturally seek out the reassuring social \nconnection of trusted allies and partners to calm the stress-response with socially-\ninduced oxytocin, a phenomenon called tend-and-befriend that exists alongside ﬁght-\nﬂight (S.

He characterizes high plasticity thusly: “The exploratory tendency \nassociated with Plasticity should produce the kind of active engagement with novel and \ninteresting phenomena that others tend to ﬁnd dynamic and that is likely to lead to \npersonal growth.” He also summarizes high meta-trait Stability, which it should be noted \nis the opposite character to the one possessed in ADHD: “the self-control or self-\nregulation associated with Stability should make children easier to socialize and may \nalso be strengthened by socialization.” Thus, the temperament strategy connected with \nADHD is one that favors adaptive responsiveness as a reactivity to ecological threat, and \na curiosity and opportunism supporting exploration. Both dimensions would be best \ndeployed in environments that align with the trade-oﬀs favorably, thereby minimizing \nthe costs and leveraging the strengths. \nWhile the previous adaptive trade-oﬀs of the ADHD temperament may be \nassociated with the temperament as a “life history strategy” (Del Giudice, 2018), there is \nanother relatively late ecological consideration that has its own adaptive logic.

Stressors may include: a) masking, where one feels the need to \nhide their minority status and mimic neurotypical status in a way that is exhausting, \nstressful (i.e., the chance of discovery), and prevents authentic connection; b) social, \noccupational and familial obligations; c) disability management; d) life change stress \nsuch as transitions; e) social injuries such as rejections and defeats. Barriers to support \ninclude gaslighting/dismissal of concerns (convincing one their concerns are invalid); \npoor boundaries and self-advocacy (which may arise not only from the diﬃculties with \nrelationships, but the adaptive compensation toward people-pleasing); inability for self-\ncare (“can’t take a break”), and lack of supports/services and resources. When the \ncumulative load meets an inability to ﬁnd relief, inner resources collapse in the face of \nsocial expectation, and burnout results. Again, here we see the three social mentalities in \nplay, and the gas tank model of meaningful resilience may be useful. \nThis autistic burnout model highlights both the challenges and goals of \ntherapeutic niche development.

This chapter will detail the research design and \nmethodology used in the study. \nResearch Design and Methodology \nQualitative research is best used for systematic study of social phenomena in \nnatural settings, particularly if a researcher is interested not just in testing reality, but \ntesting people’s views on reality (Teherani et al., 2015). Berelson (1952) originally \ndeﬁned content analysis as “a research technique for the objective, systematic and \nquantitative description of the manifest content of communication” (p. 18). Downe-\nWambolt (1992) framed content analysis as “a research method that provides a \nsystematic and objective means to make valid inferences from verbal, visual, or written \ndata in order to describe and quantify speciﬁc phenomena” (p. 314). Cavanagh (1997) \ncalled it a ﬂexible method for analyzing text data (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). Content \nanalysis is primarily a means of categorizing text data with a system of coding to make \nrigorous, credible and trustworthy interpretations of the meaning of the data. A central \nstrength of content analysis is to study social behavior, views and messages without \ninﬂuencing them by performing analysis of various forms of media from newspapers, \nbooks, speeches and television broadcasts (Fraenkel & Wallen, 2006). \nContent analysis can be approached through a variety of methods - for instance,"

(2011) found that a variety of studies have sought to understand \nchanges in attitude as a training outcome, including changes in attitudes towards training \nmodels (for instance, parent training and family therapy with the Therapist Attitude \nInventory; TAI; Herschell et al., 2009), evidence-based practices (Evidence Based \nPractice Attitudes Scale; EBPAS; Henggeler et al., 2008; Herschell et al., 2009) or delivery \nmethods (for instance, Attitudes Toward Treatment Manuals; ATTM; Henggeler et al., \n2008), changes in beliefs toward the philosophical models (for instance, toward the \ndisease model of alcoholism versus the psychosocial model with the Understanding of \nAlcoholism Scale; UAS; Morgenstern et al., 2001), and toward competing therapeutics"

The study used a qualitative method to explore the \nnature and change of their beliefs and attitudes about neurodiversity and their \nexpectations of, or reactions to, the training model captured in questionnaires given \nboth before and after the workshop. The methodology employed was directive content \nanalysis, where a curated form of media is coded for salient themes, and the term \n“directive” refers to the interpretive process being theory-driven. The theory used to \nguide coding and interpretation was derived from the research synthesis presented in \nthe workshop including a) framework for evaluating workshop best practices, b) \nneurodiversity-informed questionnaires to inform the range of attitudes and beliefs \nabout neurodiversity, c) forms of epistemic injustice and their consequences, d) a \nneurodiversity consilience drawn from four major social science domains, and e) a social \nanimal theory of mental health sustainability. The questionnaire assessed positions on \nthese issues in three parts - beliefs and attitudes about the medical model (questions 1 \n& 2), beliefs and attitudes about neurodiversity (questions 3 & 4), and \nexpectations/reactions to the training model (questions 5, 6 & 7) - both before the \nworkshop, and afterward, to determine the nature and direction of any change that \nresulted from the workshop.

In terms of inadequacy, the emphasis was on the medical model’s \nclinical limitations, with four sub codes emerging: a perceived lack of conceptual \naccuracy; an “overly simplistic” understanding of “human being’s mental health \nexperiences;” a sense the medical model is not the most eﬀective or client-aligned \ntreatment system; and the incompatibility of the medical model and counselor values of"

Several clinicians addressed this directly, including the role of a) limiting \nassumptions, b) fear, both of complex mental health issues and as a driver of treatment, \nc) punitive treatment, d) diagnoses with strong negative associations, e) diagnosis as \nlimiting access to services, and f) the role of shallow understanding as a risk of \nmisattribution to pathology, and misdiagnosis.  \nFrom Respondent Z3:  \nOne example of the risk of stigma is in a therapist group, when therapists write \ndown the functioning level of an autistic client, the information that is assumed \ncan limit the client's access to therapists.

In retrospect, this is \nlikely due to the low cost of expressing interest and reserving a spot in a free workshop, \nand consequently, the ease of being non-committal about a free workshop, particularly \none that carries the commitment of participating in a study. Attrition during the study \nmay have been compounded by the discovery that the length of the materials required \nonce participants ﬁnished the pre-workshop materials included over 10 hours of video \ncontent. Indeed, two of ﬁve respondents commented that the length of the material \npresented a barrier to using or learning the material on the post-workshop \nquestionnaire. It is worth noting that a consequence of participant attrition may be a \nhypothetical limit on thematic saturation; that is to say, had more participants \ncompleted the post-workshop materials, there may have been more codes to inform the \noverall thematic picture. This is particularly true for the post-workshop questionnaire, \nwhich saw the 9 pre-questionnaire respondents shrink to just ﬁve. However, this is not \ndeemed to present a fatal ﬂaw to the study, as even within the smaller participants' \nresponse pool, a suﬃcient range of responses were observed to suggest a diversity of \nopinions, while patterns between responses also suggested a robustness of themes. \nWhile a boosted sample size would be an obvious target for improvement to this or"

The genetic component of mental health can be accounted for by \nlife history strategies, as certain diagnoses are more prevalent to certain neurotype \nproﬁles (Del Giudice, 2018). The strong implication is that these strategies are not \ninherent predispositions to disorder. Rather, genes for life strategies are designed to \nexploit certain social niches, including unique proﬁles of risk and reward. By \nextension, the genetic disposition is to encounter unique patterns of resources, \ninjuries, strategies and environments, and it is the embodied trade-oﬀs that create \nunique downside risks as a byproduct of these strategies. For instance, some \ntemperaments are sensitive to social information to heighten their general \nresponsiveness to the environment, but high sensitivity to the environment can \nbackﬁre when it heightens the dysphoria of social injuries, a particular risk in toxic \nenvironments with a high distribution of stressors. This account is consistent with \nthe evidence on schizophrenia, including both the heritable components, and the \nsocial defeat hypothesis, which shows that environments that promote excessive \ndefeats in a critical developmental window are implicated. Examples of multilevel \nevolutionary psychological mechanisms like this are important because they \nchallenge the very foundation of mental health stigma and the assumption that \nmental health may reﬂect a natural social order to justify poor social positions as an \ninnate quality.

Addressing real problems. A challenge of this model is that problems are not in \npeople’s heads , and distress captures real factors in social ecologies . If someone is \ndemotivated, alienated or defeated, we assume these to be dynamics of a client’s \nrelationship to their social world , even when they cannot articulate the problem \ncogently. Relevant variables may be, among others, the frequency and magnitude of \ninjuries across time and environments; an inadequate ratio of buﬀers to injuries; and \nfactors predicting the loss of self-regulatory resilience, among others. These root \ncauses lay in evolutionary psychology, evolved social dynamics, and the barriers to \nsustainable meaning and purpose. Mental pain should not be implicated as \n“irrational,” “in one’s head,” or “mental illness,” as this punishes victims of niche \noppression with the reputational injury of being an unreliable narrator (see: \nepistemic injustice). Instead, we optimize for the evolutionary root causes \nthreatening meaning and purpose, and externalize attributions to the predictable \ntriggers of “threat mode” or the delusions of “motivated fantasies.” This approach \nallows new tools to control cognitive faculties more fruitfully and with less stigma at \na deeper level. A clinical trade-oﬀ may be that the stakes are higher and more \ndaunting for therapists. Clinicians must ally with the client against poor positioning in \na social world over which the therapist has little control. However, therapeutic \nalliance only increases by engaging the client in this space, where the client has felt"

Prosocial purpose. An implication of the neurodiversity literature is that there is an \nevolutionary basis for evolved neurotypes not just as adaptive strategies, but as \n“purposive” roles contributing unique goods to the moral commons. These diverse \nsets of ideals - to conserve diﬀerent aspects of what works and make progress \nagainst the many things that do not - evolved as key foundations for diﬀerent ways \nof being in the world. Theories like “complimentary cognition” and “moral \nfoundations theory” hold that only together can these diverse strategies eﬀectively \ncoregulate the moral commons and maintain the sustainability of our collective \nﬁtness. Mental health struggles are a canary in the coal mine, telling us when we are \ndenied these recipes for a meaningful life, and forcing us to change - if we listen to \nit. Each neurotype has a potential to align to a diﬀerent evolved role in “something \nbigger than ourselves,” where we can experience this win-win alignment as a sense \nof meaning and purpose in tandem with other empowered people. Multilevel \nselection theory is increasingly seeing this as a direction in life, to create the \nsustainable hedonic conditions that allows humans to ﬂexibly experiment with \ngrowth toward new “levels” of evolution, and the science tells us that we each have \na part to play to align to this direction as a kind of cosmic purpose."

A model built on sustainable meaning is prosocial, altruistic, long-term \noriented, and values diverse stakeholders. The model doesn’t believe we should manage \nthe worst in people, but seeks to align people to: a) their best potential futures, b) to \neach other, and c) to the best potential environments for human ﬂourishing. Framing \nclinical conversations accordingly should theoretically have tangible returns: in \nfacilitating mental resources for clients, building strong alliances, and orienting people \nto the important aspects of individual and collective sustainability in our time. This \nrequires the mental health ﬁeld to be able to attribute unsustainable mental costs to \nunhealthy social systems, and ideally, to help people embrace their conscious agency to \nrestore the balance. Therapy can be an important vehicle for important conversations. It \nis important that people begin to grapple with the toxic social inﬂuences that cyclically \nseek to corrode society if we do not ﬁnd a way to frame this problem constructively. It is \nimportant we begin to align neurotypes in a multiniche world where they can harmonize \ntheir strengths and oﬀset their respective blinders. It is important that we see the crisis \nof meaning and purpose in the modern world, and help people solve it to build a \nsustainable future for themselves and those around them.

First, this workshop was a qualitative exploration, and \ntherefore has limited transferability (the equivalent of generalizability in quantitative \nresearch). It is possible to extrapolate out some of the precepts of this model both \nquantitatively and empirically, including testing assumptions of the model itself, of \nwhich there are many; this could include anything from exploring the clinical beneﬁts of \nusing these ideas and practices in session on training, to the received beneﬁt of \naﬃrming ideas and practices on client outcomes as a form of empowerment and de-\nstigmatization. Second, because of information oﬀered on barriers outlined in question \n6, this clinician has already beneﬁted tremendously from the feedback presented, and \ncan imagine multiple ways of signiﬁcantly reducing the size and complexity of the \nmaterial in line with the notes oﬀered by respondents. This includes lessons about \ndelivering workshops such as to expect signiﬁcant attrition based on the low cost of \nexpressing interest in a workshop, and the beneﬁts of getting feedback on those who \ndrop out to improve participant retention up front. Third, as a basis for evolving the \ncurrent neurodiversity discourse, it would be useful to see if consilience research can \nﬁnd some practical purchase in the research landscape. From harmonizing stakeholders \nto creating dynamic and rich models that take value-based stances that are pro-justice \nand diversity, to creating room for exploring how diﬀerent approaches and perspectives \ncan mutually-validate one another to create complex, contextual, biopsychosocial, \nfunctional paradigms. The result is a rich integrative framework that is useful and \nempowering, accurate and rich, prosocial and just.

This study aims to assess the success of models that A) identify potential \nsources of stigma in how neurodiversity is currently framed, B) explore the roots of \n“normal” neurodiversity to ground a new vision of non-pathological understanding, and \nC) offer holistic treatments catering to strengths, challenges and niches for neurotypes \nfacing social challenges in sometimes hostile social environments. The purpose of this \nstudy is to shift our lens on neurodiversity as a treatment in itself, as by helping to know \ncommunities in empowering, authentic ways, we help de-stigmatize mental health \nchallenges that arise natural differences in ways of interacting with the world. Your \nparticipation in this project will help in these matters.

More \ninformation can be facilitated by contacting the PI (information below).  \nYour participation in this recruitment for this project will help in these matters. \nParticipants will complete a questionnaire (7 questions) before and after the workshop \nto gauge attitudes, beliefs and reactions. We will be offering the workshop at no cost, \nand providing continuing education units (CEUs) necessary for professional \ndevelopment and licensure requirements.  \nIf you have any questions or would like more information, please see the contact \ninformation below or you may contact the Adler Institutional Review Board at \nIRB@adler.edu.  \nPlease send an email confirmation that provides permission to post the recruitment \npost.  \n \nPlease feel free to pass this study information to other people who might be willing to \nparticipate!  \n \nThank you in advance for your time and consideration.  \n \nMorgan Kinney, LCPC  \nPhD Student  \nAdler University  \n(207)409-0183  \nmkinney@adler.edu"

We would like to invite you to participate \nin this research project; participation is voluntary, and can be revoked at any time. Your \nparticipation will aid in clarifying the utility of destigmatizing models of neurodiversity \nand mental health treatment, as well as assess the practicality of potential tools.  \n \nWhat to expect  \nYou must be over the age of 18 to participate in this study. If you choose to \nparticipate in the study you will be asked to fill out a short demographic form and fill out \na pre-workshop questionnaire of seven open-ended questions prior to taking a \nworkshop, and you will take the questionnaire again after the workshop. Your responses \nto these questionnaires will be submitted via an anonymous document sent to your \nemail that will be forwarded to the primary investigator devoid of identifying \ninformation. Afterward, there may be a limited number of clarifying questions sent by \nemail. At the end of the study, any select excerpts used in the dissertation will be sent \nback to the participant to ensure their agreement with the interpretation offered, a \nprocess called member checking  to ensure accuracy and trustworthiness in the analysis \nprocess. \nPlease see the workshop flier for information on the workshop. As part of taking \nthe workshop, there will be some activities including answering questions, discussions, \nand self-inventories typical of most workshops. The workshop is developed by Morgan \nKinney, a staff member at Veduta Consulting and the primary investigator in the study. \nVeduta Consulting is partnering in the delivery of the workshop as part of its delivery of \ncontinuing education materials. It is important to note that no one but the primary \ninvestigator, including anyone at Veduta Consulting, will be privy to any data collected in \nthis study at any time, including an assistant who will aid directly in the workshop and \nstudy only by helping to keep data secure and anonymous. All data will be transmitted \nthrough secure email and will be kept on a secure PC in the primary investigators home. \nNo answers or participation in the study will affect the ability of workshop participants \nto receive continuing education units, nor will they impact any services one might \nreceive from Veduta Consulting.  \n \nConfidentiality and withdrawal from participation  \nQuestionnaire responses will be stored on a password-protected computer at \nthe private investigators home and kept confidential until the conclusion of the study, \napproximately 1 year, and then destroyed. You have the option of matching these \nsecurity precautions, or else accepting whatever degree of security you would like to \nmaintain as sufficient to your standards. Portions of your answers may be excerpted as"

Your answers were thoughtful, impactful and helped to \nshape useful directions for further study. \n \nAttached is a transcript of your answers to both the pre- and post-workshop \nquestionnaires for you to confirm your answers. This is part of a process called “member \nchecking” where we hope to ensure the trustworthiness and credibility of the research \nby allowing you to confirm the clarity of the information provided. You are not required \nto do anything further with this transcript.  The point is to give you the opportunity to \nensure the fidelity of your responses, and give you a chance to amend them if you see fit \n(please note: you do not need to be concerned about spelling, as it will be corrected in \nthe report; grammar will likely be preserved, however, and can be changed if it \nimproves the clarity of your meaning). \n \nFor each of the 14 answers in your transcripts, below are three questions to guide how \nand why you might alter your responses: \n1. Do the transcribed responses match your intended sentiment? \n2. Do you want to change anything? \n3. Do you want to add anything? \nIf you would like the opportunity to add or change something, please respond inline or \nbelow the original answer. Feel free to elaborate on why you thought the change is \nnecessary. \n \nIn select cases, one or two lines in your responses have been highlighted to invite any \nclarification of your intended meaning and a researcher note provides further \ninformation. This would be to remove some minor ambiguity or ensure accuracy of an \ninterpretation; there are no wrong answers, and no answers need to be changed.  \n \nPlease keep in mind the point is to clarify the original intention, not to revise your \nperspective in hindsight. The goal is to ensure accuracy in the original messaging as \nconveyed, and less to update your views. This is to avoid giving some respondents the \nopportunity to add a second data collection point that not all respondents might take \nadvantage of, which might complicate the interpretation of results. It will be up to the \nresearcher’s discretion to make choices where this boundary might lay.      \n \nIf you make any changes, simply attach them to an email response and they will be \nreturned to the researcher in their de-identified forms. You will have two weeks to"
