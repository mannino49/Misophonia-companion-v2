Correlational data suggest that \ndifficulties with attention regulation and impulsivity may play a role in misophonia, albeit attention functions \nwere intact. Results should be interpreted with caution given the variability in diagnostic definitions, and more \nresearch is needed to understand cognitive functioning under ‘cold ’ conditions in misophonia.   \nMisophonia is characterized by strong aversion to a range of pri-\nmarily human-produced sounds, including those related to eating (e.g., \nchewing, swallowing, slurping), nasal sounds (e.g., sniffing and \ninhaling), rustling sounds (e.g., paper, plastic), and repetitive tapping (e. \ng., pen clicking, foot tapping; Swedo et al., 2022 ; Swedo et al., 1989 ), \nalthough misophonia triggers may also include sounds produced by \nanimals as well as some forms of visual movement, often termed miso-\nkinesia (Hansen, Leber, & Saygin, 2021 ). Despite the variability in the \ntype of trigger stimuli, misophonic responses to triggers involve a \nsimilar pattern of aversive physiological reactions and intense negative \nemotions including irritability, anxiety, and extreme anger (Edelstein, \nBrang, Rouw, & Ramachandran, 2013 ; Ferrer-Torres & Gim˘enez-Llort, \n2022 ). These may be accompanied by an impulsive behavioral response \n(Potgieter et al., 2019 ) such as verbal aggression (Schroder, Vulink, & \nDenys, 2013 ; Swedo et al., 2022 ); or by avoidance of the misophonic \ntrigger (Potgieter et al., 2019 ). Notably, the misophonic response may include physical aggression, although research indicates that these re-\nsponses are rather rare and more common in youth (Swedo et al., 2022 ). \nIn the two decades since the term misophonia was first coined by \nJastreboff and Jastreboff (2001) , researchers have reported that miso-\nphonia is likely associated with rigidity and with deficient emotion \nregulation and impulse control (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ; Guetta, \nCassiello-Robbins, Trumbull, Anand, & Rosenthal, 2022 ), and that fea-\ntures of the stimuli such as volume are less important than the person ’s \nattribution of meaning to the action and sound, particularly the \nperception that the action and the sound produced are contextually \ninappropriate (Cowan, Marks, & Pinto, 2022 ). However, research on \nmisophonia suffers from inconsistency across studies regarding core \nfeatures, mechanisms, comorbidity, and prevalence; in part because \nformal diagnostic criteria for misophonia have not yet been established. \nFor example, published estimates of the prevalence of misophonia range \nas widely as 5%–18% (Jakubovski, Müller, Kley, de Zwaan, & \n*Corresponding author.

      "text": "Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry 82 (2024) 101897\n2Müller-Vahl, 2022 ; Kılıç, Oz, Avano ˚glu, & Aksoy, 2021 ; Vitoratou et al., \n2023 ). As such, more research is needed to understand multiple aspects \nof misophonia (Cowan et al., 2022 ; Frank, Roszyk, Hurley, & McKay, \n2020 ). \nEvidence suggests that the misophonic reaction involves fight-or- \nflight sympathetic nervous system activation, and hyperactivity in the \nlimbic system, particularly the amygdala (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Kumar \net al., 2017 ). Indeed, the intense aversiveness of the misophonic sounds \nand associated emotional response often leads to broad avoidance of \nsituations in which the triggering sounds are likely to be encountered, \nsuch as dinner with family and going out to restaurants or movie the-\naters, or excessively using headphones to avoid trigger sounds. Such \nbehaviors may significantly impair family and social functioning (Pot-\ngieter et al., 2019 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ). \nInitially, Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2014) suggested that misophonia \nis not associated with psychopathology. However, in light of accumu -\nlating research, it is becoming increasingly clear that the condition is \nassociated with elevated anxiety and stress symptoms and increased \ncomorbidity with DSM disorders including anxiety disorders, mood \ndisorders, personality disorders, obsessive compulsive-related disorders, \npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), autism spectrum disorder, and \nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Erfanian, Kartsonaki, & \nKeshavarz, 2019 ; Potgieter et al., 2019 ; Swedo et al., 2022 ). Although \nthe lack of formal diagnostic criteria for misophonia precludes reliably \ncharacterizing comorbidity, it is clear from studies that use a range of \ncriteria that misophonia frequently co-occurs with other clinically sig-\nnificant psychological symptoms and disorders. For example, some \nstudies report that more than half of their misophonia sample met \ncriteria for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD, 54.4%; \nSchroder et al., 2013 ) which was considered by the authors as a risk \nfactor for misophonia. They also speculated that ADHD (4.8%) may be \nrelated to misophonia due to distractibility and attentional shifts be-\ntween visual and auditory cues (Schroder et al., 2013 ). Other studies \nfound elevated comorbidity with OCD (15%), PTSD (15%) MDD (10%; \nErfanian et al., 2019 ), and anxiety disorders (33%; Cassiello-Robbins \net al., 2021 ). \n1.Cognitive function in misophonia \nVery little is known about cognitive functioning in misophonia, as \nfew studies have been published to date (Daniels, Rodriguez, & Zabe-\nlina, 2020 ; Eijsker, Schroder, Smit, van Wingen, & Denys, 2019 ; Frank \net al., 2020 ). However, in examining cognitive functioning in miso-\nphonia, it is important to recognize that the misophonic reactions and \nresponses that may affect cognitive functioning occur in specific con-\ntexts. To that end it is useful to distinguish between ‘cold ’ cognitive \nfunctioning, which occurs under emotionally neutral conditions; and \n‘hot’ cognitive functioning, which occurs in response to emotionally \ncharged conditions or stimuli. In a study of ‘hot’ cognitive functioning in \nmisophonia using the Stroop paradigm, Daniels et al. (2020) found a \nlarger Stroop effect among misophonia participants when continuous \nmisophonic trigger sounds were played. Similarly, attention-related task \nperformance was worse during misophonic provocation (Daniels et al., \n2020 ; Eijsker et al., 2019 ; Frank et al., 2020 ; Simner, Koursarou, Rinaldi, \n& Ward, 2021 ). Another study that used a dichotic listening task re-\nported that individuals with misophonia were significantly less accurate \nin identifying sentences while listening to misophonia trigger sounds (da \nSilva & Sanchez, 2019 ). \nTo our knowledge only two studies have examined ‘cold ’ cognitive \nfunctioning in misophonia (i.e., cognitive functioning in the absence of \nmisophonic provocation), neither of which found any performance dif-\nference between misophonia and control samples. Simner et al. (2021) \nfound no differences in visual attention performance on an embedded \nfigures attention task. Similarly, no misophonia-related deficits were \nobserved on the Stop Signal Task, a measure of inhibitory functioning, \nwhen administered without misophonic provocation (Eijsker et al., 2019 ). Given the limited research to date in this area, the aim of the \npresent study was to conduct a neuropsychological examination of \nmisophonia, focusing on cold cognitive functioning. However, the \nabsence of information about cold cognitive functioning in misophonia \nmakes it difficult to draw clear directional hypotheses, particularly \ngiven that misophonia may not disrupt cognition outside the context of \nresponding to provocation, and so any cognitive deficits may be \nobserved primarily during exposure to misophonic trigger sounds. The \naim of the present study is to provide comprehensive information \nregarding cognitive functioning without misophonic symptom provo -\ncation, clinical and diagnostic status, and their association in misopho -\nnia compared to a control group. \n2.Methods \n2.1. Participants \nThe final sample of ninety-six participants was drawn from a larger \nsample (N 275) that was part of a large neuropsychological study at a \nuniversity in the southwestern United States. Participants were recruited \nvia flyers and recruitment emails distributed to students. Inclusion \ncriteria included minimum age of 18, normal or corrected vision, and \nfluency in English. Exclusion criteria included age F65 or any history of \nmajor neurological conditions (e.g., epilepsy, brain injury). Participants \nwere asked to avoid recreational drugs, prescription benzodiazepines, \nstimulant medications, or more than two alcoholic drinks in the 24 h \nprior to the experiment. The overall study sample consisted of 67 fe-\nmales (69.8%) and 29 males (30.2%) with an average age of 20.91 (SD \n2.87). The sample was ethnically diverse (See Table 1.). Because there \nare no formal diagnostic criteria for misophonia, we used the Miso-\nphonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu, Lewin, Murphy, & Storch, 2014 ) to \nestablish the misophonia and control groups. The MQ is among the most \nfrequently used measures of misophonia (Rosenthal et al., 2021 ). The \nMQ guidelines suggest that a score of 7 or higher on the single item \nsound sensitivity severity scale is the optimal cutoff for identifying \nmisophonia; this recommended cutoff has been used in numerous pre-\nvious misophonia studies (e.g., Frank et al., 2020 ; Grossini et al., 2022 ; \nGuetta, Cassiello-Robbins, Trumbull, et al., 2022 ; McKay, Kim, Mancusi, \nStorch, & Spankovich, 2018 ; Schadegg, Clark, & Dixon, 2021 ; Zhou, Wu, \n& Storch, 2017 ). Following this recommendation, the misophonia group \n(n 32) consisted of participants that scored ≽7 on the MQ sound \nsensitivity item, and the control sample (n 64) included participants \nwhose score was in the sample ’s lowest quartile on this item. Notably, as \npresented in the results section, the mean MQ subscale and total scores \nfound in the present study were remarkably similar to scores found in \nprevious studies, which facilitates comparability with the results of the \npresent work. See Table 1 for demographic information. \n2.2. Materials \n2.2.1. Clinical measures \nMini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview 7.0 (MINI; Sheehan \net al., 1998 ). The MINI is a valid and reliable semi-structured screening \ninterview for primary DSM-5 disorders. The MINI 7.0 has demonstrated \ngood psychometric properties (Sheehan et al., 1998 ). \nDepression, Stress, Anxiety Scale-21 (DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovi-\nbond, 1995 ). The DASS-21 is a self-report questionnaire that assesses the \nseverity of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in the past week. \nEach item is scored from 0 – “did not apply to me at all” to 3 – “applied to \nme very much or most of the time”. The DASS-21 demonstrates very good \npsychometric properties (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995 ), including in \nclinical (Clara, Cox, & Enns, 2001 ) and non-clinical samples (Sinclair \net al., 2012 ). In the present study, good to excellent reliability was found \n(Cronbach ’s α 0.92, 0.74, and 0.83, for the depression, anxiety, and \nstress subscales respectively). \nSix Item-State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6; Marteau & Bekker, A. Abramovitch et al."

The STAI-6 is a 6-item short-form self-report questionnaire \nadapted from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The STAI-6 demon -\nstrates good internal consistency in clinical and non-clinical samples (α \n0.82; Marteau & Bekker, 1992 ), as well as in the present study (α \n0.86). \nThe Eysenck Impulsiveness-Venturesomeness-Empathy Question -\nnaire (I-7; Eysenck, Pearson, Easting, & Allsopp, 1985 ) The I-7 is a \n54-item self-report questionnaire that utilizes a “yes or no” format and \nthat includes three subscales: Impulsiveness, Venturesomeness (i.e., risk \ntaking), and Empathy. The measure demonstrates good psychometric \nproperties in non-clinical samples including good internal consistency \n(α 0.83; Eysenck et al., 1985 ). The outcome of interest in the present \nstudy was the I-7 Impulsiveness subscale score for which good internal \nconsistency was found (α 0.83). \nBarkley Functional Impairment Scale (BFIS; Barkley, 2011 ). The \n15-item BFIS assesses functional impairment in multiple domains of \neveryday life (e.g., school/work, social). The BFIS demonstrates good \npsychometric properties (Barkley, 2011 ). Due to a technical error only \nthe first 10 BFIS items were administered. However, the BFIS manual \nindicates that the measure was developed to allow utilizing each indi-\nvidual item as a standalone functional construct and provides itemized \nnorms. Thus, each item was used as a domain indicator and no summary \nscore was computed. \nMisophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al., 2014 ). The MQ consists of 17 items and comprises three subscales: MQ-1, assessing types and \ndegree of sensitivity to trigger sounds; MQ-2, assessing the misophonic \nbehavioral response; and MQ-3, assessing severity of sound sensitivity. A \nscore of 7 or higher on the sound sensitivity subscale (MQ-3) indicates \nclinically significant misophonia. This cutoff has been used in several \nprevious misophonia studies (e.g., Guetta, Cassiello-Robbins, Trumbull, \net al., 2022 ; Schadegg et al., 2021 ). The MQ demonstrates good psy-\nchometric properties in non-clinical samples (Wu et al., 2014 ), as well as \nin the present study (α 0.83). \n2.2.2. Neuropsychological measures \n2.2.2.1. Executive functions. The Trail Making Test, Part B (TMB; Delis, \nKaplan, & Kramer, 2001 ). The TMB is a subtest of the Trail Making Test \nthat assesses attentional set shifting in the graphomotor modality. Par-\nticipants are instructed to draw a line connecting circled numbers and \nletters while alternating between numbers and letters in ascending \norder. The TMB ’s primary outcome measure is time to completion. \nThe Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST; Loong, 1990 ) is a well-known \nexecutive function test that assesses set shifting, concept formation, and \nutilization of feedback. A computerized version of the WCST was used in \nthe present study. Outcomes of interest were percent perseverative er-\nrors and the number of categories completed. \nThe Tower of London (TOL; Shallice, 1982 ) assesses planning ability \nand problem-solving skills. This task requires participants to move beads \nto match model goal arrangements while following specific rules. A \ncomputerized version of the TOL was used. The total number of excess \nmoves beyond the minimum required to complete all models was used as \nthe outcome measure. \nVerbal Fluency (VF; Delis et al., 2001 ) includes two subtests, one of \nwhich involves phonemic/letter fluency and another involving cat-\negory/semantic fluency. The total number of words in each subtest was \nthe outcome measure of interest. \nThe Symbol Span Test (Wechsler, 2009 ) is a subtest of the Wechsler \nMemory Scale – IV (WMS-IV; Wechsler, 2009 ) that assesses visual \nworking memory. Visual figures of various shapes are presented on a \npage, after which participants are presented with a recognition page that \nincludes both target and distractor shapes. Examinees are to select the \nitems that were previously viewed in the same sequence in which they \nhad been presented. The outcome measure was total points earned. \nThe Digit Span task (DS) is a subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelli -\ngence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV; Wechsler, 2008 ) that assesses verbal working \nmemory. The DS test includes 3 subtests, all of which involve hearing \nand recalling digit sequences of increasing length. DS Forward requires \nrepeating digits in the same order they were presented, DS backward \ninvolves repeating digits in reverse order from their presentation, and \nDS sequencing requires that digits be recalled in ascending order. In the \npresent study the DS subtests and the overall DS total score were used as \noutcome measures of working memory. \nThe Conners ’ Continuous Performance Test – 3rd Edition (CPT-III; \nConners, 2014 ) is a continuous performance test that evaluates atten -\ntion, as well as processing speed and response inhibition. The number of \ncommission errors serves as an indicator of response inhibition, with \nmore commission errors reflecting worse response inhibition. \n2.2.2.2. Memory. The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT; Oster -\nrieth, 1944 ) assesses visuospatial memory. In the present study, short \ndelay (3 min), and long delay recall (30 min) were used as outcome \nmeasures. \nThe California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT; Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, & \nOber, 2000 ) is a word list-based auditory-verbal memory task that as-\nsesses immediate and delayed verbal memory. The outcome measures \nused in the present study were the total number of words recalled \ncorrectly in both the short and long delay, and the cumulative number of \nwords correctly recalled on trials 1–5.

The CPT-III (Conners, 2014 ) hit reaction time stan-\ndard deviation (HRTSD) and omission errors were used as outcome \nmeasures to assess attention function. The number of omission errors \nreflects vigilance-related attention, with fewer omission errors indi-\ncating better attention. \n2.2.2.4. Processing speed. The CPT-III (Conners, 2014 ) average hit re-\naction time (HRT) in milliseconds for ‘go’ stimuli was used to assess \nprocessing speed. \nThe Trail Making Test, part A (TMA; Delis et al., 2001 ) is a graph -\nomotor task that involves drawing lines between numbered circles in \nascending order. The TMA was used to assess processing speed as a \nfunction of completion time in seconds. \n2.2.2.5. Visuospatial function. The RCFT (Osterrieth, 1944 ) copy trial \nscore was used as a measure of visuospatial function. \n2.3. Procedure \nGraduate student research assistants (RAs) underwent rigorous \ntraining conducted by the first and last authors, both experienced neu-\nropsychologists. Training included hands-on instructional training, \nmultiple mock administrations of the neuropsychological battery and \nthe MINI, examination of video recordings, as well as one-on-one in- \nperson evaluations. At the end of each study session, RAs would score all \nmeasures and tests. Subsequently, to minimize errors, a dedicated data \nmanager carefully reviewed all scoring for all participants prior to data \nentry. All participants were requested to avoid taking any stimulant \nmedications, sedatives, or to consume more than two alcoholic drinks \n24 h prior to the time of assessment. Participants were seen individually \nin a quiet lab room, and after signing an informed consent, completed \nthe MINI clinical interview, followed by the neuropsychological battery \nand the self-report questionnaires, the order of which was counter -\nbalanced. Self-report questionnaires were completed in the lab online \nvia the Qualtrics secured online platform. Each session took ~3.5 h on \naverage, including a 10-min break. All computerized tests and ques-\ntionnaires were administered on identical laptops designated for the \nstudy. This study was approved by the Texas State University Institu -\ntional Review Board according to the declaration of Helsinki. \n2.4. Analytic plan \nStatistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS v.27.0 (2020 ). \nNominal demographic variables were analyzed using Pearson ’s Х2 tests \n(Fishers Exact Test correction was applied as needed), whereas group \ndifferences in continuous variables were assessed using analysis of \nvariance (ANOVA). In cases of violations of homogeneity of variance, \nthe Welch ’s statistic of robust test for equality of means was employed if \nneeded (Welch, 1938 ) to maintain power while maintaining alpha at the \ndesired level (Glantz & Slinker, 2001 ). Pearson zero-order correlations \nwere used to assess associations between symptoms and neuropsycho -\nlogical outcomes. A clinical neuropsychological study was never con-\nducted before in misophonia and thus this report meets formal \ndefinitions of a pilot study (Everitt, 2021 ). Furthermore, since there are \nno previous published neuropsychological data on misophonia, and thus \neffect size estimation is not obtainable, power calculation was not per-\nformed for the present investigation. However, our sample size (n 96) \nis much larger than the average sample size in non-pilot neuropsycho -\nlogical studies (Mean n 53; Bezeau & Graves, 2001 ). Furthermore, \neven though this is a pilot study, with a relatively large sample, we took \na conservative approach to avoid familywise inflation of type I error and \nemployed correction for multiple comparisons using the \nHolm-Bonferroni method (Holm, 1979 ). Effect size magnitude was \ninterpreted based on Cohen ’s d (2013 ) where small, medium, and large \neffect sizes correspond to 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8, respectively. Additionally, all comparative analyses of neuropsychological outcomes were conducted \non raw test scores. However, to facilitate interpretation of the test re-\nsults, mean and standard deviations are also presented in standardized Z \nscores produced via test norms (see supplementary materials Table S1). \n3.Results \n3.1. Demographic and clinical variables \nNo significant group differences were found in age, education, \ngender, race, or ethnicity (Table 1.). The total study sample was char-\nacterized by a plurality of females (69.8%) which was more pronounced \nin the control group (75%) but with no significant group difference. The \nsamples were ethnically and racially diverse with a numerical minority \nof participants identifying as White American (42.70%). As expected, \nthe misophonia group scored significantly higher on all the MQ sub-\nscores with very large effect sizes including on the intensity of range of \ntrigger sounds (MQ-1, d 1.25), types and frequency of misophonic \nreaction (MQ-2, d 1.42), and overall severity of sound sensitivity (MQ- \n3, d 3.92) . Notably, the MQ mean sub-scores for both the misophonia \nand controls groups were found to be remarkably similar to those found \nin a number of previous studies (Frank et al., 2020 ; Grossini et al., 2022 ; \nMcKay et al., 2018 ; Wu et al., 2014 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ). The misophonia \ngroup also presented with significantly higher levels of general anxiety \nas measured by the DASS-21 Anxiety (d 0.5), state-anxiety as \nmeasured by the STAI-6 (d 0.62), and impulsivity (d 0.71) as \nmeasured by the I-7. No significant group differences were found for \ndepression and stress symptoms as measured by the DASS-21 although \nnumerically the misophonia group scored higher than controls on the \nDASS-21 Depression (d 0.22) and Stress (d 0.41) scales (see Table 1). \n3.2. Neuropsychological test performance \nGroup comparisons on all neuropsychological outcomes are pre-\nsented in Table 2 by neuropsychological domains and subdomains. See \nstandard Z scores computed using test norms in supplementary materials \n(Table S1.). For a graphic depiction see Fig. 1. \n3.2.1. Executive function \nNo significant group differences were found on tests assessing set \nshifting (d range 0.27 –0.36), planning (d 0.16), working memory (d \nrange 0.02 –0.33), or response inhibition (d 0.02). On tests of verbal \nfluency, although there was no significant difference on the letter \nfluency score (d 0.02), a significant difference that survived multi -\nplicity correction was found for category/semantic fluency (d 0.47). \nOverall, a significant difference was found only on 1 out 12 executive \nfunction outcome measures. \n3.2.2. Memory \nNo significant group differences were found on non-verbal memory \nperformance as measured by the RCFT including the immediate (d \n0.20) and delayed memory (d 0.30) trials, both of which showed small \neffect sizes (see Table 2). In contrast, a significant group difference was \nfound on the CVLT short delay recall on which the misophonia sample \nunderperformed (d 0.63). This comparison survived correction for \nmultiple comparisons . No significant differences were found for the \nCVLT sum of trials 1–5 or long delay recall. However, although not \nsignificant, small effect sizes favoring performance in the control group \nwere found (d’s 0.37 and 0.44 respectively). \n3.2.3. Processing speed \nNo significant group differences were found on the TMA (d 0.31), \nor the CPT-III task HRT (d 0.23). \n3.2.4. Attention \nNo significant group differences were found in the number of CPT-III A. Abramovitch et al."

Visuospatial function \nFinally, there was no significant difference on the RCFT copy trial \nbetween the misophonia and control groups (d 0.38). \n3.3. Comorbidity \nA series of Pearson ’s Х2 tests were conducted to compare the groups \non DSM disorders as established via the MINI interview (see Table 3). \nThe groups did not differ significantly on the overall percent of partic -\nipants meeting criteria for any DSM-5 disorder. However, although not \nstatistically significant, the prevalence of OCD in the misophonia group \n(9.4%), was threefold higher than in the control group (3.1%). Similarly, \nwithin the misophonia group, the prevalence of ADHD (15.6%), any \neating disorders (6.30%) and panic disorder (6.3%), was higher than the \nprevalence in the general population, and nearly twice that of the con-\ntrol group (ADHD, 9.4%; eating disorders, 3.1%, panic disorder 3.1%). \n3.4. Functional indices \nA series of ANOVAs was conducted to assess group differences in the \nBFIS functional indices (see Table 4). Self-reported functional impair -\nment scores were significantly higher for the misophonia group on \nfunctional domains including home-chores (d 0.47), money manage -\nment (d 0.61), and driving, (d 0.58) with small to medium effect \nsizes. In addition, the misophonia group scored significantly higher than \ncontrols on the BFIS total mean score (Total Mean Impairment; d \n0.53). Group comparisons on the mean percent impaired domains (i.e., \nthe average percent of domains scores that met the test’s cutoff scores \nfor impairment in each domain, across participants) indicated a signif -\nicantly larger percent of impaired domains (d 0.64) in the misophonia \ngroup (27%) compared to the control group (11%). No significant dif-\nferences were found in any other BFIS domains. Nevertheless, numeri -\ncally across domains, all BFIS functional domain outcomes exemplified \nworse functioning in the misophonia group. Notably, all mean domain \nscores within the two groups did not cross the BFIS normative cutoff \nscores to indicate a meaningful functional impairment (Barkley, 2011 ). \n3.5. Correlations between neuropsychological and misophonia outcomes \nPearson ’s zero-order correlations were computed between neuro -\npsychological outcomes and the MQ subscale scores within the miso-\nphonia group, most of which were not significant (see Table 5). \nHowever, four of the correlations were significant. CPT-III number of \nomission errors (sustained attention) was significantly correlated with \nthe MQ-1 (types and severity of misophonia triggers; r 0.41, p \n0.019), with the MQ-2 (types and severity of the misophonic reaction; r \n0.42, p 0.022), and with the total MQ score (r 0.42, p 0.022). \nDigit Span forward (working memory) was significantly negatively \ncorrelated only with the MQ-3 score (sound sensitivity; r -0.42, p \n0.018). These correlations survived multiplicity corrections. No other \nsignificant correlations were identified. \n3.6. Correlations between clinical symptoms and misophonia severity \nCorrelations between general clinical symptoms and misophonia \nsymptoms were examined separately for the misophonia and control \ngroups.

Neither DASS-21 Depression nor DASS-21 Anxiety \nwere significantly correlated with any MQ variables for either group. No \nsignificant correlations were observed between the STAI-6 (state anxi-\nety) and any of the MQ subtests for either group. \nWithin the misophonia group, however, impulsivity (I-7) was found \nto be significantly and positively correlated with the MQ-2 subscale \nscore (misophonic response; r 0.45, p 0.01), and MQ-3 (single item \nsound sensitivity/severity score; r 0.45, p 0.01), as well as MQ Total \n(r 0.48, p 0.009). No significant correlation was found between I-7 \nImpulsivity and MQ-1 (types and severity of misophonic trigger sounds). \nWithin the control group, significant positive correlations were found \nbetween the DASS-21 Stress subscale and the MQ-1 (r 0.36, p \n0.004), and MQ Total (r 0.33, p 0.01). No significant associations \nwere found between the DASS-21 Stress and MQ subscales for the \nmisophonia sample. \n4.Discussion \nThe present study is the first examination of neuropsychological functions in misophonia, as well as potential clinical and functional \ncorrelates. \n4.1. Neuropsychological test performance \nThe misophonia group performed similarly to the control group on \nnearly all neuropsychological tests (albeit numerically demonstrated \ngenerally lower performance), with only two outcome variables that \ndiffered significantly, both of which substantially involve verbal mem-\nory retrieval: Semantic (category) fluency, and CVLT short-delay free \nrecall. Specifically, the misophonia group significantly underperformed \non the CVLT short delay recall trial, with medium effect size (d 0.63) \nwhich substantially involves verbal memory retrieval processes. In \naddition, albeit not statistically significant, we found further indications \nof poorer verbal memory functioning in the misophonia group [CVLT \nnumber of words on trials 1–5 (d 0.37, p 0.08); CVLT long delay \nrecall (d 0.44, p 0.06)]. Although verbal fluency tasks are often \nconsidered tests of executive functions, research suggests that phonemic \n(letter) fluency is a true executive function whereas semantic (category) \nfluency reflects verbal memory retrieval processes more than executive \nFig. 1.Neuropsychological domains Cohen ’s d effect sizes exemplifying underperformance within the misophonia group.  \nTable 3 \nPrevalence of current DSM disorders in the misophonia and control groups.   \nMisophonia (n \n32) Control (n \n64) X2 Sig. \nMajor Depressive Disorder 3.10% (1) 7.80% (5) 0.80 0.66 \nSocial Anxiety Disorder 3.10% (1) 3.10% (2) 0.00 1.00 \nGeneralized Anxiety \nDisorder 3.10% (1) 4.70% (3) 0.13 1.00 \nPanic Disorder 6.30% (2) 3.10% (2) 0.55 0.60 \nAgoraphobia 3.20% (1) 3.20% (2) 0.00 1.00 \nPost-Traumatic Stress \nDisorder 3.10% (1) 1.60% (1) 0.26 1.00 \nObsessive-Compulsive \nDisorder 9.40% (3) 3.10% (2) 1.69 0.33 \nAnorexia Nervosa 3.10% (1) 0.00% (0) 2.02 0.33 \nBulimia Nervosa 3.10% (1) 3.10% (2) 0.00 1.00 \nBinge Eating Disorder 3.10% (1) 0.00% (0) 2.02 0.33 \nADHD 15.60% (5) 9.40% (6) 0.82 0.50 \nSubstance Abuse Disorder 9.40%.

Indeed, imaging studies \nreveal that semantic verbal fluency is associated with the activation of \nleft temporal regions, which are associated with verbal memory \nretrieval, whereas prefrontal cortex activation, which has been more \nclosely linked with executive functions, is associated in phonemic \nfluency tasks (Ghanavati, Salehinejad, Nejati, & Nitsche, 2019 ). As such, \nthe poorer performance on semantic fluency likely reflects reduced \nverbal memory retrieval and not reduced executive function perfor -\nmance. Indeed, none of the several measures of executive function indicated significant underperformance by the misophonia group rela-\ntive to the control group. It is unclear at present why verbal memory \nretrieval specifically would be affected more than other cognitive do-\nmains in misophonia. However, functional, and structural imaging \nstudies of misophonia suggests alterations in brain structures and \nfunctions associated with verbal memory retrieval, including the pre-\ncuneus, and temporal lobe structures, including the hippocampus \n(Eijsker et al., 2021 ; Kumar et al., 2021 ; Neacsiu et al., 2022 ). \nNotwithstanding, it is notable that the magnitude of effect sizes \n(small-to-medium in magnitude) pertaining to verbal memory retrieval \nunderperformance found in the present study did not reach a level of \ncognitive impairment on these tasks (for a discussion see Abramovitch, \nShort, & Schweiger, 2021 ). \n4.2. Correlations between misophonia symptoms and neuropsychological \noutcomes \nThe majority of correlations examined between misophonia symp -\ntoms and neuropsychological performance were not significant. The \nonly significant correlations were CPT Omission Errors (a computerized \nmeasure of sustained attention), which correlated with MQ-1 (number \nof types and severity of trigger sounds), MQ-2 (number of types and \nseverity of misophonic response), and MQ-Total, but not with MQ-3 \n(severity of sound sensitivity and associated impairment). In addition \nthe DS Forward (working memory), was negatively correlated with MQ- \n3 only. No significant correlations were found on these indices in the \ncontrol group. Notably, these results reflect cognitive functioning under \n‘cold ’ conditions, and not during symptom provocation. Thus, these \ncorrelations between misophonia severity and inattention found only in \nthe misophonia group correspond to recent brain imaging findings \nindicating that misophonia is associated with functional alteration of \nneural connectivity at rest (i.e., not only during misophonic provoca -\ntion). It has been argued that such alterations in functional connectivity \nmay be a consequence of repeated misophonic experience (for a review \nsee Neacsiu et al., 2022 ), and thus may explain why these associations \nare found under ‘cold ’ conditions. However, more research is needed to \nelucidate such alterations and their association with attentional func-\ntioning in misophonia, particularly under ‘cold ’ versus ‘hot cognition ’ \nconditions. \nIt is important to note, however, that these association were found \nonly between two neuropsychological outcomes and misophonia \nseverity. Given that psychopathology has generally been associated with \nreduced cognitive performance (Abramovitch et al., 2021 ), the general \nabsence of correlations between self-reported misophonia severity and \ncognitive performance may seem surprising. However, research directly \nassessing associations between disorder-specific self-report severity \nmeasures and neuropsychological test performance usually yields \nmodest associations at best (David, Zammit, Lewis, Dalman, & Allebeck, \n2008 ; McGrath et al., 2016 ; Woon, Farrer, Braman, Mabey, & Hedges, \n2017 ) and neuropsychological tests generally are considered poor pre-\ndictors of the presence of any psychopathology (e.g., Abramovitch, \nMcCormack, Brunner, Johnson, & Wofford, 2019 ). The modest nature of \nthe associations may stem from the suboptimal psychometric properties \nof the measures involved, particularly given the known problem with \necological validity in neuropsychological tests (Zivin & Katon, 2015 ). \nThe results of this study further indicate an absence of group dif-\nferences in the prevalence of comorbid DSM disorders. This is somewhat \nsurprising given previous reports suggesting that misophonia is associ -\nated with psychopathology (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2020 ; Potgieter \net al., 2019 ), particularly OCD/OCPD and ADHD (Rouw & Erfanian, \n2018 ; Taylor, 2017 ) although some studies have not found substantially \nhigher prevalence rates in misphonia samples (Jager, de Koning, Bost, \nDenys, & Vulink, 2020 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ). The lack of statistically \nsignificantly higher prevalence rates in the misophonia group may be \nattributable in part to the relatively small sample size (n 32), as the \nnumerical prevalence rates in the present study were indeed higher in Table 5 \nPearson ’s zero-order correlations between neuropsychological test performance \nand MQ subscores within the misophonia group .   \nMQ-1 MQ-2 MQ-3 MQ Total \nSet shifting \nTrail Making B 0.16 \u00000.09 \u00000.04 \u00000.02 \nWCST Preservative Errors 0.06 \u00000.15 \u00000.26 \u00000.26 \nWCST Categories Completed 0.25 0.26 0.24 0.17 \nPlanning \nTOL Excess Moves \u00000.09 \u00000.18 \u00000.17 \u00000.13 \nWorking Memory \nDS Forward Total 0.03 0.23 •0.42* 0.26 \nDS Backward Total 0.17 0.05 \u00000.09 0.12 \nDS Sequencing Total \u00000.06 0.18 \u00000.17 0.09 \nDS Total 0.06 0.19 \u00000.27 0.19 \nSymbol Span Total \u00000.03 \u00000.19 \u00000.07 \u00000.12 \nVerbal Fluency \nLetter Total \u00000.12 \u00000.06 \u00000.30 \u00000.10 \nCategory Total 0.25 0.03 0.07 0.17 \nResponse Inhibition \nCPT Commission Errors \u00000.03 0.05 \u00000.01 0.08 \nVerbal Memory \nCVLT Short Delay Recall 0.07 0.21 0.02 0.16 \nCVLT Sum of Trials 1–5 0.09 0.15 0.12 0.12 \nCVLT Long Delay Recall 0.13 0.19 0.10 0.15 \nNon-verbal Memory \nRCFT Immediate \u00000.36 0.01 0.07 \u00000.21 \nRCFT Delayed \u00000.29 0.10 0.06 \u00000.09 \nProcessing Speed \nTrail Making A 0.08 0.10 \u00000.02 \u00000.02 \nCPT Mean RT \u00000.07 0.02 \u00000.13 \u00000.01 \nAttention \nCPT Omission Errors 0.41* 0.42* 0.09 0.42* \nCPT RT SD 0.03 0.09 \u00000.11 0.15 \nVisuospatial function \nRCFT Copy \u00000.18 0.08 0.12 \u00000.6 \nNote. * significant correlation that survived multiplicity correction. \nWCSTWisconsin Card Sorting Test; TOL Tower of London; DSWAIS Digit \nSpan; CVLTCalifornia-Verbal Learning Test II; CPTConners ’ Continuous \nPerformance Test III; RCFT Rey Complex Figure Test; RT Reaction time; \nSDStandard Deviation. \nTable 6 \nPearson ’s zero-order correlations between clinical variables and the MQ \nsubscales.    \nMQ-1 MQ-2 MQ-3 MQ Total \nDASS-21 Depression Misophonia 0.10 0.13 \u00000.15 0.11 \nControl 0.23 0.18 \u00000.05 0.22 \nDASS-21 Anxiety Misophonia 0.02 \u00000.07 \u00000.04 \u00000.12 \nControl 0.04 0.13 \u00000.17 0.08 \nDASS-21 Stress Misophonia 0.17 0.04 \u00000.06 \u00000.06 \nControl 0.36* 0.23 \u00000.15 0.33* \nI-7 Impulsivity Misophonia 0.18 0.45* 0.45* 0.48* \nControl \u00000.05 0.19 0.02 0.09 \nSTAI-State Misophonia 0.15 0.03 \u00000.17 0.02 \nControl 0.19 0.05 \u00000.07 0.13 \nNote.

These \ninclude a high prevalence of ADHD in the misophonia group (16%), \nwhich is more than three times higher than the prevalence of ADHD in \nUS adults (4.6%; Song et al., 2021 ), and higher than the prevalence of \nADHD found in the control group (9%). Similarly, albeit not statistically \nsignificant, the prevalence of OCD was also elevated in the misophonia \ngroup (9%) compared to the control group (3%). This prevalence rate of \nOCD within the misophonia group is nearly 8-fold higher than the \nprevalence in the general population (1.3%; Fawcett, Power, & Fawcett, \n2020 ). The same pattern was found for panic disorder in the misophonia \nsample (6%), which was twice as high as the control group (3%). \nOverall, despite a lack of statistically significant differences in preva -\nlence rates between the misophonia and control groups, the misophonia \ngroup demonstrated numerically higher prevalence for conditions pre-\nviously reported as more common in misophonia. \nIn terms of clinical symptoms, there were no significant group dif-\nferences in depression and stress symptoms (albeit numerically, the ef-\nfect size for stress was d 0.41 favoring controls, p 0.06). However, \nthere were significantly elevated symptoms of general anxiety and state \nanxiety in the misophonia group compared to the control group, \nconsistent with previous studies (Guetta, Cassiello-Robbins, Anand, & \nRosenthal, 2022 ; Jager et al., 2020 ; Wu et al., 2014 ). Importantly, the \npresent study revealed higher levels of self-reported behavioral impul -\nsivity in the misophonia group compared to the control group. In \naddition, impulsivity was found to be significantly and positively \ncorrelated with the severity of misophonic behavioral response (MQ-2) \nand sound sensitivity (MQ-3), as well as with the MQ total score, but not \nwith the number of types or intensity of trigger sounds (MQ-1). This \nfinding supports research that suggests misophonia is related to \nemotional regulation and impulse control problems (Cassiello-Robbins \net al., 2020 ). This is particularly important as emerging research is now \nconsidering how emotional dysregulation may play an important part in \nmisophonia. Indeed, the role of ‘emotional impulsivity ’ (i.e., impulsive \nresponsivity to emotions) has been subject to recent interest in psy-\nchopathology research. Specifically, it has been suggested that \nemotional impulsivity may be important in our understanding of psy-\nchopathology and may be transdiagnostic (for a review, see Carver, \nJohnson, & Timpano, 2017 ). \n4.3. Functional impairments \nGreater self-reported impairments were observed in the misophonia \ngroup in the domains home-chores (household chores and mainte -\nnance), money-management (managing bills and debt), and driving \n(citations and accidents). In addition, the misophonia sample was found \nto have a significantly higher total mean impairment score as well a \nsignificantly higher percent of ‘impaired domains ’, defined as the \nnumber of items that received a score falling at or above the 93rd \npercentile divided by the total number of items scored. The results of this \ncomparison indicated that the proportion of impaired domains in the \nmisophonia sample was twice as high as controls. Interestingly, im-\npairments related to money-management and driving have been asso-\nciated with ADHD (Bangma et al., 2019 ; Vaa, 2014 ), which was a highly \nprevalent comorbidity in our misophonia sample. These results corre -\nspond to other studies that found that misophonia is associated with \nfunctional impairments across multiple domains (Guzick et al., 2023 ; \nJager et al., 2020 ; Remmert, Jebens, Gruzman, Gregory, & Vitoratou, \n2022 ; Rosenthal et al., 2022 ). Interestingly, a common domain of \nfunctional impairment in misophonia is associated with family life that \nhas been found both in adults (Rosenthal et al., 2022 ) and youth (Guzick \net al., 2023 ). The results of this study – although pointing to numerically \nelevated functional impairments in misophonia across domains – indi-\ncate that there was no significant difference between the misophonia \nand control samples on the ‘home-family ’ domains. However, a signifi -\ncant difference was found in the domains of ‘home-chores ’, and ‘money \nmanagement ’, which was found to have the largest effect size. This discrepancy with the results of previous studies may be related to the \nfact that the present study examined active college students with \nmisophonia, most of which do not live at home with their nuclear family \nand are required to function more independently. However, it is \nimportant to note that in the current study, review of BFIS test norms \nindicated that although the misophonia sample reported higher func-\ntional impairment scores on these domains, these scores did not reach \nthresholds for impaired functioning on any of the domains. Notably, our \nreview of the literature clearly indicates that there is a need for further \nresearch examining domain-specific functional impairment associated \nwith misophonia. \nThe present study has several strengths including being the first \nstudy to compare misophonia and control samples on a comprehensive \nneuropsychological battery, administration of a psychometrically valid \nsemi-structured diagnostic interview, assessment of everyday func-\ntioning, and employment of correction for multiplicity. However, this \nstudy is not without limitations. First, the misophonia group sample size \nwas relatively small, with a control/misophonia participant ratio being \n2:1. Second, caseness was determined using the MQ3 impairment scale \ncutoff which does not directly assess misophonia symptoms but rather \nimpairments resulting from sound sensitivity. However, in lieu of a \nformal categorical diagnostic algorithm, and given that used for this \ncutoff results in significant overall group differences on the MQ1 and \nMQ2, and to facilitate comparisons with previous research, we opted to \nuse the MQ3 cutoff. Another limitation of this study is that we did not \nassess or rule out hyperacusis which may be important for future studies. \nIn addition, there were two technical issues in this study. First, due to a \ntechnical error, only ten out of the fifteen BFIS items were administered. \nHowever, as per the BFIS manual (Barkley, 2011 ), each item is a \nstandalone domain with its own norms, and thus the present study was \nable to examine 10 functional domains – which, to our knowledge, is the \nfirst examination of real-life functional indices in misophonia. Addi-\ntionally, due to a technical error, raw data from the CPT-III test was \navailable only for a small subsample, however standard t scores pro-\nduced by the program were available for all participants and were used \nin the final analyses. Furthermore, this study sample comprised college \nstudents which may limit generalizability. Indeed, prior studies have \ndemonstrated that enrolled college students with or without psychopa -\nthology may exhibit somewhat better cognitive functioning (e.g., \nGuerra-Carrillo, Katovich, & Bunge, 2017 ; Twamley, Hami, & Stein, \n2004 ). This effect may reflect the influence of selection bias (e.g., stu-\ndents with psychopathology who are able to remain in college may have \ncharacteristics making them more cognitively “resilient ”), cognitively \nbeneficial effects of college (e.g., daily engagement in cognitively \nchallenging tasks; engaging with novel and abstract topics; engaging in \nplanning related to time management and meeting deadlines), or a \ncombination of the two. To the extent that active enrollment in college \nreduces the association between psychopathology and cognitive \ndysfunction, the current study may underestimate the degree of \nmisophonia-related cognitive underperformance in non-college student \npopulations. Nevertheless, it is important to note that control sample \nparticipants were not excluded if they met criteria for DSM disorders, \nand in fact, the rates of non-misophonia psychopathology did not differ \nsignificantly between the samples. Given that most neuropsychological \nstudies utilize control samples screened for psychopathology and \nneurological conditions, differences discovered in the present study may \nlend more credibility compared to a study with a highly screened control \nsample. However, this study is the first of its kind in misophonia, and \nmuch more neuropsychological research is needed in misophonia across \ndifferent samples, particularly in community and clinical samples. \n5.Conclusions \nThe goal of the present study was to conduct the first neuropsycho -\nlogical study of misophonia in the context of ‘cold ’ cognitive function. \nWe identified poorer verbal memory retrieval in misophonia but there A.

In addition, although \nthere was no difference in sustained attention measures between the \ngroups, there was a negative association between attention functions \nand misophonia symptoms only in the misophonia group. Furthermore, \nthe results of the present study support the role of behavioral/emotional \nimpulsivity in misophonia, which was related to the misophonic \nresponse and sound sensitivity but not with the extent and severity of the \nemotional reaction to trigger sounds. These findings are in line with \nrecent research. We also found elevated rates of OCD and ADHD in the \nmisophonia sample. However, since this is the first study of its kind, and \ngiven the dearth of research on ‘cold ’ cognitive function research in \nmisophonia, the results of this study should be viewed as preliminary \nand should be replicated in the various relevant samples (e.g., psychi -\natric samples, audiology samples).
