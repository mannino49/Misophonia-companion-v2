Several  studies  with   adults  \nyielded  prevalence  rates  between  6%  and  20%  in  various  (clinical)  samples,  but  the  representativeness  of  samples  was  largely  limited.   \nMore  than  80%  of  the  first  manifestation  of  symptoms  occurs  during  childhood  and  adolescence.  Regarding  comorbid  disorders,  studies  show   great  \nheterogeneity,  with  estimates  ranging  from  28–76%  of  comorbid  mental  disorders  and  approximately  25%  with  comorbid  physical  disor   ders.  The  \nexact  etiology  is  currently  not  well  studied.  Initial  neurophysiological  explanations  and  imaging  studies  point  to  a  specific  physiologi   cal  response  in  \nmisophonia  patients.  Although  many  case  reports  are  now  available,  and  diagnostic  criteria  and  measurement  tools  have  been   developed,  \nmisophonia  currently  does  not  represent  a  distinct  neurological,  audiological,  or  psychiatric  disorder  in  the  DSM-5  or  ICD-11.  Misophonia  in  Childhood  and  Adolescence:  A  Narrative  Review  Summary:  Misophonia  describes  a  phenomenon  in  which  affected  children  and  adolescents  show  a  strong  negative  physiological  and  emotional  \nreaction  when  confronted  with  specific  auditory  (misophonic)  stimuli  (most  commonly  eating  or  breathing  noises).  Individual  studies  with  adults  \nalready  provide  prevalences  between  6  and  20%  in  various  (clinical)  samples,  whereby  the  representativeness  of  the  samples  in  most  studies  was  \nonly  given  to  a  very  limited  extent.  However,  the  first  manifestation  of  the  symptoms  is  in  more  than  80%  of  cases  in  childhood  and  adolescence,  \nwhich  is  why  this  age  group  should  be  given  special  attention.  With  regard  to  comorbid  disorders,  there  is  also  great  heterogeneity  with  estimates  of  \nbetween  28%  and  76%  for  comorbid  mental  disorders  and  around  25%  for  comorbid  physical  illnesses.  The  exact  etiology  has  not  yet  been  \nsufficiently  investigated.  First  neurophysiological  explanations  and  imaging  studies  point  to  a  specific  physiological  reaction  in  misophonia  patients.  \nAlthough  there  are  now  a  large  number  of  case  reports,  diagnostic  criteria  and  measuring  instruments  have  been  developed  and  the  first  cognitive-\nbehavioral  treatment  approaches  have  been  evaluated,  misophonia  still  does  not  represent  an  independent  neurological,  audiological  or  psychiatric  \ndisorder  in  the  DSM-5  or  the  ICD-11.\nKeywords:  misophonia,  review,  children,  adolescents,  diagnosis  and  treatment  \n©  2022  The  Author(s)  Distributed  as  \na   Hogrefe  OpenMind  article  under  the  \nlicense   CC  BY-NC  4.0  (https://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by-nc/4.0)  review  paper\n,Misophonia  in  children  \nand  adolescents:\nJournal  of  Child  and  Adolescent  Psychiatry  and  Psychotherapy  (2022),  1–\n11  https:// doi.org/ 10.1024/1422-4917/ a000885A  narrative  review\nbackgroundElisa  Pfeiffer   Marc  Allroggen  and  Cedric  Sachser\nfound  in  the  diagnosis  and  care  of  mentally  ill  children  \nand  adolescents  (Claiborn,  Dozier,  Hart  &  Lee,  2020).  \nThe  aim  of  this  review  article  is  therefore  to  create  an  \noverview  of  the  symptoms,  course  and  treatment  \noptions  on  the  basis  of  a  selective  literature  search  in  \norder  to  sensitize  specialists  to  the  disorder.  In  \naddition  to  the  psychiatric  perspective,  misophonia  \nhas  received  attention  in  a  large  number  of  related  \ninterdisciplinary  research  areas,  which  has  led  to  an  \ninterdisciplinary  conceptualization  of  the  disorder  in  \nthe  literature.

The  \nselection  of  the  articles  included  in  this  review  \nfollowed  a  narrative  character,  so  that  the  final  \nselection  of  the  articles  considered  was  subjective  \nand  unsystematic.The  studies  for  this  review  were  identified  through  \na  systematic  literature  search  in  the  online  database  \nPubMed  using  the  search  terms/keywords  \n“misophonia”  or  “misophonia” (title  and  abstract).  \nThe  Su.  last  repeated  on  October  1st,  2021\nJournal  of  Child  and  Adolescent  Psychiatry  and  Psychotherapy  (2022),  1–112   E.

In  contrast  to  hyperacusis,  the  triggering  \nsounds  were  variable  in  this  subgroup  of  patients.\nWith  regard  to  stimuli  typical  of  misophonia,  the  \nauthors  were  able  to  show  in  a  current  study  that  almost  \nall  misophonia  patients  reported  eating  sounds  (96%)  \nand  nasal  or  breathing  sounds  (85%)  as  misophonic  \nstimuli,  which  is  why  these  special  sounds  were  included  \nin  the  criteria.  In  their  sample,  78%  of  patients  also  \nreported  nonauditory  stimuli  as  misophonic  triggers,  but  \nauditory  stimuli  are  categorized  as  primary  triggers.The  stimuli  perceived  as  aversive,  which  are  also  \ncalled  “triggers”  or  “misophonia  sounds”,  include  eating  \nsounds  (e.g.  swallowing,  chewing,  biting  into  an  apple),  \nnasal/breathing  sounds,  mouth  and  throat  sounds,  \nknocking  sounds,  rustling ,  room  noises  (e.g.  telephone  \nringing)  or  repetitive  movements  (e.g.  scratching;  \noverview:  Jager  et  al.,  2020;  Siepsiak  &  Dragan,  2019).  \nThe  ensuing  automatic  emotional  response  (also  called  \nthe  “misophonia  response”  or  “misophonic  response”)  \ncan  manifest  itself  in  a  variety  of  feelings,  such  as  anger,  \nrage,  fear,  and  disgust,  or  at  the  behavioral  level,  in  the  \nform  of  avoidance  and  a  desire  to  to  escape  the  situation  \n(fight-flight  response;  Brout  et  al.,  2018;  Wu,  Lewin,  \nMurphy  &  Storch,  2014).  In  a  current  Dutch  study  with  N  \n=  575  misophonia  patients  (mixed  children,  adolescents  \nand  adults),  the  authors  were  able  to  show  that  93.8%  \nirritability,  89.5%  anger,  64%  disgust  and  13.6%  other  \nemotional  reactions  (e.g.  sadness  or  loss  of  control )  \nexperience  (Jager  et  al.,  2020).  AboutIn  a  survey  in  the  USA,  97.1%  also  reported  physiological  \nreactions  in  the  body  and  face  (e.g.\ndifferent.  Initial  studies  have  shown  that  the  context  of  \nthe  sound  plays  an  important  role  in  how  aversive  that  \nsound  is  perceived.  For  example,  noises  from  close  \npeople  are  considered\nEarly  studies  of  the  phenomenology  of  the  disorder  \nincluded  only  case  studies  or  case  series  from  Awakemuscle  tension)  associated  with  anger  and  anxiety  (86%)  \nand  manifested  by  muscular  tension  (82.8%)  or  teeth  \ngrinding/clenching  (63.9%)  (Claiborn  et  al.,  2020).  The  \nsound  pattern  and  the  triggering  reaction  are  very  \nunpleasant  for  those  affected\nAlthough  initial  studies  have  already  attempted  to  \ncharacterize  the  clinical  picture  of  the  disorder  in  terms  \nof  diagnostic  criteria  and  the  level  of  suffering  of  those  affectedperceived  as  more  aversive.  On  the  contrary,  sounds  \nare  perceived  as  less  aversive  by  young  children,  adults  \nwith  intellectual  disabilities  and  elderly  people  with  \ndementia  (Dozier,  2015a).  For  individuals  affected,  \nmisophonia  can  be  associated  with  significant  \npsychoemotional  and  social  stress,  a  reduction  in  \nfunctional  level  and  quality  of  life.\nIt  should  be  noted  that  misophonia  has  not  been  \nrecognized  as  a  neurological,  audiological,  or  psychiatric  \ndisorder  to  date.  In  addition,  the  disorder  cannot  be  \nclassified  and  diagnosed  as  an  independent  disorder  \nusing  the  current  classification  systems.  A  detailed  \noverview  of  the  differentiation  of  psychiatric  disorders  can  \nbe  found  in  Schröder,  Vulink  and  Denys  (2013).  A  working  \ngroup  led  by  Arjan  Schröder  published  a  first  proposal  for  \npossible  diagnostic  criteria  in  2013  (Schröder  et  al.,  \n2013),  followed  by  those  of  Thomas  Doziers'  working  \ngroup  in  2017  (Dozier  &  Morrison,  2017;  German  overview  \nin  Spitczok,  by  Brinsinski,  Semmler,  Schüller  &  Heiden  \nrich,  2019).  The  criteria  according  to  Schröder  were  \nrevised  by  the  Jager  working  group  in  2020  on  the  basis  \nof  new  findings  and  are  therefore  the  most  up-to-date  \ncriteria  (see  presentation  of  the  criteria  in  Table  1).  All  \nconceptualisations  of  the  diagnostic  criteria  are  largely  \nbased  on  studies  with  young  adults.The  syndrome  misophonia  was  first  conceptualized  in  \nthe  scientific  literature  (Jastreboff  &  Jastreboff,  2001)  by  \nthe  Americans  Margaret  and  Pawel  Jastreboff,  who  are  \nknown  for  their  research  in  the  field  of  tinnitus  (Jastreboff,  \n1990).  The  authors  describe  neurological  similarities  to  \nthe  disorders  hyperacusis  (extreme  sensitivity  to  loud  \nnoises,  occurs  e.g.  in  small  children)  and  phonophobia  \n(phobic  fear  of  noises).\nThose  who  reported  sensitivity  to  a  variety  of  sounds  \n(made  by  people  or  objects)  (e.g.,\nhttps://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/pdf/10.1024/1422-4917/a000885  -  Monday,  November  28,  2022  8:41:44  AM  -  IP  Address:73.164.63.26   Machine Translated by Google"

In  addition  to  recording  \nthe  comorbid  psychiatric  diagnoses  per  se,  the  question  \narises,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  treatment  of  children  and  \nadolescents  with  misophonia,  as  to  whether  the  comorbid  \ndisorders  in  the  context  of  a  disorder  development  and  \nmaintenance  model  also  determine  the  misophonic  symptoms  \nand  possibly  even  cause  them  for  misophonia  (e.g.  trauThere  are  currently  only  a  few  representative  studies  on  thenoises  associated  with  it  that  can  trigger  PTSD  symptoms)  or  \nare  also  a  consequence  of  misophonia  (e.g.  depressive  mood  \ndue  to  withdrawal  and  rejection  by  others).  A  case  study  with  \ntic  patients  in  childhood  and  adolescence  who  describe  \nsymptoms  of  misophonia  (N  =  12)  already  provides  the  first  \nindications  that  the  disorders  may  be  closely  linked  (both  as  a  \ntrigger  and  as  a  reaction;  Robinson,  Hedderly ,  Conte,  Malik  \n&  Cardona,  2018).  There  are  similar  findings  in  children  and  \nadolescents  in  the  area  of  obsessive-compulsive  disorders  \n(Webber,  Johnson  &  Storc,  2014),  whereby  the  patient  \ndescribed  in  this  publication  had  a  tic  disorder  in  addition  to  \nan  obsessive-compulsive  disorder,  which  is  why  no  concrete  \nstatements  on  the  connection  have  yet  been  made  for  children  \nOCD  and  misophonia  symptoms  can  be  affected  independently  \nof  other  disorders.\nand  adolescents  and  pointed  out  that  this  population  is  \nparticularly  affected,  no  study  has  so  far  examined  comorbidity  \nexclusively  in  children  and  adolescents.

In  addition,  \na  study  showed  that  people  with  misophonia  showed  a  \nreduction  in  the  N1  wave  when  recording  event-related  \npotentials  compared  to  healthy  controls  with  \ncircumscribed  auditory  signals  (Schröder  et  al.,  2014).\nth  reaction.

Two  studies,  one  from  the  Netherlands  (33%;  \nJager  et  al.,  2020)  and  one  from  the  USA  (55%;  Rouw  &  \nErfanian,  2018),  report  a  family  history  of  misophonia  in  at  \nleast  one  in  three  sufferers.  A  possible  genetic  component  or  \nintra-familial  model  learning  as  a  cause  of\nmisophonia  should  be  examined  more  closely  in  the  future  in  \norder  to  better  understand  the  overall  etiology  of  the  disorder\nto  understand.\nJournal  of  Child  and  Adolescent  Psychiatry  and  Psychotherapy  (2022),  1–11Of  particular  note  is  a  representative  study  on  a  \nhousehold  sample  in  Turkey,  in  which  N  =  541  people  \nolder  than  15  years  were  interviewed  about  misophonia  \nsymptoms  (Kiliç,  Öz,  Avanoÿlu  &  Aksoy,  2021).

Another  study  with  students  in  Great  Britain  found\nSo  far,  there  are  only  a  few  studies  that  have  dealt  with  \npossible  neurophysiological  correlates  and  causes  of  \nmisophonia  (Brout  et  al.,  2018).There  are  studies  among  patients  with  tinnitus  that  \nassume  a  prevalence  of  misophonia  of  10  to  60%  \n(Hadjipavlou,  Baer,  Lau  &  Howard,  2008;  Sztuka,  Pospi  \nech,  Gawron  &  Dudek,  2010).  Both  the  Wu  et  al.  (2014)  \nand  the  study  by  Zhou,  Wu,  &  Storch  (2017)  showed  \nthat  anxiety  symptoms  mediated  the  relationship  \nbetween  misophonia  and  outbursts  of  anger.\nIn  recent  years,  some  functional  imaging  studies  have  \nalso  been  conducted  with  misophonia  patients  (Giorgi,  \n2015;  Kumar  et  al.,  2017;  Schröder,  San  Giorgi,  van  \nWingen,  Vulink  &  Denys,  2015;  Schröder  et  al.,  2019).  \nWhen  misophonic  stimuli  are  presented,  the  findings  \npredominantly  show  an  increased  activation  in  the  \nauditory  cortex  as  well  as  the  amygdala  and  otherThe  studies  available  to  date  must  also  be  interpreted  \nwith  caution,  since  in  some  cases  different  diagnostic  \ncriteria  for  misophonia  were  used,  e.g.  In  some  cases,  \nthe  study  populations  were  very  different  and  only  very  \nsmall  numbers  of  cases  were  considered  (Palumbo,  \nAlsalman,  De  Ridder,  Song  &  Vanneste,  2018).a  significantly  higher  prevalence:  A  total  of  49.1%  \nreported  misophonic  symptoms  (37%  mild  symptoms,  \n12%  moderate  symptoms,  0.3%  severe  symptoms;  N  =  \n336  participants;  Naylor,  Caimino,  Scutt,  Hoare  &  \nBaguley,  2021).

      "text": "Based  on  these  findings,  it  is  speculated  that  the  \nstress  response  associated  with  the  perception  of  \nmisophonic  stimuli  is  based  less  on  an  enhanced  \nperception  of  the  stimulus  itself,  as  in  hyperacusis,  \nand  more  on  impaired  affective  evaluation  and  \nsalience  to  the  specific  stimulus  (Palumbo  et  al.,  \n2018).  However,  a  recent  study  did  not  find  any  \ndifferences  in  the  activation  of  the  auditory  cortex  in  \nmisophonia  patients  compared  to  healthy  controls,  \nbut  rather  a  stronger  activation  in  areas  associated  \nwith  orofacial  movements.  These  findings  are  linked  \nto  previous  clinical  findings  showing  that  the  noise  \nof  eating  in  particular  is  perceived  as  unpleasant,  so  \nthat  it  is  discussed  whether  increased  activation  of  \nmotor  neurons  could  play  a  role  in  the  development  \nof  misophonia  (Kumar  et  al.,  2021). .  Findings  on  \nstructural  changes  in  the  white  matter  also  indicate  \nthat  the  impaired  visual  perception  of  facial  \nexpressions  could  have  a  possible  role  in  the  \ndevelopment  of  misophonia  symptoms  (Eijsker,  \nSchröder,  Liebrand,  Smit,  van  Wingen  &  Denys,  \n2021).Current  studies  on  the  treatment  of  misophonia  \nmostly  only  include  uncontrolled  case  studies/case  \nseries  (Bernstein,  Angell  &  Dehle,  2013;  Dozier,  \n2015a;  Haq,  Al  resheed  &  Tu,  2020;  McGuire  et  al.,  \n2015;  Potgieter  et  al.,  2019;  Reid,  Guzick,  Gernand  \n&  Olsen,  2016),  which  is  why  no  specific  treatment  \nrecommendations  can  yet  be  made.  The  treatment  \napproaches  known  to  date  are  briefly  presented  below.\nIn  the  following,  all  currently  available  instruments  \nfor  assessing  misophonia  in  children  and  adults  are  \npresented  (see  Table  2).  The  sub-item  \"Target  \ngroup\"  shows  whether  the  inventory  can  also  be  \nused  with  children  and  young  people.  There  is  \ncurrently  no  instrument  specifically  designed  for  \nchildren  and  young  people.\nAccording  to  the  study  by  Claiborn  et  al.  (2020),  \nonly  24.7%  of  those  affected  report  having  sought  \ntreatment  because  of  their  symptoms.  A  bigpart  reports  little  or  no  improvement  in  symptoms  as  \na  result  of  treatment.  Counseling  or  talk  therapy  was  \nused  most  frequently  (13.7%),  followed  by  treatment  \nthrough  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  (8.2%).  \nHowever,  the  treatment  spectrum  covered  a  very  \nwide  range  from  hypnosis  (2.9%)  to  pharmacotherapy  \n(2.8%).  Talk  therapy  was  associated  negatively  (b  =  \n0.93;  p  <  .001)  and  psychopharmacotherapy  \npositively  (b  =  -1.39;  p  <  .001)  with  symptom  \nreduction.  Outside  of  regular  treatment,  the  most  \ncommon  coping  strategies  used  by  patients  with  \nmisophonic  symptoms  include  listening  to  music  \n(99%),  avoiding/leaving  the  situation  (99%),  or  \nmaking  noise  themselves  (86–77%;  Jager  et  al.,  \n2020).range  of  the  limbic  system  (Eijsker,  Schröder,  Smit,  \nvan  Wingen  &  Denys,  2021;  Giorgi,  2015;  Schröder  \net  al.,  2015;  Schröder  et  al.,  2019).  The  study  by  \nKumar  et  al.  (2017)  also  found  increased  activation  \nin  the  area  of  the  anterior  insular  cortex  (AIC),  an  \narea  associated  with  directed  attention  to  stimuli  \n(salience),  when  misophonic  triggers  were  presented.  \nIn  addition,  there  was  impaired  connectivity  of  the  \nAIC  with  medial  frontal,  medial  parietal  and  temporal  \nregions.\nFirst  studies  on  confrontation  therapies  with  \nmisophonia  patients  were  able  to  show  that  \nexposure  to  misophonia  noises  did  not  lead  to  \ndirect  habituation  (Frank  &  McKay,  2019),  which  \nis  why  the  authors  adapted  their  treatment  model  \nand  included  an  inhibitory  learning  model  in  the  \ntreatment.  After  further  individual  case  studies  in  \nwhich  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  appeared  to  \nbe  promising  (Bernstein  et  al.,  2013;  Dozier,  \n2015a,  2015b;  McGuire  et  al.,  2015;  Reid  et  al.,  \n2016),  a  first  uncontrolled  quasi-experimental  \nstudy  on  the  effectiveness  of  cognitive  behavioral  \ntherapy  (eight  2-week  sessions  with  concentration  \nexercises,  counterconditioning,  stimulus  \nmanipulation,  relaxation  exercises)  with  N  =  90  \npatients  (28%  male,  Mage  =  35.8;  SD  =  12.2)  first  \nevidence  of  a  symptom  reduction  through  the  \ntreatment  was  found  den  (Schröder  et  al.,  2017).  \nA  first  randomized  controlled  study  on  behavioral  \ntherapy  for  misophonia  was  carried  out  in  \nAmsterdam  in  an  outpatient  setting  with  N  =  71  \nadult  patients  (70.4%  female,  Mage  =  33.06;  SD  \n=  14.13)  (Jager,  Vulink,  Bergfeld,  van  Loon  &  \nDenys,  2021) .
