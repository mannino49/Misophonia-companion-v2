Bush declared the 1990s to be the ‘Decade of the \nBrain’. The following years saw major advances in neuroscience as a discipline – most notably in \nthe establishment of fMRI as a standard methodological instrument – and an explosion in the vol -\nume of neuroscientific research published. As the field has progressed, the subjects it tackles have \nbecome increasingly complex, with particular acceleration of research with potential social and \npolicy implications (Illes et al., 2003). Subject matters traditionally assigned to the humanities and \nsocial sciences – such as religion, love, art, crime and politics – now make frequent appearances in \nneuroscience journals (Frazzetto and Anker, 2009; Littlefield and Johnson, 2012).

Neuroscience has been appropriated by many \ndiverse fields that see it as relevant to their own interests, including law (Walsh, 2011), marketing \n(Chancellor and Chatterjee, 2011), public policy (Seymour and Vlaev, 2012), education (Ansari \net al., 2012), parenting (O’Connor and Joffe, 2012) and economics (Schüll and Zaloom, 2011).\nFor social scientists, the increasing prominence of neuroscience provokes important questions \nabout how members of the public engage with this new knowledge. This issue is often framed in \n‘deficit model’ (Wynne, 1993) terms, placing priority on evaluating the accuracy of public under -\nstandings of neuroscience (Herculano-Houzel, 2002; Pasquinelli, 2012; Sperduti et al., 2012). \nWhether a conception is scientifically correct or incorrect is, however, largely irrelevant to its \nsubstantive effect on people’s thinking about themselves, others and society. The most important \nconsideration in gauging neuroscience’s societal influence is not lay ideas’ correspondence with \nestablished scientific ‘facts’, but the meaning attached to neuroscientific ideas in personal and \nsocial life. Since the brain is regarded as the organ most closely related to mind and behaviour, \nsome have speculated that the proliferation of neuroscientific knowledge has produced a shift in \neveryday conceptions of personhood or ‘folk psychology’ (Goldman, 1993; Sousa, 2006). Given \nthe significance of folk psychological understandings in guiding everyday behaviour, perception \nand social interaction, examining neuroscience’s influence on commonsense conceptions of per -\nsonhood is arguably a more pressing task than establishing whether public understandings of the \nbrain are scientifically correct.\nWithin discussions of neuroscience’s societal significance, it is commonplace to encounter claims \nthat neuroscience is producing revolutionary changes in understandings of individuals and society. \nFor example, Lynch (2009) claims that neuroscientific knowledge is ‘propelling humanity toward a \nradical reshaping of our lives, families, societies, cultures, governments, economies, art, leisure, reli -\ngion – absolutely everything that’s pivotal to humankind’s existence’ (2009: 7). Similar sentiments, \nthough less dramatically presented, are in evidence throughout the academic literature that reflects on \nneuroscience’s position in contemporary society. For example, Illes and Racine (2005) state that \nneuroscientific insights ‘will fundamentally alter the dynamic between personal identity, responsibil -\nity and free will’ (2005: 14); Farah (2012) asserts that ‘neuroimaging has contributed to a fundamen -\ntal change in how we think of ourselves and our fellow persons’ (2012: 575); and Abi-Rached (2008) \nspeaks of ‘this “neuro-age”’, whereby human behaviour and the other aspects that define us as a \nspecies are predominantly formulated in neurochemical terms’ (2008: 1162).\nSuch claims clash with established models of public engagement with science, which cast doubt \non the notion that new scientific knowledge, within a relatively narrow time-span, provokes revo -\nlutionary changes in public thinking. Social representations theory, one key paradigm for theoriz -\ning lay uptake of science, posits that the primary psychological task upon encountering new \nscientific information is ‘to make the unaccustomed familiar’ (Moscovici, 2008[1961]: 17) – that \nis, to transfer ‘strange’ new ideas into a conceptual register with which one is familiar and therefore \ncomfortable. This is achieved by ‘anchoring’ the new idea within established cultural categories \nand ‘objectifying’ it with familiar symbols, images and metaphors. While different models of pub -\nlic engagement with science employ different analytical tools, research from a variety of theoreti -\ncal standpoints converges on the conclusion that people selectively attend to and interpret science \nin ways that cohere with their pre-existing values, identities and beliefs (Joffe and Haarhoff, 2002; \nKahan et al., 2011; Morton et al., 2006; Munro, 2010; Wynne, 1993). New scientific information \ncan indeed challenge and modulate existing understandings; however, it can also assimilate into \nand reinforce established ideas. It is therefore not self-evident that neuroscience will substantively \nalter understandings of personhood in predictable directions. Delineating the influences neurosci -\nence exerts on contemporary society requires careful empirical research."

      "text": "256 Public Understanding of Science  22(3)\nA body of research examining the role played by neuroscience in everyday conceptions of per -\nsonhood has recently amassed. However – perhaps because it traverses several disciplines, meth -\nodological approaches and fields of interest – it has thus far maintained a relatively low profile. It \nis often unacknowledged in scholarly or intellectual discussions about the cultural significance of \nneuroscience, with the result that such discussions remain largely speculative and polemical. \nThe purpose of this article is to collate and review this empirical evidence concerning the \ninfluence of neuroscience on commonsense understandings of personhood. After probing the \nprominence of neuroscience in public consciousness, the article proceeds to examine the empirical \nevidence for three frequently encountered claims about neuroscience’s societal influence: that \nneuroscience fosters conceptions of the self that are dominated by biology, that neuroscience \npromotes conceptions of individual fate as predetermined, and that neuroscience abates the stigma \nattached to certain social categories.1\nHow prominent is neuroscience in public consciousness?\nWith neuroscience’s prominence in popular media escalating, several studies have undertaken to \nsystematically examine the characteristics of media coverage of neuroscience. A recent analysis \nshows that references to neuroscience in UK newspapers increased sharply between 2000 and 2010, \nmost often manifesting within advice on ‘optimizing’ brain function, demonstration of biological \nbases for intergroup differences, and recruitment of neuroscience’s scientific authority to ‘prove’ \narguments or assertions (O’Connor et al., 2012). Regarding neuroscience’s practical applications, \nO’Connell et al. (2011) establish that the media show particular interest in applications involving lie-\ndetection, marketing and public policy. Racine, Waldman, Rosenberg and Illes’ (2010) analysis iden -\ntifies three key trends in media coverage of neurotechnologies (e.g. fMRI, EEG, PET): neuro-realism , \nwhich refers to the use of neuroscientific information to make phenomena seem objective or ‘real’; \nneuro-essentialism , which connotes representations of the brain as the essence of a person; and neuro-\npolicy , which captures the deployment of brain research to support political agendas. Research also \nindicates a strong visual dimension to media coverage, with media text frequently accompanied \nby brain images produced by functional neuroimaging technologies (Dumit, 2004; Gibbons, 2007). \nThe highly-mediated, technological nature of this image production is often obscured, such that \nthe images may resemble direct photographs of neural activity (Beck, 2010; Roskies, 2007). \nThese images may therefore afford a ‘truth value’ to the arguments proffered in media text.\nThe social significance of neuroscience’s expanding media presence is intensified by experi -\nmental evidence suggesting that neuroscientific information may wield particular rhetorical force. \nWeisberg et al. (2008) show that explanations of psychological phenomena that include logically \nirrelevant neuroscience information are judged more satisfying than the same explanations pre -\nsented without the neuroscience information. Similarly, McCabe and Castel (2008) document how \narticles summarizing cognitive neuroscience research appear more credible when accompanied by \na redundant image of a brain scan than by a bar graph or no visual information. Three-dimensional \nbrain images are particularly persuasive (Keehner et al., 2011). These experiments suggest that the \nsymbols of brain research confer legitimacy on the arguments they accompany. However, it should \nbe noted that these experiments required participants to evaluate fictitious scientific articles, which \nmay not be a highly ecologically valid task. A more recent study focusing on evaluations of popular \nnews articles reports that inclusion of fMRI images does not enhance an article’s persuasiveness \nrelative to articles accompanied by other, or no, imagery (Gruber and Dickerson, 2012).\nResearch thus indicates that neuroscience is widely reported in the mainstream media and is \nconvincing in certain experimental contexts. However, this does not guarantee that it has"

Evidence shows that there can be considerable \ndivergence between media and mental representations of a scientific issue (Ten Eyck, 2005). \nPeople exposed to media information may ignore it, quickly forget it, or interpret and deploy it in \nidiosyncratic ways. Unfortunately, little research exists interrogating neuroscience’s prominence in \nthe minds of the lay public. One exception is Wardlaw et al.’s (2011) survey of perceptions of neu -\nroimaging applications, in which 17% of respondents report having ‘no awareness’ of neuroimag -\ning applications, 47% rate themselves as ‘a little aware’, 26% as ‘quite aware’ and 10% as ‘very \naware’. These figures do not suggest extensive familiarity with neuroscience, and the level of \npublic awareness they indicate may be inflated by the study’s recruitment strategies, which included \nadvertising the survey on science blogs.\nSome insight into neuroscience’s position in public consciousness can be derived from Rodriguez’s \n(2006) semantic analysis of usage of neuroscience-related terms in everyday speech. This analysis \nshows that neuro-vocabulary frequently materializes in vernacular language (e.g. ‘she is brainy’), \nsuggesting that neurobiology occupies a space in the conceptual schemata that underpin people’s \neveryday talk. As Rodriguez (2006) acknowledges, however, the study provides limited insight into \nthe breadth of this space or the meanings that speakers have in mind when they use ‘brain’ terms.\nIn summary, empirical research has established that neuroscience is increasingly visible in the \npopular press. However, little direct research with members of the public casts light on either the \nextent to which brain-related ideas are spontaneously recruited in naturalistic thought and conver -\nsation, or the meanings that these ideas carry for people.\nDoes neuroscience foster a conception of the self that is based \nin biology?\nMany commentaries on the societal significance of neuroscience have framed the issue within the \nhistorical battle between materialist and dualist theories of the person, that is whether what we call \n‘mind’ is fundamentally physical matter or exists separately from the body on some non-physical \nplane. Neuroscientific advances have been hailed as the force that will drive dualism from society, \nushering in conceptions of self, emotion and behaviour that are entirely rooted in biochemical \nprocesses (Churchland, 1995; Churchland, 2008; Crick, 1995). Sociological writings suggest that \nthe assimilation of biological information into conceptions of self and identity is already in motion, \na position exemplified by terms such as ‘neurochemical self’ (Rose, 2007), ‘cerebral subject’ \n(Ortega, 2009) and ‘brainhood’ (Vidal, 2009).\nThe suggestion that understandings of the self are becoming progressively materialized has, \nhowever, met with limited empirical support. In an analysis of focus groups composed of indi -\nviduals with varying degrees of involvement with brain research (e.g. neuroscientists, patients, \nteachers), Pickersgill et al. (2011) report that participants professed an interest in the brain, but \nrarely directly attributed behaviour entirely to brain processes. Some participants actively \nresisted neuroscientific ideas, perceiving them as threatening their established conceptions of \nmind and self – for example, undermining the importance of family and socialization in devel -\nopment. This sense of threat was not universal, however, with others experiencing neuroscience \nas simply irrelevant to their self-perception. Choudhury, McKinney and Merten (2012) describe \nsimilar results from a study of how adolescents engage with the idea of the ‘teenage brain’: \nwhile teenagers stated that knowledge about the neuroscience of adolescence was important, \nthey also rejected it as boring or irrelevant to their own self-understanding. Mirroring Pickersgill \net al.’s (2011) findings, behaviour was rarely understood in purely biological terms, but rather \nseen as a product of relationships with parents, teachers and society more generally."

      "text": "258 Public Understanding of Science  22(3)\nResearch with clinical populations indicates a greater penetration of brain-based ideas into self-\nunderstanding. In Illes et al.’s (2008) survey of 72 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder, \n92% reported that they would want a brain scan to diagnose depression if possible, while 76% \nbelieved that brain scans would improve their understanding of their mental state. Buchman et al.’s \n(2013) interviews with 12 individuals diagnosed with mood disorder revealed that participants very \ndecisively endorsed the ‘chemical imbalance’ explanation of depression. Qualitative analysis indi -\ncated that much of brain-based explanations’ appeal derived from their apparent ability to provide an \nobjective, morally neutral tool to legitimize people’s experience. Dumit (2003) and Cohn (2004) \nsuggest that the visual element of brain scans is a particularly potent legitimizing resource, allowing \nfor the objectification of ‘depression’ or ‘schizophrenia’ as material entities rather than nebulous \ndiagnostic categories. This ‘proving’ quality of neurobiological information can be mobilized in \nefforts to sustain a positive identity. Fein (2011), Rapp (2011) and Singh (2011), for example, observe \nthat individuals with developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (and their families) \ncan adopt neuroscientific language to represent themselves as subject to unique, ‘hard-wired’ chal -\nlenges and abilities. Such identity-protective positioning of neurobiological information also charac -\nterizes the burgeoning ‘neurodiversity movement’. This campaign, spearheaded by the autism \ncommunity, represents developmental disorders as simply alternative biological ways of being that \nare equally legitimate as ‘neurotypicality’ (Vidal, 2009). Thus, for people diagnosed with particular \npsychiatric conditions, neurobiological explanations of their thoughts and feelings are sometimes \npsychologically and socially functional, with their endorsement serving identity-supportive ends.\nThe divergent findings of research with clinical and non-clinical populations suggest that the \nbrain’s prominence in self-understanding is largely contingent on whether a person has been pro -\nvoked to consider their ‘brainhood’ by extrinsic events such as diagnosis and medication. The brain \nmay not intrude spontaneously in day-to-day consciousness, but rather becomes salient when \nsomething goes wrong (Pickersgill et al., 2011). However, even this experience-contingent salience \nis equivocal: neuroscientific explanations of disorder can be hotly contested (Martin, 2010) and \nrarely represent the exclusive explanatory mode deployed in conceptualizing the disorder. When \nneuroscientific ideas are accepted it is usually in partial and contingent ways, operating alongside \nalternative – sometimes contradictory – means of understanding experience. Bröer and Heerings \n(2013), for instance, employ a Q-sort methodology to establish that the disorder-understandings of \nadults with ADHD comprise a matrix of psychological, sociological and holistic concepts that exist \nalongside, and interact with, neurological conceptualizations. Gross’s (2011) ethnography of a \nneuro-oncology unit further indicates the multi-dimensionality of disorder meanings, finding that \nbrain tumour patients’ self-conceptions are split into two elements: one that is based in, and another \nthat is completely separate from, the brain. A form of Cartesian dualism allows these patients to \nconceive of the tumour not as an illness of the self but as the disease of ‘just another organ’.\nThus, even when biological explanations of thought, emotion or behaviour are accepted, they do \nnot drive out non-biological explanations. Assertions that neuroscientific advances will inevitably \npurge society of dualistic understandings of personhood flounder because they fail to acknowledge \nthe complexity and multi-dimensionality of self-conception.\nDoes neuroscience promote conceptions of individual fate as \npredetermined?\nNeuroscience has also been marshalled in the long-standing philosophical battle between concep -\ntions of the person as a free agent with independent volition and as a being whose character, behav -\niour and life-course are pre-patterned by their biological constitution.

This debate can \nextend beyond questioning whether free will exists in an ontologically ‘real’ sense (an issue outside \nthe scope of the present article) to encompass clear predictions about neuroscience’s influence on \ncommonsense beliefs about free will. For example, Green and Cohen (2004) assert that ‘the net \neffect of this influx of scientific information will be a rejection of free will as it is ordinarily con -\nceived’ (2004: 1776), celebrating this as a socially progressive prospect. It is important to note that \nsuch postulations are not universal: many scientists caution against premature over-extrapolation \nof empirical results (Lavazza and De Caro, 2010; Rose, 2005; Roskies, 2006) and the potentially \ntroubling societal repercussions of rejecting free will (Baumeister, Masicampo and DeWall, 2009; \nV ohs and Schooler, 2008). In addition, recent findings regarding the brain’s ‘plasticity’ or capacity \nfor change have been interpreted as evidence against  biological determinism. This will be dis -\ncussed shortly; first, however, the article assesses the empirical evidence for the contention – still \nmooted from certain quarters (e.g. Churchland, 1995; Economist, 2006; Farah, 2012; Harris, 2012) \n– that the popularization of neuroscience will transform conventional understandings of free will.\nOne of the key social arenas in which the free will issue plays out is within attribution of respon -\nsibility for behaviour. Legal and moral codes, along with daily interpersonal interaction, hinge on \nthe conviction that individuals have control over, and hence responsibility for, their actions. Some \nhave suggested that viewing behaviour as biologically determined fundamentally undermines the \nconcept of personal responsibility. However, research shows that people confronted with behav -\niour that is framed as neurologically caused continue to interpret it through the lens of individual \nresponsibility (De Brigard et al., 2009). Laypeople do not necessarily see moral responsibility and \nbiological determination as incompatible, and are willing to attribute responsibility to an individual \neven when clear that (s)he did not intend their actions (Nahmias, 2006). Attribution of responsibil -\nity for unintended acts is particularly likely if they produce destructive outcomes or are morally \n‘bad’ (Alicke, 2008). This implies that the movement of neuroscientific evidence into criminal \ndefence cases will not radically transform jurors’ reasoning (Rose, 2007; Schweitzer et al., 2011). \nResearch thus suggests that attributions of responsibility are complex and multifaceted, and a \ndirect ‘more neurologically determined–less personal responsibility’ effect appears unlikely.\nBelief in personal responsibility persists because it is predicated on what Morris et al. (2001) call \nimplicit theories of agency: robust cultural theories, transmitted across generations, defining the \nkinds of entities that act intentionally and autonomously to cause events. In western societies, the \nindividual human intentional agent is unambiguously positioned as the primary and ‘natural’ causal \nforce (Wellman and Miller, 2006); people socialized into western cultures often cannot conceptual -\nize how agency could operate at any level beyond the individual (Morris and Peng, 1994). Individual \nindependence and self-determination is culturally valorised: the experience of possessing free will \nis positively emotionally valenced (Stillman et al., 2011) and people disfavour deterministic under -\nstandings of behaviour (Fahrenberg and Cheetham, 2000). It may be difficult for deterministic inter -\npretations of neuroscience to pierce such culturally embedded folk understandings. In fact, far from \ncontradicting traditional assumptions, some writers have suggested that neuroscientific explanations \ndovetail with individualistic attribution, directing attention inside the individual skull (Choudhury \net al., 2009; Vidal, 2009). Neuroscientific understandings may thereby support the continued neglect \nof the socio-structural contexts that shape actions, perceptions and emotions.\nAn emerging nuance in debates about neuroscience and determinism acknowledges that neuro -\nscience is a non-uniform body of knowledge, encompassing different ideas and approaches that \ncould have differential societal effects.

A key dimension here relates to \nwhether neural structure and function are seen as genetically pre-programmed or as ‘plastic’ and \nthereby modulated by experience. The latter representation has recently come to prominence and \nhas been proclaimed the biological condition for individual agency, the idea being that neuroplas -\nticity facilitates the ability to initiate self-change (Papadopoulos, 2011; Pitts-Taylor, 2010). Some \nargue that neuroplasticity also has political implications: if the brain is the seat of beliefs and emo -\ntions, then if the brain is malleable so too must be identity and concurrent societal processes \n(Thornton, 2011).\nThe concept of plasticity has assimilated into popular arenas, manifesting particularly in \nexhortations to ‘boost’ or ‘train’ one’s brain (O’Connor et al., 2012; Pitts-Taylor, 2010). This \ntrend represents the brain as a resource whose efficacy is contingent on its owner’s actions: indi -\nviduals can enhance their neural function through nutrition, mental exercise or artificial means \n(e.g. pharmaceuticals), or endanger it through exposure to risky activities or substances. While \nthe salience of these messages in media dialogue has been empirically established (O’Connor \net al., 2012), the extent to which people endorse them in everyday life remains unclear. Most \ninvestigative attention has focused on pharmaceutical enhancement of neural performance, a \npractice portrayed as widespread by commentators in the media (Forlini and Racine, 2009; \nPartridge et al., 2011) and academic literature (Farah et al., 2004; Schanker, 2011). Some data \nindicate substantial levels of unprescribed neuro-pharmaceutical use within certain populations \n– for example, university students (Smith and Farah, 2011) – though other studies suggest it is \nrare (Coveney, 2011). Uptake of pharmaceutical enhancement may, however, represent some -\nthing of a red herring in evaluating the depth of engagement with brain optimization: more \nlikely, it is via less extreme and costly practices – such as purposefully changing nutritional \npatterns or attempting crossword puzzles – that the logic of brain enhancement most deeply penetrates \neveryday life. As yet, no research with lay populations assesses receptivity to non-pharmaceutical \nbrain enhancement, though sales figures for electronic ‘brain-training’ devices indicate a rapidly \nexpanding market (NeuroInsights, 2009).\nThe prominence of the notion of plasticity could be interpreted as liberating, conveying that \nindividuals can control their neurological destinies. However, some have voiced concern that \nplasticity places ultimately repressive demands on individuals to ‘maximize’ their untapped neuro -\nlogical potential (Pitts-Taylor, 2010; Thornton, 2011). Brain optimization ideas appear to cohere \nwith the contemporary zeitgeist of self-improvement, at the root of which lie concerns about self-\ncontrol, a cardinal value in western cultures (Joffe and Staerklé, 2007). In recent times, demands \nfor self-control have been most vocally articulated within the health domain: ‘healthism’ pertains \nnot only to physical health but to establishing oneself as a virtuous, disciplined citizen (Crawford, \n2006; Rabinow, 1992). One works on the self through working on the body. The language and \nsubstantive content of appeals to brain optimization echo the central ethos of contemporary health \ndiscourse, emphasizing individual responsibility and lifestyle choices (Blaxter, 1997; Crawford, 2006). \nThe brain is emerging as a new site at which efforts to achieve self-control and self-improvement \ncan operate. Much of the brain optimization discourse has coalesced around the topic of dementia, \nthe promised aversion of which stands as the most compelling incentive for ‘brain-training’ \n(Palmour and Racine, 2011; Williams et al., 2011). The fear dementia elicits can be largely traced \nto a perception that it dissolves personal identity, independence and self-determination (Van \nGorp and Vercruysse, 2012). Public dialogue thereby conveys that disciplined regimes of brain \noptimization can stave off the ultimate, permanent loss of self-control. Thus, much popular \ndiscussion of the brain appears to reiterate a cultural ethic of self-control. How this translates \ninto everyday experience remains unclear, however, as analysis of the self-control ethic in media"

Deterministic ideas collide with deeply entrenched cultural understandings of \nindividual responsibility and self-control, and as yet little evidence suggests that these values will \nbuckle under the pressure. Indeed, it seems more likely that neuroscientific information is being \nco-opted into these value systems, rejuvenating them and driving them forward within superficial \nreframings.\nDo neuroscience explanations reduce stigma?\nA frequent context through which neuroscience manifests in society is the explanation of human \nvariation, with observed differences between particular categories of people traced to reported dif -\nferences in their neurobiological characteristics (Choudhury et al., 2009; Dumit, 2004; O’Connor \net al., 2012). Systems of social categorization infringe on all stages of neuroscience research: from \nthe selection of research topics – for example, investigating whether the predefined categories of \ncriminals, adolescents or schizophrenics have distinctive neurological features; to research meth -\nodology – particularly in specifying the demographic variables to be factored into sample composi -\ntion and the parameters of ‘normality’ that constitute an appropriate control sample; and research \ninterpretation – as seen in the formal labelling of autistic traits as ‘male’ (Jack and Appelbaum, \n2010). Neuroscience thus invokes and reproduces certain assumptions about social categories. \nThrough what philosopher Ian Hacking (1995) describes as a ‘looping effect’, classifying people \nworks on them and changes them, altering how they think about themselves and how others per -\nceive them. If neuroscience is implicated in cultural efforts to delineate ‘types’ of people, how \nmight this affect social identities and intergroup relations?\nSome evidence suggests that new social identities are forming around neuroscientific informa -\ntion. As neurobiology has supported new classifications (e.g. certain psychiatric diagnoses) there \nhave been instances of concomitant collective mobilization, with people assembling around \nshared neurobiological explanations to advocate for research, treatment and services (Novas and \nRose, 2000). The aforementioned neurodiversity movement exemplifies this. Advocacy groups \nacross a broad range of issues – for example, addiction, mental illness, juvenile justice and homo -\nsexuality – have embraced neuroscientific explanations, hailing their potential to divert society \nfrom a discourse of blame and moral condemnation (Corrigan and Watson, 2004; Hall et al., 2004; \nWalsh, 2011). Research with mentally ill populations has shown that patients themselves expect \nbiomedical explanations to reduce the stigma they encounter (Buchman et al., 2013; Easter, 2012; \nIlles et al., 2008). Neuroscientific framings of behaviour – for example, representing addiction or \nmental illness as brain diseases – are thus widely expected to promote tolerance towards tradition -\nally stigmatized groups.\nThe actual effect of neuroscientific explanations on orientations towards stigmatized groups \nmay, however, be considerably more complex. Research on attitudes to mental illness indeed \nindicates that attribution of undesirable behaviour to biological factors reduces blame (Corrigan \nand Watson, 2004; Mehta and Farina, 1997; Rüsch et al., 2010). However, biomedical attributions \nfor mental illness are also linked to increases in social distance (Bag et al., 2006; Dietrich et al., \n2006; Read and Harré, 2001; Rüsch et al., 2010), perceived dangerousness (Corrigan and Watson, \n2004; Dietrich et al., 2006; Read and Harré, 2001; Walker and Read, 2002), fear (Dietrich et al., \n2006), perceived unpredictability (Walker and Read, 2002) and harsh treatment (Mehta and \nFarina, 1997).

Aside from mental illness, unfavourable correlates of biological expla -\nnations have also been detected for attitudes regarding gender (Brescoll and LaFrance, 2004; \nMorton et al., 2009), race (Jayaratne et al., 2006; Williams and Eberhardt, 2008) and obesity \n(Teachman et al., 2003). Furthermore, some data suggest biological explanations operate as self-\nfulfilling prophecies for those to whom they are applied, for example undermining women’s \nmathematical performance (Dar-Nimrod and Heine, 2006), increasing overweight individuals’ \ncalorie intake (Dar-Nimrod and Heine, 2011) and promoting fatalism among mentally ill people \nabout their prospects of recovery (Easter, 2012; Lam and Salkovskis, 2007).\nIn a comprehensive review, Dar-Nimrod and Heine (2011) attribute the negative social conse -\nquences of biological explanations to the operation of psychological essentialism .2 Wagner, Holtz \nand Kashima (2009) define essentialism as the attribution of a group’s characteristics to an unalter -\nable and causal ‘essence’, which involves (i) establishing discrete, impermeable category boundar -\nies; (ii) perceived homogeneity within the category; (iii) using the essence to explain and predict \nthe group’s surface traits; and (iv) naturalization of the category. Representations of neuroscience \ncurrently circulating in society conform to these trends, with long-established stereotypes of \nparticular social groups (e.g. women, overweight people, adolescents) reconstituted as invariable \nfeatures of their natural constitutions (Fine, 2010; Kelly, 2012; O’Connor et al., 2012). Essentialism \nhas destructive effects on intergroup relations, promoting a sharp ‘us–them’ split in which particu -\nlar groups are marked out as biologically ‘other’. Dumit (2003, 2004) and Buchman et al. (2010) \nargue that neuroimaging data have been particularly effective at constructing this ‘otherness’: it is \ncommonplace both in academic and popular literature (on, for example, addiction) to encounter \ntwo differently coloured brain images placed side by side, establishing a categorical distinction \nbetween ‘the normal brain’ and ‘the addicted brain’. There is little sense of addiction as a spectrum; \nrather, addicts are homogenized as almost a different species. Neuroscience may thus promote \nessentialistic representations of social groups and incite concurrent movements towards stigmati -\nzation and discrimination.\nThe consequences of neuroscience for attitudes to social groups cannot be characterized as \nunambiguously positive or negative. The effects of neurobiological frames seem to vary between \ndomains: for example, effects are generally more promising for attitudes to homosexuality than \nrace, gender, mental illness or obesity (Haslam and Levy, 2006; Jayaratne et al., 2006). Effects also \nvary within domains: for example between different mental disorders, with tolerance most com -\npromised when the disorder purportedly involves violence (Schnittker, 2008). However, it seems \nunlikely that neuroscientific explanations will eradicate stigmatizing or prejudicial understandings \nof social groups. In some cases, neuroscientific explanations of human difference may reinforce, \nrather than dismantle, the social and symbolic boundaries that separate categories of people.\nConclusions\nLynch (2009) contends that we are on the cusp of a ‘neurorevolution’ whose effects will eclipse the \ngreat societal revolutions – agricultural, industrial and informational – that history has thus far \nwitnessed. However, the bulk of the evidence reviewed above suggests that claims that neurosci -\nence will dramatically alter people’s relations with their selves, others and the world are overstated. \nIn many cases, neuroscientific ideas have assimilated in ways that perpetuate rather than challenge \nexisting modes of understanding. This is perhaps not surprising: beliefs relating to free will, self-\ncontrol, individual responsibility and essentialism are entangled in dense networks of cultural nar -\nrative and symbolism and are consequently likely to prove obdurate. These beliefs are, however,"

Uncertainties linger over issues as basic as whether the public are \naware of neuroscience: is the media’s attentiveness to neuroscience reflected in ordinary thought? \nWhile existing evidence indicates it is unlikely neurobiology will come to dominate folk psychology, \nmight certain factors (e.g. individual differences or socio-demographic variables) differentially \npromote acceptance or rejection of neuroscientific understandings? Incorporating neurobiological \ninformation into self-perception is more likely within clinical populations, but even here neurobio -\nlogical explanations are not absolute: how do they interact with other non-biological understandings? \nMedia analysis suggests that neuroscience is assimilating into existing ideologies relating to free \nwill, responsibility and self-control, but is this mirrored in ordinary thinking about these issues? \nFinally, while existing data cast doubt on neuroscience’s potential as a stigma-reduction mechanism, \nresearch on biological essentialism has concentrated largely on mental illness. As neuroscientific \ncategories move beyond the clinical domain – for example, into criminality, personality, gender \nand sexuality – their effects on attendant social identities and intergroup relations must be closely \ntracked.\nThe cumulative implication of the research reviewed in this article is that neuroscience’s \ncultural influence cannot be evaluated in terms of a single narrative about personhood that it \nimposes on society. The neuroscientific ideas that reach the public sphere do not encounter pas -\nsive receptacles of information, but active audiences who approach it through the lens of pre-\nexisting worldviews, assumptions and agendas. Neuroscience is open to a multiplicity of \ninterpretations and uses in society, and has a corresponding multiplicity of effects. For social \nscientists, this means that the critical priority for forthcoming investigation must revolve around \ndisentangling the contingencies under which neuroscience exerts (or does not exert) distinctive \nimpacts. Necessary developments include complementing analysis of neuroscience in the media \nwith examination of its manifestation in personal lives; more extensive investigation of engagement \nwith neuroscience within non-clinical populations; and departure from the hitherto near-exclusive \nfocus on developed, western societies. Ongoing debates about the cultural significance of neu -\nroscience should closely attend to such research developments, thereby supporting a dialogue in \nwhich the nuances of the domain are openly acknowledged and empirical findings prioritised \nover polemic and speculation.\nFunding\nThis publication was made possible through the support of a grant from The Faraday Institute for Science & \nReligion at St Edmund’s College, Cambridge.\nNotes\n1. To provide some procedural detail on the literature review: the collection of literature on neuroscience \nand lay understandings of personhood reviewed here was amassed gradually over a two-year period. \nRelevant papers were identified via periodic keyword searches (using search-terms such as ‘neuroscience \n& self’, ‘neuroscience & society’, ‘neuroscience & identity’) of electronic databases (e.g. Social Science \nCitation Index, SCOPUS), and the bibliographies of papers thus acquired were examined to procure \nadditional references. An electronic database was set up to store the literature gathered. This database was \norganized into folders based on papers’ subject matter (e.g. ‘neuroscience in the media’, ‘neuroscience \nand clinical categories’), with new folder categories created as required by incoming papers.
