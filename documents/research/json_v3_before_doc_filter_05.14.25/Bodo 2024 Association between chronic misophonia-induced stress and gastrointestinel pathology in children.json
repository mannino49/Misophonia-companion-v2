Introduction\nMisophonia is a neurophysiological disorder with behavioral implications, is complex\nand multifactorial in origin, and is characterized by an atypical and disproportionate emo-\ntional response to specific stimuli [ 1,2]. Misophonia was described in the early 2000s and\nhas continuously gained clinical and scientific recognition in various medical specialties, yet\nit is not yet distinctly defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\n(DSM V) as a psychiatric disorder [2,3].\nChildren 2024 ,11, 699. https://doi.org/10.3390/children11060699 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/children"

This reaction that begins\nwith irritation or disgust immediately escalates to overwhelming experiences of anger and\npanic [ 4–6]. The extreme, irrational reaction is even associated with feelings of hatred and\nrage. The reaction is involuntary, with affected individuals stating that they have no control\nover it, despite understanding its inappropriateness. Moreover, affected individuals have\ndifficulty in distracting their attention from the stimulus [ 2]. Misophonia is considered a\nconditioned response to the triggering stimulus [7].\nAlthough the expression of symptoms varies, with mild to severe impairments, miso-\nphonia syndrome has a major impact on the quality of life of patients, who develop\navoidant, maladaptive behavior, affecting their social life and academic and professional\nperformance [8,9].\nMisophonia has been addressed both as an auditory disorder and as a psychiatric\ndisorder. One of the reasons considered for the reluctance to define misophonia as a\npsychiatric disorder has been the risk of the stigmatization of those suffering from this\ndisorder [ 10]. However, misophonia cannot be classified as a hearing disorder either\nbecause, to date, no association has been found between any hearing impairment and\nmisophonia [10].\nResearch on misophonia has been growing in recent years, with the first consensus on\nits definition published in 2022 and presented by Swedo et al. (2022) [ 2]. This consensus\nrepresents a step forward in the acceptance of this pathology as a distinct pathology, with\nclearly established definition criteria. Due to its valuable contribution in the approach\nof this pathology diagnosis, we present here the main proposed criteria for misophonia,\nas follows:\nDefinition of misophonia: a disorder of impaired tolerance to specific sounds or\nstimuli known as “triggers”, which are experienced as unpleasant and distressing and\nevoke negative responses on the emotional, physiological, and behavioral levels; these are\nresponses not seen in other people.\nMisophonic response: responses are not corelated with the auditory stimuli intensity,\nbut with a specific pattern or meaning for the affected person.\nMisophonic triggers: Triggering stimuli are repetitive and primarily include those pro-\nduced by humans [ 2]. Once a trigger is detected, people with misophonia cannot distract\ntheir attention from the stimulus. People are aware that their reactions are out of propor-\ntion. The symptoms of misophonia usually appear in childhood or early adolescence [ 2].\nAuditory triggers are the most common and are represented by sounds associated with the\noral/nasal area including eating, chewing, lip smacking, coughing, gagging, swallowing,\nbreathing, sniffing, and also non-oral/nasal sounds such as clicking, typing, tapping, shuf-\nfling, footsteps, clock ticking [ 2]. Watching a person eat has also been reported as a visual\ntrigger [2].\nMisophonic reaction: Reactions to the specific stimulus are defined as the negative af-\nfective reactions of anger, irritation, disgust, anxiety, and rage. An arousal of the autonomic\nsystem causing muscle tension, increased heart rate and sweating, strong behavioral reac-\ntions, agitation, and aggression towards the stimulant takes place. Aggression expressed as\nverbal or physical outbursts is seen more in children than in adults [2].\nCoping mechanism: affected individuals may exhibit behaviors designed to mitigate\ntheir reactions such as avoiding situations that could lead to exposure, escaping from\ntriggering stimuli, attempting to interrupt triggering stimuli, and reproducing triggering\nstimuli [2].\nFactors: The factors that determine the intensity of the reaction are linked to the\ncontext in which the trigger is encountered; the degree of control perceived by the person"

Self-generated stimuli do not usually evoke aversive responses [2].\nImpairment: Functional impairment is caused by significant distress that interferes\nwith daily life, leading to mental health problems. Functional impairments span from mild\nto severe, consisting of difficulty concentrating, an inability to perform professional tasks,\nand social rejection, leading to impaired functioning in roles, strained social relationships,\nand social isolation [2].\nAssociation with other comorbidities: misophonia can occur in people having or\nlacking normal hearing thresholds, in conjunction or not with tinnitus, hyperacusis, neuro-\nlogical or psychiatric conditions such as affective disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders,\npersonality disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity, and autism spectrum disorders [2].\nTo make the diagnosis of misophonia, its symptoms should not be better explained by\nany other concomitant disorder [2].\n2. Etiology of Misophonic Syndrome\nThe etiology and long-term course of misophonia are not fully known at present. As\netiological hypotheses, the existence of traumatic events, a genetic predisposition, and the\ncomorbidity of depression and anxiety have been proposed [1].\nMost often, an acute and sudden first appearance is described in childhood or early\nadolescence, may follow an early triggering event, and may be associated with distressing\nchildhood memories of sounds made by family members, especially during meals. First,\nthe affected person notices sounds made by other people and becomes hypersensitive to\nthem [1,11].\n2.1. The Genetic Predisposition Hypothesis with Misophonia\nThe family focus, both in terms of the family as an environmental factor and as a\nprovider of genetic material, is that in over 50% of diagnosed cases, misophonia was\ndiscovered in at least one other member of the patient’s family. Studies showing families\nwith different members who meet the diagnostic criteria, or have a family history of the\nsame symptomatology, bring into question the role of the genetic background as well as\nthe role of upbringing and learned behavior within the family [ 12]. Although there are no\ntwin studies for this pathology, and no genetic studies have been performed to identify the\nhereditary component [1], some data suggest a substantial impact of genetic factors [13].\nThe genetic predisposition hypothesis stems from the observation that obsessive\ncompulsive personality disorder, a genetically predisposed disorder, also predisposes\nindividuals to the development of misophonia, and explains the 50% comorbidity rate\nbetween the two disorders [11].\nThere is still little knowledge of how prevalence may differ between biological sexes,\nbut most studies shows that gender is not significantly associated with the misophonic\nsyndrome severity [1,14,15].\n2.2. The Hypothesis of Neurobiological Alterations\nThe hypothesis of neurobiological alterations examines the abnormal emotional re-\nsponse of misophonic patients exposed to the trigger from the perspective of the auditory\nprocessing mechanism, which might be different in these patients. The association of the\ninappropriate reaction with a single type of sound suggests that this may be due to a\npotential anatomical alteration, which could be in the cortical areas responsible for infor-\nmation processing [ 1], or the limbic and autonomic nervous systems [ 1], or as a result of\nhyperconnectivity between the auditory and limbic systems [ 16]. Somatic symptoms such\nas high blood pressure and heart rate, physical pain, sweating, and shortness of breath\nfollowing the exposure to a triggering stimulus are evidence of autonomic nervous system\nactivation [17].\nThe increased physiological response produces significant distress in affected pa-\ntients [ 8] and has a positive correlation with the intensity of patient-reported aversion,"

According to this author, in this pathology, increased\nconnectivity between the orofacial motor areas and auditory cortex in response to all types\nof sounds may be observed [21].\nBecause misophonia is not yet accepted as a distinct psychiatric disorder, identify-\ning the neurobiological mechanisms involved in its development could help consolidate\nmisophonia as a distinct pathology and as a psychiatric syndrome in its own right. To\ndate, however, the neurobiological mechanisms of misophonia have been explored very\nlittle [19].\n2.3. The Behavioral Theory of Misophonia\nIn addition to the genetic predisposition hypothesis and the neurological mechanism\nhypothesis, behavioral mode hypotheses have also been proposed.\nSiepsiak et al. (2023) showed that misophonia in pediatric patients is related to\nincreased psychopathology, but a link between misophonic syndrome and lower social and\nemotional skills, autism spectrum disorders, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\ncannot be shown. Also, these authors offered a characterization of misophonia as an\ninternalizing rather than an externalizing disorder [13].\nA possible positive association with autism spectrum disorders requires further analy-\nsis considering that a higher prevalence of misophonic symptomatology was found among\npatients with autism spectrum disorders [ 22] and autistic traits were found to be elevated\nin misophonic patients compared to controls [ 23]. In a large online clinical sample of adult\nmisophonic patients [ 5], 3% were diagnosed with comorbid autism spectrum disorder, and\n3.6% with self-reported misophonia were diagnosed with autism [ 24], a prevalence nearly\ndouble that of the general population [ 25,26]. On the contrary, other studies showed no\nlink between misophonic syndrome and autism spectrum disorders [13].\nThe best known and most accepted behavioral theory of the etiology of misophonia is\nthat it develops through a process of conditioning through an experience, in which a reflex\nreaction to a predictable stimulus is acquired and repeated, resulting in the association of a\nstimulus with a negative emotional state.\nThus, misophonia is thought to involve a conditioned response provoked by human\naudio-visual triggers, with symptoms resulting from increased reactivity in the context of\nthe hypervigilance and sensitization of the auditory cortex [19].\nOne expert opinion presents several psychological profiles of children who develop\nmisophonia, dividing them into two categories. Both categories are described as having\nspecific symptoms in the feeding process (closely related to meals), which is the primary\nprocess of the pathology (most of the triggering sounds are made by the oral area associated\nwith the chewing process). The first category is represented by the obedient and sensitive\nchild. This child is caring, cooperative, and emotional and may not show outward signs\nof discomfort, but when family members show discomfort, this discomfort is associated\nwith sound. Once the child develops misophonia, he or she becomes demanding of the"

The second category is the strong-\nwilled, volatile child who often has conflicts with a parent or sibling, associating the anger\nand discomfort felt with the sound, which later becomes the triggering stimulus [27].\nWe conclude by saying that, at this time, there is no consensus regarding the etiology\nof misophonia and the mechanisms of the occurrence of its maladaptive behaviors; the\nauthors consider that the lack of generally accepted diagnostic criteria has been the main\nlimitation of the studies conducted with this purpose [28].\n3. Childhood Clinical Presentation of Misophonic Syndrome and Assessment\nof Symptoms\nThe symptoms of misophonia occur at any age. Retrospective studies conducted\non adults with misophonia suggest a childhood onset (45%) or adolescent onset (30%),\n15% reported life-long presentation, with only 9% reporting that their symptoms began in\nadulthood [24,29].\nThe mean age of onset of misophonia was reported to be 12.5 years [ 11,30,31], with\nsome children meeting criteria as early as 3 years of age. For very young children, it can be\ndifficult to diagnose and differentiate misophonia from other forms of low sound tolerance,\nas these children are not able to verbalize their needs and discomfort [ 13]. One specific case\nhas been reported in a 2-year-old child [ 14]. This suggests that misophonia symptoms may\nstart earlier than previously thought [ 13,29,32]. However, little attention has been paid\nto misophonia and its consequences in children and adolescents, although the condition\nusually begins in childhood [33].\nOn the other hand, the average age at which misophonia is diagnosed is 37–39 years [ 11],\nwhich is also when patients receive medical attention for the disorder [34].\nMisophonia thus becomes a chronic disorder affecting patients for more than 30 years,\nmainly because their suffering is not usually properly diagnosed and treated [12].\nThe primary or most triggering stimulus was a family member for 50% of the children\nincluded in a study by Siepsiak et al. (2023). [ 13].These results support the hypothesis that\nsounds generated by family members are important triggers. This can be explained by the\nfact that most children spend most of their time within the family; therefore, the disturbing\ntriggers occur in close proximity to them [13,35,36].\nA major study of young patients published in 2023 lists the most frequent triggers\nof misophonia in children as eating (96%), throat sounds (66%), breathing (84%), and\ntapping (54%). In response, avoidant behavior, annoyance, irritation, verbal aggression,\nand an impact on family were generally valid. The severity of misophonia was associated\nwith internalizing symptoms with high rates of comorbidity and externalizing behaviors\nreported by children [4,37].\nThe misophonic syndrome in children and adolescents can manifest in various ways\nand intensities and will not necessarily involve externalized verbal or physical aggres-\nsion. Therefore, screening for self-harm, somatic symptoms, and other related symptoms,\nshould be an important part of the diagnostic process, especially the patients where these\nexternalized behaviors are not obvious [38,39].\nThe differences in the clinical misophonia presentation in children have also been\ndescribed by Siepsiak et al. (2023) [ 13]. In children with misophonia, migraine headaches\nand severe headaches were reported more than in the control group. They also reported a\nhigher rate of somatic complaints, this correlation being attributed to greater exposure to\nstress, weaker emotional regulation skills, or emotional suppression [13].\nIt has been hypothesized that the emotional distress and psychophysiological arousal\nin misophonia exceed young children’s abilities to respond to a hostile trigger in socially\nacceptable ways. Guzick et al. (2023) also described verbal and physical aggression in\nchildren and adolescents with misophonia [ 4]. Verbal and physical aggression is considered\nto be common in misophonia, particularly in children aged 7–12 years, with only 7%\nreported in adolescent groups. The adolescents evaluated reported self-harm while exposed"

The conclusion presented is that externalized behaviors related to stimuli\ndecrease with age, probably due to increased self-awareness and inhibitory control [4].\nThe overwhelming majority of sufferers reported that their symptoms became progres-\nsively worse with age. The natural course of the disorder is symptom worsening in 45–58%\nof cases, stable evolution (25%), and, rarely, spontaneous remission (16.7%) [ 12,17]. With\nage, misophonia-related distress does not decrease, it is only managed in a better, more\nsocially acceptable manner, but in a self-destructive, dysfunctional way [ 4]. There is limited\nresearch on misophonia across the lifespan, especially among children and adolescents [ 4].\nA milestone in understanding pediatric misophonia is a proper diagnosis, the accurate\nmeasurement of symptoms, and an assessment of their impact on daily life and mental\nand social health [ 33]. Even for patients at an early age, for the pediatric population, there\nare some solid psychometric assessment tools using misophonia measurement scales, as\nshown in Table 1.\nTable 1. Summary of validation scales available for pediatric use for misophonia.\nScale Description\nMAQ [33]The scale assesses the negative effects of misophonia in everyday life, a\nmultidimensional measure with four identical scales, with one version for\nchildren and one for parents: interference, pessimism, non-recognition, and\ncurrent distress. The MAQ can also be used to detect the negative\nconsequences of misophonia.\nA-MISO-S [33]This scale is a unidimensional measure of the overall severity of pediatric\nmisophonia and is based on the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Disorder\nScale. It assesses stress, time, control, interference, resistance, and avoidance.\nMisophonia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ) [40]This is a promising questionnaire for assessing the impact of misophonia in\nadolescents, but is completed by a parent.\nSussex Misophonia Scale for Adolescents [6]This scale is a tool for measuring misophonia in adolescents, based on the\nSussex Misophonia Scale for Adults. The scale is ideally suited for adaptation\nin adolescents by using psycholinguistic data to ensure\nchild-appropriate language.\nMisophonia Scale Amsterdam—Youth [4,41]This scale is an adaptation of the adult self-assessment questionnaire AMISO-S\nand the revised AMISOS-R, but it is specifically adjusted for the particularities\nof Dutch children.\n4. Somatic Implications in Children with Misophonia\nMisophonia in children is a vulnerability factor that induces a chronic state of stress\nthat will contribute to later somatic health problems. Children who have misophonia, due\nto their high level of anxiety, are focused on identifying and listening to any triggering\nstimulus and avoiding situations, people, and foods that they anticipate will cause discom-\nfort associated with the unpleasant stimulus [ 17]. Patients thus suffer ongoing physical\nand emotional discomfort and social maladjustment, contributing to chronic stress and a\nreduced quality of life [17].\nMedical health problems arising from the internalizing process can be affective, includ-\ning generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and depressed mood; cognitive, including difficulty\nconcentrating and over-focusing on triggers; obsessive, including prevalent or even para-\nnoid ideation about guilt towards themselves and others, as well as avoidance behaviors\nand coping mechanisms [ 42–44]; and somatic, among which digestive tract disorders are\nrelevant [42,43].\nVery few studies have examined somatic effects in misophonic pathology, effects\nproduced by continuous stress, high anxiety, and difficulties with eating properly. A\nstudy published in 2022 investigated the possible complications of this pathology and\ncomorbidities in the pediatric population.\nA self-assessment questionnaire was used to evaluate a range of medical health prob-\nlems in children with misophonia and their families, including neurodevelopmental impair-"

Acid reflux, migraines, and auditory pathology\nsuch as tinnitus and hyperacusis had a significantly positive association with misophonia\nseverity [ 45]. In an observational study conducted in 2013–2017 on adult subjects with\nmisophonic symptoms, somatic examination results (general screening and hearing tests)\nshowed that irritable bowel syndrome was among the most common somatic diagnoses,\nalong with migraine, asthma, and back pain. During physical examination, no neurological\ndisorders were determined, but mild comorbid somatic disorders were regularly found [ 5].\n5. Consequences of Chronic Stress Exposure in Misophonia\nThe medical term stress, first defined by endocrinologist Hans Hugo Bruno Selye,\nrepresents the adaptive response of organisms to adverse endogenous or exogenous, psy-\nchological or physical, and real or perceived stressors [46].\n5.1. Stress and the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal Axis\nThe hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis is the efferent stress axis that interrelates the\nadaptive responses of the human body to stressors and is a part of the limbic system, the\narea predominantly involved in emotional responses and memory [47].\nThe acute stress response is modulated by physiological alterations in the nervous\nand endocrine system, but eventually, the equilibrium returns to the basal state. On the\nother hand, chronic stress, especially during childhood, leads to the long-term activation\nof the stress pathways, and has detrimental psychological consequences for all major bio-\nlogical systems, including the cardiovascular, nervous, endocrine, metabolic, and immune\nsystems [ 48,49]. Numerous studies have approached the mechanisms connecting early life\nstress to these systems and have analyzed the relationship between the gut microbiome\nand stress, specifically in early life [50–52].\nChronic psychological stress is considered to be associated with the deregulation of\nthe hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Environmental stress, such as that induced by\nmisophonia, activates the system through the secretion of corticotropin-releasing factor\nfrom the hypothalamus, followed by the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone from the\npituitary gland, which will lead to the release of cortisol from the adrenal glands. Cortisol,\nthe main stress hormone, affects all body structures via the blood circulation, allowing the\nbrain to influence the activities of somatic systems including the gastrointestinal system [ 53].\nAlso, corticotropin-releasing factor receptors and their ligands can be modulated by\nstress and are expressed in both the gut and the brain [ 54], can influence the secretion of\nthe mucosal barrier and enteric peristalsis, and plays an important role in gastrointestinal\ndisorders [55–57].\nIt is known that the gut–brain axis involves two-way communication, joining the\ncentral nervous system and the enteric system, and connecting the emotional and cognitive\nbrain areas to peripheral gut functioning [ 53]. There is clinical evidence of gut–brain axis\ninteractions resulting from the association of dysbiosis with central nervous disorders,\nparticularly in autism spectrum disorders, anxiety–depressive disorders, and functional\ngastrointestinal disorders. One example of this kind of relationship is irritable bowel\nsyndrome [53].\n5.2. The Microbiome-Specific Signatures\nThe majority of preclinical studies investigating the microbiota gut–brain axis have\nbeen focused on animal model studies and have suggested that the gut microbiome plays\na role in the development of the stress response [ 58]. There are studies that have shown\nthat the neurotransmitter GABA, which is involved in anxiety and depressive disorders, is\nsecreted by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium [ 59]. The probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus\nhas been shown to decrease anxiety behaviors in stress tasks and modify the functioning\nof GABA receptors in mice [ 60]. The level of tryptophan, the serotonin precursor, plays a\nrole in depression, and can be elevated by Bifidobacterium ingestion [ 61]. The influence"

The Role of Serotonin and Catecholamines\nAn additional vector of the process is serotonin, with its important role in influencing\naffect, its involvement in pain control, in the central nervous system, and in the periphery\nthrough descending inhibition [ 65], and its influence on digestion, where it plays an impor-\ntant role in gastrointestinal signaling as a paracrine messenger used by enterochromaffin\ncells [66].\nStress activates the sympathetic autonomic system, contributing to the increased pro-\nduction of adrenal hormones. Catecholamines mediate the increase in central and periph-\neral inflammatory cytokines [ 67]. In addition, the vagus nerve, and its anti-inflammatory\neffects, are decreased by stress, contributing to an increased inflammatory response and,\nconsequently, gut inflammation [68,69].\nStress and anxiety, through the mechanism outlined above, can be top triggers for\nmany gastrointestinal pathologies, especially in children [ 70]. By correlating misophonia-\ninduced stress and its effect on the gastrointestinal system with the mechanisms presented,\nwe propose a model to justify the occurrence of gastrointestinal pathology in the pediatric\npopulation suffering from misophonia. This is shown in Figure 1.\nChildren 2024 , 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW  9 of 14 \n \n  \nFigure 1. Proposed model for the development of gastrointestinal pathology in misophonic syn-\ndrome.  \n6.

Patient in-\nvolvement in the treatment approach, including treatment beliefs and affordability, con-\ntributes to treatment acceptance and initiation and clearly leads to better adherence and \npatient outcomes [ 73,74].

Therapeutic Approach\nAlthough our understanding of misophonia is increasing, and the associated chronic\ndistress is being accepted more by clinicians, there is limited knowledge about effective\ntreatments that can be offered to patients [5,31,71,72].\nAs the field advances and a better understanding of the pathology is gained, more\ntreatment options will become available, but it is not yet known which therapies are the\nmost effective or which are acceptable for parents and their children with misophonia and\nassociated somatic distress.\nUnderstanding patient preferences has important clinical implications.

Thus, the new field of psychogastroenterology focuses on the application\nof psychotherapy as an integral part of digestive disease management [56,78].\nThe field of psychogastroenterology has made major progress in identifying psy-\nchosocial risk factors for adverse outcomes in people with gastrointestinal disease. These\nfactors include anxiety, depression, and maladaptive behaviors [ 79]. Based on the biopsy-\nchosocial model [ 80], the integration of psychological approaches into the understanding\nand treatment of gastrointestinal disorders has become a standard of care. The most\ncommonly applied psychological treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy, with strong\nevidence of its effectiveness in treating children and adults suffering from irritable bowel\nsyndrome and inflammatory bowel disease [ 81–83]. It may also be proposed in the setting\nof misophonic pathology.\nThe effectiveness and mechanism by which psychological treatments work in gas-\ntrointestinal disorders are not fully understood. Cognitive behavioral therapy for digestive\npathology focuses on reducing psychological distress and increasing the quality of life.\nThere is a growing awareness that psychological trauma impacts gastrointestinal function-\ning [84].\nIn a recent systematic review, Glynn et al. [ 85] identified that the cumulative preva-\nlence of trauma in gastrointestinal cohorts was 36%. Given the influence of trauma on\ngastrointestinal disease, Jagielski et al. examined whether patients with a history of trauma\nwere more likely to respond to psychological interventions [ 86]. An optimal effect of psy-\nchological interventions has also been identified in other somatic pathologies, such as type\n1 diabetes in children [87].\nThese findings underline the importance of identifying early misophonic pathology,\nidentifying associated somatic distress, and providing them and their parents with well-\nplanned and -executed interventions that can prevent or mitigate potential medical and\nsocial effects as well as their chronicity [13].\n7. Conclusions\nSystematic data on the clinical presentation of this pathology in children and adoles-\ncents are of paramount importance, as developing an early understanding of the condition\nis the basis for appropriate treatment.\nThe early detection of misophonia and effective interventions can mitigate the long-\nterm adverse effects of misophonic syndrome on mental health, somatic health, and so-\ncial life.\nIn this paper, we evaluate the hypothesized correlation between misophonia and the\nchronic stress induced by it in children and its effect on the proper functioning of the"
