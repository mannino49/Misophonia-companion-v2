Conspiracy Beliefs Boost Paranoid Thoughts  \n \nYou've been bitten by  \nA true believer  \nYou've been bitten by  \nSomeone ’s false beliefs  \n(Muse , 2018)   \n \nThe Internet, especially social media platforms, provide almost unlimited space for the \ndissemination of conspiracy theories, making its users (un)intentionally exposed  to this type \nof beliefs on daily basis (e.g., Kużelewska & Tomaszuk, 2022 ). Although p revious research \nshowed that conspiracy theories may have severe societal concomitants , to date,  not many \nstudies focused on the  consequences that being exposed to them  may have on intra-individual \noutcomes  (e.g., mental health) . In the current research , we claim that theories accusing secret \ngroups of colluding to achieve nefarious goals  can lead to maladaptive psychologica l \nconsequences in the form of paranoid thoughts  (i.e., a kind of thinking dominated by \nsuspicious  or persecutory content , such as being  followed and a tendency to  perceive others’ \nactions as intentionally  malicious; Cicero & Kerns, 2011 ).  \nPrevious studies (see Imhoff & Lamberty , 2018), already  associated conspiracy beliefs \nwith paranoid thoughts.  Some researchers (e.g., Cichocka et al. , 2016) even suggested that  \nparanoid thoughts may precede  conspiracy  theories ’ endorsement . These conclusions , \nhowever, were based on cross -sectional data , thereby limiting inference about causality. The \ncurrent work aims to fill this knowledge gap by employing  longitudinal and experimental \nresearch designs  to scrutinize how these two phenomena are intertwined. We argue that  since  \nconspiracy beliefs are omnipresent in the current days (e.g., Stasielowicz, 2022) and constant"

Conspiracy \nbeliefs  were  previously linked to feelings of psychological threat (e.g., anxiety  or \nuncertainty ). For this reason,  many researchers  (e.g., Douglas & Sutton, 2023 ) understood \nthem  as an attempt to reduc e negative experiences  by making sense of the uncertain  through  \nquick judgements  about nefarious groups that allegedly control the world . However, it seems \nthat they are merely attempts, since longitudinal research suggest ed that conspiracy beliefs \nhad the potential to deteriorate initial difficulties, for instance, to heighten  anxiety (Lieke fett \net al. , 2023)  or psychological  defensiveness (Górska  et al., 2023).  Indeed, belief in conspiracy \ntheories was predominantly linked to harmful consequences, such as  prejudice (Marchlewska \net al., 2019)  or lower adherence to safety guidelines during the COVID -19 pandemic (e.g., \nMolenda et al., 202 4; see also Marinthe et al., 2020 ).  \nIn fact, o nly a handful of studies, centered primarily on social psychological outcomes, \ninvestigated the consequences of exposure to conspiracy theories  experimentally . For \nexample , exposure  to conspiracy theories about out -groups (e.g., immigrants) increased \nprejudice against these groups  (Jolley et al., 2020) . Similarly , watching a video about a \ngovernment’s conspiracy heightened  distrust towards that government (Kim & Cao, 2016). \nMoreover, exposure to anti -vaccine conspiracy theories decreased vaccination intentions \n(Jolley & Douglas, 2014)  and exposure to antidepressant conspiracy theories  lowered health -\nseeking intentions  (Natoli & Marques, 2021 ; see also Fournier & Varet, 2023; for studies on \nchemotherapy -related  conspiracy beliefs ), suggesting that ubiquitous conspiracies might"

Importantly, previous research also demonstrated that exposure to \nconspiracy theories increased  negative emotions ( Gkinopoulos  & Mari, 2023 ).  \nSumming up, conspiracy theories have various detrimental consequences. However, \nnone of these studies directly investigated these consequences  in the area of mental health \nissues. Using two -wave longitudinal and experimental designs, we aim to fill this gap by \nexamining the possible relationships between conspiracy theories and paranoid thoughts.   \nConspiracy Beliefs  and Paranoid Thoughts  \n The relationship between paranoid thoughts  and conspiracy beliefs was the subject of \npsychological studies  before , including two meta -analyses (Imhoff & Lamberty, 2018; \nStasielowicz, 2022), both showing a similar estimated correlation (r = .36, r = .34, \nrespectively). So, what is the difference between these two constructs? Paranoid thoughts  are \nlinked to an obsession “with the idea that others  are trying to harm him or her, whereas most \nconspiracy believers may fear less for themselves than for society in general” (Imhoff & \nLamberty, 2018; p. 911).  Therefore,  conspiracy beliefs are  related to the sociopolitical  or the \nintergroup  sphere  and paranoid thoughts  are rather embedded in the interpersonal domain  \n(Imhoff & Lamberty, 2018 ).  \nIndeed, p aranoid thoughts are  characterized by excessive interpersonal distrust, being \nsuspici ous of other ’s intentions, perceiving others as direct threats to oneself, and by hostile, \nself-referent interpretations of other’s behaviors (e.g., Freeman, 2007). According to the \nhierarchy of paranoia (Freeman et al., 2005), the development of such disturbing thoughts is \nbased on the perception of the world as a dangerous place . Affective processes play a pivotal \nrole in these beliefs, specifically in the form of high -intensity negative emotions , such as \nanxiety  (Freeman et al., 2010). The threat anticipation model (Freeman et al., 2002 , 2008) \nhypothesizes  that when an individual experiences such negative emotional states, this can \nshape their perception of the world, potentially leading to a misinterpretation of external"

Negative emotions, such as anxiety and worry, elicit heightened danger anticipation, \nfoster a state of vigilance and encourage the interpretation of ambiguous situations as hostile, \nthreatening , and intended to cause harm.  \nTherefore, since believing in and exposure to conspiracy theories have been linked to \nincreased anxiety and negative emotions (Gkinopoulos & Mari, 2023; Liekefett et al., 2023) - \nfactors  contributing  to the development of paranoid thoughts (Bagrowska et al., 2022; \nFreeman, 2007) - it seems plausible that conspiracy theories could also fuel these thoughts, \nmaking those holding conspiracy convictions more suspicious and distrustful in the \ninterpersonal sphere.  Importantly , conspiracy theories might be  perceiv ed as a form of  \ndangerous world beliefs (a worldview envisioning the social world as threatening; Leone et \nal., 2019), which  can also fuel negative emotions, and thus, increase paranoid thoughts  \n(Bagrowska et al., 2022) . To our knowledge, this assumption has not yet been tested.  Some \nstudies (e.g., Stasielowicz, 2022) treated these constructs as correlates, without  implying any \ndirection of this relationship  and others (e.g., Cichocka  et al. , 2016 ) considered paranoid \nthoughts as a predictor of conspiracy beliefs, assuming that perceiving others’ intentions as \nhostile  on an inter -personal level  might translate into convictions that socio -political events \nare caused by plotting groups. Still, none of these studies  permitted conclusions about \ncausality , which we aim to address in the present research . \nOverview of the Current Research  \nThe main goal of our studies was to shed more light on the role of conspiracy beliefs \nin boosting paranoid thoughts , providing new evidence on the effects of conspiracies on \nhealth symptoms . In a two -wave longitudinal Study 1, we hypothesized  that conspiracy \nbeliefs  at Time 1 (T1) would predict an increase  in paranoid thought s at Time 2 (T2; \nHypothesis 1). In experimental  Studies 2 and 3 , we assumed that exposure to conspiracy \ntheories (vs. control stimuli ) would directly increase paranoid thoughts (Hypothesis 2)."

These results suggest that  exposure to conspiracy theories might lead to \nhigher paranoid thoughts due to eliciting negative , but not positive,  intense emotions.  \nTheoretical Implications  \n The question why people  believe d in conspiracy theories has been explored by \nscientists at least since the 1990s  (e.g., Abalakina -Paap et al., 1999 ), with explanations \ntypically centering around various unfulfilled psychological motives  (e.g.,  Douglas & Sutton, \n2023). However, the existing literature seems to overlook the current reality , which is  that we \nno longer need to  intentionally face maladaptive psychological processes  and actively seek \nalternative  explanations for various situations  to come across conspiracy theories . They \npervade our surroundings and  can possibly  influence us, even if initially we were  not their \nproponents  (Kużelewska & Tomaszuk, 2022) . Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the effects \nof the exposure to conspiracy  theories, going beyond cross -sectional research designs .

This principle extends to  majority of  variables \nassociated with conspiracy beliefs , such as lack of control  (Kofta  et al., 202 0), narcissistic \ngroup identity  (Marchlewska  et al., 2019) , or the aforementioned paranoid thoughts , just to \nmention a few . \n We were especially interested in examining the potential consequences of conspiracy \ntheories since the COVID -19 pandemic resulted in a proliferation of such theories on social \nmedia (Kużelewska & Tomaszuk, 2022).

Thus, conspiracy \ntheories do not only affect socio -political phenomena, such as increased prejudice (Jolley et \nal., 2020) , but they also might affect individuals ’ well-being. Obtained results are also in line \nwith previous findings  regarding the increased negative emotions after being exposed to \nconspiracies (Gkinopoulos & Mari, 2023). As such,  we combined social and clinical \npsychology perspectives to offer a mechanism explaining the effects of conspiracies ’ \nexposure on paranoi d thoughts , and we showed that this exposure increased paranoi d thoughts  \nvia negative -only intens ive emotions. Building on prior research ( Bagrowska et al., 2022;  \nFreeman et al., 2010 ; Gkinopoulos & Mari, 2023; Liekefett et al., 2023), we may conclude \nthat exposure to conspiratorial c ontent has a potential to increase  the perception of the world \nas dangerous, intensif y negative emotions, and worsen mental states, increasing the likelihood \nof paranoid thoughts occurrence . Those who are more prone to paranoid thoughts, for \nexample, due to factors such as low self -esteem, ongoing stress, or psychoactive substance \nuse (Freeman et al., 2015), may be particularly susceptible to the adverse psychological \neffects of exposure to co nspiracy theories.  \nThese results also correspond to Kramer ’s (1998) paranoid cognition model, which \nidentified situational, social cognitive underpinnings of paranoid cognitions (e.g., perceived \ndistinctiveness, social uncertainty) that could lead to dysphoric self -consciousness, increas ed \nrumination and hypervigilance, which may contribute to an exaggerated perception of \nconspiracy (e.g., Wabnegger et al., 2024), ultimately triggering higher paranoid thoughts. \nAccording to that model, our results suggest that the ubiquity of conspiracy the ories and \nexposure to them could be considered situational antecedents that could lead to paranoid \nthoughts (at least temporarily ). The notion of different situational antecedents of paranoid \nthoughts (including conspiracy beliefs) is worth investigating in the future."

Our studies were conducted  in two contexts (Polish \nand British), allowing to increase  our findings ’ generalizability , but this  does not seem enough \nto suggest that the obtained effects are universal . Future research should consider drawing \nsamples from different countries and cultural contexts to replicate these results.  Additionally, \ndespite establishing sample sizes based on power analysis, our research has some drawbacks. \nEspecially experiments should have used more appropriate estimates (i.e., from the research \non conspiracy theories exposure) than we used in this project (i.e., from the research on \ncoping and conspiracy beliefs).  Future research should be more careful with estimations and \neffect sizes used in power analyses.  \nMoreover , we examined the effects of exposure to conspiracy theories  experimentally , \nhowever, we did not examine if this translate d into conspiracy beliefs in the long term - future \nstudies might include more elaborated designs, including both exposure and beliefs, to \nthoroughly investigate these issues.  Another interesting point would be to investigate the \neffects of the constant, long -term exposure to conspiracy theories (which we can experience, \ne.g., on the Internet). However, such studies should be conducted carefully, especially \nregarding the ethical issues  it may raise . It is worth noting that the effects of the debriefings \nshould also be tested in the future. Studies showed that debriefings can be insufficient to \nutterly eliminate the experimental creation of some beliefs (see Anderson et al., 1980). Thus, \nfuture research should mea sure whether the effect of the experimental manipulation on \nconspiracy beliefs holds after the debriefing in order to improve the efficiency of the \ndebriefing , if needed , and to ensure the well -being of the participants.  \n Another point of caution should be made regarding the CLPM  we employed in Study \n1.
