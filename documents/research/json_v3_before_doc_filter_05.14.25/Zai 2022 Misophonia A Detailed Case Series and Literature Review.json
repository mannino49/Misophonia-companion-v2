  "abstract": "Misophonia, also known as selective sound sensitivity syndrome, is characterized by intense aversive reactions to specific sounds or decreased tolerance to particular sounds. This paper presents a detailed case series of five adults diagnosed with misophonia, including descriptions of their symptoms, comorbidities, and treatments attempted. A literature review of 31 selected articles on misophonia was conducted to enhance understanding and promote awareness of this poorly recognized condition. Many patients exhibited comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder or related spectrum disorders. Treatments trialed include cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, hypnotherapy, and various medications with varied success.",
