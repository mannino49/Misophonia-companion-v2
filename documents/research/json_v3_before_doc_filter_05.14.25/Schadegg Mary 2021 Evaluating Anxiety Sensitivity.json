To better understand the \nexpression of misophonia, the current study investigated the moderating role of anxiety sensitivity (AS) in the \nrelation between misophonia and facets of aggression (i.e., anger, hostility, verbal aggression, and physical \naggression). Participants (N 470; Mage 18.68 years; 74.0% female) included college students who endorsed \nmisophonia symptoms and completed online self-report questionnaires. Four regression analyses were conducted \nto examine the interaction between misophonia symptoms and AS on each aggression facet. Results revealed that \nsignificant variance was accounted for in each facet of aggression, with the association between misophonia and \nanger, hostility, and verbal aggression (respectively) strengthening as increased. This study provides additional \nsupport for the association between misophonia and aggressive behavioral tendencies, suggesting AS may \noperate as a pivotal factor in the expression of anger and aggressive responses in misophonia. These findings \nimplicate AS a potential treatment target that could enhance outcomes for patients struggling with misophonia.   \n1.Introduction \nMisophonia is characterized by the intolerance of certain organic (e. \ng., chewing, breathing) and non-organic (e.g., pen clicking, writing) \nnoises (Schroder et al., 2013 ), wherein these triggers elicit intense \nnegative emotions (Dozier, 2015 ; Dozier & Morrison, 2017 ; Schroder \net al., 2013 ) and physiological arousal (Cavanna & Seri, 2015 ; Dozier & \nMorrison, 2017 ; Edelstein et al., 2013 ). Prevalence rates in undergrad -\nuate samples suggest as many as 20% of individuals experience miso-\nphonia symptoms (Wu et al., 2014 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ), ranging from \nmildly annoying to extremely debilitating symptoms (Edelstein et al., \n2013 ). Misophonia has been linked to a wide range of disorders such as \nobsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders (Dozier et al., 2017 ; Schroder \net al., 2013 ), impulse control disorders (Robinson et al., 2018 ), post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (Schroder et al., 2013 ), eating disorders \n(Kluckow et al., 2014 ), tinnitus, phonophobia, and hyperacusis (Jas-\ntreboff & Jastreboff, 2015 ). Although misophonia has not yet been \nclassified as a specific type of disorder, the heightened auditory sensi-\ntivity and emotional distress appear to represent a unique syndrome that \nis not subsumed or accounted for by the presence of another disorder \n(Schroder et al., 2013 ; Taylor, 2017 ). The underpinnings of misophonia are not well understood; however, current theoretical and empirical \nwork indicates complex interplay of neurological, physiological, and \npsychological factors (Brout et al., 2018 ; Potgieter et al., 2019 ). \nAlthough disgust, panic, and anxiety are common misophonic re-\nsponses (Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ), reactions to misophonia stimuli tend \nto emphasize the emotional, physiological, and behavioral signatures of \nanger (Potgieter et al., 2019 ). Several studies have shown that trigger \nstimuli commonly elicit annoyance, irritation, rage, and anger (Dozier & \nMorrison, 2017 ; Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ; Schroder \net al., 2013 ). These emotional reactions are accompanied by tension, \nclenched muscles, breathlessness, and increases in body temperature, \nblood pressure or heart rate (Dozier, 2015 ; Dozier & Morrison, 2017 ; \nEdelstein et al., 2013 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ). \nWhile most individuals attempt to escape or avoid misophonia triggers \n(Dozier & Morrison, 2017 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ), approach-oriented \nbehaviors are frequently reported, such as urges to confront others, \nthoughts of wanting to hurt others, hostility, and impulsive reactions \n(Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ). Further, aggression has \nbeen identified as the most prominent dysfunctional response (Rouw & \nErfanian, 2018 ; Wu et al., 2014 ). For instance, Schroder et al. (2013) \nfound that of 42 patients with misophonia symptoms, 59.5% reported \n*Corresponding author.Department of Psychology, University of Mississippi, P.O.

Specifically, \n28.6% reported verbal aggression, 16.7% engaged in physical aggres -\nsion toward objects, and 11.9% hit an (ex-) partner. Unfortunately, there \nis scant research examining the subsequent consequences of anger and \naggression in misophonia; yet, aggression is generally associated with \npoor response to treatment (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2015 ), workplace \nviolence (Dillon, 2012 ), and interpersonal difficulties across life do-\nmains (e.g., divorce; Cavanna & Seri, 2015 ; Pasha et al., 2009 ; Zhou \net al., 2017 ), suggesting additional impairment for those with \nmisophonia. \nGiven the potential short- and long-term consequences, further \nresearch is needed to understand the connection between misophonia \nand aggression. Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a well-established trans -\ndiagnostic process that has been implicated in a broad range of clinical \nsyndromes (Smits et al., 2019 ). Individuals with elevated AS are likely to \nmisinterpret physiological symptoms as aversive and catastrophize \nconsequences of these symptoms as harmful, dangerous, or embarrass -\ning (Reiss & McNally, 1985 ). In addition to its role in mood and anxiety \ndisorders (Naragon-Gainey, 2010 ), AS predicts engagement in high risk \nbehaviors, such as non-suicidal self-injury (Dixon et al., 2019 ), suicide \n(Stanley et al., 2018 ) and substance use (Keough et al., 2018 ; McCaul \net al., 2017 ). Across conditions, AS is theorized to amplify physiological \narousal and the experience of distress (Taylor et al., 2007 ); thus, in the \ncontext of misophonia, AS may similarly exacerbate reactions to aver-\nsive sounds. To this end, preliminary research has demonstrated AS is \nsignificantly correlated with misophonia severity (Cusack et al., 2018 ; \nMcKay et al., 2018 ); however, the impact of AS on outcomes relevant to \nmisophonia have not been investigated. \nThe purpose of the current study is to enhance our understanding of \nmisophonia by examining the moderating role of AS in the relation \nbetween misophonia symptoms and facets of aggression, including \nanger, hostility, verbal aggression, and physical aggression (Buss & \nPerry, 1992 ). Moderation analyses evaluate how a third variable effects \nthe relationship between two variables by determining under what cir-\ncumstances a relationship exists and whether it is strengthened or \nweakened by the third variable (Hayes & Rockwood, 2017 ). Existing \ntheoretical models and empirical studies support AS as a moderator \nacross a range of emotional and behavioral outcomes (e.g., Dixon et al., \n2014 ; Stathopoulou et al., 2018 ); thus, examining the moderating role of \nAS in misophonia may shed light on the expression of this condition. \nFirst, misophonia symptoms were hypothesized to be positively associ -\nated with AS and aggression facets. In addition, we hypothesized AS \nwould moderate the association between misophonia and each aggres -\nsion facet in a sample of undergraduate students. Specifically, it was \npredicted that AS would strengthen the association between misophonia \nsymptom severity and levels of aggression, after controlling for sex \n(Archer, 2004 , 2009 ). A college student sample is particularly relevant \nas high prevalence rates have been reported for both misophonia (Wu \net al., 2014 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ) and violent behaviors (Schwartz et al., \n2015 ). \n2.Method \n2.1. Participants and procedure \nParticipants included college students (N 655) enrolled at a public \nsouthern university. Students were invited to participate in an online \nquestionnaire examining stress for course credit. Upon providing con-\nsent, participants completed a battery of questionnaires. Participants \nwho endorsed sensitivity to at least one sound on the Misophonia \nQuestionnaire (Wu et al., 2014 ) were included in the current study (n \n470 of 655 unselected participants). The final sample (N 470; Mage \n18.68; SD 1.44) were primarily female (74.0%) and White (82.8%), \nwith the remainder of the sample identifying as Black/African American \n(14.5%), Hispanic/Latinx (3.0%), and Asian/Pacific Islander (2.3%). All \nprocedures were approved by this university ’s Institutional Review Board. \n2.2. Measures \nThe Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (Buss & Perry, 1992 ) is a \n29-item questionnaire measuring anger, hostility, verbal aggression, and \nphysical aggression. Statements are rated on a five-point scale ranging \nfrom 1 (“extremely uncharacteristic of me”) to 5 (“extremely charac -\nteristic of me”). Emotional and physiological preparation to express \naggression are assessed by the Anger subscale (“I sometimes feel like a \npowder keg ready to explode ”). The Hostility subscale emphasizes \ncognitive components of anger, such as thoughts of ill will towards \nanother (“I wonder why sometimes I feel so bitter about things ”). The \ntendency to engage in aggressive behaviors is evaluated by the verbal \naggression (“I can’t help getting into arguments when people disagree \nwith me”) and physical aggression (“There are people who pushed me so \nfar that we came to blows ”) subscales. The Aggression Questionnaire has \nbeen corroborated with behavioral tasks of aggression in experimental \nlaboratory studies (e.g., Chester, 2019 ; Saleem et al., 2017 ), and modest \nto strong evidence for construct validity has been demonstrated for all \nfour subscales (Buss & Perry, 1992 ). Acceptable internal consistency for \nthe subscale and total scores has been established in undergraduate \nsamples (Clements et al., 2018 ; Tremblay & Ewart, 2005 ). Internal \nconsistency coefficients in the current study were acceptable (Anger α \n0.83, Hostility α 0.91, Verbal Aggression α 0.84, Physical Aggres -\nsion α 0.79). \nThe Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3; Taylor et al., 2007 ) is an \n18-item measure of anxiety about arousal-related sensations and their \nphysical, social, and cognitive implications (e.g., “It scares me when my \nheart beats rapidly ”). Items are rated on a five-point scale, ranging from \n0 (“very little ”) to 4 (“very much ”). Items are summed to calculate a total \nscore ranging from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating greater AS. The \nASI-3 has demonstrated good internal consistency across subscales \n(Taylor et al., 2007 ; Wheaton et al., 2012 ). Cronbach ’s alpha in the \ncurrent study was excellent (α 0.94). \nThe Misophonia Questionnaire (Wu et al., 2014 ) is a three-part \nquestionnaire that assesses sensitivity to certain sounds (e.g., people \neating), emotional and behavioral reactions (e.g., anxious, distressed), \nand overall misophonia severity, respectively. This study used the total \nscore, which is derived from the first two parts of the questionnaire. \nItems are rated on a scale from 0 (\"not at all true\") to 4 (\"always true\"), \nand summed to calculate the total score, which ranges from 0 to 68. The \nfinal section of the questionnaire evaluates the severity and impairment \nof misophonia symptoms on a scale from 1 (\"minimal\") to 15 (\"very \nsevere\"), with a suggested clinical cutoff of 7 (Wu et al., 2014 ). In the \ncurrent study, 0 was incidentally included as an option to indicate no \nsound sensitivity; thus, participants rated misophonia impairment on a \n0 to 15 scale. The Misophonia Questionnaire has demonstrated good \ninternal consistency for the total score and subscales (Wu et al., 2014 ). \nInternal consistent in the current study was excellent (α 0.93). \n3.Results \n3.1. Preliminary analyses \nData were initially screened and supported the testing of current \nmodels. Means, standard deviations, ranges, and bivariate correlations \nfor the study variables are presented in Table 1. The results indicated \nthat 24.1% of the sample was above the clinical cutoff for sensitivity to \nsound (M 5.26; SD 3.08) and 6.2% reported severe/very severe \nimpact (≽10; Wu et al., 2014 ). As expected, the bivariate correlations \nrevealed significant, positive associations between the variables (rs \n0.29 - 0.36). M.J. Schadegg et al."

Primary analyses \nPROCESS 3.2.01 (Hayes, 2018 ) model 1 for SPSS was used to test \nfour moderation models to evaluate the interaction of misophonia \nseverity (predictor variable) and AS level (moderator variable) in pre-\ndicting facets of aggression (outcomes anger, hostility, verbal \naggression, and physical aggression) while controlling for sex (0 Fe-\nmale, 1 Male). All variables were mean-centered for the analyses and \nthen converted back to the original scale values for the plots. Significant \ninteractions were probed using the Johnson-Neyman technique to \nidentify points of significance and the pick-a-point technique was used \nto visualize the interaction at the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles \n(Hayes, 2018 ). \nUnstandardized conditional betas (B), standard error, F-test values, \nand p-values are reported in Table 2. The models evaluating anger, \nhostility, and verbal aggression revealed a similar pattern of results, \nwhereas a different pattern of results emerged for physical aggression. \nThe overall model was significant for anger (R2 0.19, p D.001), \nhostility (R2 0.14, p D.001), and verbal aggression (R2 0.23, p D\n.001). In each of these models, male sex was a significant predictor and \nthere were significant conditional effects of misophonia symptoms and \nAS on aggression propensity for these facets. The interaction term be-\ntween misophonia and AS was a significant predictor of anger (ΔR2 \n0.01, p .008), hostility (ΔR2 0.01, p .016), and verbal aggression \n(ΔR2 0.02, p D.001). That is, results supported the moderating role of \nAS in the relation between misophonia and each outcome (anger, hos-\ntility, verbal aggression), wherein the effect strengthened as AS scores \nincreased. The Johnson-Newman analysis indicated misophonia was a \nsignificant predictor of anger and verbal aggression at all levels of AS \nobserved in this sample, indicating that AS consistently amplified the \nassociation between these variables. For hostility, misophonia was a \nsignificant predictor at scores of AS ≽0.77, indicating significance for approximately 92.1% of scores in this sample. The interaction estimates \npredicting aggression scores at the 16th (3.00), 50th (12.00), and 84th \npercentiles (32.00) of AS are depicted in Fig. 1. \nWith regard to physical aggression, the overall model was significant \n(R2 0.19, p D.001). Significant conditional effects of male sex, \nmisophonia, and AS on physical aggression were observed; however, the \ninteraction term was not significant (ΔR2 0.00, p .102). \n4.Discussion \nThe current study investigated AS and aggression to further under -\nstand processes contributing to the experience and expression of miso-\nphonia. As hypothesized, misophonia symptoms were found to be \npositively associated with AS and each of the four facets of aggression. \nThese results are consistent with previous findings that have demon -\nstrated increased AS in misophonia samples (McKay et al., 2018 ) and \npositive associations of misophonia with aggressive behaviors (Wu et al., \n2014 ; Zhou et al., 2017 ) and AS (Cusack et al., 2018 ; McKay et al., \n2018 ). \nConsistent with hypothesis, AS moderated the association between \nmisophonia and three of the dimensions of aggression – anger, hostility, \nand verbal aggression. In addition, significant conditional effects were \nobserved, wherein male sex, greater misophonia symptoms, and higher \nlevels of AS contributed to increases in aggressive tendencies. Specif -\nically, the association between misophonia and each of these aggression \nfacets strengthened as levels of AS increased, and this interactive effect \naccounted for 1.2% unique variance in anger, 1.1% unique variance in \nhostility, and 2.0% unique variance in verbal aggression. For an indi-\nvidual with misophonia, this suggests that AS may amplify the experi -\nence of and reaction to aversive sounds and increase the likelihood that \nthey may engage in these forms of aggression. These results highlight AS \na relevant cognitive-emotional process in misophonia, which extends \nthe characterization of misophonia and informs future studies investi -\ngating key psychological mechanisms in misophonia. Furthermore, as \nindividuals with misophonia commonly describe anger and aggressive \nreactions as uncontrollable and impulsive (Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Rouw \n& Erfanian, 2018 ; Schroder et al., 2013 ), results suggest that targeting \nAS may help ameliorate these and other adverse outcomes associated \nwith misophonia. \nUnexpectedly, while physical aggression was predicted by the con-\nditional effects of male sex, misophonia, and AS, findings did not support \nAS as a factor contributing to physical aggression by magnifying miso-\nphonia reactivity. Although anger and aggressive urges are frequently \nendorsed in misophonia, the incidence of physical aggression appears to \nbe less common among adults with misophonia (Jager et al., 2020 ; \nSchroder et al., 2013 ). Consequently, the occurrence of these behaviors \nmay be explained by other factors. To further understand these behav -\niors, future work is needed to explicate various forms of aggressive re-\nsponses to misophonia cues (e.g., relational aggression; \nproactive/reactive aggression) and explore additional factors that may \nmodulate physical aggression in response to misophonia triggers, such \nas gender, context, or irrational beliefs (Archer, 2004 ; Burton et al., \n2007 ; Eagly & Steffen, 1986 ; Fives et al., 2011 ).

Of the initial sample of \nunselected undergraduate students (N 655), over 70% of individuals \nendorsed some degree of sound intolerance. Consistent with previous \nstudies, approximately 24% of participants reported clinical levels of \nmisophonia symptoms and 6% reported severe impact (Wu et al., 2014 ; \nZhou et al., 2017 ). These results illustrate the prevalence and continuum \nof misophonia symptoms. In addition, levels of AS (Chowdhury et al., \n2016 ; Wheaton et al., 2012 ), as well as anger, hostility, verbal aggres -\nsion, and physical aggression (Buss & Perry, 1992 ; D’Zurilla et al., 2003 ; \nMathes et al., 2018 ) were comparable with previous studies investi -\ngating these factors among undergraduate and community samples, \nwhich supports the generalizability of these results to other nonclinical \npopulations. \nSeveral limitations should be noted and addressed in future research. \nFirst, the generalizability of the results is limited by the predominantly \nWhite, female sample of undergraduate students. Second, the cross- \nsectional study design precludes causal determinations. Third, aggres -\nsive responses may have been underreported due to social desirability \nresponse biases (Tourangeau & Yan, 2007 ). Accordingly, a critical next \nstep is the use of experimental designs to explicate the role of AS on \naggressive responses to misophonia sounds. If supported, such findings \nhave the potential to inform investigations aimed at improving out-\ncomes for individuals with misophonia. For instance, the potential \nutility of brief AS reduction interventions is supported by research \ndemonstrating the positive impact of reducing AS on improving out-\ncomes for related conditions, such obsessive-compulsive spectrum \nsymptoms (Timpano et al., 2016 ) and tinnitus (Andersson et al., 2005 ); \nhowever, it is unclear if similar effects would be expected for aggression. Accordingly, interventions focused on increasing distress tolerance \nwarrant consideration (e.g., dialectical behavior therapy; Frazier & \nVela, 2014 ).
