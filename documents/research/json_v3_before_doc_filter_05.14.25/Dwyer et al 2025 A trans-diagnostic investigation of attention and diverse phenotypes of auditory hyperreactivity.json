Introduction  26 \nAtypical sensory experiences and behaviours are common in both Attention 27 \nDysregulation  Hyperactivity Development (ADHD)1 and Autism Spectrum Development (ASD) .  28 \nIn autism, studies  examining  autism diagnostic measures and health/educational records have 29 \nreported prevalence estimates of 72 -74% (Carson et al., 2021; Kirby et al., 2022) , and  studies 30 \nusing dedicated  sensory measures often report considerably higher prevalences (Crane et a l., 31 \n2009; Dellapiazza et al., 2018) .  Furthermore, although some studies suggest differences from 32 \ntypical sensory processing could be  more pronounced in autism than ADHD  (Little et al., 2015; 33 \nSchulz et al., 2022) , others find no or  only  modest differences between  autism and ADHD  34 \n(Cheung & Siu, 2009; Clince et al., 2016; Dellapiazza et al., 2020; Scheerer et al., 2022) .  35 \nUnfortunat ely, these common neurodivergent  experiences of sensory discomfort and distress 36 \noften have serious disabling consequences.  Indeed, sensory processing appears to be 37 \nassociated with (Lin & Huang, 2019)  or an aspect of (McConachie et al., 2020)  autistic people’s 38 \nquality of life.  In both autism  and ADHD, sensory processing appears to be related to 39 \nparticipation in activities (Engel -Yeger & Ziv -On, 2011; Ismael et al., 2018; Little et al., 2015) , to 40 \nsleep (Dwyer, Ferrer, et al., 2022; Lufi & Tzischinsky, 2014; Mimouni -Bloch et al., 2021; 41 \n \n1 Throughout this article, we endeavour to use terminology that is accurate, non -stigmatizing, and respectful of the \nidentities of marginalized groups.  For example, in light of evidence of hyper -focus in ADHD , the traditional label of \nan attention “deficit”  appears to be not only laden with derogatory value judgements,  but also to be  empirically \ninaccurate  in many contexts .  Prior commentaries and guidelines provide further detail that informed our \nterminology choices (e.g., Bottema -Beutel et al., 2021; Dwyer, 2022; Dwyer et al., 2022; Gernsbacher, 2017; \nNational Center on Disability and Journalism, 2021; Sinclair, 2013) ."

Sensory Phenotyping  44 \nAlthough many sensory measures reflect a concept of generalized “hyperreactivity” or 45 \n“hypersensitivity” in neurodivergent people (Baranek et al., 2006; Lai et al., 2019; Robertson & 46 \nSimmons, 2013) , there are likely multiple distinct constructs underlying it  (Williams et al., 47 \n2023) , even in single sensory modalities such as hearing (Jastrebo ff & Jastreboff, 2015; 48 \nWilliams, He, et al., 2021) .2  Unfortunately, it is presently unclear how these more specific 49 \nsensory constructs might differ across autism and ADHD.  50 \nOne aspect of auditory “hyper reactivity ” might be auditory distractibility : the  capture of 51 \nattention by sounds, interfering with people’s ability to concentrate on tasks, which has been 52 \nreported in both autism (Howe & Stagg, 2016; Landon et al., 2016)  and ADHD (Cassuto et al., 53 \n2013; Johnson, 2014; Oja et al., 2016) .  Such experiences of audit ory distractibility need not 54 \nnecessarily be uncomfortable or distressing.  55 \nThere also appear to be multiple varieties of decreased sound tolerance, including 56 \nmisophonia   (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2015; Williams, He, et al., 2021) .  Misophoni a is 57 \ncharacterized by strong emotional and autonomic reactions, including irritation, anger, and 58 \ndisgust, towards specific trigger sounds; the reactions are driven not by the intensity of the 59 \nsounds but by the patterns and meanings of sounds (Cavanna & Seri, 2015; Ferrer -Torres & 60 \nGiménez -Llort, 2022; Swedo et al., 2022)  and they accordingly require sound identification 61 \n \n2 Due to this complex structure, terms such as “decreased sound tolerance” or terms for specific varieties thereof \nare often used in preference to “hyperreactivity”; however, as the present study includes multiple forms of \ndecreased sound tolerance as we ll as auditory distractibility/filtering issues, we use “hyperreactivity.”"

Repetitive oral/nasal sounds (e.g., chewing) appear to be particularly 62 \ncommon or strong triggers, but other human -generated and non -human -generated sounds can 63 \nalso elicit misophonic reactions (Enzler, Loriot, et al., 2021; Hansen et al., 2 021) . 64 \nA further form of decreased sound tolerance is hyperacusis , which is sometimes defined 65 \nas reduced tolerance of sounds that are generally perceived as normal (e.g., Adams et al., 66 \n2020) , although more precise definitions of hyperacusis focus on stimulus properties such as 67 \nintensity or fr equency (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2015) , e.g., by describing hyperacusis as being 68 \ncharacterized by diminished sound tolerance a t intensity levels that are tolerated well by most 69 \npeople, resulting in experiences of increased loudness (Williams, He, et al., 202 1).  Such 70 \nexperiences are evident in both autism  (Khalfa et al., 2004)  and ADHD (Lucker et al., 1996) .  71 \nFurthermore, a subset of individuals appear to experience pain hyperacusis , or physical pain in 72 \nthe ears caused by loud sounds (Scheerer et al., 2024; Williams, He, et al., 2021) .  Autistic and 73 \nADHD people also report experiences of sensory overload  (Scheydt et al., 2017) , a construct 74 \nwhich might often be difficult to disentangle from the reduced tolerance of loud sounds 75 \ncharacteristic of hyperacusis.  In sensory overload, either excessive stimulus intensity or an 76 \nexcessive number or diversity of stimuli can cause people to become overwh elmed and to 77 \nstruggle to process information (Scheydt et al., 2017) .  This can lead to internally distressing 78 \nexperiences of “shutdown” or provoke externalizing “meltdown” reactions (Belek, 2018) . 79 \nYet another form of decreased sound tolerance is phonophobia , a specific phobia 80 \ntoward s some sounds, which is associated with anticipatory anxiety and avoidance (Williams, 81 \nHe, et al., 2021) .  Although some authors c onceptualize phonophobia  as a form of misophonia 82 \n(Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2015) , the anticipatory fear and anxiety characterizing phonophobia 83"

Thus, in practice, phonophobia may sometimes  be 87 \ndifficult to disentangle from other forms of decreased sound tolerance  (Jacquemin et al., 2024) . 88 \n1.2. Attention and Sensory Experiences  89 \nMany theories have been advanced in an effort to explain, cognitive ly or 90 \nneurobiologically, the origin of atypical sensory behaviours and experiences in 91 \nneurodevelopmental disabilities (Ward, 2018) .  Some views suggest that attention plays a 92 \ncrucial, and perhaps neglected, role (Green & Wood, 2019; Liss et al., 2006; Murray et al., 2005; 93 \nThielen & Gillebert, 2019) . 94 \nInterestingly, a lthough ADHD is canonically associated with distractibility and 95 \ninattention, ADHD people can also exhibit attentional hyper -focus , particularly in highly 96 \nengaging activities, such as “screen time” (Grotewiel et al., 2023; Hupfeld et al., 2019; Ozel -Kizil 97 \net al., 2016; Sedgwick et al., 2019) .  Meanwhi le, autism is  associated with slowness to 98 \ndisengage attention (Sacrey et al., 2014)  and with focused, intense interests  (Uljarević et al., 99 \n2022) , and it is often considered to be closely linked to hyper -focusing of attention  (Rapaport et 100 \nal., n.d.; Russell et al., 2019) .  Indeed, the autistic -developed monotropism theory  (Garau et al., 101 \n2023; Murray et al., 2005) , postulating that autism is fundamentally characterized by a narrow 102 \nfocusing of attention on a small range of targets of intense interest to a given  autistic  individual , 103 \nattracts broad support in communities of autistic adults (Warren, 2021) .  However , autistic 104 \npeople can also display enhanced processing of background  stimuli (Remington et al., 2019; 105"

The 110 \ndevelopers of the monotropism account insightfully noted this possibility , suggesting that  111 \nautistic  experiences of hypo -sensitivity to stimuli might reflect stimuli falling outside the focus  112 \nof attention, while  sensory discomfort might sometimes reflect hyper -attention to stimuli  or 113 \nstimuli exogenously disrupting  a focused attention tun nel (Murray et al., 2005 ; see also Liss et 114 \nal., 2006 ).  Similarly, diminished interoception  might sometimes reflect reduced attention 115 \ntowards bodily signals, whereas anxiety or other factors might result in heightened attention to 116 \nbodily sensations and lead to wards  somatization (Trevisan et al., 2021) .  We speculate that both 117 \nhyper -focus and susceptibility towards  distraction /inattention could be related to sensory 118 \nhyper -reactivity: that hyper -reactivity  may partly reflect susceptibility towards noticing and 119 \nexogenously directing attention towards distracting or distressing stimuli , after which hyper - 120 \nfocusing of attention and difficulty disengaging could exacerbate the experience . 121 \nIt is possible that measu res capable of more precisely distinguishing different sensory 122 \nphenotypes, such as hyperacusis and misophonia, could aid understanding of any links between 123 \nattention and sensory experiences.  For example, i t seems reasonable to suggest  that intense 124 \nmisopho nic emotional reactions would require  individuals to attend to  the sounds that trigger 125 \nthese reactions , and indeed, heightened attention to detail has been reported in misophonic 126"

Discussion  389 \nThe present study explored auditory sensory phenotypes and their relation to hyper - 390 \nfocus and inattention in autistic, ADHD,  autistic+ADHD,  and general population participants.   391 \nParticipants filled out a multidimensional questionnaire indexing a variety of distinct forms of 392 \ndecreased sound tolerance, as well as questionnaires regarding auditory distractibility issues, 393 \nhyper -focus , and inattention.  Furthermore, study participants  rated the pleasantness o f 394 \nvarious sounds, including common misophonia trigger sounds.   We investigated group 395 \ndifferences in decreased sound tolerance, auditory distractibility, and sound ratings; 396 \nconvergence of questionnaire -based and sound -rating -based misophonia measures; and 397 \nrelationships between attention and sensory phenotypes.  398 \n4.1. Group Differences in Decreased Sound Tolerance and Auditory Distractibility  399 \n4.2.1. Questionnaire Measures  400 \nGroup differences on questionnaire -based sensory measures were large and robust ; in 401 \npartic ular, autistic and ADHD participants reported  more experiences of all sound tolerance 402 \nproblems indexed  by the MIST -A than did non-autistic and non -ADHD people .  They also 403 \nreported more auditory distractibility.  404 \nMoreover, there were small -to-moderate statis tical differences among the three 405 \nneurodivergent groups (autistic -only, ADHD -only, and autistic+ADHD) , though these were 406 \nsometimes subtler and less consistent .  As predicted by Hypothesis 1, autistic -only people 407 \nreported more experiences of hyperacusis  than ADHD -only participants .

It is possible that this reflects our use of the misophonia 478 \nsubscale of a multidimensional sound tolerance questionnaire, rather than a misophonia - 479 \nspecific tool, and the lack of chewing sounds in the CDS misophonia scores from the present 480 \nstudy .  Additional ly, while Enzler et al.’s study was primarily focused on misophonia, the 481 \npresent study aimed to understand auditory processing and attention more generally in 482 \nneurodivergent groups  recruited from registries .

This supports the idea that 499 \nhyper -focus and inattention can each be involved in experiences of sensory discomfort and 500 \ndistraction.   As noted by the developers of the monotropism account, hyper -focus ing on 501 \nunpleasant stimuli might lead to  sensory distress and decreased sound tolerance (Murray et al., 502 \n2005) .  Meanwhile, a susceptibility to inattention and distraction might incr ease people’s 503 \nchances of noticing unpleasant or uncomfortable stimuli in their environments.   Further 504 \nresearch could endeavour to better understand the precise nature of these relationships by 505 \nusing cognitive and developmental tasks to isolate more specifi c attentional processes and 506 \nphenotypes that could be involved in  both  neurodivergent sensory experiences  and 507 \nexperiences of hyper -focus and/ or inattention , such as attention disengagement (Baranek et 508 \nal., 2018)  or salience -driven attention capture . 509 \nInterestingly , while  the present study was not intended to compare sensory -attention 510 \nassociations across groups, we visually noted that associations between hyper -focus and 511 \ndecreased sound tolerance seemed strongly  evident in autistic+ADHD participants ; links 512 \nbetween inattention and decreased sound tolerance  seemed weak  in that group .

This raises the possibility 524 \nthat the observed associations among  the sensory and attention  questionnaire measures might  525 \nhave reflected shared variance due to the  common  method  (Choi & Pak, 2005) ; for example, 526 \nsome participa nts may have been biased  to use certain ranges of  response options on  Likert - 527 \ntype  questions.   Fortunately, the MIST -A and AHQ both have clearly -defined response options 528 \n(e.g., an experience arises 1 -2 times per month) , which may reduce the subjectivity of 529 \nresponses .  Instead,  a key factor may be that the attention and sensory questionnaires both 530 \ninvited participants to reflect on their real -world experiences.  Real -world environments are 531 \noften complex and multisensory, and people are often  simultaneously presented with  many 532 \ndifferent possible targets of attention .

Includin g multiple stimuli, such as presenting 535 \nmisophonic triggers amidst recordings of conversations  or other stimuli , might have more 536 \nclosely replicated real -world conditions,  perhaps  allowing attention allocation to shape 537 \nindividual differences in response patt erns.  538 \n4.5.

We used ASRS -18 scores \nas calculated using “Method 4” as described by Kessler et al. (2005) , in which item responses \nare collapsed into binary scores reflecting the presence or absence of the given behaviour; \nADHD -only and autistic+ADHD participants were req uired to receive an ASRS -18 “Method 4” \nscore at least or exceeding the cut -off of 9, while autistic -only and comparison participants \nwere required to score below 9.  This yielded a reduced sample of 95 ADHD -only (7 \nCloudResearch, 88 Prolific), 110 autistic +ADHD (28 Prolific, 82 SPARK), 89 autistic -only (27 \nProlific, 62 SPARK), and 88 comparison (8 CloudResearch, 80 Prolific) participants.  \nIn the revised sample autistic+ADHD participants had slightly higher RAADS -14 scores \nthan autistic -only participants, wh ich was not the case in the original sample (Supplementary \nTable 12, cf. Table 1 in main text).  \nThe pattern of significant group differences on sound tolerance measures – particularly \nthe MIST -A and the VADQ – appeared to change.  As shown in Supplementary  Table 13 (cf. \nTable 2 in main text, Supplementary Table 10), restricting the sample based on ASRS -18 scores \nappeared to relatively increase sound tolerance problems in autistic+ADHD and ADHD -only \nparticipants compared to autistic -only participants, thereb y altering the pattern of statistical \ndifferences among the neurodivergent groups.  All statistical differences between ADHD -only \nand autistic -only participants disappeared, while autistic+ADHD participants began to score"

Thus, eliminating ADHD -only participants scoring above the autism cut -off \nwould remove the majority of ADHD -only participants, and would be unlikely to yield a \nrepresentative sample of ADHD people.  Nevertheless, for exploratory and descriptive \npurposes, we took the previou sly-described reduced sample (as restricted based on ASRS -18 \nscores) and eliminated ADHD participants scoring above the autism screening cut -off on the \nRAADS -14.  This reduced the ADHD -only sample to just 22 participants (3 CloudResearch, 19 \nProlific), fro m the 95 in the previously -described reduced sample.  \nThis further -reduced ADHD -only sample had significantly more educated participants \nthan in the autistic+ADHD group (Supplementary Table 15), which was not the case of the \noriginal sample in the main text  nor of the previously -described reduced sample (Table 1, \nSupplementary Table 12).  They had significantly lower ASRS -18 inattention scores than \nautistic+ADHD participants, but their hyperactivity/impulsivity scores no longer significantly \ndiffered from th ose of autistic+ADHD participants.  The proportion of ADHD -only participants \nself-reporting misophonia appeared lower than in prior analyses (Supplementary Table 15, cf. \nTable 1, Supplementary Table 12), and the proportion no longer significantly differed from that \nin comparison participants.  \nEliminating ADHD participants with high RAADS -14 scores affected results of \ncomparisons of sound tolerance measures across groups (Supplementary Table 16, cf. Table 2, \nSupplementary Tables 10, 13).  Interactions of ADH D and autism on many MIST -A subscores"

However, the use of ASRS -18 scores to restrict the sample had previously caused \nADHD -only participants’ sensory questionnaire scores to increase relative to autistic -only \nparticipants (compare Table 2 and Supplementary Table 10 with Supplementary Table 13), so \nthese declin es to some extent acted to offset the previous increase.  For example, statistical \ndifferences between ADHD -only and autistic -only participants’ MIST -A impairment scores that \nhad appeared in Supplementary Table 10, then disappeared when ASRS -18 scores were  used to \nrestrict the sample (Supplementary Table 3), reappeared when ADHD -only participants with \nhigh RAADS scores were excluded (Supplementary Table 16).  \nEffects of ADHD on total and breathing/nasal sound CDS scores dropped below the \nthreshold for statis tical significance, but this change appeared in large part to reflect sample \nsize and power rather than changes in the underlying effect (Supplementary Table 17, cf.
