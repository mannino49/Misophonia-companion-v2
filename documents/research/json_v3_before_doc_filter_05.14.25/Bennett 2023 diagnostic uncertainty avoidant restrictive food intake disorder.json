Malnutrition is an identified medical cause of psychosis and in patients \nwith ARFID, symptoms mirroring psychosis could be secondary to weight loss versus a “true” thought disorder. \nConversely, dietary restriction has been demonstrated in patients with psychosis, which conceivably, could result \nin the development of ARFID. In this case report, we present a medically hospitalized adolescent male with \nsevere malnutrition, diagnosed with ARFID after 12-months of food avoidance due to sensory sensitivities and \nfears of gastrointestinal discomfort. A significant decline in his emotional, interpersonal, and cognitive func-\ntioning was also reported and attributed to severe malnutrition. With nutritional rehabilitation, the patient ’s \neating behaviors and mental state unexpectedly declined, and he was ultimately diagnosed with comorbid \npsychosis.   \nIntroduction \nResearch demonstrates a significant association between symptoms \nof psychosis and disordered eating (Brodrick et al., 2020 ; Ganson et al., \n2022 ; Mensi et al., 2020 ; Miotto et al., 2010 ; Solmi et al., 2018 ). How-\never, prior studies have not described co-occurring psychosis and avoi-\ndant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). Introduced in DSM-5 \n(American Psychiatric Association, 2013 ), ARFID is characterized by \nfood avoidance secondary to sensory aversions (e.g., food taste, texture), \nfears that eating will result in aversive consequences (e.g., vomiting, \nchoking, gastrointestinal pain), food neophobia, and/or low appetitive \ndrive in the absence of weight and/or appearance related concerns (Brig-\nham et al., 2018 ; Norris et al., 2014 ). \nFood avoidance has also been described in the context of psychosis \n(Poletti et al., 2022 ). For example, paranoia about food contamination \nand/or olfactory hallucinations that make food unpalatable can trigger \ndietary restriction, conceivably resulting in the development of ARFID. \nFor some, ARFID symptoms could also reflect prodromal signs of psy-\nchosis (Kelly et al., 2004 ), insofar as a functional decline can preempt \nillness onset (Seidman et al., 2010 ). For example, distinct sensory fea-\ntures have been described prior to the onset of psychosis, including \ngreater sensory sensitivities, sensory avoidance, and reduced sensory seeking (Parham et al., 2019 ) that could trigger food avoidance and a \nsubsequent ARFID diagnosis. \nRecognizing co-occurring psychosis and ARFID has unique chal-\nlenges. In ARFID, severe dietary restriction can result in malnutrition \nand serious medical sequelae (Feillet et al., 2019 ; Nitsch et al., 2021 ). \nMalnutrition is an identified medical cause of psychosis with cognitive, \nemotional, and neurobiological changes that mirror those evidenced in \nclinical psychosis. For example, individuals with malnutrition and/or \nclinical psychosis can demonstrate withdrawal and avoidance, mood \nchanges, and emotion dysregulation (Merritt et al., 2020 ), delayed \nprocessing speed, impaired reasoning and decision making (Fonville \net al., 2014 ; Van den Eynde et al., 2012 ), atypical sensory processing \n(Saure et al., 2022 ), global visuospatial deficits and biased detail pro-\ncessing (Mountjoy et al., 2014 ; Solmi et al., 2018 ), and progressive \nreduction of cortical gray matter (Kerem and Katzman, 2003 ; Olabi \net al., 2011 ; Van den Eynde et al., 2012 ). Thus, in severely malnourished \nindividuals with ARFID, symptoms approximating psychosis may be \nsolely conceptualized as malnutrition sequelae and in cases of “true” \nco-occurring psychosis, could negatively impact treatment planning and \nprognosis. \nHerein, we present an adolescent male who was medically hospi -\ntalized for severe bradycardia in the context of ARFID.

Upon admission, the patient reported treatment \nmotivation and slowly increased his nutritional intake. However, with \nweight gain and the resolution of bradycardia, he became progressively \nagitated and withdrawn, with a notable regression in his eating behav -\niors, prompting discharge to an inpatient psychiatric facility upon sta-\nbilization. Ultimately, the patient reported imminent safety concerns \nand disclosed symptoms of comorbid psychosis. \nCase presentation \nA 16-year-old white cisgender male presented to the emergency \ndepartment of a pediatric medical center in the United States for severe \nabdominal pain and constipation in the setting of a 22.3 kg weight loss, \nor 30% of his total body weight. Assessment indicated severe and critical \nbradycardia to 27 beats per minute, prompting admission to the pedi-\natric intensive care unit. Elevated transaminase and prolonged coagu -\nlation were also noted. After five days, he was transferred to the \nhospital’s adolescent medicine eating disorder service, where he \nreceived specialized, multidisciplinary care. \nUpon hospitalization, the patient’s diet was limited to liquids and \nsoft foods, including cream of rice, oatmeal, bananas, apples, and a \nspecific type of protein bar, which he heated in the microwave to soften. \nHe had begun restricting his diet 12 months prior, when he and his \nimmediate family (including his biological parents and fraternal twin \nbrother) collectively started a vegetarian diet. Although his family \nmembers resumed eating meat within a few weeks, the patient described \nmeat as “repulsive” and maintained the vegetarian diet. (Notably, there \nwere no prior concerns with eating meat.) The next few months, he \ndeveloped numerous sensory aversions, including chewing sounds and \nspecific smells, flavors, textures, and food combinations, resulting in his \navoidance of many foods and situations that involved eating. He artic-\nulated a genuine fear of eating many foods and was emphatic that his \nlimited diet was “safer.” He began experiencing gastrointestinal \ndiscomfort which further reinforced food avoidance. He became \nincreasingly isolated, refusing to be in the company of others when they \nate and refusing to eat when others were present. He reported that peers \nbegan making unkind comments about his eating behaviors, prompting \ndistress and avoidance of social situations. (In confidence, his mother \ndescribed the patient as socially hypersensitive; she believed that his \npeers had expressed concern about his health.) \nThe patient had no prior psychiatric, medical, or developmental \nproblems. Previously described as kind and shy, the patient had become \nincreasingly sad and irritable over the past year. Sleep difficulties were \nalso noted. He was an above average student with no history of learning \nor attention problems yet in recent months, had struggled to concen -\ntrate, pay attention, and make decisions. Socially, the patient was \ndescribed as an introvert who had a few friends but preferred spending \ntime alone or with his twin brother. His family history was notably \nsignificant for obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, and schizo -\nphrenia, all in second-degree relatives. Upon admission, he presented as \ncachectic yet well-groomed, and appeared his stated age. He was \nguarded with providers, with minimal speech, limited eye contact, and \nblunted affect. When asked direct questions, he demonstrated a long \nresponse time which although not formally assessed, appeared consis -\ntent with cognitive processing delays. His responses were limited to \n“yes” or “no” and he provided minimal details to open-ended questions. \nFollowing admission, underlying medical causes of the patient’s \ngastrointestinal concerns and cardiac complications were ruled out. A \nprimary diagnosis of ARFID was given, insofar as food refusal was sec-\nondary to sensory aversions and fear of anticipated gastrointestinal \ndiscomfort, in the absence of weight and/or shape concerns. Comorbid \npsychiatric diagnoses were tentatively ruled out in the absence of pre-\nmorbid mental health concerns, coupled with the onset of functional \nimpairment (e.g., emotional changes, social isolation, concentration \ndifficulties) after he began losing weight. As such, his recent functional decline was conceptualized as a consequence of severe malnutrition. \nFurther, sensory aversions were tentatively classified as misophonia, a \ncondition characterized by strong emotional reactions (e.g., irritation, \ndisgust, anger) and autonomic arousal to specific auditory, visual, and/ \nor sensory triggers resulting in a hyperfocus on and/or avoidance of cue- \nrelated stimuli (Swedo et al., 2022), most often developing in childhood \nor early adolescence (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018). The patient’s experi -\nence of worsening sensory sensitivity with the progression of weight loss \nwas also attributed to malnourishment, since atypical sensory process -\ning and heightened sensory sensitivity/vigilance are associated with \ngreater malnourishment (Saure et al., 2022; Zucker et al., 2013). Finally, \nthe patient’s gastrointestinal symptoms were considered secondary to \ndietary changes and weight loss, consistent with research highlighting \nthis association (Norris et al., 2014). \nOf note, there was family history of schizophrenia, and the medical \nteam considered the possibility of a burgeoning psychotic illness. \nHowever, the patient’s severely malnourished state precluded a valid \nassessment of “true” versus medically induced symptoms of psychosis. \nThus, medical stabilization and nutritional rehabilitation were priori -\ntized before psychosis could be ruled out. \nThe primary goal of hospitalization was the resolution of the pa-\ntient’s acute medical complications. Given risks for refeeding syndrome, \na standard refeeding protocol was implemented upon admission, \nincluding a slowly advanced, calorie-controlled diet with intensive \nmedical monitoring and per needed supplementation. Initial meetings \nwith the psychologist focused on psychoeducation about ARFID, with an \nemphasis on nutritional rehabilitation via volume before variety (e.g., \nmeeting caloric needs by consuming an adequate volume of preferred \nfoods before increasing the variety of foods consumed; Brigham et al., \n2018). Providers encouraged the patient to consume nutrition by mouth, \nbut he was very anxious and requested that nasogastric (NG) feeds be \nused to supplement his oral intake. Although NG feeds can foster \nongoing food avoidance in patients with ARFID and prolong hospitali -\nzation (Feillet et al., 2019; Strandjord et al., 2015), his providers lacked \nconfidence that he could meet caloric needs orally. Given his critical \nmedical condition, an NG tube was placed and considered a short-term, \nlife-saving intervention. \nSecondary goals of the hospitalization included: 1) weaning off NG \nfeeds and consuming all nutritional requirements orally; 2) learning and \nimplementing skills to manage gastrointestinal discomfort; 3) beginning \nexposure-based interventions to increase the variety of foods consumed; \nand 4) eating in the presence of others. Discharge disposition would be \ncontingent on the patient’s progress toward secondary goals, with op-\ntions for outpatient psychotherapy or inpatient psychiatric treatment. \nUpon NG placement, the patient consumed a small proportion of his \ndaily calories by mouth, restricting his intake to “safe” foods like \noatmeal, ice cream, and bananas. He disliked the NG tube and was \nmotivated for its removal. With encouragement, he agreeably increased \nhis intake of liquid supplements and “safe” foods over the first ten days \nof hospitalization. NG feeds were concurrently weaned and ultimately \ndiscontinued. The patient’s affect brightened significantly, and he was \nmore engaged with providers. Gastrointestinal concerns were denied \nduring this time and the patient declined offers to learn pain manage -\nment strategies for any future discomfort. \nFollowing NG removal, the psychologist introduced exposure-based \ninterventions, including the development of a fear hierarchy and initi-\nating low-level exposures to prime the patient and family for future \noutpatient interventions. The patient lacked insight into ARFID-related \nconsequences; he was emphatic that avoiding foods did not cause \nimpairment and that having a very limited diet would not have future \nconsequences. He was unable and/or unwilling to identify any potential \nbenefits of exposures and declined participation. A reward system was \nimplemented and per needed hydroxyzine (10 mg) was prescribed, yet \nthe patient’s resistance to exposures intensified. Whereas moderate \nresistance to exposure-based interventions among individuals with \nanxiety is common (Selles et al., 2013), the patient’s objections were N. Bennett and A. Matthews"

However, his persistent avoidant \nbehaviors were extreme and severely impairing. His inability and/or \nunwillingness to participate in exposures while in a controlled and \nsupportive environment (i.e., the hospital) did not bode well for suc-\ncessful outpatient treatment. His mother was encouraged to set clear \nexpectations for the patient to complete exposures and to integrate \nfeared foods into his diet. If these expectations were not met, discharge \nto an inpatient psychiatric program would be recommended, where the \npatient could receive intensive treatment. The patient expressed frus-\ntration about the plan but agreed to participate because he wanted to go \nhome. He ultimately agreed to do an exposure of holding crunchy cereal \nin his hands. His mother was present during the exposure and received \ncoaching to assist with these interventions at home. The patient \nappeared highly anxious during the exposure and was fidgety while \nholding the cereal. He reported a significant decline in anxiety over ten \nminutes and immediately asked the provider to leave his room when the \nexposure was completed. \nThe patient declined participation in additional exposures and was \nsurprisingly agreeable to a psychiatric hospitalization upon medical \nstabilization. He acknowledged the need for additional help but was \nunwilling to engage in additional evidence-based treatments for anxiety \nduring his medical stay. He became increasingly irritable and with-\ndrawn over the next two weeks, refusing to talk with providers and \ndeclining visits with staff and family. His eating behaviors also \nregressed; he stopped eating “safe” foods, instead drinking liquid sup-\nplements to fulfill caloric requirements. He implored that providers \nplace another NG tube, reporting that eating was “too hard,” yet unable \nto articulate why. His mental and behavioral decline were unexpected \nconsidering a 7.6 kg weight gain and adequate resolution of brady -\ncardia. His providers began to question the presence of co-occurring \npsychosis, particularly given the patient’s family history of \nschizophrenia. \nAfter 36-days of medical hospitalization, the patient was transferred \nto an inpatient adolescent psychiatric unit with specialized eating dis-\norder treatment. He agreed to integrate new foods into his diet, \nreporting motivation to go home. Over nine days, he decreased his \nintake of liquid supplements, consumed a greater volume of “safe” \nfoods, and added a few more foods to his repertoire. items. He gained an \nadditional 3.3 kg and was discharged to outpatient cognitive behavioral \ntherapy (CBT) with family participation. \nOne month after discharging home, the patient reported suicidal and \nhomicidal ideation, visual and command auditory hallucinations, and \nparanoia at a weekly therapy appointment. He was readmitted to the \ninpatient psychiatric unit and was formally diagnosed with comorbid \npsychosis. These symptoms were not previously disclosed because the \npatient was afraid to talk about them and believed that they were his \n“own” thoughts. \nDiscussion \nAccurate diagnosis is imperative for illness conceptualization, \ntreatment planning, and optimal outcomes in psychiatric treatment. \nThis novel case highlights the potential for symptom overlap in psy-\nchosis and ARFID and demonstrates the potential to overlook co- \noccurring psychosis in severely malnourished patients with ARFID. As \nsuch, it is recommended that diagnostic assessment be a dynamic pro-\ncess, conducted over the course of weight restoration. Malnutrition can \n“mask” comorbid psychopathology (Brodrick et al., 2020) and nutri-\ntional rehabilitation is required to rule out co-occurring psychosis in \nARFID. \nIn this case, the patient’s functional decline was initially attributed to \nmalnutrition. However, with weight gain it became increasingly evident that these impairments were neither solely nor primarily due to signif -\nicant weight loss. Upon diagnosis of comorbid psychosis, the patient’s \ntreatment plan was shifted to prioritize evidence-based safety planning, \nmedication management, and CBT for psychosis and ARFID. \nIn the described case, identification of comorbid psychosis was \nimperative for accurate symptom conceptualization and treatment \nplanning. However, earlier detection of psychosis would not have \naltered his medical admission. For severely malnourished adolescents, \nevidence-based treatment necessitates that weight restoration and \nmedical stabilization take precedence over psychotherapy for eating \ndisorders and comorbidities (Lock and LeGrange, 2015). As such, if the \npatient had been diagnosed with comorbid psychosis upon hospitaliza -\ntion, initial interventions would have still prioritized nutritional reha-\nbilitation and medical stabilization prior to psychotherapy. However, \ndiagnostic conceptualization and treatment recommendations would \nhave differed. \nConclusion \nThis case report highlights the potential for comorbid psychosis and \nARFID. In cases of clear symptom overlap, accurate conceptualization \nand diagnosis may be hindered by severe malnutrition which is a \nmedical cause of psychosis. Ongoing psychiatric assessment throughout \nthe weight restoration process is critical for diagnostic accuracy and \noptimal treatment planning.
