Introduction\nMisophonia, derived from the Greek roots miso-(meaning “hatred”) and -phonia (mean-\ning “sound”), is a condition characterized by intense negative emotional reactions—such\nas irritation, anger, or disgust—when individuals encounter specific “trigger” sounds [ 1].\nCommon triggers often include human-generated sounds such as chewing, slurping, sniffing,\nand throat clearing [ 2], as well as repetitive noises from objects like pen clicking or keyboard\ntyping [ 3]. Beyond emotional discomfort, these reactions are often accompanied by increased\nautonomic arousal, leading to significant distress [ 4]. To manage this discomfort, individu-\nals with misophonia may avoid situations where triggers are present or endure them with\ngreat difficulty [ 2]. Over time, this avoidance and distress can cause profound functional\nimpairments, disrupting daily life and social interactions. Despite growing awareness of\nthis condition, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, specific to the realm of au-\nditory processing, and their broader perceptual consequences remain poorly understood,\nunderscoring the need for further research.\nNeurophysiological studies have begun to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of\nmisophonia, shedding light on both cortical and functional anomalies associated with this\ncondition. Research using fMRI has consistently highlighted hyperactivity in the anterior\ninsular cortex (AIC; a key region in the salience network) in response to misophonic trigger\nsounds (e.g., [ 5]). This hyperactivity is accompanied by increased functional connectivity\nbetween the AIC and regions involved in emotional processing and regulation (e.g., ventro-\nmedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex), suggesting an exaggerated salience\nassigned to specific sounds in individuals with misophonia [ 5]. Furthermore, the anterior\ncingulate cortex (ACC; involved with top-down executive control) and superior temporal\ncortex have also shown hyperactivity, indicating a broader network dysfunction in response\nto misophonic stimuli [6].\nOn the electrophysiological front, Aryal and Prabhu [ 7] recently observed significant\ndifferences in the latency of P1 and N1 peaks of Auditory Late Latency Responses (ALLRs)\nbetween individuals with misophonia and controls. These latency differences suggest that\nindividuals with misophonia may experience delayed or altered cortical processing of\nauditory stimuli. Similarly, Schröder et al. [ 8] investigated auditory processing in miso-\nphonia patients using auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) during an oddball task.\nThey found that misophonia patients exhibited a smaller mean amplitude of the N1 peak\nin response to oddball tones compared to controls, with no significant differences in the\nP1 and P2 components. Importantly, no differences were observed in ERP components\nin response to standard tones, indicating that the deficits in misophonia are specific to\nchange detection mechanisms in the auditory cortex, rather than reflecting broader auditory\nprocessing impairments.\nGiven this evidence, the mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm provides a strong ratio-\nnale for investigating auditory processing deficits in misophonia, as it is a well-established\ntool for assessing automatic change detection mechanisms in a repetitive auditory con-\ntext [ 9]. Individuals with misophonia exhibit intense emotional responses to specific audi-\ntory triggers, and MMN, which operates without conscious attention, could reveal how\nthese individuals’ brains respond to “deviant” sounds that deviate from the expected norm,\nproviding insights into heightened sensitivity or aversive reactions to certain stimuli [ 10].\nMMN is also closely tied to sensory memory processes, requiring the formation of short-\nterm memory traces to compare incoming auditory stimuli against the established auditory\ncontext [ 11]. In misophonia, a diminished MMN may indicate a disrupted sensory memory\nsystem that fails to appropriately filter and encode auditory stimuli. Such deficits could\ncause certain sounds to be perceived as disproportionately salient, exacerbating emotional\ndistress. In this study, MMN was utilized to investigate how these auditory processing"

Further, our analysis that focuses on the N1 peaks elicited\nby the standard and deviant stimuli, latency, and amplitude difference between the N1\npeaks of the standard and deviant waveforms provides insights into early neural responses\nto acoustic changes. This metric helps compare findings with Schröder et al. [ 8], who\nreported that individuals with misophonia exhibit a selective reduction in N1 response to\ndeviant stimuli, thereby diminishing the N1 amplitude difference between standard and\ndeviant waveforms.\nWhile the neurophysiological basis of misophonia has been increasingly studied, with\nsome research highlighting altered cortical activity in affected individuals, the perceptual\nconsequences of these neural changes remain largely unexplored. In particular, how in-\ndividuals with misophonia process speech under adverse listening conditions—such as\nnoisy or acoustically challenging environments—has received limited attention. Since indi-\nviduals with misophonia do not typically exhibit peripheral auditory processing deficits,\nany difficulties in speech perception are likely to stem from central processes, particularly\nthose involved in auditory scene analysis [ 12,13]. The spatial release from masking (SRM)\nparadigm is well suited to investigate these central mechanisms, as it examines how indi-\nviduals segregate target speech from background noise based on spatial cues [ 14–18]. By\ncomparing SRM performance in individuals with and without misophonia, this study aims\nto illuminate the perceptual challenges that characterize this population.\nCognitive operations, especially attention, are fundamental to the perception and\nprocessing of sensory stimuli, enabling individuals to focus on relevant information while\nsuppressing distractions. In misophonia, the attentional process is often disrupted due to\nabnormally increased sensitivity to specific trigger sounds [ 19,20]. This increased vigilance\ntowards aversive sounds can impede the ability to allocate attention to other important\nstimuli, resulting in difficulties in task performance and broader cognitive functioning.\nThe attentional deficits observed in individuals with misophonia—such as an exaggerated\nfocus on trigger sounds—suggest that cognitive resources are disproportionately allocated\nto these stimuli, thereby reducing the capacity to engage with other aspects of the environ-\nment [ 21]. To further investigate these attentional mechanisms in misophonia, we employed\nthe flanker task, a controlled method for assessing selective attention. This task presents\ndistracting stimuli (flankers) alongside a central target stimulus, requiring participants to\nfocus on the target while inhibiting attention to the flankers [ 22,23]. We hypothesized that\nindividuals with misophonia would exhibit greater difficulty disengaging attention from\nthe flankers. This would suggest that their attention deficits are not confined to auditory\nstimuli alone but may extend to broader, domain-general cognitive processes.\nIn summary, this study aimed to investigate the neurophysiological, perceptual, and\ncognitive mechanisms underlying misophonia. Three tasks were utilized: ERP measure-\nments to assess automatic change detection in auditory processing, the SRM paradigm to\nexamine speech segregation in the presence of background noise, and the flanker task to\nevaluate selective attention and cognitive control. These tasks collectively offer a detailed\nunderstanding of the neural and perceptual impairments associated with misophonia.\n2. Method\n2.1. Participants\nAn a priori power analysis (effect size, d= 0.25, α= 0.05) indicated that a total sample\nsize of 24 participants (12 per group) would be required to achieve a statistical power of\n0.8. To ensure a sufficiently powered study, 35 participants (2 males, 33 females; age range:\n18–30 years, M= 24 years, SD= 3 years) were recruited via word of mouth and social media.\nHowever, due to abnormally high electrode impedances during data collection, reliable\nERP responses could not be recorded for two participants, leading to their exclusion from"

This resulted in a final sample of 33 participants, with 16 assigned to the con-\ntrol group (1 male, 15 females; M= 24.37 years, SD= 1.76 years) and 17 to the misophonia\ngroup (1 male, 16 females; M= 23.94 years, SD= 2.94 years). Each participant was screened\nfor misophonia using the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S; Schröder et al. [ 3]).\nThe A-MISO-S, based on the Yale–Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale ( Y-BOCS ), includes\nsix items assessing overall symptoms, distress, interference, effort to resist, control over\nsymptoms, and avoidance [ 3]. Participants were placed in either the experimental (miso-\nphonic) group or control group based on their A-MISO-S score ( 0–4 subclinical ,5–9 mild ,\n10–14 moderate, 15–19 severe, 20–24 extreme). Scores of 5 and above indicated misophonia.\nParticipants were blinded to the outcome of the A-MISO-S screening and were not informed\nof their group allocation to ensure unbiased participation in the study. Participants also\ndescribed scenarios where they encountered triggers, such as in classrooms and at home,\nand their reactions (e.g., “anger (extreme)”, “extremely uncomfortable”, “anxiety/panic\nattack”, “flee the environment”, “irritated”, “distress”, “disgust”), aligning with diagnostic\ncriteria [ 24–28]. In total, 16 participants were included in the control group (1 male, 15 fe-\nmales, aged 24, M= 24, SD= 2), and 19 in the misophonic group (1 male, 18 females, aged\n24,M= 24, SD= 3), with an average A-MISO-S score of 9. Within the misophonic group,\n11 participants scored in the mild range, 4 in the moderate range, 1 in the severe range, and\n1 in the extreme range.\nParticipants were screened for hearing deficits through otoscopic inspection, tympa-\nnometry, and standard pure-tone audiometry. Written informed consent was obtained from\nall participants in accordance with the Towson University Institutional Review Board (IRB\n#1717, approved on 21 April 2022), Towson, MD, USA. Participants were compensated at a\nrate of USD 15 per hour for their time. Payment was issued in the form of gift cards upon\ncompletion of the study session.\n2.2. ERP: Stimuli, Acquisition Parameters, and Response Analyses\nERP recordings were conducted using a pair of stimuli following an oddball paradigm\n(i.e., standard and deviant stimuli). The stimulus pair consisted of a 600 Hz tone presented\nbinaurally. Each stimulus had a total duration of 200 ms, including a 30 ms rise time, a\n140 ms steady-state plateau, and a 30 ms fall time. The standard stimulus was an unaltered\n600 Hz tone delivered to both ears. The deviant stimulus featured the same 600 Hz tone\nbut with a 15◦phase shift (equivalent to 0.2618 radians) applied to the right channel. This\nphase difference corresponds to a small temporal delay relative to the left channel over the\n600 Hz tone’s period (~1.67 ms). All stimuli were generated using MATLAB version 2024\n(MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).\nThe MMN response waveforms were obtained using a Duet two-channel SmartEP\nsystem (Intelligent Hearing Systems, Miami, FL, USA). Stimuli were presented at 70 dBnHL\nin an ‘oddball’ paradigm, with the standard stimulus occurring 80% of the time and the\ndeviant stimulus 20% of the time. The stimuli were presented in rarefaction polarity, with a\nrepetition rate of 1.1/s. Responses were averaged over 200 sweeps of deviant stimuli and\n800 sweeps of standard stimuli, within a time frame of −50 to 500 ms relative to stimulus\noffset. A bandpass filter with a frequency range of 0.1 to 30 Hz was applied, and the signal\nwas amplified up to 50,000 times. Stimuli were presented binaurally to each participant.\nParticipants were seated comfortably to minimize muscular artifacts and engaged\nin watching a subtitled movie without sound to ensure a passive listening state. Each\nparticipant was informed about the preparation and placement process of the electrode\nmontage (2-channel, vertical montage). Before electrode placement, the skin was cleansed\nusing an exfoliating gel, and an electrolytic paste was applied for electrode attachment. The\nelectrodes were securely affixed using micropore tape in the designated regions according"

Foam insert earphones were placed in each participant’s ears for a binaural\nsetup. Participants were instructed to remain quiet and focus solely on the movie content,\ndisregarding any acoustic stimuli delivered through the earphones. Impedance levels were\nconfirmed before each run (3–5 runs), maintaining less than 5 k Ωfor absolute impedance\nand below 2 k Ωfor inter-electrode impedance.\nAll ERP waveforms elicited by the standard and deviant stimuli were visually in-\nspected, and the peak latencies and amplitudes were manually identified and marked for\nsubsequent analysis. This manual marking ensured accuracy and consistency in capturing\nthe electrophysiological responses across participants. The normative latency ranges for\neach ERP peak were referenced based on established guidelines to standardize interpreta-\ntions. For the standard stimuli, the P1, N1, and P2 peaks were observed at approximate\nlatencies of 50 ms, 100 ms, and 200 ms, respectively. These values align with expected\nauditory cortical responses to simple auditory stimuli under normal conditions [ 28]. For\nthe deviant stimuli, the same peaks typically appeared within similar latency ranges, al-\nthough slight shifts in latency and amplitude were occasionally observed, likely reflecting\nstimulus-specific neural processing.\nTo isolate components related to auditory deviance detection, difference waveforms\nwere calculated by subtracting the ERP elicited by standard stimuli from that elicited by\ndeviant stimuli for each trial. Subsequent analyses focused on two primary negative peaks:\n∆N1 and MMN. ∆N1 was defined as the difference in latency and amplitude between the\nN1 peaks of the standard and deviant waveforms, typically occurring within the 80–120 ms\nlatency range. In contrast, MMN was identified as a distinct negative deflection in the dif-\nference waveform, occurring within the 150–250 ms latency range. MMN amplitude was\ncalculated as the difference between the N2 peak elicited by deviant stimuli and the cor-\nresponding segment of the standard waveform [ 9]. This measure reflects neural processes\ninvolved in the automatic detection of auditory irregularities. In addition to amplitude mea-\nsures, we analyzed the latencies of individual ERP components and difference waveforms.\nThe latency analyses provided complementary insights into the temporal dynamics of neu-\nral responses [ 29], offering a detailed perspective on the temporal dynamics of auditory\nprocessing and potential deficits associated with misophonia.\n2.3. SRM Paradigm\nThe speech corpus recorded at Boston University’s Hearing Research Center [ 15] was\nused to assess SRM. This corpus contained sentences composed of five monosyllabic words\nthat are syntactically correct but semantically unpredictable. Prior research has shown\nthat access to semantic cues may obscure the observation of any potential relationship\nbetween misophonia and speech perception. The target (and the masker) sentences in\nthis corpus had the structure <name> <verb> <number> <adjective> <object> (e.g., Jane\nfound five red toys), with each word being randomly selected from 8 possible options.\nThe target always contained the <name> call-sign “Jane” with other keywords being\nrandomly selected from other available choices. The target was always presented in the\ncenter (0◦azimuth), while the maskers were either colocated with the target at 0◦azimuth or\nspatialized at ±15◦(spatially separated). The spatial locations of the target and background\nspeakers were simulated by applying non-individualized head-related transfer functions\n(HRTFs) to the test stimuli, downloaded from an MIT website (sound.media.mit.edu). The\ntarget/masker voices (female voice: f0 = 175–200 Hz) varied across trials but remained\nthe same within each given trial. The stimuli were generated in MATLAB version 2024\n(MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) on a PC and played using a Lynx Hilo sound card"

The masking stimuli were fixed at\n70 dB SPL, while the target signal level was adaptively adjusted using a one-up, one-down\ntracking procedure to determine the Target-to-Masker Ratio (TMR) threshold corresponding\nto 50% correct performance. SRM was quantified by subtracting the TMR threshold of\nthe spatially separated condition from that of the colocated condition, representing the\nimprovement in speech perception due to spatial separation. The methodology for stimulus\npresentation and response analysis for SRM has been detailed in recent studies conducted by\nour laboratory [ 30–33]. Participants were tasked with identifying target sentences beginning\nwith the call-sign “Jane”, always delivered from the center. Each trial featured a randomized\npairing of target and masker voices, consistent within a given trial. Practice runs for both\nconditions were conducted to familiarize participants with the task. The experiment used a\nfixed set of conditions, and the target–masker configurations were randomized to minimize\npredictability effects.\n2.4. Flanker Task\nThe flanker test was conducted using the Psychology Experiment Building Language\n(PEBL version 2.0.4) platform (The PEBL Project, Fairfax, VA, USA) [ 34]. In this task, par-\nticipants were presented with a central stimulus and tasked with identifying its left–right\norientation while actively disregarding surrounding stimuli, referred to as ‘flankers’ [ 35]. The\nprimary objective was to determine whether the centrally located arrow pointed to the left or\nright, while ignoring the orientation of the surrounding arrows [ 36]. The surrounding arrows\nwere either congruous, where the target stimulus and distracting stimuli were associated\nwith the same response (e.g., all arrows pointing in the same direction), or incongruous,\nwhere the target stimulus and distracting stimuli were associated with different responses\n(e.g., the central arrow pointing left while flankers point right) [ 37]. The key manipulation in\nthis task was the congruency of the target stimulus and its flankers.\nEach participant underwent 160 trials, with accuracy and response times recorded.\nThese measurements served as indicators of cognitive attention, in line with the methodol-\nogy detailed by Zelazo et al. [ 38]. The task setup is straightforward, with stimuli shown for\nan unlimited time until the participant responds to advance to the next trial. The stimuli\nwere typically composed of a target image in the center flanked by one or more distractor\nstimuli on either side. Completion times for the flanker task were scored separately for\ncongruent, incongruent, and conflict cost conditions. To account for potential confounding\nfactors such as motor skills, visual acuity, and processing speed, a differential measure\ntermed conflict cost was employed. Conflict cost was calculated by subtracting the total\ncompletion times for congruent trials from those for incongruent trials, providing a more\ntargeted assessment of attentional control [ 35]. Higher conflict costs would indicate greater\ndifficulty in filtering out irrelevant distractors and focusing on the target stimulus, suggest-\ning weaker attentional control. Conversely, lower conflict costs demonstrate an enhanced\nability to manage interference and maintain focus. By analyzing conflict cost, this study\naimed to gain insight into the attentional processes that may be disrupted in individuals\nwith misophonia.\n2.5. Testing Procedure\nThe participants’ testing journey began with audiometric assessments to establish\nbaseline hearing thresholds. Following this, the A-MISO-S scale was used to assess the\nseverity of misophonia symptoms, providing context for individual differences in miso-\nphonia severity.

The SRM\nparadigm followed, where participants’ ability to segregate speech from background noise\nwas tested. By measuring SRM, this task evaluated how well participants could perceive\nspeech in noisy environments, highlighting potential challenges faced by individuals with\nmisophonia in real-world listening situations. Finally, participants engaged in the flanker\ntask, which assessed cognitive control and attentional processes. The conflict cost measure\nwas used to examine participants’ ability to filter distractions and focus on the target stim-\nulus, offering insights into the attentional challenges that may be present in individuals\nwith misophonia.\n3. Results\n3.1. Audiometric Characteristics and Misophonia Severity\nAll participants enrolled in the study exhibited symmetrical hearing abilities bilaterally,\nwith interaural asymmetries of 10 dB HL or less across all tested frequencies. Figure 1 illus-\ntrates the audiometric thresholds for both the control and misophonia groups. Figure 1A,B\ndisplay individual audiograms, along with mean audiograms averaged across ears, for\nthe control group and the misophonia group, respectively. Thin colored lines represent\nthe hearing thresholds of individual participants, while bold lines highlight the group\nmean thresholds. Notably, all participants displayed thresholds within the normative range\n(≤20 dB HL). Figure 1C compares the individual and mean PTA thresholds between the\ntwo groups. A mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to compare au-\nditory thresholds between the two test groups. Test frequency served as the within-subject\nfactor, while subject group served as the between-subject factor. The results revealed a\nsignificant main effect of test frequency [ F(7, 217) = 1.01, p= 0.04, η2= 0.03]. However, the\nmain effects of participant group [ F(1, 31) = 0.27, p= 0.61, η2= 0.01] and its interaction\nwith test frequency [ F(7, 217) = 2.01, p= 0.60, η2= 0.06] were not statistically significant.\nPost hoc pairwise comparisons indicated that intergroup differences were not statistically\nsignificant at any of the test frequencies (all p> 0.05). These findings suggest similar audio-\nmetric thresholds across all tested frequencies for both participant groups. Additionally,\nthe pure-tone averages (PTAs) were calculated for each participant and compared between\nthe control (M = 4.33, SD = 3.44) and misophonia (M = 5.5.04, SD = 3.01) groups using an\nindependent-sample t-test. The results showed no significant difference in PTA between\nthe two groups ( t(31) = −0.39, p= 0.70, Cohen’s d = 0.08). The mean PTAs are depicted in\nFigure 1C.\nThe distribution of individual A-MISO-S scores (unfilled circles) and the group mean\nscore (filled circle) are presented in Figure 2, highlighting both the variability within the\nsample and the average severity of misophonia. Error bars represent ±1 standard error\n(SE). For reference, the degree of misophonia severity, as defined by Schröder et al. [ 8], is\nalso indicated, providing context for interpreting the severity levels within the sample. This\nvisualization underscores the range of experiences among participants while situating the\ngroup mean within established severity thresholds. It is evident from the figure that all\nparticipants in the misophonia group exhibited clinically significant misophonia, as indicated\nby their total A-MISO-S scores falling within the range of 5 to 24. The mean A-MISO-S\nscore among these participants was calculated at 8.89, demonstrating a considerable level of\nsymptom severity across the sample, with individual scores ranging from 5 to 23."

Two independent t-tests were performed to compare the ∆N1 and MMN\nresponse amplitudes between the control and misophonia groups. The first t-test re-\nvealed a significant reduction in ∆N1 amplitudes in the misophonia group compared\nto the control group ( t(31) = −4.90, p< 0.01, Cohen’s d =−1.52). Similarly, the second\nt-test demonstrated a significant reduction in MMN amplitudes in the misophonia group\n(t(31) = −7.63,p< 0.01 ,Cohen’s d =−2.38). These findings suggest that both ∆N1 and\nMMN response amplitudes were significantly diminished in individuals with misophonia\ncompared to controls. The mean ∆N1 and MMN amplitudes for each group are depicted in\nFigures 3B and 3C, respectively.\nFigure 4 shows the mean ERP latencies for the control and misophonia groups across\nstimulus conditions.

Panels C and D illustrate the individual data distribution (unfilled cir-\ncles) and mean latencies for ∆N1 and MMN responses, respectively, in both groups. Aligned\nwith the ERP amplitude analyses, we conducted two separate mixed-design ANOVAs to\ncompare ERP peak latencies across participant groups: one for standard tones and another\nfor deviant tones. For standard tones, the analysis revealed a significant main effect of ERP\ncomponent [ F(3, 96) = 1126.14, p< 0.001, η2= 0.97], indicating that response latencies varied\nsignificantly across the different ERP components. However, neither the main effect of\ngroup [ F(1, 31) = 0.05, p= 0.82, η2< 0.001] nor the interaction between ERP component and\ngroup [ F(3, 93) = 0.44, p= 0.72, η2= 0.01] was statistically significant.

Nonsignificant correlations\nare not marked with asterisks.\nOne of the hypotheses of this study was to assess whether individuals with misophonia\nexhibit speech perception deficits. The group comparison results indicated no significant\ndifference in SRM between the groups. Notably, no correlation was also found between SRM\nand A-MISO-S scores, suggesting that misophonia severity was not associated with speech\nperception in noise. Furthermore, ERP components were not significantly correlated with\nSRM, indicating that the physiological deficits observed at the cortical level in individuals\nwith misophonia, as reflected by the ERP measures, did not necessarily translate into\nperceptual deficits in speech perception.\nAdditionally, no correlation was found between A-MISO-S scores and either ∆N1\nlatency or MMN latency. Although the amplitudes of these ERP components were reduced\nin individuals with misophonia, the latencies were not significantly altered, suggesting that\nmisophonia severity was not associated with changes in the timing of neural responses.\nFinally, the PTAs were not correlated with any of the measures used in the study. More\nimportantly, neither ∆N1 amplitudes nor MMN amplitudes were correlated with PTA\nvalues, suggesting that the observed individual differences in cortical responses were not\ndriven by differences in audibility. Instead, these differences appear to reflect variations in\nmisophonia severity.\n4. Discussion\nWhile significant progress has been made in recognizing and establishing diagnostic\ncriteria for the condition, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms driving miso-\nphonia remain elusive. One area of conflict is understanding how the brain processes\nauditory stimuli in individuals with misophonia compared to those without the condition.\nThe objective of this study was to delve deeply into the various facets of physiological,"

Hearing Sensitivity Is Unaffected by Misophonia\nIn this study, no findings consistent with individuals with misophonia having hear-\ning loss were observed. Both individual and group audiograms revealed that pure-tone\naverages did not differ significantly between individuals with and without misophonia.\nThis aligns with previous research indicating that no significant hearing loss is typically ob-\nserved in individuals with misophonia. Other studies have similarly found no substantial\nevidence of hearing disorders among individuals with misophonia [ 3,4,39]. For instance,\nJager et al. [ 4] found that hearing loss prevalence in individuals with misophonia was lower\nthan in the general population, suggesting misophonia is not closely linked to hearing loss.\nSimilarly, Siepsiak et al. [ 39] reported no significant differences in pure-tone thresholds or\nloudness discomfort levels between individuals with misophonia and healthy controls, fur-\nther supporting the absence of a direct association between misophonia and hearing ability.\nAryal and Prabhu [ 7] also compared hearing thresholds in individuals with and without\nmisophonia across standard (0.25–8 kHz) and extended high frequencies (9–16 kHz). Their\nresults showed similar hearing abilities in both groups, indicating that misophonia may\nnot affect auditory sensitivity. Thus, the findings of this study are consistent with this body\nof research and contribute to the growing literature supporting the absence of significant\nhearing loss in individuals with misophonia.\n4.2. Misophonia Severity: Consistency with Existing Research\nThe average severity of misophonia symptoms in our study participants was 8.89 on\nthe A-MISO-S scale, which falls within the mild range, consistent with Schröder et al. [ 3].\nSimilar findings have been reported in previous studies, where 35% to 50% of individu-\nals in help-seeking or student samples exhibited mild symptoms. For example, Naylor\net al. [ 40] found that clinically significant misophonic symptoms were common, affecting\n49.1% of their sample in the U.K. Within this experimental group, 37% of participants\nexperienced mild symptoms, 12% had moderate symptoms, and 0.3% had severe symp-\ntoms, with no extreme cases identified. Our study’s findings are consistent with Aryal\net al. [ 7], who researched the Indian population and found that the majority of partici-\npants with misophonia exhibited mild symptoms (22.35%). The A-MISO-S questionnaire\ndemonstrated good internal consistency and validity for assessing misophonia symptoms\namong the student population at Towson University. These results suggest that while a\nsignificant number of individuals experience mild symptoms, only a small subset exhibit\nsevere symptoms. Overall, the severity levels observed in our study align with those\nreported in previous population-based research, highlighting the representative nature of\nour misophonia sample.\n4.3. Physiological Correlates of Misophonia\nThe most significant finding of this study was the significantly reduced mean ampli-\ntude of the auditory N1 and N2 waves in individuals with misophonia compared to the\ncontrol group. This reduction in N1 amplitude was observed solely in response to deviant\nstimuli, with no significant differences for standard stimuli. Consequently, the derived ∆N1\nand MMN response amplitudes, calculated from the N1 amplitudes, were also significantly\ndiminished in the misophonia group.\nThese findings suggest that misophonia may involve irregular processing of specific\nauditory stimuli, particularly those perceived as deviant or unexpected. Our study aligns\nwith Schröder et al. [ 8], who also observed a reduction in the N1 amplitude in response to\noddball tones in individuals with misophonia. In their study, regularly repeated 1000 Hz"

Similarly, we found\nno significant differences in the P1 and P2 components elicited by oddball tones, and\nthe latencies of these ERP components were unaffected, mirroring Schröder et al.’s [ 8]\nfindings. Furthermore, our study provides additional evidence that, in individuals with\nmisophonia, not only is the N1 amplitude diminished in response to deviant tones, but\nthe N2 component is also reduced. This further supports the notion that misophonia may\ninvolve altered neural processing of unexpected auditory stimuli.\nSchröder et al. [8] proposed two possible explanations for the reduced N1 amplitude\nobserved in individuals with misophonia: increased mood disturbance and psychiatric\ncomorbidities. Misophonia patients in their study reported significantly higher mood dis-\nturbance scores, suggesting a state of general hyperarousal. This heightened arousal could\npotentially diminish attention to sounds, explaining the reduction in N1 amplitude. They\nalso considered the influence of psychiatric comorbidities and psychotropic medication,\nfactors not assessed in our study, which may have impacted the N1 response (and possibly\nN2) in the misophonia group. The N1 component is crucial in studies of auditory attention,\nparticularly in disorders like schizophrenia, where attenuated N1 responses have been\nfrequently observed. N1 and N2 is believed to serve as a marker for early attention to\nsensory changes [ 41] and may help identify significant auditory events [ 42]. However, our\nstudy found no behavioral evidence of attention deficits in misophonia participants, as\nassessed by the flanker task. This suggests that attentional impairments in misophonia, if\npresent, might be too subtle to detect through behavioral measures.\nAdditionally, since the flanker task primarily assesses visual attention, it may not\nbe sensitive enough to detect auditory attention deficits specific to misophonia. A task\ndesigned to assess auditory attention would likely provide better insight into the attentional\nmechanisms involved in misophonia. Regarding ERP component latencies, no significant\ngroup differences were observed, consistent with Schröder et al. [ 8]. These findings suggest\nthat misophonia may not be associated with alterations in the timing of neural responses\nas measured by ERP components. However, Aryal and Prabhu [ 43] reported shortened\nlatencies of early ERP components, particularly P1 and N1, in misophonia patients, sug-\ngesting increased activity in subcortical auditory structures. Our study did not observe this\nshortening, which may be attributed to methodological differences. Specifically, while we\nused an oddball paradigm, Aryal and Prabhu [ 43] employed a standard 500 Hz tone burst\nstimulus, which could explain the discrepancy in latency findings.\nIn summary, our findings contribute to the growing body of research on misopho-\nnia’s neurophysiological mechanisms, particularly its impact on the processing of deviant\nauditory stimuli. Further research is needed to explore the potential role of subcortical\nauditory structures and refine our understanding of how misophonia affects attention and\nsensory processing.\n4.4. No Evidence of Perceptual Deficits in Misophonia\nIn our study, speech perception abilities were similar across participant groups, and\nmisophonia was not found to be associated with deficits in speech perception in noise.\nThis lack of association could be explained by two possibilities. First, the altered cortical\nfunctions associated with misophonia may not significantly impact the ability to perceive\nspeech in noisy environments. This would suggest that the neural mechanisms involved\nin misophonia are separate from those involved in speech processing in noise. Second,\nthe speech task used in this study may not have been sensitive enough to detect more\nsubtle perceptual deficits in individuals with misophonia. The SRM task might not have\nadequately challenged participants or captured the specific auditory processing issues\nthat individuals with misophonia experience. To our knowledge, no study has systemati-"

This underscores the need\nfor further research to explore the potential impact of misophonia on speech perception\nabilities, particularly under varied listening conditions. A conference proceeding by investi-\ngated speech perception in noise among individuals with misophonia and reported deficits\nin noisy environments [ 44]. However, detailed methodological information (e.g., stimuli\nused, severity of misophonia, comorbid status of the participants) is lacking, making it\nchallenging to directly compare their findings with ours. These discrepancies in method-\nological parameters across studies could contribute to differences in outcomes regarding\nthe relationship between misophonia and speech perception abilities. Therefore, further\nresearch with well-defined methodologies and comprehensive assessments is needed to\nbetter understand the impact of misophonia on speech perception.\n5. Limitations\nWhile this study offers valuable insights into the potential impact of misophonia on\nauditory function, it is important to acknowledge several limitations that could affect the\ninterpretation of the findings. Firstly, the relatively small sample size of 33 participants\n(17 misophonics, 16 control subjects) raises concerns about the generalizability of the\nresults. A larger and more diverse sample could enhance the statistical power of the study,\nallowing for more robust conclusions and better detection of subtle differences between\ngroups. Secondly, the study exclusively focused on college students, which may not\naccurately represent the broader population affected by misophonia. Misophonia can affect\nindividuals of all ages and backgrounds, and limiting the study to this demographic may\nrestrict the applicability of the findings to other age groups or populations. Furthermore, the\nstudy did not account for potential comorbid conditions that could influence physiological\nmeasurements. Misophonia often coexists with other psychiatric or neurological disorders,\nsuch as anxiety or obsessive–compulsive disorder, which could confound the results.\nFuture research should consider controlling these comorbidities to better isolate the effects\nof misophonia on auditory function. Similarly, another limitation of this study is that we\nneither asked participants nor explicitly screened for the presence of tinnitus or hyperacusis.\nAs these conditions could influence auditory cortical potentials and confound the findings\nin the misophonia group, this should be considered when interpreting the results. Future\nstudies should account for these factors to more accurately isolate the neural and perceptual\neffects of misophonia.\nAnother key limitation of the present study is that cognitive status was assessed\nsolely with the flanker task, which, while informative, does not provide a comprehen-\nsive evaluation of overall cognitive function. Therefore, conclusions about participants’\ngeneral cognitive status cannot be made based on this test alone. Similarly, ERP anal-\nysis focused only on cortical responses to standard and deviant tones, specifically the\nP1-N1-P2-N2 components. This limits the scope of the findings, as it does not include the\nbrainstem or other auditory and cognitive potentials that may provide a fuller picture of\nmisophonia-related neural processes. Future research should include a wider range of\nneurophysiological measures for a more complete understanding of the neural mechanisms\ninvolved in misophonia.\nLastly, the use of the A-MISO-S questionnaire as the primary measure of misophonia\nseverity relies on self-reporting, which introduces the possibility of response bias or inaccu-\nrate reporting. Individuals may under-report or over-report their symptoms, leading to\npotential inaccuracies in the assessment of misophonia severity. Supplementing self-report\nmeasures with objective measures of misophonia, such as physiological assessments or\nbehavioral observations, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the con-\ndition.

Conclusions\nThe results of this study suggest selective deficits in cortical event-related ERPs in\nindividuals with misophonia, specifically reduced amplitudes of the N1 and N2 compo-\nnents in response to deviant stimuli, compared to the control group. While these findings\nprovide an electrophysiological basis for misophonia, no perceptual consequences were\nobserved, particularly in terms of speech perception or cognitive function. Despite the\naltered cortical processing associated with misophonia, participants did not exhibit signifi-\ncant differences in hearing thresholds, speech perception abilities, or cognitive function\ncompared to controls. These results indicate that while misophonia may involve distinct\nneurophysiological changes, it does not necessarily lead to perceptual deficits in speech\nperception or cognitive function, suggesting that the disorder primarily affects neural\nprocessing without significantly impacting perceptual outcomes.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.P ., E.W., P .P . and N.K.S.; Methodology, C.P ., P .P . and\nN.K.S.; Software, N.K.S.; Formal analysis, C.P ., E.W. and N.K.S.; Data curation, E.W.; Writing – original\ndraft, C.P ., E.W., P .P . and N.K.S.; Writing – review & editing, C.P ., E.W., P .P . and N.K.S.; Supervision,\nC.P .; Funding acquisition, C.P . and N.K.S.
