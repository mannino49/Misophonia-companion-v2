As a novel way to relax and\ncreate pleasant feelings, ASMR might offer\npossible mental health-related bene ﬁts compara-\nble to bene ﬁts that have already been demon-\nstrated for other relaxation-associated techniques\n(e.g., Mindfulness: Creswell, 2017 ; Yoga: Field,\n2011 ; Progressive muscle relaxation [PMR]:\nMcCallie et al., 2006 ; or Autogenic Training\n[AT]: Seo & Kim, 2019 ).

      "text": "detail as yet, the initial evidence available on\nvarious ASMR-related topics, offers the oppor-\ntunity to provide a ﬁrst systematic overview of the\nexisting scienti ﬁc research. Unsystematic review\narticles on the topic of ASMR have already been\npublished (e.g., Ahuja, 2013 ;Andersen, 2015 ;\nHarper, 2020 ;Niven & Scott, 2021 ;Reddy &\nMohabbat, 2020 ;N. Smith & Snider, 2019 ).\nOne of these articles provides a brief, structured\noverview of the current state of ASMR research\n(Reddy & Mohabbat, 2020 ), however, without\naddressing the various de ﬁnitions, assessment\ntools, and interventions related to ASMR\nresearch. By contrast, our review will extend\nthis work both in terms of methodology and\ncontent: We aim to review the current state of\nASMR research systematically and comprehen-\nsively. To this end, we will give an overview on\ndeﬁnitions and assessment tools of the phenome-\nnon, psychological, neural, and physiological\nASMR correlates as well as ASMR interven-\ntions according to the Preferred Reporting Items\nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses\nguidelines ( Page et al., 2021 ).\nMethodology\nSelection Process\nA systematic search was conducted by Tobias\nLohaus (TL) in March 2022. Three different\ndatabases (Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of\nScience) were consulted. The search syntaxes\nfor each database are presented in Box 1 . After\nduplicates were removed from the search results,\ntheﬁrst step in the selection process was to screen\nthe titles and abstracts of the articles for a thematic\nﬁt (only articles that actually addressed the\nautonomous sensory meridian response were\nconsidered). This screening was done by the\nﬁrst author TL and supported by two master ’sstudents that were trained in the application of\nthe screening criteria by TL. In the next step, a\nfull-text evaluation of the remaining articles was\ncarried out, with the senior author Patrizia Thoma\n(PT) being consulted in cases of uncertainty, for\nexample, if it was not immediately obvious\nwhether an article met the more speci ﬁc inclusion\ncriteria that will be described in the following\nparagraph.\nEligibility Criteria\nThe following inclusion criteria (IC) were\nselected before conducting the systematic search:\nIC1: The study addressed the autonomous\nsensory meridian response.\nIC2: Studies that implemented original\nempirical investigations were included,\nbut overviews, commentaries, letters, key-\nnotes, corrections, or qualitative research\nwere not.\nIC3: Only articles accepted in a scienti ﬁc\njournal were considered (the discipline was\nnot speci ﬁed; psychological articles were\nincluded as well as articles from medical or\neconomic ﬁelds).\nIC4: Only articles written in English were\nincluded.\nData Extraction Process\nTo obtain an overview of the de ﬁnitions and\nassessment tools of the phenomenon, an integra-\ntive overview was created through the careful\nevaluation of the individual ASMR articles. In\nterms of the other areas covered in this systematic\nreview (psychological, neural, and physiologi-\ncal ASMR correlates and ASMR interven-\ntions), authors TL and Sarah C. Schreckenberg\n(SS) summarized the results associated withThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\nBox 1\nSyntax of Applied Search Criteria (ASMR, Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) in (a) Pubmed, (b)\nSCOPUS, and (c) Web of Science\n(a) (“Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response “[All Fields] OR“ASMR ”[All Fields])\n(b) (“Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response ”OR“ASMR ”)\n(c) ALL =(“Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response ”OR“ASMR ”)2 LOHAUS, SCHRECKENBERG, BELLINGRATH, AND THOMA"

A small adjustment was made so that\nthe instrument could be used not only for cross-\nsectional studies but also for almost all other\nstudy designs. To this end, Item 3 ( “Was the\nexposure measured in a valid and reliable way? ”)\nwhich cannot be applied to the many studies\nwithin the systematic review that do not contain\nexposure and Item 4 ( “Were objective, standard\ncriteria used for measurement of the condition? ”)\nwhich is only designed for patient samples were\nexcluded, facilitating applicability to the rather\nlarge number of studies with very different study\ndesigns retrieved in this systematic review. The\nﬁnal selection of items included in this review can\nbe found in Supplemental Table S1 . In addition to\nthe evaluation of risk of bias, other items were\ncreated that assess the quality of the articles\nwritten about the studies instead of themethodological quality of the studies themselves.\nFor this purpose, our research team developed\nﬁve items presented in the Supplemental Table S1\n(e.g., “Is the interpretation of the results coherent\nand plausible? ”). The risk of bias items and article\nquality items were rated by author TL and a\nmember of the research team who was trained\nwith regard to the scoring by TL. For each study, a\ntotal quality score was calculated, ranging from 0\nto 11, corresponding to the total number of items.\nThe interrater reliability for the total scores\ndetermined on the basis of all included studies\nwas .88.\nResults\nThe results of the search and selection process\nare presented in a ﬂow diagram ( Figure 1 ).\nImplementing the search syntaxes described\nabove in the three different databases, a total of\nn=1,139 studies were retrieved. Removing\nduplicates, n=540 records remained that were\nscreened based on the titles and abstracts of the\narticles. Numerous articles were immediately\nexcluded since ASMR was not mentioned in the\ntitle or abstract of the articles (IC 1). N=105 were\nultimately assessed in more detail. At the next\nstep, it was a mis ﬁt in relation to IC 1 –4 that\nled to exclusion (see Figure 1 , for more details).\nAlthough the initial search did not restrict\nwhether the research was published in a peer-\nreviewed journal or whether it was a preprint, we\nsubsequently decided to restrict this criterion so\nthat only peer-reviewed articles and no preprints\nwere included in the ﬁnal analyses in this review\n(excluding 10 articles for this reason, 1 preprint\nand 9 nonpeer-reviewed articles). Ultimately, n=\n49 articles were included based on the speci ﬁed\nscreening process. Five articles were additionally\nincluded resulting from screening the reference\nlists of these 49 articles, leading to a total number\nofn=54 studies. An overview of the data from\nthe individual studies compiled for this review,\nincluding the main results of each study, can be\nfound in Table 1 .\nWith regard to the methodological quality of\nthe studies and the articles written about these\nstudies (see Table 2 ), it is striking that the authors\nof this article considered the overall quality to\nbe rather inconsistent ( M=6.93, SD=2.65,\nminimum =0, maximum =11; based on the\nrating conducted by author TL).

Limitations of Evidence. ”In the\nfollowing paragraphs, the ﬁndings of the included\nstudies will be summarized and integrated.\nDeﬁnition and Assessment Tools\nASMR De ﬁnition\nWhen it comes to ASMR de ﬁnitions presented\nwithin the 54 assessed articles, the ﬁrst aspect that\nstands out is that a large number of articles cite\none of the ﬁrst articles dealing with ASMR on a\nscienti ﬁc level, a source by Barratt and Davis\n(2015) . It describes ASMR as a tingling, static-\nlike sensation on the skin that spreads across\nthe skull and the back of the neck and that is\naccompanied by a feeling of relaxation and\nwell-being.\nGiven the components of the original de ﬁni-\ntion by Barratt and Davis (2015) , it appears that\nthe ASMR phenomenon in general is best\ndescribed from two different perspectives: On\nthe one hand, when de ﬁning ASMR it is possible\nto describe the sensory perception of ASMR. On\nthe other hand, one can describe what a personfeels on an emotional level when experiencing the\nASMR phenomenon.\nHowever, further descriptive elements of\nASMR are introduced via other de ﬁnitions. An\noverview of the different de ﬁning components of\nASMR that are presented in the articles included\nin this systematic review is given in Table 3 .I n\nterms of the sensory perception, the de ﬁnition is\nextended to encompass more body parts than\nthe skull and back of the neck (e.g., spine and\nperipheral body parts such as arms or limbs)\noriginally focused on by Barratt and Davis\n(2015) . Despite these additions of further body\nparts, the head and neck are to be regarded as the\ncore areas where the ASMR experience occurs. In\nterms of the ASMR-related feeling, additional\nphenomenological descriptions of the ASMR\nexperience can also be found in other de ﬁnitions\nprovided by the authors of the studies uncovered\nin this systematic review. For example, in ten\ncases, a feeling of euphoria is described ( Janik\nMcErlean & Banissy, 2017 ;Keizer et al., 2020 ;\nG. L. Poerio et al., 2022 ;Roberts et al.,\n2019 ,2020a ,2020b ,2021 ;Rouw & Erfanian,\n2018 ;Seifzadeh et al., 2021 ;X. Wang et al.,\n2020 ). Furthermore, ASMR is described as\ncalming in ﬁve cases ( Idayati et al., 2021 ;This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.Figure 1\nPRISMA 2020 Flow Diagram for Systematic Search (Conducted in March 2022)\nNote.

      "text": "Palmer-Cooper et al., 2022 ;G. L. Poerio et al.,\n2018 ;S. D. Smith et al., 2019a ;Swart, Banissy, et\nal., 2022 ). In addition, a sense of psychological\nstability is named in three cases as de ﬁning\nelement of ASMR ( Ahn, 2020 ;Ahn et al., 2019 ;\nM. Lee et al., 2019 ), and in three other cases, a\nfeeling of comfort is described ( Roberts et al.,\n2019 ,2020a ,2021 ). Other experiences that have\nbeen described are pleasure or pleasantness (e.g.,\nAhn, 2020 ;Ahn et al., 2019 ;Chae et al., 2021 ;\nHonda et al., 2020 ;M. Lee et al., 2019 ;Tian et al.,\n2020 ) and peace of mind ( Jeong, 2020 ).\nIn addition to naming the sensory and\nemotional characteristics of ASMR, the de ﬁni-\ntion of ASMR can only be complete if informa-\ntion is also provided on how ASMR can be\ntriggered. With regard to naming exemplary\nASMR triggers in the introduction of the articles\nretrieved in this systematic review, many authors\nagain refer to a few articles, primarily again\nBarratt and Davis (2015) . When considering\nthe triggers used most often in the studies\nretrieved, the following pattern emerges: whis-\npering (14), role play (11), tapping (9), personal\nattention (8), nature sounds (5, see Table 1 ).\nHowever, rather than counting how many\nstudies used a speci ﬁc trigger, it seems more\nmeaningful to highlight those articles that\nhave explicitly investigated which triggers\nmost reliably elicited ASMR. This has been\ndone in the studies conducted by Barratt and\nDavis (2015) andBarratt et al. (2017) .T h e s e\nauthors concluded that complex and lower\npitched sounds ( B a r r a t te ta l . ,2 0 1 7 )a sw e l la s\nwhispering, personal attention and crisp sounds\n(Barratt & Davis, 2015 ) in particular proved to\nbe reliable ASMR triggers.\nASMR Assessment Tools\nIn terms of the instruments designed to\nassess ASMR, the systematic search highlighted\ntwo different instruments, namely the ASMR-15\n(Roberts et al., 2019 ) and the ASMR-Experience\nQuestionnaire (AEQ; Swart, Banissy, et al.,\n2022 ). While the ASMR-15 is a rather conven-\ntional questionnaire that assesses the ASMR\nexperience by means of 15 items that can be\nassigned to different ASMR subfacets (Altered\nConsciousness, Sensation, Relaxation, Affect),\nthe AEQ is an online questionnaire encompassing\n14 different questions related to several ASMR\nvideos. It thus captures an assessment of theASMR experience directly related to the ASMR\nvideos presented. In addition, a body map is\nintegrated in the AEQ to determine the bodily\nASMR experience as accurately as possible.\nFurthermore, since it appears that not everybody\nis able to experience ASMR (responder rates vary\nfrom 28% to 38%; Roberts et al., 2020a ;Swart,\nBanissy, et al., 2022 ), the AEQ aims at\ndifferentiating people who can experience\nASMR (ASMR-responders) from those who\ncannot (ASMR-nonresponders) offering a classi-\nﬁcation into ﬁve different groups: ASMR-Strong,\nASMR-Weak, Control +, Control-,False-Positive.\nASMR-strong, and ASMR-weak can be consid-\neredasASMR-responders,andControl +,Control-\nand False-Positive as ASMR-nonresponders with\nFalse-Positive describing those who experience a\nsensory response to ASMR stimuli that is not in\naccordance with the typical ASMR characteristics.\nWhile the ASMR-15 presents the 15 items only\nonce, several AEQ items are repeated for each\nindividually presented video. The internal consis-\ntency of the ASMR-15 was α=.78 in the initial\nstudy conducted by Roberts et al. (2019) .I n\nstudies conducted later, this αvalue was reached\nagain ( G. L. Poerio et al., 2022 )o rw a se v e n\nexceeded ( Morales et al., 2021 :α=0.90; Roberts\net al., 2020a :α=0.92). For the AEQ, no measure\nof internal consistency is provided as yet.\nPsychological Correlates\nSeveral studies have investigated which\npersonality traits are associated with ASMR\nusing correlational analyses. With regard\nto the Big Five ( Costa & McCrae, 1988 ),\nASMR correlates positively with Openness-to-\nExperience ( B. Fredborg et al., 2017 ;Janik\nMcErlean & Banissy, 2017 ;Roberts et al., 2020b )\nand Neuroticism ( Eid et al., 2022 ;B. Fredborg et\nal., 2017 ), but negatively with Conscientiousness\n(B. Fredborg et al., 2017 ;Janik McErlean\n& Banissy, 2017 ,Roberts et al., 2020b ),\nAgreeableness ( B. Fredborg et al., 2017 ), and\nExtraversion ( B. Fredborg et al., 2017 ). Besides\nthe Big Five, some other personality related\nconstructs have been linked to ASMR, such as\nincreased sensory processing sensitivity ( G. L.\nPoerio et al., 2022 ;Roberts et al., 2020b ),\nheightened cognitive reappraisal scores ( Morales\net al., 2021 ), higher trait anxiety ( Eid et al., 2022 ),\nand more pronounced self-rated empathy ( Janik\nMcErlean & Banissy, 2017 ).This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.AUTONOMOUS SENSORY MERIDIAN RESPONSE REVIEW 41"

      "text": "Regarding mindfulness, contradictory results\nemerge in different studies. One study ( B. K.\nFredborg et al., 2018 ) shows signi ﬁcantly higher\nmindfulness-scores in ASMR-responders. In\nthis study, this refers on the one hand to the\nability to be aware of and pay attention to the\npresent moment (assessed with the Mindful\nAttention and Awareness Scale [MAAS];\nBrown & Ryan, 2003 ) and on the other hand\nto curiosity about sensations, thoughts and\nemotions that arise when being in a mindful\nstate (Toronto Mindfulness Scale [TMS]; Lau et\nal., 2006 ). On the other hand, Janik McErlean\nand Osborne-Ford (2020) report no correlation\nbetween mindfulness and ASMR (for ASMR-\nresponders) while Roberts et al. (2021) report a\nnegative correlation. In both studies, the MAAS\nwas again used.\nGiven that ASMR is a somewhat complex\nphenomenon, it is also interesting to investigate\nhow ASMR is related to similar experiences, for\nexample, frisson (i.e., pleasant shivers or chills\nthat can be triggered by movies, music or video\ngames; Kovacevich & Huron, 2019 ), misophonia\n(i.e., the negative reaction to speci ﬁc sound\npatterns and/or sounds occurring in certain\nsettings or situations; Jastreboff & Jastreboff,\n2014 ) or synesthesia (i.e., the phenomenon of\nexperiencing perceptions in a sensory modality\ntriggered by a stimulus from a different sensory\nmodality; Casini, 2017 ). Although it is discussed\nthat ASMR is a component of frisson ( Koumura\net al., 2021 ) or vice versa ( Honda et al., 2020 ),\ncorrelation analyses do not support this assump-\ntion ( Roberts et al., 2019 ,2020a ). Examining the\nassociation between ASMR and misophonia,\ninconsistent results emerge, with one study\nrevealing a relationship ( Janik McErlean &\nBanissy, 2018 ; ASMR-responders), which could\nnot be con ﬁrmed in the another study ( Roberts et\nal., 2019 ; ASMR interest group). No study\nretrieved in the search conducted for this\nsystematic review examined a possible correla-\ntion between ASMR and synesthesia.\nFurthermore, until now, when it comes to mere\ncorrelational approaches, ASMR experience has\nnot been correlated with any mental health-\nrelated variables. However, a number of associa-\ntions between ASMR and mental health-related\nvariables have been uncovered in the context of\nshort-term interventions, which are presented in\nthe Intervention Studies section.Neural and Physiological Correlates\nNeural Correlates\nWith regard to the possible neural under-\npinnings of ASMR, both EEG (seven studies, B.\nK. Fredborg et al., 2021 ;M. Lee et al., 2019 ;\nPaszkiel et al., 2020 ;Pedrini et al., 2021 ;\nSeifzadeh et al., 2021 ;Swart, Banissy, et al.,\n2022 ;Tian et al., 2020 ) and fMRI studies (seven\nstudies, S. Lee et al., 2020 ;Lochte et al., 2018 ;\nSakurai et al., 2021 ;S. D. Smith et al., 2017 ;S. D.\nSmith et al., 2019a ,2019b ,2020 ) were carried out\non the phenomenon. In the ASMR-related EEG\nstudies, recording was always performed during\nASMR stimulation. It has not been attempted as yet\nto obtain a speci ﬁc EEG resting-state activation\npattern for ASMR-responders compared to ASMR-\nnonresponders. The results appear largely incon-\nsistent so far, with some tentative suggestions of\npossible decreases in the δband during ASMR\nstimulation. In the following paragraphs, the\nresults will be described separately for the different\nfrequency bands with the order of the discussion\nreﬂecting the consistency of the evidence addres-\nsing the respective frequency band.\nOnly one study analyzing δwaves, M. Lee et\nal. (2019) investigating 15 participants and\ncomparing brain activity during ASMR sound\nstimulation (among other conditions) to a resting-\nstate baseline, yields no changes in δpower\nduring ASMR stimulation. All other four studies\n(Pedrini et al., 2021 ;Seifzadeh et al., 2021 ;Swart,\nBanissy, et al., 2022 ;Tian et al., 2020 ) that\nexplicitly investigated the in ﬂuence of ASMR on\nδpower show a decrease in δactivity. However, it\nhas to be noted that both Tian et al. (2020) and\nSeifzadeh et al. (2021) investigated a very low\nnumber of participants (four vs. one). They\ncompared the respective brain activities post-\nASMR stimulation to a resting-state period as\nbaseline. Both studies reveal a globally declined δ\nband. Involving a more sizable number of\nparticipants ( n=26), Swart, Banissy, et al.\n(2022) compared how the EEG pattern differs\nbetween a self-reported unchanged state (base-\nline) compared to self-reported ASMR experi-\nence, yielding a decrease of δspeciﬁcally in\nprefrontal areas. Finally, Pedrini et al. (2021)\ncompared brain activity while watching ASMR\nvideos not only to a resting-state condition as\nbaseline but also to brain activity while watchingThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.42 LOHAUS, SCHRECKENBERG, BELLINGRATH, AND THOMA"

      "text": "three different other video types (high arousal,\nlow arousal, control; n=76). Interestingly, they\nshow lower δvalues for watching ASMR videos\ncompared to the three other video types used, but\nnot in comparison to the resting-state condition.\nαwaves were assessed in seven studies ( B. K.\nFredborg et al., 2021 ;M. Lee et al., 2019 ;Paszkiel\net al., 2020 ;Pedrini et al., 2021 ;Seifzadeh et al.,\n2021 ;Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022 ;Tian et al.,\n2020 ). The previously mentioned studies by Tian\net al. (2020) andSeifzadeh et al. (2021) involving\nvery small sample sizes reveal a signi ﬁcant α\nincrease post-ASMR versus resting state\n(Seifzadeh et al., 2021 , especially in the central\nregion). However, Seifzadeh et al. (2021) also\nreport an αband power decrease in the occipital\nregion. Again involving a small sample ( n=9),\nPaszkiel et al. (2020) used music triggering\nASMR and compared it to three different\nconditions during which EEG recordings were\ncarried out (relaxing music, rap music, and\nsilence). Additionally, they included a phase\nduring which a stressor was applied, with silence\nserving as the baseline condition. They state that\nthe Mean αWave Amplitude Value (calculated\ncomparing the difference between the “music\nlistening phase ”and the “stressor phase ”to the\nphase before the measurement) is signi ﬁcantly\nhigher during the ASMR-triggering condition\nand the relaxing music condition compared to the\nrap music condition and silence. This means that\nASMR and music can relax participants even to a\ncalmer state than before the stressor.\nFor the studies with larger sample sizes ranging\nbetween n=15 and n=76, an inconsistent pattern\nof results emerges with regard to αwaves (two\nstudies suggesting an increase and two studies a\ndecrease of αwaves): Swart, Banissy, et al.\n(2022) reveal a global increase in αpower during\nthe self-perceived ASMR experience (ASMR\ncompared to baseline). B. K. Fredborg et al.\n(2021) conducted an EEG study contrasting\nASMR audio-only stimuli as well as ASMR\naudiovisual stimuli with control audio as well as\nwith a pre-ASMR stimulation phase (baseline).\nWith regard to both contrasts, they report\nsigniﬁcant increases in αpower for ASMR-\nresponders when ASMR audios were used, but in\ndifferent regions (for the contrast with control\naudio: especially near the left cuneus and in\nfrontal areas; for the contrast with pre-ASMR\nstimulation: in broad frontal areas, right medial\nfrontal regions and left medial frontal regions).Remarkably, however, two ﬁndings involving\nsample sizes ranging between n=15 and n=76\nappear contradictory with regard to αwaves:\nPedrini et al. (2021) found that ASMR videos\nwere associated with lower αcompared to two\nother video types used (low arousal, control). M.\nLee et al. (2019) showed a decrease of αpower for\nboth ASMR and binaural beat as well as for a\ncombination of binaural beat and ASMR com-\npared to a sham condition (silent stimulus,\nbaseline).\nWith regard to theta waves (assessed by B. K.\nFredborg et al., 2021 ;M. Lee et al., 2019 ;Pedrini\net al., 2021 ;Seifzadeh et al., 2021 ;Swart,\nBanissy, et al., 2022 ;Tian et al., 2020 ), most\nstudies —three studies with sample sizes between\nn=15 and n=28 (B. K. Fredborg et al., 2021 ;M.\nLee et al., 2019 ;Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022 ) and\none case study ( Seifzadeh et al., 2021 )—ﬁnd no\nassociations with increases or decreases in theta\npower. However, in the study by Pedrini et al.\n(2021) including 76 participants lower theta\nvalues are reported for ASMR videos compared\nto one other video condition (low arousal). Also,\nTian et al. (2020) , including a small sample size,\nreport a decrease of theta waves during ASMR\nstimulation.\nIn terms of βwaves, which were assessed in the\nstudies by M. Lee et al. (2019) ,Pedrini et al.\n(2021) ,Seifzadeh et al. (2021) ,Swart, Banissy, et\nal. (2022) andTian et al. (2020) again contradic-\ntory results emerge. The two studies involving\nvery small sample sizes ( Seifzadeh et al., 2021 ;\nTian et al., 2020 ) report a (general) increase in the\nβband frequency. Pedrini et al. (2021) , on the\nother hand, report associations between ASMR\nand lower low (but not high) βvalues compared to\nall other video types. For the other studies, with\nregard to the βwaves, no difference emerges\nbetween ASMR and the respective baseline\nconditions ( M. Lee et al., 2019 ;Swart,\nBanissy, et al., 2022 ).\nγwaves were assessed by B. K. Fredborg et al.\n(2021) ,M. Lee et al. (2019) ,Pedrini et al. (2021) ,\nSeifzadeh et al. (2021) andSwart, Banissy, et al.\n(2022) . Again, contradictory results emerge.\nComparing ASMR to the control audios, B. K.\nFredborg et al. (2021) identify a signi ﬁcant\nincrease in γpower (only for ASMR participants).\nAlso, the single case study by Seifzadeh et al.\n(2021) shows increased γpost-ASMR stimula-\ntion in comparison to pre-ASMR stimulation\n(central region, frontoparietal regions).

      "text": "al. (2021) report lower γvalues during ASMR\ncompared to two other videos used (low arousal,\ncontrol). M. Lee et al. (2019) andSwart, Banissy,\net al. (2022) , on the other hand, state that γwave\nactivity did not differ during ASMR stimulation\ncompared to the other content used ( M. Lee et al.,\n2019 ) or compared to the baseline condition\n(Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022 ).\nWith regard to the fMRI investigations related\nto ASMR, according to our systematic search, a\ntotal of seven relevant studies were retrieved, with\ntwo different methodological foci: Either at-\ntempting to uncover a link between speci ﬁc,\nisolated brain areas with ASMR stimulation\n(Lochte et al., 2018 ;Sakurai et al., 2021 ;S. D.\nSmith et al., 2019a ) or investigating functional\nconnectivity between multiple brain areas ( S. Lee\net al., 2020 ;S. D. Smith et al., 2017 ;S. D. Smith et\nal., 2019b ;S. D. Smith et al., 2020 ).\nWith regard to the link between ASMR\nsensation and speci ﬁc brain areas, it should ﬁrst\nbe mentioned that in the study by Sakurai et al.\n(2021) no ASMR experience occurred during\nASMR stimulation, meaning that no conclusions\ncan be made about the relationship between\nASMR experience and speci ﬁc brain areas. For\nthe remaining two studies, it can be summarized\nthat Lochte et al. (2018) involved ASMR\nstimulation with the participants identifying\nspeciﬁc episodes of relaxation and tingling.\nS. D. Smith et al. (2019a) contrasted ASMR\nstimulation induced by ASMR videos with\ncontrol videos which were not likely to elicit\nASMR. While Lochte et al. (2018) only tested\nten ASMR-responders (without implementing\na control group), S. D. Smith et al. (2019a)\ncompared 17 ASMR-responders with 17 age- and\nsex-matched controls. Even though both studies\nused different contrasts and different methodo-\nlogical approaches, it is still evident that\nfor ASMR-responders, both studies reveal\nassociations between ASMR and the anterior\ncingulate gyrus, as well as between ASMR\nand movement-related regions. Thus, at least\nsome indication of reliability of the ﬁndings is\nprovided.\nWith regard to the functional connectivity,\nASMR-responders appear to exhibit lower\nfunctional connectivity in numerous networks\nwhen compared to ASMR-nonresponders (e.g.,\nthe salience network, the visual network and\nthe default mode network; S. D. Smith et al.,\n2017 ;S. D. Smith et al., 2019b ). Moreover,during ASMR stimulation, functional connectiv-\nity can apparently be altered between different\nbrain areas (e.g., between the posterior cingulate\ncortex and the superior temporal gyrus; S. Lee et\nal., 2020 ), with increased functional connectivity\nbeing revealed when a seed-based analysis was\nused ( S. Lee et al., 2020 ) and decreased functional\nconnectivity when using an independent-\ncomponents analysis technique ( S. D. Smith\net al., 2020 ). In the study by S. D. Smith et al.\n(2020) , differences in functional connectivity are\nassociated with sensitivity differences to different\nASMR triggers.\nPhysiological Evidence\nToﬁnd out whether there are physiological\nmarkers associated with watching ASMR videos\nor listening to ASMR audios, several experimen-\ntal studies have been conducted, and some\ndiversity in the assessments has already emerged.\nIt was shown that ASMR is associated with a\ndecrease in heart rate ( Ahn et al., 2019 ;Ahn,\n2020 ;Idayati et al., 2021 ;Paszkiel et al., 2020 ;G.\nL. Poerio et al., 2018 ), a reduction of blood\npressure ( Ahn et al., 2019 ;Ahn, 2020 ;Idayati et\nal., 2021 ;Paszkiel et al., 2020 ), and an increase in\npupil diameter ( Pedrini et al., 2021 ;Valtakari et\nal., 2019 ). In the study by G. L. Poerio et al.\n(2018) , it was also revealed that skin conductance\nlevel was increased while watching ASMR\nvideos for ASMR-responders but not for\nASMR-nonresponders. Only one study investi-\ngated the respiratory rate while watching ASMR\nvideos without being able to show an effect\n(Idayati et al., 2021 ).\nIntervention Studies\nWhen it comes to short-term interventions\npresenting ASMR stimuli on only 1 day, ASMR\nappears to have an in ﬂuence on several mental\nhealth-related aspects. For example, ASMR\nis associated with improved mood scores\n(Smejka & Wiggs, 2022 ; in ASMR-responders),\nincreased pleasant affect ( G. L. Poerio et al.,\n2018 ; in ASMR-responders), and decreased\nstate anxiety ( Eid et al., 2022 ;i nA S M R -\nresponders). In contrast, Yusaira and Bennett\n(2021) report on ASMR being associated with a\ndecrease of positive feelings like joy or love and\nwith more sleepiness.

      "text": "nonresponders could be made. Again not\ndifferentiating between ASMR-responders and\nnonresponders, M. Lee et al. (2019) state that\nASMR stimulation was related to improvements\nof psychological stability (e.g., less anger,\nmore calmness, more happiness). Sakurai et\nal. (2021) , examined only participants who did\nnot experience ASMR, reporting that stimula-\ntion with ASMR audios was not related to higher\ncomfort related mood scores.\nWith regard to short-term interventions inves-\ntigating cognitive functions, ASMR has been\nlinked to improved short-term memory scores in a\nsample not distinguishing between ASMR-\nresponders and nonresponders ( Kim et al.,\n2019 , only when auditory stimuli were pre-\nsented), but also to reduced set shifting and\ninhibition abilities (executive functioning) in\nASMR-responders ( X. Wang et al., 2020 ). These\nresults show that some cognitive functions\nmight bene ﬁt from an ASMR stimulation, but\non the other hand, ASMR could also have a\nnegative effect on higher order executive control\nfunctions.\nAnother construct that has been investigated in\na short-term intervention study is mindfulness.\nManiago et al. (2021) —who again used the\nMAAS which was also employed in mindful-\nness correlation studies —compared the effects\nof different ASMR triggers. They found that\nwhispering and auditory ASMR triggers are\nassociated with higher mindfulness scores com-\npared to personal attention triggers.\nTo date, there is only one ASMR intervention\nstudy that has repeatedly exposed participants\nto ASMR stimuli repeatedly across several\ndays ( Ditchburn & Bedwell, 2019 ). In this study,\nhealthy participants watched ASMR videos\nfor 10 –30 min every day for 1 week. Two\ngroups were compared: One watching mindful-\nness videos and a passive control group where\nno intervention was implemented. As outcome\nmeasures anxiety, depression, and psychologi-\ncal well-being were assessed. Compared to\nthe control groups, no signi ﬁcant improve-\nments were revealed in the ASMR group.\nConsequently, even though ﬁrst indications\nemerge that ASMR can be associated with\nshort-term improvements in mental health-\nassociated domains, there is no evidence so\nfar that ASMR is also associated with mid- or\nlong-term effects which could best be detected\nin comprehensive randomized controlled trials.Discussion\nEvaluation and Interpretation of the Results\nDeﬁnition and Assessment Tools\nAs stated in the results section, when de ﬁning\nASMR the majority of articles refer to Barratt and\nDavis (2015) . However, a lot of authors deviate\nfrom the original description of ASMR provided\nby Barratt and Davis in several ways. Unlike\nBarratt and Davis ’original description, the\nASMR experience is mostly not described as a\nphenomenon that takes place on the skin (only\nfour more articles include the speci ﬁcation of a\nskin-related localization of the ASMR experi-\nence: Kovacevich & Huron, 2019 ;Maniago et al.,\n2021 ;Rouw & Erfanian, 2018 ;Valtakari et al.,\n2019 ) and the body parts on which the ASMR\nsensation occurs sometimes differ from the ones\nnamed by Barratt and Davis (2015) .\nThe other de ﬁnitional components which refer\nto the feelings associated with ASMR (e.g.,\npsychological stability, calmness, euphoria),\ndescribed in other articles than that by Barratt\nand Davis (2015) and presented in the results\nsection, have a rather vague character. However,\nthis is also the case for relaxation or well-being\n(being related to ASMR) as described by Barratt\nand Davis (2015) and therefore these terms might\nas well be under consideration when it comes to a\nmore comprehensive ASMR de ﬁnition.\nWith regard to the triggers that elicit ASMR,\nthere is de ﬁnitely also a need for further\nspeciﬁcation. For example, nearly all ﬁndings\non the topic of ASMR triggers conducted so far\nhave been obtained on the margins of other\nresearch questions, and there is only one study\nthat exclusively addressed ASMR trigger evalu-\nation ( Barratt et al., 2017 ). A major problem in the\nsystematic evaluation of ASMR triggers is that\npeople who experience ASMR obviously react\nvery differently to triggers, so that even in\nthe future it will hardly be possible to provide\ngenerally valid information about potential\nreliable ASMR triggers. In addition, people\nmay not respond identically to speci ﬁc ASMR\ntriggers at all times during the day or depending\non their emotional state, thus further complicating\nscienti ﬁc evaluation.

      "text": "probability-based conclusions about which trig-\ngers are most likely associated with ASMR. In\naddition, critically, ASMR triggers have so far\nbeen considered in an isolated manner, that is\nindependently of the person interacting with the\ntriggers. An attempt should be made to evaluate\nwhether the trigger effectiveness is in ﬂuenced by\nthe person who is trying to trigger the ASMR in\nanother person. Possible relevant factors could\nbe: gender, sympathy, professionalism, variety in\ninteraction with the stimulus, etc.\nDiscussing the instruments that are supposed to\nassess ASMR, it can ﬁrst be stated that the ASMR-\n15 and the AEQ have both their strengths and\nweaknesses. The ASMR-15 does not take a lot of\ntime, is very ﬂexible, can be conducted either\nonline or of ﬂine and can always be applied to new\nASMR videos. The AEQ can determine much\nmore precisely which parts of the body are affected\nby ASMR. Furthermore, the AEQ was especially\ndesigned to distinguish between people who\nexperience ASMR and those who do not.\nA potential shortcoming of the ASMR-15 is\nthat, overall, it may not evaluate the ASMR\nexperience speci ﬁcally enough: Only a few items\nrefer to the core ASMR experience de ﬁned in\nthe results section, while many of the items are\nnonspeci ﬁc (e.g., “I feel relaxed ”). Another\ncritical aspect in relation to the ASMR-15, which\ncould, however, be resolved by a small adjust-\nment by the authors, is that the instruction of the\nASMR-15 in its current form may be too short: it\nrefers exclusively to nonspeci ﬁc sounds ( “When I\nhear certain sounds, such as whispering, crin-\nkling, tapping ”). Consequently, it does not relate\nto a social component that is inherent in most\nASMR videos. Correspondingly, a study con-\nducted by Lohaus et al. (2023) suggests that social\ncues might indeed play an important role in\ngenerating the ASMR experience. The study\nshowed that ASMR videos (obviously associated\nwith a social component with the ASMR\nperformer being seen throughout the videos)\nare associated with signi ﬁcantly more ASMR\nexperience than the so-called walking tour videos\nin which the social component is less prominent.\nIn walking tour videos, people ﬁlm their walk-\nthrough different locations from a ﬁrst-person\nperspective and allow the viewer to participate.\nComparable to ASMR videos, they also contain\nsounds that could potentially be experienced as\npleasant, such as rustling leaves, rain, or urban\nsounds. Correspondingly, Shimokura (2022)demonstrated that human-generated sounds are\nmore likely to induce ASMR when compared to\nnature-generated sounds again hinting at the\nimportance of a social component of ASMR\ncontent for the generation of ASMR.\nFurthermore, the ASMR-15 leaves out a visual\ncomponent, although it has been shown in a\npreprint by Tada et al. (2021) which was excluded\nin the results section due to speci ﬁcations made\nafter the systematic search that the combination of\nvideo and audio ASMR content is more likely to\ntrigger ASMR compared to audio-only stimuli. A\nshortcoming of the AEQ, on the other hand is that\nthe selection of integrated ASMR videos could be\nmuch more versatile, with certain types of ASMR\ntriggers being left out, while other types of ASMR\ntriggers are overrepresented.\nAlthough the ASMR-15 and the AEQ appear\nto be reliable and valid instruments to assess\nASMR, in fact, the previous studies rarely\nincorporated these instruments. Seven studies\nretrieved in this systematic review included\nthe ASMR-15 ( Morales et al., 2021 ;Pedrini\net al., 2021 ;G. L. Poerio et al., 2022 ;Roberts\net al., 2019 ,2020a ,2020b ,2021 ) and only\ntwo ( Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022 ) the AEQ. It\nis important to note, however, that several of\nthe studies were conducted when the question-\nnaires did not yet exist (the ﬁrst study on\nASMR-15 was published in 2019, Roberts\net al., 2019 ; the ﬁrst study involving the AEQ\nin 2021, Swart, Bowling, et al., 2022 ). In\ndesigning future studies, the two assessment\ntools presented in this systematic review should\nbe used more frequently and should be adapted to\nensure that ASMR experience is appropriately\noperationalized.\nPsychological Correlates\nRegarding the association between ASMR and\npersonality, the main focus in research so far has\nbeen on the Big Five ( Costa & McCrae, 1988 ),\nwhich certainly provides good initial evidence,\nbut only partially circumscribes the multifaceted\npersonality of human individuals. Other, more\ncomprehensive measures of personality that\ncould be correlated with ASMR are, for example,\nthe Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire\n(Cattell & Mead, 2008 ; involving additional\npersonality factors such as warmth, sensitivity\nor tension) and the more clinically oriented\nMinnesota Multiphasic Personality InventoryThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.46 LOHAUS, SCHRECKENBERG, BELLINGRATH, AND THOMA"

      "text": "(Butcher, 2010 ; involving e.g., social introver-\nsion). While there is preliminary (albeit contra-\ndictory) evidence regarding a relationship\nbetween ASMR and mindfulness, the relation-\nship between ASMR and the ability to engage in\nother techniques associated with relaxation such\nas yoga, PMR, and AT remains unexplored. It\nwould be particularly interesting to know whether\npeople who use other relaxation techniques are\nalso ASMR-responders, or whether ASMR\ncontent might be an alternative for people who\nhave not had success with other relaxation\ntechniques before.\nConcerning other constructs related to ASMR,\ntheﬁndings indicate that it is not always clear\nhow to distinguish ASMR from other constructs\n(frisson, misophonia, synesthesia). In the sys-\ntematic search for this review, no study was\nrevealed that associated ASMR with synesthesia.\nHowever, since there is obvious overlap between\nASMR and synesthesia (e.g., the fact that they are\nboth multisensory phenomena, each triggered by\nspeciﬁc stimuli), it is currently discussed that\nASMR might be driven by synesthetic mechan-\nisms, but more research is still needed to examine\nthe extent to which the two constructs can\nbe distinguished from each other ( G. Poerio\net al., 2022 ). With future investigations of what\ncharacterizes ASMR more speci ﬁcally, more\ninsights on the association between ASMR and\nsimilar constructs will be generated.\nFurthermore, until now there are no studies\nexamining the relationship between ASMR and\nsocial cognition, apart from empathy. However,\ngiven that social cues might be important for\ntriggering ASMR (see De ﬁnition and Assessment\nTools section), this would de ﬁnitely be interest-\ning to be investigated in more detail. For example,\na link between ASMR experience and data\nobtained via emotion recognition instruments\n(e.g., the Geneva emotion recognition test by\nSchlegel et al., 2014 ), and also Theory of Mind\n(ToM) instruments (e.g., the “Reading the Mind\nin the Eyes ”Test by Baron-Cohen et al., 2001 )o r\ninstruments assessing social problem solving\n(e.g., the social problem-solving task by Channon\n& Crawford, 2010 ) would be conceivable.\nNeural and Physiological Evidence\nIn summary, with regard to neural and\nphysiological underpinnings of ASMR, it can\nbe stated that promising initial evidence hasalready been gained via EEG, fMRI, and\nphysiological measures. Although EEG ﬁndings\nare rather heterogeneous, several studies tenta-\ntively suggest δwave decreases in association\nwith ASMR. Furthermore, there are fMRI backed\nassociations between ASMR experience and\nactivations of the anterior cingulate gyrus as\nwell as movement-related brain areas (which\ncould also be shown in at least two independent\nstudies), atypical functional connectivity patterns\nas well as physiological changes such as heart rate\nreduction.\nWith regard to the EEG related ﬁndings, it is\nnot obvious why a δ-wave decrease occurs in\nseveral studies, especially since δ-waves have\nuntil recently been associated with deep sleep in\nparticular ( Dang-Vu et al., 2005 ). However, δ-\nwaves also relate to consciousness ( Frohlich\net al., 2021 )—perhaps those states of conscious-\nness that are associated with relaxation, since\na corresponding δ-wave decrease has also been\nshown during meditation ( Young & Taylor,\n1998 ). Despite these interesting ﬁrst implications\nregarding EEG data, there are several methodo-\nlogical concerns that have to be resolved in future\nstudies. It should, for example, be noted that not\nall typically investigated EEG frequency bands\nwere examined in all studies, clearly biasing the\nreport. Furthermore, in one study only a single\nparticipant was included ( Seifzadeh et al., 2021 ).\nMoreover, in one case, the overall quality of the\narticle is to be regarded as very low (score =1 out\nof 11) according to risk of bias and quality\nanalysis ( Tian et al., 2020 ). It should also be noted\nthat in the EEG studies, the distinction between\nASMR-responders and ASMR-nonresponders\nwas only implemented in the study by B. K.\nFredborg et al. (2021) .\nWith regard to the reliable associations\nbetween speci ﬁc brain areas and ASMR, the\nemerging pattern of results does not yet provide\nenough informative value. Regarding the anterior\ncingulate gyrus, it appears to be dif ﬁcult to\ninterpret why it might be associated with ASMR\nexperience. One possible reason could be (since\nthe anterior cingulate gyrus has been linked to\nthe salience network) that the anterior cingulate\ngyrus facilitates attention processes related to\nan external stimulus the ASMR experience is\nusually associated with ( S. D. Smith et al.,\n2019a ). The fact that motoric regions of the cortex\nare activated during ASMR experience suggests\nthat ASMR is rather a sensorimotor, and not aThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.AUTONOMOUS SENSORY MERIDIAN RESPONSE REVIEW 47"

      "text": "psychosomatic phenomenon ( S. D. Smith et al.,\n2019a ). Future studies should examine in more\ndetail whether there are other speci ﬁc brain areas\nor parts of brain areas associated with ASMR, as\nthe brain area pattern described in this systematic\nreview appears rather nonspeci ﬁc. Also, it should\nbe elucidated further how functional connectivity\npatterns are altered with ASMR experience,\npotentially in associations with interindividual\ndifferences in sensitivity to ASMR triggers ( S.\nLee et al., 2020 ;S. D. Smith et al., 2017 ;S. D.\nSmith et al., 2019b ).\nWith regard to the physiological markers\nand ASMR, the most pronounced effect of\nASMR reducing heart rate appears very plausible\nconsidering its relaxation potential. Still, it\nmust be stated that other important physiological\nmarkers have not been investigated at all so\nfar (e.g., heart rate variability or cortisol levels)\nor have only very rarely been investigated\n(e.g., respiratory rate or skin conductance level).\nFurthermore, several methodological issues\nmust be considered in the future: In three studies\npresented in the results section, it is not stated\nwhether the heart rate decrease was statistically\nsigniﬁcant ( Ahn et al., 2019 ;Ahn, 2020 ;Paszkiel\net al., 2020 ), and the study conducted by Idayati\net al. (2021) did not involve a control group\nor control condition. Blood pressure reduction\nwas addressed in the same four studies with the\ndescribed methodological shortcomings.\nIntervention Studies\nFirst, but still limited and sometimes contra-\ndictory evidence for the short-term effects of\nASMR particularly on various mental health\nvariables (e.g., mood, Smejka & Wiggs, 2022 )\nwas revealed. Given the pattern of results, it is\nevident that short-term ASMR effects are to be\nexpected for ASMR-responders in particular ( Eid\net al., 2022 ;G. L. Poerio et al., 2018 ;Smejka &\nWiggs, 2022 ). If, on the other hand, no distinction\nis made between ASMR-responders and ASMR-\nnonresponders or only ASMR-nonresponders are\nincluded, two out of three studies ( Sakurai et al.,\n2021 ;Yusaira & Bennett, 2021 ) show no positive\nshort-term effects of ASMR on mental health-\nassociated outcomes.\nMoreover, it must be stated at this point that\nseveral mental health-related domains have not\nbeen investigated as yet, both in terms of typical\npsychopathological symptoms (e.g., in relationto more speci ﬁc anxiety-related domains such\nas panic disorder or social anxiety as well as\nsomatization etc.) and in terms of positive\npsychological constructs (e.g., quality of life\nand meaningfulness).\nAlso, ﬁrst evidence emerged concerning a\npossible short-term in ﬂuence of ASMR on\ncognitive domains. Associations with improve-\nments in short-term memory performance might\nbe explained by the fact that there is a link\nbetween positive emotions and learning/memory\nwith ASMR-triggering positive emotions ( Kim\net al., 2019 ). The negative relationship between\nASMR and executive functioning could be due to\nthe fact that the positive emotions associated\nwith ASMR may inhibit executive functioning.\nWithout involving ASMR, the inhibitory effect\nof positive emotions on executive function has,\nfor example, been shown for the Stroop test\n(Phillips et al., 2002 ), which was also used in the\nstudy revealing the negative relationship between\nASMR and executive functioning ( X. Wang\net al., 2020 ).\nImportantly, one aspect that has hardly been\ninvestigated so far relates to the mid- and long-\nterm effects of ASMR on various psychological\ndomains. The only intervention involving\nrepeated ASMR stimulation for 7 days shows\nclear limitations ( Ditchburn & Bedwell, 2019 ).\nFor example, the ASMR videos in this study\nhave not been comprehensively preevaluated.\nFurthermore, it was not possible to switch\nbetween different ASMR videos at any time\nduring the intervention and to choose from a\nlarger pool of videos, although this seems very\nimportant due to the large interindividual\ndifferences in terms of the suitable triggers. In\naddition, in the aforementioned intervention\nstudy, the time span of the intervention was\nrather short (1 week) and no follow-up investiga-\ntion was conducted. Furthermore, a comprehen-\nsive evaluation of appropriate control stimuli\nthat can be used in comparison with ASMR\nstimuli has not yet been carried out, so that\nuntil now the choice of control stimuli to be used\nas a comparison to ASMR stimuli seems to be\nrather arbitrary. Most importantly, in the study by\nDitchburn and Bedwell (2019) , no distinction was\nmade between ASMR-responders and ASMR-\nnonresponders, although evidence suggests that\nconsideration of responder type is important, as\nresults may differ fundamentally between ASMR-\nresponders and ASMR-nonresponders (seeThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.48 LOHAUS, SCHRECKENBERG, BELLINGRATH, AND THOMA"

      "text": "e.g.,Lohaus et al., 2023 ). Future studies ought to\naddress these shortcomings when it comes to\nevaluating whether or not ASMR stimulation\ncan be regarded an effective mid- or long-term\nintervention tool.\nLimitations of Evidence\nWith regard to the limitations of evidence,\nseveral weaknesses appear in a number of\nstudies/articles. A quantitative overview of the\nquality of the studies/articles can be found in\nTable 2 . Considering Table 2 , it becomes clear\nthat the following aspects in particular need\nto be critically discussed with regard to the\nretrieved studies/articles: Often it remains\nunclear, which inclusion criteria were applied\nmaking it dif ﬁcult to judge whether the ﬁndings\nthat already exist with respect to ASMR are\ngeneralizable or only relate to a very speci ﬁc\nsample. Confounding factors were rarely men-\ntioned or dealt with (e.g., the presence of\nadditional conditions that may be dif ﬁcult to\ndistinguish from ASMR such as goose bumps\nor frisson). Moreover, clearly differentiated\nhypotheses, which are referred to in the course\nof the articles, were rarely stated. On the other\nhand, as can be inferred from Table 2 ,s t r e n g t h s\nof the majority of studies/articles involve the\noutcomes being measured in a valid and reliable\nway, appropriate statistical analysis being used\nand the main results of the study being\nimmediately identi ﬁable from the abstract.\nIt should be noted that a relatively short\ninstrument (with 5 out of the 11 items assessing\nthe writing of the article, but not the research\nconducted) was used for the assessment of risk of\nbias in order to keep the amount of ratings within a\nmanageable range, although other instruments\nexist that evaluate risk of bias even more\ncomprehensively and could have also been\nused for the evaluation of the ASMR studies\nwith minor adaptations (e.g., the Appraisal tool\nfor Cross-Sectional Studies; Downes et al.,\n2016 ). This could have made the evaluation of\nrisk of bias even more precise. Furthermore, the\nevaluation of certainty assessment, which is\nincluded in several PRISMA-guided reviews,\nwas omitted for the assessment of limitations\nof evidence, as the commonly used Grading of\nRecommendations Assessment, Development\nand Evaluation approach operates at an outcome\nlevel ( Balshem et al., 2011 ), with the outcomesbeing so diverse in this review that no meaningful\noverview could have been achieved.\nNevertheless, our chosen approach —especially\nin combination with the items on article quality\nadded by the research team —provides a good\noverview evaluating which ASMR-related stud-\nies/articles already meet important criteria with\nregard to methodological quality.\nApart from the results regarding methodo-\nlogical quality of the studies/articles already\npresented in Table 2 , in terms of the study\ndesign, several additions can be made that are\nnot applicable to all studies and have thus been\nomitted from the rating conducted in relation to\nTable 2 . First, it has to be pointed out that\nblinding approaches have hardly been described\nin the reviewed studies. Only in two studies,\na single-blind procedure was implemented\n(Maniago et al., 2021 ;Yusaira & Bennett,\n2021 ), and in one study, a double-blind\napproach was followed ( Idayati et al., 2021 ).\nIt is also not apparent from any of the articles\nuncovered in this systematic review that sub-\njects were initially blinded to the study or study\ncondition and then unblinded as they pro-\ngressed. Furthermore, experimenter-induced\nbias was discussed and dealt with in only one\narticle ( Swart, Banissy, et al., 2022 ). Therefore,\neven beyond the results presented in Table 2 ,\nthere is further reason to believe that future\nASMR studies can be signi ﬁcantly improved\nwith regard to their study designs.\nFurthermore, it should be considered that\nso far, classi ﬁcations into ASMR-responders\nand ASMR-nonresponders have exclusively\nbeen based on self-assessments, as no objective\noperationalization of ASMR-responders and\nASMR-nonresponders (e.g., via EEG or\nfMRI) is available yet. In the studies discussed\nin this systematic review, the usual procedure\nused to classify ASMR-responders and ASMR-\nnonresponders was to show one or more ASMR\nvideos, followed by a questionnaire, a single\nitem, or verbal questions that were meant to\ngauge the ability to experience ASMR ( Eid et al.,\n2022 ;B. Fredborg et al., 2017 ,2018 ;B. K.\nFredborg et al., 2021 ;Liu & Zhou, 2019 ;G. L.\nPoerio et al., 2018 ;G. L. Poerio et al., 2022 ;\nS. D. Smith et al., 2017 ;S. D.

Therefore,\nin future studies, until a more objective way\nof classi ﬁcation into ASMR-responders and\nnon-ASMR-responders is possible, it should be\nensured that the self-report is as comprehensive\nas possible and that participants can immediately\nself-evaluate their ASMR experience by always\nshowing at least one ASMR video (which would\ne.g., be warranted when using the AEQ).\nOne general aspect that is frequently dis-\ncussed with regard to ASMR and might have an\nimpact on the evidence uncovered to date but has\nrarely been scienti ﬁcally investigated is the link\nbetween ASMR and expectancy effects. The\nnotion that viewing ASMR videos is associated\nwith expectations to feel a characteristic ASMR\nexperience is suggested by the study of Cash et\nal. (2018) , showing that people who have never\nwatched an ASMR video are highly manipu-\nlable via an ASMR instruction that predicts\na characteristic ASMR feeling. By contrast,\nexperienced ASMR video consumers are not\nmanipulable, suggesting that the role of expec-\ntancy effects in relation to ASMR might be rather\ncomplex, is not yet fully clari ﬁed and should thus\nbe evaluated in future studies examining ASMR.\nOverall, we conclude that, because ASMR\nresearch is still in its infancy, there are still some\nuncertainties regarding the adequate operationali-\nzation of ASMR(e.g.,self-reportonlyandpossible\ninﬂuence of expectancy effects) that should be\nconsidered in future research. In addition, not all\nASMR-related research meets high scienti ﬁc\nstandards. Thus, the results and interpretations\nare to be treated with caution (see Table 2 ),\nalthough no particularly contradictory or ques-\ntionable ﬁndings from these studies were uncov-\nered during the preparation of the systematic\nreview. Apart from the more general problems\nrelated to the ASMR operationalization, this\nsystematic review shows that studies related to\nASMR have presented interesting, diverse results\nthat warrant further scienti ﬁc evaluation ofASMR.Limitations of Our Systematic Review\nIn addition to the limitations of our systematic\nreview with respect to the assessment of the\nlimitations of evidence, which have already been\ndiscussed in the previous section, two more\ngeneral issues will be presented at this point. First\nof all, the inclusion criteria for the review were\nvery broad, so that (pretty much) all studies that\nhave been conducted so far with regard to the\ntopic of ASMR were initially included. This way,\nan initial general overview is achieved for readers\nwho are interested in ASMR research, but it also\nmeans that some study results could not be\ndiscussed at all to keep the overview focused and\nprecise. Even articles of rather poor methodolog-\nical quality were included. The decision to keep\nthe articles as a part of the systematic review was\nmade since even if the overall methodological\nquality of certain articles is not considered\nparticularly high, these articles were still under-\ngoing peer-review, may inspire future ASMR\nresearchers in terms of their research and can still\ncontribute to the evaluation of ASMR in a\ndescriptive manner (e.g., Table 3 ).\nFurthermore, despite the broad scope of\nthe systematic review, it is still possible that\nindividual studies are not included in this\nreview, for example, due to lack of publication\nof nonsigni ﬁcant ﬁndings. No estimate for\npublication bias could be determined in the\ncourse of the preparation of the systematic\nreview. Overall, however, our systematic review\nstill provides a comprehensive initial overview of\nthe ASMR phenomenon. The fact that ASMR is\none of the most searched terms on YouTube and\nthus on one of the most visited websites on the\ninternet re ﬂects the massive worldwide interest\nin ASMR. The scienti ﬁc community must not\nsleep on this trending topic and should conduct\nmore fundamental research as well as interven-\ntion studies with regard to this phenomenon,\ntaking into consideration this systematic review,\nwhich provides an overview of current ASMR\nresearch.\nReferences\nAhn, I.
