David M Clark , University of Oxford, UK  \nBABCP started as BABP (British Association of Behavioural Psychotherapy). This talk is a personal retrospective on how the \nfield has changed over time, why the changes occurred, and a look to the future. We will cover diverse topics including:  \nthe cognitive revolution and its consequences; the rise a nd fall of anxiety management training; conditions that were \nconsidered the most difficult to treat and are now considered amongst the easiest, and vice versa; the art of lobbying for \nmental health; why delivery systems are as important as therapy types; t he beginnings of a possible digital revolution; and \na look into a slightly hazy crystal ball.  \n \nReward sensitivity as a treatment target for depression and anxiety . Michelle Craske ,  University of \nCalifornia, Los Angeles, USA  \nThreat and reward sensitivity a re fundamental processes that become dysregulated in the context of vulnerability to, or \nexpression of, anxiety and depression. Treatments have traditionally targeted reductions in threat sensitivity with limited \neffects upon reward mechanisms. Investigati on of reward sensitivity is essential for our understanding of psychopathology \nand for targeted treatment approaches. I will present two related lines of my research on this topic.  First, I will present our \nlatest findings regarding neural, behavioral and  subjective features of reward hyposensitivity (specifically in domains of \nreward anticipation -motivation, response to reward attainment, and reward learning) that correlate with and predict \nanxiety, depression and anhedonia. These findings led us to devel op a treatment that specifically targets reward \nhyposensitivity, termed Positive Affect Treatment, which we have shown to be more effective than standard cognitive \nbehavioral therapy for anxious and depressed individuals. I will present our most recent rep lication study in anxious, \ndepressed and extremely low positive affect individuals, where the symptomatic outcomes occur in parallel with changes \nin target measures of reward anticipation -motivation and attainment to a greater degree than occurs with stand ard \ncognitive behavioral therapy. I will also present findings from virtual reality technologies for delivering aspects of Positi ve \nAffect Treatment. Second, building upon the work of others who have demonstrated the role of dopaminergic signaling \nand rewa rd-related relief mechanisms in extinction learning, I will present our latest evidence regarding neural, behavioral \nand subjective correlates of anhedonia in the context of Pavlovian fear conditioning and related paradigms. Further, I will \npresent evidenc e for interference with prediction error throughout exposure therapy (as a clinical proxy of extinction) as a \nfunction of anhedonia. I will conclude with a treatment model that incorporates reward targets to augment inhibitory \nretrieval models of exposure."

      "text": "5 \n \n \n Increasing access to CBT for child anxiety problems. Cathy Creswell , University of Oxford, UK  \n\"Anxiety problems are common and have a particularly early age of onset, with many people first experiencing difficulties \nas preadolescents. However, despite CBT being the only psychological therapy with a robust evidence base for child anxiety \nproblems, very few children who experience problems with anxiety access CBT. Given the substantial impairments caused \nby child anxiety problems, in home, school and wider life, for both children and parents it is critical that we generate an \nambitious approach to ensure that children and families can access effective treatment when they first need it, and, even \nbetter, for those who we know are at increased risk t o access prevention.  In this talk I will give an overview of recent \nstudies that provide promising solutions for widescale access to prevention and treatment for preadolescent anxiety \nproblems,  including through school -based support and novel online inter ventions that can overcome traditional barriers \nand fit around families’ busy lives. I will take a particular focus on how parents can efficiently be supported and \nempowered to help their children, and hope to dispel some of the prejudices that parents fac e when their children struggle \nwith mental health problems along the way.  \n \nThe development of CBT in the UK: A personal perspective.  Kate Davidson ,  University of Glasgow, \nUK \nIn this keynote, I will take a personal view of the development of CBT in the UK over the past 50 years. It is a privilege to be \nable to do this and to have heard from some others about how they became involved in CBT. We knew that this was \nsomething different – we could listen to our patients and believe what they said, without interp retation.  CBT was a \ngamechanger for those of us working in mental health all those years ago. The model allowed us to carry out research. The \nexpansion of CBT has led to benefits and some challenges. BABCP has been instrumental in the development of CBT i n the \nUK and given its members focus and opportunities both national and international.  We need to document the past, the \nstories, before they are forgotten and lost.  \n \nAction and Dialogue in Psychotherapy: A Dance of Equals . Christine Padesky,   Center for  Cognitive \nTherapy, California, USA  \nThe evolution of Cognitive Behavior Therapies (CBT) has often involved a tug -of-war between those who emphasize \nbehavioral interventions, those who focus on cognitive inquiries and dialogues, and those who advocate for m indfulness \nand acceptance. Padesky shares her current integrative vision of CBT as a collaborative quest for discovery that can \nincorporate all these perspectives. In her approach, therapists emphasize action therapy methods to elicit emotion, full \nbody ex periencing, beliefs, imagery, behaviors and values within interpersonal and cultural contexts in order to foster \ndeeper learning and change. Padesky offers a collaborative, strengths -based model in which the full power of \npsychotherapy is revealed when act ion therapy methods and Socratic dialogue interact in a dance of equals.  \n \nLearning how to feel good: Development of a novel therapy to target wellbeing and positive mood in \ndepression . Barney Dunn , University of Exeter, UK  \nThe primary focus in CBT for depression has been on down -regulating negative thinking and feeling. However, it is \nincreasingly realised that anhedonia, a reduction in the ability to experience pleasure, is also central to the onset and \nmaintenance of depre ssion and should be paid more attention in treatment. Clients describe the repair of positive mood \nand broader wellbeing as a critical element of recovery from depression. This talk will review findings from secondary \nanalyses of randomised controlled tria ls that show neither BA or CBT adequately repair positive mood and that low positive \nmood at the end of treatment predicts a greater likelihood of subsequent relapse. An overview of Augmented Depression \nTherapy (ADepT) will then be provided, a novel therap y that explicitly targets wellbeing and positive mood repair in \ndepression. Findings from studies evaluating ADepT to date will be presented, including feasibility, clinical, and cost -\neffectiveness outcomes from a pilot randomised controlled trial comparin g ADepT to high intensity CBT in the treatment of \ndepression of 82 clients recruited predominantly from IAPT waiting lists. Results suggest ADepT is very unlikely to be \ninferior to, and may be superior to, CBT in repairing anhedonia, treating acute depress ion and preventing subsequent \nrelapse. Health economic analyses also suggest ADepT has potential to be cost -effective relative to CBT. Next steps in \nevaluating ADepT, including conducting a definitive randomised controlled trial and adapting it for work wi th young adults \nand those with complex trauma will be explored."

      "text": "6 \n \n \n Compassion as an integrating process in psychotherapy.  Paul Gilbert , University of Derby, UK  \nIt is well recognised that psychotherapy involves helping people with a range of psychophysiologic al processes. These \ninclude their motivations, emotions, core beliefs and behavioural dispositions. In addition, most therapies have a range of \ninterventions that include: the therapeutic relationship, specific forms of guided discovery, various exposure a nd \nbehavioural experiments. Compassion focused therapy shares these basic dimensions of psychotherapy but highlights the \nimportance of motivation orientation. The talk will explore how different motives influence these processes. It will also \nexplore the e volution of caring behaviour and how and why caring behaviour creates a betweenperson and within person \ncontext for the ability to tolerate and integrate difficult or avoided processes.  \n \nPromoting Well -Being In and Out of the Clinic . Andrew Gloster,  University of Basel, Switzerland  \nPatients present for treatment longing for better lives, often without knowing what to expect. Psychotherapy is our  \nprofession’s answer to this call. Based on current knowledge, we can be proud of the efficacy of m any of our \npsychotherapies. But what do we do when our psychotherapies fail? And what do we really know about our patient’s life \noutside the therapy room? And how can the scientifically derived principles we use in therapy be harnessed to help beyond \nthe c linic? These questions will be explored by examining empirical evidence across multi -levels of analysis and multiple \ncontexts. For example, evidence from clinical trials will be examined that offers insight about how to intervene with \ntreatment non -respond ers and simultaneously explore the conditions that promote well -being using event sampling. \nEpidemiological evidence will be presented that explores under which circumstances psychotherapy targets apply at the \npopulation level. Finally, evidence from a mic ro-intervention (15 minutes) based on empirical psychotherapeutic principals \nwill be presented with the question of whether such a short intervention can exact change in pro -sociality and well -being \nin small groups.By examining these various sources, I wil l show some of the ways we can help our patients achieve better \nlives in and out of the clinic.  \n \nMindfulness ( -based cognitive therapy) is coming of age: The story so far and a vision for the future.  \nWillem Kuyken,  University of Oxford,  UK  \nThis keynote wi ll briefly overview the story of mindfulness -based cognitive therapy (MBCT) to date. This will include the \nkey milestones over >20 years of definition, theory, innovations in research methods, effectiveness, cost -effectiveness and \nimplementation. Most impo rtantly, we have learned that MBCT provides a cost -effective approach to helping people to \nprevent depression and that it can be integrated into mainstream mental health services. But we have also seen a growing \nevidence base suggesting that MBCT can promo te mental health and unlock human flourishing in the wider population and \npotentially across the lifespan. How can this work best evolve to meet its full potential? How can we unlock all that we \nhave learned to use MBCT as a vehicle for creating a world wi thout the devastating effects of depression. A world where \nmental health is a fundamental human right and psychological interventions play their part in promoting well -being and \nresourcing people to meet the challenges of the next 50 years?  \n \nLow intensity interventions for anxiety and depression with and without Long term conditions.  \nKarina Lovell,  The University of Manchester, UK  \nWithin the UKs stepped care model, initial interventions usually involve low -intensity cognitive behavioural therapy ( LICBT) \nfor common mental health problems, often referred to as guided self -help (Gellatly et al. (Gellatly, Bower, Hennessy, \nRichards, Gilbody and Lovell, 2007). Low intensity interventions are defined as: The primary purpose of low intensity CBT \nintervent ions is to increase access to  evidence -based psychological therapies in order to enhance mental health and \nwellbeing on a community -wide basis, using the minimum level of intervention necessary to create the maximum gain. Low \nintensity CBT interventions ha ve been  mainly developed in the context of patients with mild to moderate psychological \ndisorders, enabling high intensity CBT to be reserved for patients with more severe disorders Bennett -Levy et al (2010).  \nMore recently low intensity CBT interventions h ave been developed or adapted to be  delivered to work with long -term \nconditions such as chronic pain, Rheumatoid Arthritis, coronary heart disease with and without depression and anxiety.  \nIn this presentation I will look at the evidence, cost effectivenes s, and acceptability (from those receiving and those \ndelivering low intensity interventions) focussing primarily on Long term conditions.  I will also look at future directions and \nmethodological issues including longer follow up data, outcome measures and developing further interventions that are \nculturally sensitive and increasing access for seldom heard groups."

      "text": "7 \n \n \n Creating an evidence -based digital CBT program for depression and anxiety in long term conditions: \nPutting the cart before the horse. Rona Moss -Morris , King’s College London, UK  \nCommon mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety, are 2 -3 times more prevalent in people with long -term \nphysical health conditions (LTCs) compared with the general population.  Mental health comorbidity in L TCs is associated \nwith poorer health outcome and a 60% increase in health costs.  There is evidence that people with LTCs have significant \npoorer outcomes following evidenced -based CBT therapies for anxiety and depression than those without a LTC.  This ma y \nbe because cognitive -behavioural mechanisms targeted in traditional CBT protocols are based on empirical models of \nmental health disorders.  This raises important theoretical and clinical issues, including the difference between primary \nmental health dis order and distress in the context of LTC.   \nIn this presentation I will argue that the assessment of people with anxiety and depression and a LTC should include \nscreening for illness -related distress.  If illness related distress is one of the key presenti ng issues, then the challenges of \nliving with the LTC should be at the heart of the treatment formulation.   Although there are some therapy protocols for \nspecific LTCS, to date there has been no clear protocol for treating illness -related distress.  To ad dress this gap, we have \ndeveloped a transdiagnostic model of adjustment to LTCS (TMA -LTC).  I will present the key features of this model and \nshow how we used this to develop a transdiagnostic digital CBT program for distress in LTC called COMPASS: Navigat ing \nyour Long -Term Condition.  One of the biggest challenges for applied researchers is addressing the evidence -\nimplementation gap as few of our effective interventions become part of standard care for patients.  So before moving \nonto an efficacy trail, we  spent time adapting the program to routine therapy workflows, and to patient and therapist \nfeedback. This work was informed by normalization process theory.  We then went on to conduct a real -world \nimplementation evaluation (n= 74) of this treatment withi n existing hospital services and made further improvements to \nCOMPASS.   \nThe next step was a randomized controlled trial. 194 participants with a LTC and comorbid anxiety and/or depression were \nrandomized to COMPASS or standard LTC charity support (SCS).   At 12 -weeks, PHQ -ADS (distress) was significantly lower in \nthe COMPASS than the SCS arm (SMD=0.71, CI: 0.48 -0.95 p<.001). 89% of COMPASS participants reported a clinically \nsignificant change in PHQ -ADS (reduction ≥4 on PHQ -ADS) compared to 45% in SCS. Results on all secondary outcomes \nincluding daily functioning, quality of life, impact of symptoms, and illness self -management favoured the COMPASS arm. \nThere were no serious adverse reactions to treatment.  COMPASS appears to be an efficacious, easy  to access and \npotentially cost -effective way of treating illness -related anxiety and depression across LTCs.  I will end by discussing next \nsteps for future research and wider implementation and open to the audience for comment.  \n \nMaking CBT for OCD better  one experiment, one belief, one step at a time. Adam Radomsky,   \nConcordia University Montréal, Canada  \nOne of the most impressive things about cognitive -behaviour therapy (CBT) is that it was designed to be influenced by \nadvances in science.  Links between  the clinic and the laboratory are essential to fostering advances in CBT, and effective \nCBT interventions for obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD) are an impressive exemplar of the benefits of connecting \nscience with practice.  Further, experimental method shave some unique properties that have lent themselves well to these \nimprovements over time.  This talk  will highlight in two domains how reports of individuals struggling with OCD, advances \nin theory, and laboratory experiments have helped to shape improv ements in our understanding and ability to treat OCD, \nmoving forward from older behavioural treatments to modern cognitive approaches.  Early research on memory deficits in \nOCD and reports of those with lived experience led to experiments which  shaped our understanding of the role of memory \n(and of memory confidence) in OCD.  These in turn led to detailed examinations of psychological mechanisms underlying \nmemory -related beliefs, confidence, doubt and compulsive checking, which have now been shown to be hel pful in \ntreatment.  Other belief domains will be highlighted as potentially fruitful, including recent experimental work on beliefs \nabout losing control, and of their potential to improve our understanding and treatment not only of OCD, but also of a \nrange  of other mental health problems.  \n \nCurrent status of Cultural Adaptations to CBT – A Global Perspective. Shanaya Rathod ,  Southern \nHealth NHS Foundation Trust, UK  \n\"Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is the most widely recommended psychological  intervention for mental health \nproblems in the United Kingdom (e.g. NICE 2014) and  many other countries. However, explanations used in CBT have been \ncriticised as  being based on Western concepts and illness models. We know that culture  significantly impact s on all aspects \nof mental illness - commencement,  psychopathology, course, treatment approaches and outcomes. Despite this, little  \nattention is given to modifying the therapeutic framework and practice of therapy to  incorporate an understanding of \ndiverse  ethnic, cultural and religious contexts  (Rathod et al, 2008).  Prof Rathod will present her pioneering work in \ndeveloping and testing a culturally  adapted CBT framework in the UK (Rathod et al. 2010; 2013; 2015) that has led to a"

Paul Salkovskis,  University of Oxford,  UK  \nThe roots of the wide range of approaches covered by the term “Cognitive -behavioural therapy” are firmly planted in \nBehaviour Therapy, which placed observable behaviour at the heart of its therapeutic approach. So where do we stand on \nthe importance of beh aviour today, Sixty four years after the origins of Behaviour Therapy, Fifty years after the founding of \nthe British Association for Behavioural Psychotherapy and Thirty years after it was renamed the British Association for \nBehavioural and Cognitive Psych otherapies? Unsurprisingly, it remains both crucial and central to the understanding and \ntreatment of psychological problems. Our improved understanding of the complex ways in which cognitive and behavioural \nprocesses interact to cause distress and disabil ity has allowed us to refine and enhance treatments to a previously unheard \nof extent. Central to our understanding of the importance of behaviour is defining the mechanism of change in CBT (and \nindeed other psychological therapies). It is suggested that t his mechanism is surprisingly simple and has profound \nimplications for the way we work with those we seek to help. It also explains the importance of (and links between) both \nbehavioural and cognitive change, and how best to facilitate these. Examples will  be drawn from empirically grounded \napproaches to panic, OCD and health anxiety whilst illustrating key transdiagnostic factors. Fifty years on, CBT is a truly \nintegrative transdiagnostic approach.  \n \nToo good for your own good: Advances in the understanding  and treatment of clinical perfectionism . \nRoz Shafran,   UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, London , UK  \nUnlike most other areas related to mental health, perfectionism is often viewed positively. In fact, those attending the \nconference from overseas may well have stopped at Heathrow’s ‘Perfectionists’ café’ inspired by Heston Blumenthal’s ‘In \nSearch of Perfection’ TV series. Or perhaps you have recently come across a ‘motivational’ message such as ‘harder, better, \nfaster, stronger’. The posit ive value placed on striving and achievement can make it particularly challenging for people to \nengage in therapy. However, the strong associations between perfectionism and psychopathology such as suicidal ideation, \ndepression, anxiety, eating disorders, and OCD indicate that addressing perfectionism can improve mental health and this \nis borne out in several meta -analyses that have confirmed the efficacy of the cognitive behavioural intervention for \nperfectionism.  \nIn this keynote, I will provide an overvi ew of the latest research findings on the prevalence, understanding and treatment \nof perfectionism. Perfectionist Strivings will be distinguished from Perfectionistic Concerns, and the role of each in the \nmaintenance of psychopathology will be reviewed. Th e cognitive behavioural approach to clinical perfectionism will be \nconsidered in light of other approaches including ACT and those focused on social disconnection. The clinical question of \nwhen and how to tackle perfectionism in the face of multiple co -existing mental health disorders will be addressed. The \nkeynote will end with a consideration of future innovations and challenges facing the treatment of perfectionism.  \n \nSymposium  \nMeta competent adherence in practice: Adaptations of Trauma -focused CBT with refugee and \nasylum seeking clients  \nChair: Kerry Young, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust (CNWL), UK  \n \nReducing feelings of being contaminated after rape using ima gery and cognitive techniques"

Recently, there have been several encouraging papers suggesting how to work with dissociation in the \ncontext of tfCBT (Kennerley, 2009; Schauer & Elbert, 2010; Chessell et al., 2019; Ehlers & Murray, 2020). This presentation \nwill describe how these suggestions were put into practice in the treatment of a female refugee presenting with extremely \nsevere dissociation and PTSD following domestic abuse and rape over many years.

Survivors of trauma may hold themselves responsible for what occurred, both during and/or after \nthe traumatic event(s). Guilt should always be considered within its cultural and social  context and does not always merit \nan intervention. It can be a helpful emotional experience, holding individuals responsible for actions incongruent with their  \npersonal values/beliefs. However, trauma -related guilt can be a source of distress and may perp etuate an ongoing sense of \nthreat and avoidance of trauma memories, contributing to the maintenance of symptoms of PTSD (Pugh, Taylor, & Berry, \n2015).  This presentation will share how cognitive and imagery techniques were used in trauma therapy with a refugee with \nvery high levels of dissociation and trauma -related guilt. It will also include excerpts of a film in which the service user talks \nabout the t herapy from his own perspective. Finally, it will discuss the importance of reflecting on power and privilege \nwhen formulating and working with trauma -related guilt, and the importance of being led by survivors in this work.  \n \nAddressing  guilt and shame in trauma -focused therapy with a survivor of sexual exploitation  \nFrancesca  Brady , Woodfield Trauma Service, CNWL   \nSurvivors of trafficking often present with complex mental health needs (Ottisova et al., 2016), particularly those who have \nbeen exposed to repeated traumatic experiences, such as those who are exploited for the purposes of sexual exploitation. \nThere is v ery limited research as to which therapeutic models or techniques are most effective to support survivors of \ntrafficking (Hemmings et al., 2016; Salami et al., 2018), but there is evidence to suggest that existing trauma -focused \ntherapies can be adapted to  meet the needs of this vulnerable client group (e.g. Brady et al., 2021; Robjant, Roberts & \nKatona, 2017). This presentation will describe the details of an adapted trauma -focused cognitive therapy (Ehlers and \nClark, 2000) intervention. We will focus on h ow the client’s persistent feelings of guilt and shame were identified and \naddressed, and how we explored the profound impact of her trafficking experiences on her sense of identity and self -\nworth.

Although prospective studies have suggested peer functioning and social anxiety can influence \neach other, findings have not been examined systematically. We performed a systematic review and meta -analysis of \nprospective studies to examine the bidirectional relationship between peer functioning and social anxiety in adolescence.  \nMethods: EMBASE, PsycINFO, Medline, and PubMed were sea rched to identify relevant articles. Meta -analysis was \nconducted to examine the mean effect sizes of prospective associations between social anxiety and four dimensions of \npeer functioning. Moderator analysis was performed, with age, gender, time interval between baseline and follow -up \nassessment, and publication year as moderators.  \nResults: Meta -analyses of 23 studies showed that friendship quality, peer rejection, and peer victimization were each \nassociated with later social anxiety, but peer acceptance w as not. Social anxiety at baseline was associated with \nprospective levels of friendship quality, peer rejection, and peer victimization, but not peer acceptance. Age moderated \nthe association between friendship quality and prospective social anxiety. Other  moderator effects were statistically non -\nsignificant.  \nConclusions: A significant two -way association was found with social anxiety across three dimensions of peer functioning. \nLimitations include different classifications of peer functioning, the use of s elf-report measures, heterogeneity between \nstudies, and underrepresentation of clinical samples. Psychological prevention and intervention targeting peer functioning \nand social anxiety are indicated.  \n \nVulnerability for bullying victimization – Examination of heritability and risk factors in a twin -family study  \nDana  Martinschledde , University of Bielefeld, Germany ; Rainer  Riemann , University of Bielefeld, Germany ; \nFrank  Neuner , University of Bielefeld, Germany ; Benjamin  Iffland , University of Bielefeld, Germany   \nA substantial proportion of children and adolescents is confronted with experiences of peer victimization in their everyday \nlives. Victimized individuals have to deal with serious short - and long -term consequences, including mental health \nproblems. The clo se link between victimization and psychopathology highlights the importance of examining potential risk \nfactors that may increase the vulnerability for experiences of victimization. The aim of this study was to gain a better \nunderstanding of the mechanisms  underlying a transgenerational transmission of the risk for victimization by examining \nthe interplay between genes and environment. Previous research was expanded through the use of a Nuclear Twin Family \nDesign which did not only include data of monozygot ic and dizygotic twin pairs, but also considered reports of their \nparents and siblings. In a sample of 2546 twin pairs and their relatives, bullying victimization was measured using the the \nBullying and Victimization Questionnaire for Children (BVF -K; von Marées & Petermann, 2009) and the Gatehouse Bullying \nScale (GBS; Bond et al., 2007). Structural equation modeling was used to estimate the heritability of direct and indirect \nforms of bullying and to determine the variance accounted for by genetic, shared environmental and non -shared \nenvironmental influences. Additionally, the role of parental and child psychopathology, particularly internalizing disorders,  \nas potential risk factors for victimization was analyzed in path analyses. Implications of the transm ission of vulnerability for \nvictimization for maximization of the effectiveness of interventional approaches targeting both individual and \nenvironmental level factors will be discussed.  \n \nPhysiological responses to social -evaluative stress in peer victimization related major depressive disorder  \nKlara  Blauth , Bielefeld University, Germany ; Frank  Neuner , Bielefeld University, Germany ; Benjamin  Iffland , \nBielefeld University, Germany   \nRelational peer victimization is associated with an increased risk for the development of a host of psychiatric disorders \nincluding major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly \nunderstood. It has been s uggested that psychophysiological changes associated with experiences of maltreatment may link \nvictimization to the development of psychopathology. Different social stress tasks revealed that individuals who have \nexperienced peer victimization differ in th eir stress response from individuals without such prior experiences. In adult \npatients with MDD, however, studies examining the effects of peer victimization on physiological stress responses are \nscarce. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine whethe r early experiences of peer victimization influence \nsubsequent physiological and affective responses to socially negative evaluative and neutral stimuli in patients with MDD"

Using a social conditioning task, this study examined cardia c, ERP, and experiential responses to \nsocial evaluative stimuli in twenty -nine patients with MDD and twenty -nine healthy controls. In both groups, participants \nexperienced various degrees of peer victimization. A history of peer victimization was associate d with more arousing, \nnegative, and disapproving ratings of both negative and neutral social stimuli. Similarly, participants with higher levels of  \npeer victimization showed more pronounced ERP amplitudes on the P100 component in reaction to both valences.  On the \nP200, however, attenuated amplitudes in peer victimized individuals were found in response to negative social evaluative \nstimuli. With respect to heart rate responses, depressive patients showed a more pronounced heart rate deceleration than \nhealth y controls. Similarly, higher levels of peer victimization were associated with more pronounced heart rate \ndecelerations, irrespective of the valence. Interestingly, the effect of peer victimization was found to be stronger in \npatients with MDD than in hea lthy controls. The results suggest that the physiological and experiential reactivity towards \nboth negative and neutral social stimuli in depressive patients is affected by experiences of peer victimization. Peer \nvictimization causes generalized autonomic dysregulation during social learning impeding adequate response preparation \nto social stressors which may enhance the risk for the development of depressive disorders.  \n \nDevelopment and clinical utility of a new measure of cognitions rela ted to bullying  \nBelinda  Graham , University of Oxford, UK ; Belinda  Graham , University of Oxford ; Anke  Ehlers , University of \nOxford, UK   \nIntroduction: Bullying is associated with increased risk of social anxiety and can produce symptoms of posttra umatic stress \ndisorder (PTSD). Cognitive models suggest that social anxiety and PTSD symptoms are maintained by unhelpful cognitions \nand coping strategies. Specific cognitions related to bullying may explain additional variance in symptoms and a new \nmeasur e may help guide assessment and interventions for people who have been bullied. Method: Young people (n = \n1279, mean age 19 years) who had been bullied completed an online survey about their experiences of bullying and mental \nhealth, including measures of social anxiety and PTSD symptoms related to their worst bullying experience. They also rated \nagreement with a series of items describing beliefs about self and others in relation to bullying that were developed from \nqualitative analysis of interviews with young people, expert review, and piloting. Item selection included exploratory and \nconfirmatory factor analyses. The final solution was tested for reliability and validity. Predictive utility of the new measu re \nwas tested using multinomial logistic regress ion with likely diagnosis (SAD, PTSD, SAD+PTSD, None) as the dependent \nvariable. Results: A new Bullying Cognitions Inventory was developed comprising 15 items that represented four factors \nlabelled as “shame”, “self -criticism”, “threat”, and “social defea t”. The factor structure was confirmed by confirmatory \nfactor analysis. The final version of the measure had good fit for the data (CFI = 0.95, TLI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.07 (CI: 0.06 - \n0.08), χ2= 244.59 on df = 83, χ2:df = 2.95) and met reliability and validit y criteria. Factors loaded significantly onto a \nsecond -order factor. Sufficient data were available to categorise 938 participants according to likely diagnostic status (SAD, \nn = 329; PTSD, n = 38; SAD+PTSD, n = 309; None, n = 178). Total score significant ly predicted variance in the dependent \nvariable group, χ2 (3, N = 854) = 394.23, Nagelkerke R2= .41, p &lt; .001, such that the non -clinical group scored lowest \ncompared to all other groups, and those with social anxiety alone scored lower than those with both social anxiety and \nPTSD symptoms. Discussion: The Bullying Cognitions Inventory is a reliable and valid measure of cognitions related to \nbullying that may be a useful guide for research, assessment, and intervention among young people who have been \nbullied. Limitations, research directions, and clinical implications will be discussed.  \n \nLeaving the Past Behind:  Updating Memories of Bullying in Cognitive Therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder \nwith Imagery Rescripting  \nJennifer  Wild , University of Oxford < UK ; David M  Clark , University of Oxford , UK  \nPatients with social anxiety disorder often experience an impression or image of their worst fears being realised when they \nfeel nervous in social situations.  Such images play a role in maintaining the disorder and are often linked to earlier socia lly \ntraumatic memories of being bullied.  Imagery rescripting is a technique used in cognitive therapy for social anxiety \ndisorder (CT -SAD) which helps patients to unhook the present from the past. Patients revisit their past bullying in light of \ntheir current experiences and in so doing, re -evaluate the meaning of the past event and linked image. Several studies \n(e.g., Wild et al., 2007; Wild et al., 2008) demonstrate that imagery rescripting significantly reduces distress associated w ith \nthe bullying memories as well as anxiety about feared social situations.  In this talk, we describe how to use imagery \nrescripting to target memories of being bullied in CT -SAD to crystalise recovery from the disorder.  \nReferences:  \nWild, J., Hackmann, A., & Cl ark, D.M.

Research examining ACT for diabetes, and in particular the digital delivery of ACT for \ndiabetes, is currently very limited. This study developed and tested the effects of a web -based modular ACT intervention \nfor adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D), examining effects on diabetes self -management, well -being, quality of life and ACT \nprocesses. Feasibility and acceptability were also explored given the novelty of the online intervention.  A randomized -\nmultiple baseline Single Case Experimental Design (SCED) was used, with n=9 adults with T1D recruited through UK -based \ndiabetes support groups and social media. Participants were randomised to baseline length (1 -3 weeks) before accessing a \n6-week ACT intervention, followed by one -month follow -up.

Postpartum depression is estimated to occur in \n10-20% for women (Shorey et al., 2018) and 8% for men (Rao, et al., 2020). However, several barriers including stigma and \nlack of time  reduce treatment uptake. Internet -based interventions overcome many of the identified barriers. This study \naimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a 4 -week internet -based ACT intervention for postpartum parents \nwith elevated depressive sympt oms (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05173285). A self -selecting sample of parents were recruited \nbetween June 2020 and January 2022. A 2 (intervention versus wait -list control) by 3 (baseline, post -intervention, and 4 -\nweeks follow -up) feasibility RCT was employed. The primary outcome measure was depression, measured by the \nEdinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS; Cox, Holden, & Sagovsky, 1987). The secondary outcome measure was well -\nbeing, measured by the Flourishing scale (FS; Diener, et al., 2009). A total of 1 38 participants met the inclusion criteria and \nwere randomised to intervention (n = 65) or control group (n =73). The data of this study is currently being analysed. For \nfeasibility, recruitment and attrition rates will be presented in a CONSORT flow diagr am. Acceptability will be established \nby examining self -report data. The preliminary effectiveness of the intervention will also be reported, including estimated \neffect size and confidence intervals.  \n \nProcess -based analyses of the Acce ptance and Commitment Therapy model  \nIan Tyndall , Department of Psychology, University of Chichester , UK; Daniel  Assaz , University of Sao Paolo, \nBrazil ; Bryan  Roche , Maynooth University, Ireland   \nThe Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) model comprises six separate sub -component processes of psychological \ninflexibility (experiential avoidance, cognitive defusion, lack of present moment awareness, self -as-content, lack of values \nclarity, and non -com mitment to action) that purportedly influence psychological distress experienced. For clinicians, it may \nnot be clear, however, how these components interact to produce behaviour change, decrease psychological inflexibility, \nand facilitate enhanced emotion al wellbeing. The present paper consists of two parts to provide the clinician with a deeper \nunderstanding of the broader spectrum of psychological inflexibility and to give insights as to how positive outcomes might \nbe achieved with one particular core AC T process. First, we employed latent class analysis  (N = 567; non -clinical sample) \nthat identified potential clusters (i.e., classes) of psychological inflexibility, and importantly, examined whether there wa s \nclinical utility to this approach insofar as such classes could reliably differentiate levels of self -reported psychological \ndistress (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales -21; DASS -21) and positive and negative emotionality (Positive and Negative \nEmotion Scales; PANAS).

In simple terms, cognitive fusion re fers to the idea that clients believe their negative \nthoughts to literally be true and act according to these negative thoughts in rigid and unhelpful ways. Cognitive defusion, \nthen, is a process designed to counteract cognitive fusion by teaching clients to observe thoughts as verbal stimuli that \ncome and go rather than verbal rules that the mind suggests must be adhered to. The aim here is to provide a more \npragmatic and nuanced conceptual and behavioural process -based account of cognitive defusion for th e clinician.

Results: Qualitative work suggested \nseveral cross -cutting themes pertaining to the design and resources of the intervention, operational aspects of the trial \nconduct (e.g. ACT+ delivery; patient identification/recruitment) and to contextual factors (e.g. need for aftercare, ACT+ \naccessibility).

This study used Qualtrics surveys to assess whether it \nwould be appropriate to include an ACT component in the trainin g, in terms of interest by students and supervisor \npreparedness and cultural appropriateness. Survey results suggest that there is considerable interest in ACT amongst CBT \nstudents and their supervisors mostly consider themselves able to supervise if an AC T component was added to the \ntraining.

However, the characteristics which underlie a restrictive setting may also be considered \nto be in opposition to a ‘mindful’ environment in which diffi culties are turned towards without the attempt to control or \nsuppress them.  This is because the successful operating of a restrictive environment relies partly on the control of the \nemotional ‘temperature’ of the ward; this is often maintained by the use of interventions such as use of as required (PRN) \nmedication, or even control and restraint and seclusion in extreme circumstances.  \nIn this talk I will give examples of implementing and evaluating mindfulness -based interventions for both service users and  \nstaff across a range of inpatient settings, including a specialist psychosis ward and acute psychiatric wards.

A minor number of randomized controlled trials \n(RCTs), primarily in English -speaking countries such as the UK, USA, and Australia, have shown the effectiveness of \nmindfulness concerning positive - and negative symptoms, depressive and anxiety symptom s as well as reduced \nrehospitalization rates and overall enhanced positive well -being. Nonetheless, until today, worldwide only a handful \nstudies have been conducted in inpatient settings, and to the best of the authors’ knowledge, none in German -speaking \ncountries. The current presentation aims at demonstrating the research processes of the past five years in which the first \nmindfulness -based group therapy (MBGT) and yoga -based group intervention (YOGI) for in - and outpatients with SSD was \ndeveloped and im plemented for the inpatient care in Germany within various trials (SENSE, YING, OXACH).  \nOverall, mixed -method approaches were employed using both qualitative and quantitative data analysis. Over 80 semi -\nstructured interviews were conducted in order to gai n an in -depth understanding of the therapeutic actions, processes and \nunderlying mechanisms of mindfulness and yoga before and after the four -week treatment periods. Based on the results \ntwo psychological treatment manuals were developed within a participa tory (participant involvement) approach (MBGT \nand YOGI). Furthermore, multiple RCTs for inpatients with SDS were conducted to assess changes in mindfulness abilities, \nclinical - and process outcomes, as well as iPad -based cognitive measures (CANTAB).  \nThe pr esentation will illustrate the overall research process, results of the qualitative interviews and development of the \ntherapeutic manuals as well as the clinical - and process outcomes of each intervention. Finally, the challenges, strengths, \nand limitation s of the research processes, especially in the light of inpatient settings, will be shared as well as elaboration \non future directions.  \n \nThe Pentonville Prison Mindfulness Project:  Benefits for prisoners and staff  \nPamela Jacobsen, University of Bath  UK; Andy Phee, Oxford Mindfulness Centre , UK; Debbie Murphy, Oxford \nMindfulness Centre , UK  \nPeople in prison experience multiple stressors through the incarceration process including separation from loved ones, \nuncertainty regarding the future, and ad justment to the prison regime, with remand being a particularly difficult time. \nAlmost half the UK prison population suffer from anxiety or depression, and there are high rates of people who have \nexperienced some form of trauma.  Research has demonstrated the effectiveness of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy \n(MBCT) for people who suffer from depression, and in particular for people with a trauma history.  However there has \nbeen little MBCT implementation in UK prison mental health services so far.  \nThe Mi ndful Nation report, endorsed by an all -party parliamentary group made recommendations for the implementation \nof mindfulness -based approaches in four areas of British society, including the criminal justice sector.  The Pentonville \nPrison Mindfulness Proje ct was therefore established in 2016 in response to this report.  The project delivered Mindfulness \nBased Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) to incarcerated men, on remand, experiencing mental health problems and to prison \nstaff.  The dual focus of the project on bo th prisoners and staff was in response to evidence that prison staff experience \nhigh levels of job -related stress and have high levels of burnout compared to other professions."

A longitudinal study  \nZaynab  Al-Khoee , Royal Holloway University London , UK; Jessica  Kingston , Royal Holloway University London , \nUK;  Emma  O’Donoghue , South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK  \nPostpartum Depression (PPD) is considered a debilitating disorder that affects 10 -15% of the perinatal population. \n‘Psychological Flexibility’ (PF) is a psychological process identified within Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and \nrefers to the exten t an individual can pursue valued activities alongside difficult experiences. Research has suggested that \nPF is relevant to understanding depression and what helps perinatal women flourish and adjust to motherhood. However, \nso far, research has been cross -sectional and focused only on the pre or postpartum phase. This longitudinal study \ntherefore aimed to examine the extent to which PF prospectively predicts PPD and flourishing in women from pregnancy \nto the postpartum phase, and whether PF provides a buffe ring effect, moderating the impact of known risk factors (e.g., \nsocial support, history of depression, etc) on later levels of PPD/flourishing. More than 220 pregnant women from the \ncommunity completed measures online. PF was measured using The Multidimens ional Psychological Flexibility Inventory \n(MFPI; Rolfss et al., 2018) and Personalised Psychological Flexibility Inventory (PPFI; Kashdan et al., 2020). The follow -up \ncollection is still active and will consist of at least 100 women in the postpartum phase . This presentation will present novel \ndata on the role of PF in understanding vulnerability to PPD and its role in fostering flourishing in perinatal women. \nTreatment implications will be discussed.  \n \nThe development and evaluation of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for chronic loneliness in children \nand young people  \nTom  Cawthorne , Royal Holloway, University of London , UK; Anton  Käll, Department of Behavioural Sciences \nand Learning, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden ; Sophie  \nBennett , UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health,  UK; Gerhard  Andersson ,  Linköpi ng University, \nLinköping, Sweden; Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden ; Elena  Baker , Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS \nFoundation Trust ; Roz Shafran , UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UK \nIntroduction : Loneliness is a significant problem for CYP and associated with physical and mental health difficulties. This \nhas been further exacerbated by social isolation caused by COVID -19. In adults, CBT is effective for chronic loneliness but \nno comparable CBT inte rvention for CYP exists. The aim was to develop an intervention for chronic loneliness in CYP and \nconduct a preliminary evaluation of its efficacy.  \nMethod : We conducted a pilot and multiple baseline single -case experimental design (SCED) to assess the eff icacy and \nfeasibility of the intervention. Nine 11 –18-year -olds were recruited. The design consisted of AB+ post -intervention. \nLoneliness was repeatedly assessed using the Three -item Loneliness Scale, which is the primary outcome. Secondary \noutcomes are re liable and clinically meaningful change on the UCLA Loneliness Scale, RCADS and SDQ. Feasibility and \nsatisfaction were also examined. The methodology and intervention was developed in collaboration with CYP and parents.  \nResults : We are currently in the fin al stage of data collection. We will present full results at the conference and initial \nresults are promising. This will include data on primary and secondary outcomes and feasibility and participant satisfaction.  \nDiscussion : This study reports one of the first interventions evaluating CBT for loneliness in CYP. This study has significant \nimplications for clinical practice, particularly for those experiencing chronic loneliness with anxiety and depression.  \n \nDeveloping a cognitive bias m odification training task for alleviating loneliness in young people"

Cognitive bias modification \n(CBM) training to reduce these biases may therefore be a useful tool for alleviating youth loneliness, but this is yet to be \nexplored. In this study, we aimed to (i) develop age -appropriate, ecologically valid materials t o be used in a CBM training \ntask targeting youth loneliness, and (ii) evaluate whether a single session of CBM training can modify interpretation biases \nin social situations, and feelings of loneliness, compared with control training.  \nMethod : Working with young people with experience of loneliness, we generated items for the CBM training. Young \npeople aged 18 -24 with high loneliness were subsequently recruited into an experimental study, and randomly allocated to \neither a single CBM (n=29) or control (n=26)  training. Loneliness and interpretation biases in social situations were \nmeasured pre and post training.  \nResults : Preliminary analyses indicate training effects on both interpretation biases and loneliness levels.  \nDiscussion : These findings suggest that interpretation biases relevant to youth loneliness may be modifiable, and CBM \ntraining could reduce feelings of lon eliness. This could inform psychological models of loneliness, as well as the \ndevelopment of CBM interventions for targeting loneliness in young people.  \n \nDevelopment and Usability of the KibA app: An mHealth Application to Support Expo sure -Based Cognitive \nBehaviour Therapy in Children and Adolescents  \nAnke  Klein , Leiden University , Netherlands ; Annelieke  Hagen , Leiden University , Netherlands ; Jasmin  \nRahemenia , Leiden University , Netherlands ; Thomas  Ollendick , Virginia Tech , Virginia ; Erwin  de Gier , Trifork BV , \nNetherlands ; Silvia  Schneider , Ruhr University Bochum , Germany  \nSpecific phobias in children are highly prevalent and have a great impact on their development. An effective treatment is \nexposure -based cognitive behavioral therapy. However, several studies showed that exposure could be used better during \nthe treatment s essions and at home. A mobile app could enhance exposure in children thereby increasing treatment \noutcome. This paper includes the development and evaluation of the KibA app; An app especially developed for children \nbetween 7 and 14 years. The app includes  evidence -based techniques, has a reward system, a photo and video option, a \nchild -friendly interface, includes personalised practice exercises on different levels, and is available for Android and Apple. \nThe app is attached to a therapist environment wher e therapists can login to include the exposure exercises for a child and \nwhere they can follow the progress of the child. The development of the app consisted of 4 stages and included 32 children \nbetween the ages of 6 and 14 years and their parents, a grou p of scientists and therapists, and a group of 4 IT specialists \nwho also programmed the app. The iterative process and the inclusion of all different parties led to the development of an \nevidence -based child -friendly app with a good usability as rated by c hildren and therapists. The iterative process was \nevaluated as very positive by all parties. The app has the potential to enhance exposure during CBT and to increase \ntreatment outcome and is currently tested in a RCT.  \n \nSocial anxiety a nd likeability in adolescents: A longitudinal study  \nJeanine  Baartmans , Leiden University , Netherlands ; Jeanine  Baartmans , Leiden University , Netherlands ; Recep  \nUysal , Leiden University , Netherlands ; Lisan  Henricks , Radboud University Nijmegen , Netherlands ; Tessa  Lansu , \nRadboud Un iversity Nijmegen , Netherlands ; Anke  Klein , Leiden University , Netherlands  \nThis study aimed to understand the connection between social anxiet y and social relations with peers. The research could \nhelp with indicating predictors for why children with a social anxiety disorder improve less after CBT than children with \nother anxiety disorders. Our previous studies found that children with social an xiety assumed they are less liked by their \npeers, but on average underestimated their peer -indicated likeability. However, when children avoid social situations, they \nare actually indicated as less liked by their peers. The current study aimed to further e xplore what comes first: anxiety, \navoidance or lower peer acceptance. We used a longitudinal design with 282 participants in the first three years of \nsecondary school. Participants completed questionnaires about social anxiety, their estimates of their own  likeability by \npeers, and they named their peers which they liked the most and least. This resulted in discrepancy scores between their \nestimated and actual likeability according to peers. The results of the crossed lagged panel model showed that the leve ls of \nanxiety symptoms and the likeability measures were relatively stable over time. Results also suggested that worrying about \nsocial functioning precedes the tendency to avoid social situations, which is followed by lower peer acceptance. We \nconcluded t hat it is important to pay attention to subtypes in the group of children with social anxiety. Further results and \nimplications will be discussed."

The COVID -19 pandemic has increased \nthis treatment gap. Therapist -led treatments, such as CBT for eating disorders, are inherently limited in their availability \nand difficult to scale up. An alternative i s programme -led treatment, where the intervention is delivered by the programme \nrather than the therapist (self -help). Digital CBTe is a novel self -help programme, available as a smartphone app and \nwebsite, for people with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. It is closely derived from Enhanced Cognitive \nBehaviour Therapy (CBT -E) for eating disorders and its associated printed self -help programme (Overcoming Binge Eating). \nThis digital programme has been adapted to the needs of individuals with these disorders through usability testing and has \nbeen through several iterative cycles of development. A recent proof -of-concept study of the latest version of Digital CBTe \nhas shown that it is well accepted and appears to have a positive impact on binge eating  and other eating disorder \npsychopathology. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of this treatment.  \n \nBrief Group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Non -Underweight Eating Disorders (CBT -T): feasibilit y and \nacceptability  \nElana  Moore , South Yorkshire Eating Disorder Association (SYEDA) , UK; Glenn  Waller , University of Sheffield , UK  \nBrief Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT -T) has repeatedly shown to be effective across non -underweight eating disorder \ndiagnoses, when delivered 1:1. The present res earch piloted a group adaptation of the CBT -T 1:1 protocol in community \nsettings (N=8). Results show large effect sizes in improved eating attitudes, eating behaviours, anxiety and depression. \nResults are comparable to those from 1:1 studies. Patient exper iences of the intervention are reflected upon.  \n \nDeveloping the Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Scale for Eating Disorders (CBTS -ED): A tool for rating clinician \nperformance in delivering evidence -based CBT for eating disorders  \nJessica  Beard , University of Sheffield , UK  \nBackground: Evidence -based cognitive -behavioural therapy for eating disorders (CBT -ED) differs from other  forms of CBT \ndue to its strong focus on behaviour change techniques aimed to reduce problematic eating behaviours and achieve \ncognitive change. A wealth of evidence shows that clinicians do not reliably deliver core behavioural components of CBT -\nED, or in deed substantially drift away from CBT -ED treatment manuals. The focus of existing measures, such as the \nCognitive Therapy Scale -Revised, means they assess generic CBT skills but do not focus sufficiently on the specific skills \nnecessary in CBT -ED to help bring about change. Clinicians and supervisors therefore need a suitable tool to accurately \nassess specific clinician skills to deliver CBT -ED. Objective: This pilot study aims to assess different aspects of the reliability \nof the Cognitive Behaviour Thera py Scale for Eating Disorders (CBTS -ED), a measure of session quality in CBT -ED, developed \nby a team of clinical researchers. Method: A group of CBT -ED experts and non -experts who are familiar with CBT -ED \ntreatment content independently observed six mock C BT-ED therapy sessions. They rated the clinicians’ in session \nperformance using the CBTS -ED. The inter -item consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) and interrater reliability (ICC) of the CBTS -\nED were assessed. Results: Initial data suggests that the CBTS -ED has ac ceptable to good internal consistency and \nmoderate to good interrater reliability, demonstrating comparable or improved psychometric properties relative to \nexisting CBT therapy quality scales. Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest the CBTS -ED can b e used effectively \nacross both expert and non -expert raters, though further data are needed to add to this evidence. Potential research \nquestions will be presented (e.g., the value of the measure in training CBT -ED therapists).  \n \nImproving availability of CBT for eating disorders: Delivering therapy via the workplace  \nCarla  Toro , University of Warwick , UK; Tabitha  Jacks on, University of Warwick , UK; Agatha  Payne , University of \nWarwick , UK; Sean  Russell , Coventry University , UK; Glenn  Waller , University of Sheffield , UK; Caroline  Meyer , \nUniversity of Warwick , UK  \nIntroduction:  CBT-T is a 10 -week version of CBT -ED for non -underweight eating -disordered patients and those with \nsubthreshold symptoms. Its effectiveness and remission rates are comparable with longer versions of CBT -ED when  \nemployed with adults and adolescents in routine health settings. However, not all people with eating disorders are able to \naccess care that way, due to work commitments. This study explores the feasibility of recruiting to and delivering online"

However, the relevant literature has struggled to \nfind a meaningful way to define such cases, in terms of either severity or duration. The risk of such a label is that clinici ans \nwill use it to justify offering less effective treatment approaches, on the grounds of a fatalism about the chances of the \npatient improving. This presentation will address the origins of the construct, the issues of defining it, and test whether th e \neffects of well -applied CBT for eating disorders are influenced by severity and duration.  \nMethod : The study examines outcomes fo r a case series of 134 adult patients with anorexia nervosa receiving enhanced \nCBT. The sample were divided into ‘severe’ and ‘enduring’ groups and examined dimensionally, based on their \ncharacteristics at assessment. Different definitions of each construc t were used, to determine whether there is any way of \npredicting poorer outcome among some groups.  \nResults : Overall outcomes were comparable to those found in other studies of this therapy for anorexia nervosa. There was \nno definition of severity or durati on that was linked to any impact on clinical outcomes. This finding is similar to that found \namong adolescents with anorexia nervosa, and in a recent meta -analysis of the relevance (or otherwise) of duration of the \neating disorder.  \nDiscussion : The label ‘S evere and Enduring Eating Disorder’ has become widely used. However, there is no clear definition \nof duration or severity that results in clinically meaningful groups being identified, and now we have evidence that it does \nnot have any clinical utility whe n predicting who can benefit from therapy. The danger inherent in using this label is that \nclinicians and patients alike assume that they cannot work towards recovery, so give up on trying. These findings stress the \nimportance of not allowing ourselves to be persuaded by the existence of a label, when the reality is very different.

Eighty -five eligible schools consented and \nwere randomised 1:1 to  TAU (43 schools, 4232 students) or SBMT (42 schools, 4144 students), stratified by school size, \nquality, type, deprivation, and region. Schools and students (mean (SD); range age=12.2, (0.6); 11 -14) were broadly UK \npopulation -representative. Forty -three s chools (n=3678 pupils; 86.9%) delivering SBMT, and 41 schools (n=3572; 86.2%) \ndelivering TAU, provided primary end -point data. SBMT comprised ten lessons of psycho -education and mindfulness \npractices. TAU comprised standard social -emotional teaching. Parti cipant -level risk -for-depression, social -emotional -\nbehavioural functioning, and well -being at one -year follow -up were the co -primary outcomes. Secondary and economic \noutcomes were included.  \nFindings: Analysis of 84 schools (N=8,376 participants) found no evidence that SBMT was superior to TAU at one -year. \nStandardised mean differences (intervention minus control) were: 0.005 (95%CI: -0.05 –0.06) for risk -for-depression; 0.02 ( -\n0.02 –0.07) for social -emotional -behavioural functioning; and 0.02 ( -0.03 –0.07) fo r well -being. SBMT had a high probability \nof cost -effectiveness (83%) at a willingness -to-pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY. No intervention -related adverse events \nwere observed.  \nConclusions: Findings do not support the superiority of SBMT over TAU in prom oting mental health in adolescence.  \nClinical implications: There is need to ask what works, for whom and how, as well as considering key contextual and \nimplementation factors.  \nTrial registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN86619085.

We evaluated whether mindfulness -based cognitive \ntherapy (MBCT), using ‘Finding Peace in a Frantic World’ [MBCT -FP] and mindfulness -based cognitive therapy for life \n[MBCT -L], could reduce stress and target a range of secondary outcomes.  \nMethod : The first study randomly assigned secondary schoolteachers to receive instructor -led and self -taught MBCT -FP. \nThe second study randomly assigned NHS workers to receive either MBCT -L or wait -list. We measured psychological well -\nbeing and a range of mental h ealth variables. Mixed regressions were used. Mindfulness and compassion were explored as \npotential mechanisms of effects.  \nResults : In the first study, 206 teachers from 43 schools were randomized by school to an instructor -led or self -taught \ncourse. Both formats showed similar rates of participant expectancy and engagement, but the instructor -led arm was \nperceived as more credible. We found the self -taught arm showed significant pre -post improvements in well -being and \nself-compassion, while the instructor -led arm showed such improvements in well -being, mindfulness, self -compassion, \nperceived stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout. Changes over time significantly differed between the groups in all these \noutcomes, favouring the instructor -led arm. The instr uctor -led arm, compared with the self -taught, indirectly improved \nteacher outcomes by enhancing mindfulness and self -compassion as mediating factors.

The \nprimary aim of the current study was to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of the MBCT -TiF programme in a self -\nselected adult general population sample of MBCT/MBSR graduates using an onl ine format.  \nMethods : A randomised controlled trial with waitlist -control and repeated measures design was used. Two cohorts of \nMBCT/MBSR graduates aged 18 and above were recruited and randomly assigned to either MBCT -TiF or wait -list control \n(WL). The pri mary outcome was self -reported well -being, measured with the 14 -item Warwick -Edinburgh Mental Well -\nbeing Scale (WEMWBS). Participants completed the WEMWBS three times before the start of the intervention, twice \nduring the intervention, and once post -interv ention. Secondary outcomes included: anxiety (GAD -7), depression (PHQ -9) \nand psychological quality of life (WHOQOL -BREF). Measures of acceptability included: attendance, self -reported home \npractice, perceived expectations and credibility, teacher quality, unpleasant experiences and harm. The primary analysis \nwas intention to treat using complete cases. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT05154266).  \nResults : Out of the 164 MBCT/MBSR graduates recruited and randomised across two c ohorts (between June and \nSeptember 2021), 83 were randomised to MBCT -TiF and 81 to WL. 96.4% of the MBCT -TiF arm attended at least half of the \nsessions. MBCT -TiF was significantly more effective than WL at improving well -being, with large effects post -intervention (d \n= 0.78). In terms of secondary outcomes, MBCT -TiF was significantly more effective than WL at improving psychological \nquality of life (d = 0.74) and symptoms of anxiety and depression (d = -0.44 to -0.53), with moderate to large effects post -\nintervention.  \nDiscussion : Our findings demonstrated acceptability and effectiveness of an online format of MBCT -TiF in a self -selected \nadult general population sample of MBCT/MBSR graduates.  \n \nThe effect of mindfulness -based programmes on elite athlete mental health: A systematic review and meta -\nanalysis  \nKearnan  Myall , Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, UK ; Jesus  Montero -Marin , Teaching, Research \n& Innovation Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Déu, Sant Boi de Llobregat, Spain ; Paul  Gorczynski , School of \nSport, Ex ercise, and Health Sciences, University of Portsmouth, UK ; Nabeela  Kajee , Department of Psychiatry, \nUniversity of Oxford, UK ; Robert  Bernard , Department of Education, Concordia University, Canada ; Elinor  \nHarriss , Bodleian Healthcare Libraries, Univeristy of Oxford, UK ; Willem  Kuyken , Department of Psychiatry, \nUniversity of Oxford, UK  \nIntroductio n: Elite athletes face unique stressors that can place them at particular risk of experiencing men tal health \nsymptoms and disorders.

Mindfulness -based programmes \n(MBPs) are becoming increasingly popular in elite sport for their potential to improve performance alongside mental \nhealth. Careful adaptation of these  programmes is required when targeting specific groups and new contexts, such as elite \nathletes, to maximise acceptability, effectiveness, ease of implementation, and scalability. The objective of this review was  \nto systematically evaluate the best availab le evidence to determine the effect MBPs had on elite athletes’ mental health.  \nMethods : For this systematic review and meta -analysis we searched eight online databases (Embase; PsycINFO; \nSPORTDiscus, MEDLINE; Scopus; Cochrane CENTRAL; ProQuest Dissertation s & Theses; Google Scholar), plus forwards and \nbackwards searching from included studies and previous systematic reviews. Studies were included if they were \nrandomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a MBP against a control, in current or former eli te athletes. Between \ngroup differences were analysed for: (1) anxiety symptoms; (2) depression symptoms; (3) psychological well -being; (4) \npsychological distress; (5) stress; and (6) mindfulness.  \nResults : Of 2,386 articles identified, 12 RCTs were included  in the systematic review and meta -analysis, comprising a total \nof 613 elite athletes (313 MBP; 300 controls). Overall, MBPs improved mental health, with large significant pooled effect \nsizes for reducing symptoms of anxiety (hedges g = -0.87, number of st udies (n) = 6, p = .02, I2 = 90), stress (g = -0.91, n = 5, \np = .01, I2 = 74), and increased psychological well -being (g = 0.96, n = 5, p = .04, I2  = 89). Overall, the risk of bias and \ncertainty of evidence was moderate and all findings were subject to hi gh estimated levels of heterogeneity.  \nDiscussion : MBPs demonstrated positive effects in improving elite athletes' mental health.

One comorbid symptom of note is hearing voices. \nWhilst research has explored psychotic -like experiences in young people (Laurens et al., 2007), res earch investigating the \nlink between such experiences and PTSD has so far been limited to adult samples (e.g., Anketell et al., 2010).

Youth who experienced voices in the last 2 \nweeks (n = 50) were compared to youth who did not (n = 70). Specifically, analyses were conducted to assess whether \nvoices w ere more prevalent in young people exposed to sexual trauma compared to non -sexual trauma, whether hearing \nvoices is related to PTSD severity and whether hearing voices is related to negative trauma -related beliefs.

Two reviews concern elements of the \ntreatment of PTSD in youth, in particular the acceptability of mainstream psychological therapies for PTSD in this age group \n(Simmons et al., 2021), and the influence of therapist qualifications and training on the efficacy of PTSD treatment \n(Grainger et al., 2022). The implications of these data for our theoretica l understanding of PTSD in youth and the wider \ndelivery of effective treatment will be outlined.  \nReferences:  \nAllen, L., Jones, C., Fox, A., Copello, A., Jones, N., & Meiser -Stedman, R.

The aim of this study was to \nquantitatively explore whether mental health diagnosis and treatment decision -making differed when a young person was \nidentified as being in care, specifically focused on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a trauma -specific mental \nhealth disorder with rates substantially higher in children  in care versus their peers.  \nMethods: Participants were 270 UK mental health professionals who completed an online survey. Participants were \nrandomised to receive one of two vignettes, which were identical in their description of a teenage boy experiencing  PTSD \nsymptoms, except in one he was in foster care and in the other he lived with his mother. Participants were asked to select \na primary diagnosis, treatment approach, and potential secondary diagnosis.  \nResults: Professionals were twice as likely to choose a primary diagnosis of PTSD and a NICE -recommended PTSD treatment \nwhen randomised to the mother vignette versus the foster carer vignette. Selecting PTSD as the primary diagnosis made \nclinicians three t imes more likely to select a NICE -recommended treatment for PTSD. Developmental trauma was the most \ncommon “diagnosis” for both groups, although this led to different treatment decisions.  \nConclusions: In the context of PTSD, we found children in care face diagnosis and treatment decision -making biases. \nPractice implications are discussed.  \n \nA meta -analytic review of group -based interventions for treating post -traumatic stress symptoms in children \nand adolescents  \nRebecca  Davis , University of Bath, UK ; Richard  Meiser -Stedman , University of East Anglia, UK ; Nimr ah Afzal , \nUniversity of Bath, UK ; John  Devaney , University of Edinburgh, UK ; Sarah  Halligan , University of Bath, UK ; Katie  \nLofthouse , University of East Anglia, UK ; Rachel  Hiller , Universit y College London, UK  \nBackground: Trauma exposure in childhood is common and can lead to a range of negative mental health outcomes, \nincluding posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In many services and communities, resources to address th is distress are \nscarce. Compared to best -evidenced individual psychological intervention, group -based interventions often require \nminimal resources and training, can be delivered by non -mental health specialists, and target larger numbers of young \npeople.  \nMethods: Our meta -analysis sought to establish whether such an approach is an effective method for targeting PTSD \nsymptoms, and to identify potential moderators of effectiveness. We searched PubMed, PsycNET and PTSDPubs for RCTs \nwhich used a group -based P TSD intervention, with children aged 6 -18 years. Data were extracted for PTSD symptoms and \ndepression symptoms. We conducted a random effects meta -analysis to obtain between group pooled effect size \nestimates.  \nFindings: The initial search identified 9,650  studies, of which 42 were eligible for inclusion (N=5,998). Children randomised \nto a group -based PTSD intervention had significantly lower PTSD symptoms post -treatment compared to control, with a \nmedium pooled effect (g= -0.55, CI -0.76, -0.35). Significan t between group differences were maintained when compared to \na passive versus active control (although effect sizes were stronger against passive control); at follow -up; and for \ndepression symptoms. There was a large amount of heterogeneity, but no evidenc e that this was explained by whether the \nintervention was delivered in a low -to-middle income or high -income country, included caregivers, or was a universal or \ntargeted intervention.  \nInterpretation: Group delivered PTSD interventions, particularly those which are CBT -based, are effective at targeting \nchildren’s post -trauma distress. There was evidence of effectiveness when delivered in highly complex and resource -scarce \nsettings and to a range of trauma -exposed groups, including those exposed to war/confl ict, natural disasters, and abuse.  \nReferences:  \nhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42020187214  \n \nLessons learned in making IAPT work for everyone.

Gypsy, Roma, and Travellers (GRT) community are an underrepresented group within me ntal health research, \ndespite high rates of mental illness and suicide. They are often the most disadvantages and presents with poorest health \noutcomes and difficult engagement with services. Thus, their needs are ought to be explored further to help us un derstand \nand reshape policies and services to better serve GRT population. We conducted a literature review and meta -synthesis of \ncurrent qualitative research exploring the experiences of GRT population with healthcare system and mental health. Our \nfinding s highlight the gaps in care and barriers in access to services and treatment, such as stigma, distrust and lack of \nunderstanding of mental health. We discuss the barriers in help seeking behaviours related specifically to services that are \ncurrently not s uitable to adequately support to GRT communities. We identified the key concepts which can help improve \naccess to services and improve awareness of mental health for the community. We also discussed direct implications on \nthe IAPT programme. IAPT programme  was developed in 2008 to help improve access to psychological therapies for people \nwith common mental health problems by providing simple and quick access through self -referrals. However, after 14 active \nyears, there are still many gaps in access, especia lly for GRT population. Many face barriers entering IAPT services, both \ncultural and structural. Roma community often faces language barrier with lack of interpreters available to services who \ncan speak Roma language. Travellers and Gypsy communities are o ften turned away from IAPT and GP surgeries due to \ntheir culture and lifestyle. Our findings highlight these structural barriers and discuss adaptations to minimise them.  We \nalso found that GRT as an ethnic category is currently not recorded as a minimum dataset for IAPT, which means that \nservices are missing out important data to help provide necessary adjustments and adaptations for this population. Due to \nlack of data, we are unable to understand specific differences between services and learn from prac tice. Implications and \nrecommendations to improve access and provide cultural adaptations for interventions are also discussed."

The BAME Positive Practice Guide (2019) clearly outlines the \nneed to improve IAPT services racial equity for access, engagement, adaptation, and the workforce. However, the \napplication of the BAME PPG, including its  embedded audit tool is varied across services. We look at steps taken by an IAPT \nservice to improve access for underrepresented and racially minoritized groups by implementing change in line with the \nguidance. We highlight work with Refugee and Asylum see ker populations both at a service and therapist level in the IAPT \nservice. Compared to other patients seeking primary care psychological services, Refugees and those seeking asylum are \nlikely to experience more complex levels of need, both psychologically and socially. Despite this they are underrepresented \nin IAPT services. We focus on examples of working with voluntary sector services and community engagement work. \nChange implementation and clinical application considerations around help -seeking across cu ltures, non -Western \nperceptions of mental health, rethinking service delivery and needs of non -English speakers are explored. The role of \ntherapist beliefs, supervision and training are discussed in actively engaging with therapists around this important w ork.  \nThrough these examples we examine the challenges of putting theory into practice in an IAPT setting. This initial learning is  \nthen used to make suggestions to support development of IAPT services. It is essential that IAPT services are active in \ndeve loping to meet the needs of underrepresented, disadvantaged, and vulnerable groups if it is to provide care that \naccessible, safe, culturally responsive and truly for us all.  \nReferences:  \nBeck, A., Naz, S., Brooks, M., & Jankowska, M.

Furthermore, Bangladeshi men are less represented in Primary Care NHS mental \nhealth services in England, such as Improving Access to Ps ychological Therapies (IAPT) services.

What attitudes related to mental health, stigma and help -\nseeking exist within this population? Twelve British -Bangladeshi Muslim men in London were recruited, aged bet ween 22 \nand 59, experiencing symptoms of anxiety and/or depression but not accessing formal support. An initial online Qualtrics \nscreening questionnaire was completed and men who met criteria were then interviewed. Individual semi -structured video \nintervie ws were completed between May and October 2020, during the COVID -19 pandemic, exploring men’s views \naround mental health, accessing support and stigma. Ethical approval was obtained from Royal Holloway, University of \nLondon and participants were debriefed.  Results from reflexive thematic analysis show 24 subthemes and six overarching \nthemes such as ‘different understanding of mental health’, ‘traditional Eastern cultural expectations in the West’, ‘fear and  \nloss from a permanent abnormal label’, ‘coping res ources’, ‘access barriers to Western support’ and ‘community outreach \nand collaboration’. There are various factors related to levels of stigma and barriers accessing mental health support. \nParticipants suggested initiatives to reduce stigma, raise mental health awareness and help the community access support.  \nReferences:  \nAlam (2022 in press) Seeking Support; Bangladeshi Community & Mental Health  \n \nInnovations in Perinatal Mental Health Treatment Interventions  \nChair: Heather O'Mahen, University of Exeter, UK  \n \nEffectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy -based interventions for maternal perinatal depression: a \nsystematic review and meta -analysis  \nDanelle  Pettman , Uppsala University, Sweden ; Heather  O'Mahen , University of Exeter, UK ; Oscar  Blomberg , \nUppsala University, Sweden ; Agneta  Skoog Svanberg , Uppsala University, Sweden ; Louise  von Essen , Uppsala \nUniversity, Swe den; Joanne  Woodford , Uppsala University, Sweden  \nBackground: Perinatal depression is prevalent condition which impact negatively upon mothers, infants, families and wider \nsociety.

Exposure -based therapies are effective for anxiety disorders but their \neffectiveness and acceptability for women in pregnancy is not known.  The ADEPT study (Challacombe e t al, 2021) aimed to \nassess the feasibility of running an RCT for women with moderate to severe antenatal anxiety -related disorders, testing \nintensively delivered CBT against standard weekly CBT.  \nMethods: Women with PTSD, OCD, Panic Disorder or Social Pho bia were recruited by self -referral, midwife referral, IAPT or \nspecialist mental health teams between 12 and 20 weeks of pregnancy and offered individual CBT in one of two formats. \n11 hours of treatment took place during pregnancy, with a postnatal follow -up.  Much of the treatment was delivered \nonline.  Qualitative data on the use and acceptability of exposure -based therapy was collected.  \nResults: Of 135 women screened, 59 women were randomised into the study with 57 starting and completing treatment in \npregnancy.  83% of women provided follow up data at 3m postpartum.  Women found both forms of CBT acceptable and \nhelpful for anxiety, reporting specific pros and cons for each modality.

Mental health symptoms and \nmedication side effects can reduce parental responsiveness, and interfere with important family routines. A reciprocal \ncycle of effects may be created in which poor parental mental health reduces the use of ef fective parenting strategies, \nnegatively impacting child behaviour and resulting in a stressful home environment which may serve to worsen parental \nmental health further.

We report on the first study to evaluate an evidence -based parenting \nintervention f or parents with psychosis.  \nMethods : A guided version of the Triple P Positive Parenting programme’s “Every Parent’s Self -Help Workbook” was \nevaluated with ten parents experiencing psychosis in a multiple baseline case series study. Sessions were weekly and  \nhome -based. Outcome measures examined aspects of parenting, including parenting self -efficacy, child behaviour and \nparental mental health, including psychosis symptoms. Semi -structured interviews were conducted as part of the follow up \nto allow in -depth e xploration of parents’ experiences of the intervention, and to elicit their reflections on its impact.  \nResults : Five participants (50%) completed all ten sessions of Triple P and for these five, clinically significant change \n(&gt;25% improvement) was obse rved in in mental health, parenting and child behaviour measures post -intervention. \nImprovements were maintained at 3 and 6 month follow up.

This study \naims to investigate the needs and experience of parents with psychosis in order to identify how best to support this parent \ngroup.  \nMethods:  Twelve parents with psychosis and with a child aged between 3 and 11 years took part in semi -structured \ninterviews. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.  \nResults and discussion:Two overarching themes were identified: 1) the  impact of psychosis on parenting and 2) the impact \nof parenting on psychosis. The first theme described how the experience of psychosis can impact on the parent’s ability to \ncare for their child, their self -confidence, and their desire to protect their ch ild. The second theme explained how the stress \nfrom parenting was identified as a possible trigger for a psychotic episode for some parents. The interaction between the \ntwo themes highlights the cyclical relationship between parenting and psychosis, and th e need for research to examine this \nrelationship further.  \nStudy 2: A scoping review of parenting interventions for parents with psychosis  \nIntro:  There is limited evidence on parenting interventions for parents with psychosis. It is not yet known what, if a ny, \ninterventions exist for this population, or what kinds of evaluations have been conducted.  \nMethods:  We conducted a scoping review to determine 1) what parenting interventions have been developed for parents \nwith psychosis, 2) what components these int erventions contain, and 3) what kinds of evaluations have been conducted.  \nResults:  Thirty -four interventions were included. The findings show that most interventions have been broadly designed for \nparents with any mental illness, and only two intervention s were trialled with a group of parents with psychosis. Five types \nof interventions were identified: 1) talking about parental mental illness, 2) improving parenting skills, 3) long -term \nsupport, 4) groups for parents with mental illness, and 5) family the rapy. Only eight interventions have or are being \nevaluated using a randomised controlled trial (RCT).  \nConclusions:  More RCTs of these interventions are needed, in addition to further analysis of the components that are the \nmost effective in changing outcomes for these families.  \nReferences:  \nRadley, J., Sivarajah, N., Moltrecht, B., Klampe, M.

Parental mental health difficulties are \nassociated with impaired outcomes for children and the stresses of parenting can be implicated in the onset and \nmaintenan ce of psychiatric symptoms. For parents in receipt of inpatient psychiatric care, these effects are accompanied \nby the challenge of separation from their child during treatment. The provision of targeted support to parents is beneficial \nto the parent -child  dyad, including by limiting the incidence of child psychopathology. Given the nascency of this form of \nintervention, there is utility in generating understanding of the experience and support needs of parents with severe \nmental illness to inform the provi sion of care.  \nMethod: Systematic review of studies which explored the experience of parents who had received psychiatric inpatient \ncare and identified interventions delivered to support them during hospitalisation. In a second study, interviews with 12 \nparents with borderline personality disorder and 21 practitioners were carried out and subject to thematic analysis.  \nResults: Parents with severe mental illness (SMI) want their parenting role to be identified during treatment and to be \noffered support before  the point of crisis. This support should facilitate connection with other parents and be delivered by \nindividuals with an understanding of the intersection of mental health and parenting, Parents and practitioners identified \nan absence of appropriate supp ort within UK mental health services. A systematic review reflected these finding. From \n20,570 records identified, 24 papers were included of which 8 reported on interventions. The sole UK -based study \ndescribed provision for parents which is no longer avai lable. The 16 qualitative papers highlighted the challenges parents \nexperience in remaining connected to their child along with an absence of parenting -orientated support.  \nDiscussion: A growing evidence -base indicates that supporting parents with SMI offer s improved outcomes across a range \nof domains however parents report that their parenting identity and support needs are poorly engaged with. Within \ninpatient care this is exemplified by a failure to respond to the parenting identity of parents and a lack of appropriate \nfacilities for child visits. Parents and practitioners highlight the need for improved provision for parents. Doing so would \noffer cascading benefits for parents, children, and wider society.  \n \nMe, My Child & Us: A parenting intervention for parents with psychosis.  \nNithura  Sivarajah , University of Oxford , UK, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust , UK; Jessica  Radley , University \nof Oxford , UK; Abby  Dunn , University of Sussex , UK; Lynsey  Gregg , University of Manchester , UK  \nIntroduction : Parenting can be stressful for all parents. Combining parenting responsibilities and coping with psychosis can \nmake parents more vulnerable to stress. Research suggest that stressful interpersonal environments and social difficulties \ncan exacerbate psychotic symptoms and trigger relapse. Parents with psychosis (PwP) often encounter multiple challenges, \nsuch as high levels of parental stress, attachment p roblems, low emotional support, poverty, ambivalent communication, \nincreased stigmatisation, and risk of losing their children’s custody. These difficulties can have an impact on the \nmanagement of parents psychosis, their children’s mental health and the p arental relationships.  \nPwP can benefit from learning new skills such as mentalizing and reflective functioning (RF), which would help them better \nunderstand and respond to their own and their children's mental states. RF can be increased with psychoeducat ion and \nteaching enhanced communication and behavioural skills. There are currently no evidence -based programs in the UK that \nmeet the needs of PwP.   \nMethods PwP with children under the age of 18, were invited to take part in an eight -week manualised grou p-based online \nparenting intervention. The focus of the group was to support parents in managing parenting -related stress levels and \nenhance parent -child relationships.  \nResults : Outcome data was collected via pre - and post -intervention questionnaires. Chan ges in scores were analysed \ndescriptively by comparing individual differences on pre - and post -scores. Qualitative feedback on the group and individual \nexperiences were also collected. Parents reported positively to the acceptability and feasibility of the  group and outcome \nmeasures indicated positive changes in overall wellbeing, parental stress levels and parent -child relationships.  \nDiscussion : This was a pilot study looking at the acceptability and feasibility of a community -based parenting intervention  \nfor PwP, who have children below the age of 18. The current findings offer a good understanding of the specific needs of \nPwP and provides further insight into the design and delivery of an accessible, acceptable, and effective intervention for \nparents who  are often marginalized by conventional parenting programs. We plan to re -run the group with a greater \nsample size over the next few months and hope to publish recommendations on how to embed the parenting intervention \nin existing adult psychology services . \n \nCognitive and behavioural interventions for children and young people  \nChair: Sophie Bennett, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UK"

Training healthcare professionals (HCPs) in epilepsy services to deliver mental health interventions is an \nimportant way to facilit ate integrated care. The Mental Health in Children with Epilepsy study is a programme of research \ninvestigating such interventions. Methods: Thirty -four children and young people with epilepsy who had impairing \nsymptoms of a common mental health difficulty  were allocated to receive 6 months of a modular cognitive behavioral \nintervention delivered by a healthcare professional (HCP) with limited formal psychological therapy experience. Thirteen \nHCPs were trained in delivery of the intervention. Parent -reporte d measures of mental health symptoms and quality of life \nwere completed at baseline and following the intervention. Results: All HCPs who participated in the training were \nconsidered competent in therapeutic delivery by the end of the training period. Twen ty-three patients completed pre - and \npost -intervention measures and were included in the analysis. There were statistically significant improvements in: \nsymptoms of mental health problems , total impact of mental health problems, anxiety and depression sym ptoms and \nquality of life.

Brief psychological interventions have the potential to increase access to evidence -based psychological treatments \nfor patients who at tend health services primarily for physical health needs. This paper reports on a non -randomised study \nconducted to assess the impact of brief psychological interventions in children and young people presenting at a drop -in \nmental health centre in the rece ption area of a paediatric hospital. Methods: 186 participants attending the drop -in centre \nwere allocated to assessment and psychological intervention. Interventions included signposting, guided self -help based on \na modular psychological treatment and ref erral to the hospital’s paediatric psychology service. Results: 186 participants \nwere allocated to the intervention, of which 156 were analysed. Following initial assessment, 32% of participants were \nprovided with a brief CBT, 45% were referred onwards, 1%  liaison work was carried out, 3% underwent a \nneurodevelopmental assessment and 19% were signposted to resources/services. There was a significant positive impact \nof attending the drop -in mental health centre on mental health symptoms and quality of Life S cale according to measures. \nDiscussion: A mental health drop -in centre offering brief assessment and treatment may reduce emotional and behavioural \nsymptoms and improve quality of life in children and young people.  \n \nMental health inter ventions for children and young people with long -term health conditions in Children and \nYoung People’s Mental Health Services in England  \nTom  King , UCL Great Ormond Str eet Institute of Child Health , UK; Gladys  Hui, University College London, UK ; \nLuke  Muschialli , University College London, UK; Roz Shafran , UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child \nHealth , UK; Dougal  Hargr eaves , Imperial College London , UK; Benjamin  Ritchie , CORC Child Outcomes Research \nConsortium , UK \nIntroduction: C hildren and young people (CYP) with a long -term health condition (LTC) are much more likely to develop \nmental health difficulties than the general population. There is a lack of understanding about the routine provision and \nefficacy of mental health interv entions for CYP with LTCs who are in contact with Children and Young People’s Mental \nHealth Services (CYPMHS). Methods: This study analysed national service -reported data in England from two secondary \ndatasets. Data on CYP periods of contact were submitted  by services between 2011 and 2019, although some admission \ndates were prior to this. CYP were included in the analysis if there were data on the presence or absence of a physical \nhealth issue, including neurological issues, and which interventions they we re offered. Results: A total of 789 CYP were \nflagged as having serious physical health issues and 635 as having neurological issues. The most common intervention for \nCYP with a serious physical health issue was Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and for t hose with a neurological \ncondition the most common was Parent Training. However, a large percentage of interventions remained unclassified. The \nmajority of young people showed improvements across all outcome measures in both groups.

The current study aimed to bridge that gap to inform potential cognitive treatm ent \ntargets in this population.  \nMethod: Cross -sectional, correlational design to examine the associations between variables of interest. A web -based \nsurvey was used to collect data. Participants were a convenience sample, recruited over 14 months, via sev eral charities \n(e.g., Shine), support groups (e.g., Trekstock) and social media (e.g., Instagram).  \nResults: The final sample consisted of 90 TYA cancer survivors, aged 16 -30. Overall, more negative illness perceptions were \nassociated with depression, anxi ety and fear of cancer recurrence (r > 0.6). Illness concern, identity, consequences and \npersonal control were the specific illness perceptions that were particularly strongly associated with all outcome variables.  \nRegression analysis was conducted to expl ore potential interactions.  \nConclusions: The associations suggest that identifying and therapeutically targeting negative illness perceptions in those \nyoung adults who have survived teenage cancer could be a means of reducing psychological distress.

Questionnaires assessing \nself-esteem, functional impairment, depression, anxiety and other outcomes were administered at baseline, pre -, mid -, \npost -intervention, and two -month follow -up.  \nResults: Sc reening was completed by 44 people and 73% were eligible. Of these, 78% consented to take part and 69% \n(N=22) began CBT. Eighteen (82%) participants completed. Treatment completers reported the intervention was useful, \nimproved their self -esteem and coping , and would recommend it. Ratings of usefulness and frequency of use of \nintervention components were high.  \nDiscussion: This intervention was feasible and highly acceptable to treatment completers. A randomised controlled trial is \nnow required.  \nReferences : \nLangford, K., et al. (2021).

This is a form \nof discrimination whereby someone is unfairly judged to be unreliable (testimonial injustice) or is unable to contribute to \nand therefore access concepts that ma ke sense of their experience within mainstream society (hermeneutical injustice). \nExperiences such as hearing voices occur both in people who are mental health service users with varied diagnoses (for \nexample, psychosis) as well as in the general populatio n (clinical and non -clinical voice -hearers respectively).  The degree of \ndistress and impairment associated with voices relates to how individuals make sense of their experiences and how others \nrespond to their identity as a voice -hearer, both of which may  be impacted by epistemic injustice. Despite this, there is a \nlack of research exploring voice -hearers experiences of this form of discrimination. The aim of this study was to explore \npeople’s experiences of epistemic injustice in relation to voice -hearing , and to understand how these may differ between \nclinical and non -clinical voice -hearers.  \nMethod: Eight clinical and nine non -clinical voice -hearers take part in qualitative semi -structured interviews. Interviews \nwere transcribed verbatim and analysed usin g thematic analysis.  \nResults: Eight themes were constructed overall. Three pairs of themes related to i) identity, ii) relationships and iii) powe r \nand position across the clinical and non -clinical groups, and two shared themes arose within both groups re lating to \ntestimonial and hermeneutical injustice.  \nDiscussion: Both clinical and non -clinical voice -hearers described experiencing epistemic injustice in wider society, with \nvoice -hearing being both misunderstood and heavily stigmatised. The presence of a ‘safe haven’ for non -clinical voice -\nhearers ameliorated the impact of this to some degree, by allowing people to make connections with others with similar \nexperiences within a non -judgemental and accepting community. Thus, this study shows both clinical an d non -clinical \nvoice -hearers experience epistemic injustice, but that it differs in its form and severity between the groups. These findings \ncould better inform strategies to reduce stigma and marginalisation in people who hear voices. In addition, it high lights the \nneed for professionals and services to consider and target systemic processes of discrimination to effectively support this \nclient group.  \nReferences:  \nHarris, O., Andrews, C., Broome, M.

This may arise from interactions with other people, \nstigmatisation of psychosis in society, and the nature and content of auditory hallucinations. The aim of this project is to \nmeasure how dehumanisat ion is experienced by people with psychosis and understand whether therapeutic interventions, \nsuch as mindfulness, can help people reconnect with their sense of humanity. This presentation will include an \nintroduction to dehumanisation theory, and how this  relates to people with psychosis. The plans for two empirical studies \nwill then be presented:  \nStudy 1: Development and validation of a scale to measure feelings of dehumanisation in people with psychosis. First, we \nwill generate an initial pool of items, using both deductive and inductive methods. We will conduct tests for face validity, \ngathering the perspectives of people with lived experience of psychosis, and content validity, gathering the perspectives of \nacademic and clinical experts. Then, we will a dminister the measure to assess reliability and construct validity, allowing us \nto select the most relevant items for the final scale.  \nStudy 2: Pilot testing of dehumanisation measure in mindfulness for psychosis groups. Mindfulness cultivates attention, \nawareness and acceptance of experience, and has been suggested to have a humanising therapeutic benefit (Chadwick, \n2019). We will pilot test the dehumanisation measure in mindfulness for psychosis groups as part of routine clinical care, to  \nsee 1) whether m indfulness reduces feelings of dehumanisation and 2) how dehumanisation relates to other measures of \nmental health and wellbeing.  \nImplications: The project will provide greater understanding of the experiences of people with psychosis, supporting the \ndevel opment and implementation of therapeutic interventions, such as mindfulness, to reduce distress and help people to \nfeel a greater sense of humanness.  \nReferences:  \nChadwick, P.

Chadwick (2019) has previously argued that people with psychosis \ntypically feel “dehumanised and set apart by their experiences of psychosis and trauma” and frames mindfulness for \npsychosi s as a humanising therapeutic process. Exploring the experience of dehumanisation in voice -hearers was selected \nas a useful starting point in understanding dehumanisation in people with psychosis, due to the potential dehumanising \neffect of voices.  The pre sent study was aimed at understanding what constitutes the experience of feeling dehumanised in \nvoice -hearers and what factors influence the development and mitigation of this experience, with a view to opening a \npathway to further exploring the role of de humanisation in distressing psychosis.  \nMethod : Qualitative data were obtained through twenty semi -structured interviews with self -identifying voice hearers and \nanalysed using reflexive thematic analysis. This followed the recursive and iterative six phase  process of Braun and Clarke \n(2022) and this was conducted from a critical realist, contextualist position.  \nResults : Reflexive thematic analysis of participant’s experiences produced a core theme, Dehumanisation as the End of \nExperiential Continua, and six  subthemes: “It’s Like Burning Alive”: Extent of Distressing Sensory Fragmentation; “You \nBelong to the Wild and They Belong to the Earth”: Sense of Belonging with Other Humans; “They Destroy Your Sense of \nSelf”: Integrity of Self as a Private, Coherent Ent ity; “I’m Part of the Scrap Heap”: Sense of Worth as a Human Being; “They \nTook a Part of Me”: Strength of Personal Agency; “It has a Psychosis Ring Around It”: Trust in Own Credibility and \nReliability. Two further themes, The Push and Pull of Dehumanising Forces and Reclaiming Life through Humanising Forces, \nwere identified.  \nConclusions : For the participants in the present study, distressing psychotic experience is not the end of the line - it is self -\ndehumanization that lies at the end of continua. Reflex ive thematic analysis of voice -hearers’ accounts identified self -\ndehumanisation as such, a point where six experiential continua coalesce. Movement along these continua was affected by \na range of interpersonal, intrapersonal, and societal forces, including  dehumanising attitudes of others and voice \nmalevolence and omnipotence."

Our ADVANCE intervention targets these specific risks and needs of men in substance use \ntreatment. We established the core elements required for a group therapy programme for men who disclose perpetrating \nIPA in a substance use sett ing. The theoretical development and content of the ADVANCE intervention for (remote) \ndelivery in substance use services is described.  We employed the ‘COM -B’ ('capability', 'opportunity', 'motivation' and \n'behaviour') model for intervention design. The A DVANCE intervention was originally developed for face -to-face group \ndelivery. As a result of the pandemic, ADVANCE was adapted for remote digital delivery, based on available evidence and \nthink aloud interviews with service users.  The ADVANCE intervention focuses on developing participants’ strengths and \ndeveloping healthy, non -abusive relationships. The main targets for change were personal goal planning, self -regulation \nand attitudes and beliefs supporting intimate partner abuse. ADVANCE originally consis ted of a face -to-face delivered \ngroup intervention comprising of up to 4 pre -group individual sessions, followed by 12 x 2 -hour group sessions. ADVANCE \ndigital includes an individual goal -setting session; a welcome to group video session; 6 fortnightly gro up video sessions; 12 \nonline, interactive digital practice sessions; 12 x 1:1 telephone coaching sessions. ADVANCE was supported by integrated \nsafety work for victim/survivors, and risk and safety support and integrity support for professionals.  \nA demonstr ation of the ADVANCE digital intrevention will be given.  \n \nSubstance Use and Intimate Partner Abuse (IPA): A Descriptive Model of the Pathways Between Substance \nUse and IPA Perpetration for Men  \nAmy  Johnson , University of Edinburgh , UK; Elizabeth  Gilchrist , University of Edinburgh , UK; Kate  Thoms on, \nUniversity of Edinburgh , UK; Juliet  Henderson , Kings College London, UK ; David  Gadd , University of Manchester , \nUK; Polly  Radcliffe , Kings College London, UK ; Gail Gilchrist , Kings College London, UK  \nSubstance use is strongly correlated with IPA perpetration, this relationship is complex and the route leading to substance \nuse and IPA is still not well understood. Pathway models have been applied to explore heterogeneous trajectories into \nother behaviou rs and to identify areas for intervention. This approach has not previously been applied in the area of \nsubstance use and IPA. A better understanding of these routes will inform targeted interventions to reduce IPA.  \nA descriptive model of pathways into sub stance use -related IPA perpetration (i.e. IPA associated with intoxication, \nwithdrawal, acquisition and substance use lifestyle) based on inductive thematic analysis of 37 narrative interviews with \nheterosexual men aged 28 -52 recruited from substance use s ervices in England who had reported previous IPA \nperpetration was conducted. Three groupings of pathways into substance use -related IPA were generated: 1) Rule \nBreaking Pathway (n=11); 2) Entrenched Substance Use Pathway (n=13); and 3) Relationship Insecur ity Pathway (n=13). \nAcross the three groupings of pathways, the men’s childhood and early experiences led to different journeys into \nsubstance use -related IPA. Each pathway presented differently with varying core features, for example core features of \ngene ralised violence, mental health or jealousy, and different predisposing background factors, including types and timing \nof childhood abuse and trauma.  This presentation describes dominant traits of groupings but recognises the dynamic \nnature of risk and nee d. The benefit of identifying dominant themes is that it increases understanding of risk and need, \nprovides points to promote protective factors and informs effective treatment and intervention targets.  \n \nThe feasibility and acceptability  of delivering the ADVANCE group intervention (completed) and the \nADVANCE digital intervention (ongoing) in substance use treatment.  \nGail Gilchrist , Kings College London, UK ; Zohra  Zenasni , Kings College London, UK ; Laura  Potts , Kings College \nLondon, UK ; Sandi  Dheensa , University of Bristol , UK; Juliet  Henderson , Kings College London, UK ; Polly  \nRadcliffe , Kings College London, UK ; Amy  Johnson , University of Edinburgh , UK"

Firstly, in a \nmulticentre feasibility trial, 104 men were randomly allocated to receive the ADVANCE group intervention + substance use \ntreatment as usual (TAU) (n = 54) or TAU only (n = 50) and assessed 16 -weeks post -randomisation. Secondly, we are \nundertaking a multicentre feasibility study of delivering the ADVANCE digital intervention to 45 men, who will be followed -\nup post -intervention. Tablets and data  are provided, contingent on engagement with the ADVANCE digital intervention. \nFemale (ex)partners were offered support and provided outcome data. Nested process evaluations were conducted for \nboth studies, including qualitative interviews with participant s and staff.  \nQualitative research confirmed the acceptability of both interventions. Therapeutic alliance and session satisfaction were \nrated highly. At follow -up, neither substance use nor IPA perpetration had worsened for men in the intervention arm. The  \noverall median rate of group intervention session attendance was 28.6% (range 14.3 –64.3% by the third cycle). The \nevaluation of the ADVANCE digital intervention is ongoing, however, the current median rate of intervention session \nattendance is 61.5% at vi deo groups and 36.7% for digital practice sessions.  \nTrained substance use treatment staff can safely deliver the ADVANCE intervention in -person and digitally.

Technology has great potential to support this by reducing the \ndemands of delivery and optimisin g the therapy experience. However, digital therapeutics for mental health often have \nlow usage and may exclude marginalised groups, who experience a ‘digital divide’ in technology access and literacy. To \naddress this, we adopted inclusive, human -centred de sign to develop a user -friendly and appealing therapy that targets an \nevidence -based mechanism, fast thinking, in paranoia. SlowMo combines a webapp to support sessions with a therapist, \nwith a mobile app for use in daily life. It works by encouraging peop le to ‘slow down for a moment’ to find ways of feeling \nsafer and living well. SlowMo visualises thoughts as spinning bubbles, with SlowMo tips used to shrink personalised grey, \nworry bubbles and grow colourful, slow -spinning helpful thoughts that support v alued goals. This study aimed to explore \nthe user experience of the mobile app, and its relationship to demographics, in the SlowMo randomised -controlled trial.  \nMethod : Digital literacy was assessed at baseline and multidimensional assessment of engagemen t (i.e. adherence (via \nsystem analytics and self -report) and self -reported user experience) conducted at 12 weeks (post -therapy). Engagement \nwas investigated in relation to demographics (i.e. gender, age, ethnicity, paranoia severity).  \nResults : Digital literacy data demonstrated that technology use and confidence were lower in Black people and older \npeople (n=168). The engagement findings indicated that 81% of therapy completers (n=140) met a priori analytics \nadherence criteria. However, analytic s adherence did not differ by demographics. High rates of user experience were \nreported overall (75%, SD = 17.06, n=82). No differences in user experience were found for ethnicity, age, or paranoia \nseverity, although self -reported app use, enjoyment and us efulness were higher in women than men.   \nDiscussion : SlowMo may overcome barriers to access of digital therapeutics in routine care. Technology -related \ninequalities related to age and ethnicity did not influence engagement with SlowMo suggesting the thera py design \nsupports digital inclusion.

This paper provides a comprehensive account of the \nservice user experience of SlowMo, with a focus on therapy personalisation within a targeted cognitive -behavioural digital \ntherapeutic.  \nMethod : Core aspects of SlowMo therapy are described with case exam ples to illustrate therapy delivery. Descriptive data \nis presented on personalised thought content extracted from the webapp (n = 140 participants) and coded using a novel \nsystem of categorisation, to illustrate use of the digital tools. Data on therapy fi delity is also presented.  \nResults : The personalised content demonstrated a consistent focus on the a priori SlowMo treatment targets (i.e., \npersecutory thoughts and fear of negative evaluation) with the most common helpful bubbles reflecting paranoia -spec ific \n‘safer thoughts’ and ‘second -wave’ (general) coping. However, there was also clear evidence of use of the digital tools to \ntarget a broader range of worries (including general life stresses) and helpful bubbles focussing on ‘positive self -concept’ \nand ‘positive activities’. The blended digital approach delivered excellent therapy fidelity with a mean session adherence \nrating of 15.2 (out of 16) and delivery of out -of-clinic work for over 70% of people attending therapy.  \nDiscussion : SlowMo therapy deliv ers a targeted yet personalised approach. Potential mechanisms of action extend beyond \nreasoning. Slowing down appears to support ‘stepping back’ (decentring or defusion) from unhelpful thoughts and beliefs, \na cornerstone of cognitive therapy, with potenti al for transdiagnostic application to support quality of life.  \nReferences:  \nWard T, Hardy A, Holm R, Collett N, Rus‐Calafell M, Sacadura C, McGourty A, Vella C, East A, Rea M, Harding H, Garety, P. \nSlowMo therapy, a new digital blended therapy for fear of harm from others: An account of therapy personalisation within \na targeted intervention.

SlowMo, a new \ndigitally  supported blended cognitive -behavioural therapy, targets these reasoning processes to improve effects. Adopting \n‘fast’ and ‘slow thinking’ as helpful terminology to support therapy, SlowMo encourages people to notice a tendency to \nfast thinking, and to sl ow down for a moment to identify safer thoughts and so to reduce paranoia.  \nMethod : In this trial, we examined SlowMo’s effectiveness in reducing paranoia and improving reasoning, quality of life \nand wellbeing and its mechanisms of action. This was a parall el-arm, assessor -blind, randomised controlled trial comparing \nSlowMo plus Treatment as Usual (TAU) with TAU alone. It took place in community mental health services in NHS Mental \nHealth Trusts in England. We compared 8 face -to-face SlowMo sessions over 12 weeks, supported by a mobile app, plus \nTAU with TAU alone.  \nResults : 362 participants with distressing and persistent paranoia were recruited, 181 in the SlowMo intervention group \nand 181 controls. SlowMo had high rates of treatment engagement and completio n. SlowMo was effective at reducing \nparanoia with consistent small -medium effect sizes across a range of self - and observer -rated measures, both at end of \ntreatment and 6 month follow -up.

However, the high prevalence of adolescent SAD and \nlimited number of therapists presents an implem entation challenge. Delivery of CT -SAD via the internet may offer part of \nthe solution.  \nMethod: A two -arm randomised controlled trial of internet -delivered CT -SAD (called OSCA) compared to waitlist for 14 \nweeks with 43 adolescents with SAD recruited throug h schools (ISRCTN15079139).  \nResults: OSCA outperformed waitlist on all measures and was associated with large effects that were maintained at 6 -\nmonth follow -up. 77% of adolescents lost their SAD diagnosis post (vs. 14% in waitlist), increasing to 91% at 6 -months. \nBeneficial effects of OSCA were mediated through changes in cognitions and safety behaviours as predicted by cognitive \nmodels of SAD. OSCA was associated with high credibility and therapeutic alliance.  \nDiscussion: This preliminary trial suggests OS CA holds promise as an effective, accessible treatment for adolescent SAD. \nFuture definitive trials could compare OSCA to active comparators to examine specificity of effects.  \n \nBrief treatment for adolescents with panic disorder: preliminary findings from the PANDA \nfeasibility randomised controlled trial comparing brief cognitive therapy to a general form of CBT  \nPolly  Waite , University of Reading , UK \nIntroduction: Panic disorder occurs in between 1 -3% of adolescents and is associated with high levels of co -morbidity, and \nwithout treatment, appears to have a chronic course. To improve access to effective psychological interventions, b riefer \nversions of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) have been developed and evaluated for pre -adolescent children with anxiety \ndisorders. However, there are currently no brief evidence -based CBT interventions for adolescents with anxiety disorders \nthat ca n be delivered in less than eight sessions. Given that a brief version of cognitive therapy has been shown to be \neffective in adults with panic disorder (Clark et al., 1999), it is possible that an adapted version could be effective for \nadolescents with pa nic disorder. This study aimed to examine whether a definitive trial could be conducted, based on a \nsingle centre feasibility randomised controlled trial (The Treatment of Panic Disorder in Adolescents: ‘PANDA’ Study; \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN14884288 ; for protocol see Waite, 2021) using several well -defined criteria.  \nMethods: Thirty -four young people (age 11 -17 years) who met diagnostic criteria for panic disorder, were randomly \nallocated to receive either (i) brief cognitive therapy, or (ii) a genera l form of CBT treatment that is more commonly used \nfor adolescents with anxiety disorders. Both treatments were delivered 1:1 (face -to-face and remotely) by children’s \nwellbeing practitioners in a routine NHS -commissioned clinical service and involved five  treatment sessions and two \nbooster sessions.  \nResults: Young people’s outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment and at 3 month follow up, as well as any negative \nimpacts of treatment. Preliminary results will be presented.  \nDiscussion: The outputs fro m the study will provide a clear indication of the feasibility of a future definitive trial and, if \nindicated, the critical resources that will be required and key information to inform the design and maximise the successful \ncompletion of the trial. This h as the potential to bring direct benefits to young people and their families, as well as services \nand society more broadly.  \nReferences:  \nClark, D. M., Salkovskis, P.

To date, there is \nlimited evidence of the acceptability of treatment specifical ly for panic disorder in adolescents or for CBT delivered in brief \nformats. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of young people underdoing either brief cognitive \ntherapy or a general form of CBT for panic disorder. Parental exp eriences were also explored with a particular focus on the \nacceptability of the two treatment protocols.   \nMethods: Semi -structured qualitative interviews were conducted post -treatment with participants from both treatment \ngroups within the Treatment of Pa nic Disorder in Adolescents (PANDA) Study (https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN14884288; \nfor protocol see Waite, 2021). Thirteen adolescents and 14 parents were purposively sampled for a diverse range of \ndemographic and clinical characteristics. interviews follo w predetermined topic guides and were carried out one -to-one by \ninterviewers who had no other involvement in the study. Thematic analysis was used to identify and describe emergent \nthemes within the interviews and strategies were employed to enhance the cr edibility and methodological rigour of the \nanalysis.  \nResults: Themes and subthemes were developed to understand both the experiences of the young people and their \nparents of treatment within the study. Findings will be presented in the symposium.  \nDiscussio n: The findings from this qualitative study will enable us to have a better understanding of the experience of \nyoung people and their parents of brief cognitive therapy and a general form of CBT for the treatment of adolescent panic \ndisorder. Going forward , it will be crucial to ensure that brief treatments are not only effective, but that they also have high \nlevels of acceptability prior to implementation in routine clinical services.  \nReferences:  \nTaylor, L., Creswell, C., Pearcey, S., Br ooks, E., Leigh, E., Stallard, P., ... & Larkin, M.

In the OSCA trial, therapy was delivered by a highly specialist clinical psychologist. However, as most \nadolescents  with SAD are not seen in specialist clinics, this small pilot study aimed to learn about the practicalities of \ntraining practitioners in a low -intensity school support service (non -NHS, 3rd sector) to deliver OSCA. Equally important \nwas testing the accept ability of the treatment to young people and their parents, when delivered in this way.  \nMethod: Five practitioners in a school support service offering fully remote assessment and treatment for common \nadolescent mental health conditions were trained to de liver OSCA. Five young people (aged 14 -18) received a 10 week \nprogramme of treatment. Weekly self -report questionnaire measures of social anxiety and mood were completed. Semi -\nstructured interviews took place at the end of treatment with young people, thei r parents and practitioners.  \nResults: Findings will be presented to illustrate the acceptability of this method of delivery, based on the experience and \nperceptions of young people and their parents.

Currently, little is known ab out its prevalence, \nsymptomatology, duration and treatment. Studies have focused on children and young people up to 18, or adults, but no \nstudy has specifically focused on 18 –20-year -olds despite the pandemic adversely and disproportionately affecting the \nmental health of older adolescents. This study is part of the Children and Young People with Long COVID (CLoCk) study, a \nnational matched cohort study of 30,000 children and young people aged 11 -17 in England (Stephenson et al 2021). It aims \nto describe po st-COVID symptomatology in a national sample of non -hospitalised 18 -20-year -olds with a PCR -confirmed \nSARS -CoV-2 infection compared to test -negative controls.  \nMethod : Approximately 1000 participants aged 18 -20 took part in the study, half of whom had teste d PCR -positive for \nSARS -CoV-2. These participants were matched with PCR -negative young people based on month of test, age, sex and \nregion. Participants completed questionnaires about mental and physical health symptoms 3 - 16 months after a PCR test. \nStanda rdised mental health measures included GAD -7, PHQ -9, EQ -5D, Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire, UCLA -Loneliness and \nWarwick -Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale.  \nResults : The mean duration of completion of the questionnaire was 7 months after a PCR test. Approximat ely 60% \npositives and 50% negatives had physical symptoms at the time of completing the questionnaire with the most frequently \nreported symptoms being tiredness, shortness of breath and headaches. Only the test positives reported continued loss of \nsmell; t he test negatives had increased dizziness compared to the positives. Scores on standardised measures of mental \nhealth indicated no significant differences between test positives and negatives. Over half of all participants reported \nfeeling anxious or depre ssed to some extent as indicated by a single item of the EQ -5D but scores on standardised mental \nhealth measures were largely comparable with the general population.  \nDiscussion : Reported physical symptoms were similar in the PCR - positive and negative grou ps and were also consistent \nwith those reported by participants in the CLoCk study (Stephenson et al. 2022). The proportion of young people who \nreported feeling anxious or depressed was high. Treatment implications of the findings will be discussed.  \nReferences:  \nStephenson, T., Shafran, R., De Stavola, B., Rojas, N., Aiano, F., Amin -Chowdhury, Z., McOwat, K., Simmons, R., Zavala, M., \nConsortium, C., Ladhani, S.

A growing body of literature has captured how living with \nLC may ‘spoil’ patients’ identity, shattering people’s capability and motivation to resume commitments that are central to \ntheir core  identity. Based on a large dataset of 80 interviews with LC patients collected from across the UK between 2021 -\n22, we argue that the impact of LC may run deeper than simply losing one’s identity. Rather, the ongoing experiences of \nlearning to cope with LC  are inextricably connected to a sense of loss at a more existential level. Our data has revealed that \nthe multifaceted constraints and uncertainties around LC can threaten the integrity of patients’ taken -for-granted self and \nalso give rise to painful rea lisations of their frailty, finitude and even mortality. These deeper pains may further shape the \nway that they plan and anticipate their future (e.g., career, family, health, death or life in general), forcing/enabling \npatients to fundamentally and contin uously review their selfhood. Despite this, the resilience and agency of our \nparticipants were also highlighted by our data, demonstrating the possibility of experiencing existential growth in their"

NICE operationalises Long \nCOVID as the prese nce of multiple symptoms at 3 months post infection. Prevalence rates vary depending on country, \nsetting and sampling procedures. The recent UK CLOCK study found that over 30% of sero -positive cases reported 3 or \nmore symptoms2. However, the pattern of sym ptoms was similar in sero -negative participants.  In a similar study in \nDenmark, participants with positive tests had more long -lasting symptoms and sick leave, whereas participants in the \ncontrol group (those with a negative test) had more short -lasting s ymptoms and worse quality of life3. It may be the \ninteraction of environmental stressors and post viral sequelae that produces symptoms idiosyncratically in different \nindividuals. Transdiagnostic theory proposes that heterogeneous symptoms share similar un derlying physiological, \nemotional, cognitive and behavioural aetiological processes. Accordingly, the same treatment can be used across different \npresentations if targeted individually. A transdiagnostic case formulation was used to identify mechanisms wit h an \nindividual with Long COVID. These included, booming and busting activity patterns, a dysregulated sleep pattern, symptom \nfocusing and perfectionism. Improvement in quality of life and symptoms was reported at the end of treatment. Although \nspontaneous  recovery is possible improvement may be accelerated by early intervention.

Cognitive behavioural therapy for \npsychosis currently yields modest results, warranting research into sy mptom -specific maintenance factors to improve \noutcomes. There is strong evidence of a relationship between insecure attachment and increased paranoia, but little is \nknown about the mediating mechanisms. Emotion dysregulation is associated with both insecur e attachment and \nparanoia, and a candidate causal mechanism. This study aimed to determine if emotion dysregulation mediates the \nassociation between attachment and paranoia.  \nMethod:  Sixty -two individuals with elevated paranoia were recruited from NHS serv ices and community settings across \nthe South of England. Mediation analyses were conducted on trait attachment, emotion regulation and paranoia variables, \nwhich were collected at one time point.  \nResults:  As predicted, emotion dysregulation mediated the re lationship between attachment avoidance and paranoia, and \nbetween attachment anxiety and paranoia. Emotion suppression did not mediate the relationship between attachment \navoidance and paranoia, possibly due to power. Attachment avoidance correlated with d eactivating emotion regulation \nstrategies (e.g. lack of emotional awareness) and attachment anxiety correlated with hyperactivating emotion regulation \nstrategies (e.g. impulse control difficulties). Both deactivating and hyperactivating strategies correlat ed with paranoia.  \nDiscussion:  Emotion dysregulation is not routinely targeted in cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis. This study \nsuggests that incorporating emotion regulation strategies in therapy may improve clinical outcomes. Experimental studies \nare now required to support a causal argument, and pilot intervention studies should investigate if emotion regulation \nskills development (aligned with attachment style) is effective in reducing non -clinical and clinical paranoia.  \nReferences:  \nPartridge, O., Maguire, T., & Newman -Taylor, K.

Although epidemiological studies of DDD consistently report a \nprevalence of around 1%, it is under -recognized and research on treatment is limited. An early published small -scale open \nstudy of CBT for DDD sh owed promising results(Hunter et al, 2005).  \nMethod: We report on a clinical audit of 36 participants with a diagnosis of chronic DDD who were sequentially recruited \nfrom a specialist UK National Health Service clinic in London. Three outcomes were assessed  (Cambridge Depersonalisation \nScale [CDS], Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] and the Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI]) at three time points in a naturalistic, \nself-controlled, cross -over design. Hierarchical longitudinal analyses for outcome response clustered b y patient were \nperformed using scores from baseline, beginning and end of therapy. The co -variables of age, ethnicity and gender were \npre-specified.  \nResults: Participants did not show a statistically significant change in CDS or BAI between baseline and s tart of treatment, \nhowever there were statistically significant reductions during the treatment period. The reduction in CDS scores in the \nwaiting period was -4.250 (95%CI: -16.592 to 8.092) and after treatment was -35.986 (95%CI: -48.456 to -23.517). BAI \nscores showed a reduction of 0.033 (95% CI: -3.197 to 3.263) during the waiting period and -5.895 (95% CI: -19.126 to -\n2.664) after treatment. Participants showed a statistically significant decrease in BDI scores during the waiting period but a \nlarger red uction after treatment. The reduction in BDI scores was -4.000 (95% CI:  -7.737 to -0.264) in the waiting period \nand –7.813 (95% CI: -11.584 to -4.041). There were no differences in outcome scores between sex and age categories for \nany of the outcomes."

Sound intolerance can be divided into hyperacusis, \nmisophonia and noise sensitivity. Hyperacusis is perception of certain everyday sounds, such as kitchen noises, bangs, \nmusic as too loud or p ainful. Misophonia is perception of certain sounds produced by human beings or animals, such as \neating and breathing noises, as disgusting, offensive or annoying. On the other hand, noise sensitivity is a personality trai t \ninvolving underlying attitudes to wards noise in general. A person with high noise sensitivity may perceive noise caused by \nneighbours, nearby factories, workshops, and air conditioning as disruptive and distressing.

Group CBT for misophonia was superior to waitlist in a \nrandomized trial (Jager et a l., 2020) and case studies of individual CBT have shown promise (see for review, Potgieter et al., \n2019). However, we do not yet know the key maintaining factors for misophonia, making it difficult to develop and refine \ninterventions.  \nObservations from cli nical practice can provide proof of concept for interventions, support the development of theoretical \nmodels and help generate hypotheses to be tested experimentally. This presentation aims to describe a theoretical model \nof misophonia, by reporting on the mes that emerged from clinical practice, hypotheses developed from those themes, \npreliminary results from the research that followed, and a plan for future hypothesis testing.  \nAn Expert by Experience (anonymous by request) will share lessons learned from C BT for misophonia.

APA 2013) within \ncriterion for the diagnosis of Autism.  However, t his representation does not reflect the broader picture of sensory \nprocessing difficulties and the impact upon the young person’s occupational engagement, performance and participation.  \nWithout developing this shared understanding we as professionals will not be able to appreciate the alternative sensory \nreality that many Autistic young people experience, often at odds with and inconceivable to those supporting them.  \nUse of self -report sensory profiles can offer up starting point on which  to invite the young person to share their lived \nexperience and for the clinician to begin to build a fuller picture of the individuals sensory differences. For many young \npeople and for those supporting them, education about sensory processing patterns an d thresholds can be a pivotal \nintervention and lead to a better understanding of ways in which to adapt the environment and interventions.  \nGiven the increased emphasis on sensory features in Autism Diagnosis, This presentation will reflect on current \nunde rstanding of the manifestation of sensory features (difficulty processing and integrating sensory information) and \ntheir relationship to core features of Autism, drawing from the perspectives of young people who are known to the \nNeurodevelopmental Team and  wider CAMHS Service and from recent research in the fields of neuroscience, Sensory \nIntegration and developmental conditions.  \n \n \nWhat makes groupwork work?  \nChair: Nicola Walker, University of Sheffield, UK  \n \nMaking Affirmative CBT Groups Work for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth: The Role of Facilitator Training  \nShelley  Craig , University of Toronto , Canada ; Austin  Ashley , Barry University , USA ; Iacono  Gio, University of \nConnecticut , USA  \nIntroduction : Empiric ally-supported interventions (ESIs) for marginalized populations can contribute to equitable mental \nhealth services. Their effectiveness is dependent on implementation fidelity, which hinges on the facilitator being trained \nto deliver the intervention comp etently. Yet, despite the risks encountered by sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY), \nand the proliferation of groups to meet their needs, few ESI’s address the training needs of group clinicians. As the first E SI \ndesigned for SGMY, AFFIRM is an affirmat ive cognitive -behavioral therapeutic (CBT) group intervention that has been \nfound to improve coping and reduce depression (Craig et. al, 2021). To promote fidelity, an AFFIRM Facilitator Training was \ndesigned. The training, informed by experiential learnin g theory, is a two -day (14 -hour) intensive training that integrates \ndidactic and experiential learning (e.g., role play, problem -based learning). This study evaluated the training, which aims to \nensure effective delivery of AFFIRM in a range of settings.  \nMethod : Training participants (n=58) represented diverse sexual (33% gay, 29% lesbian, 21% bisexual, 13% pansexual, 4% \nheterosexual); gender (52% female, 40% male, 8% transgender, 4% gender non -conforming); ethnoracial (42% Caucasian, \n29% Asian, 19% Black,  5% Indigenous, 5% Latinx) and professional identities (e.g., community workers, case managers, \nsocial workers, psychologists).  The Affirmative CBT Facilitator Competence Scale (ACCS) (\n  = 0.922), is a 7 -item scale \ndesigned to measure confidence to implem ent Affirmative CBT. Qualitative feedback was also collected.  \nResults : There was a significant difference between pre (M=14.92, SD = 4.84) and the post training competence scores \n(M=20.58, SD = 4.02); t(57) = -9.206, p &lt; .001. Participants also noted that “I learned how to incorporate affirming \nLGBTQ+ identities with CBT” and “I feel more confident to utilize the group to meet youth needs”. Our results suggest that \nthe training components had a significant impact on clinician competence.  \nDiscussion : As finding practitioners with the expertise to facilitate group -based ESIs  can be challenging, the importance of \nproviding effective training to ensure groups are being delivered to underserved populations is of critical importance. The \npresentation will explore training considerations for groups drawn from AFFIRM.  \nReferences : \nCraig, S. L., Iacono, G., Austin, A., Eaton, A. D., Pang, N., Leung, V., & Frey, C. (2021).

There \nare few work -focused psychotherapeutic interventions which are effective in both treating depression and enhancing job \nretention. Therefore, the aim of this study was to design a new treatment programme to help employed service -users of \nCommunity Mental Health Teams who are at  risk of losing their jobs.  \nMethod: This case study shows how we (i) designed the intervention using component analysis of existing literature and \nfocus groups of frontline practitioners and former service users and mind -mapping analysis to establish its o perational \nlogic; and (ii) evaluated the theory underpinning the intervention using realist synthesis and evaluation to establish its \nconceptual logic.  \nFindings: An iterative hybrid approach of literature review, component analysis, focus group discussion,  and realist \nmethods established the initial design and programme theory for the new intervention. The intervention focused on three \nareas of therapy, three inter -dependent outcomes, in a group format, with opportunities created for peer interaction. The \nmain theoretical principles most likely to promote efficacy were to accelerate and optimise activation of one or more of six \nhypothesised mechanisms: realise, reflect, regulate, resolve, relate, and retain/resume in the context of skilfully facilitat ed \ngrou p psychotherapy. The new intervention is called a work -focused relational Group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy \n(GCBT) treatment programme.  \nDiscussion: This study outlines a methodological approach based on the layered ontology of critical realist philosophy , \napplied to a successful example, which will be useful during the early stages of design and development of new group -\nbased psychotherapeutic interventions.  \nBy adopting the critical realist approach, we identified underlying mechanisms of  \nchange in relati onal group CBT. Whilst it is unlikely that all biases were eliminated because the sample was small and self -\nselected, a major strength of this study is the participatory approach with a high degree of user involvement. The \ntheoretically integrated approach  involving service -users and practitioners from different professional backgrounds was \nunique and meant that the treatment programme was multi -modal rather than informed by a single therapeutic or \ntheoretical approach. The new intervention is also fully sp ecified and manualised.  \nReferences:  \nWalker, N. and Hall, S., (in press) The initial design and programme theory for a new work -focused psychotherapeutic \nintervention to treat moderate -severe recurrent depression and enhance job retention .

CBT is the main modality for depression within IAPT, with other approaches offered in a limited capacity. Arts \npsychotherapies are rarely provided despite their attractivene ss to clients. Therefore, in order to expand clients’ choice \nand following MRC framework (2006) for developing complex interventions, we developed a new creative psychological \ntherapy integrating evidence -based approaches with arts psychotherapies called A rts for the Blues.  \nMethods : Following systematic review of mechanisms of change in evidence - based therapies and arts psychotherapies for \ndepression and pilot workshops in IAPT we identified eight key ingredients underpinning Arts for the Blues model. The  \nmodel was tested in 12 sessions intervention with clients from MIND.  \nResults : During the conference key ingredients of Arts for the Blues will be presented alongside results from IAPT \nworkshops (n= 13) and MIND intervention (n=7). Workshops and intervent ions were evaluated using PHQ9, GAD7, WHO5 \nand PANAS measures. Qualitative data from focus groups and interviews was also collected.  \nDiscussion : The evidence -based foundation, creative content and pluralistic nature of this new approach aligned with eight  \nclient -identified key ingredients for positive therapy outcomes make it a promising therapy option. Arts for the Blues \nreceived substantial funding from Edge Hill University, University of Salford, CCG and AHRC to develop this intervention \nfurther.

The ERA study has several unique \ndesign features including use of video to help patients give a preference for the type of art therapy they want, focus on \ngroup provision to people with a range of menta l health diagnoses, and arts -based workshops with therapists to develop a \nworking manual and practice principles of group arts therapies for the trial.

However, changing one behaviour can spill over to others, either positively (e.g. exercise lead s \nto more socialisin g) or negatively (e.g. exercise leads to greater consumption of unhealthy food). The TURBBO project is \ndeveloping an open access knowledge base to visualise and facilitate understanding of the relationship between \nbehaviours. We first developed a behaviour al ontology to provide a means of describing the entities used in the \nbehavioural domain and the relationships between them.  \nMethods : A co -design approach used workshops featuring interactive tools to generate the behavioural ontology. \nParticipants were b ehavioural scientists and practitioners from varied fields who discussed the core concepts of behaviour \nand key questions for the knowledge base.  \nResults : The project has generated an initial ‘upper and middle ontology’ describing (i) cross -domain charact eristics of \nbehaviours and their associated concepts (e.g., measurement, context, temporality, and co -occurrence), and (ii) a \nstructural hierarchy of behaviours (e.g., walking is a form of physical activity).  \nDiscussion : The ontology provides a structured knowledge base for behavioural practitioners and scientists to input data \non the relationship between behaviours.

Whilst most trainees are existing mental health professionals, the style of \nworking is often new, in particular, the approach that is called Guided Discovery. This is an integral part of formulation an d \ntreatment requiring trainees to refrain from advice giving, instead emphasising collaboration and Socratic Dialogue. This \ncan be in stark contrast to the more didactic style that trainees are familiar with prior to embarking on their training. Lit tle \nis known at present about the experiences of CBT trainees when learning this new skill, specifically, how they assimilate \nthis with existing ways of working and the challenges this might involve. This research is a preliminary attempt to \nunderstand factors th at help and hinder skill acquisition. Eighteen trainee CBT practitioners undertaking the final modiule \nof IAPT high intensity training completed an online questionnaire answering eight open ended questions that sought to \nunderstand their experience of lear ning skills in GD. In particular, the questions looked to determine factors that assisted in \nunderstanding GD and potential obstacles. A grounded theory approach was applied to the data with four key themes \nemerging. These themes were used to develop a pre liminary model of factors that enable or inhibit skills in GD. \nImplications of the findings for CBT trainers.  \n \nDigital self -management intervention for people living with Long COVID  \nFaith  Martin , Coventry University , UK; Hayley  Wright , Coventry University , UK; Andy  Turner , Coventry \nUniversity , UK \nIntroduction : Long COVID affects 1.3 million people in the UK. People describe uncertainty about how to mana ge it, with \nhigh levels of anxiety and depression. There is an urgent need support self -management with low intensity, scalable \ninterventions.  \nMethod : We co -developed an 8 -week digital intervention. It includes behavioural techniques of pacing and cognitiv e \ntechniques for managing unhelpful thoughts and rumination. It is delivered asynchronously through online text and videos, \nwith trained facilitators and optional online meetings. Outcomes were the Warwick -Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale \n(WEMWBS) and Self -Efficacy to Self -Manage, pre and post course. WEMWBS scores correlate highly with common \ndepression and anxiety measures. Open ended questions asked participants to comment on their experiences.  \nResults : Data were from 28 people who completed the interve ntion and measures. Mostly female (83%), White British \n(91%) and employed (78%). WEMWBS and self -efficacy scores significantly increased. Participants talked about the flexible \nnature of the intervention being easy to use around their symptoms and lives, a nd found the structured approach of \ndifferent topics per session helpful.  \nDiscussion : The change in outcomes provides initial support for the intervention. Qualitative data describe the major \nadvantage of our delivery mode for a population living with a fluctuating and fatiguing condition. We are now conducting \nevaluations against a control group and over 6 months.  \n \nSingle Case Experimental Designs: Methodological innovations and clinical challenges  \nChair: Stephen Kellett, University of Sheffield and R otherham Doncaster and South Humber NHS Foundation \nTrust, UK  \n \nCo-production of SCED - the tensions and the potential.  \nStephen  Kellett , University of Sheffield and Rotherham Doncaster and South Humber NHS Foundation Trust, UK  \nand Lisa Alhadeff, Expert by experience  \nIntroduction: Whilst the individual patient and their outcomes are at the heart of SCED, the patient tends to be used as a \n'data collector' rather than a 'co -evaluator' of change.   The aim of the presentation is to explain and demonstrate the \npotential for co -production in SCED in the evaluation of outcome for a patient with bi -polar disorder.   \nMethods: An A1/B/A2/C with extended follow -up S CED with a female patient meeting diagnostic criteria for bipolar \ndisorder.  Following the 6 -week baseline period ‘A1’, treatment occurred in two phases (18 ‘B’ and 6 sessions ‘C’) \nsandwiching a 12 -week treatment withdrawal phase (‘A2’) and a 24 -week struc tured follow -up phase. Five idiographic daily \nmeasures were collected daily to create a 622 -day timeline. The PHQ -9 and the Mania Rating Scale were completed after \neach treatment session. The participant held two roles: as the patient and provider of the i diographic/nomothetic \noutcomes and also as part of the research team through providing a commentary on the outcomes identified."

Even though RCTs  provide valuable information, they also show some disadvantages, such as \nthe requirement of large samples or the presence of control or waiting list conditions. These issues can be particularly \nimportant when dealing with a novel intervention whose effica cy is still not known. In this sense, single case experimental \ndesigns (SCEDs) are an adequate methodological alternative to RCTs, allowing to explore the feasibility and preliminary \nefficacy of a new intervention with a small number of participants and wi thout the need for a control condition. In this \npresentation, we will provide examples of SCEDs applied to the specific field of virtual reality and, more specifically, to \nexplore the effects of novel virtual -reality based interventions addressing autobiog raphical memory impairments and \nbehavioural activation in depression. We will discuss the advantages of integrating SCEDs with virtual -reality treatments, as \nwell as the methodological issues observed throughout the studies.  \nReferences:  \nColombo, D., Suso -Ribera, C., Ortigosa -Beltrán, I., Fernández -álvarez, J., García -Palacios, A., & Botella, C.

In this presentation, we will highlight the methodology that was used in a Single Case \nExperiential Desig n.   \nMethods:  A study with a single -case experimental design (‘n of 1’), in which a heterosexual couple act as their own control \nand the study is then replicated in subsequent couples, was conducted. Thirty -five couples were assessed for eligibility to \nparticipate. Twenty -nine couples without any sexual problems were randomized and 12 submitted sufficient data to \nanalyse. As a proxy for reducing penis length, we artificially reduced the depth of penetration by using different sizes of \nsilicone rings around  the base of the man’s erect penis. The main outcome measures were provided by the female partner \non a scale of 0 –100 and comprised: degree of (i) overall sexual pleasure; (ii) sexual pleasure from intercourse alone; and \n(iii) emotional connection to the m ale partner. The female partner was also asked before the experiment began to rate the \ndegree of positive or negative change that would be personally meaningful for her.  \nResults: On average, reducing the depth of penetration led to a statistically signific ant 18% reduction of overall sexual \npleasure with an average 15% reduction in length of the penis. The longer the erect penis, the less likely the rings were to \nhave an impact on sexual pleasure. There was a range of individual responses, however, with a m inority of women \nreporting that reducing the depth of penetration was more pleasurable on some occasions.  \nDiscussion: Size may matter in women in a healthy stable relationship when there is penile shortening. Because of the \nsmall number of couples and the inclusion of men with an apparently long penis, our results are preliminary, and we \nwelcome replication in a larger sample with a more diverse range of penile lengths. Our results should not be \nmisinterpreted as meaning that increasing penile length will i ncrease sexual pleasure in women."

We report a large multi -centre RCT \ntesting the effectiveness of DS -specific CBT in adults with DSs.  \nMethod: 368 adults with  DSs were randomised to receive DS -specific CBT plus standardised medical care (CBT+SMC; \nn=186) vs SMC -alone (n=182). Our primary outcome was monthly DS frequency 12 -months post -randomisation; secondary \noutcomes were also evaluated at 12 months. Unplanned secondary analyses considered outcomes 6 months post -\nrandomisation, near the end of CBT.  \nResults: At 12 months post -randomisation monthly DS frequency did not differ between arms but 9/16 secondary \noutcomes were better in the CBT+SMC arm (p&lt;0.05), of w hich 5 were better at p≤0.001 e.g., less impairment (Work & \nSocial Adjustment Scale) and more DS -free days in the last 6 months (Goldstein et al, 2020 doi.org/10.1016/S2215 -\n0366(20)30128 -0). Secondary analysis (Goldstein et al, 2022) found that 13/14 outco mes measured at 6 - and 12 -months \npost -randomisation were better in the CBT+SMC arm at 6 months (p&lt;0.05, including monthly DSs).  \nDiscussion: Our 12 -month evaluation showed no between -arms difference in DS frequency but benefits in psychosocial and \nDS-related outcomes. Secondary analysis indicated wider benefits including for DS frequency.

We developed a cognitive behavioural \nmodel of DS which assumes that an initial physiological trigger begins a vicious cycle in which cognitive, attributional, \nphysiological, affective and social factors fuel avoidant behaviour. Treatment techniques include a combination of DS \nspecific techniques devised to interrupt the seizures and some transdiagnostic cognitive and behavioural s trategies are \nused to suit the needs of individual patients. In brief patients are encouraged to utilise techniques that help them to \ncontrol seizures and engage in avoided activities over 12 sessions.

We randomised pe ople with MD who were \ndistressed to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) plus usual medical care (UMC) or UMC alone. This two -arm, \nrandomised, multicentre, parallel design recruited 155 patients with MD. 138 people completed the 9 week study. \nParticipan ts receiving ACT were supported by a therapist in using 4 skills to help them manage the challenges of daily life \nmore flexibly. These were mindfulness, ways of stepping back from thoughts and taking an observer perspective, help in \nidentifying what was im portant to them and encouragement in living life according to what was personally meaningful. At \n9 weeks post randomisation, the participants receiving ACT demonstrated a marked improvement in their quality of life, \nincluding their independence, social and  emotional functioning and body image. They also noted improvements in their \noverall mood, a secondary but nonetheless important measure of wellbeing.significant with moderate to large effect sizes. \nACT in addition to usual care was effective in improving QoL and other psychological and social outcomes in patients with \nMuscle Disease.

Moderation analyses of baseline characteristics determined who benefited from being offered \nCBT; and if effects were absent we tested whether baseline variables predicted change, irrespective of treatment \nallocation.  \nResults : We found CBT reduced DS frequency for participants with more (≥22) symptoms or ≥1 current comorbid \npsychiatric diagnosis (p&lt;0.05); and the effect of CBT on PCS scores was moderated by gender, where women did better \nthan  men in the CBT+SMC group. Predictors of improved outcome included: not receiving disability benefits, lower \nanxiety/depression scores (PCS, MCS, WSAS); shorter duration, younger age at DS onset, employment, fewer symptoms \nand higher educational qualificat ion (PCS, WSAS); stronger belief in the diagnosis and in CBT as a “logical” treatment (MCS).  \nDiscussion : Patient complexity interacted with treatment.

A pilot RCT has recently \ncompared ADepT to CBT in the treatment of depression, randomising 41 adult participants to each arm. This qualitative \ninterview study explored experiences of undergoing ADepT treatment in a subset of those in the A DepT arm of the trial.   \nMethod: Eighteen participants who received ADepT attended semi -structured interviews after the end of treatment using \npurposive sampling. The qualitative data was analysed using the Framework method and implementing an integrative \ndeductive and inductive approach.  \nResults: Overall, participants were satisfied with ADepT and talked about undergoing a positive transformation through \ntreatment. Participants reported learning to act opposite to deprossogenic patterns to help them maxim ise opportunities \nand minimise challenges in life, a process that continued beyond the end of treatment. Participants found the concurrent \nfocusing on reducing depression and enhancing wellbeing acceptable. Key perceived helpful elements of change included  \nenabling the positives, becoming more proactive, gaining confidence and motivation, discovering themselves beyond \ndepression, cultivating self -compassion, and living a values consistent life. Although the therapy was perceived as \nchallenging, most partici pants appreciated the need to work hard to experience benefits."

Before proceeding to definitive trial evaluation of ADepT, it is \nimportant to establish if a larger workforce in routine care setting s can be trained to competently deliver ADepT and to \ncanvas their views on the approach.  \nMethod: A cohort of eleven IAPT experienced CBT high intensity therapists underwent a six -month training in ADepT, \nconsisting of a one -day initial workshop, weekly tw o-hour skills practice sessions for a month, treating at least two cases \nwhile receiving weekly small group supervision for a six -month period, and tape feedback at the end of training.  \nResults: The proportion of therapists completing the training and who  were judged to reach competence criteria will be \nreported, as will clinical outcomes in the cases they treated.

Augmented Depression Therapy (ADepT) \nhas previously been shown to be effective in treating depression across the adult life span. The current study preliminarily \nexamines if ADepT may be beneficial for treating depress ion in the 18 -24 year age range specifically.  \nMethod: A mixed methods multiple randomised baseline case series designed was used, recruiting eleven clinically \ndepressed young adults from a university wellbeing service. Many of the sample also presented wit h anxiety, features of \nemotional and interpersonal dysregulation linked to previous complex trauma, and neuroatypical features. Participants \ncompleted weekly measures of wellbeing and depression during the baseline and treatment phase and a longer battery of \noutcomes measures at intake, pre -treatment, post -treatment and two -month follow -up. Participants also underwent a \nqualitative interview to explore their experiences of ADepT.   \nResults: Clinical outcomes will be examined at the within -participant and gr oup level.

Despite this, few studies have evaluated BA as a treatment for \nacute bipolar depression. In this study we sought to establish the feasibility and acceptab ility of the therapy and research \nprocedures, as well as the potential for an adapted BA protocol (BA -B) to represent a safe and effective treatment option \nfor this patient group. A secondary aim was to explore relationships between depression and hypomani a symptoms, \ndistress and engagement in valued activity within participants across the course of therapy.  \nMethod: Within a two -wave, randomised -multiple -baseline, ABA case -series design we offered BA -B to adults experiencing \na current episode of depression within bipolar I or II disorder.

How did we support choice of intervention, how did we support PWPs \nand how did we gather the outcomes?  \nCharlotte  Bee, Pennine Care NHS , UK; Stephen  Kellett , University of Sheffield , UK; Jessica  Smithies , Pennine Care \nNHS , UK; Vikki  Aadahl , Pennine Care NHS , UK; Mel Simmonds -Buckley , University of Sheffield , UK  \nIntroduction : There is both a moral reason f or supporting patient choice and there is a convincing evidence base that \nshows that when patient preferences are supported, this improves indices of service engagement and clinical outcome.  \nThe IAPT manual advises therefore offering a choice of treatment  to patients accessing any step of the service.  Clinical \ntrials however reduce choice by taking the treatment decision out of the participant’s hands and using technology to \nrandomly assign people to the arms of a trial.  This risks people not engaging be cause of lack of choice and dropping out \nwhen they do not receive the treatment that they want.  Outcomes may therefore more strongly reflect preference than \nintervention.  The methodological solution to this issue is to complete patient preference randomi sed controlled trials.  All \ntreatments at step 2 of IAPT are currently low intensity cognitive -behavioural guided self -help (CBT -GSH) and so a \nmanualized guided self -help (GSH) version of cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) has been developed and piloted (CAT -GSH). \nWe aim to describe the methods of a four -arm patient preference randomised clinical trial (arm 1 randomised to CAT -GSH, \narm 2 preference for CAT -GSH, arm 3 randomised to CBT -GSH and arm 4 preference for CBT -GSH).  \nMethod : Participants meet diagnostic  criteria for any anxiety disorder (defined by the MINI and the Beck Anxiety Inventory \n(BAI)) and are deemed suitable for a step 2 intervention (i.e. GSH delivered by a psychological wellbeing practitioner; PWP).  \nParticipants are presented with standardise d treatment information and indicate a preference of CAT -GSH, CBT -GSH or \nrandomization to either CBT -GSH or CAT -GSH.  One session per treatment has been sampled and PWP competency \nassessed. The primary outcome measure is the BAI and secondary outcomes incl ude uptake, attendance and dropout rates \nand contrasting sessional outcomes on the IAPT minimum dataset (PHQ -9 and GAD -7).  Follow -up occurs at 8 and 24 \nweeks.  \nResults : The presentation will report via a CONSORT diagram the recruitment, preference, retenti on and follow -up rates \nand will report on the manner past engagement with the service influences current treatment preferences when the \npatient returns to the service.  \nDiscussion  \nThat expanding patient choice is possible and that patients at step 2 clearly  want to exert a choice over their treatment \noptions.  The pros and cons of conducting a pragmatic trial at step 2 of a busy IAPT service will be discussed  \n \nAssessing how the therapies were delivered: the relationship between PWP competence and patient \noutcome  \nNiall  Power , The University of Sheffield, UK  \nIntroduction: There is scarce research on the relationship between practitioner competence in low intensity psychological \ninterventions and treatment outcome. Therefore, this study investigated the association between practitioner competence \nin delivering guided self -help (GSH) and clinical outcome, rate of clinical change, need for f urther intervention, attendance \nand drop out.  \nMethod: Data from a randomised controlled patient preference trial of GSH for anxiety disorders in an Improving Access to \nPsychological Therapies service were used. The trial compared GSH based on cognitive ana lytic therapy (CAT -GSH) with \nstandard GSH based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT -GSH). Sessions were randomly sampled from the 6 -8 session \nmanualised treatments (CAT -GSH, n=60 and CBT -GSH, n=20) and rated using a validated competence rating tool. A ‘ful ly \ncrossed’ independent rating design was used with two independent rating groups. Competence ratings were then used to \nexplore associations with anxiety, depression and functioning, treatment engagement (attendance and drop -out), and \nneed for further inte rvention.  \nResults: Competence ratings had very high inter -rater reliability across all competence levels and in both treatments \n(intraclass correlation coefficients between 0.85 and 0.99). No significant associations were found between competence \nand clini cal outcome, treatment engagement or need for further intervention. Competence did not predict rate of change \nin anxiety symptoms."

A \nsample of n=12 PWPs experienced in delivering CAT -GSH were interviewed.  \nResults: Five over -arching themes (containing 12 subthemes) were identified and conceptually mapped: (a) the past -\npresent focus (made up of working with clients’ pasts and the different type of change work), (b) expanding the treatmen t \noffer (from the perspective of PWPs and clients), (c) the time and resources required to effectively deliver CAT -GSH (to \nenable safe and effective delivery for clients and personal/professional development for PWPs), (d) understanding CAT -\nGSH (made up of  confidence, learning new therapeutic language/concepts and appreciating the difference with CBT -GSH) \nand (e) joint exploration (made up of therapeutic/supervisory relationships and enhanced collaboration).  \nConclusion: CAT -GSH appears an acceptable (but ch allenging) approach for PWPs to deliver in IAPT services. Services \nshould prioritise training and supervision for PWPs to ensure good governance of delivery.  \nReferences:  \nKellett, S., Bee, C., Aadahl, V., Headley, E., & Delgadillo, J. (2021).

An adapted Client Change \nInterview (Elliott, 2011) schedule was used. Changes were categorised and non -parametric analysis examined differences \nbetween the two groups.

Both experienced cognitive, behavioural, \nemotional and relational change. Five overarching themes were fo und; ‘Personal qualities of success’; ‘Enlightenment \nthrough understanding’; ‘Specific tools and techniques’; ‘Relationships’; ‘Tailoring support’. Four themes maximally \ndifferentiated between the two treatment groups.  \nDiscussion : A combination of model s pecific and common factors contributed to the process of change.

This \nstudy is the first ImRs study for psychosis to incorporate experimental controls. We used a novel ImRs protocol, targeting \npresent -focused, self -referential distressing meanings associated with intrusive trauma  memories. A multiple baseline case \nseries design investigated whether the protocol was feasible, safe, acceptable and effective.  \nMethods: 12 participants with a psychosis diagnosis and intrusive trauma memories were assessed and randomised to a \nmonitorin g period (one, two or three weeks), followed by three ImRs sessions (over three weeks), a further two -week \nmonitoring period with a post -therapy assessment a week after completing therapy. Memory phenomenology was \nassessed daily during monitoring. Post -traumatic stress symptoms and wellbeing were assessed pre and post therapy.  \nResults: ImRs was feasible, safe and rated as highly acceptable.

There were moderate effects on the frequency, distres s, controllability and appraisals of trauma memories. \nNotably, ten participants showed reliable change, and seven clinically significant change, in post -traumatic stress \nsymptoms.  \nConclusions: The study indicates that a brief, novel ImRs protocol targeting present -focused, self -referential meanings is a \npromising intervention for intrusive trauma memories.

There are few \ntrials exploring trauma -focused treatments as interventions f or psychotic symptoms, especially in individuals with early \npsychosis. This trial evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a definitive trial of Eye Movement \nDesensitization and Reprocessing for psychosis (EMDRp) in people with early psych osis.  \nMethods: 60 service users with a history of a traumatic/ adverse life events were recruited from Early Intervention \n(EI)services in the North West of England and randomized to receive 16 sessions of EMDRp + Treatment as Usual (TAU) or \nTAU alone. Par ticipants were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months post -randomization using several measures of \npsychotic symptoms, trauma symptoms, anxiety, depression, functioning, service -user defined recovery. Two nested \nqualitative studies to assess participant fee dback of therapy and views of professional stakeholders on the implementation \nof EMDRp into services were also conducted.  \nResults: We examined several feasibility outcomes, including ability to recruit and randomize participants, trial retention a t  \nfollo w-up assessments, treatment engagement and ability to deliver EMDRp with a high level of fidelity in EI settings . \nDespite the impact that the COVID -19 pandemic had on the trial, leading to several adaptations to our recruitment, \nassessment, and treatment delivery procedures, all quantitative data pertaining to these feasibility outcomes confirmed \nthe overall viability of this line of research. Analysis of quantitative outcomes also suggested promise of efficacy of EMDRp  \nagainst TAU on several clinically me aningful outcome. The qualitative data suggested that the experience of receiving \nEMDRp was overall positive and associated with personally -valued gains, but sometimes understandably challenging for \nparticipants with complex trauma histories.  Service user s and clinicians made several recommendations to better prepare \nclients for trauma -focused work in EI settings, with implications beyond EMDRp and applicable to the delivery of CBT \ntrauma -focused protocols.   \nDiscussion: Our findings are promising and sugg est that further larger scale research is warranted to evaluate whether \nEMDRp represents a beneficial treatment to augment existing evidence -based care of individuals with early psychosis \nsupported by EI services.  \n \nThe bumpy road of trauma -focused treatment: PTSD symptom exacerbation in people with psychosis  \nSimone  Burger , VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands ; Amy  Hardy, King’s College London & South London \n& Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK ; Tineke  van der Linden , GGzE Mental Health Institute, the Netherlands ; \nAgnes  van Minnen , Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen, the Netherlands ; Mark  van der Gaag , VU University \nAmsterdam, The Netherlands ; David  van den Berg , VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands   \nIntroduction: Concern for symptom exacerbation and treatment drop -out is an important barrier to implementation o f \ntrauma -focused treatment, especially in people with psychosis diagnoses.  \nObjective: We investigated PTSD symptom exacerbation during eye movement desensitization reprocessing (EMDR) \ntherapy and prolonged exposure (PE) in a sample of 99 participants with PTSD and psychosis. We also tested whether \nexacerbation predicted drop -out or poor treatment response.   \nMethod: This study was part of a multicenter randomized controlled trial.

The \ninterviews were transcribed and a critical realist approach adopted for thematic analysis.  \nResults: Three superordinate themes were identified during analysis. These were: 1) Breaking the s ilence, 2) Dilemmas in \ntrauma -focussed therapy and 3) Need for support.

According to CBT models, difficulties tolerating \nuncertainty about the meaning of bodily sensations may foster selective attention toward body signals, which further \namplifies the fear of cata strophic physical consequences, thus fueling health anxiety (HA). In the current study, we aimed \nto expand extant knowledge on the interplay between IU and AS in predicting HA in an Italian community -based sample \nrecruited before the pandemic.  \nMethod: Four -hundred and thirteen Italian individuals (65.6% female; Mage=38.92±14) completed an online survey \ncontaining self -report measures including the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale -Revised, the Anxiety Sensitivity Index -3, the \nHealth Anxiety Questionnaire, an d the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales -21. Among participants, 101 (24.5%) reported \nsuffering from medical health problems. We first examined whether there was a specific indirect effect of IU on HA \nthrough the AS dimensions (i.e., Physical, Cognitive, and  Social Concerns) by running a parallel multiple mediation model \n(Model 1). An alternative model testing the indirect effect of the three AS dimensions on HA through IU was also evaluated \n(Model 2). Medical status (i.e., healthy/unhealthy) and general dist ress were included as covariates in both models.  \nResults. With respect to Model 1, the total effect model was significant (adjusted R2=.35, F3,408=72.04, p&lt;.001). Only AS \nPhysical Concerns significantly mediated the path from IU to HA (b=.1621, SE=.0375, 95% CIs=.0957, .2454). General \ndistress was a significant covariate, whereas medical status was not. Model 2 was also significant (adjusted R2=.39, \nF5,406=52.04, p&lt;.001). Findings showed that IU totally mediated the paths from AS Cognitive Con cerns (b=.1995, \nSE=.0601, 95% CIs=.0965, .3361) and AS Social Concerns (b=.0824, SE=.0427, 95% CIs=.0069, .1745) to HA. AS Physical \nConcerns was directly related to HA, but the indirect effect through IU was not significant. General distress was the only \nsignificant covariate.  \nDiscussion: Current findings align with previous literature outlining that IU and AS interact in promoting HA. However, IU \nseems to play a prominent role in such a complex interplay, thus tentatively suggesting that AS may be the way through \nwhich IU operates in HA.

Cognitive models of anxiety disorders and, specifically, generalised anxiety disorders \ntypically focus on the strong link between intolerance of uncertainty and worry. However, interoceptive awareness -the \nability to perceive and sense bodily sensations - has been pointed out as another potentially crucial element that might lead \nto distress or worry.  \nMethods : In this study, we evaluate the potential mediation role of interoceptive awareness between intolerance of \nuncertainty (measured by the IUS -5; Bottesi et al., 2020) and worry (measured by the PSWQ -3; Kertz et al., 2014) in an \nEnglish -speaking and a Spanish -speaking commun ity sample collected from late 2020 to early 2021.  \nResults : Our results supported the mediation role of interoceptive awareness in both the English -speaking (B = 0.061, p = \n.000, 95% CI [0.028, 0.110]) and the Spanish -speaking sample (B = 0.198, p = .000, 95% CI [0.099, 0.301]).  \nDiscussion : These results highlight  the importance of interoceptive awareness in managing uncertainty, specifically in those \nwith high levels of intolerance of uncertainty.

While traditional accounts of IU represent it as a set of beliefs about uncertainty, which are certainly \npresent in generalized anxiety disorder, other accounts propose that IU represents a felt sense of unsafety that is aversive \nand may lead to cogniti ve representations of uncertainty and threat. This study investigates whether the relationship \nbetween IU and anxiety is mediated by interoceptive awareness. It further considers whether anxiety sensitivity (AS), a \nwell-established vulnerability factor, mo derates this relationship in that physical AS would strengthen the relationship with \nhealth anxiety, whilst social AS would strengthen the relationship with social anxiety.  \nMethods: A community sample (N = 197) was recruited from a variety of sources. As part of a larger survey, participants \ncompleted established measures of IU, health and social anxiety, and anxiety sensitivity, as well as a novel measure of \ninteroceptive awareness. The Inventory of Differential Interoceptive Awareness consists of four su bscales, Listening, \nNoticing, and Trusting in relation to positive and negative internal states, as well as Unsafety, which is the perception of \nthe body as not well known, alien, and unfamiliar.   \nResults: Significant direct effects were detected between IU and health and social anxiety. The relationship between IU and \nhealth anxiety was mediated by Listening and Unsafety as well as a serial path through Trusting and Unsafety, but was not \nmoderated by physical AS. The relationship between IU and social anx iety was mediated by Unsafety and a serial path \nthrough Trusting and Unsafety; both indirect effects were moderated by social AS. The indirect effects were significant at \nabove median levels of social AS and increasing.  \nDiscussion: These findings replicat e the relationship between IU and two different types of anxiety and extend previous \nknowledge by identifying a potential role of people’s sense of their body state in understanding how IU leads to anxiety.  \nThe results also provide preliminary evidence fo r how IU and AS may both contribute to the severity of social anxiety \nsymptoms. Replication is needed and future studies should test similar models for panic symptoms, worry, and other \nmental health problems with a significant anxiety component.  \n \nThe felt sense of the unknown: Interoceptive appraisals and emotional reactions in uncertain every -day life \nsituations.  \nJessi  Komes , Newcastle University , UK; Jessi  Komes , Newcastle University , UK; Finlay  Murray , Newcastle \nUniversity , UK; Hannah Edgar  Barrows , Newcastle University , UK; Andrea -Christina  Nemes , Newcastle \nUniversity , UK; Mark  Freeston , Newcastle University , UK  \nIntroduction: Uncertainty is a felt sense of unsafety rather than a detection of threat. This felt sense may be experienced a s \na bodily/bottom -up source of in formation. How internal signals are experienced and labelled will determine responses to \nuncertain situations. Applying the somatic error hypothesis to Intolerance of Uncertainty, the uncomfortable feelings \ngenerated by the unknown -ness of a situation may be attributed not to uncertainty but to an expectation of threat. The \ncurrent study investigated the experience of uncertainty in everyday life situation with a novel methodology that links the \nfelt sense of uncertainty in the situation to appraisals of th at sense and individual differences in interoceptive awareness.  \nMethods:  Participants (N = 150) rated the salience of uncertain situations where the most obvious negative outcome had \nbeen excluded.  They chose the most salient situation and were asked to scan their body while imagining it. Participants \nthen completed measures appraising the sensation and their emotional reaction to the situation. They then completed \nmeasures of physical sensations they experience in unknown situations and a measure of inte roceptive awareness.  \nResults: The measure of emotional reactions resulted in factors named nervous, excited, hostile, proud, and attentive. The \nfirst three served as outcome variables in hierarchical regressions. Age, gender and scenario salience were ente red as \ncovariates. Appraisals (factors labelled nagging, familiar, valence and overwhelming) were entered first, followed by \nphysical sensations (factors labelled tense, stomach, twitchy, dissociated) and finally by a measure of interoceptive \nsensibility. Salience was not significant, and different appraisals and sensations predicted the different emotions, while \ninteroceptive awareness made a significant contribution for nervousness.  \nDiscussion: Results show proof of concept for a methodology to investigat e the experience of uncertainty that does not \nequate uncertainty with threat. The emotional reactions reflect a differentiated response to uncertainty and there is \npreliminary evidence for appraisals and physical sensations that may be specifically associa ted with these emotional \nresponses. Warranting replication and further validation, these preliminary results are promising to further an \nunderstanding of how somatic errors  qualify the relationship between IU and a number of anxiety -related mental health \ndisorders."

The mental health disparities in the \nlesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer plus other (LGBTQ+) community continue to persist despite evidence of  \nincreased societal support and legislative measures and are likely to have been magnified by the recent socio -behavioural \nisolation enforcement measures in the pandemic. However there is a dearth of data to demonstrate this, reflecting the lack \nof nationa l data collection within the UK.

Little research has investigated whether this disparity \nexists in childhood or how changes in sexual identity relate to self -esteem.  \nMethod: Participants were 2373 adolescents (879 males and 1494 females) from the Avon Longitudi nal Study of Parents \nand Children (ALSPAC) project, an ongoing longitudinal study (Boyd et al., 2013). Multiple regression analyses investigated \nthe relationships between sexual orientation at age 15 and 21 years and sexual orientation stability with self -esteem at age \n8 and 17 years while controlling for demographic variables, abuse, and bullying. To test for sex differences, the interaction  \neffect between sex at birth and sexual orientation was included as a predictor.  \nResults: Sexual minority status at a ge 15 years, but not at age 21 years, was associated with lower self -esteem at age 8 \nyears. Only a shift from sexual minority at age 15 years to heterosexual at age 21 years associated with lower self -esteem \nat age 8 relative to consistent heterosexuality.  Sexual minority status at 15 and 21 years was associated with low self -\nesteem at age 17 years, regardless of reported change or stability in sexual orientation between ages 15 and 21 years.  \nControlling for bullying and abuse did not affect the strengths of these associations. The interaction term between sexual \norientation and sex at birth was not significant.  \nDiscussion: The self -esteem discrepancy between sexual minority people and heterosexuals emerges as early as 8 years of \nage. Although adjusting fo r abuse and bullying did not affect the strengths of the associations, there were limitations with \nthe assessment methods and it is recommended that these and other potential contributory factors should be investigated \nin future research.  \nReferences:  \nArygriou, A., Goldsmith, K.

It has been suggested that minority stress explains this \ndisparity, partly by elevating rates of general risk factors including low self -esteem. Low self -esteem can impair daily \nfunctioning and is also a risk or maintenance factor for several mental health problems.  Self -esteem therefore presents a \npotential target for intervention to reduce mental h ealth inequalities. This study assessed the acceptability, feasibility, and \npreliminary efficacy of a new compassion -based cognitive behavioural intervention for self -esteem tailored to sexual \nminority young adults.  \nMethod: Participants were a community s ample of 24 sexual minority young adults aged 16 -24 experiencing clinically \nsignificant low self -esteem. An uncontrolled pre/post design was used with qualitative feedback and quantitative \noutcomes. Self -report standardised measures were completed at basel ine, pre -intervention, intervention mid -point, post -\nintervention and two -month follow up. Preliminary investigation of efficacy was examined through post -intervention \nchanges in self -esteem, functioning, anxiety, and depression. Potential mechanisms of cha nge were examined through \nchanges in self -compassion, self -criticism, and unhelpful coping responses to minority stress.  \nResults: Results showed good acceptability and feasibility; 95% of participants said they found the intervention useful and \nwould recom mend it to those experiencing similar difficulties.  There was preliminary evidence of intervention efficacy for \nimproving self -esteem, functioning, depression, and anxiety. Notably, 85% of the young adults showed a reliable change in \nself-esteem to above the clinical cut -off at follow -up. There was also evidence for improvement in self -compassion, and \nreduction in self -criticism.  \nConclusion: This new intervention showed good acceptability and feasibility in a community sample. Randomised \ncontrolled studie s are needed to further examine efficacy of the intervention and suitability for use in different settings \n(e.g., primary care mental health or university counselling services). Self -compassion and reduced self -criticism could be \ninvestigated in future stu dies as treatment mediators.  \n \nEnhancing the acceptability of an online cognitive behavioural therapy intervention for LGBTIQ+ youth: The \ncase study of SPARX  \nMathijs  Lucassen , The Open University, UK & University of Auckland, New Zealand ; Karolina  Stasiak , University \nof Auckland, New Zealand ; Theresa  Fleming , Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand ; Matthew  \nShepherd , Massey University, New Zealand ; Sally  Merry , University of Auckland, New Zealand   \nIntroduction: Many young people will experience depression and anxiety, but access to evidence -based psychological \ntherapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT),  is limited. Common barriers to therapy access include a range of \nfactors, such as the stigma associated with mental ill -health and a lack of qualified therapists for those who do attempt to \nseek formal support. Computerised or online CBT in self -help form at provides an opportunity to deliver treatment to many \nyoung people, especially for those under -served by services at present, at a time and place of their choosing. We \ndeveloped a gamified CBT intervention called SPARX (Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic , X-factors thoughts) for adolescents \nwith depressive symptoms which has been made freely available to young people in New Zealand since 2014. Its initial \ndevelopment involved co -design work and consultation sessions including with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/trans, \nintersex and questioning (LGBTIQ+) young people. Over 10,000 adolescents have used SPARX since its launch in New \nZealand, including 207 trans and 50 intersex users. LGBTIQ+ young people have previously indicated that SPARX should be \nenha nced, especially in relation to the intervention's 'look and feel' for LGBTIQ+ youth.  \nMethod: Three online focus groups and follow -up email consultations involved 12 LGBTIQ+ young people (16 to 25 years \nold) in New Zealand. Participants were recruited fro m two LGBTIQ+ youth organisations. We conducted a thematic analysis \nof the qualitative data generated.  \nResults: Most participants had used SPARX prior to their involvement in this study. Participants described a number of \nchallenges associated with online  environments. LGBTIQ+ youth suggested non -binary options for gender diverse users be \ndeveloped for SPARX. They also further highlighted that representation and choice are important factors in terms of \nmaking SPARX more acceptable to LGBTIQ+ youth in New Z ealand (and elsewhere).  \nDiscussion: SPARX has now been modified based on participants’ feedback. Our intention is to evaluate the refined \niteration of SPARX (i.e., SPARX Version 2.0) and explore its use with LGBTIQ+ young people outside of New Zealand.  \nReferences:  \nLucassen, M.F.G., Perry, Y., Frampton, C., Fleming, T., Shepherd, M., Merry, S. & Stasiak, K.

Whilst psychological interventions are \nindicated during episodes of acute mental distress, those on offer generally tend to be more psychoeducational and/ or \nskills based in nature. Conventional methods of group CBT that rely on diagnostic specificity with set numbers of sessions \nare not particularly well suited to the acute ward with varying presentations and unpredictable length of stays. Evaluation \nfrom i npatient CBT psychoeducation groups has suggested limited effectiveness outside of the group setting with patients \nreporting an inability to generalise skills due to the acuity of their difficulties. A common complaint remains amongst those  \nadmitted that t here is a lack of psychological provision at a time of crisis when people most need to reflect and make sense \nof their experiences. Method: Open group therapy approaches provide a more flexible framework whereby members \nregardless of diagnosis are free to join and leave as they wish. Attendees define the therapeutic target at the start of each \nsession, meaning there is no pre -set goal or psychoeducational structure. The group format follows a standard CBT session \nstructure with a group agenda set and Socrat ic questioning techniques utilised to inform a basic group formulation. \nPsychoeducation and change techniques are introduced in response to a shared understanding of the defined target. \nResults: Those who have attended Open group CBT to date have reported feeling validated and understood and found it \nhelpful to share and reflect on their experiences. Common psychological themes occurred throughout group discussion \nthat otherwise would have been incorporated into a psychoeducational session. Discussion: Inpa tient units often utilise \npsychoeducation -based programs, however this presents significant challenges associated with the acuity and \nunpredictability of the acute environment. Open group approaches provide a transdiagnostic framework which focuses on \ncomm on processes shared across disorders.  This open group format is rarely reported on in the literature and remains \nempirically untested. However preliminary evaluation of using open group therapy techniques within inpatient services has \nfound it be feasible , acceptable and reflective of clinical need.  \nReferences:  \nBoynton, V & Sanderson, C (2021) Open group cognitive therapy on acute in -patient units.

Developed over a 7 -year period at a university counseling center i n the USA, it is designed to \nreduce interpersonal distress in eight sessions or less.  FBGT incorporates measurement based care to personalize \ntreatment, enhancing pre -group preparation, process and outcomes.  \nEffectiveness research has shown statistically  significant reductions in depression, social anxiety, hostility and interpersonal \ndistress. Research has also shown lower premature dropout rates for the approach - a central goal of the therapy.  \nThis presentation will outline the structure and core prin ciples of the approach, with particular attention paid to how the \ninterpersonal circumplex is used to improve the working alliance and to generate successful outcomes.   \nFBGT is currently being used widely across the USA, China and Singapore in university counseling centers and outpatient \nsettings.  \nReferences:  \nWhittingham, M.

The content of the group programme in particular will be explained. It starts from \nsimple tools to manage arousal, such as mindfulness, behavioural activation and breathing and progresses to emotion and \nrelationship management, self -compassion, positive use of anger. It then progresses to the intra psychic (different \npotentials of the self) relationship and rebuilding a new relationship with the traumatic past, without reliving.  \nResults : Preliminary e valuation shows improved recovery for those who failed to progress with prior CBT.

Though based on the skills teaching model first \nintroduced by Dialectical Beha viour Therapy (DBT), group therapeutic factors play an important role in the success of the \nprogramme. It requires much of participants but despite not requiring (or encouraging) deep sharing about the past, which \nis covered in the individual formulation s essions, it has been shown to forge strong bonds within the group which greatly \nassist the therapeutic process.  \nReferences:  \nClarke, I. & Nicholls, H.

Prior research finds associations between \nmental imagery and chronic pain, particularly with common co -morbidities such as anxiety, depression, and health anxiety. \nHowever, prevalence estimates vary with small sample sizes. A better understanding of imagery and pain could help \nimprove cognitive -behavioural therapies. This study a imed to describe the prevalence of mental imagery in a chronic pain \nsample and examine the extent to which imagery - and negative interpretations of it - explained variation in pain intensity \nand disability when controlling for common co -morbidities. Parti cipants with chronic pain (n = 151) completed measures of \nanxiety, depression, health anxiety, general imagery use, and pain -related mental imagery. Anxiety, depression and health \nanxiety significantly explained 14.8% of the variance in pain intensity (p & lt; .001) and 15.2% in pain disability (p &lt; .001). \nGeneral imagery use and pain -related imagery did not significantly explain any additional variance.

This study explored the prevalence of HA in ambulatory present ations in a \ntertiary emergency department (ED) as well as factors associated with pain and HA.  \nMethod: A cross -sectional questionnaire design gathered data from adult ED ambulatory attendees across a four -day \nperiod to assess psychological and physical hea lth variables. Number of ED attendances over the previous 12 months was \naccessed through health records.  \nResults: Of the final sample (n = 106), 77% were white British, 54% were male, and 14% presented with severe HA as \nmeasured by the Short Health Anxiet y Inventory (≥ 18). Participants with pre -existing health conditions had significantly \nhigher levels of HA (M = 12.36, SE = 1.59) compared to those without (M = 7.79, SE = 0.66). Stepwise multiple regression \nanalyses identified anxiety sensitivity and pain  catastrophizing as significant independent predictors of HA, explaining 51% \nof the variance in HA. Pain catastrophizing was also a significant independent predictor of pain, accounting for 20% of the \nvariance.  \nDiscussion: This study provides insight into  HA prevalence in ED ambulatory presentations and key psychological predictors \nof HA and pain. This has implications for treatment in an ED setting whereby patients may benefit from referral to medical \npsychology or mental health services.   \n \nThe Role of Cognitive -Affective Factors in Symptom Severity and Quality of Life in Raynaud’s Phenomenon  \nDulcie  Irving , University of Bath, UK ; Jo Daniels , University of Bath, UK  \nDespite anxiety/stress being a key trigger for Raynaud’s phenomenon episodes, related research is still in its infancy and no \ncurrent interventions address first -line management lifestyle recommendations. We examined the role of cognitive -\naffective factors in symptom severity and quality of life (QoL) and differences between Raynaud’s types \n(primary/secondary) to i nform intervention development; cognitive behavioural therapy is a potentially suitable treatment \noption, given NICE recommendations for use with anxiety and robust evidence base in other medical conditions. A cross -\nsectional design was used. Adults with R aynaud’s (N=210) completed an online questionnaire measuring stress, anxiety, \ndepression, anxiety sensitivity (AS), beliefs about emotions, symptom severity and QoL. Raynaud’s groups \n(primary/secondary) differed in anxiety, symptom severity and QoL (ps&lt; .004). Stepwise regressions indicated anxiety \nand Raynaud’s type explained 23% variance in hand symptom severity; anxiety, Raynaud’s type and AS explained 29% \nvariance in symptom severity (global impact); depression, Raynaud’s type and AS explained 32% var iance in QoL \n(ps&lt;.001). These findings suggest that anxiety, AS and depression may be useful intervention targets. They provide a firm \nbasis for the applicability of CBT in Raynaud's; it is imperative that we tailor interventions to the unique character istics of \neach presenting problem. We present initial findings that may underpin an adaption of CBT for Raynaud’s.   \n \nNew developments in OCD  \nConvenor: Sandra Krause, Concordia University, Canada  \nChair: Adam Radomsky, Concordia University, Canada  \nDiscussant: Roz Shafran, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UK  \n \nChildhood experiences associated with heightened responsibility for self vs others in obsessive -compulsive \ndisorder  \nLucas  Shelemy , University of Oxford , UK; Paul  Salkovskis , University of Oxford , UK  \nThis research seeks to un derstand how different childhood experiences are related to the sense of responsibility for \noneself and for others.

      "text": "66 \n \n \n Is that really who I am? An experimental investigation of perceptions of violation of the self and mental \ncontamination  \nSandra  Krause , Concordia University , Canada ; Adam  Radomsky , Concordia University , Canada   \nMental contamination refers to contamination concerns that arise in the a bsence of direct contact with a contaminant, and \nis a common symptom in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Cognitive models of mental contamination highlight the \ncentral role of perceptions of violation in the onset and maintenance of these feelings. Tha t said, little research has been \ndone to operationally define the construct of violation and systematically examine its different components. Maladaptive \nappraisals of the self have been identified as maintaining factors in cognitive models of OCD. Thus, p erceptions of violation \nof one’s self -concept may represent an aspect of violation appraisal relevant to the experience of mental contamination.  \nThe present study experimentally examined the impact of violations of individuals’ sense of self on subsequent  feelings of \nmental contamination. For the study, 150 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions after \nreceiving false feedback that they scored in the top 5th percentile on a morality subscale of a bogus personality measure. \nThose who were asked to write about their own past immoral behaviour reported significantly higher levels of mental \ncontamination than those who were asked to write about their own past moral behaviour, or a non -self-referent negative \nevent. That said, the re were no differences between conditions with regard to reported urges to wash. The findings \nsuggest that perceptions of violation of the self may be a particularly relevant violation appraisal in the context of mental  \ncontamination. Further, these percep tions may therefore prove to be effective treatment targets for those experiencing \nsymptoms of mental contamination.  \n \nResponses to autobiographical imagery involving being perpetrator or victim of betrayal in OCD and control \nparticipants  \nPaul  Salkovskis , University of Oxford , UK; Sam  French , University of Oxford , UK  \nMenta l Contamination (MC) in those suffering from OCD has been linked to the experience of betrayal. More recently it \nhas been suggested that this may be due to sensitivity to ideas of being responsible for betraying others. In this study \nparticipants with OCD and community controls were randomised to eliciting historical images where they had either been \nbetrayed by someone they trusted, or had betrayed a person who trusted them. The primary variable was the state mental \ncontamination measure. Both imagery cond itions elicited similar levels of mental contamination. OCD participants had a \ngreater increase in state contamination that controls regardless of experimental condition. Results suggest that those with \nOCD experience increases in mental contamination when  recalling betrayal events in imagery at the same level when they \nare the perpetrator or victim.  Implications for the treatment of MC are considered  \n \nAppraisals of intrusions: The role of threat and intolerance of uncertainty across OCD -like, Worry -like and \nPsychosis -like personally salient intrusive experiences  \nMark  Freeston , Newcastle University, U K; Lauren  Mawn , Newcastle -upon -Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust \nand Newcastle University , UK; Anna  Luce , Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust , UK; \nNicola  Barclay , Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust , UK; Guy Dodgson , Cumbria, \nNorthumberland, Tyne & W ear NHS Foundation Trust , UK \nBackground: While there is now consistent evidence that dispositional intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a transdiagnostic \nrisk factor, the role of situational IU versus threat appraisal s in situational distress remains largely unknown.  This study \nused a semi -idiographic design where participants appraise their most salient target intrusive experience in terms of both \nthreat and situational IU.  \nMethods:  A community sample (N = 595) was  recruited from a variety of sources.  From lists of frequently rated scenarios, \nparticipants chose their most worry -like, OCD -like, and psychosis -like (i.e., unusual) intrusive experiences and appraised \neach on both threat (likelihood, severity and immine nce) and IU (uncertainty and bothered by the uncertainty). \nParticipants were assigned to a group based on cut -offs/algorithmic decisions from screening measures.  An additional \ngroup was recruited from Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) service.  The sa lience of the target scenario salience was high \nand balanced across groups, apart from the EIP group who scored significantly higher. An ANOVA/ANCOVA design was \nused where the severity of the target experience (sum of Frequency, Duration, Distress, Interfe rence) was the DV, Group \nwas the IV, and situational threat and IU were the covariates/mediators.   \nResults: There was a significant effect of group. Both covariates made significant contributions showing that differences in \nseverity were partially account ed for/mediated by both threat and IU.  Further, the Group X Covariate interactions were \nsignificant for both threat and IU, indicating that the relationship between threat and IU with severity varied by group.  \nHowever, effect sizes for the Covariate/Medi ator X Group interactions were small -medium, while those for the \ncovariate/mediator in the model were medium -large."

Small sample sizes and questionab le research practices such as p -hacking, \nhypothesising after the results are known, and selectively publishing positive results have all been implicated as \ncontributing factors.  In response there is a move toward rigorous and transparent scientific practic es, such as pre -\nregistering study protocols or publishing using Registered Reports, making materials and data open access, publishing pre -\nprints, designing studies with sufficient statistical power, and team science approaches to pool resources and experti se.  \nHere I discuss the pros and cons of adopting these open research practices, for the individual researcher and the \nadvancement of clinical research, drawing on lessons learnt from the COVID pandemic.  \n \nResearch skills; What should be  on the curriculum for trainee clinicians?  \nPamela  Jacobsen , University of Bath , UK  \nTraining people to be evidence -based practitioners requires the inclusion of research skills on the curriculum, in \nrecognition of the fact that they will be consumers, if not also, producers of research over the course of their career.  \nResearch skills training should therefore cover both these training needs; in being able to unde rstand, interpret, and apply \nresearch findings, as well as being able to design, conduct, analyse, and disseminate original research.  This talk will use UK-\nbased Clinical Psychology (DClinPsy) training as an example of how research skills can be successfu lly incorporated into the \ncurriculum, whilst acknowledging transferable factors to the training of other kinds of clinical practitioners, both in the U K \nand internationally.  \nThis talk will use the framework of Constructive Alignment to outline an effective  curriculum in which learning activities \nand assessments are aligned to the desired learning outcomes.  It is important that research skills training, like clinical s kills \ntraining, is continually updated to keep up with advances in the field.  Key topics which are increasingly being given greater \nprominence on research curricula include Equality & Diversity, involvement of people with Lived Experience, and Open \nScience.  Practical examples will be given of how these topics have been incorporated into the r esearch curriculum at one \nDClinPsy training programme in the UK (University of Bath).  \n \nAccessing support and advice to build clinical research: the NIHR Mental Health Research Incubator  \nCathy  Creswell , University of Oxford , UK  \nWe very much hope that this symposium will get people excited about developing or building clinical research going \nforwards - however people may feel a bit stu ck about how to best move things forwards.

A critical rate limiting step can be generating sufficient early ‘proof of concept’ data to \ndetermine if a treatment is worth developing and evaluating further. There remains a lack of clarity in the field about how \nbest to establish this early ‘proof of concept’ data. This talk will review various potential methods to establish proof of \nconcept for novel therapies, including use of intensive time series case series designs, bench marking pre -post effect sizes \nfrom rou tine practice to the existing trials literature, and examination of the confidence intervals of exploratory between -\ngroup analyses in pilot trials to judge the probability a novel treatment might be inferior, equivalent to, or superior to \nexisting treatmen ts. \n \nMaking the leap: from experimental psychopathology to clinical trials  \nSimon  Blackwell , Ruhr -Universität Bochum, Bochum, Germany ; Marcella  Woud , Ruhr -Universität Bochum, \nBochum, Germany   \nA substantial amount of experimental psychopathology research is carried out with the aim of developing new \npsycho logical treatments informed by basic science. However, moving from experimental studies to the clinical trials \nrequired to test effectiveness of new interventions often poses many problems. These problems include not only those \ncommon to any form of treatm ent development research, but further difficulties that relate to differences in the \ndevelopmental route often taken by treatments arising from experimental psychopathology research and those originating \nfrom direct clinical experience. This talk explores some of the complexities of the translational process in trying to develop, \nor inform development of, novel interventions using an experimental psychopathology approach. It further considers some \nof the ins and outs of clinical trials methodology, from pla nning through to reporting, with a particular focus on those \naspects that often seem to trip up experimental psychopathology researchers. The overall aim is to provide some guidance \nthat may help improve the quality of this translational research and incre ase the chance of successful clinical translation \nand novel treatment development from basic science.  \nReferences:  \nBlackwell, S.

The present review therefore summarises the evidence base, dividing delusion \nfeatures into the domains of structure, content and meta -cognitive beliefs; and domains of clinical significance into course, \ncause, co -morbidity, consequence and CBT -response . Method: We searched PsycINFO/MEDLINE and conducted a manual \nsearch to identify quantitative papers examining the association between delusion psychological features and clinically \nimportant variables in early course psychosis patients. Results: Twenty -seven studies were included, with 35 types of \nclinical significance identified. Five structural features of delusions predicted worse course (long term psychiatric \nmorbidity) and one other structural feature predicted favourable response to group CBT. Severa l content features of \ndelusions predicted co -morbidity (anxiety, depression, substance abuse), consequences (suicide, violence, distress) and \ncause/prior childhood/adult traumas. Several meta -cognitive beliefs about delusion content predicted PTSD and dist ress. \nDiscussion: This review offers clinicians a pilot psychological template for influencing evidence -based clinical decisions \nabout patients who present with early course delusions."

These delusions are believed to be sustained by biased cognitive and emotional processes. \nCognitive Bias Modifi cation for paranoia (CBM -pa) is an intervention targeting the biased interpretation of emotional \nambiguity associated with paranoia. This study aims to build on the methodology to test the efficacy of a mobile app \nversion (STOP) of CBM -pa.  \nMethod: The STO P study is a double -blind, randomised controlled trial (RCT) for 273 stabilised outpatients with persistent, \ndistressing paranoid symptoms. Patients will be randomised to either STOP (6 or 12 weeks) or text -reading control (12 \nweeks), receiving a weekly 40 -min session. STOP involves reading text inviting paranoid interpretations, but then \ngenerating responses reflecting an alternative, non -paranoid interpretation. Treatment as Usual will continue for all \npatients. Patients will be assessed at baseline, foll owing sessions, and at 6 -, 12-, 18- and 24 -weeks post -randomisation. The \nprimary outcome is the severity of paranoid symptoms at 24 -weeks. The secondary outcomes are clinical symptoms and \nmeasurement of interpretation bias at baseline and follow -ups.  \nDiscussion: This study will assess whether STOP is effective and has the potential to be a low -cost and accessible \nintervention to complement other psychological treatments for paranoia.  \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN177546   \n \nTalking abou t suicide and psychosis: Key issues in therapy delivery and acceptability  \nKamelia  Harris , University of Manchester , UK; Gillian  Haddock , University of Manchester , UK; Patricia  Gooding , \nUniversity of Ma nchester , UK; Sarah  Peters , University of Manchester , UK; Yvonne  Awenat , Unive rsity of \nManchester , UK; Daniel  Pratt , University of Manchester , UK \nPeople with psychosis are at increased risk of suicide death. Talking thera pies can alleviate suicidal experiences. Therapies \nneed to be effective and acceptable to recipients. The CARMS project investigates the efficacy and mechanisms of a talking \ntherapy (CBSPp) for people experiencing suicidality and psychosis. The aim of this  study was to assess CBSPp’s acceptability \nusing data from attendance and engagement, and analyses of interviews using Theoretical Framework of Acceptability \n(TFA). CARMS was a two -armed randomised controlled trial comparing CBSPp plus Treatment As Usual ( TAU) with TAU \nalone. Participants were recruited from NHS services in North -West England and were over 18 years, had non -affective \npsychosis, and experienced recent suicidal thoughts, plans, and/or attempts. To assess acceptability of CBSPp, data on \nattend ance were collated and semi -structured interviews were conducted. Data were deductively analysed using the TFA. \n149 people received CBSPp plus TAU. A median of 16 sessions were attended. 20 participants took part in the qualitative \nstudy. Seven themes were  identified: Affective attitude, Burden, Ethicality, Intervention coherence, Opportunities, \nPerceived effectiveness, Self -efficacy. There was no evidence of loss of opportunities as a result of receiving CBSPp. CBSPp \nwas perceived as being acceptable. Talk ing about suicide was difficult but important for understanding experiences. \nOffering flexible modes of delivery is paramount to acceptability.   \n \nCognitive behaviour therapy for depersonalization derealization disorder: A self-controlled cross -over study \nof wait list versus active treatment  \nRafael  Gafoor , University College London, UK ; Elaine  Hunter , Univ ersity College London, UK ; Malcolm  Wong , \nUniversity College London, UK ; Glyn  Lewis , University College London, UK ; Anthony  David , University College \nLondon, UK  \nIntroduction: Depersonalisation -Derealisation Disorder (DDD) has a prevalence of around 1%. We report on a clinical audit \nof 36 par ticipants who were sequentially recruited from a specialist CBT clinic in London with a diagnosis of chronic DDD \n(mean duration of 14 years) and who attended at least 8 sessions.  \nMethods: Three outcomes were assessed (Cambridge Depersonalisation Scale [CD S], Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] and \nthe Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI]) at three time points in a naturalistic, self -controlled, cross -over design. Hierarchical \nlongitudinal analyses for outcome response clustered by patient were performed using scores f rom baseline, beginning of \ntherapy and end of therapy.  \nResults: Participants did not show a statistically significant change in any of the outcome measures between baseline and \nstart of treatment, however there were statistically significant reductions du ring the treatment period. The reduction in \nCDS scores in the waiting period was -4.32 (95%CI: -20.023 to 11.39) and after the treatment period was -36.35 (95%CI: -\n52.33 to -20.28). The reduction in BDI scores was -4.64 (95% CI: -9.40 to 0.13) in the waiti ng period and -12.86 (95% CI: -\n17.70 to -8.02) after the treatment period. BAI scores showed a reduction of -3.02 (95% CI: -7.01 to 0.97) during the \nwaiting period and -6.76 (95% CI: -10.82 to -2.69) after the treatment period.  \nConclusions: CBT may be an effective treatment for DDD."

Appearance concerns are one example for a distorted body representation. Components of body \nrepresentations (especially body image and body schema) have been defined and operationalized in a heterogenous way in \nclinical psychology and related fields. This has made it difficult to integrate findings on the role of body representations for \nthe development, maintenance, and treatment of different disorders. As part of a systematic review (PROSPERO \nregistration: CRD420202 20303), we developed a conceptual framework and used it to integrate previous research on body \nrepresentations across different disorders (BDD, muscle dysmorphia - MD, body integrity dysphoria - BID). In the current \ntalk, this framework and the results of studies on body representation in BDD will be presented.  \nMethod: We screened 2552 publications on body representations in BDD, MD and BID, out of which 212 studies with \napprox. 35.000 participants were included for further analyses.  \nResults: BDD was the f ocus in 145 studies (68%), and approx. 50% of these studies were based on clinical populations. Non -\nexperimental, correlational (vs. experimental) study designs were used in 55% of the BDD studies.  \nDiscussion: The results on the research activity in the f ield of body representation and BDD as well as further results on \nBDD specific distortions in body representations will be discussed with regard to their implications for future research and \ntreatment approaches.  \n \nExploring the relations hip between social media use and body dysmorphic symptoms in young people  \nMonica  Gupta , King's College London , UK; Amita  Jassi , South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust , UK; \nGeorgina  Krebs , University College London , UK  \nBackground: Social media us e (SMU) is now rife amongst young people and has been associated with negative mental \nhealth outcomes, including depression and poor body image. The relationship between social media and body dysmorphic \ndisorder is yet to be explored.  Method: 209 16 -18 ye ar olds from London completed an online survey measuring body \ndysmorphic symptoms, frequency of SMU, type of SMU (active or passive), motivations for SMU (appearance -based, \npopularity, connection or values and interests), perfectionism, and anxiety and dep ression symptoms. Results: higher \nfrequency of SMU was significantly associated with higher BDD symptoms but only with image -based and mixed -media \nsocial media platforms. Appearance -based motivation for SMU was the only motivation uniquely associated with BDD \nsymptoms. Active SMU was significantly associated with increased BDD symptoms only when controlling for age, gender, \nethnicity and anxiety and depression symptoms. Passive SMU was only significantly associated with BDD symptoms when \nno other variables were controlled for. Neither self -oriented, nor socially -prescribed perfectionism moderated the \nrelationship between type of SMU and BDD. Exploratory analysis did not find a longitudinal association between frequency \nof SMU and BDD. Conclusions: Image -related SMU is associated with increased BDD symptoms. The direction of effect \nremains unknown. Implications for future research are discussed.  \nReferences:  \nKelly, Y., Zilanawala, A., Booker, C., & Sacker, A. (2018).

Yet, little data is available on ACE among children and \nadolescents and whether these early experiences are more c ommon in pediatric BDD than in related disorders, such as \nobsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD). Little is also known about the clinical profile of youth with BDD with vs without a \nhistory of ACE, though there is some evidence to suggest that childhood traum a may be associated with more severe and \ncomplex presentations among adult BDD sufferers. The aim of this study is to examine the type and rates of ACE in a \npediatric BDD sample compared to OCD, as well as the clinical correlates of young people with BDD w ith a history of ACE.   \n Participants will include youths (aged 12 to 17 years) with a primary diagnosis of BDD (n=50) and OCD (n=50) who were \nconsecutively referred to the National and Specialist OCD, BDD & Related Disorders Clinic at the Maudsley Hospita l in \nLondon. Data on child - and parent -reported ACE,  socio -demographic (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity) and clinical \ncharacteristics (e.g. symptom severity) will be systematically extracted from electronic clinical records.  \nThe preliminary results of this s tudy will be presented and discussed in terms of clinical implications and future research.   \n \nInternet -delivered cognitive -behaviour therapy for adolescents with body dysmorphic disorder: a feasibility \ntrial  \nDaniel  Rautio , Karolinska Institutet , Sweden ; Lorena  Fernández de la Cruz , Karolinska Institutet m, Sweden ; \nDavid  Mataix -Cols, Karolinska Institutet , Sweden ; Per Andrén , Karolinska Institutet , Sweden ; Maral  Jolstedt , \nKarolinska Institutet , Sweden ; Maria  Silverberg -Mörse , Region Stockholm , Sweden ; Tobias  Lundgren , Karolinska \nInstitutet , Sweden  \nBody dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a prevalent and impairing condition that can be effectively treated with cognitive -\nbehaviour therapy (CBT). How ever, CBT for BDD is a highly specialised treatment and most adolescents do not have access \nto it. Internet -delivered CBT (ICBT) can be a way to increase the availability of effective psychological treatments. No study \nto date has evaluated the feasibility  of ICBT for adolescent BDD, but the experience in adults with BDD treated with ICBT is \nencouraging. The primary aim of this open trial is to measure feasibility and safety of the intervention. The secondary aim \nis to measure its preliminary efficacy.   \nA total of 20 participants aged 12 -17 years and meeting DSM -5 criteria for a diagnosis of BDD will be recruited nationally. \nTreatment will be delivered from the OCD and Related Disorders Clinic for Children and Adolescents at the Stockholm \nregion (Sweden). P articipants will be offered 12 modules of therapist guided ICBT for BDD over a period of 14 weeks. This \ntreatment is based on a previously evaluated face -to-face CBT protocol which mainly includes psychoeducation, exposure \nwith response prevention, and rel apse prevention strategies. Feasibility will be measured based on rates of participant \nretention, treatment completion and adherence to treatment content, treatment acceptability, treatment credibility, \ntreatment satisfaction, and adverse events during the  treatment at post -treatment. Preliminary efficacy will be measured \nby using the Yale -Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, modified for BDD, adolescent version (BDD -YBOCS -A) and the rate of \ntreatment responders at post -treatment and at the 3 -month follow -up. Secondary outcome measures will include self -\nreported BDD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and functional impairment.   \nIn this talk, the feasibility and preliminary efficacy results of the pilot study will be presented up to the 3 -month follow -up. \nFuture pl ans to perform a fully powered randomized controlled trial of the ICBT intervention for adolescent BDD will be \ndescribed.  \n \nPhenomenology and treatment outcomes in pediatric Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) and Autism \nSpectrum Disorder (ASD).  \nAmita  Jassi , South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, UK ; Daniel  Rautio , Karolinska Institutet, Sweden ; \nBenedetta  Monzani , South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, UK ; Loren a Fernandez De La Cruz , Karolinska \nInstitutet, Sweden ; David  Mataix -Cols, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden ; Georgina  Krebs , University College \nLondon, UK   \nTreatment for pediatric Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is starting to gain focus in research. Outcomes  for Cognitive \nBehavior Therapy (CBT) have previously been found to be modest (Mataix -Cols et al., 2015) and are improving as CBT \npackages develop (Rautio et al., 2022).  As with OCD, enhanced packages of treatment may be warranted for those with \ncomorbid Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) given the high rates of comorbidity and potential compromised outcomes to \nstandard packages of CBT. In order to understand the need for augmented packages of CBT, comparing the \nphenomenology and treatment outcomes between t hose with and without ASD is a helpful endeavor.

The Sussex Voices Clinic (SVC) was developed to bridge this gap! After conducting a \ntrial of Person Based Cognitive Therapy groups for distressing voices in the context of psychosis (the ‘M4V’ trial), we \ncreated SVC as a clinical service to offer these groups to patients within the NHS.  \nMethod : Data were collected from 95 patients with varying dia gnoses who attended one of thirteen PBCT groups offered \nby SVC within routine clinical practice. Analyses were conducted to explore levels of engagement and clinical outcomes, \ntogether with associated predictors. Findings were compared with those generated  from the M4V trial.  \nResults : Fifty -nine per cent of patients completed group PBCT within SVC, compared with 72% within M4V. There were \nsignificant improvements in voice -related distress (Cohen’s d = –0.47; p = 0.001), subjective recovery (Cohen’s d = 0.35 ; p = \n0.001) and depression (Cohen’s d = –0.20; p = 0.044); these outcomes were comparable to M4V. Higher baseline subjective \nrecovery and lower depression both predicted improvement in voice -related distress. Therapy within SVC cost an average \nof £214 per  patient.  \nDiscussion : This study demonstrates that PBCT groups can be delivered trans -diagnostically in routine clinical practice to \npatients distressed by hearing voices, with the amount of benefit comparable to that generated in a research environment. \nIn order to optimize the use of resources, attention should be paid to baseline levels of depression and subjective recovery, \nas they have the potential to influence engagement and outcomes,  \nrespectively. The costs for PBCT groups are relatively low and so this therapy offers a potentially cost -effective intervention \nfor a group of patients who may otherwise make extensive use of high -cost clinical services.  \nReferences:  \nJones, A., Strauss, C., & Hayward, M.

However, research is yet to evaluate the clinical benefit of delivering MBI groups online.  We examine \nengag ement, clinical outcomes, participant experience and therapeutic process of delivering therapy groups online in \nroutine clinical practice.  \nMethods : The study used an uncontrolled pre -post design to examine engagement, therapeutic benefits (depression, \nanxiety, beliefs about voices) and group process in a 12 -session online mindfulness group for individuals with a \nschizophrenia spectrum diagnosis with current distressing voices.  Qualitative data on participant experience of online \ngroup therapy were analysed  using Thematic Analysis.  \nResults : 17/21 participants completed one of three consecutively run therapy groups.  The majority of the sample (88%) \nattended between nine and 12 therapy sessions.  For completers there were significant reductions pre -post in d epression, \nanxiety, beliefs about voices and voice -related negative affect, with medium to large effect sizes.  Qualitative analysis of \nparticipant feedback identified three themes: ‘experience of online delivery’, ‘therapeutic benefits’ and ‘feeling conne cted \nto people in the group’.   \nDiscussion : Findings in relation to engagement, clinical benefits, participant experience and group process offer \nencouragement that online delivery of mindfulness for psychosis groups may be a useful addition to mental heal th services \nfor people with distressing voices.

This study explored participants’ experiences of ACT groups promoting recovery from psychosis offered in \nAustralian public mental health services (Recovery A CT: based on the manual by O’Donoghue et al., 2018), including helpful \nand unhelpful aspects and reflections related to personal recovery. Recovery ACT engages 6 -12 service users with \npsychosis in seven weekly group sessions, plus a booster session one mo nth later. The intervention aims to increase \npsychological flexibility through brief mindfulness exercises, experiential exercises, key metaphors and values work (Johns \net al., 2016; Jolley et al., 2020).  \nMethod : Participants were engaged in an interview a bout their experiences of Recovery ACT groups. A qualitative research \nmethodology, thematic analysis, was used to explore themes across nine participants who attended groups in community \nmental health settings. These interviews were conducted as part of an  evaluation of Recovery ACT across mental health \nservices in Melbourne, Australia.  \nResults : Analysis of semi -structured interview transcripts identified four themes: interpersonal vulnerability, living beyond \nthe illness, personal growth and recovering fr om psychosis. Participants shared that Recovery ACT could be interpersonally \ntaxing, in drawing upon their own experiences along with the challenges of observing others’ discomfort. This could be \nparticularly the case when engaged in experiential exercises  such as the “Passengers on the Bus”. All participants described \nthe intervention as beneficial, particularly valuing the person -centred, inclusive nature of the group that contrasted to \nsome individual’s past experiences of coercion, alienation, and stigm atisation.  \nDiscussion : Participants’ accounts appeared consistent with the ACT model and further understanding of consumers’ \nexperience of group ACT for psychosis. Participants described aspects related to common factors of groups (connection, \ncommon huma nity), and that participating in Recovery ACT was socially demanding, associated with transformative \nexperiences, and a sense of safety and respect.

A logistic re gression distinguished Reddit users with a self -\nreported BD diagnosis who did (n=10,662) vs. did not (n=3,790) post in MH subreddits. Predictors were anxiety, sadness, \nanger, and 1st person singular pronoun use, measured from all of users’ non -MH subreddit  posts via the LIWC text analysis \ntool, controlling for age, gender, active days, mean #posts/day.

Jagfeld et al. (2021) defined the \nfirst fram ework for PR in BD, POETIC (Purpose & meaning, Optimism & hope, Empowerment, Tensions, Identity, \nConnectedness), based on CHIME (Leamy et al., 2011). So far, PR has only been studied in researcher -constructed \nenvironments (interviews, focus groups). Suppor t forum posts can serve as complementary non -reactive data source.  \nBy integrating corpus and computational linguistics and health research methods, this study analysed public BD support \nforum posts in relation to the lived experience of PR. Comparing 4.4K PR-relevant posts by 2K users to 25K non -PR-relevant \nposts resulted in 130 significantly overused keywords. Keywords were coded according to the POETIC framework.  \nThree domains featured most in PR -related discussions: Purpose & meaning (particularly parent ing, work), Connectedness \n(particularly romantic relationships, social support), Purpose & meaning (parenting, work), Empowerment (self -\nmanagement, personal responsibility).  This study is the first to analyse non -reactive data on PR in BD. Indicating the k ey \nareas that people focus on in PR when posting freely and the language they use, provides helpful starting points for \ntherapists to collaboratively consider these issues with service users in clinical settings, such as recovery -oriented CBT.  \n \nUsing the Person -Based Approach to optimise an app -based behavioural activation intervention for adults \nwith depression.  \nJeffrey  Lambert , University of Bath, UK ; Jeffrey  Lambert , University of Bath, UK ; Zoe Anchors , University of \nBath, UK ; Paul  Stallard , University of Bath, UK ; Alice  Pitt, Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS \nTrust, UK ; Colin  Greaves , University of Birmingham, UK"

      "text": "75 \n \n \n Introduction: App -based Behavioural Activation ( BA) may be effective at reducing depression in adults. However, lack of \nacceptability and engagement may reduce its effects. We used the person -based approach (PBA) to collect feedback from \nadults with depression to improve the acceptability and engagement  of an app -based BA intervention.  \nMethod: We recruited 16 adults with elevated depressive symptoms from the community. In study 1, nine participants \ntook part in a think -aloud interview, providing feedback on the app. We tabulated findings and modified the  app using \ncriteria for prioritising changes. In study 2, we interviewed seven participants about their experiences of using the modifie d \napp for two weeks. We also held two patient and public involvement meetings.  \nResults: In study 1, participants identif ied two ‘must have’ changes, which we addressed. Specifically, participants were \nhaving problems planning and breaking down activities. In study 2, participants identified the following barriers: lacking \nvisual engagement, tone and framing of the difficult y rating. Positives from both studies included: interface usability, \nhaving a clear rationale, examples of activities and progress and self -reflection features.  \nDiscussion: The PBA provided in -depth insight allowing us to make key modifications concerning  the acceptability and \nengagement of the app. We now plan to conduct a feasibility study to explore feasibility, acceptability, recruitment, \nretention and fidelity.   \n \nTaming emotions with DBT -Skills – what really works for people with B ipolar -Disorder?  \nJulieta  Azevedo , University of Coimbra ; Julieta  Azevedo , (1) University of Coimbra, FPCEUC, CINEICC - Center for \nResearch in Neuropsychology and Cognitive Behavioral Intervention, Portugal.

Psychological interventions fr equently rely on large interval measurements that do not capture change and variance of \nemotions across time. We aimed to provide a detailed analysis of the variability in mood, variance and range of emotions \nacross a 12 -weeks skills based DBT programme de signed for bipolar disorder (Bi -REAL –Respond Effectively&Live mindfully). \nWe also to explore if emotional variance is associated with the use of more DBT skills, and which were more used to \nregulate.  \nMethod: 33 Participants diagnosed with bipolar disorder  were included in this study having been assessed at pre -\nprogramme (T0) and then filled in a weekly mood and diary card, filled in weekly across 12 -weeks, while receiving a DBT \nskills intervention (4 groups ≈ 8). They were asked to rate their mood and inte nsity of each emotion felt every week, along \nwith sleep hours and medication compliance, while registering skills used across the 12 weeks. There is still a group of \nparticipants undergoing treatment.  \n We hope to see a decrease in emotions rated intensity and mood variance across the 12 -weeks, expecting a more \neffective regulation of people reporting the use of more skills while complying with medication. We also hope to report the \nmost used skills within Bipolar Patients, while describing the adapted skill s considering the challenges associated with the \ndisorder.   \n \nThe role of action -contingent expectancy biases in depression -linked behavioural inactivity  \nJulie  Ji, University of Western Australia , Australia ; Colin  MacLeod , University of Western Australia , Australia  \nObjective: Behavioural inactivity contributes to the development and maintenance of depression but remains poorly \nunderstood. Whether people choose to engage in an activity or not is influenced by what they expect might happen as a \nresult of doing so (obje ctive outcome expectancies) as well as how they might feel as a result of such outcomes (subjective \nemotional impact expectancies). This study tested hypothesis concerning the presence of depression -linked negative \nbiases in both types of expectancies.  \nMethod: Using a novel laboratory paradigm, N = 176 undergraduate students were provided with the opportunity to \ndecide whether or not to play a coin -tossing game, where playing could result in wining or losing money for a charity of \ntheir choice. Following  activity engagement decision -making, participants reported on their expected objective outcome \n(win/lose) of gameplay, as well as expected subjective emotional impact of such outcomes.  \nResult: Mediation analysis results provide support for the hypothesis  that individuals with higher depression vulnerability \nare more likely to exhibit behavioural inactivity due to higher negative action -contingent expectancy biases, reflecting \nnegative biases in both expected objective outcome and subjective emotional impa ct.  \nDiscussion: Negative biases in two conceptually independent variants of action -contingent expectancies may be \ncontributing to depression -linked behavioural inactivity."

The symptoms of psychosis, and any hospitalisations following a psychotic episode, can \nrender a parent both emotionally and ph ysically unavailable to their child. There has been little research to date examining \nthe consequences of parental psychosis from a whole family perspective. This study investigates families where a parent \nhas experienced an episode of psychosis and compar es and contrasts the family members’ perspectives using qualitative \nmethods.  \nMethods : Parents with psychosis who had a child aged between three and eleven in a UK NHS Trust were invited to take \npart in the study. Semi -structured interviews were conducted with these parents, with their child (if older than 8 years old), \nand with their family members. Data were analysed using multi -perspectival interpretive phenomenological analysis (m -\nIPA).  \nResults : Five families took part comprising of five parents, four children, and three family members (two partners, and one \ngrandmother). Two families described themselves as White British, two as Black British, and in one family the father was \nBlack British and the mother was White British. Four themes were identified u sing m -IPA: 1) parental psychosis impacts the \nwhole family, 2) psychosis and parental identity, 3) parental psychosis as a source of secrecy, and 4) psychosis impacts \nsome families more: the role of fractured families and mental health knowledge.  \nDiscussi on: Psychosis had a negative impact on all family members, which led to a loss of identity for the parent and \nsecrecy between family members. As a consequence, more work is needed to support these families to explain psychosis \nto the children. These result s will be contextualised alongside findings from a scoping review which highlighted that many \ninterventions for parents with mental illness aim to improve family communication, for example ‘Family Talk’ or ‘Let’s Talk \nabout Children’. Although these interv entions were originally designed for parents with affective symptoms, more recently \nthey have been trialled with parents with any kind of mental health difficulty, including parental psychosis.  \n \nAnxiety disorders in offspring of parents with mood disorders - Risks of disorders and parenting experiences  \nEn-Nien Tu , University of Oxford, UK; Chang -Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan ; Jessica  Radley , University of \nOxford, UK ; Sam  Cartwright -Hatton , University of Sussex, UK ; Chloe  Chessell , Univers ity of Reading, UK   \nIntroduction: Offspring of parents with mood disorders are at higher risk for anxiety disorders (ADs) - potential risk factors \nof mood disorders in their later life. Proper interventions on ADs may improve well -being a nd prevent mental illness \nprogression in this at -risk population. With the increase in treatment options for different ADs, a meta -analysis aims to \ndifferentiate the risks of AD subtypes in the offspring of parents with mood disorders compared with control  offspring. \nFurthermore, to better understand the parents’ needs, another meta -analysis investigates parenting experiences in the \ncontext of parental bipolar disorder. Method: The first meta -analysis searched for original articles published in peer -\nreviewe d journals with offspring exposed to parental mood disorders and control offspring, and rates of ADs in offspring \nusing validated diagnostic interview tools. A random -effects meta -analysis was used to pool the risk ratios (RRs) of \ndifferent offspring ADs. Moreover, sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses and meta -regression examined factors that \nexplain the between -study heterogeneity. The second meta -analysis focused on qualitative views of any reporters on \nparenting experiences related to offspring up to 18 years. The findings were collected with the meta -aggregation approach.  \nResult: The first meta -analysis included 36 papers from 62,094 records. Offspring of parents with mood disorders had \nhigher risks for all subtypes of ADs, especially for panic disord er (PD). Parental BD puts offspring at increased risk for \nseparation anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder. In contrast, the psychopathology of control parents decreases their \nRRs. The second meta -analysis yielded themes that emerged from the analytic process, which described different \nreporters’ views on subjective feelings, subjective feelings, challenges, and resources of parenting experiences.  \nDiscussion: The first study indicates the AD subtypes and participant characteristics that should be emphas ised when \ntreating offspring of parents with mood disorders. The second study provides guidance to address unique parental \nchallenges and resources for parents with BD. The meta -analytic outcomes provide us insights to find new ways to help \nparents in help ing their children with anxiety."

Children o f anxious parents are at high risk of anxiety disorders themselves – approximately twice the risk of \ntypical children, according to a recent systematic review. The evidence suggests that this transmission is accounted for \nlargely by environmental rather th an genetic factors, which opens up opportunities to intervene to prevent such \ntransmission. In particular, there is evidence that supporting parenting in those with mental health difficulties can \nameliorate the risk of their children developing mental heal th difficulties. Therefore, the objective of this study was to test \nthe feasibility of a new one -session, group -based, preventive parenting intervention for parents with anxiety disorders.  \nMethods. One hundred parents with anxiety disorders, recruited from  adult mental health services in England (and their \nchildren aged 3 -9 years) were randomised to receive the new intervention (a one -day, group workshop), or to receive \ntreatment as usual. Children’s anxiety disorders and anxiety symptoms were followed up t o 12 -months by outcome \nassessors who were blind to group allocation. Analyses were conducted on an intention to treat basis, as far as possible.  \nResults. 51 participants were randomized to the intervention condition and 49 to the control condition and 82% and 80% \nof these were followed to 12 -months, respectively. The intervention was reported as highly acceptable to parents who \nreceived it. The results show that the intervention and RCT were feasible and 12 -month follow -up attrition rates were low. \nChildren  whose parents were in the intervention condition were 16% less likely to have an anxiety disorder at 12 -month \nfollow -up than those in the control group. No adverse events were reported.  \nConclusions. An inexpensive, light -touch, psycho -educational intervention may be useful in breaking the intergenerational \ncycle of transmission of anxiety disorders.

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) including \nExposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is the gold standard psychological treatment for children with OCD, however, \nlimited numbers of mental health professionals are train ed to deliver this approach (Stallard et al., 2007) and services often \nhave substantial waitlists for treatment (O’Neill & Feusner, 2015). Delivering treatment via parents may help to increase \naccess to CBT for preadolescent children with OCD, as parent -led treatments have been shown to be effective and cost -\neffective for children with anxiety disorders (Creswell et al., 2020). This presentation will present the results of a \npreliminary evaluation of a parent -led CBT treatment for preadolescent children (ag ed 5 - to 12 -year -old) with OCD.  \nMethod: A non -concurrent multiple baseline approach was used and consisted of a no -treatment baseline phase and a \ntreatment phase. Ten families of preadolescent children with OCD were randomised to a 3 -, 4-, or 5 -week basel ine phase \nbefore receiving 6 - to 8- individual treatment sessions. Parents (and children) completed semi -structured diagnostic \ninterviews prior to the baseline phase, within one -week of completing treatment, and one -month after completing the \ntreatment. We ekly parent -reported questionnaires measuring children’s OCD, family accommodation, and parents’ \nknowledge/confidence to help their child were collected. Parents’ acceptability of the treatment was assessed \nquantitatively and qualitatively.   \nResults: Visu al analyses of parent -reported questionnaires will be presented, alongside clinically significant and reliable \nchange indices for diagnostic and questionnaire measures. The percentage of children who met criteria for “clinical \nresponse” and “clinical remis sion” on diagnostic measures will be reported, alongside data on treatment acceptability.  \nDiscussion: This study provides preliminary evidence that parent -led CBT may be an effective way to help increase access \nto psychological treatments for preadolescen t children with OCD.

Radomsky , Concordia University , Canada  \nA body of research underlines the role of disgust in obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD) as it pertains to contamination \nfear (Olatunji & al., 2017). Yet, less attention has been devoted to disgust across other OCD symptoms. Further, little is \nknown about the cognitive processes accounting for the relationship between disgust and OCD symptoms. This study \naimed to systematically examine potential cognitive mechanisms mediating the association between disgust and various \nOCD symptom domains using parallel mediation analyses. A total of 149 undergraduate participants completed the Disgust \nScale, the Vancouver Obsessional Compulsive Inventory (VOCI), the VOCI –Mental Contamination, the Obsessive Be liefs \nQuestionnaire, the Contamination Sensitivity Scale and the Contamination Thought -Action Fusion Scale. While \ncontamination -related beliefs were significant mediators of the association between disgust and contamination fear \n(indirect effect β coeffici ents = .06 -.17), further cognitive mediators emerged for other OCD symptom domains. Notably, \nimportance of/need to control thoughts mediated the relationship between disgust and repugnant obsessions (indirect \neffect β coefficient = .14). These findings sug gest that the experience of disgust in OCD also translates to symptoms other \nthan contamination fear, and that both emotional and cognitive aspects are relevant.

One novel belief domain which may influence OCD is beliefs about losing control. Indeed, these beliefs are \nassociated with OCD symptoms; however, the relationship between these beliefs and other OCD phenomena, including \nother relevan t dysfunctional beliefs, is unclear. This study (pre -registration: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/MT738) \naimed to examine the relationships between beliefs about losing control and OCD -relevant appraisals (responsibility, \nthreat, and control). Currently, 67 (out of a projected 158) participants have completed the experimental protocol, in \nwhich they received false (positive or negative) feedback regarding the likelihood they may lose control and read a series of  \nvignettes describing hypothetical scenarios relevant to OCD concerns (checking, harm) which were used to measure \nappraisals. The experimental manipulation was effective at influencing beliefs about losing control, t(65)=3.03, p=0.002. \nThose who received negative (vs. positive) feedback had significa ntly higher ratings of threat, t(65)=1.72, p=0.045, and \nresponsibility, t(65)=1.70, p=0.047, but not control, t(65)=0.03, p=0.488, in checking scenarios. No differences were \nobserved between conditions in harm scenarios. The full set of findings will be re ported on the completed sample. \nTheoretical and clinical implications and future directions will be discussed.   \n \nPerspectives on the causes, consequences and experience of losing control  \nKenneth  Kelly -Turner , Concordia University, Canada ; Adam S.  Radomsky , Concordia U niversity, Canada  \nClinical accounts, cognitive theory and experimental research have indicated that beliefs about losing control are not only \ncommon, but a potential causal and/or maintaining factor in disorders such as panic disord er, social anxiety disorder and \nobsessive -compulsive disorder. However, beliefs about the causes, consequences and importance of control are not \nlimited to clinical populations. Understanding sub - and non -clinical beliefs about losing control can help to i nform our \nclinical definition of the phenomenon, delineate what aspects of beliefs about control are normative and identify how \nthese beliefs might become problematic. The present study employs thematic analysis to identify common beliefs about \nlosing cont rol from n = 7 out of a projected 21 undergraduate students. Preliminary themes include that the process of \nlosing control is emotionally laden, successful and productive people maintain control and that losing control is linked to \npowerlessness and aggres sion. These themes are preliminary and may be revised in light of additional data collection and \nanalysis. These results offer important insight into what is common among clinical and non -clinical beliefs about losing \ncontrol and inform how these beliefs m ight be worth targeting in cognitive and behavioural interventions.   \n \nParanoia in the context of COVID -19 \nChair: Jess Kingston, Royal Holloway University of London, UK  \n \nPrevalence of pandemic paranoia in the general population: An international analysis  \nLyn Ellett , University of Southampton , UK; Jessica  Kingston , Royal Holloway, University of London , UK; Tania  \nLincoln , University of Hamberg , Germany ; Suzanne  So, Chinese University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong  SAR; \nBrandon  Gaudiano , Brown University, USA ; Eric Morris , La Troube Uni versity, Australia ; Bjorn  Schlier , University \nof Hamberg , Germany  \nIntroduction: Globally, the COVID -19 pandemic has created an interpersonally threatening context within which other \npeople have become a possible source of threat.

The \ndevelopment of the Pandemic Paranoia Scale (PPS) has provided  a reliable assessment of various facets of pandemic \nparanoia. This study aimed to (i) identify classes of individuals with varying levels of general paranoia and pandemic \nparanoia, and (ii) examine associations between classification and worry, core belie fs, and pro -health behaviours.  \nMethod : An international sample of adults (N = 2510) across five sites completed the Revised -Green Paranoid Thoughts \nScale and the PPS. Latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted using these two paranoia variables. Classes were compared on \ntrait worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire), beliefs about self/others (Brief Core Schema Scales), and pro -health \nbehaviour.  \nResults : Three latent classes emerged: Class 1 with low R -GPTS and PPS scores, Class 2 with a high R -GPTS  score and a \nmoderate PPS score, and Class 3 with high R -GPTS and PPS scores. Compared to Class 1, Classes 2 -3 were associated with \nmore worry and negative self - and other -beliefs. Class 3 was further characterised by greater positive -self beliefs and less  \nengagement in pro -health behaviours. Engagement in pro -health behaviours was positively correlated with interpersonal \nmistrust and negatively correlated with paranoid conspiracy and persecutory threat.  \nDiscussion : Individuals with a general paranoia tende ncy were more likely to respond to the global health threats in a \nsuspicious and distrusting way. Our findings suggested that worry and negative self/other beliefs may contribute to not just \ngeneral paranoia but also pandemic paranoia. The preliminary find ing of a link between pro -health behaviours and \ninterpersonal mistrust warrants further examination.  \nReferences:  \nSo, S.H., Zhu, C., Lincoln, T., Gaudiano, B., Kingston, J.L., Ellett, L., & Morris, E.M.J.

We report on the cross -sectional association between minority group status and paranoia and the \npotential role of views about the self and others (positive and negative), social rank and/or social support.  \nMethods: A cross -sectional on line survey design was employed (Feb – March 2021). The sample consisted of 2,510 \nparticipants from five international sites: United Kingdom (n=512), United States (n=535), Germany (n=516), Hong Kong \n(n=445) and Australia (n=502), stratified based on sex, age and educational attainment. Participants provided demographic \ninformation, and completed a range of measures online, including minority group status (across multiple categories – \nethnicity, physical disability, sexual orientation, religious beliefs and  visible physical feature), paranoid thinking, core beliefs \nabout the self and others, perceived social support and perceived social rank.   \nResults: Consistent with previous research, minority group status was associated with higher levels of paranoia, an d overall \nassociations held across sites. Examining the impact of intersecting aspects of difference, paranoia systematically increased  \nwith the increasing number of minority groups that an individual identified as belonging to. The ways in which views abo ut \nthe self and others (positive and negative), social rank and/or perceived social support influenced this association will be \nexplored."

      "text": "81 \n \n \n Conclusions: Paranoia is more prevalent in individuals who identify as belonging to a minority group. It is imperati ve that \nwe seek to understand this better. Views about the self and others (positive and negative), social rank and/or perceived \nsocial support help to understand some of this association, but more longitudinal research is required.    \n \nParanoia, conspiracy and trust processes in the context of COVID19: a multinational study  \nAnton  Martinez , University of Sheffield , UK; Richard  Bentall , University of Sheffield , UK  \nParanoia and conspiracy are terms typically used interchangeably when referring to suspiciousness of other people’s \nintentions or the veracity of sociohistorical events (e.g. , moon landing). However, although the underlying content of these \ntypes of beliefs might be similar (e.g., seeing others as powerful and threatening), recent research suggests that these \nconstructs differ in important ways. One important feature shared by  both constructs is excessive mistrust but this aspect \nmight play different roles in each belief system. In this study, we explored the strength of associations of different trust \npredictors (i.e., trust in institutions, trust in sources of information, pe rceptual trust, and interpersonal trust) between \nconspiracy mentality and paranoid beliefs measured during the first wave of the COVID19 pandemic. We tested this \nassociation in a large representative multinational sample (UK n=2025; Spain n= 1951; and Irel and n= 1041). Confirmatory \nfactor analysis supported a two -factor model of conspiracy and paranoid beliefs in each nation sample. Path and equality \nof constraints analysis revealed that paranoia was more strongly associated with perceptual mistrust (bias t owards \nmistrusting unfamiliar faces) whereas conspiracy was more strongly associated with mistrust in political institutions. \nAlthough interpersonal mistrust and trust in informal sources of information were associated significantly with conspiracy \ntheir a ssociation with paranoid beliefs was stronger. These findings provide consistent evidence across different countries \nsupporting the view that during threatening times (i.e., a global pandemic) mistrust processes play different roles for each \nbelief system.  Furthermore, in the U.K. sample, we will further present ongoing analyses of paranoia trajectories over the \nlifetime of the pandemic (early 2020 to early 2022). Study limitations and implications will be discussed.  \n \nAdvances in understanding and treating trauma effects  \nChair: Marcella Woud, Ruhr -Universit ät Bochum, Bochum, Germany  \n \nFeasibility, acceptability, and clinical benefit of a trauma -focused stabilisation group for post -traumatic \nstress disorder patient s with complex presentations on primary care wait lists  \nMichelle  Wells , Plymouth Options and College of Life and Environmental Sciences (CLES), Psychology, University \nof Exeter , UK; Rachel  Handley , College of Life and Environmental Sciences (CLES), Psychology, University of \nExeter , UK; Anke  Karl, College of Life and Environmental Sciences (CLES), Psychology, University of Exeter , UK  \nRoutinely large numbers of people presenting with complex presentations of PTSD  in IAPT services require multi -faceted \nand extended NICE recommended treatment approaches. This can lead to longer waits for therapy potentially prolonging \npatient suffering. In an effort to minimise this suffering, we evaluated whether a newly developed trauma -focused \nstabilisation group, can offer an acceptable, feasible and clinically beneficial intervention to service users waiting for on e-\nto-one trauma therapy.  Fifty -eight patients with PTSD, waiting for trauma -focussed individual treatment were inclu ded in \nthe study. Six groups, lasting five sessions, were run by 2 therapists. Thirty -eight patients completed the study. To ascertain \nthe feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, both quantitative and qualitative data were extracted from a Patie nt \nExperience Questionnaire. The stabilisation group was found to be feasible and acceptable. Clinical benefit was assessed by \ndetermining the reliable change index for measures of PTSD, depression and anxiety from pre -to-post -treatment for each \npatient. O verall PTSD symptom reduction was medium -to-large with Cohen’s d of .77 for intent -to-treat and 1.05 for per \nprotocol analyses. Additionally, for depression and anxiety there was no symptom deterioration.  The study provided \npreliminary evidence for the acc eptability and clinical benefit of attending psychoeducational group therapy to service \nusers whilst waiting for one -to-one trauma therapy.   \n \nThe Top 10 Priorities for Sexual Violence and Abuse Research: Findings of the James Lind Alliance Sexual \nViolence Priority Setting Partnership  \nFilippo  Varese , University of Manchester, UK and Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, \nUK; Catherine  White , Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, UK ; Eleanor  Longden , Greater Manchester \nMental Health NHS Foundation Trust, UK ; Christina  Charalambous , University of Manchester, UK ; Kate  \nMeehan , University of Manchester, UK ; Rabiya  Majeed -Ariss , Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, UK"

Questions \nunanswered by cu rrent evidence were identified, and a second survey was shared to identify respondents’ priorities from \nthese. Uncertainties prioritised through the second survey were presented at a consensus meeting to agree the top 10.  \nResults: 223 participants provide d 484 suggested uncertainties. 75 questions unanswered by existing research were \nidentified, and later ranked by 343 participants. A consensus meeting with 31 stakeholders examined the top -ranking \npriorities from the second survey and agreed the top 10. Th ese included support valued by survivors, how to best support \nBAME and LGBTQ+ survivors, improving access to high -quality psychological therapies such as trauma -focused CBT, and \nhow physical and mental health services can become ‘trauma informed’.  \nConclus ions: The research priorities identify gaps in existing evidence to better support adult survivors of sexual \nviolence/abuse. Further work in these areas, including access to high -quality psychological therapies, should be prioritised.   \n \nAugmenting treatment for post -traumatic stress disorder with a computerised cognitive bias modification \nprocedure targeting appraisals (CBM -App): Results of a randomised controlled trial  \nMarcella  Woud , Mental Health Research and Treatment Center, Faculty of Psychology, Ruhr -Universität \nBochum, Bochum, Germany  \nIntroduction: Dysfunctional appraisals about traumatic event s are a key mechanism in post -traumatic stress disorder \n(PTSD). Experimental studies have shown that computerised cognitive trainings, cognitive bias modification for appraisals \n(CBM -APP), can modify dysfunctional appraisals and reduce analogue trauma symp toms. The present study tested whether \nCBM -APP could reduce dysfunctional appraisals in PTSD patients, and whether this would lead to improvements in PTSD \nsymptoms.  \nMethods: We compared CBM -APP to sham -training in a parallel -arm proof -of-principle double -blind RCT amongst 80 PTSD \npatients admitted to an inpatient clinic. Both arms comprised 8 training sessions over a 2 -week period and were completed \nas add -on to treatment as usual.  \nResults: In intention -to-treat analyses, participants receiving CBM -APP sho wed a greater reduction in dysfunctional \nappraisals from pre to post -training (primary outcome), compared to those receiving sham training, with between -group \ndifferences also found on the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI) and the PTSD Checklist fo r DSM -5 (PCL -5). \nReductions in dysfunctional appraisals correlated with reductions on the PTCI, PCL -5, and hair cortisol concentration from \npre- to post -training.  \nDiscussion: Results support dysfunctional appraisals as a modifiable cognitive mechanism, an d that their proximal \nmodification reduces PTSD symptoms. These results could open new avenues for improving present therapies.   \n \nPanel debate s \nList 25 psychologists whose work you intend to ignore, and justify your choice': A tribute to Stanley \n'Jack' Rachman  \nChair: Roz Shafran , Univeristy College London, Great Ormond Street  Institute of Child Health , UK \nSpeakers: Bill Yule , Kings College London, UK;  Adam ; Radomsky , Concordia University , Canada ; Paul  Salkovskis , \nOxford University , UK; David  Clark , Oxford University , UK \nThe title of this tribute is taken from a humorous exam paper that Professor Stanley 'Jack' Rachman set his students one \nyear. Jack sadly passed away in September 2021. His contribution to the development of behaviour therapy and, lat er, \ncognitive behaviour therapy has been enormous and across multiple areas. He is truly a foundational father of CBT. His \nexpertise included obsessive compulsive disorder, fear and courage, behavioural medicine, anxiety and emotional \nprocessing. As editor  of 'Behaviour Research and Therapy', he shaped our field by publishing new ideas that ran counter to \nthinking at the time. He was committed to sharing his expertise with early career researchers and greatly admired the IAPT \ninitiative to which he contribu ted in its early days. Jack's humour, originality, creativity, depth and breadth were legendary \nand his influence has been profound. This discussion will begin with some specific recollections of Jack and his influence on  \nthe field by individual panel memb ers. It will then open the floor for the audience to share their recollections and to pay a \npersonal tribute ."

Third wave approaches have led to a wider understanding of what change \nprocesses might take place in therapy, CBT with chi ldren has incorporated systemic and parenting based approaches and \ntechniques as disparate as Motivational Interviewing and Mindfulness have all come under the broad umbrella terms of \ncognitive and behavioural therapies.  In addition cognitive and behaviour al approaches have now been adapted to provide \neffective and culturally informed treatments across most continents and language groups including areas as disparate as \nimproving anti -retro viral adherence in HIV patients in Uganda, depressed rural women in Pakistan, obese patients in North \nAmerica and treating Tics and Tourette’s Syndrome and has been delivered by Artificial Intelligence systems without any \ninput from a human therapist. Given the breadth and depth of what CBT is and can do are we able to arr ive at a consensus \nregarding what exactly CBT is these days and what the boundaries are of this flexible and adaptive therapy?  This panel \ndiscussion with enable experts in disparate fields to make a 10 minute pitch as to their definition of CBT, to take qu estions \nfrom fellow panellists and audience members and through a process of elimination and votes managed through an online \nplatform arrive at a definition that will almost certainly please no one.  Once a date for the panel has been set we will \nadditional ly invite keynotes at the conference on that day to contribute to the panel.  \nQuestions to prompt panel members may include:  \nHow much linguistic and culturally specific adaption can happen and something still be CBT?  \nWhat 3rd wave approaches are a good fit with CBT and which may not be?  \nCan you do good CBT and score badly on the CTS -R? \nWhat is the boundary between Low Intensity therapy and CBT?  \nWhat would you say was definitely not CBT that therapists seem to do anyway?  \nHow useful is it to worry about this? And who should do the worrying?  \nWhen we say 'fidelity to the model' which model do we mean?  \n \nWhen CBT meets CDI: How do we meaningfully address issues of culture, diversity, and inclusion in \nthe training and supervision of psychological therapists?  \nChair: Majella  Byrne , King's College, London  \nSpeakers:  Juliana  Onwumere , King's College, UK; Susanna  Payne  King's College London , Anthony ; Taylor , Expert \nby Experience ; Margo  Ononaiye , University of Southampton , UK; Leila  Lawton , South London & Maudsley NHS \nFoundation , UK \nThe importance of culture, diversity, and inclusion (CDI) is increasingly acknowledged in conversations about access to \ntraining programmes for psychological therapists. These discussions form part of a much broader drive to int roduce \ngreater diversity in the socio -demography of psychological therapists, particularly in terms of racial and ethnic minoritized \nbackgrounds, and to ensure the workforce reflects local communities and improves access to underserved groups. Thus, \ninitia tives designed to identify and reduce inequities and structural barriers to successfully securing a place on a training \ncourse in under -represented groups continues to receive much of our attention. These developments are taking place \nagainst a backdrop of  events including global social movements (e.g., ‘Black Lives Matters’); and government scandals (e.g., \nWindrush), enquiries (e.g., Grenfell]) and commissioned reports on racial inequality (e.g., Commission on Race and Ethnic \nDisparities), and ongoing deba tes about inclusion, terminology, and rights (e.g., sexual and gender minorities). However, to \nwhat extent U.K. training programmes for psychological therapists meaningfully address CDI as part of their CBT training, \npractice placements, supervision struct ures, and assessed competences remains less clear. Yet the importance of these \nareas for the service user experience and their outcomes cannot be overestimated and, moreover, is typically overlooked \nas part of the discourse on these issues.  Our panel, comp rising those with lived experience and course leads from IAPT, \nclinical psychology doctoral training, and placement supervisors will debate how far the ideal and vision for promoting and \nintegrating CDI and CDI competences development into CBT therapist tr aining experiences are translatable, \nimplementable, and observable. A consideration of the key issues and challenges of addressing CDI in all aspects of the \ntraining experience, and ideas about helpful pathways forward will be discussed."

Experts will include perspectives on Beckian CBT, complex depression, anhedonia, mindfulness as well \nas child and adolescent depression.  \n \n What role should CBT and BABCP play in responding to the climate and biodiversity crises?  \nChair: Amanda  Cole , Private Practice, UK  \nSpeakers: Elizabeth  Marks , University of Bath , UK; Marc  Williams , University of Cardiff , UK \nClimate change is arguably the biggest threat that society and the world faces. And as  m embers of BABCP we are all \nconcerned with wellbeing. Should we, as evidence based practitioners, be addressing the emotional impacts of climate \nchange in our clients in the face of real world threat? Is there more that as psychotherapists we can do to faci litate  \nbehaviour change in individuals, organisations and society to mitigate the effects of climate  change? Is there more that \nBABCP can do to help us in this endeavour, in line with our mission and strategic aims.  Please come along to this debate if \nyou are curious, concerned or sceptical. We are aiming, like our partner health professionals, to put climate change on our \nagenda, to raise questions like those above, and consider ways in which we can use our existing knowledge,  and emerging \nresearch to greater benefit for all.  Marc Williams will place the panel in context and review the evidence for the impact of  \nclimate change and related factors on mental health and wellbeing. He will consider how mental health pra ctitioners could \nand should be responding, and describe actions being taken by other professional bodies. Liz Marks will elaborate on the \ndirect and indirect therapeutic work that CBT practitioners, supervisors and researchers could play in working with th e \nmental health impacts of climate change, from the individual level to considerations of public health. She will discuss the \nmoral implications of action versus inaction in the face of catastrophic climate change. Amanda Cole will explore the \npossibilitie s for the role of professional bodies in leading on, and supporting their members in responding to the climate \ncrisis. This will include issues such as declaring a climate emergency to supporting members who engage in protest and \nnon-violent direct action.   \n \nCBT in Action: Responding to the war in Ukraine  \nChair: Andrew Beck, Bradford Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust, UK  \nSpeakers : William Yule, King’s College London, UK ; Meera Bahu, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation \nTrust, UK ; Richard Meiser -Stedma n, University of East Anglia, UK ; Idit Albert, King’s College London and South \nLondon & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK ; John Green, Central and North West London NHS Foundation \nTrust, UK  \nThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia and ensuing war has created a hu manitarian crisis and led to a large number of \nUkrainians fleeing the country as refugees. Such forced migration has numerous and complex effects on individuals and \ntheir families, added to by possible experience of traumatic events resulting from the war and during flight from the \ncountry itself. CBT and the broader research and clinical community within which CBT is situated has great potential to \nprovide benefits for people affected by the war in Ukraine, not only via provision of psychological therapy t o refugees who \nhave fled the country, but also via training of psychologists across Europe to be able to offer adequate and tailored \npsychological interventions and support, and more broadly by informing local and national responses and the relevant \npolicy . This panel therefore brings together experts with a wealth of experience across different areas of responding to the \nneeds of refugees, psychological trauma, and the downstream effects of humanitarian crises such as that presented by the \ncurrent war. Tog ether they will address the question of what CBT can offer in the context of the war in Ukraine.  \n \nClinical roundtable s \nAdvances and challenges of implementing the LI approach in CYP -MH – Clinical and service \ndilemmas/developments  \nChair:  Markku  Wood , Northumbria University  and Tees Esk and Wear Valley NHS  Trust , UK"

The launch of the Wellbeing Practitioner for Children and Young \nPeople (CWP) i n 2017 and Education Mental Health Practitioners (EMHP) in 2019 have contributed to a significant \nexpansion inon low intensity practice within CYP, community and education settings.  These specialist LI CBT roles are \naimed to significantly expand workforce  capacity and improve access to high quality evidenced based early intervention for \nyoung people and their families.  Specifically targeting the needs of those who do not currently receive a service, the CWP \nroles are integrated into community mental healt h provision and the EMHPs in education settings (via Mental Health \nSupport Teams), providing interventions for the most common low -level mental health difficulties of anxiety, depression \nand behavioural difficulties. In the, relatively, short time that the se programmes have been running they have shown to be \nhighly effective and, as such, have expanded into new MH conditions with the workforce structure expanding to meet the \nneeds of this valuable workforce.  This clinical round table discussion will explain  and ‘set the scene’ for the ethos/remit of \nLI CBT and new workforce developments. Using current clinical service dilemmas and real case challenges, the panel will \ndiscuss the pros and cons of expanding a workforce at such a ‘blistering’ pace, looking at h ow services and LI CBT \ninterventions are implemented, and service structures developed.  The panel will explore themes around the treatment \ngap; complexity of cases and therefore demands on the service while maintaining the early intervention ethos. The pan el \nwill also reflect on findings of widening access survey, with current students, to represent CYP populations discussing \npotentially problematic trends in the demographics of those joining the psychological professionals network and how these \ntrends can be addressed. Finally, the panel will reflect on career progression and development needs, including \naccreditation and registration and new roles, to support the sustainability of these new low intensity roles.  \n \nHow therapy works: Perspectives on how diffe rent approaches to anxiety lead to change  \nChair:  David Veale, Kings College London, UK  \nSpeakers:  Colette  Hirsch , South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and Kings College London , UK; \nLayla  Mofrad , CNTW NHS Foundation Trust and Newcastle University , UK; Matt  Stalker , CNTW NHS Foundation \nTrust and Newcastle University , UK; Jessica  Komes , Newcastle University , UK; Clara  Strauss , University of \nSussex and Sussex Partenetship Foundation NHS Trust , UK \nWhile we have had a strong evidence base for  the treatment for anxiety for almost 50 years, there is room for \nimprovement in outcomes and in increasing the accessibility and availability of treatment. There are an increasing number \nof treatments that differ in their understanding of “how therapy wor ks”, especially at the process level. While there are \ncommon features at structural levels, the specific interventions may differ in the rationale, shared understanding, specific \nfocus, and treatment strategies.  This clinical round table brings together pr actitioners with training/research experience in \nspecific approaches to reflect on how the therapist’s approach and their behaviour in therapy leads to the co -construction \nof a space where clients can explore, experience, and “try out” different ways of re sponding and behaving.  \n 1) Colette Hirsch is Consultant Clinical Psychologist leading the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Service at CADAT, South \nLondon and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and Professor in Cognitive Clinical Psychology at KCL.

For some years now the BABCP \nhas set standards and accredited courses throughout the UK and Ireland and offers a range of levels and types of \naccreditation as practice has evolved to meet the needs of diverse client groups. Yet, significant chall enges lie ahead. The \nconsequences of a global pandemic, climate change, economic crisis, inequality and now the war in the Ukraine all have \nimplications for the nation’s mental health and therefore, the knowledge and skills needed of the CBT workforce. How  do \nwe train people optimally to respond to the challenges of such a rapidly changing world? What have we learned from how \nwe have delivered training in the past that might equip us for the future? This Clinical Roundtable explores where we have \ncome from,  where we are headed and how best we can deliver CBT training for the workforces of the future . \n \nClinical skills classes  \nWorking with interpreters - a skills workshop  \nMatthew  Wilcockson , Coventry University and Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust , UK \n \nScientific background:  In the UK, 138,000 people speak no English (or Welsh) at all, with a further 726,000 speaking “some \nEnglish” (ONS 2011) probably at a level inadequate for therapy, particularly in communicating subtleties and asserting \none’s rights (Boyles and Talbot 2017). According to government guidance, they should be offered an interpreter. Therapy \nseeking rates are low in non English speaking communities, with lack of cultural understanding, lack of service flexibility, \nand practical iss ues (e.g. negotiating public transport) cited as examples. The lack of effectiveness of translingual therapy \n(Griner and smith 2007), may be due to therapist inexperience in using interpreters, and interpreter inexperience.  \nInterpreter’s training is limite d and their employment is often based on availability rather than any assessed skill, and there \nare limited standards for assessing the interpreting quality, although this is starting to change in the public sector. \nInterpreters receive no formal training in mental health and they both hear and speak distressing information with no \ntraining in self -care skills, with 83% reporting vicarious trauma. In a session, the CBT therapist has to manage cultural \nperspectives and expectations in a client s/he is unable  to directly understand, and manage and support a professional \ntypically with limited understanding of mental health, and manage their reactions to complex dynamics without cultural or \nlinguistic understanding (e.g. Resera, Tribe and Lane 2015).  \n \nLearning Objectives: By the end of the workshop, students will be able to:  \n 1. Know how to brief and debrief interpreters.  \n 2. Be able to describe good interpreting practice.  \n 3. Be able to recognise examples of dilemmas in the therapeuic interpreting milieau and  describe ways for the therapist to \nmanage them  \n 4. Observe part of an interpreted session and reflect on good and bad practice.  \n \nReferences:  \nBoyles, J., & Talbot, N. (2017).

The most powerful trigger of \nsuch binges is starvation -based craving, while most remaining binges are emotionally triggered. Each of these mechanisms \nis well -managed by existing evidence -based CBT -ED protocols, if they are applied appropriately. However, even when using \nthose protocols, it is not uncommon for the patient to have occasional binges that do not seem to be related to either \nstarvation or emotional triggers. Patients often describe these as ‘habit’, where they cannot identify any reason for eating \nin that way. These binges are usually the result of cue learning (Pavlovian conditioning), and require an approach that is \nbased on exposure, but that is very different other forms of exposure in eating disorders. That approach is ‘cue exposure’,"

Rupt ures in the therapeutic process can be used in a beneficial way to bring about an opportunity to heal from \nand reduce maladaptive interpersonal patterns (Schenk et al, 2020).  \n The therapeutic alliance is not just a byproduct of therapy, but can be seen as a vehicle of change in therapy. Ruptures in \nthe therapeutic process can be used in a beneficial way to bring about an opportunity to reduce maladaptive interpersonal \npatterns (Schenk et al, 2020). Aspland et al (2008) noted that the ability to respond well  to ruptures is an important clinical \nskill. One of the specific clinical skills to tackle ruptures in therapy developed by Jeffrey Young is ‘empathic confrontatio n’, \nwhereby the therapist confronts the client regarding their maladaptive behaviour but does  so in an empathetic way. This \napproach can show compassion and understanding for the off -putting behaviour, and at the same time set limits (Young, \n2003).  \n \nLearning Objectives: This skills class is aimed at teaching CBT practitioners how to use empathic c onfrontation. It will \nprovide an opportunity for CBT practitioners to learn how to:  \n 1. Identify a relevant difficult interpersonal behaviour from the client.  \n 2. Harness empathy in moments of rupture, making sense of personal reactions rather than becoming defensive.  \n 3. Hold the client accountable for their difficult behaviour by giving feedback empathically  \n 4. Use techniques to ground the client to pause and r eflect, rather than becoming stuck in repeated destructive relational \npatterns  \n 5. Identify aspects of their own experience to provide a corrective experience for the client  \n \nReferences:  \nAspland H, Llewelyn S, Hardy GE, Barkham M, Stiles W.

Consequently, too many anxiety sufferers fail to change their problematic relationships with \nanxiety, so they continue to suffer.  Therapists who practice psychological flexibility from the inside out learn to be less \nexperientia lly avoidant (Luoma & Plumb Vilardaga, 2012). By bringing awareness to their fears, carrying their uncertainties \nforward and evoking attention to values, therapists can engage clients in exposure treatment faster. Furthermore,"

Moral injury is not a mental disorder, \nbut it can arise alongside, or contribute to developing PTSD as well as other mental health problems (Williamson et al., \n2018).  Moral injury has been primarily studied in military populations, but is increasingly recognised amongst other \nprofessional groups including healthcare workers affected by the pandemic, as well as survivors of accidents, crime, state -\nsponsored violence and terrorist attacks . It can arise from experiences as diverse as accidentally killing someone in a car \naccident, betraying a friend under torture, journalists reporting on mass -casualty disasters, doctors who missed a serious \nillness, sexual assault survivors who did not rep ort a serial perpetrator and emergency workers who felt let down or \nbetrayed by their leaders during a major incident.  In this class, we will describe how to address moral injury when it arises \nalongside PTSD. Based on existing evidence -based models, we di scuss how to apply the cognitive model of PTSD (Ehlers, & \nClark, 2000) to formulate moral injury reactions and how to adapt key cognitive, experiential and memory -focused \ntechniques derived from cognitive therapy for PTSD, as well as treatments for moral i njury such as adaptive disclosure \n(Gray et al., 2012) to effectively treat the problem.  \n \nLearning Objectives: Following the skills class, participants will be able to:  \n1. Understand the concept of moral injury and who might be affected  \n2. Apply the cognitive model of PTSD to clients presenting with moral injury and PTSD  \n3.

Recently, there has been growing awareness of the \nso-called ‘reproducibility crisis’ across all areas of science, including psycholog y. The reproducibility crisis refers to the \nfailure to replicate the findings of many scientific studies. This may arise from the employment of questionable research \npractices, such as ‘p -hacking’ (conducting many statistical tests, and only reporting sign ificant results), HARKING \n(hypothesising after the results are known), and outcome switching (promoting secondary outcomes to primary outcomes \nto fit unexpected results). Open Science practices, which encourage open methodology (including pre -registration of \nhypotheses and outcomes), open data (in a publicly accessible repository), and open access to publication (including pre -\nprints), are vital to combatting these. There is increasing interest in how Open Science practices can be applied to mental \nhealth r esearch, including consideration of challenges which can arise, such as how to share data safely and appropriately."

These forms of supervision where key components are omitted may indicate \nsupervisory drift (P ugh & Margetts, 2020). Little has been written specifically on drift within CBT supervision with a search \nof the electronic databases PsycARTICLES, Medline, CINAHL and Academic Search Complete using the terms ‘cognitive \nbehavioural therapy’ and ‘supervisor y drift’ generating only one result. The author has developed a preliminary model of \nsupervisory drift drawn from literature reviews of therapist schemas and therapist skill development and from the \nresponses to previously undertaken research (Roscoe et al ., 2019; Roscoe 2021a). Whilst components of the model require \nempirical support, teaching supervisors and meta -supervisors how to spot, formulate and respond to signs of drift have \nbeen well received by practitioners to date (Roscoe, unpublished).  \n \nLearni ng Objectives: By the end of the skills class, delegates will have gained knowledge and skills to be able to:  \n1.

Two Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust primary care services implemented the intervention from Mar ch to \nJuly 2021. Primary feasibility outcome measures included service users’ attendance at group sessions and online module \ncompletion rates. Other measures included service users’ self -reported symptoms, system usability, and further \nquantitative and qua litative measures designed to shed light on the experience and opinions of service users and \npractitioners. Attendance rates were high, as 75% of service users attended at least 10 (from 13) sessions. Usability ratings  \nrevealed good gradings for Zoom from all participants, but lower gradings for the eHealth platform. Further analyses \nrevealed a generally positive attitude towards digital STEPPS -EI and practical suggestions on how to improve the \nintervention. Bayesian analyses were conducted for symptom outc omes where available - none revealed evidence for an \neffect. Overall, the implementation of digital STEPPS -EI was feasible. The online delivery has the capacity to improve \nengagement with the intervention. However, incomplete self -report data and small sam ple sizes set limits to conclusions. \nMore research on the effect of this intervention on symptom outcomes is planned.  \n \nHow well do Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Behavioural Activation (BA) for depression \nrepair anhedonia? A secondary analysis of the COBRA randomised controlled trial .  \nBatool  Alalsayednasser , University of Exeter, UK ; Emily  Widnall , University of Bristol, UK, UK ; Barnaby Dunn  \nDunn , University of Exeter, UK ; Kim Wright , University of Exeter, UK ; Fiona  Warren , University of Exeter, UK ; \nHeather  O’Mahen , University of Exeter, UK  \nA secondary analysis of the COBRA randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine how well Cognitive Behavioural \nTherapy (CBT) and Behavioural Activation (BA) repair anhedonia. 440 pa tients with current major depressive disorder were \nrandomized to receive BA or CBT, and anhedonia and depression outcomes were measured post -acute treatment (6 -\nmonths) and at two further follow up intervals (12 - and 18 - months). Both CBT and BA led to sign ificant improvements in \nanhedonia from baseline to 6 -months, with no significant difference between treatments. Participants remained well \nabove healthy population averages of anhedonia at the end of acute treatment (6 -months) and there was no further \nsignificant improvement in anhedonia at either 12 -month or 18 -month follow up. Baseline anhedonia severity predicted \nless marked repair of depression symptoms and fewer depression free days across the follow -up period. The extent of \nanhedonia repair was less m arked than the extent of depression repair across both treatment arms. These findings \ndemonstrate that CBT and BA are similarly (only partially) effective in treating anhedonia, indicating that both therapies \nneed to be further refined or that novel treatm ents need to be developed to better treat the anhedonia symptoms of \ndepression.  \n \nTreating skin -picking and trichotillomania in the context of maladaptive attachment: A case study .  \nAnusha  Govender , South West London & St George's Mental Health NHS Trust , UK \nSkin-picking (SP)and trichotillomania or hairpulling (HP) are habit disorders usually treated effectively with habit reversal \ntraining (HRT). HRT is a standard treatment used routinely in primary care. However, a proportion of patients do not \nrespond. Pr esentation: The patient is a 31 -year -old married and employed female with a diagnosis of habit disorders. \nDuration of SP =27 years; HP=11 years. SP: picking skin around fingernails; toenails; cuticles; also biting fingernails. HP: \npulling hair from head. Q uestionnaires completed at baseline and end of treatment included The Massachusetts General \nHospital (MGH) Hairpulling Scale and Skin Picking Scale. Formulation and interventions: SP began during infancy after \ndeveloping insecure attachments leading to dys functional beliefs and difficulty regulating affect. HP developed during a \nstressful university exchange programme. Treatment focused on cognitive restructuring of core beliefs; emotional \nregulation strategies; developing constructive coping strategies; be havioural techniques included aspects of HRT. The \npatient refused pharmacological treatment. Outcome: The patient reframed belief systems, coping strategies and \ntolerance of emotion. Measures of HP and SP reduced to mild levels of severity from moderate/se vere at baseline. \nDiscussion: Cognitive techniques and exploring early attachment may be beneficial to overcoming obstacles to treatment \nwith HRT. Further research is required into development of habit disorders."

However, little research has focussed \nspecifically on b arriers experienced by the Muslim population or regarding the acceptability of CBT.  Methods: A purposive \nsampling method was used to recruit 23 Sunni Muslim participants (10 London, 13 Riyadh) Semi -structured interviews \nwere conducted with thematic analysi s and disconfirming case analysis undertaken. Results: Four main barriers levels \n(Individual, Islamic, Cultural, Provider) emerged with respect to accessing CBT for Sunni Muslims in Riyadh and London. \nDifferences in these barriers emerged between the parti cipants. Sunni Muslim participants resident in London were \ndivided into two groups, general refusal of psychological treatment, seeking Islamic treatment, while the other group \naccepting CBT whilst insisting on integrating it with teachings from Islam prov ided by a Muslim therapist. Participants in \nRiyadh, either accepted treatment using CBT but wanted to combine it with Islamic treatment. The second group, it \nrejected Islamic treatment, and insisted that psychological treatment be pure without any Islamic guidance.Discussion: \nCultural adaptation must be treated with caution in Islamic communities, because even within the same Islamic sect there \nare differences that lead to different acceptance of CBT among Muslims.  \n \nImpact of metacognitions and brooding in patients with anxiety disorders: more symptoms and \ndecreased quality of life .  \nBeatriz  Rueda , National University of Distance Education, Spain ; Esperanza  Valls , Actur Sur Mental Health \nCenter, Spain  \nIntroduction: Metacognitions and brooding are maladaptive  cognitive strategies related to more symptoms in people with \nanxiety disorders (AD). The aims of this study were to examine the association between metacognitions, brooding, anxious \nsymptoms (AS) and depressive symptoms (DS) and emotional quality of life (EQoL) in patients with AD; and to determine \nhow brooding and metacognitions contributed to the prediction of symptoms and EQoL. Method: Fifty -six patients \nparticipated in the study. All of them were diagnosed of some AD and were selected prior to beginnin g cognitive -behavior \ntherapy. They completed the Metacognitions Questionnaire -30, the Ruminative Response Scale, the Beck Depression \nInventory, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and the SF -36 Health Survey. Results: Brooding was positively associated with \ncognitive self -consciousness, negative beliefs about uncontrollability of thoughts (metacognition 4) and need to control \nthoughts (metacognition 5). All these metacognitions and brooding also positively correlated with symptoms. EQoL was \nnegatively associa ted with brooding and metacognitions 4 and 5. Moreover the metacognition 4 was the only significant \npredictor of more AS and decreased EQoL, whereas brooding was the only predictor of more DS. Discussion: Findings \nindicated that brooding was significantly related to more DS in patients with AD and the metacognition 4 seemed to have \nan important role in the impairment of their emotional functioning.  \n \nDevelopment of a Core Outcome Set for psychological therapy trials in acute mental health \ninpatient services .  \nCeri Morgan , University of Bath , UK; Pamela  Jacobson , University of Bath , UK; Lucy  Clarkson , University of \nBath , UK; Lisa Woo d, University College London , UK; Natasha  Tyler , University of Manchester , UK; Katherine  \nBerry , University of Manchester , UK  \nIntroduction : Core outcome sets are defined as an agreed, standardised collection of outcomes which should be measured \nand reported, as a minimum, in all trials for a specific clinical area. Use of core outcome sets improves evidence synthes is \nacross different trials and ensures that the views of service users and carers are represented in trial outcomes.  \nAim: To develop a Core Outcome Set (COS) for psychological therapy trials conducted in acute mental health inpatient \nservices. Method : 1. To conduct a systematic review of existing literature and consult with key stakeholders, using an \nonline survey and semi -structured interviews, to develop a long list of possible outcomes. 2. To use Delphi methodology to \ngenerate consensus and refine the lo nglist into a shortlist of outcomes.  3. To finalise the outcome list at a consensus \nmeeting.To include all ‘experts’ and ensure everyone has equal contribution study participants will include service users, \ninformal carers, healthcare professionals, resear chers/trialists, and end users of research.

This study examined the effectiveness of Anxiety UK’s CBT, hypnotherapy and counselling services. Delivery \nmethods (telephone, face -to-face, blended and online via webc am) were examined whilst comparing outcomes against \nNHS IAPT data. Outcome data (pre -post changes in depression and anxiety assessed via validated outcome measures: \nGAD7 and PHQ9) for clients completing therapy, n = 957; n = 427 CBT, n = 136; hypnotherapy;  n = 375 counselling, \nbetween April 2019 - March 2020 were analysed. Recovery, reliable improvement, and reliable recovery rates for clients \ncompleting at least two sessions, exceeded IAPT targets. CBT yielded the greatest change in anxiety followed by \nhypnotherapy and counselling. Post -hoc tests indicated a significant difference between CBT and counselling (95% CI −1.85 \n- −0.46, p = .002) with CBT yielding the greatest reduction in anxiety scores. Changes in depression scores were similar \nacross CBT, hypn otherapy and counselling (one -way ANOVA: F(2, 935) = 0.72, p = .49). The more sessions attended, the \ngreater the change in anxiety and depression scores with similar score reductions across therapy delivery mode.  \n Treatment gaps exist for those with anxiety.

Deficits in working memory (WM) an d increased recall of negative \nrelative to positive information have been associated with depression (LeMoult & Gotlib, 2019). However, less is known \nabout the extent to which this differs in social vs non -social contexts. This study examines whether WM ca pacity varies by \ncontext (social vs non -social) and by depressive symptoms, and whether valence (positive vs negative) influences \nperformance. To do this, we designed a novel network memory task (NMT). Method: The NMT comprises 3 conditions: \nsocial -self, n etworks including the participant; social -other, networks not including the participant, and non -social, \nnetworks of flights between cities. Within each condition, participants see 12 networks displaying the relationships \nbetween 3 -4 people (social) or fli ght paths between 3 -4 cities (non -social) and identify whether 3 individual associations \nfrom each network are positive or negative. Data collection is not yet completed. Hypotheses: (1) Individuals will more \naccurately and quickly classify social vs non -social associations; this effect will be highest in the social -self condition. (2) \nIndividuals with higher depressive symptoms will classify negative vs positive associations more accurately and quickly; this  \neffect will be greater in the social vs non -social conditions.  \n \nInvestigating the Effects of Involuntary Mental Imagery .  \nMahdi  Bagheri , Mental Health Research and Treatment Center, Faculty of Psychology, Ruhr -Universität \nBochum, Bochum, Germany ; Marcella  Woud ,  Mental Health Research and Treatment Center, Faculty of \nPsychology, Ruhr -Universität Bochum, Bochum, Germany ; Jürgen  Margraf , Mental Health Research and \nTreatment Center, Faculty of Psychology, Ruhr -Universität Bochum, Bochum, Germany ; Simon  Blackwell"

However, there is little direct evidence as to its underlying \nmechanisms in the context of psychopathology. Hence, the current study developed and tested an innovative method to \nexperimentally induce positive and negative involuntary imagery, and  by doing so test its effects directly.  Method: We \nrecruited an unselected sample for a lab -based study. Participants generated mental images or sentences in response to \nambiguous pictures with positive or negative captions in a within -subjects design. The y then completed lab -based tasks \ndesigned to trigger involuntary memories of the previously -generated images or sentences, and assess their impact on \nmood and cognitions. The study was pre -registered on the open science framework ( https://tinyurl.com/4fkwm96j ). \nResults: The new paradigm can successfully induce positive and negative mental imagery, and can be used to investigate \nthe effects in a controlled laboratory setting.  Discussion: The new paradigm provides a method to better understand \n(dysfunctional) involuntary imagery and its potential underlying mechanisms in disorders such as depression and anxiety. \nFurther, if it can be extended to also induce involuntary imagery in daily life, this could open up a num ber of possibilities \nfor clinical applications.  \n \nRepetitive negative thinking and emotional exhaustion: unveiling the role of self -judgment and \nself-kindness in a moderated mediation model .  \nJulieta  Azevedo , (1) Institute of Psychological Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal; \n(2) University of Coimbra, FPCEUC CINEICC - Center for Research in Neuropsychology and Cognitive Behavioral \nIntervention, Portugal ; Julieta  Azevedo ,  (1) Institute of Psychological Medicine, F aculty of Medicine, University \nof Coimbra, Portugal (2) University of Coimbra, FPCEUC CINEICC - Center for Research in Neuropsychology and \nCognitive Behavioral Intervention, Portugal ; António  Macedo , (1) Institute of Psychological Medicine, Faculty of \nMedi cine, University of Coimbra, Portugal; (3)Coimbra Hospital and University Centre, Portugal (4) Coimbra \nInstitute for Biomedical Imaging and Translational Research ; Ana Paula  Amaral  (1) Institute of Psychological \nMedicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of  Coimbra, Portugal4Coimbra Institute for Biomedical Imaging and \nTranslational Research ; Carolina  Cabaços , (1)Institute of Psychological Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, \nUniversity of Coimbra, Portugal;(3) Coimbra Hospital and University Centre, Portugal ; Ana Telma  Pereira , \n(1)Institute of Psychological Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Portugal;(4) Coimbra \nInstitute for Biomedical Imaging and Translational Research  \nRepetitive Negative Thinking (RNT) is a cognitive process characterized by repetitiveness, intrusiveness and difficulties to \ndisengage (Ehring 2011) which has been associated with burnout (Garratt -Reed et al. 2018), affecting negatively more than \n40% of medical and health students. Recent studies highlighted the role of RNT in Bu rnout, thus contributing to Emotional \nExhaustion (EE; Cunha et al. 2022). Self -kindness has been associated with less burnout and self -judgment has been \nassociated with the opposite (Durkin et al. 2016). The current study examines whether self -kindness can  serve as a \npotential moderator between RNT and EE mediated by self -judgment.  720 Portuguese medicine (72.4%), dentistry (15.3%) \nand other health related (12.4%) students (of which 81.4% girls) with a mean age of 21.61 (±6.87), answered an online \nsurvey in cluding the Portuguese validated versions of PTQ -15, Self -Compassion Scale/SCS, DASS -21 and MBI -SS. PROCESS \nwas used to test the hypothesized model.  The model explained 25% of emotional exhaustion, and self -judgment mediates \nthe association between RNT and  EE. Also, self -kindness moderates this mediation. Even though RNT is a predictor of EE, \nself-judgment seems to mediate this relationship is buffered when patients have some level of self -kindness. Our findings \nsuggest the training of self -kindness might b e helpful to decrease the contribution of negative cognitive processes to \nburnout in students from health -related courses.  \n \nThe rise and spread of research into intolerance of uncertainty 1994 -2021 (part 1): An analysis of \nbibliometric data .  \nChristian  Gam echo , Newcastle University , UK; Beth  Sullivan , Newcastle University , UK; Rachel  Baines , \nNewcastle University , UK; Katie  Gordon , Newcastle University , UK; Lok Lo, Newcastle University , UK; Zainab  \nOguntabe , Newcastle University , UK  \nBackground: Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) is a dispositional construct addressing an individual’s relationship with \nuncertainty that arose within the context of Generalized Anxiety Disorder in the 1990’s.

This systematic review sought to summarise the current \nevidence base for mechanisms of change in psychological therapies for chronic pain, by exa mining what proportion of trials \nincluded in the latest Cochrane review report change mechanisms, and evaluate how these conclusions are reached. \nEligibility criteria consisted of any primary or secondary paper included in the recent Cochrane review that e xplored \nmechanisms of therapeutic change using mediator analyses. One primary paper and seven secondary papers met criteria, \nand findings were summarised and evaluated using a narrative synthesis approach. A wide range of mechanisms were \nidentified, and al though the synthesis indicated that there is evidence to support the mediating role of pain beliefs (in \nparticular pain catastrophizing), the lack of methodological rigour in trial design and analyses meant that there was not \nsufficient evidence to draw fi rm conclusions about the profile of mechanisms and their universality across psychological \ntherapies. Suggestions for future research are provided to highlight the next steps chronic pain research can take in order \nto further understand these underlying ch ange processes.  \n \nChildren and Young People  \n \nThird wave parenting and autism: developing digital co -facilitated supports .  \nLisa Emerson , University of Canterbury, New Zealand ; Laurie  McLay , University of Canterbury, New Zealand  \nParents of children on the autism spectrum face unique challenges, and are known to experience heightened levels of \nparenting stress. However, these parents often face barriers in accessing support and current parenting programmes rarely \naddress parents’ own wellbeing needs. Across two studies, we aim to develop and evaluate digital third wave parenting \nprogrammes, co -facilitated by a practitioner and a parent.

Digital delivery of supports can increase accessibility, and co -facilitation with parents can enhance the social \nvalidity of supports.  \n \nAn analysis of young people’s routinely collected feedback after receiving digital CBT .  \nEmily Galloghly , Healios , UK; Frank  Burbach , Healios , UK; Katherine  Brown , Healios , UK  \nIntroduction : Digital CBT (dCBT) can achieve similar outcomes to in -person therapy but young people’s (YP) qualitative \nexperiences of receiving it online remain understudied. We explored YP and caregivers' experiences of receiving dCBT on a \nspecialist videoconferencing platform with additional digital tools. Method : YP (N=282) who received dCBT in 2020 and \ntheir caregiver(s) (N=568) completed the ‘Friends and Fami ly Test’ and the ‘Experience of Service Questionnaire’ at the end \nof therapy (YP response rate of 28.5%). Thematic analysis of free -text responses of ‘what went well’ and ‘what could be \nimproved’ during their care was conducted. Results : There were 1,245 p ositive comments, fitting 17 themes. Most \ncommonly reported for YP were: the therapeutic relationship/alliance; psychoeducation & understanding problems; \nfeeling listened to. Caregivers also praised clinician attributes. There were 687 suggestions for impr ovement, fitting 23 \nthemes. The top three for YP were: more personalised care; additional sessions; and concerns about technical issues. For \ncaregivers it was additional sessions; more parental involvement/feedback; greater continuity of care. Discussion : Routine \ncollection of feedback is key for continuous quality improvement. Unsurprisingly, feedback for this digital service mirrored \nexperiences of other services, with the therapeutic alliance being a key factor for both YP and guardians despite interesti ng \ndifferences between YP and caregiver views.  \n \n“DCBT or not DCBT, that is the question” – An Evaluation of a CAMHS Digital Cognitive Behavioural \nTherapy Pathway .  \nSam  Thompson , Oxford Health NHS, UK ; Kim Steele , Oxford Health NHS, UK ; Carey  Gurd , Oxford Health NHS, \nUK; Lauren  Goodhead , Oxford Health NHS, UK , UK; Laura  Evans , Oxford Health NHS, UK  \nThe covid19 pandemic (WHO, 2019) brought a significant adjustment in the delivery of specialist mental health treatment \nacross all services in March 2020. The mo st common change was mental health services reducing face to face contact and \nreplacing with telephone and digital consultations. Due to the early positive feedback received from delivering CBT \nremotely, it was proposed that a Digital Cognitive Behavioural  Therapy (DCBT) pathway would be implemented for a 1 year \ntrial period. Between January 2021 and January 2022, feedback data was collated from young people and families about \ntheir experiences of receiving digital CBT across BSW. The feedback focused on qu alitative and quantitative data with the \nuse of service -based questionnaires. The DCBT team received 118 referrals, of which 90 young person were deemed \nsuitable for the service (76%). Of the 90 young people accepted for treatment, 65 had been successfully  discharged from \nCAMHS (72%). General feedback had focused on the positives of having flexible arrangements due to the remote sessions \nand the nature of the therapist who was able to work creatively and collaboratively on a digital platform.  Despite being a 1 \nyear project, the results support the need for a DCBT pathway within CAMHS. There is particular emphasis on the \neffectiveness of the therapist to be able to deliver CBT digitally and achieve positive treatment outcomes. Further analysis \nof practitioner s beliefs would also be particularly useful.  \n \nUnderstanding parents’ experience of a Family Connections pilot group within a Child and \nAdolescent Mental Health Service .  \nOlivia  Harris , Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust , UK; Akvile  Bukenaite , Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust , UK; Alexandra  \nWretham , Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust , UK  \nIntro: Research has shown family members of individuals with emotion regulation difficulties often provide significant \namounts of care with implications for their own wellbeing. A growing evidence -base suggests interventions can effectively \nreduce carer burden, empowering family members to better support themselves and their loved one. One such \nintervention is the Family Connections (FC) group, a 12 -week program which d raws on DBT and peer support. Despite \nevidence that parental involvement in treatment is key in the recovery of young people, previous research on carer \ninterventions and emotion dysregulation has largely focused on adults. Thus, it is unclear how carer -focused interventions \nare experienced by parents of young people with emotion regulation difficulties. This study starts to address this research \ngap by evaluating parents’ experience of a pilot FC group delivered within a CAMHS setting. Method: A mixed -meth ods \napproach is being used. Pre -post statistics on carer burden, parental stress, mastery, anxiety and depression will be \ncalculated. Data from focus groups will be analysed using thematic analysis. Result/discussion: Project is on -going. We plan \nto compar e our findings with existing research looking at FC interventions within the adult population to observe whether \nsimilar outcomes are found amongst carers of young people. This will allow recommendations to be made regarding future \nresearch, and reflection s on how groups can be effectively adapted for CAMHS.  \n \nThe impact of attending a mental health drop -in centre for siblings of children with long term \nheath conditions ."

Siblings of children with LTCs can have \nsignificantly elevated mental health needs but these are often overlooked, poorly understood and untreated. Providing \npsycho logical support through low -intensity CBT interventions may help address their unmet needs.  The study was \nconducted as part of an uncontrolled trial evaluating a mental health drop -in centre at a paediatric hospital which offered \nsupport for patients, sibl ings and parents/carers. This study aimed to identify characteristics of siblings attending the \ncentre; describe their mental health and quality of life and examine the type of intervention required for siblings and the \nimpact on their mental health.  Eight een siblings aged 2 -17 attended the centre and received a brief mental health \nintervention over six -months, including self -help resources, referrals to internal psychology services, and/or brief \npsychological therapy. Results demonstrated a significant dec rease in mental health symptoms and increase in quality of \nlife, providing initial support for accessible mental health interventions for siblings.  This study points to the feasibility and \nvalue of assessing siblings experiencing emotional and behavioural difficulties and providing them with interventions that \nare accessible, effective and acceptable.

This unprecedented demand means there is urgent need for less resource -intensive \ntreatments that are scientifically supported, accessible and scalable, such as guided self -help (GSH). GSH is recommended \nfor adults with bulimia and binge eating disorder, and has proven efficacy for CYP with anxiety and depression. However, \nthere is little research on G SH as a treatment for CYP with eating disorders. This PhD project aims to develop and evaluate \nGSH for impairing symptoms of eating disorders in CYP for whom it is clinically appropriate. We are doing a systematic \nreview to explore the effectiveness of low -intensity interventions for the treatment of feeding and eating disorders. Our \nsearch strategy includes feeding and eating disorder terms, low -intensity psychological intervention terms and randomised \ncontrolled trial terms. The review is registered on PR OSPERO (CRD42022302956) and is currently at full -text screening. We \nanticipate 35 papers will be included, and the poster will describe their efficacy and key elements that contribute to \nefficacy. Future work involves modifying existing self -help intervent ions with input from focus groups with CYP with eating \ndisorders, their parents and health professionals, and a feasibility study to establish the preliminary effectiveness, \nfeasibility and acceptability of the intervention.  \n \nA qualitative study exploring the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people with \nlong COVID .  \nFiona  Newlands , Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London ; Trudie  Chalder , \nDepartment of Psychological Medicine, Kings College London ; Isobel  Heyman , Great Ormond Street Institute of \nChild Health, University College London ; Terence  Stephenson  Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, \nUniversity College London ; Roz Shafran , Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College \nLondon  \nSome people experience persisting symptoms after a COVID -19 infection, they are said to have long COVID. Little is known \nabout prevalence, symptoms, duration and treatment of long COVID, particularly in relation to children and young people \n(CYP). The  Children and Young People with Long COVID (CLoCk) study is a matched cohort study of 30,000 CYP aged 11 -17 \nthat tracks health over a two -year period to understand the trajectory of symptoms. Early findings suggest that \napproximately 40% of CYP report feel ing worried or sad 14 weeks after a PCR test (Stephenson et al. 2022). Additionally, \nfigures from the Office of National Statistic (ONS) report that 30% of CYP with long COVID present with a probable mental \nhealth problem compared to 7.7% of CYP without th e condition (ONS, 2022). These findings highlight the need to \nunderstand the impact of long COVID from the perspective of those with lived experience of the condition. This poster \npresentation will focus on plans for a qualitative PhD project exploring the  mental health of CYP with long COVID through \ninterviews with 16 child -parent dyads recruited from the CLoCk study.

In this study we e xamined the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of online \nDialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) skills groups for adolescents and their caregivers in CAMHS during the COVID -19 \npandemic. Method: Adolescents (n = 20, aged 14 -18 years) with emotional dysregulation and self -harm were recruited to \nthe DBT skills groups (one of 16 weeks and one of 11 weeks). Caregivers were offered two cycles of 8 -week groups \nconcurrently. The DBT skills group was offered as an adjunct to young people’s individual therape utic interventions within \nCAMHS. Assessments of emotional dysregulation and suicidality were conducted before and after treatment. Qualitative \nfeedback was collected from adolescents and their caregivers. Results: Young people (n = 13) completed the online  DBT \nskills group, and caregivers (n = 17) attended the caregiver group. Young people found the group was delivered at the right \nlevel, well -organised and accessible. They reported reductions in emotion dysregulation and suicidality (ps &lt; .05). \nCaregive r feedback suggested the group is relevant and helpful. Discussion: It is feasible, acceptable, and potentially \neffective to deliver an online DBT skills group to adolescents and caregivers. Further research is needed to examine the \nimpact of this online s kills group on suicidal behaviour and A&E attendance.  \n \nMaking it work: Pilot study of a brief Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention in a \nnon-clinical setting to improve vocational outcomes .  \nDebbie  Brewin , Mind -Growth Mastery Community Inter est Company ; Debbie  Brewin , Kings College London , UK; \nLee David , 10-Minute CBT ; Sophia  Papageorgis , Kingston College , UK  \nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy is effective in the workplace in increasing well -being and productivity (Flaxman, \n2010). We developed a four -session course which encouraged values -guided action and included assertiveness skills, which \ncan protect against low self -esteem and increase self -acceptance (Marshall, 2015). Delivered via non -clinical staff \nexperienced in vocational sup port using slide presentations, video clips, workbooks and discussion. Outcome data was \ncollected from a live group intervention for 6 participants, and 6 participating via an on -line platform, with support \nsessions. A self -report confidence rating scale ( CR) and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), (Mund, 2002) were \nadministered pre and post intervention. A questionnaire provided feedback and vocational outcomes. Results: Group: \nmean CR scores increased from 4 to 6.17. Mean WSAS scores indicated 25 % improvement with no significance shown on \npaired sample t -test. On -line: mean CR scores indicated 78% improvement, significance on t -test p&lt;0.01. There was a \nsignificant difference in the WSAS scores, p&lt;0.05. Low attrition and participant feedback suggest the course was helpful \nand well tolerated with 11 out of 12 participants employed post intervention. Results indicate improvement for both \nintervention formats. The course format can fit a 40 -minute lesson in a secondary school for year 11 pupils. Guided self -\nhelp interventions could be helpful and warrant further research.  \n \nBarriers to Emergency Department Clinicians' Confidence in Providing Paediatric Trauma -Informed \nCare .  \nNimrah  Afzal , University of Bath , UK; Mark  Lyttle , University Hospital Bri stol, UK; Eva Alisic , University of \nMelbourne , Australia ; David  Trickey , Anna Freud Centre , UK; Rachel  Hiller , University College London , UK; Sarah  \nHalligan , University of Bath , UK  \nIt has been estimated that around 31% of children will experience a traumatic event during childhood, most commonly \nserious accidents that lead to hospitalisation. Around 15% of children who experience such events go onto develop PTSD. \nEmergency department clinicians have a unique opportunity to intervene during the early peri-trauma period, which can \ninvolve incorporating a trauma -informed approach within their care. Alisic et al. (2016) previously conducted an \ninternational survey of emergency department clinicians’ attitudes towards providing trauma -informed psychosocial  care \nto injured children. Findings suggested that clinicians need further education and training to enhance their knowledge and \nconfidence in providing trauma -informed psychosocial care. Presently, a secondary data analysis was conducted to explore \nthe ba rriers experienced by U.K. and Irish emergency department clinicians in confidently providing psychosocial care. \nFindings suggested that clinician confidence may be influenced by a lack of training, worrying about further upsetting \nchildren, and low levels  of perceived departmental performance in providing psychosocial care. The findings highlight a \nneed for further training in psychosocial care for emergency department clinicians. Future research must identify nationally \nrelevant pathways to implement trai ning programmes to improve clinician knowledge of paediatric traumatic stress and \naim to reduce perception of barriers identified in the present study.  \n \nExploring the experiences of fatigue in adolescents with elevated symptoms of depression: A \nqualitative  study ."

Fatigue can also be a symptom of depression. To improve the effectiveness of treatments for \nadolescent depression, we need to better understand the importan ce of individual symptoms in adolescents, such as \nfatigue. The current study aims to qualitatively explore adolescent’s experiences and understandings of fatigue in \ndepression, in a mixed clinical and community sample. 17 adolescents, aged 15 -18 years old (M = 16.29, SD = .92), with \nelevated symptoms of depression have taken part in semi -structured interviews. A further 4 -8 interviews are expected. \nData is being analysed using reflexive thematic analysis from an inductive, experiential perspective. We antic ipate that \ngenerated themes will provide insight into how adolescents experience fatigue as a symptom of depression. Themes may \nrelate to how adolescents conceptualise, describe and recognise fatigue, how they communicate their fatigue to others, \nhow fatig ue is distinguished from other depressive symptoms, and its wider impact. This research may provide useful \ninsight into the relative importance of fatigue in the context of adolescent depression, indicating whether this is an area f or \nfurther inquiry.

Self -report tools assessing the triarchic constructs and antisocial behaviours were administered at the baseline (T0) \nand after 3 (T1) and 6 (T2) months. 1 (Group) x 3 (Time) repeated -measures ANOVAs were performed to ascertain the \nstability  of psychopathic features over time. Linear regressions were conducted to verify if the triarchic model domains at \nT0 predicted physical and social aggression and rule -breaking behaviour at T2. Results showed that boldness and \ndisinhibition did not vary ov er time, while meanness increased from T0 to T2 (M T0=36.8±5.02; M T2=37.9±4.81). Boldness \nat T0 was a negative predictor of physical (β= -.27, p=.01) and social aggression (β= -.29, p=.01) at T2, whereas meanness \npositively predicted social aggression (β=.2 7, p=.02). Thus, boldness and disinhibition may be stable features, while an \nincrease in meanness may be phase -specific of adolescence. Boldness and meanness may be, respectively, protective and \nrisk factors for the emergence of aggressive behaviour in tee nagers.  \n \nIAPT and PWP’s  \nA local service audit reviewing the outcome of a ‘3 -month waitlist hold’ initiative in IAPT for \nservice -users with co -occurring substance misuse and mental health problems.  \nShannon  Potter , Hammersmith and Fulham IAPT Service, UK ; Stephanie  Eleuterio , Hammersmith and Fulham \nIAPT Service, UK ; Alexander  Sim, Hammersmith and Fulham IAPT Service, UK  \nINTRODUCTION. IAPT services have received criticism for excluding people with co -occurring mental health (MH) and \nsubstance mi suse problems (dual -diagnosis), despite NICE guidelines suggesting these patients should have access to MH \nsupport through IAPT. In response, Hammersmith & Fulham IAPT introduced a ‘3 -month waitlist hold’ pathway: patients \nwho are identified as high risk s ubstance users are referred to local drug and alcohol support services, while also being held \non the IAPT wait -list for up to 3 months. This process is intended to provide patients with motivation to reduce their \nsubstance use and to offer a flexible, loca lly agreed pathway to re -engage with psychological therapies. METHOD. A \nretrospective audit evaluating patients with a 3 -month hold deadline that fell between 11/2018 and 11/2021. Data was \ncollected for 110 patients. RESULTS. Of those who used the 3 -month hold to reduce their substance use, 44% re -engaged \nwith MH treatment through IAPT. Of those who did re -engage with treatment 55% recovered, and drop -out rates were low \nat 36%. The most common reason among those patients who did not re -engage was no respons e to contact from the IAPT \nteam. DISCUSSION. Results indicate that the use of a locally agreed pathway to facilitate engagement with psychological \ntherapies is beneficial. These findings support NICE guidelines that substance misuse should not be an exclus ion criterion \nfor patients accessing IAPT. Suggestions are made to help improve re -engagement.  \n \nA Qualitative Evaluation of the Delivery of Training on Cultural Sensitive Treatments within an \nIAPT Service (Talking Change - Portsmouth) ."

Despite this, clients from minoritised ethnic grou ps and religious \ngroups are often under -represented in referrals and tend to have poorer outcomes in IAPT (Baker, 2020). To address these \nissues, the BAME Positive Practice Guide (Beck at al., 2019) encourages proactive work to improve access and outcomes for \nclients through service level changes, outreach, audits, adapting therapy and staff development (including through \ntraining). However, despite such recommendations there is limited provision and support to access such training.  This \nservice evaluation used qualitative methods to gather in depth data from the attendees about their experiences of \nattending the training day on Culturally Sensitive Treatments within IAPT. Thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) was \nused to analyse the data, and to identify  patterns and themes across the entire data set. Common themes included, \n'perceived barriers that clients encounter’, 'barriers that therapists encounter’, 'positive feedback about the event' and \n'constructive feedback’. Overall, the results of this evalua tion have been encouraging with respondents reporting learning \npoints and increased confidence. However, further evaluation is needed to understand the degree to which such training \nimpacts on clinical practice and whether changes are sustained.  \n \nBeyond Mo dule 3: Embedding Diversity and Inclusion in the PWP curriculum .  \nTamara  Wiehe , University of Reading , UK  \nDecolonising and diversifying the curriculum is at the top of all training providers’ agendas. Since the national Psychologic al \nWellbeing Practitioner  (PWP) curriculum review in 2015, we have seen improvements in these areas by the inclusion of a \ndedicated module towards the end of the programme focused on adapting our clinical practice for patients’ diversity \nconsiderations in line with key literature and legislation including IAPT Positive Practice guides, the Equality Act (2010), and \nthe BPS Code of Ethics and Conduct (2018). However, the timing and the focus of the module present some challenges in \nwhich we look to overcome as a programme team and ha ve conceptualised these using the COM -B behavioural change \nframework (Michie et al., 2014). Using student and staff feedback to guide initial discussions, the need to increase \ncapability and opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions on diversity and inclusion were highlighted. Due to the \nmultifaceted and complex nature of decolonising and diversifying the curriculum, the subsequent deep dive lead the team \nin many directions including: (a) reconsidering the timing of the dedicated module within the pro gramme, (b) staff training \nprovisions, (c) increasing engagement in D&I workstreams, and (d) reviewing the curriculum content session -by-session. \nEach of these pathways are discussed considering the implications for everyday clinical training and practice of LICBT, with \na particular focus on intersectionality.  \n \nTherapeutic Techniques and Innovations in CBT  \n \nEffectiveness of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy within a hospital setting (specifically relating to \nhands).  \nVictoria  Lucas , University Hospital of Derby & Burton , uk; Sarah  Burke , University Hospitals of Derby & Burton , \nUK; Anna  Selby , University Hospitals of Derby & Burton , UK; Nick  Johnson  University Hospitals of Derby & \nBurton , UK  \nAims: To investigate the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) service for patients with elective and \ntraumatic hand conditions within an acute hospital setting. Methods: Patients presenting in the Hand Unit with various \nhand conditions were offered CBT. Trauma Focused (TF) CBT was used to tre at traumatic injuries, elective patients were \ntreated with CBT focusing on medically unexplained conditions and 3rd wave CBT methods. Demographic data and \npsychological assessment scores (PHQ9, GAD7, IES) were prospectively collected for patients who under went CBT before \nand after treatment.  Results : 114 patients attended an initial treatment session and 81 completed the treatment with full \ndata available for 78 (68%) patients. Mean age was 41(range 13 – 84) and 60% were women. 64% had sustained a \ntraumati c hand injury. There was a significant fall in all measured scores following treatment (table 3). 37% of patients \nsuffered from severe depression according to the PHQ9 classification and 51% of patients suffered from severe anxiety \naccording to the GAD7 cl assification before treatment. Following the treatment this had fallen to 0% and 3% respectively \n(figure 1). At initial assessment 93% of patients who had sustained a traumatic injury had an IES score of 33 or greater \nindicating PTSD. Following treatment t his had fallen to 7%. PHQ9 (pre 16.2, sd 7.1; post 4.7, sd 4.6, p<0.0001), GAD7 (pre \n15.2, sd 5.2; post 4.6, sd 4.1, p<0.0001) and IES (pre 61.0, sd 15.7; post 11.1, sd 12.3, p<0.0001)scores all decreased \nsignificantly following treatment.  Conclusions: Many patients with traumatic and elective hand conditions have associated \npsychological problems which may influence outcome. Despite this, the use of CBT is not widely utilized in acute hospital \nsettings such as hand therapy and can impact the recovery of  the patient. CBT in a hand unit setting is an effective \ntreatment."

The purpose of this case study is to examine \nthe effectiven ess of CBT in treating FoH in a primary care psychological therapy service. Presenting Problem: Sarah was a \nwoman in her 50s with T1D. 5 years ago Sarah experienced a hypoglycaemic episode which resulted in hospitalization. \nFollowing this experience Sarah developed a FoH and engaging in various behaviours that maintained high BG levels. This \nwas having detrimental impacts on Sarah's health. General support by the hospital -based diabetes team had not been \neffective in supporting Sarah with her FoH. Case Conc eptualisation and Intervention: The treatment approach involved the \ncreation of a formulation. Sarah’s coping strategies were conceptualised as ‘safety seeking behaviours’ (Salkovskis, 1991). \nBehavioural experiments were conducted to test the various eleme nts of the formulation. This allowed Sarah to build a \nnew belief ‘If I have a hypo, I can manage'.  Outcome: Sarah exceed her goal of lowering her BG levels to an average of 10 -\n12 mmol/L, with BG levels within the recommended range 75% of the time. Her leve ls of anxiety and depression also \nsignificantly reduced. Review and evaluation:  This case study is the first to demonstrate the effective treatment of FoH \nusing CBT within a primary care IAPT service.  \n \nDemonstration of a ‘Leapfrog’ Trial as a Method to Acc elerate the Development and Optimization \nof Psychological Treatments .  \nSimon  Blackwell , Ruhr -Universität Bochum, Bochum, Germany ; Simon  Blackwell , Ruhr -Universität Bochum, \nBochum, Germany ; Felix  Schönbrodt , Ludwig -Maximilians -Universität München, Germany ; Marcella  Woud  \nRuhr -Universität Bochum, Bochum, Germany ; Andre  Wannemüller , Ruhr -Universität Bochum, Bochum, \nGermany ; Jürgen  Margraf , Ruhr -Universität Bochum, Bochum, Germany  \nIntroduction:  The ‘leapfrog’ tria l design (Blackwell et al., 2019) has been proposed as a method to accelerate development \nand optimization of psychological treatments by reducing the time, resources, and sample sizes needed. This study aimed \nto carry out a small -scale leapfrog trial (cli nicaltrials.gov: NCT04791137) to provide a first demonstration of the method \nand test feasibility. Method:  For demonstration purposes, the leapfrog design was applied to a cognitive training \nintervention aiming to reduce anhedonia, imagery cognitive bias m odification (CBM), delivered via the internet over 4 \nweeks. Sequential Bayesian analyses were used to identify treatment arms superior or non -superior to an initial control \ncondition, leading to them replacing the control condition or being dropped from th e trial, respectively. The trial started \nwith 3 arms (a control condition and 2 imagery CBM variants), and 2 further arms (additional imagery CBM variants) were \nadded as the trial progressed. Results:  One version of the imagery CBM remained as the ‘winner’  at the end of the trial (N = \n188 randomized participants), following sequential elimination of the other arms. All features of the leapfrog design were \nsuccessfully implemented and no feasibility issues identified. Discussion:  The study demonstrates feasi bility of the leapfrog \ndesign and provides a starting point for its broader adoption as a means for more rapid development and optimization of \npsychological treatments such as CBT.  \n \nLiving Well with Illness: Evaluation of a Transdiagnostic Compassion -Focus ed Therapy Group for \nLong -Term Health Conditions .  \nRachel  Snodgrass , Newcastle University, UK ; Tim Chapman , The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS \nFoundation Trust, UK ; Joanna  Carnell , West London NHS Trust, UK  \nIntroduction: Existing evidence has shown the value of Compassion Focused Therapy for a range of difficulties such as \neating disorders, psychosis, brain injury and PTSD. Although much research has focused on mental health difficulties in \nisolation, there is promise for employment of CFT interventi ons within physical health. This study was a mixed methods \nevaluation of a transdiagnostic CFT group, for adults with Long -term Health Conditions (LTHCs). Method: The group \nconsisted of 11 weekly sessions, ten in group format and a 1:1 formulation session.  Outcome measurement data was \ncollected from participants (pre and post). These measures assessed levels of anxiety, depression, overall well -being and \nconfidence for engaging in daily activities. Processes targeted by CFT were measured including self -comp assion (SCp) and \nself-criticism (SCr). Qualitative feedback was also collated and analysed using conventional content analysis. Results: There \nwas a significant reduction in scores of anxiety and depression. A significant improvement was observed for well -being and \nconfidence for daily activities. A significant improvement was seen in SCp and concurrent reduction in SCr. Qualitative \nfindings supported changes in SCp, utility of compassion -focused strategies and the benefits of a transdiagnostic format. \nDiscussion: These findings suggest group CFT is an effective approach to improve psychological well -being in LTHCs and \nthat this can be delivered in a transdiagnostic format."

Single -session interventions (SSIs) are scalable, accessible, \nand designed to deliver core evidence -based intervention components within a one -off encounter. COMET (Common \nElements Toolb ox) is an online self -help SSI, including cognitive restructuring, gratitude, and behavioural activation. COMET \nhas previously been tested in India and the US with promising results. However, it has yet to be evaluated in UK university \nstudents. Method: We  are conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of COMET versus a waiting list control, with 2 - \nand 4 -week follow -ups. Any UK university student can take part.

Simple randomization using electronic random number generation was used to \nallocate Sau di undergraduate females (N=92; mean age = 20.48 years; SD = 2.28) to either a culturally -adapted version of \nthe Body Project or a health education control condition. Participants completed self -report measures of eating pathology, \nbody image, depression a nd social anxiety before and following the interventions and at three -month follow -up. Results: \nThe control group made very limited changes following the education intervention. In contrast, the Body Project \nintervention yielded extensive positive benefits , with moderate to strong effect sizes. Attending sessions and completing \nhomework did not influence outcomes. Conclusion: The effectiveness of the Body Project for Saudi women indicates that \nthe change methods used are relevant across cultures and deliver y methods. Women in Saudi Arabia with pathological \neating and body concerns can be helped through the appropriate adaptation of a prevention programme developed in a \nWestern culture.  \n \nTraining and Supervision  \n \n“Power to the People”: Training for healthcare professionals in supporting persistent pain .  \nAlex  Corline , Newcastle University , UK; Chris  Penlington , Newcastle University, UK ; Frances  Cole , Live Well with \nPain, UK  \nPersistent pain is thought to affect one -third of the UK population. Self -man agement is a key approach recommended for \npersistent pain. However, many healthcare professionals (HCPs) are unfamiliar with supporting self -management. The 10 \nFootsteps training was developed to cover all facets of pain self -management and may help HCPs. Our study explores \nHCPs’ issues in supporting persistent pain self -management and tests if the 10 Footsteps training improves confidence \nsupporting self -management. Training consisted of two half -day periods covering the 10 Footsteps to pain self -\nmanagemen t and four optional question sessions. Questionnaires on confidence supporting self -management were given \nat baseline and three months post training, pairing 18 results. Five trainees volunteered for semi -structured interviews \nevaluating the training and t he problems supporting pain self -management. Average confidence on the 10 self -\nmanagement topics increased from baseline (M= 3.11/5, SD=0.81) to post training (M=4.03/5, SD=0.592) t(18)=4.078,"

Research suggests that C BT \nis often underused and delivered inadequately within clinical practice (Hernandez Hernandez & Waller, 2021). To the \nauthors' knowledge, exploration of TCPs’ experiences of applying CBT principles on their Clinical Psychology (CP) training \nplacements is yet to be evaluated. This evaluation therefore aimed to gain an understanding of TCPs’ experiences of \ndelivering CBT on clinical placement, focusing on the facilitators and potential barriers of good practice. Method: Seven \nTCPs on a UK CP programme participated in a 60 -minute focus group using a video -conferencing platform. Reflexive \nthematic analysis (Braun  & Clarke, 2012) was used to analyse the data and five themes were generated. Results: TCPs’ \nviews on the facilitators and barriers to their CBT practice were identified. The five themes were “Feeling Underprepared \nfor Placement”, “Placement Supervisors”, “Additional Support”, “Personal Views”, and “Concerns over Therapeutic \nRelationship”. Discussion: Strengths and limitations were ascertained in the selected CP programme’s CBT provision, across \ndifferent domains of training.

Some people may experience doubts about the natu re of existence itself, such as \nquestioning what will happen to them after death. Others may worry about the process of dying, such as whether their \ndeath will be painful, or what their final moments will be like. Some may be distressed at the idea of losi ng a loved one. \nThey may worry about how they will cope with their loved ones’ death or that they will somehow cause the death of their \nloved one without meaning to. For some there is a phobic avoidance and fear of anything related to death (e.g. going nea r \ncemeteries or funeral parlours). All the experiences above are in many ways part of being human, but death anxiety is a \nproblem when it is either sufficiently time -consuming, distressing or interfering in one's life. The concept cuts across \ndifferent dia gnoses including some types of Health Anxiety, OCD, specific phobias, and panic disorder. Unfortunately, \ndeath anxiety may not be adequately targeted in standard protocols for these disorders and this workshop will try to \nremedy this with a specific focus on the fears of death and dying. Treatment components will be discussed, centring on \nCBT, which is the most evidence -based treatment for death anxiety.  \n \nLearning Objectives: By the end of the skills class, participants will : \n1. Understand the context and p henomenology of death anxiety, and its relationship with relevant diagnoses  \n2. Be knowledgeable about a cognitive behavioral model and have a understanding of the cognitive processes and \nbehaviours that maintain death anxiety. This includes the intolerance  of uncertainty, magical thinking, the awfulness of \ndying, as well as avoidance, safety seeking and checking behaviours related to death.  \n3. Develop alternative ways of thinking about common beliefs in death for example thoughts about the awfulness of not  \nexisting or the intolerance of not knowing will happen.  \n4. Use appropriate exposure/ behavioural experiments for death and dying and consider what expectations are being \ntested. Fifteen different tasks will be discussed from writing out one’s funeral wis hes and obituary, painting one’s coffin or \ncollecting “memento mori”.  \n5.

This was \nfollowed by evidence that CBT for eating disorders (CBT -ED) can be delivered effectively for most patients in a much \nshorter format than previously recommended. The resultant 10 -sessi on therapy (CBT -T) has now developed a substantial \nevidence base, demonstrating that it can be as effective as 20 -session therapy, with equally large effect sizes and recovery \nrates. The therapy is based on a protocol that stresses the need to flex therapy  to the individual patient, without losing \nsight of the key tasks of that therapy. It differs from previous, longer forms of CBT -ED in using more intensive methods of \nproducing change.  This protocol has been used to train large numbers of clinicians in eat ing disorders services in the UK \nand internationally. This workshop will introduce clinicians to the ways in which CBT -T addresses the core competences"

When the perceived threat is unrealistic, such as in \npanic disorder or health anxiety, identifying and testing safety behaviours is relatively straightforward. When facing \nadversity, howeve r, the difference between adaptive and maladaptive coping can be more nuanced. It is often the degree \nand flexibility with which coping methods are applied that differentiates helpful from unhelpful coping. This workshop will \ndraw on scientific evidence fr om research on coping and in behavioural medicine to help participants understand the \nfactors that facilitate effective coping.  \n \nLearning Objectives:  \n1. To understand the correlation between particular coping styles and adjustment - The '3 Cs' of control,  coherence and \nconnection.  \n2. To be able to use the concept of 'focus of coping' to enhance their work with people facing adversity - focus on the \nproblem, the emotional reaction to the problem, or focus on maintaining and building their life beyond the pr oblem.  \n3. To differentiate between effective coping and safety behaviours by examining the function and flexibility of the coping \nstrategies employed.  \n \nReferences:  \nMoorey S (1996) When bad things happen to rational people: cognitive therapy in adverse lif e situations.

However, many treatment trials of this general approach have excluded \nyoung people with panic disorder, and existing treatments specifically for adolescent s with panic disorder require a \nconsiderable amount of therapist time (between 11 and 22 hours of therapy). As such, there is a clear need to develop \neffective, scalable treatments. In adults, individual cognitive therapy based on Clark’s (1986) cognitive model for panic \ndisorder has been shown to be highly effective, including in a brief format. We have recently evaluated the brief version of \nthis treatment, adapted for use with adolescents, within the PANDA feasibility randomised controlled trial \n(https:/ /doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN14884288). Cognitive therapy was delivered 1:1 (face to face and remotely) by children’s \nwellbeing practitioners within an NHS -commissioned clinic. It involved 5 treatment sessions and 2 booster sessions. Prior \nto each of the first 4  sessions, the young person was given a self -study workbook to read, which also included written \nexercises and homework activities. This approach will be presented within this workshop.  \n \nLearning Objectives: By the end of the workshop, participants will be  able to:  \n1. Assess panic disorder in adolescents and use sessional measures to guide treatment  \n2. Understand the key elements of cognitive therapy for panic disorder  \n3. Put together an individualised model of panic disorder for a young person  \n4. Understand the role of education about the nature of anxiety and the meaning of different body sensations  \n5.

Since then, there have been numerous \nstudies exploring and validating this approach for differen t populations.  This workshop will introduce the DBT for \nAdolescents formulation and look at the 5 sets of skills taught in the DBT -A programme. I will discuss the particular group \nprocesses involved in working with adolescents who present with emotion dysr egulation and relationship difficulties.  \nMindfulness is key to the development of effective functioning and self -management. Distress Tolerance and Emotion \nRegulation skills are essential for understanding and regulating emotions, while Interpersonal Effec tiveness and Walking \nthe Middle Path are based on conflict resolution and uses standard assertiveness skills. DBT -A takes a very practical and \naccessible approach to increasing effectiveness in many areas, which often requires the skilful blend of all 5 sk ill sets.  While \nDBT-A was initially developed for adult patients with Borderline Personality Disorder, many of its principles and practical \ninterventions have been taught to adolescents with good effect. Teaching adolescents DBT -A skills for use in their e very -\nday life, can help them deal with difficulties such as how to understand and regulate strong emotions and recognise \nharmful friendships in a better way.  \n \nLearning Objectives: Participants will acquire the following skills:  \n1. To introduce DBT -A Skills  Training in the context of the DBT -A formulation, which hypothesises skills deficits in people \nwith BPD and other disorders featuring emotion dysregulation.  \n2. To introduce the 5 DBT -A skills, Core Mindfulness (the skills that underpin all DBT skills and practice), Distress Tolerance, \nWalking the Middle Path, Emotion Regulation and Interpersonal Effectiveness. We will address how these are taught in \ngroups.  \n3. To model and invite delegates to practice the teaching of key DBT -A skills.  \n \nReferences:  \nRathus, J. and Miller, A. (2015).

Although these treatments are conceptually and procedurally  \ndistinct, they all share the following features: (1) they are based on models that involve multiple affective, cognitive, and  \nbehavioural components; (2) they include several intervention strategies that target the model components; and (3) \nalthough they have empirical support, their efficacy lags behind that of CBT protocols for other anxiety disorders. \nConsequently, our group developed a new, highly focused treatment for GAD: Behavioural Experiments for Intolerance of \nUncertainty. The treatment draws upo n 25 years of research on the role of intolerance of uncertainty in GAD, as well as on \nrecent theorizing on the mechanisms of fear reduction. In brief, the new treatment uses the structure of behavioural \nexperiments to explicitly test client hypotheses and  thus enhance new learning during exposure to uncertainty. The \ntreatment has now been tested in two clinical trials, with results showing that it promotes impressive change in negative \nbeliefs about uncertainty, the symptoms of GAD and general psychopathol ogy. The goal of this workshop is to present the \nnew treatment’s underlying theory and to illustrate its strategies and procedures.  \n \nLearning Objectives:  \n1. To recognize the many faces of intolerance of uncertainty to improve diagnostic decisions involvin g GAD.  \n2. To learn how to adjust one’s therapeutic attitudes to promote exposure to uncertainty in session.  \n3. To clearly understand the treatment’s underlying model and how the model relates to general cognitive -behavioural \ntheory.  \n4. To learn how to use exposure -based behavioural experiments to promote new learning about uncertainty and its \nsequelae.  \n5.

Sexual assault is the \nmost frequent cause of PTSD in women, and tends to lead to particularly severe symptoms (Smit h et al., 2016). We will \noutline some of the challenges in working with survivors to treat PTSD following sexual assault, and formulate them within \nthe cognitive model of PTSD (Ehlers & Clark, 2000). The following areas will be discussed:  \n• Working with co gnitive themes such as self -blame, ‘rape myths’, mental contamination, shame, defeat and loss of trust.  \n• The nature of trauma memories following sexual assault, with particular reference to drug -facilitated rape, non -fatal \nstrangulation and multiple vict imisation.  \n• Working with the consequences of sexual exploitation and grooming, including secrecy, ambivalence and loyalty to the \nperpetrator.  \n• Coping strategies following sexual assault, including avoidance, self -harm, risky sexual behaviour and dissociation.  \n• The relational impact of sexual assault, including reclaiming intimacy and sexuality.  \n• The impact of media coverage, social and political discourses.  \n• Issues within the therapeutic relationship, including obstacles to disclosure, therapis t gender and adapting for diversity.  \n• Practical issues such as legal processes and safeguarding.  \nWe will describe and demonstrate how to adapt cognitive therapy for PTSD to address these issues, and invite participants \nto practise key skills  \n \nLearning Objectives:  \n1. Identify common themes and challenges in treating PTSD in women following sexual assault"

Formulating client AND therapist emotional avoidance in CBT  \nVickie  Presley , Coventry University , UK \nScientific Background:  Whilst CBT is not primarily conceptualised as functioning via emotional processes per se, there is \ngrowing evidence that emotional processing is fundamental to psychological change and client recovery (Baker et al., \n2011). The role of experiential or 'emotional' avoidance i n the maintenance of psychopathology has increasingly been \nconsidered in the psychological literature. Research has shown that accepting emotions rather than avoiding them, results \nin lower levels of negative affect (Shallcross et al., 2010), with intolera nce of distress being highlighted as a transdiagnostic \nmaintenance factor across disorders (Michel et al., 2016). Given that many clients present with difficulties related to \nemotional experiencing and expression, it is important that therapists are equipp ed with the skills to intervene effectively \n(Follette and Batten, 2002). However, therapists may have their own unhelpful beliefs about the role of emotions in \ntherapy which impede this process (Leahy, 2015). The impact of therapist schemata has been docum ented (Haarhoff, \n2006; Presley et al., 2017) and more attention given to the benefits of therapists reflecting upon the interaction of their \nown schema with their therapeutic work (Leahy 2001; Young, Klosko and Weishar, 2003). In summary, whilst there is a n \nargument for helping clients to reduce emotional avoidance as part of cognitive -behavioural treatment, therapist beliefs \nabout emotions are also important as part of this process.  \n \nLearning Objectives: This workshop will enable participants to consider w ays to identify and formulate emotional \navoidance in CBT, from the perspective of both client and therapist beliefs.  \nKey Learning Outcomes:  \n1. Improve understanding of emotions and their significance in cognitive -behavioural treatment  \n2. Consider the im pact of unhelpful beliefs about emotions and their behavioural manifestations (client and therapist)  \n3. Improve ability to identify and formulate emotional avoidance with clients as part of CBT treatment  \n4.
