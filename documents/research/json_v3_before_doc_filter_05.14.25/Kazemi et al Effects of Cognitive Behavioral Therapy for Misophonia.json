      "text": "1. Introduction  \nMisophonia  is a new condition in which people have highly adverse phy sical and \nemotional reactions to certain everyday sounds, such as chewing , slurping, nose \nsniffing, or breathing, frequently referred to as triggers. The first d efinition of \nmisophonia was \"an abnormally strong reaction is triggered by a sound with a \nspecific pattern and meaning to an individual,\" according to Jastreb off (Jastreboff et \nal., 2014) . Misophonia sufferers frequently exhibit avoidance or escape behavio rs in \nan attempt to avoid being around sounds that trigger them, wh ich can have \ndetrimental effects on interpersonal relationships and cause th em to become isolated. \nMisophonia sufferers usually perceive sound normally, so hearing th reshold \nproblems cannot be the cause of their negative responses (Schröder et al., 2013; \nSchröder et al., 2014; Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2015) . Cavanna and Seri suggest that \nmisophonic reactions could result from enhanced limbic system and  auditory \nstructure connectivity (Cavanna and Seri. 2015) . \nAccording to the few currently available sources, 6% and 20% o f students are \nthought to have misophonia (Wu et al., 2014; Zhuo et al., 2017) . Given the large \nnumber of people with this disorder, it is clear that more research is required to \nidentify effective treatment and prevention methods. Despite the disorder's high \nprevalence, little research has been done on it up to this point. So, the Diagnostic \nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) does not d efine misophonia \nprecisely (Ghorbani et al., 2022) . Studies already conducted indicate that people \nwith misophonia corresponded to with the criteria of at least one ad ditional mental \ndisorder. Erfanian et al. found that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, 15.4%), \nobsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, 11.5%), major depressive disorder (9.6%), \nand anorexia nervosa (9.6%) are among the most common comorbidities (Erfanian \net al., 2019) . \nIt has not yet been reported that any conclusive treatment is effe ctive. However, \nthe results of Lewin et al. suggest that CBT can be an app ropriate approach to start \na psychotherapeutic intervention for misophonia (Lewin et al., 2021) . This \ncomprehensive approach not only alleviates the immediate dist ress caused by trigger \nsounds but also contributes to long-term coping strategies that enh ance daily living. \nNonetheless, six studies utilizing CBT have produced enco uraging outcomes \n(Bernstein et al., 2013; Dozier, 2015a, b; McGuire et al., 201 5; Reid et al., 2016; \nRosenthal et al., 2023) . As one of the main symptoms of misophonia is heightened \nattention to trigger sounds, the principal objective of CBT is  to lessen the arousal \nthat these sounds cause (Jager et al., 2021) . In a study by Schröder et al., after eight"

Thus, we deci ded \nto conduct this systematic review after reviewing various stu dies and the lack of a \ncomprehensive review on the effectiveness of CBT on misophonia. \n2. Method \nThis review followed the PRISMA-ScR checklist (Moher et al., 2015)  for reporting \nsystematic reviews (Fig 1) . First, the purpose of the investigation and its rationale \nwere established. A thorough, comprehensive approach to literature wa s used to \nidentify the relevant research. The selection of studies was ca rried out using defined \nsearch parameters. The findings were gathered, incorporated, and presented. Experts \nthen examined the results in the field. \n2.1. Eligibility criteria \nThe PICO framework, consisting of Population, Intervention, Com parison, and \nOutcome, is commonly used by researchers to formulate clear and focused researc h \nquestions. By defining these components, PICO helps establi sh inclusion and \nexclusion criteria, guiding the literature review process and ensuring a structured \napproach to research. This framework is essential for conducting valid , valuable \nresearch, as it helps focus the inquiry and facilitates systemat ic evidence searches \n(Schardt et al., 2007) . \nWe included records if they a) reported randomized controlled t rials (RCTs), \nopen-label studies, and pilot cases where the effectiveness o f a treatment was \ndocumented and tested, and misophonia was the primary complaint  or treatment \ntarget. b) They have to describe a population of patients with misophonia. c) \nTreatment outcomes should have been accurately reported in tr ials. d) They included \nall ages and comorbidities. e) The data were limited to studies submitted in English."

Subsequently, the full texts of the selected articles wer e \nthoroughly reviewed. During this evaluation, there was no disagreement b etween the \nresearchers as to whether or not an article should have been submitted. \n2.4. Data extraction \nThe researchers extracted all information from the articles into an E xcel file based \non the following items: Year of publication, study type, stud y objective, number of \nparticipants, the average age of participants, age range, the gender ra tio of \nparticipants, clinical symptoms or concurrent physical or menta l illnesses of \nparticipants, method of participant grouping, randomization of p articipants, blinding \nof grouping, blinding of therapists to the type of intervention , blinding of therapists \nto the type of intervention, triggering sounds, a treatment use d, outcome measures, \nprimary outcomes, number of treatment sessions, recommended techniques , \nmedications or complementary treatments, assessment time, article out come, \nconditions and limitations, weaknesses or strengths, and not es.

      "text": "3.2. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)  \nCBT is a well-researched and structured short-term therapy that aims to address \nmaladaptive thought patterns and behaviors, commonly applied in treating mental \nhealth disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-trau matic stress, by involving \ntechniques that help patients identify and challenge disto rted cognitions, leading to \nimproved emotional and behavioral responses, and is recognized  for its effectiveness \nin reducing symptoms and improving overall psychological fun ctioning (Hofmann \net al., 2012) . \nAlthough limited results have been obtained so far for the effe ctive treatment \nof misophonia, CBT has been recognized as the most effective approach. In a study \nby Schröder and colleagues, 90 patients with moderate misophonia rece ived CBT \nsessions bi-weekly (Schröder et al., 2017) . The components of this therapy included \ntask concentration exercises, counterconditioning, stimulus manip ulation, and \nrelaxation exercises. The task concentration exercises aimed to redirect t he patient's \nattention from the triggering sound to something else whenever they  encountered \nthe sound. In counterconditioning, pleasant stimuli, like th e person's favorite music, \nwere paired with triggering sounds, like chewing noises, to es tablish positive \nassociations. Dozier initially used this approach in his case studies (Dozier 2015a, \n2015b, 2015c) . The triggering sounds were made manageable through stimulus \nmanipulation so that people could do so in a secure setting, li ke on a computer. \nFinally, relaxation techniques were used to lessen agitation bro ught on by the \ntriggering noises. \nNine percent of patients experienced total symptom remission fol lowing group \ncognitive behavioral therapy (G-CBT), and 48% had a 30% or hig her decrease in \ntheir A-MISO-S scores (Schröder et al., 2017) . Furthermore, after three months of \nCBT, a significant decrease in misophonia symptoms was seen in a study by Jager \nand colleagues compared to the waiting list group. This improvemen t persisted a \nyear after the treatment's conclusion (Jager et al., 2021) . In research conducted at \nTehran’s Tarbiat Modares University, 69% of participants reported improved \nmisophonia symptoms following CBT. This therapy also led to r eductions in anxiety \nand depression and increased distress tolerance (Ghorbani et al. reported  results for \nOG-CBT and OG-MACT separately, ensuring clarity in their indi vidual \neffectiveness) (Ghorbani et al., 2022) . \n4. Discussion \nThis systematic review aimed to investigate the effectiveness of CBT  for \nmisophonia. We found six studies that met our inclusion criteria, five being RCTs"

      "text": "and one being an open-label study. The studies provided e ncouraging evidence that \nCBT can be a practical treatment approach for misophonia, leading to sig nificant \nreductions in symptoms and improved quality of life for patie nts (Schröder et al., \n2017; Bernstein et al., 2013; Dozier 2015a,2015 b; McGuire et al., 2015; Reid et \nal., 2016; Rosenthal et al., 2023) . \nCBT is effective in treating misophonia by developing coping skills t o prevent \nand appropriately respond to its distressing symptoms (Brout et al., 2018; Jager et \nal., 2021) . It is assumed that this disorder is not caused by anatomica l abnormalities \nleading to auditory problems (Møller, 2011)  but rather by an overly sensitive \nconnection between the limbic and sympathetic nervous system s (SNS; Jastreboff & \nHazell, 2008) . Some authors believe this hypersensitivity in individuals with \nmisophonia can be altered by changing their cognition and behavi or (Swedo et al., \n2022) . Furthermore, CBT helps patients with misophonia to have greater co ntrol \nover their emotions and behavioral reactions, allowing them to exh ibit fewer \nnegative responses whenever they hear or anticipate triggering s ounds (Ferrer-\nTorres & Giménez-Llort, 2022 (. \nA key strength of this review is its focus on RCTs, which provide a robust \nmethodology that strengthens the overall findings and increase s confidence in the \nresults. Notably, all studies reported positive outcomes for CBT , with a significant \ndecrease in misophonia symptoms observed in both treatment groups  compared to \ncontrols. This consistency across studies using diverse met hodologies suggests that \nCBT offers a robust and generalizable treatment approach for misophonia (Schröder \net al., 2017) . \n4.1. Limitations and Future Directions \nDespite the promising findings, some limitations need to b e addressed. First, the \nsample sizes in the included studies were relatively small. Howe ver, the potential of \nlarger-scale studies with more extended follow-up periods to confi rm the long-term \nefficacy of CBT for misophonia is a beacon of hope. Additionally, the studies \nincluded participants with varying degrees of misophonia severi ty, and this opens \nthe door for future research to explore whether CBT is equally effectiv e for all \nseverity levels. \nAnother limitation is the potential for comorbid condition s. Misophonia is often \ncomorbid with other mental health disorders, such as anxiet y and depression \n(Erfanian et al., 2019) . The studies included in this review did not control for these \ncomorbidities, which could potentially influence the treatment  outcomes. Future"

      "text": "research should investigate the effectiveness of CBT for misophonia in  patients with \ncomorbid conditions (Erfanian et al., 2019) . \nFinally, it is essential to acknowledge that CBT may not be su itable for all \npatients with misophonia. Some individuals may have difficulty  engaging in therapy \nor may require additional treatment modalities in conjunction  with CBT. Further \nresearch is needed to identify factors that predict treatment response and t o develop \nalternative treatment options for patients who do not respond well t o CBT. \n5. Conclusion \nThis systematic review suggests that CBT is a promising treatment  approach for \nmisophonia, with the potential to reduce symptoms and improv e the quality of life \nfor patients significantly (Jager et al., 2021; Schröder et al., 2017; Bernstein et al.,  \n2013; Dozier 2015a,2015 b; McGuire et al., 2015; Reid et al ., 2016; Rosenthal et \nal., 2023) . However, further research is needed to address the limitations id entified \nin this review and to optimize CBT interventions for miso phonia. Future studies \nshould explore the effectiveness of CBT for different severities of misopho nia, \ninvestigate the impact of comorbid conditions on treatment ou tcomes, and identify \nfactors that predict treatment response. Additionally, research int o alternative \ntreatment modalities for misophonia is crucial to ensure that al l patients have access \nto effective interventions."
