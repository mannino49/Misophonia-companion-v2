  "abstract": "Separate air and bone conducted food sounds generated by six subjects into eight foods; were recorded and analysed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) signal analyser. A panel of 60 subjects classified the 8 foods according to their texture: crunchy and crackly and these textural characteristics were described by spectral characteristics of sounds. Foods (such as extruded flat breads) were found to generate high pitched sounds that show a high level of frequencies higher than 5 kHz, especially for air conduction. Crunchy foods (such as raw carrot) generate low pitched sounds with a characteristic on frequency range 1.25 to 2 kHz for air conduction. And crackly foods (such as biscuits) generate low pitched sounds with a high level of bone conduction. We hypothesize that discrimination between crunchy and crackly foods could be due to vibrations propagated by bone conduction that also generated vibrotactile sensations.",
