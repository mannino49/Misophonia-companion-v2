The physical characteristics of\nthe sound are secondary ”(p. 376). A recent consensus definition\nwas reached to aid empirical investigations, describing misopho-nia as a disorder related to decreased sound tolerance that evokes\nstrong negative emotional, physical, and behavioural responses to\nsounds that do not bother people normally. It is the specific pat-tern or meaning rather than the loudness of sound that appearsto be the problem, and the trigger sounds are often elicited by\nanother individual and often produced by the body (e.g. eating\nor chewing sounds). Individuals with misophonia may find itdifficult to distract themselves from the trigger sound and mayexperience impaired social, occupational, or academic function-\ning. Misophonia symptoms and severity vary between individu-\nals, however, it commonly develops in childhood or earlyadolescence (Swedo et al. 2021 ).\nThe consensus definition of misophonia does not specify the\naetiology, relation with psychological conditions or whether\nmisophonia should be considered a psychiatric condition due to\na paucity of empirical evidence on these topics (Swedo et al.2021 ). However, some studies support an underlying neurobio-\nlogical mechanism with evidence from functional magneticresonance imaging of abnormal functional connectivity of the\nanterior insula (Kumar et al. 2017,2021; Schr €oder et al. 2019 )\nand a significantly smaller mean peak amplitude of the N1\nevent-related brain potential component during an auditory odd-\nball task, suggesting a neurobiological deficit reflecting eitherimpaired processing or perception of auditory information\n(Schr €oder et al. 2014 ). Others have explored misophonia in rela-\ntion to neuroticism due to a similarity in characteristics, that is,\nthe frequent and intense negative emotional reactions to trigger\nsounds in misophonia and to stressors in individuals high in the\npersonality trait neuroticism (Cassiello-Robbins et al. 2020 ;\nWidiger 2009 ). For instance, one study reports preliminary find-\nings of above average scores on neuroticism by individuals with\nsuspected misophonia (Jager et al. 2020), while others report sig-\nnificant correlations between neuroticism and symptoms of\nmisophonia in university students (Daniels, Rodriguez, and\nZabelina 2020 ), an adult transdiagnostic sample (Cassiello-\nRobbins et al. 2020 ), and a clinical sample of non-psychotic psy-\nchiatric outpatients, although in this study, neuroticism was not\na significant predictor of misophonia (C ¸olak et al. 2021 ). Further\nresearch is needed to elucidate the relationship between miso-\nphonia and neuroticism, but current research suggests that\nhigher neuroticism is a risk factor for misophonia (Cassiello-\nRobbins et al. 2020 ).

      "text": "research serve to underscore that misophonia should be studied\nas a condition within several scientific disciplines such as audi-ology, psychology, and neuroscience (Swedo et al. 2021).\nMisophonia assessments in a Cross-Cultural perspective\nIrrespective of scientific discipline, it is important to have avail-\nable valid and reliable measures to uncover the background,resulting emotions and behaviours, and degree and severity ofmisophonia. There are several misophonia questionnaires avail-able including the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu et al.2014 ), the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-Miso-S; Naylor et al.\n2021 ), MisoQuest (Siepsiak, /C19Sliwerski, and Łukasz Dragan 2020),\nand the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (Rosenthal et al. 2021 ).\nThe MQ (Wu et al. 2014 ) was the only misophonia questionnaire\nthat had preliminary psychometric data when the present study\nwas initiated and therefore the focus of our study.\nNotwithstanding the MQ being a relatively new measure, severalstudies have already used it to detect and map misophonia dueto individual differences in symptoms, and emotions and behav-iours. In general, studies report good internal consistencies withCronbach ’s alphas ranging from .75 to .90 across different\nnationalities and populations (e.g. Zhou, Wu, and Storch 2017 ;\nMcErlean and Banissy 2018; Daniels, Rodriguez, and Zabelina\n2020 ; Honarmand et al. 2019 ). The MQ has also been utilised to\nreport treatment effects in at least one study (McGuire, Wu, andStorch 2015). Importantly, the original study by Wu et al. ( 2014)\ndetailing the development and validation of the MQ did not testfor the stability of the measure over time and to our knowledge,no other study has evaluated this. This warrants an investigationof the test-retest validity the MQ.\nCross-cultural adaptations of questionnaires have clear advan-\ntages (e.g. time and cost savings) over developing new question-naires (Beaton et al. 2000) and additionally, by adapting an\nalready validated questionnaire into a new language, it more eas-ily enables comparisons of results from different studies. A\nguideline specifically developed for adapting questionnaires\nwithin the field of audiology was recently developed with theaim of proposing a good practice guide on the translation pro-cess and encouraging transparency in the process by publishingthe details of the process (Hall et al. 2018). The procedure pro-\nposed by Hall et al. ( 2018) is based on a synthesis of existing\nguidelines and involves a series of (six) steps involving prepar-ation, translation from source language to target language, back-translation, evaluation by a cross-disciplinary expert team, pilottesting and final evaluation and completion of the adapted ques-tionnaire. The process may thus be described as well-justified inaddition to being particularly thorough and it therefore used inthe present study.\nThe current study\nThe current study addressed a need by pedagogical hearing\ntherapists, and clinicians and researchers in Norway to have aself-report measure available for assessing the background,resulting emotions and behaviours, and degree and severity ofmisophonia. The tradition in Norway is for technical cliniciansworking with individuals with (suspected) misophonia to followTinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) protocols (Jastreboff, 2000 ),\neven if the evidence for this approach is not supported.Nonetheless, other audiological conditions may be differentiatedby using audiological evaluations (Ferrer-Torres and Gim /C19enez-\nLlort 2022), but the preferred is to use a self-report questionnaireto assess misophonia. To the best of our knowledge, those work-\ning with individuals with (suspected) misophonia in Norway\nhave no validated misophonia questionnaire available. Thus, the\naim of the present study was to adapt the MQ into Norwegian(i.e. MQ-NOR) using Hall and colleagues ’approach (Hall et al.\n2018 ), before submitting the MQ-NOR for a pre-validation;\ninvestigating the factor structure, internal consistency, and thetest-retest reliability. This is the first ever evaluation of the test-\nretest reliability of the MQ and provides a much-needed tool for\nassessing misophonia in Norway. Further, given the demon-\nstrated link between misophonia and neuroticism and research\ninterest in this relationship at the time of our study (e.g.Cassiello-Robbins et al. 2020 ; Daniels, Rodriguez, and Zabelina\n2020 ), this will be tentatively explored in our Norwegian sample\nof individuals with misophonia to provide even further evidence.\nMaterials and methods\nProcedure and participants\nData were collected through an online survey and participants\nwere recruited through five audiology clinics and via social\nmedia (e.g. Facebook groups). To be able to participate in the\nstudy, participants had to be between 18 –67 years and have (or\nsuspect to have) a complaint of misophonia. A detailed descrip-\ntion of the experience and symptoms of misophonia was\nincluded in the participant study information, to ensure uni-\nformity in the understanding of the term (i.e. “Do you feel frus-\ntration or anger when someone else eats, breathes or makesother repetitive sounds? Do you avoid meals with friends or fam-\nily or lose concentration when someone else types on a key-\nboard? ”). The data were collected between February and March\n2021. Participants were asked to complete the survey on two sep-\narate occasions about two weeks apart (T1 and T2). The studyreceived approval from the Norwegian centre for research data\n(Norsk senter for forskningdata; NSD).\nA total of 227 participants (84.1% female) completed the sur-\nvey at T1 and 173 (83.2% female) completed the survey at T2.The average age was 37.7 years ( SD¼11.6). The average age for\nfemales was 37.5 ( SD¼11.3) and for males 39.1 ( SD¼13.2).\nTwenty-six participants receiving treatment for misophonia at\neither T1 and/or T2 were excluded from the test-retest analysis\nto avoid any confounding treatment effects.\nQuestionnaire translation\nThe step-by-step process proposed by Hall et al. ( 2018 ) was used\nto adapt the MQ (Wu et al. 2014 ) into Norwegian. In the prep-\naration phase, permission was received from the developers of\nthe MQ for the adaption of the questionnaire into Norwegian. In\nthe next step, two forward translations were produced, one by aprofessional translator and one by a pedagogical hearing therap-\nist. An external reviewer, who is also a pedagogical hearing ther-\napist with expertise in misophonia, then consolidated thesetranslations. In the back-translation step, a third translator, a\nNorwegian-English bilingual with clinical experience in peda-\ngogical hearing therapy, performed a back-translation of the con-\nsolidated questionnaire. In the next step, the back- and\nconsolidated-forward translations were compared to the originalMQ and any discrepancies were discussed and resolved by a\nreview committee comprising the study authors. Finally, in the\nlast two steps, four individuals with self-reported misophonia\ntest-piloted the Norwegian adaptation and feedback on the last2 E.-A. LARSEN ET AL."

See Supplementary Appendix A and\nA1for further details and the translation protocol.\nMeasures\nParticipants completed a Norwegian version (MQ-NOR) of the\nMisophonia Questionnaire (Wu et al. 2014 ). Items on the\nMisophonia Symptom Scale are rated on scale from Not at all\ntrue (0) to Always true (4), while items on the Misophonia\nEmotions and Behaviours Scale are rated on a scale from Never\n(0) to Always (4). The two scales are summed to get the Total\nScore Scale (possible score range: 0 /C068). The single item\nMisophonia Severity Scale is originally rated on a scale from\nMinimal (1) to Very severe (15), with scores of 7 or higher corre-\nsponding to clinically significant symptoms (Wu et al. 2014 ), but\nwe allowed participants to indicate if they thought they were not\nsound sensitive (0). Participants also completed the Neuroticism\nScale from the Big Five Inventory 20 (BFI-20), a short version of\nBFI-44 (Engvik and Clausen 2011 ). The Neuroticism Scale is\ncomprised of four statements (e.g. Is relaxed, handles stress well;I worry a lot) rated on a scale from Does not fit (1) to Fits per-\nfectly (7). After reverse scoring items, an average score is calcu-\nlated with values close to 7 reflecting a high degree of\nneuroticism. Internal consistency with Cronbach ’s alpha was\na¼.77.\nStatistical analyses\nThe factor structure of the MQ-NOR was investigated using\nexploratory factor analysis with an oblique factor rotation. Thecut-off for factor loadings was set at 0.30. Factor extraction wasdetermined by parallel analysis, inspection of the scree plot and\neigenvalues >1 (Kaiser 1960). The internal consistency of MQ-\nNOR was assessed with Cronbach ’s alpha using the following\ncut-offs: <.60 unacceptable; .60-.69 minimally reliable; .70-.79\nreliable, .80-.90 highly reliable and >.90 very highly acceptable\n(Cohen et al., 2017). Test-retest reliability was investigated by\nexamining (1) the exact agreement between items at T1 and T2,(2)/C201 response grade difference between T1 and T2, and (3)\nCohen ’s weighted kappa for categorical variables (i.e. individual\nquestionnaire items) and Intra Class Correlations (ICCs) for\nnumerical variables (i.e. MQ-NOR scales) using a two-way mixedmodel with absolute agreement. Cohen ’s weighted kappa criteria\nwere: .21-.40 fair; .41-.60 moderate; .61-.80 substantial; and /C21.81\nalmost perfect agreement (McHugh 2012), while ICCs <.50 was\nconsidered poor; .50-.75 moderate; .75-.90 good; and >.90 excel-\nlent (Koo & Li, 2016 ). Finally, ordinary least squares (OLS)\nregression analyses were used to examine the relationshipbetween the misophonia scales and neuroticism. The statistical\nanalyses were performed using IBM SPSS (Version 27) and\nJamovi (Version 1.6.15.0).\nResults\nDescriptive statistics\nThe sounds that participants were the most sensitive to (i.e. rated\nOften true orAlways true ) were people eating (77.3%) followed\nby nasal sounds (74.1%). Participants were the least sensitive toconsonant/vowel sounds (14.1%). The emotional or behaviouralresponses that participants engaged in most often (i.e. ratedOften orAlways ) were becoming annoyed (83.2%) followed by\nleaving the environment (56.3%), while becoming sad anddepressed (16.3%) and physically aggressive (3.5%) were the least\nexperienced emotional responses. Descriptive statistics for indi-\nvidual items are provided in Supplementary Appendix B and\nSupplementary Appendix C presents the MQ-NOR in\nits entirety.\nBivariate correlations showed that the Misophonia Total Score\nScale and the Emotions and Behaviours Scale were significantlyand strongly associated with the Severity Scale ( r¼.67 and r¼\n.62, respectively, ps<.001), while the association between the\nMisophonia Symptom Scale and the Severity Scale was moderate(r¼.34,p<.001).\nFactor analyses\nPrior to performing the exploratory factor analyses investigating\nthe underlying structure of items on the MQ-NOR, Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett ’s test of sphericity were exam-\nined to ensure the quality of the correlation matrix and sampling\nadequacy. KMO was acceptable (KMO ¼0.87), and Bartlett ’s\ntest of sphericity was significant, X\n2(136)¼1675, p<.001, sug-\ngesting that the data were suitable for factor analysis. Results\nshowed that a two-factor solution was the better fit to the data\nand together the factors explained 42.13% of the variance. Twoitems ( “People Eating ”and “Nasal Sounds ”) cross-loaded, but as\n“Nasal Sounds ”loaded more strongly on Factor 2 it was included\nin this factor, while “People Eating ”loaded equally on the two\nfactors. Despite this it was deemed more appropriate to include\nthis item in Factor 2 akin to Wu et al. ( 2014 ) rather than exclude\nthe item as it is a particularly salient symptom for patients withmisophonia (see Table 1 ).\nInternal consistency\nCronbach ’s alpha for the Misophonia Symptom Scale was a¼\n.81 and for the Misophonia Emotions and Behaviours Scale itwasa¼.88. The internal consistency of each scale remained (or\nwas marginally lower) if an item was dropped from the scale.\nCronbach ’s alpha for the Total Score Scale was a¼.88, which\nwas largely unchanged if an item was deleted.\nTable 1.

Weighted kappas were in the high moderate to sub-\nstantial range with values ranging from .56 (Verbally Aggressive)\nto .76 (People Eating) (see Table 2 ). ICCs were good to excellent\nwith ICCs ranging from .77 (Severity Scale) to .92 (Total ScoreScale) (see Table 3 ).\nRegression analyses\nNeuroticism showed statistically significant relation with the\nSymptom Scale, b¼.214; p¼.001, Emotions and Behaviours\nScale, b¼.356; p<.001 and Severity Scale, b¼.252; p<.001.\nThis suggests that participants more plagued by misophonia alsoreported a higher level of neuroticism. Further, results showed\nthat age was a significant moderator of the relationship between\nneuroticism and scores on the Emotions and Behaviours Scale, b\n¼.613; p¼.026, which suggest a stronger association in older\nrather than younger participants. The age by neuroticism inter-\naction effect on misophonia symptoms and severity, respectively,\ndid not reach statistical significance, nor did any of the genderby neuroticism interaction effects.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this study was to perform a pre-validation of theMQ-NOR, a Norwegian translation of the MQ (Wu et al. 2014),\nand to tentatively explore the association between the personalitytrait neuroticism and misophonia using our Norwegian sample.\nThe MQ-NOR is the first ever validated Norwegian misophonia\nquestionnaire and will be a valuable tool for audiologists, peda-\ngogical hearing therapists and other professionals working withindividuals with misophonia in Norway.\nWhen Wu and colleagues developed the MQ, they found that\nthree factors best described the questionnaire; the Symptom\nScale, the Emotions and Behaviours Scale and the Total Score\nScale (sum of other two scales; Wu et al. 2014 ). However, this\nfinding was not replicated in our study, which found only twofactors as did an Iranian validation study (Honarmand et al.\n2019 ). Items clearly loaded on one of two factors except for two\nitems (i.e. People eating and Nasal sounds) that had loadings\nexceeding the cut-off of .30 on both factors. It was decided to\ninclude both items in the Symptom Scale as both are commonlyreported (i.e. salient misophonia symptoms; Swedo et al. 2021 )\nand thus, despite the difference in the number of factors best\ndescribing the structure of the MQ, it is noted that each of our\nfactors comprise the same items as Wu ’s first two factors.\nInterestingly, Wu ’s third factor is the Total Score Scale (i.e. the\nsum of the Symptom Scale and Emotions and Behaviours Scale),\nwhich has an eigenvalue greater than one even though several\nitems have generally low factor loadings. Even if the present\nstudy did not find statistical evidence for a third factor (i.e. a\nTotal Score Scale), it makes intuitive sense to have a Total Score\nScale as an index of severity, breadth of trigger sounds and reac-\ntions. Regarding MQ-NOR inter-scale correlations, we foundsimilarly to Wu et al. ( 2014 ) a significant and strong association\nbetween the Total Score Scale and the Severity Scale, something\nthat indeed supports the utility of the Severity Scale as an index\nof severity even if it has not been validated against an (objective)\nalternative measure of severity and remains purely adapted fromthe NIMH Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Murphy, Pickar, and\nAlterman 1982 ) as described by Wu et al. ( 2014 ). This therefore\npresents an avenue for future research to address.\nFurther, our results demonstrate high internal consistency\nwith Cronbach ’s alpha above .80 for the Symptom Scale,\nEmotions and Behaviours Scale and Total Score Scale, respect-ively. This is reassuring and in accordance with other studies\nalso reporting good internal consistency statistics for the MQ\n(Daniels, Rodriguez, and Zabelina 2020 ; McErlean and Banissy\n2018 ; Wu et al. 2014 ; Zhou, Wu, and Storch 2017 ).

      "text": "test-retest analyses revealed at the more descriptive level that the\nmean exact agreement across items on the Symptom Scale and\nEmotions and Behaviours Scale was 60.9% (i.e. 17 items by 147participants). Further, for all items, more than 90% of partici-pants had /C201 grade difference between scores at T1 and T2,\nthat is, there was either no change in scores or only one grade\ndifference from for example, Not at all true (0) to Rarely true\n(1). Based on the statistical test-retest analyses, indices with\nCohen ’s weighted kappa and ICCs supported the stability of par-\nticipants ’responses over a period of 2 –3 weeks. This is the first\ntime the test-retest reliability of the MQ has been investigatedwith results indicating that the MQ-NOR may be reliably used\nover time, however, further investigations of the test-retest reli-\nability of the MQ using both clinical and non-clinical popula-tions are strongly encouraged.\nResults from our supplementary regression analyses con-\nfirmed our hypothesis of a positive relationship between miso-\nphonia and neuroticism. These findings are in line with previousresearch (e.g. C ¸olak et al. 2021 ) and now demonstrates this rela-\ntionship in a Norwegian sample of individuals with a complaint\nof misophonia. The moderation analyses revealed a stronger rela-\ntionship between neuroticism and misophonia emotion andbehaviour reactions in older participants than younger partici-\npants. A possible explanation for this might be related to the\nidea that misophonia trigger sounds tend to generalise over time,similar to a conditioned reflex (Edelstein et al. 2013 ). In adult-\nhood there may also be an increased awareness of the condition,\nwhich is often reported as a hidden and shameful condition to\nlive with. Thus, trigger reactions might promote more worry/ner-vousness and particularly reduce the ability to handle stress for\nthose higher on neurotic personality traits, which in turn might\nexacerbate the experience of misophonia in a system wheremisophonia and neurotic traits in essence feed into each otherover time. Taken together, our findings add to our understand-\ning of the relationship between misophonia, a condition within\ndecreased sound tolerance, and personality by demonstrating theimportance of patients ’age on this relationship, which has previ-\nously been shown in another related condition, namely, noise\nsensitivity where both age and gender was found to be importantin the relationship with personality (Shepherd et al. 2015 ).\nStrengths and limitations\nA clear strength of our study is the rigorous cross-cultural adap-\ntation of the MQ into Norwegian using the guidelines proposedby Hall et al. ( 2018 ). Another methodological strength is our\ntest-retest design and extensive test-retest analyses. However, our\nstudy has some limitations that should be mentioned. The pro-portion of males to females was unequal at around 1:5. Whilethis is regrettable, it is often the case and in the original MQ\nstudy by Wu and colleges ( 2014 ), a similar proportion of males\nto females was found. This may indicate that the populationwith a complaint of misophonia is higher among women than it\nis among men. Further, the participants were recruited via clinics\nand online fora, and the present study relied on participants whowere recruited online to self-report a complaint misophonia. It isthus not entirely clear if all participants in fact have misophonia\nor whether they may have confused this with sound over-respon-\nsivity generally, for example. But given the detailed descriptionof misophonia in the study information to participants, we have\ngood reason to believe in the participants ’self-report. This was\nalso confirmed in the rather high proportion of the sample (i.e.48.9%) who meet cut-off for clinically significant misophoniasymptoms. Finally, the present study did not include individuals\nwithout misophonia nor were other misophonia questionnairesincluded (as none were validated at the time), something that\nprevented a more extensive validation of the MQ-NOR. We\nstrongly encourage future studies to address these issues andadditionally, using clinical samples in this endeavour.\nConclusion\nThe present study has demonstrated, using a sample of individu-\nals with self-reported misophonia complaints, that the MQ-NOR\nhas adequate psychometric properties in terms of factor struc-ture, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. However,until the MQ-NOR has undergone more extensive validation, itshould be cautiously implemented as a measurement tool formisophonia in Norwegian clinics. Future studies should focus onthe psychometric validity of MQ-NOR using clinical samples andit would be of interest to probe the personality trait of neuroti-cism as a risk factor for misophonia.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors thank professional translator Eirin Svoldal, pedagogical\nhearing therapists Anne Kristine Grønsund, Charlotte Caspari andRagnhild Dalheim, who contributed to the translation process.
