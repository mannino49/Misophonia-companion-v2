Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is a sensory experi-\nence elicited by auditory and visual triggers, which so far received little attention from\nthe scientific community. This self-reported phenomenon is described as a relaxing\ntingling sensation, which typically originates on scalp and spreads through a person's\nbody.

The purpose of this study was to\nelucidate whether ASMR is associated with heightened levels of misophonia.\nMethods . The Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ) was administered to individuals\nreporting to experience ASMR and to age and gender matched controls.\nResults . Compared to controls ASMR group scored higher on all subscales of MQ\nincluding the Misophonia Symptom Scale, the Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors\nScale and the Misophonia Severity Scale.\nDiscussion .

Although misophonia is not\nformally recognized as a disorder, recent evidence suggests that clinical symptomatology\nof misophonia resembles that of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD; Schr√∂der, Vulink &\nDenys, 2013 ;Johnson et al., 2013 ;Schwartz, Leyendecker & Conlon, 2011 ;Wu et al., 2014 ).\nIndeed, an association between OCD and misophonia has been recently reported ( Wu et\nal., 2014 ;Zhou, Wu & Storch, 2017 ). Common features include aversive reactions such as\nheightened anxiety to specific triggers, avoidance or the need to complete compulsions.\nPeople who suffer from misophonia often find sounds such as eating, coughing or breathing\nextremely distressing. Such triggers often induce anger and anxiety as well as a strong\nautonomic arousal ( Kumar et al., 2017 ). There are large individual differences in terms\nof the severity of the symptoms ranging from minimal discomfort to extreme responses\nsuch as violent outbursts or self-harming ( Rouw & Erfanian, 2017 ). In more severe cases\nindividuals who suffer from misophonia may avoid situations where such triggers could be\nHow to cite this article Janik McErlean and Banissy (2018), Increased misophonia in self-reported Autonomous Sensory Meridian Re-\nsponse.

ASMR is a self-reported\nsensory phenomenon described by those capable to experience it as a tingling sensation,\nwhich originates on scalp and spreads down the spine to the limbs. This experience\nis elicited by certain auditory and visual triggers including whisper, crisp sounds and\npersonal attention ( Janik McErlean & Banissy, 2017 ;Fredborg, Clark & Smith, 2017 ;Barratt\n& Davis, 2015 ). ASMR is reported to be highly relaxing and enjoyable, drawing hundreds\nof thousands of people every day to YouTube channels dedicated to this phenomenon. For\ninstance, GentleWhispering, which is one of the most popular channels producing ASMR\ncontent has over one million subscribers and over 470,000,000 views (as of June, 2018).\nWhile ASMR sensations are described as pleasurable and relaxing ( Barratt & Davis, 2015 ;\nJanik McErlean & Banissy, 2017 ), many viewers of ASMR channels find certain sounds\nincluded in the videos distressing. This suggests that ASMR experience is a heterogenous\nphenomenon and that triggers commonly used in ASMR videos may result in vastly\ndifferent reactions. These anecdotal reports have been corroborated by recent findings. For\ninstance, although whispering is commonly reported to trigger pleasant tingling sensations\nit has also been reported as unpleasant in some circumstances ( Janik McErlean & Banissy,\n2017;Fredborg, Clark & Smith, 2017 ;Barratt & Davis, 2015 ). Interestingly, as much as\n25.3% of the ASMR-responders in Janik McErlean & Banissy 's study ( 2017) reported\n``eating sounds'', which are common misophonia inducers ( Wu et al., 2014 ;Zhou, Wu &\nStorch, 2017 ), to be unpleasant and uncomfortable. This trigger received by far the most\nnegative evaluation of all listed triggers including amongst others finger tapping, crinkly\nplastic and typing. This is in line with recent findings which showed that ``chewing sounds''\nwere among one of the least likely triggers to induce ASMR experience ( Fredborg, Clark &\nSmith, 2017 ). Interestingly, Rouw & Erfanian (2017) recently reported that a large portion\nof their misophonic participants (49%) also reported experiencing pleasurable tingling\nsensations induced by different sounds further suggesting a potential overlap between\nthe two phenomena. At the same time, Barratt, Spence & Davis (2017) found that 43%\nof ASMR self-reporters stated that they experience misophonia when provided with a\ndescription of the phenomenon.\nFurthermore, it has been suggested that misophonia and ASMR might represent two\nends of the same spectrum of sound sensitivity and that they may be linked to synaesthesia,\nwhich has been reported to be more common in ASMR-responders compared to general\npopulation ( Barratt & Davis, 2015 ). All these phenomena appear to share at least one\nsimilar characteristic\u0016namely, they all rely on the inducer\u0015concurrent relationship. In\nASMR human generated sounds induce pleasurable tingling sensation while a negative\nphysical and affective reaction is found in misophonia ( Wu et al., 2014 ;Zhou, Wu & Storch,\n2017;Edelstein et al., 2013 ).\nJanik McErlean and Banissy (2018), PeerJ , DOI 10.7717/peerj.5351 2/14"

To do so the Misphonia Questionnaire ( Wu et al., 2014 ), which consists of\nthree subscales\u0016the Misophonia Symptom Scale (MSS), the Misophonia Emotions and\nBehaviors Scale (MEBS), and the Misophonia Severity Scale\u0016was administered to a group\nof individuals reporting ASMR experiences and to age and gender matched controls.\nMATERIALS & METHODS\nThis study was conducted online and was approved by the ethical committee of Goldsmiths\nUniversity of London. Participants were first presented with information about the study.\nThey were also informed that the study is anonymous and that their participation is\nvoluntary and that they may withdraw at any point without any consequences. Participants\nwere requested to give electronic consent prior to commencing the study.\nParticipants\nThe sample included in the primary analysis included sixty four ASMR\u0016responders\n(40 female, 24 male; age MD28:81, SDD6.05, range: 18\u001538) and sixty eight controls\n(52 female, 16 male; age MD26:75, SDD11.20, range: 18\u001566). The two groups did\nnot significantly differ in terms of age [ t(104:395)D\u00001:326, pD:188] or gender\n[\u001f2(1;ND132)D3:047, pD:081). The ASMR sample was recruited via a Facebook site\ndedicated to ASMR (https://www.facebook.com/groups/ASMRGroup/). The following\ndescription of ASMR was provided: ``ASMR can be defined as a pleasurable tingling\nsensation which originates on scalp and spreads down the spine and through the whole\nbody and which is typically induced by certain sounds (e.g., turning pages, crinkly wrapping\npaper, finger tapping), watching someone perform repetitive mundane actions (e.g., folding\ntowels, going through items in a handbag), watching someone closely inspecting day-to-day\nobjects, hearing whisper, watching someone's hair being brushed or watching videos with\nvarious role plays (visit to a doctor, spa or a shop)''. All ASMR-responders confirmed\nthey experience ASMR based on this description. Participants recruited from the ASMR\nFacebook site who indicated they did not experience ASMR were excluded from the\nanalysis. Similarly, in order to avoid any potential misunderstanding and false positive\nanswers participants recruited among university students and acquaintances who reported\nto experience ASMR were also excluded from the primary analysis. Control participants\nwere recruited among acquaintances and student population and were either given credit\npoints, cash vouchers, or were entered into a prize draw. Participants were included in the\ncontrol group based on a negative answer to a question whether they experience ASMR,\nwhich was accompanied by the same aforementioned description of the phenomenon.\nMeasures\nThe Misphonia Questionnaire ( Wu et al., 2014 ) consists of three parts: the Misophonia\nSymptom Scale, the Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors Scale and the Misophonia\nSeverity Scale. Misophonia Symptom Scale (MSS) establishes whether a person experiences\nany sound sensitivities by asking participants to rate how much each statement describes\nthem on a 0 to 4 scale (0\u0016 not at all true , 4\u0016 always true) . This scale includes seven items\nJanik McErlean and Banissy (2018), PeerJ , DOI 10.7717/peerj.5351 3/14"

A score of 14 or higher\non this scale means that, on average, a participant scored greater than or equal to a score\nof \"2\" (\"sometimes\") for all questions and thus is treated as a cut-off score suggesting\na presence of misophonia as per Wu and colleagues ( 2014). An additional open-ended\nquestion was included where participants could add and rate another sound not listed in\nthe questionnaire. This question was not included in the computation of the final scores\nas many answers fell under the categories already included in the questionnaire.\nThe Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors Scale (MEBS) refers to emotional and\nbehavioural responses elicited by misophonia. It asks the participants to indicate how\noften their sound sensitivities lead to outcomes such as e.g., ``leave the environment to\na place where the sound(s) cannot be heard anymore'', ``actively avoid certain situations\nin anticipation of the sound'' or ``have violent thoughts`` on a 0 to 4 scale with 0 being\n``Never'' and 4 being ``Always.'' This scale contains ten items. An additional open-ended\nquestion was included where participants could write another response not listed in the\nquestionnaire. This question was not included in the computation of the final scores as\nmany answers fell under the categories already included in the questionnaire. Misophonia\nSymptom Scale and Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors Scale are summed to form the\nMisophonia Questionnaire Total score (MQ Total), ranging from 0 to 68.\nThe Misophonia Severity Scale is based on the NIMH Global Obsessive-Compulsive\nScale (NIMH GOCS; Murphy, Pickar & Alterman, 1982 ) which was modified to reflect\nthe misophonia symptoms ( Wu et al., 2014 ). Participants are asked to rate the severity of\ntheir sound sensitivity by choosing one of fifteen possible ratings (1\u0016minimal, 15\u0016very\nsevere.) A score greater than or equal to 7 indicates `moderate sound sensitivity' which\ninterferes with daily life and thus is treated as a cut-off for clinically significant symptoms.\nParticipants were asked to tick 0 if they had no sound sensitivity. This study was conducted\nonline.\nRESULTS\nScores on the Misophonia Questionnaire Total (MQ Total, Cronbach's alpha D.872)\nwere analysed using an independent samples t-test which revealed a significant group\ndifference [ t(130)D4:185, p\u0014:001, Cohen's dD0:73) with ASMR-responders scoring\nhigher ( MD24:09,SDD10:48) than controls ( MD16:80,SDD9:51; Fig. 1). To further\nelucidate whether this result was due to group differences on either the Misophonia\nSymptom Scale (Cronbach's alpha D.829), or the Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors\nScale (Cronbach's alpha D.874) a 2 (group: controls, ASMR-responders) \u00022 (subscales:\nMSS, MEBS) ANOVA was conducted. This revealed no interaction ( F(1;130)D:603,\npD:439,≈ãp2D:005) and a main effect of group [ F(1;130)D17:513;p\u0014:001,≈ãp2D:119]\nwith ASMR-responders scoring overall higher on both subscales ( MD12:05,SED:62)\ncompared to controls ( MD8:40,SED:60). In addition, 36% of ASMR-responders\ncompared to 22% non-responders scored 14 and above on the Misophonia Symptom Scale,\nwhich is treated as clinically significant misophonia symptoms. However, this difference in\nproportions between the two groups was statistically non-significant [ \u001f2(1;ND132)D1:74,\npD:186).\nJanik McErlean and Banissy (2018), PeerJ , DOI 10.7717/peerj.5351 4/14"

The results showed that ASMR-Responders scored higher\non the Misophonia Symptom Scale (MSS), which examines whether a person experiences\nsensitivity to sounds such as e.g., people eating or repetitive tapping. This suggests that\nASMR is linked to enhanced sound sensitivity relative to general population. In addition,\n36% of ASMR-Responders compared to 22% of non-responders scored 14 and above on\nthis subscale of the Misophonia Questionnaire, indicating that on average they scored\ngreater than or equal to a score of 2 (sometimes) for all of the symptom questions and\nthus a larger proportion of ASMR-Responders meet the criteria for misophonia diagnosis\nrelatively to the control sample. These results are more conservative than previously\nreported (43%\u0016 Barratt, Spence & Davis, 2017 ), which most likely reflects methodological\ndifferences employed in the two studies. At the same time, the prevalence rate of misophonia\nin the general population reported in this study is similar to the previously reported rates\namong university students (20%\u0016- Wu et al., 2014 ; 23.1%\u0016 Zhou, Wu & Storch, 2017 ).\nHowever, it is of note that the proportions of ASMR-responders and controls who meet\nthe criteria for misophonia diagnosis based on cut-off scores on this scale are not statistically\ndifferent.\nASMR-Responders also scored higher on the Misophonia Emotions and Behaviors\nScale, which measures emotional and behavioural responses to certain sounds that include\nactively avoiding certain situations in anticipation of the sound, having violent thoughts\nor becoming physically aggressive. This suggests that heightened sound sensitivity present\nin ASMR as indicated by elevated scores on the Misophonia Symptom Scale in this\ngroup is associated with more severe negative behavioural and emotional outcomes\nrelatively to control participants. In addition, ASMR-responders had increased scores on\nthe Misophonia Questionnaire Total (MQ Total) scale, which is calculated by adding the\ntwo individual subscales (MSS and MEBS) together.\nFurther, ASMR-responders had increased scores on the Misophonia Severity Scale,\nwhich suggests greater level of severity of sound sensitivity in this population compared to\ncontrols. 12.5% of ASMR-responders compared to 6% of the control sample reported 7\nor above on this scale, which is interpreted as clinically significant misophonia symptoms\nthat can interfere with normal functioning. Although twice as many ASMR-responders\nreported clinically significant misophonia symptoms relative to control participants in this\nstudy, this difference was statistically non-significant and overall, these percentages are\nmuch lower than previously reported prevalence rates in the general population which is\nquite perplexing (19.9%\u0016 Wu et al., 2014 ; 16.6%\u0016 Zhou, Wu & Storch, 2017 ).

Nevertheless, it is possible that these individuals also genuinely\nexperience this phenomenon. In order to establish whether this group (ASMR Non-Social\nMedia) showed a similar pattern of results to ASMR Social-Media recruited from the\naforementioned Facebook site dedicated to ASMR an additional analysis was conducted\n(see Supplemental Information 2). As the three groups had substantially more female than\nmale participants, and gender did affect some of the results in this extra analysis, only\ndata contributed by female participants is discussed. Current findings suggest that ASMR\nNon-Social Media scored significantly higher on MQ Total and overall on MSS and MEBS\ncompared to ASMR Social-Media and controls. However, the difference between ASMR\nSocial-Media and ASMR Non-Social Media was only marginally significant suggesting\nsimilar pattern of results across these two groups on overall scores. Results pertaining to\nthe prevalence of clinically significant symptoms based on the ratings on the MSS showed\nASMR Non-Social Media group to have a significantly higher proportion of individuals\nreporting clinically relevant symptoms compared to both controls and ASMR Social-\nMedia. With respect to the reported severity levels there was no difference between ASMR\nNon-Social Media and ASMR Social-Media. There was also no statistically significant\ndifference in prevalence rates in terms of the reported severity levels between ASMR\nNon-Social Media and ASMR Social-Media. Therefore, in general it appears that ASMR\nNon-Social Media and ASMR Social-Media show a similar pattern of results with respect\nto MQ Total, MSeverity and prevalence rates based on severity scores. They do, however,\nhave a much higher prevalence rate (70.8%) of clinically relevant symptoms based on MSS\nscores compared to ASMR Social-Media (35%) and controls (26%), which was found to\nbe statistically significant.\nTherefore, similarly to participants recruited through ASMR Facebook site individuals\nrecruited in a more systematic way who self-identified as experiencing ASMR also show\nincreased levels of misophonia compared to controls. Moreover, their misophonia appears\nto be even more pronounced compared to ASMR-Responders recruited through ASMR\ncommunity sites as evidenced by increased scores on all variables and a much larger\nproportion of them scoring within the clinically significant range on the MSS.\nAs the overall pattern of results with respect to misophonia was similar between ASMR\nSocial-Media and ASMR Non-Social Media it appears that the latter group may have\nconsistent experiences to those reporting ASMR from the social media community.\nHowever, in order to eliminate the possibility of a third variable accounting for this result\n(e.g., comorbidity with other conditions) a more thorough investigation controlling for\nsuch potentially confounding factors will need to be carried out in the future. The findings\nalso suggest that when recruiting participants in a more systematic way (university students\nand acquaintances rather than special interests groups) almost half of the sample reported\nJanik McErlean and Banissy (2018), PeerJ , DOI 10.7717/peerj.5351 9/14"

      "text": "ASMR experiences, suggesting that this phenomenon may be highly prevalent in the\ngeneral population. This could account for the huge popularity of the YouTube channels\nproducing ASMR content. However, as mentioned earlier, stricter verification methods\nwill need to be employed in the future in order to assess this claim.\nCurrent results may also suggest that while individuals who experience ASMR may have\nincreased overall levels of misophonia compared to controls, those who seek membership\nin online communities dedicated to ASMR may have lower levels of misophonia compared\nto individuals who experience ASMR but are either not aware of the phenomenon or do\nnot actively engage in such online communities. It is feasible that only those individuals\nwith moderate levels of misophonia would seek ASMR videos as they often include sounds\nwhich could also trigger misophonia in some ASMR-responders. However, as no questions\nregarding viewing habits were included in the questionnaire it is not possible to establish\nhow many of ASMR Non-Social Media group were previously aware of this phenomenon\nand whether they engage in watching ASMR videos. The latter was also not established in\ncase of the ASMR Social-Media group either. This shortcoming will need to be addressed\nin future research to gain better understanding of the obtained results.\nTaken together, the findings reported here of heightened misophonia symptomatology\namong individuals who report ASMR relative to controls are in line with previous\nsuggestions of a potential link between the two conditions ( Barratt & Davis, 2015 ;Janik\nMcErlean & Banissy, 2017 ;Fredborg, Clark & Smith, 2017 ;Rouw & Erfanian, 2017 ;Barratt,\nSpence & Davis, 2017 ). This further supports the notion that these two phenomena may\nindeed represent two ends of the same sound sensitivity spectrum and that they can co-occur\nin the same individuals. They also further suggest that there is a wide heterogeneity among\nASMR-responders in terms of the triggers, which in some may produce positive while\nin others may lead to negative physiological, emotional and behavioural outcomes. In\naddition, both phenomena have been linked with a strong physical response to triggers.\nMisophonia has been associated with increased autonomic activation indexed with heart\nrate and galvanic skin response ( Kumar et al., 2017 ). At the same time, pleasurable tingling\nsensation reported by ASMR-responders is the essence of ASMR experience ( Barratt &\nDavis, 2015 ). Interestingly, pleasurable reaction to music experienced as `chills' has also\nbeen linked to increased heart rate, electromyogram activity and respiration depth ( Blood\n& Zatorre, 2001 ). Therefore, phenomenologically ASMR and misophonia appear similar,\nhowever, objective measures need to be employed in the future to provide physiological\nevidence for the sensory experience reported by ASMR-responders.\nThese findings are also interesting in light of the suggestion that ASMR and misophonia\nappear to rely on similar inducer-concurrent mechanisms as synaesthesia ( Barratt & Davis,\n2015). Indeed, the prevalence rate of synaesthesia among ASMR-responders appears to\nbe greater compared to non-responders ( Barratt & Davis, 2015 ), although more strict\nverification methods need to be implemented to verify this claim. In addition, all three\nphenomena have been associated with abnormal brain connectivity ( Kumar et al., 2017 ;\nSmith, Fredborg & Kornelsen, 2016 ;Dovern et al., 2012 ), potentially suggesting shared\nmechanisms between misophonia, ASMR and synaesthesia. Specifically, compared to\ncontrols ASMR-responders at rest have been found to have less functional connectivity\nJanik McErlean and Banissy (2018), PeerJ , DOI 10.7717/peerj.5351 10/14"

      "text": "within the default mode network (DMN), increased connectivity between different sensory\nregions and reduced connectivity between the frontal lobes and regions involved in\nsensory and attentional processes ( Smith, Fredborg & Kornelsen, 2016 ). These findings\nhave been suggested to reflect diminished suppression of the multimodal experiences,\nwhich constitute the essence of ASMR. At the same time major theories postulate that\nsynaesthesia arises as a result of reduced inhibition from multisensory ( Grossenbacher &\nLovelace, 2001 ) and executive control brain areas ( Cohen Kadosh et al., 2009 ) to sensory\nregions. Misophonia has also been linked to abnormal functional connectivity. Specifically,\nit has been associated with increased activity in the anterior insular cortex (AIC), which has\nbeen linked to interoceptive ability and emotion processing ( Critchley & Harrison, 2013 )\nand enhanced functional connectivity between AIC and areas within the DMN suggesting\nthat misophonia entails enhanced focus on internal signals coupled with attribution of\nexaggerated salience to otherwise ordinary sounds ( Kumar et al., 2017 ). As no studies to\ndate examined the neural activity underlying ASMR sensation while it is being experienced\nit is not clear whether similar results to those obtained during misophonic episodes would\nalso pertain to this condition. It will be an important avenue to pursue in order to further\nexamine the links between the two conditions.\nCurrent results are also interesting in light of the reports of an association between\nmisophonia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety and depressive symptoms ( Wu\net al., 2014 ;Zhou, Wu & Storch, 2017 ) and findings suggesting potentially heightened\nlevels of psychological distress and increased levels of neuroticism among ASMR-\nresponders ( Janik McErlean & Banissy, 2017 ;Fredborg, Clark & Smith, 2017 ). However,\na more systematic examination of the relationship between ASMR, misophonia, OCD,\nanxiety and depression is needed. This would also allow to constrain the current results.\nSpecifically, in light of the findings suggesting a general pattern of comorbidity between\npsychiatric/clinical disorders ( Kessler et al., 2005 ;Kessler et al., 1994 ), controlling for other\nsymptoms/conditions (e.g., sensory sensitivity, OCD, depression, trauma) would allow\nto establish whether obtained results reflect a specific relationship between ASMR and\nmisophonia, or whether current results are a bi-product of potential relationships between\nASMR and other symptoms/conditions.\nAdditionally, as the current study uses a binary classification with respect to ASMR,\nexamining the degrees of relationship between ASMR and misophonia is limited. Employing\nrating scales measuring the intensity of ASMR would be an important next step as it would\nallow for more comprehensive examination of the relationship between ASMR and\nmisophonia and other conditions which also exist on a continuum.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, the current findings suggest increased levels of misophonia among individuals\nreporting ASMR relative to controls with respect to all subscales of the Misphonia\nQuestionnaire ( Wu et al., 2014 ) including Misophonia Symptom Scale, Misophonia\nEmotions and Behaviors Scale and Misophonia Severity Scale. These results are in line\nwith previous suggestions that ASMR and misophonia represent two ends of the same\nsound sensitivity spectrum ( Barratt & Davis, 2015 ).\nJanik McErlean and Banissy (2018), PeerJ , DOI 10.7717/peerj.5351 11/14"
