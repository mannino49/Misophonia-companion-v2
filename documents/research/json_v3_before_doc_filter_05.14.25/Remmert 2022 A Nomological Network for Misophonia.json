Individuals with \nmisophonia can experience profound distress and functional \nimpairment from their emotional, physical and behavioral \nresponses to these sounds (e.g., Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2014 ; \nBrout et al., 2018 ; Jager et al., 2020 ).\nFor the assessment of the multidimensional experience of \nmisophonia, Vitoratou et  al. (2021b)  developed a five-factor \nmodel scale known as the S-Five-E (Selective Sound Sensitivity \nSyndrome Scale - Experiences). The S-Five was constructed based \non the responses and feedback of a large sample of English-\nspeaking self-identified misophonic individuals, over four \nsampling waves. The resulting scale consists of 25-items \ncorresponding to five dimensions: (1) internalising appraisals  \nattributing blame for reactions to oneself (e.g., believing to be an \nunlikable or angry person), (2) externalising appraisals  blaming \nother people (e.g., believing others to be rude and inconsiderate), \n(3) perceived emotional threat  (e.g., feeling distress, trapped and \nhelpless), (4) having or fearing having verbal or physical outbursts , \nand (5) the impact  of misophonia on the ability to do things they \nwould like to do. Along with the main scale, the S-Five has a \nsupplementary trigger checklist (S-Five-T), which captures the \nemotional nature and intensity of the responses to sounds \n(Vitoratou et al., 2021b , 2022a ). The format of the S-Five-T allows \nthe researcher or clinician to modify the trigger sounds list and \nthe response types, in line with changes in the growing literature \non the field and individual presentations of the disorder. The five-\nfactor model of the S-Five has been replicated in a large sample \nrepresentative of the UK population ( Vitoratou et  al., 2022a ). \nExcellent psychometric properties have been shown for the scale \nin English ( Vitoratou et al., 2021b ) and Mandarin ( Vitoratou et al., \n2022b ), with cross-cultural replication of the five-factor model. A \nGerman translation, however, is still pending.\nTo our knowledge, the only genuine German questionnaire \nmeasuring misophonic symptoms is the Berlin Misophonia \nQuestionnaire Revised (BMQ-R; Remmert et  al., 2022 ). The \nBMQ-R reflects the proposed diagnostic criteria of misophonia by \nJager et  al. (2020) . However, the BMQ-R is a long and \ncomprehensive diagnostical instrument comprising 77 items. In \ncomparison, given the S-Five’s inductive scale construction approach and resulting five core dimensions of misophonia, this \nscale measures typical misophonic experiences in a more efficient \nmanner. Further, the S-Five allows to investigate the emotional \nnature and intensity of triggers. The strengths of the S-Five would \nthus certainly complement the measurement of misophonia in \nGerman samples. We  therefore see merit in providing a valid \nGerman translation of the S-Five and in utilizing the strengths of \nboth the S-Five and BMQ-R to investigate associations between \nmisophonic symptoms.\nAlbeit evidence for the construct validity of the BMQ-R and \nthe S-Five has been gathered, neither those two scales, nor any \nother misophonia questionnaire can be considered fully validated. \nThus, construct validation plays a principal role in developing \nmisophonia scales and in translating existing questionnaires. A \nwidely used method for corroborating construct validity is \nshowing evidence in line with nomological networks ( Cronbach \nand Meehl, 1955 ). In nomological networks theoretical \nassociations of constructs are to be empirically demonstrated and \nnew constructs (e.g., misophonic symptoms) are to be placed in \nthe proposed associational structure. To this end, hypotheses \nabout relationships between attributes which are measured by a \nnew instrument (e.g., the (German) S-Five) and convergent or \ndiscriminant constructs are formulated and tested. However, for \nrelatively new constructs, such as misophonia, there is few and \nlimited information on theoretical associations between \nconstructs (i.e., misophonic symptoms or experiences). This does \nnot imply the lack of a nomological network, but rather that it \nneeds to be explored gradually. This study is a first and partially \nexploratory attempt to develop such a nomological network. The \nremainder of this introduction presents the descriptive and \ntheoretical background for the development of the proposed \nnomological network of misophonia, followed by specific \nhypotheses and aims of the study.\nA reasonable starting point for a nomological network of \nmisophonic symptoms is the proposed diagnostic criteria put \nforward by Schröder et  al. (2013)  and revised by Jager et  al. \n(2020) . Based on a large sample of participants with misophonia, \nJager et al. (2020)  proposed five main symptom domains in their \ndiagnostic criteria for clinically significant misophonia: (1) \naversive emotional and physical reactions to sounds, with (2) \ninsight into the excessive and disproportional nature of \nresponses, (3) loss of self-control, (4) avoidance behavior, and (5) \nfunctional impairment. This description largely coincides with \nthe recently published consensus definition of misophonia"

Nevertheless, several of the symptoms \nreported in the literature are not covered by those symptom \ndomains, such as externalising and internalising appraisals as \ndescribed by Vitoratou et al. (2021b)  and Vitoratou et al. (2021a)  \nand misophonic beliefs as described by Rosenthal et al. (2021) . \nWe  therefore identified further symptom domains based on \nphenomenological similarities, and explored how these domains \nrelate to different nomological aspects of misophonia. \nRecognition of similar psychological processes (e.g., reactions to \nsounds or influences on reactions; Swedo et  al., 2022 ) and \nfunctions of symptoms (e.g., emotional regulation) is pivotal for \nthe broadening of main symptom areas. This means grouping \nsymptoms not necessarily by symptom type (e.g., a domain \nrelated to behavioral, cognitive, etc. symptoms), but rather by the \nfunction of the symptom (e.g., a domain for behavior used for the \nfunction of avoiding sounds or associated perceived threat, as \nseparate from a domain for behavior used for the function of \nemotion regulation).\nBased on the symptoms reported in contemporary \nmisophonia literature ( Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2014 ; Brout et al., \n2018 ; Potgieter et  al., 2019 ; Jager et  al., 2020 ; Vitoratou et  al., \n2021b ; Swedo et  al., 2022 ) we  identified five main symptom \ndomains: (1) misophonic appraisals, (2) misophonic emotional \nexperiences, (3) misophonia-specific dysregulation, (4) \nmisophonic avoidance, and (5) misophonic impairment. Critically, \nthese symptom domains serve to give the nomological network a \nbroader structure by clustering symptoms. In order to better \nunderstand this clustering attempt, the individual symptom \ndomains and their associated symptoms are described in further \ndetail below.\nMisophonic appraisals  encompass symptoms associated with \nthe subjective meaning or evaluation placed on or knowledge \nabout one’s own reactions to sounds and the circumstances in \nwhich they occur (i.e., attributional styles and clinical insight; \nVitoratou et al., 2021b ). These are meta-cognitive processes or \nbeliefs about misophonic symptoms, rather than thoughts in \nresponse to misophonia triggers. The initial item pool for the \nDuke Misophonia Questionnaire ( Rosenthal et al., 2021 ) included \ncognitive responses in the moment of triggers, but the items that \nwere retained after factor analysis seemed to relate more to the \nstate of urgency and intensity that occurs in that moment (e.g., “I \nwould do anything to make it stop, ” was retained), than to an \nappraisal of the situation (e.g., “They do not care how this sound \naffects me, ” was not retained). In the symptom severity composite \nscale of the DMQ, these cognitive responses clustered together \nwith other symptoms physical and emotion symptoms, not as a \nseparate “cognitive” factor. That is, cognitions relating to the \nanguish of the moment were part of a dimension of physical, \nemotional and cognitive distress, and cognitions relating to \nassumptions about the moment did not seem to be part of the \nlatent variable of misophonia symptom severity. We  therefore \nfocused this dimension on appraisals reflecting more general \nbeliefs about the meaning of their symptoms, rather than \nappraisals in the moment.The domain includes internalising and externalising appraisals \n(blaming for symptom experience; Rosenthal et  al., 2021 ; \nVitoratou et al., 2021b ) as well as clinical insight ( Jager et al., 2020 ; \nSwedo et al., 2022 ). Clinical insight included recognition of excess \nand recognition of disproportionality (e.g., see Jager et al., 2020 ). \nA broader definition of clinical insight includes the comprehension \nof one’s own symptoms (i.e., symptom coherence; e.g., Moss-\nMorris et al., 2002 ; Witteman et al., 2011 ). However, symptom \ncoherence is a characteristic that has not been studied in the \ncontext of misophonia yet and is thus entirely exploratory in \nour study.\nMisophonic emotional experiences  entail all immediate \nemotional and physical reactions and experiences to misophonic \ntriggers (i.e., anger, irritability, aggression, disgust, anxiety, and \ncorresponding physical symptoms). Note that aggression entails \ndifferent phenomenological aspects. We follow Buss and Perry \n(1992)  distinguishing anger related to aggression, verbal and \nphysical aggression as well as hostility. Physical reactions or \nsymptoms are clustered within this domain since physical \nsymptoms are part of the emotional misophonic response (i.e., \nautonomic stress response or emotional arousal; e.g., Edelstein \net al., 2013 ). Although it has been shown that physical symptoms \ncan be modelled as a separate misophonic factor (e.g., Dibb et al., \n2021 ; Rinaldi et al., 2021 ), we do not see the benefit in separating \nphysical reactions from the domain emotional experiences.\nMisophonic emotional experiences are to be distinguished \nfrom misophonia-specific dysregulation , which is defined as an \nextension of loss of self-control ( Remmert et  al., 2022 ) as an \nincapability to cope with emotional experiences as well as \nuncontrolled behavioral manifestations for elevated levels of \nemotional arousal and negative affectivity. This also means \ndisentangling various aspects of impaired self-control, including \nbehavioral dysregulation (e.g., verbal or physical aggression), \ncognitive, and emotional dysregulation (i.e., loss of control over \nemotional experiences; e.g., Swedo et al., 2022 ). This domain is a \ncategory into which failed coping attempts fit (e.g., Guetta et al., \n2022 ). It is not yet clear which domain the S-Five construct of \nperceived emotional threat  fits into, as it includes items related to \nexperiencing anxiety and distress, which may fit in the emotional \nexperiences domain, as well as items related to feeling trapped and \nhelpless (i.e., lack of regulative strategies to cope with misophonic \nexperiences), which may align with the dysregulation domain.\nMisophonic avoidance  includes dysfunctional behavioral \ncoping strategies to either prevent being exposed to misophonic \nsounds (anticipated avoidance) or escaping such situations \n(reactive avoidance; e.g., Remmert et al., 2022 ). Both avoidance \nbehaviors form part of the definition of misophonia ( Swedo et al., \n2022 ). Rosenthal et al. (2021)  showed that anticipated avoidance \nis the most prominent coping strategy before being faced with \ntriggers, whereas reactive avoidance is the most prominent coping \nstrategy when being triggered. Although avoidance behavior is a \ncoping strategy, it can be  distinguished from dysregulation \nbecause it serves the purpose of (re-)gaining control over the \nstimuli and is not the incapability to control emotional reactions."

Strong associations are indicated by black arrows, weaker associations are \ngrey, negative associations are blue with less negative associations in light blue, dashed arrows indicate uncertainty.\nIt may also include behaviors intended to prevent feared \nconsequences of emotional dysregulation.\nThe fifth domain is misophonic impairment , which entails \nsymptoms associated with the suffering and limitations caused by \nmisophonic experiences (e.g., Wu et al., 2014 ; Jager et al., 2020 ; \nSwedo et  al., 2022 ). Functional impact can be  assigned to life \ndomains or activities in which the impact occurs: e.g., cognitive \nimpact, social impact, and impact on daily routine ( WHO, 2001 ). \nFurther, this domain entails distress as a consequence of \nmisophonic symptoms including depressive mood and emotional \nburden (e.g., Jager et al., 2020 ; Remmert et al., 2022 ).\nNote that this clustering of symptoms into domains is \nintended to facilitate the investigation of misophonic symptoms, \nrather than a strict classification. The domains may thus naturally overlap in some characteristics, while grouping misophonic \nsymptoms reasonably. After having defined the broader structure \nof the nomological network, the following section outlines \ntheoretical, empirical, and exploratory assumptions about how the \nspecific symptoms are associated with each other, both within and \nacross symptom domains (see Figure  1 ). Since there are 190 \npossible correlations between symptoms, we  pragmatically \nconcentrated on the core nomological structure, which \npredominantly involves symptoms being measured by the S-Five \n(indicated in grey boxes in the network in Figure 1 ). This is also \ndue to the fact that the German S-Five is the focus of the presented \nstudies. The proposed assumptions on associations are drawn \nfrom both misophonia research and the broader literature on \nmental disorders."

      "text": "Remmert et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.902807\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.orgAssociations in the nomological network\nPrincipally, we expect that misophonic symptoms, regardless \nof their proposed symptom domain, are significantly positively \nassociated with each other. This is based on the understanding that \nthese symptoms together constitute the higher-order construct of \nmisophonia and are hence naturally associated with each other, \nwhich is widely empirically supported (e.g., Rinaldi et al., 2021 ; \nRosenthal et al., 2021 ; Vitoratou et al., 2021a ,b, 2022a ,b; Remmert \net al., 2022 ). Moreover, misophonic symptoms within the proposed \nsymptom domains are expected to be strongly associated since they \nare identified on account of sharing common characteristics and \nfunctions. Any exceptions to these two principles, as well as specific \nhypotheses about associations between symptoms from different \nsymptom domains, are outlined in the following sections. An \nadditional principle of our validation approach is that explicit \nconvergent measures (i.e., measures that exactly measure the same \nsymptom) are assumed to correlate strongly.\nMisophonic appraisals\nMisophonic attributional styles (internalising and \nexternalising appraisals) have been shown to correlate \nmoderately with each other ( Vitoratou et  al., 2021b ), which \nwe  assume to replicate in this study. Beyond this, the \nrelationships of interest for misophonic appraisals are with \nclinical insight (i.e., recognition of excess and disproportionality, \nand symptom coherence), functional impact and distress, as well \nas misophonia-specific aggressive behavior (S-Five outbursts).\nIndividuals with misophonia often recognize that their \nbehavior is excessive or disproportionate to the situation \n(Hadjipavlou et al., 2008 ; Jager et al., 2020 ; Swedo et al., 2022 ). \nAlthough the relationship between attributional styles and \ndimensions of clinical insight have not been investigated yet for \nmisophonia, it is reasonable to assume that those recognizing their \nreactions as excessive or disproportionate would be more likely to \nattribute blame to themselves (internalising) than to other people \n(externalising). Critically, these relationships have been \nsubstantiated for psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia; Cotton \net  al., 2012 ) and neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., autistic \nspectrum conditions; Didehbani et al., 2012 ). We therefore expect \na higher correlation between recognition of excess or \ndisproportionality and internalising appraisals compared with \nexternalising appraisals. Further, it has been found that a good \nunderstanding of the nature and cause of obsessive–compulsive \nsymptoms (i.e., symptom coherence) is associated with internal \nattributions, but not with external, environmental attributions \n(Pedley et al., 2019 ). Based on this, we likewise expect individuals \nwith higher levels of symptom coherence for misophonic \nsymptoms to be  less likely to blame themselves, and instead \nunderstand that the source of the problem is not the individual, \nbut the condition of misophonia itself. Thus, a negative correlation \nis expected between misophonic symptom coherence and \ninternalising appraisals and a less negative or non-significant \ncorrelation with external appraisals.Another characteristic of internal attribution is that it is \nstrongly associated with depression, distress and daily impact, \nwhereas external attribution has been shown to be less strongly \nassociated (e.g., Peterson et al., 1981 ; Hu et al., 2015 ), which has \nalso been shown for misophonia ( Vitoratou et  al., 2021b ). \nWe  therefore expect strong associations to emerge between \nmisophonic distress symptoms and functional impact with \ninternal appraisals, but substantially less with external appraisals.\nFinally, regarding the relationship with misophonia-specific \naggression (outbursts), the original validation of the S-Five \n(Vitoratou et  al., 2021b ) found that the outbursts factor was \nmoderately correlated with internalising and externalising \nappraisals. Surprisingly, outbursts were more strongly correlated \nwith internalising than with externalising appraisals and both \nappraisal factors had low positive correlations with anger reactions \nto trigger sounds. While other research indicates that anger, \naggression, and aggressive behavior are more frequent in those \nwho blame others than themselves for their reactions (e.g., Averill, \n1983 ; Quigley and Tedeschi, 1996 ), this appears to be have been \nthe case with misophonia ( Vitoratou et al., 2021b ). We anticipate \nthat both types of appraisals will be associated with higher levels \nof anger, aggression, behavioral dysregulation, and outbursts. \nSince irritability shares common emotional characteristics with \nanger and aggression (e.g., Stringaris, 2011 ) we assume it will also \nbe associated with internalising and externalising appraisals.\nMisophonic emotional experiences\nMisophonia can cause a strong physical reaction ( Edelstein \net al., 2013 ; Kumar et al., 2017 ), which is most strongly associated \nwith emotional reactions ( Rosenthal et  al., 2021 ). Accordingly, \nstrong correlations between emotional misophonic responses (i.e., \nanger, aggression, irritability, disgust, and anxiety) and physical \nsymptoms are assumed. Whilst anxiety may co-occur in \nmisophonia, it is different in the psychological process compared \nto other emotional reactions (i.e., anger, aggression, irritability, and \ndisgust). Anxiety is a rather anticipatory emotion caused by \nperceived threat whereas anger and related emotions (aggression \nand irritability) as well as disgust are rather reactive emotions \ncaused by violations of personal needs, integrity or boundaries. For \nmisophonia, anger is the most prominent reactive emotion whereas \nanxiety, if present, is rather anticipatory (e.g., Jager et al., 2020 ). \nSince anxiety is different from other emotional reactions in some \nfeatures and does not necessarily need to co-occur, it is assumed to \ncorrelate lower (but still moderately) with other emotional reactions.\nMisophonia-specific dysregulation\nAs experiencing anger, aggression and irritability when \nconfronted with sounds might manifest in behavioral dysregulation \nsuch as aggressive outbursts (e.g., Swedo et  al., 2022 ), these \nsymptoms are particularly expected to correlate. Likewise, \nbehavioral dysregulation and outbursts are likely to be related to \nfunctional impact, with this behavior naturally contributing to \nsocial conflicts and negative consequences in daily life ( Wu et al., \n2014 ).

Cronbach’s α \nestimates are in parentheses on the main diagonal. The depicted correlations are rounded. All correlations are significant at p < 0.01.linked to the concept of threat as measured by the S-Five, which \nincludes experiences of feeling trapped and helpless (i.e., \nexpressions of dysregulated threatening emotions). Experiencing \nthreat is conceptually and empirically related to anxiety and \nheightened autonomic arousal (i.e., physical symptoms; Vitoratou \net al., 2021b ) and therefore expected to be associated with anxiety \nand physical symptoms. Moreover, threat entails aspects of failed \navoidance strategies in the sense that threat emerges when triggers \ncannot be avoided. We expect that experiencing threat motivates \nincreased avoidance behavior in order to circumvent the feared \nconsequences of being triggered. Thus, positive associations \nbetween threat, anxiety and avoidance strategies are expected. \nThreat has further been shown to be  strongly correlated with \nfunctional impact ( Vitoratou et al., 2021b ) and is likewise expected \nto cause significant distress in individuals’ lives.\nMisophonic avoidance\nExperiencing threat and anxiety is generally associated with \npronounced avoidance behavior causing significant distress and \nsocial isolation ( Abramowitz et  al., 2019 ). Considering the \nfrequent reports of both anxiety and avoidance behavior in \nmisophonia ( Wu et al., 2014 ; Jager et al., 2020 ; Swedo et al., 2022 ), \nwe assume that perceived threat, anxiety and avoidance behavior \nwill be strongly correlated. Avoidance behavior can also contribute \nto the maintenance of symptoms (e.g., Spinhoven et al., 2017 ) and \npoor treatment outcomes, thus elevating symptom burden (e.g., \nWheaton et al., 2018 ). Hence, we assume strong associations with \nfunctional impact.\nMisophonic impairment\nMost of the associations for symptoms from this domain have \nalready been described in the previous sections. In summary, all \nmisophonic symptoms being measured by the S-Five except for \nimpact (i.e., externalising appraisals, internalising appraisal, \noutbursts and threat) are expected to highly correlate with \nsymptoms from the domain misophonic impairment.\nAssociations with symptoms of \nother mental disorders and traits\nTo further explore the extension of the nomological \nnetwork, we also investigated associations between the S-Five and S-Five-T scores with related psychological constructs. In \nparticular, anxiety sensitivity, which is a relatively stable trait \nfear of arousal-related sensations ( Hovenkamp-Hermelink \net al., 2019 ), has been shown to be related to misophonic \nsymptoms ( Cusack et al., 2018 ; McKay et al., 2018 ; Schadegg \net  al., 2021 ). Higher anxiety sensitivity was found to \nstrengthen the relationship between misophonia and \naggression ( Schadegg et al., 2021 ). Cusack et al. (2018)  found \nthat the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and \nmisophonia was partially mediated by obsessive–compulsive \nsymptoms. An association between obsessive–compulsive \nsymptoms and misophonia has also been reported elsewhere \n(Wu et  al., 2014 ; Erfanian et  al., 2019 ; Jager et  al., 2020 ). \nMisophonia has been associated with symptoms of depression \n(Erfanian et al., 2019 ), particularly in relation to internalising \nappraisals and impact ( Vitoratou et al., 2021b ). This fits with \nthe notion that internal attributional appraisals are strongly \nassociated with depression and distress ( Hu et  al., 2015 ). \nTherefore, we assume high correlations between internalising \nappraisals and impact, and depressive symptoms. The \nassociations between anxiety sensitivity, obsessive–\ncompulsive symptoms and misophonic symptoms are \nexploratory because the associations with misophonia have \nonly been shown for overall misophonic symptoms. However, \nexperiencing threat when confronted with sounds entails \naspects of anxiety and heightened arousal (see Misophonia-\nspecific dysregulation), so it is likely that threat is associated \nwith higher levels of anxiety sensitivity.\nHypotheses\nWe expect to find equivalent psychometric properties for \nthe German S-Five compared with the original version. \nSpecifically, we hypothesize configural invariance between \nGerman-speaking and English-speaking populations, high \ninternal reliability and high stability in time (>0.75  in \nagreement coefficients). We further expect to find similar \nintercorrelations between symptoms measured by the S-Five \ncompared to the original validation study ( Vitoratou et al., \n2021b ), which are outlined in Table  1 . In relation to the \nnomological network, we  outlined our hypotheses in the \npreceding section and summarize them in Table 2 ."

Data protection \nguidelines were met and participants gave informed consent \nbefore completing the surveys. The studies were approved by the \nEthics Committee at the Department of Education and Psychology \nof the Freie Universität Berlin, Germany (document number: \n029/2020) and by the PNM Research Ethics Panel, King’s College \nLondon (RESCM-19/20-11,826).\nIn study 1, we  further administered items assessing \nparticipants’ attention in line with DeSimone et al. (2015)  and \nchose 80% correct answers as an inclusion cut-off. To check for \naberrant response behavior we calculated a response pattern index \nas proposed by Meade and Craig (2012)  excluding participants \nwith more than 30% consecutive equal answers. The first study \naimed at the evaluation of the dimensionality of the S-Five. Forero \net al. (2009)  suggested a sample size of N > 200–500 for using latent \ntrait models for ordinal data using the WLSMV estimator. \nWe collected data from 952 individuals, of which N = 639 (67.12%) \ncompleted the S-Five and met the inclusion criteria. For study 2, \nwe recruited 322 participants, of which N = 235 (73.0%) met the \ninclusion criteria and completed at least the S-Five. The second \nstudy focused on the translation of the S-Five-T complementary \ntrigger checklist along with providing a confirmation dataset for \nthe factor structure of the S-Five scale and evaluating stability.\nBoth studies were conducted using social media platforms in \nGermany (e.g., Facebook and Instagram) as well as university \nmailing lists. Groups with individuals identifying as having \nmisophonia as well as unspecific recruitment groups and groups \nwith individuals suffering from any form of impaired hearing or \ndisorders related to hearing (e.g., tinnitus, hyperacusis, etc.) were \nincluded in the sampling frame. The recruitment language was \nGerman. As an incentive participants could participate in a lucky \ndraw for 10 × 5 Euro Amazon voucher and psychology students \nreceived course credit. In the second study motivation was \nprovided in terms of a lucky draw for 25 × 20 Euro amazon \nvouchers. A test-retest study was conducted two to 4 weeks later.\nTranslation procedure\nThe translations of the scales from their respective language \n(i.e., Polish or English) to German was conducted by applying the \nTRAPD procedure ( Harkness, 2003 ). TRAPD is an acronym for \nthe following steps ensuring the quality of questionnaire \ntranslation: translation, review, adjudication, pretesting, and \ndocumentation. Two translators, who are fluent or native speakers \nof the respective languages, independently translated the items of \neach scale. The translated items were then reviewed with the \ntranslators and authors of the study (three of whom are German \nnative speaker and fluent in English). Objects of the review were \ncontent, wording, and authenticity (i.e., evaluation of how natural \nor native the translation is) of the items. In this part, alterations of \nitems were implemented if indicated.Measures\nAll measures are described in detail below. For both studies, \nthree scales measuring aspects of misophonia were administered: \nS-Five, BMQ-R, and MisoQuest.\nFor study 1, non-misophonia specific scales were \nadministered, each with its instructions contextualized for the \nrespondent to answer in relation to misophonia. At the \nbeginning of the study, participants were asked to think about \nthe sounds that bothered them most or, if not applicable, about \ntypical misophonic sounds (i.e., eating, swallowing, and \nsniffing) and were instructed to consider either the presence or \nimpact of those sounds in relation to each scale. For instance, \nwe  added the accessory sentence: “[…] when you  are \nconfronted with bothersome sounds. ” This procedure aimed at \nminimizing between-person variability and within-person \ninconsistency due to thinking about different contexts when \ngiving a response and thus aimed at increasing validity (cf. \nLievens et al., 2008 ). The scales contextualized for misophonic \nsounds in study 1 were the Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), \nBrief Irritability Test (BITe), State–Trait Inventory for \nCognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA), Difficulties in \nEmotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Noise Avoidance \nQuestionnaire (NAQ), Brief Experiential Avoidance \nQuestionnaire (BEAQ), World Health Organization Disability \nAssessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0), Illness Perception \nQuestionnaire Mental Health (IPQ-MH). Note that items from \neach instrument were administered randomly in blocks. For \nthe BMQ-R, items from each symptom area were presented in \nrandomized blocks (see Remmert et al., 2022 ).\nFor study 2, non-misophonia-specific scales were not \ncontextualized for misophonia, because we aimed at investigating \nassociations with adjacent clinical constructs not only limited to \nmisophonic contexts. Further, the three constructs are not \ndescribed as misophonic symptoms, so it is not reasonable to \ncontextualize them accordingly. These were the Anxiety Sensitivity \nIndex 3 (ASI-3), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and the \nDimensional Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (DOCS). Additionally, \nthe S-Five-T was included in study 2, but not in study 1. For the \nS-Five, the order of questions (five S-Five items per question), and \nthe order of item presentation in each question were randomized. \nAnswering the S-Five-T trigger checklist was optional and \nparticipants were given the opportunity to skip to the following \nsection after each trigger sound presented. This was done to \nminimize the potential distress and discomfort experienced when \nreading about misophonic triggers. Moreover, participants were \nrandomly evenly allocated to either the BMQ-R or MisoQuest. \nThe order of presentation for the BMQ-R items was randomized, \nas well as the order of the PHQ-9, DOCS, and ASI-3 thereafter. \nThe three non-misophonia scales were optional. The links for the \ntest-retest were sent out two to 4 weeks after initial participation \nin the survey. The follow-up survey contained the S-Five, S-Five-T, \nand basic demographic data such as a unique participant \nidentification number and age."

Items are rated on an \n11-point rating scale (0 = not at all true to 10 = completely true). A \nsupplementary trigger checklist, the S-Five-T, consists of 37 \nmisophonic triggers and both the emotional response (e.g., anger \nand disgust) and the intensity (from 0 to 10) of the response to \ntriggers. Three indices can be derived: Trigger Count (i.e., number \nof triggers; TC), Frequency/Intensity of Reactions Score (i.e., total \nvalue of the intensity of triggers; FIRS), Relative Intensity of \nReactions Score (i.e., intensity of reactions relative to the number \nof triggers; RIRS). The German and English S-Five can be found \nin the Supplementary material .\nThe Berlin Misophonia Questionnaire Revised (BMQ-R; \nRemmert et al., 2022 ) is a multidimensional diagnostical instrument \nfor measuring misophonic symptoms. It consists of 15 symptom-\noriented scales (excluding scales on anticipated reactions to sounds) \nwhich can be assigned to their corresponding diagnostic criteria by \nJager et al. (2020) . The scales have been shown to be reliable with \nMcDonald’s ω ranging from.72 to.94. Results from latent variable \nmodels as well as correlations with convergent and discriminant \nmeasures give substantive evidence regarding construct validity. In \ntotal, 67 items were used, which are rated on a 6-point rating scale \n(0 = does not apply at all to 5 = completely applies).\nMisoQuest1 (Siepsiak et al., 2020 ) is a unidimensional self-\nreport instrument of misophonia with 14 items, rated on a 5-point \nLikert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). The \ninstrument was translated from Polish into German.\nEmotion states and dispositions\nThe Aggression Questionnaire (AQ; Buss and Perry, 1992 ) \ncomprises four dimensions: (1) physical aggression, (2) verbal \naggression, (3) anger and (4) hostility with 29 items being rated \non a 4-point rating scale (1 = does not apply to 4 = fully applies). \nWe used the German version of the Aggression Questionnaire \n(Werner and von Collani, 2004 )2 in an optimized version for the \nmeasurement of misophonia (see Remmert et al., 2022 ).\nThe Disgust Propensity and Sensitivity Scale Revised3 \n(DPSS-R; Cavanagh and Davey, 2000 ) reduced-item version \n(Fergus and Valentiner, 2009 ), is a measure of disgust \nencompassing the dimensions disgust propensity and disgust \nsensitivity. The items measure the frequency of physical and \nemotional symptoms of disgust which are rated on a 5-point \nrating scale (1 = never to 5 = always). For this study, only the \ndisgust propensity (DP) items were used (six items), which \n1 Translated and reproduced with permission from the test authors.\n2 Reproduced under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution \nLicense (CC BY-NC 4.0).\n3 Translated and reproduced with permission from the test authors.measure how easily an individual is repulsed.

Only the two trait scales were used for the present study, \nwhich capture a predisposition to experience anxiety in response \nto certain types of stressors, namely cognitive (10 items) and \nsomatic (11 items) stressors. The items are rated on a 4-point \nrating scale (1 = not at all to 4 = very much so). The instrument was \ntranslated from English into German and optimized for the \nmeasurement of misophonia (see Remmert et al., 2022 ).\nThe Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI-3; Taylor et  al., 2007 ) \nconsists of 18 items that assess anxiety sensitivity, that is fear of \nanxiety-related sensations. It consists of three subscales: physical, \ncognitive, and social concerns. Responses are given on a 5-point \nrating scale from 0 = do not agree at all to 4 = fully agree. The \nGerman version was developed by Kemper et al. (2011) .\nThe Brief Irritability Test4 (BITe; Holtzman et al., 2015 ) is a \n5-item measure of irritability in the last 2 weeks.

There are four categories of concerns: \ncontamination, responsibility for harm, unacceptable thoughts, \nand “just right” concerns (denoted as symmetry). For each \ncategory there are five questions (rated from 0 to 4), asking about \ntime occupied, avoidance behaviors, associated distress, functional \nimpairment, and resistance to obsessions and compulsions. The \nGerman version by Fink-Lamotte et al. (2020)5 was used.\nThe Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke et al., \n2001 ) is a 9-item measure of symptoms of depression.

It comprises 25 items of \nwhich 10 items describe specific situations that might be avoided. \nThe remaining 15 items refer to specific behaviors related to sound \navoidance. The more behavior-oriented items were chosen which \nare rated on a 5-point rating scale (1 = never to 5 = very often/\nalways). We  could not obtain the German items, so that the \nEnglish items were translated. Since the statements are short and \nconcise, we do not expect compromising effects due to translation, \nhowever, we optimized the item selection for the measurement of \nmisophonia (see Remmert et al., 2022 ).\nThe Brief Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire (BEAQ; \nGámez et al., 2014 ) is a 15-item measure of avoidance behavior. \nFor this study, items from the original Behavioral Avoidance \nsubscale of the German version ( Böge et al., 2020 )7 were relevant \nas they reflect situational avoidance of physical distress. Items are \nrated on a 6-point rating scale (1 = strongly disagree to \n6 = strongly agree).\nImpairment\nThe World Health Organization Disability Assessment \nSchedule 2.08 (WHODAS 2.0; Üstün et  al., 2010 ) is a clinical \ninstrument based on the International Classification of \nFunctioning, Disability and Health (ICF; WHO, 2001 ) which \nmeasures the impact of a given health condition in six domains of \nlife: Cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities, and \nparticipation. Since mobility and self-care appear to be irrelevant \nfor misophonia, these domains were not administered. The \nGerman self-report 36-item version (27 items after discarding the \ntwo domains) was optimized for the measurement of misophonia \n(see Remmert et al., 2022 ). Items are rated regarding the extent of \ndifficulty individuals have doing the presented activities using a \n5-point rating scale (1 = none to 5 = extreme or cannot do).\nClinical insight\nIllness Perception Questionnaire Mental Health (IPQ-MH; \nWitteman et  al., 2011 ) is an adapted version of the Illness \nPerception Questionnaire Revised (IPQ-R; Moss-Morris et al., \n2002 ) measuring an individual’s perception of their mental health \nproblem. Only the coherence subscale (five items), measuring the \nextent of an individual’s understanding of their mental health \nproblem, was used for this study. The items are rated on a 5-point \nrating scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree), with a \nhigher score indicating more symptom coherence. The German \nversion of the IPQ-R9 (Gaab et al., 2008 ) was used and adapted in \nline with Witteman et al.

There was one item from the coherence \nsubscale of the IPQ-R that was removed from the scale for the \nfinal version of the IPQ-MH (“the symptoms of my condition are \npuzzling to me”). We included it in our survey as it had appeared \nin the German version of the IPQ-R and after initial psychometric \nexamination showed a good fit, we  retained the item in \nthe measure.\nStatistical analyses\nThe subscales of the S-Five were jointly modelled in a \nconfirmatory factor analysis (CFA) according to the specified \nmeasurement model by Vitoratou et  al. (2021b) . Therefore, \nwe specified a correlated first-order factor model. Measurement \nmodels of the validation instruments were specified according to \nthe original factor structure, but sometimes with an optimized set \nof items which adequately fit the measurement of misophonia (see \nRemmert et al., 2022 ). For the DERS scales we specified an S•I-1 \nmodel ( Eid et  al., 2017 ) with one item as the reference item \n(general dysregulation) and the other items as specific factors \n(dysregulation facets), which is different from the original. This \nprocedure allows us to investigate associations of misophonic \nsymptoms with general dysregulation and its facets rather than \nwith the facets alone.\nNon-normality and categorical indicators were taken into \naccount using the weighted least square mean and variance \nadjusted (WLSMV; Muthén et al., 1997 ) estimator with ordered \ncategories. For the S-Five (continuous indicators) we  used \nmaximum likelihood estimation with robust (Huber-White) \nstandard errors ( Huber, 1967 ; White, 1980 ). Item omissions were \naddressed using full information maximum likelihood estimates.\nModel fit was evaluated by using absolute and relative fit \nindices. Namely, the exact relative χ2 (that is the ratio of the χ2 over \nthe degrees of freedom) with values ranging from 2 ( Hoelter, 1983 ; \nUllman, 2001 ) to < 5 ( Wheaton et al., 1977 ; West et al., 2012 ) \nindicating adequate fit ( Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003 ), the Root \nMean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA) with values \nclose to 0.06 indicating adequate fit ( Hu and Bentler, 1999 ), the \nStandardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) with values \nclose to 0.08 indicating good fit ( Hooper et al., 2008 ), McDonald’s \nCentrality Index (Mc) close to 0.90 ( Hu and Bentler, 1999 ); as well \nas Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) \nclose to 0.97 ( Schermelleh-Engel et al., 2003 ). The Expected Cross \nValidation Index (ECVI) was used to compare non-nested models \n(Browne and Cudeck, 1989 ).\nThe multiple indicator multiple causes model (MIMIC; \nJoreskog and Goldberger, 1975 ; Muthén, 1979 ) was used to assess \nmeasurement invariance in relation to gender and age. An item \nwas regarded as non-invariant when the effect of the exogenous \nvariable (age or gender) on the item directly (hereafter direct effect \nor de) was statistically significant.\nInternal consistency was estimated with model-based \nMcDonald’s ω (McDonald, 1999 ).

ICC values > 0.75 are interpreted as good \nreliability, according to Koo and Li (2016) .\nCorrelations were interpreted in line with Cohen (1988) ; i.e., \nr = |0.10|, r = |0.30|, r = |0.50| are considered weak, moderate and \nstrong, respectively. Differences between correlations were \nstatistically compared using Fisher’s z-test of dependent \ncorrelation or between an empirical and a hypothesized \ncorrelation ( Fisher, 1956 ). We applied Bonferroni correction to \nsignificance-level α in order to address α-error inflation due to \nmultiple testing ( Bonferroni, 1936 ) and further decided to be as \nconservative as possible, thus correcting for all calculated \ncorrelations per study. In study 1 we calculated 820 correlations \nand therefore α = 0.00006 and for study 2 we  calculated 465 \ncorrelations and therefore α = 0.0001. Additionally, we corrected \nfor hypothesized correlation comparisons. For the 17 comparisons \nin study 1 α = 0.0029 and for the 17 comparisons in study 2 \nα = 0.0029. Ten comparisons between independent samples were \ntested using Fisher’s z-test of correlations in two independent \nsamples ( Fisher, 1956 ) with a corrected α = 0.005. Note that due to \ndropouts (respectively pairwise complete analyses) the sample \nsizes of dependent comparisons between correlation may vary \nwithin both studies, so we always selected the smallest overlapping \nsample size and still counted all comparisons within each study to \nadjust alpha-inflation, which is the most conservative method. \nThe statistical software of Stata 16 ( StataCorp, 2019 ), Mplus 8 \n(Muthen and Muthén, 1998-2017 ), and the “lavaan” package \n(version 0.6-9; Rosseel, 2012 ) in R ( R Core Team, 2017 ) were used \nto carry out the analysis.\nResults\nDescriptive indices\nIn sample 1 with N = 639, most participants (86.2%) were \nfemale, and two individuals indicated non-binary gender. The \nmean age was M = 34.28 years (SD = 11.52, range 16 to 69). \nApproximately one-third (32.7%) were students. Further, \none-third of the sample had a university degree and 46.7% had at \nleast a college entrance qualification. A majority had a partner or \nwas married (65.1%), whereas 33.9% did not have a partner or was \nliving separated. Almost a third of the sample (30.3%) was either \npart-time or marginally employed, 37.3% was full-time employed, \nand 13.3% unemployed. About half of the sample (47.5%) fulfilled \nthe diagnostic criteria by Jager et al. (2020)  (with 24.6% having \nsevere symptoms) as classified by the BMQ-R.10 According to the \n10 Fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria was determined by proving if \neach criterion is fulfilled. A criterion was considered as fulfilled if the mean \nof the respective symptom scale was greater than 3 (i.e., greater than the \nmean of the response scale, meaning self-reported approval of the items). \nFor severe symptoms, the fulfillment cutoff was set to 4. Note that this S-Five total score cut-off (i.e., total score of 87 or higher; cf. \nVitoratou et al., 2022a ), more than half of the sample (57.4%) had \nsignificant misophonia.\nIn sample 2, with N = 235, the majority of participants was \nfemale (85.1%), with two participants identifying as non-binary. \nThe mean age was 35.8 years (SD = 11.8, range 19 to 80). The \nmajority of the sample (95.3%) reported living in Germany or \nanother German-speaking country (Germany 86.0%, Austria \n5.5%, Switzerland 3.0, 5.9% rest of world). In terms of educational \nattainments, 6.4% had up to high school, 47.7% reported having \ndone apprenticeships, 26.8% undergraduate degree, 14.5% \npostgraduate degree, and 4.7% doctoral or similar. Significant \nmisophonia as indicated by the S-Five total cut-off was observed \nfor 58.3% of the sample.\nStructural validity and measurement \ninvariance\nThe five-factor correlated model showed adequate fit to the \ndata in both the first [ χ2(265) = 850.93, p < 0.001, rel. χ2 = 3.21, \nCFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.07 [0.06–0.07], SRMR = 0.05, \nMc = 0.55, ECVI = 1.87] and the second sample [ χ2(265) = 452.15, \np < 0.001, rel. χ2 = 1.71, CFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.06 \n[0.05–0.06], SRMR = 0.05]. An outline of the estimated model in \nsample 1 is shown Figure 2 .\nMeasurement invariance was explored with respect to \ngender and age, each adjusted for the other and the levels of \nthe five factors. In sample 1, five items were directly affected \nfrom age but with negligible effect sizes (INT01: de = −0.018, \np = 0.017; INT02: de = −0.020, p = 0.005, INT04: de = 0.020, \np = 0.042, IMP03: de = 0.032, p = 0.001, IMP02: de = 0.670, \np = 0.017). Two items were also affected from gender adjusted \nfor age and the five misophonic dimensions of the misophonic \nexperience (INT05: de = 0.698, p = 0.001; OUT03 de = 0.670, \np = 0.017), with however less than one unit of effect on a 0 to \n10 scale. Similar results emerged in the second sample, with \nthree significant effects emerging for either age (INT02: \nde = −0.037, p = 0.002, INT04: de = −0.034, p = 0.007, OUT04: \nde = −0.032, p = 0.017) and gender (EXT01: de = 1.001, \np = 0.013; IMP01: de = 1.068, p = 0.002; IMP03: de = 1.588, \np < 0.001), with low magnitudes in either case.\nAn alternative bifactor S-1 model ( Eid et al., 2017 ) was \nalso fitted as from a theoretical perspective, the outburst \nfactor comprises both verbally as well as physically aggressive \nbehaviors. The bifactor S-1 model maintains a general \noutburst factor but takes the implied two-dimensionality of \noutbursts into account. The model was specified with \nphysically aggressive behavior as the reference facet (G-factor) \nand verbally aggressive behavior as the specific factor yielding \nscheme was not empirically derived, but chosen pragmatically because \nthere is no empirical criterion to determine the fulfillment of the criteria."

In each section, we  first describe associations within the \nrespective symptom domain followed by associations between different \ndomains and associations with symptoms of other mental disorders \nand traits. We additionally report associations between misophonic \ntrigger scores and between S-Five scales and overall misophonic \nsymptoms at the end of this section. An updated version of Figure 1  \ndepicting the empirical nomological network can be found in Figure 4 .\nMisophonic appraisals\nInternalising and externalising appraisals were moderately to \nhighly positively correlated ( Table 3 ). For internalising appraisals, \nthe correlations with recognition of disproportionality and excess \nwere higher than the moderate correlations emerging with \nexternalising appraisals ( p < 0.0029 for all four comparisons; \nTable 4 ). Coherence of misophonic symptoms (IPQ-MH), i.e., the \nlevel of comprehension regarding misophonic symptoms, \nmoderately negatively correlated with internalising appraisals, \nwhereas externalising appraisals were not significantly associated \nwith symptom coherence and were further less negatively correlated \ncompared to internalising appraisals ( p < 0.0029; Table 5 ).\nFor both externalising and internalising appraisals, we found \nstrong positive correlations with anger and irritation reactions in \nboth samples ( Table 4 ). Hostility, verbal and physical aggression, \nall of which are part of the definition of aggression (AQ), were \nfound to be mainly moderately correlated with internalising and externalising appraisals, except for hostility and internalising \nappraisals where we found a high correlation ( Table 5 ). Irritability \n(BITe) emerged to correlate highly with both appraisal styles, \nhowever, stronger with internalising appraisals ( p < 0.0029; \nTable  5 ). This pattern could also be  partly shown for the \nassociation with behavioral dysregulation (BMQ-R; Table 4 ) in \nstudy 1 ( p < 0.0029), but not for study 2 ( p = 0.013), and for \noutbursts in study 2 ( p < 0.0029; Table  3 ), but not for study 1 \n(p = 0.014). However, for difficulties in impulse control (behavioral \ndysregulation; DERS) we found no correlations with misophonic \nappraisal styles ( Table 5 ). We further found associations between \ninternalising and externalising appraisals and functional \nimpairment in different life domains: social interactions, \nparticipation in society, cognition, daily routines, and household \n(WHODAS 2.0; Table  5 ). Internalising appraisals were most \nstrongly correlated with impairment in social interaction, society \nand cognition, whereas externalising appraisals were significantly \nlower but still moderately correlated with impairment in different \nlife domains ( p < 0.0029), except for impairment in household \n(p = 0.0170) and impairment in daily routine ( p = 0.004). Further, \nmisophonic distress and functional impairment (BMQ-R) were \nstrongly correlated with internalising appraisals, but relatively \nlower with externalising appraisals in study 1 ( p < 0.0029; Table 4 ), \nbut not for study 2 ( p = 0.054 and p = 0.455, respectively). \nWe  further found lower correlations between externalising \nappraisals and impact (S-Five) compared to internalising \nappraisals in study 1 ( p < 0.001), but not for study 2 ( p = 0.146).\nAnxiety sensitivity (ASI-3) moderately correlated with \ninternalising appraisals and; Table  3  descriptively lower with \nexternalising appraisals ( Table  6 ). The highest correlation was \nfound for the cognitive facet of anxiety sensitivity with \ninternalising appraisals, whereas the lowest (not significant) \ncorrelation emerged between the physical facet of anxiety \nsensitivity and external appraisals. Notably, the obsessive–\ncompulsive facets contamination and unacceptable thoughts of \nthe DOCS were positively weakly to moderately correlated with \nboth misophonic appraisal styles showing no descriptive \ndifference in the magnitude. The facets responsibility and \nsymmetry were weakly or not correlated with misophonic Table 3 Means and standard deviations, latent (Study 1) and Spearman’s (Study 2) intercorrelations, and reliability estimates for the S-Five.\nMeasure Min–MaxStudy 1 Study 2\nEXT INT IMP OUT THR\nM SD M SD\n1.

Also, general dysregulation \n(DERS; BMQ-R; Tables 4  and 5) was highly correlated with \noutbursts and threat, whereas difficulties in impulse control \n(behavioral dysregulation; DERS) when controlled for general \ndysregulation was not significantly correlated with any S-Five \nmeasure ( Table 5 ). As expected, emotional dysregulation (BMQ-R) \nwas highly correlated with threat, but emotional dysregulation \nwhen controlled for general dysregulation (DERS) was not \nsignificantly associated with threat. Notably, we also found a strong \nassociation between cognitive dysregulation (BMQ-R) and threat.\nBesides correlations within the domain misophonia-specific \ndysregulation, threat was very strongly associated with misophonic \nanxiety (BMQ-R) as well as cognitive and somatic anxiety \nsymptoms (STICSA). Likewise, physical misophonic symptoms \nwere strongly associated with threat. In line with predictions about associations with avoidance behavior, we found high correlations \nbetween threat and reactive and anticipatory avoidance (BMQ-R), \nnoise avoidance (NAQ), and behavioral avoidance (BEAQ).\nSymptoms within the domain misophonic impairment were \npredominantly strongly associated with threat. For example, impact \n(S-Five) as well as distress and functional impact (BMQ-R) \ncorrelated strongly with threat in both samples ( Table  4 ). Also, \nspecifically impairment in society and social interaction (WHODAS \n2.0) were strongly associated ( Table  5 ), whereas impairment in \ncognition, daily routine and household were moderately correlated. \nLikewise, strong associations between outbursts and impact \n(S-Five), functional impact and distress (BMQ-R), as well as \nimpairments in social interaction (WHODAS 2.0) were observed. \nModerate associations emerged for outbursts and impairment in \nhousehold, daily routine, and society (WHODAS 2.0).\nDepressive symptoms (PHQ-9) were moderately associated \nwith both threat and outbursts ( Table 6 ). For anxiety sensitivity \n(ASI-3), we found low to moderate associations with threat and \noutbursts, descriptively being slightly higher for threat than for \noutbursts. Obsessive–compulsive thoughts (DOCS) were \nmoderately associated with threat and outbursts, whereasother \nOCD symptoms were not significantly correlated.\nLow to moderate correlations emerged with anxiety sensitivity \n(ASI-3), depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), and some obsessive–\ncompulsive traits: unacceptable thoughts and symmetry (DOCS), \nbut not with contamination and responsibility ( Table 6 ).Table 4 Means and standard deviations, latent (Study 1) and Spearman’s (Study 2) intercorrelations, and reliability estimates of the BMQ-R \nsymptom part, and MisoQuest.\nMeasure Study 1 Study 2\nM SD Min–\nMaxEXT INT IMP OUT THR ω M SD Min–\nMaxEXT INT IMP OUT THR ω\nBMQ: Anger 13.42 5.74 0–20 0.59 0.60 0.58 0.74 0.72 0.90 12.22 6.95 0–20 0.62 0.63 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.92\nBMQ: Irritation 15.39 4.18 0–20 0.59 0.59 0.67 0.58 0.81 0.77 14.08 6.15 0–20 0.60 0.54 0.60 0.56 0.75 0.90\nBMQ: Disgust 10.27 6.50 0–20 0.46 0.38 0.38 0.40 0.52 0.92 10.56 6.79 0–20 0.63 0.69 0.50 0.63 0.59 0.91\nBMQ: Anxiety 6.19 6.01 0–20 0.41 0.49 0.63 0.48 0.77 0.88 7.17 6.19 0–20 0.54 0.52 0.73 0.63 0.75 0.87\nBMQ: Physical 7.26 4.87 0–15 0.50 0.62 0.64 0.64 0.81 0.85 8.47 4.81 0–15 0.53 0.54 0.69 0.67 0.76 0.83\nBMQ: R.

Simply \nsummarized, all S-Five scales were expected to be  strongly \nassociated with misophonic impairment symptoms. We found \nhigh correlations for all S-Five scales with functional impact and \ndistress (BMQ-R; Table  4 ), except for a moderate correlation \nbetween distress and externalising appraisals in the second study. \nFurther, impairments in different life domains (WHODAS 2.0) \nwere moderately to strongly associated with all S-Five scales. \nHowever, impairments in household (compared to other life \ndomains) emerged to correlate descriptively lower with all S-Five \nscales on average (see Table 5 ).\nImpact was further moderately correlated with depressive \nsymptoms (PHQ-9), cognitive symptoms of anxiety sensitivity \n(ASI-3) and obsessive–compulsive thoughts (DOCS; see Table 6 ). \nLow correlations were observed for social and physical symptoms \nof anxiety sensitivity and obsessive–compulsive symmetry \nsymptoms. Other obsessive–compulsive symptoms were not \nsignificantly correlated with impact.\nAssociations with symptoms of other mental \ndisorders and traits.\nThe correlations of the five reaction counts (irritation, distress, \ndisgust, anger, panic, physiological response) and the three \nS-Five-T indices (TC, FIRS, RIRS) with the S-Five factors, the \nBMQ-R, ASI-3 and DOCS scores are presented in Table 6 .\nThe number of triggers (TC) selected from the 37 sounds \nlist was strongly correlated with all S-Five dimensions \n(r > 0.50 in all cases). Correlations of similar magnitude emerged \nwith the MisoQuest total score, the BMQ-R scales of misophonic \nanger, irritation, disgust, physical reactions, behavioral dysregulation, reactive avoidance, and functional impairment. \nThe strongest correlation emerged with misophonic disgust \nreactions and, unexpectedly, the lowest with distress (both \nBMQ-R). However, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) correlated \nmoderately high. Low or non-significant coefficients emerged \nwith anxiety sensitivity (ASI-3) and obsessive–compulsive \ntraits (DOCS).\nFor the FIRS index very strong correlations with the total \nS-Five, the total MisoQuest and the BMQ-R disgust reaction scale \n(r > 0.70) emerged. Further, all S-Five factors were highly \ncorrelated with the FIRS index. Moderate to moderate high were \nalso the correlations between FIRS and the rest of the BMQ-R \nsubscales. Further, we observed moderately high correlations with \ndepressive symptoms (PHQ-9). As in the case of the TC, low or \nnon-significant coefficients emerged for most anxiety sensitivity \n(ASI-3), and most obsessive–compulsive traits (DOCS). However, \nmoderate correlations were observed for cognitive anxiety \nsensitivity and unacceptable thoughts. Similar patterns emerged \nfor the RIRS index, even though coefficients were descriptively \nsomewhat smaller in all cases.\nWith respect to the reaction counts (RC), RC-Irritation did \nnot show significant correlations with any of the scales.\nRC-Distress was moderately to moderately low associated \nwith most scales. The strongest correlations appeared between \ndistress and the S-Five outburst factor and the total MisoQuest. \nDistress was not found to be  significantly correlated with all \nBMQ-R scales, with social anxiety sensitivity (ASI-3) and the \nDOCS scales. Interestingly, externalising appraisals was the only \nS-Five subscale which was not significantly correlated with \nRC-distress.\nRC-Disgust also did not relate with most of the subscales \nconsidered. An exception was the moderate correlation with \ndisgust reaction (BMQ-R)."

RC-Panic also \ncorrelated moderately with the BMQ-R anxiety reaction scale \nwhile moderately low correlations emerged with the BMQ-R \nscales of physical reactions, recognition of excess,  anticipatory \navoidance, distress, and functional impairment, however, these \nassociations were not significant when considering Bonferroni-\ncorrection. RC-Panic did not correlate with the other BMQ-R \nscales. Low but non-significant correlations emerged between \nRC-Panic and PHQ-9, all ASI-3 factors apart from the social \nfactor, and with the DOCS thought factor.\nFinally, the RC-Physiological did not correlate with the S-Five \nfactors or the total MisoQuest. Moderate correlations emerged \nwith the BMQ-R scales of physical and anxiety reactions, reactive \nand anticipatory avoidance, distress, and functional impairment, \nhowever, these associations were not significant when considering \nBonferroni-correction. Low but non-significant correlations \nemerged between the RC-Physiological and the total PHQ-9, and \nthe contamination scale of the DOCS. The only significant \nassociations were found between RC-Physiological and the ASI-3 \ntotal as well as the ASI-3 cognitive and social subscale.\nAssociations with overall misophonic \nsymptoms (S-Five).\nOverall misophonic symptoms (MisoQuest) strongly \ncorrelated with each of the S-Five subscales with externalising \nappraisals being lowest correlated and threat being highest \ncorrelated (see Table 4 ). The scales were further strongly associated \nwith general sound intolerance symptoms (BMQ-R; r > 0.60).\nDiscussion\nThe presented studies aimed at providing a rigorous and valid \nGerman translation of the S-Five. We thus presented a thorough \nexamination of the reliability and construct validity by specifying \nmeasurement models and introducing a nomological network \nwhich delineates associations between misophonic symptoms.\nOur results demonstrate a good fit of the five-factor model to \nour data in both samples when using the translated S-Five items, \nemerging a similar fit to the English version ( cf., Vitoratou et al., \n2021b ). However, some misspecifications were identified which \nneed further investigation in future studies. We  therefore \npresented a promising, alternative model, which incorporates a \nbifactor S-1 measurement model for misophonic outbursts. This \nhas three advantages: the model (a) fits better to the data (even \nwhen penalizing for more parameters), (b) provides a clearer interpretation of different aspects of outbursts, and (c) preserves \na general outburst factor with a clearer interpretation. Besides the \ngoodness of fit of the factorial structure, we  investigated \nmeasurement invariance regarding gender and age. Based on \nfindings of minor effects, we conclude that the German S-Five \nitems do not function differentially due to gender and age, and \ntherefore structural differences of the scores can be assessed.\nWe also demonstrated excellent internal consistency in both \nsamples and high test–retest reliability for the five factors. As an \ninterim conclusion, these results reveal two main properties of the \nGerman S-Five: a) highly reliable measurement and b) factorial \nvalid conclusions when applying these scales. Another striking \nresult is the mostly replicated correlation pattern between S-Five \nfactors with medium to strong intercorrelations. Unexpectedly, \nthe factors were in general higher correlated than in the original \nvalidation study. Interestingly, threat is highly correlated with each \nof the four remaining factors, especially with impact. Further, \nthreat was comparably higher correlated with internalising \nappraisals and outbursts than other factors. We argue that these \nare beneficial properties of the threat scale, however, users of the \nS-Five should keep the small differences in the correlative pattern \nin mind when administering the German version. Initial evidence \non the construct validity was shown through high correlations \nwith measures of overall misophonic symptoms, however, this \ndoes not allow to disentangle which misophonic symptoms are \ncorrelated with the S-Five scales. Therefore, we developed the \nnomological network of misophonic symptoms.\nConstruct validity and the nomological \nnetwork\nTo our knowledge this is the first study that begins to explore \na formal and comprehensive nomological network for misophonic \nsymptoms. Recent developments of misophonia instruments, \nwhich emphasize a more symptom-oriented measurement \n(Rosenthal et al., 2021 ; Remmert et al., 2022 ) and the German \ntranslation of the S-Five provide the basis to scrutinize the \nproposed nomological network with five broader symptom \ndomains, in which the symptoms are proposed to be clustered. \nThese domains are misophonic appraisals, misophonic emotional \nexperiences, misophonia-specific dysregulation, misophonic \navoidance, and misophonic impairment. Our aims were to \nexplicitly provide evidence for the construct validity of the \n(translated) S-Five as well as giving a deeper insight into the \nassociations of misophonic symptoms.\nWe found strong evidence for the construct validity of \ninternalising and externalising appraisals in the misophonic \nappraisals domain. Internalising appraisals were strongly associated \nwith the recognition of the excessive and disproportionate nature \nof the reactions and furthermore higher correlated with these \ndimensions of clinical insight than externalising appraisals. This \naligns with similar findings from other mental disorders (e.g., \nCotton et al., 2012 ; Didehbani et al., 2012 )."

We  had also expected the relative difference between \ninternalising and externalising appraisals in their relationship with \ncoherence (with externalising appraisals not being correlated) but \nhad not anticipated these negative correlations across all factors. \nThese relationships were in the opposite direction to those between \nthe S-Five and variables about awareness of the disproportionate and \nexcessive nature of reactions, indicating that awareness of these \naspects is not the same as having a good understanding of the \nproblem. So, what we  labelled as “insight” on the nomological \nnetwork is a reflection of awareness that misophonic symptoms are \nindeed a problem, but not necessarily insight into the problem. This \nfinding was consistent with research finding that OCD severity is \nnegatively associated with problem coherence ( Pedley et al., 2019 ). \nFurther research is needed to test possible explanations for this. \nPerhaps the simplest understanding of this relationship is that \nmisophonia is easier to make sense of when it is less severe. It is also \nimportant to consider that there could be a causal relationship in the \nother direction. That is, it is possible that as one’s understanding of \nthe problem of misophonia improves, their symptoms decrease. Lack \nof an explanation for the problem may be, in fact, part of the \nproblem. Our cross-sectional correlative study does not allow us to \ndraw any conclusions about causality. Future research would \ntherefore benefit from testing problem coherence as a potential \nmechanism of change for misophonia. This would make sense for \ninternalising in particular, which is characterized by a felt sense that \nthe individual with misophonia is reacting this way to sounds \nbecause of some deeper character flaw, being a bad or angry person \nunderneath. It thus makes sense that as one comes to understand a \ntheory that misophonia is a decreased sensory tolerance problem \nshared by many and shaped by our experiences, that their previous \ntheory of “bad character” loses its credibility.\nBesides associations within the domain misophonic appraisal, \nwe also found evidence for construct validity through associations \nbetween internalising and externalising appraisals with symptoms \nfrom other domains. For example, we found that both appraisal styles \nwere at least moderately associated to anger, aggression, irritability, \nand behavioral dysregulation and outbursts, which is in line with \nprevious findings on these appraisal styles ( Vitoratou et al., 2021b ). \nConsidering general psychological theories of appraisals and their \nassociations with anger and related constructs (e.g., Averill, 1983 ) it is \na rather contradicting result, but there seems to be a difference for \nmisophonia, which has been replicated in our studies. Further studies \nshould consider investigating the role of appraisals for experiencing \nmisophonic anger, aggression, and potential outbursts. An \nunpredicted result was the non-significant correlation between \ndifficulties in impulse control (behavioral dysregulation) and \nappraisals, which does not support our hypotheses on appraisals. \nNote that we also found mixed results for comparing associations of \nexternalising and internalising appraisals with outbursts and \nbehavioral dysregulation, which do neither support equally high \nassociations nor higher associations with either appraisal style. \nFurther research should investigate these relationships in depth.Lastly, we  observed medium to strong associations with \ndifferent symptoms from the domain misophonic impairment, \nwhich were almost all higher for internalising appraisals than for \nexternalising appraisals. Only the association between the S-Five \nscale impact was equally high for internalising and externalising \nappraisals in our second study, which contradicted our hypotheses \non the associations with impact. Furthermore, we found depressive \nsymptoms to be equally moderately correlated with both appraisal \nstyles. Thus, our results show evidence that both appraisal styles \nmight be associated with impact on lives of affected individuals as \nwell as with respective depressive symptoms. We strongly suggest \ninvestigating how both appraisal styles are associated with \nmisophonic impairment exploring possible explanatory variables.\nWithin the domain of misophonic emotional experiences \nwe  found strong evidence for our hypothesis that physical \nsymptoms of misophonia are strongly associated with all \nemotional symptoms, which again replicates the results from past \nstudies (e.g., Rosenthal et  al., 2021 ). While we  found strong \nassociations between explicitly convergent measures of the same \nemotional reaction, we  found strong evidence against our \nhypothesis that anxiety is differently related to other misophonic \nemotional reactions. Especially in the second study almost all \nassociations between anger, irritation, disgust and anxiety were as \nhigh as the associations among anger, irritation and disgust, \nrespectively. Mind that due to the small sample size in study 2, \ninterpretations should be made cautiously. However, the findings \nof study 1 also support the conclusion that anxiety is not weaker \nassociated with all other emotional reactions. Although Jager et al. \n(2020)  see anxiety reactions as a subordinate misophonic \nsymptom, others have pointed out that anxiety is a crucial \nsymptom (e.g., Swedo et  al., 2022 ). Our findings give further \nevidence that anxiety is strongly related to other emotional \nreactions and hence a paramount emotional symptom to \nbe considered when investigating misophonia.\nFor the validation of the S-Five the domain misophonia-\nspecific dysregulation plays a particularly important role since two \nscales were assigned to this domain: outbursts and perceived \nthreat. As expected, outbursts and threat were strongly associated \nnot only among each other but with different facets of misophonia-\nspecific dysregulation. Outbursts were predominantly strongly \nrelated to convergent measures of behavioral dysregulation and \nthreat was strongly related to emotional dysregulation. We further \nfound strong associations with threat and anxiety and physical \nsymptoms, which replicate findings from the original validation \nstudy ( Vitoratou et al., 2021b ). Both threat and outbursts were \nexpectedly strongly associated with symptoms from misophonic \nimpairment, especially with functional impact, distress, and \nimpairment in social interaction.\nInterestingly, we found an exploratory association of threat \nwith symptom coherence. Regarding the possible impact of lack of \ncoherence on an increased sense of emotional threat, which \nincludes feelings of being trapped, helpless and distress, it also \nmakes sense that one might experience a greater sense of these in \na moment where their initial reactions do not make sense to them,"

This theory would provide \nsupport for the S-Five concept of threat to fall within the domain \nof dysregulation rather than affectivity. Our assumption was that \nthreat would show stronger associations with anxiety. However, not \nonly anxiety but other emotional reaction correlated strongly with \nthreat, too. Additionally, threat was strongly correlated with \nemotional and cognitive dysregulation, and moderately associated \nwith general and behavioral dysregulation and both types of \navoidance. While the term “threat” may denote a sense of fear, these \nresults indicate that it is not an anxiety response, but rather a more \ncomplex emotional and cognitive experience. We propose that the \nsense of emotional threat comes from a combination of the initial \nemotional reaction, compounded by a lack of understanding of the \nproblem, and a sense of not being able to cope (dysregulation) in \nthat moment, resulting in a feeling of being trapped, panicked and \nhelpless if unable to get away from the situation. This could \nbe explored further in qualitative studies seeking to understand the \ncomplexity of what is happening in these moments.\nAs expected, there were also strong associations for threat \nwith avoidance. Future experimental research would be helpful to \ndetermine whether avoidance plays a maintaining role in the sense \nof threat experienced by those with misophonia. Further, \nsymptoms of avoidance were strongly associated with the S-Five \nscale impact. Future studies could investigate how avoidance and \ncoping strategies are related to impairment.\nThe domain misophonic impairment has been shown to be a \ncrucial domain insofar that symptoms from this domain, and \nespecially impact as measured by the S-Five, were highly \ncorrelated with symptoms from all other domains. Further, all \nscales from the S-Five were highly associated with impact. \nAlthough impact plays an important role in the nomological \nnetwork because it is related to a wide range of misophonic \nsymptoms, future studies should investigate the causes of impact. \nThis study provides a basis to select variables that have been \nshown to be strongly associated. With regard to the S-Five-T \nreactions, we  found that misophonia severity was strongly \nassociated with the number of times anger was reported as a \nprimary reaction to triggers, supporting the frequent reporting \nof anger as the predominant response in misophonia ( Brout \net al., 2018 ; Jager et al., 2020 ), at least with regard to the primary \nreaction to trigger sounds. Reports of panic as a primary reaction \nwere also associated with misophonia severity, which is \nsupported by the findings of Vitoratou et  al. (2021b) , but is \ncontrary to the suggestion by Jager et al. (2020)  that anxiety and \npanic should not be considered a primary reaction in misophonia.\nIt was interesting to note that the count of physiological \nreaction was not associated with overall misophonia severity \nbut was associated with anxiety sensitivity. One possible \nexplanation for this is that the physiological reaction reported \nin misophonia ( Edelstein et al., 2013 ; Kumar et al., 2017 ) may \nbe mostly a physical manifestation of emotions. While there \nmay be some individuals who experience only a physiological \nreaction, it’s also possible that some report it as physiological \nif they are not able to identify or label specific emotions, \nespecially if they show high traits of anxiety sensitivity, which measure fear of anxiety symptoms. Further in-depth \ninvestigation is needed to understand this better.\nWe found that the reaction count of irritation as a primary \nreaction to sounds was not associated with misophonia severity, \nnor any of the related scales. However, the S-Five factors were all \npositively associated with the BMQ-R measure of irritation and \nirritability more generally. This supports the notion proposed by \nVitoratou et al. (2021b) , that while irritation may be part of the \nexperience of misophonia, if someone reports that irritation is their \nmost frequent response to trigger sounds, that is likely not \nindicative of the disorder of misophonia, and in fact represents a \ntypical response to unpleasant sounds reported in the general \npopulation ( Vitoratou et al., 2022a ). Finally, we looked at the S-Five \nin relation to symptoms of depression and obsessive–compulsive \ndisorder. In line with previous studies, misophonia severity was \nassociated with symptoms of depression ( Wu et al., 2014 ; Erfanian \net al., 2019 ; Jager et al., 2020 ), particularly with regards to threat \nand impact ( Vitoratou et  al., 2021b ). Threat was moderately \nassociated with anxiety sensitivity, which warrants further \ninvestigation to expand on previous work examining misophonia \nand anxiety sensitivity ( Cusack et al., 2018 ; McKay et al., 2018 ; \nSchadegg et al., 2021 ). In line with previous research ( Cusack et al., \n2018 ; McKay et al., 2018 ), symptoms of misophonia were associated \nwith some aspects of OCD symptoms but not others, with \nmoderate correlations with unacceptable thoughts and low \ncorrelations with symmetry. This adds to growing evidence that \nmisophonia is not specifically part of obsessive–compulsive and \nrelated disorders ( McKay et  al., 2018 ). Further research could \ninvestigate overlapping transdiagnostic mechanisms, for example \nintrusive thoughts and urges in misophonia and potential related \nbeliefs around the likelihood of acting on those intrusions.\nOverall, the results have shown that symptoms measured by \nthe S-Five fit well in the proposed nomological network of \nmisophonic symptoms, which provides strong evidence for the \nconstruct validity of the (German) S-Five. The studies have also \nreplicated past results from studies with the S-Five and revealed \nunknown exploratory associations of the S-Five scales with \nmisophonic symptoms and symptoms of other mental disorders.\nWe hope that the proposed nomological network is understood \nas a first attempt to formalize further investigations of misophonic \nsymptoms and thus provide a structural and theoretical basis. \nFurthermore, this article aims to raise awareness of a symptom-\noriented approach to investigate misophonia and thus help readers \nand future research to understand associations between \nmisophonic symptoms and how to disentangle and explain them.\nLimitations\nAlthough two large and independent samples were drawn, \nwe did not implement a random sampling scheme. Our samples \nwere drawn from social media which is why our results are not \nrepresentative for the German population (e.g., more women, \nmore highly educated, younger individuals were sampled) and are \ntherefore biased and difficult to generalize. However, as we aimed"

We  suggest \nadministering the German S-Five in a large representative sample \nto assess the psychometric properties for the German population \nwithout sampling bias. Also note that for some of the analyses in \nstudy 2, the sample sizes were rather small ( N = 76–155), which \nshould be considered in the interpretation of results. We hence \nstrongly recommend interpreting results, which stem from these \nsmaller samples, with caution and replicating them.\nThe surveys lasted more than 40 min on average which might \nhave caused exhaustion and higher dropout rates, but \nwe  implemented a rigorous data quality assessment which \ncertainly minimized this issue. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee \nunbiased estimates due to systematic missing responses \nor exhaustion.\nA methodological issue limiting the scope of our results is the \nexclusive administration of questionnaires. Podsakoff et al. (2003)  \ndemonstrated artificially increasing correlations due to shared \nmethod-specific variance. We therefore suggest an extension of \nthe study using different measurement methods (e.g., interviews \nand behavioral data). Another limitation of our study is that \nwe did not assess hyperacusis (i.e., a decreased sound tolerance \ncondition related to misophonia, which is mainly characterized by \naversive reactions to physical characteristics of sounds such as \nloudness; e.g., Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2014 ) as a measure of \ndiscriminant validity which should be  addressed in \nfollow-up studies.\nSince misophonia is still a relatively little investigated \ncondition, we did not fulfill strong properties of a nomological \nnetwork. Thus, a major weakness of our study is the network \nwas based on observations from the misophonia and broader \nliterature, rather than being derived from a comprehensive \ntheoretical framework, which does not yet exist for the etiology \nand maintenance of misophonia. Our observed associations \ntherefore need to be  further corroborated. The proposed \nnomological network should be interpreted as a first attempt to \nformalize and disentangle associations between misophonic \nsymptoms. This attempt is thus deemed to stimulate further \ndevelopment of a more rigorous and extended nomological \nnetwork in future research. A more profound nomological \nnetwork for misophonia is dependent on substantiated theories \non misophonic processes, requiring theoretical models with \ntestable hypotheses. Our study provided a formalized and \nreasonable first approach to a nomological network for \nmisophonia, one which will need to be  further tested \nand refined.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the presented nomological network overall \nclearly supports the validity of the German S-Five and gives \ncomprehensive insight into the relationship of misophonic symptoms in general. The demonstrated measures to capture \nsymptoms of misophonia have been shown to \nbe  psychometrically robust and allow for reliable and \nvalid conclusions.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are publicly \navailable.
