  "abstract": "This longitudinal study examined the role of anger, disgust, and anxiety in the experience of misophonia, the quality of life of those with self-reported misophonia in comparison to those without misophonia, and the association of misophonia and quality of life over time. An online longitudinal survey was conducted, with misophonia, anger, disgust, anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and quality of life measured at two time points (6-months apart) in two groups of people (those with self-reported misophonia and those without misophonia). Anger and disgust emerged as the primary predictors of misophonic responses. Anxiety and depression were not significantly associated with misophonia over time. Differences in quality of life were observed between those with and without self-reported misophonia in the current study, with lower scores across the SF-36 domains of role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional wellbeing, social functioning, and general health for those with misophonia compared to those without misophonia. Compared with other studies, scores for those with self-reported misophonia were lower than those with long-term physical conditions, similar to those with tinnitus, but higher than those with obsessive compulsive disorder. Misophonia was predictive of quality of life over time but only on two domains: role limitations due to emotional problems (predictors: avoidance, emotional responses, and impact on participation in life) and pain (predictor: impact on participation in life). Depression remained a strong predictor of quality of life over time. Anger and disgust are more strongly associated with the experience of misophonia than anxiety. Quality of life in people with self-reported misophonia is lower than in the general population and may be similar to those with tinnitus. Depression, avoiding triggers, the extent of the emotional response, and perceived impact on participation in life are associated with perceptions of lower quality of life over time for people with self-reported misophonia.",

While our knowledge and understanding\nof the characteristics of misophonia are growing this remains\nan understudied condition. This study aimed to add to our\nunderstanding of misophonia by assessing the association with\nnegative emotions (such as anger, disgust, and anxiety), to\ndetermine the quality of life for people with self-reported\nmisophonia using a widely used scale that would facilitate\ncomparisons with other conditions, and to determine the extent\nto which misophonia is associated with quality of life over time.\nResearch to date shows that the catalyst that brings about\na misophonic response is usually an auditory occurrence, but\nmay sometimes be visual (Swedo et al., 2022). The misophonic\nresponse varies between individuals both in terms of the type\nof trigger, and the intensity and duration of the response\n(Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2001; Edelstein et al., 2013; Schröder\net al., 2013). The most common auditory triggers are, “mouth-\noriented” sounds (for example, chewing and lip smacking),\nhowever, visual triggers are also reported; while these are often\nvisual stimuli associated with trigger sounds (for example, seeing\nsomeone chewing) (Edelstein et al., 2013; Schröder et al., 2013;\nJastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2014; Wu et al., 2014; Dozier, 2015;\nTaylor, 2017; Jager et al., 2020), there are examples of non-\nmouth visual triggers (for example, leg jiggling and hair twirling)\n(Jastreboﬀ and Jastreboﬀ, 2001). The source of the trigger also\nvaries with some people being triggered by a person, or people,\nand others triggered by inanimate sounds (for example, clock\nticking, machine noises etc.) (Edelstein et al., 2013). For those\nwho are triggered by a person, some can name speciﬁc people\nwhile others report being triggered by anyone.\nMisophonia is currently an unclassiﬁed condition, and\nthere has been an ongoing debate regarding diagnostic criteria\nand deﬁnitions for misophonia (Schröder et al., 2013; Dozier\net al., 2017; Taylor, 2017; Jager et al., 2020; Swedo et al.,\n2022). Indeed, since our study was designed and conducted,\na recent consensus statement has been published stating that\nthe predominant triggers for misophonia are auditory, and that\nthere are diﬀerent dimensions to misophonia including both\nemotional and physical responses to triggers. However, while\nmany of us ﬁnd some noises annoying, as yet it is unclear\nthe extent to which this experience diﬀers from those who\nreportedly have a stronger response, i.e., those with misophonia.\nA few studies have shown that people recruited from the general\npopulation can be classiﬁed as having weak or strong responses\n(for example, Wu et al., 2014; McKay et al., 2018). Both these\nstudies show that responses to auditory sensitivities are also\nexperienced in those who do not have or who are not aware\nthey have misophonia. Both studies also carried out comparisonanalysis by splitting their group according to a proposed cut\noﬀ (a score of 7 of the Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ; Wu\net al., 2014) and showed signiﬁcant diﬀerences in these groups.\nFor example, the McKay et al. study showed that the group\nmean for auditory sensitivities for those scoring under 7 (i.e.,\nthose who probably don’t have misophonia) was 3.37 and the\nmean for those scoring over 7 (those the authors suggest may\nhave misophonia) was 8.41, indicating that, if the second group\ndoes indeed have misophonia, there is a clear diﬀerence in\nthe response to stimuli. This study also reported a signiﬁcant\ndiﬀerence between the “presence of symptoms” subscale (15.42\nfor those scoring above the cut oﬀ and 10.11 for those scoring\nbelow) and the “emotions and behaviors” subscale (17.49 for\nthose above the cut oﬀ and 9.84 for those below the cut oﬀ),\nagain showing a potential diﬀerence should the ﬁrst group have\nmisophonia. The higher mean of the emotions and behavior\nsubscale suggest these domains are more of a concern for those\nwho have a response to triggers. Further research is needed to\ndetermine the extent of any diﬀerences between those that feel\nthey have misophonia and those who don’t as we lack clear\nunderstanding of the extent of the emotional and physiological\nresponses between these two groups. This knowledge will help\nto clarify the experience of misophonia for the individual.\nUnderstanding more about the response to triggers includes\nunderstanding the dominant emotions associated with the\ncondition. The literature shows some conﬂicting evidence in\nthis regard. Anger, disgust, and anxiety have all been previously\nreported as important in misophonia, and anxiety-related\ndisorders have been evidenced in several studies. Anxiety was\nreported in two qualitative studies which recruited misophonia-\nspeciﬁc samples (Edelstein et al., 2013; Dozier and Morrison,\n2017) and was reported to be associated with the trigger in a\ncross-sectional survey (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018). In addition,\nstudies which recruited participants from the general population\nfound anxiety to be associated with misophonia (Cusack et al.,\n2018) and anxiety to be a mediator of the relationship between\nmisophonia and anger (Wu et al., 2014). One study compared\nanxiety in those who reported higher (versus lower) scores on\nthe Sound Sensitivity subscale (of the MQ; Wu et al., 2014)\nand found anxiety levels to be signiﬁcantly greater in those who\nscored higher for misophonia (McKay et al., 2018). However,\nsome studies, while reporting anxiety, found it was not the main\nemotion experienced (Schröder et al., 2013). Jager et al. (2020)\nalso reported that anxiety was not the primary response in their\nstudy where only 1% of the people with misophonia reported\nanxiety. These studies show that anxiety is present in people\nwith misophonia, however the lack of consistency in studies\nthat assessed anxiety as either a precursor to misophonia or a\nconsequence means that the evidence base is not clear.\nAnger has also been reported in both qualitative and\nquantitative studies of misophonia (Edelstein et al., 2013;\nSchröder et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014; McKay et al., 2018; Rouw\nand Erfanian, 2018; Jager et al., 2020) and has been shown to\nbe experienced to a larger degree in those who score higher in\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 02 frontiersin.org"

This suggests there is\nmore consistent evidence for the role of anger in the experience\nof misophonia. Disgust is another emotion reported by some\nstudies to be associated with misophonia (Edelstein et al., 2013;\nSchröder et al., 2013; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018); however, one\nstudy found that disgust was not associated with misophonia\n(Jager et al., 2020). Further research is therefore needed to\nexamine this lack of clarity around the emotions that are\nimportant in the experience of misophonia, to contribute to our\nunderstanding of misophonia and to inform treatment options.\nStudies assessing the impact of misophonia are few. One\nlarge quantitative study indicated the negative impact of\nmisophonia on quality of life, which was assessed using various\nmeasures including the WHOQOLBref, the Manchester Short\nAssessment Quality of life questionnaire, and the Sheehan\nDisability scale (Sheehan, 1983; WHOQOL Group, 1998; Priebe\net al., 1999; Jager et al., 2020). Other quantitative studies\nthat used the Sheehan Disability Scale (Sheehan, 1983) have\nalso found misophonia severity to correlate signiﬁcantly and\npositively with disability in work/school, social and family\ndomains (Wu et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2017). However,\nqualitative evidence has shown contradictory reports, where\nsome participants report a large impact and others no impact\nat all (Edelstein et al., 2013). Research exploring self-reported\nquality of life in people with misophonia, using a validated and\nwidely used scale such as the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36\n(Ware and Sherbourne, 1992), to enable comparison to those\nwith other long-term conditions and those without, will further\nour understanding of how misophonia impacts life.\nThis study therefore aimed to help address the current lack\nof clarity surrounding the role of diﬀerent negative emotions\nin misophonia, and to provide insight about the impact of\nmisophonia on quality of life. Speciﬁcally, we examined the role\nof anger, disgust and anxiety in the experience of misophonia,\nthe quality of life of those with self-reported misophonia in\ncomparison to those without misophonia, and the association\nof misophonia and quality of life over time.\nMaterials and methods\nDesign\nA longitudinal design was used. Survey data were collected\nonline from two samples (those with self-reported misophonia\nand those without) at two time points, approximately 6 months\napart.1Data collection occurred from July–October 2020\n(baseline) and January–May 2021 (follow-up). This prospective\ndesign allowed measurement of predictor variables at baseline\nand the outcome variables at follow-up. This design enabled\n1 A subset of the data was published in Dibb et al. (2021).us to answer the main questions examining which factors\nare associated with the experience of misophonia, how the\nexperiences of people with self-reported misophonia diﬀer from\nthose without, and how quality of life is aﬀected for those\nwith misophonia.\nParticipants\nParticipants with and without self-reported misophonia\nwere recruited to complete the same online survey. To enable\nrecruitment of participants likely to have misophonia, an email\nadvertisement was shared through the Misophonia Institute,\nUnited States. Although based in the United States, the Institute\nis associated with over 5,000 people worldwide, most of whom\nhave self-diagnosed misophonia. To enable recruitment of\npeople without misophonia, the study was also advertised to\nthe general public using social media and snowball sampling.\nGPower analysis (Faul et al., 2007) conﬁrmed a sample of 114\nwas needed for each group to achieve a power of >0.8; however,\nto account for attrition rates, common in longitudinal research\n(Boys et al., 2003; Gustavson et al., 2012), we aimed for 400\nparticipants per group at baseline.\nMeasures\nDemographics\nAt baseline, participants were asked to provide their age,\ngender, and ethnicity (all optional). They were also asked\nto “Please indicate below if you have any of the following\nconditions, ” with the response options being Yes,No, and Prefer\nnot to say . The conditions were presented to participants as\nfollows:\n1. Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)\n2. Misophonia (sensitivity to sensory stimuli)\n3. Any other sensory conditions (e.g., hyperacusis, sensory\nprocessing disorder, or other sensory disorder)\n4. Vertigo (dizziness)\n5. Anxiety\n6. Depression\n7. Any other conditions (please specify).\nSelf-reported responses to the misophonia item in this\nlist were used to classify participants into two groups for\nanalysis; those who responded yeswere classiﬁed as having\nmisophonia (hereafter referred to as the “misophonia group”)\nand those who responded nowere classiﬁed as not having\nmisophonia (hereafter referred to as the “general population\ngroup”). Any participants who responded Prefer not to say\nfor this item were excluded from the ﬁnal analysis, as they\ncould not be classiﬁed into either of the two groups.

We had\nomitted this at baseline but included at follow-up as we were\ncollecting data from an international sample.\nMisophonia triggers\nAt baseline, those participants who reported they had\nmisophonia were asked an additional question: “Please indicate\nbelow which types of stimuli you experience as misophonia\ntriggers (select all that apply).” At the time this study was\ndesigned, there was no consensus as to which stimuli are\ncharacteristic of misophonia; for this reason we decided not\nto restrict the response to just visual or auditory triggers so\nresponse options included: Sounds ,Sights ,Touch ,Smells ,Taste ,\nOther (please specify) .\nAt follow-up, participants were asked to provide additional\ninformation about the sensory domains in which they are\ntriggered; participants were asked to indicate from a pre-\nspeciﬁed list which speciﬁc types of sound, sight, smell or touch\ntriggered them. Participants were also asked to indicate who,\nfrom a pre-speciﬁed list, they were triggered by (e.g., parent,\ngrandparent, and romantic partner). The items included in these\nlists were informed by unpublished data collected from people\nwith self-reported misophonia during a previous study (Dibb\net al., 2021).\nWorkplace characteristics\nThree items exploring participants’ work situation were\nalso included in the baseline questions. Participants were asked\nabout the environment in which they carry out their core day-\nto-day activities, i.e., where they spend “most of their time”\n(including work or studies outside the home and housework).\nFirst, participants were asked to select what their current\nusual working environment is from a list of 15 response\noptions, including a range of oﬃce-based options, other indoor\nsettings such as retail, health/social care, education, and outdoor\nsettings. The second question asked participants to indicate how\nmany people usually share their usual working environment\n(None – I usually work on my own ,1–5,6–10 ,11–20 ,21–50 ,\n50+). The ﬁnal work-related question asked participants to rate\ntheusual noise level in their usual working environment [with\na 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( very little noise ) to 7\n(very noisy )].\nPrimary outcome variables – misophonic\nresponse and quality of life\nThe response to sensory stimuli (i.e., the misophonic\nresponse) was measured using the Misophonia Response Scale\n(MRS) (Dibb et al., 2021) which consists of 22 items, 19\nof which form three subscales [emotional response (sevenitems), physiological response (seven items), and perceived\nparticipation in life (ﬁve items)]. The additional three items\nmeasure the frequency of a response to a trigger, the degree\nof avoidance of triggering situations and the perceived time it\ntakes to recover from a response. The MRS is not intended\nto be used as a diagnostic tool, but it can be used to measure\nthe extent of individuals’ responses to sensory stimuli. For this\nstudy, the scale was amended so that the word “misophonia”\nwas omitted; instead items asked about “response to stimuli”\nto ensure that it made sense to both those with self-reported\nmisophonia and those without. All items were rated on a 7-point\nscale. A total score and a weighted score can also be calculated.\nInternal consistency for all three MRS subscales was good at\nboth baseline and follow-up, ranging from 0.77 to 0.96 ( Table 1 ).\nQuality of life was measured with the Medical Outcomes\nStudy SF-36 health survey (Ware and Sherbourne, 1992),\nsourced from RAND Corporation.2This is a 36-item\nmultidimensional quality of life questionnaire which measures\nhealth on eight dimensions (physical functioning, role\nlimitations due to physical health, role limitations due to\nemotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional wellbeing,\nsocial functioning, pain, and general health). This validated\nquestionnaire has been used widely and developed to be used\nacross many diﬀerent conditions for the purpose of comparison\n(Bowling, 2005). It has been used in physical (e.g., Scharloo\net al., 2007), neurological (e.g., Baca et al., 2015), and mental\nhealth conditions (e.g., Friedman et al., 2005). It was chosen\nspeciﬁcally because it is so widely used, which enables us to\nshow the impact of misophonia on quality of life in comparison\nto quality of life in other conditions reported in the literature.\nInternal consistency for all eight SF-36 subscales was good\nat both baseline and follow-up, ranging from 0.76 to 0.91\n(Table 1 ).\nPredictor variables – psychosocial constructs\nThree scales measuring negative emotions (anger, disgust,\nand anxiety) were included to determine the association of these\nemotions with the experience of misophonia and to determine\ndiﬀerences between people with self-reported misophonia and\nthose without. Anger was measured with the 6-item Brief Anger\nand Aggression Questionnaire (Maiuro et al., 1987), with all\nitems measured on a 5-point Likert scale ( extremely unlikely to\nvery likely ). Disgust was measured with the 6-item Propensity\nsubscale of the revised Disgust Propensity and Sensitivity scale\n(Fergus and Valentiner, 2009), with all items measured on a 5-\npoint Likert scale ( never toalways ). Anxiety was measured with\nthe 6-item State Trait Anxiety Inventory (Marteau and Bekker,\n2020), rated on a 4-point scale ( not at all tovery much ). Higher\ntotal scores on each scale indicate greater levels of anger, disgust,\nor anxiety.\n2 Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 available from RAND Corporation\nhere: https://www.rand.org/health-care/surveys_tools/mos/36-item-\nshort-form.html\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 04 frontiersin.org"

Paired-samples t-tests were used to examine\nany changes in these variables within-participants over time.3As\nmultiple inferential tests were performed on the same outcome\nvariables, the p-values for determining statistical signiﬁcance\nwere adjusted using the Bonferroni correction ( p= 0.05/number\nof tests) (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007). For the SF-36 and\nMRS outcomes the adjusted p= 0.0167 (0.05/3), and for the\npsychosocial outcomes the adjusted p= 0.025 (0.05/2).\nHierarchical multiple regressions were conducted to explore\npredictors of the misophonic response and of quality of life\nin people with self-reported misophonia, both cross-sectionally\nand longitudinally. To achieve more clarity on how anger,\ndisgust, and anxiety relate to the misophonic response, they were\nentered in a separate block to depression (McKay et al., 2018;\nQuek et al., 2018; Alekri and Al Saif, 2019), as we wanted to\nbe able to account for the eﬀects of anger, disgust and anxiety\nwithout the inﬂuence of depression (which has been shown to\nhave a strong association with misophonia). To achieve this,\npredictor variables were entered as follows: (block one) age,\n(block two) anger, disgust, anxiety, and (block three) depression.\nEight regressions were conducted to predict eight misophonic\noutcomes: frequency, recovery, avoidance, emotional responses,\nphysiological responses, participation in life, severity MRS\nscores, and weighted MRS scores. To predict perceived quality\nof life, predictor variables were entered as follows: (block one)\nage, (block two) MRS scores for frequency, recovery, avoidance,\nemotional responses, physiological responses, and participation,\nand (block three) anxiety, self-esteem, and depression. Eight\nregressions were conducted to predict each of the eight SF-\n36 sub-scales: physical functioning, role limitations due to\nphysical health, role limitations due to emotional problems,\nenergy/fatigue, emotional wellbeing, social functioning, pain,\nand general health. All models were bootstrapped.4For brevity\nof reporting, only summary statistics are reported for the\nregression models; full details of the regression models are\navailable in the Appendix.\n3 Distributions for some outcome variables were skewed (MRS scores\nin the general population and quality of life scores for both groups);\ngiven the large sample sizes achieved, parametric tests were performed\nand reported for tests of difference between groups at baseline and\nfollow-up, and within-participants over time. As a sense check, non-\nparametric tests were also performed; patterns of statistical signiﬁcance\nachieved (i.e., signiﬁcant or not) were the same for all variables, with one\nexception; the signiﬁcant difference observed in physical functioning on\nthe SF-36 between groups at baseline using an independent t-test, was\nnot statistically signiﬁcant on the Mann–Whitney test ( p= 0.13).\n4 Assumptions for independence of errors and multicollinearity were\nmet for all models. Standardized residuals indicated a small percentage\nof cases ( <1%) represented multivariate outliers in some models; values\nfor leverage and Mahalanobis’ distance indicated these cases may exert\nsome undue inﬂuence in the models. Overall, however, the assumptions\nfor regression models were met; to increase the robustness of all\nestimates, models were bootstrapped.Results\nParticipant demographics\nThe baseline survey was started 1,433 times, but 439\nresponses were deleted during data screening for the following\nreasons: aged under 18 ( n= 6), answered prefer not to say\nto misophonia grouping question ( n= 3), likely a duplicate\nresponse based on emails provided for follow-up ( n= 6), did\nnot progress beyond demographics ( n= 266) or complete all\nmeasures ( n= 158). This left a total of 994 participants (77.3%\nfemale) who completed the survey at baseline. Participants\nwere aged 18–91 years (mean ( m) = 47.23, standard deviation\n(SD) = 14.54), and most (90.9%) reported their ethnicity as\nWhite. Of these 994 participants, 491 stated they did have\nmisophonia (the misophonia group) and 503 stated they did\nnot have misophonia (the general population group). For full\ndemographic details see Table 2 .\nAn independent t-test was conducted to examine group\ndiﬀerences at baseline in age, and Pearson’s chi-square tests were\nconducted to examine group diﬀerences in gender, ethnicity,\nand having other health conditions. Except for ethnicity, there\nwere statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences across all demographic\nvariables at baseline between the two groups. The misophonia\ngroup were on average younger than the general population\ngroup [misophonia age range = 18–80, m= 44.32, SD= 14.54;\ngeneral population age range = 18–91, m= 50.06, SD= 13.99;\nt(988.17) = 6.35, p<0.001, d= 0.40]. A greater proportion of\nthe misophonia group were female compared with the general\npopulation group. For each of the health conditions assessed,\nparticipants in the self-reported misophonia group were more\nlikely to report having that health condition than those in the\ngeneral population group ( Table 2 ).\nFrom the 994 useable baseline responses, 958 participants\nprovided an email at baseline and were invited 6 months later\nto complete the follow-up survey, which was accessed 246\ntimes. At follow-up, 24 responses were deleted during data\nscreening for the following reasons: aged under 18 ( n= 3),\nlikely a duplicate response based on emails provided for follow-\nup (n= 6), did not complete all measures ( n= 11), response\ncould not be matched to baseline as email check provided at\nfollow-up did not match ( n= 4). Therefore, a total of 222\npeople participated at follow-up (misophonia, n= 127; general\npopulation n= 95; follow-up rate of 22.33%). Of these 222\nparticipants, 76.1% were female, 92.3% were White, and their\nage range was 18–80 ( m= 49.02, SD= 15.07). There were\nno statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in ethnicity and age at\nfollow-up, although the misophonia group were on average\nyounger than the general population group [misophonia age\nrange = 18–75, m= 47.36, SD= 15.04; general population\nage range = 18–80, m= 51.24, SD= 14.90; t(220) = 1.91,\np= 0.058, d= 0.26].

Sounds were experienced as triggers by all but\none participant, and sights were experienced as triggers by 63%.\nTouch and smells were experienced by around one-quarter of\nparticipants, and only a small number of participants reported\nexperiencing taste or other stimuli as triggers.\nAt follow-up, participants with self-reported misophonia\nwere asked to provide more speciﬁc information about the types\nof triggers they experienced, as well as indicating who they\nexperienced being a “trigger person” ( Table 3 ). All but one\nperson with misophonia reported being triggered by sounds and\nit is evident from participants’ responses that people experience\nauditory triggers across a variety of diﬀerent sounds; triggers\nare clearly not restricted to only one or two types of sound.\nCommon auditory triggers included various types of sounds\nrelated to the human body, as well as animal-related sounds\nand mechanical or digital sounds. Experiencing visual triggers\nwas also reported by most participants; only 15.7% reported that\nthey did not experience any visual triggers. The most common\ntriggering sight was mouth-related movement (65.4%). The\nproportion of people who reported being triggered by speciﬁc\ntypes of smell or touch was lower than for speciﬁc types of\nsounds or sights. Nonetheless, at follow-up, 27.0% reported\nbeing triggered by smells and 27.8% reported being triggered by\ntouch. In terms of who they experienced as being the source of\ntriggers, people with self-reported misophonia most commonly\nreported being triggered by anyone (70.1%), romantic partners\n(62.2%), strangers (61.4%) and parents (59.8%). Only two\nparticipants (1.6%) reported not being triggered by people.\nWorkplace characteristics\nAcross the whole sample, and by group, most participants\ndescribed their current usual working environment during the\nbaseline survey as being at home, followed by being oﬃce-\nbased ( Table 4 ).

There were no statistically signiﬁcant\ndiﬀerences between the two groups in terms of the number\nof people usually present in their workplace [ $2(5) = 5.40,\np= 0.37].\nAcross the whole sample, perceptions of the usual noise\nlevel in participants’ working environment were considered just\nbelow moderate, i.e., just below the mid-point on the 7-point\nresponse scale ( m= 3.07, SD= 1.72). There were, however,\nsigniﬁcant diﬀerences between the two groups, with those in\nthe misophonia group perceiving their working environment as\nnoisier, compared to the general population group [misophonia\nm= 3.53, SD= 1.78; general population m= 2.61, SD= 1.53;\nt(959.27) = 8.75, p<0.001, d= 0.56].

Across all participants, those who usually shared\ntheir working environment with a greater number of people on\naverage perceived their working environment to be noisier.\nMisophonic responses: Differences\nbetween and within participants\nDescriptive statistics for MRS scores at baseline and follow-\nup for those with and without self-reported misophonia are\nreported in Tables 5 –7. Bivariate correlations between the MRS,the psychosocial variables, and quality of life at baseline for\nthose with self-reported misophonia are presented in Table 8 .\nAll correlations show an association in the expected direction\nwhere a higher misophonia score is associated with more anger,\nanxiety, disgust and depression, but reduce quality of life and\nself-esteem. The correlations are signiﬁcant for all but two of\nthe variables: avoidance does not correlate signiﬁcantly with\nanxiety, self-esteem and general health, and the emotional\nresponse to triggers does not correlate signiﬁcantly with physical\nfunctioning, physical role limitations, pain, and general health.\nDifferences between groups at baseline\nAt baseline, compared to those in the general population,\npeople with self-reported misophonia experienced triggers\nmore frequently, took longer to recover from triggers, and\nreported avoiding situations/environments to a greater extent\nin order to avoid triggers (all p<0.001; Table 5 ). Those with\nmisophonia also reported greater emotional and physiological\nresponses to triggers than those in the general population,\nas well as a greater impact of triggers on their participation\nin everyday life (all p<0.001; Table 5 ). The diﬀerences\nbetween these two groups on MRS scores were all represented\nby large eﬀect sizes ( drange = 1.18–2.95; Table 5 ). Even\nthough misophonia is a condition which is yet to be formally\nrecognized, these results show a clear diﬀerence between those\nwho experience an extreme response to a trigger and those\nwho do not.\nDifferences between groups at follow-up\nStatistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were also seen in MRS\nscores at follow-up between the misophonia and general\npopulation groups; these diﬀerences were again represented\nby large eﬀect sizes (all p<0.001; Table 6 ). As at baseline,\npeople with self-reported misophonia experienced triggers\nmore frequently, took longer to recover from triggers, and\nreported avoiding situations/environments to a greater\nextent in order to avoid triggers. They also reported\ngreater emotional and physiological responses to triggers\nand a greater impact of triggers on their participation in\neveryday life.\nWithin-participant differences over time\nFor four elements of the MRS (recovery, avoidance,\nphysiological responses, participation) there were no statistically\nsigniﬁcant diﬀerences over time amongst the misophonia\ngroup ( Table 7 ). There were, however, statistically signiﬁcant\ndiﬀerences on two elements of the MRS for those with self-\nreported misophonia; at follow-up, people with misophonia\nreported reduced frequency of triggers ( p= 0.006) and\nreductions in the extent to which they experienced emotional\nresponses ( p<0.001).

The eﬀect sizes for these diﬀerences\nwere very small for physical functioning, small for physical\nhealth role limitations, pain, and general health, medium for role\nlimitations due to emotional problems and energy/fatigue, and\nlarge for emotional wellbeing and social functioning. This shows\nthat quality of life for people with misophonia is worse than for\nthose without misophonia especially for the role limitations due\nto emotional problems, emotional well-being, energy/fatigue,\nand social functioning, which highlights the emotional impact\nof the condition and the impact on social interactions.\nDifferences between groups at follow-up\nAt follow-up, quality of life was again lower in those with\nself-reported misophonia compared to the general population\nacross all subscales, but these diﬀerences were only statistically\nsigniﬁcant for four subscales; the data show greater diﬀerences\nin role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue,\nemotional wellbeing, and social functioning, with diﬀerences\nrepresented by medium eﬀect sizes ( Table 6 ). In line with the\nbaseline data, quality of life at follow-up was lower for those with\nmisophonia than those without.\nWithin-participant differences over time\nExamining the longitudinal data for those in the misophonia\ngroup, there were no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in\nquality of life on any of the eight SF-36 sub-scales between\nbaseline and follow-up. For those in the general population\ngroup, there were statistically signiﬁcant decreases in quality\nof life on two SF-36 sub-scales: energy/fatigue [ t(94) = 2.48,\np= 0.015, d= 0.25)] and emotional wellbeing [ t(94) = 2.89,\np= 0.005, d= 0.30)]. For the other six sub-scales there were no\nstatistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences in quality of life for those in\nthe general population ( Table 7 ).\nComparing quality of life in misophonia to\nother conditions\nTo further examine how living with misophonia compares\nto living with other conditions, the SF-36 scores for peoplewith self-reported misophonia in the current study are shown\ninTable 9 , alongside the SF-36 scores of people in the general\npopulation (current study), people with long-term conditions\n(Bowling et al., 1999), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)\n(Rodriguez-Salgado et al., 2006) and tinnitus (Ross et al., 2007).\nPeople with misophonia score low on role limitations due to\nemotional problems, fatigue/vitality, emotional wellbeing, and\nsocial functioning in comparison to general population samples.\nPeople with misophonia score higher than people with OCD, but\nlower than people with tinnitus and other long-term conditions,\non role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue\nand social functioning.\nPredicting misophonic response at\nbaseline and follow-up – misophonia\ngroup only\nThe regression analyses which examined the underlying\nemotions associated with misophonia (cross-sectionally and\nlongitudinally) are presented in Table 10 . Age was associated\nwith some aspects of the misophonic response; those of a\nyounger age experienced a stronger emotional and physiological\nresponse. Although depression and anxiety were signiﬁcant\npredictors of some aspects of misophonic responses cross-\nsectionally (i.e., at baseline, with eﬀects of anxiety generally\ndisappearing after depression was added to the models),\nwhen predicting misophonic responses longitudinally, both\ndepression and anxiety did not emerge as signiﬁcant predictors\nof any of the misophonic response variables. In other\nwords, depression and anxiety do not predict experiences of\nmisophonia over time.\nAnger and disgust did, however, emerge as signiﬁcant\npredictors of several aspects of misophonic response, both\ncross-sectionally and longitudinally, even after controlling for\ndepression. Higher levels of anger at baseline predicted taking a\nlonger time to recover from triggers and a stronger physiological\nresponse at follow-up. Stronger feelings of disgust at baseline\npredicted a stronger emotional response to the trigger and more\nperceived impact on participation in life at follow-up. Stronger\nfeelings of anger and disgust at baseline were both predictive of\nthe summary MRS scores (both severity and weighted scores)\nat follow-up. No signiﬁcant variables emerged for predicting\nfrequency of triggers at follow-up and while anger did emerge\nas a signiﬁcant predictor for avoidance at follow-up, the overall\nmodel was not signiﬁcant.\nPredicting quality of life at baseline and\nfollow-up – misophonia group only\nThe regression analyses, which examine the association of\nmisophonic responses with quality of life (cross-sectionally and\nlongitudinally), are presented in Table 11 .

Worse social functioning at\nbaseline was predicted by more frequent responses to triggers,\na greater physiological response to the trigger, greater perceived\nimpact on participation in life, and more depressive symptoms.\nHigher pain levels at baseline were predicted by a higher\nfrequency of response to triggers, a reduced emotional response,\nan increased physiological response, and more depressive\nsymptoms. Reduced general health at baseline was predicted\nby a reduced emotional response to triggers, higher self-\nesteem, and greater depressive symptoms. While all the MRS\nmisophonia items and subscales were predictive of quality of\nlife cross-sectionally, the frequency of the trigger, the emotional\nresponse and the physiological response were predictive of three\nof the quality of life domains, suggesting a wider impact of these\naspects of misophonia.\nThe longitudinal regression results provide a clearer\nunderstanding of the eﬀects of misophonia on quality of life\nover time. In the baseline analyses, depression was predictive\nof quality of life across all eight domains; however, at follow-\nup depression predicted quality of life for only ﬁve domains\n(all but physical functioning, pain and general health). The\nmisophonic response variables were predictive of quality of life\nover time but for only two domains (role limitations due to\nemotional problems and pain). Less avoidance of triggers, a\ngreater emotional response to the trigger, a greater perception\nof impact on participation in life, and higher depression at\nbaseline were associated with more role limitations due to\nemotional problems at follow-up. Greater pain at follow-up\nwas predicted by greater perceived impact on participation\nin life at baseline. Finally, a greater emotional response at\nbaseline was associated with increased fatigue at follow-up;\nhowever, this relationship was only evident at block 2, and\ndisappeared in block 3 (with depression again being the\nsigniﬁcant psychosocial predictor).\nDiscussion\nThis paper presents the results of a large-scale, longitudinal,\nonline survey that examined the role of negative emotions in the\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 17 frontiersin.org"

Our results\nexpand our understanding of the characteristics of misophonia\nand of the quality of life for a person with misophonia, and it\nis clear that people with self-reported misophonia experience\ndiﬀerent responses to triggers compared to people in the\ngeneral population.\nRegarding the type of triggers that bring about a\nmisophonic response, our study suggests that while triggers are\npredominantly auditory and visual, other sensory triggers may\nalso be experienced. In our sample, around a quarter of those\nwith self-reported misophonia also reported tactile and olfactory\ntriggers (26.7 and 24.7% respectively), with a smaller proportion\nalso reporting taste and ‘other’ sensory triggers. These results\ngive weight to other studies that have suggested triggers may\nbe of any sensory stimuli and not limited to only auditory or\nvisual stimuli (Dozier, 2015; Dozier et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017;\nBrout et al., 2018; Jager et al., 2020; Swedo et al., 2022). These\nresults broaden our understanding of misophonic triggers, but\nfurther research is needed to ensure that being triggered by\nother sensory stimuli does not, in fact, indicate the presence of a\ndiﬀerent or comorbid condition.\nPeople with self-reported misophonia perceived their\nworking environment to be noisier than those without\nmisophonia, despite there being no reported diﬀerence in work\nenvironments in terms of situation (at home) and number of\npeople in the working environment. Little research has been\nconducted in the work domain in relation to misophonia, but\nin support of our results a study with undergraduate students\nshowed a signiﬁcant positive correlation between misophonia\nscores and impairment at work/school (Wu et al., 2014).\nFinally, our sample reported no change in misophonic\nscores over time, which contradicts ﬁndings from other studies\nwhere participants have reported perceived changes over time\n(Bernstein et al., 2013; Edelstein et al., 2013; Kluckow et al.,\n2014; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018). However, this may be due\nto diﬀerences in measurement as some studies ask participants\nabout their perceptions of change, whereas in this study we\ndid not ask about perceived change, but instead measured the\nmisophonic response at two diﬀerent time points.\nNegative emotions and misophonia\nOne of the aims this research was to determine the\nassociation of anger, disgust and anxiety with misophonia. In\nour study, people with self-reported misophonia experienced\ngreater negative emotions than those in the general population\nwith scores on anger, disgust and anxiety signiﬁcantly higher\nthan in those without misophonia (the general population). In\naddition, depressive symptoms were higher, and self-esteem was\nlower, in those with misophonia than in the general population.\nThese diﬀerences in psychosocial variables supports researchfrom other conditions where a similar pattern is evident (for\nexample, Brueggemann et al., 2022).\nPrevious literature has shown inconsistent results about\npotential relationships between anger, disgust, and anxiety with\nmisophonia (Schröder et al., 2013; McKay et al., 2018; Jager et al.,\n2020). In our study, both anger and disgust were signiﬁcantly\nand positively associated with the two summary misophonia\nscores (weighted and unweighted) over time. Assessing the\nindividual elements of misophonia, disgust was signiﬁcantly and\npositively associated with the emotional misophonic response\nand perceptions of participation in life, with stronger feelings of\ndisgust at baseline predicting a stronger misophonic response\nover time. Our results therefore support studies showing disgust\nis associated with misophonia (Edelstein et al., 2013; Schröder\net al., 2013; Rouw and Erfanian, 2018) but contradict other\nresearch showing disgust is not associated with misophonia\n(Jager et al., 2020). Similarly, the stronger the feelings of anger,\nthe longer the recovery time after the misophonic response\nand the stronger the physiological response to the trigger. This\nsupports both qualitative and quantitative studies that have\nreported anger in people with misophonia (Edelstein et al., 2013;\nSchröder et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014; McKay et al., 2018; Rouw\nand Erfanian, 2018; Jager et al., 2020).\nTaken together, our longitudinal results indicate that disgust\nis associated with more of an emotional response while anger\nis associated with more of a physiological response, which\nsupports previous cross-sectional ﬁndings (Edelstein et al., 2013;\nSchröder et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014; McKay et al., 2018; Rouw\nand Erfanian, 2018). That anger and disgust were associated\nwith diﬀerent aspects of the misophonic response may explain\nprevious contradictory ﬁndings regarding which of these two\nemotions is important. It seems possible that a measure of\nmisophonia which includes more emotional items may show\ndisgust to be the stronger emotion, while those which include\nthe physiological responses may show anger as the dominant\nemotion.\nAnxiety has also been proposed as an important aspect\nof misophonia, although again the literature is contradictory\n(Schröder et al., 2013; Taylor, 2017; McKay et al., 2018). Our\nresults support those studies that propose anxiety is not the\nprimary emotion (Taylor, 2017; Jager et al., 2020) as anxiety did\nnot emerge as a signiﬁcant predictor of misophonic responses.\nAnxiety was only signiﬁcantly predictive of one aspect of\nmisophonia, avoidance of the trigger, but this relationship lost\nsigniﬁcance once depression was included. Overall, our results\nindicate the importance of anger and disgust over anxiety in\nrelation to the misophonic response.\nQuality of life and misophonia\nAnother of our aims was to determine perceptions of quality\nof life in those with self-reported misophonia.

Relative to the general population\nin our sample, there were signiﬁcantly lower ratings on all\ndomains of quality of life for our participants with self-reported\nmisophonia. In addition, compared to those with long-term\nconditions (Bowling et al., 1999), our misophonia group scored\nlower on the ability to carry out their role due to emotional\nproblems, lower emotional wellbeing, lower social functioning\nand greater fatigue levels. The quality of life scores for those with\nmisophonia were higher than people with OCD (Rodriguez-\nSalgado et al., 2006) but were lower than those with tinnitus\n(Ross et al., 2007) for energy, social functioning and role\nlimitations due to emotional problems. This shows that relative\nto those with other conditions (Rodriguez-Salgado et al., 2006;\nRoss et al., 2007) and those without misophonia (Bowling et al.,\n1999; Rodriguez-Salgado et al., 2006) the misophonic experience\ninterrupts the individual’s abilities to perform their role or task\nand engage in their social life. The impact on social functioning\nis likely due to the role that others play in triggering the\nindividual with misophonia, however, further research would be\nable to explore this. These results also make it clear that, while\nmisophonia is not yet recognized, it is nonetheless impacting\nquality of life. The two lowest scoring domains (role limitations\ndue to emotional problems and energy/fatigue) show where the\nmain impact is for people with misophonia.\nIn addition, there were no signiﬁcant changes over time\nin quality of life for people in our study with self-reported\nmisophonia, whereas the pattern for the general population\ngroup in our study showed a decrease over time on two\nsubscales (energy/fatigue and emotional wellbeing). This may\nbe an eﬀect of ‘lockdown’ as our data were collected during\nthe ﬁrst 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, as\nno measures were taken in relation to lockdowns we cannot\nsay for certain.\nDoes misophonia predict quality of life\nover time?\nWith regard to understanding the role misophonia plays\nin perceiving quality of life, cross-sectionally, misophonia\nwas associated with quality of life, however, many of these\nassociations weakened or ceased to be signiﬁcant once anxiety,\nself-esteem and depression were included. Longitudinally,\nmisophonic responses were predictive of quality of life, but only\non two of the domains. Greater role limitations due to emotional\nproblems were predicted by greater avoidance of triggers, a\nstronger emotional response to the trigger, and perceptions of\nmore impact on participation in life. Greater pain was predicted\nby a greater perception of impact on participation in life. Theserelationships remained signiﬁcant even after depression was\nincluded. A third domain of quality of life was also predicted\nby misophonia, with a stronger emotional response to triggers\npredicting greater fatigue; however, this relationship ceased to\nbe signiﬁcant once depression was entered, again showing the\nstrong eﬀects of depression on quality of life. These results\npartially support qualitative reports where some participants\nreported great impact (and others less so) (Edelstein et al., 2013)\nand quantitative results showing “slightly lower quality of life”\nratings for people with misophonia in a cross-sectional study\n(Jager et al., 2020, p. 8).\nThe importance of depression across all the quality of life\ndomains cross-sectionally, and four domains longitudinally,\nshows the strong impact of depressive symptoms on quality of\nlife. There was evidence of some mediation as some misophonic\nfactors were no longer signiﬁcant once depression was entered\ninto the regression models. This supports many quality of life\nstudies that have demonstrated the impact of depression on\nquality of life (for example, Friedman et al., 2005).\nDespite the eﬀects of depression, misophonia was\nimportant for all domains of quality of life, cross-sectionally.\nLongitudinally, emotional response to triggers, avoidance\nof triggers and perceived impact of participation, remained\npredictive of role limitations due to emotional problems, while\nperceived impact of participation was predictive of perceptions\nof pain. This demonstrates the potential long-term impact of\nsome aspects of the experience of misophonia on perceptions\nof quality of life. In particular, our ﬁndings highlight that (at\nleast for this sample) the emotional aspects of the misophonic\nresponse, as well as the need to avoid triggers and feeling like the\nability to participate in life is reduced, appear to have a greater\nimpact on quality of life than does the physiological aspect of\nthe misophonic response, or the length of time taken to recover\nor the frequency of being triggered.\nLimitations and future directions\nThe recruitment strategy is one limitation of this study.\nParticipants were recruited online via social media and\nthrough the Misophonia Institute, United States, which\nmeans that people with misophonia who are not associated\nwith this organization, or anyone who does not use social\nmedia, would not have been able to participate, meaning\nwe cannot be certain that the results are relevant to all\npeople with misophonia. A current limitation of many studies\nin this ﬁeld relates to a lack of being able to receive a\nformal diagnosis of misophonia in most countries, which\nmeans we cannot be sure that all our participants actually\nhad misophonia (as participants self-reported whether they\nconsidered themselves to have misophonia or not in response to\na single-item question, rather than any formal diagnosis process\nas part of the study).\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 22 frontiersin.org"

Furthermore, we did not collect\nany data regarding participants’ psychological or psychiatric\nhistories regarding previous and existing conditions and/or\ntreatments. We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that\nsome people who stated they had misophonia may in fact\nhave been experiencing sensory triggers as a result of other\nco-morbid or undiagnosed psychiatric conditions. Indeed, one\nstudy recently identiﬁed that 26% of patients referred with a self-\ndiagnosis of misophonia were deemed by psychiatrics to have a\ndiﬀerent primary condition (Jager et al., 2020). Future research\nshould aim to recruit clinical samples, individuals with links to\nother misophonia organizations, and those who do not engage\nwith social media.\nData were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, which\nmay have impacted exposure to triggers and quality of life for\nall participants, but as countries responded diﬀerently and at\ndiﬀerent times to the spread of the virus, it is diﬃcult to know\nthe eﬀects of the pandemic and associated lockdowns on the\ndata. Our sample was also predominantly female and future\nresearch should aim to recruit more men. Our longitudinal\nstudy was conducted over a period of 6 months, which is\na strength; however, as is common with longitudinal studies\nwe expected, and observed, a high attrition rate (Boys et al.,\n2003; Gustavson et al., 2012). Longitudinal research is important\nin order to understand the long-term eﬀects of misophonia\nover a longer period, to explore how misophonia may change\nand progress over time. Finally, three work-related items were\nincluded in this research, yielding interesting results in terms of\nperceptions of noise levels at work. Future research into how the\nwork environment inﬂuences work satisfaction would beneﬁt\nthose living with misophonia.\nConclusion\nThis research has shown that people with self-reported\nmisophonia rate their quality of life as lower than those who\nhave tinnitus and much lower than people without misophonia\nand without other long-term physical conditions. This shows\nhow this condition does indeed impact on quality of life in a\nsigniﬁcant way. Anger and disgust were found to be the main\nnegative emotions associated with misophonia, while anxiety\nwas not associated with misophonia. The strong inﬂuence of\ndepression with both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis,\nsuggests that treatment for misophonia could include strategies\nto tackle depression as part of the treatment. Misophonia\nwas associated with perceptions of quality of life over time,\nin particular, the emotional response to the trigger and theperceived impact on participation in life were the main factors\nassociated with the ability to carry out one’s role and the\nperception of pain. These results show the impact misophonia\ncan have and highlight this condition as one that needs further\nresearch and support.\nData availability statement\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will\nbe made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\nEthics statement\nThis research received ethical approval from the University\nof Surrey Ethics Committee.
