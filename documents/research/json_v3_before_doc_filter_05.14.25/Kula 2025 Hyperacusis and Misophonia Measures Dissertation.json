  "abstract": "Hyperacusis is characterised by an increased sensitivity to everyday sounds, while misophonia involves strong emotional, behavioural and physical reactions to specific trigger sounds, such as chewing or tapping. Despite their significant impact, some questionnaires used to assess these conditions exhibit varying psychometric robustness, and the psychological links between these conditions and health outcomes—such as fatigue, stress, and sleep quality— remain incompletely understood. This thesis addressed these gaps through a systematic review and three empirical studies. The systematic review assessed eight widely used questionnaires against COSMIN standards, identifying gaps in reliability and validity, which provided the basis for the subsequent empirical studies. The first study validated the English version of MisoQuest, a 14-item misophonia questionnaire, demonstrating adequate model fit in CFA but finding that a one-factor structure was not fully supported due to shared variance among some items. While it showed good convergent and discriminant validity, moderate correlations with fatigue indicated potential construct overlaps, requiring further investigation. The second study explored this relationship between misophonia and fatigue, identifying stress and sleep quality as partial mediators, highlighting the potential for targeted interventions. The final study validated the 4C Hyperacusis and Misophonia Management Questionnaires in clinical population, demonstrating a one-factor structure for the 4C Hyperacusis Management and two-factor structure for the 4C Misophonia Management, both with acceptable model fit. The questionnaires also showed strong reliability, along with good convergent and discriminant validity. These tools assess patients' confidence in managing symptoms, particularly within the context of cognitive-behavioural therapy. To summarise, the results of this thesis provide novel evidence of the assessment of hyperacusis and misophonia by validating questionnaires and examining the relationships between psychological factors and health outcomes.",

      "text": "1 \n \nCHAPTER ONE: GENERAL INTRODUCTION \n \nOverview \n     \n     In this introductory chapter, an overview is presented on the definitions, diagnostic \nchallenges, prevalence, and underlying mechanisms of hyperacusis and misophonia. \nHyperacusis is characterised by the perception of certain everyday sounds, such as household \nor environmental noises, as excessively loud or uncomfortable, leading to significant distress \nand disruption to daily activities, including social and occupational functioning. Different \nforms of hyperacusis have been identified: loudness hyperacusis, which involves perceiving \nspecific sounds (e.g., voices, traffic, or household appliances) as intolerably loud, sometimes \naccompanied by physical symptoms such as ear fullness or spasms; pain hyperacusis \n(noxacusis), where certain sounds trigger sensations of pain (e.g., stabbing, throbbing, or \nburning), even at levels below those known to cause cochlear damage; and fear hyperacusis \n(phonophobia), which is dominated by a fear of sounds due to concerns about their potential \nimpact, such as worsening tinnitus or hearing sensitivity. \n     Misophonia, in contrast, is defined by strong emotional, physiological, and behavioural \nreactions, such as anger, disgust, or anxiety, triggered by specific sounds. These are often \nsounds produced by humans (e.g., chewing, breathing) or objects (e.g., tapping, clock ticking), \nwhich are perceived as particularly aversive. Despite the overlap in some aspects, hyperacusis \nand misophonia have distinct triggers, responses, and underlying mechanisms, necessitating \ntailored approaches to their assessment.  \n     A systematic review conducted as part of this thesis examined existing hyperacusis and \nmisophonia questionnaires. This review later published (Kula et al., 2023) (see Chapter 2), \nevaluated the psychometric properties of widely used tools such as the Misophonia \nQuestionnaire (MQ), MisoQuest, and Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ) against the COSMIN"

Building on this review, \nthe thesis evaluates the English version of the MisoQuest, a 14-item questionnaire originally \ndeveloped in Polish to measure misophonia. This study establishes the psychometric properties \nof the English MisoQuest, including its reliability, validity, and factor structure, while also \nexploring its relationships with audiological and psychological variables such as hyperacusis \nand fatigue. Additionally, the thesis explores the broader psychological and health impacts of \nthese conditions, with a particular focus on the relationships between misophonia, fatigue, \nstress, and sleep quality. It further evaluates novel measurement tools aimed at assessing \nsymptom management confidence, particularly within the context of Cognitive Behavioral \nTherapy (CBT), emphasizing their clinical applicability and relevance. \n     Towards the conclusion of this chapter, the scope of this thesis is outlined, including a \nsystematic review and a series of empirical studies aimed at advancing the understanding and \nmeasurement of misophonia and hyperacusis. The subsequent chapters present a structured \napproach to addressing these gaps through systematic evaluations, psychometric validations, \nand new questionnaires validation. The rationale for each study is provided, alongside their \nspecific aims, to illustrate how this body of work contributes to field of hyperacusis and \nmisophonia and their relationship and assessment.  \nIntroduction to Misophonia \nDefinitions and Key Characteristics   \n     Misophonia is a condition characterised by intense negative emotional and physiological \nresponses to specific auditory and visual stimuli, often referred to as “triggers”. As noted by \nFerrer-Torres and Giménez-Llort (2022), the condition was initially identified in the late 1990s \nby audiologist Marsha Johson under the term “Sensitivity to Soft Sound” or “Selective Sound \nSensitivity Syndrome”. In 2002, Jastreboff and Jastreboff (2002) introduced the term"

Between June 2020 and January 2021, a multidisciplinary \ncommittee, including audiologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and neuroscientists, conducted \na systematic review of the existing literature using a modified Delphi method. Their aim was \nto establish a standardised definition of misophonia for the scientific community. The \ncommittee evaluated potential definitions based on clinical and scientific evidence, including \nonly those statements that achieved at least 80% agreement among its members. \nThe final definition, published by Swedo et al. (2022), defines misophonia as follows: \n     Misophonia is a disorder characterised by a heightened sensitivity and reduced tolerance \nto specific sounds or related stimuli, known as \"triggers\". These triggers are experienced as \nunpleasant or distressing and elicit strong emotional, physiological, and behavioural \nresponses that are atypical in most people. Misophonic reactions are not typically caused by \nthe loudness of sounds but by their particular pattern or meaning to the individual. Triggers \nare often repetitive and are frequently, though not exclusively, associated with sounds \nproduced by others, especially those made by the human body. Once a trigger is noticed, \nindividuals with misophonia may find it difficult to distract from it, resulting in significant \ndistress or impairment in areas such as social, occupational, or academic functioning. The \nseverity of symptoms can range from mild to severe, and some individuals with misophonia \nare aware that their reactions are disproportionate to the situation. Symptoms commonly \nemerge in childhood or early adolescence. \n    Key characteristics of misophonia include a range of emotional, physiological, and \nbehavioural responses to specific auditory (e.g., gum chewing, lip smacking or pen clicking) \nor visual cues (e.g., leg swinging) (Swedo et al., 2022). Emotional responses often involve \nintense anger, disgust, frustration, anxiety, or panic when exposed to these triggers (Holohan \net al., 2023, Savard et al., 2022). Behavioural responses may include avoidance of triggering"

Physiological symptoms associated \nwith misophonia include muscle tension, increased body temperature, elevated blood pressure, \nand a heightened heart rate (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018).  \n     These symptoms can significantly interfere with daily life, making it harder for individuals \nto maintain relationships, carry out work or studies, and take part in social activities. Over time, \nthis can lead to withdrawal and social isolation (Hadjipavlou et al., 2008). This is reflected in \na longitudinal study by Dibb and Golding (2022), which found that individuals with self-\nreported misophonia had significantly lower quality of life compared to the general population. \nBy interfering with daily functioning and social interactions, misophonia creates challenges \nthat extend beyond the distress caused by the triggers themselves.

Additionally, misophonia often co-occurs with other auditory and mental \nhealth disorders, leading to potential underdiagnosis or misclassification with other hearing-\nrelated conditions (Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2015).

These findings suggest that trigger sounds engage both auditory processing regions \nand the salience network, contributing to physiological arousal and emotional reactivity. \n    Further research indicates that misophonic reactions are not solely mediated by an auditory-\nlimbic response but involve higher-order mechanisms. For instance, Cerliani and Rouw (2020) \nidentified the involvement of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and its connections with the mid-\ncingulate cortex (MCC) and premotor areas, suggesting difficulties with emotional regulation. \nThese findings provide an explanation for the compulsive nature of misophonic reactions and \nhighlight the role of an indirect auditory-limbic pathway in interpreting the emotional \nsignificance of sounds rather than their physical characteristics. Eijsker et al. (2021) provided \nfurther evidence of structural abnormalities in misophonia, reporting increased white matter in \nthe left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), and the \ncorpus callosum. These findings suggest alterations in connectivity within networks associated \nwith social-emotional processing, particularly the recognition of facial affect, and attention to \naffective information.

Loudness hyperacusis occurs when \nordinary sounds at moderate levels, such as a restaurant noise, dog barking, sirens are perceived \nas overly loud, causing discomfort in routine situations. Annoyance hyperacusis involves a \nstrong negative emotional reaction to sounds, even if they are not perceived as loud, some argue \nthat this subtype may overlap with or describe misophonia instead (Enzler et al., 2021). Fear \nhyperacusis is characterised by anxiety or fear in response to certain sounds, potentially \noverlapping with phonophobia, highlighting the need to distinguish hyperacusis from both \nmisophonia and phonophobia by focusing on general discomfort versus reactions to specific \nsounds. Pain hyperacusis involves physical pain, such as stabbing sensations, in response to \nsounds below the typical pain threshold and may occur with sudden and loud noises or even \nloud speech. Although this classification may help in diagnosis and treatment, the subtypes are \nnot mutually exclusive, and individuals may experience features of more than one category. \nThe latest definition consensus on hyperacusis by Adams et al. (2021) highlighted that \nannoyance and fear were common features of the condition, but pain was reported less \nfrequently.  \n     Demographic studies have further showed the complicated nature of hyperacusis. \nAssociations with higher age, female gender, and higher education levels with hyperacusis are \nreported within the general population (Paulin et al., 2016).

According to Singh and Seidman (2019), hyperacusis can arise from infectious \ndiseases (e.g., Lyme disease, neurosyphilis), vascular abnormalities (e.g., aneurysms, Chiari \nmalformation), central nervous system disorders (e.g., PTSD, autism), and endocrine issues \n(e.g., Addison’s disease, hyperthyroidism). Disruption of the stapedial reflex, often following \ntraumatic brain injury (TBI), as well as medication withdrawal (e.g., benzodiazepines) or \nnutrient deficiencies (e.g., magnesium or pyridoxine), may also contribute. Additionally, \nhyperacusis is frequently associated with conditions such as tinnitus, head injury, Ménière’s \ndisease, Bell’s palsy, migraines, Williams syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder (Aazh et \nal., 2018).     \n     The prevalence of hyperacusis varies widely across different populations and studies, \nranging from 0.2% to 17.2% in the general population and from 4.7% to 95% among \nindividuals with conditions such as Williams Syndrome, tinnitus, and autism (Ren et al., 2021).  \nIn children and adolescents, Rosing et al.

This substantial variation in prevalence highlights the need for standardised diagnostic \ncriteria and consistent assessment methods to ensure reliable estimates and comparisons across \nstudies. \nUnderlying Mechanisms  \n     Hyperacusis arises from changes in the brain’s auditory processing, resulting in an increased \nsensitivity to everyday sounds.

However, this overcompensation can \nlead to normal sounds being perceived as uncomfortably loud (Auerbach et al., 2019).  \n     Functional imaging studies support this theory, revealing heightened activity in the auditory \ncortex, thalamus, and inferior colliculus among individuals with hyperacusis. These findings \npoint to hyperactivity within the central auditory system (Zeng, 2020). Koops and van Dijk \n(2021) further demonstrated that hyperacusis is associated with increased sound-evoked \nactivity in both subcortical and cortical auditory regions. Interestingly, this heightened activity \nwas not restricted to frequencies affected by hearing loss but extended to unaffected \nfrequencies. On the subcortical level, increased activity was observed in the medial geniculate \nbody (MGB), inferior colliculus (IC), and superior olivary complex (SOC), while cortical \nactivation was heightened in the primary, secondary, and association auditory cortices. These \nfindings emphasise that overactivity in the auditory pathway is a key feature of hyperacusis. \n     Hyperacusis may also involve non-auditory regions of the brain such as orbitofrontal cortex \n(OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and supplementary motor area (SMA), which are \nassociated with attention, emotional responses, and motor reactions to sound (Gu et al., 2010). \nInterestingly, hyperacusis shares similarities with neuropathic pain conditions, such as \nallodynia, where normal stimuli elicit exaggerated responses. This suggests that hyperacusis \naffects, not only auditory, but also broader sensory and emotional networks (de Klaver et al., \n2007). Wertz et al. (2024) recently also showed hyperacusis is associated with distinct brain \nactivity, including increased activation in the left temporoparietal and dorsolateral prefrontal \ncortices. This heightened activation may reflect increased attention to sound intensity across \nall frequencies, highlighting the unique neural mechanisms of hyperacusis and its distinction \nfrom tinnitus alone."

Misophonia is defined as a condition \ninvolving heightened emotional, physiological, and behavioural responses to specific auditory \nor visual triggers, often human-generated, such as chewing or pen-clicking (Swedo et al., \n2022). These triggers cause significant distress and functional impairment, with symptoms \ntypically beginning in childhood or adolescence (Ferrer-Torres and Giménez-Llort, 2022). The \ncondition is associated with difficulties in emotional regulation and neural hyperactivity, \nparticularly involving the anterior insular cortex (AIC) and salience networks (Kumar et al., \n2021). Misophonia frequently coexists with psychiatric conditions, including obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, and depression, and often overlaps with conditions such \nas hyperacusis (Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2015). However, its diagnostic criteria remain argued \ndue to uncertainty in its aetiology, and variations in measurement tools complicate accurate \nassessment. Recent psychometrically validated questionnaires, such as S-Five (Vitoratou et al., \n2021), Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (Rosenthal et al., 2021), Berlin Misophonia \nQuestionnaire (Remmert et al., 2022), which aim to capture the multidimensional nature of this \ncondition and improve diagnostic reliability, but there is no gold standard measure due to its \ncomplex mechanisms."

Diagnostic criteria for hyperacusis are not well-established; however, measures such as \nthe Uncomfortable Loudness Levels (ULLs) assessment tool, and tools like the Hyperacusis \nQuestionnaire [HQ; (Khalfa et al., 2002)] are commonly used. Researchers have suggested \nspecific criteria for identifying hyperacusis, including cut-off values of ULLmin ≤ 77 dB HL \nand a Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ) score ≥ 22 (Aazh and Moore, 2017). Additionally, \nnewer psychometrically validated instruments, such as the Hyperacusis Impact Questionnaire \n[HIQ; (Aazh et al., 2024a)] and Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire [SSSQ; (Aazh et \nal., 2024a)], [Hyperacusis Assessment Questionnaire; Raj-Koziak et al. (2023)] have been \ndeveloped to assess various dimensions of hyperacusis severity and its impact. \n    Various questionnaires have been developed to assess hyperacusis and misophonia, aiming \nto capture their severity, impact, and associated symptoms. However, the quality and \npsychometric robustness of these tools vary, with some lacking rigorous validation. To ensure \nreliable and valid assessments, it is essential to evaluate these questionnaires using standardised \ncriteria. Among the frameworks designed for this purpose, the COSMIN (Mokkink et al., 2018) \nis recognised as the gold standard for assessing the methodological quality of health \nmeasurement instruments."

COSMIN identifies three key domains for evaluation: reliability, validity, and \nresponsiveness (Mokkink et al., 2018). The validity domain comprises face and content \nvalidity, criterion validity (both concurrent and predictive), and construct validity. Construct \nvalidity includes studies employing classical hypothesis testing as well as those examining the \ndimensional structure of an instrument (also referred to as structural validity).

Misophonia is defined as a high magnitude of \nemotional and behavioural reaction to certain sounds produced by human beings, such as eating \nsounds and breathing sounds. Several psychometric instruments have been developed to assess \nsymptoms and the impact of hyperacusis and misophonia; however, to the author's knowledge, \nno study has evaluated and compared the methodological quality of the studies on psychometric \nproperties of the existing instruments.  \nPurpose:  This article systematically reviews the research studies assessing the psychometric \nproperties of the instruments used for hyperacusis and misophonia and assess the quality and \nappropriateness of the methodologies used. \nResearch Design:  Systematic review.   \nData Collection and Analysis: A systematic literature search was performed using five \nelectronic literature databases (PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Google Scholar and Web of \nScience).

Other definitions of hyperacusis are \nlargely in agreement with this definition, with some differences in details (Adams et al., 2020, \nAazh et al., 2016). Tyler et al. (2014) described four categories of hyperacusis comprising (1) \nloudness hyperacusis, (2) fear hyperacusis, (3) pain hyperacusis, and (4) annoyance \nhyperacusis. There is some overlap between annoyance hyperacusis and misophonia. A recent \nconsensus study described that misophonia is characterized by the experience of unpleasant or \ndistressing emotions when exposed to certain sounds generated by another individual, \nespecially (but not exclusively) those produced by the human body (Swedo et al., 2022). In \nmisophonia, the specific pattern or meaning of the sound to the individual as opposed to its \nloudness seem to be the key contributing factor to the individual's reaction. Individuals with \nmisophonia often experience suffering, distress or cannot tolerate sounds associated with oral \nfunctions (e.g., chewing, eating), nasal sounds (e.g., breathing and sniffing), as well as non-\noral/nasal sounds (e.g., pen clicking, keyboard typing, clock ticking) (Swedo et al., 2022). \n     Prevalence estimates range from 2% to 15.2% for hyperacusis (Andersson et al., 2002, Smit \net al., 2021) and 6% to 49.1% for misophonia (Zhou et al., 2017, Naylor et al., 2021, Wu et al., \n2014). It is likely that the discrepancy in prevalence reports is related the differences in study \npopulations and the way that hyperacusis and misophonia were assessed and diagnosed.  \n    Several psychometric instruments have been developed and applied in research and clinical \npractice to evaluate hyperacusis and/or misophonia. The methodologies used to design and \nevaluate the psychometric properties of these instruments (e.g., validity, reliability, sensitivity \nto change) are very diverse. The two important psychometric properties are reliability and \nvalidity which are essential for choosing suitable instruments for research or clinical purposes \n(Sürücü and Maslakci, 2020). Reliability comprises measures of internal consistency (degree"

Validity is defined as the extent \nto which an instrument measures what it claims to measure (Altheide and Johnson, 1994) and \ncomprises (1) content validity (the degree to which the questions on the instrument represent \nthe construct that it seeks to measure (Creswell, 2002), (2) construct validity (the extent to \nwhich the instrument validly measures the construct it purports to measure), (3) structural \nvalidity (the degree to which the scores of the instrument is an adequate reflection of the \ndimensionality of the construct to be measured), (4) hypotheses testing (the degree to which \nscores on the instrument are consistent with hypothesized relationship with other instruments), \n(5) cross-cultural validity (the degree to which items on a translated or adapted measure \ncorrespond to the performance of the original items), and (6) criterion validity (the degree to \nwhich scores correspond with a gold standard measure).  \n     Studies assessing the psychometric properties of hyperacusis and misophonia instruments \nhave used inconsistent methods.  For example, participants in some studies were recruited from \nhospital patient referrals (Aazh et al., 2021, Bläsing et al., 2010, Fioretti et al., 2015) while \nothers from the general population or university students (Khalfa et al., 2002, Naylor et al., \n2021). Some of these instruments are validated in languages other than English and the English \nversions although published, have not been validated (Siepsiak et al., 2020). In addition, among \nthe published papers there are some discrepancies regarding reporting of the important \npsychometric properties of the instruments they evaluated or developed. As the result of these \ndiscrepancies, it may not be clear to many audiologists whether the psychometric properties of \nthe existing hyperacusis and misophonia questionnaires meet the standards required for them \nto be used effectively in research and/or clinical practice."

The COSMIN checklist is a well-known tool and has been developed in conjunction \nwith other existing guidelines for systematic reviews, such as the Cochrane Handbook for \nsystematic reviews of intervention (Johnston et al., 2019), the PRISMA statement (Shamseer \net al., 2015) and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Emulation \n(GRADE) principles. \n     To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to evaluate the measurement properties \nof instruments designed to measure hyperacusis or misophonia across a range of healthcare \ncontexts and settings. This review identified eight measures (five for hyperacusis and three for \nmisophonia) and 14 studies on the psychometric properties of these instruments. In general, \nthe methodological quality of the included studies in this review varied between “very good” \nand “inadequate” across all psychometric properties based on the COSMIN tool. None of the \nidentified instruments has reported all nine psychometric properties recommended by \nCOSMIN.    \nThe Methodological Quality of the Included Studies and Psychometric Properties of the \nInstruments  \n     According to the COSMIN guideline (2018), content validity is considered an important \nmeasurement property of an instrument. However, none of the included articles reported using \nadequate methods to assess content validity. One explanation is that the constructs of \nhyperacusis and misophonia are not fully understood. Therefore, it was not possible to rate this \nfollowing the COSMIN recommendation; however, all the questions within the various"

When reviewing the \nitems in the questionnaires, appeared that they were all the items were measuring the construct \nthey purport to and had good content validity from our perspective. In addition, the \nquestionnaires have been designed by clinicians and/or researchers working with patients who \nexperience hyperacusis and/or misophonia, so they were in a good position to create relevant \nitems.  \n     In terms of structural validity, six studies did not report any psychometric data. The rest of \nthe studies methodological quality for structural validity varies between “very good” and \n“inadequate” according to COSMIN risk of bias checklist assessment. This mainly was due to \nstudies only reporting exploratory factor analysis (EFA) without confirmative factor analysis \n(CFA). To test the factor structure, CFA or item response theory (IRT) analysis are preferred \naccording to the COSMIN checklist (Mokkink et al., 2018).  \n     None of the instruments reported on all three psychometric properties within the domain of \nreliability (reliability, internal consistency, and measurement error). Only one measurement \ninstrument (MisoQuest) reported reliability with measuring interclass correlation coefficient \n(ICC), while all instruments reported internal consistency with receiving a very good score for \nstudy quality. Although measurement error is clinically important because as more error is \nintroduced into the score, the lower reliability will be, only one article that tested MisoQuest \nreported it.   \n     None of the studies reported information on criterion validity. As there is no universally \naccepted gold standard to measure hyperacusis and misophonia, this feature of criterion validity \ncould not be reported in this review.

Only four studies (Aazh et al., 2021, Bläsing et al., \n2010, Greenberg and Carlos, 2018, Meeus et al., 2010), reported both convergent and \ndiscriminant validity according to COSMIN risk of bias assessment. Except for these four \nstudies, the remaining studies had limited evidence for construct validity.   \n     Table 5 gives information about the results of each study on the different measurement \nproperties, and it was rated as sufficient (+), insufficient (-), or indeterminate (?) following \nCOSMIN criteria for good measurement properties. There is insufficient evidence within the \nincluded papers to making a judgment on their overall quality. Therefore, we chose not to \nsummarize the results and thus not to grade the total level of evidence per psychometric \ninstruments.  \n     There are some other hyperacusis questionnaires used in clinics and research, but these were \nnot reviewed as their relevant publications did not provide the psychometric properties required \nby COSMIN. One questionnaire, for example, is the Multiple-Activity-Scale for Hyperacusis \n(MASH), by Dauman and Bouscau-Faure (2005). The development procedure and metrics \nwere not reported in this paper, so it was not possible to review its psychometric properties.  \n    Several newly developed hyperacusis and misophonia questionnaires were not included in \nthis review as the results of their psychometric properties were not published in a peer-review \njournal at the time our literature search (Aazh et al., 2022, Rosenthal et al., 2021, Dibb et al., \n2021). Therefore, it was not possible to evaluate them with the COSMIN checklist in this \nreview. Future reviews should assess the questionnaires which were published from April \n2021."

Clinicians desiring to select measures for clinical use should consider \nhow generalizable the results are to the intended population, taking into account the populations \nfrom which the data in these studies were generated. For example, IHS (Greenberg and Carlos, \n2018) appears to be internally consistent in both clinical and non-clinical populations. The \nMisoQuest (Siepsiak et al., 2020) is internally consistent for the clinical population.  \nHyperacusis Questionnaire originally developed by Khalfa et al. (2002) was internally \nconsistent for just general population and Fackrell et al. (2015) investigated the validity and \nreliability of the HQ in a population who had tinnitus. They found the HQ to have high internal \nconsistency (Cronbach`s alpha= 0.88) but confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the \nproposed three-factor, and an alternative one-factor structure were poor. Therefore, HQ does \nnot seem to work well within a tinnitus population. Future studies should endeavour to use \nclinical population of patients with hyperacusis or misophonia when developing \nquestionnaires.  \nImplications for Future Research  \n     Given the recent measures being adapted for use in other countries and languages, we \nbelieve that there is a need for appropriate and more testing for cross-cultural validity. Studies \nwith different cultural groups should perform factor analyses for multiple groups and complete \nmeasurement invariance or DIF (differential item functioning) to give information on whether \nthe measures are equivalent when used in different cultures/languages. For example, \nMisoQuest was developed in Polish, and validation has only been performed in a Polish \npopulation. Therefore, for future directions, validation and cross-cultural evaluation of \nMisoQuest are needed for other countries and different languages.  \n    Regarding structural validity, future studies should perform factor analyses using CFA \n(confirmatory factor analysis) or IRT (item response theory) for seven instruments (HQ, IHS,"

Measurement error also need to be assessed for all eight instruments.   \n    We also believe that future studies measuring content validity should state more explicitly \nhow they evaluated content validity and follow COSMIN criteria when developing and \nreporting a new measure. This may include exploring the relevance, comprehensiveness, and \ncomprehensibility of the measure among a sufficient sample of participants and professionals, \nwhich could lead to more credible evidence of its content validity.  \n     All the available questionnaires regarding hyperacusis and misophonia are designed for \nadults and therefore may not be appropriate for use in children and adolescents.

      "text": "61 \n \n1. INTRODUCTION \n     Misophonia is characterised by profound emotional, physiological and behavioral reactions \ntowards specific sounds or visual stimuli, as defined by Swedo et al. (2022). Common triggers \nfor misophonia involve sounds produced by others, particularly those linked to oral functions \n(e.g., chewing, eating), nasal sounds (e.g., breathing and sniffing) and repetitive sounds such \nas tapping or clicking. When individuals with misophonia are exposed to the trigger sounds, \nthey often experience emotional reactions (e.g., anger and irritation), bodily sensations (e.g., \nincreased heart rate and tense muscles), and behavioral responses (e.g., avoidance and \naggressive behaviors, asking people to stop making the noise) (Jager et al., 2020, Dibb et al., \n2021, Edelstein et al., 2013). The prevalence of clinical misophonia (i.e., people for whom \nsymptoms of misophonia cause a significant burden) has been reported in 18.4% of a \nrepresentative sample of the UK adult population (Vitoratou et al., 2023). However, in the US, \na recent study by Dixon et al. (2024) found that 4.6% of the adult population experience clinical \nlevels of misophonia.  \n     Research indicates that misophonia is frequently associated with conditions such as \nobsessive-compulsive disorder and trauma-related disorders (Wu et al., 2014, Schröder et al., \n2013). Approximately 28% of individuals diagnosed with misophonia also exhibit one or more \npsychiatric disorders (Jager et al., 2020). Misophonia co-occurs with a diverse range of anxiety \ndisorders, with nearly 57% of sampled participants meeting the criteria for at least one anxiety-\nrelated disorder (Rosenthal et al., 2022). It is estimated that 12% of misophonia patients also \nexperience tinnitus, with 4% of them also presenting hyperacusis (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018). \nSome studies have suggested that individuals with misophonia also report hearing loss (Enzler \net al., 2021b, Siepsiak et al., 2022, Aazh et al., 2022). Dibb and Golding (2022) reported that \nindividuals with misophonia have difficulties in emotional well-being and social functioning."

The MisoQuest questionnaire, consisting of 14 items, was initially \nvalidated in a Polish sample (Siepsiak et al., 2022). However, a recent systematic review by \nKula et al. (2023) emphasized the need for further evaluation of MisoQuest’s psychometric \nproperties, especially within an English-speaking population, using the COSMIN framework \n(Mokkink et al., 2018).  \n     This study aims to validate the English version of the MisoQuest by evaluating its structural \nvalidity, reliability, measurement error, and convergent and discriminant validity according to \nCOSMIN standards (Mokkink et al., 2018). Our data collection involved a three-stage \napproach. Initially, participants engaged in an online survey, completing the measurements at \ntwo separate points two weeks apart. A subsample of participants who completed both stages \nof the survey were invited to the third stage, which was an interview to complete the same \nsurvey, using identical measures, but this time administered by the researcher. More details are \nprovided in the methods section. \n    Based on existing research, we hypothesised the following for the validation of the English \nMisoQuest. While Siepsiak et al. (2020) performed a confirmatory analysis using Graded \nResponse Model to confirm the factor structure of the MisoQuest, they did not use \nConfirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Although measurement error was addressed in the \noriginal study, our study focuses on analysing the standard error of measurement. Furthermore, \nboth convergent and discriminant validity are examined, aspects not fully explored in the initial \nvalidation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n2.1 Ethics approval and consent to participate. \n    Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the University of Surrey Research Integrity \nand Governance Office (Reference: FHMS-21 22 083 EGA).  All participants provided online \nconsent after being informed about the study's objectives, procedures, and their right to \nwithdraw at any time. \n2.2 Participants      \n    The sample size was determined based on a 25:1 participant-to-item ratio for the MisoQuest \nquestionnaire, resulting in a minimum target of 350 participants (Hair et al., 2019). Although \nsome scholars recommend a minimum ratio of 5:1 (Comrey and Lee, 2013), a larger sample \nsize can improve factor stability and result generalizability. For test-retest reliability, a \nminimum of 100 participants were required to minimize statistical error and improve reliability \nestimates (COSMIN guidelines; Mokkink et al. (2018).  \n    The survey link was distributed via university email lists, social media (Instagram, X), and \nthe Hashir International Specialist Clinics’ online newsletter. Additionally, it was shared within \nFacebook support groups and through nonprofit organizations (e.g., SoQuiet). From 475 initial \nrespondents, only those who passed an attention check and met standard response time criteria \nwere included in the analysis, yielding a final sample of 451.

Nonetheless, since these \nadjustments were data-driven rather than theory-based, they might suggest potential \nmultidimensionality within the measure. Subsequent reassessment using the WLSMV \nestimator, which accounts for the ordinal nature of the data, yielded improved yet still adequate \nfit compared to the modified ML model, with persistent evidence of multidimensionality. \nThese findings highlight that further adjustments may be needed in future studies to better align \nthe model with theoretical support.  \n     The internal consistency of the English version of MisoQuest with Cronbach's α and \nMcDonald's ω of 0.93, closely aligns with the original scale developer's reported Cronbach's α \nof 0.96 by Siepsiak et al.

Our study found a test-retest reliability ICC value of \n0.89 for the English version of MisoQuest, slightly higher than the original developer's reported \nvalue of 0.84, indicating strong consistency in responses over a two-week period.        \n     While Siepsiak et al. (2020a) addressed measurement error in the original Polish version of \nMisoQuest, and Raymond and Butler (2024) have previously examined convergent and \ndiscriminant validity in the English version, our study provides a comprehensive psychometric \nanalysis following COSMIN standards. This approach offers a robust evaluation of the English \nMisoQuest, supporting its suitability for clinical and research applications. \n      Our examination of convergent validity showed moderate to strong correlations between \nMisoQuest scores and those from AMISOS-R, MIQ, and SS4, indicating that these instruments \nassess related constructs. However, discrepancies were observed in the proportion of \nparticipants diagnosed with misophonia across these tools, which relates to diagnostic or \ndifferential validity rather than convergent validity. Specifically, AMISOS-R identified a \nhigher prevalence than both MisoQuest and MIQ, likely due to differences in design and \nconceptual frameworks. Each tool approaches misophonia measurement uniquely: AMISOS-\nR focuses on experiences triggered in the past three days, MisoQuest has no specified \ntimeframe, and MIQ assesses the impact of misophonia on patients' lives over a two-week \nperiod. Therefore, these differences reflect the diverse approaches used in each questionnaire. \nFuture studies should explore whether a distinction between misophonia as a trait or a disorder \ncan be made using MisoQuest and AMISOS-R and how these might be related to the impact \nof misophonia on the patient’s life measured via MIQ.   \n     The English version of MisoQuest demonstrates reasonably good discriminant validity, as \nevidenced by its weak correlations with tinnitus impact, hearing loss, sleep, stress, depression, \nand anxiety. However, there was a moderate correlation between MisoQuest and HIQ that \nassesses hyperacusis. This means that MisoQuest may be influenced by hyperacusis symptoms."

One explanation is that HIQ may be influenced by misophonia in addition to \nhyperacusis. However, this is unlikely as Aazh et al. (2024d) reported that the mean of HIQ \nscore among patients with misophonia was 8.8 (SD=8.2) compared with 18.5 (SD=6.9) among \npatients with hyperacusis. This indicates that HIQ is reasonably specific in differentiating the \nimpact of hyperacusis from misophonia. Another explanation for the moderate relationship \nobserved between MisoQuest and HIQ is a possible overlap between misophonia and one form \nof hyperacusis (i.e., annoyance hyperacusis). According to Tyler et al. (2014) hyperacusis has \nfour subtypes: loudness hyperacusis, pain hyperacusis, annoyance hyperacusis, and fear \nhyperacusis. Previous studies also suggest possible relationship or comorbidity between \nhyperacusis and misophonia (Aazh et al., 2022a, Aazh et al., 2023).  \n     The English version of MisoQuest indicated a moderated correlation with fatigue measure \n(3D-WFI). This result is consistent with findings from Dibb and Golding (2022), who also \nreported a moderate correlation between misophonia and fatigue.

In terms of mental health, we \nobserved a weak correlation between misophonia and anxiety-depression, differing from the \nmoderate correlation reported by Wu et al.

(2003), may not fully capture more complex, multidimensional constructs \nsuch as stress.  \n     Lastly, we did not measure responsiveness to change for MisoQuest, which refers to ability  \nto detect changes over time in the construct (Mokkink et al., 2018). Therefore, further research \nis needed to measure changes in MisoQuest scores before and after any intervention.  \nConclusions  \n    The English MisoQuest is a reliable and valid tool for assessing misophonia in English-\nspeaking populations for both research and clinical use. High reliability was indicated by \nCronbach’s α and McDonald’s ω values of 0.93. CFA results showed a multidimensional factor \nstructure, and the model demonstrated adequate fit. Test-retest reliability was strong, with an \nICC of 0.89, factor loadings between 0.62 and 0.76, and item reliability (R²) values from 0.38 \nto 0.58. Convergent validity was shown through moderate to strong correlations with related \nmeasures (AMISOS-R, MIQ), while discriminant validity was supported by weak correlations \nwith distinct constructs (TIQ, HHI, sleep, stress, and SAD-T). One limitation is the moderate \ncorrelation with HIQ, a hyperacusis measure, suggesting a need for future studies to further \nexplore the relationship between misophonia and hyperacusis and to refine psychometric tools \nfor their differentiation.   \nAcknowledgements: This project was part of the first author’s PhD thesis at University of \nSurrey which is funded by the Ministry of National Education of the Republic of Turkey for \nsupporting her graduate education.

Participants completed assessments for \nmisophonia (MisoQuest), fatigue (3D-WFI), hyperacusis (HIQ), sleep quality (SQS), stress, \nand anxiety/depression (SAD-T). \nResults: Correlation analysis showed a positive relationship between misophonia severity and \nfatigue (r = 0.32, p < 0.01). Further, multiple regression analysis indicated that misophonia, \nsleep quality, and stress were significant predictors of fatigue, while hyperacusis, anxiety, and \ndepression were not. Mediation analysis also revealed that stress and sleep quality partially \nmediated the relationship between misophonia and fatigue ( p < 0.01 for both). \nConclusions:  The severity of misophonia is correlated with fatigue, with stress and sleep \nquality identified as partial mediators. These findings suggest that addressing stress and \nimproving sleep may reduce fatigue in those with misophonia. Future studies should explore \ninterventions targeting these mediating factors."

      "text": "91 \n \n1. Introduction      \n      Fatigue is a complex and subjective sensation characterized by persistent feeling of \nexhaustion, lack of energy, or weakness that can occur during or after usual activities (Cornuz \net al., 2006). Unlike tiredness, which is a common and short-lived experience that often \ndisappears after rest, fatigue is not relieved by rest and can significantly impact physical, \ncognitive, and emotional functioning, making it difficult to perform daily tasks (Galland-\nDecker et al., 2019, Dittner et al., 2004, Ream and Richardson, 1996). Due to its chronic nature \nand significant impact on well-being, fatigue is an important concern in clinical practice and \nresearch. \n     Misophonia is a condition where individuals are abnormally sensitive to stimuli or specific \ntypes of sounds, known as triggers, such as chewing, breathing, or tapping (Swedo et al., 2022). \nThese sounds can provoke intense emotional and behavioural reactions, including anger, \nanxiety and a strong desire to escape from these trigger sounds (Schröder et al., 2013). A \nlongitudinal study by Dibb and Golding (2022) investigated the relationship between \nmisophonia as measured using the Misophonia Response Scale (MRS) (Dibb et al., 2021) and \nfatigue as measured via the quality-of-life domain of the SF-36 (Framework, 1992). The study \nreported that individuals with self-reported misophonia (n=491) had significantly lower scores \nin the energy/fatigue domain of the SF-36 compared to those without misophonia (n=503), and \nthis relationship remained consistent over time. However, their study did not account for \npossible confounding factors such as hyperacusis, stress, sleep, and anxiety/depression, which \ncould have influenced the observed relationship between misophonia and fatigue.   \n     Hyperacusis often overlaps with misophonia, complicating the experiences of those affected \n(Danesh and Aazh, 2020). Individuals with hyperacusis may find normal environmental sounds \nunbearably loud or even painful, significantly impacting their quality of life (Aazh et al., 2018). \nThe relationship between misophonia and hyperacusis is complex and not fully understood,"

(2022a) found that 23% of the 257 tinnitus and/ or hyperacusis patients reported misophonia \nsymptoms. Furthermore, the likelihood of experiencing misophonia increased with the severity \nof hyperacusis. Brennan et al. (2024) revealed significant strong correlations between \nmisophonia, as measured by the Misophonia Questionnaire (Wu et al., 2014), and hyperacusis, \nas measured by the Hyperacusis Questionnaire (Khalfa et al., 2002), among undergraduate and \ngraduate students. Fatigue is a common symptom reported by patients with hyperacusis and \nitems related to fatigue are included to most hyperacusis questionnaires (Greenberg and Carlos, \n2018, Aazh et al., 2024a). Paulin et al. (2016) found that hyperacusis is comorbid with \nconditions such as exhaustion and chronic fatigue syndrome, suggesting that hyperacusis may \ncontribute to both physical and mental exhaustion in those affected. Given the relationship \nbetween hyperacusis and misophonia, the connection between misophonia and fatigue reported \nby Dibb and Golding (2022) could have been influenced by hyperacusis. Since they did not \nassess hyperacusis, it remains unclear whether hyperacusis might have confounded their \nresults.  \n       Although studies assessing sleep disturbances among patients with misophonia are limited, \npoor sleep quality is a well-established contributor to fatigue (Lavidor et al., 2003). Some case \nstudies suggest that people with misophonia often experience insomnia or poor sleep quality \n(Gowda and Avidan, 2023), but the specific relationship between sleep disturbances and \nmisophonia, particularly whether these disturbances contribute to experience of fatigue in this \npopulation, has not been examined.  \n     Stress can also play a key role in the relationship between misophonia and fatigue, as stress \nis a known contributor to both emotional distress and fatigue (Kop and Kupper, 2016).  People \nwith misophonia often experience high levels of stress when exposed to trigger sounds, which \nincreases their emotional and physical reactions (Rouw and Erfanian, 2018). Recent research"

The stress and increased arousal may worsen \nthe experience of fatigue (Kocalevent et al., 2011). In addition, stress can lead to the \ndevelopment or exacerbation of hyperacusis leading to further experience of exhaustion and \nfatigue (Hasson et al., 2013). Therefore, it is important to explore if stress impacts the \nrelationship between misophonia and fatigue.  \n     Research shows that anxiety and depression frequently co-occur with misophonia and are \nknown to be associated with the experience of fatigue (Wu et al., 2014, Guetta et al., 2022, \nRoy-Byrne et al., 2002). However, whether anxiety and depression contribute to the observed \nrelationship between misophonia, and fatigue reported by Dibb and Golding (2022) has not \nbeen explored.  \n     To sum up, there is a need to explore whether stress, hyperacusis, sleep quality, anxiety and \ndepression influence the relationship between misophonia and fatigue.

The MisoQuest was developed and validated in Polish by \nSiepsiak et al. (2020a). It has been found to have good validity and reliability among English \nspeakers by Kula et al. (2024).  \n     Three-dimensional fatigue inventory [3D-WFI; Frone and Tidwell (2015)] was used to \nassess the participant`s level of fatigue. The 3D-WFI consists of 3 dimensions with 18 items \nthat assess people's responses to emotional, mental, and physical fatigue aspects of their daily \nliving. A 5-point Likert scale is used to assess each of the items with options ranging from 1 \n(every day) to 5 (never). The possible total scores range from 18 to 90. The 3D-WFI has good \ninternal consistency (Cronbach`s alpha coefficient was 0.94 for physical fatigue, .95 for mental \nfatigue, and .96 for emotional fatigue (Frone and Tidwell, 2015)).   \n     Hyperacusis was assessed through the Hyperacusis Impact Questionnaire [HIQ; (Aazh et \nal., 2024a)] which consists of eight 4-point self-reported items designed to assess the impact \nof hyperacusis on individuals. Each item involves assigning a score of 0, 1, 2, or 3 based on \nresponse categories indicating 0 to 1 day, 2 to 6 days, 7 to 10 days, and 11 to 14 days, \nrespectively. The cumulative score ranges from 0 to 24, with scores of twelve or more \nindicating a clinically significant impact of hyperacusis. The validity and reliability of the HIQ \nhave been demonstrated in preceding studies (Aazh et al., 2024a).  \n     Sleep quality was assessed by the one-item Sleep Quality Scale (Snyder et al., 2018a) for \nsleep where 0 indicated terrible sleep and 10 indicated excellent sleep quality. In terms of stress, \na single-item measure of stress symptoms (Elo et al., 2003) was used to measure stress \nexperience. The scores range from 1 to 5, where higher scores connect with increased levels of \nstress. Single-item measures are often used in the research for their simplicity and validity \n(Allen et al., 2022)."

The results indicate that misophonia is a strongly \nassociated with fatigue, even when the effects of hyperacusis, anxiety, depression, sleep \nquality, and stress are taken into consideration. Although sleep quality and stress were found \nto partially mediate this relationship, misophonia continued to exhibit a strong and significant \ndirect effect on fatigue.  \n     Dibb and Golding (2022) similarly found that people with misophonia experience higher \nlevels of fatigue. Our study extends these findings by showing that the link between misophonia \nand fatigue remains strong even after accounting for other factors like stress, sleep problems, \nand mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression.  \n     Our results showed a positive, moderate relationship between misophonia as measured by \nMisoQuest (Kula et al., 2024) and hyperacusis, as measured by HIQ (Aazh et al., 2024a). This \nfinding is consistent with previous studies, such as Jager et al. (2020) and Brennan et al. (2024), \nwhich also reported an association between these two conditions.  \n      We found a positive moderate correlation between anxiety and depression symptoms in \nindividuals with misophonia, which aligns with previous research (Wu et al., 2014, Aazh et al., \n2023, Siepsiak et al., 2020b). However, Quek et al. (2018) did not find a significant correlation \nbetween depression and misophonia in a sample of psychiatric patients, suggesting that the \nrelationship may vary depending on the sample or methodology used. Interestingly, we \nobserved a stronger correlation between hyperacusis (measured via the HIQ) and symptoms of \nanxiety/depression (as measured by SAD-T) compared to the correlation between misophonia \n(measured via MisoQuest) and these mental health symptoms. To our knowledge, no previous \nstudies have directly compared the strength of these relationships.

This supports our observation that hyperacusis may provoke greater \nanxiety and depression, whereas misophonia may be more strongly linked with emotions such \nas anger and disgust. These findings point to the need for further research to understand the  \ncomplex relationship between misophonia, hyperacusis and mental health conditions.         \n      The findings of this study have significant implications for clinical practice, particularly \nfor healthcare providers working with patients who have misophonia. Given the strong \nassociation between misophonia and fatigue, it is crucial that clinicians assess not only the \nsymptoms of misophonia but also related factors such as fatigue, sleep quality, and stress levels. \nInterventions that address these issues could be particularly beneficial. Future research should \nexplore whether improving stress and sleep quality can reduce the experience of fatigue and \nsymptoms of misophonia.     \n     Research has demonstrated that Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective in \nreducing the effect of misophonia symptoms (Jager et al., 2021, Gregory and Foster, 2023, \nAazh et al., 2024c). Including strategies to address sleep disturbances and stress within CBT \ncould further enhance its effectiveness in improving fatigue associated with misophonia. By \nintegrating these evidence-based treatments, clinicians can more comprehensively address both \nthe direct and indirect contributors to fatigue in individuals with misophonia and improve \npatients’ overall quality of life. \n     In the regression analysis, which controls for other predictor variables within the model, age \ndid not have an independent effect on fatigue.

The cross-sectional design, which \ncaptures data at a single point in time, does not allow us to determine cause and effect.

      "text": "117 \n \n1. Introduction \n    Hyperacusis and misophonia are both classified as disorders of Decreased Sound Tolerance \n(DST) that negatively affects quality of life (Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2015). Hyperacusis is \ncharacterised by an increased sensitivity to everyday sounds, such as household or \nenvironmental noises, perceived as excessively loud or painful, leading to significant distress \nand interference with daily life, including social, occupational, and recreational activities (Aazh \net al., 2016, Aazh et al., 2024b). People with hyperacusis experience negative reactions to \nsounds based on their physical aspects, such as volume or frequency, often perceiving ordinary \nnoises as intolerably loud (Salvi et al., 2022). Although there is no consensus on precise \ndefinitions, Tyler et al. (2014) proposed four types of hyperacusis are generally recognised in \nthe literature: loudness hyperacusis, where every day sounds seem excessively loud; annoyance \nhyperacusis, which produces negative emotional reactions to sounds; fear hyperacusis, where \nsounds provoke avoidance behaviours due to fear; and pain hyperacusis, where sounds cause \nphysical pain in the ears or surrounding areas like the face and neck. Prevalence estimates \nindicate that 15.2% of adults aged 45 to 70 experience symptoms of hyperacusis (Smit et al., \n2021a).  \n     Misophonia involves intense negative emotional, behavioural, and physical reactions to \nspecific sounds (such as chewing or tapping) or stimuli, and is characterised by a reduced \ntolerance to these sounds, which may include oral, nasal, non-oral/ nasal sounds from people, \nas well as sounds produced by objects or animals (Swedo et al., 2022). The prevalence of \nindividuals in the UK for whom misophonia symptoms cause a significant burden in their lives \nhas been estimated at 18% (Vitoratou et al., 2023).  \n     Existing hyperacusis and misophonia questionnaires, such as the Duke Misophonia \nQuestionnaire (Rosenthal et al., 2021), MisoQuest (Siepsiak et al., 2020a), and Hyperacusis \nImpact Questionnaire (Aazh et al., 2024a) often include items with language reflecting"

For example, the DMQ includes items such as “ I hate being \nlike this,” and “I thought about physically hurting the person making the sound ,” illustrating \nboth negativity and anger in response to trigger sounds. MisoQuest further emphasises anger \nand struggle with items like “ I start feeling anger the moment I see a thing/animal/person that \nmight make an unpleasant sound ” and “I believe that my reactions to sounds are exaggerated, \nbut I can’t get rid of them ”. Similarly, the HIQ has items such as “ Feeling anxious when \nhearing loud noises ” and “difficulty in carrying out certain day-to-day activities/ tasks in noisy \nplaces”, framing the condition as a source of continuous struggle. By contrast, the 4C \nHyperacusis and Misophonia Management Questionnaires use language that promotes \nacceptance, ability, and confidence. Rather than focusing on challenges caused by symptoms, \nthese questionnaires include items such as “ How confident are you that you can enjoy your life \nfully despite your hyperacusis or misophonia? ” and “How confident are you that you can do \nall of the above without using any avoidance behaviour? ” This constructive approach \nencourages individuals to focus on their strengths and their ability to manage their condition. \n     Patients with hyperacusis and misophonia often do not prioritise therapies like cognitive \nbehavioural therapy (CBT) as their first option for managing their condition, despite evidence \nsupporting its effectiveness by Jager et al. (2021). Instead, many initially prefer medical \nsolutions, hoping for a definitive cure. When no medical solution is available, they frequently \nrely on avoidance and ritualistic behaviours to cope. These behaviours might include overusing \near protection, avoiding social situations, leading clear of specific environments or individuals, \nor instructing others to reduce noise. While these strategies may offer temporary relief, they \ncan limit long-term adaptation. Shifting from these avoidance behaviours to engaging in \ntherapy often requires a significant adjustment. A key obstacle is patients’ lack of confidence \nin their ability to replace these familiar coping mechanisms with new approaches. For instance, \na person with misophonia may feel, “I cannot control my anger even with CBT; it is easier to"

Therefore, tools that foster \nconfidence and motivation are essential for facilitating this transition. Building on similar \nchallenges identified in tinnitus management, the 4C Tinnitus Management Questionnaire was \ndeveloped by Aazh et al. (2024d) to measure patients’ confidence in managing tinnitus within \na CBT framework. Its psychometric evaluation demonstrated excellent reliability (Cronbach’s \nalpha = 0.91) and validity, establishing it as a robust tool to assess confidence. Following this \napproach, the 4C Hyperacusis and Misophonia Management Questionnaires were developed \nat the Hashir Research Institute for Misophonia, Tinnitus and Hyperacusis in the UK. These \nquestionnaires aim to assess patients' confidence in managing their symptoms and to support \naudiologists and clinicians in treatment planning, particularly in the context of CBT. \n     The 4C Hyperacusis and Misophonia Management Questionnaires were designed with two \nmain goals. Firstly, it uses language that encourages patients to focus on their ability to manage \nthe challenges of sound sensitivity. This approach is based on principles from motivational \ninterviewing and self-determination theory, which suggest that fostering a sense of autonomy \nand capability can increase motivation and engagement in therapy (Markland et al., 2005). For \nexample, the 4C Hyperacusis Management Questionnaire includes items such as, “ How \nconfident are you that you are able to carry out your day-to-day tasks despite your \nhyperacusis? ”, Similarly, the 4C Misophonia Management Questionnaires include items like \n“How confident are you that you are able to socialise and relax even when you hear the trigger \nnoises?” By prompting patients to reflect on their confidence in coping with their symptoms, \nthe 4C aims to strengthen their intrinsic motivation to participate in therapy and to explore \nways to lead completing exists despite hyperacusis and misophonia. Secondly, the 4C \ndifferentiates between patients who are confident in managing their symptoms without relying"

This \ndistinction is important for tailoring interventions that address specific coping methods and \nencourage more adaptive responses to sound triggers (Britton et al., 2011).  \n     The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the 4C Hyperacusis \nand Misophonia Management Questionnaires by examining their construct validity, reliability, \nand structural validity, including both convergent and discriminant validity. \n2.

Each question in the 4C questionnaires is scored from \n0 to 10, where 0 means \"Not confident at all\" and 10 means \"Very confident.\" Question 4 \nspecifically addresses patients’ confidence in managing symptoms without using avoidance \nbehaviours (such as avoiding certain situations or using background noise), which reflects a \nhigher level of coping. As avoidance behaviours are often linked to less adaptive management \nstrategies, the inclusion and weighting of Question 4 highlight its importance in evaluating \npatients’ overall confidence. \n     To calculate the total score, the sum of Questions 1 to 3 is multiplied by the score for \nQuestion 4, and the result is divided by 3. This scoring method was designed to emphasize the \nvalue of managing symptoms without reliance on avoidance strategies, as higher scores on \nQuestion 4 indicate more adaptive and self-reliant coping. The total score ranges from 0 to 100, \nwhere 0 represents no confidence and 100 represents full confidence in managing symptoms \nactively. This approach aligns with the theoretical framework of self-determination theory, \nwhich suggests that autonomous and confident management is essential for long-term success \n(Deci and Ryan, 2013).

The overarching aim of this thesis was to contribute to \nthe understanding of hyperacusis and misophonia by addressing critical gaps in their \nassessment and broader psychological impacts. This chapter will highlight contributions of the \nresearch, address its strengths and limitations, and outline directions for future studies.  \n     As outlined in Chapter One, hyperacusis and misophonia are complex conditions, with \nhyperacusis involving a heightening sensitivity to everyday sounds and misophonia \ncharacterised by strong emotional, behavioural, physical reactions to specific trigger sounds or \nstimuli, both significantly impairing daily functioning and quality of life (Swedo et al., 2022, \nAazh et al., 2016). Despite increasing recognition of their impact, these conditions lack \nconsistent diagnostic frameworks and a gold standard tool for clinical assessment and research \n(Ferrer-Torres and Giménez-Llort, 2022). The validation of some existing tools across different \nlanguages and cultural contexts is also insufficient, limiting their applicability in diverse \npopulations. In addition, current instruments have generally focussed on symptom severity but \nfail to address key aspects such as symptom management and coping strategies, which are \nessential for effective treatment planning. The psychological impact of misophonia, \nparticularly its relationship with fatigue, has received limited attention in existing literature. \nThese gaps provided the rationale for this thesis and informed its objectives. \n     Chapter Two presented a systematic review of psychometric measures for hyperacusis and \nmisophonia, evaluating eight widely used instruments, Hyperacusis Questionnaire, Inventory"

The review identified eight instruments, including the Hyperacusis \nQuestionnaire (HQ), MisoQuest, and Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S), among \nothers. While some tools demonstrated good internal consistency in specific studies, significant \ngaps were found in the reporting of reliability, validity, and cross-cultural applicability. \nImportantly, no instrument fully met the COSMIN standards. These findings underscored the \nneed for more robust and clinically relevant psychometric tools, providing a foundation for the \nsubsequent empirical studies.  \n      The second study (Chapter 3) validated the English version of MisoQuest, a 14-item \nmisophonia questionnaire initially developed in Polish. The study involved 451 adult \nparticipants and demonstrated excellent internal consistency, high test-retest reliability and a \nconfirmed multidimensional factor structure with adequate model fit through Confirmatory \nFactor Analysis (CFA). Strong convergent validity was established through moderate to high \ncorrelations with other misophonia measures, while weak correlations with non-misophonia \nconstructs supported discriminant validity. However, moderate correlations with fatigue and \nhyperacusis raised questions about potential construct overlap, indicating the need for further \nexploration. These results validated the English MisoQuest as a reliable tool for assessing \nmisophonia while highlighting the need for further research to better understand the correlation \nbetween misophonia and fatigue. \n    The third study (Chapter 4) investigated the relationship between misophonia and fatigue, \nwith a particular focus on the mediating roles of stress and sleep quality. Using data from the \nsame sample as the second study, correlation analysis revealed a positive moderate correlation \nbetween misophonia severity and fatigue, supporting findings from previous research (Dibb"

Mediation analysis further revealed that perceived stress and sleep quality \npartially mediated this relationship, indicating that these factors significantly contribute to the \nexperience of fatigue in individuals with misophonia. However, the findings also suggested \nthat the effect of misophonia on fatigue extends beyond the influence of stress and sleep quality. \nInterestingly, hyperacusis, anxiety, and depression did not emerge as significant predictors of \nfatigue in this context. These findings broadened the scope of the thesis by addressing the \npsychological and health impacts of misophonia, emphasising the importance of targeting \nstress and sleep quality in clinical interventions while acknowledging the need to explore other \nunderlying mechanisms. \n    The final study (Chapter 5) focused on validating the 4C Hyperacusis and Misophonia \nManagement Questionnaires, designed to assess patients' confidence in managing symptoms \nwithout reliance on avoidance behaviours. Data from 48 participants for the Hyperacusis \nManagement Questionnaire and 40 participants for the 4C Misophonia Management \nQuestionnaire demonstrated high reliability. CFA showed an acceptable model fit for the one \nstructure 4C Hyperacusis, while the 4C Misophonia showed an acceptable better model fit in \ntwo factor structure. Even though the findings were based on a relatively small sample, both \ntools exhibited good convergent and discriminant validity, although the misophonia \nquestionnaire showed a high correlation with anxiety and depression. These tools fill a critical \ngap in clinical assessments, providing a means to evaluate patients' confidence in managing \ntheir symptoms and supporting personalised treatment planning, particularly within CBT \nframeworks.    \n6.3 Research and Clinical Contributions  \n    This thesis is primarily psychometric in nature, focusing on the validation and evaluation of \nmeasurement tools.

Without these essential properties, measurement \ninstruments risk producing misleading conclusions, undermining the credibility and accuracy \nof research findings, and limiting their applicability in clinical and academic settings (Cohen \net al., 2017). This issue is particularly critical in diagnosis of hyperacusis and misophonia, \nwhich relies generally on questionnaires (Jastreboff and Jastreboff, 2014). Ensuring that these \ntools are valid and reliable is essential for accurate assessment and meaningful clinical \ninterventions. Therefore, this thesis makes a significant contribution by evaluating and \nhighlighting the psychometric properties of these tools in line with COSMIN standards \n(Mokkink et al., 2018), providing a rigorous framework to ensure their methodological and \nclinical robustness. \n    This thesis makes contributions to both research and clinical practice by addressing key gaps \nin the assessment and psychological impacts of hyperacusis and misophonia. One of the \ncontributions is the validation of the English version of MisoQuest, a widely used tool \noriginally developed in Polish (Siepsiak et al., 2020), following COSMIN standards.  This \nvalidation ensures that the questionnaire can reliably assess misophonia severity in English-\nspeaking populations, enabling cross-cultural research and facilitating consistent comparisons \nacross diverse contexts.  \n    In addition to English MisoQuest, this thesis introduces the 4C Hyperacusis and Misophonia \nManagement Questionnaires, specifically designed to measure patients’ confidence in \nmanaging their symptoms without relying on avoidance behaviours. These questionnaires \naddress a critical gap in existing tools, which generally focus on symptom severity. By \nvalidating these tools in clinical populations, this research provides clinicians and researchers \nwith practical instruments that align with the principles of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy \n(CBT) and support the development of personalised treatment strategies (Aazh et al., 2016)."

The findings \ndemonstrate that stress and sleep quality partially mediate this relationship, offering key \nfindings the broader psychological and health impacts of misophonia. These results emphasise \nthe importance of addressing stress and sleep disturbances as part of a comprehensive treatment \napproach. Although causality could not be demonstrated, the results of the study suggest that \nthe impact of misophonia on fatigue may extend beyond these mediating factors, highlighting \nthe need for future research to explore additional underlying mechanisms. \n    By combining rigorous psychometric evaluations with an exploration of the psychological \nimpacts of misophonia and hyperacusis, this thesis advances the understanding of these \nconditions. The validated tools and findings on fatigue help improve how hyperacusis and \nmisophonia are assessed and managed to support better clinical outcomes for individuals \naffected by these conditions.  \n6.4 Challenges and Limitations  \n    While this thesis provides important insights, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The \nsystematic review (published in 2023) included only psychometric measures published up to \nApril 2021, excluding tools developed or validated after this date. As of December 2024, there \nhave been an additional at least ten studies published assessing hyperacusis or misophonia.      \n    In this thesis, I adhered to COSMIN standards for the systematic review and two \npsychometric empirical studies. However, I was unable to properly assess content validity \nbased on these standards. Content validity refers to how well a measurement instrument \nrepresents the concept it is designed to measure and is crucial in developing new \nquestionnaires, particularly in ensuring agreement among experts (Beckstead, 2009). \nFurthermore, as I did not develop a new questionnaire in my thesis, and the existing \nquestionnaires often lacked detailed reports on content validity in the included articles, it was"

This is something that I aim to \npursue in the future.  \n    Another psychometric property that I was not able to address in this thesis, including within \nthe systematic review (Chapter 2), relates to the notion/construct of ‘responsiveness’. \nResponsiveness refers to the ability of an instrument to detect meaningful changes over time \nin the construct being measured. In other words, it reflects how accurately a measure can \ncapture changes in outcomes specific to the effects of a treatment (Mokkink et al., 2018). To \nour knowledge, none of the questionnaires included in the systematic review evaluated this \npsychometric property. Additionally, responsiveness could not be assessed in the empirical \nstudies conducted for this thesis, as these studies did not involve an intervention-based design \nrequiring pre- and post-treatment measurements. \n   Within this thesis, there are several methodological limitations that should be noted, with the \nspecific limitations of each study discussed in their respective chapters. One important \ncontextual factor is the timing of data collection for Studies 2 and 3, which occurred during the \nglobal COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment was conducted online through charities and social \nmedia support groups for individuals with hyperacusis and misophonia. As a result, we relied \nsolely on self-reports and were unable to independently diagnose participants with misophonia. \nProper diagnosis would have ideally required structured clinical interviews alongside the \nquestionnaires, which was not feasible under the circumstances. The absence of a clinically \nverified sample further limited our ability to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the \nmeasures. Additionally, in Study 3, comparisons between individuals with and without \nclinically confirmed misophonia could have provided more comprehensive insights into group \ndifferences, particularly in understanding the relationship between misophonia and fatigue, \nthereby enhancing the robustness of the study."

As a result, the findings presented in this chapter are based on a \nrelatively small sample. However, data collection is ongoing, and the work is planned to be \nsubmitted for publication at a later date. \n    Additionally, all studies included in this thesis a higher proportion of female participants. \nThis is consistent with research indicating that females are more likely to report symptoms of \nmisophonia, with studies suggesting that over 82% of individuals self-identifying with the \ncondition are women (Claiborn et al., 2020). In contrast, findings regarding hyperacusis show \nno significant gender differences, with a relatively balanced distribution between males and \nfemales (Musumano et al., 2023). These patterns suggest that the gender distribution in this \nthesis may reflect the characteristics of the conditions studied rather than recruitment bias, \nalthough the potential impact on generalisability should still be acknowledged. \n6.5 Directions for Future Research \n    While this thesis has contributed valuable insights and extended previous research in the \nfield of hyperacusis and misophonia, it has also highlighted several implications for future \nresearch. \n    The findings from this thesis in the systematic review suggest that none of the hyperacusis \nand misophonia questionnaires research studies published up to 2021 adhered fully to \nCOSMIN standards. Recent psychometric tools for misophonia, such as the Misophonia \nResponse Scale (Dibb et al., 2021), the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (Rosenthal et al., \n2021), the Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome Scale (S-Five; Vitoratou et al., 2021), the \nDuke-Vanderbilt Misophonia Screening Questionnaire (DVMSQ; Williams et al., 2022), the \nBerlin Misophonia Questionnaire Revised (BMQ; Remmert et al., 2022), the Sussex \nMisophonia Scale (SMS; Rinaldi et al., 2022; Simner et al., 2024), and the Misophonia Impact \nQuestionnaire (MIQ; Aazh et al., 2023), were not included in this review.
