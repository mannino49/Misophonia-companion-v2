It is estimated t hat around 20% of the general population  are affected by  this \nrelatively unheard -of disorder  (Ferrer -Torres & Gimenez -Llort,  2022 ; Kılıç et al., 2021 ; Swedo et \nal., 2022 ).  Bothersome stimuli, referred to  as triggers,  are both auditory and visual  and are often  \nhuman produced .  Each person has their own unique combination of triggers that may include \nchewing, sniffling, tapping, or leg swinging (Rouw & Erfanian, 2017 ).  An array  of symptoms , \nincluding negative emotions and the fight or flight reaction of the autonomic nervous system , \noccur when a trigger is sensed.   Symptoms are often exacerbated in familiar contexts but are \nindependent  of loudness  and pitch  (Edelstein et al., 2013) .  Misophonia is differentiated from  \nsimply “disliking” a sound in the experience of  disproportionate level s of negative emotions \ntoward a person  producing triggers  (Edelstein et al., 2013) .  Misophonia has a spectrum of \nseverity in which everyone’s experience with the disorder is unique.   People may perceive their \nmisophonia  symptoms  as less severe than others who experience the same triggers  and \nsymptoms , resulting in varying degrees of severity of this disorder  (Rosenthal et al., 2021) .   \n          The present review is aimed at examining  many aspects of misophoni a including  the \netiology of the disorder,  co-occurring disorders , distinct  evaluations  used to identify misophonia \nin individua ls, and the prevalence of treatments.   This review will compil e valuable and relevant \nresearch evidence on the subject to inform  the general population of misophonia , which is still a \nrelatively unknown disorder.      \nOnset and Etiology  \n          While the exact etiology  of misophonia remains to be elucidated , there ha ve been many \nstudies that aim to investigate  the symptomatology of misophonia and its causes.  Misophonia \nprimarily emerges in childhood and is more prevalent in younger populations  (Potgieter et al.,"

(2021)  found that individuals with \nmisophonia generally  report  that their symptoms emerg ed in childhood or adolescence.  The \nonset is usually associated with traumatic memories of triggering situations in which they \nexperienced unpleasant feelings toward sounds created by family members  (Schröder et al., \n2013; Taylor, 2017) .  It is still unclear whether misophonia is more prevalent in females than \nmales, as previous rese arch has suggested a higher presence of misophonia in the female \npopulation  (Kılıç et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2014) .  However, studies that suggested  higher \nprevalence  of misophonia  in females were based on samples  that were  predominantly  composed \nof females , which brings the sex differences into question  (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; \nKılıç et al., 2021; Savard et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2014) .  Further research is needed to clarify  true \ndisparities  in the prevalence of misophonia between genders .  \n          Hereditary and genetic links to misophonia have been suggested, but there is a lack of \nsubstantial  research to support this hypothesis.  Rouw and Erfanian  (2018) found that one third \nof participants in a large -scale misophonia study had family members with similar misophonia \nsymptoms.  Sanchez and Silva (2017 ) studied a family in which 15 members were said to be \naffected by misophonia.  They suggest ed that the incidence of misophonia in 15 family members \nwas likely  influenced  by autosomal dominant inheritance  (Sanchez & Silva, 2017) .  Other \nstudies have also  found a n association  between the presence of misophonia and a  family history \nof the disorder  (Edelstein et al., 2013; I. Jager et al., 2020; Kılıç et al., 2021) .  Despite these \nfindings, the available  evidence does not support  a definitive  hereditary or genetic association  to \nmisophonia , demonstrating a need for  further exploration  in future research (Swedo et al., 2022) .  \n          People with misophonia generally have  normal hearing , suggesting the disorder may be \nneurological rather than auditory (Potgieter et al., 2019) .

Stronger  functional brain  \nconnections between the autonomic  nervous system  (involved in regulating involuntary bodily \nprocesses)  and the limbic system  (responsible for regulating  emotion s) are associated with  the \nconditioned reflex response s to patterns of sounds  (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014) .  This \noveractivity of regulatory systems  is entirely subconscious , demonstrating a potential \nexplanation as to why it is  difficult for people with misophonia to regulate their emotional \nreactions to everyday sounds (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014) .  Another brain region involved in \nmisophonia is the  orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) , which processes stimuli and assigns  emotions to \nsensory input  (Neacsiu et al., 2022) .  Hyperconnectivity  between the  OFC  and frontal brain \nregions  (involved in planning motor responses)  is unique to misophonia , as most other disorders \nare typically characterized  by hypo connectivity between the OFC and  other brain regions  \n(Neacsiu et al., 2022) .  The hyperconnectivity between these two  brain regions may explain  the \nintense emotional response s to triggers  and the difficulty in controlling those responses .   \n          Hyperactivity in the  supplementary motor area  (involved in motor learning and control ) \nand ventral premotor cortex ( involved in integrating sensory information  and motor planning ) is \nalso unique to misophonia, which is different from  other disorders that typically exhibit \ndecreased  activity in these areas  (Neacsiu et al., 2022) . The hype ractivity in these areas may \nexplain  the common misophonic response of finding , mimic king, and  escap ing triggering stimuli  \n(Neacsiu et al., 2022) .  Studies have also found that h yperactivity of the insula (responsible for \nperceiving sensation and emotion ) may be associated with the  dysfunctional  emotion regu lation \nin triggering situations  (Kumar et al., 2017; Neacsiu et al., 2022) .  The anterior insular cortex, \nwhich controls emotional awareness, empathy, and decision -making , is also hyperactive when \nexperiencing triggers  (Kumar et al., 2017; Neacsiu et al., 2022) .

Hyperactivity of the insula and amygdala are also associated \nwith comorbidities of misophonia; however, c urrent research does not suggest a causal \nrelationship between misophonia  and any other conditions (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, \n2022; Neacsiu et al., 2022; Schröder et al., 2013) .   \nComorbidities  \n          Because the etiology of misophonia is still widely unknown , no criteria for the \ndifferentiation of misophonia and other disorders has been established.  Misophonia may co -\noccur with other psychologic al and auditory disorders including any combination of obsessive \ncompulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, attention deficit disorder, depression, autism spectrum \ndisorder, post -traumatic stress disorder, tinnitus, and hyperacusis; however, it is important to \nrecognize misophonia’s distinct symptom atology separate from these disorders, warranting \nclassification as its own distinct disorder (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Potgieter et al., \n2019; Swedo et al., 2022) .  The most prominent comorbidities of misophonia are OCD and \nanxiety (Barahmand et al., 2023; Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Neacsiu et al., 2022) .   \nObsessive Compulsive Disorder  \n          OCD is the most frequently associated comorbidity with misophonia and the two disorders \nare often studied concurrently (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Potgieter et al., 2019; \nSchröder et al., 2013) .  Many of the evaluation  methods  for misophonia were developed based on \nOCD assessment scales (Siepsiak et al., 2020) .  Misophonia is  often categorized within the \nobsessive -compulsive spectrum of diagnostic manuals (e.g. the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual \nof Mental Disorders Fifth Edition ); however, the correlations between these two disorders have \nbeen largely disproved (Barahmand et al., 2023; Schröder et al., 2013) .

Additionally, \ncontamination -based disgust and compulsive acts were found to be associated with OCD but not \nmisophonic reactions (Barahmand et al., 2023) .  Hyperactivity in the insula and the amygdala is \nassociated with both OCD and misophonia (Barahmand et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2017; Neacsiu \net al., 2022) .  Another shared cognitive experience of OCD and misophonia is the perception of \n“imperfect” acts that elicit discomfort, which relates to previous findings linking misophonia to \nperfectionism (Barahmand et al., 2023) .  However, OCD is associated with dysfunctional \nconnectivity between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (decision making and planning) and the \ninsula, whereas misophonia is associated with dysfunctional connectivity between the \nventromedial prefrontal cort ex and the insula (Barahmand et al., 2023) .  This is an important \ndifference when considering the distinction of misophonia and OCD as two distinct disorders.   \nAnxiety  \n          When the brain is anticipating or sensing misophonic triggers, people with misophonia \nreport feeling extreme stress and anxiety in response to those triggers (Mattson et al., 2023; \nNeacsiu et al., 2022; Swedo et al., 2022) .  It is important to distinguish that the “anxiety” felt by \npeople with misophonia is not related to being afraid or fearful of triggers; rather, the anxiety \nexperienced is a unique experience of intense emotional and physiological reactions and \navoidance  behavior (Neacsiu et al., 2022) .  While anxiety itself can be a symptom of misophonia, \nfear and worry are distinguishing factors between misophonia and anxiety disorders (Barahmand \net al., 2023) .

Previous research has found that \npublic shame when experiencing a misophonic trigger as well as aggressive reactions to triggers \nis related to anxiety sensitivity (Barahmand et al., 2023) .  The anterior insular cortex is related to \nthe cognitive and emotional responses elicited by anxiety and misophonia (Neacsiu et al., 2022) .  \nHowever, hyperactivity of the insula is what primarily triggers the negative emotions and \nmaladaptive emotional responses in misophonia (Neacsiu et al., 2022) .   \nEvaluation  \n          Before scientifically  validated studies established assessment measures  and criteria  for \nmisophonia , clinical interviews were the primary way of assessing this disorder  (Potgieter et al., \n2019) .  In recent years, s everal testing  method s have been created  to systematically  assess  and \ndiagnose individuals with misophonia.  The development of these  evaluations has resulted in \nimproved recognition of misophonia as a distinct disorder.  Despite this progress , there is not a  \nuniversally recognized or standardized evaluation tool for evaluating and diagnosing  \nmisophonia.   Commonly used evaluation tools will be summarized in this section.  \nMisophonia Questionnaire  \n          The Misophonia Questionnaire (MQ) was one of the first self -report questionnaires \ndeveloped  by Wu et al. in 2014  to assess  the presence of misophonia symptoms and the severity \nof sound sensitivity in individuals.  The MQ  contains three  subsections  to evaluate the presence  \nof specific triggers, the reactions elicited by triggers, and the severity  of the individual’s \nsensitivities  (Wu et al., 2014) .  This test was developed using many other established scales and \nquestionnaires  including the Adult Sensory Questionnaire, Sheehan Disability Scale, and \nObsessive -Compulsive  Inventory -Revised  (Abramowitz & Deacon, 2006; Kinn ealey & Oliver, \n2002; Shee han, 2000; Wu et al., 2014) .

On the \nMisophonia Severity subsection , which ranges from 1 -15, ratings  of 7 or above indicated \nclinically significant misophonia symptoms.   Rosenthal et al . (2021)  found the MQ had  good \nspecificity  of 72%  and sensitivity  of 78% for determining clinical misophonia  (Rosenthal et al., \n2021) .  The population  used to  validate this test was a university sample , bringing the \ngeneralizability of the study into question .  Despite these constraints, t he MQ is one of the most \ncommon diagnostic measure s for this disorder .  It has been utilized  in numerous subsequent  \nstudies of misophonia .  The MQ  was one of the most influential  assessments in early scientific \nfindings and is very well known within the misophonia community  (Rosenthal et al., 2021; \nSiepsiak  et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2014).         \nMisoQuest  \n          The MisoQuest  is another  self-report questionnaire  used to screen for  misophonia .  The \ndiagnostic  criteria  of the MisoQuest  were  based  on the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale ( A-MISO -\nS), which was  developed  by Schröder  et al. (2013) .  The MisoQuest  consists of  14 questions,  \nusing a five-point Likert scale  to evaluate self-reported reactions to specific sounds,  avoidance \nbehaviors, and the impact on daily functioning .  On a  scale  ranging from  0-70, scores  of 61 or \nabove  on the test indicate the presence of misophonia  (Siepsiak et al., 2020) .  Savard et al. \n(2022) found the  MisoQuest ha d good specificity  of 96%  but low sensitivity  of 66%.  The \ndiagnostic criteria of the MisoQuest was based on the A -MISO -S criteria; however, more \nupdated diagnostic criteria has been published since the creation of this evaluation  (Potgieter et \nal., 2019; Rosenthal et al., 2021) .  Nevertheless, the MisoQuest is a widely used evaluation  tool \nto assess misophonia (Rosenthal et al., 2021; Siepsiak et al., 2020) ."

The nine  subscales of this self -report assessment evaluate differential responses to \ntriggers, coping  with triggers , impairment  in functioning , and severity of misophonia  (Rosenthal \net al., 2021) .  These subscales can be grouped together into symptom severity and  coping \ncomposite scale s.  The DMQ subscales or  composite scale s can be used independently  – as \nopposed to administering the entire  assessment  – to evaluate specific aspects  of misophonia  \n(Rosenthal et al, 2021) .

The DVMSQ ’s diagnostic algorithm  \ncontains six  criteria for misophonia .  Individuals  who meet all six criteria are considered to \nexhibit  clinically significant misophonia.  The initial publication of the DVMSQ did not report a  \nspecific  value to classify  misophonia status, and therefore did not include specificity and \nsensitivity values  (Williams et al., 2022) .

However, since these drugs have primarily been tested in patients with \nmultiple conditions, the effect  pharmacological treatments may have on the wider misophonic \npopulation  remains unclear  (Ferrer -Torres & Giménez -Llort, 2022; Mattson et al., 2023) .  \nResearch is still developing within this field  as the misophonia community aspires  to find a cure .  \nVarious supplements and vitamins have been suggested as possible treatments for misophonia , \nparticularly magnesium and vitamin B , within misophonia support groups and pages on social \nmedia  (Misophonia Treatment Tracker , n.d.).  However, it is important to note that no  scientific \nresearch on  the effectiveness of supplements and vitamins has been published , so they cannot be \nconsidered a reliable treatment option  at this time (General Health and Wellness , n.d.).  \nOn-Ear Sound Generating Devices  \n          The use of on-ear sound generating devices have primarily been used to treat tinnitus and \nhyperacusis (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2014) .  These devices , which resemble over -the-ear hearing \naids, produc e a wide  variety of non-repeating fractal chimes , broadband noise, or nature sounds .  \nUnlike hearing aids , these on-ear sound generating devices are not meant to amplify noise.  \nInstead , they are used  to increase external auditory stimuli  entering the auditory system , which"

The use of these devices has also been used to treat misophonia , as they help \nto increase “background noise” rather than  allowin g the brain to focus on trigger sounds \n(Johnson , n.d.).  An informal study  was conducted by n ine audiologists  in 2012  that showed out \nof 65 patients with misophonia who were fit with these devi ces, 85% found the devices \nbeneficial in their emotion regulation and were less affected by triggers (Johnson , n.d.).  While \nfurther research is necessary to validate the efficacy of on-ear sound generating  devices in \ntreating misophonia, they have promising effects  for people with misophonia, such as being able \nto tolerate a wider variety of listening environments (Johnson, n.d.)  \nSensory Distraction  \n          Through the development of diagnostic criteria for misophonia, coping strategies have \nbeen identified that are widely used by individuals with misophonia.  These coping strategies are \nutilized  by individuals in many different contexts and do not require  the help of a doctor or \ntherapist to employ  them.  The most common coping  mechanisms  are sensory distractions in \nwhich individuals use their surround ings to remove their focus from a trigger.   Jastreboff and \nJastreboff  (2014) proposed that increasing sensory input when experiencing adverse trigger \nsounds decreases the intense response of the autonomic nervous system.   Earplugs, noise \ncanceling headphones, and listening to music are ways to decrease the intensity  of auditory \ntriggers (Cavanna & Seri, 2015; Edelstein et al., 2013) .  Self -distraction such as making another \nsound , creating  an alternate physical sensation (e.g. rubbing thighs, biting nails) , or focusing \nattention on a task  are other common coping strategies used to decrease the reaction caused by \ntriggers (Edelstein et al., 2013; Rosenthal et al., 2021) .  The most proactive coping mechanisms \nused by individuals with misophonia are asking the person producing the trigger to stop or"

Etiology, comorbidities, evaluations, \nand treatments were discussed.  Through compiling research within this field, the current project \nhas revealed  a more thorough  understanding of the mechanisms underlying this disorder .  Future \nresearch should continue to investigate the impacts misophonia has on those affected and how \nthis disorder is specifically differentiated from simply disliking certain stimuli.  No cure \ncurrently exists for misophonia, so future research should also continue investigating the \npotential mechanisms that may improve the quality of life of people with misophonia.  \nMisophonia is unique in that it is not something that can be seen or heard on the surface.  Often \npeople silently endure its effects  and may feel ashamed about their condition .  Therefore , \nresearch should prioritize a wareness and advocacy to foster greater  openness, acceptance, and \ncomfortability for those affected ."
