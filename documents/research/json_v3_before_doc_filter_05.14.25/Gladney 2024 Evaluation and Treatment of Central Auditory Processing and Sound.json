A sound tolerance disorder is a broad term that encompasses tinnitus, hyperacusis, misophonia, and phonophobia. Case Presentation: A young adult female was seen for a sound tolerance evaluation. Results from an audiological evaluation revealed normal hearing thresholds and results from a sound tolerance evaluation indicated that a majority of responses to uncomfortable listening levels were in the normal range, which is consistent with hyperacusis. Discussion: Due to reduced uncomfortable listening levels, the patient was diagnosed with hyperacusis and misophonia, and extensive counseling was conducted. The counselor explained what hyperacusis was and presented the various treatment options available to the patient, including sound therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Conclusion: This case demonstrates that there may be multiple options available to aid in successful treatment for the patient, while some options may require collaboration with mental health professionals.",

      "text": "CAP AND SOUND TOLERANCE    4 \n The Presentation of Central Auditory Processing Disorders in Adults  \n \nIntroduction  \nThe prevalence of central auditory processi ng disorder (CAPD) in adults is not known \nprecisely. Bellis and Anzalone ( 2008) estimated that around 76% of  adults have CAPD. For each \nindividual, disorders of the centr al auditory processing system can present differently in the \nclinic. In addition, there are several ways for CAPD to be de scribed. Rosen (2005) explained that \nCAPD is a hearing disorder that originates with in the brain, which explains why a person’s pure-\ntone thresholds are typically within normal li mits. Central auditory processing disorder is \ncharacterized by poor speech rec ognition, difficulty with speech discrimination and separation, \ndifficulty localizing, and problems with nonspe ech grouping sounds. With CAPD, the deficits \nand difficulties cannot be attributed to  attention or other cognitive disorders. \n Keith (1999) provided a few examples of comp laints a patient may report. These include \ndifficulty localizing sound a lthough they have normal audiom etric responses, inability to \nunderstand speech in the presence of background noise, problems following rapid speech, and \ntrouble with auditory memory task s. While taking case history, th e patient's struggles will help \nguide the audiologist with the sel ection of assessments for a test battery. The select ed battery of \ntests for CAPD is flexible so the same assessme nts will not always be used for every patient. A \nCAPD test battery should include tests that fall under the following categories: temporal \nprocessing, localization and lateralization, mo naural low redundancy, dichotic speech, and \nbinaural interaction. Performing assessments within these categor ies will assign the patient to a \nCAPD subtype if a diagnosis is made and will u ltimately help to determ ine a treatment plan."

She repor ted difficulty with \nhearing in the presence of b ackground noise, remembering name s, learning new things, and \nexplained that her television “s ounded muffled.” She described wh at she was experiencing as a \n“problem from her brain”. She explained that her problems began after she was involved in a \nmotor vehicle accident (MVA). At the time of the MVA, she was 20 weeks pregnant, and the \nsafety of her baby was the main priority. After the MVA, she was examined by her primary care \nphysician (PCP) and discussed her concerns . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and \ncomputerized tomography (CT) were administere d and were unremarkable. She reported that her \ncondition was classified as “emotional problems” and warra nted only a brief period of \nmonitoring. \nAn audiologic evaluation was administered th at revealed normal he aring sensitivity in \nboth ears ( Figure 1 ) with normal middl e ear function. The following deficits were suggested by \nthe CAPD assessment ( Table 1 ): binaural integration which was s een in the left ear for dichotic \ndigits, binaural separation which was seen in the right and left ear for competing sentences, \ntemporal processing which was seen in the gaps-i n-noise assessment, and temporal patterning in \nboth the verbal and hummed labeling which was s een in the pitch pattern  sequence test. During \ncounseling, her test findings were  briefly summarized, and she was informed that the CAPD team \nwould examine her data more closely and woul d produce a detailed list of recommendations.  \n \nDiscussion  \nAn early-middle-aged woman was seen for a CAPD assessment. Using the Bellis/Ferre \nmodel of categorizing a CAPD, these deficits were  characteristic of a prosodic deficit. With a"

Indi viduals who demonstrate \nthis profile can comprehend the gist of a messag e, yet cannot discern c ontext such as sarcasm \nand irony. People with prosodic deficits may show a lack of affect or be classified as monotonic \nreaders (Bellis, n.d.).  \nEven though test results point ed to a prosodic deficit, the patient’s case history, \ncounseling, and recommended mana gement strategies were not in alignment. Although CAPD \nwas suspected, her weaknesses were more reflective of an integration deficit which occurs when \nthe two hemispheres of the brain are not prope rly communicating. Integra tion complaints that \nrelate to this case incl uded challenges with read ing comprehension, difficulty with multi-tasking, \nproblems with spelling and written language, difficu lty with speech in noise, and a need for more \ntask-processing time. The challenge s and management strategies of  an integration deficit were \nbetter suited for this pa tient. As discussed in Bellis and Anzalone (2008), a management plan \nshould not solely be based on the results of the assessments, but al so on the individual’s \nfunctional performance and behavioral complaints.  \n \nConclusion  \nAlthough a CAPD diagnosis is la rgely based on a pa tient’s performance on specific tests, \nexaminers must be mindful that not all patients c onform to the Bellis/Ferre sub-profiles. The case \nhistory and list of complaints for this case did not align with  poor performance on temporal \npatterning, but her data revealed weaknesses in  auditory processing. A CAPD diagnosis should \nbe made by looking at a patient hol istically, not only by obj ective test results.

      "text": "CAP AND SOUND TOLERANCE    9 \n The Presentation of Sound Tolerance Disorders in Young Adults  \n \nIntroduction   A sound tolerance disorder is a broad way to describe a negative reaction or response to \nenvironmental sounds. More specific terms th at designate sound tole rance disorders are \nhyperacusis, misophonia, noise sens itivity, and phonophobia. Hyperacu sis is a physical response, \nusually pain or discomfort, once a sound reaches a certain loudness that would typically not be \ndescribed as painful to others. Whereas hypera cusis elicits a physical  response, when an \nindividual has misophonia, their re sponse to sound, regardless of its intensity, is emotional. \nNoise sensitivity is described as  the state, both psychological a nd physiological, of the individual \nthat results in a more intens e reaction to sounds. Finally, pho nophobia is the fear of certain \nsounds and does not typically fall in to the traditional scope of an audiologist. (Henry et al, 2022). \nThe prevalence of adults with sound tolerance disorders has not been ascertained; however, the \nAmerican Speech-Language-Hearing Association (n.d.) reported a rate of 8.6 to 11.5% for \nadults. Paulin et al. (2016) indi cated that social isolation and th e use of earplugs are two methods \npatients use to cope with hyperacusis, which wa s evident in the patient described below.  \n \nCase Presentation   An adult female patient was seen fo r a sound tolerance evaluation, which was \nrecommended after an evaluation by a clinical psychologist and pediatri c neuropsychologist. She \nreported that several sounds were too loud fo r her and were very ups etting and overwhelming. \nThe specific sounds that she reported as bot hersome were: speech over a speakerphone and \nconference calls in which she described the spee ch as distorted, background noise and multiple"

She reported struggli ng with the ability to ignore b ackground noise and, as a result, \nshe used noise-canceling headphones or earplugs during all waking hours. Due to her reactions \nto these sounds, the patient e xplained that she was frequently  alone but found enjoyment in \nlistening to music. She reported having depression and attention- deficit hyperactivity disorder \n(ADHD) and was receiving treat ment for these conditions.  \n  A Khalfa Hyperacusis Questionnaire and th e Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener \n(GAD-7) were administered. The hyperacusis questionnaire score wa s consistent with a severe \nloudness sensitivity handicap and her result s on the GAD-7 suggested a probable anxiety \ndisorder ( Table 2 ). The patient expressed that she suffe red from anxiety but that her vigilance \nand coping strategies for her ADHD manifest as anxiety. An audiological evaluation was \nadministered that revealed normal hearing sensitivity in both ears ( Figure 2 ). Uncomfortable \nloudness levels (UCLs) elicited using warble tones, speech, and multi-talker babble were \nobtained, and her responses were record ed at reduced intensity levels ( Table 2 ), which is a \nmarker for hyperacusis. The patient was counseled on the te st results, her diagnosis of \nhyperacusis, and plans for coordinated care. \n \nDiscussion   A young adult female was seen for a sound tole rance evaluation. An assessment that was \ncomprised of questionnaires and audiometric testing suggested a diagnosis of hyperacusis. When \ndiagnosing hyperacusis or any other sound tolera nce disorder, it is imp erative to critically \nanalyze a patient’s UCLs. According to Henry et al.

As a result of the test outcom es, our patient was diagnosed with \nhyperacusis and misophonia, and time was spent c ounseling her on various treatment options.  \nOur primary recommendation was psychothera py with cognitive behavioral therapy \n(CBT). Cognitive behavioral therapy aims to assist patients in exploring and uncovering the underlying factors that are causing an advers e psychological reaction to sound (Spankovich & \nHall, 2014). The strategies obtained from CBT can  help to reduce the negative feelings and \nemotions patients have attach ed to sound. The audiologist and psychotherapist should work \ncollaboratively to improve the patient's quality of life. Other treatment options available include but are not limited to, the use of custom-molded or off-the-shelf musician’s earplugs, tinnitus \nretraining therapy, and sound therap y (Henry et al., 2022). A blend of  CBT, musician’s earplugs, \nand sound therapy has been frequently reco mmended for patients with hyperacusis.  \n \nConclusion \n  Testing, counseling, and treatment for any sound tolerance disorder i nvolves more than \nstandard audiological testing. With  the testing, clinicians should incorporate questionnaires that \ntarget tinnitus and hyperacusis, and screeners for mental health condi tions (e.g., anxiety and \ndepression). These results may be  used alongside the audiological  data to inform a counseling \ntechnique and treatment regimen. Whenever possi ble, audiologists should collaborate with \nmental health professionals to he lp address the complex feelings and emotions that patients with \nsound tolerance disorders will likely  experience, which inherently exacerbate their reactions to \neveryday sounds."
