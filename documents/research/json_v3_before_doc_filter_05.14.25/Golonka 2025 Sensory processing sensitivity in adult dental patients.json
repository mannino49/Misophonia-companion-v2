SPS is linked to the central nervous system’s activity and is an interchangeable \nterm for ‘neurosensitivity’5,6 or ‘environmental sensitivity’2. In psychological literature, individual dispositions \nlinked to SPS traits have a long history and constitute the basis for temperament research and theory7. Highly \nsensitive individuals are more likely to experience heightened emotional reactivity and may be more prone \nto stress, anxiety, depression, and health complaints8–10. Some dimensions of SPS (e.g., emotional reactivity, \noverstimulation) overlap with anxiety and neuroticism, but recent studies suggest that SPS may influence stress \nand somatic symptoms independently of neuroticism9. SPS may also be associated with positive experiences, \nsuch as greater sensitivity to aesthetic impressions and deeper processing of stimuli4,10,11, potentially enhancing \nlife satisfaction in supportive environments2,9. This suggests the distinctiveness of the SPS construct from anxiety \nand neuroticism.\n1Institute of Applied Psychology, Faculty of Management and Social Communication, Jagiellonian University, \n30-348 Kraków, Poland. 2Department of Developmental Dentistry, Institute of Dentistry, Jagiellonian University \nMedical College, 31-155 Kraków, Poland. 3Department of Periodontology, Prophylaxis and Oral Medicine, Institute \nof Dentistry, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 31-155 Kraków, Poland. 4Laboratory of Anthropology, \nInstitute of Zoology and Biomedical Research, Faculty of Biology, Jagiellonian University, Kraków 30-387, Poland. \n5Department of Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 30-688 Kraków, Poland. \n6Doctoral School in the Social Sciences, Jagiellonian University,  31-010 Kraków, Poland. 7Department of Genetics \nand Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA. 8Department of Medical \nDiagnostics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 30-688 Kraków, Poland. email: \nkrystyna.golonka@uj.edu.pl\nOPEN\nScientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:7328 1 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-90263-1\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports"

      "text": "SPS is characterized by heightened responsiveness to stimuli1, which can be observed at physiological, \nemotional, cognitive, and behavioral levels8. Studies have shown that highly sensitive individuals display greater \nbrain activity in areas related to empathy, memory, self-awareness, and self-other processing12,13. However, \nthese individuals’ reactions are strongly influenced by environmental context6. For example, their physiological \nresponses to stress may vary depending on the overall context and the environmental characteristics6,14,15. \nResearch suggests that over 30% of people may exhibit traits of high SPS, highlighting the relevance of this \ntrait in the general population3,10. Further studies on SPS, particularly in adult clinical populations, could offer \nvaluable insights into how this trait interacts with stress and mental and somatic health9,10,16. Understanding the \nrelationship between SPS and stress is crucial as stress can mediate the impact of SPS on mental well-being17. \nClinicians may benefit from recognizing the unique challenges faced by highly sensitive individuals, such as \noverstimulation, emotional regulation difficulties, and sensitivity to criticism18, which could help improve \ninterventions and mental health support for this group4,9,11,12.\nDental visits are often stressful due to their multisensory nature19, making this context particularly interesting \nfor exploring SPS and its effects. For patients with dispositions of high SPS, facing medical procedures can be a \ngreat source of stress because they might be easily overwhelmed by excessive stimulation. For example, the sounds \nof dental instruments may cause discomfort or irritation as there are some overlapping symptoms between high \nSPS and misophonia20. Siev et al.21 indicate that specific blood-injection-injury fears among people with dental \nanxiety are associated with anxiety sensitivity and disgust sensitivity. Studies show that app. 12–15% of adults \nsuffer from dental anxiety, which leads to avoiding or delaying visits to the dentist, thus possibly resulting in \nincreased caries, tooth loss, and serious health problems22,23. Current research on adult dental patients in the \ncontext of SPS is very limited24–26. Eger et al.24 found that soldiers with severe periodontitis had significantly \nhigher levels of overstimulation tendency compared to those with milder symptoms, highlighting the link \nbetween SPS and dental anxiety. Significant associations between sensory sensitivity and dental anxiety were also \nconfirmed by Ogawa et al.25,26, who emphasized that knowledge of this relationship may be critical for managing \ndental anxiety and interventive programs. Below, we explore some biochemical and psychological aspects of \nstress and regulatory mechanisms, emphasizing their potential links with SPS among adult dental patients; on \nthis basis, we formulate hypotheses for this study.\nHeightened reactivity to stimuli activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, regulating cortisol \nrelease in response to stress. Cortisol, a key stress biomarker, is produced during the fight-or-flight response and in \nsituations of uncontrollability and unpredictability, triggering physiological, emotional, and behavioral effects27. \nResearch on a sample of children has shown that the relationship between cortisol and sensory sensitivity is \ncomplex, with different aspects of sensitivity linked to either higher or lower cortisol levels28. The consequences \nof increased cortisol are linked to stress, mental and somatic problems, e.g., depression, cardiovascular and \nmetabolic disease, or inflammation29. Cortisol concentration may be assessed in blood, urine, saliva, and \nhair30,31. Hair cortisol remains a controversial research area, with potential publication bias arising from various \nfactors that can influence hair samples32. However, some studies highlight the unique opportunity to assess long-\nterm cortisol concentrations and the retrospective effects of chronic stress exposure through hair samples30. \nThey also emphasize the significant potential of hair cortisol analysis in both clinical and scientific research \nto enhance patient care33. Only a few studies have directly analyzed the relationship between SPS and cortisol \nlevels, focusing on salivary and hair samples in children28,34.\nThe modulation of emotional responses to stress is linked to the serotonergic system35. In humans, serotonin \n(5-HT) is found in various biological fluids, including saliva, where it originates from both the central and \nperipheral nervous systems36. Given its role in mood, stress response, and coping behavior37, salivary 5-HT can \nserve as an indicator of psychological states. Research suggests that salivary serotonin correlates with sensory \nprocessing, emotions, and social behaviors38,39, and lower levels are linked to certain positive emotions and \ntrait empathy39. This underscores serotonin’s role in emotional regulation. Notably, salivary serotonin does not \ndirectly correlate with levels in peripheral tissues, such as platelets or the intestines, which contain 95% of the \nbody’s serotonin40. Rather than being produced by peripheral sources, serotonin in saliva is mainly the result \nof its release from nerve endings in the oral cavity and salivary glands, thus it does not reflect overall serotonin \nlevels in the body41,42. Monitoring salivary serotonin offers a non-invasive method of assessing responses to \nstress-related stimuli, deepening our understanding of serotonin’s role in mental health. Despite suggestions \nof a negative relationship between serotonin and SPS characteristics43, no studies have yet been dedicated to \nanalyzing the associations between level of salivary serotonin and specific dimensions of SPS.\nConsidering current findings and the still insufficient studies on biochemical correlates of SPS, we decided \nto research the potentially stressful situation of a dental visit. By focusing on cortisol and serotonin levels, we \naim to gain deeper insights into how these biochemical markers contribute to sensory processing sensitivity \nand how these aspects are associated with perceived stress and affect during dental visits. According to previous \nfindings4,10,16, individuals with higher levels of sensory processing sensitivity should report higher levels of \nperceived stress. Based on the assumption that there are relationships between sensory processing sensitivity \nand psychological and biochemical indicators of stress, the following hypotheses were formulated:\nH1: Individuals characterized by a higher level of sensory processing sensitivity will show higher levels of \ncortisol (both in hair and saliva).\nH2: Individuals with higher levels of sensory processing sensitivity will show lower levels of serotonin in \nsaliva.\nH3: Individuals with higher levels of sensory processing sensitivity will show higher levels of negative \naffect while waiting for a dental procedure.\nScientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:7328 2 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-90263-1www.nature.com/scientificreports/"

      "text": "Deepening our understanding of the relationship between sensory processing sensitivity and experienced stress \nin a group of dental patients may lead to increased understanding and anticipation of how this specific situation \nis experienced in the context of healthcare. On the other hand, this knowledge may assist healthcare systems in \nplanning suitable conditions and development of more effective interventions and personalized care strategies \nfor highly sensitive individuals, thus improving their overall experience in healthcare settings.\nMethods\nParticipants and procedure\nOne hundred fifty-seven adults (103 females, 54 men; mean age = 42.2 years; SD = 16.0 years) who were patients \nof a dental clinic participated in this study. Inclusion criteria: adult age, regular dental treatment, no hair dye \nin the last month. Exclusion criteria: adrenal disease, Cushing’s disease, hyperthyroidism, depression, obesity, \nand taking steroids, oral contraceptives, amphetamines, spironolactone. During the follow-up visit, the patients \nunderwent tooth scaling and/or carious cavity filling. More specialized and advanced procedures such as tooth \nextractions or root canal treatment were not performed.\nThe study procedure consisted of two stages. The first stage was the participant preparation. Patients who \nmet the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate were informed about the study’s purpose and given detailed \ninstructions on how to collect saliva and hair samples. Each participant received a folder containing the Highly \nSensitive Person Scale  (HSPS), and three clearly marked envelopes – two for the saliva storage tubes and one \nfor hair storage foil, along with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the test and collect saliva samples. \nBefore the dental visit, participants were asked to complete the HSPS and were instructed to wash their hair with \nshampoo, not using conditioner, styling gel, or other hair cosmetics.\nThe second stage took place on the day of the dental visit. Participants were instructed to collect their saliva \nsamples at home at 8.00 am, on an empty stomach, before teeth brushing. After rinsing the mouth with clean \nwater for 1–5 s and 10 min waiting, they were asked to remove the swab from the Salivette® tube and insert the \nswab into the mouth for at least 2 min (without chewing). The swab was then placed back in the tube. This \nprocedure was repeated twice: first for cortisol at 8.00 am and 15 min later for serotonin samples. The salivary \nsamples were taken at the same time for all participants to minimize the effect of diurnal fluctuations in cortisol \nand serotonin levels44,45.\nThe advantage of the Salivette® system lies in its easy and hygienic saliva collection process, which allows \npatients to collect their saliva independently at home without the need for medical personnel. Participants were \nprovided with detailed instructions for collecting their saliva samples. This approach prioritized comfort during \ncollection, taking place at home before visiting the dental office, rather than in the clinic, where the proximity \nof other patients might cause discomfort. The standardized conditions for saliva collection, guided by Salivette® \ninstructions, ensured accurate and consistent sample collection across all participants. The Salivette® tube uses \nabsorbent pads designed for optimal saliva collection. Two separate tubes ensure an adequate volume of saliva \nas some individuals may struggle to collect enough. Participants were instructed to store the collected saliva \nsamples in a domestic refrigerator or at temperature protection until the appointment with the dentist.\nAt the clinic, further psychological measures of perceived stress and affect were performed in the waiting \nroom just before the dental procedure. Hair samples were collected by a researcher using a disposable hair \nsampling kit, prepared in accordance with standard hair sampling guidelines46,47. The collection site was clean \nand free from external substances in the air that could exogenously contaminate the hair fibers. It is generally \naccepted that hair on the scalp grows at an average rate of 1 cm per month, with samples preferably taken near \nthe scalp from the posterior vertex area as this region is associated with the least variability in growth rate. \nHair was collected close to the scalp at the posterior vertex of the head, cut using small scissors. The sample for \nanalysis consisted of approximately 50 mg of hair, roughly 150–200 strands. The collected hair samples were \naffixed to paper with tape and stored in a dry, airtight envelope at room temperature, protecting them from \nsunlight and moisture, following the procedure described by Wester and van Rossum31. Hair and saliva samples \nwere transported from the dental clinic to medical diagnostics laboratory within 20 h of collection. Upon arrival, \nthe saliva samples were immediately frozen at −80 °C until analysis.\nThis study was approved by the Commission on Ethics at Jagiellonian University and by the authorities of \nthe dental clinic. The study was conducted voluntarily, in accordance with the recommendations of the Helsinki \nDeclaration. All participants gave a written informed consent for participation in this study in accordance with \nthe national legislation and the institutional requirements.\nQuestionnaires\nThe Highly Sensitive Person Scale (HSPS) by Aron and Aron8– researchers used the Polish version of this \nscale, created using a back translation procedure by Golonka and Gulla10. This 27-item self-report measure is \ndesigned to assess sensory-processing sensitivity. It consists of 3 subscales: Emotional Reactivity , Sensing the \nSubtle  and Overstimulation . Items are rated on a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 ( not at all ) to 7 ( extremely ). The \nscale consistently shows good reliability among different samples, with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient higher than \n0.8410,48.\nThe Polish version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)49,50 was administered in this study. It is a 10-item self-\nreport questionnaire designed to assess the level of stress in one’s life in the last month. Questions concern ways \nof coping, behaviors and subjective feelings in stressful situations. The Polish adaptation is a valid and reliable \ntool with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.86 and stability after 4 weeks of 0.7249.\nThe researchers used also the Polish adaptation of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)51,52. \nThis a 20- or 30-item (depending on the version) self-report questionnaire can be used to assess the severity of \nemotional states and relatively stable affective characteristics. Four versions are available: two of them (shorter, \n20 item; longer, 30 item) regard current emotional states (S20 and S30). The other two versions concern relatively \nScientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:7328 3 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-90263-1www.nature.com/scientificreports/"

For the purpose of this study 20-item version \nanalyzing emotional states was used51.\nHair sample preparation for cortisol analysis\nThe hair samples were weighed, washed, and extracted with methanol, then finely chopped and ground. The \npresence of cortisol in the hair was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/\nMS). The hair analysis consists of four main stages46,47:\n 1.  Decontamination: This step removes any exogenous contaminants from the hair structure and eliminates \nother unwanted substances. The decontamination process involves washing the hair samples with organic \nsolvents or alternating between an organic solvent and an aqueous solution.\n 2.  Homogenization: This process ensures sample uniformity by grinding the hair into smaller particles to fa -\ncilitate subsequent stages of analysis. Homogenization is typically performed in a ball mill, which yields \napproximately 10–50 mg of ground hair.\n 3.  Extraction: This step isolates the target substance from the hair fibers. The extraction is carried out by incu -\nbating the hair sample with an organic solvent (methanol). Methanol is commonly used for extraction as it \nis highly compatible with many medicinal substances.\n 4.  Analysis: The extracted substance is analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry \n(LC-MS). This technique allows for precise identification and quantification of the target substance, such as \ncortisol, in the hair sample.\nThis process provides a reliable method of assessing cortisol levels in hair46,47.\nThe collected hair samples were washed with propanol (three times) and homogenized using a bead mill \nhomogenizer (Bead Mill Homogenizer, OMNI Int.; PerkinElmer Comp., USA). Two milliliters of methanol \nwere added to the prepared samples, which were then left at room temperature for 24 h. Prior to centrifugation, \nthe samples underwent ultrasonic extraction for 20 min. The centrifuged samples were filtered using an 80 g/\nm² filter, and the methanol was evaporated to dryness at 37 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The dry residue \nwas dissolved in 30 µl of methanol containing the internal standard, cortisol-d3 (concentration = 5 µg/ml). The \nsample was placed in a chromatography vial and analyzed via LC-MS/MS.\nThe sample analysis was conducted using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC® H-Class liquid chromatograph system \n(Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). Chromatographic separation was achieved using a Kinetex column \n(2.6 μm Biphenyl 100 Å, 100 × 2.1 mm; Phenomenex Companies Worldwide, Torrance, CA, USA), thermostatted \nat 40 °C. The mobile phases consisted of 0.1% aqueous formic acid solution (phase A) and methanol (phase B), \nwith a mobile phase flow rate of 0.4 ml/min.\nThe sample analysis was conducted using a gradient program: 0–0.4 min, isocratic flow at 5.0% (B); 0.4–\n0.5 min, linear gradient from 5 to 50% (B); 0.5–1.9 min, isocratic flow at 50% (B); 1.9–2.0 min, linear gradient \nto 100.0% (B); 2.0–2.9 min, isocratic flow at 100.0% (B); 2.9–4.0 min, linear gradient from 100 to 5.0% (B); \n4.0–5.0 min, isocratic separation at 5.0% (B). The injection volume was 2 µl, and the total run time for each \nsample was 5 min. The retention time for cortisol (COR; COR-d4) was 3.39 min.\nFor quantitative analysis, a Xevo TQ-S® mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems MDS Sciex; Concord, ON, \nCanada) was used in electrospray ionization (ESI) mode with positive ionization. The ion source parameters \nwere as follows: ion spray voltage (IS) at 5500 V; nebulizer gas (gas 1) at 30 psi; turbo gas (gas 2) at 20 psi; heated \nnebulizer temperature (TEM) at 300 °C; and curtain gas (CUR) at 30 psi. Quantitative assessment was performed \nin multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The ion pairs monitored were m/z = 363.11/120.92 for cortisol \n(COR) and m/z = 367.11/120.95 for cortisol-d4 (internal standard). Data were processed using MassLynx V4.2 \nsoftware (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA), and analyte concentrations were calculated relative to the \ninternal standard using a response factor.\nPreparation of saliva samples for cortisol analysis\nAfter thawing the saliva samples at 37  °C, they were mixed and centrifuged at 3500× g for 10  min at room \ntemperature. To 250  µl of the supernatant, 40  µl of the internal standard, cortisol-d3 (5  µg/ml), was added. \nThe mixture was dissolved in 200 µl of 10% methanol and analyzed via LC-MS/MS following the previously \ndescribed method.\nPreparation of saliva samples for serotonin analysis\nFrom the available methods for measuring serotonin (5-HT) levels in saliva, such as Enzyme-Linked \nImmunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Radioimmunoassay, we selected the reference method, i.e., Liquid \nChromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The advantage of this method over the others lies in its high \nsensitivity and selectivity, as well as its ability to perform precise measurements without interference from other \nsubstances53,54. The use of LC-MS/MS for serotonin analysis ensures high-quality data with minimal external \ninfluences55,56.\nTo 100 µl of the prepared saliva sample, 4 µl of the internal standard was added, containing a methanolic \nsolution of the deuterated serotonin derivative (serotonin-d4: SER-d4) at a concentration of 500 µg/ml, followed \nby mixing for 10 s. The prepared sample was deproteinized by adding 100 µl of acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) and mixed \nfor 30 s. The samples were centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 10 min at 15 °C. 100 µl of the supernatant was placed into \nchromatography vials and subjected to chromatographic analysis.\nChromatographic separation was performed using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC® H-Class liquid chromatograph \nsystem (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). The samples were separated on a ZIC®-HILIC column (5 μm, \nScientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:7328 4 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-90263-1www.nature.com/scientificreports/"

All \ncollected cortisol and serotonin results were normalized using natural logarithm transformations in Microsoft  \nExcel. Statistical significance tests (Kolomogorow-Smirnov test for normality, linear regression, independent \nstudent t-test, and MANOV A) were performed using SPSS and Statgraphic Centurion 19. A significance level \nof 0.05 was used for all statistical analysis. When conducting the t-test, we calculated Cohen’s d as a measure of \neffect size.\nIn the following step, correlation analysis was performed. Subsequently, the data were grouped using k-means \nclustering methods. K-means clustering is a supervised learning algorithm that aims to group various objects \nbased on their attributes in k number of groups (clusters). The number of clusters (denoted as “k”) is provided \nas the input. K points are chosen randomly from existing data as cluster centers, and each instance is calculated \nand assigned to its closest cluster center using a squared Euclidean distance metric. Each instance is grouped \namong clusters based on minimum Euclidean distances. The centroid (the mean for each cluster) is calculated \nand used as a new cluster center57.\nAll analyses were conducted independently for both the general SPS score (SPS) and the three factors \nidentified in the HSPS scale: Emotional Reactivity (SPS_ER), Sensing the Subtle (SPS_StS), and Overstimulation \n(SPS_Ovst)10,58.\nResults\nDue to the non-normal distributions and significant skewness observed in the levels of cortisol in hair and \nsaliva and serotonin in saliva, a logarithmic transformation was applied to these variables to normalize the \ndata. Following the logarithmic transformation of the data, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicated that the \ndistribution of the variables did not significantly deviate from normality (hair cortisol, p = 0.28; saliva cortisol, \np = 0.29; saliva serotonin, p = 0,88).\nAll statistical analyses between males ( n = 54; 34.4%) and females ( n = 103; 65.6%) were conducted using a \ntwo-tailed Student’s t-test. Additionally, Cohen’s d was employed to measure effect size. Significant differences \nwere observed between male and female participants in terms of age, Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS), \nEmotional Reactivity (SPS_ER), Sensing the Subtle (SPS_StS), Overstimulation (SPS_OvSt), and perceived \nstress ( p < 0.05). The effect size indicated a large and meaningful difference between males and females in age, \nSPS, SPS_StS, and SPS_OvSt. For SPS Factor I and perceived stress, the effect size fell within the medium range, \nstill indicating practical significance. However, no significant differences were found in biochemical analysis, \npositive and negative affect, patient discomfort, pain assessment, and behavioral indicators (Table  1).\nTable  1summarizes the results of biochemical indicators, psychological indicators of stress and general \ninformation taken from participants. It is worth noting the large standard deviation in hair cortisol levels. It was \nassumed that significant differences in the obtained results might occur due to numerous confounding factors \nreported in hair samples32, which could not have been sufficiently controlled in this study.\nCorrelation analysis\nA Pearson’s correlation analysis of selected variables was conducted to examine linear correlations. Table  2 \npresents the correlations between hormonal and psychological stress variables. The level of hair cortisol \nshowed a significant positive association with overall score of sensory processing sensitivity, tendency towards \noverstimulation (SPS_Ovst), and negative affect. However, all these correlations show weak associations. \nFurthermore, no associations were revealed between the level of cortisol and serotonin in saliva and any \npsychological measures, nor between the analyzed biochemical indicators (Table  2). Due to the absence of linear \nassociations between most of the biochemical and psychological results, as well as the lack of a basis to assume \npredictive relationships, cluster analysis was subsequently performed to identify distinct groups within the data \nbased on levels of biochemical indicators, as well as SPS scores.\nK-means clustering\nThree independent k-means clustering analyses were applied to the grouped individuals based on their cortisol \nand serotonin level in saliva as well as general index of individual sensitivity of sensory processing (SPS) and \nindividual aspects of SPS: emotional reactivity (SPS_ER), sensitivity to nuances (SPS_StS) and tendency towards \nScientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:7328 5 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-90263-1www.nature.com/scientificreports/"

This decision helps ensure the independence of variables and prevents potential \nconfounding effects.\nSensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS)\nThree variables were selected for cluster analysis: ln salivary cortisol, SPS (general index of individual sensitivity \nof sensory processing) and ln salivary serotonin. Based on the conducted analysis, two groups were identified \n(Fig.  1):\n 1)  A group of more-sensitive individuals with higher cortisol levels in saliva ( n = 75; 48%).\n 2)  A group of less-sensitive individuals with lower cortisol levels in saliva ( n = 81; 52%).\nIn the next stage, differences in the level of biochemical indicators and psychological variables between the \nidentified groups based on the above cluster analysis were examined.

      "text": "general score did not reveal associations between SPS and salivary serotonin, which is in line with Licht et al. ’s \nfindings59. The results of our study confirmed previous studies indicating that individuals with higher levels of \nsensory processing sensitivity report higher levels of perceived stress4,10, additionally, our results suggest that:\nIndividuals characterized by a higher level of sensory processing sensitivity show higher levels of cortisol (both \nin hair and saliva cortisol) .\nIndividuals with higher levels of sensory processing sensitivity show higher levels of negative affect while waiting \nfor a dental procedure.\nThus, hypothesis H1 and H3 have been confirmed. Our results are in line with previous findings that indicated \nassociations between SPS and dental anxiety24–26. In the light of these findings, it seems particularly important \nto consider possible strategies to manage patients’ stress and prevent the vicious cycle described by Armfield et \nal.22 in which a negative experience at a dental clinic may evoke fear that might lead to subsequent visits being \npostponed. Irregular dental care and delayed visits can lead to serious problems and symptom-driven treatment, \noften linked to pain and discomfort, which in turn may increase dental anxiety or phobia.\nWhen examining the clusters formed based on Emotional Reactivity, two groups were observed with \ndifferent neurohormonal responses: individuals with significantly higher and lower levels of salivary cortisol \nand serotonin. The group with higher cortisol and serotonin levels had also higher scores in Overstimulation. \nThis interesting result could be considered inconsistent with hypothesis H2, which assumed lower serotonin \nlevels in the high SPS group. However, regarding contradictory findings regarding the associations between \nSPS and serotonin secretion43,59, we may take into account the multidimensionality of the SPS construct when \ninterpreting these findings.\nFor Sensing the Subtle, the high sensitivity group was characterized by lower levels of salivary serotonin, \nhigher overall SPS scores and higher scores in Emotional Reactivity and Overstimulation. Only analysis with \nSensing the Subtle revealed distinct clusters that differentiated groups in serotonin level and scores in sensory \nsensitivity. The other factors and the overall SPS level were better differentiated by the cortisol level variable. This \nresult partly supports hypothesis H2, thus leading to the following conclusion:\nIndividuals with higher levels of sensing the subtle show lower levels of serotonin in saliva.\nIn the analysis of Overstimulation (SPS_OvSt), the high sensitivity group showed significantly higher levels \nof cortisol in both hair and saliva, as well as higher levels of salivary serotonin. This group also had higher \ngeneral SPS scores, SPS_ER and SPS_StS, indicating that individuals prone to overstimulation exhibit stronger \nneurohormonal responses and heightened sensitivity across multiple dimensions. Analyses based on SPS_ER \nand SPS_OvSt may be interpreted in line with greater reactivity to both positive and negative stimuli, as is often \nreported in highly sensitive individuals4. As Sperati et al.60 point out, highly sensitive individuals may experience \nmore challenges in negative environments, but also more benefits in positive ones, as compared to persons lower \nin SPS.\nThe cluster analysis based on different SPS factors indicates that exploring specific aspects of sensory processing \nsensitivity may bring different conclusions and supports the thesis regarding the complex characteristics of SPS \n[10,58]. This is in line with Corbett et al. ’s28study, which indicated different outcomes between sensory sensitivity \nand morning cortisol, depending on which aspect of SPS is examined. In this analysis, Sensing the Subtle \ncorresponds most to studies that associate SPS with a lower level of serotonin43. It may correspond to the results \nthat indicate negative associations between salivary serotonin concentration and trait empathy, happiness39, as \nwell as current mood61. However, no associations were found between salivary serotonin levels and symptoms \nof depression and anxiety61. Importantly, in the high sensory sensitivity groups which were identified on \nEmotional Reactivity and Overstimulation factors, higher levels of salivary serotonin were observed. Thus, it \nis particularly significant to emphasize that salivary serotonin levels showed varied relationships with different \nSPS factors, indicating the need to analyze SPS as a multidimensional construct. On the other hand, only the \ngeneral SPS score, which encompasses all tested factors (i.e., emotional reactivity, sensitivity to nuances, and \ntendency toward overstimulation), revealed differences associated with subjective psychological outcomes, such \nas perceived stress and negative affect. Therefore, analyzing the general SPS score also appears to be valuable.\nThe association between SPS and heightened reactivity is particularly relevant in the context of health care. \nIncreased reactivity in highly sensitive individuals may result in stronger responses to both negative and positive \nfactors associated with a dental visit60. It is important to note that various external stimuli lead to internal \nexperiences, such as emotions and memories, which can influence attitudes toward the treatment process. These \nexperiences may have further implications. For example, experiences during a dental visit – including those \nrelated to the procedure itself and interactions with medical staff – can impact how actively and systematically \npatients engage with future preventive and interventional procedures.\nThe findings underscore the importance of considering individual differences in sensitivity when assessing \nstress responses and suggest that heightened sensitivity is associated with increased physiological and \npsychological stress. This could be considered during a dental visit, offering substantial benefits for all dental \npatients, particularly for those with traits of high sensitivity. Referring directly to the dental context, Appukuttan62 \npresents a literature review on possible strategies to help patients with excessive emotional response. Studies \nshow that app. 12–15% of adults suffer from dental anxiety that leads to avoiding or delaying visits to the dentist, \nthus possibly resulting in increased caries, tooth loss, and serious health problems22,23,63,64. Understanding the \ndispositions and needs of patients with high sensory sensitivity could make it possible to offer solutions and \ninterventions, such as sensory-adapted dental environments (SDE), good patient–dentist relationship and trust \nbuilding, behavior-management techniques, relaxation techniques, guided imagery, distraction, enhancing \ncontrol, or positive reinforcement62.\nFinally, we would like to point out the limitations of the study and some implications for future research. The \nstudy’s quasi-experimental design allowed for natural conditions but lacked full control over the study variables. \nAn ideal approach would have involved conducting the study in a controlled experimental setting, with better \nScientific Reports  |         (2025) 15:7328 11 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-90263-1www.nature.com/scientificreports/"

Including additional \npsychological measures would allow for a deeper focus on how patients evaluate various aspects of their medical \nvisit. Qualitative research, such as interviews, could help identify factors that contribute to discomfort, anxiety, \nor fear, as well as those that promote a supportive environment and patients’ well-being. Combining biochemical \nstudies with in-depth psychological analysis could help improve healthcare by offering a deeper understanding \nof patients’ experiences. Lastly, another important aspect of dental patients with high SPS should be emphasized: \ntheir discomfort, negative emotions, negative attitudes and behaviors, or more serious dental problems are all \npossible significant sources of stress for dentists. If we now change the perspective and consider that also about \n30% of dentists may be highly sensitive persons, we may expect that not only patients experience problems. \nPlanning an empathetic, patient-centered approach may result in not only greater comfort and better and more \nregular dental treatment, but also less stressful work for dentists, which may consequently improve all systems \nin dental medicine. The results refer to dental patients but may be universal in different contexts of medical care.\nData availability\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article are available from the corresponding author (krystyna.\ngolonka@uj.edu.pl) upon reasonable request.\nReceived: 31 October 2024; Accepted: 11 February 2025\nReferences\n 1.
