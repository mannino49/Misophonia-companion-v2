The purpose of this systematicreview is to summarize (1) the range of presenting problems to which the UP has been applied with adult\npatients, and (2) the settings in which the protocol has been used, as well as any modifications made to it. Using\nPRISMA guidelines, we conducted a literature search of PsychInfo, PubMed, Proquest Dissertations and Theses,and Web of Science. The 77 studies included in this review indicated the UP has been applied to a wide range ofpresenting problems including anxiety, depressive, bipolar, traumatic-stressor, substance use, eating, borderline\npersonality, insomnia, and physical health disorders. Additionally, the UP has been applied to non-diagnosable\nproblems such as non-suicidal self-injury, subclinical presentations, and sexual minority stress. The strongestbase of evidence for the UP is among Caucasian females in the United States with anxiety-related or depressive\ndisorders. Numerous adaptions of the UP were present in the literature. Overall, results suggest the UP can be\nflexibly applied to a range of diagnostic presentations. However, many studies reviewed were preliminary andfurther research is needed.\nAnxiety, depressive, and related disorders (e.g., obsessive-compul-\nsive disorder [OCD], trauma and stressor-related disorders) are among\nthe most frequently occurring psychiatric conditions, with past-year\nprevalence rates of up to 19.1% in the United States (Harvard Medical\nSchool, 2007). These disorders are likely to co-occur, with lifetime\ncomorbidity estimates as high as 76% (Brown, Campbell, Lehman,\nGrisham, & Mancill, 2001). To account for these high rates of co-\nmorbidity, research has identified a number of shared features in-\ncluding overlap in diagnostic criteria (Brown & Barlow, 2009) andcommon neurobiological mechanisms (e.g., hyperexcitability of limbic\nstructures and limited inhibitory control by cortical structures; Etkin &\nWager, 2007; Mayberg et al., 1999; Porto et al., 2009; Shin & Liberzon,\n2010). Additionally, Barlow and colleagues have described a functional\nmodel to account for the development and maintenance of the full\nrange of these common conditions (Barlow, Ellard, Sauer-Zavala, Bullis,\n& Carl, 2014; Barlow, Sauer-Zavala, Carl, Bullis, & Ellard, 2014). In this\nmodel, anxiety, depressive, and related disorders are referred to asemotional disorders (Bullis, Boettcher, Sauer-Zavala, Farchione, &\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2020.101852\nReceived 28 September 2019; Received in revised form 5 February 2020; Accepted 4 April 2020⁎Corresponding author at: Cognitive Behavioral Research and Treatment Program, Center for Misophonia and Emotion Regulation, Department of Psychiatry and\nBehavioral Sciences, Duke University Medical Center, 2213 Elba St., Durham, NC 27710, USA.\nE-mail address: clair.robbins@duke.edu (C.

      "text": "Barlow, 2019) to highlight the causal role dysregulated emotions play\nfor these diagnoses. Specifically, emotional disorders are characterized\nby: 1) frequent and intense negative emotions, 2) aversive reactions to\nthese emotional experiences, including the perception of emotions as\nunacceptable or uncontrollable, and 3) engagement in avoidant reg-\nulation strategies to escape or suppress the experience of strong emo-\ntions (Sauer-Zavala & Barlow, 2014).\nDespite ample evidence for common psychopathological mechan-\nisms across the range of emotional disorders, at least 51 separate\ntreatments for these conditions have been described that have amassed,\nat minimum, modest research support (American Psychological\nAssociation, Division 12, 2019). The proliferation of treatment manuals\ndesigned to target single diagnoses represents a barrier to the dis-\nsemination of empirically-supported interventions (McHugh, Murray, &\nBarlow, 2009). Specifically, a separate manual for each Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual (DSM; e.g., American Psychiatric Association [APA],\n2013) disorder creates a training burden for clinicians in routine\npractice who must receive costly and time-consuming training in mul-\ntiple approaches to meet the needs of complex caseloads. Additionally,\ndisorder-specific interventions typically do not address real-world pa-\ntient presentations that, as described earlier, are characterized by a\nhigh degree of comorbidity.\nIn response to these issues, the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic\nTreatment of Emotional Disorders (UP; Barlow, Allen, & Choate, 2004;\nBarlow et al., 2011; Barlow et al., 2018; Barlow et al., 2018;\nWilamowska et al., 2010) was developed to treat the range of psy-\nchiatric disorders characterized by the functional model described\npreviously. The UP explicitly targets shared mechanisms (i.e., aversive,\navoidant reactions to strong emotional experiences) via eight treatment\nmodules that focus on: 1) setting goals and increasing motivation for\ntreatment, 2) psychoeducation on the adaptive nature of emotional\nexperiences, 3) mindful emotion awareness (i.e., mindfulness), 4) cog-\nnitive flexibility (i.e., developing more balanced, alternative thoughts),5) changing the action tendencies associated with strong emotions, 6)\ninteroceptive exposures, 7) emotion exposures, and 8) relapse preven-\ntion (described in detail in Payne, Ellard, Farchione, Fairholme, &\nBarlow, 2014). The modules are designed to facilitate patients' adoption\nof a willing, approach-oriented stance toward emotional experiences;\nincreasing acceptance of emotions reduces reliance on avoidant coping\nthat has been shown to paradoxically increase the frequency/intensity\nof emotions (Campbell-Sills, Barlow, Brown, & Hofmann, 2006), as well\nas to exacerbate disorder symptoms (e.g., Purdon, 2004). Thus, by\ntargeting shared mechanisms, the UP offers practical advantages over\nsingle-disorder protocols, most notably the ability to facilitate more\nefficient treatment for a wide range of presenting problems.\nThere is promising emerging evidence to support the UP's efficacy in\naddressing emotional disorders. For example, in early open- and wait-\nlist-controlled trials conducted by its developers, the UP demonstrated\nlarge reductions in anxiety symptoms (Ellard, Fairholme, Boisseau,\nFarchione, & Barlow, 2010; Farchione et al., 2012). Additionally, re-\nsults from a recent, large equivalence trial suggest that the UP is as-sociated with comparable symptom improvement for primary anxiety-\nrelated disorders as single-disorder protocols designed explicitly for\nthat condition (Barlow et al., 2017). Moreover, a recent meta-analysis\n(Sakiris & Berle, 2019) of the UP found moderate to large effect sizes for\nimprovement in depression and anxiety (respectively) when the UP was\ncompared to TAU, waitlist, and medication. The researchers also in-\ndicated the UP led to moderate increases in adaptive emotion regula-\ntion strategies and decreases in maladaptive strategies.\n1. Transdiagnostic mechanism-based interventions have greater\npotential for adaptability\nThere are several qualities of the UP that make this intervention\nparticularly adaptable from setting to setting, increasing the likelihoodof its widespread dissemination. Indeed, clinicians in routine practiceprefer flexible treatments (i.e., those that provide the clinician with theability to choose the order of skills presented and the amount of time\nspent teaching each skill) which allow for the execution of principles of\nchange individually tailored to each patient (Addis & Krasnow, 2000;\nMcHugh et al., 2009; Persons, 2006), and may be more likely to use an\nempirically-based intervention if it can be readily adapted.\nFirst, the UP can be used to intervene on anyemotion causing dis-\ntress and interference in an individual's life, allowing it to be tailored toa wide variety of presenting problems. By utilizing an emotion-focused\nfunctional model (instead of a diagnosis-specific model) to determine\nwhether a patient can benefit from the UP, this treatment can more\neasily be applied beyond anxiety-related and depressive disorders. For\ninstance, individuals with eating disorders, borderline personality dis-\norder, insomnia, and substance use disorders may display aversive,\navoidant reactions to frequently occurring negative emotions (see Bullis\net al., 2019), underscoring the transdiagnostic and adaptable nature of\nthe UP. Second, there is evidence to suggest the UP can be applied to\npresenting problems that are not diagnoses as defined in the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.;DSM-5, American\nPsychiatric Association [APA], 2013), including non-suicidal self-injury\n(NSSI; Bentley, Nock, & Barlow, 2014), suicidal thoughts and behaviors\n(Bentley et al., 2017), and dysregulated anger (Cassiello-Robbins &\nBarlow, 2016).\nAdding further to its adaptability, modular treatments, like the UP,\nare designed to be flexible with regard to both the order in which skills\nare delivered as well as the amount of time spent on a given treatment\ncomponent, providing an opportunity for treatment personalization\n(Chorpita & Weisz, 2009). Chorpita, Daleiden, and Weisz (2005) de-\nscribe modular treatments as comprising modules that are self-con-tained and do not rely on each other in order to produce their intended\neffects. These treatments thus differ from integrated treatments that are\ncumulative and need to be delivered in a specific sequence. Modular\ntreatments have demonstrated steeper trajectories of improvementcompared to traditional manualized treatment suggesting this approach\nimproves treatment efficiency (Weisz et al., 2012). The UP was ori-\nginally described as modular in that time spent focusing on a given skill\ncould be shortened or extended based on the needs of the patient\n(Wilamowska et al., 2010), although in its standard presentation, the\nUP is an integrated treatment in which each module builds on the one\nbefore it. More recent examinations of the UP have begun to test its\nmodularity with regard to Chorpita et al.'s (2005) definition. Indeed,\nemerging evidence suggests the UP modules can be presented in-dependently from one another (Sauer-Zavala et al., 2017) and re-or-\ndered based on individual patient characteristics (Sauer-Zavala,\nCassiello-Robbins, Ametaj, Wilner, & Pagan, 2019), paving the way for\nadditional adaptations tailored to unique delivery settings.\n1.1. Present study\nThe purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the ways in\nwhich the UP has been flexibly applied by reviewing (1) the full range\nof presenting problems it has been used to address, as well as (2) the\nsettings in which the protocol has been used, including any modifica-\ntions that were made. This study extends the previous meta-analysis by\nSakiris and Berle (2019) which focused more narrowly on the UP's ef-\nfect on anxiety-related and depressive symptoms, emotion regulation,\nand affect; though the attention to these outcomes is understandable\ngiven the constraints of calculating meta-analytic statistics (i.e., the\nneed to include studies with enough appropriate data to compute effect\nsizes), this approach neglects the wide range of presenting problems\nbeyond anxiety and depression to which the UP has been applied. Ad-\nditionally, previous reviews have not highlighted the diversity in pro-\ntocol modifications that have been executed with the UP. A qualitative\ndescription of the ways in which the protocol has been modified and the\nsuccess of such adaptations will further clarify the flexibility of this\ntreatment.C.

Method\nThis review was conducted in accordance with the standard set by\nthe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-\nAnalyses (PRISMA) statement (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, & Altman,\n2009).\n2.1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria\nThe present review included studies that met the following criteria:\n1) a treatment study that 2) reported using any modification of Barlow\nand colleagues' Unified Protocol (e.g., the full protocol, UP modules, UP\nskills, UP-based treatment), and 3) included original data, 4) on adult\npatients, and was available in 5) full text and 6) in English. Because the\nUP was originally designed as an adult treatment and developed rela-\ntively independently from the child and adolescent versions of the UP\n(Ehrenreich-May et al., 2018), and there are distinct developmental\nconsiderations present in clinical research treatments for children and\nadolescents (e.g., explicit caregiver involvement; outcome ratings by\nchildren vs. parents; differences in childhood and adult experiences of\ndisorders), this review focused on applications of the UP to adults in\norder to allow for streamlined conclusions regarding adult populations.\nStudies derived from the same treatment trials but with non-over-\nlapping, original data were included. Studies were excluded if they did\nnot meet all inclusion criteria.\n2.2. Search strategy, article selection, and data extraction\nA comprehensive literature review of four databases (PsychInfo,\nPubMed, Proquest Dissertations and Theses, and Web of Science) was\nconducted from the earliest inclusive dates until March 17, 2019. An\nadditional literature review from March 17, 2019 until August 26, 2019\nwas conducted to identify relevant studies published while this reviewwas in preparation. The search strategy included permutations of terms\nrelated to the UP (Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of\nEmotional Disorders, Unified Protocol) and terms relevant to inter-\nvention studies (clinical trial, effectiveness, evaluation, open trial,\nrandomized, single case experimental design, treatment, therapy, in-\ntervention, empirical study, pilot). Additionally, the first author (CCR)\nreviewed the reference section of coded articles to identify potential\narticles the original search may have missed. Additional details re-\ngarding the literature search are available from the first author upon\nrequest.\nThe first three authors (CCR, MWS, JWT) participated in study se-\nlection and data extraction. One coder independently reviewed and\ndetermined each study's eligibility based on title and then abstract.\nOnce relevant articles were identified, two coders reviewed the full text\nof each article to determine its eligibility for this review. Coders had\n95.82% agreement on which articles were eligible after reviewing the\nfull text. After identifying relevant articles, two coders independently\nextracted data from each study; discrepancies were resolved through\ndiscussion. The total agreement between coders was 87.57% for data\nextraction. The first author (CCR) also coded each study for information\nregarding fidelity ratings and training procedures relevant to the UP to\nassess the quality of each study. Twenty percent of the articles were\nchosen at random by the second author (MWS) and double coded.\nAgreement for study quality coding was 99%.\n3. Results3.1. Description of included studies\nFig. 1 presents the study selection process. The initial search yielded\na total of 7244 unique publications. After examining titles andabstracts, 263 articles were considered for further review. After re-\nviewing the full text of these articles, 76 were determined to be eligible\nfor the current review and are presented in Appendix A. All references\nincluded in the results section of this paper (and Appendix A) are\navailable in Appendix C. Because one article (Ellard et al., 2010) in-\ncluded two studies, 77 studies are reported in this review. All includedstudies are presented in Appendix A, which is organized hierarchically\nby 1) principal diagnosis examined and 2) alphabetically by author. Allstudies were published after 2010 and over half of the studies were\npublished between 2017 and 2019. Throughout the results we will use k\nto denote the number of studies and n\nUPto denote the number of pa-\ntients who received the UP across indicated studies.\nOf the studies reviewed, 31 were randomized controlled trials\n(RCTs), 21 were open trials, 14 used a single case experimental design(SCED), nine were case studies, two were implementation studies, and\ntwo were case series. Over half of studies (k = 50) did not have an\nactive psychosocial treatment as the comparison condition. However, in\nthe RCTs reviewed, the comparison conditions included waitlist\n(k = 14), treatment as usual (k = 2), and active psychosocial treat-\nments (k = 17). Active psychosocial comparison treatments included\nextant evidence-based treatments for the target disorder(s), standard\ntreatment provided prior to implementation of the UP, an altered ver-\nsion of the UP, and supportive counseling.\nWith regard to reported fidelity assessments and training procedures\n(Appendix B), 20 studies (25.97%) either used data from another trial\n(i.e., secondary analyses), were the original treatment development\nstudies, or were internet-delivered treatment and thus these metrics\nwere not applicable. Of the remaining 57 studies, 12 (21.05%) reported\nadherence ratings with all but one study (Bentley, Sauer-Zavala,\nStevens, & Washburn, 2018) reporting excellent adherence and/or ad-\nherence over 80% adherence to the UP across rated sessions. Ad-\nditionally, 13 studies (22.81%) reported that adherence ratings were\nconducted and/or that adherence was monitored in ongoing super-\nvision but did not provide any data about treatment adherence; the\nremaining studies (k = 32) either provided no information about ad-\nherence ratings or only indicated the UP Therapist Guide was followed\nbut did not indicate how adherence was ensured. Of the 59 studies that\nwere not treatment development studies, internet-delivered, or sec-\nondary analyses, 25 (42.37%) indicated therapists received UP-specific\ntraining (e.g., attended a workshop, received certification in UP de-\nlivery from the treatment developers). The remaining studies (k = 34)\ndid not report UP-specific therapist training procedures.\n3.2. Settings and modality\nResults indicated the UP has been implemented in several countries,\nmost commonly in the United States (k = 46). It has also been tested in\nIran (k = 15), Spain (k = 4), Sweden (k = 3) Brazil (k = 2), the United\nKingdom (k = 2), Canada (k = 1), Denmark (k = 1), Hong Kong\n(k = 1), Saudi Arabia (k = 1), and Japan (k = 1). Of note, this result\ndescribes the number of studies published in English that report the use\nof the UP; it does not indicate how many UP studies may be published\nin non-English languages. Overall, results from these studies indicate\nthe treatment was able to achieve its intended effects in countries\noutside the one in which it was developed (the United States).\nWith regard to treatment settings, the UP has been primarily tested\nin outpatient settings (k = 69). It has also been evaluated in hospital\nsettings (e.g., inpatient, crisis stabilization units; k = 3) and a re-\nsidential treatment facility for eating disorders (k = 2). Interestingly,\nthree studies utilized an internet-delivered version of the UP, and one\nstudy offered a choice of internet-delivered or outpatient treatment.\nThe internet-delivered adaptations of the UP reported small or non-\nsignificant treatment effects. Overall, the results from these studies\nindicate the UP has been able to achieve its intended effects inC. Cassiello-Robbins, et al. Clinical Psychology Review 78 (2020) 101852\n3"

      "text": "outpatient settings and when holistically incorporated into a residential\ntreatment facility. However, the UP has demonstrated similar effects as\nTAU conditions when not holistically incorporated into hospital and\ninternet-delivered settings.\nFinally, treatment was commonly delivered individually (k = 59),\nalthough group delivery was also noted (k = 17), and one study did not\nspecify this mode of delivery. Both individual and group delivery for-\nmats of the UP tended to lead to improvements in the targeted symp-\ntoms, suggesting the feasibility of adapting the UP to different numbers\nof patients.\n3.3. Modifications to the UP\nTwenty-six studies (34%) reported UP delivery was not modified\nfrom the manual. Seven of these papers were derived from Farchione\net al., 2012 and six were derived from Barlow et al., 2017; thus, these\n13 papers do not represent independent studies in which the UP was\ndelivered without modification. The majority of studies reviewed made\nat least some modification to the UP (k = 51; 66%).\nThe alterations made to the UP protocol varied widely from study to\nstudy. Some modifications such as changing session duration/fre-\nquency, translating the manual into another language, or incorporating\nexamples relevant to a certain condition (e.g., NSSI or insomnia), might\nbe considered relatively minor as they involve little alteration totreatment content.\nLarger alterations to the protocol included reordering or omitting\nmodules (Sauer-Zavala et al., 2017; Sauer-Zavala et al., 2019), in-\ncorporating content from other evidence-based treatments (e.g., behavioralactivation, Farchione et al., 2017; dialectical behavior therapy, Gonzáles-\nRobles et al., 2019), and incorporating UP theory with other models of\nunderstanding behavior (e.g., minority stress experience; Pachankis et al.,\n2015; Parsons et al., 2017). Studies making these types of alterations often\ngrounded their treatment in the UP and continued to work in the UP fra-\nmework while rearranging the protocol or adding supplementary material.\nOverall, the results of these studies suggest modifications to the treatment\nwere largely acceptable and feasible to patients and therapists and resulted\nin efficacious outcomes (i.e., symptom reduction).\nPerhaps the largest scale modifications occurred when the UP was\napplied to unique treatment settings such as residential treatment fa-\ncilities (Thompson-Brenner et al., 2018a, 2018b), hospitals (Bentley\net al., 2018), and community mental health clinics (Sauer-Zavala et al.,\n2019). For example, for settings in which patients are present for most\nor all of the day, UP exercises were expanded and varied to ensure\npatients at different levels of care could benefit, while all staff members\n(e.g., nutritionists, nurses) were also trained to be familiar with UP\nconcepts to use them clinically. For settings in which reading was an\nanticipated barrier to treatment, the length and complexity of the\nprotocol was reduced (e.g., Castro-Camacho et al., 2018). While some\nFig. 1.

      "text": "studies noted an improvement in outcomes after implementation\n(Thompson-Brenner et al., 2018a; 2018b) others did not (Bentley et al.,\n2018). Further, the acceptability and feasibility of UP implementation\nwas mixed. Two studies suggested successful implementation in a re-\nsidential treatment facility for eating disorders (Thompson-Brenner\net al., 2018a; 2018b). On the other hand, Bentley et al. (2018) noted\nclinician fidelity to the protocol was variable after its implementation in\na hospital setting. Additionally, Sauer-Zavala et al. (2019) noted pa-\ntients with opioid use disorders in a community mental health clinic for\nthe homeless sometimes refused to participate in UP sessions. Such\nfindings suggest that, although the UP is often acceptable to patients\nand clinicians, this is not uniformly the case.\n3.4. Patient characteristics\nAppendix A reports the majority demographics present in each\nstudy sample. Sixty studies examined predominantly female samples\nwhile six used exclusively male samples. The remaining studies did not\nlist the demographics of the UP group specifically. Of note, four of the\nsix studies with a majority of male patients were case studies. In 25\nstudies, the majority of patients identified as Caucasian and in only\nthree studies was the majority of the sample African-American. These\nresults suggest the majority of patients treated with the UP in research\nstudies have been Caucasian and female.\nOverall, the studies reviewed examined diagnostically hetero-\ngeneous samples, with the full range of emotional disorders represented\n(anxiety, depressive, bipolar, eating, borderline personality, somatic\nsymptom, trauma-related, and insomnia). The most common diagnoses\npresent in the study samples were anxiety disorders (79%) and de-\npressive disorders (69%). Twenty-six studies (34%) included patients\nwith post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Five studies included pa-\ntients with bipolar disorders and five studied patients with borderline\npersonality disorder (BPD). Interestingly, some presentations that might\nnot be immediately considered emotional disorders, such as substance\nuse disorders (k = 3), impulse control disorder (k = 1), attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder (k = 3), were also present in the study\nsamples, albeit to a much lesser extent.\nIn line with the functional model of emotional disorders, the UP was\nalso applied to presenting problems not classified as diagnoses in DSM-\n5. Two studies specifically included patients engaging in NSSI (Bentleyet al. 2017a, 2017c) and one study looked at the effects of the UP on\nanger (Cassiello-Robbins et al., 2018), although dysregulated anger was\nnot an inclusion criterion for the sample. Two studies applied the UP to\ncompulsive, risky sexual behavior. Additionally, five studies applied\nthis protocol to address the emotional sequelae present with medical\ndisorders (chronic pain [k = 2], irritable bowel syndrome [k = 1],\ninfertility [k = 1], and Parkinson's disease [k = 1]). Finally, studies\napplied the UP to subclinical presentations of anxiety/depression\n(k = 2) and paranoia (k = 1). In the following sections, we review the\nevidence supporting the use of the UP with different disorders.\n3.4.1. Primary anxiety-related disorders with/without comorbid depressive\ndisorder\nThe majority of studies reviewed (k = 33) focused on patients with\na primary diagnosis of an anxiety-related disorder. Of note, while ob-\nsessive-compulsive and related disorders are no longer considered an-\nxiety disorders in DSM-5, they are included in this section as they were\nclassified as anxiety disorders in DSM-IV, when a number of these\nstudies were conducted. Given the large number of studies present for\nthis class of disorders, we will first review studies that delivered the UP\nwith no modifications and then those that modified the protocol in\nsome way.3.4.1.1. Studies using standard UP. One case study described a patientwho achieved responder status without high-end state functioning\nregarding OCD and panic disorder with agoraphobia diagnoses. This\npatient also reported improvements in anxiety, depressive, and panic\nsymptoms, time spent on obsessions and compulsions, and\ninterpersonal relationships (Boisseau et al., 2010). Through five open\ntrials conducted in three countries (US, Japan, Spain; n\nUP= 61), the UP\ndemonstrated preliminary efficacy in treating anxiety disorders with orwithout comorbid mood disorders, in both individual and group\nformats (Bullis et al., 2015; Ellard et al., 2010; Ito et al., 2016; Osma\net al., 2015).\nThe UP has also demonstrated significant improvements in anxiety-\nrelated and depressive symptoms compared to waitlist in the UnitedStates and Iran (Farchione et al., 2012; Khakpoor, Baytmar, & Saed,\n2019; Mohajerin, Bakhtiyar, Olesnycky, Dolatshahi, & Motabi, 2019;\nZemestani, Imani, Ottaviani, 2017). Farchione et al. (2012) indicated\nthe UP led to greater improvements in diagnostic severity and func-\ntioning compared to waitlist (e.g., delayed treatment). Additional\nanalyses of the data from this trial indicated that, compared to waitlist,\nthe UP led to medium-to-large improvements in negative affect, work/\nsocial adjustment, positive affect, and self-esteem, with smaller relative\nimprovements in quality of life, intolerance of uncertainty, neuroti-\ncism/behavioral inhibition, and extraversion/behavioral activation\n(Boswell et al., 2013b; Carl et al., 2014; Gallagher et al., 2013). When\nall patients who completed the UP (either immediately or delayed) in\ntheFarchione et al. (2012) trial were considered (n = 37), improve-\nments in diagnostic severity, work/social adjustment, and positive af-fect were generally maintained 18 months post-treatment, while pa-\ntients reported some regression in anxiety-related and depressive\nsymptoms and negative affect (Bullis et al., 2014). Beyond anxiety-re-\nlated and depressive symptoms, the UP led to decreases in anxiety\nsensitivity that were associated with lower post-treatment clinical se-\nverity (Boswell et al., 2013a) and lower likelihood thought-action fu-\nsion but no change in moral thought-action fusion (Thompson-Hollands\net al., 2013). With regard to moderators of outcomes, higher baseline\nsymptom severity generally predicted less change in anxiety-related\nand depressive symptoms across treatment; however, among patients\nexhibiting higher readiness to change, greater baseline symptom se-\nverity predicted greater change in anxiety-related and depressive\nsymptoms (Boswell et al., 2012). Although the UP was rated as more\ncredible than typical CBT, patients had similar expectancies of im-\nprovement in the UP as in typical CBT, and neither credibility nor ex-\npectancy was related to treatment outcomes (Thompson-Hollands et al.,\n2014). One study specifically examined patients with primary body\ndysmorphic disorder (BDD; Khakpoor et al., 2019) and reported the UP\nled to greater decreases in BDD and depressive symptoms, appearance\nanxiety, emotion dysregulation, and delusional beliefs than waitlist,\nwhich were generally maintained at 3-month follow-up.\nFinally, the UP has been compared to other active treatments. In the\nlargest RCT in the United States to date, Barlow et al. (2017) compared\nthe UP to four single-disorder CBT protocols (SDPs) and waitlist.Compared to SDPs, the UP led to similar improvements in diagnostic\nseverity, anxiety-related and depressive symptoms, work/social ad-\njustment, hope, quality of life, savoring beliefs, positive affect, and\nnumber of comorbid disorders (Barlow et al., 2017; Gallagher et al.,\n2019; Steele et al., 2018; Wilner Tirpak et al., 2019). The UP led to\ngreater improvements on all these measures compared to waitlist con-\ntrol. A similar percentage of patients no longer met criteria for their\nprimary diagnosis in the UP (63.6%) and SDP (57.1%) conditions at the\nend of treatment, and these gains tended to be maintained at 6-month\nfollow-up (Barlow et al., 2017; Wilner et al., 2018). In a subsample of\npatients from this study, the UP led to small, nonsignificant decreases in\nanger while SDPs led to moderate, nonsignificant increases in angerC. Cassiello-Robbins, et al.

At a mechanistic level, the working\nalliance mediated the effect of pre-treatment expectancies and changes\nin anxiety-related symptoms in SDPs but not in the UP (Sauer-Zavala\net al., 2018a). Lotfi et al. (2014) also compared the UP to SDPs and\nfound the UP led to greater decreases in anxiety symptoms, but similar\nimprovements in depressive symptoms and quality of life.\nAmong patients with anxiety or depressive disorders in Brazil, the\nUP led to significantly larger decreases in anxiety and depressive\nsymptoms than a medication-only condition (de Ornelas Maia, Nardi, &\nCardoso, 2015). In Spain, a study compared standard UP to the UP with\nan additional four-module component on the regulation of positive\naffect. The treatments led to similar pre- to post-treatment improve-\nments in anxiety and depressive symptoms, positive and negative affect,\nand quality of life, which were generally maintained at 3-month follow-\nup (González-Robles et al., 2019). Further, 58–67% of patients no\nlonger met criteria for any mental disorder at post-treatment, similar to\nEllard et al., 2010.\n3.4.1.2. Studies using modified UP. An internet-delivered UP was\nprovided to pregnant women with a primary fear of giving birth in\nSweden (n UP= 127) compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU; Rondung\net al., 2018). Although patients in TAU reported lower fear of birth atpost-treatment, patients in the UP reported lower fear of birth at 1-year\nfollow-up. It is noteworthy that patients only spent an average of\n40 min on the UP (time spent on TAU was unavailable).\nSeveral single-case experimental design studies (SCEDs) have also\nbeen conducted with modified versions of the UP for people with an-\nxiety-related and comorbid mood disorders. Among patients with gen-\neralized anxiety disorder (GAD), mantra-based meditation was added to\nstandard UP after 1 or 3 weeks of treatment (Cooney Roxbury, 2017).\nAll patients remitted from GAD at post-treatment. Standard UP led to\nsimilar improvements in worry, anxiety, sleep impairment, work/social\nadjustment, negative affect, self-compassion, and mindfulness, whereas\nUP+mantra meditation led to steeper improvements in depressive\nsymptoms, quality of life, emotion dysregulation, and positive affect.\nAmong patients randomized to receive the UP modules in a persona-\nlized order prioritizing their relative strengths or weaknesses, those\nwhose order of UP modules prioritized their strengths exhibited earlier\nimprovements in anxiety and depressive symptoms and experiential\navoidance (Sauer-Zavala et al., 2019). Brake et al. (2016) asked patients\nwith an anxiety disorder (n = 7) to complete exposure exercises while\nengaging in UP mindfulness skills or avoidance strategies. They found\nthat UP mindfulness skills were associated with higher overall distress\nbut greater intra-exposure declines in distress than avoidance strate-\ngies.\nFinally, one case series reported on one patient completing standard\nUP with behavioral activation strategies incorporated (Boswell et al.,\n2017). The patient reported decreases in anxiety and depressive\nsymptoms, worry, and stress.\n3.4.1.3. Summary. Taken together, these results suggest that the UP is\nan efficacious treatment for people with anxiety-related disorder(s) and\ncomorbid mood disorder(s). Specifically, the UP has led to\nimprovements in diagnostic severity, anxiety-related and depressive\nsymptoms, quality of life, work/social adjustment, hope, positive affect,\nand comorbid diagnoses that are similar to SDPs and greater than\nwaitlist. Some evidence supports unique effects of the UP on anxiety\nsymptoms, anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty, likelihood\nthought-action fusion, and anger, although these effects are either\nsmaller sized or reported in smaller samples. There is some evidence the\nUP has been effectively implemented cross-culturally in Spain, Japan,\nIran, and Brazil with similar results as in American studies. Based on thepreliminary evidence here, the UP may be successfully modified by\nprioritizing patient strengths early in treatment, incorporating\nbehavioral activation principles, and adding a dedicated mantra\nmeditation component. However, if delivered as an online\nintervention, practitioners may need to supplement the UP with\nfurther support to increase patient engagement.\n3.4.2. Primary depressive disorder\nTwo RCTs and three case studies of the UP in an unmodified or\ngroup form have been conducted among patients with a primary de-\npressive disorder. The RCTs, which took place in the UK and Iran,\ncompared the UP to waitlist control (Marnoch, 2014) or English-lan-\nguage training (Bameshgi et al., 2019). Both studies indicated the UP\nled to improvements in anxiety and depression compared to waitlist.\nAdditionally, Bameshgi et al. (2019), who recruited patients with de-\npression and marital problems, noted improvements in three relation-\nship communication patterns: mutual avoidance, mutually constructive\ncommunication, and demanding/withdrawing behaviors. In an open\ntrial of a UP group for depressive disorders in Brazil, patients reported\nlarge improvements from pre- to post-treatment in depression and an-\nxiety symptoms, quality of life, physical health and sexuality, and social\nrelationships (de Ornelas Maia, Braga, Nunes, Nardi, & Silva, 2013).\nTwo case studies and a SCED with one patient reported improvements\nin symptoms of depression and anxiety from pre- to post-treatment\n(Boswell, Anderson, & Barlow, 2014; Hague, Scott, & Kellett, 2015;\nOsma, Sánchez-Gómez, & Peris-Baquero, 2018). These studies took\nplace in the United States, UK, and Spain. Of note, one study reported\ncontinued gains or improvement over 12-month follow-up on symp-\ntoms of depression, positive and negative affect, and quality of life, but\nnot anxiety symptoms (Osma et al., 2018). Another study noted the\nreturn of GAD at 3-month follow-up (Hague et al., 2015).\n3.4.2.1. Studies using modified UP. Three case studies with relatively\nminor modifications to the UP have been conducted. A woman in the\nUnited States with major depressive disorder (MDD) received the UP,\nmodified to include aspects of behavioral activation (e.g., values\nidentification, activity scheduling; Farchione, Boswell, & Wilner,\n2017). This treatment led to improvements in depressive and anxiety\nsymptoms, neuroticism/behavioral inhibition, extraversion/behavioral\nactivation, negative and positive affect, and interpersonal problems. A\nwoman in the United States with MDD and GAD received the UP,\nmodified to include assertiveness training and grief processing\n(Donahue, Hormes, Gordis, & Anderson, 2019). The UP led to\nimprovements in depressive symptoms to minimal levels, although\nanxiety symptoms remained in the clinical range. Finally, a woman in\nColombia with MDD, PTSD, GAD, and panic disorder (PD) received the\nUP, adapted to better match her cultural context (e.g., including an\norientation session, focusing on difficulties functioning instead of\ndiagnoses; Castro-Camacho et al., 2019). She experienced full\nreductions in depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms, as well as\nheadaches, sleep difficulties, and uncomfortable physical sensations,\nwhich were generally maintained over 3-month and 2-year follow-up.\nThe UP has also been modified to treat suicidal thoughts and be-\nhaviors among inpatients with MDD and anxiety disorders (Bentley\net al., 2017). In this study, the UP was shortened to five sessions fo-\ncusing on core modules. Compared to TAU, UP+TAU led to similar\nimprovements in depressive and anxiety symptoms, hopelessness, and\noverall psychopathology from pre- to post-treatment. These gains were\npartially reversed at 1- and 6-month follow-up.\n3.4.2.2. Summary. The UP has been studied relatively infrequently\n(k = 10) among patients with a primary depressive disorderC.

      "text": "(nUP= 59). Among these studies, the UP appears to reliably lead to\nreductions in depressive symptoms and improvements in quality of life.\nHowever, the UP may be less efficacious at reducing or maintaining\nreductions in comorbid anxiety symptoms among these patients. The\nUP also appears to demonstrate good preliminary efficacy cross-\nculturally and for older patients, specifically. Finally, the UP may be\neither supplemented with additional modules or simplified to five core\ndaily modules, depending on the setting and population, and still\nachieve promising outcomes.\n3.4.3. Mixed emotional and related disorders\nSeveral studies recruited patient samples with an array of diagnoses.\nSpecifically, one RCT, three open trials, one pre-post implementation\nstudy, and two SCEDs have been conducted on the UP for patients with\nmixed emotional and related disorders. The RCT, conducted in Hong\nKong, included patients with depressive, anxiety, adjustment, eating,\nand/or insomnia disorders randomized to receive a 15-week modified\nversion of group UP (n = 54) or a CBT group. UP modifications in-\ncluded re-ordering of some modules, teaching distress tolerance skillsfrom dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and including an individual\nsession after the group sessions. The UP group led to greater improve-\nments in depressive and anxiety symptoms, and clinical severity at post-\ntreatment but not positive or negative affect. The UP also led to greater\nimprovements in stress and work/social adjustment by 9-month follow-\nup (Ling, 2018).\nThree open trials (n\nUP= 516) took place in the US (with a Veteran\nsample), Iran, and Denmark (Alatiq et al., 2019; Reinholt et al., 2016;\nVarkovitsky, Sherrill, & Reger, 2018). These studies included patients\nwith PTSD, depressive disorders, sleep-wake disorders, substance use\ndisorders, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, OCD,\npanic disorder, social anxiety disorder, conversion disorder, specific\nphobia, complicated grief, somatic, eating, personality, and attention\ndeficit/hyperactivity disorders. Two studies delivered the UP in groupformat (Reinholt et al., 2016; Varkovitsky, et al., 2018). Alatiq et al.\n(2019) made modifications to the UP including cultural adaptations in\nstyle and examples used and structural modifications (e.g., including a\ngreater reliance on case formulation to determine the timing of module\ncomponents). Overall, these studies indicated the UP led to improve-\nments in symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as emotion reg-\nulation (Varkovitsky et al., 2018), functioning, and quality of life\n(Alatiq et al., 2019; Reinholt et al., 2016).\nIn a pre-post implementation study in the United States, the UP was\nadapted for an inpatient setting to be delivered over 7 days and to in-\ncorporate explicit emotion-induction exercises (Bentley et al., 2018).\nPatients were diagnosed with mood, anxiety, substance use, somatic,\nand/or eating disorders. While the UP was generally viewed as accep-\ntable, the Mindful Emotion Awareness module was rated as the most\nacceptable and the Motivation Enhancement module was viewed as\nleast acceptable. The UP led to similar improvements in depression and\nanxiety symptoms, suicidality, and emotion dysregulation as the pre-UP\nTAU.\nOne SCED study examined the effects of the UP modified to in-\ncorporate skills targeting repetitive negative thinking and reported\nlarge improvements in clinical severity, depression, and anxiety (Akbari\net al., 2015). Finally, in a SCED conducted in the United States, patients\nwith an emotional disorder received 4 weeks of a single UP module.\nEach module demonstrated both specific effects on its intended out-\ncome (e.g., Mindful Emotion Awareness module predicting changes in\nmindfulness) and general effects (e.g., Mindful Emotion Awareness\nmodule predicting changes in cognitive flexibility, behavioral ap-\nproach, and emotional acceptance; Sauer-Zavala et al., 2017).\n3.4.3.1. Summary. These results (k = 7) suggest the UP is generallyefficacious for outpatients with a range of emotional and relateddisorders and that the UP can be delivered in group settings to\npatients with a variety of diagnostic presentations. Additionally,\nresults suggest the UP may be modified for group settings and\nproduce greater improvements than other CBT groups on depressive\nand anxiety symptoms and clinical severity. The UP may be applied to\nVeterans and cross-cultural samples with good efficacy, although more\nresearch is needed to strengthen this conclusion. The UP may produce\nsimilar improvements as TAU among inpatients. Finally, the modules of\nthe UP have demonstrated some specificity regarding their\npsychological effects, although more research is needed to determine\nhow specifically UP modules impact their putative mechanisms of\naction.\n3.4.4. Bipolar disorder with comorbid anxiety disorder(s)\nOne RCT and one case series have been conducted in the United\nStates on the UP for bipolar disorder (Ellard et al., 2012; 2017). In the\nRCT, patients with bipolar I or II were randomized to either standard\nindividual UP with psychiatric TAU (n = 8) or psychiatric TAU alone\n(Ellard et al., 2017). In both studies, patients reported improvements insymptoms of depression and anxiety and, in the RCT, patients improved\nsignificantly compared to TAU.\n3.4.4.1. Summary. These results suggest the UP shows promise for the\ntreatment of bipolar disorder with comorbid anxiety disorder(s).\nHowever, while the UP appears to contribute to reductions in anxiety\nand depressive symptoms, its effects on manic symptoms are less\nrobust. Given the small sample sizes (n\nUP= 16), more research is\nneeded to draw stronger conclusions.\n3.4.5. Substance use disorders\nOne open trial of the UP for primary substance use disorder has been\nconducted at a health center specifically designed to service homeless\nindividuals and their families (Sauer-Zavala et al., 2019). The UP was\nmodified to focus on its five core modules, which providers could de-\nliver in any order. All patients (n = 6) were diagnosed with opioid use\ndisorder and MDD, with other diagnoses including stimulant use dis-order (cocaine, unspecified), sedative use disorder, GAD, and PTSD.\nPatients reported medium-to-large improvements in anxiety and small\nworsening of depressive symptoms. Additionally, among patients with\ncomorbid anxiety and alcohol use disorders in the United States, the UP\nwas provided with venlafaxine or placebo and compared to a relaxation\ncondition with venlafaxine or placebo. The UP+placebo group re-\nported a greater decrease in the percentage of heavy drinking days\ncompared to the relaxation+placebo group (Ciraulo et al., 2013).\n3.4.5.1. Summary. Across studies, these preliminary results (n\nUP= 51)\nsuggest some benefits of the UP for emotional conditions among those\nwith substance use disorders. However, more research in controlled\nsettings is needed to draw stronger, more generalizable conclusions\nabout these effects and any effects on substance use behaviors.\n3.4.6. Eating disorders\nTwo large-scale implementation studies (n UP= 409) have been\nconducted incorporating the UP into a residential eating disorders\ntreatment facility. The UP was modified in several ways to better match\nthis setting (e.g., designing modules to be delivered independently of\neach other; incorporating eating disorders examples; incorporating\nmore active patient exercises; Thompson-Brenner et al., 2018a).\nProviders also defined phases of treatment for patients (i.e., early,\nmiddle, late) with assessments to determine when patients would move\nbetween phases. An initial subset of patients demonstrated small-to-\nmedium sized pre- to post-treatment improvements in experientialC. Cassiello-Robbins, et al. Clinical Psychology Review 78 (2020) 101852\n7"

      "text": "avoidance, mindfulness, and anxiety sensitivity. The UP also led to\nmedium-sized improvement in eating disorder symptoms compared to\ntreatment provided before UP implementation (Thompson-Brenner\net al., 2018a). Among a larger sample of patients completing the UP at\nthis site, the UP led to greater pre- to post-treatment improvements in\nexperiential avoidance, mindfulness, and anxiety sensitivity but not\ndepressive or eating disorder symptoms than treatment implemented\nbefore the UP. However, at 6-month follow-up, the UP led to greater\npre- to post-treatment improvements in experiential avoidance and\ndepressive and eating disorder symptoms but not mindfulness or an-\nxiety sensitivity (Thompson-Brenner et al., 2018b).\n3.4.6.1. Summary. These results suggest the UP can be successfully\nmodified and implemented for the treatment of eating disorders in a\nresidential facility. While the UP appears to outperform treatment\nprovided prior to UP implementation, further research comparing the\nUP to other leading eating disorder treatments such as cognitive\nbehavior therapy-enhanced (CBT-E; Fairburn, 2008) is needed.\n3.4.7. Borderline personality disorder (BPD)\nFour SCEDs have been conducted testing the UP for BPD, with three\nof these studies occurring in the United States. In the most recent SCED,\nhalf the patients with BPD and comorbid disorders reported reliable\ndecreases in anxiety and depressive symptoms. One quarter of patients\nreported no change in anxiety and depressive symptoms, while one\nquarter reported an increase in these symptoms. Five patients no longer\nmet criteria for BPD at post-treatment (Lopez et al., 2019). Similarly, in\na second study, half the patients with BPD and comorbid disorders re-\nported lower BPD features during treatment than at baseline. Three\npatients reported no difference in BPD features between treatment and\nbaseline, and one patient reported elevated BPD features during treat-\nment compared to baseline. Five patients no longer met criteria for BPD\nat post-treatment (Lopez et al., 2015). In a third SCED, three of fivepatients with BPD and comorbid disorders reported large reductions in\nBPD features, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and emotion dysre-\ngulation. One patient reported little change in these measures, and one\npatient reported no change or a small increase in these measures\n(Sauer-Zavala, Bentley, & Wilner, 2016). Lastly, in a study in Iran, all\npatients with BPD and comorbid disorders reported some reductions in\nemotion dysregulation and BPD features from baseline to post-treat-\nment and follow-up (Mohammadi et al., 2018).\n3.4.7.1. Summary. Overall, these results (n\nUP= 27) suggest that the\nUP is shows promise for treating BPD features, emotion dysregulation,\nand comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression, with about half of\npatients in each study exhibiting improvements on these measures. Of\nnote, 12–25% of patients in each study also appear to deteriorate in the\nUP compared to baseline. Future research with larger samples and\nprognostic indicators of improvement and deterioration is warranted.\n3.4.8. Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI)\nTwo studies have been conducted on the UP for NSSI: a case study\nand a SCED study, both in the United States. In the case study, an 18-\nyear-old female patient with NSSI and social anxiety disorder com-\npleted 16 weeks of the UP (Bentley, 2017a). By the end of treatment,\nshe had refrained from any NSSI for 5 months, maintained low de-\npressive and anxiety symptoms, and reported reductions in, but clini-\ncally high levels of, GAD symptoms and social anxiety. In the SCED\nstudy, patients with NSSI and other emotional disorders engaged in two\nUP modules: Mindful Emotion Awareness and Cognitive Reappraisal\nand Flexibility (Bentley, Nock, Sauer-Zavala, Gorman, & Barlow,\n2017c). Mindful Emotion Awareness led to clinically meaningful re-\nductions in NSSI for 3 of 5 patients, while Cognitive Flexibility led toclinically meaningful reductions in NSSI for 2 of 5 patients. Four ofseven patients who completed exit interviews reported the cessation of\nNSSI since the start of the study.\n3.4.8.1. Summary. Together, these preliminary results suggest the UP,\nand specifically Mindful Emotion Awareness and Cognitive Flexibility\nmodules, may contribute to reductions in NSSI. Larger-scale trials are\nmuch needed in this area, as these conclusions are based on 11 patients.\nHowever, these results also emphasize the ability of individual UP\nmodules to lead to psychological improvements.\n3.4.9. Insomnia disorder\nTwo studies have been conducted on the UP for insomnia disorder: a\ncase study and a SCED study, both in Iran (Doos Ali Vand, Gharraee,\nAsgharnejad Farid, Ghaleh Bandi, & Habibi,\n2018a; Doos Ali Vand, Gharraee, Asgharnejad Farid, Ghaleh Bandi,\n& Habibi, 2018b). Both studies reported improvements in sleep-related\nvariables (e.g., onset latency, quality, beliefs) and the SCED study also\nindicated improvements in emotion dysregulation, anxiety sensitivity,\nand neuroticism.\n3.4.9.1. Summary. The results of these studies (n\nUP= 7) provide\npreliminary evidence the UP can be modified to include content\nrelated to sleep quality and that the delivery of such a modified\nprotocol can lead to improvements in sleep and emotional outcomes.\nFurther research is necessary for this population in order to draw\nstronger conclusions about these effects.\n3.4.10. Subclinical symptoms\nAll applications of the UP to subclinical populations have involved\nUP groups with some modifications to the standard protocol. One RCT\ncompared a UP group to a transdiagnostic cognitive therapy group\nbased on Beck's model of emotional disorders, two RCTs compared a UPgroup to waitlist control, and one open trial of a UP group has been\nconducted. In Iran, patients with depression and anxiety symptoms\nwere randomized to eight sessions of either UP or transdiagnostic\ncognitive therapy (Mohammadi, Birashk, & Gharaie, 2013). The UP led\nto greater decreases in anxiety than cognitive therapy and similar im-\nprovements in depression, stress, and work/social adjustment. In the\nUnited States, Bentley et al. (2017b) randomized undergraduate uni-\nversity students with elevated, but not clinical levels of, anxiety or\ndepressive symptoms to engage in a 2-h workshop teaching five core UP\nprinciples (n = 45) or an assessment-only control condition. Students\nreported some improvements in neuroticism, quality of life, and ex-periential avoidance that were not significantly different from the as-\nsessment-only group. Participants rated the workshop as highly ac-\nceptable and satisfying. In Iran, female patients with subclinical\nparanoia were randomized to 10 sessions of either UP or waitlist control\n(Amirpour et al., 2018). The UP led to greater improvements in the\nintensity of paranoid thoughts and work/social adjustment than wait-\nlist. In Canada, patients with “clinically significant” symptoms (de-\ntermined by a psychiatric consultation) of social anxiety disorder, GAD,\nor panic disorder with/without agoraphobia received the UP modified\nto include exposure sessions earlier in treatment and to explicitly in-\nclude imaginal exposures. Patients reported medium-to-large im-\nprovements in anxiety, depressive, and panic disorder symptoms,\nworry, and positive and negative affect. They reported small-to-medium\nimprovements in social anxiety symptoms (Laposa et al., 2017).\n3.4.10.1. Summary. Overall, these results (k = 4; n\nUP= 97) provide\npreliminary support for the efficacy of UP groups for subclinical\nanxiety, depression, and paranoia. UP groups appear acceptable to\nthis population and may produce greater changes in anxiety symptomsC. Cassiello-Robbins, et al. Clinical Psychology Review 78 (2020) 101852\n8"

Physical health and neurological complaints\nThe UP has been applied to a range of physical health complaints\nincluding irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic pain, psychosomatic\ncomplaints, infertility, and Parkinson's disease.\n3.4.11.1. Irritable bowel syndrome. One RCT and one open trial of the\nUP have been conducted for patients with IBS, both in Iran (Johari-Fard\n& Ghafourpour, 2015; Mohsenabadi, Zanjani, Shabani, & Arj, 2018).\nBoth studies reported decreases in IBS symptoms and improvements inquality of life. Additionally, the RCT indicated UP treatment was\nassociated with greater improvement in IBS, depression, and anxiety\nsymptoms, stress, frequency of cognitive reappraisal, and greater\nreductions in the frequency of expressive suppression compared to\nwaitlist. Together, these findings (n\nUP= 47) suggest the UP may be\nefficacious at reducing both IBS and emotional symptoms, althoughmore research is needed to generalize these results.\n3.4.11.2. Chronic pain. Two SCED studies using a guided internet-\ndelivered version of the UP have been conducted for patients with\nchronic pain and emotional disorders, both in Sweden (Lorenz &\nStranberg 2015; Wurm et al., 2017). Overall, the results of these\nstudies (n\nUP= 14) suggested an internet-delivered version of the UP\nmay not be efficacious for treating chronic pain and that the UP maynot reliably lead to improved depressive or anxiety symptoms in this\npopulation. The preliminary conclusions are based on only two studies\nand more research is needed to confirm or refute this observation.\n3.4.11.3. Psychosomatic complaints. With regard to psychosomatic\ncomplaints, an open trial of group UP (n\nUP= 20) for psychosomatic\ncomplaints (related to digestion and skin) in Iran, yielded significantimprovements in all areas of emotion dysregulation except impulsivity\nand acting with awareness, putting things into perspective, and\ncatastrophizing (Mazaheri et al., 2013). These results suggest the UP\nis a promising treatment for emotional aspects of psychosomatic\ncomplaints, although it is unclear from this study the degree to which\nthe UP addresses psychosomatic complaints directly. Additional\nresearch can shed light on the extent to which the UP improves\npsychosomatic complaints and support the ability of this treatment to\ntarget the emotional aspects of this condition.\n3.4.11.4. Infertility. One RCT in Iran examined the effects of the UP\ncompared to 8 sessions of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR),\nor waitlist (n\nUP= 15; Mousavi et al., 2019) as treatment for patients\nwith infertility. Patients reported greater decreases in anxiety anddepressive symptoms in both the UP and MBSR conditions. However, it\nis unclear from the reported results if there were any significant\ndifferences between the UP and MBSR on these outcomes. These\npreliminary results suggest the UP delivered in a group format may\nbe similarly effective in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms\namong women with infertility and elevated emotional symptoms;\nhowever, more research is needed to replicate and confirm these\nfindings.\n3.4.11.5. Parkinson'sdisease. Finally, a SCED study in the United States\napplied 12 sessions of the UP (either in person or through\nvideoconference) to patients with mild to moderate idiopathic\nParkinson's Disease and a comorbid anxiety disorder (n\nUP= 9). An\noptional information session for family members was offered at mid-treatment. Overall, these preliminary results indicated improvement inanxiety and depressive symptoms compared to baseline (Reynolds,\nSaint-Hilaire, Thomas, Barlow, & Cronin-Golomb, 2019) and additional\nresearch is needed to further support the utility of the UP in addressing\nemotional symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease.\n3.4.11.6. Summary. Across these physical health and neurological\ncomplaints, the UP appears relatively efficacious at reducing anxiety\nand depressive symptoms (k = 7). The UP may also be efficacious at\nreducing IBS symptoms. Additionally, the UP may be as effective as\nMBSR for treating these symptoms among those with infertility.\nHowever, these results do not support the conclusion that the UP is\nefficacious at addressing chronic pain conditions. These studies\nexploring the efficacy of the UP for treating emotional sequelae\nassociated with physical health and neurological complaints are\npreliminary in nature and more research is needed to replicate,\nconfirm, and further clarify their results.\n3.4.12. Sexual minority stress\nThe UP has been applied to gay and bisexual men in two studies, an\nopen trial and an RCT, in the United States. In the open trial and RCT,\npatients engaged in 10 individual sessions of a version of ESTEEM, a\nmodification of the UP designed to address the effects of sexual min-\nority stress on HIV-related stressors, sexual compulsivity, substance use,\nand HIV transmission risk behaviors (Pachankis, Hatzenbuehler,\nRendina, Safren, & Parsons, 2015; Parsons et al., 2017).\n3.4.12.1. Summary. Together, the results of these studies (n\nUP= 43)\nsuggested the UP can be effectively modified to treat aspects of sexualminority stress and contribute to more frequent safe sex behaviors.\nESTEEM may also impact patients' depressive and anxiety symptoms\namong those who are relatively elevated on these symptoms at the start\nof treatment. Given all patients in these trials were men, future\nresearchers may extend these findings to a broader range of sexual\norientations and gender identities.\n4. Discussion\nThe purpose of this systematic literature review was to examine the\nways in which the Unified Protocol (UP) has been studied in treatment\nresearch across adult patient populations and modified in different\nsettings. While the UP is designed to treat the full range of emotional\ndisorders (i.e., disorders characterized by aversive responses to emo-\ntions and avoidance-based emotion regulation strategies), no re-\nsearchers to date have systematically examined the empirical evidence\nfor this claim. Indeed, preliminary data from clinician reports suggest a\nprimary hesitation to implementing the UP in their practice is the\nperceived inability to tailor the treatment to varying patient presenta-\ntions (Cassiello-Robbins, Ametaj, Boettcher, Conklin, & Sauer-Zavala,\n2015). The studies reviewed here demonstrate the UP has been applied\nto the full range of emotional disorders (anxiety, mood, eating, in-\nsomnia, bipolar, obsessive-compulsive, traumatic and stressor-related),\ntypically with efficacious outcomes (i.e., symptom reduction and re-\nduced avoidance). The strongest base of evidence appears to be for the\nefficacy of the UP in anxiety-related and depressive disorders. Ad-\nditionally, while fewer studies utilized the UP for patients with eating\ndisorders, these studies recruited relatively large samples, providing\nstronger evidence for the use of the UP with this patient population as\nwell. Smaller studies provided more preliminary support for using the\nUP with other emotional disorders.\nTwo studies tested the effects of the UP on substance use. TheC. Cassiello-Robbins, et al.

      "text": "characterization of substance use disorders as emotional disorder is\nunclear. While aspects of substance use disorder presentations often fit\nthe model of emotional disorders (e.g., substance use to provide relief\nfrom uncomfortable emotions), other presentations do not (e.g., sub-\nstance use to enhance positive affect; McHugh & Goodman, 2019). In\nthis review, studies that reported on substance-use outcomes showedmixed findings, with one indicating a reduction in heavy drinking days\n(Ciraulo et al., 2013) and the other noting a non-significant reduction in\nclub drug use (Parsons et al., 2017). Such results support McHugh and\nGoodman's (2019) observations that the heterogeneity of presentations\nin this class of disorders might require different treatment strategies.\nWhile the UP may be one such treatment, other treatments should be\nexplored as well.\nFurther, results from this review indicated the UP has been applied\nto patients who either did not meet the diagnostic threshold for a dis-\norder (e.g., subclinical anxiety, depression, paranoia) or presented with\nproblems not currently defined as diagnoses in DSM-5 (e.g., NSSI,\ndysregulated anger, compulsive sexual behavior). Results suggested the\nUP predominantly led to desired outcomes for these patients. The\nability of the UP to target these problems is a strength of the treatment.\nSince it is not confined to a single diagnosis and its associated symp-\ntoms, the UP framework is able to parsimoniously address a variety of\npresenting concerns. This being said, the evidence supporting the ap-\nplication of the UP to these presentations and disorders remains pre-\nliminary as there were only a few studies for a given presentation and\nmany were open trials, case studies, or SCEDs consisting of relatively\nsmall samples. These studies thus require replication to confirm the\ngeneralizability of their results. One direction for future research with\nthe UP will be to continue evaluating its efficacy for patient presenta-\ntions beyond those with anxiety-related, depressive, and eating dis-\norders. Further, given the preliminary nature of many studies reviewed,\ntrials comparing the UP to other active psychosocial treatments for\nthese conditions are also needed.\nAdditionally, results suggested the UP has predominantly been\ntested among patients who identify as female and Caucasian. This focus\non female patients is not surprising as many emotional disorders (e.g.,\ndepression, anxiety-related, borderline personality, eating disorders)\nare more common in female populations (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, &\nWalters, 2005), and data suggest women seek treatment at higher rates\nthan men (Möller-Leimkühler, 2002). Similarly, at least in the United\nStates where the majority of the studies reviewed were conducted,\nCaucasian individuals typically receive mental health treatment at\nhigher rates than other racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Shao, Richie, &\nBailey, 2016), which may help explain why the majority of studiesreviewed treated samples that were primarily Caucasian. Another di-\nrection for future research is to continue evaluating the UP in more\ndiverse samples. Interestingly, some studies specifically provided the\nUP to patients from marginalized communities (e.g., gay and bisexual\npatients, patients with HIV). In these studies, however, the UP was\nadapted to focus on minority stress experiences. Research as to whether\ntreatments need to be modified for minority populations remains mixed\n(Carter, Mitchell, & Sbrocco, 2012; Horrell, 2008). While no study re-\nviewed here suggested differential outcomes or attrition based ongender, race, or ethnicity, it should be noted that none of these studies\nexplicitly reported tests of this hypothesis. Whether an unmodified\nversion of the UP is acceptable and effective for patients who identify as\nminorities (i.e., non-white, non-heterosexual) is an area for future re-\nsearch. Focus groups and assessment specifically of the acceptability of\nthe UP with minority patients may be very valuable.\nRelatedly, the literature reviewed here noted a number of cultural\nadaptions for use of the UP outside the United States. An important\nlimitation when considering these results is that this review onlyexamined studies published in English. It is possible that more studies\ndescribing the implementation of the UP are available in other lan-\nguages and were not reviewed here. Overall, results of the English-\nlanguage studies indicated these adaptations were generally efficacious\nregarding symptom reduction. However, these studies were mostly\npreliminary in nature and further research will be needed to confirm\nthe utility of these cultural adaptions as well as the effectiveness of the\nUP in additional countries. For example, the majority of the non-US\ncountries examined were first world countries. Whether the UP is useful\nin developing countries or countries characterized by high levels of\npoverty, as well as what modifications to the treatment might be\nneeded to make it accessible in such counties, remains to be seen.\nStudies integrating the UP with the Common Elements Treatment\nApproach (CETA; Murray et al., 2014), a transdiagnostic treatment\noften specifically implemented in developing countries, may be espe-cially useful for such questions.\nAn additional goal of this review was to examine modifications\nmade to the UP. Some amount of flexibility has been incorporated as a\nnoted strength in the UP from the start (e.g., tailoring the length of a\ngiven module to the needs of the patient; Sauer-Zavala et al., 2019). The\nliterature reviewed here suggests the modifications being made to thetreatment in research studies extends beyond the amount of time spent\non specific treatment skills. The alterations made to the UP across\nstudies were quite heterogeneous and included translation into another\nlanguage, adding relevant examples, incorporating elements of other\ntreatments (e.g., behavioral activation) or theories (e.g., minority stress\nmodel), and adaptations to unique treatment settings (e.g., residential\ntreatment centers, hospitals, community mental health centers). An-\nother notable adaption was the use of the UP as a group treatment. The\ncurrent manual predominantly provides direction for delivering the UP\nas an individual treatment, although there is some information about\ngroup delivery as well. However, providers may be able to reach more\npatients delivering the UP in a group format. Indeed, in some countriesa group intervention is the first line of treatment offered. The fact that\ngroup treatments consistently led to reductions in anxiety and depres-\nsive symptoms in the studies reviewed here suggests the UP can be\nsuccessfully adapted to this modality.\nWhen and how the UP should be adapted is a question of interest.\nAlthough some adaptations are clearly necessary (e.g., translation to a\nnative language), adaptations that incorporate other treatment ele-\nments, reorder or omit skills, or make large structural changes to the\ntreatment (i.e., division into phases) pose particularly complex ques-\ntions regarding the “core” ingredients, active mechanisms, and/or\n“spirit” of the UP. For instance, at a content level, modifications to the\nUP that include other treatment elements should be tested against\nstandard UP (e.g., Cooney Roxbury, 2017) to characterize the unique\neffect of added elements above and beyond standard UP. Second, at a\nstructural and delivery level, modifications such as the ordering of UP\nmodules based on baseline characteristics (Sauer-Zavala et al., 2019) or\nshared decision-making with the patient (Joosten et al., 2008) should\nbe systematically tested to determine best practices for treatment per-\nsonalization and optimization. Given that patients in community clinics\nattend fewer than five sessions, on average (Hansen, Lambert, &\nForman, 2002; Wolitzky-Taylor, Zimmerman, Arch, De Guzman, &\nLagoasino, 2015), it is important to prioritize the most useful skills forpatients to improve the chances they receive maximum benefit from the\nsessions they do attend. However, these changes represent a deviation\nfrom the manual as written. Adaptations that involve reordering\ntreatment skills will likely need to demonstrate more rapid (e.g., Weisz\net al., 2012) or durable improvements in symptoms to be considered anevidence-based alternative to the standard treatment manual. Further,\nthe UP manual describes the early modules as “foundational” andC. Cassiello-Robbins, et al. Clinical Psychology Review 78 (2020) 101852\n10"

      "text": "evidence supporting the acceptability of delivering this content at a\ndifferent point in treatment would also be needed. Indeed, Sauer-Zavala\net al. (2019) noted that 33% of patients in a SCED study that involved\nre-ordering modules indicated they would prefer to receive psychoe-\nducation first. Thus, more research is needed to identify any modules\nthat should always be delivered at certain points in treatment and to\ndescribe how to best order modules to improve patient outcomes. Fi-\nnally, at the level of dissemination and implementation, our review\nsuggests the UP needs to be adapted to the needs of a setting in order to\nbe implemented successfully. The studies reviewed here provide ex-\namples of barriers and facilitators to implementing the UP in a new\ninstitution. The relatively few examples described in the literature\nhighlight the need for more systematic tests and descriptions of such\nresearch.\nAdapting the UP in these ways raises the question of when the UP\nstops being the UP. This is a question that is currently unanswered as\nthere are no clear guidelines delineating when the treatment can no\nlonger be called the UP. A number of suggestions could be considered:\nfor example, a treatment that utilizes the UP framework and case\nconceptualization may be considered the UP. Alternatively, a treatment\ncould be called the UP if it uses all eight modules, regardless of the\norder in which they are delivered. However, these suggestions are not\nbased on empirical evidence. One possible direction for future research\nis to conduct dismantling studies to identify which elements are crucial\nto success of the UP. Such research would lend insight into the active\nmechanisms involved in the UP and could be used to more clearly\ndistinguish UP and UP-based treatments (i.e., those that include these\ncrucial elements) from non-UP treatments (i.e., those that omit these\ncrucial elements).\nOne potential risk in adapting the UP in multiple ways is that doing\nso will reduplicate the problem of single-disorder protocols (SDPs) by\ncreating multiple domain-specific UP adaptations. A primary appeal of\nthe UP, and other transdiagnostic treatments such as process-based CBT(Hofmann & Hayes, 2019), is that it is a single treatment applicable to\nmany clinical presentations. This approach has the benefit of reducing\ntraining burden because trainees can learn one treatment that is likely\nto benefit heterogeneous patients on their caseload. Modifying the UP\nfor specific patient presentations or adding elements from other treat-\nments to it could potentially proliferate into multiple UPs that are es-\nsentially SDPs. Therefore, modifications to the UP need to be carefully\nconsidered. As previously mentioned, research justifying the need for\nmodified versions of the UP by demonstrating their relative superiority\nto standard delivery can provide insight into the necessity and utility of\nproposed modifications.\nThe results reported and considerations raised here should be\nviewed in the context of the study's limitations. First, the heterogeneity\nof modifications to the UP makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions\nabout their efficacy or to systematically evaluate each type of mod-\nification. Second, the outcomes assessed differed widely across studies.\nEven studies assessing similar outcomes (e.g., anxiety symptoms) used\ndifferent measures. Because of the heterogeneity in these outcome\nmeasures, meta-analytic statistics could not be computed. Therefore,\neffect sizes describing the magnitude of the effects of the UP for various\npresenting problems are not available. A recent meta-analysis provides\neffect sizes for some measures (e.g., anxiety, depression, positive affect,\nnegative affect, emotion regulation functional impairment, quality of\nlife;Sakiris & Berle, 2019). However, other outcomes such as those\nrelated to insomnia, eating disorder symptoms, NSSI, etc., were not\nincluded in that meta-analysis. Third, the majority of studies did not\nprovide data regarding treatment adherence or therapist training pro-\ncedures, making it difficult to assess the quality of the included studies.\nFuture treatment studies would benefit from including this information.\nFourth, this study only examined the UP as applied to adults. Adoles-\ncent and child versions of the UP are published (Ehrenreich-May et al.,2018) and future researchers may systematically evaluate those as well.\nFifth, our search was limited to English-language articles reporting on\nthe UP or its adaptations. This search limitation may have led to biased\nconclusions regarding the cross-cultural efficacy of the UP. Sixth, when\nconducting a systematic review, the “file drawer problem” is always of\nconcern. That is, it is not possible to know how many studies were\nconducted but not reported (Rosenthal, 1979). Therefore, it is possible\nstudies with conflicting results that would change the interpretations\noffered here exist, but have not been published. Finally, it is possible\nthe studies reviewed here engaged in flexible practices with regard to\ndata collection, analysis, and reporting that could have artificially im-\nproved their chances of finding significant results (Simmons, Nelson, &\nSimonsohn, 2011). Such practices would also artificially strengthen the\nconclusions drawn in this study.\nDespite these limitations, the results of this review have clinical\nimplications. The studies reviewed indicated the UP is generally effi-\ncacious across diagnostic presentations, global borders, and healthcare\nsettings. While the strongest base of evidence for the UP is among\nCaucasian females in the United States with anxiety-related or depres-\nsive disorders, many preliminary studies point to benefits of the UP\nbeyond this population. This observation suggests the UP can be an\neffective treatment for a wide range of patient presentations, making it\na potentially efficient and disseminable treatment. Additionally, this\ntreatment might be positively perceived by patients who would find a\nconsistent approach to understanding their symptoms (across diag-\nnostic categories) easier to understand. While many results were pre-\nliminary and require further replication, the breadth of presenting\nproblems treated successfully (i.e., leading to symptom reduction), as\nwell as the numerous ways in which the UP was adapted and still\nproduced favorable outcomes for patients, suggests it can be a flexibly\napplied tool in many clinical settings. Given the high demands often\nplaced on clinicians to provide evidence-based treatment to a hetero-\ngeneous caseload, the UP could be a helpful treatment in which to trainclinicians to reduce training burden. Training clinicians in one protocol\nthat can be used for a range of diagnostic presentations may be helpful\nin making evidence-based treatments more appealing and practical\nwhile still allowing the flexibility that data suggest therapists prefer,\nthereby reducing the science to practice gap.\nOverall, this systematic review is meant to synthesize and con-\nsolidate the broad literature on the UP since its publication in 2010. The\nresults presented here are promising and more research focused on\ndissemination and implementation of this protocol will further advance\nour knowledge of its utility in a wide range of clinical settings.\nRole of funding sources\nNo funding sources supported this work.\nContributors\nThe first three authors participated in data extraction.
