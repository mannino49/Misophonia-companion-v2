      "text": "Misophonia is a disorder characterized by negative physiological or emotional reactions in response to particular \nsounds that do  not cause annoyance  [1] Schröder et al.  [2] proposed diagnostic criteria for misophonia, including \nextreme behavioral or physiological response to the presence or anticipation of certain sounds, anger, loss of self -\ncontrol, and avoidance of misophonic sound situations. In other words , misophonia is  hatred or decreased \ntolerance to particular  sounds that may be normal for others. The reactions to the sound depend on the physical \nproperties of the sound and the environment in which it is presented.  Triggering sounds could be chewing , metal \nscraping, h igh-frequency insect chirping,  etc. [2-5]. The reactions to triggering sounds could be anger, irritation, \nincreased heart rate, sweating, anxiety , etc. Neuroimaging studies  show ed cortical generators involved in \nmisophonia generation. H yperactivation of the right insula, right anterior angulate cortex , and right superior \ntemporal cortex was seen when misophonic individuals were exposed to triggering audiovisual input compared \nto neutral video clips  [6, 7] In addition , Aryal and Prabhu [8] proposed a neuro biological model of Misophonia \ngeneration, where they hint at the central auditory involvement in addition to the other cortical areas  (such as \nthose involved in emotion or psychological distress) . \nCentral Auditory Processing (CAP) is the ability to perceptually receive stimuli within the Central Auditory \nNervous System  (CANS) and conduct the subsequent neurobiological activities that give rise to the \nelectrophysiological auditory action potentials  [9]. Auditory  processing incl udes temporal processing, binaural \ninteraction, fusion, integration,  separation , and auditory closure. Binaural integration is when  the patient has to \nrepeat stimuli in both ears  [9]. Difficulties faced by individuals with binaural integration deficits include having \ntrouble taking notes, processing more than one modality concurrently , or listening to two persons simultaneously.  \nBinaural interaction refers to the task where the CANS interprets  stimuli presented simultaneously to both ears  \n[10]. This proc ess occurs at the brainstem level, where information from both ears is  processed.  \nConventionally , binaural interaction is assessed through Masking Level Difference  (MLD) , while binaural \nintegration abilities are measured using the Dichotic Consonant Vowel (DCV) test [11]. MLD  describes how the \nphase of either the signal or the noise at the two ears can be changed to improve the perception of a signal when \na masker is present  [12]. ‘o’ indicates when the signal is in phase and ‘ π’ indicates when signal is ou t of phase. \nSoNo is a homophasic condition where signal and noise are in phase and S πNo and SoN π are antiphasic \nconditions where one of the signals is out of phase. In the case of SπNo, the signal is out of phase, and in SoN π, \nthe noise is out of phase.  SπNo and SoN π are easier to detect compared to SoNo , which shows that antiphasic \nconditions are easier to detect compared to homophasic condition.  When the signal and noise are in phase, the \nauditory image is perceived at the central location of the head . The signal or noise phase shift  leads to a separation \nbetween them , which  facilitates easy detection. Conversely, the DCV test assesse s the binaural integration ability \nand is more complex  than other  dichotic speech tests . The stimuli used in DCV are pairs of pa, ta, ka, ba, da, ga. \nTwo distinct CVs are presented simultaneously to both ears and the subject has to repeat. Right single correct \nscore, left single correct score, and double correct score are calculated.  DCV test  is sensitive to cortical lesions . \nHowever , its ability to detect cortical lesions' lateralization (right or left cortical regions)  is limited.  \nThe evaluation of the CANS  in individuals with misophonia is still unexplored . Out of the explored processes , \nIlaa et al ., studied temporal auditory processing in individuals with misophonia using gap-in-noise, duration \npattern, and frequency pattern tests  [13]. The results of their study showed no group differences. To the authors' \nknowledge , no study has yet explo red the binaural interaction and integration in misophonics. However , literature \nevidence on the binaural deficits in the tinnitus individuals is available.  It has been reported that binaural \nprocessing and working memory ability are affected in individuals with tinnitus  [14]. The pathway involved in \ntinnitus and misophonia is similar  [8, 15]. There is abnormal activation of the non -classical auditory pathway  in \nboth conditions.  The trigger is perceived in the peripheral auditory system , which is then connected to the \nsubcortical and cortical auditory cent ers. Whereas in tinnitus , the trigger is substituted with an external source \nand the rest of the path foll ows the same as tinnitus. There have been studies where the authors have reported \nbinaural interaction deficits in individuals with tinnitus  [16]. Another study on tinnitus individuals showed \nabnormal results on central auditory speech tests , including  pass filtered speech test, staggered spondaic word \ntest, binaural fusion test, and competing sentence test  [17]. According to neuroaudiological model, misophonia \nand tinnitus have similar pathophysiology so one can expect similar findings in misophonia . There is research \nevidence that shows abnormal results in auditory objective tests such as significant differences in P1 and N1 \nlatency peaks in late latency response test which indicates deficit in cortical auditory processing and reduced N1 \namplitude in mismatch negativity test [18, 19]. Also , Pellicori reported misophonia individuals may experience \ncentral auditory processing deficit since they are hyper  focused  and more concerned about the background noises \nsuch as chewing, drinking sounds unlike the individuals without CAPD who can easily tune out background noise \nand pay attention to signal  [20]. This study aimed  to check for any  difference in binaural integration and binaural \ninteraction between normal -hearing individuals with and without misophonia ."

      "text": "Methods  \nA cross -sectional study of university students with misophonia was carried out. All the participants in the study \nwere inf ormed about the procedure, and informed consent was taken. A total of 60 normal hearing subjects in the \nage range of 18 -30 years participated in the study. Participants were divided into two groups: Experimental (n=30, \n1 male and 29 females, age mean=22.03 , SD=2.97 years) who had the diagnosis of misophonia and control (n=30, \n12 males and 18 females, age mean=22.4; SD=2.28) who did not exhibit misophonia symptoms. Participants in \nboth groups had normal hearing sensitivity, which was confirmed through pure t one audiometry, where all \nparticipants had pure tone averages (500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 4000 Hz) of less than 15 dB [21]. A calibrated \naudiometer was used for the same, and the procedure followed was a modified version of the Hughson -Westlake \nprocedur e [21]. Also, a calibrated tympanometer (GSI Tympstar V 2.0) confirmed normal middle ear functioning \nwith a probe tone of 226 Hz. All the participants had either 'A' or 'As' type tympanogram and acoustic reflex was \npresent within normal range at 500 Hz, 10 00 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 4000 Hz ipsilaterally and contralaterally. \nParticipants with a history of otological complaints, noise exposure, ototoxic medications, tinnitus, hyperacusis, \ndiabetes, or hypertension were excluded from the study. Hyperacusis was ruled out by measuring loudness \ndiscomfort level at frequencies between 250 Hz to 8000 Hz and for speech and it was found to be greater than 90 \ndB. \nSchröder et al.’s diagnostic criteria for misophonia were used to confirm the misophonia diagnosis. The criteria \ninclude the presence or anticipation of specific sound that provokes an impulsive aversive physical reaction which \nstarts with irritation or disgust that instantaneously becomes anger, the anger initiates a sense of loss of self -\ncontrol with potential aggre ssive outbursts, and the individual tends to avoid the misophonic situation if not \nendures the situation with discomfort or anger, whether the anger, disgust cause significant distress and all these \ncriteria should not be better explained by another disord er [2]. The Misophonia Assessment Questionnaire (MAQ) \n[22] was administered to assess the severity of misophonia. MAQ consists of 21 items evaluated from 0 to 3 \npoints depending on how frequently the issue applies (0=not at all, 1=occasionally, 2=often, an d 3=nearly \nalways). Using the total score, misophonia severity is determined. Scores ranging from 0 –11 were subclinical, \n12–24 mild, 25 –37 moderate, 38 –50 severe, or 51 –63 ex treme. A Google form link was shared with all the \nparticipants, through which eac h response was recorded. Only participants with definite misophonia diagnoses \n(mild and moderate) were considered in this study. The participant's characteristics in both groups are shown in \nTable 1.  \nDCV test material by Yathiraj (1999) was administered through a Windows media player with a calibrated \nsupraural headphone  [23]. The test is administered in a sound -treated room. The test stimuli include /pa/, /ta/, \n/ka/, /ba/, /da/, /ga/. It involves the presentation of different CV pairs with a time lag of 0 ms to both ears \nsimultaneously. A free recall task was carried out in which the participants were required to attend and report \nboth syllables presented. Right single score, left single score , and dou ble correct scores were calculated for each \nparticipant.  A schematic diagram for the following is shown in Figure 1 . \nMLD was administered through a calibrated audiometer  in a sound -treated room . It was done at 500 Hz with a \npulse mode of 2.5 Hz , and the presentation level was kept at 50 dB HL. Three conditions of MLD , SoNo,  SπNo, \nand SoN π, were tested . 'π' represents when source is out of phase and 'o' represents when the source is in phase.  \nThe participants were instructed to indicate when they heard the pulsed tone , and the thresholds were noted. A \nschematic diagram for the following is shown in Figure 2.  \n \nStatistical analys es \nThe IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 ( IBM SPSS Corp.; Armonk, NY, USA ) \nwas used to analyse  the gathered data. The Shapiro -Wilk normality test was used to determine whether the data \ndistribution  was normal. To assess whether there were any significant differences between the control and \nexperimental groups, inferential statistics were use d. Independent t -tests were conducted on parametric data , and \nMann -Whitney U -tests on non -parametric data.  \n \nResults  \n \nComparison of binaural integration abilities between the two groups  \nShapiro Wilk 's test showed that DCV data were normally distributed . The  results of  the independent t -test showed \nt(58)=0.77, p>0.05  for double correct score, t(58)=0.27, p>0.05  for right single correct score, t(58)=0.37, p>0.05 \nfor left single correct score. This indicated no statistically significant difference between misop honia and the \ncontrol group for all three conditions. The mean and standard deviation for both groups are shown in Figure 3."

      "text": "Comparison of bina ural interaction  abilities between the two groups  \nShapiro Wilk 's test found that the data were not normal. Hence , a suitable non -parametric test was chosen. Mann \nWhitney U test was administered , and the results showed /Z/=1.08, p>0.05. This revealed no statistically \nsignificant difference bet ween misophonia and the control group. The mean and standard deviation for both \ngroups are shown in Figure 4. \nFor each group, right and left single  correct scores were compared. Dependent t -test was administered and it \nshowed that f or the control group, t( 29)=0.71,  p>0.05 and for misophonia , it was found to be t(29)=0.9, p>0.05.  \nThis revealed no statistically significant difference between the ears in both groups.  \n \nDiscussion  \nThe study's outcome showed no significant differences in the M LD test and DCV test, which implies that binaural \ninteraction and binaural integration are unaffected. This study considered  only 30 misophonia participants with \nmild and moderate severity . Hence , this evidence demonstrates that individuals with these severities normally \nprocess binaural interaction and integration . Future research can include a larger pool of participants and a higher \ndegree of misophonia severity. It is also essential to consider that the tests were conducted in an ideal situation \noptimum for listening  in a quiet environment. These tests could be administered in adverse listening conditions , \nsuch as lower signal -to-noise  ratios , in the presence of different types of noise , which would be more challenging \nto the participants . \nStudies on misophonia have revealed no peripheral impairments  [3, 24]. fMRI research showed hyperactivation \nof the right insula, right anterior cingulate cortex, right superior temporal cortex , and anterior insular cortex  [7, \n25]. Additionally, misophonia individuals have stronger mirroring neurons than the control group, and these \nneurons are more sensitive to trigger noises  [26]. This evidence  indicate s abnormalities at the cortical level in \nmisophonia , but the present study shows no abnormalities in binaural integration  and inter action behaviorally . \nEven though tinnitus and misophonia share a common pathophysiology, auditory processing is affected \ndifferently. In a study by Sanjay et al.  it was found that interaural level difference, interaural time difference, and \nDCV test scores are poorer in the tinnitus group assessing binaural interaction and binaural integration [14]. In \ntinnitus individuals, habituation is affected compared to the control group, shown by N1 -P2 amplitude being less \npronounced [27]. Another research that studied binaural processing in tinnitus individuals through Auditory \nBrainstem Response (ABR) reported that in both monaural and binaural recording, wave I, III, and V had delayed \nlatencies, and wave I and III amplitudes were reduced [16]. Also, when they compared Binaural Interaction \nComponent )BIC(  between both groups, they observed earlier BIC latency for wave I and V in the control group, \nwhereas, with respect to amplitude, they did not find any significant differences. Another ABR study that \nevaluated tinnitus based on occasional and constant tinnitus demonstrated that constant tinnitus individuals had \ndelayed wave V latency compared to occasional tinnitus individ uals and the control group [28]. Joo et al. studied \nthe effect of tinnitus duration on ABR and reported that individuals with subacute tinnitus duration (1 –6 months) \nhad reduced wave V amplitude and delayed wave V latency compared to individuals with acute  tinnitus duration \n(<1 month) [29]. Also, they reported prolonged interpeak latency I -V during the subacute phase compared to the \nacute and chronic phases (>6 months). This indicated that after one month of symptoms, the compensatory \nreaction to tinnitus s ignificantly reduced. Other ABR studies on tinnitus reported reduced amplitude of wave I \nand V, prolonged wave I, prolonged interpeak latency I -V, and increased interaural latency difference of wave V \n[30, 31]. A literature review of salicylate and noise -induced tinnitus on rat models showed reduced amplitude of \nwave I in both conditions whereas, increased amplitude of wave IV was observed in salicylate -induced tinnitus \nbut not in noise -induced tinnitus [32]. The superior olivary complex is an essential str ucture in binaural processing \nand auditory brainstem responses, and all the abnormal findings in ABR can be attributed to the effect of binaural \nprocessing. Aryal and Prabhu reported no abnormal ABR findings in individuals with misophonia, supporting \nthe findings obtained in the present study [33]. In most tinnitus complainers, tinnitus experienced is a continuous \nphenomenon, whereas misophonia gets triggered intermittently. This might be one of the reasons why binaural \nprocessing is affected differently in  these groups. There are neurophysiological evidences such as reduced N1 \namplitude in mismatch negativity, and significant differences in P1 and N1 latency which indicates differences \nin central auditory processing compared to the control group [18, 19] Al so, according to Pellicori, those with \nmisophonia may have a central auditory processing deficit because they are more focused and aware of the \nbackground noises compared to individuals without CAPD who can easily filter out background noises [20]. The \ntests used in this study were simple and the severe misophonia group was not considered. Hence, more \ncomplicated tests and on severe misophonia can shed more light on this condition.

The above -\nmentioned processes  were investigated using masking level difference and dichotic consonant  vowel , \nrespectively. The results showed that there are no significant differences between individuals with and without \nmisophonia.
