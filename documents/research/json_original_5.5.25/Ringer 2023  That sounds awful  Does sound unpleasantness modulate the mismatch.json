This supports the claim of preat-\ntentive emotion evaluation during early auditory processing.

      "text": "2 of 16 |   \nRINGER et al.\n1 | INTRODUCTION\nHuman experience and behavior are inextricably linked \nto emotions. Emotions are widely assumed to govern \nthe preparation of appropriate behavioral reactions \nin a given situation, thus rendering fast and effective \nemotional evaluation evolutionarily adaptive (Bradley \n& Lang,  2002). Across sensory modalities, emotional \nstimuli have been found to evoke a variety of charac-\nteristic responses, including physiological reactions, \nbehaviors, and feelings (Bradley & Lang,  2002). In the \nauditory domain, unpleasant sounds (such as scraping \nsounds, animal cries, or angry voices) are known to \nelicit an enlarged startle reflex, increased skin conduc-\ntance, enhanced heart rate deceleration, and stronger \nmuscle activity (Bradley & Lang,  2000). Furthermore, \nunpleasant sounds are recalled more readily compared \nto neutral or pleasant sounds (Bradley & Lang,  2000). \nAmong unpleasant auditory experiences, certain sounds \nare perceived as particularly discomforting by most \npeople, such as, for instance, the sound of fingernails \nscraping across a chalkboard or rubbing two pieces of \npolystyrene together (Cox,  2008; Halpern et al.,  1986; \nSchweiger Gallo et al.,  2017). The discomfort induced \nby these, henceforth called aversive sounds, has been \nrelated to specific acoustic properties such as a high \nspectral frequency and rather little temporal modula-\ntion (Kumar et al.,  2008). Such aversive sounds elicit \na distinctive pattern of heart rate responses compared \nto other unpleasant, pleasant and neutral sounds \n(Schweiger Gallo et al.,  2017). On the neural level, they \nactivate the amygdala, reflecting the sound's association \nwith negative emotions, and are (in comparison to neu-\ntral sounds) accompanied by higher activity in auditory \ncortex regions (Kumar et al.,  2012). In the current study, \nwe use electroencephalography (EEG) to compare brain \nresponses and their habituation characteristics between \nsuch aversive sounds and sounds with neutral valence \nthat are embedded as infrequent “deviant” sounds in an \noddball paradigm while participants do not pay atten-\ntion to the sound input.The emotional valence of sounds is very likely eval-\nuated automatically during early processing steps (e.g., \nPaulmann & Kotz,  2008; Schirmer et al.,  2005). From other \nresearch, we know that the auditory system automatically \ndetects and exploits regularities in the auditory environ-\nment. Specifically, the mismatch negativity (MMN) as a \ncomponent of the auditory event- related potential (ERP) \nis often used as a measure to tap into this automatic, pre- \nattentive auditory processing (for reviews see, e.g., Escera \n& Malmierca,  2014; Näätänen et al.,  2007; Schröger,  2005). \nMMN is typically studied in auditory oddball paradigms, \nwhich present participants with a sequence of frequent \n“standard” sounds randomly interspersed with infre -\nquent, unexpected “deviant” sounds that differ from the \nstandards in terms of some acoustic feature. The MMN is \na characteristic frontocentral negativity that is observed \nin the difference of the deviant minus standard ERP be -\ntween 100 ms and 250 ms relative to deviance onset, often \naccompanied by a polarity reversal at bilateral mastoids \n(Näätänen et al.,  1978, 2007; Schröger,  2005). MMN has \nbeen argued to result from a mismatch between antici-\npated and actual auditory input, with the anticipated input \nstemming from an internal model of the environment that \nwas extracted from the regularities in stimulation and used \nto predict upcoming sensory events (Näätänen et al.,  2007; \nSchröger,  2005). We use MMN as a tool to study the pro -\ncessing of aversive and neutral sounds that deviate from \nthe regular auditory environment.\nAs supported by various studies, the magnitude of \nthe MMN elicited by a deviant is sensitive to the affec-\ntive content of the eliciting sound. Most of these stud-\nies used voices (that pronounced a specific syllable) as \nstimuli that were arranged in typical oddball sequences, \nwith deviants differing from the standards with respect \nto their emotional valence in pronunciation. For ex -\nample, the MMN amplitudes were enhanced for angry \ncompared to neutral deviants and correlated with phys -\niological arousal in terms of heart rate acceleration, \nwhich indicated that the MMN amplitude is modulated \nby the deviants' (emotional) relevance for the listener \n(Schirmer & Escoffier,  2010). Chen et al. (2016) reported arousal and valence ratings of each sound item revealed that stimulus- specific \nMMN amplitudes were best predicted by the interaction of deviant position and \nperceived arousal, but not by valence. Deviants with perceived higher arousal \nelicited larger MMN amplitudes only at the first deviant position, indicating that \nthe MMN reflects preattentive processing of the emotional content of sounds.\nKEYWORDS\narousal, aversive sounds, emotion, event- related potential, mismatch negativity\n 14698986, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.14450, Wiley Online Library on [15/10/2023].

Furthermore, the increased MMN am-\nplitudes for deviants that differ from the standards in \nterms of their emotional valence occur in particular for \ncertain emotions: When comparing angry and happy de -\nviants among neutral standards, angry deviants consis -\ntently evoked a larger MMN than happy deviants even \nin the absence of attention to the stimulation, which \nindicates a processing bias towards negative emotional \ninformation (Chen et al.,  2018). Likewise, disgusted \n(compared to happy) deviants in a sequence of neutral \nstandards were associated with activation of the anterior \ninsula, a brain region implicated in negative emotional \nexperience (Chen et al.,  2014). The finding that MMN \namplitudes were increased and MMN latencies were de -\ncreased specifically for fearful (compared to happy, sad \nand neutral) voices further supports a susceptibility of \nthe MMN to processing negative emotional content and \nsuggests that emotional stimuli with a special relevance \nfrom an evolutionary perspective are processed prefer -\nentially (Carminati et al.,  2018). Notably, the authors \nfound that the amplitudes were also largest for fearful \nvoices during the subsequent P3a time window (Carmi-\nnati et al.,  2018). P3a is often observed in response to \ndeviant or novel sounds in auditory oddball paradigms \nand is commonly associated with an involuntary shift of \nattention towards unexpected, distracting stimuli (see, \ne.g., Escera et al., 1998; Polich, 2007).\nTo the best of our knowledge, only Czigler \net al. (2007) examined electrophysiological responses to \naversive (compared to neutral) environmental sounds \nother than voices presented as deviants. Participants \nwere instructed to detect targets (differing in pitch) \nwithin a stream of pure tones that also contained the de -\nviants. While both aversive and neutral deviants evoked \na broadly distributed negativity between around 150 ms \nand 250 ms after stimulus onset, amplitudes were sig -\nnificantly larger for aversive than for neutral deviants \n(Czigler et al., 2007).\nThe studies cited so far provide evidence that an \ninitial evaluation of a sound's emotional content takes \nplace during early auditory processing and tends to \nbe biased in favor of negative emotional information. \nHowever, certain aspects regarding the processing of \naversive sounds have not yet been addressed in the lit -\nerature. Specifically, it remains unclear which of the or -\nthogonal dimensions of valence and arousal, commonly \nused to classify emotions (Bradley & Lang,  2000; Posner et al.,  2005; Russell,  1980), drives the preferential pro -\ncessing of aversive stimuli: a sound's unpleasantness \n(i.e., its valence) or rather the associated arousal. We ad-\ndress this issue by taking into account our participants' \nindividual valence and arousal ratings of the stimuli we \npresented.\nBesides the emotional valence, the repetition of a de -\nviant remarkably influences MMN magnitude. EEG stud-\nies have typically shown diminished MMN in response \nto repeated deviants, that is, deviants directly following \nanother deviant (e.g., Müller & Schröger,  2007; Müller \net al.,  2005a, 2005b; Sams et al.,  1984). This effect is pre -\nsumably related to the well-  established phenomenon of \nhabituation: a decrease in neural response to a repeatedly \npresented stimulus. Habituation enables effective pro -\ncessing of novel and potentially more relevant sensory \nevents (Müller et al.,  2005b). Importantly, habituation of \nthe MMN magnitude was only observed when the two de -\nviants that occurred in a row carried the same stimulus \nfeature (e.g., frequency; Nousak et al.,  1996), and when \nthey were grouped into the same auditory stream (Müller \net al.,  2005a) or tone pair (Müller & Schröger,  2007). Crit -\nically, the MMN amplitude reduction was maximal in re -\nsponse to a repeated deviant that was identical to the first \none (Müller et al.,  2005b). A similar effect was reported \nfor the subsequent P3a, which was considerably reduced \nfollowing an identical, but not following a non- identical \ndeviant repetition (Rosburg et al., 2018).\nIn short, MMN amplitudes underlie habituation if \ndeviants are repeated in directly consecutive trials, espe -\ncially if the repeated deviants are identical. However, it \nremains unexplored whether deviant repetition effects in-\nteract with the emotional content of the repeated deviant, \nespecially its unpleasantness. Since emotional, especially \naversive or painful stimuli, may carry relevant informa-\ntion about potential threats that require a prompt adap -\ntive response, it is plausible to assume that habituation is \nsuppressed for this kind of stimuli compared to emotion-\nally neutral stimuli. For instance, previous studies in the \nvisual domain reported diminished habituation of N1 am-\nplitudes for negative compared to positive or neutral pic-\ntures (Carretié et al.,  2003), reduced habituation (signaled \nby the absence of the typical inhibition-  of- return effect) \nfor angry compared to happy or neutral faces (Pérez- \nDueñas et al.,  2014), and decreased adaptation of steady- \nstate visual-  evoked potential amplitudes to face identity \nfor fearful compared to happy or neutral faces (Gerlicher \net al.,  2014). Hence, one could expect a similar suppres -\nsion of habituation also for sounds that are particularly \naversive in nature and potential carriers of threat- related \ninformation.\nTherefore, we examined potential habituation ef-\nfects to aversive auditory events during early processing \n 14698986, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.14450, Wiley Online Library on [15/10/2023].

Beyond replicating the \neffects of deviant unpleasantness and deviant repe -\ntition on MMN amplitudes, which have been studied \nseparately so far, we aimed to investigate potential \ninteraction effects of these factors. Participants were \npresented with oddball sequences that contained natu-\nralistic environmental sounds as deviants that were ei-\nther of aversive or of neutral emotional valence among \nwhite noise standards. Deviants occurred as single de -\nviants (following and preceding a standard sound) or \nas deviant pairs (the same deviant presented in two \nconsecutive trials). This allowed us to measure ERPs \ndepending on the position within deviant pairs, i.e., \nthe effect of habituation, while at the same time con-\ntrolling for physical stimulus differences. In accordance \nwith earlier findings, we expected (a) enhanced MMN \namplitudes in response to aversive as compared to neu-\ntral deviants (effect of emotion), and (b) decreased \nMMN amplitudes in response to deviants in the second \nas compared to the first position in a deviant pair (ha-\nbituation). The higher emotional relevance of aversive \nrelative to neutral sounds would render habituation to \nthese sounds evolutionarily maladaptive. Hence, criti-\ncally, we assumed (c) habituation effects only for neu-\ntral, but not or to a lesser extent for aversive deviants. \nImportantly, we also explored the relationship between \nparticipants' valence and arousal ratings of all sound \nitems that occurred as deviants and MMN amplitudes \nat the item-  and participant- level. This allowed us to \ndisentangle whether potential differences between the \nemotional categories were driven by the stimulus va-\nlence or rather by the associated arousal.\n2 | METHODS\n2.1 | Participants\nA total of N  = 24 participants (21 female, three male) \ntook part in the experiment, most of them being un-\ndergraduate psychology students at Leipzig University \n(Germany). They were between 18 and 39 years old \n(M = 22.46 years, SD = 4.89 years), all of them were right-  \nhanded, and reported normal or corrected- to- normal vi-\nsion, normal hearing, and no history of any neurological \nor psychiatric disorder. Data from all tested participants \nwere included in the analysis. All participants were \nnaïve regarding the purpose of the experiment and gave \nwritten informed consent before the testing started. Ex-\nperimental procedures were performed in accordance \nwith the Declaration of Helsinki, and subjects received \neither course credits or monetary compensation (8€/hr) \nfor their participation.2.2 | Stimulation\n2.2.1 | Auditory oddball sequences\nAuditory stimuli were delivered binaurally via head-\nphones (Sennheiser HD- 25- 1 II, Sennheiser GmbH & Co. \nKG, Germany) at approximately 72 dB SPL. The audi-\ntory oddball sequences consisted of standard and deviant \nsounds, each of which had a duration of 300 ms. Stimu-\nlus onset asynchrony (SOA) between two consecutive \nsounds was jittered between 500 ms and 1000 ms (in 10 \nsteps of 50 ms) around a mean SOA of 750 ms. Gaussian \nwhite noise served as a standard stimulus, which occurred \nin 80% of the auditory trials. Deviants were presented in \nthe remaining 20% of the trials and differed with regard \nto their emotional valence (unpleasantness), such that \nhalf of them were neutral and the other half of them were \naversive.\nDeviants were drawn from a pool of 18 different envi-\nronmental sounds, which had been selected in a pre- test. \nIn this pre- test, a different group of participants rated \nthe unpleasantness for overall 75 environmental sounds, \nincluding natural sounds (such as sounds of birds or \nwater), but also, for instance, cries, metal scraping, or \nstyrofoam squeezing sounds. Based on these ratings \nand the sounds' characteristics regarding the parameter \nspace of the modeled auditory cortex representation (see \nShamma,  2003), we selected a subset of 18 sounds—  \nnine aversive and nine neutral ones. These stimuli were \nchosen on the criteria of maximizing differences in un-\npleasantness ratings between the two categories, while \nminimizing differences regarding the dominant spectral \nand temporal modulation frequencies in the modeled \nauditory representations, particularly when sound du-\nration was trimmed to shorter values (i.e., 300 ms). All \nstimuli were matched in terms of loudness, using the \nmodel by Glasberg and Moore for time-  varying sounds \n(Glasberg & Moore, 2002).\nStimuli were arranged in oddball sequences such that \nthe sequence of standards was randomly interspersed \nwith deviants. The latter either occurred as single de -\nviants, i.e., between two standards, or as double devi-\nants, i.e., as a pair of deviants presented in two directly \nsuccessive trials (see Figure  1). Each of the 18 deviant \nsounds occurred equally often as a single and as a dou-\nble deviant. Note that the two deviants within a double \ndeviant pair were always identical, and randomization \nwas restricted such that the second deviant in a pair \nwas always followed by a standard (i.e., no triple devi-\nants occurred). Furthermore, single deviants and dou-\nble deviants were presented equally often, leading to a \n50% probability for either a standard or another (iden-\ntical) deviant following the first deviant after a row of \n 14698986, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.14450, Wiley Online Library on [15/10/2023].

The \ndisplay consisted of a white fixation cross (width and \nheight: 0.37° visual angle) in the center of the screen and \neight black- squared frames (width and height: 0.50° visual \nangle) arranged in a circle around the fixation cross (ra-\ndius: 2.11° visual angle) at equal distance from each other \non a gray background.\nDuring each visual trial, a white square appeared \nrandomly at one of the eight frame positions for 150 ms. Subjects were asked to fixate the central cross and to com-\npare the position of the white square to the position of \nthe white square two trials before (i.e., 2- back). They were \ninstructed to press a button whenever they detected a 2- \nback target, that is, when the position of the square in the \ncurrent trial matched the position of the square two trials \nbefore (see Figure  1). The SOA for the appearance of the \nwhite squares was set to 1500 ms. 2- back targets occurred \nrandomly in 15% of the visual trials, with the only restric-\ntion that each 2- back target was followed by at least two \nnon- target trials.\n2.3 | Procedure\nDuring the EEG experiment, participants sat inside a \nsoundproof and electrically shielded cabin. Stimulus \npresentation was controlled using the Psychophys-\nics Toolbox extension (PTB- 3; Brainard,  1997; Kleiner \net al.,  2007) in Matlab (version R2016a; The MathWorks \nInc., USA). Participants' button presses were captured FIGURE 1 Schematic display of concurrent visual and auditory stimulus sequences presented to the participants. In the visual sequence \n(top of the figure), a white square probe occurred for 150 ms randomly at one of eight possible positions (dark gray frames) every 1500 ms. \nConcurrently, but unrelated to the visual task, a sequence of 300- ms sounds (bottom of figure) was presented with an SOA jittered between \n500 and 1000 ms (in 10 steps). A white noise token (black) was presented in 80% of the auditory trials (standard sound), whereas occasionally \neither an aversive (purple) or a neutral (green) deviant sound was presented, either in isolation (single deviant) or as a pair (double deviant). \nThe figure shows an example of an aversive double deviant preceded by three standard sounds and a neutral single deviant preceded by \ntwo standard sounds.

Before the start of the actual experiment, par-\nticipants had the chance to familiarize themselves with \nthe visual task.\nTrials were arranged in 16 blocks. Each block lasted ap -\nproximately 3.4 min and comprised 270 auditory trials (54 \ndeviant and 216 standard sounds, corresponding to 20% \nand 80% of the trials, respectively) and 140 visual trials. \nThus, over the course of all blocks, each of the 18 deviant \nsounds was presented 24 times, 8 times as a single deviant \nand 8 times as a double deviant (with each double deviant \ncorresponding to two sound presentations, respectively). \nIn the first 4 s of each block, only visual stimuli were pre -\nsented in order to engage participants in the visual distrac-\ntor task before the auditory sequence started, which they \nhad been instructed to ignore. Auditory and visual trials \nwere neither temporally synchronized nor otherwise sys -\ntematically related. Detection performance for visual tar -\ngets was assessed via hit and false alarm rates and reaction \ntimes for correct responses to check participants' atten-\ntion towards the task. We used hit and false alarm rates to \ncompute the sensitivity index d ’, defined as the difference \nof the inverse normal transforms of hit rate minus false \nalarm rate (corrected using the so-  called log- linear trans -\nform, see: Hautus & Lee, 2006).\nAfter the EEG experiment, we asked participants to rate \nthe auditory stimuli regarding their valence and arousal \non 9- point Likert scales using self- assessment manikins \n(SAM; Bradley & Lang,  1994). The valence scale ranged \nfrom 1 = very negative to 9 = very positive and the arousal \nscale ranged from 1 = not aroused at all to 9 = very aroused. \nThe 18 deviant stimuli and the standard stimulus were \npresented in random order four times, such that valence \nratings were obtained in the first two runs and arousal rat -\nings in the last two runs.\n2.4 | EEG data acquisition\nDuring the experiment, EEG data were recorded continu-\nously from 32 Ag/AgCl active electrodes mounted in an \nelastic cap according to the extended 10– 20 system with \nthe following electrode positions: FP1, FP2, AF3, AF4, Fz, \nF3, F4, F7, F8, FC1, FC2, FC5, FC6, Cz, C3, C4, T7, T8, \nCP1, CP2, CP5, CP6, Pz, P3, P4, P7, P8, PO3, PO4, Oz, O1, \nand O2. Additionally, signals were recorded from left and \nright mastoids (M1, M2) and from electrodes placed on the \nouter canthus of each eye and above and below the right \neye (horizontal and vertical electrooculogram). One elec-\ntrode on the tip of the nose served for later offline refer-\nencing. Online high- pass and low- pass filters were applied \nduring recording, attenuating frequencies below 0.16 Hz \nand above 100 Hz, respectively. Signals (referenced to the CMS- DRL ground) were amplified with a BioSemi \nActiveTwo amplifier (BioSemi B.V., Amsterdam, Nether-\nlands) and digitized with a sampling rate of 512 Hz.\n2.5 | EEG data processing and \nstatistical analysis\nEEG data were processed offline in Matlab (version \nR2018b, The MathWorks Inc., USA) with the EEGLAB \ntoolbox (version 15.0.1; Delorme & Makeig,  2004). Statis-\ntical analyses were conducted in RStudio (version 4.0.1; \nR Core Team,  2020). After pre- processing, we determined \nand compared MMN latencies, and analyzed the MMN \namplitudes in two ways: First, to identify the overall ef-\nfects of deviant unpleasantness and position, we com-\npared amplitudes category- wise between deviants priorly \ncategorized as neutral or aversive that occurred at the first \nposition (following a standard) or at the second position \n(following a deviant). Second, we evaluated the relation-\nship between stimulus- specific ratings of deviant sounds \n(in terms of their valence and arousal) and the amplitude \nof the MMN they elicit when presented at the first or sec-\nond position.\n2.5.1 | Preprocessing\nData were referenced to the electrode located on the tip \nof the nose and high- pass filtered at 0.2 Hz (transition \nbandwidth: 0.4 Hz, Kaiser beta: 5.65) and low- pass filtered \nat 35 Hz (transition bandwidth: 10 Hz, Kaiser beta: 5.65) \nwith Kaiser- windowed sinc finite impulse response fil-\nters.

We computed \ndifference waveforms by subtracting the standard ERP \nfrom the deviant ERP for each of the four deviant types \n(aversive/neutral × first/second position). We extracted \nindividual MMN peak latencies— defined as the latency \nof the minimum within a time window that ranged from \n100 ms to 250 ms after stimulus onset— from the differ-\nence waveforms at electrode Fz for each deviant type. We \nstatistically compared the extracted MMN latencies be-\ntween the conditions using a repeated- measures analysis \nof variance (ANOVA) with the two- level factors Unpleas-\nantness (neutral vs. aversive) and Position (first vs. second \nposition). Mauchly's test of sphericity was used to check \nwhether the assumption of sphericity was fulfilled, and \nnon- sphericity (as indicated by a significant Mauchly's \ntest with p < .05) was automatically corrected by applying \nGreenhouse– Geisser correction.\nSubsequently, we computed grand averages across par -\nticipants from the single-  subject difference waveforms for \nthe four deviant types (using the grandaverage plugin for \nEEGLAB, authored by Andreas Widmann, https://github.\ncom/widma nn/grand average). We determined time win-\ndows for the statistical analysis of MMN amplitudes based \non the MMN peak latencies in the grand average differ -\nence waveforms, again at electrode Fz and within a time \nwindow from 100 ms to 250 ms relative to stimulus onset. \nMMN latencies were shorter for deviants at the first posi-\ntion (neutral: 129 ms; aversive: 121 ms) than for deviants \nat the second position (neutral: 146 ms; aversive: 156 ms). \nTherefore, we defined position-  specific 40 ms time win-\ndows centred around the mean peak latency across devi-\nant unpleasantness levels for the first and second position, \nrespectively. Specifically, MMN time windows ranged \nfrom 105 ms to 145 ms for deviants at the first position, \nand from 131 ms to 171 ms for deviants at the second po -\nsition. From these time windows, we extracted mean am-\nplitudes at electrodes Fz, M1, and M2 for each subject for \neach of the four deviant types. To capture the strength of \nthe whole dipole associated with the typical frontocentral \nnegativity and mastoidal positivity, we subtracted the av -\nerage of the amplitudes at M1 and M2 from the amplitude \nat Fz. Following this, we submitted the resulting mean \nMMN amplitudes to a repeated- measures ANOVA with \nthe two- level factor unpleasantness (neutral vs. aversive) \nand position (first vs. second position).\n2.5.3 | Stimulus-  wise MMN analysis\nWe used linear mixed models (built with the lmer func-\ntion of the lm4 package in RStudio; Bates et al.,  2015) to \npredict MMN amplitudes as a function of the stimulus- \nspecific ratings of the respective deviant sound (in terms of its valence and arousal) and its position. This approach \nallowed to model fixed effects of the predictors while con-\ntrolling for random variance by including random effects \n(e.g., from random intersubject variance) in the model. \nHence, we included participants as a random effect in all \nour models. Valence and arousal ratings for each stimu-\nlus were averaged across the two runs within each par-\nticipant and mean- centred prior to the linear mixed model \nanalysis. We extracted individual mean MMN amplitudes \n(again at electrode Fz minus the mean of M1 and M2) for \neach of the 18 deviant stimuli from position- specific time \nwindows as described above.\nIn two separate analyses, models were specified analo -\ngously for valence and arousal ratings. We computed full \nmodels, including the (valence or arousal) rating of a devi-\nant, its position, the interaction of the two factors as fixed \neffects, and random intercepts for participants to predict \nMMN amplitudes. We assessed the significance of the \nfixed effects with t - tests using Satterthwaite approximation. \nWhenever the interaction effect reached significance, we \ncompared the full model (using χ2- tests) to a reduced model \nthat considered only (valence or arousal) rating and position \nas fixed effects, but not their interaction, to test whether the \ninteraction significantly improves the model fit above and \nbeyond the effects of (valence or arousal) rating and posi-\ntion. Furthermore, we compared the full model to reduced \nmodels that considered only (valence or arousal) rating or \nposition as the only fixed effect, thus testing whether adding \nposition or (valence or arousal) rating as an additional pre -\ndictor improved the model significantly.\n2.5.4 | Time course of differences between \nneutral and aversive deviant ERPs\nBased on previous studies, our main hypotheses were fo-\ncussed on the peak of the MMN component, yet processing \ndifferences between neutral and aversive deviants seemed \nto occur already earlier after the sound onset. Therefore, \nwe additionally explored the latency of the earliest pro-\ncessing differences through a non- parametric cluster- \nbased permutation test (Maris & Oostenveld,  2007). The \ntime courses of neutral and aversive deviant ERP (from \n−100 to 500 ms; averaged across positions 1 and 2) were \ncompared using point- wise independent- samples t- tests \nto identify clusters of amplitude differences between neu-\nral versus aversive deviants (using an alpha of p < .05). A \npermutation approach was used to compare cluster- level \nt- scores against a null hypothesis distribution (using a \ntmax procedure, 1000 permutations, and an alpha level of \np < .05) in order to determine time intervals of significant \ndifferences between neutral and the aversive deviant ERP, \nspecifically in a frontal electrode cluster (around Fz).\n 14698986, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.14450, Wiley Online Library on [15/10/2023].

Indi-\nvidual d’- values ranged from 1.66 to 3.55 around a mean \nof 2.71 (SD = 0.46). The mean reaction time for the 2- back \ntarget detection was 474 ms (SD = 75 ms). Together these \ndata suggest that the visual distractor task was challeng-\ning, but all participants performed well above chance. \nThese results indicate that their attention was successfully \ndirected towards the task.\n3.2 | Ratings of auditory stimuli\nIn Figure  2 and in Table  1, we show the average valence \nand arousal ratings (and their standard error of mean or \nstandard deviation) for each of the 18 deviant stimuli as \nwell as for the standard stimulus. Overall, participants \ntended to rate aversive deviants as more arousing and \nmore negative than neutral deviants. The standard stimu-\nlus was located between the two types of deviants on both \nthe valence and the arousal dimension. Notably, partici-\npants in the current study rated two of the stimuli that had \nbeen categorized as aversive in the previous pilot study \n(aversive stimulus 1 and stimulus 5) as rather neutral (i.e., \nvalence and arousal ratings were comparable to those of \nthe neutral deviants). Therefore, these two stimuli were \nexcluded from the category- wise ERP analysis.\n3.3 | EEG data\nFigure  3 shows ERPs (at electrode Fz and averaged bilat-\neral mastoids) evoked by the standard stimulus and by \nneutral and aversive deviants at the first and second posi-\ntion, as well as the difference waveforms (deviant minus \nthe standard ERP) for each of the four deviant types.

Across both neutral and aversive deviants, the MMN peaked somewhat earlier in response to deviants at the \nfirst position compared to deviants at the second position. \nThe ANOVA with the factors unpleasantness (aversive \nvs. neutral) and position (1 vs. 2) revealed a significant \nmain effect of position, F(1, 23) = 31.26, p < .001, par-\ntial η2 = 0.58, supporting the notion of an overall shorter \nMMN peak latency for deviants at the first compared to \nthe second position. Conversely, there was neither a main \neffect of Unpleasantness, F(1, 23) < 0.01, p = .945, partial \nη2 < 0.01, nor an interaction between the two factors, F(1, \n23) = 1.46, p = .239, partial η2 = 0.06, suggesting that the \nunpleasantness of a deviant does not influence the MMN \npeak latency.\n3.3.2 | MMN amplitudes: Category-  wise \neffects of the deviant unpleasantness and position\nIn the right panel of Figure  4, we depict individual \nand mean MMN amplitudes for neutral and aversive FIGURE 2 Mean valence (x- axis) and arousal (y- axis) ratings \nfor all 18 deviant stimuli and the standard stimulus.

To resolve the significant interaction, we computed \nseparate models including Arousal rating as a fixed effect for \nthe first and for the second position, respectively.

A cluster- based permutation test revealed that \nsignificant ERP differences in an electrode cluster around \nFz emerged as early as 50 ms after deviant onset and lasted until around 320 ms (with a short interval of nonsignificance \nbetween 126 and 154 ms after the deviant onset).\n4 | DISCUSSION\nUsing a modified oddball paradigm with single and dou-\nble deviants we explored how MMN amplitudes are mod-\nulated (a) by the aversive nature of deviant stimuli, (b) by \n(identical) deviant repetition in successive trials, and (c) \nby potential interactions of those two factors.\nAcross conditions, all deviants elicited a clear MMN, \nas reflected by a frontocentrally distributed negativity, \naccompanied by a polarity reversal at mastoidal elec-\ntrodes.

In particular, at the \nfirst presentation of a deviant, more arousing sounds were \nassociated with larger MMN amplitudes.\n4.1 | Increased MMN amplitude for \naversive deviants\nThe finding that MMN amplitudes were enhanced in re-\nsponse to aversive (compared to neutral) deviants is consist-\nent with our hypothesis and closely in line with the results \nof a previous study (Czigler et al.,  2007). It suggests that \nnovel auditory stimuli are discriminated with regard to their \nunpleasantness at an early stage of processing. In fact, pro-\ncessing differences between neutral and aversive deviants \nemerged as early as 50 ms after sound onset (i.e., around the \ntime of the beginning slope of the MMN). Aversive deviants \nmay initiate evaluation processes that enable the prepara-\ntion of adaptive behavioral reactions to potentially relevant \nor even threatening changes in the environment (Czigler \net al.,  2007; see also, Schirmer & Escoffier,  2010). Our find-\nings extend those of Czigler et al.  (2007) in two critical \nways: First, Czigler et al. showed larger MMN amplitudes \nfor aversive than for everyday sounds while participants \nperformed an auditory discrimination task, whereas in the \npresent study participants' attention was directed away from \nthe auditory stimulation towards a visual distractor task. \nOur findings show distinct central auditory processing for \naversive compared to neutral sounds even when attention \nis directed to another modality, consistent with automatic, \npre- attentive processing of aversive sounds. Second, we \nmatched the dominant spectral frequencies and temporal \nmodulation frequencies between neutral and aversive de-\nviants in the stimuli we used. Hence, MMN amplitude dif-\nferences may be more reliably attributed to the emotional \nvalence and associated arousal of the sounds instead of low-  \nlevel acoustic properties. Nevertheless, based on the current \nstudy we cannot easily distinguish whether the observed \ndifferences between neutral and aversive deviants are attrib-\nutable either to a genuine emotional mismatch response or \nto the processing of the emotional (aversive) stimulus con-\ntent per se, which modifies or accompanies auditory deviant \nprocessing.\n4.2 | Increased MMN amplitude \nfor repeated deviants across \nunpleasantness levels\nContrary to our hypothesis and in contrast to previous \nstudies (Müller et al.,  2005b; Sams et al.,  1984), identical \ndeviant repetition did not result in a decrease (i.e., the expected habituation), but in an increase of MMN am-\nplitudes in response to deviants at the second compared \nto deviants at the first position. We found this enhance-\nment of MMN amplitudes as a result of deviant repeti-\ntion for both neutral and aversive sounds. This is also \ninconsistent with our hypothesis of differential effects \ndepending on the unpleasantness of the repeated devi-\nant. We consider two reasons for this unexpected result.\nFirst, the discrepancy between the present and pre -\nvious findings might be a consequence of differences \nin the auditory stimulus material. Whereas earlier \nstudies were conducted with simple sine tones (Müller \net al.,  2005b; Sams et al.,  1984), we employed complex \nand more ecologically valid environmental sounds that \nmight have led to different repetition effects. In fact, two \nmagnetoencephalography studies provide evidence for \nenhanced brain responses that emerge around 150 ms \nafter sound onset following the repeated presentation of \ncomplex frequency- modulated sounds, but not follow -\ning the repeated presentation of simpler unmodulated \ntones (Altmann et al.,  2011; Heinemann et al.,  2010). \nNotably, the effect was specific to the first repetition of \na frequency- modulated sound and gave way to a second-  \norder repetition suppression during further repetitions \n(Altmann et al.,  2011). It remains to be clarified by fu-\nture research whether this pattern of initial repetition \nenhancement and subsequent repetition suppression \nholds true for complex environmental sounds as used \nin our study, and whether it may be modulated by the \nemotional content of the stimuli. Similarly, a recent \nstudy compared neural adaptation to complex vocal and \nnon-  vocal sounds and found that repetition suppression \nwas delayed, i.e., required more repetitions to occur, for \nacoustically richer vocal compared to non-  vocal sounds, \nfurther suggesting that sound complexity may modulate \nthe pattern of repetition effects (Heurteloup et al.,  2022).\nSecond, amplitude differences between conditions in \nthe MMN time window might be confounded with ampli-\ntude differences in earlier or later time windows. In our \ndata, both neutral and aversive deviants evoked a positive \nP3a component from around 200 ms after sound onset for \ndeviants in the first position (cf. Figure  3, best seen in the \ndifference waves at Fz, third row). The P3a component \nmay already begin to emerge at time points overlapping \nwith the MMN time window, thereby partly canceling out \nthe MMN, particularly in conditions with large P3a ampli-\ntudes. Given that the P3a seems strongly diminished for \ndeviant repetitions (in line with previous research, e.g., \nRosburg et al.,  2018), the MMN amplitude differences be -\ntween first and second deviant position are more likely to \nreflect an overlap with a larger P3a resulting in a smaller \nMMN for the first deviant than an increased MMN for the \nsecond deviant.\n 14698986, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.14450, Wiley Online Library on [15/10/2023].

      "text": "14 of 16 |   \nRINGER et al.\n4.3 | Influence of individual \narousal, but not valence ratings on \nMMN amplitudes\nAbove and beyond the comparison of MMN amplitudes \nto deviants priorly categorized as neutral or aversive, we \nevaluated the relationship between individual ratings of \nsounds and MMN amplitudes when presented as deviants \nat the first or the second position. Analyses of valence and \narousal ratings allowed to dissociate which of these two \nwell- established dimensions to describe and classify emo-\ntions (Posner et al.,  2005; Russell,  1980) was specifically as-\nsociated with MMN amplitudes. Interestingly, we did not \nfind any predictive value for MMN amplitude in the indi-\nvidual valence ratings. However, we found that individual \narousal ratings reliably predicted MMN amplitudes in inter-\naction with the position of the deviant. MMN amplitudes for \ndeviants were overall larger at the second than at the first \nposition, but more arousing stimuli were associated with en-\nhanced MMN amplitudes for deviants only at the first, but \nnot at the second position. While literature on dissociable \neffects of valence and arousal in response to auditory stimuli \nis scarce (see, e.g., Scheumann et al.,  2017), more research \nhas been done in the visual domain. For instance, Anders \net al. (2004) found that the valence and arousal of emotional \npictures were consistently related to activity in distinct brain \nregions and to distinct peripheral physiological reactions \nin a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Vogt \net al. (2008), on the other hand, showed that the allocation of \n(spatial) attention was dependent on the arousal induced by \nan emotional picture, but not on its valence. Kensinger and \nCorkin (2004) reported that— compared to neutral words—  \nimproved memory capacity for (negative) emotional words \nrelied on distinct neural networks depending on whether the \nwords were arousing: memory capacity for highly arousing, \nas opposed to non- arousing words, was specifically related \nto activity in the amygdala irrespective of stimulus valence, \nwhich the authors argued to be triggered automatically. If \nwe consider MMN to reflect pre- attentive, automatic stim-\nulus processing, its dependence on or predictability by the \narousal associated with a deviant might suggest contribu-\ntions from brain structures associated with processing emo-\ntional or arousing stimuli. For instance, Kumar et al. (2012) \nshowed that aversive sounds activated the amygdala, and \nthat amygdala activity, in turn, modulated activity in the \nauditory cortex in order to facilitate sensory processing and \nevaluation of these stimuli. This is also in line with previ-\nously reported amygdala activation for emotional compared \nto neutral voices (Schirmer et al., 2008).\nRegarding ERPs, there have been only few attempts to \ndissociate the effects of valence and arousal. A study by \nRozenkrants and Polich (2008) used images from the Inter -\nnational Affective Pictures System (IAPS) and found larger ERP amplitudes (e.g., N2, P3) in response to stimuli associ-\nated with high compared to low arousal, whereas stimulus \nvalence had only weak effects on late ERPs. The authors \nsuggested that arousal is the primary determinant of af-\nfective oddball processing. Thus, an explanation along the \nlines of arousal differences that modulate sensory process -\ning appears plausible for our finding of enhanced MMN \namplitudes in response to rare, more arousing stimuli.\nAt first glance, it may seem counterintuitive that our \ncategory-  wise analysis did not reveal a significant interac-\ntion between deviant unpleasantness and position, whereas \nthe stimulus-  wise analysis showed a link between MMN \namplitudes and participants' arousal ratings that, crucially, \ndepended on the deviant position. However, rather than a \ndiscrepancy, the results may reflect a specification of the ef-\nfect of emotional content on MMN amplitudes: The interac-\ntion was driven by one dimension (arousal) of the stimulus' \nunpleasantness and was specific to individual ratings for the \nparticular sound items (rather than to an a priori-  defined \nemotional category). Thus, an interplay between a deviant's \nunpleasantness and its repetition exists, but apparently acts \nmore subtly at the level of individually perceived arousal \nthan to show in the category-  wise analysis.\n5 | CONCLUSION\nWe show evidence for an enhancement of MMN amplitudes \nin response to aversive compared to neutral environmental \nsounds presented as deviants. However, given that the iden-\ntical repetition of deviants resulted in larger MMN ampli-\ntudes for the second compared to the first deviant, we did \nnot find signs of habituation as originally expected, but in-\nstead observed an unspecific MMN amplitude increase for \nrepeated, complex, and ecologically valid deviants irrespec-\ntive of their unpleasantness. Critically, we provide evidence \nthat an increase in perceived arousal rather than perceived \nvalence of a deviant sound is associated with a stimulus-  \nspecific MMN amplitude enhancement. This strengthens \nthe assumption of a fast emotional evaluation that gates au-\ntomatic sensory processing with all its evolutionary advan-\ntages of allowing adaptive behaviors.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nHanna Ringer: Writing –  original draft; writing –  review \nand editing.
